2006-04-15T08:04:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	why not just install the ones in ubuntu?
2006-04-15T08:05:00.000Z	linux_lover	nickrud	I have lineakd (the actual app) installed.  I need lineakdconfig as well because I'm apparently too stupid to use the first one manually..
2006-04-15T08:05:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	there is no lineakdconfig in ubuntu ;)
2006-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	linux_lover	nickrud	Not in the repos...
2006-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	if you got the leaneakdconfig from somewhere else, it probably won't work
2006-04-15T08:07:00.000Z	linux_lover		Dr Willis nickrud I think I'm going to give up on this one...I've been working one this one bloody app for 3 days now..
2006-04-15T08:07:00.000Z	linux_lover		Dr Willis nickrud Not worth it just to have full functionality of my KB.  I'd rather spend 10
2006-04-15T08:07:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	there's a klineakconfig, you could always aptitude install it, then aptitude remove it when done :)
2006-04-15T08:08:00.000Z	linux_lover		Dr Willis nickrud ...dollars on a new KB that ubuntu recognizes in the first place...
2006-04-15T08:08:00.000Z	linux_lover	nickrud	First, I don't know what aptitude is, second, it's just not worth spending another 8 hours on this bloody KB.
2006-04-15T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	a possibly stupid question: have you been to system-prefs-keyboard tab layouts?
2006-04-15T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	there's a keyboard selection there ...
2006-04-15T08:09:00.000Z	linux_lover	nickrud	Yep.  I looked at all of them and a few are slightly different models.  None worked.
2006-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud		!tell linux_lover about aptitude
2006-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	linux_lover	nickrud	If I could import a file to that list, I'd be in heaven, but apparently what's there is there and that's it.
2006-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	yeah, the new keyboard config for X is a black art.
2006-04-15T08:11:00.000Z	linux_lover	nickrud	I don't think I want to mess with aptitude.  It's apparently a little buggy and I can't trouble-shoot my way out of a wet paper bag.
2006-04-15T08:12:00.000Z	linux_lover		Thanks guys, GN.
2006-04-15T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	linux_lover	I've been using aptitude for over 5 years, and have never been bitten by any bugs.
