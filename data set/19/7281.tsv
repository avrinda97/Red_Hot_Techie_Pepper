2009-08-17T22:07:00.000Z	bidossessi		hi all. i'm looking for an audio player in linux that can loop audo tracks seamlessly. anyone knows of any?
2009-08-17T22:07:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	hmm, how do you mean?
2009-08-17T22:08:00.000Z	bidossessi	koudelka_	well, simply loop over a track without pause at the end.
2009-08-17T22:08:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	hmm i wonder which music player dosen't do that
2009-08-17T22:09:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	the default player rythmbox should do that
2009-08-17T22:09:00.000Z	bidossessi	koudelka_	well none that i tried yet does. there's a difference between restart and loop
2009-08-17T22:09:00.000Z	bidossessi	koudelka_	rhythmbox doesn't loop
2009-08-17T22:10:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	what does it do then?
2009-08-17T22:11:00.000Z	bidossessi	koudelka_	it just restarts the song with an audible pause inbetween restarts
2009-08-17T22:12:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	have you tried enabling crossfade?
2009-08-17T22:12:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	without crossfade i can imagine it is quite stiff cut at the end
2009-08-17T22:13:00.000Z	bidossessi	koudelka_	the track is only 3sec long. neither crossfade nor anything else works with rhythmbox
2009-08-17T22:14:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	ah well then i think you want to use a sound editor
2009-08-17T22:14:00.000Z	koudelka_		!audacity
2009-08-17T22:14:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	try audacity
2009-08-17T22:15:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
2009-08-17T22:15:00.000Z	koudelka_	bidossessi	you should find it in the package manager
2009-08-17T22:16:00.000Z	bidossessi	koudelka_	yeah i found it. will look it up. looks like it will work
