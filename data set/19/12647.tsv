2006-10-02T06:40:00.000Z	mbd		hi! im having some problems with my ati drivers
2006-10-02T06:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Sure, let me determine if it's a hardware issue.
2006-10-02T06:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Is it an ati device?
2006-10-02T06:40:00.000Z	mbd	Arafangion	yes, an 9800pro
2006-10-02T06:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Then you have a problem.
2006-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Best you can do is hope that it works.
2006-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Try the free version.
2006-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	mbd	Arafangion	they ware working just the other day. but now they dont, xorg.conf the same
2006-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Try the non-free one in the repos.
2006-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Try the commercial ones from the ati website.
2006-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	If you're very lucky, one of the three will work.
2006-10-02T06:42:00.000Z	mbd		Arafangion.. hmm.. its just so wierd, i have been using the fglrx for a month or something and the other day 3d acceleration just stopped working..
2006-10-02T06:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	If you have any option, use NVidia.
2006-10-02T06:43:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	I must admit, I have ati too, it just happens to work using the latest ati drivers from the website, but any others don't work, and I can't upgrade my kernel.
2006-10-02T06:43:00.000Z	mbd		well, bought it when i still was on windows..
2006-10-02T06:43:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	But, mine's built into the laptop, so I don't have a choice.
2006-10-02T06:44:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Even on windows, imho, nvidia is better.
2006-10-02T06:44:00.000Z	mbd		and im a poor student so have not much choise
2006-10-02T06:44:00.000Z	Arafangion	mbd	Could always sell it, and get a cheap nvidia.
