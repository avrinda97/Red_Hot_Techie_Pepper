2009-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	evon		can anyone help me with my wireless card? i cannot connect to any detected networks.  I am able to connect these networks from windows but no ubuntu.
2009-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	What's the card?
2009-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	it's a broadcom chipset
2009-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	i can see networks but not connect
2009-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	I have a BCM4306 in my laptop. The restricted hardware recommended driver worked fine.
2009-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	Are you using the right driver?
2009-12-23T12:17:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	well it was working up to 2 days ago and I've never had a problem before
2009-12-23T12:17:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	so i am assuming yes
2009-12-23T12:17:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	That's very strange. Have you upgraded distro version recently? I'm still on 9.04.
2009-12-23T12:18:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	it was working even after i upgraded
2009-12-23T12:19:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	Then I'm forced to assume it's a hardware issue if nothing has been changed.
2009-12-23T12:19:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	but a hardware issue on both computers at the same time?
2009-12-23T12:19:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	i would have concluded an ubuntu issue
2009-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	maybe i'll try reinstalling my drivers
2009-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	It's more likely, to me, that there would be a double hardware fault than that a lack of changes in software would cause different results.
2009-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	Try that. See if it works.
2009-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	but yet the same hardware works fine in windows on both machines
2009-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	Mefached	evon	Oh. I didn't see that.
2009-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	evon	Mefached	hehe
