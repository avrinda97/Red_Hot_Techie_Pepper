2006-09-02T09:14:00.000Z	cool_nick		i am a linux newbie, i just created a new partition using System>Administration>Disks, but i am not able to write any data in the partition. Can someone help me out. . .
2006-09-02T09:14:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	you need to create a file system on it and mount it
2006-09-02T09:16:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	i've done that too, how do i change my user permissions from root to user?
2006-09-02T09:16:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	just mount it somewhere users can write
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	should i have to mount it everytime i reboot?
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	no
2006-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	just write it into /etc/fstab
2006-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	thanks
2006-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	there are some lines there you can easily adopt
2006-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	i'll have to specify the filesystem. . .
2006-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	which one did you create? ;)
2006-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	resierfs
2006-09-02T09:20:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	then write that one
2006-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	ok! why is notail option used?
2006-09-02T09:22:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	from man mount: notail By default, reiserfs stores small files and `file tails' directly into its tree. This confuses some utilities such as LILO(8).  This option is used to disable packing of files into the tree.
2006-09-02T09:23:00.000Z	cool_nick	ChaosFan	can you suggest me some good books to learn linux, i like to go the command line way. . .
2006-09-02T09:23:00.000Z	ChaosFan	cool_nick	just google for the debian user handbook
