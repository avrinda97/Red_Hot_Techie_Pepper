2009-06-12T01:34:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	What Wifi card do you have?
2009-06-12T01:34:00.000Z	edmont	Cloudef	i use a privative driver, broadcom
2009-06-12T01:35:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174 Does that help?
2009-06-12T01:36:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	It seems to be used with old version of ubuntu tho.
2009-06-12T01:37:00.000Z	edmont	Cloudef	i had it working before
2009-06-12T01:37:00.000Z	edmont		the thing is that i dont have the option to activate wireless networking
2009-06-12T01:37:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	It does not regonise your Wifi anymore?
2009-06-12T01:39:00.000Z	edmont	Cloudef	it seems like that
2009-06-12T01:39:00.000Z	edmont	Cloudef	it works in windows
2009-06-12T01:40:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	I see, so its not broken. Did it work before in ubuntu?
2009-06-12T01:40:00.000Z	edmont	Cloudef	yep, with the same config, but i think it doesnt work after i disabled it with the laptop button
2009-06-12T01:41:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	Oh, usually holding the laptop wifi button or removing battery and putting back helps
2009-06-12T01:41:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	If you reset battery i suggest shutdowning first :-)
2009-06-12T01:41:00.000Z	edmont	Cloudef	ok, i'll try
2009-06-12T01:41:00.000Z	edmont		:)
2009-06-12T01:41:00.000Z	Cloudef	edmont	Tell me how it goes
