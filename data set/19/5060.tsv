2012-07-19T15:04:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	Windows doesnt save you from a defective harddisk - windows just ignores the I/O errors and bluescreens afterwards.
2012-07-19T15:05:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	So check your harddisk with smartmontools (smartctl in detail) to see wether your harddisk is about to die.
2012-07-19T15:05:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	Read what I wrote above please.
2012-07-19T15:06:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	There is no alternative.
2012-07-19T15:07:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	Boot a live cd, run smartctl, run a smartctl long test. That will take about two hours.
2012-07-19T15:09:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	Sorry, I didnt get that sentence.
2012-07-19T15:09:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	Forget passmark. Use a livecd and smartctl.
2012-07-19T15:11:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	That doesnt change the fact that a) passmark is useless in your case and b) you have to run smartctl and c) you have to do everything needed, including booting a live cd, to do b). :)
2012-10-18T21:58:00.000Z	bekks	Papa	I bet someone already did.
