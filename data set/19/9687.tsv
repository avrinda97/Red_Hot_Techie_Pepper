2007-10-21T09:11:00.000Z	_tux		Question: is it possible to add a shortcut key to one of the terminals in Gnome? rather than having to click the icon every second
2007-10-21T09:13:00.000Z	seamus7	_tux	you can go into Keyboard Shortcuts on the System/Preferences menu and set one up for a terminal .. I have mine set to F4
2007-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	_tux		I gotcha
2007-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	_tux		cause I am sick of having to click the icon every second
2007-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	_tux		thanks guys
2007-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	_tux		one more question
2007-10-21T09:15:00.000Z	_tux		I have Compiz Fusion installed and I can't figure out for the life of me on how to rotate the desktop cube or get it to work
2007-10-21T09:15:00.000Z	seamus7	_tux	did you insall compizconfig-settings-manager?
2007-10-21T09:15:00.000Z	_tux		yeah
2007-10-21T09:16:00.000Z	_tux		yes riot
2007-10-21T09:16:00.000Z	_tux		I got Desktop Wall to work
2007-10-21T09:17:00.000Z	seamus7		then go to the Advanced Desktop Effects Settings in System/Preferences and enable the Desktop Cube and Rotate ... you can set the scroll wheel of your mouse to activate it if you also enable Viewport Switcher
2007-10-21T09:17:00.000Z	_tux	Dan2552	its set to Ctrl+Alt+Down and it does absolutely nothing
2007-10-21T09:17:00.000Z	seamus7	_tux	see my message above
2007-10-21T09:17:00.000Z	_tux		hard to keep up more than one person is typing to me
2007-10-21T09:18:00.000Z	_tux		yes compizconfig-settings-manager is installed by the way
2007-10-21T09:18:00.000Z	_tux		checking if the rotate cube plugin is installed
2007-10-21T09:19:00.000Z	_tux		lol yay
2007-10-21T09:19:00.000Z	seamus7	_tux	you need Desktop Cube, Rotate Cube and even Viewport Switcher enabled in Adavanced Desktop Settings Manager .... you ought to be able to hold the scroll wheel button down on your mouse and move the cube around
