2009-04-24T05:22:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	ty!
2009-04-24T05:37:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	the synaptics wiki entry doesn't help, there's no mention of making it work the way it did in intrepid
2009-09-14T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	you can run: gksudo nvidia-settings     setup the display then click write to xorg.conf
2009-09-14T16:06:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	thanks.. it's acting really weird, VSync is off, but immediately when i run nvidia-settings it gets turned on (all i do is run nvidia-settings, and dont change anything)
2009-09-14T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	try writing to xorg.conf, it may help
2009-09-14T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	i turn vsync off, gets more frames :)
2009-09-14T16:07:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	yea but it hammers your CPU
2009-09-14T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	not had any troubles since tnt2 ultra was top dog in the video card stakes
2009-09-14T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	i'll try it later, see what happens
2009-09-14T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	what cpu are you running?
2012-02-18T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	get indentified and you can walk in
2012-02-18T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents   explains why its a good idea
2012-02-18T04:05:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	right... like i said, nickname hogging and avoiding complications (invite only channels) that didn't need to exist in the first place :P
2012-02-18T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	its the choice of the channel maintainer. I suggest you take it up in #freenode
2012-02-18T04:06:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	i know i know... i better shut up
2012-02-20T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	i'd extract the deb then copy the .so to /usr/lib32
2012-02-20T03:09:00.000Z	uni4dfx	ActionParsnip	that might work for one deb but not if it has 50+ dependencies :/
2012-02-20T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uni4dfx	yeah it can get messy, try:  sudo apt-get -f install
