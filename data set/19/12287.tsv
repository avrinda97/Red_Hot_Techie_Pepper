2009-04-04T17:32:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		okay, clamav is an antivirus, but antivir too, isn't it ?
2009-04-04T17:34:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		okay, what do do you think which antivirus software should i take ?
2009-04-04T17:34:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		i have a proxyserver (ubuntu server distibution with squid)
2009-04-04T17:36:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		i want to block www.virus.com for example
2009-04-04T17:36:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		so that the users aren't allowed to go to the website
2009-04-04T17:37:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		dns rules ?
2009-04-04T17:37:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		what is it ?
2009-04-04T17:39:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		no, my linux box isn't the router
2009-04-04T17:39:00.000Z	Marcelinho87		i have the proxy between the clients and the rouer
2009-04-04T17:39:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth1  -p tcp -s ###.##.###.## -j DROP
2009-04-04T17:40:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	Where eth1 is the ethernet port from which your unwanted url is coming.
2009-04-04T17:41:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	Was just giving you a command that would implement a firewall rule to block a specific URL.
2009-04-04T17:42:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	You might be interested in firestarter
2009-04-04T17:43:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	Firestarter will create and enable a firewall script for you, and you can go from there and edit the script as you so desire.
2009-04-04T17:43:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	clamav is for virus detection.
2009-04-04T17:46:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	If you use IPcop or Smoothwall there is a URL filter add-on
2009-04-04T17:47:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	You only need to worry about virus if you are a MS Windows user.
2009-04-04T17:51:00.000Z	usr13	Marcelinho87	What kind of firewall router do you have?
