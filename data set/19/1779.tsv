2010-10-10T19:37:00.000Z	lduros		just curious, when will maverick be available for upgrade from the update manager?
2010-10-10T19:38:00.000Z	pdidboatdance	lduros	sudo update-manager -d
2010-10-10T19:38:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		there is an option to upgrade
2010-10-10T19:38:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		in the window
2010-10-10T19:38:00.000Z	lduros	pdidboatdance	but will it happen without doing this? I'm just asking because my parents (in their late 50s, not tech savvy) have ubuntu 10.04 but they in no way want to use the command line
2010-10-10T19:39:00.000Z	lduros	pdidboatdance	just want to make sure they'll get the prompt for the upgrade sometimes down the line
2010-10-10T19:39:00.000Z	pdidboatdance	lduros	have them run that one command in a terminal
2010-10-10T19:39:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		and click upgrade
2010-10-10T19:39:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		then tehy are done
2010-10-10T19:39:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		its not much command line to it
2010-10-10T19:40:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		they could also just run that command with alt f
2010-10-10T19:40:00.000Z	lduros	pdidboatdance	i guess I could do that, but in any case, if you don't' do that command line, you'll never get the upgrade?
2010-10-10T19:40:00.000Z	lduros		just wondering
2010-10-10T19:40:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		idk
2010-10-10T19:40:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		thats how it was explained to me
2010-10-10T19:40:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		i am tethering on a 50kbs 3g connection
2010-10-10T19:41:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		pr0n has no place on ubuntu
2010-10-10T19:41:00.000Z	pdidboatdance		take it to osx
2010-10-10T19:42:00.000Z	lduros	pdidboatdance	the update manager window says it's still a release candidate
