2007-08-30T13:59:00.000Z	bbrazil	omarr_pr	don't try to pull packages from other versions of the distro
2007-08-30T13:59:00.000Z	omarr_pr		that dependencies are for the instalation of wine
2007-08-30T14:00:00.000Z	omarr_pr	bbrazil	that dependencies are for the instalation of wine
2007-08-30T14:00:00.000Z	bbrazil	omarr_pr	where are you pulling it from?
2007-08-30T14:01:00.000Z	omarr_pr	bbrazil	from synaptic
2007-08-30T14:01:00.000Z	bbrazil	omarr_pr	please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-08-30T14:02:00.000Z	omarr_pr	bbrazil	sorry im a rookie with ubuntu and all of that,how can i do that
2007-08-30T14:02:00.000Z	bbrazil	omarr_pr	goto a terminal, then: cat /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-08-30T14:03:00.000Z	bbrazil	omarr_pr	it seems likely that you're included sources that you shouldn't have. anything that has problems with libc6 is very very bad
