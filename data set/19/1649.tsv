2010-11-14T16:40:00.000Z	sapiens__		hi
2010-11-14T16:41:00.000Z	sapiens__		i can't use mi atheros with ubuntu 10.10
2010-11-14T16:41:00.000Z	sapiens__		i can login to 192.168.1.1
2010-11-14T16:42:00.000Z	sapiens__		but i can't establish a connection with the www
2010-11-14T16:42:00.000Z	sapiens__		any idea?
2010-11-14T16:42:00.000Z	sapiens__		only with atheros card
2010-11-14T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 simple test.. try     ping 209.85.225.99   , then try ping google.com
2010-11-14T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 is that 192.168.1.1 your local router? or what?
2010-11-14T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 so your wireless card is cnnecting to the router's web interface?
2010-11-14T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 try the ping test i gave above.. sounds like a 'dns' issue to me.
2010-11-14T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 try pinging this ip not that local net ip.    ping 209.85.225.99   , then try ping google.com
2010-11-14T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 if you can ping   209.85.225.99 succesuffly - then the pc is getting out to t en networkl
2010-11-14T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 so pinging google.com   seemes to have worked?
2010-11-14T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 Packet loss. Hmm.. that could point to some driver issues with the wirless driver.
2010-11-14T21:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 i thought it was determined that the card was working only had VERY high packet loss....
2010-11-14T21:34:00.000Z	sapiens__	Dr_Willis	on ubuntu 10.04 and other linux atheros runs like a charm
2010-11-14T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 I thought  an hr+ was spent earlioer today with you and it was determined the wireless drivers were teh issue.. what has changed since then? you were trying to compile the latest drivers/kernel i thought earlier today
2010-11-14T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 and earlier today you could Ping google.com but with a 60% packet loss...
2010-11-14T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sapiens__	 so basically that all failed?
