Please note that if you do not see the Google WiFi login page immediately, open another site such as www.google.com. This should automatically load the Google WiFi login page.
2006-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	host`		yeah
2006-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	host`		I would think so
2006-10-18T08:03:00.000Z	host`		how do I unistall a package with apt-get?
2006-10-18T08:04:00.000Z	host`		!pastebin
2006-10-18T08:05:00.000Z	host`		when I try to uninstall this package, this is what I get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/27217/
2006-10-18T08:06:00.000Z	host`		I've tried to pkill it with pkill mldonkey-server
2006-10-18T08:06:00.000Z	host`		but that still doesn't work
2006-10-18T08:06:00.000Z	variant	host`	killall -9 mldonkey-server
2006-10-18T08:25:00.000Z	variant	host`	do ps aux | grep donkey
2006-10-18T08:25:00.000Z	variant	host`	if it has a Z in that line then yer fecked
2006-10-18T08:26:00.000Z	variant	host`	if its a zombie process then you have to kill the parent
2006-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	variant	host`	if the parent is "init" then you have a problem (have to reboot) but the thing is, zombie processes are 99.999 percent harmless
2006-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	variant	host`	ps aux | grep donkey
2006-10-18T08:29:00.000Z	variant	host`	thats not it, just the grep process
2006-10-18T08:29:00.000Z	variant	host`	so, you dont have the donkey process running
2006-10-18T08:29:00.000Z	variant	host`	can you take a screenshot of the problem?
