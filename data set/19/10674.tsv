2007-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	AzureLight		What directory are Thunderbirds stuff kept in?
2007-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	AzureLight		I don't think it's X though
2007-12-17T11:35:00.000Z	AzureLight		Because I did have the Nautilus crash
2007-12-17T11:35:00.000Z	AzureLight		I don't mind reformatting and whatnot
2007-12-17T11:35:00.000Z	AzureLight		It's almost 2AM here
2007-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	AzureLight		Eh
2007-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	AzureLight		Welltrue
2007-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	AzureLight		But if that doesn't work, I'm wiping my HD :D
2007-12-17T11:37:00.000Z	AzureLight		Becasue I want a Windows Partition anyways
2007-12-17T11:38:00.000Z	AzureLight		Alright, does anyone have a link to a site that has all the instructions I'll need to dual boot XP and Ubuntu from absolutely nothing?
2007-12-17T11:38:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	install XP, then install Ubuntu.
2007-12-17T11:41:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	I'll sumarize the instructions: create 1 partition of whatever size you want for linux. Then another one for Windows. Then create a small one for swap.
2007-12-17T11:42:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	or better yet: 1st partition, /boot - 200MB, 2nd partition Windows, 3rd partition Linux, 4th partition swap
2007-12-17T11:42:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	also, make SURE you create them all PRIMARY partitions.
2007-12-17T11:43:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	don't bother.
2007-12-17T11:52:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	how big is your disk?
2007-12-17T11:52:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	does it show up as 250GB in your BIOS?
2007-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	probably.
2007-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	Znuff	AzureLight	google wii irc :)
