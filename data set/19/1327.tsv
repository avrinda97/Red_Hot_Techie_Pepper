2011-02-26T13:21:00.000Z	barebone	dr_Willis_	no
2011-02-26T13:21:00.000Z	dr_Willis_	barebone	 whats your video card? system -> admmin -> addational drivers
2011-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	barebone	dr_Willis_	I have installed it once, but it caused some problem, like the logo of ubuntu in boot time disappeared.
2011-02-26T13:23:00.000Z	dr_Willis_	barebone	- the boot  plymouth issues are annoying but not critical.. you want compiz/eye candy? or a nice boot screen?
2011-02-26T13:24:00.000Z	barebone	dr_Willis_	both, can't it be possible?
