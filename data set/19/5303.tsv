2009-03-04T18:48:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	which settings?
2009-03-04T18:50:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	I have a link for you.  Stand by.
2009-03-04T18:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	I used this a few weeks back.  do this:  http://linuxfud.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/how-to-reset-ubuntugnome-settings-to-defaults-without-re-installing/
2009-03-04T18:52:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	it really does remove the settings.  All of them.  It does replace them with defaults, but make sure you really do want to reset the entire Gnome desktop
2009-03-04T18:54:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	yes restart.
2009-03-04T18:55:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	from terminal:  shutdown -r now
2009-03-04T19:01:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	no problem.  It's a good link, bookmark it.
2009-03-04T19:03:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	you have to ask the question.  I don't even know what the problem is.
2009-03-04T19:07:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	I haven't seen that.  I don't know where the settings are kept.  You can try this:  sudo apt-get purge xchat-gnome
2009-03-04T19:08:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	but that will WIPE xchat-gnome entirely
2009-03-04T19:09:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	it will get rid of xchat-gnome entirely, settings and all. I'd recommend xchat as well, though.
2009-03-04T19:09:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	the regular xchat, not xchat-gnome
2009-03-04T19:10:00.000Z	Huufarted	max82fr	yeah.  Why do you prefer the xchat-gnome?
