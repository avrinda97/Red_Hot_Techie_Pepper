2007-05-24T06:55:00.000Z	CarinArr		stefg?
2007-05-24T06:56:00.000Z	stefg	CarinArr	l3on that's *hello world* :-)
2007-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	stefg	CarinArr	can it be that an openGL-screensaver kicks in on a no 3D video?
2007-06-30T05:28:00.000Z	CarinArr	stefg	i didn't have a screensaver at all.. but i've tested my opengl screensavers and they work fine
2007-06-30T05:29:00.000Z	stefg	CarinArr	so might be an acpi-issue, or is it temperature related? (signs of ram beginning to fail)
2007-06-30T05:31:00.000Z	CarinArr	stefg	as far as i can see it's not temperature related. just rebooting the system when it happens and all temperatures are well within normal, and logically if it was temperature related it would be more likely to happen when i'm sat using the machine rather than when i leave it
2007-06-30T05:33:00.000Z	stefg	CarinArr	true... so this leaves the 'machie is trying to go to sleep' theory. maybe some bios setting got messed (weak battery?)
2007-06-30T05:36:00.000Z	CarinArr	stefg	there are known issues with the bios on this machine and linux in general, i.e. sound doesn't work without acpi=off etc. but i'm not sure how this problem would suddenly crop up in the last few days when it's worked fine for over three months
2007-06-30T05:36:00.000Z	stefg	CarinArr	bios bufffer-battery might die slowly, so bios resets itself to default settings
2007-06-30T05:38:00.000Z	stefg	CarinArr	you could verify that theory by booting back to the previous kernel (should still be there
2007-06-30T05:39:00.000Z	CarinArr	stefg	it's not since i updated the kernel though, the newest kernel worked fine for a good while
2007-06-30T05:39:00.000Z	CarinArr	stefg	but yeah, i might try an old kernel next time it crashes and see if it makes a difference
