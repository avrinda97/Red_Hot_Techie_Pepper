2010-01-18T20:30:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		How Can I enable/disable my 2nd monitor without restarting X? (I have nvidia)
2010-01-18T20:32:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		when I select "seperate X screen", it has to restart X
2010-01-18T20:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	you probably don't want "sepearte x screen" you can't drag windows between both monitors with that setting
2010-01-18T20:33:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	ZykoticK9	I can... But I don't want to restart X (cuz I don't always use the 2nd monitor)
2010-01-18T20:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	nvidia can turn twinview on and off on the fly - but starting a second X server on the second monitor will ALWAYS require an Xorg restart
2010-01-18T20:36:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	ZykoticK9	CAn you help me on getting the right reso on my 2nd monitor using twinview
2010-01-18T20:37:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		I can manually type in the reso. But it looks like the monitor can not be higher than 640x480
2010-01-18T20:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	it should be a "no brainer" -- "sudo nvidia-settings" click on 'X Server Display Configuration' on the left side - highlight your monitor on the right, and in the 'Resolution' dropdown list - select what Resolution you want.  Then click 'Save to X Configuration File' button at the bottom.
2010-01-18T20:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	s/"sudo nvidia-settings"/"gksu nvidia-settings"
2010-01-18T20:40:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	ZykoticK9	Yeah, I know it "should" be easy. But look
2010-01-18T20:41:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		 But it looks like the monitor can not be higher than 640x480
2010-01-18T20:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	is it an really old crt monitor?  is it detected by the OS?
2010-01-18T20:42:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		It is and Old CRT. (but it works in seperate X). How can I check if it is detected by the OS ?
2010-01-18T20:42:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	ZykoticK9	^
2010-01-18T20:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	it works at proper resolution in seperate X?  If so, use nvidia-settings to save an xorg with that monitor working, then make a backup to you homedir - then use nvidia-settings again to get twinview setup, and save a differently named backup to your home dir --- THEN you should be able to manually steal the xorg setting from the "sepearte x" file and put them into the twinview file.
2010-01-18T20:45:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	ZykoticK9	that is a good idea. I'll do that now
2010-01-18T20:45:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		thnx in advance!
2010-01-18T21:04:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	ZykoticK9	I've got it working now. Seems that before somethig wasn't configured properly
2010-01-18T21:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Wazzzaaa	nice :)
