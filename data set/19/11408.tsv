2006-01-26T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deonya	 you may want to check the ubuntu wiki/forums - cups is sort of locked down by default - you wont be able to change anything.
2006-01-26T10:46:00.000Z	deonya		damn so I can't install my printer?
2006-01-26T10:46:00.000Z	deonya		how?

2006-01-26T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deonya	 you have tried the gnome printer config tool?

2006-01-26T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deonya	 :P  they actually try to make things easy eh?
2006-01-26T10:53:00.000Z	deonya	Dr_Willis	Yeah I am not used to "easy"
2006-01-26T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		its so handy to have 2+ hard drives however.
