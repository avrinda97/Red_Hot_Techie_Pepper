2005-02-14T08:57:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	awesome!
2005-02-21T11:37:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	"dpkg -L packagename" will list the files in the package
2005-02-21T11:38:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	"dpkg -L bible-kjv", for example
2005-02-21T11:39:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	look for something in /usr/bin
2005-02-21T11:43:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	did you find the application listed in /usr/bin ?
2005-02-21T11:55:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	the name of the file you saw in /usr/bin.  What is it?
2005-02-21T11:56:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	that's the command
2006-06-09T07:36:00.000Z	tritium	ron_	dpkg -i <file.deb>, or use gdebi (gui)
