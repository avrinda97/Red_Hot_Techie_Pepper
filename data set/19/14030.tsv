2004-11-16T07:10:00.000Z	hbbs		hi, I'm newbie to gnome and I wonder how to add starters to the application menu
2004-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	hbbs		I installed xmms and I want to add it to multimediagroup
2004-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	Select the menu that you want to add to, and right-click.  You
2004-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	WW		oops
2004-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	You'll see several editing options.
2004-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	hbbs		I can do a rightclick on an entry in the menu
2004-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	hbbs		i see four options
2004-11-16T07:12:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	Entire menu
2004-11-16T07:12:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	Also, there is an explanation in the wiki FAQ.  Scroll down to "Configuring your desktop" (or something like that).
2004-11-16T07:13:00.000Z	hbbs	WW	i will have a look at it.
2004-11-16T07:14:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	But jdub is right, using Nautilus is pretty easy.
2004-11-16T07:16:00.000Z	hbbs		success ...
2004-11-16T07:16:00.000Z	hbbs		it' a little bit hidden, as you told me
2004-11-16T07:17:00.000Z	hbbs		also the german translations do not improve the whole thing.
2004-11-16T07:17:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	"a little bit hidden..."  What is?
2004-11-16T07:20:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	If you mean the FAQ on the wiki, I agree.  There have been a lot of changes to the wiki recently, and the FAQ seems to have gotten buried deep.
2004-11-16T07:21:00.000Z	hbbs	WW	no, i meant the way like jdub described it (right click and so on ...)
2004-11-16T07:21:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	Oh. That, too.  :)
2004-11-16T07:21:00.000Z	WW	hbbs	Computer->Home is what I usually do.
