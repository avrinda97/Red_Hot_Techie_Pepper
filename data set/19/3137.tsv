2009-10-20T13:20:00.000Z	WackyHyena		is it possible to see a list of recently added applications for ubuntu? like a list of brand new applications that were recently released?
2009-10-20T13:20:00.000Z	WackyHyena		i want to see what new things I can use
2009-10-20T13:21:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	using 9.04 ?
2009-10-20T13:31:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	put ubuntu on it if you want ubuntu, put windows on it if you want windows. pretty easy question.
2009-10-20T13:33:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	no it dosen't. it can use openGL instead.
2009-10-20T13:33:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	in windows, right?
2009-10-20T13:35:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	how does nexiuz run in windows?
2009-10-20T13:36:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	it's kinda bad comparing peformance with 2 different games
2009-10-20T13:36:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	have you confirmed you have drivers working well?
2009-10-20T13:42:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	you should get good peformance in games
2009-10-20T13:44:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	disable compiz when running games
2009-10-20T13:45:00.000Z	WackyHyena	rsk	i'm trying to make compiz make my titlebars slightly blurred like in vista, but that slows down the whole system, even when not running anything else, it's an intel 945GM card
2009-10-20T13:46:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	you were saying before you had an ATI card
2009-10-20T13:46:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	stop confusing me
2009-10-20T13:47:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	intel has a opensource driver that works fairly well
2009-10-20T13:47:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	but the windows one is closed source with some magic linux dosen't have
2009-10-20T13:48:00.000Z	rsk	WackyHyena	Yes it will if you buy nvidia GPU, cpu dosen't matter.
