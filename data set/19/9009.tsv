2007-01-06T11:14:00.000Z	HossBud		Hello
2007-01-06T11:14:00.000Z	HossBud		I've got a problem and I'm not having a lot of luck understanding what I've read on the internet.
2007-01-06T11:15:00.000Z	HossBud		I've installed a firewire hard drive
2007-01-06T11:15:00.000Z	HossBud		and I used Gparted to create a new partition and file system on it
2007-01-06T11:16:00.000Z	HossBud		but when I try to save or read a file on it, it tells me I dont have permission
2007-01-06T11:16:00.000Z	HossBud		and when I get the info on it, it says it belongs to root
2007-01-06T11:17:00.000Z	HossBud		so I dont understand how to take ownership of the drive
2007-01-06T11:18:00.000Z	HossBud		it seems like it should be simple, but I cant figure it out
2007-01-06T11:20:00.000Z	HossBud		anyone?  :)
2007-01-06T11:20:00.000Z	HossBud		I might be doing this wrong
2007-01-06T11:22:00.000Z	riotkittie	HossBud	have you taken a look at your fstab?
2007-01-06T11:23:00.000Z	HossBud		the drive mounts and I can view the contents, but cant read or write
2007-01-06T11:23:00.000Z	HossBud		it shows ownership as root
2007-01-06T11:23:00.000Z	riotkittie		yes but whats the line in your fstab say about it?
2007-01-06T11:24:00.000Z	HossBud		let me check
2007-01-06T11:26:00.000Z	HossBud	riotkittie	it doesn't look like its listed in there
2007-01-06T11:28:00.000Z	riotkittie		what file system is it?
2007-01-06T11:29:00.000Z	riotkittie		ewww. i hate recovery cds.  <cringe>
2007-01-06T11:29:00.000Z	HossBud	riotkittie	the whole drive is ext3...according to Gparted
