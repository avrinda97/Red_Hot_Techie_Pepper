2009-08-05T15:19:00.000Z	ubuntistas	polter	can i install it now? without harming ubuntu?
2009-08-05T15:20:00.000Z	polter	ubuntistas	you should be able to do that, but since it's not in the official repos, I won't give any guarantees.
2009-08-05T15:21:00.000Z	ubuntistas	polter	which is the official repo? and how can i do a dry run? what's that?
2009-08-05T15:21:00.000Z	polter	ubuntistas	if you use "apt-get install kde" you can add "--simulate" at the end of the command to see what would get removed/installed/upgrade without doing the install
2009-08-05T15:24:00.000Z	polter	ubuntistas	have you tried opening up "software sources" in "System->Administration" and enabling "backports"?
2009-08-05T15:25:00.000Z	polter	ubuntistas	I'm just wondering if you have checked that repo for the new KDE packages
