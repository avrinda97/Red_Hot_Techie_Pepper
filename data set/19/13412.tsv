2005-04-06T09:22:00.000Z	SirGrok		Hey, I am a new Ubuntu user (I love it... almost done configuring) and I need help with configuring my sound card (Sound Blaster Audigy 2)
2005-04-06T09:23:00.000Z	SirGrok		My 5.1 isn't working.
2005-04-06T09:24:00.000Z	SirGrok		I don't think that it has loaded the proper drivers..... The sound works, but on 2.1
2005-04-06T09:24:00.000Z	SirGrok		Atleast you are honest.
2005-04-06T09:25:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	you nead to enable a 5.1 plugin
2005-04-06T09:25:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	Where is a 5.1 plugin?
2005-04-06T09:26:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	hang on
2005-04-06T09:26:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	GRACIAS!

2005-04-06T09:30:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	Thanks a lot for the attempt.
2005-06-16T09:35:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-06-16T09:36:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	thanks. I will go try that.
2005-06-27T12:45:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	mc :)
2006-04-08T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	this should help (as root): cd /home; for X in * chown -R $X:$X $X
2006-04-08T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	this should help (as root): cd /home; for X in *; do chown -R $X:$X $X; done
2006-04-08T15:23:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	That looks complicated.. Will try it.
2006-04-08T15:25:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	so type it in exactly like this "cd /home; for X in *; do chown -R $X:$X $X; done" on one line?
2006-04-08T15:25:00.000Z	Seveas	SirGrok	yes
2006-04-08T15:28:00.000Z	SirGrok	Seveas	Thanks. That worked.
