2008-06-02T00:29:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		Hardware Question - I have an Adesso CyberTablet Z12, plugging it in installed WACOM drivers. The tablet is pretty much a mouse, how do I set it up to be more... like a tablet xD (no mention of WACOM in xorg)
2008-06-02T00:29:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	sudo apt-get install wacom-tools
2008-06-02T00:30:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	installed them with the drivers, didn't help
2008-06-02T00:31:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	Which application are you trying to use the tablet in?
2008-06-02T00:31:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	GIMP, or anything pretty much
2008-06-02T00:31:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	Or do you mean that you'd like to be able to press the top-right corner of the tablet to move the cursor to the top-tight corner of the screen?
2008-06-02T00:32:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	yes!
2008-06-02T00:32:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	I think Ubuntu seems to have a bit of a bug with this
2008-06-02T00:32:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	To do that you need to plug it in before Ubuntu boots up
2008-06-02T00:33:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	Then it seems to function correctly
2008-06-02T00:33:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	when i do that, or plug it in after boot, it lists itself under mouse devices
2008-06-02T00:33:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	should it be doing that?
2008-06-02T00:34:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	I'll try plugging mine in, I haven't used it in a while
2008-06-02T00:34:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	is it adesso o.O
2008-06-02T00:36:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	Mine also acts like a mouse and not a tablet
2008-06-02T00:36:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	Let me just check whether it is listed as a mouse device
2008-06-02T00:39:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	It looks like my tablet is stuck as a mouse too :s
2008-06-02T00:39:00.000Z	Goop	D3RGPS31	I'll let you know if I find a fix
2008-06-02T00:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Goop	thank you
