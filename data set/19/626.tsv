2011-11-28T23:00:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	can you do dpkg --get-selections and confirm that Gwibber is uninstalled?
2011-11-28T23:03:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	is there a way to page this list?  cuz it's so long, it fitted only from m to z in the terminal ;)
2011-11-28T23:04:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	no idea on the paging. I am lazy and use Xchat
2011-11-28T23:04:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	nevermind, just adding g* at the end of your command did the job ;)
2011-11-28T23:05:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	you could pipe it to less
2011-11-28T23:06:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	and now I can tell you that dpkg shows "install" next to the four gwibber-service variants, so I assume it's not installed.
2011-11-28T23:06:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	"install" means it's installed
2011-11-28T23:06:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	weird, I know
2011-11-28T23:07:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	ok, so how do I get rid of this thing?  I'm pretty sure I even did a "purge" version of uninstall
2011-11-28T23:07:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	weird, purge should nuke it all from orbit
2011-11-28T23:07:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	oh wait, maybe I removed the app, but not the services (daemons or sth) ?
2011-11-28T23:08:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	try "apt-get uninstall" + paste those gwibber packages
2011-11-28T23:08:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	you can select each one and middle-click to paste them quickly.\
2011-11-28T23:08:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	you probably already know that though. XD
2011-11-28T23:09:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	every time I boot into Windows I middle-click all over the place and go "Why can't I paste anything?"
2011-11-28T23:10:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	r u sure that's the right syntax?  he tells me "invalid operation uninstall".
2011-11-28T23:11:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	my bad, "apt-get remove" or "apt-get purge"
2011-11-28T23:14:00.000Z	EuroNerd	sskalnik	I did apt-get remove gwibber-service*  and it killed this sucker! :)  Thanks a lot for your help.
2011-11-28T23:14:00.000Z	sskalnik	EuroNerd	glad to hear it worked!
