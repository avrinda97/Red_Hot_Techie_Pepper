2006-07-03T10:07:00.000Z	JonathanHarford		I'm trying to get wi-fi working on my laptop -- I've installed ndiswrapper and installed the windows drivers. ndiswrapper -l says "driver present" but not "hardware present" can someone give me a hand?
2006-07-03T10:08:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	What card do you have? Or what chipset does it use?
2006-07-03T10:10:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Check out this tut: http://fedoranews.org/mediawiki/index.php/How_To_Install_Your_Broadcom_BCM4318_Using_Ndiswrapper -- It's for Fedora, but you can easily adapt it to work with Ubuntu :)
2006-07-03T10:11:00.000Z	JonathanHarford	the_t3rminator	- that looks tasty, thanks
2006-07-03T10:12:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	No problem ;)
2006-07-03T10:20:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Hmm.. Driver present? Does "iwconfig" show anything useful?
2006-07-03T10:21:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	It should be working then. Go to System->Administration->Networking and see if you can connect to a WLAN from there
2006-07-03T10:23:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	And then what? Try connecting to a WLAN..
2006-07-03T10:23:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Good... Not go to "Properties" and there should be a listbox to select detected WLANs from
2006-07-03T10:24:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Correct
2006-07-03T10:24:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Is this a laptop or desktop?
2006-07-03T10:25:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Try pressing a button which activates the wireless card. There should be one... Or is your wireless card external (PCMCIA, USB, etc)?
2006-07-03T10:26:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	It probably won't light up... Now look at the list again ;)
2006-07-03T10:27:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	That's odd... Try pressing the button again, but a bit harder? Mine doesn't work if I press it too softly - even if I think I've pressed it..
2006-07-03T10:28:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	I'm not sure how to help... Let's try the terminal?
2006-07-03T10:28:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	Applications->Accessories->Terminal
2006-07-03T10:29:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	sudo ifconfig eth1 down; sudo ifconfig eth1 up
2006-07-03T10:30:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	include the semi-colon
2006-07-03T10:31:00.000Z	the_t3rminator	JonathanHarford	... Did you put the 'sudo' in?
