2008-08-26T12:39:00.000Z	Kernel		hello all. how can i keep track of when a new kernel is released..or major updates like that?
2008-08-26T12:39:00.000Z	Kernel		and is it normal for security.ubuntu.com to be so damn slow when upgrading?
2008-08-26T12:39:00.000Z	Kernel		it keeps timing out on me
2008-08-26T12:40:00.000Z	Kernel		was there a new vuln found?
2008-08-26T12:40:00.000Z	Kernel		stuff like that
2008-08-26T12:40:00.000Z	Kernel		most distros have a list availible
2008-08-26T12:41:00.000Z	Kernel		and ubuntu needs to up there servers lol...i cant even update my kernel because the server is being hit so hard.
2008-08-26T12:41:00.000Z	Kernel		it keeps timing out...or dling at like 10kb/s
2008-08-26T12:42:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	Maybe there's a bandwidth attack on it.... Usually when this kinda stuff happens you might wanna switch to a more localized server and switch back later.
2008-08-26T12:43:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	I hope to god though that it's not another un (or barely) tested kernel update like last time
2008-08-26T12:43:00.000Z	Kernel	Kohlrak	we can only hope lol
2008-08-26T12:43:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	if it's another unstable kernel update i'm gonna friggan switch packages. That hardy heron problems overflow into this room was rediculous.
2008-08-26T12:44:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	unless there's a security update, never update your server if it works XD
2008-08-26T12:46:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	switch the server in synaptic... it's near the repos controls
2008-08-26T12:47:00.000Z	Kernel	Kohlrak	there is more then one security server?
2008-08-26T12:47:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	if you're doing this through some sort of package manager thing, surely there's more than once source server, however some are less updated and some are more updated
2008-08-26T13:15:00.000Z	Kernel	Kohlrak	over ssh?
2008-08-26T13:15:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Kernel	nah, locally.
2008-08-26T13:19:00.000Z	Kernel	Kohlrak	yea i know..its almost 430 am...im not thinking too clearly.
