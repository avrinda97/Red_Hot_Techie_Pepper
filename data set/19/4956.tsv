2008-10-01T22:00:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh		i just did a sudo apt-get update and upgrade
2008-10-01T22:00:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh		and my 8.04 doesnt boot up
2008-10-01T22:00:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	any errors while boot?
2008-10-01T22:00:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh		now. it gave some error after update were downloaded. and then when i give "sudo apt-get" it said "/usr/bin/sudo"some error
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	yes. i ran the debug mode. kernel panic
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	tried to bootup with older kernels available?
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	and my caps lock key keeps blinking. and the install stalls. yes i did try to boot to old kernel. same error.
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	there might be some driver issues on new kernel with your hw
2008-10-01T22:03:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	this upgrade was just downloading firefox thunderbird and some libc6
2008-10-01T22:03:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	libc6 is the important part
2008-10-01T22:03:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	then i think that is what failed. or something. coz my distro was upto date till last week.
2008-10-01T22:04:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	is there a way i can get it back ?
2008-10-01T22:04:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	i am not sure, you need a better diagnosis, you may need to bootup using a live cd, chroot to your current installation and fix something, but i am not sure what to look after
2008-10-01T22:04:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh		ahem..
2008-10-01T22:04:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	once i had serious issues with kernel, i just removed it! but i could get it bakc by magic of chroot
2008-10-01T22:05:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	after all updates were downloaded. and it tried to install. everything stopped working. i mean right click and create a new text file also stopped working. any comand that I run gave an error. even the simple "clear" command
2008-10-01T22:06:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	you may had your / remounted as readonly, based on some errors
2008-10-01T22:06:00.000Z	Ali_ix	AJuOnLiNE|sh	i am noy sure how to troubleshoot kernel panics
2008-10-01T22:06:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Ali_ix	i will try to boot up and come online via the live cd
