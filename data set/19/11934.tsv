2006-10-25T15:07:00.000Z	LjL	root_	know about the "sudo -i" command line?
2006-10-25T15:08:00.000Z	LjL	root_	one never has to "use root all the time". actually, nobody should, especially to join IRC
2006-10-25T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	root_	err, even without sudo, you can still log in as a normal user, and use su... which is what people with sense always did
2006-10-25T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	root_	which is precisely why you should *not* *ever* log into IRC as root.
2006-10-25T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	root_	only in the shell you issued su in.
2006-10-25T15:14:00.000Z	LjL	root_	it shows.
2009-05-08T18:36:00.000Z	LjL	root_	sure. i'll start by telling you: never irc as root.
2010-11-27T02:29:00.000Z	LjL	root_	do you have an Ubuntu support question?
2010-11-27T02:30:00.000Z	LjL	root_	cracking is offtopic
