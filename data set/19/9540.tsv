2007-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	uses the debian menu system
2007-04-04T07:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	/etc/X11/fluxbox/fluxbox-menu
2007-04-04T07:24:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	fluxbox menu needs manually adding
2007-04-04T07:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	read that file _but don't edit it_
2007-04-04T07:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	it contains instructions :)
2007-04-04T07:26:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	i know how to add menus manually, thats what it teaches me " If you read this it means you want to edit this file manually, so here..."
2007-04-04T07:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	but it indicates how the file is autogenerated no?
2007-04-04T07:28:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	not here, sorry i use freebsd, i just wanted to know how ubuntu is doing it :>
2007-04-04T07:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	ah :)
2007-04-04T07:29:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	what is your saying xD
2007-04-04T07:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	I'm sorry I have to go though.
2007-08-23T13:35:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	you can't pipe like that
2007-08-23T13:35:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	the "left" side gets sudo, but the "right" side doesn't.
2007-08-23T13:35:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	jrib thanks
2007-08-29T15:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	what's wrong with firefox?
2007-08-29T15:48:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	the fact that he wants to access many emails  at once
2007-08-29T15:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	xjkx	I don't get why you can't do that?
2007-08-29T15:50:00.000Z	xjkx	PriceChild	its not for me, he has to access many emails of his work, one of the business, other personal, other for something else, other that is owned by where he works, doing it several times wastes time. He needs something that just opens it up
