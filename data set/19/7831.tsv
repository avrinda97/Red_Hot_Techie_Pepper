2007-07-10T12:34:00.000Z	rockets		Do linksys wifi cards work in linux, without ndiswrapper or using the restricted drive manager?
2007-07-10T12:34:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	it depends in the "chipset" not the generic brand name
2007-07-10T12:34:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	ok well can you reccomend one?
2007-07-10T12:35:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	atheros, intel, broadcom,
2007-07-10T12:36:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	broadcom's NEVER work natively!
2007-07-10T12:36:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	they always need ndiswrapper
2007-07-10T12:37:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	mmm... no you are wrong. Broadcom work, but not at full 54 Mbps, they may work okay at 11Mbps
2007-07-10T12:37:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	incorrect. I have a bc card. You either need ndiswrapper or you need to use fw-cutter/wl-apasta, which work really poorly
2007-07-10T12:37:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	they definitely aren't plug and play
2007-07-10T12:41:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	well I've talked to numerous broadcom users, and there is the bcm43xx module so I recommend it, but I don't own one so I don't know from personal experience.
2007-07-10T12:43:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	yes the bcm43xx module doesnt work without he firmware
2007-07-10T12:44:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	obviously, but that is the point to use both the firmware and the module, so it may not be such a big complication after all.
2007-07-10T12:44:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	right but the firmware isnt included. i.e. its not just plug it in and it works
2007-07-10T12:46:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	mmm... Is bcm43xx-fwcutter included in the CD?
2007-07-10T12:46:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	for my wifi card? No. Its built into my laptop. And it doesnt matter. This isnt about my card!
2007-07-10T12:47:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	mhz` we are going loony!
2007-07-10T12:49:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	the cd for what? My wifi card?
2007-07-10T12:49:00.000Z	vox754	rockets	mhz` the UBUNTU CD aaaargh
2007-07-10T12:49:00.000Z	rockets	vox754	oh. Not sure but I dont think so
