2008-08-11T15:56:00.000Z	Dazed		Could not load the Host USB Proxy Service (VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND). The service might be not installed on the host computer.
2008-08-11T15:56:00.000Z	Dazed		not a big deal, but if i wanted usb in my vbox, could that be fixed?
2008-08-11T15:57:00.000Z	Dazed		get nividia if you wanna use linux
2008-08-11T15:58:00.000Z	Dazed		my ati card works fine but the catalyst control center for linux has much less options
2008-08-11T15:58:00.000Z	Dazed		and no support for fan speed control exists anywhere
2008-08-11T15:59:00.000Z	Dazed		thats great.. but.. my card is retarded.. the fan stays at 5% until it hits 90c
2008-08-11T15:59:00.000Z	Dazed		then it goes to 100
2008-08-11T15:59:00.000Z	Dazed		in wondows i used ati tray tools to set it up more logically
2008-08-11T15:59:00.000Z	Dazed		in linux im screwed
2008-08-11T16:00:00.000Z	Dazed		nvidia is definitely the safer bet if you want to be on linux right now
2008-08-11T16:00:00.000Z	Tonehog	Dazed	I'm sure the driver has options to set the fan responsibility settings
2008-08-11T16:00:00.000Z	Dazed		if you google ati and linux there's a zillion pages of unhappy people
2008-08-11T16:01:00.000Z	Dazed		it doesnt tonehog
2008-08-11T16:01:00.000Z	Dazed		that would be logical
2008-08-11T16:01:00.000Z	Tonehog	Dazed	tried 'modinfo' for the ATI driver?
2008-08-11T16:01:00.000Z	Dazed		no
2008-08-11T16:02:00.000Z	Dazed		have you?
2008-08-11T16:05:00.000Z	Dazed		tonehog: Still there?
2008-08-11T16:05:00.000Z	Dazed	Tonehog	How would I check that modinfo? What's the syntax
