2007-01-21T09:58:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	are you back you seemed to have dissapeared
2007-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	are you there
2007-01-21T10:05:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	i could edit the file in question if I could make it not read only.  It seems ubuntu is set up to prevent my kids (and me) from messing up the computer.
2007-01-21T10:05:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	how considerate of it. you use sudo beforehand
2007-01-21T10:15:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	 mount didn't work but maybe it's the editor i used for fstab... i used gedit
2007-01-21T10:15:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	what happened when you used mount?
2007-01-21T10:16:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	i got can't find in fstab
2007-01-21T10:17:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	refresh my memory...when you used mkfs.ext3 - you did it for /dev/hdb right?
2007-01-21T10:19:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	cmd "ls /dev/hdb"
2007-01-21T10:21:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	edit fstab again: "/dev/hdb       / hardrive              ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
2007-01-21T10:23:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	and if that doesn't work...i want you to find a REALLY big sledge hammer, or preferably an ax....
2007-01-21T10:30:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	Im gitten excited... mount gave no error and hardrive has a folder called lost+found....but it says i don't have permission to view the contents
2007-01-21T10:33:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	home stretch, eh? o.k....you have to go BACK into fstab now and edit so it looks like... /dev/hdb  /hardrive  auto    umask=002,dmask=002,fmask=002,gid=46,rw,sync,user,noauto,iocharset=utf8,codepage=850,defaults,errors=remount-rw   0      1
2007-01-21T10:35:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	i kind of followed you there. so you rewrote the permission so you access lost+found?
2007-01-21T10:37:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	yes. or at least, it _should_ be. chmod 777 can be a dangerous command in some cases. permissions are set up to protect your system.
2007-01-21T10:38:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	you still have to reset fstab when this is all done with. good luck.
2007-01-21T10:40:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	sorry - i meant setting the persmissions back to the way they were. o.k. - umount the hard drive and then remoutn it o.k.?
2007-01-21T10:41:00.000Z	iuui	gibbonsfire4	sorry :) ....umount /hardrive
2007-01-21T10:42:00.000Z	gibbonsfire4	iuui	done what now
