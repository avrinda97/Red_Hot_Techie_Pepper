2010-08-05T14:39:00.000Z	alsem	PythonPup	 Not sure how long "a while is"  It is 2:20am here so probably not very long.  If you wish you can send it to my eMail  at  alsemus@yahoo.com
2010-08-05T14:40:00.000Z	PythonPup	alsem	It is 4:40am here.  You need to add a whole section at the bottom of the file.  I have that at home, and not here.  If you are still here, I'll post it to you when I get home.  It will take about 45 minutes.
