2008-09-02T17:08:00.000Z	sevensun		Hello guys. I need to recover some files from my broken-windows laptop so I booted using the xubuntu live cd. In which folder should I search for the windows files??
2008-09-02T17:09:00.000Z	sevensun		please guys, my boss is gonna cut my head out T_T
2008-09-02T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	mount the window partition first
2008-09-02T17:10:00.000Z	sevensun	jrib	what do you mean to mount?
2008-09-02T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	pastebin the output of the following commands two commands: mount && sudo fdisk -l
2008-09-02T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	do you understand what you need to do?
2008-09-02T17:13:00.000Z	sevensun	jrib	not really, i don't understand if pastebin is a command or the name of something
2008-09-02T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	it's a website.  paste.ubuntu.com go there and paste the output of the commands: mount && sudo fdisk -l
2008-09-02T17:15:00.000Z	sevensun	jrib	so I should type "mount && sudo fdisk -l" in the shell and then paste to paste.ubuntu.com what i get from the shell?
2008-09-02T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	yes, and then give us the url
2008-09-02T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	run this and type what you see: mount | grep /media
2008-09-02T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	for f in sda1 sda2 sda5; do sudo mkdir /media/$f && sudo mount /dev/$f /media/$f; done
2008-09-02T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	you didn't copy everything
2008-09-02T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	just do: sudo mkdir /media/sda1; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1     and do the same for sda5
2008-09-02T17:41:00.000Z	sevensun	jrib	ok looks easier now, let me try
2008-09-02T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	it means it wasn't shutdown correctly
2008-09-02T17:51:00.000Z	sevensun	jrib	so what
2008-09-02T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	so you have to do one of the things it says (there's an option to force)
2008-09-02T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	sevensun	google the error, there may be better ways
