2008-01-21T20:02:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	you can't do that
2008-01-21T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	if you don't know something - please don't say it
2008-01-21T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	remove them from the plugin dir in your home dir
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	cubesis	ikonia	i don't see anything like that in my HOME folder
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	~/.mozilla/plugins
2008-01-21T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	what are you talking about ?
2008-01-21T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	how can you be asking which works best when your advising people to not use it ?
2008-01-21T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	so as before "if you don't know something - please don't say it"
2008-01-21T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	cubesis	64bit will perform better with software with high memory usage or software that is multithreaded and able to use the longer registers
