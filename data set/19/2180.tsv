2011-04-10T16:12:00.000Z	madurax86		hello im installing ubuntu 10.10 on a rather old celeron, the installation goes on great but on boot it doesnt load up gui
2011-04-10T16:13:00.000Z	madurax86		what can i do to get it to use default video config?
2011-04-10T16:13:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	unless you created an xorg.conf it should be doing that already
2011-04-10T16:14:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	nope i didnt make a xorg.conf
2011-04-10T16:18:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	how to let it work like it worked in the installation?
2011-04-10T16:19:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	im getting this your cpu doesnt have security..bla bla the no execute thing does it affect this?
2011-04-10T16:19:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	dunno, what did you do to make it act any other way?
2011-04-10T16:19:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	no
2011-04-10T16:20:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	dont know just after installing it just says it cant load up x, the log says there are screens but no usable config
2011-04-10T16:21:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	are you using an s3 or via video card?
2011-04-10T16:22:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	yes
2011-04-10T16:22:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	thats tough, they have among the worst & ill supported drivers :[ though ubuntu should try at least to use vesa before it gives up, i dunno what to tell you
2011-04-10T16:23:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	the installation and live session works flawlessly
2011-04-10T16:23:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	how to set vesa?
2011-04-10T16:24:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	i do not know, sorry
2011-04-10T16:25:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	though i suggest filing a bug if the livecd works but the install doesn't
2011-04-10T16:25:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	hmm isnt both systems the same?
2011-04-10T16:26:00.000Z	ohsix	madurax86	nope, and i don't know what tricks the livecd might be doing, they are very close to the same though
2011-04-10T16:27:00.000Z	madurax86	ohsix	ok
