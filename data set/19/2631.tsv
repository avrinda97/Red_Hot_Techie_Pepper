2010-09-11T12:02:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	I know about it. I checked it properly and ping in subnet works fine but not ping through the gateway
2010-09-11T12:05:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	if you have multiple subnets worth you'll need to make sure that one system is used as the wins server and then use dhcp or whatever to set that system as the wins server for all the systems involved
2010-09-11T12:06:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	Actually I'm trying to set network in a class in a university.
2010-09-11T12:08:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	the network (eth1(DHCP+ windows WINs)  -->Ubuntu(DHCP Realy, samba WINS) --> class
2010-09-11T12:09:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	i take it they don't have a wins server that you can just point at
2010-09-11T12:10:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	class is located on interface eth0. And I have access from eth1 to eth0 fully, but in eth0 network I can see only workgroups in eth1 and ping by IP.
2010-09-11T12:11:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	firstly, make sure that the ubuntu system in the middle can lookup by name using nmblookup, and you have it set with wins support = yes as you've said
2010-09-11T12:11:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	you'll need to make it so that the dhcp relay adds on a parameter so that the systems behind it use it as a wins server
2010-09-11T12:12:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	ubuntu can look all. and "wins support = yes" was set too.
2010-09-11T12:12:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	yeah, so the ubuntu box is acting as a wins server, but the rest of the systems don't technically know that
2010-09-11T12:13:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	dhcp3-relay didn't work for me (I don't know why) I use dhcp-helper. I can't change dhcp info
2010-09-11T12:14:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	may be you are right. I heard that Samba WINs and Windows Wins are not compatibe
2010-09-11T12:15:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	the only problem is that at the moment, if you go to one of the windows systems and type ipconfig /all in a command prompt, it will not have a WINS server listed
2010-09-11T12:16:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	you need to find some way of setting that appropriately
2010-09-11T12:17:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	either by overriding it on each system individually or by having the relay change the dhcp parameters to add the WINS server
2010-09-11T12:18:00.000Z	quiescens	besogon	possibly other ways too, but those are the ones I can think of off-hand
2010-09-11T12:20:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	In eth0 (internal network) I set WIN server to ubuntu IP address. I didn't help me.
2010-09-11T12:20:00.000Z	besogon	quiescens	It didn't help me. *
