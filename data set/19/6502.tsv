2008-08-27T16:18:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	I'm thinking about an alternate-cd not a live cd
2008-08-27T16:18:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	we speak of really slow computers here :)
2008-08-27T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OculusAquilae	i have slow computers
2008-08-27T16:22:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	Should be used as E-Mail terminals in Africa near Kilimanjaro
2008-08-27T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OculusAquilae	you dont need a ferrari to drive to the shops and back
2008-08-27T16:24:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	???
2008-08-27T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OculusAquilae	email is very light on the system so you can get away with a 40Mhz cou and 256mb ram
2008-08-27T16:25:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	I know
2008-08-27T16:25:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	128 MB of ram is what I think of
2008-08-27T16:27:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	I want to have less possablity for the user to destroy something, internet is paid from germany and very expensive because it is done via gprs
2008-08-27T16:28:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	ubuntu has an excellent hardware support and apt-get is best suited for this task I think
2008-08-27T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OculusAquilae	if you know how to apt-get it right, go ahead :)
2008-08-27T16:29:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	I want to have a special install-cd, so the installation can be done there by some people I advise in germany. they don't have so much knowledge about linux
2008-08-27T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OculusAquilae	hmmm, a VERY tall order
2008-08-27T16:31:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	perhaps I could start with a xubuntu-alternate-cd only installing needed packages (sylpheed for example) and then remove packages, but I would ask for a simplier alterative
2008-08-27T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OculusAquilae	you could always have them set it up then ask their IT to port forward so you can ssh over
2008-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	OculusAquilae	ActionParsnip	ok, I will start now,, thanks
