2010-11-23T16:25:00.000Z	shmup		i cannot figure out why it's telling it's removing leading.. etc
2010-11-23T16:26:00.000Z	shmup		oh rofl
2010-11-23T16:27:00.000Z	shmup		told the guy who is helping me and he says that isn't it
2010-11-23T16:27:00.000Z	shmup		would there be any other possibilities?
2010-11-23T16:28:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	what's your problem?
2010-11-23T16:29:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	it's telling you removing leading / because it's a very bad idea to store absolute pathnames in a tar archive
2010-11-23T16:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	yes.  That message should be considered normal and expected
2010-11-23T16:31:00.000Z	shmup	ectospasm	i'm not storing, though. am i? i mean..
2010-11-23T16:32:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	yes, if you type tar -tvzf worldbackup.tar.gz, you'll see home/shmup... as the leading pathnames
2010-11-23T16:45:00.000Z	shmup	ectospasm	you're on a roll tonight with answers. i have one more question. if i wanted to rename, or even initially name a file i'm creating with the date.
2010-11-23T16:45:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	what, you want the date in the filename?
2010-11-23T16:46:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	tar -cvjf filename-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.bz2 /path/to/archive/contents
2010-11-23T16:46:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	see "man date" for formatting options
2010-11-23T16:47:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	yes
2010-11-23T16:52:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	watch out for spaces
2010-11-23T16:52:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	or colons
2010-11-23T16:56:00.000Z	ectospasm	shmup	%T has spaces in it, no?
2010-11-23T16:57:00.000Z	shmup	ectospasm	it does. the only reason i thought something was wrong is that %H wasnt working. it was, though. typo. ._. thanks.
