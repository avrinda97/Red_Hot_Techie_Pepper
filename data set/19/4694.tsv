2012-04-04T21:45:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	Anon7: Mordy: No. Just use apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
2012-04-04T21:45:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	he wants a fresh install
2012-04-04T21:45:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	read again: <Mordy> hello can someone tell how to replace lubuntu with ubuntu? and I also have dual boot
2012-09-28T23:10:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	On a SIS graphics adapter? No :)
2012-11-01T04:00:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	was, he said he is not running that kernel
2012-11-01T04:01:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	Then how can we investigate what is causing that error...?
2012-11-01T04:01:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	reading the logs, it should say what process was this
2012-11-01T04:01:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	at least that's what a bit of googling shows
2012-11-01T04:05:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	PID 92
2012-11-01T04:05:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	PID 92 is udevd
2012-11-01T04:10:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	what's the current kernel in 12.04?
2012-11-01T04:11:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	No 12.04 handy here, maybe you can take alook at packages.ubuntu.com
2012-11-01T04:11:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	why do you say it will not upgrade the kernel?
2012-11-01T04:12:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	Because thats the truth. apt-get will keep back kernel packages. You have to update them explicitely.
2012-11-01T04:13:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	dist-upgrade does that for you
2012-11-01T04:14:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	Yes, and we were talking about apt-get upgrade ;)
2012-11-01T04:15:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	Nope, it isnt.
2012-11-01T04:16:00.000Z	pepee	bekks	I was talking about upgrade, generically. I always use dist-upgrade, so I don't know much about other package managers
2012-11-01T05:23:00.000Z	bekks	pepee	That will not help at all, because / is full, not /home
