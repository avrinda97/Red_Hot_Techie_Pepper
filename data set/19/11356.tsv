2006-02-22T09:31:00.000Z	Seveas	bliss	I think that looks alright
2006-02-22T09:32:00.000Z	bliss	Seveas	how can I check if anything is blocking port 22 --my isp is not
2006-02-22T09:33:00.000Z	Seveas	bliss	did you mess with any kind of firewall on your machine? If not, then it's your router 
2006-02-22T09:35:00.000Z	bliss	Seveas	there is a firewall but I notice that on boot up its not configured so IT does not start --but is there way of checking if 22 is being blocked
2006-02-22T09:35:00.000Z	Seveas	bliss	iptables -L
2006-02-22T09:40:00.000Z	bliss	Seveas	I have pasted it in pastbin ---nothing showing as far as I can see
