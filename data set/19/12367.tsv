2007-02-25T14:54:00.000Z	oggy		I dont understand how automatix can disappear out of no where
2007-02-25T14:54:00.000Z	oggy		just when I was getting ubuntu setup
2007-02-25T14:55:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	Automatix is a great way to break your system
2007-02-25T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	download the .deb from the website, and install it by doubleclicking on it
2007-02-25T14:59:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	I have no idea.  google says it's at getswiftfox.com
2007-02-25T14:59:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	but, it appears to be down at the moment
2007-02-25T15:00:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	firefox is installed
2007-02-25T15:02:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	no.  But neither does swiftfox
2007-02-25T15:02:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	oh.
2007-02-25T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	See that on instruction.  You should've said this at the beginning.  You're looking for a whole different set of answers.
2007-02-25T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	yes.  And you would for swiftfox too.
2007-02-25T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	actually, you can't for swiftfox.  Because the deb would be 32bit.
2007-02-25T15:05:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	What are you talking about?  There's a binary driver released for 64bit only?  Which one?
2007-02-25T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	64bit and 32bit ubuntu are virtually identical.  Except in 64bit you can't use the binary-only drivers 32bit has
2007-02-26T16:13:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	no.  Don't use sudo su.  If you want a root shell, sudo -i
2007-02-26T16:18:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	./linux-installer.sh  (the current directory isn't in the path)
2007-02-26T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	or you might have to do `bash linux-installer.sh`
2007-03-13T08:01:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	#ubuntu-effects for beryl support
2007-03-14T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	oggy	#ubuntu-effects for beryl too
