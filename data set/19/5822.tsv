2008-04-29T12:38:00.000Z	blackperl		is there a difference between using a swap partition /dev/sda3 or using swap file, /mnt/myswap/somefile.swap ?
2008-04-29T12:38:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	same technique
2008-04-29T12:38:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	a partition is more straight forward to manage
2008-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	blackperl	ikonia	i only get 4 primary, i can save one primary, i don't like extended logic paritions
2008-04-29T12:40:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	I'd advise you to use a swap partition if you need swap
2008-04-29T12:40:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	keep in mind that to use a swap file the OS MUST be mounted AND have a read/write file system available
2008-04-29T12:40:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	hence why a native partition is better
2008-04-29T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	what video card is it
2008-04-29T12:44:00.000Z	blackperl	ikonia	onboard =)
2008-04-29T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	what model
2008-04-29T12:45:00.000Z	blackperl	ikonia	the mother board is asus
2008-04-29T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	thats not what I asked, what model
2008-04-29T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	what make/model chipset
2008-04-29T12:46:00.000Z	blackperl	ikonia	are you serious? why keep asking, it's working now =)
2008-04-29T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	yes, I'm serious
2008-04-29T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	if you wish to drop it move on, thats find
2008-04-29T12:49:00.000Z	blackperl	ikonia	i might need to delete swap again and use extended partition. i just used up my last, 4th primary
2008-04-29T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	blackperl	there is no problem with an extended partition
2008-04-29T12:50:00.000Z	blackperl	ikonia	numbering throws me off, /sda5 is the 2nd parttions sometimes,
