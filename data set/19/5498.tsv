2008-06-21T08:02:00.000Z	mynetdude		:P
2008-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	mynetdude		bluetooth mouse are nice but are spendy
2008-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	mynetdude		I have one, the nice thing about BT is no extra parts needed like a dongle or adapter
2008-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	mynetdude		I would actually prefer BT over USB for keyboard/mice but they are horibbly expensive
2008-06-21T08:05:00.000Z	mynetdude		orly? didn't know it can interfere
2008-06-21T08:06:00.000Z	mynetdude		for BT all you need is to pair it up if its built into your PC/laptop
2008-06-21T08:08:00.000Z	mynetdude		oh, err my bad yes I do... the usb bluetooth dongle
2008-06-21T08:08:00.000Z	mynetdude		I have the old bluetooth 1.0 dongle still
2008-06-21T08:09:00.000Z	Herissy	mynetdude	: yeah they do.
2008-06-23T04:13:00.000Z	mynetdude	Herissy	my wifi card worked out of the box too... but a day after it did I started having problems... now it works fine I didn't have to fix it
2008-06-23T04:14:00.000Z	Herissy	mynetdude	I never had a problem with mine, the problem I had was with the gnome keyring forgetting my passwords to my connections.
2008-06-23T04:16:00.000Z	mynetdude	Herissy	from what I read it is already included thus installed
2008-06-23T04:16:00.000Z	mynetdude	Herissy	that would be for Hardy Heron
2008-06-23T04:16:00.000Z	Herissy	mynetdude	its not here. but my base install was originally kubuntu.
2008-06-23T04:17:00.000Z	mynetdude	Herissy	that could be why, but you can easily get vino if u really wanted
2008-06-23T04:18:00.000Z	Herissy	mynetdude	ok same question as asked earlier : what is vino? something like good old pico?
2008-06-23T06:54:00.000Z	mynetdude	Herissy	no it doesn't, but the user can
2008-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	mynetdude	Herissy	right
