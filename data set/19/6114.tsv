2008-03-11T00:01:00.000Z	StefanW		NTFS or FAT32
2008-03-11T00:02:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	i have a free space of fat32 but xp says not recognized
2008-03-11T00:03:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	explain a little more, you mean you made a partition in empty space?
2008-03-11T00:03:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	yeap total of 6 + gb more empty
2008-03-11T00:04:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	fat32 partitions should be recognized by the windows XP installer
2008-03-11T00:05:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	you can always try to make the partition NTFS in stead of FAT32 :)
2008-03-11T00:05:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	well i deleted the partition and said raw risk still says not recognizable
2008-03-11T00:06:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	ok, hang on... what are you doing
2008-03-11T00:06:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	you are trying to install windows XP to a new partition?
2008-03-11T00:06:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	so i resized my big hd to make 6 gb free space for xp with gparted and i assigned it as fat32
2008-03-11T00:07:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	and the windows installer can't recognize the partition?
2008-03-11T00:07:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	yes in empty partition, yes did not recognize i think it wants me to delete all the partition
2008-03-11T00:08:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	you should not have to
2008-03-11T00:08:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	what you can try it let the windows XP installer create a partition in the empty space
2008-03-11T00:08:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	how do i check if my drives are mouted or not?
2008-03-11T00:09:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	mounted?... how are you trying to install XP? directly from linux? O_o
2008-03-11T00:10:00.000Z	bengalkid	StefanW	i am on live cd right now
2008-03-11T00:11:00.000Z	StefanW	bengalkid	then remove the partition you made, leave empty space, reboot the system, boot with the windows XP install cd and let it create a partition inside the empty space
