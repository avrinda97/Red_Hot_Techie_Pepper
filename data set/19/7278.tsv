2007-09-17T13:35:00.000Z	jamison		trying to configure samba... is there a GUI?
2007-09-17T13:37:00.000Z	jamison		its enabled -- how do i restart it?
2007-09-17T13:38:00.000Z	jamison		how do i restart xinetd?
2007-09-17T13:38:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	/etc/init.d/xinetd restart
2007-09-17T13:43:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	what ubuntu version?
2007-09-17T13:51:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	ctrl shift c and ctrl shift p copy paste in terminal
2007-09-17T13:52:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	it copys when selecting, pastes when you click the scroll wheel, otherwise use ctrl shift c and ctrl shift v
2007-09-17T13:53:00.000Z	jamison	tvrg	diff. between ctrl+v and ctrl+shift+v?
2007-09-17T13:53:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	terminal often has other shortcuts mapped to ctrl c, so you need to use ctrl shif c to copy in a terminal, and ctrl shift p to pste in a terminal, in the other apps you can use regular ctrl v
2007-09-17T13:54:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	in terminal you just need ctrl shift instead of ctrl, to avoid colliding with other commands
2007-09-17T13:54:00.000Z	jamison	tvrg	rlount: i'm familiar with PuTTY in XP, where you can paste with right-click and copy just by selecting text... does Terminal do this, or can i configure it to, or is there another app, or maybe even PuTTY for linux?
2007-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	yes, you can still right click
2007-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	jamison	tvrg	i mean right-click literally pasted, it didn't bring up a menu
2007-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	ah, k, been a while since i needed putty
2007-09-17T13:56:00.000Z	jamison	tvrg	rlount: i see i can config. hotkeys for ctrl+c ctrl+v... that gets me half way
2007-09-17T13:57:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	i'd use the ctrl shift shortcut, remapping it to ctrl c and ctrl v might collide with other stuff
2007-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	who knows you might end up liking vi or something :)
2007-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	jamison	tvrg	i like vim :)
2007-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	tvrg	jamison	then don't mess with the default shortcuts: )
