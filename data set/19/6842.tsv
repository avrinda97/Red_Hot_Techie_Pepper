2007-11-29T21:08:00.000Z	damidalla		here on Ubuntu 7.10 I have nautilus freezing everytime I open it from terminal, panel/menu and/or I try to delete a file. Obviously, no error reported
2007-11-29T21:09:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	check your /var/log files, they maybe recording errors?
2007-11-29T21:11:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	I looked for "something" on /var/log, but I did not find anything particular... Is there a particular file I should look into?
2007-11-29T21:12:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	check the time stamps, and look at the ones that match with the time of your problems.
2007-11-29T21:21:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	nothing particular in /var/log, only the usual "unknown key pressed"
2007-11-29T21:22:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	what file was that in?
2007-11-29T21:23:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	kern.log, syslog, messages
2007-11-29T21:23:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	all three of them!?
2007-11-29T21:24:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	yes
2007-11-29T21:24:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	it's an usual pattern for me, from ubuntu 5.10, using italian keyboard
2007-11-29T21:25:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	what are you running now, how did you upgrade form 5.10?
2007-11-29T21:25:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	I am running a "fresh" install of 7.10
2007-11-29T21:26:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	how did you upgrade form 5.10?
2007-11-29T21:26:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	I was only saying I have always seen that error, also when I was using 5.10, 6.06, 6.10, 7.04... same old story
2007-11-29T21:28:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	ok so you followed the upgrade path, good. And this problem goes all the way back to 5.10? Have you looked for bug reports/fixes? If not, I would file a bug report.
2007-11-29T21:30:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	no, that problem goes back only 4 days, on that 7.10, not upgraded from 7.04. The only things that goes back to 5.10, not showing any problem, is the error message saying "unknown key code" or someting similar
2007-11-29T21:31:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	 hmm, i don't know what to tell you, I'm running Dapper 6.06.
2007-11-29T21:32:00.000Z	damidalla	n2diy	ok, thank you for your time... now I am trying purging nautilus and seeing what does it happen when I reinstall it...
2007-11-29T21:33:00.000Z	n2diy	damidalla	 good luck.
