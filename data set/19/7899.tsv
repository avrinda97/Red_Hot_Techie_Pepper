2011-01-31T08:53:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	you can alt right click and drag conky around
2011-01-31T08:54:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	not really... is setted as somewhat part of the background not as a windows
2011-01-31T08:54:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	i drag mine around.
2011-01-31T08:55:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	well, trust me i'm trying but it wont move :p
2011-01-31T08:56:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	pastebin your .conkyrc
2011-01-31T08:57:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	one sec
2011-01-31T09:00:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	http://pastebin.com/WnmgV4Yi there you go
2011-01-31T09:05:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	i see, you have the whole screen using conky.. that looks horrible :(
2011-01-31T09:07:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	and no wonder.. it is seeing the top of the screen as the height of the 2nd since it is taller.
2011-01-31T09:11:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	...likes or dislikes it was the first .conky i've liked :p
2011-01-31T09:11:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	line 73 add a comment.  #alignment top_left then uncomment line 75.. alignment bottom_left .. that should get it back down
2011-01-31T09:14:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	that's more like it but i'll have to modify the rest of it as now i've got and inch of free space up :p
2011-01-31T09:15:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	when this started happening i considered switching to some less invasive horizontal bar at the top
2011-01-31T09:16:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	line 340 add a few more empty lines. that should raise the right text
2011-01-31T09:18:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	getting a better .conkyrc would be a better idea.. why you are interested in seeing /var/log/messages on the desktop is a mystery to me.
2011-01-31T09:19:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	well for a while it was kinda fun... it came with the script, now i rarely pay atention to it except when i plug in my 3g modem lol :p
2011-01-31T09:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=110535  look there for some sample .conkyrc's and screenshots of them.
2011-01-31T09:43:00.000Z	julio_	bastidrazor	well i'm very thanked by now... it's kinda late here so i'll better leave. Thanks again for your time
2011-01-31T09:44:00.000Z	bastidrazor	julio_	best of luck on finding a good .conkyrc.. come back and share when you find a decent one.
