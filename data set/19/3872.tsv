2009-05-16T19:52:00.000Z	she_dyed	mythril	you have the right driver for the mouse, is it a regular mouse?
2009-05-16T19:53:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	touchpad, been working fine for nearly 2 years, this is a recent development
2009-05-16T19:53:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	as in the last 6 hours or so
2009-05-16T19:53:00.000Z	she_dyed		does a reboot square it away, what was the latest thing you've installed mythril
2009-05-16T19:54:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	last thing I installed was a recent update to the chromium development preview
2009-05-16T19:54:00.000Z	she_dyed		and did you just play it full screen mythril
2009-05-16T19:54:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	don't know how that could've had an effect tho
2009-05-16T19:55:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	not the game, the browser
2009-05-16T19:55:00.000Z	she_dyed		does it do mouse gestures mythril
2009-05-16T19:56:00.000Z	mythril		chromium
2009-05-16T19:56:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	chromium?
2009-05-16T19:56:00.000Z	she_dyed		yes mythril
2009-05-16T19:56:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	I have rebooted since I last ran chromium
2009-05-16T19:56:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	and the problem has shown up since then
2009-05-16T19:57:00.000Z	she_dyed		does it do mouse gestures like the other browsers mythril
2009-05-16T19:57:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	doubt it
2009-05-16T19:58:00.000Z	mythril	she_dyed	Either way I haven't ran it on this boot
