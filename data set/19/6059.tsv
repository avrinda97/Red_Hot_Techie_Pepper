2011-01-28T22:22:00.000Z	Araneidae	erUSUL	I'm trying to port a Python module that works on RHEL5
2011-01-28T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Araneidae	i do not think it would be any different in any modern distro; it is not just ubuntu
2011-04-20T14:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Araneidae	dig? nslookup?
2011-04-20T15:05:00.000Z	Araneidae	erUSUL	I though dig was a dns only tool.  WIll try nslookup
2011-04-20T15:06:00.000Z	Araneidae	erUSUL	no, they both seem to go straight to DNS (unless there's some command line option I haven't looked for yet)
