2008-05-22T23:54:00.000Z	Ch1gg1n5		is there a way to change the grub boot loader, so my windows xp boots first?
2008-05-22T23:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	yes edit menu.lst
2008-05-22T23:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	You can move windows to the first entry or set the default os flag
2008-05-22T23:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /boot/grub/menu.lst | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)  and we can help you better
2008-05-22T23:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	Let me post my menu.lst as an example
2008-05-22T23:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	http://paste.stgraber.org/4208
2008-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	You see my menu right
2008-05-23T00:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	see line 14
2008-05-23T00:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	You can also do what legend2440 suggests
2008-05-23T00:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	np..  let me edit mine to have windows boot first to give you a reference as to how to do it
2008-05-23T00:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	http://paste.stgraber.org/4209  is one way
2008-05-23T00:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	the other would be to make line 14 default to 4
2008-05-23T00:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	Yes...
2008-05-23T00:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	Always more than one way to skin the cat..
2008-05-23T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	No good ones come to mind
2008-05-23T00:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	Linux quick start or specifically ubuntu
2008-05-23T00:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ch1gg1n5	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Training     but it is kinda basic..
