2009-06-12T02:50:00.000Z	jimmyjh	cabrey	 i only got 1 issue with 64 bit,,, the flash 64 bit is still funky :P
2009-06-12T02:51:00.000Z	cabrey	jimmyjh	i assume you have the 64 bit alpha?
2009-06-12T02:52:00.000Z	jimmyjh	cabrey	 i used 64 bit alot but the issue is when for example open up firefox, "firefox" and then open another firefox window and open up another flash video half the time the video blacks out and reloading firefox does the trick
