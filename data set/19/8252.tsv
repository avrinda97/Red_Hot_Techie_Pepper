2009-05-01T19:51:00.000Z	jmworx		Did Jaunty remove support for virtual consoles (Ctrl-Alt-F[1-6]) or is that a bug?
2009-05-01T19:52:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	its a bug, for me i have to press ctrl+alt+f1 twice before it gets me to vt
2009-05-01T19:52:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	Let's see if it works...
2009-05-01T19:53:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	Doesn't work. The first time I hit Ctrl-Alt-F1, I get the X console again. After that, it's just a blank screen
2009-05-01T19:53:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	file a bug
2009-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	Yeah, I've heard that before. No longer bothering to. Sorry.
2009-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/consolekit/+bug/271962 at least confirm it
2009-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	Seems like what I have is different from the LP link. I have not been able to see a text console *at all* since I "upgraded" to Jaunty
2009-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	what video card do you have?
2009-05-01T19:57:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	Intel
2009-05-01T19:57:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	which chipset? did u enable dri2 and UXA acceleration?
2009-05-01T19:57:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	How do you check that again?
2009-05-01T19:58:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	lspci | grep VGA
2009-05-01T19:58:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82G35 Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
2009-05-01T19:58:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	right, no special customizations?
2009-05-01T19:58:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	no. The only thing vaguely special is the dual monitor, but it worked with Intrepid IIRC
2009-05-01T19:59:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	hm, i've seen something similar to your issues on an ati card. but intel worked fine for me.
2009-05-01T20:00:00.000Z	jmworx	usser	FWIW the Intel driver is broken differently on my other machine -- dri enabled and yet 3D goes at software rendering speed
2009-05-01T20:01:00.000Z	usser	jmworx	intel released new driver for jaunty, it breaks some cards.
