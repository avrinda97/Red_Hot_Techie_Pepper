2005-03-25T09:37:00.000Z	skora		howdy. I'm having a problem listening to my music cd's on ubuntu.
2005-03-25T09:38:00.000Z	skora		I know its not the speakers, i can hear sound when I play sounds that are locally on the hard drive.
2005-03-25T09:38:00.000Z	skora		or the volume either.
2005-03-25T09:39:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	what application are you using to play CDs?
2005-03-25T09:39:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	also, warty or hoary?
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	skora	crimsun	4.10, tried xmms and cd player.
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	skora		when i try to open up the cd in nautilus, i receive this error message:
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	skora		mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdd,
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	skora		       or too many mounted file systems
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	more than likely it's a volume slider that needs to be unmuted
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	you don't "mount" audio CDs
2005-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	skora		i have no probs with data cd's on the cd dirve.
2005-03-25T09:41:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	In the Volume Control, are you using the ALSA mixer or the OSS mixer?
2005-03-25T09:41:00.000Z	skora	crimsun	sorry, but how would i find that out.
2005-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	open up Volume Control
2005-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	skora		k
2005-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	skora		im there.
2005-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	skora		and both the OSS mixer and the alsa mixer is there.
2005-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	crimsun	skora	ok, choose the ALSA mixer
