2008-06-22T19:38:00.000Z	Jupp3		Then it would work, except that it allowed only 320x240 or 640x480 screenmodes
2008-06-22T19:39:00.000Z	Jupp3		Same here
2008-06-22T19:39:00.000Z	Jupp3		Guess that if it can't figure out working settings, it assumes the worse
2008-06-22T19:39:00.000Z	Jupp3		Rather than potentially damage a monitor
2008-06-22T19:41:00.000Z	Jupp3		Added vendor & model names aswell, although they probably aren't needed
2008-06-22T19:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jupp3	you might find /var/log/Xorg.0.log helpfull as well to see what Xorg picks up and defaults back to
2008-06-22T19:42:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	Well it works for me now
2008-06-22T19:43:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	Was just explaining what kind of problem I had, in case it was related with what Twister has
2008-06-22T19:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jupp3	ok, may been pointed at Twister, got mixed up :)
2008-06-22T19:43:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	I just have this sort copy problem :)
2008-06-22T19:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jupp3	sort copy ? what are you trying to achieve ?
2008-06-22T19:49:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	Alphabetically sorted filelist on a device, which doesn't sort directories
2008-06-22T19:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jupp3	i see .. what about redirecting the output to a tmp file and sorting it with "sort' command ?
2008-06-22T19:53:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	Well I got as far as getting file list with find, then sorted it with sort
2008-06-22T19:55:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jupp3	ok, is that's not a viable option for you doing it likie that ? can't say i immediately have better solutions
2008-06-22T19:55:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	Well the problem was what to do with sorted list which contains both directories and files
2008-06-22T19:55:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	But I think I figured out a solution now
2008-06-22T19:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jupp3	ok, can be complex allright, takes a clear head and time (pressed for both a bit at the moment lol)
2008-06-22T19:57:00.000Z	Jupp3	glitsj16	And I think it's a better idea to live with it, rather than starting to modify the viewer program to sort directories :)
