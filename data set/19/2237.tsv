2010-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	Cityscape		I have a Nvidia Vanta graphics card, what is the proper way to install the best driver for it?
2010-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	system > admin > hardware drivers
2010-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	it doesn't list any drivers for me.
2010-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	hrm..
2010-10-12T09:35:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	let me check something
2010-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2010-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	will that work for me? The version number for my card's driver at the Nvidia site is 71.86.14. My version number isn't listed on that page you linked to me.
2010-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	the binary driver will work for your card.
2010-10-12T09:40:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/511374/   Is this worth it?
2010-10-12T09:41:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	did you get the link from ubottu?
2010-10-12T09:42:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	sorry, I dissconected.....did you see the link i sent you?
2010-10-12T09:43:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	yes did you get a private message from ubottu
2010-10-12T09:47:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	yes i did. so this is my best option?: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2010-10-12T09:48:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	yes I would follow those directions.
2010-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	so I followed the first step (removing nouveau by command line). Then it asked to open additional drivers, so I did and there still are no drivers available. So I moved to the next step, I have linux-headers-2.6.35-22-generic, linux-headers-2.6.35-22, linux-headers-generic & linux-libc-dev (development headers) installed. I could not find the linux-restricted-modules-XXX package in synaptic. What now?
2010-10-12T09:57:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	linxu-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	histo	Cityscape	basically install build-essentials and download the appropriate driver from nvidia.com  then run the script that you download. It will walk you through the install.
2010-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	i search for "linux-restricted-modules" in synaptic and it found nothing.
2010-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	Cityscape	histo	so you mean to use the manual driver from nvidia?
