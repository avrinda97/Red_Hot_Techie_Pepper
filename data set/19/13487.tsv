2005-11-26T07:04:00.000Z	Marlun		what does it mean that a package is "virtual" in the aptitude package list?
2005-11-26T07:05:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	Virtual packages try to provide a way for installing all packages related to particulat application.
2005-11-26T07:06:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	hmmmm, so for example gdm2 is a virtual package, which could provide a way to install packages related to gdm?
2005-11-26T07:07:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	because if I try aptitude show gdm2, I get the response: State: not a real package
2005-11-26T07:09:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	Perhaps I am confused with meta package. What I said is definition of meta package. For example OpenOffice.org2
2005-11-26T07:09:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	oh, then we are back where we were before :P
2005-11-26T07:09:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	I suppose virtual package help upgrading from one version to another when packages names have been changed
2005-11-26T07:11:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	if there were a gdm version 2, then I could understand that there could be a virtual package which helped you upgrade from  version 1 to 2, but now there only seems to be gdm, and gdm2 is a virtual package?
2005-11-26T07:11:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	let me check out
2005-11-26T07:11:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	ok ;) thanks
2005-11-26T07:12:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	where did oyu find this virtual package?
2005-11-26T07:13:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	ehmm I just did aptitude search gdm
2005-11-26T07:13:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	Are you on breezy?
2005-11-26T07:14:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	yes
2005-11-26T07:14:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	I don't see any gdm2 package in breezy. Searched on packages.ubuntu.com
2005-11-26T07:17:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	hmmmm weird
2005-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	maybe because its virtual? =P
2005-11-26T07:19:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Marlun	I will try to search it in apt when I go home. Is it exactly 'gdm2'?
2005-11-26T07:20:00.000Z	Marlun	onkarshinde	yes :)
