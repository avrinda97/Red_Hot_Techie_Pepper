2006-10-16T10:27:00.000Z	Mad3Max3		where can I download the edge version.. since the dapper is crap
2006-10-16T10:27:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	you mean debian ?
2006-10-16T10:28:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	no I mean v6.10 of Ubuntu. and not the 6.06.1 dappar.. that has a crap bootload
2006-10-16T10:29:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	since the 6.06.1 wont boot.. maybe the beta will
2006-10-16T10:29:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	And it's called edgy or something I belive
2006-10-16T10:30:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	i suggest a differ distro.. or did you try to pass any boot options
2006-10-16T10:32:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	well.. the Dapper has problem reading my discs.. so it's a disc reading problem.. and since my dvd driver can read dists like Knoppix.. I belive it's the Dapper bootdisc that is corrupt
2006-10-16T10:32:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	does knoppix boot
2006-10-16T10:33:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	Yes.. without any errors..
2006-10-16T10:33:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	 can you  try to pass options at boot on dapper idk i have not used it
2006-10-16T10:34:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	but knoppix isn't my taste in dist.. like the ubuntu.. Just dl knoppix so see if it would boot on my new comp.. and it did..
2006-10-16T10:34:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	no i am sure but there are many
2006-10-16T10:35:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	as for why it doesnt boot  there can be many reasons
2006-10-16T10:35:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	richiefrich	I can pass options before starting the boot.. in the menu
2006-10-16T10:35:00.000Z	richiefrich	Mad3Max3	if you can then try
