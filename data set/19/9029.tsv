2007-01-03T12:21:00.000Z	Aggort		Let me explain... I hate Windows much like anyone else. I have a macbook but want to start running Linux for quicker access and a faster OS than Windows. But, when I installed Ubuntu on the same hard drive over another partition before Ubuntu realy screwed up. I cou;dn't acvcess Ubuntu at all it'd get to the login screena nd when I'd login it would lock up. Next I tried accessing Windows and...
2007-01-03T12:21:00.000Z	Aggort		...it wouldn't load. It'd take me to a blue screen flash and reboot. So I've been nervous to install Ubuntu ever again. But now I want to try with 6.10 and all and wanted to get some better help before trying to install it all alone!
2007-01-03T12:21:00.000Z	Aggort		I'd love to install it on ym ahrd drive instead of jsut using the live CD cus I assume it's much faster.
2007-01-03T12:22:00.000Z	Aggort		So any advice?
2007-01-03T12:22:00.000Z	Aggort		No no this is on a windows PC
2007-01-03T12:23:00.000Z	Aggort		It's an AMD64 processor, Nvidia 6600 graphics card and a gig of RAM 80 gig hard drive.
2007-01-03T12:24:00.000Z	Aggort		I want to install it but withou messing up my Windows partition again
2007-01-03T12:25:00.000Z	Aggort		I never tried with my macbook
2007-01-03T12:25:00.000Z	Aggort		it was my PC I tried it on lol
2007-01-03T12:26:00.000Z	stefg	Aggort	Given that your partition table isn't broken already ubuntu should install just fine side by side with win... and in case you want your original MBR back, all you have to do is bootup the win-install-CD to rescue-console and 'fixmbr'
2007-01-03T12:31:00.000Z	stefg	Aggort	consider 32-bit if you want to avoid trouble
2007-01-03T12:31:00.000Z	Aggort	stefg	K
2007-01-03T12:31:00.000Z	stefg	Aggort	6.06.1-alternate-i386
2007-01-03T12:32:00.000Z	Aggort	stefg	But I have AMD processor
2007-01-03T12:32:00.000Z	stefg	Aggort	which is a flavor of i386
2007-01-03T12:34:00.000Z	Aggort	stefg	Why the alternate? I don't want to install right away, I want to make sure that the live version is going to run first. If that doesn't then there really isn't a reason for me to install right?    lol I typoed
2007-01-03T12:35:00.000Z	stefg	Aggort	ok, the take Desktop... but the Desktop installer is not as good and fast as the alternate one. But in for a testdrive the Desktop will do
2007-01-03T12:36:00.000Z	Aggort	stefg	Thank you! Am I correct though by saying that if the Live Desktop doesn't work than the installed version won't either?
2007-01-03T12:37:00.000Z	stefg	Aggort	that depends... might be your graphics isn't auto-setup correctly, but the in the installed version you can fix that... itb really depends on /wht's/ not working
