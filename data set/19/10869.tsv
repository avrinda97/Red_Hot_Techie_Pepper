2006-04-30T12:24:00.000Z	runparts	und0	hold down F12 to eject a cd
2006-04-30T12:24:00.000Z	runparts	und0	hold down C with while booting with the cd in the drive and it should boot from the cd
2006-04-30T12:28:00.000Z	runparts	und0	I've had luck installing breezy on a couple of similar iMacs
2006-04-30T12:28:00.000Z	und0	runparts	A ubuntu live cd
2006-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	runparts	und0	The slot loading iMacs don't have a paper clip hole, stupid design, but F12 has always worked for me
2006-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	und0	runparts	so what can I do?
2006-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	runparts	und0	Did they send you a liveCD and an install cd? if so, try the other cd to see if it boots
2006-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	und0	runparts	I can`t eject the cd doh :D
2006-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	runparts	und0	Don't know what to tell you, F12 has always worked for me eventually. Failing that, poke a paper clip in if there is a hole to manually eject it. Failing that, take the stupid thing apart, but that is difficult and breakable
