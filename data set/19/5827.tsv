2008-04-29T06:35:00.000Z	x45		can someone help me with a home network problem over here
2008-04-29T06:37:00.000Z	x45		i have an ubuntu laptop running off a wireless connection, and an ubuntu pc that i want to give the internet too through my laptop using an ethernet cable, how is this done?
2008-04-29T06:39:00.000Z	John_S	x45	Then why don't you use your router for NATing?
2008-04-29T06:39:00.000Z	x45	John_S	i don't know how to do that, thats why im asking
2008-04-29T06:40:00.000Z	John_S	x45	The router does NAT by default--that's how you can have many computers share its connection.
2008-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	John_S	x45	Do you need some help setting up your router?
2008-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	x45	John_S	possibly
2008-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	x45	John_S	wouldn't it be possible though to send my laptops connection through an ether cable to the pc?
2008-04-29T06:42:00.000Z	John_S	x45	Absolutely, but like bazhang said earlier, it's not a simple process setting up an ad-hoc network--can be done, but would take some work.
2008-04-29T06:43:00.000Z	John_S	x45	If you have a router though, why would you want to go thru your PC?
2008-04-29T06:44:00.000Z	x45	John_S	ok here's my setup, ive got my laptop going through the wireless router "which is inside my house" im in my garage where the pc is at and my laptop still gets a connection,...so i was hoping to feed the pc through my laptop for its net
2008-04-29T06:44:00.000Z	x45	John_S	which should be possible right
2008-04-29T06:45:00.000Z	John_S	x45	Yes it's possible, but is your laptop closer than your router? Why not just ethernet into your router?
2008-04-29T06:46:00.000Z	John_S	x45	i.e. connect your PC into your router directly using ethernet cable, instead of ethernet cable into your laptop.
2008-04-29T06:47:00.000Z	x45	John_S	that would require moving the router from the house to the garage though, then their would be limited range in the house
2008-04-29T06:48:00.000Z	x45	John_S	but yea, that would work
2008-04-29T06:48:00.000Z	John_S	x45	OK, I must have misunderstood--is your laptop not in the house, but instead in the garage where you can cable into it?
2008-04-29T06:50:00.000Z	x45	John_S	yes
2008-04-29T06:51:00.000Z	John_S	x45	OK, I see. It's up to you, if you really want to give ad-hoc networking a try, probably best to research in the ubuntuforums.org, or post there with all your details, and maybe someone can tell you exactly what you need to do. :)
