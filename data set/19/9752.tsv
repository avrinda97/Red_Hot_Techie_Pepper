2009-07-06T05:28:00.000Z	sooki		okay, so i did a fresh install yesterday, and i put /home on a sepperate partition and then later realized it was too small and gparted refuses to let me make it larger, so is there a way i can delete the partition and just have /home on the same partition as the rest of the drive?
2009-07-06T05:29:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	you can't resize while the partition is mounted.. boot to the live cd and use that to adjust
2009-07-06T05:30:00.000Z	sooki	scunizi	it's the live CD that won't let me do it
2009-07-06T05:31:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	you might be looking at the live cd's /home and not your physical /home.. that's the only use case that I can think of unless you don't have the room to make it bigger.
2009-07-06T05:34:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	was /home right next to / ? and are you using the graphical "drag the bar" to increase the size
2009-07-06T05:36:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	the partitions are labeled sda<number>, what is the labeling for / and for /home?
2009-07-06T05:37:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	no.. the partition editor should tell you..
2009-07-06T05:38:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	really hard to do this from there..
2009-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	sooki	scunizi	/home is on /dev/sda1 and the rest is on /dev/sda2
2009-07-06T05:53:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	the rest meaning / (root) ?
2009-07-06T05:54:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	ok when you reduced the size of root (sda2) did you reduce it from the end of the partition or the beginning?
2009-07-06T05:55:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	then you should be able to stretch the end of /home to the beginning of root
2009-07-06T05:58:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	in the partition editor pick the partition with the drop down menu in the upper right and on the graphical display of the space used you should be able to drag the right or left edge of the partition in the direction needed.
2009-07-06T05:59:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	your on KDE? kubuntu?  not sure if the partition editor looks the same there as it does on gnome.. probably but....
2009-07-06T06:00:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	did you just install recently? and if so are you dual booting?
2009-07-06T06:01:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	you could sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop from inside a termial if you wanted gnome.. kde is a different animal since 4.xx .. I haven't played with it.
2009-07-06T06:02:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	you could also just reinstall and manually partition during the process
2009-07-06T06:02:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	you haven't accumulated anything that you can't do without.. a reinstall would only take 40 mins. or so.
2009-07-06T06:05:00.000Z	scunizi	sooki	no problem.. I occationally run kubuntu in a vm in vbox.. nice.. but I need a production machine and kubuntu is still developing .. that is the new kde is still in growing pains.. it's pretty though.. I like it.
