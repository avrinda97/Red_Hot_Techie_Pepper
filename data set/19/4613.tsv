2009-02-27T03:55:00.000Z	eweb100		eyyyy whats up?
2009-02-27T03:56:00.000Z	eweb100		thunderbird is betterz
2009-02-27T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	not always
2009-02-27T03:56:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	example?
2009-02-27T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	it may not have the features s/he needs. there may be a client that has different features taht fit his/her needs closer than thunderbird, this will make thunderbird a poor choice
2009-02-27T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	so better and best are only individually guagable
2009-02-27T03:59:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	You can say that about every program. "It might not be right because she might not like it"
2009-02-27T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	exactly, so no app is beter or best
2009-02-27T03:59:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	but thunderbird has uber 1337 sause.
2009-02-27T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	i always say "try a lot of them see which YOU like then use that"
2009-02-27T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	maybe to you, some users may think it sucks, its all preference
2009-02-27T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	its like any app you can name. even linux and windows. Linux is not better than window sand windows is not better than linux
2009-02-27T04:03:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	Well then you might as well just say google Email cliants for mac
2009-02-27T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	they wont run on linux unless there is a linux port, you are missing the point, also please use websearch, google implies only using google when there are vast multitudes of search engines
2009-02-27T04:07:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	People actualy use yahoo and msn search??
2009-02-27T04:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	i use www.ask.com as well for quick pointless stuff, google is fine, for something in depth I use as many as I can get my hands on. Using only google is like researching in only one library
2009-02-27T04:09:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	Yes, but that one library is towhundred times bigger than any of the others
2009-02-27T04:10:00.000Z	eweb100	ActionParsnip	And ever sence Jeves left ask,com i dont like it
2009-02-27T04:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eweb100	i just think its immature to only use 1 search engine
