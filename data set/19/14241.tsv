2004-10-12T14:06:00.000Z	dyn		and i didn't even see mplayer in the mirrors' filelist
2004-10-12T14:07:00.000Z	dyn		what's marillat then?
2004-10-12T14:07:00.000Z	dyn		hm
2004-10-12T14:07:00.000Z	dyn		ah ok
2004-10-12T14:07:00.000Z	dyn		shame, but i've left debian completely about 2 years ago
2004-10-12T14:08:00.000Z	dyn		after being a true believer user of debian for 4.5+ years
2004-10-12T14:08:00.000Z	dyn		what about ubuntu's community anyway?
2004-10-12T14:08:00.000Z	dyn		recently i'm getting fed up with the amounts of linux newbies getting on gentoo :(
2004-10-12T14:09:00.000Z	dyn		it wouldn't be a serious problem (everyone starts somewhere), but gentoo is getting noob-proof features, which it really should not
2004-10-12T14:11:00.000Z	dyn		which aint a Good Thing (tm)
2004-10-12T14:11:00.000Z	joem	dyn	what do you mean by hand?
2004-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	dyn	joem	yup
2004-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	joem	dyn	emerge /path/to/ebuild will mess up your world file and depgraph
2004-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	dyn	joem	i dont care the world file anyway
2004-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	dyn	joem	when did you start to use linux?
2004-10-31T07:07:00.000Z	joem	dyn	.Xdefaults are where you store term settings such as colors and all
2004-10-31T07:08:00.000Z	dyn	joem	why not? it's a more general solution for the problem
2004-10-31T07:08:00.000Z	joem	dyn	it is more limiting
2004-10-31T07:09:00.000Z	dyn	joem	i'd rather say it's more general..
