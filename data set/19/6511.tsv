2011-06-09T17:17:00.000Z	jud		how do i autocomplete someones name?
2011-06-09T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	use TAB
2011-06-09T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	if you run:  ls     can you see the plum.txt  file?
2011-06-09T18:08:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	  Is command not found
2011-06-09T18:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	LS in lowercase, (L)i(S)t
2011-06-09T18:10:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	sorry yes, tried that and strangely i cant see plum.text but uniq-plum is there
2011-06-09T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	then you need to change the terminal's directory to where the file is held
2011-06-09T18:13:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	it's on the desktop
2011-06-09T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	then run:  cd ~/Desktop
2011-06-09T18:14:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	ah
2011-06-09T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	you can't just fire commands in any old directory and expect the interpretter to magically find the file you want to manipulate for you, you need to change the working directory to the one with the file so it knows what to use
2011-06-09T18:16:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	yeah i was trying to do it by putting in a complete path before but something was wrong with that so now i'll do the dirtectory thing
2011-06-09T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	makes life easier ;)
2011-06-09T18:23:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	ok so now had this  /Desktop$ cat plum.txt|sort|uniq>uniq-plum.txt    but still got the same back. I'm just trying to eliminate duplicates..is that the way?
2011-06-09T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	if you run: ls   do you see the filename? Are you using the right case?
2011-06-09T18:25:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	 isee it
2011-06-09T18:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jud	and does it have any capitalization?
2011-06-09T18:27:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	capitalisation? both are on the desktop even though it came back no such file
2011-06-09T18:28:00.000Z	jud	ActionParsnip	but uniq-plum is empty
