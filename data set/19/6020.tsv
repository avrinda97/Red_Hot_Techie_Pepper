2008-04-05T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Bah! learn vi! and never go back!
2008-04-05T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis		:)
2008-04-05T16:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis		vigor!
2008-04-05T16:56:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Dr_willis	learn vi - is that for me :). I really can't estimate what is vi, but I am scared because many other peoples are scared. :)
2008-04-05T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 run the vimtutor program. to get the basics down.
2008-04-05T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 be sure to install the full vim package also
2008-04-05T16:57:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Dr_willis	will check it, I promise :). But I installed ubuntu one month back, so step by step
2008-04-05T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 gpm is handy.  some games can do it i imagine.. but never seen any that use sdl + mouse.
2008-04-05T17:11:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Dr_willis	but we have mouse drivers for DOS (example). I was thinking - maybe vi/vim similar editors have build in such mouse support in sdl (if this is the right term)
2008-04-05T17:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 you can use the mouse in vi with gpm, and the proper vi setting to enable mouse ussage.
2008-04-05T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 under a xterm or whatever under X you can also use the mouse. If o you enable mouse ussage in the vim  editor
2008-04-05T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 but in many cases its much better to learn the  keyboard. :)
2008-04-05T17:13:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Dr_willis	yes, sure. Just thinking about sdl terminal. Conclusion: linux guys like terminal, but they are not stupid, for mouse they use GUI :) (joke)
2008-04-05T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 remove vim-tiny install vim-full
2008-04-05T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 dont worry about ubuntu-minimal
2008-04-05T17:22:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Dr_willis	this will remove ubuntu-minimal
2008-04-05T17:22:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Dr_willis	ok then, 10x
2008-04-05T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 as i said.. dont worry about it.
2008-04-12T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mmm4m5m	 a read of the advanced bash scripting guide will come in handy also.   You could just use the proper escape sequence.
