2004-10-13T12:42:00.000Z	defendguin		when i boot up my ubuntu box i get 2 error messages both involve module loading.  it tries to load shpchp and pciehp does anyone else have this problem?
2004-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	defendguin		has this bug been reported?
2004-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	Yes; they're the hotpluggable-pci drivers; unfortunately it's hard to know if it's safe or not to load them
2004-10-13T13:02:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	802.11b or 802.11g ?
2004-10-13T13:04:00.000Z	defendguin	Kinnison	i would think g since i want to be able to get access anywhere its available
2004-10-13T13:04:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	the WG511 is a good choice then
2004-10-13T13:04:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	I have two and they're excellent
2004-10-13T13:29:00.000Z	defendguin	Kinnison	what brands of cards have that chipset?
2004-10-13T13:29:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	Not sure other than the Netgear WG511
2004-10-13T13:29:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	check www.prism54.org I guess
2004-10-13T13:33:00.000Z	defendguin	Kinnison	can you snort with these cards?
2004-10-13T13:33:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	I once got kismet going with one
2004-10-13T13:33:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	but I'm far too 'white-hat' to know about that sort of thing
2004-10-13T13:39:00.000Z	defendguin	Kinnison	you have prism2 card?
2004-10-13T13:40:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	Nup; prism54 and ipw2100
2004-10-13T14:16:00.000Z	defendguin	Kinnison	does it take any effort to get the wg511 working in linux or is it recognized right away?
2004-10-13T14:17:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	the prism54 driver is present; you have to download firmware I think
2004-10-13T14:18:00.000Z	defendguin	Kinnison	what firmware?
2004-10-13T14:18:00.000Z	Kinnison	defendguin	The firmware for the prism54 cards. Check out www.prism54.org it's all on there
