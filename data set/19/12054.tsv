2005-11-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrZeus		I want to kill a process, but is not shown in the process list
2005-11-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrZeus		because I try to run that program, and keeps saying that is already running
2005-11-06T10:06:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	then it's not running... it should be shown in ps -aux
2005-11-06T10:06:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	 is not there
2005-11-06T10:06:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	that's more than likely a lockfile problem.
2005-11-06T10:07:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	hows that lockfile problem?
2005-11-06T10:07:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	the process creates a file that says 'the program is running'.  when the program exits gracefully, that file gets deleted.  the program didn't exit gracefully, so it's still got garbage laying around.
2005-11-06T10:08:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	hence it thinks it's still running.  you need to find and delete the lockfile, most probably.
2005-11-06T10:08:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	how is it done for erasing that lockfile
2005-11-06T10:08:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	what program is it?
2005-11-06T10:08:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	it is ipodder
2005-11-06T10:09:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	look in /var/lock
2005-11-06T10:09:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	it gives lvm
2005-11-06T10:09:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	it's going to be in /var somewhere probably.
2005-11-06T10:10:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	will it be called something related to 'ipodder' ?
2005-11-06T10:10:00.000Z	mshade	DrZeus	i dont know if ipodder has a manpage, but you can try searching the manpage for the term 'lock'
2005-11-06T10:17:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	I didnt found the file
2005-11-06T10:23:00.000Z	DrZeus		Oh man, Im having a time with this iPodder thing
2005-11-06T10:24:00.000Z	DrZeus	mshade	I dont know what to do now
