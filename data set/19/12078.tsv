2006-05-04T06:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	depending what step your on
2006-05-04T06:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	have you downloaded the tar? have you unpacked the tar in the /opt/file?
2006-05-04T06:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	that is fine
2006-05-04T06:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	do you see the sudo tar -C command?
2006-05-04T06:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	that will unpack it in the right place :) if you follow wiki as written paste the commands into terminal everything works out great ;)
2006-05-04T06:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	the sudo tar -C command yes
2006-05-04T06:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	everything in the boxes without the # should be typed as a command
2006-05-04T06:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	just copy and paste the commands as they are there
2006-05-04T06:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	the things with # infront are just comments read them dont type them
2006-05-04T06:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	why do you say that?
2006-05-04T06:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	after unpacking it with the command i gave above what did you do?
2006-05-04T06:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	cd /opt/firefox/plugins/  did you do this?
2006-05-04T06:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	the sudo tar -C command the full command should have unpacked the tar
2006-05-04T06:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	it looks like you skipped the first 4 commands :(
2006-05-04T06:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	every command on that page is needed not just put there you didnt run the mkdir command so you dont have the dir made so you cant cd into it
2006-05-04T06:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Christophe	if you join #ubuntu-offtopic i will help you get it set up ;)
