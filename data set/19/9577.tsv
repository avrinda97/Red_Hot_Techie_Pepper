2007-08-21T06:57:00.000Z	moffa		you run it from a shell
2007-08-21T06:57:00.000Z	moffa		so in a terminal type ./filename.run
2007-08-21T06:59:00.000Z	moffa		Chippy you can slide the partition forward
2007-08-21T07:00:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	the free space is before the partition though, so I can't slide anything forward...
2007-08-21T07:01:00.000Z	moffa		Chippy you just have to select free space before partition to zero
2007-08-21T07:01:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	free space before partition is greyed out :S
2007-08-21T07:02:00.000Z	moffa		Chippy are you sure there is free space in-front of it?
2007-08-21T07:02:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	it's listed as "unallocated", I just resized another partition to release that space
2007-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	moffa	Chippy	have you tried to refresh the device information?
2007-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	sure have, no luck
2007-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	moffa		Chippy what type of partition is it?
2007-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	that I want to resize? ext3
2007-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	moffa	Chippy	are you currently using it now? ie is it mounted
2007-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	nope, live cd
2007-08-21T07:05:00.000Z	moffa	Chippy	not sure, maybe restart that's quite awkward
2007-08-21T07:05:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	I'll say...
2007-08-21T07:05:00.000Z	moffa	Chippy	try restarting and let me know
2007-08-21T07:06:00.000Z	Chippy	moffa	I could try QTParted, is that reliable?
2007-08-21T07:07:00.000Z	moffa	Chippy	yes, I've tried Qparted  -- sorry back in 5
