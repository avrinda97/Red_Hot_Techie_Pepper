2007-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	Branden	ShackJack	I'm on Ubuntu Server
2007-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	Ahh.. then you might want to look at your xmodmao in /usr/share
2007-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	xmodmap
2007-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	Branden	ShackJack	- How do I do this?
2007-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	You might to google for more info, but you can edit whatever xmodmap you're set to use so the keys work right...  cat /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.us-101   as an example...
2007-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	I'm afraid I'm not intimately familiar with server setup (i.e. if it has config)... beside dpkg xmodmap --reconfigure ?
2007-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	Branden	ShackJack	- It don't seem to have any directories, when I cd home or anything it don't work.
2007-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	Ermm.. yeah, they're there :) try using forward slash   cd /home
2007-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	Also sudo dpkg-reconfigure xmodmap something something.... don't know exactly..
2007-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	Branden	ShackJack	Ok thank you, I'll see what I get with the info you have given me.
2007-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	Branden	Also maybe dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
