2008-07-10T18:01:00.000Z	bushwakko		Is there anyone here who can help me with a strange problem with my nvidia drivers? everything seems fine, the drivers, the xorg output, and all. but gl stuff uses 100% cpu.
2008-07-10T18:02:00.000Z	Red2	bushwakko	did u use envy to install the drivers?
2008-07-10T18:02:00.000Z	bushwakko	Red2	I used synaptics and chose the never drivers
2008-07-10T18:02:00.000Z	Red2		﻿bushwakko, or did u do it manually?
2008-07-10T18:03:00.000Z	bushwakko	Red2	I installed envyng-gtk now, will check it out
2008-07-10T18:03:00.000Z	Red2		﻿bushwakko, yeah like bazhang said... u should try from the pakage manager and install envy. it will auto find for you the correct drivers for ur card and it will most probabaly work
