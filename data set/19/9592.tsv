2006-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	SilentDis		i've herd of too many problems at this point.  I'll stay on dapper :)
2006-11-16T17:46:00.000Z	SilentDis		question:  anyone know of a batch interface to lame?  gui would be nice, but I'm comfortable enough at the prompt :)
2006-11-16T17:46:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	just write one yourself, its quite fun...
2006-11-16T17:47:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 i know some scripting, but no where near skilled enough yet to do it as a bash or nautilius script yet :(
2006-11-16T17:48:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	me neather and i did it... wait...
2006-11-16T17:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 i assume, also, i'd have to learn to use something to read out id3 tags, to preserve them.  not sure of a command line tool to do that
2006-11-16T17:49:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	i did not do tags... here is how i did it from mp4 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32024/
2006-11-16T17:51:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	pacpl is a nice perl audio converter... try to install it
2006-11-16T17:51:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 ahh, i wanted something to basically 'downmix' my mp3s.  the MP3 cd player at work, as well as the one in my car, don't handle anything but 128cbr files well (i encode to 224vbs usually)
2006-11-16T17:52:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 i take it that app isn't in the repositories?
2006-11-16T17:52:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	so just use ... lame -h -b 128 file.wav file.mp3
2006-11-16T17:52:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	dont know... try
2006-11-16T17:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 yes, that would be fine... except when theres nearly 300 songs to convert... one by one... by hand...
2006-11-16T17:54:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	thats why you do for i in *.mp3 do lame... etc etc
2006-11-16T17:54:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	first test it with a few copied files
2006-11-16T17:58:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	you can learn loads from this script http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32030/
2006-11-16T17:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 you are a godsend, I can figure it out from that easily :)
2006-11-16T17:59:00.000Z	tuskernini	SilentDis	i think so... where they use ffmpeg... you just use lame
2006-11-16T06:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	tuskernini	 oh of course lol
