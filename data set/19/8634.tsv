2007-03-03T14:17:00.000Z	Episcopus		can anyone help me get my netgear MA311 wireless card to work? edgy finds it, but doesn't let it connect to my wireless network
2007-03-03T14:17:00.000Z	kbd	Episcopus	you've tried ndiswrapper?
2007-03-03T14:18:00.000Z	Episcopus		i went here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsNetgear and it says it is supposed to be supported
2007-03-03T14:18:00.000Z	kbd		How do you connect to your wireless network?
2007-03-03T14:19:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	what do you mean how? WEP
2007-03-03T14:19:00.000Z	kbd		Are you sure your system is capable of using WEP? I've had trouble in Dapper...
2007-03-03T14:20:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	no, i'm not sure. how would i find out? i would like to stay mildly protected considering the computer i am typing on right now is still windows
2007-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	kbd		Go to System->Administration->System Log
2007-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	ok, there
2007-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	kbd		And try to use wep with iwconfig
2007-03-03T14:22:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	hold on, i am brand new. do what now?
2007-03-03T14:22:00.000Z	kbd		If your system encounters a problem trying to use WEP it should show up in the logs
2007-03-03T14:22:00.000Z	kbd		ah
2007-03-03T14:23:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	 :)
2007-03-03T14:23:00.000Z	kbd		!iwconfig >kbd
2007-03-03T14:23:00.000Z	kbd		gsh... ubotu is ignorant
2007-03-03T14:23:00.000Z	kbd		ok, simply type 'man iwconfig' into a gnome-terminal
2007-03-03T14:24:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	done
2007-03-03T14:26:00.000Z	Episcopus	kbd	once in iwconfig, then...
