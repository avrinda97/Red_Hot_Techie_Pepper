2008-09-14T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	it is.
2008-09-14T12:30:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	so should I use a .deb ?
2008-09-14T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	What?
2008-09-14T12:31:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	trying to download a plugin for pidgin
2008-09-14T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	yes, Ubuntu uses deb files.
2008-09-14T12:32:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	the plugin says I need GDebi Package installer, is that in the repos?
2008-09-14T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	its already instlled
2008-09-14T12:33:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	I get error "because the associated helper application does not exist"
2008-09-14T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	Are you running standard Ubuntu?
2008-09-14T12:33:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	yup
2008-09-14T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	gdebi is installed by default.  Odd. Well, you could try and install it.  package is gdebi
2008-09-14T12:35:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	I have it apparently
2008-09-14T12:35:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	How do I launch something from terminal?
2008-09-14T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	Launch what?
2008-09-14T12:36:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	I want to launch Gdebi to see if it works but I can't find it through the GUI
2008-09-14T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	its gdebi, I believe.
2008-09-14T12:37:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	I don't know how to launch it from terminal though
2008-09-14T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Razer	Uh, neither do I.  you'd have to do "man gdebi" it'll be gdebi /path/to/deb/file.deb  but there may be a -i or something
2008-09-14T12:38:00.000Z	Razer	Flannel	I clicked saved and then opened it, seems there's something wrong with having GDebi as default
