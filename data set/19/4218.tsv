2012-05-17T08:53:00.000Z	armence		Hello all. Where can I download the netbook edition?
2012-05-17T08:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 thats basically obsolete.
2012-05-17T08:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 there may be some iso's of it still on the ubuntu servers.
2012-05-17T08:54:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	What's the recommended solution for ubuntu on netbooks then?
2012-05-17T08:54:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	Just normal ubuntu?
2012-05-17T08:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 normal ubuntu 12.04 works fine on my netbook...
2012-05-17T08:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 the netbook edition and the regbular ubuntu  becvame the ssame thing about 3 releases back.
2012-05-17T08:54:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	Thanks
2012-05-22T08:15:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	Thanks, I'll try that
2012-05-22T08:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 ive seen sd cards use such device names befpr. mmcblk0  on laptops built in card readers
2012-05-22T08:16:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	It is a laptop built-in card reader
2012-05-22T08:21:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	OK, if I pull the card out, /dev/mmwhatever goes away so I feel quite confident that it's the right device
2012-05-22T08:22:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	Actually, there are two devices: /dev/mmcblk0p1 and /dev/mmcblk0. Do you know what that means?
2012-05-22T08:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 p1 = partion1, like sda1 sda2 you got mmcblkXpY
2012-05-22T08:23:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	Makes lots of sense. So is it on the partition that I should cat the iso or directly on the device?
2012-05-22T08:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 you image the iso to the device.. not a partition
2012-05-22T08:24:00.000Z	armence	dr_willis	zykotick9 Thanks all.
2012-05-22T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 to use sudo and pipes properly one often has to use 'sudo tee' as part of the command
2012-05-22T08:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	armence	 theres some sudo guides out there with examples
