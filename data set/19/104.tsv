2012-09-18T04:04:00.000Z	michealpw		You can just use sudo Xorg -configure :1 to hash-out an xorg.conf.new in your home directory ;)
2012-09-18T04:04:00.000Z	michealpw		It'll probe your hardware
2012-09-18T04:04:00.000Z	michealpw		And spit out the xorg.conf.new. Then just open it with Kate or Gedit and you're golden
2012-09-18T04:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	+1 "sudo X -configure :1"
2012-09-18T04:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	fyi, have you tried htop?  it's top but cooler - not something to recommend, as it isn't installed by default.
2012-09-18T04:08:00.000Z	michealpw	zykotick9	: Nope I will check it out thx!:)
2012-09-18T04:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	powerful too.  but i turn both the threadings off, so it displays like top.
2012-09-18T04:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	"it's not a tumor" ;)
2012-09-18T04:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	both are bloat-city IMO
2012-09-18T04:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	YES!  chome is with spying features ;)
2012-09-18T04:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	sorry, NO.  chromium is open source...
2012-09-18T04:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	of course
2012-09-18T04:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	i'm sure MOST chromium development is by google employees, they have enough gnu/linux developers ;)
2012-09-18T04:47:00.000Z	michealpw	zykotick9	Really, Oracle doesn't allow distribution in the distros? :|
2012-09-18T04:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	not anymore.
2012-09-18T04:49:00.000Z	michealpw	zykotick9	Are the opensource implementations of java fully compatible?
2012-09-18T04:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	i doubt it...
2012-09-18T04:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	no.
2012-09-18T05:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	michealpw	fyi "metamodes" has been a xorg.conf option forever.  just saying.
