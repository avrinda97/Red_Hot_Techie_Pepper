2009-12-26T17:30:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	it's not a package though, it's an icon
2009-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	cyclades just work - get an IP KVM for choice
2009-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	oh wireless kvm? gl with that
2009-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	do you have a link to a website maybe.
2009-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	you want a link to google?
2009-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	no, not a wireless kvm, a kvm that can work with a wireless keyboard/mouse that has a USB interface
2009-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	no, sorry. :-)
2009-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	yeah, usb is going to be problematic maybe
2009-12-27T09:15:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	16 or 32 port connections, holy carp!! i am not running a server room. i only have 2 computers
2009-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	they have a wide range, but they're not the cheapest
2009-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	i have a PS/2 to male usb, do they make a PS/2 to usb female? because I already have a iogear PS/2 kvm switch that I use now with an ancient Rosewell Wireless Keyboard/Mouse but I just got a new logitech ex100 wireless keyboard/mouse
2009-12-27T09:20:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	i see that USB isn't the best choice. i can't believe though that more people don't use a wireless usb keyboard/mouse with a kvm switch
2009-12-27T09:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	ps2 is easy to kvm, usb is.. challenging
2009-12-27T09:24:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	as long as usb keyboard/mice have been around, i figured there'd be a decent consumer kvm for them
2009-12-27T09:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	let me know if you find a kvm that supports usb - never seen one
2009-12-27T09:28:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	here ya go, www.google.com.   just kidding, here it is: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817107415
2009-12-27T09:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	mazda01	haha good for you
2009-12-27T09:33:00.000Z	mazda01	frogzoo	hey, you wanted to know if i found one didn't you?
