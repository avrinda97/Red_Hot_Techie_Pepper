2007-07-22T12:37:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	do you get the error every time?
2007-07-22T12:31:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	you can go to one of your terminals (CTRL+ALT+1) and issue the command sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-07-22T12:29:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	why are you using those keys? lockups?
2007-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	yeah, i was in the middle of swtiching tabs of playing vids on youtube and whamo, everything froze including the mouse. tryed c+a+b: it stared the desktop reboot and it froze in the middle of that!..
2007-07-22T12:31:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	CTRL+ALT+F1, sorry about that
2007-07-22T12:31:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	couldn't everything froze.
2007-07-22T12:32:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	are you on a laptop? it sounds symptomatic of a low battery... i don't really know what might have caused it
2007-07-22T12:32:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	yup, on a laptop but im plugged in right now...
2007-07-22T12:33:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	i don't know what to tell you... if your computer's completely frozen, a restart is the only option i can think of
2007-07-22T12:34:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	thats what i figured, so thats what I did.. and during boot up (after ubuntu splash screen) I get [150.196000]  Buffer I/O Error on device sr0, logical block 225
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	did you try Google?
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	im googling it as we type, but i thought someone might have an idea in the chan
2007-07-22T12:35:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	i don't know what device sr0 would be
2007-07-22T12:36:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	well what would that reference too normally?? Is that usb, cd, hd?..
2007-07-22T12:36:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	looks like a CD/DVD device
2007-07-22T12:36:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	ok well that'd ahve to be my dvd burner then, its the only one for the laptop
2007-07-22T12:37:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	nope, only after this lil freezing mishap
2007-07-22T12:38:00.000Z	bmartin	vip3rousmango	it's probably nothing to worry about... if you were burning a CD or DVD it's probably no good anymore
2007-07-22T12:38:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	bmartin	hokay.. well if it comes up again.. i'll poke around a little more
