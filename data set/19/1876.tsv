2010-09-19T08:31:00.000Z	at05gt		is there a way to change the size of a partition if it still has files in it? or do i need to format and then repartition?
2010-09-19T08:32:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	gparted can do that in many cases. for expanding you can use even less complex tools in many cases.
2010-09-19T08:43:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	1024 mib in a gib
2010-09-19T11:41:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	last question, ill still be able to use this vista partition once grub is fixed?
2010-09-19T11:33:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	you have to fix grub. removing the OTHER bootloader will just mean you have nothing
2010-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	you don't need to completely reinstall grub, actually, just fix the mbr part. follow the instructions though.
2010-09-19T11:36:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	10.04 is grub 2 yes?
2010-09-19T11:36:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	yes
2010-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	yes. you will have to run update-grub to have it add a menu entry for windows though.
2010-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	or should i just dump the partition and run virtual box with an old XP disk?
2010-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	it's up to you, either will work
2010-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	which will work better? the reason I need a windows os is cause i cant seem to get wine working to run the games i wann play
2010-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	bare metal will work best for games
2010-09-19T11:44:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	whats bare metal?
2010-09-19T11:44:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	not in virtualization
2010-09-19T11:44:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	icarus-c: so either keep the windows OS on a partition find a way to get wine working?
2010-09-19T11:45:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	yep
2010-09-19T11:45:00.000Z	at05gt	Kevin`	thats what i figured
2010-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	Kevin`	at05gt	yes, run update-grub
