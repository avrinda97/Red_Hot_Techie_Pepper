2008-05-12T22:05:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	that is a really bad statement to make, and your follow-up hardly makes it any better
2008-05-12T22:05:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	well, I'm having all sorts of problems with hardy so it might be bad but utterly true.
2008-05-12T22:06:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	the fact that you are having problems does not justify claiming that it's "broken" if plenty of people have upgraded or installed it successfully
2008-05-12T22:06:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	I really doubt they successfully upgraded on an iBook.
2008-05-12T22:06:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	that kind of thing is called FUD and is not welcome here
2008-05-12T22:07:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	I've been using Ubuntu since 5.10 and Hardy is the worst I ever ran.
2008-05-12T22:08:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	extrapolating your personal bad experience and saying that it's broken is FUD and does not belong here.
2008-05-12T22:08:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	but maybe you can tell me why my CPU is constantly on 100% freq even though it is totally idle and everything has been working until the second I upgraded.
2008-05-12T22:08:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	I have my own share of problems with hardy. Do I go around and scare people because of it? No, because that is utterly unreasonable behaviour.
2008-05-12T22:09:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	sleep and hibernate are broken and there are active bugs in launchpad about this.
2008-05-12T22:09:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	any software has bugs. Any major upgrade will contain regressions.
2008-05-12T22:09:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	it would be much more unnreasonable to tell him to upgrade.
2008-05-12T22:09:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	this is called an LTS release.
2008-05-12T22:09:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	then say so. But don't say that hardy is broken, when for plenty of people it clearly isn't.
2008-05-12T22:11:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	and I'm not here to complain. All I wanted to know is which component is responsible for frequency scaling in hardy so I can file a bug. pbbuttonsd doesn't seem to do it anymore.
2008-05-12T22:11:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	okay. I can see that you are reasonable and have the best intentions. Please be careful with your wording, though.
2008-05-12T22:12:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	I have previously filed a freq scaling related bug against the kernel, and it was processed there, so it should be fine if you do the same.
2008-05-12T22:12:00.000Z	w-mute	soundray	OK. I'll do that, then. Thanks.
2008-08-18T18:58:00.000Z	soundray	w-mute	do you have a file /usr/lib/goffice/0.6.1/plugins/plot_boxes/plot-types.xml ?
