2006-04-30T10:32:00.000Z	rolim		i have my cdrom mounted in /dev/hdb, it is corect?
2006-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	yes, if its connected as the primary slave
2006-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	nothing, having a cdrom on /dev/hdb is fine
2006-04-30T10:39:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	what is the problem?
2006-04-30T10:40:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	what is the error?
2006-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org if it's more than one line
2006-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	that's the exact message?
2006-04-30T10:45:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	i think it means that it couldn't read part of the dvd
2006-04-30T10:47:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	does the error happen immediately after you type the command?
2006-04-30T10:48:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	does it work for other CDs?
2006-04-30T10:51:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	then it's probably a fault on that cd/dvd - i understand that dd is not very error tolerant
2006-04-30T10:53:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	i don't know sorry
2006-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	bimberi	rolim	np :)
