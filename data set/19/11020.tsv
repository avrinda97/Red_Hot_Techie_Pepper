2006-04-08T13:12:00.000Z	roxanne		is there another desktop which would be "less memory intensive" and also user friendly besides Xfce and is not a live cd?
2006-04-08T13:12:00.000Z	roxanne		SUggestions?
2006-04-08T13:13:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	what errors are you getting with xfce? during install? i am currently installing, so not much help
2006-04-08T13:14:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	icewm looks like windows/explorer etc. and is easy and light. but i still prefer xfce.
2006-04-08T13:15:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	no insall problems, it just doesn't recognise my account as the root user.
2006-04-08T13:15:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	ah. well. what are you trying to do?
2006-04-08T13:16:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	and there is no root user in ubuntu.. you should be able to do things with "sudo"
2006-04-08T13:16:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	without that alls o important toolbar xfce4 is useless.
2006-04-08T13:16:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	sudo?
2006-04-08T13:17:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	I"m new to linux, and although i'm betting that that is a command for the terminal, I don't know how or when to use it.
2006-04-08T13:18:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	see.. it is like this. when you need to do something that needs root user privileges, you open a terminal and type "sudo command" and it will ask you for your userpassword and do the job
2006-04-08T13:20:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	i couldn't open a terminal or anything without that xfce toolbar that won't open because i'm not "root"
2006-04-08T13:21:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	oh. :( hope that does'nt happen to me. i am still downloading the xfce desktop using apt-get. will tell you when i have installed.
2006-04-08T13:26:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	for your sake I hope it doesn't happen to you.
2006-04-08T13:27:00.000Z	roxanne	walden	for now i'll just completely remove kde and xfce and try icewm. if i need to i'll reinstall xfce and fight with it then.
2006-04-08T13:28:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	good luck. but you have the default gnome. right?
2006-04-08T13:37:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	hey, xfce works fine
2006-04-08T13:37:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	you said you could'nt get the XFCE desktop/menus.. did you try right clicking on the desktop?
2006-04-08T13:37:00.000Z	walden	roxanne	that will bring up the menu
