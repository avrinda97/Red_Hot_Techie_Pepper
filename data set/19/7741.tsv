2009-06-03T05:28:00.000Z	neopsyche		IM not getting much help in squid channel
2009-06-03T05:28:00.000Z	neopsyche		does anyone know how I can..
2009-06-03T05:29:00.000Z	neopsyche		is it possible that i can create a cache of videos linked from my video site?
2009-06-03T05:29:00.000Z	neopsyche		in other words, video site .. links to videos embedded from youtube etc.. specific videos on the site cached on ISP server for users of the site (but not other youtube videos)_
2009-06-03T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 not with squid i think.. i think it just caches the html type pages.. not large files..   but it might be able to cache downloads..
2009-06-03T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 but even then squid tries not to cache large things forever..
2009-06-03T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 i would say check the squid docs.  it might have some options to cach specific files for large sizes/times.
2009-06-03T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 squid is very flexiable. :)
2009-06-03T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 last iused it was 2 years ago.
2009-06-03T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 it is handy for a home lan for  4+ machines. :) but ive never seen it used to cache youtube bvideos
2009-06-03T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 good luck. :) time for some serious reading of the config files for squid
2009-06-03T05:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 google for 'squid cache flv' has a few hits. :)
2009-06-03T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 and.. first google hit is a thread.. that points to the squid FAQ/docs// :) rtfming once again is the answer.. heh

2009-06-03T05:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 nope.. i got them all basically blocked.. :)
2009-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 and all i know on squid - is very little.. and covered in the squid docs. :)
2009-06-03T05:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	 no idea on what can work. From what i read those videos sites do specific things to 'break' caching of their videos..
2009-06-03T05:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	neopsyche	  try it and see is all you can do i guess.
