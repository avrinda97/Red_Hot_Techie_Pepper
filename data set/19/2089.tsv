2010-07-08T21:08:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	openfire is quite easy, and has some thorough walk-thrus to get it started
2010-07-08T21:09:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	have you set up your sql database?
2010-07-08T21:10:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	so you've downloaded mysql, or whatever you want to use, already?
2010-07-08T21:11:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	did you use a tutorial to set it up?
2010-07-08T21:15:00.000Z	ozBoy	jjoohhnn	i have used a few and none will let me go live
2010-07-08T21:17:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	so the problem you have is you try to access your openfire server via the web, but your admin password won't work?
2010-07-08T21:18:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	have you looked at help pages along these lines: http://www.igniterealtime.org/community/thread/35034
2010-07-08T21:19:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	you have followed all those possible steps?
2010-07-08T21:20:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	if you have openfire working via the web, it's not an OS problem; it's likely a database problem
2010-07-08T21:21:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	when you go into mysql, you see the database you have created?
2010-07-08T21:23:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	ok. so when you reinstall openfire everytime, are you given the opportunity to set an admin password at all?
2010-07-08T21:24:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	have you ever tried installing mysql to work with openfire?
2010-07-08T21:29:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	i'm trying to think what could cause that. i would suggest not using the internal database when you're debugging, and instead use mysql. use the steps on this page: http://java-monitor.com/forum/showthread.php?t=453 to ensure that the password is the same in the database
2010-07-08T21:32:00.000Z	ozBoy	jjoohhnn	i did that still the same problem
2010-07-08T21:35:00.000Z	jjoohhnn	ozBoy	and when you go into the sql database, you can see that the password in that database is the same as the one you are typing in into the web interface?
2010-07-08T21:40:00.000Z	ozBoy	jjoohhnn	is there a way i can show you and let you have a go
