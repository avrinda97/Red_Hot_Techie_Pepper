2007-11-02T16:40:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	try in #apache or #php or whatever whatever language you feel like doing it in :)
2007-11-02T16:41:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 Thanks. :D
2007-11-02T18:24:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	Web browsers are not good ftp clients
2007-11-02T18:24:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	What addressa are you trying to connect to?
2007-11-02T18:25:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	141.165.208.62
2007-11-02T18:26:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 But that just sends you to the directory I configured in Apache.
2007-11-02T18:26:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	What happens if you try to ftp into 127.0.0.1
2007-11-02T18:27:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 Oho, it asks me for a username and password.  Except, the one I use on Ubuntu isn't working. ~.~
2007-11-02T18:27:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	Either your router doesnt support loopback connections, or your isp is blocking port 21
2007-11-02T18:31:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 Yup, its not in that list.  I don't think its started at all.
2007-11-02T18:33:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	Stuff?
2007-11-02T18:35:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	does `sudo invoke-rc.d proftpd start` give you any errors?
2007-11-02T18:36:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	Hmm, says it cannot start in both standalone and inetd mode.  Check my configuration.
2007-11-02T18:36:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	Check your configuration.  I believe theres a proftpd channel, either #proftp or #proftpd
2007-11-02T18:38:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	I'm not sure, but proftpd users might be seperate from the system ysers.
2007-11-02T18:38:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 Okay, I can check on that.
2007-11-06T19:09:00.000Z	Pici	Caleb_Estartes	Most FTP servers will show a brief banner when the user logs in.
2007-11-06T19:10:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 Gotcha, good point I didn't think about that.  I'm just trying to find a way to restrict users to their directories and such and not allow them to freely browse folders.  And I think I have to find the conf files for that ftp server.
2007-11-06T19:14:00.000Z	Caleb_Estartes	Pici	 Is there a chance that someone could use an FTP program to log in using the Open SSH server, instead of an FTP server?  Or... is there a 'default' FTP server installed with Ubuntu?
