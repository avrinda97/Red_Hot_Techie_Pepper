2010-08-27T06:32:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		is anyone around that can help me with a bluetooth issue?
2010-08-27T06:33:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		i installed a patched version of the bluetooth daemon and didn't realize the fix was already in my version. as such i have pooched my bluetooth and the daemon won't start. i can't figure out how to fix this
2010-08-27T06:33:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		what should i do?
2010-08-27T06:34:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Te3-BloodyIron	how did you install it?
2010-08-27T06:34:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		mind if i whisper you the howto i was following?

2010-08-27T06:34:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		i followed the second method at the beginning
2010-08-27T06:35:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		i got the patched version from the ppa source
2010-08-27T06:35:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		since hten it has failed to start and i have tried to reinstall bluetooth so many times in different ways
2010-08-27T06:35:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		:/
2010-08-27T06:36:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		kind of, I tried just removing the package, but also did the remove completely, inlcuding configurations
2010-08-27T06:36:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		i did not do ppa-purge, i manually removed the source from sources and removed the key
2010-08-27T06:36:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		and at one step i did an apt-get purge bluetooth
2010-08-27T06:36:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		er might have been bluez
2010-08-27T06:36:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		what does that do Dr_Willis?
2010-08-27T06:36:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		the ppa-purge
2010-08-27T06:37:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Te3-BloodyIron	remove the ppa entry from /etc/apt/sources.list and then: sudo apt-get update &&  sudo  apt-get install --reinstall bluez
2010-08-27T06:37:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron	ilovefairuz	the ppa entry i added earlier is not in there now
