2009-03-09T02:03:00.000Z	gabbah		i have ubuntu 8.10 installed. I want to run kde4.2. Should i reinstall to kubuntu 8.10 or is it practically the same to just install kde4.2 on the current installation? Can I still run all the programs like normal or what will happen?
2009-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	yes you can install kde
2009-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	everything will work fine
2009-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	gabbah	billybigrigger	but if i install kubuntu, doesn't in have different apps?
2009-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	when you get to the login screen you can change you session to either gnome or kde
2009-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	somewhat
2009-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	if your not ever going to use gnome again, you could reinstall kubuntu
2009-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	gabbah	billybigrigger	and are the apps bound to gnome or kde?
2009-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	but having them both co-exist is perfectly fine too
2009-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	no afaik you can use kde apps in gnome and gnome apps in kde, someone correct me if im wrong
2009-03-09T02:06:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	for example i use k3b (kde burning app) in gnome no probs, but thats about the only kde app i've tried
2009-03-09T02:06:00.000Z	gabbah	billybigrigger	the only con is that it will take up some more space to have gnome installed also.... no differance in performance right?
2009-03-09T02:06:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	correct
2009-03-09T02:07:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	but you will have both gnome and kde install so of course your taking up more room
2009-03-09T02:08:00.000Z	gabbah	billybigrigger	hmm but think i remember that if u want to run a kde app in gnome, you must install some kde libs as well.. and performance wouldn't be as good
2009-03-09T02:09:00.000Z	gabbah	billybigrigger	one more question. do u know what the differance is between the kubuntu download that is a cd 700 mb, and the dvd that is 3,2 gigs? (via bittorrent)
2009-03-09T02:10:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	just more packages on the dvd, use that if you have poopy internet connection, if you have fast internet, just get the iso and install whatever packages you need from apt
2009-03-09T02:11:00.000Z	gabbah	billybigrigger	Flannel hehe well i have 30Mbit connection so that's not a problem... the thing is i'm out of cds and have only dvds to burn on. can u burn a cd image on a dvd? :P
2009-03-09T02:11:00.000Z	billybigrigger	gabbah	yes you can burn a cd image on dvd
