2011-07-10T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Ruudjah	what version of ubuntu are you using ?
2011-07-10T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Ruudjah	firefox 5 is not packaged for 10.10
2011-07-10T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Ruudjah	please control the language
2011-07-10T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Ruudjah	if you have to star it out - just don't say it
2011-07-10T15:18:00.000Z	Ruudjah	ikonia	I dont understand why it's so hard to have a file download of ff5 which just works, though.
2011-07-10T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Ruudjah	because imagine there are 200+ linux distribtuions, all different, trying to make a package that works on all of them as 1 generic package is VERY hard
2011-07-10T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Ruudjah	mozilla make a generic build, ubuntu makes a specific one, however firefox has major implications to the build as it's intergrated into the desktop, so it's not easy to make such big version jumps
