2008-08-04T23:24:00.000Z	anto9us	phantomas	is that card a dvb card and are you sure tvtime supports dvb?
2008-08-04T23:24:00.000Z	phantomas	anto9us	it is analogue dvb and fm radio
2008-08-04T23:25:00.000Z	phantomas	anto9us	but nothing works
2008-08-04T23:25:00.000Z	phantomas		i have seen it but still i cant configure it
2008-08-04T23:26:00.000Z	phantomas	anto9us	backuup any ideas?

2008-08-04T23:27:00.000Z	phantomas	anto9us	i ve seen that
2008-08-04T23:27:00.000Z	phantomas		but i still cant configure it
2008-08-04T23:28:00.000Z	anto9us	phantomas	ok, I'd suggest tryin ubuntu forums, my guess is you'll be lucky to get support for such a specific issue in IRC
2008-08-04T23:29:00.000Z	phantomas	anto9us	there are many topics in forums for the SAME card but none of them ends with a solution
2008-08-04T23:30:00.000Z	phantomas		so i came here...
2008-08-04T23:31:00.000Z	anto9us	phantomas	I'd still suggest you'd have more hope there or on launchpad than here
2008-08-04T23:31:00.000Z	phantomas	anto9us	yes i can see it :p
