2008-11-22T15:41:00.000Z	bazhang	transporter	normally you drag them to the theme manager; not all themes are well written though and the page you downloaded from may have instructions
2008-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	bazhang	transporter	you could extract from the archive; though it really depends on the theme in question
