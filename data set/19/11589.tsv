2006-01-17T15:56:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	you should do it like this:    for i in *.zip; do gunzip "$i"; done
2006-01-17T15:58:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	if you want to do it for all zip files in subdirectories, too, you can:    find . -type f -name '*.zip' | while read x; do gunzip "$x"; done
2006-01-17T15:58:00.000Z	cello_rasp	dooglus	you made my day.
2006-01-17T15:59:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	it's worth remembering those 2 as templates.  they come in very handy for operating on lots of files
2006-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	install package 'cdrdao" by running "sudo apt-get install cdrdao" in a terminal
2006-01-17T16:07:00.000Z	cello_rasp	dooglus	i don't know why but i still get "suffix ignored" with "find . -type f -name '*.zip' | while read x; do gunzip "$x"; done"
2006-01-17T16:08:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	try this:   find . -type f -name '*.zip'  | while read x; do echo gunzip $x; gunzip "$x"; done
2006-01-17T16:08:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	then you'll see the gunzip commands printed before they're run, and have more idea of what's going wrong.
2006-01-17T16:09:00.000Z	cello_rasp	dooglus	thanks, very much noted
2006-01-17T16:09:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	try it, and paste the line that appears just before the error message
2006-01-17T16:10:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	I'm being an idiot...  gunzip isn't for unzipped .zip files - it's for uncompressing .gz files.  that's your problem!
2006-01-17T16:12:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	find -type f -name '*.zip' | while read x; do unzip "$x"; done
2006-01-21T16:49:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	if you just want to play them, give the .bin file to mplayer directly.
2006-01-21T16:52:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	he means "bchunk"
2006-01-22T09:50:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	I don't use thunderbird, so I'm not sure, but try ~/.mozilla/thunderbird/
2006-01-22T09:50:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	that's a guess based on the fact that firefox stores its stuff in ~/.mozilla/firefox...
2006-01-22T09:55:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	unmount with "umount /mount/point" and eject with eject?
2006-01-22T09:56:00.000Z	cello_rasp	dooglus	not responding... argh
2006-01-22T09:56:00.000Z	dooglus	cello_rasp	?
