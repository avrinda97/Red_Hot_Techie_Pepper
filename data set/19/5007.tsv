2008-10-05T14:24:00.000Z	Cheeky	ompaul	i mentioned that i upgraded to flash 10 from flash 9 .. but i installed uvc like teh doc ..i just dunno where to go .. yeah think you guys want but i just came here to get my web cam to work and sorry i didnt address your questions
2008-10-05T14:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Cheeky	you upgrade something, it breaks what you want working, you know it did, you got to drop flash 10 then, does that make sense, cos if it does it is what bazhang told you already, I pointed you at the web cam howto page so I think it is highly unfair of you to expect us to help you with you don't tell us all the story from the off, pulling teeth would be easier than getting to the point with you, now go remove that flash 10 put back 9 if it
2008-10-05T14:31:00.000Z	Cheeky	ompaul	ompaul i dont think you under stand ..l yes it might be my flash .. but then again .. ubuntu finf the usb connection  ID 046d:08c1 Logitech, Inc.  but i need to install it and i dunno how to run uvc or wat not to see if it even works before i reverse back to flash nine ..  inatalling flash 10 resolved alot of my problems but i also want to keep it and install my web can .. the OS detects it i just dont know how to install it or
