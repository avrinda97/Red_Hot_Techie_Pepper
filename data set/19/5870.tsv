2008-09-12T14:42:00.000Z	AzizLight		hi everybody
2008-09-12T14:43:00.000Z	AzizLight		I wanted to know, is there an ubuntu equivalent to the enso launcher available on windows?
2008-09-12T14:44:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	enso launcher?
2008-09-12T14:44:00.000Z	AzizLight	airtonix	http://humanized.com/enso/launcher/
2008-09-12T14:45:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	try gnomedo
2008-09-12T14:45:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	sudo apt-get install gnomedo
2008-09-12T14:46:00.000Z	AzizLight	airtonix	I have gnomedo but gnomedo is more like quicksilver. Enso launcher is very different
2008-09-12T14:46:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	ok looking deeper at enso
2008-09-12T14:47:00.000Z	AzizLight	airtonix	you should try it if you have a windows machine, it's really amazing, it gives a real productivity boost
2008-09-12T14:47:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	am doin now i have win2003 on virtualbox
2008-09-12T14:48:00.000Z	AzizLight	airtonix	win2003? you mean xp?
2008-09-12T14:48:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	win2003 server
2008-09-12T14:52:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	ok installing now check this baby out
2008-09-12T15:00:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	mm seems it does quite a bit of intergration with the OS
2008-09-12T15:01:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	i dont think there actually is something in linux that does what enso does
2008-09-12T15:01:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	closest would be yaquake or tilda
2008-09-12T15:12:00.000Z	AzizLight	airtonix	sorry I just saw your message. I have yakuake, it's a pretty awesome app, I use it all the time but it's a terminal not a launcher. I guess I'll have to wait the Enso 2.0 (which supposedly will be cross platform...I think..I hope ...lol)
2008-09-12T15:13:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	yeah it does look great. would be great to have on openbox setup
2008-10-01T23:07:00.000Z	airtonix	AzizLight	to logout of gnome cia terminal it is : sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
