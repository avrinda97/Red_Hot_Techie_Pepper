2007-10-18T18:57:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
2007-10-18T18:57:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	after that: 7z x emerald
2007-10-18T18:57:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	if that doesn't work try: 7za x emerald
2007-10-18T18:58:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	thanks... I just renamed the file to .tar.gz and it worked
2007-10-18T18:58:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	ok :)
2007-10-18T18:58:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	do you know why the emerald-themes package is no longer in Synaptic?
2007-10-18T18:59:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	no idea
2007-10-18T18:59:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	hmmm..... its really silly because you can get emerald but with no themes....
2007-10-18T19:01:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	a simple google search 'emerald themes' solves that: http://themes.beryl-project.org/themes.php?cat=6
2007-10-18T19:02:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	yah... I know you can manually install themes... but before you would get a slew of them bundled...
2007-10-18T19:02:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	I think you're supposed to import the themes with the import button, not to extract them yourself
2007-10-18T19:02:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	anyhow ... I love Gutsy.....
2007-10-18T19:02:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	have you had any experience with the screen extension feature?
2007-10-18T19:03:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	run this: emerald-theme-manager and click on the import button
2007-10-18T19:03:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	no idea what screen extension is
2007-10-18T19:03:00.000Z	savvas		:)
2007-10-18T19:04:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	I am trying not to use emerald becasue it was unstable on my system
2007-10-18T19:04:00.000Z	savvas	zetheroo	then why do you complain about the emerald-themes? :P
2007-10-18T19:05:00.000Z	zetheroo	savvas	because its a minus and not a plus..... 'tis all....
