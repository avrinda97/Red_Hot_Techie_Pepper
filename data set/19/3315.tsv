2009-09-14T04:20:00.000Z	Fizban140		problem after problem after problem after problem for four days now, that is all I have got from linux
2009-09-14T04:21:00.000Z	Fizban140		too much to explain
2009-09-14T04:21:00.000Z	Fizban140		no one here can help me
2009-09-14T04:21:00.000Z	Fizban140		not even sure why I am her actually
2009-09-14T04:23:00.000Z	Fizban140		I have so many problems with Linux I am not sure which one to start with
2009-09-14T04:24:00.000Z	Fizban140		I have no free space on my drive because I auto installed ubuntu netbook remix and it only used 30 mb of free space after the OS install even though I have 160 gb free. After that I tried to get flash working, I followed a guide and installed restricted files and now firefox crashes when it attempts to use flash
2009-09-14T04:25:00.000Z	Fizban140		so I have to reinstall ubuntu to get more space on the disc and then I have to install my network drivers off an SD card because moblin bricked my flash drive and then I can attempt to get flash working
2009-09-14T04:25:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	try "easy peasy" :)
2009-09-14T04:25:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	I like it over the netbook remix
2009-09-14T04:42:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	just reinstall
2009-09-14T04:42:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	and Id really give easy peasy a try, it comes with non-free stuff included
2009-09-14T04:44:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	sure
2009-09-14T04:44:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	since I have a bit more experience, Id chose the "manual" option for partitioning
2009-09-14T04:44:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	id drop the old 30GB partition
2009-09-14T04:45:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	then create 2 new primary partitions
2009-09-14T04:45:00.000Z	tilt	Fizban140	one big one for the linux and a smaller one, like 2GB oslt for swap
