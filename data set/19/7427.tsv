2007-10-04T07:37:00.000Z	steel_lady		magnet yes I am and it happened to me after I uppgraded. I didn't have so many problems in previous versions
2007-10-04T07:39:00.000Z	steel_lady		magnet I had problems upgrading, at the end I think I did it from CD but I am not sure. It asks for a CD often when I want to reinstall something or do some special operation. it reminds me of win this way
2007-10-04T07:41:00.000Z	steel_lady		magnet suddenly something happened

2007-10-04T07:45:00.000Z	steel_lady		magnet I am going to get a heart attack
2007-10-04T07:45:00.000Z	steel_lady		magnet rather tell me what can I do. And btw, the USB light is on, how can I remove the card safely?
2007-10-04T07:46:00.000Z	steel_lady		magnet I have Dell Inspiron 6400
2007-10-04T07:47:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	the 6400/E1505 have a problem with the power regulation system, it's a $500 repair and not covered under warranty in most cases.
2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	steel_lady	Downix	which kind of problem and how does it affect the comp?
2007-10-04T07:49:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	If you start getting odd switching between AC/battery, it's a sign that the system is on it's way out.  Basically, there's a small power-control system on the motherboard that sometimes goes bad.  When it does, it will not recognize when an AC adaptor is plugged up at all.  Means once the battery is dead, you have a nice paperweight.  Found out the hard way, have a paperweight here.
2007-10-04T07:50:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	Has nothing to do with your current problem, just something to watch out for in the future.  How many RAM sticks do you have installed?
2007-10-04T07:52:00.000Z	steel_lady	Downix	I went for an offer of double RAM for half price so I suppose 2 og 512MB
2007-10-04T07:53:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	Likely one of those is the culpret.  If you're under warranty, have them swap it.  If not, take one out, try it, if it still dumps, switch to the other and check that one.  If both dump, then it's somewhere else.
2007-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	after this system, I gave up on Dell laptops.
2007-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	very odd
2007-10-04T07:58:00.000Z	Downix	steel_lady	Oh, phew, much simpler problem
