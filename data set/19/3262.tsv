2011-06-11T14:02:00.000Z	rly		Can I see somewhere how a default sudoers file looks like in Ubuntu?
2011-06-11T14:02:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	Basically, it's %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
2011-06-11T14:02:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	With a bunch of comments.
2011-06-11T14:02:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	thanks
2011-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	You should be able to select the language on the login screen, and there is System -> Preferences -> Language Support
2011-06-12T15:11:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	I did both those things.
2011-06-12T15:12:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	Weird
2012-02-19T20:12:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	I say -- disable services you don't need. NetworkManager takes ages to start on my machine for instance.
2012-02-19T20:20:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	If it's Upstart troubling you, you can probably switch away to runit or systemd
2012-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	Are you sure your hard drive ain't failing?
2012-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	dmesg doesn't say so.
2012-02-19T20:26:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	Do you experience this on other OS's/distros? This is an important part.
2012-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	I don't think I have it on Windows, which is also installed on it.
2012-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	but its FS is much smaller.
2012-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	nor do I almost never use it.
2012-02-19T20:57:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	have you seen my numbers?
2012-02-19T20:57:00.000Z	theadmin	rly	Yeah, sorry, no ideas
2012-02-19T20:57:00.000Z	rly	theadmin	boot time is 2.5 minutes and actually logging in to a session is an additional 40 seconds or so.
