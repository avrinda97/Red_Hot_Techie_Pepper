2009-07-06T22:07:00.000Z	ishkur		hey all, when im trying to upgrade my sys, it says cant install 'ubuntu-desktop' please report this as a bug. what should i do next?
2009-07-06T22:07:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	could you paste your sources.list ?
2009-07-06T22:09:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	open a terminal ...
2009-07-06T22:09:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2009-07-06T22:10:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-07-06T22:10:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	copy the url from trml in here
2009-07-06T22:14:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	your sources.list ?
2009-07-06T22:18:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	is there a reason for you having backports enabled ? in which circumstance you get your error ?
2009-07-06T22:19:00.000Z	ishkur	DasEi1	backports? i get the error when ubuntu tries to update itself
2009-07-06T22:20:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	you got several foreign sources, like backports of (!dapper) older ones in, that could be the problem; unless for a certain reason, on jaunty use standard for that
2009-07-06T22:21:00.000Z	ishkur	DasEi1	so if i edit the backports out i should b ok?
2009-07-06T22:22:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	As you don't seem to know about their existance, backup old sources list, and use the one comin' in a moment
2009-07-06T22:23:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	(in trml) sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list  /etc/apt/sources.listBackup
2009-07-06T22:25:00.000Z	ishkur	DasEi1	done
2009-07-06T22:26:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	it's really a wierd mixture you got there, you may consider backup other stuff from your sys too, lot's of dapper-sources in it

2009-07-06T22:32:00.000Z	ishkur	DasEi1	so if i replace my sources list with that one i should be ok?
2009-07-06T22:33:00.000Z	DasEi1	ishkur	I think so, though I'm not shure for every little typo, to compare, here is my working jaunty one : http://paste.ubuntu.com/211422/
2009-07-06T22:33:00.000Z	ishkur	DasEi1	thanks for help will try that
