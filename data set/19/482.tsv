2012-02-01T13:33:00.000Z	callaghan		Hi, is there a quick way to find out if a user is running X/L/K/Ubuntu using the command line? I want to use it for a bash script. Thanks
2012-02-01T13:34:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	use: cat /etc/issue
2012-02-01T13:35:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	Sorry, that doesn;t seem to contain the info you want...
2012-02-01T13:35:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	This says Ubuntu 11.10 \n \l on my Lubuntu system...
2012-02-01T13:36:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	well, I guess there is no easy way apart from looking if lxde or unity is running ;)
2012-02-01T13:36:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	How about /etc/lsb-release
2012-02-01T13:36:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	same here, only Ubuntu
2012-02-01T13:39:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	maybe try "cd /etc; grep -R Lubuntu" to see if there's a file which has the distro name
2012-02-01T13:41:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	whoa, that's taking a long time ^^
2012-02-01T13:42:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	It'll finish :)  Maybe add " | less" at the end to be able to scroll trhough the output
2012-02-01T13:42:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	and make sure you are in /etc :)
2012-02-01T13:46:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	I used "cd /etc; grep -R Lubuntu | tee ~/output" so it should to the job... no, nothing's in there ^^
2012-02-01T13:47:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	ah well, I guess the user has to select what he is running then. Thank you for your time :)
2012-02-01T13:47:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	Are you sure you're on Lubuntu? :) It should read
2012-02-01T13:47:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	welcome.
2012-02-01T13:48:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	Skip the "It should read"
2012-02-01T13:48:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	yeah, I'm sure, I also have a xubuntu machine where the command is still running
2012-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	Smelly	callaghan	weird that it doesn't show up in issue at least... Well, good luck
2012-02-01T13:50:00.000Z	callaghan	Smelly	it shows up in /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/desktop.conf I can check if this path exists.
