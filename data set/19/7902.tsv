2007-09-17T07:32:00.000Z	tim167		hello, I have an external cdrw/dvdr drive that won't show up in browser. k3b shows error: "Cdrecord has no permission to open the device", lsusb shows the cdrw at : "Bus 004 Device 010: ID 046e:300f Behavior Tech. Computer Corp", can anyone help me ? thanks
2007-09-17T07:32:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	please post your /etc/fstab to pastebin.org
2007-09-17T07:33:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	coming up...
2007-09-17T07:36:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	here's my /etc/fstab http://www.pastebin.org/2602 (my question was how to get external cdrw working)
2007-09-17T07:39:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	make sure you are a member of the CDROM group
2007-09-17T07:39:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	how do i become a memner of that group ?
2007-09-17T07:40:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	yes, but verify that group name. I'm on winblows atm
2007-09-17T07:42:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	what are the permissions of the folder where your cdrom is mounting, and who owns it?
2007-09-17T07:42:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	i cannot see any mount in the filebrowser
2007-09-17T07:42:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	for the CDROM i mean....
2007-09-17T07:43:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	sudo mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom
2007-09-17T07:43:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	 mount: No medium found
2007-09-17T07:43:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	sounds like a driver issue. Has this cdrom ever worked for you in linux?
2007-09-17T07:44:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	nope
2007-09-17T07:47:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	so should i put the cdrw in the garbage ? or is there a way to get it working on linux ?
2007-09-17T07:48:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	report it on launchpad
2007-09-17T07:48:00.000Z	RAdams	tim167	include your troubleshooting steps, and also post in the hardware section of the forum. search first.
2007-09-17T07:49:00.000Z	tim167	RAdams	unfortunately i have no time for that now...too bad, another peice of hw that i cant use outside of windoze :(
