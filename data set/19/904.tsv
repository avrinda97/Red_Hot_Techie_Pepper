2011-07-30T16:16:00.000Z	chilversc		gah, stupid nvidia drivers, once again it locks up right after "PulseAudio configured for per-user sessions"
2011-07-30T16:18:00.000Z	chilversc		so, SLI and NVidia, is there anything I should be aware of?
2011-07-30T16:20:00.000Z	chilversc		because at the moment I'm seeing "(EE) NVIDIA(GPU-1): Failed to initialize the NVIDIA GPU at PCI:4:0:0" in xorg.0.log
2011-07-30T16:21:00.000Z	chilversc		and the tail from dmesg shows, "NVRM: RmInitAdapter failed! (0x26:0xffffffff:1050)"
2011-07-30T16:22:00.000Z	chilversc		hmm, seems nvidia drivers might have a problem with SLI and SMP? something to do with MMCONFIG?
2011-07-30T16:23:00.000Z	chilversc		just looking at this, http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-technical-help-here/hardware/459337-failed-initialize-second-nvidia-gpu-opensuse-11-4-a.html
2011-07-30T16:23:00.000Z	chilversc		does that apply to ubuntu as well?
2011-07-30T16:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	chilversc	 if its more of a kernel/driver/X version type bug. it would most likelyu applyu to all linux's using the same stuff
2011-07-30T16:24:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	that's what I thought, but I have no idea what mmconfig is, or the implications of altering it
2011-07-30T16:25:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	it seems like that is disabling smp or the other cores to make it work?
2011-07-30T16:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	chilversc	 seems a little pointless to disable your cpu to get more gpu. :)  sounds like a serious bug if thats the case.
2011-07-30T16:26:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	yeah, I'd rather disable the extra GPU :)
2011-07-30T16:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	chilversc	 but i dont see the point in SLI really.
2011-07-30T16:27:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	I got an 295, it does make a difference there since the 2 cores are on the same board
2011-07-30T16:27:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	but they use the same SLI tech to handle the 2 cores
2011-12-11T00:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	chilversc	 'metacity --replace' normally
2011-12-11T00:27:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	yes, but where does one run that if metacity isn't running?
2011-12-11T00:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	chilversc	 any terminal, or cosole. after using 'export DISPLAY=0.0'
2011-12-11T00:28:00.000Z	chilversc	dr_willis	ah right, and how do I run it in such away its not attached to the current process? the same way it does when its launched via whatever starts X?
