2007-05-12T16:52:00.000Z	Huffameg		My DVDplayer doesn't work properly.. (I use Totem) when I put in a DVD it will start playing directly without the menus and if I stop the player and press "Play Disc" to do it again it will just tell me that I'm lacking a component or a plugin or something..
2007-05-12T16:52:00.000Z	Huffameg		I have tried Ogle, but that doesn't work at all..
2007-05-12T16:52:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	see the howtos ubotu threw at you :-)
2007-05-12T05:14:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	are they sitting on the couch and refuse to raise when you tell them to, or waht?
2007-05-12T05:17:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	well.. the thing is that none of the players i've tried (totem, ogle, gxine) seems to able to play my dvds.. ogle just disappears, gxine cannot locate anything and totem tells me that it does not exist a plugin to handle my dvd.. the strange thing is that, when having totem installed, when i put in a dvd it will just start directly but without the menus and subtitles.. as soon as i press "play disc" to restart it, it just stops..
2007-05-12T05:19:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	have you installed libdvdcss ? You know, the little thingy that handles the DeCSS stuff, which will allow you to watch DVDs in Linux,
2007-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	yes I think so.. but it will play - as long as I do not tell it to do so..
2007-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	try vlc ... totem sucks anyway IMHO
2007-05-12T05:21:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	ok i'll try..
2007-05-12T05:28:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	there's no picture and the sound is jumping..
2007-05-12T05:29:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	is MDA enabled for your DVD-drive?
2007-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	do i need anything other than a player and the libdvdread3?
2007-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	yes. you need libdvdcss2
2007-05-12T05:33:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	and because this hacks the CSS protection it's not in official repos
2007-05-12T05:33:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	okay.. where do i find it then..
2007-05-12T05:34:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	read the !DVD factoid again (which was the first thing i gave you :-) )
2007-05-12T05:35:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	yes.. it doesn't mention anything other than libdvdread3
2007-05-12T05:35:00.000Z	Huffameg	stefg	ahaa
2007-05-12T05:35:00.000Z	stefg	Huffameg	pleeeeaaassseee...
