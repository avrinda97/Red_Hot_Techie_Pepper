2008-05-25T23:49:00.000Z	Ienorand		If buying a lappy for the coming years, should one go for ATI or NVIDIA?
2008-05-25T23:49:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	Intel ;)
2008-05-25T23:51:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	Yea, but I'm intending to dual-boot XP for some kind of gaming performance, which afaik, you can't really get with intel?
2008-05-25T23:51:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	X3500 is pretty sweet but if you are a hardcore gamer you won't be happy
2008-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	Hmm, X3500 is for desktops, for lappy I'm stuck wiv X3100 if I'm going Intel.
2008-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	I just got a thinkpad t61 with x3100 ;)
2008-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	which afaik is kinda crappy...
2008-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	Oh how does it run?
2008-05-26T00:07:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	Have you tried anything intenser on it?
2008-05-26T00:07:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	I don't game really so it's more than enough, good enough for games which are a few years old or normal 3d stuff, or compiz even
2008-05-26T00:07:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	google earth runs great ;)
2008-05-26T00:08:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	but to me it's more important to not deal with proprietary driver problems
2008-05-26T00:10:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	Okay, well I was thinking of being able to play at least some of the current games... at the point of giving up to proprietary stuff.
2008-05-26T00:10:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	it's a tough call since nvidia works better now but ati has committed to open-source support
2008-05-26T00:10:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	But would you say any of ati/nvidia is a lesser evil?
2008-05-26T00:11:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	Yea, and then ati might be good in the future... or not...
2008-05-26T00:13:00.000Z	Ienorand	astro76	anyhow, thanks for yar comments, much appreciated : )
2008-05-26T00:13:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	I'd say nvidia since it works better now, also going by what they put in thinkpads which are all linux supported, vidia
2008-05-26T00:13:00.000Z	astro76	Ienorand	in fact, I'd recommend a thinkpad :P
