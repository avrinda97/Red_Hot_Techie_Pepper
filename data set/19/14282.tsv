2004-10-01T09:13:00.000Z	chutwig		you'll have to tell me what those options do, i'm on a mac right now
2004-10-01T09:15:00.000Z	chutwig		should he need to reboot?
2004-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	chutwig		i'm thinking he could modprobe it in right there
2004-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	chutwig		lucky for me i have a 7-year-old rage 128
2004-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	chutwig		no worries for me, i hope
2004-10-01T09:18:00.000Z	chutwig		this desk is nowhere near large enough for 2 keyboards :(
2004-10-01T09:18:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	heh, try two monitors, two laptops, and two keyboards ...
2004-10-01T09:44:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	uh, it's in the default $PATH in Debian too
2004-10-01T09:44:00.000Z	chutwig	Kamion	er, i'm thinking of the sbin directories
2004-10-01T10:50:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/download/mirror/document_view
2004-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	chutwig	Kamion	well, i'm just a student, so i can't really do it myself :)
2004-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	oh, "here" != this IRC channel then :)
2004-10-02T13:34:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	dpkg has md5sums files (see debsums)
2004-10-02T13:35:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	they aren't quite in every package, but they're in most of them
2004-10-02T13:37:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	usually you want to edit /var/lib/dpkg/info/<whatever>.postrm, that's the main one that tends to cause an issue
2004-10-02T13:37:00.000Z	chutwig	Kamion	i shall note it for future reference
2004-10-02T13:38:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	mind you, if there were a --force-continue-on-maintscript-error or whatever then it would certainly be abused, people would hose their systems and then file bugs ...
2004-10-02T13:39:00.000Z	chutwig	Kamion	i don't doubt it
2004-10-02T13:39:00.000Z	Kamion	chutwig	it's very good for everything except the postrm
