2011-01-12T19:39:00.000Z	Lxndr		I am attempting to RDP from my home computer (ubuntu 10.10) to my work computer (windows xp). My workplace has graciously provided me with instructions to connect (assuming I have windows) which include a server name and the 'name of my computer' both of which are apparently necessary. However, I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to make this happen in ubuntu. Could anyone, with enough patience, walk me through the steps?
2011-01-12T19:40:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	yes i can
2011-01-12T19:40:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	use the terminal server client
2011-01-12T19:40:00.000Z	glaceman		it's like RDP
2011-01-12T19:40:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	located under applications --> internet
2011-01-12T19:41:00.000Z	Lxndr	glaceman	Whenever I attempt that, I get an error. "getaddrinfo: Name or service not known." I cannot find anything called getaddrinfo in the package manager. Any ideas?
2011-01-12T19:41:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	are u sure both machines can ping themselves ?
2011-01-12T19:44:00.000Z	glaceman		hi coonky
2011-01-12T19:45:00.000Z	Lxndr	glaceman	Ugh. Looks like I am unable to ping the host my workplace has supplied. (Oddly, my workplace doesn't seem to have anything that will reply to ping attempts, even their website)
2011-01-12T19:46:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	depends on websites sometimes ping is disabled , but can u please give me the ip if it's a website i will try
2011-01-12T19:47:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	did u checked ur firewall settings ?
2011-01-12T19:48:00.000Z	Lxndr	glaceman	As far as I'm aware, there's no firewall here. My landlord doesn't seem to have created one. Is there any way to check?
2011-01-12T19:49:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	can u please tell me a little bit more about ur situation ? as i undertood, ur running ubuntu trying to acces win xp by RDP right ! ? ...
2011-01-12T19:50:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	is it a local network ?
2011-01-12T19:51:00.000Z	Lxndr	glaceman	Yes, I am running ubuntu trying to access windows xp by RDP. My workplace gave me instructions on how to set up windows to rdp in - this includes an address (remoteaccess.sunqustinfo.com) as well as a 'computer name.' It's not local - I'm at home, windows computer is at work.
2011-01-12T19:51:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	do u have a firewall at work like
2011-01-12T19:52:00.000Z	glaceman	Lxndr	"like isa server:" not configure properly
2011-01-12T19:53:00.000Z	Lxndr	glaceman	I don't have a firewall on my personal work computer. As far as the work's network, I'm pretty sure there's *something*. But at the same time, these are the directions my workplace has given me. Would it help if I emailed you the instruction document? (It's *.doc)
2011-01-12T19:58:00.000Z	Lxndr	glaceman	Did I lose you? Sorry I'm not as fully versed with my situation as I'd like.
