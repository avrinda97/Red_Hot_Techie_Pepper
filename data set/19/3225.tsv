2009-10-01T10:10:00.000Z	Ximbinha		TRY ADD SOMEONE IN SKYPE TO SEE>
2009-10-01T10:10:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	Odd...Skype works fine for me
2009-10-01T10:11:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	Skype has a Debian package available for Ubuntu, and it works just fine
2009-10-01T10:11:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	Yes, you can
2009-10-01T10:12:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	It works fine for everyone else in this room...And there is an icon on the bottom of the skype main window that shortcuts to the add a contact wizard
2009-10-01T10:13:00.000Z	Ximbinha	mnaines	this doesn't works.
2009-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	Go down where it says "Call Phones or SMS" on the main window of Skype...Right below that you will see a green circle with a plus and a person icon...That is the Add a Contact button
2009-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	Ximbinha	mnaines	this works for adding but you wouldn't see anyone online.
2009-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	Because its just like adding a person in instant messenger...They also have to add you to their list before you can see them online...When you add someone that way, it sends them a message asking if they want to accept the add invite...They have to accept it before you can see them online
2009-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Ximbinha	mnaines	I know
2009-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	Probably because they haven't accepted your add invite perhaps?
2009-10-01T10:16:00.000Z	Ximbinha	mnaines	no!
2009-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	I am going to say the same thing everyone else is saying...If it doesn't work, then don't use it...That should be a no-brainer
2009-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	Ximbinha	mnaines	DON'T LIE TO PEOPLE
2009-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	What am I lying about?
2009-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	It is working fine for me...
2009-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	mnaines	Ximbinha	I have not had any problems with using Skype in Ubuntu
