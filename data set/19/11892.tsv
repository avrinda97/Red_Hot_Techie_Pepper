2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	loseweight		im inside the document
2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	loseweight		how to exit and save
2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	loseweight		none of them work
2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	loseweight		im still inside the vi editor
2011-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	loseweight		it doesn't
2011-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	loseweight		at the same time?
2011-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	sequentially
2011-04-30T16:57:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	do you see the cursor blinking ? is in the the text somewhere or in the footer (like a status bar) of vi ?
2011-04-30T16:57:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	vi is vi everywhere
2011-04-30T16:58:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	then press ESC some three times (just in case)
2011-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	just right... and the ZZ or wq or qhatever you type will be a command to vi
2011-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	ZZ = wq = Write and Quit
2011-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	if you close without save, yes, you lose
2011-04-30T17:02:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	when you learn to use vi (vim) you then tend to use it, cause its great
2011-04-30T17:03:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	loseweight	but its really not easy the first time you try it...
