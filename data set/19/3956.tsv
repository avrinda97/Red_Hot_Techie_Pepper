2009-09-28T21:46:00.000Z	pw-toxic		hi, where can i set up some advanced sound options? my bass is to great
2009-09-28T21:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	gnome-volume-control ?
2009-09-28T21:48:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	where can i find this?
2009-09-28T21:48:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	it's also somewhere in system menus, but do alt+f2 and run it
2009-09-28T21:49:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	hm you can only adjust volume there ;(
2009-09-28T21:50:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	ok, check system > preferences > sound maybe that gives options; also you can set there what volumes you wish to control with volume-control iirc
2009-09-28T21:50:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	hm i know all these... i was hoping there was something more advanced.. you have to know that i own a X-FI soundcard ;)
2009-09-28T21:51:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	pulse or alsa?
2009-09-28T21:51:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	eh how do i find out? i just konw that i have installed the proprietary creative drivers which are kinda new
2009-09-28T21:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	then it's the default ubuntu sound, which is pulse. Too bad, I had a alsa-config in which you could dim bass
2009-09-28T21:52:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	you know good drivers for my x-fi? ;)
2009-09-28T21:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	try to find a pulse audio config file in which you can tweak stuff
2009-09-28T21:52:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	i guess x-fi only works with the ones from crreative
2009-09-28T21:53:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	not really, there are sites for that
2009-09-28T21:53:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	when i open the volume manager i can choose the device, that it says "Creative X-FI (Alsa Mixer)
2009-09-28T21:54:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	alsa is a different way to manage sound in ubuntu, some prefer that; there is also oss but pulse-audio is default
2009-09-28T21:54:00.000Z	VCoolio	pw-toxic	to switch to another is a bit complex, I don't want to screw your box
2009-09-28T21:54:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	hm i think i'll try to fix this by hardware
2009-09-28T21:56:00.000Z	pw-toxic	VCoolio	thanks for you help
