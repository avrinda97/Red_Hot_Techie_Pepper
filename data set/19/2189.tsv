2010-06-02T08:47:00.000Z	FluxD		Anyone know what option I use in audacity to record from speakers ?
2010-06-02T08:48:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	speakers don't have recording devices... Be more specific what do you want to do?
2010-06-02T08:49:00.000Z	AudicaLive_		Hey pheonix. good to see you're back
2010-06-02T08:49:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	ok then how would I record what I hear from my speakers
2010-06-02T08:50:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	you need to take a double male ended 8th inch stereo cord, and connect one end to your audio out (headphone) jack, and one to your line in (mic) jack. Then press play in whatever program is playing through your speakers, and record in audacity
2010-06-02T08:50:00.000Z	AudicaLive_		8th inch is your standard headphone cable size.
2010-06-02T08:51:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	GuyCanada, on windows I use audacity and I dont have to use any of this Its the stereo or line out option I think
2010-06-02T08:51:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	that's because it's recording directly from your built in Mic, which is gonna sound like crap
2010-06-02T08:51:00.000Z	AudicaLive_		phoenix, do an lspci and a pastebin.
2010-06-02T08:52:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	audacity on windows records from mic ?
2010-06-02T08:53:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	first off, Audacity Sucks. I'm a recording engineer, I do this daily.  What are you trying to record from your speakers? And yes, by default Audacity in Windows will record from the built in mic because nothing is plugged into your line in Jack. The (Windows version of audacity at least ) program runs a check when you start it if anything is plugged in, and if not, it defaults to the mic.
2010-06-02T08:54:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	whats an alternative to audacity on linux then ?
2010-06-02T08:54:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	I am trying to record a music from a flash stream
2010-06-02T08:55:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	this is gonna give you a very airy, distorted sound, it'll sound like you're on an old cell phone. If you absolutely have to use Audacity, record using the cable I mentioned earlier. It's the only way to get remotely clear audio from what would normally be coming from your speakers. My guess is you're trying to record from an internet radio or youtube. If so (watch whether or not this is legal, which varies upon different
2010-06-02T08:55:00.000Z	AudicaLive_		 sites) that's the way you'd get the best quality
2010-06-02T08:56:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	an alternative to audacity on linux ?
2010-06-02T08:57:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	that's what I figured. Audacity would suffice for that. though I would use  Ardour 2 if you're ok with using something kinda complicated. It's an equivalent to ProTools on Windows or OSX (to a degree.)
2010-06-02T08:58:00.000Z	FluxD	AudicaLive_	GuyCanada thanks
2010-06-02T08:58:00.000Z	AudicaLive_	FluxD	no wories
