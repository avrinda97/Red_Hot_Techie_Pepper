2007-09-16T13:55:00.000Z	rathel		Amarok crashed on my, and I have amarokapp <defunct> still in my process list, how do I kill it? I tried kill -s 9 but it didn't do anything.
2007-09-16T13:56:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	zombie ?  select to order by dependencies and kill the parent process
2007-09-16T13:56:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	kill what though? that's the only thing in the list thats related to amarok I think.
2007-09-16T13:57:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	how are you getting the list ? top ?  try the system monitor in the system > admin menu
2007-09-16T13:58:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	 I was using ps.
2007-09-16T13:59:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	Can't kill it from System monitor, I guess I have to restart then?
2007-09-16T13:59:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	from the system monitor,  check inthe display options to have displyed by dependencies
2007-09-16T14:01:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	ah gotcha.
2007-09-16T14:02:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	Still can't kill it's dep. :(
2007-09-16T14:03:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	 no not kill the dep , kill the parrent  you might have to select view all processes
2007-09-16T14:03:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	it's parent is amarokapp, I can't kill it.
2007-09-16T14:04:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	I guess you'll have to restart then
2008-04-13T05:43:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	try ls > filename that might out put a text file with the content, not sure it if work s
2008-04-13T05:46:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	That's not what men, sorry for not making it clearer, I want the entire directory listing up to the file like /home/user/folder/file.txt and to do that >> to a file.
2008-04-13T05:47:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	sorry I don'T understand
2008-04-13T05:48:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	  the command "ls" will list the content of the folder, ifyou want to see what is in a file you need to open that file,  if it is a text file  use gedit , or nano ,   nano /path/filename
2008-04-13T05:50:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	I know, I give up, I'll just do the entire directory listing to the file by hand,I was hoping for something easier. but It's fine.
2008-04-13T05:52:00.000Z	Pelo	rathel	 open a terminal,   cd to the folder you want  type ls > content.txt ,  then type nano conten.txt
2008-04-13T05:53:00.000Z	rathel	Pelo	Yeah I did it this way pwd >> ~/file.txt && ls >> ~/file.txt and combined them in vim. lol I suck.
