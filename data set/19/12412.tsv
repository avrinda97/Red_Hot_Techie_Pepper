2005-10-12T13:49:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	change defaults to user
2005-10-12T13:49:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	then unmount and mount -a
2005-10-12T13:53:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	I am sorry for beign ignorant, I type umount -a, and then it tells me all the devises are busy.
2005-10-12T13:54:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	sudo umount /wcwin and then mount -a after you edit /etc/fstab
2005-10-12T13:56:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	it just tells me the devise is busy. I've already edited fstab and replaced "defaults" with "user"
2005-10-12T13:56:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	can I just log-out and log in again... will that reset it for me?
2005-10-12T14:31:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	 "/dev/hda6  /wcwin vfat rw,users,uid=gid=1000 0 0" and restart your computer
2005-10-12T14:46:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	when I rebooted, I got some message: wrong fs type, or bad option and it had that 1000 thing in there as well.
2005-10-12T14:48:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	maybe your using ntfs
2005-10-12T14:48:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	uid=gid=weiers
2005-10-12T14:49:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	just to confirm: this is what is currently in my fstab
2005-10-12T14:49:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	type vfat
2005-10-12T14:49:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	 /dev/hda6   /wcwin   vfat  rw,users,uid=gid=1000  0  0
2005-10-12T14:50:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	... it says "command not found"
2005-10-12T14:53:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	just to confirm, must I edit fstab to say /dev/hda6   /wcwin   vfat  rw,users,uid=gid=weiers  0  0
2005-10-12T14:53:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	yes and remount  againt
2005-10-12T14:56:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	I get this error message:    mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda6,       missing codepage or other error       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try       dmesg | tail  or so
2005-10-12T14:59:00.000Z	joe_alf	weiers	try kbrooks idea maybe it will work for you and and remove uid=gid=?????
2005-10-12T15:11:00.000Z	weiers	joe_alf	kbrooks  .... I've now edited fstab to remove the uid=gid= ... thing, then I umounted /wcwin and mounted it again. Now it seems I have read and write access to all the data.  Now I wish I could understand what i really did so that I don't have to ask for assistance when I try to mount my ntfs drive :-)
