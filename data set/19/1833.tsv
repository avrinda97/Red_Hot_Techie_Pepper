2010-10-09T19:05:00.000Z	Braber01		Hi I just installed ubuntu netbook edtion and It confuses me because there's no minimize button or anything.
2010-10-09T19:06:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 right... you may have to watch some videos on this ... netbook takes a bit of getting used to after regular desktop edition
2010-10-09T19:07:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 but it isnt broken if that was your concern :)
2010-10-09T19:07:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 although...do you have your video card driver installed?
2011-02-23T09:35:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 the current for your version of ubuntu should already be installed
2011-02-23T09:35:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

2011-02-23T09:38:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 yes   in terminal also   gcc --version
2011-02-23T09:39:00.000Z	Braber01	coz_	I've tried the command to find out if it was installed, i.e "which" and it didn't return any locations.
2011-02-23T09:39:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 and did  gcc --version have a readout?
2011-02-23T09:40:00.000Z	coz_	Braber01	 ooooo
