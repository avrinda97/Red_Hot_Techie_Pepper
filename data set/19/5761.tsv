2008-07-21T03:00:00.000Z	sdtr443w		Did user management change in the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04?  The "Users and Groups" tool doesn't list any users.
2008-07-21T03:01:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	it changed in that it uses policykit now. Can you see/use the Unlock button?
2008-07-21T03:01:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	Yeah I'm unlocked.
2008-07-21T03:02:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	that's strange -- I think you may be looking at a bug
2008-07-21T03:04:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	I have some users listed in /etc/passwd.  One is my normal account and one is for svn, which is not formatted the same as my user account.  Maybe it's choking on that...
2008-07-21T03:12:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	your /etc/passwd seems to be messed up
2008-07-21T03:12:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	I'd say . . .
2008-07-21T03:12:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	do you want to put it up on a pastebin?
2008-07-21T03:14:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	my /etc/passwd is up at http://paste.ubuntu.com/28829/
2008-07-21T03:14:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	that's way too few entries
2008-07-21T03:15:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	yes, it would
2008-07-21T03:15:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	I'm thinking that user management tool nuked it TBH.  I was using sudo just before running that thing.
2008-07-21T03:17:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	hope you have a backup of /etc/passwd
2008-07-21T03:17:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	No I don't; I haven't ever edited after installing Ubuntu
2008-07-21T03:17:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	you may be able to reconstruct it from a live system's copy
2008-07-21T03:18:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	you don't believe in backups, then?
2008-07-21T03:22:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	root password?
2008-07-21T03:22:00.000Z	sdtr443w	soundray	Yes--I clicked the unlock button to access the users and groups.  After that it listed no users, but it was unlocked (unlock button was checked and greyed out)
2008-07-21T03:24:00.000Z	soundray	sdtr443w	you don't use a root password on Ubuntu
