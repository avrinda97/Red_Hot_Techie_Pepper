2011-09-03T03:06:00.000Z	sythe		Does someone have something against XBMC?
2011-09-03T03:06:00.000Z	sythe		It's nowhere in the repos
2011-09-03T03:07:00.000Z	sythe		And...it's highly regarded
2011-09-03T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	its ok, the xbmc team has a ppa
2011-09-03T03:07:00.000Z	sythe	ActionParsnip	Not ok...
2011-09-03T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	could add a suggestion on http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2011-09-03T03:08:00.000Z	sythe	ActionParsnip	It's been around for years and years
2011-09-03T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	those are totally different apps with different goals
2011-09-03T03:08:00.000Z	sythe	ActionParsnip	And...PiTiVi is crap
2011-09-03T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	maybe they will, there is an xbmc team ppa, you can add it and install the app
2011-09-03T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	many use it
2011-09-03T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	all I can suggest is add the ppa and.or make the suggestion
2011-09-03T03:10:00.000Z	sythe	ActionParsnip	You're telling me that nobody has tried that?
2011-09-03T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sythe	tried what?
