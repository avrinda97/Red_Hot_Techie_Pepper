2007-01-20T13:34:00.000Z	old-monk	surgy	there's a bug in the ipod in that it reports the wrong disk geometry and when linux try to read the disk the ipod crashes, there is a patch for it but i don't know if its already in ubuntu
2007-01-20T13:48:00.000Z	old-monk	surgy	yup
2007-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	surgy	old-monk	umm

2007-01-20T13:46:00.000Z	surgy	old-monk	well isnt it like mounting anything else? like a harddrive?
2007-01-20T13:47:00.000Z	old-monk	surgy	yes that should do it
2007-01-20T13:47:00.000Z	surgy	old-monk	well thats what i was asking was for you to help me mount it, thats all
2007-01-20T13:47:00.000Z	old-monk	surgy	 remember usb uses scsi emulation so your ipod will be /dev/sd?
