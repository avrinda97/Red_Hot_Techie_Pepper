2012-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	Odiumx		it can see i have the drive, and it has that space availaable
2012-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	Odiumx		tthus allowing me to continue

2012-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	Odiumx		there's just nothing
2012-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	Odiumx		i can't continue, it says' not root drive selected' but there's nothing to select.
2012-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	Odiumx		new partition table, add,change,delete,revert...these buttons do nothing. it can see my devide (hd0) to install the bootloader in.

2012-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	Odiumx		as I said, these buttons do nothing
2012-07-08T11:40:00.000Z	Odiumx		caln't even click them
2012-07-08T11:40:00.000Z	Odiumx		no.
2012-07-08T11:40:00.000Z	L3top	Odiumx	can you pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l from live boot?
2012-07-08T11:41:00.000Z	Odiumx	L3top	- where do I type that?
2012-07-08T11:45:00.000Z	Odiumx	L3top	- ok thx.
2012-07-08T11:45:00.000Z	Odiumx	L3top	- fdisk -l returns nothing
2012-07-08T11:51:00.000Z	L3top	Odiumx	if fdisk cannot see the drive... it is most likely how the drive is set to be recognized in bios
2012-07-08T11:52:00.000Z	L3top	Odiumx	ubuntu doesn't require anything. The drive is not being seen. Check the bios for sata mode: acpi/raid/ide
2012-07-08T12:10:00.000Z	L3top	Odiumx	did you check your bios sata mode?
2012-07-08T12:12:00.000Z	L3top	Odiumx	due to various reasons, usually the bios sets this mode to acpi, and this can cause issues that setting it to ide mode  fixes.
2012-07-08T12:13:00.000Z	Odiumx	L3top	- I doubt my bios has changed, as it's a replacement for a recently failed drive.
