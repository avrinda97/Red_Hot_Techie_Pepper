2008-06-26T18:12:00.000Z	ishbibenob		About a week ago my every time I mount and SD card it is read only, before this I had no problems, anyone have any ideas?
2008-06-26T18:12:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	fsck /dev/<device> and or slide the write protect knob on the USB key to R/W
2008-06-26T18:14:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	would be better to fsck without it being mounted as well
2008-06-26T18:17:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	how can I find the name of that device, when it is unmounted it is not listed as my other drives are?
2008-06-26T18:17:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	dmesg could be helpful
2008-06-26T18:19:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	thanks, that did it
2008-06-26T18:22:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	np
2008-06-26T18:23:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	it might mean you pulled the key improperly
2008-06-26T18:23:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	how do you mean?
2008-06-26T18:24:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	you will need to unmount or eject this key before you pull it out of the machine, you can't just yank it
2008-06-26T18:24:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	that is a possibility
2008-06-26T18:25:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	old school trick might help , run "sync" after writing to it
2008-06-26T18:26:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	ok
2008-06-26T18:27:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	I have a similar problem with a hard drive I am using, I installed Virtual Box to this hard drive and it only uses 60Gb but the rest I cant touch cause I dont have permissions
2008-06-26T18:28:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	I don't quite follow, you have a seperate HDD that you have set aside for VB?
2008-06-26T18:30:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	I partitioned it so the rest could be used but it still says I dont have permissions
2008-06-26T18:32:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	are you operating as root?
2008-06-26T18:32:00.000Z	ishbibenob	dmacnutt	I am not sure even how to do that
2008-06-26T18:35:00.000Z	dmacnutt	ishbibenob	try running VB with sudo instead
