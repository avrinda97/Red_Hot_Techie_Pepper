2005-01-03T10:22:00.000Z	bob2	lukins	Ubuntu really couldn't sort it out?
2005-01-03T10:23:00.000Z	lukins	bob2	I tried several times and the x was hosed allways, it would boot into x and just hang
2005-01-03T10:23:00.000Z	bob2	lukins	please file a bug
2005-01-03T10:24:00.000Z	lukins	bob2	I'm quite the noob, I don't know if what I'm doing is a bug, or it's just me screwing around
2005-01-03T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	lukins	if a default install fails to get X working, it's a bug
2005-01-03T10:25:00.000Z	lukins	bob2	but it wasn't a default, that went fine, it was an upgrade to hoary
2005-01-03T10:25:00.000Z	bob2	lukins	so waryt was fine, but after upgrading to hoary, X stops starting?
2005-01-03T10:26:00.000Z	bob2	lukins	then please file a bug
2005-01-03T10:26:00.000Z	lukins	bob2	do you work for ubuntu or something?
