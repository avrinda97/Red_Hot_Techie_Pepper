2011-05-16T11:51:00.000Z	Falkon303		I can't seem to find what fonts firefox is calling
2011-05-16T11:51:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	Um...have you tried the Firefox "config" page? (in the URL field, type: about:config)
2011-05-16T11:52:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	I've not seen yer issue with the exception of having the wrong vid driver and bad font settings...otherwise, all been smooth...
2011-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Falkon303	YankDownUnder	- did you see the screenshot then>?
2011-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	Seen it before. As per my last comment.
2011-05-16T11:54:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	If you've got an nVidia card, double check your driver's settings (sudo nvidia-settings) - then check your font settings - smoothing and DPI and the likes in your Appearance preferences....
2011-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	Falkon303	YankDownUnder	- sudo nvidia-settings does nothing
2011-05-16T11:57:00.000Z	Falkon303	YankDownUnder	- not the font settings
2011-05-16T11:59:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	If you don't have the "nvidia-settings" control panel, mate, I'll say you've not got the right nvidia driver.
2011-05-16T12:00:00.000Z	Falkon303	YankDownUnder	- I changed my "application font" from ubuntu to arial and the problem isn't showing yet
2011-05-16T12:08:00.000Z	Falkon303	YankDownUnder	- The problem seemed to be fixed by changing the default application font from Ubuntu to Arial
2011-05-16T12:08:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	Hmmm...well, cool - resolved...still strange...(and God, do I hate arial - or anything patented/copyrighted by Microsoft)
2011-05-16T12:09:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	Why not just use something free...or just nicer looking - like the Mac fonts...ahem... :)
2011-05-16T12:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	And Microsoft ain't? Hmmm...
2011-05-16T12:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	Yeah - the bloke is dying - duh...
2011-05-16T12:12:00.000Z	Falkon303	YankDownUnder	- people die every second, that doesn't mean they should all be wearing turtlenecks.
2011-05-16T12:12:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Falkon303	:)
