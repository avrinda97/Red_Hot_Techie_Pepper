2008-05-12T21:22:00.000Z	sbox		hello all, i've just swapped out ubuntu server 804 out of an old p2 400 into a Socket 7 500 amd.. ubuntu doesn't like it on boot.. says wrong kernal.. is it possible load the correct kernal?
2008-05-12T21:24:00.000Z	sbox		changing the kernal anyone?
2008-05-12T21:24:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	yes, I'm about to do that, too. What's the problem you're trying to solve?
2008-05-12T21:26:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	i've just changed the hdd out of an old pentium 400 to an AMD socket 7, upon boot it states it doesnn;'t like the kernal as parimiters are missing
2008-05-12T21:26:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	is there anyway to get it to boot the correct kernal?
2008-05-12T21:26:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	what system is installed on that HDD?
2008-05-12T21:26:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	ubuntu server 804
2008-05-12T21:27:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	the server kernel should support either CPU. Can you be a bit more explicit about the error message. Use the pastebin if necessary
2008-05-12T21:28:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	shall do, are you going to be around for a few minutes?
2008-05-12T21:28:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	yes, I'll ask my question in the meantime
2008-05-12T21:28:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	Cool
2008-05-12T21:47:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	you about mate?
2008-05-12T21:48:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	seems so
2008-05-12T21:49:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	http://paste.ubuntu.com/11695/
2008-05-12T21:51:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	I can't claim I understand this error, but if your CPU is an AMD Athlon XP, I don't see why the hardy server kernel wouldn't boot
2008-05-12T21:51:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	so can you make sure it is that one you are trying to boot pls
2008-05-12T21:52:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	its a socket 7 500mhz
2008-05-12T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	sbox	can you boot a live CD on that system?
2008-05-12T22:07:00.000Z	sbox	soundray	just tried an old smoothwall in it and it worked fine
