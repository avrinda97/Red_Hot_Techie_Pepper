2006-06-11T10:59:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		does it improve performance to put / and swap partitions on seperate physical harddisks?
2006-06-11T11:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	i would say so
2006-06-11T11:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	presuming one isn't archaic
2006-06-11T11:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	edit /etc/fstab, i believe
2006-06-11T11:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	you'll want to do a mkswap first of ciurse
2006-06-11T11:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	/dev/hda6              4807056   1002224   3560648  22% /
2006-06-11T11:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	that's one of seven partitions here
2006-06-11T11:04:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	eyequeue	on one harddisk?
2006-06-11T11:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	right
2006-06-11T11:05:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	eyequeue	but what do you do when those 10gb are used up? can you install bin files to other partitions then?
2006-06-11T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	don't make / too lean unless you have a /usr /var /home and such
2006-06-11T11:05:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	eyequeue	not understood.. too lean?
2006-06-11T11:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	too skimpy
2006-06-11T11:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	and others, yes
2006-06-11T11:07:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	eyequeue	what is the advantage of you using seperate partitions for /usr and /var, if they still are on the same harddisk, and a crash doesn't help much
2006-06-11T11:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	if you tell tar to back up a certain dir ("/") it depnds on what is under that
2006-06-11T11:08:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	eyequeue	may I msg you
2006-06-11T11:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	traditionally on unix systems, /usr and /var can be mounted with different permissions, etc
2006-06-11T11:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	Scorpmoon	okay
