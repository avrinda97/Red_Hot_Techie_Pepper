2007-09-06T12:36:00.000Z	tuqann		Anyone knows how we can Bitpim to work with a usb cable rather than a com port???
2007-09-06T12:37:00.000Z	Evanlec	tuqann	i believe usb ports (atleast in windows) create a "virtual com port"
2007-09-06T12:38:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	well, i plugged the thing, nothing happened, installed Bitpim, didn't detect, installed MoPOL nothing happened
2007-09-06T12:39:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	installed ubuntu and now you don't get a boot?
2007-09-06T12:39:00.000Z	Evanlec	tuqann	- i would say read up bitpim docs, see if u can make the usb port act as a virtual comp port
2007-09-06T12:39:00.000Z	Evanlec	tuqann	installed ubuntu after windows, and now windows wont boot
2007-09-06T12:40:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	do you get the GRUB boot screen, or the machine jumps immediately to Ubuntu?
2007-09-06T12:42:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	Vista is a lot less friendlier than XP when it comes to multiple boots, i would suggest GRUB's recovery CD, it would reinstall GRUB and fix the boot. But this very well could be a Vista incompatibility
2007-09-06T12:43:00.000Z	Evanlec	tuqann	is there a recovery CD or is it a floppy? :(
2007-09-06T12:45:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	the recovery CD is very small, a few MBs only, and there is a floppy option and a USB option, but depending on some machine floppy and usb might not work. if you have a blank laying around the download isn't big at all
2007-09-06T12:45:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	alreadying googling :P
2007-09-06T12:47:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	that's the one
2007-09-06T12:48:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	a very important note
2007-09-06T12:51:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	get the usb version then, different than the CD image
2007-09-06T12:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	tuqann	where do u see the usb version?
2007-09-06T12:54:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	http://forjamari.linex.org/frs/?group_id=61 and scroll down
2007-09-06T12:55:00.000Z	Evanlec	tuqann	oh, duh, thx ;p
2007-09-06T12:56:00.000Z	tuqann	Evanlec	good luck and home it works, ciao
