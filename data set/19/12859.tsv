2005-06-24T15:10:00.000Z	fabio	UnGoD	hmm, ru  trying it on a laptop?
2005-06-24T15:11:00.000Z	fabio	UnGoD	hmm that's pretty strange, I use the same GFX here
2005-06-24T15:12:00.000Z	fabio	UnGoD	have you tried to check for the md5 checksum and see if it was downloaded correctly?
2005-06-24T15:13:00.000Z	fabio	UnGoD	hm ;) well the md5 checksum helps you see if the file you've downloaded have been downloaded correctly,  so if the md5 code is the same as the one in ubuntu website, it means your copy is not corrupted nor files are missing
2005-06-24T15:15:00.000Z	fabio	UnGoD	oh no, that's different cos those will be OK hopefully, so, hmm sorry but I don't know what the prob could be... I am not that advanced at Linux yet
2005-06-24T15:15:00.000Z	fabio	UnGoD	have you tried googleing it ;P
