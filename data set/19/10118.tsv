2010-02-15T19:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	no you can't, well you can change the background some how, and that's about it
2010-02-15T19:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	you can use a differnet log in screen that can be themed of course, such as kdm or xdm
2010-02-15T19:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	well I think xdm can be themed not sure
2010-02-15T19:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	yeah I am not Simon1245  ,but there's your answer anyway :)
2010-02-15T19:25:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	I have upgraded from jaunty to karmic. I had xubuntu-dekstop packages installed on my ubuntu. now, my gdm theme is xubuntu. how can I fix it?
2010-02-15T19:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	ah yes that xubuntu screen
2010-02-15T19:25:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	is it gdm? or xdm?
2010-02-15T19:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	I only saw it  briefly the xubuntu theme for GDM for 9.10, however much nicer than the default GDM theme
2010-02-15T19:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	the default is  rather brown and ugly
2010-02-15T19:26:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	was it blue? with some animation?
2010-02-15T19:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	yes something like that, and that's better than the default for Ubuntu 9.10
2010-02-15T19:27:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	so it's gdm. now, how can I set that brown theme without removing the whole xfce packages?
2010-02-15T19:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	KDM also has a nice blue theme by default
2010-02-15T19:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	not sure, and why do you want the brown theme so badly,  I remember a while ago in here, someone came in saying it's the uglyest thing they have ever seen, or something like that they put.  I really don't like it myself hence using KDM when doing Karmic.  Thing is Fedora 11 and 12 did GDM 2 quite nicely really with blue.
2010-02-15T19:28:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	maybe with removing xubuntu-gdm-themes?
2010-02-15T19:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	yes that's probably it
2010-02-15T19:29:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	believe me, xubuntu's is not much better, some animation dancing
2010-02-15T19:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	meee	I only saw the new Xubuntu log in screen briefly,  the old one had quite a nice theme also
2010-02-15T19:30:00.000Z	meee	sebsebseb	thanks
