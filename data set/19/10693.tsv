2008-03-09T02:00:00.000Z	Thirsteh	miranda82	after inserting the camera, type 'dmesg' and look for any indication of the device address (something like /dev/sda1), then do something like 'sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/some-folder'
2008-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	thx for replying, the problem is that dmesg does not show anything like that,
2008-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	shows: [  860.544000] Inbound IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:19:d2:35:b3:23:00:1c:10:4e:1e:74:08:00 SRC=38.103.50.145 DST=192.168.1.110 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=46 ID=56999 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=42576 DPT=49643 WINDOW=5840 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
2008-03-09T02:02:00.000Z	Thirsteh	miranda82	if dmesg doesn't show anything at all, then I'd guess either USB is disabled in your BIOS or your camera is inserted in a USB slot that doesn't work (if you're using a USB hub on the front of the case, try the USB ports on the motherboard instead)
2008-03-09T02:02:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	the camera works i am able to download the images usign gnome importer, the problem,  is to mount it as a drive
2008-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	Thirsteh	miranda82	it'd need to be mounted for you to be able to get anything off of it. Try typing 'mount' in a shell and check if it's on that list and is already mounted (probably at the bottom of the list)
2008-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	it's not
2008-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	Thirsteh	miranda82	'tail -f /var/log/dmesg' then disconnect and reconnect the camera, there really should be a message
2008-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	the message is: [  860.544000] Inbound IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:19:d2:35:b3:23:00:1c:10:4e:1e:74:08:00 SRC=38.103.50.145 DST=192.168.1.110 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=46 ID=56999 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=42576 DPT=49643 WINDOW=5840 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
2008-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	Thirsteh	miranda82	that has nothing to do with USB
2008-03-09T02:06:00.000Z	miranda82		i know
2008-03-09T02:07:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	dmesg does not show anything, but I get the gnome asistant to import the pictures, that is the problem
2008-03-09T02:10:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	the only thing i can get, from kern.log that might give a clue is: http://pastebin.com/m4a6d5fe1
2008-03-09T02:13:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	any clue?
2008-03-09T02:14:00.000Z	Thirsteh	miranda82	no, sorry, I'd look through available devices in /dev or any references to new devices in the kernel log, but right now I'm not in Linux so can't give you anything concrete off the top of my head
2008-03-09T02:14:00.000Z	miranda82	Thirsteh	k, thx anyway
