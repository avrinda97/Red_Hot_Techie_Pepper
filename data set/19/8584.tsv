2007-03-11T16:17:00.000Z	Flightbase	X_Force	but as the image name suggests: it`s supposed to run on a server... will i run into dependency problems, when changeing the sources.list to stable sources after install?
2007-03-11T16:17:00.000Z	X_Force	Flightbase	do you need server or client ?
2007-03-11T16:17:00.000Z	Flightbase	X_Force	server
2007-03-11T16:18:00.000Z	X_Force	Flightbase	in march feisty is stable .
2007-03-11T16:18:00.000Z	X_Force	Flightbase	i recommend to to install and keep sources as they are and then do a upgrade on march ..
2007-03-11T16:18:00.000Z	Flightbase	X_Force	well... sounds perfect. hopefully the installer is working
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	X_Force	Flightbase	because if you change sources to edgy .. you will get a problem .
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	X_Force	Flightbase	its herd 5 .. i wish you luki :d
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	X_Force	Flightbase	cu
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	Flightbase	X_Force	feisty is like testing right?
