2006-11-16T07:18:00.000Z	progek		Hi again, ok I grabbed suns jre from their website, installed it in /usr/local and created a system link in /usr/lib/firefox and it works fine. I would just now like to remove gcj and use java from my new installation. When I run update-alternatives it only gives me the gcj option so can i just remove that and set a path to /usr/local/jre.../java ?
2006-11-16T07:19:00.000Z	minimec	progek	re ;) Install the jre in /usr/local and add /usr/local/jre(xy) to /etc/environment

2006-11-16T07:23:00.000Z	progek	minimec	thanks yes, I was away for a minute. I am editing the environment file now
2006-11-16T07:24:00.000Z	minimec	progek	I think that should do it. The last time I did that was with debian sarge (when it was the testing branch) ;)

2006-11-16T07:27:00.000Z	progek	minimec	thanks
2006-11-16T07:29:00.000Z	minimec	progek	maybe you have to login again or restart the computer.
2006-11-16T07:43:00.000Z	minimec	progek	we fergot something ;)
2006-11-16T07:43:00.000Z	progek	minimec	That worked great, thanks. The environment worked. I also set up javac for compiling :)
2006-11-16T07:44:00.000Z	minimec	progek	Ok. np
2006-11-16T07:45:00.000Z	progek	minimec	one question, I have java 5 selected on my java alternatives and I just downloaded limewire. However, each time I try running it I get-> runLime.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
2006-11-16T07:49:00.000Z	minimec	progek	Hmmm... Did you check that line44 in runLime.sh?
2006-11-16T07:50:00.000Z	minimec	progek	This doesn't seem to be a java problem. there seems to be a missing '}' on that line 44 ...
2006-11-16T07:54:00.000Z	minimec	progek	I rarly had success with alien ;) Maybe you have to compile it manually and do a 'checkinstall' to have a *.deb file in the end.
2006-11-16T07:55:00.000Z	progek	minimec	thanks, but I think I will just use gnutella for now. Any way to remove limewire? I tried aptitude remove limewire but it is not found. If i go to add/remove programs it does not show under internet either.
2006-11-16T07:57:00.000Z	minimec	progek	You did sudo aptitude remove limewire-free ? Your file is called limewire-free****.de
2006-11-16T07:57:00.000Z	progek	minimec	thanks :)
2006-11-16T07:57:00.000Z	minimec	progek	;)
