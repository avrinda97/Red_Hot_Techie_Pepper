2006-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	nidah		need some info on xchat prog
2006-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	what info?
2006-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	are we talking xchat-gnome?
2006-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	I'm not sure I remember what the direct chat did... was it p2p? I think gnome-xchat tones lots of the options down... you might want to use regular xchat then
2006-03-22T08:39:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	I'm not sure. You can always revert if you like.
2006-03-22T08:40:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	well hang on one second, are there two xchat entries in your Internet menu?
2006-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	hmm. ok.
2006-03-22T08:42:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	I haven't messed   with Xchat for a while, sorry.
2006-03-22T08:43:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	well, I'm surprised they would just remove options.
2006-03-22T08:44:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	 are you comfortable with command line?
2006-03-22T08:44:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	ok.
2006-03-22T08:54:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	 I contacted you, but you did not respond.
2006-03-22T08:56:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	have you checked the preferences?
2006-03-22T08:57:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	the dialogue behavior.
2006-03-22T08:57:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	if you wish to revert, old debs may be found in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2006-03-22T09:01:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	if doubleclick doesn't work, try a "sudo dpkg -i packagename" on the terminal.
2006-03-22T09:05:00.000Z	chromakode	nidah	ok.
