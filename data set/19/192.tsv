2012-07-06T13:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	popokpou	 so the Login screen is working? but it messages that once your user logs in??
2012-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	popokpou	 did you ever determine what your video chipset is?
2012-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	popokpou	dr_willis	i'm not entirely sure how to do that
2012-07-06T13:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	popokpou	 try 'startx' and see if any errors show up
2012-07-06T13:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	popokpou	 now use alt-ctrl-f1 to get to the console you ran startx from andf look for errors. if nothing happens after a few min.
