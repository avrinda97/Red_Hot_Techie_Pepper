2012-08-10T08:31:00.000Z	andrewh192		hey, I am tryin to install ubuntu 32bit on my laptop
2012-08-10T08:31:00.000Z	andrewh192		when i run the install cd, i keep getting this message....
2012-08-10T08:32:00.000Z	andrewh192		"This kernal requires the following features not present on the CPU: pae Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropiate for your CPU
2012-08-10T08:32:00.000Z	andrewh192		what does that mean
2012-08-10T08:32:00.000Z	andrewh192		what is a pae?
2012-08-10T08:32:00.000Z	Maccer	andrewh192	Process address extension
2012-08-10T08:37:00.000Z	Maccer	andrewh192	That's a 32-bit instruction set.
2012-08-10T08:38:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	ok, so why then would if i was running a 32bit version of the installer, get said that it requires something that is only used for the 64 bit installer?
2012-08-10T08:38:00.000Z	Maccer	andrewh192	I'm not sure, what does it want from you in general?
2012-08-10T08:39:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	ok
2012-08-10T08:39:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	gotcha... well how do i fix it?
2012-08-10T08:40:00.000Z	Maccer	andrewh192	I didn't understand what the problem was in general?
2012-08-10T08:40:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	it won't let me install ubuntu
2012-08-10T08:40:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	says that the cpu doesn't have PAE
2012-08-10T08:40:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	and that i need to use a kernel appropiate to my cpu
2012-08-10T08:41:00.000Z	Maccer	andrewh192	And this is the 32-bit ubuntu?
2012-08-10T08:42:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	yeah
2012-08-10T08:43:00.000Z	Maccer	andrewh192	 Looks like you'll have to use either:  1. The alternate 32-bit CD.  2. A different ubuntu flavor or distrobution
2012-08-10T08:44:00.000Z	andrewh192	Maccer	thanx
