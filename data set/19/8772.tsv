2007-03-26T12:00:00.000Z	baktaah	soundray	 it isnt the CPU , it's the GPU
2007-03-26T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	baktaah	what kind is it, and what driver do you use?
2007-03-26T12:01:00.000Z	baktaah	soundray	 i use the latest ati drivers (ati.com)  9600 pro
2007-03-26T12:01:00.000Z	baktaah	soundray	 it's odd, it even lags when I scroll while reading some text
2007-03-26T12:03:00.000Z	soundray	baktaah	I haven't really got any suggestion for you, but I've seen similar complaints from other users of the binary ATI drivers. It might be worth searching the web, if you haven't tried that already.

2007-03-31T15:42:00.000Z	baktaah	soundray	should I update gconf-editor?
2007-03-31T15:42:00.000Z	soundray	baktaah	no. If you want to edit the gnome configuration, just type Alt-F2 gconf-editor
2007-04-29T10:40:00.000Z	soundray	baktaah	there is no 64bit java plugin for mozilla. You'd have to setup a 32bit chroot environment. Ubotu has a pointer (read your private messages)
