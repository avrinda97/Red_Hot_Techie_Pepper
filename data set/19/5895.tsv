2008-04-21T19:02:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	use ghst: is on UBCD4WIN (google): or any of the other image-makers on that cd

2008-04-21T19:03:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	or use ultimate boot cd (is linux, better, UBCD4win is a hassle, you need windoze), I believe it has an image program on it; ie make an image of yer hd, and put it back on the hd you want it on
2008-04-21T19:05:00.000Z	prashant__1	Leeuw	: ok but is it possible to backup the image to a DVD and then restore the image on HDD
2008-04-21T19:06:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	if itś smaller than 4 gig it is, yeah; the image is as large as the data, it can go on a larger drive
2008-04-21T19:07:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	google UBCD, wich is Ultimate Boot CD
2008-04-21T19:08:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	check if there's an image prog on it (prob yes), otherwise look for other image prog
2008-04-21T19:08:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	like norton Ghost (bittorrent plenty around), need dos thoug for that
2008-04-21T19:08:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	sure, ain goin nowhere

2008-04-21T19:11:00.000Z	prashant__1	Leeuw	there is Hard disk cloning toll on UBCD
2008-04-21T19:11:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	ok stick with that;
2008-04-21T19:12:00.000Z	prashant__1	Leeuw	any idea how is that going to work :s
2008-04-21T19:14:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	just boot the cd, start the program (the cd gives instructions, has F1 help and stuff, and go from there...    also check the website, it should have docs and links for the programs on it
2008-04-21T19:15:00.000Z	Leeuw	prashant__1	CHECK HWILDE 'S SUGGESTION: ﻿ghost4unix !  open source disk imager boot cd
