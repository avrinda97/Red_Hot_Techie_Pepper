2011-03-16T10:44:00.000Z	Moc		2.6.38 is amazing on 10.10 !
2011-03-16T10:45:00.000Z	Moc		I'm too lazy to compile at this time of night
2011-03-16T10:45:00.000Z	Moc		I can watch 1080p video on youtube perfectly now !
2011-03-16T10:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Moc	natty uses the 38 branch already
2011-03-16T10:47:00.000Z	Moc		once you sure the 3 deb are installed, just reboot and it should do it
2011-03-16T10:48:00.000Z	Moc	ActionParsnip	no intention to upgrade to natty for the moment
2011-03-16T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Moc:with the 38 kernel, you essentially have it
2011-03-16T10:50:00.000Z	Moc	ActionParsnip	kernel is just a very small part
2011-03-16T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Hi speedy|2
2011-03-16T10:50:00.000Z	Moc		you know, all linux distro use the linux kernel ;)
2011-03-16T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Moc	its the very heart of the OS. Not small in any way
2011-03-16T10:51:00.000Z	Moc		it can now also use the freebsd kernel, doesn't need to use it
2011-03-16T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Moc	You are running natty in essence, the apps you are running on it are just not the ones available to the later release
2011-03-16T10:53:00.000Z	Moc		really, sched autogroup does wonder !
2011-03-16T10:54:00.000Z	Moc		disabled it in real time and flash video in full screen actually stop working well (1080p)
2011-03-16T10:54:00.000Z	Moc		my issues with 11.04 is the new UI..
2011-03-16T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Moc	other distributions may be using 38 and ubuntu isn't due to ubuntu not being a rolling release as well as other factors like its versioning and stuff like that
2011-03-16T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Moc	You can use the original desktop in Natty too...
2011-03-16T10:56:00.000Z	Moc	ActionParsnip	yea, just worried it wont work as well... I'll give it a try for sure
