2006-08-19T11:02:00.000Z	IceCube		Just finding a way to install the drivers that doesn't involve being Stephen Hawking is what I'm after
2006-08-19T11:03:00.000Z	IceCube		When I came here two days ago someone directed me to libraries or repositories for me to click on and it accelerated no problem. I just can't remember what it wads
2006-08-19T11:04:00.000Z	IceCube		XGL? If I am I don't know about it
2006-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	IceCube		Either that or the ati accelerator was what I had to add
2006-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	IceCube		I've tried the thing that bot throws out, and its way more complicated than the method that worked for me before
2006-08-19T11:06:00.000Z	IceCube		This looks similar to a method I tried earlier today
2006-08-19T11:06:00.000Z	IceCube		I'll give it a blast though
2006-08-19T11:07:00.000Z	IceCube		And as I said before, I've tried the bots method and its beyond me, I'm a complete newbie to all this
2006-08-19T11:07:00.000Z	IceCube		Aparrently I already have the newest version when I do sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-08-19T11:08:00.000Z	IceCube		Thats the package I tried to install today. You see this is a fresh install, I'm on 32-bit after ironically changing from my fully functional 64-bit setup hoping for some more simplicity
2006-08-19T11:09:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	did you follow the 3 steps ati driver install how-to ?
2006-08-19T11:10:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	bad approach, you should folow only one, and ask for help to figure what went wrong
2006-08-19T11:11:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	you just need to install the drivers, and edit a text file to use it instead of the open source driver
2006-08-19T11:12:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	did you checked that the driver was properly loaded ?
2006-08-19T11:13:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	lsmod | grep -i fglxr
2006-08-19T11:13:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	dmesg | grep fglrx
2006-08-19T11:14:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	just to be safe, you did edit the xorg.conf, right ?
2006-08-19T11:14:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	you dont need to compile unless your model is not supported by the current driver
2006-08-19T11:15:00.000Z	lamego	IceCube	, we are your guide now, did you changed xorg.conf ?
