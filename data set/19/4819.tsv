2008-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	winenvine		I have ubuntu 8.04 but still having problems with Java plugin.
2008-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	winenvine		I downloaded java from Sun, followed all instruction, tested it and got half of the cartoon working.
2008-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	winenvine		Obviously it does not work on web site that requires java.
