2008-08-14T04:49:00.000Z	Asterix_		If my computer crashes only while playing 3D games but it can't be an overheating problem because I have a brand new video card, what else could be the source of a problem like this?
2008-08-14T04:49:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	buggy drivers
2008-08-14T04:50:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	video card drivers
2008-08-14T04:50:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	I've got the latest nvidia drivers installed...  it was doing this with some previous drivers too
2008-08-14T04:51:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	it doesn't crash right away either...  with my previous card I could play for 5-10 min before a hard lockup but with my new one I played for several hours and then it finally crashed
2008-08-14T04:52:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	crashes like deadlocks completely up to the point where u have to press power button
2008-08-14T04:52:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	?
2008-08-14T04:52:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	correct...  caps lock doesn't even do anything
2008-08-14T04:53:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	I've tried checking system logs but nothing shows up because it's a total freeze up
2008-08-14T04:53:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	 hm the only cause i can think of is overheating really
2008-08-14T04:55:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	I thought it was too with my old card.  But this new card runs cooler and I've also tried running the computer with a fan blowing into it.  The temperature sensors are steady too.  It's a brand new card and I don't understand how it's overheating already.
2008-08-14T04:55:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	maybe its the cpu?
2008-08-14T04:57:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	I tried running a cpu stress test that maxxed it out completely and it didn't lock up for a couple hours worth.  I think it was hitting around 75 degrees with that test running.
2008-08-14T04:57:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	what kind of game were u playing was it running in wine?
2008-08-14T04:58:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	I tested it with WoW and Portal and it did the crashing thing with both of them with my previous card
2008-08-14T04:59:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	and with my new card it has crashed once with both of them but only after a much longer time than the ~5 min I was getting with the old card.
2008-08-14T04:59:00.000Z	usser	Asterix_	hm... that is weird i dunno what to tell u, try running a linux native game like openarena or tremulous see how that works out
2008-08-14T05:00:00.000Z	Asterix_		ragemachine: I've never had problems with wine before...  I was 99% certain it was a heat problem that was causing my card to crash but now I'm not certain anymore.
2008-08-14T05:01:00.000Z	Asterix_	usser	I'll have to try out a native game and see what happens.  It's just so disconcerting to have been so sure it was a heat problem and now it's cropping up again albeit in a limited fashion.
