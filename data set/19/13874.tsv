2006-01-02T14:37:00.000Z	Ganjhi		Anybody willing to help a new comer?
2006-01-02T14:39:00.000Z	Ganjhi		It's not really a specific problem, When trying to open my HD's it says that I do not have the permission necessary. The only way I can access the files is with Sudo Nautilus, but even then, I can't play the files.
2006-01-02T14:40:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	mount options
2006-01-02T14:40:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	-o uid=[your-uid] 
2006-01-02T14:41:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	do you run mount command as root?
2006-01-02T14:41:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	(supposedly you do)
2006-01-02T14:41:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	umm
2006-01-02T14:42:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	how do you mount your hd's
2006-01-02T14:42:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	do  you issue something like sudo mount blah-blah
2006-01-02T14:43:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	you mean you did not mount the hd's yourself?
2006-01-02T14:43:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	they like "were there"
2006-01-02T14:43:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	get your brother there and ask him  :)
2006-01-02T14:44:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	ah, that's about that writing, ntfs is (for practical purposes) read only
2006-01-02T14:44:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	you should be able to read
2006-01-02T14:45:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	yes, with nautilus, if it's running w root privileges
2006-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	you would propably be better of remounting your disks so that you can read as luser
2006-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	do remount with "sudo mount" and look for proper options to disable file security alltogether or force all files to be uid=yourself
2006-01-02T14:49:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	/etc/fstab, contains your filesystem mount configuration
2006-01-02T14:50:00.000Z	TTilus	Ganjhi	and you ca google pastebin
