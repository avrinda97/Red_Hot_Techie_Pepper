2006-09-29T09:51:00.000Z	jkernsjr	roflpanda	do a test and let us know if you can control the volumes independently now
2006-09-29T09:54:00.000Z	jkernsjr	roflpanda	so has it always been the fact that you had to crank the volume to hear anything?
2006-09-29T09:54:00.000Z	jkernsjr	roflpanda	I take it you have the system volume all the way up?
2006-09-29T09:55:00.000Z	jkernsjr	roflpanda	huh..not sure
