2007-05-28T08:47:00.000Z	silent_		if I mount in /mnt do I still have to create the mount point beforehand?
2007-05-28T08:47:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	You should create seperate mount points
2007-05-28T08:48:00.000Z	silent_	bensode	I know, I would mount at /mnt/foo, but do I have to mkdir foo before mounting?
2007-05-28T08:49:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	Yes, mkdir /mnt/foo or whatever
2007-05-28T08:49:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	may need to sudo mkdir /mnt/foo that is

2007-05-28T08:53:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	I didn't read your whole thread just caught the last couple of lines about mounting and mount points
2007-05-28T08:56:00.000Z	silent_	bensode	I wanted to know if there was a way to mount volumes without creating their mountpoints first (a special directory or command) ... ie. instead of mkdir /argh || mount /dev/foo /argh .... only mount /dev/foo /argh (/argh created automatically)
2007-05-28T08:58:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	You could make a bash script that will take arguments on the mount command and the mount point ?
2007-05-28T08:59:00.000Z	silent_	bensode	I could, but maybe some other time
2007-05-28T09:00:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	I know the capability exists.  By default, when I install a usb drive it mounts it and auto creates the entry ... but I'm sure it's just a custom script that runs the mount command and sends the device name to the script to process the mkdir first
2007-05-28T09:01:00.000Z	silent_	bensode	yea thats exactly what I was thinking about
2007-05-28T09:01:00.000Z	silent_	bensode	how media automounts... wondering if I could pull that off on any other mount
2007-05-28T09:02:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	I'm sure you can by creating a generic bash script and link it to /usr/bin
2007-05-28T09:03:00.000Z	silent_	bensode	yea, I'll look into it at some point... I haven't done much work with scripts, only a script I made to autostart a server once, I'll do some research into scripting another time
2007-05-28T09:05:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	Let me recommend an EXCELLENT beginner book to the BASH ... and no I don't work for the publisher :P

2007-05-28T09:06:00.000Z	bensode	silent_	You might be able to find it in PDF format for free on the Orielly site ... not sure if they offer many free books anymore but it's cheap and I've been using mine nearly 8 years now from time to time
