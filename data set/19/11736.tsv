2009-03-12T01:24:00.000Z	demon_	usr13	how ??
2009-03-12T01:24:00.000Z	usr13	demon_	But it should be detected and adjusted automatically.
2009-03-12T01:25:00.000Z	usr13	demon_	Unless there is a KVM switch. Some KVM switches will hinder that process.
2009-03-12T01:25:00.000Z	demon_	usr13	i can put my other monitor and restart its good i can put my other monitor and work but i cant do that every time
2009-03-12T01:26:00.000Z	usr13	demon_	If you want to restart in single user mode, just hit e when grub comes up and give command linux single
2009-03-12T01:26:00.000Z	usr13	demon_	That's interesting.
2009-03-12T01:27:00.000Z	demon_	usr13	in 7.10 there is a setting that i can choose my monitor but on 8.10 i cant
2009-03-12T01:33:00.000Z	demon_	usr13	i had this same problem back at ubuntu  6.06 but a guy took my xorg asked me for my monitor and he fixed it :) so if you know this guy it will be a lot of help :P
