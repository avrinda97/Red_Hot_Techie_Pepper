2007-09-02T05:42:00.000Z	paul_		anyone can help me with this ?????
2007-09-02T05:43:00.000Z	paul_		PLEASE?!
2007-09-02T05:43:00.000Z	paul_		guess not
2007-09-02T05:43:00.000Z	Esteth	paul_	what is the problem?
2007-09-02T05:45:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	having problems with wireless i can get it working only if i start it with dhclient eth1 or ifup eth1 but it does not work on the network manager..
2007-09-02T05:46:00.000Z	Esteth	paul_	you could setup those commands to run at startup? for network-manager, make sure you're using the right encryption key (hex/deciamal)
2007-09-02T05:47:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	i have no encryption key it is open i live in the middle of no where so im not worried about encryption.
2007-09-02T05:48:00.000Z	Esteth	paul_	If you can get it running through those commands, i'd just set them to run after you login
2007-09-02T05:49:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	so just dont have network manager work at all?
2007-09-02T05:50:00.000Z	Esteth		pauk_: Yes. unless you need to change connections a lot, it's probably not worth trying to get network-manager working
2007-09-02T05:50:00.000Z	Esteth		s/pauk/paul
2007-09-02T05:52:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	nah i want to figure it out.. i want network manager to work cause im back and fourth between access points and it should work
2007-09-02T05:53:00.000Z	Esteth	paul_	ahh, ok. Kind of useful then. Sorry if i can't help any furthur, i havn't had issues with network-manager + wireless since Feisty. Before i had to use ndiswrapper for drivers, but network-manager still worked
2007-09-02T05:55:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	well mine came up with bm43xx drivers failing and i blacklisted them and used ndiswrappers to replace the drivers with bmwl5.inf
2007-09-02T05:56:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	blacklisted them in /etc/modprobe.d/"blacklist"
2007-09-02T05:57:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	Rebooted and the drivers stopped.. but ndiswrapper drivers worked but it stays at eth1 dont know if it should be wlan0 or not..
2007-09-02T05:57:00.000Z	Esteth	paul_	As far as i know, everything should work. what exactly doesn't work about network manager?
2007-09-02T05:57:00.000Z	paul_	Esteth	kk thanks for trying.. you were the only one who answered..
