2007-03-09T09:13:00.000Z	mjunx	palbuddy	it depends on where you said to put them, I don't remember what command you used
2007-03-09T09:15:00.000Z	mjunx	palbuddy	you might want to run "sudo chown yourname:yourname *.mp3" in that folder
2007-03-09T09:19:00.000Z	palbuddy	mjunx	I get 'permission denied'
2007-03-09T09:19:00.000Z	palbuddy	mjunx	I have the ntfs hard drive that I want to access
2007-03-09T09:30:00.000Z	mjunx	palbuddy	now run "sudo mount -a" to mount everything
