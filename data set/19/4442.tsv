2009-02-27T04:19:00.000Z	Stevethe1irate	Titan8990	yeah, all network died.
2009-02-27T04:19:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	that seems odd as that command should have only effected eth1
2009-02-27T04:20:00.000Z	Stevethe1irate	Titan8990	well, all 50 of my remote shells died
2009-02-27T04:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	sorry :\
2009-02-27T04:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	I would say now is a good time to try to set persistant routes in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-02-27T04:23:00.000Z	Stevethe1irate	Titan8990	Um, ok, how?

2009-02-27T04:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	because to be it looks like it trying to reach your gateway via the network 169.0.0.0
2009-02-27T04:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	err to me
2009-02-27T04:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	if you are using dhcp it all autconfigure routes
2009-02-27T04:28:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	the 2nd command I gave you should have set the gw on that first line....
2009-02-27T04:29:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	but I believe this will be much easier if you just configure it in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-02-27T04:29:00.000Z	Stevethe1irate	Titan8990	ok, what would I add?

2009-02-27T04:29:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stevethe1irate	look at the example there for eth1, you can almost copy and paste that and replace it with your addresses
2009-02-27T04:36:00.000Z	Stevethe1irate	Titan8990	@ http://rafb.net/p/Ccsr9v87.html
2009-02-27T04:43:00.000Z	Stevethe1irate	Titan8990	thanks for help... but alas.. its past my bedtime in ZA
