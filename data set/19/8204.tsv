2007-04-23T15:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Megadeth199	  consider that you might hve a borked cd,  try it in another computer

2007-04-23T15:30:00.000Z	Pelo	Megadeth199	  I don't know how your hardware miight interfeer,  start with the basic, bad cd , if so , burn another one
2007-04-23T15:31:00.000Z	Pelo	Megadeth199	 you did download the right cd for your system right ?
2007-04-23T15:31:00.000Z	Megadeth199	Pelo	i get the amd 64 cd for my C2D E6400
2007-04-23T15:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Megadeth199	  unless you have a good reason to run the 64 bit version go with the i386 one,  there is more support for flash , wine and stuff like that
2007-04-23T15:33:00.000Z	Megadeth199	Pelo	ok i will download the I386 to try if it work
2007-04-23T15:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Megadeth199	understand,  that has nothing to do whit the problem you are experiencing right now, check the cd on another comp anyway
2007-04-23T15:34:00.000Z	Megadeth199	Pelo	ok i will go try it on an other comp and come back here after
