2009-10-30T21:05:00.000Z	helix_		anyone there? :P
2009-10-30T21:06:00.000Z	helix_		hey i'm wondering if something is possible:
2009-10-30T21:07:00.000Z	helix_		i have a virtual drive, but my game that i run on wine doesn't recognize the virtual drive as a cd medium (the game asks for the cd). my cdrom player is slow so i get laggs in game. is it possible to fool wine into thinking the virtual drive is cdrom0 ?
2009-10-30T21:08:00.000Z	simplexio	helix_	also known as cdrom check and copy protection. so you have options
2009-10-30T21:09:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	such as ? i have software to mount s
2009-10-30T21:09:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	cd images. but the game still doesn't think the cd is inserted
2009-10-30T21:10:00.000Z	simplexio	helix_	well.. #ubuntu isnt for teaching howto get nocd crack and howto disable copy protections.. google is for it, and try gamecopyworld
2009-10-30T21:10:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	no it's not a no cd crack. I have the cd and the game runs but my player is too slow. Sorry I am very bad at explaining!
2009-10-30T21:11:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	basically I want to mount the cd directly on the computer for faster reading
2009-10-30T21:11:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	so I have the .img, i mont it into ~/virtual-drives/1
2009-10-30T21:11:00.000Z	simplexio	helix_	yeas, i totally understand your problem, and easiest way to get it working is get nocd crack so game thinks your cdimage is right cd
2009-10-30T21:12:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	the thing is how to specify where the image is.. it can't guess :p
2009-10-30T21:12:00.000Z	simplexio	helix_	you can try mount -o loop image.ido /media/cdrom/
2009-10-30T21:13:00.000Z	simplexio	helix_	winecfg has place where you tell it where is you cdrom dir
2009-10-30T21:13:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	ok h/o i will try one of these
2009-10-30T21:13:00.000Z	simplexio	helix_	but i much doubt that it work without nocd crack
2009-10-30T21:21:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	the mount -o loop image.img /media/cdrom/ worked ;)
2009-10-30T21:22:00.000Z	helix_	simplexio	no longer need cd (nor crack) :D thanks for the cmd :)
