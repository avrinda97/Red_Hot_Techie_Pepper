2005-05-18T15:35:00.000Z	transgress		okay anyone in here using kde?
2005-05-18T15:36:00.000Z	transgress		bleh...  guess i'll have to do this the overcomplicated way of reading stuff
2005-05-18T15:36:00.000Z	transgress		i'm trying to get translucency working in kde, but it bitched about adding a line to my xorg.conf... that just doesn't let kdm start (but it doesn't complain either)
2005-05-18T15:36:00.000Z	transgress		and i'm wondering if anyone has it working and what they did
2005-05-18T15:37:00.000Z	transgress		no you don't
2005-05-18T15:37:00.000Z	transgress		you have it
2005-05-18T15:37:00.000Z	transgress		err hate
2005-05-18T15:37:00.000Z	transgress		bleh
2005-05-18T15:37:00.000Z	transgress		i guess ima have to hop back into X... i was trying to avoid that

2005-05-24T15:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	transgress	 separate home also rocks when you have to reinstall, or, like i just had to do, when you have to ship your laptop back to the factory and want to purge all personal data from it first
2005-05-24T15:22:00.000Z	transgress	eyequeue	yeah i understand that... usually i risk it on upgrades, of course i usually backup my hard drive to disk or my external hd before i upgrade... and i'd rather /dev/random my drive to purge personal data heh
2005-05-24T15:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	transgress	 i dd'd /dev/random to /home, yeah :)
