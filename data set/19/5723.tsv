2009-02-04T06:56:00.000Z	baz_		no-one knows how to to debug the fact that i have an update sitting in pending updates that is not updating?
2009-02-04T06:57:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	what is the update?
2009-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	"gnome-do-plugins"
2009-02-04T07:01:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	pastebin the output of sudo aptitude upgrade
2009-02-04T07:03:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	there is nothing to pastebin, when I open the update manager, "gnome-do-plugins" (with description) is displayed but greyed out and unclickable.
2009-02-04T07:03:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	open a terminal type sudo aptitude upgrade and pase the output
2009-02-04T07:08:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	it showed that an update was available under 'gnome' called "gnome-do-plugins". I continued with the process to install it and bumped into this line highlighted in red: "gnome-do (>= 0.7.96~) (UNAVAILABLE)"... So it seems that the core file is not available. The next question then is how to get rid of it from the pending updates list, and why it showed up in the first place...
2009-02-04T07:09:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	sudo aptitude remove gnome-do-plugins
2009-02-04T07:10:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	for real? am i not using them
2009-02-04T07:11:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	do you use gnome-do?
2009-02-04T07:11:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	big time - my single favorite app
2009-02-04T07:12:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	try updating the repo info.  sudo aptitude update;sudo aptitude upgrade     Post any errors
2009-02-04T07:14:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	there were some "GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net intrepid Release:..." errors: http://paste.ubuntu.com/113424/
2009-02-04T07:15:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	it's not updating because it can't verify the package
2009-02-04T07:15:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	is one of my sources not good perhaps? I have a lot of custom sources...
2009-02-04T07:16:00.000Z	baz_	yoyoned	it seems like oofficial ubuntu sources though, no?
2009-02-04T07:17:00.000Z	yoyoned	baz_	i think you need to import the key, but I can't remember how
