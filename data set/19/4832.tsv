2008-10-29T21:58:00.000Z	LuYu		we were just discussing that
2008-10-29T21:58:00.000Z	LuYu		SD card
2008-10-29T21:58:00.000Z	LuYu		its easy to install a live CD
2008-10-29T21:58:00.000Z	LuYu		but persistent images are more difficult
2008-10-29T22:00:00.000Z	LuYu		has intrepid officially been released yet, or what?
2008-10-29T22:01:00.000Z	LuYu		:)
2008-10-29T22:01:00.000Z	LuYu		okay, my bad
2008-10-29T22:02:00.000Z	LuYu		but the actual release is supposed to be pretty soon, right?
2008-10-29T22:02:00.000Z	LuYu		next 24 hours or so
2008-10-29T22:02:00.000Z	BlackMetal	LuYu	Have you checked these how-tos : http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2008/10/15/ubuntu-810-persistent-flash-drive-install-from-live-cd/  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick  http://www.ryancloke.com/ubuntu-804-hardy-heron-live-usb-how-to/  http://nerdhow.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/ubuntu-804-hardy-heron-save-changes-on-a-usb-drive/ :)
2008-10-29T22:10:00.000Z	LuYu	BlackMetal	i havent seen most of those pages, but i have seen the community boot persistent page
2008-10-29T22:12:00.000Z	LuYu	BlackMetal	my point was not that -- i dont want to install from a CD, i have a bootable CD image on an SD card, and i want to convert that image (preferably while it is running) to be a persistent image -- if possible, i would like to retain the compressed filesystem
2008-10-29T22:13:00.000Z	LuYu		i doubt if there are any instructions for that specifically
2008-10-29T22:13:00.000Z	BlackMetal	LuYu	ok. I hope these pages can help you, i haven't done it myself, but yay, it's pretty specific
2008-10-29T22:17:00.000Z	BlackMetal	LuYu	i don't know if this page can help you : http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_to_a_USB_Flash_Drive#Convert_.iso_to_USB_installation
2008-10-29T22:18:00.000Z	LuYu	BlackMetal	thanks
2008-10-29T22:18:00.000Z	LuYu		:)
