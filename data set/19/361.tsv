2012-03-26T06:17:00.000Z	bbOOmm		I'm having some difficulties getting a program to automatically start upon boot of Ubuntu 10.03.3LTS desktop (Gnome) Upon booting to the desktop, I need a pause of 10 seconds, then a terminal window to open, another pause of 10 seconds, then I need to run in super user "myprogram" --- I have figured out how to open the terminal window with a 10 second pause, but I havn't been able to figure out how to pause another 10 seconds, go i
2012-03-26T06:17:00.000Z	bbOOmm		nto super user and execute the program. Can someone help me with this?
2012-03-26T06:19:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	why do you need to do this
2012-03-26T06:21:00.000Z	bbOOmm	escott	: I'm running darkice audio streaming from the command line ...
2012-03-26T06:21:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	generally speaking having a gui run as root on every boot would be discouraged. im not familiar with darkice but does it really need the gui?
2012-03-26T06:23:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	and the random 10 second delays are also a bit weird. if that were really necessary I would strongly suggest not running that program ever because it must be horribly written and you dont want to trust something like that with root
2012-03-26T06:24:00.000Z	bbOOmm	escott	: I do not think I'm running in root with the GUI ( gnome) ... I just couldn't figure out how -just yet- to get the sound card and darkice all setup with out the gui... learning the command line stuff and new to darkice, so I went with something I knew to start with.
2012-03-26T06:26:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	well i would encourage you to figure out how to do it properly, but if you *must* do it this way then the thing to do is create a script that has the necessary sleeps and then mark that script with the setuid bit and add it to your gnome-session, but there are all kinds of security klaxon's going off with doing something like that
2012-03-26T06:28:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	they should have some kind of wrapper util to start it as a non-priv user and grant it RT privs, or maybe you can do something to grant your user access to RT privs
2012-03-26T06:29:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	but granting root to enable RT is giving away nuclear launch codes so they can empty the trash cans in the oval office
2012-03-26T06:30:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	this might help http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/sound/realtime.xml
2012-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	you might also look at this: http://code.google.com/p/darkice/issues/detail?id=21 I would just disable RT and tell darkice to deal with it
2012-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	bbOOmm	escott	: Ok, let me ask this then. Since darkice is requiring the need for sudo in order to run right... what would you ( and others can chime in here)  , what would be recomended as a audio streamer...  Shoutcast compatible
2012-03-26T06:34:00.000Z	bbOOmm	escott	: note, I can always switch this thing to ubuntu server instead of desktop
2012-03-26T06:34:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	darkice isn't requiring root, its currently configured to use RT scheduling which your system has configured to only allow for root. I think RT scheduling is a bit overkill for anything but professional use, but your options are: (a) grant root (discouraged) (b) configure darkice to not use RT (I would do this) (c) configure our system to allow RT for non-root
2012-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	running on server probably wouldn't help, servers are less likely to have RT in many cases
2012-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	bbOOmm	escott	: since I'm learning this command line stuff, how would you do option B ( what you listed above :-)   I greatly appreciate the time and help you are giving me.
2012-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	escott	bbOOmm	so check if your version supports this config option: applied in r481 http://code.google.com/p/darkice/issues/detail?id=21
2012-03-26T06:54:00.000Z	bbOOmm	escott	: Thank you for your help, I'm trying some stuff with the info you gave me. Thank you
