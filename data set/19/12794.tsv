2005-07-04T07:09:00.000Z	rasputnik	JHK	you don't have Encode:Alias installed for some reason
2005-07-04T07:09:00.000Z	rasputnik		go to search.cpan.org and get it
2005-07-04T07:10:00.000Z	rasputnik		that should be 'Encode::Alias'
2005-07-04T07:10:00.000Z	JHK	rasputnik	an how do i install it?
2005-07-04T07:10:00.000Z	JHK		ahuman01, okay
2005-07-04T07:10:00.000Z	rasputnik	JHK	you untar it and read the readme :)
2005-07-04T07:11:00.000Z	rasputnik	JHK	it looks like whatever package installed Encode.pm is borked so putting it in manually should sort you out
2005-07-04T07:12:00.000Z	JHK	rasputnik	what command
2005-07-04T07:21:00.000Z	JHK	rasputnik	where is the readme for installing Untar::Aliases?
