2005-08-22T06:25:00.000Z	Srekel		hi
2005-08-22T06:25:00.000Z	Srekel		is there a quick way to restart gnome, without having to go to the login screen? I just want to test my Startup programs
2005-08-22T06:27:00.000Z	Srekel		yup
2005-08-22T06:28:00.000Z	Srekel		I know when I was using, I think windowmaker in school, I could just hit "restart windowmaker" or something from a menu
2005-08-22T06:28:00.000Z	Srekel		and it took only a second to get it back with correct startup stuff
2005-08-22T06:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	yes, but that's just a window manager, not a complete desktop environment
2005-08-22T06:29:00.000Z	Srekel	thoreauputic	ok, so there's no simple way to do that in gnome?
2005-08-22T06:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	what did you want to "refresh" ?
2005-08-22T06:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	AFAIK gnome-session doesn't know about Eterms (or aterms etc)
2005-08-22T06:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	ah sorry I see
2005-08-22T06:31:00.000Z	Srekel	thoreauputic	ok :)
2005-08-22T09:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	you want to save eterms, or sessions *in* eterms? For the latter you would use the GNU screen program and detach/ re-attach...
2005-08-22T09:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	you realise the gnome-terminal can do transparency too, I guess?
2005-08-22T09:05:00.000Z	Srekel	thoreauputic	yes, but I didn't find a way to remove the borders from it (probably just as simple)
2005-08-22T09:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	hmm - more a window manager function I think - trivially easy with fluxbox but metacity is... inflexible
2005-08-22T09:06:00.000Z	Srekel	thoreauputic	ok. is it easy to change to fluxbox? if so, where should I look for more information on it
2005-08-22T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	apt-cache show fluxbox  and http://fluxbox.org
2005-08-22T09:07:00.000Z	Srekel	thoreauputic	thanks again for your help :)
2005-08-22T09:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Srekel	no worries :)
