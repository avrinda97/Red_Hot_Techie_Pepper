2007-01-30T11:17:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	is it dhcp or fixed ip?
2007-01-30T11:17:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	so it
2007-01-30T11:17:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	so its a router your connecting to?
2007-01-30T11:18:00.000Z	all-star6	variant	yes
2007-01-30T11:18:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	enable the router for dhcp and then on ubuntu run sudo dhclient eth0
2007-01-30T11:18:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	assuming the ethernet port your using is eth0
2007-01-30T11:23:00.000Z	all-star6	variant	just get a load of DHCPDISCOVER messages then no DHCPOFFERS received
2007-01-30T11:23:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	your sure it's plugged in
2007-01-30T11:23:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	do you have more than one NIC in the pc?
2007-01-30T11:24:00.000Z	all-star6	variant	yes one wired one wireless
2007-01-30T11:25:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	you sure the router is set to offer dhcp and is not set to restrict connections by MAC address?
2007-01-30T11:25:00.000Z	all-star6	variant	yes it works in windows using DHCP
2007-01-30T11:25:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	what does ifconfig eth0 say (pastebin it)
2007-01-30T11:29:00.000Z	all-star6	variant	fixed disabled ipv6 and it worked
2007-01-30T11:29:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	excellent, nice one
2007-01-30T11:29:00.000Z	all-star6	variant	cheers for the help
2007-01-30T11:29:00.000Z	variant	all-star6	yw
