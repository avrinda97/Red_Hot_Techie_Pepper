2009-12-29T16:22:00.000Z	Iszak		I've got an nVidia GT 220 and my monitor supports up to 1280 by 1024 but for some reason I cannot get that resolution and when I force it to that it doesn't fit properly despite 1280 by 1024 working in windows.
2009-12-29T16:23:00.000Z	Iszak		I also have nvidia drivers installed as far as I know
2009-12-29T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	run: sudo nvidia-xconfig; gksudo nvidia-settings
2009-12-29T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	set the res to something then click save to X config file, you can then run: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    and manually change the resolution
2009-12-29T16:26:00.000Z	Iszak	ActionParsnip	change "1024x768 @1280x1024 to "1280x1024 @1280x1024 ?
2009-12-29T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	watever res you want, set it
2009-12-29T16:27:00.000Z	Iszak	ActionParsnip	alright finally how do you restart x11 (I think it was x11) it was something something backspace
2009-12-29T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	use alt+k+printscreen or just reboot
2009-12-29T16:28:00.000Z	Iszak	ActionParsnip	thanks :)
2009-12-29T17:10:00.000Z	Iszak	ActionParsnip	yes that is correct.
2009-12-29T17:05:00.000Z	Iszak	ActionParsnip	what you suggested didn't seem to work hmm
2009-12-29T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	then try a different mode lines
2009-12-29T17:09:00.000Z	Iszak	ActionParsnip	I'm not sure what you mean.
2009-12-29T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	werent we playing with nvidia stuff?
2009-12-29T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	and unavailable resolutions?
2009-12-29T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Iszak	then websearch around for xorg.conf files and copy their syntax to get the res you want
