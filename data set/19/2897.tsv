2009-12-01T08:54:00.000Z	khelvan		Sorry if this is a stupid question, but a program I downloaded (ps3mediaserver) came with some files but no installation instructions either in the file or on their site. It did come with an .sh file that appears to do some setup. Can someone tell me how I can run an .sh file? (It is a script, correct?)
2009-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	you would want to chmod +x the .sh then ./filename.sh
2009-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	may need to give it sudo when you run also not sure
2009-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	thanks, I will try that
2009-12-01T09:07:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	you get it working
2009-12-01T09:08:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	- I ran the script, it appears to be working, but there is nothing to tell me how to connect to the configuration, or even if a web admin is available. I don't know if it plays well with headless servers.
2009-12-01T09:10:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	nmap localhost may have to isntall nmap
2009-12-01T09:17:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	http://pastebin.com/m48f3d179 - I don't see anything that looks like it
2009-12-01T09:19:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	it wouldn't be whats running on port 80 would it can you http://localhost
2009-12-01T09:21:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	No, that is my LAMP server (Apache, SQL, etc. all have their standard ports). I don't really use it, I just installed it to play around with it.
2009-12-01T09:22:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	what ws u installing again
2009-12-01T09:24:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	PS3 Media Server. I think I need to set up something like VNC so that I can view the desktop; it has a java console for configuration on the server itself.
2009-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	it may be the 901 i would have to look at more info for it but samba is file sharing
2009-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	Yes, I have samba set up to serve files over the network
2009-12-01T09:29:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	try this /etc/init.d/fuppes restart was going to see if that was server you installed was looking at this http://www.howtoforge.com/set-up-a-linux-playstation-3-media-server-with-ubuntu8.04 it maybe helpful don't know
2009-12-01T09:31:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	Thanks, but that is for fuppes, a different media server. The one I installed was called "PS3 Media Server," or PMS for short :P - it is its name, not a descriptor :)
2009-12-01T09:34:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	there maybe a README file that will help you
2009-12-01T09:35:00.000Z	khelvan	johnson_b	Yeah, there is, but it is not helpful at all. I'll just set up VNC on the server and view it remotely, that will allow me to work with the java console and configure it nicely.
2009-12-01T09:36:00.000Z	johnson_b	khelvan	sounds good long as you get it working
