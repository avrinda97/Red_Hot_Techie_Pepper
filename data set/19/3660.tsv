2009-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	C4colo		just not in fullscreen games
2009-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	C4colo		always errors with something like:
2009-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	C4colo		ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
2009-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	C4colo		SndSys_Init: can't open audio device "default" (Device or resource busy)
2009-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	C4colo		S_Startup: sound output initialization FAILED
2009-07-24T18:13:00.000Z	C4colo		native
2009-07-24T18:13:00.000Z	C4colo		nexuiz in this case
2009-07-24T18:13:00.000Z	C4colo		another one was an old west shooter based on q3
2009-07-24T18:13:00.000Z	C4colo		nexuiz might be quake3 as well
2009-07-24T18:15:00.000Z	C4colo		I"ll try more googling, was hoping someone might have some insight
2009-07-24T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	C4colo	try a cold boot, then run the game
2009-07-24T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	C4colo	have you set the sound system in sound prefs in gnome
2009-07-24T18:18:00.000Z	C4colo	ActionParsnip	I have it set to portaudio actually
2011-06-21T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	C4colo	its channel policy due to the range of ages in here as well as keeping things civilized and mature.
2011-06-21T00:31:00.000Z	C4colo	ActionParsnip	 your definition of mature is not the same as the MPAA's I guess.
2011-06-21T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	C4colo	that is moot. Rules are rules and by using the channel you agreed to abide by them
2011-06-21T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	C4colo	its a support channel only. Discussion of the channel itself is not ubuntu support
2011-06-21T00:33:00.000Z	C4colo	ActionParsnip	get a procreating sense of humor
2011-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	C4colo	i do and i too swear up a storm at work but here its not permitted. Can you not express yourself otherwise?
