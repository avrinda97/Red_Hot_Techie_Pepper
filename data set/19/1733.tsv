2010-10-16T03:09:00.000Z	mattvv		I'm having a problem with Ubuntu Netbook Edition, I just did a clean install and the side and top menus are not loading. I can only operate the machine by using shortcuts - what should I do?
2010-10-16T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	ok sounds like Unity hasn't loaded up properly or at all
2010-10-16T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	you mean the top, and the left side?
2010-10-16T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	no sounds lke you may have another issue hmm
2010-10-16T03:10:00.000Z	mattvv	sebsebseb	Yeah the top and left side, it seems like its half loadded, semi transparent and I cannot see icons, menus or anything, its just the background
2010-10-16T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	ok which graphics card?
2010-10-16T03:13:00.000Z	mattvv	sebsebseb	ATI Technologies Inc RS482 [Radeon Xpress 200M]
2010-10-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	bingo
2010-10-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	thats probably it then
2010-10-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	by default Unity doesn't work with Nivida,  it does however with the propritary driver, and I think things are like thsi for ATI as well
2010-10-16T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	need a card with the support  Unity or mutter, needs by default, for it to just work
2010-10-16T03:14:00.000Z	mattvv	sebsebseb	makes sense, I tried looking for propertiery driver using the /usr/bin/jockey-gtk, do you suggest trying ATI website?
2010-10-16T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	uhmm  you would want to install from repo really, but ATI isn't always so simple to just install from repo,  as far as I know
2010-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	if you can't get this working well
2010-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	some how can use the old look that 10.04 uses in 10.10 netbook edition as well, but not sure how.   desktop edition woudl work on there, and there  are also some pretty good alternative netbook distros out there, such as jolicloud  based on Ubuntu, and I guess meego or whatever its called as well
2010-10-16T03:17:00.000Z	mattvv	sebsebseb	I'll try the ATI fix and if it doesn't work i'll swap back to the Desktop edition- Thanks for your help :)
2010-10-16T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	ok np
2010-10-16T03:53:00.000Z	mattvv	sebsebseb	sadly fglrx drivers no good, going to give the desktop edition a go instead
2010-10-16T03:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mattvv	oh
