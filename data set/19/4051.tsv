2009-04-04T03:14:00.000Z	thebackwash	unko	again, talk to them
2009-04-04T03:14:00.000Z	thebackwash	unko	get their opinion
2009-04-04T03:14:00.000Z	thebackwash	unko	because frankly it's better to talk to someone like that right now than to plug it in and risk further data loss by trying something that anonymous strangers on the internet tell you
