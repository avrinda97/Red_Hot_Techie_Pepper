2004-12-14T07:54:00.000Z	spiritz	titbread	: no officially but you can install kde debian pakcage. Works fine
2004-12-14T07:55:00.000Z	titbread	spiritz	how can i do that?
2004-12-14T07:55:00.000Z	spiritz	titbread	: as debian reposites in synaptic, then enable then and install kde packages
2004-12-14T07:57:00.000Z	titbread	spiritz	 my linux computer doesnt have access to the internet, is there anyway i can download kde and get it onto the ubuntu box via a cd for instance or a usb pen drive?
2004-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	spiritz	titbread	: you should go on the kde website then in the download section there should be ftp reposites where you can download all the required .deb files
2004-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	titbread	spiritz	 thanks
2004-12-14T08:01:00.000Z	spiritz	titbread	: marsjays is right
2004-12-14T08:01:00.000Z	titbread	spiritz	Ok then I think I might just download debian and install that
2004-12-14T08:02:00.000Z	spiritz	titbread	: the easiest way would be to temporary connect ur box to internet
