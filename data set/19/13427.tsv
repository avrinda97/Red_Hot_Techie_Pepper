2005-12-26T09:16:00.000Z	shinu		im mounting my ext3 partition with options: auto,rw,user,users,exec. what else do i need for it to be rw for a normal user?
2005-12-26T09:17:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	your partition should be writable as it stands
2005-12-26T09:17:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	it isnt, i tried to copy a directory to it but it says : mv: cannot create directory ... : Permission denied
2005-12-26T09:18:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	that isn't the partition's problem. You need to set permissions in the root directory
2005-12-26T09:18:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	oh, chmod?
2005-12-26T09:18:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	yes
2005-12-26T09:19:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	okies okies, first time im using an ext3 as a files partition so.. ^^' thanks a lot
2005-12-26T09:19:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	to be on the safe side, create a subdirectory instead and change the permissions on that
2005-12-26T09:20:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	why?.. i want to use the whole partition..
2005-12-26T09:21:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	it makes it more difficult to accidently delete the whole file structure!
2005-12-26T09:22:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	would it be the same if i change everything in it to a+rw and make the dir itself ro?
2005-12-26T09:24:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	that would do the same thing, i think
2005-12-26T09:25:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	ok then, ill do that, thanks :)
2005-12-26T09:34:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	define gb
2005-12-26T09:37:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	you can choose to use less inodes if you wish
2005-12-26T09:38:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	and why is it using more by default?
2005-12-26T09:39:00.000Z	mcphail	shinu	i'd stick to the defaults
2005-12-26T09:40:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	ok then, 1.5gb is not so much a loss :P
2005-12-26T09:40:00.000Z	shinu	mcphail	trappist : is xfs any good?
