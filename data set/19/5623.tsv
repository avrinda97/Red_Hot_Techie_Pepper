2009-07-29T04:00:00.000Z	LjL		uhm, i'm on Hardy, not using network manager but simply /etc/network/interface, with a card that gets identified as RT2500 (and driven by the wlan0 + wmaster0 combo0). i'm trying to make it connect to an ad-hoc network, but it'll refuse to set mode from interface. clues why?
2009-07-29T04:02:00.000Z	jpds	LjL	Oh hi!

2010-10-01T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	jpds	also, did it always resolve to a swedish host? :o
2010-10-01T17:39:00.000Z	jpds	LjL	No.
2010-10-01T17:40:00.000Z	jpds	LjL	The Swedes wanted to benchmark their new 10Gbps network though.
2010-10-01T17:42:00.000Z	jpds	LjL	But America waking up was a bit too much.
2010-10-02T01:07:00.000Z	LjL	jpds	do you think that was intentional?
2010-10-02T01:07:00.000Z	jpds	LjL	Potentially.
