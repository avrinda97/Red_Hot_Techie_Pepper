2012-03-18T01:48:00.000Z	lisakelly		hello ubunters :)
2012-03-18T01:48:00.000Z	lisakelly		how much disk space is needed to install Ubuntu?  Smallest amount?
2012-03-18T01:49:00.000Z	lisakelly		is 12GB partition OK?
2012-03-18T01:49:00.000Z	lisakelly		do I need to create 2 partitions to install Ubuntu?  one for Ubuntu and one for swap file?
2012-03-18T01:50:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	you don't need a SWAP partition, but it's recommended
2012-03-18T01:51:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	Normally a SWAP partition is twice the size of your RAM
2012-03-18T02:09:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	You sure can.
2012-03-18T02:10:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	Goodluck! You can also use Wubi if you find it too hard.
2012-03-18T02:11:00.000Z	lisakelly	duped	but Wubu isn't as secure or fast as running it on its own?
2012-03-18T02:12:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	All it does is set it up for you. Wubi just sets up linux for install so you don't have to use a cdrom or usb.
2012-03-18T02:12:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	Check it out http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer
2012-03-18T02:13:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	It's easy to remove, don't worry.
2012-03-18T02:13:00.000Z	lisakelly	duped	:)
2012-03-18T02:14:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	Wubi is at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer
2012-03-18T02:14:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	NOPE, I'm 100% human.
2012-03-18T02:15:00.000Z	lisakelly	duped	just checking because you seem to answer my questions within 1 second lol :)
2012-03-18T02:15:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	I actually was answering a previous question... and answered your question before your asked... more like a mind reader.
2012-03-18T02:16:00.000Z	lisakelly	duped	hheeh ;)
2012-03-18T02:16:00.000Z	duped	lisakelly	You can use Wubi and still update linux, install stuff, etc.
