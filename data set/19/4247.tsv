2009-03-07T14:37:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu		hi guys  i need help with matlab 6.5 r13 installation via wine, can someone help me out?
2009-03-07T14:38:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	have you tried winehq?
2009-03-07T14:39:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	no, whats the channel name
2009-03-07T14:41:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	nvm i found it
2009-03-15T11:36:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	you may mean chown
2009-03-15T11:47:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	depends on the dir/file what are the current permissians,
2009-03-15T11:49:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	rwx for root & root
2009-03-15T11:51:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	what about groups
2009-03-15T11:54:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	?
2009-03-15T11:55:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	drwxrwxrwx 1 root root       0 2008-06-02 13:44 uoastuff
2009-03-15T11:55:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	thats what I get when I ls the parent directory of the folder I wanna samba-share
2009-03-15T11:56:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	think that means owner = root, group = root & their rw perm is rwx
2009-03-15T11:57:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	you seem to have read write and exe permissians for root, groups and others so i cant se it being a permissians issue,
2009-03-15T11:59:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	right but (assuming i interpreted the ls-l o/p right that is) the only people that have rwx authorizations are 1. the owner = root 2.People in the group = root....im trying to share the folder while logged in a different account
2009-03-15T12:01:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	others has read write exe permissans as well as group and owner, others is everyone else.
2009-03-15T12:02:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	effectively its been cmod 777ed
2009-03-15T12:02:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	then why cant I share it?
2009-03-15T12:02:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	koshari	http://pastebin.com/m63424fe4
2009-03-15T12:05:00.000Z	koshari	ohletmeinnowjesu	i suspect it may be a ntfs permissians thing, can you share a parent and symlink the folder from there?
