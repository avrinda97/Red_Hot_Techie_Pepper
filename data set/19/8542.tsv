2007-05-05T11:02:00.000Z	thinman1189		Hi all. I seem to be having some trouble updating from dapper to edgy. I boot to a black screen. I tried going into grub and deleting all instances of 'splash quiet' or 'quiet splash' but it hasn't helped. I checked the site and I've seen similar cases but none of the solutions have helped. I ultimately am just going to update to feisty so if there's a way for me to just skip fixing edgy and go straight to updating to feisty that'd be gre
2007-05-05T11:03:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	dapper -> edgy is known to have upgrade issues
2007-05-05T11:03:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	for feisty a lot of effort was put into a smooth dist-upgrade process
2007-05-05T11:04:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	i would recommend a clean install if you have tha toption, for edgy that will be faster than fixing the dist-upgrade
2007-05-05T11:04:00.000Z	thinman1189	holycow	I want to update to feisty anyway. is there a way I can update it from recovery mode?
2007-05-05T11:07:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	ah *hmm* some thinkin/plannin will be reuquired i guess
2007-05-05T11:07:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	obviously you backup home via usb key, yes you can use knoppix, put a usb flash drive in and yeah just copy it over
2007-05-05T11:09:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	thus if you can download a feisty cd and burn it that would be cool
2007-05-05T11:09:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	does that give you a good idea of your options?
2007-05-05T11:10:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	actually its still working let me guess you probably have a laptop or a box with an intel chipset right?
2007-05-05T11:11:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	it is possible also that you have a brand new mobo with the latest chipset right?
2007-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	again, downloading feisty via knoppix and burning that off is your best bet and least aggravating.  just make sure you right click on your hd mount points on the desktop and set them to write
2007-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	thinman1189	holycow	my video card is pretty horrible. it's an xgi volari, lol. I'm going to try a back up and a downloaded install cd. Should I try and update my drivers first? I assume that for the download I choose the second option, for 64bit AMD?

2007-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	no idea, don't you have onboard video by chance? if so you can try that as a default, i have never heard of a volari, no clue what driver that might use
2007-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	thinman1189	holycow	I do but I've never used it. Would Dapper have even operated if there wasn't an available driver?
2007-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	well why not try it? what have you got to loose?
2007-10-15T08:40:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	wait for gutsy to be released if you can, then download the live cd.  that should be a nice quick test
2007-10-15T08:41:00.000Z	holycow	thinman1189	oh you are ABOUT to buy the part? maybe not a usefull suggestion then
