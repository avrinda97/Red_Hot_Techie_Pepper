2009-03-08T14:17:00.000Z	glymph	kjdro	are you using a USB 2.0 port, for starters?
2009-03-08T14:17:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	: yes
2009-03-08T14:18:00.000Z	glymph	kjdro	and what kind of transfer speeds do you get?
2009-03-08T14:18:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	i want to untar debian bases system on to a 4 gb flash disk.. and it takes almost a day to do it..
2009-03-08T14:19:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	to say an aprox transfer speed i am at 28% in say 3 hours or more
2009-03-08T14:19:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	i even used pci=reoutirq at bootup
2009-03-08T14:23:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	in windows copying is ok. sympthoms: copying some files .. and then it stops .. then after some time copies a few more files... so on
2009-03-08T14:25:00.000Z	glymph	kjdro	I don't know, I suggest looking into the "dmesg" output, and the messagelog, check the transfer speed to the fliesystem and to the raw device to see if there's a difference (say with 'pv' for speed), aside from that, I dunno sorry.
2009-03-08T14:25:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	good idea
2009-03-08T14:26:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	what dose this mea: [37798.412571] usb 8-1: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
2009-03-08T14:26:00.000Z	glymph	kjdro	I'm not sure, I suggest searching online for the error and the version of the USB drive, you may find it needs updating
2009-03-08T14:27:00.000Z	glymph	kjdro	I mean driver, of course
2009-03-08T14:27:00.000Z	kjdro	glymph	yeah .. another good idea..
