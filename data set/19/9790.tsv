2006-09-21T08:38:00.000Z	linuxactivist	starscalling	you can use it, but I don't think you can "integrate" it into gnome.  Is integration really possible?
2006-09-21T08:39:00.000Z	starscalling	linuxactivist	ive used different file managers other than nautilus in gnome before

2006-09-21T08:39:00.000Z	starscalling		but it doesnt support doing backgrounds for desktop?
2006-09-21T08:40:00.000Z	starscalling		what about desktop icons
2006-09-21T08:40:00.000Z	linuxactivist	starscalling	true, but were the integrated... meaning that the context menus opened files in your file manager, the file open and save dialogs opened in your file manager.  If you can do this?  How?
