2005-07-03T07:53:00.000Z	pietro_spina	keffo	I had to install windows on the disk when it was a master, then swapped them around...
2005-07-03T07:53:00.000Z	keffo	pietro_spina	but you couldnt start windows in anyways?
2005-07-03T07:55:00.000Z	pietro_spina	keffo	If you did something similar the you will have to use the map( ) command and rootnoverify also... Hang on I'll post a link..
