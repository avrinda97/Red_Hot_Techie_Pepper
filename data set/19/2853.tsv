2010-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	bikcmp		Hi, I'm trying to do a action with apt, however it seems to be... like, stuck trying to get dependancies.
2010-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	bikcmp		sudo apt-get -f install doesn't fix it either.
2010-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	bikcmp		sure, one minute
2010-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	can you expand on the issue and what you're trying to install
2010-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	bikcmp	ikonia	anything at all
2010-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	ok - the error message is quite clear
2010-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	it's not just hanging, it's giving you an error explaining the issue
2010-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	bikcmp	ikonia	oh, i didn't even look at that; even if that was resolved, it would still try to fix libungif4g
2010-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	 no it's not
2010-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	resolve the error first
2010-08-30T23:48:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	please pastebin the output
2010-08-30T23:48:00.000Z	bikcmp	ikonia	doing so right now
2010-08-30T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	again - look at the error message
2010-08-30T23:49:00.000Z	bikcmp	ikonia	yep.  What should I do to resolve that?
2010-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	look at your repos !
2010-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	you have a dapper archive and a lucid archive in there
2010-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	you can't mix and match like that
2010-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	your system will be totally unusable
2010-08-30T23:53:00.000Z	ikonia	bikcmp	do you see/understand the error
