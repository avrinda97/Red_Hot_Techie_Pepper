2007-04-11T08:20:00.000Z	sharp15		has the most recent update to X caused a large number of problems?  my X server is crashing with the error "X: cannot stat /tmp/.X11-unix (Permission denied), aborting.
2007-04-11T08:21:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	"ls -ld /tmp/.X11-unix" in a terminal, what does it say?
2007-04-11T08:22:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	it says "ls: /tmp/.X11-unix: Permission denied"
2007-04-11T08:22:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	i'm running that command as root.
2007-04-11T08:22:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	ok, "ls -ld /tmp" then
2007-04-11T08:25:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	that looks correct, weird that you can't list /tmp/.X11-unix the same way
2007-04-11T08:26:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	am i at the point of reinstall?  even root can't access the file. (also bash is coloring it red?)
2007-04-11T08:27:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	which dir is colored red?
2007-04-11T08:28:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	.X11-unix
2007-04-11T08:28:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	and it has drwxrwxrwt in fron of it if you run "ls -la /tmp" ?
2007-04-11T08:34:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	then reboot
2007-04-11T08:30:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	no that was just the /tmp directory.  .X11-unix has a "?" for each entry on its record in the list.
2007-04-11T08:32:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	hm... myabe try removing the whole /tmp-dir and create it again
2007-04-11T08:33:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	can i assume the recreate part can be done by rebooting?
2007-04-11T08:33:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	I would try "sudo rm -rf /tmp ; sudo mkdir /tmp ; sudo chmod 1777 /tmp"
2007-04-11T08:37:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	i'm getting 4 "cannot lstat" errors from "rm -rf /tmp"
2007-04-11T08:37:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	hm, ok, then I would try to boot the ubuntu liveCD, and do it from there
2007-04-11T08:38:00.000Z	reep	sharp15	also, it could sound like there's an error on the filesystem
2007-04-11T08:38:00.000Z	sharp15	reep	so reinstall time. fun. thanks. i'll have to deal with this later.
