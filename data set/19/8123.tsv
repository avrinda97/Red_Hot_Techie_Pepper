2008-08-02T09:19:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	it's virtual. you can't. why would you
2008-08-02T09:20:00.000Z	leftyfb	wols_	because i'm trying to reinstall grub onto a mounted and chrooted filesystem
2008-08-02T09:20:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	bind mount

2008-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	leftyfb	wols_	neither "bind mount dev" or "bind mount proc" or "mount bind proc" or "mount bind dev" work
2008-08-30T20:38:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	repeating useless info won't get you any more help. check your Xorg logs
2008-08-30T20:39:00.000Z	leftyfb	wols_	how do you consider every relevant details I supplied useless?
2008-08-30T20:39:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	because except the card type it is not relevant
2008-08-30T20:40:00.000Z	leftyfb	wols_	every piece of info I gave is relevant.
2008-08-30T20:40:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	please stop
2008-08-30T20:40:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	if you can't do what I told you, stop talking to me. good day
2008-08-30T20:44:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	did you use envy or envyng?
2008-08-30T20:46:00.000Z	leftyfb	wols_	"envy" won't install in 8.04. I've already mentioned i'm privy to basic nvidia troubleshooting and don't need a walkthrough with the common sense basics. If you're not going to listen to me, then please stop talking to me,.
2008-08-30T20:46:00.000Z	wols_	leftyfb	good luck getting any help with your attitude. have a nice day
