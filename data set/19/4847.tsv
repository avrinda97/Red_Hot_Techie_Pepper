2008-10-25T19:17:00.000Z	deo		Hi all
2008-10-25T19:18:00.000Z	deo		I had a question about mounting a digital camera via USB
2008-10-25T19:19:00.000Z	deo		I plugged in my camera and ubuntu told me I didn't have permission to mount the device
2008-10-25T19:19:00.000Z	deo		I also tried under to do a sudo mount -a and that didn't work either...
2008-10-25T19:20:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	use sudo .. are you the only user of the system?
2008-10-25T19:21:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	I did a sudo mount -a and that didn't work either
2008-10-25T19:21:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	are you the only user of the machine?check whether you have permissions to use external devices
2008-10-25T19:22:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	yes I am the only user, how do I check to see if i have permission to use external devices?
2008-10-25T19:23:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	System->Administration->Users and groups
2008-10-25T19:25:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	Users and groups says I have access to external storage devices
2008-10-25T19:26:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	hmm .. what happens when you plugin the device?
2008-10-25T19:27:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	a window  pops up and says cannot mount volume. you are not privileged to mount this volume.
2008-10-25T19:27:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	mount it through the terminal
2008-10-25T19:30:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	ok I got it to mount that way
2008-10-25T19:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	yay you made it :)
2008-10-25T19:32:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	do you have any idea as to y it won't mount auto? I and trying to decide whether to change from using fedora to ubuntu..
2008-10-25T19:33:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	am really not much qualified to answer to that, but i feel it may be the permissions on your devices...not sure though
2008-10-25T19:34:00.000Z	deo	arvind_khadri	well thanks alot! glad it works
2008-10-25T19:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	deo	:) am glad too
