2007-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	iyigun		hi. I have an ntfs drive, which I mount in startup in /etc/fstab. It was working until today, i didn't change anything but it doesn't work anymore.
2007-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	sudo mount -a
2007-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	any errors?
2007-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	iyigun		no errors
2007-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	check your mount (NTFS drive) again
2007-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	iyigun		when I mount it manually it doesn't work also
2007-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	see it now?
2007-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	iyigun	neverblue	what do you mean 'check'?
2007-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	iyigun		no, there's no message
2007-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	view the filesystem?
2007-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	what do you mean, no message, from what application?
2007-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	iyigun	neverblue	I unmounted ntfs and ran mount -a again, there's a message now
2007-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	can you see the device (check your fstab for the exact location) in /dev ?
2007-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	iyigun	neverblue	Mount is denied because NTFS logfile is unclean.
2007-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	iyigun		it says windows was not shut down cleanly
2007-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	neverblue	iyigun	your just doing your own thing now, it appears
2007-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	neverblue		good luck :)
2007-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	iyigun	neverblue	I can see the device. It's there. I'll try to  restart windows, and see what happens
2007-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	iyigun	neverblue	thanks
