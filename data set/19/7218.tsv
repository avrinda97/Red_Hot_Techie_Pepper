2008-03-15T20:30:00.000Z	ries		Hey guys... do-release-upgrade fails badly on a fresh installed edgy (using debootstrap on a domU)  using do-release-upgrade
2008-03-15T20:31:00.000Z	ries		I tried googling.. but couldn't find a bug entry about.. anybody knows a other update method??
2008-03-15T20:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	are you trying to get to gutsy?
2008-03-15T20:32:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	In the end I am trying to go to gutsy...
2008-03-15T20:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	what are you running now?
2008-03-15T20:32:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	edgy
2008-03-15T20:34:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	so its a server install of edgy, and you tried to upgrade?  even if it failed, wouldn't it now be gutsy, at least repository wise?
2008-03-15T20:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	did you follow me on that one?
2008-03-15T20:35:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	I use debootstrap from my dom0 to install edgu (we run edgy on dom0) to kick off a new domU... then we are planning to upgrade... this worked fine on already running domU's.. only on this fresh one it seems to fail
2008-03-15T20:35:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	as we don't update dom0 to new release... we only do it on domU's
2008-03-15T20:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	sorry mate, I don't know what dom0 and domU's are, so this may be out of my league.  BUT, I believe a manual install involves just changing your sources file, and changing all references of edgy to gutsy, then running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade a few times
2008-03-15T20:37:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	we are running xen... we host a couple of virtual servers....
2008-03-15T20:37:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	I will use that.... I always used it running debian.... I was just hoping to 'ubuntu' method would also work again
2008-03-15T20:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	one more thing, you may have to upgrade to feisty, and then to gutsy
2008-03-15T20:38:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	will do that in two steps.... will let you know how it goes
2008-03-15T20:45:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	: from feisty to gutsy i can use do-release-upgrade again... huraaay
2008-03-15T20:45:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	sounds like its working  :)
2008-03-15T20:46:00.000Z	ries	danbhfive	actually...looks like it... my server is 9.000KM away... so I cannot hear it :)
2008-03-15T20:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	ries	it may be in the repos, but I don't think its installed by default.  Not even the JRE is default installed
