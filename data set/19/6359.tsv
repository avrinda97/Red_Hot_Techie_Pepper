2008-02-01T08:57:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	i use it all the time
2008-02-01T08:57:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	but, thats because i work from the cmd line primarily
2008-02-01T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	personally I've been using sudo as self protection long before ubuntu made it their security model. I'm in complete agreement with them
2008-02-01T08:59:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	for beginning users, yes...it definitely helps keep people from doing something loony
2008-02-01T09:03:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	cellofellow and on my install, it's still hdX in gutsy
2008-02-01T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	ohhh, that was harsh
2008-02-01T10:01:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	i'm a little buzzed...and a lot tired of noob questions :) sorry
2008-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	true, but harsh more correctly
2008-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	i know....
2008-02-01T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	lol, take a break, spend some time on #debian and come back to the gentler side :)
2008-02-01T10:08:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	thanks....i'm drunk right now
2008-02-01T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	been there, done that, been embarrassed. Took a year off. Don't do the same :)
2008-02-01T10:22:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	partition magic seems to have a pretty good track record resizing ntfs partitions
2008-02-01T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	heard both ways myself. gparted destroyed my windows install, but since I'd only owned the laptop for about an hour, no harm done
2008-02-01T10:25:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	i wish i'd never played
2008-02-01T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	some of the things people do to their ubuntu, there's gotta way to escape kde and xfce
2008-02-01T10:35:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	i was just saying that if you really wanted the adobe version, you're out of luck
2008-02-01T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	gmcastil	ah, missed that part.
2008-02-01T10:36:00.000Z	gmcastil	nickrud	sorry, wasn't clear - you can read pdfs, just probably not with adobe's thang, unless they have released a 64-bit version (unlikely as hell)
