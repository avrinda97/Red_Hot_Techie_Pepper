2006-10-16T08:57:00.000Z	variant		[erisco] : what you trying to do exactly?
2006-10-16T08:57:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	pingswept said telnet sends out the password (of whatever it may be) without encryption
2006-10-16T08:58:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	he said it should show up by scanning the packets going through the network
2006-10-16T08:58:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	but, I cannot find any relevant information
2006-10-16T09:00:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	even when telneting into the SSH port?
2006-10-16T09:01:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	to get the password lol
2006-10-16T09:03:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	yes please :D I was not able to find ANY packets during the scan that had both a source and destination of my IP
2006-10-16T09:05:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	yes I do. I just don't know the password for it
2006-10-16T09:05:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	and there is a telnet server with it I do believe
2006-10-16T09:06:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	okay maybe I am wrong. Might have an SSH server
2006-10-16T09:06:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	no telnet server on it :(
2006-10-16T09:06:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	it is all SSH, as it is accessed VIA outside world so
2006-10-16T09:07:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	what is nmap it (nmap -A -vv IP ?
2006-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	I was right, only SSH on it
2006-10-16T09:09:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	well I cannot even remember where I was with starting it. I do have it installed
2006-10-16T09:10:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	"bash: /etc/init.d/telnetd: No such file or directory"
2006-10-16T09:10:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	you mean a wildcard?
2006-10-16T09:11:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	still no file or directory
2006-10-16T09:11:00.000Z	[erisco] 	variant	I physically looked, no telnet directory
