2008-05-04T02:00:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	no idea...
2008-05-04T02:01:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	go to www.nopaste.org and upload your /etc/X11/xorg.conf then paste the link please
2008-05-04T02:02:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	i can't at the moment... typing to you from a different computer.. .i'm reinstalling 8.04 at the moment
2008-05-04T02:02:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	ok even if your xserver is a mess you don't need to reinstall for that, that is one of the advantages of linux;)
2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	X-server is the thing that produces your graphical output
2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	yeah, but i've installed too many drivers and crap, i just want to start over fresh... im not losing anything
2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	ok, when you have a fresh install is the screen already blank at that time?
2008-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	nope, only when i enable restricted drivers
2008-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	or did that happen after driver experiments? if so what drivers did you install and how?

2008-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	ok, sec pls
2008-05-04T02:06:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	i'm tempted to just buy a different video card. i've had nothing but problems with this one. but noone sells agp 8x anymore... at least not locally.
2008-05-04T02:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	that sounds bad, sry but in that case im afraid i can't help either...
2008-05-04T02:08:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	no matter what video card i've had, i've always had problems with ubuntu. i was never able to get it to work right, ever since ubuntu 6.x
2008-05-04T02:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	!!! i never had any trouble actually and i have seen alot different hardware, you gotta be quite unlucky so...
2008-05-04T02:09:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	the only time i was somewhat lucky was with my other laptop... but yeah, every video card i've used gave me trouble. :(
2008-05-04T02:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	damntourists	i had nvidias i had atis and intels and so far they all worked one way or the other gg*knocking on wood*
2008-05-04T02:11:00.000Z	damntourists	remoteCTRL	yeah i've gone between nvidia and ati... all didn't work. im tempted to throw my computer out the 4th story window.
