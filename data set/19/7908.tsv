2007-07-11T11:25:00.000Z	bluebanana		i'd like to create a website. What programs are there for beginners?
2007-07-11T11:26:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	you want visual or code?
2007-07-11T11:26:00.000Z	bluebanana	neozen	Visual is best!!! With maybe a code option, too. But visual is what I primarily want, I think.
2007-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	there are limited options for visual-ish editors in linux
2007-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	bluebanana	neozen	so it's a matter of typing html/code?
2007-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	have you considered just using open office and saving in .html?
2007-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	works just fine for basic pages
2007-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	bluebanana	neozen	what about cascading menu stuff?
2007-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	......cascading menus....
2007-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	sounds like ajax type stuff
2007-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	plenty on the net to read about that
2007-07-11T11:29:00.000Z	bluebanana	neozen	ajax for a simple home / subfolder / 3rdDown thingy on every page?
2007-07-11T11:30:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	you'd have to be more descriptive as to what you are looking for
2007-07-11T11:30:00.000Z	neozen	bluebanana	those folder listings are usually generated on the fly just so you know
2007-07-11T11:31:00.000Z	bluebanana	neozen	this is what i mean. pls check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414194. See the top part:  Ubuntu Forums > The Ubuntu Forum Community  > Absolute Beginner Talk . that's what i want on every page.
