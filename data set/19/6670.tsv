2009-05-21T00:02:00.000Z	Volkodav		I am having xmodmap problem in xfce - certain keys do not respond I manually put them in  ~/.Xmodmap and doing  xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap helps for a bit but then it is losing config again
2009-05-21T00:02:00.000Z	Volkodav		anybody has the sale problems - google or forums did not help much
2009-05-21T00:02:00.000Z	Volkodav		9.04
2009-05-21T00:02:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	rename .Xmodmap to .xmodmaprc
2009-05-21T00:04:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	also I put the xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap in autostart but it will not work - where is the file for autostart so I can do it manually ?
2009-05-21T00:04:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	in xfce? not sure. is the autostart script +x?
2009-05-21T00:05:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	they have the gui thing in xfce for autostart but for this particular cvommand it does not work for some reason
2009-05-21T01:07:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	I renamed the file ran xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc and in about 30 mintutes mapping is wrong again
2009-05-21T01:07:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	oh...
2009-05-21T01:07:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	i thought the problem was that it didn't map it on login
2009-05-21T01:08:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	map it on login will be the least of concerns if I get it to hold on to the changes I made
2009-05-21T01:08:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	what does your file look like?
2009-05-21T01:09:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	can I paste in pm ? it is about 8 lines
2009-05-21T01:10:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	sure
2009-05-21T01:10:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	http://paste.ubuntu.com/176670/
2009-05-21T01:11:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	do you know what xmodmap -pke looks like before, after applying, and after it stops working?
2009-05-21T01:14:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	I am getting this info trying to compare - do you mean just to apply the changes in the original file in xmodmap ? But there are tons of them us us_intern and I really do not know which one is it using
2009-05-21T01:17:00.000Z	raylu	Volkodav	tons of what?
2009-05-21T01:39:00.000Z	Volkodav	raylu	which exact file should I check for change in xmodmap ?
