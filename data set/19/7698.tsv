2007-07-29T10:15:00.000Z	Romnous		is there a way to synchronize a folder on a linux system with one on a windows computer in the network??
2007-07-29T10:16:00.000Z	Romnous		is there any way to make a linux server act as a domain controller of some sort??
2007-07-29T10:16:00.000Z	Romnous		or to synchronize folders between a linux computer and a windows computer in a network?
2007-07-29T10:17:00.000Z	Romnous		that's a terminal command right?
2007-07-29T10:17:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	not that i know of...is it just for storage not for execution right?
2007-07-29T10:18:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	define what do you mean by synchronize ?
2007-07-29T10:20:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	have you looked at Linux Terminal Server -- LTSP
2007-07-29T10:24:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	you have to dig up info on samba
2007-07-29T10:40:00.000Z	Romnous	bulmer	windows xp professional, and home
2007-07-29T10:36:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	here is a link how to setup LTSP, install samba as service has link to it --  http://www.reallylinux.com/docs/setupltsp.shtml
2007-07-29T10:36:00.000Z	Romnous	bulmer	will check it out
2007-07-29T10:38:00.000Z	Romnous	bulmer	doesn't seem to promising to me :/
2007-07-29T10:39:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	it shows how to install LTSP, then a link to install samba
2007-07-29T10:39:00.000Z	Romnous	bulmer	yah i know, but that doesn't synchronize right?
2007-07-29T10:39:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	well it doesnt off the bat, so one has to write a script in window (wsh?) to write to samba i gather
2007-07-29T10:39:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	which windows os do you have?
2007-07-29T10:41:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	well with XP, you have to write a script to make the synchronization automatic, with AT or somekind of taskscheduler/manager
2007-07-29T10:42:00.000Z	Romnous	bulmer	isn't their ANY way to just synchronize folders between linux and windows
2007-07-29T10:43:00.000Z	bulmer	Romnous	anything behind those you click has some kind of a script or command to do it for you..i already suggest AT and taskmanager
