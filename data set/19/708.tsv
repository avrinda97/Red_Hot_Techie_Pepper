2011-10-08T18:21:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	alright thank you very much!
2011-10-08T18:25:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	so have you got any kinds of solutions for my problem?
2011-10-08T18:26:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	i guess u just remove the newer python
2011-10-08T18:26:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	well how can I remove the python 2.7 who I actually installed yesterday manually?
2011-10-08T18:26:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	how about dpkg-reconfigure python...
2011-10-08T18:27:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	did u install python 2.7 manually
2011-10-08T18:29:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	oh :( i dono the exact solution... try this ok. sudo dpkg-reconfigure python2.6
2011-10-08T18:30:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	what exactly does that command?
2011-10-08T18:30:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	I just wanna put the 2.6 as default on my ubuntu 10.04
2011-10-08T18:31:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	it resets the package defaults so incase python 2.7 overwrote 2.6 it MAY reset back to 2.6
2011-10-08T18:31:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	well, let's try, what's the worst thing can happen?
2011-10-08T18:35:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	nothing... trying to reconfigure the packet 2.6 of python, the default version is still the 2.7
2011-10-08T18:39:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	really sorry :( did u generate python 2.7 packages and then install ? so that u could have removed them easily?
2011-10-08T18:39:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	unfortunatley not! anyway nevermind and thanks for your help!
2011-10-08T18:41:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	could you please tell me at least how can I remove the python 2.7 if I compiled it manually yesterday?
2011-10-08T18:44:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	you said u had compiled it manually right?
2011-10-08T18:44:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	yup
2011-10-08T18:46:00.000Z	xgt001	Mike-Wazoski	i donno much about how to remove something after u installed it manually by a non dpkg way.. due to the change in config files python 2.7 might have made
2011-10-08T18:47:00.000Z	Mike-Wazoski	xgt001	okay thanks for your help I gotta go now I'll try later! thanks for your time man!
