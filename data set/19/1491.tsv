2011-04-05T14:49:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter		hi. I'm looking for an advice regarding the maintenance period of ubuntu LTS
2011-04-05T14:49:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter		afaik, desktop is supported for 3 years, while server for 5 years. this is correct?
2011-04-05T14:50:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter		but, what I'm wondering about, what does that mean in particular?
2011-04-05T14:50:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter		I mean is there a list of packages classified as server packages
2011-04-05T14:51:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter		I can start with either desktop or server version and build what I'm after
2011-04-05T14:51:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	i don't suggest using a server and building a desktop... i did it once... a lot of things weren't working quite right...
2011-04-05T14:53:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	i believe "support" generally means updates, bug fixes etc.
2011-04-05T14:53:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter	fisch246	sure, thus the question is what precise list of packages receive 3 years of updates and which one receives 5 years
2011-04-05T14:54:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	i suppose anything Ubuntu says they support... anything that's 3rd party is a no go unless backed by a PPA
2011-04-05T14:56:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	well if you get 10.04 you should be set until april 2013
2011-04-05T14:56:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter	fisch246	will do that, thanks
2011-04-05T14:56:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	just make sure you do "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade" before doing anything
2011-04-05T14:56:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter	fisch246	certainly
2011-04-05T14:57:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	also i suggest not doing  that special partitioning thing they got on server, unless you know what you're doing...
2011-04-05T14:59:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter	fisch246	I'll certainly use LVM
2011-04-05T15:00:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	no idea, never done LVM... i tend to not use it, as i don't have much experience with it
2011-04-05T15:00:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter	fisch246	I actually used it already, but was looking into btrfs and zfs (fuse) as well
2011-04-05T15:01:00.000Z	fisch246	rhorstkoetter	ah ok... well i don't use server enough to say anything about that
2011-04-05T15:01:00.000Z	rhorstkoetter	fisch246	perfectly fine. just looking for advice. I mean 1500 people in the room may provide 10 experienced people at least ;)
