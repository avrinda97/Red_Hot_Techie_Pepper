2008-11-17T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	you have no problems
2008-11-17T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	thats nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-11-17T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	thats your access point not having the right gateway
2008-11-17T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	look at your routing, default route is the wirless AP,
2008-11-17T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	so you should be able to ping anythig ont he 192.16.1.x network
2008-11-17T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	any anything else will go out of your wirless ap
2008-11-17T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	you don't have to disable wirless
2008-11-17T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	just make your gateway 192.168.0.1
2008-11-17T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	just make your gateway 192.168.1.1
2008-11-17T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	zoople	you don't need to disable wirless to see the defautl route
