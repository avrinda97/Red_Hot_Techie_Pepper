2008-09-01T18:02:00.000Z	genius		hello, how can i remount another root filesystem?
2008-09-01T18:02:00.000Z	wols_	genius	rmount?
2008-09-03T16:45:00.000Z	genius	wols_	i know everything about permisions
2008-09-03T16:21:00.000Z	wols_	genius	sudo touch /forcefsck   and then reboot
2008-09-03T16:21:00.000Z	wols_	genius	or unmount the partition and fsck it
2008-09-03T16:40:00.000Z	wols_	genius	don't tell people to do such things
2008-09-03T16:41:00.000Z	genius	wols_	if he want - he get :)
2008-09-03T16:42:00.000Z	wols_	genius	a) your  "solution" doesn't work and is a really bad one security wise
2008-09-03T16:42:00.000Z	genius	wols_	anyway i've mistaken :) +r i ment +r
2008-09-03T16:42:00.000Z	wols_	genius	you're mistaken in more than one way.
2008-09-03T16:42:00.000Z	wols_	genius	now tell him to undo the damage you've done please
2008-09-03T16:44:00.000Z	wols_	genius	how does this unmake the damage? do you know that suddenly NO file needs to be world writable?
2008-09-03T16:44:00.000Z	genius	wols_	it just make w/w directory
2008-09-03T16:45:00.000Z	wols_	genius	read how permissions work. you really need to read it again before giving any more advice
2008-09-03T16:45:00.000Z	wols_	genius	what you told others to do proves otherwise
2008-09-03T16:51:00.000Z	genius	wols_	i did not put g+r on his dirs :) so no damage.
2008-09-03T16:52:00.000Z	genius	wols_	i use o-r on /home, but someone prefer o+r. i don't think that it is huge security issue on local pc
2008-09-03T16:52:00.000Z	wols_	genius	I was refering to the files INSIDE his home directory
2008-09-03T16:54:00.000Z	genius	wols_	does chmod o+r /home/user change any file in deirectory? :) it does change world-read permission on directory only!!!
