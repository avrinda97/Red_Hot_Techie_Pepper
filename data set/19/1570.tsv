2010-12-21T02:06:00.000Z	oliver3_		So, does anyone know how to make the latest wubi use the iso file I've already downloaded? The wiki says to just place it in the same dir as the wubi installer, but that's blatantly not working.
2010-12-21T02:08:00.000Z	oliver3_		Screw it just gonna hack the wubi source if that's what it'll take...
2010-12-21T02:08:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	why on earth would you do that?
2010-12-21T02:10:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	because it's not behaving how it should. It's supposed to use the iso file in the same directory as itself when present, it isn't. Rather than doing so it's attempting to download the .torrent file (which presumably is < 200kB) which takes almost an hour, then it attempts to download the .iso which takes so long I gave up after 2 days.
2010-12-21T02:10:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	have you considered partitioning your drive and doing a normal install?... something scares me about "hcaking" wubi.
2010-12-21T02:11:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	that's not possible, if it was I would. This machine has no CD drive and I don't own a USB drive to install from.
2010-12-21T02:12:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	honestly, wubi is a big enough train wreck as it is.. you're goign down a slip slope w/ your current plan, but i wish you luck.. i sure wouldn't do it
2010-12-21T02:13:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	meh, I'm literally only going to change the code which downloads the files so it doesn't, and just installs from the files that I'll have placed there.
2010-12-21T02:13:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	surely it can't be that bad of a trainwreck that that'd be a big deal
2010-12-21T02:13:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	i understand that.. but like i said... wubi has enough potential for damage.. I wouldn't go trying to make it worse
2010-12-21T02:13:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	lol.. hang out here for a few days and watch the folks with wubi/unable to boot probs.
2010-12-21T02:14:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	i guess my point is, if you're gonna do it, do it right
2010-12-21T02:14:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	well, I'm not going to touch that code... but if I get that problem I suppose I'll be forced to buy a USB drive lol.
2010-12-21T02:15:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	now all I have to do is actually find the source code in the first place... *sigh*
2010-12-21T02:16:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	you know 1gig thumb drives can be had for about $8-$10 US.. right?
2010-12-21T02:16:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	for a guy living on unemployment social security that's a lot of money
2010-12-21T02:16:00.000Z	KM0201		ya.. i understand.
2010-12-21T02:17:00.000Z	KM0201	oliver3_	got a friend you can borrow one from?
2010-12-21T02:17:00.000Z	oliver3_	KM0201	unfortunately not
