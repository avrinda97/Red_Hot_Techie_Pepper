2007-08-30T05:41:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	It breaks at what point?
2007-08-30T05:42:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	are you on a second computer, and can work on the computer running ubuntu?
2007-08-30T05:44:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	Okay. Uh, let's see. You probably need to hit control-alt-F1 to get to a console. Then run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'. Select the vesa driver (graphics acceleration will be disabled, but you can reconfigure it at your leisure once you know how). Then run 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
2007-08-30T05:44:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	Give me a second and I can probably find the right driver
2007-08-30T05:44:00.000Z	Fivetwentysix	asc	but I can't get into console
2007-08-30T05:45:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	control-alt-F1 doesn't work? That's, hm, not something I've run into before.
2007-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	What's the last thing you see? Is there an orange loading bar at any point?
2007-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	Fivetwentysix	asc	I fixed the live cd just by using the f4 resolution function
2007-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	asc	Fivetwentysix	I really wish I knew, I've been looking for something like that forever. ;p
