2006-11-01T06:12:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	I understand that he is havong problems getting it configured correctly to utilize IPv4?
2006-11-01T06:14:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	No problem. I have a hard time keeping track in here myself :)
2006-11-01T07:49:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	I tried that. No results.
2006-11-01T07:51:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Yep, I downloaded and installed it.
2006-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Maybe it is because I deleted all but one toolbar and crammed everything in there?
2006-11-01T07:53:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Only network monitor, not network manager.
2006-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Ok, which custom app is it?
2006-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	What is a notification bar and how do I install it? :)
2006-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	I am not aware of any notification bar.
2006-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	I might well have done that. how do I get it back?
2006-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Ahhh! There is a network connection thingy now.
2006-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Thank GOD.
2006-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Yeah, I found it.
2006-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	So I cannot use WPA wlan without notification bar switched on? That inhales!
2006-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Well, thanks for your patience and your help anyhow!
2006-11-01T08:06:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	since you are such a nice person and patient helper :) Do you know how I can replace the ubuntu-start-button (and only that one!) in the "Human" theme with the regular gnome paw?
2006-11-01T08:07:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	I do not want to change the whole theme, just that one icon.
2006-11-01T08:11:00.000Z	Kannix	jvai	Thanks. I'll look at it now :)
