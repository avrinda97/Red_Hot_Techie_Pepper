2010-05-24T21:59:00.000Z	mikeshultz		I have a PDF that is being printed directly to the printer as PDF, but the printer does not support it.  Is it evince that is supposed to do the conversion to PS or cups?
2010-05-24T22:00:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	sure; either print or print to file in evince
2010-05-24T22:00:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	Not sure you're understanding.  When printing from PDF, it sends the job as a PDF directly to the printer.
2010-05-24T22:01:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	from evince, that is.
2010-05-24T22:02:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	how have you determined this? what kind of printer?
2010-05-24T22:04:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	Output on the printer gives an error message.  It's an HP 4250.
2010-05-24T22:05:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	and the printer is directly on the network? perhaps the printer driver is misconfigured in cups
2010-05-24T22:05:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	Yes, direct printing from the workstation.
2010-05-24T22:08:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	I guess I'll look into resetting it up.  We took the printers.conf from an older ubuntu machine when we upgraded to 10.04.
2010-05-24T22:09:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	what is the exact error you get on the printer's display?
2010-05-24T22:15:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	This was the only output, on paper, from the printer:  PDF File not printed. 128 MB of memory is required to enable direct PDF printing
2010-05-24T22:15:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	PostScript printing works just fine.
2010-05-24T22:19:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	looks like direct pdf printing is a new feature in cups, so you'll need to disable it in the cups configuration
2010-05-24T22:25:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	would that be cups' configuration or the printer's configuration?
2010-05-24T22:28:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	there's a line starting with *cupsFilter:    "application/vnd.cups-pdf  in the ppd file which describes the printer to cups
2010-05-24T22:28:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	but there may be a more convenient way to change it
2010-05-24T22:29:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	Alright, thanks.
2010-05-25T00:42:00.000Z	mikeshultz	crdlb	There is no cupsFilter lines in the ppd.
2010-05-25T00:46:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeshultz	I'm not an expert on cups, but I see "Filter application/vnd.cups-pdf 0 foomatic-rip" in my /etc/cups/printers.conf, but I guess you probably don't have that if you copied the configuration from an older version
