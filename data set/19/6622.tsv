2008-01-08T03:04:00.000Z	J-_		Is there anyway to fix a read-only file system? lol
2008-01-08T03:05:00.000Z	proq	J-_	yeah, make a copy to a r/w filesystem and use it instead

2008-01-08T03:06:00.000Z	proq	J-_	make a copy of the media to a different media, like a hard drive, and change it
2008-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	J-_	proq	cool thanks. I'm just going to reformat then.
2008-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	proq	J-_	reformat what?
2008-01-08T03:08:00.000Z	J-_		my drive.
2008-01-08T03:08:00.000Z	proq	J-_	huh? why?
2008-01-08T03:08:00.000Z	proq		!fstab | J-_
2008-01-08T03:08:00.000Z	J-_		tried removing kde, and somehow my filesystem became  a "read-only" file system
2008-01-08T03:09:00.000Z	proq	J-_	are you sure you mounted it right? you should check your fstab
2008-01-08T03:09:00.000Z	proq	J-_	you shouldn't reformat it, you just need to set it up right
2008-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	proq	J-_	did you uninstall most of your system when you removed kde? You may have booted into root/system recovery if you did
2008-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	J-_	proq	I didn't mount anything. I installed the kubuntu-desktop metapackage with gnome already installed. I wanted another DE, after playing with it, and figuring it messed up something in my gnome installation, I tried to remove kde, and now that I've removed package(s) that I wasn't suppose to remove, my filesystem is now read only.
