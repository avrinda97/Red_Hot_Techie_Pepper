2011-09-21T05:43:00.000Z	gemini6669		what would be supported
2011-09-21T05:43:00.000Z	gemini6669		I honestly don't care at this point, I have tried a few, without switching over to KDE or going to something stipped down, what would you recommend
2011-09-21T05:44:00.000Z	gemini6669		I grabbed the newest gnome that was in the repository list
2011-09-21T05:44:00.000Z	gemini6669		and it didn't fix the issue
2011-09-21T05:44:00.000Z	gemini6669		unity didn't work
2011-09-21T05:45:00.000Z	gemini6669		and I don't have as much time on my hands to fix showstopper problems as I did when I was in college
2011-09-21T05:45:00.000Z	gemini6669		my mouse doesn't work, the forums have yielded zero answers
2011-09-21T05:45:00.000Z	gemini6669		would you have any recommendations?
2011-09-21T05:46:00.000Z	bombadil_rocks	gemini6669	what do you mean dead spots?
2011-09-21T05:47:00.000Z	gemini6669		usb mouse, people still use a serial mouse? ati radeon 5670 using the default driver, the closed driver yielded more issues
2011-09-21T05:48:00.000Z	bombadil_rocks	gemini6669	i meant what do you mean by deadzones
2011-09-21T05:48:00.000Z	gemini6669		deadspots: I click on a program and it pulls up, any further clicks within the screen do nothing. there is zero response. sometimes it will actually click something that is one the window behind it
2011-09-21T05:49:00.000Z	gemini6669		if I try to x out of the program, nothing happens
2011-09-21T05:49:00.000Z	gemini6669		right click and nothing happens
2011-09-21T05:49:00.000Z	gemini6669		close it out from the toolbar and nothing happens
2011-09-21T05:49:00.000Z	bombadil_rocks	gemini6669	I've actually have had the same problem, i just haven't gotten around to trying to fix it
2011-09-21T05:49:00.000Z	bombadil_rocks	gemini6669	what I noticed is when i switched from compiz to metacity it stoped
2011-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	gemini6669		I can close it from the keyboard. that is usually how I get the focus back to the proper screen to move around and kill that window
2011-09-21T05:51:00.000Z	gemini6669	bombadil_rocks	thanks, I will give that a shot. I kinda hate the idea of losing the pretty stuff but usability is more importany
