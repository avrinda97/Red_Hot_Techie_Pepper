2007-10-23T04:51:00.000Z	Auslegung		Any way to convert my music to Ubuntu format?
2007-10-23T04:52:00.000Z	Auslegung		um, can't remember, something like OGG
2007-10-23T04:52:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	are you unable to play mp3 files?
2007-10-23T04:53:00.000Z	Auslegung		I can play them in Ubuntu, but I want to convert my 8GB of music from Windows to Ubuntu
2007-10-23T04:54:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	are you trying to convert mp3 to ogg or some other format to ogg?
2007-10-23T04:55:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	what I want to do is be able to take all my music from Windows and play it in Ubuntu.  I'm brand new to Ubuntu and don't understand partitioning but think that may be how I do it
2007-10-23T04:56:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	you should not need to convert your music to play it in ubuntu, it should just be a matter of opening the files and they will play.  Is your windows drive / partition mounted?
2007-10-23T04:56:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	I've mounted my HP drive and tried to go into the music folder, which is in My Documents, but My Documents is blank
2007-10-23T04:57:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	it sounds like you may be looking in the wrong place?
2007-10-23T04:58:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	that's possible, but a lot of my folders are blank when mounted that should not be blank
2007-10-23T04:58:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	just in case they are hidden try pressing control + h when you are browsing the folders to make sure hidden files are shown
2007-10-23T04:59:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	so, I can access all of my Windows files in Ubuntu, just by mounting the drive?
2007-10-23T04:59:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	that is correct
2007-10-23T04:59:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	I've been using, on Windows, most of the programs that come standard on Ubuntu, so the switch should be easy, yes?
2007-10-23T04:59:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	like my OpenOffice files should be able to be copied and pasted?
2007-10-23T04:59:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	yes especially if you have been using programs like openoffice etc before
2007-10-23T05:00:00.000Z	Auslegung	troyoz	thank you, I'll try looking harder, have a nice night/day wherever you are
2007-10-23T05:00:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	yes your openoffice files will be able to be opened directly from your mounted windows drive
2007-10-23T05:00:00.000Z	troyoz	Auslegung	no problem, morning here, good luck
