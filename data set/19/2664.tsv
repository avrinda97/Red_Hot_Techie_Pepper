2010-02-05T20:35:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	as boourns just said, they have a notorious reputation for being crap wifi signals
2010-02-05T20:36:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	try powering off your router and plugging it back in
2010-02-05T20:36:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	might help, i do that when there's problems wiht the wifi
2010-02-05T20:36:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	after the power comes back, report back here
2010-02-05T20:36:00.000Z	madch33z3	Trek	done that
2010-02-05T20:37:00.000Z	madch33z3	Trek	had verizon reset the connection too
2010-02-05T20:37:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	interesting.  have they replaced the router yet?
2010-02-05T20:37:00.000Z	madch33z3	Trek	no
2010-02-05T20:37:00.000Z	madch33z3	Trek	thats next
2010-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	what I have is I just plugged a Linksys router into the Actiontec router I got at home and shut off the actiontec wifi :P
2010-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	it rarely drops.  Nevertheless...
2010-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	Trek	madch33z3	have you confirmed the issue is not your wifi card?
2010-02-05T20:39:00.000Z	madch33z3	Trek	thats why i wanted to roll back the driver. i did it before, and it worked.
