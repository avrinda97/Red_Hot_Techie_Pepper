2008-11-07T00:02:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	paul68	I've tried madwifi, it worked until a kernel upgrade
2008-11-07T00:02:00.000Z	paul68	NeT_DeMoN	ok
2008-11-07T00:03:00.000Z	paul68	NeT_DeMoN	perhaps stupid question but do you see your network driver in the restricted drivers list?
2008-11-07T00:04:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	paul68	yeah
2008-11-07T00:05:00.000Z	paul68	NeT_DeMoN	can you enable it there ?
2008-11-07T00:06:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	paul68	yeah but it does nothing
2008-11-07T00:07:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	paul68	I have to restart real quick though so be right back in like two seconds
2008-11-07T00:07:00.000Z	paul68	NeT_DeMoN	ok
