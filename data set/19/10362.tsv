2006-06-29T11:42:00.000Z	darkyoshi372		Guys, I forgot how to choose what apps load at login. Could I have a quick reminder?
2006-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	sessions
2006-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	cwillu	and DaveyJ: Thank you both most kindly!
2006-06-30T10:09:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	have you installed them?
2006-06-30T10:11:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	synaptic, search for linux I believe, install the header package that says it'll always install the latest header package
2006-06-30T10:13:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	 'locate headers' should give you a clue
2006-06-30T10:15:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	did you _just_ install the headers/build-essential/whateveR?
2006-06-30T10:15:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	sudo updatedb first then :)
2006-07-12T06:47:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	any chance the panel itself is crashing?
2006-07-12T06:48:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	cwillu	it usually happens when I switch resolutions.
2006-07-12T06:48:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	no, the switching resolution might have a similar effect of what I'm looking for
2006-07-12T06:49:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	cwillu	do you know how I can get those icons back, or even better, to stop them from going away?
2006-07-12T06:49:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	not really, just having ideas
2006-07-12T06:49:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	do they come back if you kill gnome-panel?
2006-07-12T06:50:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	alternatively, do they disappear when you do it?
2006-07-12T06:50:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	cwillu	now only one application is left.
2006-07-12T06:51:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	okay;  windows has had the same problem before (things not reappearing in the tray after explorer crashes)
2006-07-12T06:52:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	cwillu	This happens much more often than explorer crashing. I don't want to switch to KDE, but I don't know...
2006-07-12T06:53:00.000Z	cwillu	darkyoshi372	sorry, as I said, I'm just shouting idea's, but gnome-panel itself restarting is probably the culprit;
