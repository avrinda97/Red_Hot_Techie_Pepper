2010-10-16T05:04:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		OK, this is my idiotic question for the day: Is there a way to get the grub bootloader to open the CD-ROM drive?
2010-10-16T05:06:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		Or, I guess, some way to open a CD-ROM drive on a non-bootable computer where there's no button on the front to open it?
2010-10-16T05:07:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		....Well, the problem is the drive is empty.
2010-10-16T05:07:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		If I can get a liveCD in there, I can fix the GRUB bootloader.
2010-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		....Welll, that seems ludicrously complex enough to try.
2010-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	ConduitConvectio		What are the risks?
2010-10-16T05:09:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	you can take the broad connector on your motherboard and remove it and stick something that leads electricity between 2 pins to make the psu start so your cd-drive gets juice thus letting you remove the cd without actually starting ... most of the computer ;)
2010-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	what do you want to do?
2010-10-16T05:16:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	i usually fix grub problems with supergrub - and then there was another software that worked well...
2010-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	guy, have you considered a usb-stick or something before actually going with a network boot?
2010-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	putting ubuntu on a usb-stick is easier than breathing - wanna go with that?
2010-10-16T05:21:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	im having trouble grasping your situation if we drift around too much - you got a screwed up installation on a machine with a broked cd-drive - correct?
2010-10-16T05:24:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	use a usb stick while you gather the motivation to spend 20â‚¬/$ on a new cd-drive :P
2010-10-16T05:26:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	you have a computer to use for preparing the stick?
2010-10-16T05:27:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ - get the disk image from ubuntu and then use this tool with the cd-image and choose the target stick in your machine and it does the rest for you
2010-10-16T05:28:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	also, you need to set bios to boot from usb
2010-10-16T05:28:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	when did you get the computer, what age is it approx?
2010-10-16T05:30:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	check the target machine bios - see what options it gives you for possible devices to boot from
2010-10-16T05:31:00.000Z	Viliny	ConduitConvectio	usb sticks are fun to own for various stuff :)
