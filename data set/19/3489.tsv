2009-08-04T01:58:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	it would seem that in fact, the file doesn't exist.
2009-08-04T01:59:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	does that file exist, that you're looking for?
2009-08-04T02:00:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	what document are you refering to, give me a link?
2009-08-04T02:01:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	thats no always good.
2009-08-04T02:03:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	so this works? ./ati-driver-installer-8.443.1-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/<version>
2009-08-04T02:13:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	and that is the exact name of the file
2009-08-04T02:13:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	^
2009-08-04T02:14:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	you're in / not ~/Desktop/
2009-08-04T02:22:00.000Z	daniellockard	Raenir	I would check dmesg for errors.
