2005-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	unperson	ogra	You missed the earlier conversation.  There's an apparent bug in the version in warty.  I wanted to see if it was still there in the latest version before complaining to the project.
2005-01-14T12:38:00.000Z	ogra	unperson	ah, ok..... then recompile, but it may need deps from hoary.....
