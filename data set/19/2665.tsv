2010-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	spekko		can someone tell me the command to update grub again please?
2010-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	spekko		sudo etc.
2010-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	update-grub
2010-02-05T23:23:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	assuming you are referring to grub2
2010-02-06T00:12:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	how recent are these installs
2010-02-06T00:13:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	i installed ubuntu yesterday or the day before. and windows before last month. and reinstalled windows today
2010-02-06T00:15:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	to get around the 100MB strange boot partition from win7, I got a gparted livecd and then formatted a portion as ntfs for win7, as well as one for ubuntu (ext4) then installed them , win7 first then Ubuntu; prior to that I was having the same issue as yourself
2010-02-06T00:16:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	i used gparted too to make my partitions but what next?
2010-02-06T00:17:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	one continuous one for win7, without the 100mb /boot partition?
2010-02-06T00:18:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	what do you mean?
2010-02-06T00:19:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	a single (whatever size) ntfs partition; also daftykins idea seems to be good
2010-02-06T00:20:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	yep
2010-02-06T00:22:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	I am just reporting on how I got the dual boot to work successfully
2010-02-06T00:23:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	ok can u explain exactly how you got it to work?
2010-02-06T00:23:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	boot with gparted live cd; make one ntfs partition and one ext4 partition ; install win7 on ntfs then ubuntu on ext4
2010-02-06T00:24:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	that it? :O so simple? :/
2010-02-06T00:24:00.000Z	bazhang	spekko	though disconnecting the 1TB drive seems wise beforehand
2010-02-06T00:25:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	daftykins, ok will do that. thanx alot guys. will be back with results. if you still here by the time im done ^_^
2010-02-06T03:08:00.000Z	spekko	bazhang	daftykins i got it to work ^_^ finally thanx alot
