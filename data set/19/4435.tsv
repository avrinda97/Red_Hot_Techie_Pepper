2009-01-14T20:59:00.000Z	nesoi		hello, I just upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 and my network no longer works
2009-01-14T20:59:00.000Z	nesoi		what should I do?
2009-01-14T21:00:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	we need more details to help
2009-01-14T21:01:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	thanks, it's an IBM T23 laptop and the wired ethernet controller is an intel 82801CAM (ICH3) pro/100 VE ethernet controller rev 42
2009-01-14T21:02:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	how can I tell?
2009-01-14T21:03:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	Try 'ifconfig' in a terminal
2009-01-14T21:03:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	it shows eth1 and eth1:avahi
2009-01-14T21:04:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	and lo
2009-01-14T21:06:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	Most intel network controllers should be supported, so I think it is eth0. *:avahi are only for the avahi daemon and don't really do anything that could break the network
2009-01-14T21:06:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	did you see that?
2009-01-14T21:09:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	no ideas?
2009-01-14T21:09:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	no, sorry. The network manager not finding your card confuses me
2009-01-14T21:10:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	the sigsomething error might be in dmesg, try 'dmesg | grep -i eth0'
2009-01-14T21:10:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	is there a way to get ubuntu to try to discover the hardware again?
2009-01-14T21:11:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	not a simple one I know. If you know the name of the driver modulse you can reload it though
2009-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	weird stuff. And I don't suppose there's a configuration icon for eth1?
2009-01-14T21:13:00.000Z	nesoi	Weejee	there is one, and it looks okay
2009-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	Can't you connect to the wired network with eth1 then?
2009-01-14T21:16:00.000Z	Weejee	nesoi	I don't really know how to help you ;(. I've got to go right now, maybe you'll have more luck with someone else
