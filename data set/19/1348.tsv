2011-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	jrgill		does the live cd use /etc/X11/xorg.conf?  doesnt seem like it.  i need to add some modelines.
2011-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	jrgill		im using 10.10
2011-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	you can create an xorg.conf and restart X
2011-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	oh, just modelines?
2011-02-19T12:00:00.000Z	maco		!resolution | jrgill
2011-02-19T12:00:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	the reason there's no xorg.conf is that things can be configured on the fly now :) check out the wiki page
2011-02-19T12:00:00.000Z	jrgill	maco	so theres no more xorg.conf?
2011-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	by default, no. it's been unnecessary for 3 years
2011-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	jrgill	maco	oh wow.  so much has changed since i used linux for home use i.e. a gui
2011-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	jrgill		i generated a config and placed it in X11.  i guess if it's not set to read the config, it wont.
2011-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	jrgill		oh well.  this is good news.  should be easier to play w/ the resolution on my tv.  :)
2011-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	jrgill	maco	what did they do to x to eliminate the need for xorg.conf?  is it something fundamental you can describe in a sentence?
2011-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	jrgill		oh
2011-02-19T12:06:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	it gained the ability to ask the monitor "so, what resolutions & refresh rates do you support?" and just automatically try the highest.  granted, some monitors *lie* about what they support...and that's when you do what the wiki page says and add modes
2011-02-19T12:07:00.000Z	jrgill	maco	are we talking support for edid?
2011-02-19T12:07:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	yep
2011-02-19T12:07:00.000Z	jrgill		is there a command to easily pull edid?  id like to see what this tv says.
2011-02-19T12:08:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	umm... if you type `xrandr` all by itself it'll tell you what X has available to it
2011-02-19T12:08:00.000Z	maco	jrgill	ive never looked for a more "raw" way though
