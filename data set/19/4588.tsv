2009-04-04T10:27:00.000Z	almark1		How do I install gnome-vfs-2.0 it not in synaptic?
2009-04-04T10:28:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	what wrappers do you need?
2009-04-04T10:31:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	I need these deps http://buzztard.org/index.php/Building
2009-04-04T10:32:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	try the libgnome-vfs-2.0-cil package
2009-04-04T10:33:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	thanks. I wish I knew what these pkgs where called so I wouldn't have to ask silly questions
2009-04-04T10:33:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	I just did apt-cache search gnome-vfs to see what might be related
2009-04-04T10:34:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	thats how I do that, with apt-cache, thanks :)
2009-04-04T10:36:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	libgnome-vfsmm-2.6* ?
2009-04-04T10:36:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	nope
2009-04-04T10:37:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	these are the pkgs i'm missing No package 'gnome-vfs-2.0' found
2009-04-04T10:38:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	yea, I think its been phased out for gvfs
2009-04-04T10:39:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	how can I remedy this?
2009-04-04T10:40:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	I don't think you can. Best bet is to ask the buzztard developers how to fix it
2009-04-04T10:40:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	is this an issue on other distros too.
2009-04-04T10:41:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	I would presume so, unless the distro's still use older version of gnome with gnome-vfs
2009-04-04T10:41:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	this program is really hard to compile, a real pain
2009-04-04T10:41:00.000Z	ziroday	almark1	unfortunately I don't know enough about gvfs and gnome-vfs to help you more
2009-04-04T10:42:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	I noticed that they buzztard has pre compiled pkgs for open-suse and RPM's as well, but that isn't a deb file.
2009-04-04T10:42:00.000Z	almark1	ziroday	though I'm not a developer just a compiler, I don't know what I need, I just know when i need it.
