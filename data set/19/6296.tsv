2008-02-19T18:33:00.000Z	__Oz__		And I still don't "get" what makes synaptic better than add/remove.
2008-02-19T18:33:00.000Z	__Oz__		What's the advantage of synaptic?  Best I can tell is simply access to more repos.
2008-02-19T18:34:00.000Z	__Oz__		libs?  libraries? What's an example of when you'd need to do this?
2008-02-19T18:35:00.000Z	__Oz__		Mm.
2008-02-19T18:35:00.000Z	__Oz__		Me being a n00b, I guess add/remove is the right thing to use.
2008-02-19T18:35:00.000Z	__Oz__		Yeah, I've seen dev packages in there.
2008-02-19T18:36:00.000Z	__Oz__		So Add/Remove was included in Ubuntu for idiots like me, while smart people across the Linuxverse appreciate the power of Synaptic.  Is that about right?
2008-02-19T18:37:00.000Z	__Oz__		Ahhh
2008-02-19T18:37:00.000Z	__Oz__		that helps shed some light.
2008-02-19T18:38:00.000Z	__Oz__		When you run an "updatedb" what exactly is happening?
2008-02-19T18:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	an index of your filesystem is created
2008-02-19T18:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	apt-cache search::: search for packages   apt-cache show:: show a specific package (sudo not necessary for either)
2008-02-19T18:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	apt-cache search dvd burn :)
2008-02-20T04:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	invokes sudo in GUI context
2008-02-20T04:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	sudo apt-get blahblah,   gksudo gedit, gksudo totem etc
2008-02-20T04:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	or kdesudo on kde
2008-02-20T05:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	when you do ctrl-alt-f1 for example, you go to a console (tty - teletype terminal) --- try it.. come back here with ctrl-alt-f7
2008-02-20T05:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	no prob, the tty is terminology from old times
2008-02-20T05:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	__Oz__	the are numbered tty1 tty2, etc. like when you do ctrl-alt-f2, or f3
