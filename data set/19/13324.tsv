2005-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	dcraven	trygvebw	Could you be more specific?
2005-06-03T08:46:00.000Z	trygvebw	dcraven	./configure tells me that i don't have 'gnome-python-2.0'

2005-06-03T08:52:00.000Z	trygvebw	dcraven	:)
2005-06-03T08:52:00.000Z	trygvebw	dcraven	just wondering: is there a web version of Newton? that can be used as a normal wiki on the internet?
2005-06-03T08:52:00.000Z	dcraven	trygvebw	Still lots to do though. I also need to clean it up a bit.
2005-06-03T08:53:00.000Z	dcraven	trygvebw	Eventually I'm thinking of adding an option to share. It'll start a little web server.
2005-06-03T08:53:00.000Z	trygvebw	dcraven	okay :)
2005-06-03T08:53:00.000Z	dcraven	trygvebw	That opens a can o' worms though.
