2011-01-01T20:51:00.000Z	shaggy2		hello I am installing geoip on my ubuntu 10.10 server, just got a little confused, the tutorial say's "Add the directory libGeoIP was installed in, i.e. /usr/local/lib (and that is correct) to /etc/ld.so.conf, and exclude ldconfig. my confusion comes from include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf" is currently in the ld.so.conf and nothing else. do I just write include /usr/local/lib or do I add to that
2011-01-01T20:51:00.000Z	shaggy2		/libGeoIP.so and leave include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf in it or remove include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf and input something else to exclude the file
2011-01-01T20:52:00.000Z	shaggy2		I do a package upgrade everytime I install from aptitude just to make sure everything is at the latest

2011-01-01T20:57:00.000Z	shaggy2		sorry but someone asked what the problem was so I just repeated the message
2011-01-01T20:58:00.000Z	milamber	shaggy2	there is an actual file named ld.so.conf and you have to add the directory that you installed libGeoIP in to that file. after you have done that you have to run ldconfig. (you will have to do both as sudo)

2011-01-01T21:03:00.000Z	milamber	shaggy2	it's better to keep it logged on the channel in case others have the same issue
2011-01-01T21:11:00.000Z	shaggy2	milamber	so instead of following what the tutorial told me I just do cp on the file and then continue with the tutorial?
2011-01-01T21:13:00.000Z	milamber	shaggy2	after copying the file, you have to run: sudo ldconfig
2011-01-01T21:14:00.000Z	milamber	shaggy2	but after that, yes you can continue following the tutorial. for more information on ld.so.conf google: dynamically linked libraries on linux
2011-01-01T21:14:00.000Z	shaggy2	milamber	ok so one issue now. the ld.so.conf file points to that directory/*.conf the file I am to copy to that directory is only a .so file not a conf file
2011-01-01T21:15:00.000Z	shaggy2	milamber	will that matter?
2011-01-01T21:15:00.000Z	milamber	shaggy2	it shouldn't
