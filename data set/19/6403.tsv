2008-01-26T01:09:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	More times than you can imagine.
2008-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	My only option is to reboot when I'm given the error actually.
2008-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Crasy	i have never seen that i am sure others will help
2008-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	Alright, appreciate it.
2008-01-26T01:11:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Crasy	it might be of disk errors if you downloaded it from the inernet
2008-01-26T01:12:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	Checksum the file?
2008-01-26T01:12:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	I should do that?
2008-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Crasy	no what im saying is that people sometime experience that
2008-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Crasy	burning from a cd image
2008-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	So, should I redownload it?
2008-01-26T01:14:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	Or try a different mirror or something? I have reburned it before I came here and it still didn't work.
2008-01-26T01:14:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Crasy	so you did download it,have you ever tried to request it, that would bee better
2008-01-26T01:15:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Crasy	yes try a different mirror, or burn at lower speeds
2008-01-26T01:15:00.000Z	Crasy	_moro_bana_	Alright, sure.
