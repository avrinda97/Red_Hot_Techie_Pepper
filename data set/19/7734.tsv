2007-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	Dag_		I'm going to buy a Canon EOS 400D and I wonder how will that go as I have Ubuntu, like connecting the camera to my PC, will it find it? And is Ubuntu great for photographers? I'm used to Windows and Mac, but I hate them both.
2007-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	Dag_		What does !hardware | Dag_ mean?
2007-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	rolfen	Dag_	well you wont be easily able to run photoshop on ubuntu. there's a way but it involves wine and a couple of hacks, and is not easy
2007-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	Dag_		I don't want Adobe Photoshop :)
2007-07-21T07:50:00.000Z	rolfen		ok good then :)
