2011-06-15T13:04:00.000Z	Jon--		I have to choose between configuring my own DE [openbox, fluxbox], not having Compiz [GNOME 3], having a DE I hate [Unity], and having something crazy flashy and unlike the rest [KDE]? Man. That sucks. =(

2011-06-15T13:04:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	you can always have Enlightenment too
2011-06-15T22:29:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	Just delete that file, it's safe enough I suppose
2011-12-14T13:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	rsync has a --remove-synced-files (or something) flag so you can make it act like mv
2011-12-14T13:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	What's the goal anyway? I might do it
2011-12-14T13:45:00.000Z	Jon--	theadmin	He wants to find all sub dirs containing *.flac and move those directories recursively into some other directory
2011-12-14T13:45:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	Hm, interesting...
2011-12-14T13:50:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	If it can read stdin in some way, sure...
2011-12-14T13:51:00.000Z	Jon--	theadmin	Example? I have a list of directories with flac files, want to pass to rsync via a pipe
2011-12-14T13:52:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	Meh, no rsync fan myself and I can't find anything related in the manpage
2012-07-31T19:08:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	I'd believe it's "linux-headers-generic" but that should come preinstalled.
2012-07-31T19:10:00.000Z	Jon--	theadmin	it wasn't
2012-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	Oh. Well, there you go :P
2012-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	Jon--	theadmin	Nope, still don
2012-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	Oh :(
2012-07-31T19:12:00.000Z	theadmin	Jon--	Well, then I dunno, sorry
2012-07-31T19:12:00.000Z	Jon--	theadmin	still don't have /lib/modules/*kernel*/build.  only initrd, kernel
