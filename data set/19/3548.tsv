2009-07-23T13:46:00.000Z	Spikemcc		yep but I think to use a repository or something more suited to softwares I need no more no less got an idea ?
2009-07-23T13:48:00.000Z	Spikemcc		!minimal cd
2009-07-23T13:49:00.000Z	Spikemcc		!minimal
2009-07-23T13:50:00.000Z	Spikemcc		does the alternate can be installed like the minimal cd or it put some junk on install ?
2009-07-23T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	the alternate install uses a text istall rather than a fancy gui install of the desktop. The minimal CD installs the OS from the repos
2009-07-23T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	yes, you can choose exactly what you want
2009-07-23T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	i use it to install a base ubuntu CLI system then install LXDE then the apps I need
2009-07-23T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	all apps are compiled for 32 and 64 bits, flash and java used to be a pain but now they are as easy as 32bit
2009-07-23T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	32bit will work on any system though
2009-07-23T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	if you try the 64bit beta flash plugin you may get some joy, you will need to uninstall the flash you have now though

2009-07-23T14:01:00.000Z	Spikemcc	ActionParsnip	I was supposing that he tried the documentation on nvidia ...
2009-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	runs amazingly here
2009-07-23T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	no, it must be installed manually
2009-07-23T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	the restricted extras package is a metapackage for lots of goodies folks usually want. i prefer to install my own stuff but it installnice things like fonts and other restricted stuff
2009-07-23T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	i find 64bit very mature
2009-07-23T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	all apps in the repos are 64bit and 32bit, you can even run 32bit apps if you install ia32-libs
2009-07-23T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spikemcc	disable addons in firefox safemode til you get a success
