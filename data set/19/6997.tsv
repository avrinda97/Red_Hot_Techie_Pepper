2008-01-12T19:02:00.000Z	mettao87		i've installed ubuntustudio in text mode, because i've done an error. now, how can i use it in desktop mode?
2008-01-12T19:03:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	with text mode, do you mean the alternate cd?
2008-01-12T19:04:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	it's just the instller that is in text mode, when you have installed and rebooted it should be graphical
2008-01-12T19:05:00.000Z	mettao87	cleaton	unfortunately, it shouldn't
2008-01-12T19:05:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	atleast that's the case for ubuntu, i haven't tried the ubuntu studio cd, but i'm gussing it should be the same
2008-01-12T19:05:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	you get to an terminal/console?
2008-01-12T19:06:00.000Z	mettao87	cleaton	what?
2008-01-12T19:06:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	what happens when you boot? where does it get stuck if you can't get to graphical
2008-01-12T19:07:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	ok, try typing startx
2008-01-12T19:10:00.000Z	mettao87	cleaton	xinit package isn't installed. now i install it and probably it will be right.
2008-01-12T19:10:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	ok, hm sounds like your installation was incomplete
2008-01-12T19:10:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	you got no errors?
2008-01-12T19:10:00.000Z	mettao87	cleaton	no
2008-01-12T19:10:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	while installing
2008-01-12T19:11:00.000Z	mettao87	cleaton	is for that i ask why it stops in text mode.
2008-01-12T19:12:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	did it work after isntalling the missing package?
2008-01-12T19:13:00.000Z	cleaton	mettao87	what graphics card do you have?
2008-01-12T19:15:00.000Z	mettao87	cleaton	no, it doesn't work after installing. i'll try to install all the system again. probably i've done errors during the installation.
