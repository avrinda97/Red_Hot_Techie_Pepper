2006-08-19T07:08:00.000Z	Anderson		Can someone explain to me the function of RJ45 crimping dies. I have only used the simple universal radio shack tye crimpers.
2006-08-19T07:09:00.000Z	Anderson		Can someone explain the function of different RJ45 crimping dies? I have only used the simple universal radio shack tye crimpers.
2006-08-19T07:10:00.000Z	verbose	Anderson	rj-45s have to comply with a standard...what crimps one should crimp another
2006-08-19T07:10:00.000Z	verbose		there are different connectors based on different wire types
2006-08-19T07:10:00.000Z	verbose		also, different dies fit in different crimpers
2006-08-19T07:10:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	I thought so too, but I have been looking at different crimpers that have modular dies.
2006-08-19T07:10:00.000Z	verbose		but the pin spacing and whatnot is universal
2006-08-19T07:11:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	http://www.controlcable.com/details/item.asp?id=43332380|70441|
2006-08-19T07:13:00.000Z	verbose	Anderson	i'm pretty sure what works on one will work on another
2006-08-19T07:13:00.000Z	verbose	Anderson	i believe mine is a 2045(older paladin) and it's worked on all rj-45's i've ever crimped
2006-08-19T07:13:00.000Z	verbose		if the rj-45 fits in a NIC or switch, it will fit the crimpers
2006-08-19T07:15:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	ok, also is there different tips or tipping methods for STP?
2006-08-19T07:16:00.000Z	verbose	Anderson	i'm not sure about that
2006-08-19T07:17:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	alright, I'm going to be responsible for a big network, and I was wondering if I could run some ideas by anyone who has experience.
2006-08-19T07:18:00.000Z	verbose	Anderson	typically, the guy in charge of the big network doesn't crimp cables...he has better things to do
2006-08-19T07:18:00.000Z	verbose	Anderson	hire a cable puller
2006-08-19T07:18:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	it's not always that easy.
2006-08-19T07:21:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	Some of my ideas are, diagram everthing and maintain different levels of diagrams (physical, network, geographic). Also I am going to use twist on tags at both ends of the cable to keep track of what goes where, I will probably put the same information on both ends, switch/port user/location. Keep copies of all of my configurations. Maintain organized software repositories. Get sufficient equipment for all techs.
2006-08-19T07:22:00.000Z	Anderson	verbose	I will keep some sort of spread sheet or databases to keep track of everything, and maybe program some new software.
