2006-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	mrabbit		please help, the torrents are so slow
2006-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	make sure your ports are properly configured.
2006-12-14T14:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	I don't know, never faced that problem on my laptop (or desktop)
2006-12-14T14:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	ubuntu doesn't open ports by itself.
2006-12-14T14:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	are you using a firewall?
2006-12-14T14:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	ports aren't gates that you open and shut. You have to have something (a program) listening on a port for it to open.
2006-12-14T14:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	no, you didn't.
2006-12-14T14:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	could be a bad torrent, have you ever thought of that possibility?
2006-12-14T14:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	where did you open it?
2006-12-14T14:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	*how* did you open it?
2006-12-14T14:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	is azureus giving you the green smiley face?
2006-12-14T14:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	then its not a problem with the ports, or ubuntu. You are just on a slow seeder.
2006-12-14T14:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	if the icon is green in azureus, that means that the problem is not with the network or the operating system. There is nothing in the ubuntu installation that will prevent you from downloading torrents.
2006-12-14T14:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	that's not a ubuntu problem then :)
2006-12-14T14:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	plenty of natting help at the azureus website and at portforward.com
2006-12-14T14:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	please, stop saying 'its fine on other distros'.
2006-12-14T14:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	then switch back :)
2006-12-14T14:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	I can assure you, the problem is not with ubuntu -- as there is no problem on my laptop downloading torrents using azureus.
2006-12-14T14:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mrabbit	if there was, it would be all over launchpad and probably in the /topic of this channel, as there are a lot of torrent users.
