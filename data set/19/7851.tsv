2008-03-15T09:00:00.000Z	kee		Hello all
2008-03-15T09:01:00.000Z	kee		is this were newbies come for support?
2008-03-15T09:01:00.000Z	kee		I'm cant get to the internet on my ubuntu.  Can anyone help me?
2008-03-15T09:02:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	we need more info... do you have an ip?
2008-03-15T09:04:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	so you're running it under vmware?
2008-03-15T09:06:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	ok... wifi or hardline?
2008-03-15T09:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	strange... are you using a router?
2008-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	so wait, the virtual machine has internet, but the host doesn't?!?
2008-03-15T09:10:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	well that doesn't make sense.  what type of networking are you using on the vm.  yea, resolv.conf is probably what he's talking about.  /etc/network/interfaces would be a better place to look.
2008-03-15T09:15:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	it's probably the bridged networking.  i can't remember the other settings, but try some other settings.
2008-03-15T09:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	hrm.  it was worth a shot.  what if you shut off the virtual machine and restart networking?  also pastebin your interfaces file.
2008-03-15T09:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	and you get a dhcp lease each time no problem?
2008-03-15T09:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	that's a weird netmask.  is that the vm's ip or the host's?
2008-03-15T09:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	that ip you listed, the 172 address.   is that the ip of the vm or the host?
2008-03-15T09:44:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	what about the host
2008-03-15T09:44:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	and that's an IP your router is *supposed* to assign??
2008-03-15T09:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	ok... can you try skippin the router just for shits n giggles?
2008-03-15T09:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	although if your vm has internet that probably won't fix it.  pastebin your interfaces file if you could
2008-03-15T09:50:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kee	pastebin your interfaces file.
