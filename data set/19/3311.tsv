2010-02-11T20:14:00.000Z	zebastian		so from now on i should do  sudo cp -pr /home /media/disk/destination
2010-02-11T20:14:00.000Z	zebastian		to back up
2010-02-11T20:14:00.000Z	blakkheim	zebastian	you might want to look into rsync so you only copy the CHANGES instead of the whole directory every time
2010-02-11T20:15:00.000Z	zebastian	blakkheim	why wouldnt i want to copy the whole directory everytime blackhome-?
2010-02-11T20:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	zebastian	it takes more time, you might only want to copy the changes since the last full copy. it's up to you, was just an idea
2010-02-11T20:16:00.000Z	blakkheim	zebastian	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2010-03-10T07:55:00.000Z	blakkheim	zebastian	would the zoom plugin of compiz work?
2010-03-10T07:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	zebastian	install compizconfig-settings-manager and run ccsm
2010-03-10T08:05:00.000Z	zebastian	blakkheim	ok i have compiz effects checked now, which was the effect you told me to use
2010-03-10T08:11:00.000Z	zebastian	blakkheim	got kicked out
2010-03-10T08:11:00.000Z	zebastian	blakkheim	what was it the plugin you mentioned that will help me enable a ZUI like environment
