2010-06-26T14:53:00.000Z	ring0		hi, could anybody explain to me, if an usb-stick is recognized by anything else than the uuid it has?
2010-06-26T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	what do you mean ?
2010-06-26T14:54:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	if i had two equal sticks with the same uuid, would the system think they are the same?
2010-06-26T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	they wouldn't have the same uuid
2010-06-26T14:54:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	i could give them the same
2010-06-26T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	you don't assign uuid's
2010-06-26T14:54:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	with tune2fs
2010-06-26T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	you don't give it a uuid with tune2fs
2010-06-26T14:56:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	i've already tried assigning uuids with tune2fs -U sth. and it works
2010-06-26T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	you're not meant to do that, however on your head be it
2010-06-26T14:58:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	my question is simply if the system uses anything else but the uuid to identify an usb-stick
2010-06-26T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	it depends what you're doing
2010-06-26T15:00:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	atm i'm booting from an usb-stick and i wanted to create a backup-stick, in case the first one breaks. therefore i need an identical stick, which i could use to boot too, since i figure it's mounted via /etc/fstab and uuid
2010-06-26T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	fstab can be changed to use either uuid's or device id's or even disk labels
2010-06-26T15:01:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	so, it's probably easier to assign the sam disk label and use them in /etc/fstab. true?
2010-06-26T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	yup
2010-06-26T15:02:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	thanks, i'll have a try
2010-06-26T15:23:00.000Z	ring0	ikonia	if i use the label as identifier, do i put LABEL=new_label or LABEL="new_label" like blkid shows in its output?
2010-06-26T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	ring0	prety much yes
