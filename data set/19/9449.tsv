2010-09-14T07:48:00.000Z	dbernar1		I am trying to add a partition using fdisk of type vfat...there is no type vfat in my list of known types. Is fat32 the same? (or rather vfat the driver for fat16 and fat32 drives)
2010-09-14T07:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	Do you understand that fdisk does not actually create a filesystem?
2010-09-14T08:03:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	well I sorta do, why?
2010-09-14T08:04:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	I am told by fdisk that my partition names are /dev/sdb1p1 and /dev/sdb1p1, but thos don't exist in /dev
2010-09-14T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	You might want to stick with gparted. If not, you'll need to use "sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdXY" (and be *very* carefull that you choose the right device).
2010-09-14T08:04:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	so mkfs complains if I tell it that
2010-09-14T08:05:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	I am being careful, yeah :)
2010-09-14T08:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	You've added a partition table to a partition, you probably didn't intend to do that.
2010-09-14T08:07:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	I am partitioning a USB key. Can gparted do that for me?
2010-09-14T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	Yes, and you've used fdisk incorrectly.
2010-09-14T08:08:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	looks like.
2010-09-14T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	You probably ran "sudo fdisk /dev/sdb1" rather than "sudo fdisk /dev/sdb". But whatever the reason, it's probably best to just stick with gparted.
2010-09-14T08:09:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	! thanks
2010-09-14T08:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	You're welcome.
2010-09-14T08:10:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	and the thing is supposed to be unmounted, right?
2010-09-14T08:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dbernar1	Correct.
2010-09-14T08:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	good it worked this time
2010-09-14T08:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	can gparted set the bootable flag on my usb key?
2010-09-14T08:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	Jordan_U	got it, never minf
