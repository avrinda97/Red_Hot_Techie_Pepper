2007-08-18T07:59:00.000Z	epistis		i don't mean to interrupt, but why is it that I can login to gdm with my login/pass, but a TTY says my login is invalid?
2007-08-18T08:01:00.000Z	epistis		i'll ask again, it's pretty busy tonight... why can i login to gdm but a text login says my user/pass is invalid
2007-08-18T08:02:00.000Z	epistis		i'll ask again, it's pretty busy tonight... why can i login to gdm but a text login says my user/pass is invalid
2007-08-18T08:02:00.000Z	epistis		(sorry, i would just like to get this solved) :\
2007-08-18T08:03:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	good question. No idea, sorry.. Tried googling, I assume?
2007-08-18T08:03:00.000Z	epistis		nah, caps are correct
2007-08-18T08:03:00.000Z	epistis	taxman	i tried, not finding much yet..thought i'd ask here before hours of research  :x
2007-08-18T08:04:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	do you have odd character sets or encoding enabled?
2007-08-18T08:04:00.000Z	epistis		i don't think so. just en-US standard
2007-08-18T08:04:00.000Z	epistis	taxman	i don't think so. just en-US standard (repeat to add your nick)
2007-08-18T08:05:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	what happens when you ctrl-alt-f4 or whatever after logging in to gmd
2007-08-18T08:06:00.000Z	epistis	taxman	/after/ logging in? just takes me to TTY4 login
2007-08-18T08:06:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	right, does that login work then? or is that the problem?
2007-08-18T08:07:00.000Z	epistis	taxman	that's the problem  :(   (well, i can't login after logging into gdm or even without gdm.. no text login at all)
2007-08-18T08:07:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	ok, just making sure it was consistent
2007-08-18T08:07:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	I know there are options to disable logins with anything but GDM. that may have happened accidentally
2007-08-18T08:08:00.000Z	epistis	taxman	hmm...god only knows where i could find such settings  :\
2007-08-18T08:09:00.000Z	epistis		i love ubuntu to death and will stay with it to the grave, but *@$*, it's a mess.
2007-08-18T08:09:00.000Z	taxman	epistis	it's only slightly less a mess than the rest :)
