2011-09-06T15:46:00.000Z	Eliasmaster		Hi, I asked this question already today, but I left for school and forgot what to do ;_;. So when I try to boot to Ubuntu (I have installed via Wubi) from the windows boot menu, normally GRUB  boot menu comes to ask which kernel version (or something like that) I want to use, but today it boots to this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/683453/
2011-09-06T15:47:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	type "root (hd0,<TAB>
2011-09-06T15:47:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	sorry no "
2011-09-06T15:49:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	does that bring up anything?
2011-09-06T15:50:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	<TAB> means press tab
2011-09-06T15:50:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	but that wont boot anything yet
2011-09-06T15:51:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	that will bring up a list of partitions you can boot from
2011-09-06T15:52:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	do you have another pc with internet you can log into irc and do this at the same time?
2011-09-06T15:53:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	well youre gonna be stuck at the bootloader for a while i think
2011-09-06T15:53:00.000Z	Eliasmaster	damo22	would it be possible just copy all my files somehow and reinstall ubuntu?
2011-09-06T15:54:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	you can always boot a livecd and mount the hard drive to back up, you should already have a backup before you play with the pc
2011-09-06T15:56:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	do you have an external drive with your files on it?
2011-09-06T15:57:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	do you have any important files in linux?
2011-09-06T15:58:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	do you have a ubuntu livecd?
2011-09-06T15:58:00.000Z	Eliasmaster	damo22	no
2011-09-06T16:00:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	i have 2 external usb hard drives as separate backups
2011-09-06T16:03:00.000Z	Eliasmaster	damo22	I will start reinstalling Ubuntu now, as I don't have any important files there, it seems the easiest way
2011-09-06T16:04:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	thats the easy way, but there might be a way to recover
2011-09-06T16:06:00.000Z	damo22	Eliasmaster	but support from damo22 has finished for the day
