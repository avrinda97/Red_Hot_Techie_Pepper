2005-06-05T12:10:00.000Z	shanon	tweek888	so it doesn't boot ?

2005-06-05T12:10:00.000Z	tweek888		and errors with a red screen
2005-06-05T12:10:00.000Z	shanon	tweek888	does it crash at the same point everytime ?
2005-06-05T12:10:00.000Z	tweek888		yea
2005-06-05T12:11:00.000Z	shanon	tweek888	It is probably not the CD. Find out exaclty what it is doing when it crashes. Is it loading a driver or something
2005-06-05T12:12:00.000Z	tweek888		:\
2005-06-05T12:12:00.000Z	tweek888		im much to tired, it takes my burner 18 minutes to burn and ive done this three times already :\
2005-06-05T12:13:00.000Z	shanon	tweek888	Don't reburn the cd it isn't helping. When you install if it always crashes at the same point it is probably an action of the installer that is incompatable with the setup of your computer
2005-06-05T12:14:00.000Z	tweek888	shanon	i have had ubuntu on that computer before
2005-06-05T12:15:00.000Z	shanon	tweek888	If it is always crashing at exactly the same point it will probably be what I mentioned.
