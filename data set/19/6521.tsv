2008-11-04T05:24:00.000Z	secion8		Anyone else having trouble with pairing bluetooth devices with a 0000 pin?
2008-11-04T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	use a different pin
2008-11-04T05:25:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	That's the thing... I cannot enter a key in ubuntu 8.10. There is no way to do it.
2008-11-04T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	i just sent my pc a file and i was asked for pairing. never set a thing myself
2008-11-04T05:25:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	There is a bug filed for this on launchpad.. but not gettin much attention and is a serious problem for me..
2008-11-04T05:26:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	What version are you using?
2008-11-04T05:26:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	This only happens with certain devices that want a 0000 pin.

2008-11-04T05:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	0000 pin is pointless

2008-11-04T05:28:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	i have no file called pin at /etc/bluetooth/
2008-11-04T05:31:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	I also have no file called /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf
2008-11-04T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	id try making one
2008-11-04T05:31:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	How?
2008-11-04T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	read that guide and i think it tells you how to populate the file
2008-11-04T05:32:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	 Why is bluetooth such a pian to setup in ubuntu? I just switched from windows and did not have to do any of this.
2008-11-04T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	different system, different problems
2008-11-04T05:33:00.000Z	secion8	ActionParsnip	So i just make a file called hcid.conf and put : Passkey"0000"; in it
2008-11-04T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	secion8	try firing up bluez or whatever gnome uses
