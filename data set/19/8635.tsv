2007-03-07T17:26:00.000Z	eyecue		Can I get a confirmation that in order to reset a root password, I need to boot into single user mode and run a `passwd root ? Any specific URL's outlining the procedure?
2007-03-07T17:26:00.000Z	eyecue		I have su yes.
2007-03-07T17:27:00.000Z	eyecue		well, user in is group whatever
2007-03-07T17:27:00.000Z	eyecue		woland_; i do indeed
2007-03-07T17:27:00.000Z	eyecue		or do you mean NOPASS ?
2007-03-07T17:29:00.000Z	eyecue		woland_; look what i get for securing sudoers ;)
2007-03-07T17:29:00.000Z	eyecue		woland_; next best thing after sudo?
2007-03-07T17:30:00.000Z	eyecue		i just removed the group wheel (or whatever the root group is in ubuntu) NOPASS line
2007-03-07T17:30:00.000Z	eyecue		ive got each user locked down to single command allias, on localhost
2007-03-07T17:30:00.000Z	kbd	eyecue	Why did you do that?
2007-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	eyecue		Because its a server? and i prefer good perms :)
2007-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	eyecue		Anyway, why it was done is irrelevant, someone lost the root, and i dont have a record, but i dont have console
2007-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	eyecue	woland_	do you have the specifics for mounting the required fs's, this is my first day on ubuntu.
2007-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	eyecue		can i mount -a ?
2007-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	eyecue		for all fs's in fstab
2007-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	kbd	eyecue	interesting concept... I know there was all kind of hell when a FreeBSD install of mine orphaned wheel from the get-go...
2007-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	eyecue		roger, woland_, no ill reboot her into su
2007-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	eyecue		kbd; never seen that happen, mind you, i do barebones installs and config post-install ;)
2007-03-07T17:33:00.000Z	kbd	eyecue	never saw it before and never seen it since. it was the closest thing to paranormal activity I have ever experienced :P
