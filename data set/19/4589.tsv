2010-02-09T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	almark1	have you mixed repositories or installed any debs manually?
2010-02-09T06:48:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	yes I have installed something manually with deb
2010-02-09T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	almark1	what did you install?
2010-02-09T06:49:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	let me look I hope its in my history from term
2010-02-09T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	almark1	pastebin the following too: apt-cache policy libc6-dev linux-libc-dev
2010-02-09T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	almark1	did you figure out what you installed, because linux-libc-dev is not from the repositories (and it's the problem)
2010-02-09T06:53:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	now I remember
2010-02-09T06:53:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	envy
2010-02-09T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	almark1	well I doubt it was envy but linux-libc-dev is the problem.  The only issue is, there may be more
2010-02-09T06:54:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	I need it so I can get my dual monitors to go to default and really just configure it properly
2010-02-09T06:57:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	one is avast
2010-02-09T06:57:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	one is dssi
2010-02-09T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	almark1	^
2010-02-09T07:02:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	I'm about to remove the package but if I do will remove g++ and g++ 4.2
2010-02-09T07:03:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	I really don't know if I should remove that package especially if its g++
2010-02-09T07:10:00.000Z	almark1	jrib	this is odd, I removed the problem package and it completely removed all of them for g++ but, I tried to do a  sudo apt-get install build-essential and I got this, hold for paste
