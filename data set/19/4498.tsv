2009-01-03T15:12:00.000Z	abhiroop		i have a quick question
2009-01-03T15:13:00.000Z	abhiroop		hey gues need some help
2009-01-03T15:13:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	go ahead and ask your question; you don't need to get permission first :)
2009-01-03T15:15:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	Yup. ext3 partitions, by default, have their base directory owned by root and not writable by normal users. How do you want it to be set up? Do you want anyone to be able to read and write to it, or just your user?
2009-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	Right, because NTFS doesn't have permissions set up. If you don't care that any users of the computer will be able to write to the drive, you can just do "sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/mountpoint"
2009-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	by the way, Ext2IFS requires that you use a certain inode size, and Ubuntu uses a different inode size by default. I'd look into that first.
2009-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	abhiroop	rww	thanks
2009-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	Okay. Make sure you check on that inode thing, if you haven't already. Caused me a lot of headaches >.>
2009-01-03T15:21:00.000Z	abhiroop	rww	what do you mean by inode?
2009-01-03T15:21:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	ah. I mentioned it, but it probably got lost in the channel noise. EXT2IFS only supports ext partitions with an inode size of less than or equal to 128 bytes. Ubuntu, if I remember correctly, uses larger inode sizes by default, so ext2/3 drives made in Ubuntu won't work with EXT2IFS without some workaround... I'll go find it for you.
2009-01-03T15:23:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	Are you using Ubuntu Hardy or Ubuntu Intrepid?
2009-01-03T15:23:00.000Z	abhiroop	rww	thanks for the help. I restarted my XP and now I can access my HD without any trouble!
2009-01-03T15:24:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	huh. So everything is working fine on both Windows XP and Ubuntu?
2009-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	heh, ignore all my inode discussion, then. I guess that bug got fixed and it didn't get mentioned on EXT2IFS's homepage...
2009-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	abhiroop	rww	by the way I am not too familiar with ext2ifs. I have a lot of data (about 500gb) on another drive that I want to copy over to my newly formatted Ext3 drive.
2009-01-03T15:27:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	To be honest, I'm not sure. I had problems with that inode stuff and ended up file transferring from an Ubuntu live CD, so I can't be much help with the Windows side of things :(
2009-01-03T15:28:00.000Z	abhiroop	rww	hmmm ok fair enough...I'll do it over XP then. What about the journaling issue in Ext2ifs? Basically that Ext2IFS does not support journalling and so will this cause any problems?
2009-01-03T15:29:00.000Z	rww	abhiroop	That's addressed in the Ext2 IFS FAQ: http://www.fs-driver.org/faq.html#acc_ext3
