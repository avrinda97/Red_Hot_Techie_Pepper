2005-09-20T13:04:00.000Z	hussam		Is nvidia 3d acceleration working in breezy?
2005-09-20T05:39:00.000Z	hussam		I upgraded my kubuntu to breezy today. It's working brilliantly. but I get this error at boot:
2005-09-20T05:39:00.000Z	hussam		8139cp: pci dev 0000:02:02.0 (id 10ec:8139 rev 10) is not an 8139C+ compatible chip
2005-09-20T05:39:00.000Z	hussam		8139cp: Try the "8139too" driver instead.
2005-09-20T05:40:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	realtek NIC?
2005-09-20T05:40:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	yes
2005-09-20T05:40:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	i think i saw something about that on the ubuntuforums
2005-09-20T05:41:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	can I have a link to it?
2005-09-20T05:41:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	www.ubuntuforums.org , use the search function with realtek 8139 , it should find you enough threads or look at the customization tips and tricks ... it has good howtos
2005-09-20T05:42:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	this error wasn't in hoary
2005-09-20T05:42:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	erm, you using breezy?
2005-09-20T05:43:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	just upgraded an hour ago
2005-09-20T05:43:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	not sure then. perhaps some driver getting fubared on the upgrade process... still, should be the same alltogether as the driver is hardly new
2005-09-20T05:45:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	the error says I should use "8139too" driver instead, how do I do that?
2005-09-20T05:47:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	i'm not really sure, perhaps should ask bob or seveas
2005-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	not sure mate, but my common sense says that you need to comment out the other driver
2005-09-20T05:57:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	the other on isn't listed in /etc/modules
2005-09-20T05:57:00.000Z	hussam	Determinist	I mean te old one
2005-09-20T05:57:00.000Z	Determinist	hussam	see what harrytuttle said afew lines ago
