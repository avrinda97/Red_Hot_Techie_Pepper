2008-04-02T22:06:00.000Z	epsol		anyone have any tips for a first time install?
2008-04-02T22:07:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	tip #1: don't settle on the first install being the final one. Give yourself time to install it a few times until you've got a good feeling about it.
2008-04-02T22:09:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	okay, the only concerns I really have are I have dual monitors and 2 PCI SATA/IDE controllers....
2008-04-02T22:09:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	two controllers will work seamlessly. Dual monitors can be tricky
2008-04-02T22:10:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	what's your graphics card?
2008-04-02T22:10:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	2400HD.... it sucks under Windows....
2008-04-02T22:10:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	what make?
2008-04-02T22:11:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	its a visiontek
2008-04-02T22:11:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	I mean the chipset -- ATI? NVidia? S3?
2008-04-02T22:12:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	ATI 2400HD, I think the trickiest part is going to be the 1400x1050 resolution
2008-04-02T22:13:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	I don't think so -- 1400x1050 on a single screen won't be difficult. For dualhead, you will have to look into fglrx (ATI closed source driver), Xinerama and the configuration generator, aticonfig
2008-04-02T22:14:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	yah if I remember correctly I should be about just to do the normal atisetup --initial-dual-head with the additional options
2008-04-02T22:14:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	just waiting for the CD to burn... lol
2008-04-02T22:14:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	you're not exactly a first-timer, are you? ;)
2008-04-02T22:15:00.000Z	epsol	soundray	I've done my research already... lol
2008-04-02T22:15:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	I'm pretty sure it's aticonfig, though
2008-04-02T22:16:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	logging off now. Good luck
2008-05-22T18:30:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	are you looking for it in the right place? Where?
2008-05-22T18:31:00.000Z	soundray	epsol	look in /etc/X11 instead
