2008-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	frold		and you did the "Adding they tray icon" DB42
2008-02-24T02:56:00.000Z	frold		just before you left DB42
2008-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	frold		can anyone mention a better sound controller then the default ubuntu one?
2008-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	what do you mean with sound controller? :)
2008-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	I think my sound sounds weird on Unbuntu compared to when I used XP
2008-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	define "wired". Cracking sound, too low, too high, etc.
2008-02-24T03:01:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	to low to little base - no like stereo
2008-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	then I suggest you to check mixer settings then
2008-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	sounds like PCM too low
2008-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	it might be but why having PCM and master - I just want to be able to mute, or turn the sound up and down...
2008-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	PCM is wave sound, Master is all sound, including incoming sounds from CD, Phone, etc.
2008-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	and Im not even sure Im using the right wound driver... It says Intels ICH6
2008-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	sound driver....
2008-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	it uses right driver, if you have sound. At least if it is standard intel, everything should be ok
2008-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	just check Mixer settings via clicking alt.button on speaker icon in right top corner, choosing Open Volume Control and vola
2008-02-24T03:09:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	In sound settings - I also have under "standart mixer" Sigmatel STAC9750,51 (OSS) and then I have Intel ICH6 (Alsa mixer) which one should I use?
2008-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	pecisk	frold	ALSA mixer, because OSS version is just alsa_oss compatibility layer
2008-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	thank you
2008-02-24T03:15:00.000Z	frold	pecisk	do you know howto set that when I scrool up and down in music it the PCM I control and no the Master?
