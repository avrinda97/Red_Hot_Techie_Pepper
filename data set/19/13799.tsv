2011-11-02T01:13:00.000Z	wayne		I have a question, I installed xubuntu on a pc thats from 2003 was this the best idea.
2011-11-02T01:13:00.000Z	wayne		Linux mint doesn't run correctly on this machine, I thought xubuntu was the best
2011-11-02T01:13:00.000Z	wayne		I tried puppy dog linux but didn't like it...
2011-11-02T01:14:00.000Z	wayne		I have the debian iso but.. It doesn't seem setup for wifi so I took it off and went to xubuntu 10.4 or something I hope this is correct
2011-11-02T01:15:00.000Z	wayne		Hold on one sec.
2011-11-02T01:16:00.000Z	wayne		Is there a command I can to tell me the details?
2011-11-02T01:16:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	grep MHz /proc/cpuinfo
2011-11-02T01:17:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	free -m, under total
2011-11-02T01:19:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	pretty good so far
2011-11-02T01:19:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	lspci | grep -i vga
2011-11-02T01:21:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	pretty decent, though, you could probably take your pick, but if you like Xubuntu there's no particularly reason to stop using it
2011-11-02T01:22:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	that's odd, but in the past
2011-11-02T01:31:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	which one?
2011-11-02T01:31:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	...wifi card
2011-11-02T02:20:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	sound isn't working?
2011-11-02T02:11:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	yes
2011-11-02T02:17:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	why?
2011-11-02T02:23:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	any
2011-11-05T21:35:00.000Z	reisio	wayne	yup
