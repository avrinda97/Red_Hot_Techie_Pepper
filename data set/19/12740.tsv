2005-10-02T11:35:00.000Z	whyameye		I can't install the firefox dev files. I get   Depends: mozilla-firefox (=1.0.2-0ubuntu5) but 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1 is to be installed
2005-10-02T11:36:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	have you installed firefox from backports?
2005-10-02T11:36:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	this is the version of Firefox that installed with the install CD. It looks from the Depends error like the dev code is older than the binary?
2005-10-02T11:36:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	i think from that error, you should upgrade to mozilla-firefox 1.0.7 first
2005-10-02T11:37:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	I *am* running 1.0.7. And the depends error confirms this. But the dev code that Synaptic is finding is apparently older, and this appears to be the problem.
2005-10-02T11:38:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	have you try apt-get update?
2005-10-02T11:39:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	geez. I should have tried that. Now it works! Thanks.

2005-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	So I am doing this to install the latest version of mplayer plug-in, as opposed to the 2.70 version on the repo. Is this dumb? Am I going to screw something up?
2005-10-02T11:42:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	no it won't screw things up
2005-10-02T12:40:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	try "sudo killall alsa" and then "sudo alsa &"
2005-10-02T12:42:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	actually I just tried "sudo /etc/init.d/alsa restart" which seemed to work. Is this in essence doing the same thing?
2005-10-02T12:42:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	yes it's the same thing, and what you did is a better way than what i just told you :)
2005-10-02T12:43:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	okay, thanks. BTW I think you were the one helping me with the mplayer plug-in install. It all worked out. I have 3.11 now in Firefox. Firefox still quits on me sometimes though...
2005-10-02T12:44:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	firefox close unexpectedly?
2005-10-02T12:44:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	yes it does. I thought it was related to the mplayer plugin. Now I am not sure.
2005-10-02T12:45:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	if you want to do some test, you could remove the mplayer plugin and test the firefox, if it's run fine, then it has something to do with the mplayer plugin
2005-10-02T12:46:00.000Z	whyameye	Belutz	that's a good idea.
2005-10-02T12:46:00.000Z	Belutz	whyameye	:)
