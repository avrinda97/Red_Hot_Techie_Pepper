2011-08-19T19:51:00.000Z	coz_	RA_drc	 then you will see on the left,, a vertical list of the categories.. you want to click on the "General" category.. then click on  "OpenGL" to bet into its settings,, once there,  uncheck both "Lighting"  and "Sync to VBLank"  and then test if the same problem still occurs
