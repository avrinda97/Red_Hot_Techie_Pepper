2007-07-30T05:09:00.000Z	sabgenton	vox754	if i just mount root then chroot /mnt/ubuntu is that enough or do i need to mount other stuff to
2007-07-30T05:10:00.000Z	vox754	sabgenton	maybe just get the debian packages and install them with dpkg?
2007-07-30T05:11:00.000Z	sabgenton	vox754	would as i described do the trick though?
2007-07-30T05:12:00.000Z	sabgenton	vox754	as it is easy for me
2007-07-30T05:12:00.000Z	vox754	sabgenton	I don't know. Try it then tell me. he he.
