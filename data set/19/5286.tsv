2008-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	Dominik1		how can I create a launcher that will run a command in terminal?
2008-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	shell script (bash for example)
2008-11-10T07:37:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	create a bash script, it is easy, just a line that is called the shabang, and your command in the second line
2008-11-10T07:37:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	and then give execute permissions to the file
2008-11-10T07:38:00.000Z	Dominik1	chuy	can you walk me through on how to create that file
2008-11-10T07:39:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	Stormx2 already told you whats the first line, 1.-open gedit or another text editor, 2.- put "#!/bin/bash" in the first line (without the quotes), 3.-put your command in the second line
2008-11-10T07:40:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	save the file, if you are comfortable with terminal, run chmod +x name_of_file
2008-11-10T07:41:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	otherwise, right click the file, and look for permissions, and click on execute permissions
2008-11-10T07:42:00.000Z	Dominik1	chuy	I did it, but it did not work :(, no error message, nothing, just not the desired result
2008-11-10T07:43:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	are you comfortable with console?
2008-11-10T07:43:00.000Z	Dominik1	chuy	the file won't execute because in order to use sudo it needs a password
2008-11-10T07:44:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	don't use sudo then, use gksudo instead, sudo works only if you are in a terminal, gksudo launches a dialog that asks you for the password
2008-11-10T07:45:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	gksudo is the same as gksu
2008-11-10T07:50:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	you can prepend gksudo to the second line if you need it
2008-11-10T07:51:00.000Z	Dominik1	chuy	prepend?
2008-11-10T07:52:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	prepend is the opposite of append
2008-11-10T07:52:00.000Z	Dominik1	chuy	sorry for english, so I write gksudo echo 1 | tee ....
2008-11-10T07:53:00.000Z	chuy	Dominik1	yes
2008-11-10T07:53:00.000Z	Dominik1	chuy	Stormx2: still no suces though
