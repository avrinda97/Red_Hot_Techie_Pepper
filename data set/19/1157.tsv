2011-04-27T19:30:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	it hides information about how bit the file is, truecrypt also has features to allow for hidden files inside hidden files
2011-04-27T19:33:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	ok
2011-11-06T21:17:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	fyi that was a joke
2011-11-06T21:22:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	compiz doesnt work with gnome3 it uses mutter and has less compatibility
2011-11-06T21:22:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	rather less capabilities to customize
2011-11-06T21:23:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	okay
2011-11-06T23:26:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	check mount and see if there is a .Private mounted on /home/username
2011-11-06T23:35:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	did not undertood you. bekks nope
2011-11-06T23:36:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	you cannot have autologin and encrypted home. its impossible. to see if you have encrypted home type "mount | grep Private" in your terminal and see if it outputs anything
2011-11-06T23:40:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	i think you misunderstood something. i know that we can not have autologin and encrtpt both. i was just telling what happend with me when i was installing 11.10. let me try that command
2011-11-06T23:40:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	im explaining why the checkbox would be disabled
2011-11-06T23:40:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	that commmand gives a result about ecryptfs
2011-11-06T23:41:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	then you have an encrypted partition in the place listed after it says "on"
2011-11-06T23:41:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	thats "on" as in "location" not "on/off"
2011-11-06T23:41:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	its saying that the encrypted source /home/user/.Private is unencrypted and placed on top of /home/user
2011-11-06T23:42:00.000Z	Abhijit	escott	it says /home/abhijit/.Private on /home/abhijit/Private what that mean? is my whole /home is encrypted?
2011-11-06T23:43:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	no it means the folder /home/abhijit/Private is encrypted. not the entire /home/abhijit
2011-11-06T23:43:00.000Z	escott	Abhijit	the ciphertext is /home/abhijit/.Private
