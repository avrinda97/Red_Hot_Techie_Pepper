2010-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	unclemantis		ok i am really getting upset now
2010-07-09T07:25:00.000Z	unclemantis		i have spent 2 days trying to get a FTPSD running with no luck. I am then told to connect via SSH using SFTP so I did that and it worked! Now 5 hours later I try again and it won't connect. I then try to SSH into the account and I get the welcome to Ubuntu and the document url and stuff and then this "Connection to gigdates.com closed." WTF happened!?
2010-07-09T07:26:00.000Z	unclemantis		i am a programer, not an admin so this really pisses me off :(
2010-07-09T07:27:00.000Z	unclemantis		I AM able to log in using root
2010-07-09T07:27:00.000Z	unclemantis		i do not have any other users, just one other
2010-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	unclemantis		ok. so no instant answer :(
2010-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	unclemantis		i am reading to check hosts.deny and that is empty
2010-07-09T07:31:00.000Z	unclemantis		and NOTHING has changed since the last time i tried this and it worked until now
2010-07-09T07:33:00.000Z	DarkStar1	unclemantis	sorry I just got back. What seems to be the problem?
2010-07-09T07:33:00.000Z	unclemantis		could you scroll up? I do not wish to repost. Thanks for acknoledging :)
2010-07-09T07:36:00.000Z	DarkStar1	unclemantis	tbh I'm not 10% SSH identified let alone 100% but I can try to diagnose the problem for you.
2010-07-09T07:37:00.000Z	unclemantis		do you wish access to the box? I could really care less. I have no data and I can simply just rebuild
2010-07-09T07:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	unclemantis	You say nothing has changed and you can only log in as root?
2010-07-09T07:37:00.000Z	unclemantis		Correct DarkStar1 and please do not repermand me about not logging in as another su :) i will get to that
2010-07-09T07:38:00.000Z	DarkStar1	unclemantis	Also as a foreward you might actually get better help from the #networking channel
2010-07-09T07:38:00.000Z	unclemantis		Well I figured I was using Ubuntu and this channel usualy helps with ANYTHING in Ubuntu, I thought I would give it a shot
2010-07-09T07:38:00.000Z	DarkStar1	unclemantis	the best security you practice is up to you. We can't all act the same way :)
2010-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	unclemantis	DarkStar1	/msg me if you wish access and if you think you can actualy help out =)
2010-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	DarkStar1	unclemantis	do you have physical access to the server?
