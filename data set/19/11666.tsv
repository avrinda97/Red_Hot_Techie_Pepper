2005-12-11T10:10:00.000Z	mistik1		Can one of you guys tell me what version of  the quota package is in the latest Ubuntu and maybe if it supports JFS?
2005-12-11T10:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	Filename: pool/main/q/quota/quota_3.13-1_i386.deb
2005-12-11T10:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	not installed here, so i can't tell you about support/performance though, sorry
2005-12-11T10:12:00.000Z	mistik1	eyequeue	I think that version supports JFS iirc
2005-12-11T10:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	Kyral, i'm going to guess that installing things like the meta-package "ubuntu-desktop" might be a big factor in helping "most" of the gotchas in a debian->ubuntu transition
2005-12-11T10:18:00.000Z	mistik1	eyequeue	BTW, I have to do all this on a machine 1000 miles away :)
2005-12-11T10:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	heh, been there don't that, AND been bitten :)  if ever you upgrade sshd, ssh OUT, then back IN, before dropping your current connection :)  that's the only tidbit of advice i'd offer
2005-12-11T10:19:00.000Z	mistik1	eyequeue	Oh for sure
2006-09-25T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	completely unsupported
2006-09-25T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	any kubuntu sources though
2006-09-25T05:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	i did similar to ubuntu-minimal for a server
2006-09-25T05:38:00.000Z	mistik1	eyequeue	unsupported or not I need to do this
2006-09-25T05:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	so it's "possible" but you'll have pains, and it may or may not end up how you like
2006-09-25T05:39:00.000Z	mistik1	eyequeue	I have 11 years linux experience I can get past the problems
2006-09-25T05:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	but you'll also be completely on your own :/    if fluent, it can be a project :)  took me a few days here
2006-09-25T05:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	if debian-fluent and a bit ubuntu-fluent, i'll bet you succeed :)  start with ubuntu-minimal, get that working, then sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop when you are ready
2006-09-25T05:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	one line to start you:  deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main restricted
2006-09-25T05:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	i recommend starting simple, then add universe or whatever afterward
2006-09-25T05:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	mistik1	and yes kubuntu uses ubuntu repos :)
