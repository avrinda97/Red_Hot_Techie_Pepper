2010-02-11T23:31:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	did you add the old 2.4 ppa? and did you check if it still provides the driver even?
2010-02-11T23:32:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	yeah.. I added the ppa  I also update the package database  don't know, what you mean with "and did you check if it still provides the driver even"  though...  do they remove the backport drivers sometimes?
2010-02-11T23:33:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	its not a backport archive
2010-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	also when you go to the page https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-retro it does not listed the intel-2.4 package for karmic
2010-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	yupp I just realized that, too...
2010-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	well.. what do I do then :)?
2010-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	use the intel driver in karmic?
2010-02-11T23:35:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	yeah.. I want the old version, sincne i need the performance of 8.10 but don#t want to deinstall my karmic for this...
2010-02-11T23:35:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	any idea how I can do this :)?
2010-02-11T23:36:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	by the wiki that never worked, it lets you use the intrepid driver in hardy
2010-02-11T23:38:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	yeah but I would rather like to use the hardy driver in karmic :)  that's my actual goal....
2010-02-11T23:39:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	i see, but its not packaged for karmic, at least not in that ppa
2010-02-11T23:40:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	do you think it would be a good idea to install this package:  https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-retro/+sourcepub/644745/+listing-archive-extra  manually?
2010-02-11T23:40:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	yes , use the provided intel driver or try building your own version of the 2.4 driver(or find someone that packaged it for karmic, but i doubt it tbh)
2010-02-11T23:42:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	i dont know, probably not since drivers are particularly finniky, if you need 2.4 (why?) consider downgrading to jaunty?
2010-02-11T23:43:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	I need to run a 3d-program which runs reallyreally slow with the new driver...  last working version was in ubuntu 8.04
2010-02-11T23:44:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	I am gonna try that package now.. maybe it works :)  i think I can not damage anything with this, can I?
2010-02-11T23:52:00.000Z	howlymowly	acicula	yupp i just installed the package..  and as I am writing in this channel it looks like it works :)
2010-02-11T23:53:00.000Z	acicula	howlymowly	cool
