2012-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	ubuntu-guy		First question how can i change the hostname please ? It possible to change using "hostname somehost" command but i want to change it for CD . I have tried to edit /etc/hosts , /etc/hostname, /etc/resolves etc but does not work... Please help me
2012-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	you can't change it for the CD
2012-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	ubuntu-guy	ikonia	thanks for reply... But i have seen that some peoples did it . Such as gnatrack, http://www.gnacktrack.co.uk/images/screenshot9.png
2012-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	typing "hostname $new_name" will set the hostname, but it really "won't" set the hostname properly
2012-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	also that is just the PS1 prompt, ubuntu-guy try PS1='james@bigbox' and you'll see that prompt change
2012-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	ubuntu-guy	ikonia	Do i need to edit any text configuration file for that?
2012-02-24T13:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	no, just type it in the terminal
2012-02-24T13:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	eg "PS1='ikonia@yourbox'
2012-02-24T13:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	be aware that's not changing the hostname
2012-02-24T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	you'll also find that the person in that screen shot isn't using ubuntu, but a varient called "gnattrack"
2012-02-24T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	does that explain things a bit better for you ?
2012-02-24T13:51:00.000Z	ubuntu-guy	ikonia	i see, Make me it more clear, I am following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization . Now i want to change the default setting of ubuntu such as the Boot splash(Plymouth) and CD host name(Prompt) and then write to a DVD or CD. And when i will boot my own live cd it will show my customized Boot splash and the prompt hostname(Such as (love-ubuntu@ikonia).

2012-02-24T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	sure
2012-02-24T14:00:00.000Z	ubuntu-guy	ikonia	thanks for giving me some motivation.... Not understand where i should start for changing this two things correctly.. I need some help
2012-02-24T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	read the documentation, if you can't work out where to start, it's probably beyond your ability at this time
2012-02-24T14:01:00.000Z	ubuntu-guy	ikonia	Any suggested Link  or tutorial please?
2012-02-24T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntu-guy	sorry no
