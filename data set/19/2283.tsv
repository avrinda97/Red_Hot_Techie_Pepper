2010-08-28T23:11:00.000Z	DoubleString		Hey guys
2010-08-28T23:11:00.000Z	DoubleString		is it possible to modificate
2010-08-28T23:11:00.000Z	DoubleString		indication applet
2010-08-28T23:12:00.000Z	DoubleString		so that instead of Evolution mail client
2010-08-28T23:12:00.000Z	DoubleString		I could get gmail in default browser?
2010-08-28T23:13:00.000Z	DoubleString		it goes for links
2010-08-28T23:13:00.000Z	DoubleString		not for the indicator applet
2010-08-28T23:13:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	you could use a ff extension like webmail notifier?
2010-08-28T23:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	why can't you setup evolution to check your gmail?  then that icon would be for your gmal...
2010-08-28T23:18:00.000Z	DoubleString	arrrghhh	because evolution is not comfy for e-mails
2010-08-28T23:19:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	ok... so use a firefox addon or something.  i use one called webmail notifier.
2010-08-28T23:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	you check your email with a bash command...?
2010-08-28T23:21:00.000Z	DoubleString	arrrghhh	every time
2010-08-28T23:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	so you want a link on your top bar that kicks off that command basically?
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	so what, i'm looking at that now.
2010-08-28T23:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	yes, that's a link for evolution.  you can add a shortcut link to that bar, but you won't be able to use that icon.
2010-08-28T23:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	just make a shortcut for that command and put it in the top bar.
2010-08-28T23:26:00.000Z	DoubleString	arrrghhh	it doesn't make sense
2010-08-28T23:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	DoubleString	what doesn't make sense...?  it's an indicator icon.
