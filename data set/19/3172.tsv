2010-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	i think there's a Jocket utility for text-mode 'jockey-text' probably
2010-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	how would I use 'jocky-text'
2010-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	i've not used it, but it should be a friendly way to install the binary drivers
2010-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	i think dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will re-generate a clean xorg.conf file
2010-07-04T12:17:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	how did you install the drivers?
2010-07-04T12:19:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	I used the Hardware Drivers selection under System->Administration
2010-07-04T12:20:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	i had good success with installing the drivers from nvidia, bit of a pain though
2010-07-04T12:22:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	thanks to you too. I'm trying the rename of vesa to nv, and I am now restarting.
2010-07-04T12:23:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	someone else suggested that, but good luck, it should work
2010-07-04T12:31:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	are you using the proprietary drivers now?
2010-07-04T12:34:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	I am using the nv which I assume is nvidia. Only thing is, when I go to the nvidia config tool It tells me I don't appear to be using the nvidia-x-driver
2010-07-04T12:34:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	i think you're using the open source one
2010-07-04T12:38:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	prince_jammys: installing the proprietary drivers is what got me here with no monitor recognition. now with the open source one my resolution is so huge a good portion of interface is off screen.
2010-07-04T12:56:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	/etc/init.d/gdm restart  might do it
2010-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	I am getting this when I use /etc/init.d/gdm restart: Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)
2010-07-04T12:58:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	they changed stuff recently, do what that says
2010-07-04T13:00:00.000Z	quentin	codebrainz	I only used "restart gdm" and got: Warning: Fake initctl called, doing nothing.
2010-07-04T13:01:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	I'm not sure with upstart
2010-07-04T13:01:00.000Z	codebrainz	quentin	i just went into a console, stopped gdm, wget'd the sode, compiled, and rebooted, iirc
