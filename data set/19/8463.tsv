2007-04-29T10:51:00.000Z	CommanderCool		each time i open a folder containing .eps-files the system gets slower and slower till it is not usable anymore
2007-04-29T10:51:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	disable thumbnail previewing in nautilus
2007-04-29T10:52:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	i thought of something like that, but is there another way (if i like that preview^^)
2007-04-29T10:55:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	you might want to try creating the thumbnails "on foot" with an image converter. If you run 'ps auxw' a few times while nautilus is creating them, you should be able to find out the required command line.
2007-06-19T10:08:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	it's a wiki page. You can correct it yourself
2007-06-19T10:09:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	true, if i knew how to solve the problem
2007-06-19T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	if you have a problem, then describe the problem.
2007-06-19T10:12:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	describe the problem
2007-06-19T10:14:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	you need to be a bit more precise
2007-06-19T10:16:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	okay, i followed the instructions on the mentioned site, installed the mentioned packages but then it tells me to download some repositories and this step does not work
2007-06-19T10:17:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	do you mean the step that starts with 'hg'?
2007-06-19T10:17:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	correct
2007-06-19T10:18:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	what do you get when you run 'sudo apt-get install mercurial'?
2007-06-19T10:18:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	don't paste please, just say what it says
2007-06-19T10:18:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	it is already installed
2007-06-19T10:20:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	does it say '...does not appear to be an hg repository...'?
2007-06-19T10:21:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	when i try that "hg ..."-command, yes
2007-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	soundray	CommanderCool	that repository has moved. 'hg clone http://mcentral.de/hg/~mrec/v4l-dvb-kernel' works.
2007-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	CommanderCool	soundray	i got those repositories from the homepage now...i'll try this and address to you, if it does not work
