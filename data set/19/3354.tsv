2009-09-16T04:17:00.000Z	Cainus		hey all... any screen users in here?  Does anyone know why screen -ls might list a bunch of screens I'm attached to, but I can't actually switch to any of them?
2009-09-16T04:19:00.000Z	Cainus		ctrl-a n to switch to the next
2009-09-16T04:19:00.000Z	Cainus		screen -wipe doesn't change the list
2009-09-16T04:20:00.000Z	Cainus		Ah.. how do I change the screen instance then?
2009-09-16T04:20:00.000Z	Cainus		is that my problem?
2009-09-16T04:21:00.000Z	Cainus		Boon: you mean screen -r ?  it lists a bunch of attached screens and says there is no screen to be resumed
2009-09-16T04:22:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	it will force disconnect the screen if it is currently connected
2009-09-16T04:20:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	tried screen -R yet?
2009-09-16T04:21:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	if you are in a screen press ctrl+a then shift+"
2009-09-16T04:21:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	no -R is like a more powerfull -r if i remember right
2009-09-16T04:22:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	but like mentioned are you in screen trying to do that?
2009-09-16T04:23:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	yea they are attached so I would just exit out as much as you can the start fresh with a screen -R
2009-09-16T04:23:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	the screen -R will detach it and allow you to connect
2009-09-16T04:27:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	exit
2009-09-16T04:30:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	sure there is, but depends on what your doing
2009-09-16T04:31:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	for example i used to run a headless torrent box, and ssh was my means of access. I would load a torrent on each screen to be able to quickly connect and see them.
2009-09-16T04:31:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	with a gui it is pointless
2009-09-16T04:31:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	with a gui i can only see needing that to launch an app or script and leave it in the background and logout
2009-09-16T04:32:00.000Z	Boondoklife	Cainus	that way you could come back later screen back in and be back where you left off.
