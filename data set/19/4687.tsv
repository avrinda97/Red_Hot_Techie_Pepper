2010-09-14T05:33:00.000Z	gionnico		and will give you a hint on what group you want for other users
2010-09-14T05:34:00.000Z	gionnico		i have another trouble: I updated 8.04->10.04. i did fresh install but just keep /home partition. well i have a canon eos 350D rebel XT digital reflex camera but gphoto (PTP) doesn't work ANYMORE
2010-09-14T05:35:00.000Z	gionnico		if i plug the camera i get error and if i unplug it well the camera remains screwed up and ANY COMPUTER can read it using PTP. i have to remove battery..
2010-09-14T05:35:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	gionnico	don't use gphoto, but did you upgrade it?
2010-09-14T05:35:00.000Z	gionnico	noisewaterphd	as i said i did fresh install. i'm sure in 2 years gphoto was updated
2010-09-14T05:36:00.000Z	gionnico		but i still have the old config files
2010-09-14T05:36:00.000Z	gionnico		for everything. gnome eog, f-spot gphoto : all my config files
2010-09-14T05:36:00.000Z	gionnico		and dont know which could be broken by an updated package
2010-09-14T05:36:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	gionnico	OH, I thought you just updated the OS, I missed the fresh install thing
2010-09-14T05:36:00.000Z	gionnico		config files should auto-update and new version should cope with old version config files
2010-09-14T05:37:00.000Z	gionnico		fresh install but i kept /home
2010-09-14T05:37:00.000Z	gionnico		it was in a separate partition and told to use that during installation
2010-09-14T05:37:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	gionnico	install the medibuntu repositories and see if that gets your canon functionality back
2010-09-14T05:38:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	gionnico	I sort of remember needing a few libraries from medibuntu to get my XTI working in lucid
2010-09-14T05:39:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	gionnico	I am just shooting in the dark though without a pastebin of your logs
2010-09-14T05:39:00.000Z	gionnico	noisewaterphd	theres something weird because the same camera works on fresh install UNR 10.04 !!
2010-09-14T05:40:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	gionnico	ah, yes, then pastebin as verbose of a log as you can get then and we'll track it down
2010-09-14T05:41:00.000Z	gionnico	noisewaterphd	ok i dont have that machine now. i'll be back here then
