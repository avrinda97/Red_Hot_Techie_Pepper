2009-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	beardedchimp		How can I execute a program held in /usr/bin in a directory other than where I currently am, ie something like ./foo/ls
2009-10-08T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	just type its name, /usr/bin is in your $PATH
2009-10-08T14:25:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	If i try that it complains that ./foo/ls doesnt exist
2009-10-08T14:25:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	And i can't cd to foo before running ls
2009-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	ls is in /bin
2009-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	are you typing ls or ./ls ?
2009-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	Ahh doing /bin/ls ./foo/ works
2009-10-08T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	the command should be:    ls ./foo
2009-10-08T14:27:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	To explains I have a program that outputs to its current directory, but i am ../ from where it needs to execute
2009-10-08T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	you can use the absolute path if you want
2009-10-08T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	ls /path/to/foo
2009-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	But the program i am running cant be passed a directory as an argument
2009-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	So i cant pass ~/directory2/this
2009-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	what will it accept?
2009-10-08T14:30:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	Im piping to it
2009-10-08T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	if it makes it work / be easier, i'd do it
2009-10-08T14:31:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	Easier in short term, not long term
2009-10-08T14:32:00.000Z	beardedchimp	ActionParsnip	But ill use that solution for time being
2009-10-08T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beardedchimp	np man :D
