2009-08-28T23:26:00.000Z	parapan		my USB modem is not working anymore ......ICON 225 on Jaunty > any help for this issue please ???
2009-08-28T23:27:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	did you try googling the same issue? if not try that,,you might get some help out there
2009-08-28T23:28:00.000Z	parapan	__theIdiotBox	done this and found out something on the net except that they say if kernel bigger then 2.6 I should use the driver on the kernel ...which is not working :d
2009-08-28T23:28:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	if you can't do that be more specific and let me google it
2009-08-28T23:29:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	oops
2009-08-28T23:30:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	okey wait a  min
2009-08-28T23:32:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	whats the kernel version you're having? it says the driver is working fine for 2.6.27
2009-08-28T23:33:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	btw, as a last resort you have to compile it from source..did you try that ?
2009-08-28T23:33:00.000Z	parapan	__theIdiotBox	2.6.28-15
2009-08-28T23:33:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	in that case may be we need to compile it from source right?
2009-08-28T23:33:00.000Z	parapan	__theIdiotBox	wasn't sure if I'm not going to screw something else :d so I didn't
2009-08-28T23:35:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	we're going to compile just that module only, do you have other dependencies on that which might break if there are some issues during compilation?
2009-08-28T23:36:00.000Z	parapan	__theIdiotBox	> well ...you tell me :d should I try this or not ? could it be more damaging for the network manager for example ????
2009-08-28T23:36:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	the links you gave me talks about compiling from src in depth...so i think you can easily follow that, right?
2009-08-28T23:36:00.000Z	parapan	__theIdiotBox	: yeap I can follow ....
2009-08-28T23:37:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	its segregated...no impact on others..try it out...it shud work...but make sure you follow the steps religiously
2009-08-28T23:37:00.000Z	parapan	__theIdiotBox	: only that I wanted to check that first ....and not to jump on the process
2009-08-28T23:37:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	coool...go for it...
2009-08-28T23:42:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	parapan	still stuck? ....i hope not....gotta go...c ya
