2005-06-17T05:26:00.000Z	Tardis		what's this mean?
2005-06-17T05:27:00.000Z	Jormundgand	Tardis	Enable universe and multiverse.
2005-06-17T05:27:00.000Z	Tardis		This would be in synaptic?  I was pretty sure that it was enabled.
2005-06-17T05:27:00.000Z	Tardis		I'll check
2005-06-17T05:29:00.000Z	Tardis	Jormundgand	it seems that they are enabled.
2005-06-17T05:30:00.000Z	Jormundgand	Tardis	Hmm. Have you done apt-get update?
2005-06-17T05:30:00.000Z	Tardis		yes
2005-06-17T05:30:00.000Z	Jormundgand	Tardis	Hoary or Breezy?
2005-06-17T05:30:00.000Z	Tardis	Jormundgand	Hoary
2005-06-17T05:30:00.000Z	Jormundgand	Tardis	No idea then, sorry.
