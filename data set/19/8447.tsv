2007-04-07T15:25:00.000Z	McFrosty		Anyone able to help me get my wireless card working with ndiswrapper?
2007-04-07T15:25:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	at I use it
2007-04-07T15:27:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	I reinstalled ubuntu and before I did I had it working but I believe I have done everything the same but it's not even showing up
2007-04-07T15:28:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	does your nic show if you type ifconfig -a in a terminal?
2007-04-07T15:29:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	mwe: I see my eth0 which is what I am using now (lan), I also see lo and sit0 but nothing really for those.
2007-04-07T15:29:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	hmm. is ndiswrapper loaded? (lsmod|grep ndis)
2007-04-07T15:31:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	^^
2007-04-07T15:34:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	ndiswrapper is showing when I run lsmod | grep ndis
2007-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	how about ndiswrapper -l?
2007-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	what does that say?
2007-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	b44win driver installed, hardware present
2007-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	iwconfig -a?
2007-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	-a no such device
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	iwconfig just
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	no wireless extensions. for lo, eth0, and sit0
2007-04-07T15:38:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	hmm. not sure what's up. you can try sudo modprobe -r ndiswrapper then modprobe ndiswrapper. then type dmesg and look for ndiswrapper errors
2007-04-07T15:38:00.000Z	mwe	McFrosty	sudo modprobe for both even
2007-04-07T15:38:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	will try and let you know if I find something
2007-04-07T15:55:00.000Z	McFrosty	mwe	I did notice I was using v1.22 instead of 1.39 but even after upgrading it's still not showing up. I will look at it more later, heading off to grab some dinner
