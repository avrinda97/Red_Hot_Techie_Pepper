2009-08-21T06:32:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	lsb_release -a
2009-08-21T06:32:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	maco	command not found.
2009-08-21T06:32:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	maco	sorry it worked.
2009-08-21T06:33:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	maco	it's 8.04 Hardy. How do I update it?
2009-08-21T06:33:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	you want to go to 8.10?
2009-08-21T06:33:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	maco	how do I update from Hardy to the newest distribution?
2009-08-21T06:33:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	system -> administration -> software sources. change it so that itll show all new versions instead of only long term support releases
2009-08-21T06:34:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	you have to go through 8.10 to get to 9.04. skipping's not really supported
2009-08-21T06:34:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	once thats done, run the system -> administration -> update manager andtell it to check for updtes. it should then offer you 8.10
2009-08-21T06:35:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	see the setting in tehre about what kind of updates to show?
2009-08-21T06:35:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	maco	yesah.
2009-08-21T06:35:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	it should offer like "only long term support releases" or "all new versions" or "dont tell me" i think?
2009-08-21T06:36:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	the default is long term support releases only. change it to all
2010-05-06T02:06:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	if youre using vpnc, /etc/vpnc/*.conf
2010-05-06T02:06:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	if youre using openvpn, /etc/openvpn/client.conf
2010-05-06T02:06:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	if you use network manager to do your vpn stuff though, then i dont know
2010-05-06T02:07:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	maco	I'm using network manager.
2010-05-06T02:08:00.000Z	maco	SealedWithAKiss	in that case, somewhere in your homedir, likely in ~/.gconf
