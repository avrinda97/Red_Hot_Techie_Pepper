2010-03-27T21:27:00.000Z	frxstrem		I have a little problem: I am setting up a webserver using XAMPP for Linux, but I cannot edit the files in the "htdocs" folder because I do not have the permission to do so. How can I get these permission without removing them from the root user?
2010-03-27T21:27:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	edit as the user/group who owns the files using sudo
2010-03-27T21:28:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	won't this remove the rights from the root use?
2010-03-27T21:58:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	if you edit and save as a user it will get that users permissions, yes
2010-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	various improvements
2010-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	so ext4 is better than ext3 and ext2?
2010-03-27T22:29:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	in most cases
2010-03-27T22:29:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	okay :) thanks
2010-03-27T23:55:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	directories,real files, links, etc
2010-03-27T23:55:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	its confiurable thouh
2010-03-27T23:55:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	but what does the specific colors mean by default?
2010-03-27T23:56:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	on ubuntu, blue=directory,light blue=link, something red is setuid i think and inverted red is broken link
2010-03-27T23:56:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	okay, thanks ;)
2010-05-03T01:39:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	processes are already sandboxed, what do you mean by not interacting?
2010-05-03T01:40:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	for instance, if I have an instance of Firefox open (that's not chrooted) and I open firefox in my chroot environment, then the chrooted Firefox detects the already opened Firefox instance and opens a new window in that process instead
2010-05-03T01:40:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	different users, apparmor/selinux can do that kind of sandboxing
2010-05-03T01:41:00.000Z	frxstrem	acicula	okay, thanks for your answer
2010-05-03T01:41:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	chroot just does that, change the root for that process(namespace)
2010-05-22T22:14:00.000Z	acicula	frxstrem	different sources, your firewall rules dictate if it is accessible(and by whom), wether there is somethin listening there is depenent on the program, netstat will tell you that
