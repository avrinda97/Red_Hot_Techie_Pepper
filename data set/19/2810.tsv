2010-03-24T21:10:00.000Z	TomV_415		what is happening at boot time to make ubuntu think I'm 'out of disk'??
2010-03-24T21:11:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	Err... "out of disc"?
2010-03-24T21:11:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	'out of disk' is the error I'm getting when I try to boot.
2010-03-24T21:12:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	Ah, sounds like some partitioning error, boot from a cd and fsck your hard drive
2010-03-24T21:12:00.000Z	TomV_415		what does fsck do?
2010-03-24T21:12:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	fsck : FileSystem ChecK.
2010-03-24T21:12:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	got it... I'm reading the man page now.  Thanks for the suggestion!  Hope that does the trick!
2010-03-24T21:15:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	when i try to run fsck (fsck -As) all I get is 'fsk form util-linux-ng 2.16' and back to the prompt (ubuntu@ubuntu: ~$')
2010-03-24T21:15:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	Try just "fsck". Also, that must be run as root.
2010-03-24T21:16:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	 I tried 'sudo fsck' and got same thing...
2010-03-24T21:16:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	Huh. So most likely filesystem is sane. Weird.
2010-03-24T21:17:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	how do i make sure I'm root?  I tried 'su" and I'm asked for password... but I'm using the liveCD..
2010-03-24T21:17:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	"su" is not working anymore, it's old. sudo -i
2010-03-24T21:18:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	whoami -> ubuntu
2010-03-24T21:19:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	no luck.. I did manage to make sure I'm root... but fsck does not do anything.. just returns the "fsck from util-linux-ng 2.16"
2010-03-24T21:19:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	(sudo -i did the trick)
2010-03-24T21:19:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	Crap. Guess i was wrong from the beginning.
2010-03-24T21:19:00.000Z	theadmin	TomV_415	No idea then.
2010-03-24T21:19:00.000Z	TomV_415	theadmin	thanks for the help anyay.  Anyone else have a suggestion?
