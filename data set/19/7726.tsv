2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		k
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Anlar	Spork	it should have only 3 lines by default in it, containing the words "fuse" "lpr" and "sbp2" on their own lines
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		it was 200 bytes
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		so i guess that's possible
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Anlar	Spork	there's a useless comment before them
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork	Anlar	is yours 200 bytes?
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Anlar	Spork	about yeah
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		hmm mine was exactly 200
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		now its 400
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		err
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Spork		14
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Anlar	Spork	it's just fine. there's some commented out lines at the beginning of the default file, you don't need them
