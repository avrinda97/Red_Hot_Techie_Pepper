2011-07-19T15:11:00.000Z	rumba		What's up with Ubuntu 11.04? It keeps crashing every few minutes and I didn't even install/configure very much.
2011-07-19T15:12:00.000Z	rumba		The screen keeps going black, then shows the image again, then black, then the image again and I can't click on anything. When I get bored of watching that, I have to do a cold reboot.
2011-07-19T15:12:00.000Z	rumba		There's also the dock at the left side of the screen that sometimes appears and it just won't go away. How do I hide it?
2011-07-19T15:13:00.000Z	rumba		I would like to replace it with Cairo-Dock.
2011-07-19T15:15:00.000Z	rumba		I can't work like this...
2011-07-19T15:17:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	that is because the display drivers aren't installed properly
2011-07-19T15:17:00.000Z	rumba	MrNthDegree	It worked fine for exactly two weeks.
2011-07-19T15:17:00.000Z	rumba	MrNthDegree	So what can I do about it?
2011-07-19T15:17:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	I don't tend to use non-LTS versions of Ubuntu
2011-07-19T15:18:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	check your drivers are installed correctly if you're using either ATI or NVIDIA proprietary drivers
2011-07-19T15:19:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	also keep in mind if you're using Unity, that it's quite a new desktop environment and is quite rough
2011-07-19T15:19:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	Unity tends to expose bugs in a lot of drivers when running with 3D effects enabled
2011-07-19T15:20:00.000Z	rumba	MrNthDegree	How do I know if 3D effects are enabled?
2011-07-19T15:21:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	for Unity, you'd know if you've installed compiz
2011-07-19T15:22:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	try the following for me:  http://ubuntuguide.net/ubuntu-11-04-natty-login-to-classic-gnome-2-desktop
2011-07-19T15:22:00.000Z	rumba	MrNthDegree	Well, compiz is installed.
2011-07-19T15:22:00.000Z	rumba	MrNthDegree	Thanks, great!
2011-07-19T15:23:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	rumba	the GNOME 2 desktop is a very well tested environment, while Unity is still very new (think of it as akin to when Vista first came out!)
2011-07-19T15:47:00.000Z	rumba	MrNthDegree	I chose Ubuntu Classic at the login screen. This is exactly what I wanted and I hope it will behave better. Thanks!
