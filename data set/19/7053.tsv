2008-01-04T02:29:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Q: are there any extra packages on the DVD or is it just all-three-installdisks ?
2008-01-04T02:30:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	Its [install disk of choice] + alternate + extra packages
2008-01-04T02:30:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	Its not all three
2008-01-04T02:31:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	If you have an internet connection, all the packages on the DVD are available in the rpeositories
2008-01-04T02:32:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	Its GUI + GUI Installer + Text Installer + PAckages.  'Server' being "non graphical installed system" yes, not LAMP stack pre-config
2008-01-04T02:32:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	Well, those packages will mostly be obsolete now, because of regular updates.
2008-01-04T02:32:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/7.10/release/ubuntu-7.10-dvd-i386.list has a list of the packages
2008-01-04T02:33:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Flannel	yeah, I know... I just want to know what those packages are.. I looked all over ubuntu.com and I can't find a description of what else is on the DVD
2008-02-15T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	#ubuntu+1
2008-02-15T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyReleaseSchedule
2008-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Flannel	btw; iptables -F won't change the default DENY rule...
2008-05-31T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	No
2008-06-17T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	check the .list file (and diff it with the alternate CD)
2008-06-17T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04/release/ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i386.list and http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.list
2008-06-28T03:02:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Flannel	there are drivers for ext2/3 and reiserfs support in windows
2008-06-30T00:49:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	if you really want to, you can convert back to ext2, defrag, then convert back to ext3.  But theres no reason to do so
2008-08-16T07:42:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	We're here.
2009-04-06T04:43:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	Write it up on the wiki!
2009-04-06T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	zcat[1]	pumpkinseed: in Ubuntu we use menu.lst not grub.conf (theyre the same thing)
