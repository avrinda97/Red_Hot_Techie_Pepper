2007-06-18T12:52:00.000Z	fury		rebooting
2007-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	fury		hm. O_o why is the display sliced in half and shuffled around
2007-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	fury		on the exit screen
2007-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	fury		is that just a weird oddity from me using an analog display on a DVI output
2007-06-18T12:54:00.000Z	fury		yeah. i have a Sony 32" HDTV hooked up as my PC monitor. it only has an analog cable
2007-06-18T12:54:00.000Z	fury		but my video card is nothing but DVI
2007-06-18T12:54:00.000Z	fury		geforce 7800 GT
2007-06-18T12:54:00.000Z	fury		yeah. it's pretty good
2007-06-18T12:54:00.000Z	fury		1360x768
2007-06-18T12:54:00.000Z	fury		yeah, i'm using an adapter
2007-06-18T12:55:00.000Z	holycow	fury	wow, just congrats on making that work i guess :)
2007-06-18T12:55:00.000Z	holycow	fury	i didn't know it would autodetect
2007-06-18T12:55:00.000Z	holycow	fury	how did you do that? just curious
2007-06-18T12:56:00.000Z	holycow	fury	if your monitor can handle it sure, your xorg.conf file will tell xserver what to output
2007-06-18T12:56:00.000Z	fury	holycow	the video card came with an adapter to hook up one analog (i.e. regular DB-15 VGA-style connector) monitor
2007-06-18T12:56:00.000Z	holycow	fury	so how is the picture quality?
2007-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	holycow	fury	thats interesting i am checking out 24" lcds which are now very affordeable
2007-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	holycow	fury	no, you also need the correct vertical and horizontal refresh rates for your display device for those resolutions to appear
2007-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	fury	holycow	i think it got that from DPMS
