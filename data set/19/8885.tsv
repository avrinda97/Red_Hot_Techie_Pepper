2008-08-13T01:00:00.000Z	locohost_		what do you mean, is that safe?
2008-08-13T01:00:00.000Z	locohost_		yeah, its perfectly fine to add a user to sudoers, if you trust that user and would other wise give them root access
2008-08-13T01:00:00.000Z	locohost_		as long as you use visudo, it will tell you if you have an error in syntax
2008-08-13T01:00:00.000Z	locohost_		and warn you before saving if you have a problem
2008-08-13T01:01:00.000Z	locohost_		user           ALL=(ALL) /bin/grep, /usr/bin/tail, /usr/bin/less, /bin/cat, /bin/tac, /usr/bin/zgrep, /usr/bin/strace, /bin/netstat, /usr/sbin/tethereal, /usr/sbin/tcpdump
2008-08-13T01:01:00.000Z	locohost_		you can do stuff like that too
2008-08-13T01:02:00.000Z	locohost_		if you only want them to be able to execute certain commands
2008-08-13T01:02:00.000Z	locohost_		sudo isnt really a security mehenism though, its kinda of a guid
