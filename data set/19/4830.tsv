2010-04-17T17:01:00.000Z	bloopletech		Has anyone has success in installing libgtk2.0-dev? It keeps complaining: http://pastie.org/924483 ; I've already run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-04-17T17:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	sudo apt-get install -f
2010-04-17T17:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	-f tries to fix the broken packages
2010-04-17T17:03:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	I've tried that, same answer
2010-04-17T17:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	try installing those 5 depends?
2010-04-17T17:05:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	then I get this: http://pastie.org/924484
2010-04-17T17:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	this is on lucid?
2010-04-17T17:05:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	no, on karmic
2010-04-17T17:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	look like your stuck in dependency loop there :/
2010-04-17T17:07:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	it looks like the versions of libcairo2 is very slightly different from libcairo2-dev I think
2010-04-17T17:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	the problem is that it is looking for libcairo21.8.8-2ubuntu1 but the repo has  1.8.8-2ubuntu1.1
2010-04-17T17:09:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	yeah
2010-04-17T17:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	hmm you could try forcing it to install
2010-04-17T17:09:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	I wonder how the repo got into this state though
2010-04-17T17:10:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	tried that, same result i.e. 'E: Broken packages'
2010-04-17T17:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	you may want to report a bug against libcairo2-dev
2010-04-17T17:10:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	thanks ;)
2010-04-17T17:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	bloopletech	in the bug report link to your pastebins
2010-04-17T17:57:00.000Z	bloopletech	IdleOne	I finally solved my problem
