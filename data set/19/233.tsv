2012-06-08T00:39:00.000Z	hop5uk		Can anybody tell me why this raid 5 array is displaying U__ at the end -md2 : active raid5 sde[3](S) sdd[1](F) sdc[0]       1953522816 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/1] [U__]
2012-06-08T00:41:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	because only one disk (of 3) is present - that would mean it is dead
2012-06-08T00:44:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	yes, a raid5 array can only preserve data while one disk is missing, when two fail your data are lost
2012-06-08T00:48:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	it doesn't matter if they are new - somehow the array got borked - maybe you just need to readd/activate them
2012-06-08T00:50:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	fire up the disk utility and have a look what it tells you about your raid5 array
2012-06-08T00:52:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	and you don't need the brackets around a nick :)
2012-06-14T23:38:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	i spoke to you the other day about raid 5 ?
2012-06-14T23:39:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	sorry, I don't remember - can I help?
2012-06-14T23:42:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	I have been trying for a week now to get my head around setting up a raid 5 array for 3 x storage disks in 12.04 server.I have my Op Sys on 2 x ssd drives which i configured as raid one during the initial installation.When i attach the 3 staorage drive,the seerver wont boot.I am kind of stuck,any help?
2012-06-14T23:44:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	that was probably not me - but I didn't quite understand your problem now: di you configure the 3 HD as raid array already?
2012-06-14T23:46:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	i have done it a few time with mdadm but it did not work properly.I have since remove the 3 drives and deleted the partitions by using a usb caddie attached a windows pc but i think there must be some remnant of the old array still on the disks
2012-06-14T23:51:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	I was searching, somewhere I stumbled upon a command to remove any raid entries from a HD - but I have not been successful yet
2012-06-14T23:52:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	<hop5uk> how do yopu get to a point where you can type in the commend when the system wont boot?
2012-06-14T23:54:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	(I'm only guessing right now): did you try to change the boot order? did you try with only one of those disks attached?
2012-06-14T23:55:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	yes i have tried that
2012-06-14T23:56:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	in that case it actually did boot - what about the recovery system?
2012-06-14T23:57:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	If i remove the storage disks the system boots correctly
2012-06-14T23:58:00.000Z	guntbert	hop5uk	sorry, I'm going to leave you to B0g4r7, my mind is too slow today - Good luck :-)
2012-06-14T23:58:00.000Z	hop5uk	guntbert	thanks anyway
