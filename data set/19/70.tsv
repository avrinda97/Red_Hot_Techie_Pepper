2012-10-18T10:20:00.000Z	cheesytiger		hello all. I am thinking of using Ubuntu and need some questions answered. I would like to instal Ubuntu, but I don't have a  discrete graphics card (I have an Intel integrated graphics card). I really don't need a 3D desktop like Unity. Is it possible to install Ubuntu but have a 2D desktop?

2012-10-18T10:20:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	thanks. i went with a basic laptop (not a high-end one)  for budget reasons
2012-10-18T10:21:00.000Z	SAKUJ0	cheesytiger	ram and cpu?
2012-10-18T10:21:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	what do you mean by up-to-date hardware?
2012-10-18T10:21:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	4 GB ram, and CPU is (how do i find out?)
2012-10-18T10:21:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	what command to run
2012-10-18T10:23:00.000Z	SAKUJ0	cheesytiger	just put in any live cd and you can test the system from there. you can test your '3d environment' by hitting window+s and windows+w - it should do some animated stuff
2012-10-18T10:23:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	i see. well, it's good to know that my computer can handle the 3D environment (I believe this is called Unity, right). but i still would like to know whether I can have a 2D desktop instead, just in case?
2012-10-18T10:24:00.000Z	SAKUJ0	cheesytiger	it gets removed *today* with the release of the next ubuntu
2012-10-18T10:26:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	ok. what about Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS. What are the 2D desktop options? (By the way, my CPU is Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU        P6200  @ 2.13GHz)
2012-10-18T10:27:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	i see your other lines to me
2012-10-18T10:27:00.000Z	SAKUJ0	cheesytiger	in the login screen you can (maybe you need to install a package for it but i think it was not necessary) the option to boot Unity 2d
2012-10-18T10:27:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	i didn't see them initially because you did not type my nickname in them, and thus were not highlighted by my xchat program
2012-10-18T10:29:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	i do plan on using another monitor with my laptop
2012-10-18T10:30:00.000Z	SAKUJ0	cheesytiger	things could get worse there but pretty sure it will be ok
2012-10-18T10:31:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	i don't follow. What things could get worse? Worse than what?
2012-10-18T10:35:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	 sorry, i don't understand your last line (On 1 screen at a time).
2012-10-18T10:35:00.000Z	cheesytiger	SAKUJ0	i want to test out a multimonitor setup. What do you mean by "on 1 screen at a time"?
