2007-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	Marupa		is there a way to mount an sftp directory?
2007-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 use nautilus-connect-server
2007-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	Marupa	unop	 I mean so I can read it in Kate.
2007-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 ohh, you're using kde .. i have no idea then
2007-02-10T10:12:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 nautilus-connect-server it is then
2007-02-10T10:13:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	well, it mouonts remote shares locally .. so any applications should see files in those shares locally
2007-02-10T10:14:00.000Z	Marupa	unop	freakabcd:  where is it mounted in the FS?
2007-02-10T10:14:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 thats what you specify in "connect to server"
2007-02-10T10:16:00.000Z	Marupa	unop	 I'm not sure I understand.
2007-02-10T10:18:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 hold up, i'm trying this out here :)
2007-02-10T10:27:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 looks like i overlooked the fact you could not mount a sftp/ssh location locally .. but i found this http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html
2007-02-10T10:27:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 or a discussion about this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=270806
2007-02-10T10:31:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 id  or groups
2007-02-10T10:39:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 does the remote location have to be mounted on the file system ?? because if you use nautilus-connect-server to connect a a location -- you then have a location in gnome/gnome_vfs that most gnome compatible applications (like gedit) can access
2007-02-10T10:40:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 i find nautilus-connect-server works a charm too -- without the pain of fuse/sshfs
2007-02-10T10:41:00.000Z	Marupa	unop	 nautilus-connect-server doesn't allow stuff like kate, textedit or whatever (or even a console) to surf the mounted share.
2007-02-10T10:42:00.000Z	Marupa	unop	 Click that link I sent a bit ago.  It's the only way to do it.  Trust me.
2007-02-10T10:43:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	 it's not the only way -- there's a couple and i'm interested in the way that requires the least being installed
2007-02-10T10:43:00.000Z	unop	Marupa	what i mean is - it's still 4 things
