2005-09-29T13:46:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	(un)rar, possibly the nonfree version
2005-09-29T13:56:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	then you need to enable universe/multiverse
2005-09-29T13:58:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	have you used synaptic yet? that's a graphical tool for package management
2005-09-29T13:58:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	you should use that to enable the universe/multiverse repositories. After that you can search for unrar (using either apt-cache or synaptic)
2005-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	I never use synaptic, but I think there's a menu called "repositories" or something like that
2005-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	then enable universe and multiverse and update the package list
2005-09-29T14:18:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	were you looking for unrar? then type that in the search bar
2005-09-29T14:38:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	unless you are up to no good, you dont need it...
2005-09-29T14:40:00.000Z	JDahl	matrix	there are debian packages for tor/privoxy etc., so should be as easy to install as any other package
