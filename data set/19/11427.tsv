2006-01-26T09:19:00.000Z	dusk		question: what will I have to know about unbuntu coming off debian
2006-01-26T09:20:00.000Z	dusk		apt-get install dapper
2006-01-26T09:21:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	you should know that Dapper is much less stable than a debian "unstable" release... that's all
2006-01-26T09:21:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	in other words, don't upgrade to it and cry if it breaks
2006-01-26T09:21:00.000Z	dusk	anavim	what are the levels of stability in ubunty, and how can I tell them apart
2006-01-26T09:21:00.000Z	dusk	anavim	i dont cry, i like it when things break, i learn more that way
2006-01-26T09:21:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	there's stable and unstable, dapper being the only unstable
2006-01-26T09:22:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	me too  :D
2006-01-26T09:22:00.000Z	dusk	anavim	and dapper is even more bleeding edge than sid?
2006-01-26T09:22:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	I don't know much about sid, it won't install on my pc  :(
2006-01-26T09:22:00.000Z	dusk	anavim	and im assuming the current stable release is 10x more relevant to sarge
2006-01-26T09:23:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	huh?
2006-01-26T09:23:00.000Z	dusk	anavim	i just want a nice excuse to reformat my linux partition and put ubuntu on.
2006-01-26T09:23:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	hehe
2006-01-26T09:24:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	nubuntu makes a good excuse  :)
2006-01-26T09:26:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	oh, it is a liveCD...
2006-01-26T09:26:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	might help you get a taste for ubuntu before installing then, dunno
2006-01-26T09:33:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	the combination of wide hardware support and debian apt utilities make ubuntu pretty nice
2006-01-26T09:35:00.000Z	anavim	dusk	I used to swear at it
