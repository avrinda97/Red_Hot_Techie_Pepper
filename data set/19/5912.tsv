2008-04-18T17:03:00.000Z	Dewitt		How do I install Windows XP and Ubuntu together on one drive but different partitions?
2008-04-18T17:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	Do you have windows installed now
2008-04-18T17:04:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	nope, nothing is installed yet
2008-04-18T17:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	Install windows.. but create a partition that is smaller than the total size of your dirve...  once done insert the ubuntu cd and boot it and tell it to use all unallocated space and it will do the rest
2008-04-18T17:07:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	can you tell me how it will work, Grub will load windows? I will have two partitions - first for Ubuntu(ext3) and second - for Windows(NTFS)
2008-04-18T17:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	correct, grub will give you the option of windows or ubuntu, you can also select a default or either if you wish
2008-04-18T17:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	I have dual booted for years.. quite easy
2008-04-18T17:09:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	I just wanted some technical details, like how it works, where are ntldr and boot.ini to be located?
2008-04-18T17:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	they will stay put on the first partition
2008-04-18T17:09:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	Is there a way to remove any traces of Windows from first partition?
2008-04-18T17:10:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	abd load windows manually
2008-04-18T17:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	the first 512k on the mbr will point to grub on the ext3 of the ub install which will pick up your windows install.
2008-04-18T17:10:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	512k ??? kilobytes?
2008-04-18T17:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	bytes.. sorry
2008-04-18T17:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	force of habit
2008-04-18T17:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	perhaps you should explain more about what you are trying to accomplish
2008-04-18T17:12:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	:) ok, I guess I should first install both OS and then be asking questions so as not ask too much :)
2008-04-18T17:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dewitt	if you dont want people to know you have a windows partition, you could set the grub timer to 1 and even rename the menu option so that only hitting escape on boot would bring up a menu that still would not say windows
2008-04-18T17:13:00.000Z	Dewitt	Jack_Sparrow	Ok, thanks for tips. Lemme see the thing.
