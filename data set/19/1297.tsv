2011-03-08T03:55:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		I think that when I had a power cut, it corrupted the data on the hard drive
2011-03-08T03:56:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		I need a way to format the Hard Drive, I cannot enter the live CD or Enter Ubuntu
2011-03-08T03:56:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		how can I do it?
2011-03-08T03:58:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		Well, it starts, then it freezes as it reads the hard drive
2011-03-08T03:58:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		thus leading me to believe the the Drive may be corrupted and stopping the Install
2011-03-08T04:00:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		Ok, I'll try
2011-03-08T04:01:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		I think it is the Hard Drive, not the memory
2011-03-08T04:03:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		when trying to boot, it says "Cannot read 'blah blah blah'
2011-03-08T04:04:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		or whatever it is...
2011-03-08T04:05:00.000Z	christhecoolboy		it says... Mount: Mounting /Dev on /root/dev failed: No Such file or Directory
2011-03-08T04:05:00.000Z	ryuujin	christhecoolboy	who says it? /Dev is not a device and so you cannot mount it
2011-03-08T04:07:00.000Z	ryuujin	christhecoolboy	fidsk -l ? paste me the output
2011-03-08T04:07:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	ryuujin	I cant?
2011-03-08T04:08:00.000Z	ryuujin	christhecoolboy	but I think that on boot you don'e enter ubuntu, but a Busybox console... don't you?
2011-03-08T04:10:00.000Z	ryuujin	christhecoolboy	please, try to search on the forum because there is surely a topic on how to restore ubuntu with such kind of error. Now I'm trying to find for you too
2011-03-08T04:11:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	ryuujin	I thought the whole point of an Ubuntu chat room was to enter it and get help from other Ubuntu Geeks who know about Computers more than I, no offense...
2011-03-08T04:12:00.000Z	ryuujin	christhecoolboy	you're right, but now I can't help you... but I'm sure there are topics can help you better. Such as: http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1568704
2011-03-08T04:13:00.000Z	christhecoolboy	ryuujin	dont you think I've tried that, with the shift key?
