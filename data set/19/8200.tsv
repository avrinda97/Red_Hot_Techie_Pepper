2007-04-24T09:33:00.000Z	stickybit`		Supaplex:
2007-04-24T09:33:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	it is not an error, it just means that you weren't in hibernate mode when you booted up
2007-04-24T09:33:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	: there is often system crash
2007-04-24T09:34:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	well the kinit message is not an error
2007-04-24T09:34:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	i just checked out ubuntuforums.org
2007-04-24T09:35:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	: 20 pages with same problem without any solution
2007-04-24T09:35:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	regarding that error messagE?
2007-04-24T09:35:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	: and the problem is with 7.04 only
2007-04-24T09:35:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	: yeah
2007-04-24T09:36:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	i don't think that is the problem -- the resume image refers to a hibernate image
2007-04-24T09:37:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	: do you use feisty
2007-04-24T09:37:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	yes
2007-04-24T09:37:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	without any  problems?
2007-04-24T09:37:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	no problems

2007-04-24T09:41:00.000Z	eck	stickybit`	i have the same message printed to tty1 and it doesn't hang for me
2007-04-24T09:42:00.000Z	stickybit`	eck	i am very dissappointed with feisty.... dapper and edgy are good
