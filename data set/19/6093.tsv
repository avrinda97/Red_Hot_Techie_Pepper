2008-03-17T02:14:00.000Z	ronandi		idk, I can just use alt f2 anyway
2008-03-17T02:15:00.000Z	ronandi		but, what the best audio player out there for linux? on windows I was using foobar2000, and winamp
2008-03-17T02:16:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	there are a few choices... the most popular are Rhythmbox, Amarok, and XMMS
2008-03-17T02:17:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	rhythmbox is a lot like itunes, if you're familiar with it. I find it very intuitive and simple. Amarok is a bit jumbled for my taste, but perhaps I'm just not used to it
2008-03-17T02:19:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	oh my god are you one of those computer newbies who uses like 800x600 on a 20" monitor cause it "makes the icons bigger" ?
2008-03-17T02:21:00.000Z	ronandi	silent_	no... not at all... Im one of those pplz who built there own comp and has an 8800(I only mention b/c of the lack of support). I've always used my native res: 1680x1050
2008-03-17T02:22:00.000Z	ronandi	silent_	lol...
2008-03-17T02:22:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	hehe, alright, you'll probably want to change the appearance settings then... have you tried kde 4? or just 3?
2008-03-17T02:24:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	oh! you can also run foobar2000 in wine if you really want... but I find rhythmbox far superior to fb
2008-03-17T02:26:00.000Z	ronandi	silent_	lol, im not sure which kde I was using... probably the latest... and I cant change my appearance settings, because the text is so small thats its completely illegible. Unless someone can give me some terminal commands to change them
2008-03-17T02:27:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	no, unfortunately I don't have much experience with that... however you can change your default x mode to use a lower resolution temporarily to change the fonts
2008-03-17T02:28:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	in xorg.conf
2008-03-17T02:32:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	there are a couple options, you can use gdesklets
2008-03-17T02:32:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	and there was another, but I can't remember it, it's not included in the repositories
2008-03-17T02:33:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	do you mean adding things to your taskbar?
2008-03-17T02:34:00.000Z	ronandi	silent_	both on to desktop, and taskbar. I oced my computer, so some temp meters would be good
2008-03-17T02:34:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	http://linux4world.blogspot.com/2007/10/top-8-widget-engines-for-linux-platform.html
2008-03-17T02:34:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	a combination of gnome panel apps and some sort of widgets/desklets app will do the trick
2008-03-17T02:35:00.000Z	silent_	ronandi	play around with things, that's the great thing about linux, there's lots of choice
