2011-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	yagoo		nways.. nmind that..
2011-09-15T09:35:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	That's what I'm doing, presently.
2011-09-15T09:25:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	you know how to check if its already loaded?
2011-09-15T09:25:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	I just installed it myself to resolve only getting 10Mb/s speeds, and I'd like to package it for others, so they don't run into the same issue.
2011-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	?
2011-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	package what?
2011-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	??
2011-09-15T09:27:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	My initial question was regarding how I might package a driver and have it added to the Ubuntu repo.
2011-09-15T09:27:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	what is the source? maybe provide a reportbug feedback to somewhere would be helpful
2011-09-15T09:28:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	Actually, that's a good idea. Perhaps I'll open a bug for the Linux kernel? I think that's generally where device drivers should land, yes?
2011-09-15T09:29:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	you can try reportingbug on kernel package i guess
2011-09-15T09:32:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	did u even check to see if there's a jmicron module? (find /lib/modules |grep -i jmic)
2011-09-15T09:32:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	It's called "jme"
2011-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	sometimes u can pass parameters to modules (modinfo <modulename>)
2011-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	As I say, I'm not personally having any problems with it. I was looking to see whether it could be updated in the Linux kernel, or perhaps as a separate package in the Ubuntu repo, in order to resolve this problem for others.
2011-09-15T09:34:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	I know you're asking a fair question. But it sounds like you don't know the system well enough to attack a kernel problem.. which is why i was asking about what particular problem it is
2011-09-15T09:34:00.000Z	FrozenFire	yagoo	Believe me, I do.
2011-09-15T09:35:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	did u try checking to see if this was fixed with linux.org's latest?
2011-09-15T09:35:00.000Z	yagoo	FrozenFire	i mean kernel.org's latest
