2008-03-22T03:26:00.000Z	woddf2		Hello
2008-03-22T03:27:00.000Z	woddf2		I just installed GNOME after KDE, and the widgets look like my KDE theme, even in GTK applications!
2008-03-22T03:28:00.000Z	woddf2		I just installed GNOME after KDE, and the widgets look like my KDE theme, even in GTK applications!
2008-03-22T03:28:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	so what is the problem?
2008-03-22T03:29:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	I just installed GNOME after KDE, and the widgets look like my KDE theme, even in GTK applications!
2008-03-22T03:29:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	my question is still "What is the problem with that?" You can change your gnome and gtk theme at Preferences/Appearance
2008-03-22T03:30:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	That does not work.
2008-03-22T03:31:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	you know you can install new themes, right?
2008-03-22T03:32:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	Yes, but that will probably not solve the problem.
2008-03-22T03:32:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	well unless you try, you will never know
2008-03-22T03:42:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	Appearance Preferences freezes when I click Install!
2008-03-22T03:43:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	it's possible you tried to install a theme without having the appropriate theme engine installed
2008-03-22T03:45:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	The file chooser freezes.
2008-03-22T03:46:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	that happens if you don't have the appropriate them engine installed. I hope that when you installed gnome you installed ubuntu-desktop instead of the deprecated 2.18 gnome install in the repos
2008-03-22T03:46:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	I installed ubuntu-desktop.
2008-03-22T03:47:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	some themes require gtk engines to render correctly. if you do not have them installed, the themes will not be installed
2008-03-22T03:47:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	try installing themes from synaptic and testing them out in the appearance properties
2008-03-22T03:49:00.000Z	woddf2	jeffMASTERflex	I launched Synaptic, and root's widgets look fine! It must be my account...
2008-03-22T03:50:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	woddf2	i THINK there is an option in kcontrol to use kde widgets in GTK applications. look around though
