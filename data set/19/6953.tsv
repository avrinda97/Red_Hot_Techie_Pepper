2007-12-03T16:43:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	how did you update alsa
2007-12-03T16:44:00.000Z	kakoonia	ikonia	i downloaded alsa-drivers from alsa-project 1.0.15, configure | make | make install
2007-12-03T16:44:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	thats not the best call, as now your package manager will be out of sync
2007-12-03T16:45:00.000Z	kakoonia	ikonia	: because i installed package thats out of the available package list?
2007-12-03T16:48:00.000Z	kakoonia	ikonia	: because i installed package thats out of the available package list? and what should i do to fix it? should i make uninstall?
2007-12-03T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	on planet earth we call them "speakers"
2007-12-03T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	yes, some hardware does do that and you have to mute teh internal speakers
2007-12-03T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	eg: plug headphones into a PC and it still comes out of the speakers
2007-12-03T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	disable the speakers then
2007-12-03T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	kakoonia	in alsa mixer
