2009-09-09T01:26:00.000Z	Tamale		can anyone here help me troubleshoot my random freezes on Jaunty?
2009-09-09T01:27:00.000Z	durt	Tamale	it's better if you ask specific technical questions rather than for help, not too many people want to hand hold.
2009-09-09T01:27:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	understood, but I don't even know where to begin. Nothing is showing up in var/log/messages
2009-09-09T01:28:00.000Z	durt	Tamale	start with hardware. mem check etc.
2009-09-09T01:28:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	everything checks out
2009-09-09T01:28:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	I have no problems when I boot into CentOS
2009-09-09T01:30:00.000Z	durt	Tamale	then figure out what is different, video card wise, kernel wise. the big stuff, then to applications. What are you doing when it freezes etc.
2009-09-09T01:30:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	Sometimes I'm not doing anything.. that's what's so weird.  Shouldn't there be something some log?
2009-09-09T01:31:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	I only know of dmesg and var/log/messages.. are there other logs to check?
2009-09-09T01:31:00.000Z	durt	Tamale	not if it's a total crash, sounds like video to me, what card? what drivers?
2009-09-09T01:32:00.000Z	Tamale		nvidia
2009-09-09T01:32:00.000Z	durt	Tamale	same driver version as CentOS?
2009-09-09T01:32:00.000Z	Tamale		yeah, that's a good one to check.  i'll look into that
2009-09-09T01:32:00.000Z	Tamale		thanks!
2009-09-09T01:33:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	i actually have an ati card, and it's using the nvidia driver
2009-09-09T01:33:00.000Z	Tamale		that's amazing is compiz is working
2009-09-09T01:34:00.000Z	durt	Tamale	I have never heard of that.
2009-09-09T01:34:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	 I used to have an nvidia card in this system.  Now it's an ati
2009-09-09T01:34:00.000Z	Tamale	durt	I forgot about that
