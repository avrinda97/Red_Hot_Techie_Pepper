2010-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	that was only if you didn't have libdvdcss installed (the medibuntu bug stuff) but if it's already installed that shouldn't be the problem
2010-04-20T09:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	if you have mplayer installed what/if any output are you getting if you run "mplayer dvd://1"

2010-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	arooni_____		i already have the libdvdcss2 installed
2010-04-20T09:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	the important part there is "libdvdread: Encrypted DVD support unavailable."
2010-04-20T09:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	looking like you might need medibuntu still...
2010-04-20T09:42:00.000Z	arooni_____	ZykoticK9	but if i do 'sudo aptitude install libdvdcss2' i see http://pastebin.com/tUDijLPy
2010-04-20T09:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	important part there is "No candidate version found for libdvdcss2" -- if you run "apt-cache policy libdvdcss2" does it show an installed version?
2010-04-20T09:44:00.000Z	arooni_____	ZykoticK9	shows none for all entries
2010-04-20T09:44:00.000Z	arooni_____	ZykoticK9	should i follow instructions you sent? bout mediaubuntu?
2010-04-20T09:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	it's NOT installed - thus your problem
2010-04-20T09:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	i've gotten conflicting reports about the workaround not working and the repos being empty, but it might be worth a shot!?
2010-04-20T09:45:00.000Z	arooni_____	ZykoticK9	once i have those new sources set up ; i do suto apt-get install libdvdcss2 ?
2010-04-20T09:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	yup
2010-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	arooni_____	assuming suto was just a typo for sudo ;)
2010-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	arooni_____	ZykoticK9	ok installed it ;  movie plyayer plays it !!! WOOT!
2010-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	arooni_____	ZykoticK9	UBUNTU FTW!
