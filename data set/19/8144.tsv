2008-10-20T06:53:00.000Z	Don		please help, must be someone here with definate answer to fix /etc/resolv.conf missing in kppp
2008-10-20T06:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	you'll need to explain the problem, please.
2008-10-20T06:55:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	and is it?
2008-10-20T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	did kppp ask you for any dns servers?
2008-10-20T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	do you know your isp's dns servers?
2008-10-20T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	how are you connected to the internet now?
2008-10-20T06:57:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	so you're using linux to connect to a remote vista?
2008-10-20T06:58:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	okay - glad we cleared that up.
2008-10-20T06:58:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	now, what dns servers did it give you in vista?
2008-10-20T06:59:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	auto will always 'automatically' give you dns servers. clearly you don't know how to check. please open a command prompt and type this:  ipconfig /all   it will tell you the dns servers.
2008-10-20T07:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	do you want help or do you want to keep chasing your tail?
2008-10-20T07:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	i have just explained to you the first step you need to take. if you are unwilling to work with anyone in here on this, then you are unwilling to connect via dialup using ubuntu.
2008-10-20T07:02:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	then you and i have nothing further to talk about.
2008-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	does this look like the linux mint support channel?
2008-12-10T03:45:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	have you tried making a usb startup disk?
2008-12-10T03:47:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	do you have any important data residing on your ubuntu install?
2008-12-10T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	your best bet, if you can, is to reinstall and try again - if you have a thumbdrive, you can make a usb startup disk with the System->Administration menu in order to help bail you out of this type of situation - if you have any files yet to be backed up, you should be able to get them out of your ~/Desktop or wherever they are onto a thumbdrive
2008-12-10T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	please keep the chatter to the channel, it will make it easier for others to help you
2008-12-10T03:55:00.000Z	Gnea	Don	that's why i asked if you had any important files on your system (email, documents, pictures, movies, etc) because the best way to fix it is to reinstall
