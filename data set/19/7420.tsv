2007-09-03T13:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		if I wish to format and mount a hd as reserfs, do i need to give it swap memory even knowing it will only be used for storage?

2007-09-03T13:27:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	Swap is for extending the memory, you don't need it for storage.
2007-09-03T13:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	nbkr	ok so i can just use the hd as reserfs and not assign any swap memory to it? i dont plan on running files from it only pure backup/storage
2007-09-03T13:29:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	Yes, you don't need swap on every harddisk.
2007-09-03T13:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	nbkr	thanx, now im going to install Xubuntu, im just wondering if it is possible to mount an ubuntu partition to it with both OS conflicting as it happened before when I tried
2007-09-03T13:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	nbkr	*without
2007-09-03T13:32:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	You can mount the Ubuntu disks after booting without problems, but you should avoid to use the Ubuntu / as / of Xubuntu.
2007-09-03T13:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		is it possible to mount to different ubuntu
2007-09-03T13:33:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	It depends. If you just want to access the data on the Ubuntu drives. No problem. If you want to use the data as essential part of the Xubuntu system: Might be a problem.
2007-09-03T13:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	nbkr	are you saying I shouldn't try & mount xubuntu inside ubuntu, is that right? if it is I dont see how both cna conflict especially since I wont be running both at the same time
2007-09-03T13:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	nbkr	hmmm where are you? could you please answer my question
2007-09-03T13:36:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	Its hard to explain on IRC. Generaly: If you install Xubuntu and Ubuntu in a dual boot system, you should have any problem. But if you try to use the partion where Ubuntu has it /-Filesystem on as /-Filesystem of Xubuntu that can cause problems.
2007-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	If you just mount the Ubuntu-Partions on /mnt of the Xubuntu-System - you can access the data without any problems.
2007-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	nbkr	kk np will install it now and delete sdb1 partition as well as swap file, thanx for the help
2007-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	nbkr	Pirate_Hunter	*shouldn't have any problem
