2010-01-11T20:59:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Good afternoon.  I have installed GAP, the animation Tool for gimp, but cannot find how to launch it.  I cannot find it anywhere in GIMP, in the Applications Menu, or launch it from command line.
2010-01-11T21:01:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		The tutorial, http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Using_GAP/ doesn't really explain how to start GAP.  Or access it.  It assume it magically appears.
2010-01-11T21:01:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	should appear in plugins
2010-01-11T21:01:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	Nice one, cheers.
2010-01-11T21:04:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	I can't find GAP in the GIMP plugin browser.  Is that the right place to look?
2010-01-11T21:04:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	afaik yes
2010-01-11T21:05:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	Downer.  Doesn't seem to have installed properly.
2010-01-11T21:05:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	sudo aptitude reinstall gimp-gap
2010-01-11T21:07:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	Still no joy.  Any recommendation on a GUI based GIF animation tool that works?
2010-01-11T21:07:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	nope
2010-01-11T21:07:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	No worries, thanks for your help :)
2010-01-11T21:14:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	convert from imagemagick may help
2010-01-11T21:15:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	Cheers
2010-01-11T21:24:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	I'm sorry, I can't find imagemagick on my desktop either, even though synaptic reckons it's installed.
2010-01-11T21:25:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	Highly frustrating.  I just want a simple GUI gif anim editor without having to go find a windows box to do it on
2010-01-11T21:25:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	it's just a collection of tools, one is "convert" commandline
2010-01-11T21:25:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	llutz	Ah, darn.  No GUI alternative?
2010-01-11T21:26:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	nothing i know of, but graphics isn't my favorite thing
2010-01-11T21:27:00.000Z	llutz	FunkyWeasel	won't help you, but i never said: "linux to all desktops" :)
