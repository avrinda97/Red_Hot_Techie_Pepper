2012-07-26T22:56:00.000Z	Amy_		Would anyone like to help me fix Ubuntu 11.10? I just installed it, and it only loads the "waiting for network configuration screen", then it goes black. Any help is very much appreciated!!
2012-07-26T22:56:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	why didn't you go for the newer release?
2012-07-26T22:57:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	I'm a total noob and it's for a class. I didn't know a newer one was available. using it on vmware vSphere
2012-07-26T22:58:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	can I suggest version 12.04  -  there were a number of improvements in that version.
2012-07-26T22:59:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	I've been trying to fix it myself, and have read that 12.04 is much better
2012-07-26T23:01:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	If I was you, first thing I would do is get 12.04 and start from there. Secondly, what do you see in ifconfig -a
2012-07-26T23:04:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	just interested in interface name and IP
2012-07-26T23:07:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	I don't see a name or ip address when i typed in ifconfig -a
2012-07-26T23:08:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	then you probably don't have a virtual interface configured in VMWare.  Go into VMWare and check the settings you have for you virtual NIc - what do u have?
2012-07-26T23:15:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	under the hardware tab in my vm properties for ubuntu, it says "network adapter 1: invalid backing"
2012-07-26T23:17:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	u have a known VMWare issue - I'm just looking up the answer on VMWARE.
2012-07-26T23:17:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	thank you so much. i've been pulling my hair out looking for answers on there
2012-07-26T23:18:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	You need to assign permissions to the virtual switch - check that.
2012-07-26T23:18:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	Virtua switch in VMWare I mean.
2012-07-26T23:19:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	check Inventory->Networking. You may have forgotten to assign them permissions to the switch.
2012-07-26T23:20:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	If you don't have permissions to change the VMswitch config in VMWare, I would recommend you speak to whoever manages that VMHost.
2012-07-26T23:20:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	i don't have permissions
2012-07-26T23:21:00.000Z	Amy_	njaxx	thank you very much for the help anyway!
2012-07-26T23:21:00.000Z	njaxx	Amy_	No problem, as soon as you get your virtual environment sorted, boot Ubuntu again and we can take it from there. Basically your Virtual Ubuntu does not have a working NIC at the moment.
