2012-05-31T17:26:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	on it already  :P
2012-05-31T17:26:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	Could be that the nameserver you are using is defective.  Just try another.
2012-05-31T17:26:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	Or, yes, could be blocked, but try another and see.
2012-05-31T17:26:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	try 8.8.8.8
2012-05-31T17:27:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	testing 8.8.8.8
2012-05-31T17:27:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	host av.com
2012-05-31T17:28:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	What is listed in /etc/resolv.conf ?
2012-05-31T17:28:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	av.com does not resolve...
2012-05-31T17:29:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	just this:  nameserver 8.8.8.8
2012-05-31T17:30:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	What is the port for nameservers?  Port 50?  Run nmap and see if you get a repsonse from port 52
2012-05-31T17:32:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	nmap -p 53 8.8.8.8
2012-05-31T17:33:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	nmap -p53 10.9.1.4
2012-05-31T17:40:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	8.8.8.8 doesnt resolve either...  i keep getting connection timed out.. no servers could be reached
2012-05-31T17:42:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	What does nmap -p53 8.8.8  say?
2012-05-31T17:42:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	What does   nmap -p53 10.9.1.4   say?
2012-05-31T17:46:00.000Z	vfw	defunkt	I would suppose that something on your network is blocking nameserver's port.
2012-05-31T17:47:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	this happens even when im plugged into the same switch... the same 10.04 install on another laptop next to me does not have the issue...
2012-05-31T17:48:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	thanks for the help tho...
2012-05-31T17:57:00.000Z	defunkt	vfw	i found that i cannot ping anything in the 10.9.0.X range even though they are in the same subnet
