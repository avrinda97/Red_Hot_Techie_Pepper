2010-02-04T20:46:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	sure what's your problem?
2010-02-04T20:49:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	Did you setup the wine repository as explained on winehq.org?

2010-02-04T20:57:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	Do you have some wine pakages already installed?
2010-02-04T20:58:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	use synaptic and search for wine
2010-02-04T21:02:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	do you have the wine repo in the application- source list?

2010-02-04T21:10:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	I'm not 100% sure because I've german menues :/
2010-02-04T21:14:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	remove the repo and paste this into a shell sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/karmic.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list
2010-02-04T21:15:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	Fauntix	after you've ran that command run sudo apt-get update and then you should be able to install wine using apt-get install wine
