2008-07-19T22:33:00.000Z	CartoonCat		Hello. Is there a 'pain free' way of moving from Debian Etch to Ubuntu (or Kubuntu)
2008-07-19T22:33:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	because of some package diffrences, it could be quite difficult.. and the livecd method will erase you data...
2008-07-19T22:34:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	the best method is to backup your data, delete everything from a fresh install from a livecd and put your stuff pack
2008-07-19T22:34:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	do you have a seperate /home paritions?
2008-07-19T22:36:00.000Z	CartoonCat	superfirelord42	nope, so its going to be painful. I hate having to get out the backup hd is all.
2008-07-19T22:36:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	sorry, i guess so...
2008-07-19T22:36:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	there is one other way.. but its more painfull
2008-07-19T22:37:00.000Z	CartoonCat	superfirelord42	we might have diffrent ideas of painful, what ya got
2008-07-19T22:37:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	in hte live cd, resize your partions, add a /home partition, transfer data, then install... that would transfer youre /home data without using a backup disk
2008-07-19T22:38:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	but unless you *really* dont want to get out your backup disk... thats probably harder...
2008-07-19T22:42:00.000Z	CartoonCat	superfirelord42	well the issue is that the backups are miles away (and its a holiday weekend here). Maybe ill just wait till next week, im getting a 1tb usb backpack drive for the laptop
2008-07-19T22:43:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	hehe, i want a TB usb drive, im still on a 512... yeah, think your best route it is to wait...
2008-07-19T22:44:00.000Z	CartoonCat	superfirelord42	buy.com special for 150
2008-07-19T22:44:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	realy? cool, i will have to look at that, anyways, we are ot....
2008-07-19T22:51:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	it does, but sometimes, computers choose not to obey the bootloader
2008-07-19T22:52:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	and since a 1TB USB is newer, its more likly to have troubles with the bios
2008-07-19T22:53:00.000Z	CartoonCat	superfirelord42	I wont be using the TB for booting, its for media storage for the laptop when I travel.
2008-07-19T22:54:00.000Z	superfirelord42	CartoonCat	then it should work if your comptuer supports it... i have used alot of bootable distros, they generally work great, then you will have one or two computers, that choose not to read it...
2008-07-19T22:56:00.000Z	CartoonCat	superfirelord42	thats fine, it will just be used on this box (I realy should nuke everything on this one anyhow, my storage method broke down and ive junk all over including 2 ntfs drives)
