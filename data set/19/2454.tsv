2011-04-14T01:56:00.000Z	jessicaBR		hey BluesKaj, I tried updating and upgrading apt-get and then tried aptg-get install nvidia-current, but it says I'm already using the newest version...
2011-04-14T01:58:00.000Z	forevertheuni	jessicaBR	you have ubuntu normal repo or another one?
2011-04-14T01:59:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	I remember adding other repositories to install gtk+3
2011-04-14T02:01:00.000Z	forevertheuni	jessicaBR	I use ubunt-x-swat it usually has the last version
2011-04-14T02:01:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	what is ubuntu-x-swat?
2011-04-14T02:03:00.000Z	forevertheuni	jessicaBR	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat
2011-04-14T02:04:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	this is where I got the repository for the gtk+3. Can that repository screw all my system? Should I remove the repositories? How can I do that?
2011-04-14T02:05:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	with "this" I mean launchpad
2011-04-14T02:05:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	everytime I launch ubuntu it sends me to console tty... X is not launched
2011-04-14T02:06:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	I just did that
2011-04-14T02:06:00.000Z	forevertheuni	jessicaBR	do you know the error?
2011-04-14T02:07:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	yes, it says "no screens found"
2011-04-14T02:07:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	before that I get (EE) No drivers available
2011-04-14T02:07:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	yes, in Xorg output, after doing startx
2011-04-14T02:09:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	should I move xorg.conf to where?
2011-04-14T02:12:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	I dont have that file in that path... :(
2011-04-14T02:13:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	I have xorg.conf.backup
2011-04-14T02:14:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	got this error: "FATAL: Module nvidia not found"
2011-04-14T02:22:00.000Z	jessicaBR	forevertheuni	I just installed as you said, and also tried to startx, and it seems it worked, but it didnt show me the login window... Instead of that, it opened a terminal window, but now I can see the mouse
