2007-08-04T16:45:00.000Z	retnuh	nickrud	what is X?
2007-08-04T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	retnuh	the software that provides the framework for your graphical desktop. If you have a desktop, X is running

2007-08-04T16:47:00.000Z	nickrud	retnuh	read. try less /var/log/Xorg.0.log in a terminal, or open it with gedit
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	retnuh	nickrud	I dont know what I am looking for in that log

2007-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	nickrud	retnuh	that WW was a warning that you had not explicitly defined the video card's slot, but X found it anyway

2007-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	retnuh	nickrud	Thank you so much for helping me out and taking a look at it.....
