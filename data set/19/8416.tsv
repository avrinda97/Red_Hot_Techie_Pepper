2007-06-04T09:24:00.000Z	shawn34		Help! just bought a new nvidia 8600GT now xserver wont start! I originally had an on board nvidia 6150le and everything was working fine
2007-06-04T09:25:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	afaik with that card you'll need to install the drivers yourself from nvidia.com but it isn't really supported by ubunut
2007-06-04T09:26:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	huh!? figures i spend all this money and it wont work
2007-06-04T09:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	i never said it wouldn't work
2007-06-04T09:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	and that card was released _after_ feisty released so there's not much we can do
2007-06-04T09:28:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	wasn't it the 8800 that came out after feisty, not the 8600?
2007-06-04T09:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	8600 came out after the 8800
2007-06-04T09:29:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	why is the 8800 like 400 dollars and the 8600 like 200 that doesn't make sense
2007-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	do I have to put the 8600 card on the board before I install the beta drivers? because when its in it takes over main display and I have no picture through on board card
2007-06-04T09:58:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	how long do you think until ubuntu/nvidia get the proper drivers for the 8600 up in the repositories?
2007-06-04T09:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	they'll be in gutsy
2007-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	so they wont be updating feisty with the proper drivers? thats a bummer. ;(
2007-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	when is gusty's official release?
2007-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	september
2007-06-04T12:10:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	i installed the beta drivers from nvidia, worked but had problems so I want to go back to main onboard card until i buy a 7-series nvidia card
2007-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	I uninstalled all references to nvidia via synaptic. then went to restricted drivers and had it install nvidia-glx and everything else it needed. switched xorg back to "nvidia" driver but its keeps crashing and x will not start
2007-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	can you help me please?
2007-06-04T12:12:00.000Z	PriceChild	shawn34	I'm not sure how to completely remove manually installed drivers (if you have to) I also haven't got a clue what the problem is as you haven't given me any error messages.
2007-12-20T02:14:00.000Z	shawn34	PriceChild	I can't move files to trash on my storage hd, this is my fstab: /dev/sdb1 /var/local/storage ext3 user,auto 0 2, any idea?
