2012-01-27T15:18:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	look up the Bash tutorials on tldp.org, they are quite good and I think you will enjoy them
2012-01-27T15:18:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	 Got it.
2012-01-27T15:19:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	np, http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/
2012-01-27T15:19:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	Thank you
2012-01-27T15:20:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	np :-) Enjoy bash, but be mindful of spaces and quotation marks. They will soon let you tear your hairs out ;-)
2012-01-27T15:20:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	 Have used it before. But only to get around. Have never done anything fancy.
2012-01-27T15:20:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	Have bookmarked that page, though.
2012-01-27T15:23:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	if you have downloaded something through wget it will be in the same directory as you issued the command from, unless you specifically told it to save it in another place.
2012-01-27T15:24:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	 Cool. Thank you for the information. When I do an 'ls -l' I don't see it, though. That's why I asked.
2012-01-27T15:25:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	tap the [up] key a few times, it should show you what you have typed previously, thus you will know where you downloaded something, [up arrow]  browses back in the bash history
2012-01-27T15:25:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	 Yes, familiar with tapping the 'up' key.
2012-01-27T15:28:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	that last reaction from metaspike was a rtfm, without the "f".
2012-01-27T15:28:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	Got it ;-)
2012-01-27T15:29:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	enjoy the power and richness of bash. Though sometimes, it will make you curse... ;-)
2012-01-27T15:29:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	It has many times...Time to get better at it.
2012-01-27T15:29:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	 Really appreciate your support!
2012-01-27T15:31:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	aLearner	well, that's the spirit! Just browse the general tutorials and if you hit a snag with bash, remember there is also #bash, but only after you have searched thoroughly for the answer...
2012-01-27T15:32:00.000Z	aLearner	Stereocaulon	Right. Thanks again.
