2011-06-21T04:22:00.000Z	westz		i'm working with a laptop with no cd drive, and a bios that doesnt support booting from usb. can make a partition with the installation media to reinstall from?
2011-06-21T04:22:00.000Z	velofille	westz	that would work
2011-06-21T04:23:00.000Z	westz	velofille	how would i go bout that?
2011-06-21T04:23:00.000Z	velofille	westz	you would need to remove the hdd , put it in usb caddy or similar to write an image
2011-06-21T04:24:00.000Z	velofille	westz	if you had windows or something installed you can use that, the ubuntu site has several ways documented on writing an image file to usb stick, do the same but use the partition
2011-06-21T04:24:00.000Z	velofille	westz	you would still need a boot loader to boot that though
2011-06-21T04:24:00.000Z	velofille	westz	better off putting the hdd into another machine, do the install, and move it back
2011-06-21T04:25:00.000Z	westz	velofille	i have a second laptop that has a cd drive tht i used to install ubuntu on this one. i wanted to know what i'd need to formt the recovery partition to
2011-06-21T04:25:00.000Z	westz	velofille	yeah thats what i've already done
2011-06-21T04:26:00.000Z	velofille	westz	always go for the easy option :D
2011-06-21T04:27:00.000Z	westz	velofille	i wanted to know wht to format the other partition to, and some documentation on adding the recovery imge to grumachine)b2 (accustomed to old grub as i use arch on my
2011-06-21T04:27:00.000Z	velofille	westz	you could make a small partition at the beginning but just so long as the boot load listed it which is the harder part if your bootloader is grub and thats rm -rf'd
2011-06-21T04:28:00.000Z	velofille	westz	maybe hda1 = /boot ,hda2 = recovery, hda3 = install ?
2011-06-21T04:29:00.000Z	velofille	westz	you would not format in any, just use the ubuntu disk image writer
2011-06-21T04:30:00.000Z	velofille	westz	create the partition, do not format it , apt-get install usb-imagewriter , use that

2011-06-21T04:33:00.000Z	velofille	westz	heh, use ubuntu config for it ? (unsure if there is one)
2011-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	westz	velofille	you here still?
