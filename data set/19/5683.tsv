2008-05-18T10:43:00.000Z	crille		Hello, I need some help,  how do I empty the trashbin?  there's no shortcut for it in the menus
2008-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	babolat	crille	create a new launcher on the desktop.
2008-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	babolat	crille	do you know how?
2008-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	crille	babolat	no mate, I dont
2008-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	crille	babolat	I mean, I know how to make a launcher, but I dont know what command to use
2008-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	babolat	crille	ok. on the desktop, right click and create launcher.. Type "Location"
2008-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	babolat	crille	then in Location, key in "trash:///" without the quotes
2008-05-18T10:46:00.000Z	crille	babolat	k, is that all?
2008-05-18T10:46:00.000Z	babolat	crille	yep.. try it now and see if it works
2008-05-18T10:47:00.000Z	crille	babolat	No such file or directory
2008-05-18T10:47:00.000Z	babolat	crille	it will also work if you dragged the launcher to your panel.. just in case, like me, your Trans icon in the panel mysteriously disappeared
2008-05-18T10:47:00.000Z	babolat		you sure you have trash:/// as the Location?
2008-05-18T10:48:00.000Z	crille	babolat	trash:///   yes sir
2008-05-18T10:48:00.000Z	babolat	crille	and the Launcher Type is "Location" right?
2008-05-18T10:49:00.000Z	crille		hmm, no, "command"
2008-05-18T10:49:00.000Z	babolat	crille	it needs to be "location"
2008-05-18T10:49:00.000Z	crille	babolat	oh, sorry,  didnt see that I could change that  ;)
2008-05-18T10:50:00.000Z	crille	babolat	there,  it works now, thanks a ot for the help mate
2008-05-18T10:50:00.000Z	babolat	crille	;)
