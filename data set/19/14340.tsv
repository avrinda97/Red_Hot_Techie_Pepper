2011-02-13T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 if the pacakges are installing..  is theres some other issue breaking things?
2011-02-13T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 they do work?
2011-02-13T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 when in doubt fall back to the command line.  it will give more detailed info/errors.
2011-02-13T12:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 i would start with opening a terminal, and try ing 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade'  and look for any errors
2011-02-13T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	getting back to the actual problem -->  i would start with opening a terminal, and try ing 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade'  and look for any errors
2011-02-13T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 the gui package manager tools may have some quirky bugs you are seeing. i rarely use them.
2011-02-13T12:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 theres no need to flood us with  common 'no problem' type messages..
2011-02-13T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 if the update and upgrade dont give any errors. try installing somthing 'sudo apt-get install cheese' (for example)
2011-03-26T22:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rajvi	 if it installed to a directory in your users home.. delete that directory,.
