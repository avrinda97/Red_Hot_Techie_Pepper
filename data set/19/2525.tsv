2010-05-18T06:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	what about 802.1x authentication, where that is passed from the router to your server.
2010-05-18T06:47:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	would you know if the dhcp services on ubuntu or dd-wrt would fall under the umbrella of active directory authenticated through the use of a RADIUS server?
2010-05-18T06:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	I woudl have to look into that, but you definately need to coordinate dhcp, ldap - radius should be able to do that.
2010-05-18T06:50:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	i have been looking all day for a reference to it..but no luck so far...
2010-05-18T06:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	heh, I gat that backwards, radius would have ldap as the backend :)
2010-05-18T06:52:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	got one more question any recommendations on which gnu radius server to use preferably one with a gui (this is going to be impossibly hard I would guess)
2010-05-18T06:53:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	let me get it straight first - you want to be able to authenticate wifi clients against DS(LDAP) and hand IP addresses that you can track to authenticated clients, right?
2010-05-18T06:54:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	no simply want to get an open (dd-wrt or ubuntu dhcp server ) authorized in windows active directory (its a requirement or Remote Installation Services)
2010-05-18T06:56:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	I see, that means you need your *nix server and or dd-wrt box to be able to join an existing AD domain - there's a puzzle.
2010-05-18T06:59:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	what's wrong with this? http://andrewbevitt.com/tutorials/dd-wrt-radius-authentication-w-server-2008-r2/
2010-05-18T07:03:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	It doesnt seem like radius is included in the enterprise edition of 2003 (its a separate product I dont have ) but setup another win2k8 vm for it...hmm thats an idea, then i could keep the nix dhcp server.
2010-05-18T07:04:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	now you're thinking!
2010-05-18T07:05:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	thanks I will go with that i think!
2010-05-18T07:06:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	I will let yo know how it goes!
2010-05-18T07:06:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	nice, good luck - as long as you can keep things coordinated you should be fine.
2010-05-18T07:07:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	its all a juggling act when you have no money!
2010-05-18T07:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	harry-houdini1	is your employer looking for this solution?
2010-05-18T07:10:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	haven't seen a job in over a year...worked at harvard they used open ldap there...wasnt involved with its rollout though, wish i had been
2010-05-18T07:13:00.000Z	harry-houdini1	greezmunkey	decided to save setting up another vm for 2008 going to upgrade one of my domain controllers to 2008 from 2003, this will give me IAS...
