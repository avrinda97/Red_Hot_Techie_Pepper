2005-12-26T11:07:00.000Z	eksajm	qaqa	you have to set premisions for he folder.. have you done that?
2005-12-26T11:08:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	well, so long as ntfs is mounted, I'm not able to chmod it
2005-12-26T11:08:00.000Z	eksajm		well unmount it then, change premsions and mount again?
2005-12-26T11:08:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	I changed the perms to 555 after unmounting. I mounted it again after that. No change
2005-12-26T11:08:00.000Z	eksajm		kk ;/
2005-12-26T11:08:00.000Z	eksajm		you cannot write to a ntfs partitions
2005-12-26T11:09:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	I dont want to write. Read access is enough
2005-12-26T11:09:00.000Z	eksajm		not if ypu want to change the length of a file
2005-12-26T11:09:00.000Z	eksajm		kk..
2005-12-26T11:09:00.000Z	eksajm		root can read but not ordianry users?
2005-12-26T11:10:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	yes..
2005-12-26T11:10:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	I think there is something wrong with the folder perms
2005-12-26T11:10:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	cuz konqy still lists it as a "locked folder" for ordinary users
2005-12-26T11:11:00.000Z	eksajm	qaqa	hum.. thats not suppose to happand ;) .. did you follow a guide to mount it ?
2005-12-26T11:11:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	no..ubuntu autoconfigured it upon install
2005-12-26T11:12:00.000Z	eksajm	qaqa	oh, hum i might be the wrong person to help you. i am very new to ubuntu. i only used gnetoo linux
2005-12-26T11:12:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	Thanks anyway.
2005-12-26T11:12:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	I changed the mount point to a diff dir and it works now! weirdness!
2005-12-26T11:13:00.000Z	qaqa	eksajm	I think you were right about the folder perms then
