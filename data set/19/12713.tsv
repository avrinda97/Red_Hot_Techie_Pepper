2005-11-01T07:01:00.000Z	Razor-X		I like OSS *because* it can fork, but I wouldn't give a project natural precedence for forking
2005-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	Razor-X		plus, a lot of things appeal to niche categories, even if they wouldn't be profitable in mass
2005-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	Razor-X		(ratpoison et emacs, par example)
2005-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	Razor-X		xzgv, for another
2005-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	Razor-X		!codecs
2005-11-01T07:03:00.000Z	Razor-X		maybe I can even give a cat carpal tunnel syndrome *and( kill it in succession
2005-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	Razor-X		awesome!
2005-11-01T07:05:00.000Z	target	Razor-X	parse error ?
2005-11-01T07:05:00.000Z	Razor-X	target	hmmmm?
2005-11-01T07:06:00.000Z	target	Razor-X	it's just a quick guess but I've had a few times that program's don't work when they do it theirselves that it's some sort of parse error. Try 'strace' on it
2005-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	Razor-X	target	why would it be a parse error, though?
2005-11-01T07:08:00.000Z	target	Razor-X	cause it parses the commands you give to it, and maybe when it gets those from some other input (in this case another program) this is going wrong.
2005-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	Razor-X	target	you have any ideas on *why* mutt is giving a parse error?
2005-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	target	Razor-X	I have no clue whatsoever about your problem, I'm just saying that when it works when typed manually, and it doesn't when fed by another application, there could be a parse error invloved
2005-11-01T07:14:00.000Z	target	Razor-X	hehe.. thats.. just wrong? :)
2005-11-01T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	target	:P
2005-11-01T07:24:00.000Z	Razor-X	target	you don't use centericq?! :P
2005-11-01T07:24:00.000Z	target	Razor-X	Nope, I prefer gaim :)
2005-11-01T07:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	target	meh, that's useless for me, since I do most everything in a terminal emulator, and my WM makes it less fesible
