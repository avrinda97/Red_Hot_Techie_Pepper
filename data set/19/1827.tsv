2010-09-27T06:54:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Chaos2358	you've been told several times to use pastebin...
2010-09-27T06:55:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Chaos2358	instead of pasting multi-line stuff directly into the channel, use the pastebin service.  go to that website.
2010-10-24T20:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Chaos2358	what's the problem?  are you out of space on /?
2010-10-24T20:32:00.000Z	Chaos2358	arrrghhh	no not out of space but being installing and trying alot of different apps and such then deleting, alot of updates etc i'm used to running a defrag every other week on widows but since i switched to lucid dont know how
2010-10-24T20:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Chaos2358	i thought this at first as well.  ext file systems (others as well) don't fragment like Windows file systems do.
2010-10-24T20:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Chaos2358	so they don't need to be defragmented - they clean up after themselves on the fly.
2010-10-24T20:33:00.000Z	Chaos2358	arrrghhh	ok well ok then even better. than k you
2010-10-25T01:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Chaos2358	do you not have normal function keys?
2010-10-25T01:32:00.000Z	Chaos2358	arrrghhh	yes top of keyboard 1 through 12
