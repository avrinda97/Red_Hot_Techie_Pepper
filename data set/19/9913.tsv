2006-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		what is the command for bringing up a wireless network in ubuntu?
2006-10-20T16:35:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		dabar: I want to bring up my wlan so I can use it
2006-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		how do I run a graphical KDE program as root?
2006-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		assuming I odn't know the command line command that normally opens it?
2006-10-20T06:23:00.000Z	LjL	Hail_Spacecake	find out the command line first. if the program's in the K menu, you can right click on the K menu, do "Menu editor", and find out the command's name.

2006-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		heh, "kdesu"
2006-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		the KDE japanese copula :)
2006-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		hmm, I tried that
2006-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		and it still says that you have insufficient permissions because you didn't run it with sudo
2006-10-20T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	Hail_Spacecake	which program is that?
2006-10-20T06:25:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		wlassistant
2006-10-20T06:25:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		@ LjL
2006-10-20T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	Hail_Spacecake	what does it say exactly? wlassistant AFAIK doesn't even normally *need* to be run as root, so it'd strike me as strange if it complained that you didn't run it with sudo
2006-10-20T06:27:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake	LjL	when I run it normally, it says "You might have insufficient permissions for Wireless assistant to function properly. Did you run it using sudo?"
2006-10-20T06:27:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		and hten it gives an okay box to go to the main program
2006-10-20T06:27:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		but it doesn't find any networks
2006-10-20T06:27:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		and I'm pretty sure that ubuntu is actually detecting my network card, because it shows up in /sbin/iwconfig
2006-10-20T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	Hail_Spacecake	it doesn't ask me that, but then that might be because i don't *have* a wireless card... try plain "sudo wlassistant" perhaps. though "kdesu wlassistant" should be fine if not better :-\
