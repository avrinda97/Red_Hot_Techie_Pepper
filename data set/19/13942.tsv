2005-01-03T11:15:00.000Z	Quest-Master	crimsun	Most XMMS plugins work with bmp perfectly fine
2005-02-11T07:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Quest-Master	which wxgtk package?
2005-02-11T07:50:00.000Z	Quest-Master	crimsun	Any of them
2005-02-11T07:50:00.000Z	Quest-Master	crimsun	I'll link you to the topic in the forums if you'd like
2005-02-11T07:50:00.000Z	crimsun	Quest-Master	note that libwxgtk2.4 in both warty/uni and hoary/uni use gtk 1.2, whereas libwxgtk2.5.3 in hoary/uni uses gtk2

2005-04-20T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Quest-Master	hmm, Desktop Properties?
2005-04-20T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Quest-Master	I really don't know; I'm looking at Google's search results
2005-04-20T13:25:00.000Z	Quest-Master	crimsun	I'm doing the same; searching through the mailing list and UbuntuForums
