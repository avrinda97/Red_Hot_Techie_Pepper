2008-10-25T00:40:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	How did you install it?
2008-10-25T00:40:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	from ultamatix
2008-10-25T00:41:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	oh.  First off, don't *ever* use ultamatix.  Seeing that you already have...... well, lets see what we can salvage.
2008-10-25T00:42:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	Is there an americas army directory in /opt/?
2008-10-25T00:44:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	how about /usr/local/?
2008-10-25T00:44:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	/usr/local/games/armyops
2008-10-25T00:44:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	perfect.  remove that folder.
2008-10-25T00:46:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	/usr/local/games/armyops# ./uninstall
2008-10-25T00:46:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	done
2008-10-25T00:47:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	In the future, don't use ultamatix.  And actually,  you'll likely have to reinstall to upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu because of the damage its done (your upgrade may fail), so you'll want to have backups, etc.
2008-10-25T00:47:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	still the icon from games
2008-10-25T00:47:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	Right, you'll need to remove that manually.
2008-10-25T00:48:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	no remove here
2008-10-25T00:48:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	right click the applications menu, and you can edit the menu
2008-10-25T00:49:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	done thank you man
2008-10-25T00:51:00.000Z	neztiti	Flannel	where is the directory of ultimatix downloads or archive??
2008-10-25T00:53:00.000Z	Flannel	neztiti	I'm not really sure.
