2007-03-20T06:12:00.000Z	c1ru	soundray	i try it with gparted but cant find my sd
2007-03-20T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	is your card reader built in?
2007-03-20T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	or on USB?
2007-03-20T06:14:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	some of these aren't supported yet. Open a terminal, run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog', insert the card and see if any errors are logged. Paste them on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org if you need us to have a look at them.
2007-03-20T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	can you run 'sudo fdisk -l' and pastebin the output as well pls
2007-03-20T06:20:00.000Z	c1ru	soundray	when i try to format it with the camera, the camera say formating but when finished say another time that i need to format, i try it with ubuntu but i dont know how can i format
2007-03-20T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	give me a minute, I'm looking up some info for you
2007-03-20T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	are you on edgy or dapper?
2007-03-20T06:26:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	in that case, you should make sure you have linux-image2.6.20-12-generic
2007-03-20T06:28:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	you may be able to use the info at the top of this page: http://www.webcon.ca/~imorgan/tifm21/
2007-03-20T06:31:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	sudo setpci...
2007-03-20T06:31:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	happens to the best of us ;)
2007-03-20T06:32:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	insert the card again and see if fdisk -l sees it
2007-03-20T06:32:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	I think it's time to report a bug
2007-03-20T06:33:00.000Z	soundray	c1ru	hope you can work it out.
