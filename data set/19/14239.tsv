2005-03-23T09:55:00.000Z	hayden		f**k!
2005-03-23T09:56:00.000Z	hayden		i installed another stick of memory in my computer but it is saying i only have 192MB instead of 600+MB
2005-03-23T09:57:00.000Z	tony	hayden	did ur bios see the new memory?
2005-03-23T09:57:00.000Z	hayden	trippeh	my laptop has 2 slots, one that is easy to get to and one that is hard you have to take heaps of screws and stuff out to get to
2005-03-23T09:58:00.000Z	hayden		and my laptop already came with the 512MB stick, and i had an extra 256MB stick i was gonna put in
2005-03-23T09:58:00.000Z	hayden		so i put the 512MB in the hard to get to slot, and the 256MB in the easy slot
2005-03-23T09:58:00.000Z	hayden		but it is only reading the 256MB stick
2005-03-23T09:59:00.000Z	hayden		i'm not sure if the bios saw it coz the bios screen doesn't stay up for long enough
2005-03-23T10:00:00.000Z	tony	hayden	usually the bios will tell you it sees a new memory module
2005-03-23T10:00:00.000Z	hayden		yea
2005-03-23T10:00:00.000Z	hayden		but it only stays up for like 2 seconds then tries to boot
2005-03-23T10:00:00.000Z	hayden		anyway i will restart and see what it says
2005-03-23T10:01:00.000Z	tony	hayden	hit f1 f2 or delete to get to bios and look
