2008-04-05T11:23:00.000Z	wbreslin951	rhandyk	unless your setting up a broadcom wireless card lol
2008-04-05T11:24:00.000Z	rhandyk	wbreslin951	ubuntu recognizes my netgear usb wireless out of the box
2008-04-05T11:24:00.000Z	rhandyk	wbreslin951	in that case you need ndiswrapper, right?
2008-04-05T11:25:00.000Z	wbreslin951	rhandyk	i gave up on my broadcom card and decided to go with a wireless bridge i got layin around, the speed is as good as it would get with ndiwrapper anyways so i figured might as well
