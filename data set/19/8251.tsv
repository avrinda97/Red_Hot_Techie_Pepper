2009-04-10T22:29:00.000Z	SliMM		ok, this is strange, my pc uses 2.6 GB of RAM, yet the memory used by all the processes only adds up to about 500 MB
2009-04-10T22:30:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	ubuntu caches most frequent disk accesses into memory to speed things up
2009-04-10T22:31:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	well, hmm, how can I see what that cache is?
2009-04-10T22:33:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	run top, it'll tell you how much memory you're using
2009-04-10T22:35:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	well, it tells me I'm using ~3184156k
2009-04-10T22:35:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	33436k for buffers
2009-04-10T22:35:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	it doesn't say anything about cache
2009-04-10T22:36:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	use SHIFT+> to sort by different uses
2009-04-10T22:37:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	see the %MEM column, use SHIFT+> SHIFT+< until list is sorted by %MEM
2009-04-10T22:37:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	sorting doesn't help, if it's a process that's using up this much memory, it doesn
2009-04-10T22:38:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	sort until first process in the list has the highest number in %MEM column
2009-04-10T22:39:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	you can use htop, its interface is a little more friendly and the number are less confusing
2009-04-10T22:39:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	yes, I did that, what next? :-) â€” it's 1% i.e. ~40M
2009-04-10T22:41:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	well?
2009-04-10T22:42:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	run htop
2009-04-10T22:42:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	see what it says in terms of memory usage
2009-04-10T22:42:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	same
2009-04-10T22:44:00.000Z	usser	SliMM	i dont know, if it doesnt show up when you sort by memory usage, i really have no idea
2009-04-10T22:45:00.000Z	SliMM	usser	i have started epiphany and now it gets listed with 8 processes (different pids, the rest is identical)
