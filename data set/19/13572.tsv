2007-04-21T06:07:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	i read of another person having the same problem but can't find the article, or how he/she fixed it.
2007-04-21T06:07:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	hmm.
2007-04-21T06:11:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	yes, i'm afraid that will be the case.
2007-04-21T06:11:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	is this a laptop?
2007-04-21T06:14:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	no, not a laptop. a desktop with a CRT and an LCD connected at the same time
2007-04-21T06:14:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	ahah.. that's different. is it an ati card?
2007-04-21T06:15:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	yes, using the fglrx driver and the bigdesktop option
2007-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	you'll need to look at support for TV out. can you paste you /etc/X11/xorg.conf in a pastebin?
2007-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	uh, why tv out? In gnome, everything works fine, it's just gdm that's messed up. But yeah, I can pastebin it, give me second
2007-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	how are you getting signal to the second monitor?
2007-04-21T06:17:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	does it have two VGA outs?
2007-04-21T06:17:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	I'm using the Mode2, HSync2, VSync2 and Pairmodes options of fglrx
2007-04-21T06:18:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	ahah, i've experienced problems with this on a projector once.
2007-04-21T06:18:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	paste your xorg.conf
2007-04-21T06:19:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16797/
2007-04-21T06:20:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	the 2nd head device is just there to get rid of a warning, it doesn't actually do anything
2007-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	are you sure that the second monitor does 1152x864? also you might want to look into the Dont Zoom option.
2007-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	beerockxs	delire	as I said, the setup is working fine at the correct resolutions in gnome, only in gdm is it messed up
2007-04-21T06:25:00.000Z	delire	beerockxs	ahah yikes, i didn't read that distinction. i have no idea why gdm is doing this. are there some gdm session files that contain screen geometry state that could be cleaned out.
