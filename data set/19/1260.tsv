2011-05-30T21:41:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	can you reach smb://localhost ?
2011-05-30T21:45:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	"smb:\\localhost" like in firefox?  firefox refuses because the smb protocol isn't associated with an application ... I tried browsing to Ubuntu's own shared thru the network folders, and it failed, saying "Unable to mount location".
2011-05-30T21:46:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	no in a folder view
2011-05-30T21:46:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	it failed, saying "Unable to mount location".
2011-05-30T21:47:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	you can browse the windows machine from ubuntu?
2011-05-30T21:48:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	 Ubuntu can see the Windows machine on the network, but can't connect to browse the shares
2011-05-30T21:48:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	 and I can browse a third machine (that doesn't have any interesting files) from both machines
2011-05-30T21:49:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	the same error occurs when you manually specify the location with smb://<ip>
2011-05-30T21:50:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	 interesting .... smbtree sees all three computers, but for the first one ... ITSELF ... it adds "Error NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
2011-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	is there a firewall or has there ever been a firewall between the pc's?
2011-05-30T21:52:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	I don't know where I would enter an smb:// address ... I will check the firewalls ... both are inside the same hub, so the only firewalls would be software firewalls.  Where is the default installation for any Ubuntu firewalls?  (if I have a software firewall on the ubuntu machine, I didn't mess with it)
2011-05-30T21:54:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	I turned off the windows firewall (just now) completely, but I suspect that's not it, because Ubuntu can't browse itself.
2011-05-30T21:55:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	nah i was more referring to the ubuntu machine. Hmm ...... You should be able to enter an address when you open any folder
2011-05-30T21:56:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	I'm using Unity desktop.  The folders UI doesn't seem to have anyplace to enter a complete pathname
2011-05-30T21:57:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	euhm ... press ctrl L?
2011-05-30T21:57:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	that did it.  tx.  I'll try that now
2011-05-30T22:00:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	s3r3n1t7	"smb://localhost/", "smb://192.ip.ip.ip" and  "smb://Ubuntu" all return "failed to retrieve share list from server, please select another viewer and try again" ... "smb://127.0.0.1" returns a list of shares!!!
2011-05-30T22:01:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	wait what? localhost does NOT work but 127.0.0.1 DOES work?
2011-05-30T22:03:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	HelloWorld321	i'd suggest taking a look at your ip and dns settings ... it seems those are ... a bit wrong
