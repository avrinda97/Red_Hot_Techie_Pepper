2010-03-30T09:18:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	need sudo update-grub ; sudo touch /forcefsck ; sudo reboot from live CD
2010-03-30T09:24:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	[5.034757] init[1]: segfault at 81a0804 ip 0806172f sp bffa6550 error 6 in sh[8048000+ec000] [5.034998] Kernal panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!  is the error i get on live cd's do you know how to resolve this so i can fix the grub?
2010-03-30T09:25:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	use the options on F6 on boot screen manu on the live cd
2010-03-30T09:25:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	i hope it works
2010-03-30T09:26:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	which f6 option ? acpi=off, noapic, nolapic, edd=on or free software only
2010-03-30T09:27:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	all of them except free soft
2010-03-30T09:27:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	think kinda safe mode
2010-03-30T09:28:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	trying i hope it boots really need to go to bed lol
2010-03-30T09:38:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	its still not booting live cd says BIOS bug, local APIC #0 not detected!... forcing use of dummy APIC emulation. (tell your hw vendor) then it just sits here
2010-03-30T09:40:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	check your RAM with the memory test
2010-03-30T09:47:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	not real sure how to read the mem test how long does it run has bunch of stuff in red figure means the issue is bad ram?
2010-03-30T09:49:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	its strange that it kernel panic from live cd, maybe its something with ram or hdd
2010-03-30T09:49:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	if you cant boot, you cant fix anything
2010-03-30T09:55:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	think its ram since it shows Errors but since i dont really know how to read Memtest86+ i could be wrong sucks nothing is open to go get new ram and how would I know if it was both my sticks or just 1
2010-03-30T09:56:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	it brings up horrible red errors on hexa characters on the empty list that replaces the "no errors" thing
2010-03-30T10:03:00.000Z	blue316	juancarlospaco	yea taking it apart now to clean it out make sure everything is connected and take 1 of the sticks out at a time but geesh thats a pain with all the stuff i have in it lol
2010-03-30T10:03:00.000Z	juancarlospaco	blue316	may the force be with you...
