2007-05-05T12:40:00.000Z	demonspork		I just installed Ubuntu on a SATA HD from a SATA DVD drive.  When the system booted, it just said "DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER"  and when I boot back onto the live CD, I can see that everything is there as it should be.  How do I get this thing to boot?

2007-05-05T12:41:00.000Z	demonspork		no RAID configured
2007-05-05T12:42:00.000Z	demonspork		the BIOS doesn't allow me to pick which one
2007-05-05T12:42:00.000Z	demonspork		|chiz| and theoretically, if one boot device fails, it moves to the next
2007-05-05T12:43:00.000Z	demonspork		|chiz| The other one is empty
2007-05-05T12:44:00.000Z	demonspork		|chiz| I put an unformatted NTFS partition at the beginning of the drive in question, would that cause anything to be out of whack?

2007-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	demonspork		!xserver
2007-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	Tom47	demonspork	ctl alt backspace
2007-05-05T11:29:00.000Z	demonspork	Tom47	I don't want to restart it, I want to kill it and for it to stay dead
2007-05-05T11:29:00.000Z	Tom47	demonspork	you can boot in recovery mode
2007-05-05T12:21:00.000Z	Tom47	demonspork	step 1 .. ctl al backspace ..... step 2. take a look bottom lh corner and fiddle with changing the session to start next to a failafe terminal ... when finished with that exit, fiddle again to reinstate gnome/kde and bob's your uncle
2007-05-05T12:21:00.000Z	demonspork	Tom47	the failsafe terminal is running an X server
2007-05-05T12:22:00.000Z	Tom47	demonspork	then have you tried booting into recovery mode ... that should give you a root session with no xserver running
2007-05-05T12:25:00.000Z	Tom47	demonspork	do you understand the suggestion?
2007-05-05T12:26:00.000Z	Tom47	demonspork	and ....?
2007-05-05T12:28:00.000Z	demonspork	Tom47	I need to get a session at runlevel 3 at least with no X server running
