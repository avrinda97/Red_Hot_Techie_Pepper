2008-05-26T10:42:00.000Z	Muhammad_Saad	hamish_	have you tried to remove and then insert the device again?
2008-05-26T10:45:00.000Z	hamish_		yes and when i do it pops up a dialog saying that i cannot mount it because the mount point i specified was invalid(In different words of course)
2008-05-26T10:48:00.000Z	hamish_	Muhammad_Saad	do you have any ideas of how to get it to work?
2008-05-26T10:50:00.000Z	Muhammad_Saad	hamish_	I have never experienced something like that but may be you should try this. Go to System->Preferences->Removable Drives and Media. Set the options such that the device is not mounted automatically and then try to change the mount point.
2008-05-26T10:52:00.000Z	Muhammad_Saad	hamish_	did that work?
2008-05-26T10:53:00.000Z	hamish_		there is nothing in there for drives
