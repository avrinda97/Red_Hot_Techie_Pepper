2009-03-17T12:51:00.000Z	Nalf	ActionParsnip1	that doesn't work.
2009-03-17T12:51:00.000Z	Nalf	ActionParsnip1	there are people all over who have had issues with it and any 'work around' I have seen doesn't really work. From what I have read, it seems that the driver doesn't work well with the bundled version of X.

2009-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Nalf	same driver though right, maybe its a bug

2009-03-17T12:58:00.000Z	Nalf	ActionParsnip1	if I install the driver X crashes. Uninstalling it doesn't work. Tried a billion different xorg.confs.. yeah, I saw that.

2009-03-17T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Nalf	i dont use ati cards so im not much help, i can websearch like the best of em though
2009-03-17T13:01:00.000Z	Nalf	ActionParsnip1	hehe.. I saw most of that stuff.. just didn't have any luck with it. From what I gathered the x version that ships with 8.10 is incompatible with the driver because of a driver issue.  so people are waiting on ATI.
2009-03-17T13:01:00.000Z	Nalf	ActionParsnip1	maybe if I get bored later I'll install 8.04 and play around with it for awhile.
2009-03-17T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Nalf	sounds about righ
2009-03-17T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Nalf	always waiting for ati to get their finger out, sounds like the 90s ;)
