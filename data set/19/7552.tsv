2008-04-19T23:14:00.000Z	nitin	murlidhar	but y is this problem only persistent in ubuntu?
2008-04-19T23:16:00.000Z	murlidhar	nitin	i am not sure i am a noobie .btw is it only in ubuntu?
2008-04-19T23:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	nitin	also it is better if u ask ur question rather than giving a link to visit
2008-04-19T23:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	nitin	since the ubuntu hardy is coming there are a lot of developers that aren't present since they are working hard in getting hardy released in time
2008-04-19T23:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	nitin	it will be more better if ask these question after the release since they will be present in the channel
2008-04-19T23:23:00.000Z	murlidhar	nitin	did u check the link that has been given  , the latest post show some positive news
