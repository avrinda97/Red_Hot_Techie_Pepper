2007-09-27T14:33:00.000Z	amio	overclucker	I think so its really looking bad the windows shakes when I move them or even minimize or unminimize very slow like I would not have the card installed correctly or something missing
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	amio	overclucker	it is ATI RV3500   (also ubuntu see it as fglrx when I go to drivers I dont know if this is correct or its mistaken)
2007-09-27T14:35:00.000Z	overclucker	amio	did you install the driver from ati?
2007-09-27T14:35:00.000Z	amio	overclucker	no I did not is it possible with linux too?
2007-09-27T14:36:00.000Z	overclucker	amio	yup, ati and nvidia have 'limited' linux support for thier drivers
2007-09-27T14:38:00.000Z	amio	overclucker	so what should I do with 7.4 did not have a problem now I am having do you know any way to reinstall drivers?
2007-09-27T14:40:00.000Z	overclucker	amio	if ati website has a driver for it, then i might use that,
2007-09-27T14:41:00.000Z	overclucker	amio	did you upgrade to 7.04 or from?
2007-09-27T14:41:00.000Z	amio	overclucker	I upgraded from 7.4 feisty to 7.10 gutsy
2007-09-27T14:43:00.000Z	overclucker	amio	any specific reason for upgrading? cause newer isn't always better, and gutsy's kinks have kinks
2007-09-27T14:44:00.000Z	amio	overclucker	well just I was worried little bit one time I did not upgrade v 5 then waited till 7 was released then couldnt upgrade at all needed to thorow that all so I wanted to be more fast to avoid troubles
2007-09-27T14:46:00.000Z	overclucker	amio	well if you wait long enough, some of gutsy's updates might fix you problem / -=
