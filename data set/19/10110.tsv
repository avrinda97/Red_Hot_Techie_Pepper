2009-03-03T05:07:00.000Z	ellanceo		Does anyone know how to display the output before GDM is started to an external? My monitor on my laptop is broken, and I can't read fsck errors to get it to boot.
2009-03-03T05:08:00.000Z	ellanceo		My laptop monitor is broken
2009-03-03T05:08:00.000Z	ellanceo		I can't see anything I am editing to the Xorg file
2009-03-03T05:09:00.000Z	ellanceo		All I have is a root prompt, I'm looking for more of a commant I can just enter to switch it.
2009-03-03T05:10:00.000Z	ellanceo		Like I said, my LAPTOP MONITOR IS BROKEN, I can barely see anything on the screen at all. Yes I see the very top left corner but that is it.
2009-03-03T05:10:00.000Z	ellanceo		I can see GRUB start, and then I get some fsck errors. Exactly what I don't know.
2009-03-03T05:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	ah right yes that issue
2009-03-03T05:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	ok graphics card drivers gone bad?
2009-03-03T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	ok yeah loads of kernels?
2009-03-03T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	why not?
2009-03-03T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	wait
2009-03-03T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	it kind of makes sense to do  a reinstall when it's next version, because then you can have Ext4 instead of Ext3
2009-03-03T05:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	,but I can try on someone elses' computer anyway so :D  ,but only try through remote connect
2009-03-03T05:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	using a Live CD untill  next release  maybe a bit sucky, but   once the stuff is in RAM  things will be ok
2009-03-03T05:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	or  put Ibex on temporily a clean install. and  then do another clean install of next one or  something
2009-03-03T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	yes it's an option with next Ubuntu
2009-03-03T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	there was a speed comparision test and  that, that I saw
2009-03-03T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ellanceo	Ext4 really did kick Ext3's arse
