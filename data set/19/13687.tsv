2012-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	MrKeuner		any fail2ban users out there? I am looking for nice fail2ban jail.configuration
2012-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 cant say i ever used that feature of fail2ban
2012-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	you can enable new rules. such as rules for w00t w00t maniac
2012-02-08T07:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 not sure why i would need to. :) i just ban based on how many ssh attempts.
2012-02-08T07:20:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	so your fail2ban is not monitoring anything else than sshd
2012-02-08T07:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 ssh is basically the only public service i got going on my server. so yes.
2012-02-08T07:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 ssh and znc is all  have  going.
2012-02-08T07:22:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	you can monitor any log with fail2ban, including znv, or vnc?
2012-02-08T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 never really needed to.  I have  only the 2 exposed services forwarded through my router.  I cant say i ever noticed many znc attempts. Just ssh.
2012-02-08T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 not even running those at this time.
2012-02-08T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 i have changed my port. i still get ssh break in attempts.
2012-02-08T07:24:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	really? didn't know that
2012-02-08T07:24:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	I recenlt enabled a jail configuration for fail2ban.log itself
2012-02-08T07:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 just random scans. - I also have ssh set up where it onlyu works with key based auth. so no password attempts will work.   and the fail2ban (i think) is set where they get like 3 tries and they are banned.
2012-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 if they get banned here.. they are banned. :)
2012-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	that's another way :)
2012-02-08T07:27:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	i could write jail configuration for any log file, If I had understood regexp
2012-05-18T21:43:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Dr_willis	I would call them botnets
2012-05-18T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrKeuner	 actually i think its people on irc that see me and my ip. ;)
