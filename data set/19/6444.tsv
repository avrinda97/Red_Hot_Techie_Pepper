2008-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	adrock358		hello all.  ahve a question for you.  just rendered my os (vista) unusable.  I enlarged the partition, then could't boot from it.  i've tried everything.  and my question is, if i install vista on another partition (install it again), will I be able to browse my primary partition from there, transfer my data to my new vista os, and save the day?
2008-04-03T16:27:00.000Z	adrock358		the reason why i am in this forum is because I am also an ubuntu user.  I use a dual boot, but had to erase the ubuntu partition too, because i've messed up my system.  so now i want to recover data, and reinstall.
2008-04-03T16:28:00.000Z	adrock358		sunbird...no
2008-04-03T16:30:00.000Z	adrock358		ubuntu-vista dual boot.  then i resized vista (enlarged it.  then I reinstalled ubuntu.  now, my computer won't boot to anything.  nothing loads.
2008-04-03T16:32:00.000Z	adrock358		distrojockey, eth01.  isn't there a way to install another os, then look at my files on the vista partition?  then i could back them up.
2008-04-03T16:32:00.000Z	gejr	adrock358	you could use a live cd for that
2008-04-03T16:34:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	a windows livecd, or a linux live cd?
2008-04-03T16:35:00.000Z	gejr	adrock358	definately a linux live cd. Is there such a thing as a windows live cd?
2008-04-03T16:36:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 how would I get info on doing that?  what I want to do is put in on another partition....or my ipod...one or the other.  I'd like to create a new partition, then put it on that.
2008-04-03T16:38:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 what i want to do is resize the windows partition to free up some space, then put my info on that partion, then erase windows, then install vista and ubuntu again.  but i will need to see the data from one of the os's.
2008-04-03T16:42:00.000Z	gejr	adrock358	sounds complicated. I'd move everything i wanted onto a usb stick or external HD and wipe the whole disk and repartition it.
2008-04-03T16:45:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 i only have my thirty gig ipod.  but that could work if i put some data on another hd i have, and do that twice.  gejr.  so what you are saying is I can move the data to my ipod from the ubuntu livecd?
2008-04-03T16:45:00.000Z	gejr	adrock358	i've never tried to mount an ipod from a live cd, but if you manage to do that, then yes. It'd definately work.
2008-04-03T16:46:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 yeah, my ipod is mounted already.  that sounds awesome.  how would i go about doing that?
2008-04-03T16:47:00.000Z	gejr	adrock358	i guess the ipod can be used like an external harddrive. Just create a folder on it and copy your music/documents/pictures/porn there :) at least that's how other mp3 players i've used works
2008-04-03T16:48:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 but how do i mount my hd partition so that I can copy info from it.  i think i have to be root.
2008-04-03T16:48:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 it won't mount my hd.
2008-04-03T16:49:00.000Z	gejr	adrock358	sudo mount /dev/sd<tab><tab> /mnt/whatever_directory
2008-04-03T16:49:00.000Z	adrock358	gejr	 i'm going to try to mount with distr's instructions.
