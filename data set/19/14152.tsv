2004-11-01T13:16:00.000Z	ploum		Hi
2004-11-01T13:16:00.000Z	ploum		Myfriend has installed WinXP home after Ubuntu
2004-11-01T13:17:00.000Z	ploum		But now the Ubuntu install CD doesn't recognize any partition on the hard disc
2004-11-01T13:17:00.000Z	ploum		And grub won't reinstall because stage1 is false
2004-11-01T13:18:00.000Z	ploum		even parted complain about it !
2004-11-01T13:19:00.000Z	ploum		and there's a partition on the disk with ubuntu
2004-11-01T13:19:00.000Z	ploum		only the bootloader is broken but don't want to reinstall because the partition table is incorrect
2004-11-01T13:19:00.000Z	ploum		thx anyway
2004-11-01T13:21:00.000Z	stvn	ploum	you could try if you can fix the bootloader with some other ditro cd/rescue liveccd
2004-11-01T13:21:00.000Z	stvn		aargh /me slaps ubuntu, why do you always slow down my clock after a while
2004-11-01T13:22:00.000Z	ploum	stvn	I'm trying it with the Ubuntu install and a shell, with my Ubuntu partition chrooted
2004-11-01T13:22:00.000Z	ploum		Even the Ubuntu installer doesn't see any partition
2004-11-01T13:23:00.000Z	stvn	ploum	huh, but windows still works?
2004-11-01T13:23:00.000Z	ploum	stvn	yes
2004-11-01T13:23:00.000Z	ploum		of course ;-)
2004-11-01T13:24:00.000Z	ploum		(they break the partition table, but they work !)
2004-11-01T13:24:00.000Z	stvn	ploum	I suggest you get a rescue livecd to see if any of those tools can recover your partition table/data
2004-11-01T13:24:00.000Z	ploum	stvn	do you recommand a rescue CD in particular ?
2004-11-01T13:25:00.000Z	stvn	ploum	hm, not really, there's a nice overview site with livecds for rescue purposes, forgot the url though, I guess it was on distrowatch
