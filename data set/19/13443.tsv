2005-04-02T07:26:00.000Z	Redwraith111		alright

2005-04-02T07:27:00.000Z	Redwraith111		someone needs to make a winex package for deb
2005-04-02T07:27:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	the sad thing too, is after all the hassle of trying to get it compiled, assuming you succeed, it will probably dissapoint you.
2005-04-02T07:28:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	i mean it's highly overrated
2005-04-02T07:29:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	well, it's very hit and miss
2005-04-02T07:29:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	i mean you're going to have experiences that range from works with issues, to works with major issues, to doesn't work at all.
2005-04-02T07:30:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	by all means try it anyway, just don't get your hopes up too high ;)
2005-04-02T07:31:00.000Z	Redwraith111	caffinated	i shall se
2005-04-02T07:33:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	sure, assuming you own it.
2005-04-02T07:33:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	you might look at qemu as a viable free alternative
2005-04-02T07:33:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	keep in mind that neither vmware or qemu are going to let you play games.
2005-04-02T07:35:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	qemu is supposed to be fairly close to native speeds under linux now.  i think you need their accelleration package (which i'm pretty sure is not free) to achieve those speeds though
2005-04-02T07:43:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	different idiological beliefs
2005-04-02T07:44:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	debian and it's followers believe that you should always exhaust all reading options before coming to them.  this isn't always time effective.  and it's frustrating.
2005-04-02T07:44:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	however, if you do try to read lots, you will learn more.
2005-04-02T07:45:00.000Z	caffinated	Redwraith111	well, reading books, but also using google, reading the FAQs, manpages, etc ;)
