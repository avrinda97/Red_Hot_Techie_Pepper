2006-11-05T14:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	coffeegrinds	If you would explain your problem perhaps we could help you.
2006-11-05T14:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	coffeegrinds	well pick the non recovermode from the grub list.  Then log in to gnome.
2006-11-05T14:50:00.000Z	coffeegrinds	chuckyp	well both the install disk and my now broken upgrade to 6.10 from 6.06 seems to constantly be restarting my X session after I log in..
