2006-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	mumrah		hey, i'm having a serious problem with my edgy installation

2006-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	mumrah		anyone else having thise problem (no cd support)
2006-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	mumrah		heh
2006-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	mumrah		dvds work find
2006-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	mumrah		fine *
2006-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	mumrah		"/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0" is the output of grep cdrom /etc/fstab
2006-11-10T17:58:00.000Z	mumrah		when i try to mount the cd manually, it says no media present
2006-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	mumrah		so anyone got any ideas on the cdrom thing?
2006-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	LjL	mumrah	what does "grep cdrom /etc/fstab" say?
2006-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	mumrah	LjL	"/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0" is the output of grep cdrom /etc/fstab
2006-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	mumrah	LjL	when i "mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0 -t iso9660" i get "no media found"
2006-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	mumrah	try typing manually "sudo mount /media/cdrom0" with a cd inserted
2006-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	LjL	mumrah	i suppose it makes sense that your cd drive is /dev/hdc? (i.e. secondary master)
2006-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	mumrah	LjL	i have tried multiple cds, burned and blank
2006-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	mumrah	LjL	yes
2006-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	mumrah	LjL	dvds work fine
2006-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	LjL	mumrah	in the same drive?
2006-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	mumrah	LjL	yes
