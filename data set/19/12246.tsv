2005-09-29T08:59:00.000Z	PieD		Hi
2005-09-29T08:59:00.000Z	PieD		I'm going to buy a laptop, and I plan to use Breezy on it (I know, that's unstable)
2005-09-29T09:00:00.000Z	PieD		It looks like it works perfectly under linux, except one small issue : Battery state won't work out of the box
2005-09-29T09:00:00.000Z	PieD		I'll have to use a custom DSDT
2005-09-29T09:00:00.000Z	GeekWar	PieD	I'm running Breezy great. The recent updates have made it run a LOT better; faster and purt'ey
2005-09-29T09:01:00.000Z	PieD	GeekWar	yes, I know... I'm using it since 20 days :)
2005-09-29T09:01:00.000Z	GeekWar	PieD	From what I've read Breezy isn't doing so hot with the battery stats either
2005-09-29T09:02:00.000Z	PieD	GeekWar	my question isn't really related to battery status directly. I only want to know whether it has the custom DSDT option enabled or not
2005-09-29T09:04:00.000Z	GeekWar	PieD	I don't know how much help I can be but I'm sniffing around for you
2005-09-29T09:04:00.000Z	PieD	GeekWar	ok, thanks
2005-09-29T09:08:00.000Z	GeekWar	PieD	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ACPIBattery did you check this out?
2005-09-29T09:09:00.000Z	PieD	GeekWar	no, I'm going to do it yet :)
