2008-07-09T15:49:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		if you have a nifty app that publishes stuff, shouldn't there be an option to at least see what data is published to start with?
2008-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		I thought Ubuntu was interested in privacy
2008-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		I guess not
2008-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		can you send me a link to where it was security reviewed?
2008-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		why might that be?
2008-07-09T15:51:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		how would I go about finding the link then ikonia?
2008-07-09T15:53:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		it does not tell you the exact details of what it is sending
2008-07-09T15:53:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		it asks a series of questions, you answer them, you type in your launchpad email address and then it send the info
2008-07-09T15:53:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		and no, it doesn't
2008-07-09T15:54:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu		just so we are on the same page I ran it by going to the following menu: System -> Administration -> Hardware testing

2008-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	gordonjcp	yes, but it's not broadcasting my CPUs UUID
2008-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	who cares?
2008-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	can you give a specific example of why that would be a privacy problem?
2008-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	why would people be concerned?
2008-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	I do
2008-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	do you know me personally?
2008-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	gordonjcp	I know *you* do, but then you didn't ask my name publicly on the channel
2008-07-09T15:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ta_bu_shi_da_yu	well, personally is stretching it, but we both know where we know each other from
