2009-01-07T00:49:00.000Z	hwilde	xenocampanoli	   su username
2009-01-07T00:49:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 No.
2009-01-07T00:50:00.000Z	hwilde	xenocampanoli	su username     that will "switch users" to that username...
2009-01-07T00:50:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 That doesn't give me the environment .  Try it.
2009-01-07T00:50:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 That would be su - user.
2009-01-07T00:51:00.000Z	hwilde	xenocampanoli	I do not understand what you are asking
2009-01-07T00:51:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 But I need to execute stuff.
2009-01-07T00:51:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 I know.
2009-01-07T00:51:00.000Z	hwilde	xenocampanoli	if you type  "su somebody"  you will be that person, and have their environment
2009-01-07T00:51:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 I am trying to execute something under someone's environment from another user that has sudo access.
2009-01-07T00:52:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 Nope.  You only get it completely if you use su - user
2009-01-07T00:52:00.000Z	hwilde	xenocampanoli	   sudo -u somebody  command
2009-01-07T00:52:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 Nope.  That works on CentOS, but not on Ubuntu.
2009-01-07T00:52:00.000Z	hwilde	xenocampanoli	  ssh somebody@localhost command &
2009-01-07T00:52:00.000Z	xenocampanoli	hwilde	 Yes, but that is ugly.  I don't need to leave the machine.
