2009-05-18T02:13:00.000Z	wind0pain		When loading X with Gnome, what would be the latest point I could run a command?   rc.local ?
2009-05-18T02:13:00.000Z	wind0pain		(automatically run it that is)
2009-05-18T02:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	using solely init, rc.local
2009-05-18T02:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	commands can be scheduled later with cron
2009-05-18T02:15:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	if i create a file with VI and have two lines "sleep 60" the first and "mycommand" the second and then call this file in rc.local.... will this stop rc.local from running for 60 seconds or will it just cause "mycommand" to run 60 seconds later?
2009-05-18T02:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	both
2009-05-18T02:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	it causes the script to stop for 60 seconds
2009-05-18T02:23:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	or two separate files
2009-05-18T02:23:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	i guess two separate if it's just as much work
2009-05-18T02:17:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	is there a way i can allow rc.local to continue while waiting on the script i write?   i know how to do this in a shell:  type command, press ctrl+z, then type "bg"
2009-05-18T02:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	I'm not sure
2009-05-18T02:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	yes
2009-05-18T02:19:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	thanks
2009-05-18T02:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	do you want stdout and stderr to go to the same file?
2009-05-18T02:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	scriptname >/path/to/output-file 2>/path/to/error-file
2009-05-18T02:24:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	and if i had wanted just one file, would i do scriptname >/path/to/output-file 2>/path/to/output-file
2009-05-18T02:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	scriptname >/path/to/output-file 2>&1
2009-05-18T02:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	wind0pain	your method also works, but this merges stderr into stdout
2009-05-18T02:25:00.000Z	wind0pain	lstarnes	i see.
