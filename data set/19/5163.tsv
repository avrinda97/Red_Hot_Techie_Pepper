2008-10-28T23:18:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	set that up on /etc/fstab, the permissions, etc
2008-10-28T23:18:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	how would I do that in fstab?
2008-10-28T23:19:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	I use /dev/sdb1 /media/shared auto defaults 0 0
2008-10-28T23:21:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	i use these options: rw,nosuid,uid=1000(the uid of the user),gid=1000(gid of the user),umask=007
2008-10-28T23:21:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	so "rw" is what I need?
2008-10-28T23:22:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	rw = read and write
2008-10-28T23:22:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	the uid and gid to tell which user/group has access to the drive, i think that is important, security-wise
2008-10-28T23:24:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	if I use umask=777 would the mouted fs be 777/
2008-10-28T23:24:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	yes, and also every file in it, you shouldn't allow running execs from a windows drive though
2008-10-28T23:25:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	use -f (i think) to force dismount
2008-10-28T23:26:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	?
2008-10-28T23:28:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	still failed :(
2008-10-28T23:28:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	it's still owned by root too
2008-10-28T23:29:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	? did u set a uid and gid?
2008-10-28T23:29:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	yes
2008-10-28T23:29:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	after i edit fstab, then what
2008-10-28T23:30:00.000Z	danfg	danopia_	you do realize that changes to fstab require a restart, right? but before you boot, try mounting with mount using these options to see if they are to your liking
2008-10-28T23:30:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	oh right
2008-10-28T23:31:00.000Z	danopia_	danfg	thanks, it worked
