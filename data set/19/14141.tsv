2004-11-01T15:49:00.000Z	torpor		Wow, I really am stoked.  This is really impressive guys.  UBUNTU on my Powerbook ... really rockin' !!!!!
2004-11-01T15:50:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	:)
2004-11-01T15:50:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	it's the same for the installation on my girlfriend's powerbook :))
2004-11-01T17:34:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	right, but single user and text mode are not the same.. :)
2004-11-01T17:39:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	no, apt-get won't do it for you
2004-11-01T17:39:00.000Z	torpor	mrjive	so i have to make /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as well, right?
2004-11-01T17:41:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	don't know if you do not use the debian way
2004-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	are you trying to compile the kernel, aren't you? why not install kernel-package and o it the simpliest way (debian.way) ?
2004-11-01T06:08:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	install the sources, they are in the /usr/src dir
2004-11-01T06:08:00.000Z	torpor	mrjive	i did that, but it still doesn't make the symlinks that are needed
2004-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	for me only /usr/src/linux are usually needed
2004-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	tar xvfj is good too
2004-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	ok. what is the error?
2004-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	if you unzip than you have also to untar
2004-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	torpor	mrjive	i'm trying to install the Mac-On-Linux modules so that i can run OSX and Linux concurrently.  it requires the linux kernel sources to be installed and set up on the system.  i installed linux-sources-2.6.8.1, unbzip'ed the file in /usr/src, made the symlink by hand.
2004-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	ok good. :)
2004-11-01T06:11:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	what error do you get? then?
2004-11-01T06:11:00.000Z	torpor	mrjive	check #flood, i'll re-paste the errors i get when i try to compile the MOL module.
2004-11-01T06:11:00.000Z	mrjive	torpor	ok i'm joining #flood
