2011-12-16T12:59:00.000Z	DannyButterman		Hi there
2011-12-16T13:00:00.000Z	DannyButterman		Does someone here use samba shares over a wireless connection ?
2011-12-16T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	yes
2011-12-16T13:01:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	iceroot: I do too, but the pc takes ages to shutdown, because of these shares
2011-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	iceroot: don't you have the same problem ?
2011-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	no
2011-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	your box shuts down quickly ? how are your shares configured ? mine are on fstab with cifs
2011-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	mine are also
2011-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	some are manually mounted at boot time as I don't need them all the time
2011-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	and what is your ubuntu version ?
2011-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	10.04
2011-12-16T13:07:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	then I don't understand. I also use 10.04 (64 actually but it shouldn't matter)
2011-12-16T13:08:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	: what are your mount option in fstab then ?
2011-12-16T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	just -o username
2011-12-16T13:10:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	And you confirm you are on a wireless connection on this PC ? handled by NetworkManager ?
2011-12-16T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	both my wireless (managed by network manager) and my wired machine have no issue with this at all
2011-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	we did notice that the eth connection was not delaying the shutdown. But the wireless is. It's been three days I bang my head on the wall on this issue
2011-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	DannyButterman	I'm just thinking on this
2011-12-16T13:53:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ikonia	iceroot : here is my output at shutdown "CIFS VFS : No response from cmd 50 mid 89 Cannot stat /home/user/share/myshare : host is down "... !! Phelp
