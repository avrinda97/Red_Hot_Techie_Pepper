2010-04-13T20:36:00.000Z	Des804		Hello ?
2010-04-13T20:37:00.000Z	Des804		I just installed Ubuntu as a duel boot on this computer and was reading over what to do to make my wireless work and it honestly confused me which is a good feat considering I have a degree in IT
2010-04-13T20:37:00.000Z	Des804		so was wondering if anyone might be able to help me out a little bit
2010-04-13T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 i just right click on the little network icon at the top right and tell mine to connect to my network. :)
2010-04-13T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 that can make it harder then.
2010-04-13T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 the hardware-drivers tool dosent show anything needed for the wireless ?
2010-04-13T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 in the menus.
2010-04-13T20:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 be clear and verbose in your irc statements.. i dont even rember what you were talking about.  also use peoples full nicks. (see the tab key)
2010-04-13T20:50:00.000Z	Des804	Dr_Willis	 You told me to try to ues the hardware thing a few seconds ago I just tried it didnt work to try and get wireless to work in my ubuntu
2010-04-13T20:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 check the forums for that exact card  - or try the next release it may work  in it.
2010-04-13T20:52:00.000Z	Des804	Dr_Willis	 So when the next Ubuntu comes out which I was told is soon do I just install it over the ubuntu I have or will it upgrade it without installing it or how will that exactly work ( Wishing he hadnt installed Ubuntu afterall )
2010-04-13T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 you can upgrade. thats a MAIN feature of the package manager system
2010-04-13T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 what 'full restore' are you talking about?
2010-04-13T20:54:00.000Z	Des804	Dr_Willis	 The one where you press F9 when your computer starts that basically is a Full Image of your factory Defaults.
2010-04-13T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 that would totally depend on how the pc makers set it up.
2010-04-13T20:54:00.000Z	Des804	Dr_Willis	Well its a HP DV4 if that means anything to anyone
2010-04-13T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 try it and see is the bottom line.
2010-04-13T20:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Des804	 ive seen some that totally erase the hd.. and some that dont
2010-04-13T20:55:00.000Z	Des804	Dr_Willis	Ok
