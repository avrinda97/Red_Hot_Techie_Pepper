2008-04-27T22:52:00.000Z	J-Unit	masmota	but even dial-up is faster but im doing an upgrade and im getting discs for fresh installs
2008-04-27T22:53:00.000Z	J-Unit	masmota	leaving the upgrade window on 4th workspace doesnt bother me, it even stops using alot of internet speed wen im browsing or doing something else ;)
