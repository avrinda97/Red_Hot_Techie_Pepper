2010-06-30T09:57:00.000Z	opij		Hi. I would just like to know if there is a way to setup several streaming media links (streaming live 24/7 like http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html). I'd like to set up several of them so I can flip through them with a remote control. I'm using Ubuntu 10.04
2010-06-30T09:58:00.000Z	gene234	opij	  what app are you trying to stream with?
2010-06-30T09:59:00.000Z	opij	gene234	im not trying to stream with any app. I'm trying to find out what i need to do to accomplish what i want. If that means using an "app to stream" then please let me know what the appropriate one is.
