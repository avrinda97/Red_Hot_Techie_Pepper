2005-10-24T07:18:00.000Z	leetcharmer		sad day :( the whole reason I wanted to go to Kubuntu was to see if it would cause amaroK to work -- but alas, it's still broken :(
2005-10-24T07:18:00.000Z	leetcharmer		it never stops rebuffering
2005-10-24T07:18:00.000Z	leetcharmer		infinite radio buffer loop
2005-10-24T07:20:00.000Z	leetcharmer		:/ I don't own any audio CD's, so I typically used amaroK for online radio w/ my older distros
2005-10-24T07:20:00.000Z	leetcharmer		but in (K)Ubuntu it never works :(
2005-10-24T07:20:00.000Z	leetcharmer		sad day
2005-10-24T07:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	mp3 streams?
2005-10-24T07:21:00.000Z	leetcharmer	Amaranth	ya -- can't play those w/ amaroK for some reason
2005-10-24T07:21:00.000Z	leetcharmer	Amaranth	just continues to rebuffer
2005-10-24T07:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	see if the PM you just got helps any
2005-10-24T07:49:00.000Z	leetcharmer	Amaranth	I understand the whole 'restricted formats' rules and what-not, but, the online radio stations are able to be played w/ XMMS, so -- why not amaroK?
2005-10-24T07:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	xmms is in universe so it can come with mp3 support
2005-10-24T07:50:00.000Z	leetcharmer	Amaranth	what does 'in universe' mean?
2005-10-24T07:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	in the universe repository
2005-10-24T07:50:00.000Z	leetcharmer	Amaranth	what's the diff from universe and multiverse?
2005-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	xmms is probably in multiverse, multiverse is the part of universe where legally questionable things go
2005-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	leetcharmer	Amaranth	so -- audio applications have different codec support? like -- one can have mp3 codec support whereas the other one that should, doesn't?
2005-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	if one is in main and the other is in universe or multiverse, yes
2005-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	leetcharmer	usually the one in main can get mp3 support by installing an extra package
