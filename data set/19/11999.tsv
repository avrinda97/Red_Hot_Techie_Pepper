2006-08-21T09:38:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	for what it's worth: why not use GIFT?

2006-08-21T09:49:00.000Z	bigcx2	Sid	gift will not start
2006-08-21T09:50:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	what does it say when you run "giftd" from the terminal?
2006-08-21T09:52:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	You have to make sure to answer the first question as "1" and the "plugins" question appropriately.
2006-08-21T09:53:00.000Z	bigcx2	Sid	thats what i was missing, the first question had to be a 1
2006-08-21T09:55:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	Cool. After that, you just have to worry about the plugins question (otherwise it won't connect anywhere), and the rest should be all defaults.
2006-08-21T09:55:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	oh
2006-08-21T09:55:00.000Z	bigcx2	Sid	what client do you use?
2006-08-21T09:55:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	You running gnome or kde?
2006-08-21T09:56:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	giftui
2006-08-21T09:56:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	Nice and easy to use.
2006-08-21T09:57:00.000Z	bigcx2	Sid	does the gift daemon start @ boot time
2006-08-21T09:57:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	Although if it doesn't work for whatever reason, try giftcurs
2006-08-21T09:57:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	No, usually it starts when you click on your client
2006-08-21T09:58:00.000Z	Sid	bigcx2	However, you could very well set it up to do so under Sessions, and make sure your client does not turn it off when it exits.
