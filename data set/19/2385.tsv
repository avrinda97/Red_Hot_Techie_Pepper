2010-05-12T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	syslinux is NOT the fedora boot loader
2010-05-12T00:53:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	Ah. right...
2010-05-12T00:54:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	what's the problem you are having ?
2010-05-12T00:55:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	: I'm having issues restoring GRUB from a liveCD i've followed the wiki instructions twice and even resorted to wiping my MBR using dd and reinstalling GRUB but to no avail. The computer STILL want's to load up SYSLINUX and not GRUB.. There's no critical information on my computer so i'm not too worried about wiping and reinstalling but i'd rather not and it would be more interesting to solve the mystery!
2010-05-12T00:55:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	Also wiki says SYSLINUX is a bootloadr of the same ilk as ISOLINUX? [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYSLINUX ]
2010-05-12T00:55:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	syslinux probably means you've left a CD in the drive as it's used to load a mini environment
2010-05-12T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	or maybe even a net boot
2010-05-12T00:56:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	No cd or net boot. plus BIOS boots HDD before Net..
2010-05-12T00:57:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	it won't boot from hard disk if there is not a valid boot loader on it
2010-05-12T00:57:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	what command did you use to restore the boot loader (exactly)
2010-05-12T00:57:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	I used "dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sda" to wipe the MBR and then chrooted into sda1 (Ubuntu) partition and ran update-grub
2010-05-12T00:58:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	And install-grub /dev/sda
2010-05-12T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	so then there should be no syslinux anywhere as grub is nothing to do with it
2010-05-12T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	how many disks do you have in your system
2010-05-12T00:59:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	Exactly... which is why i'm confused as to why it's apearing. only one HDD with 3 partitions: Ubuntu 10.04, Fedora 13 Beta, Swap
2010-05-12T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	re-install grub without chrooting make sure it is using the right partitions
2010-05-12T01:01:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	Ok thanks. I'll try that now
2010-05-12T01:07:00.000Z	bushbaby	ikonia	That seems to have solved the issue.. Not sure why but thanks anyway!
2010-05-12T01:08:00.000Z	ikonia	bushbaby	no problem, keep in mind you have 2 distros on there, so its easy for grub to not work out what you really want to do
