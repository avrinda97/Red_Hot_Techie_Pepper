2006-10-09T07:54:00.000Z	Daverocks		i just installed ubuntu about 6 hours ago
2006-10-09T07:55:00.000Z	Daverocks		the OOB firefox on all other distros i've installed has worked...
2006-10-09T07:55:00.000Z	Daverocks		ubuntu is great, but this is really weird
2006-10-09T07:56:00.000Z	sidny4	Daverocks	what problem are you having with firefox?
2006-10-09T07:56:00.000Z	Daverocks	sidny4	it won't start, it won't open
2006-10-09T07:56:00.000Z	Daverocks	sidny4	nothing from the "firefox" shell script
2006-10-09T07:56:00.000Z	Daverocks	sidny4	but when i run firefox-bin...
2006-10-09T07:57:00.000Z	Daverocks	sidny4	it says, libmozjs.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
