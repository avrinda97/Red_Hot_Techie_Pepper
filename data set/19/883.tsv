2012-03-19T23:29:00.000Z	spych102		I can't get my game to run and i'm not sure why
2012-03-19T23:31:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	more details, what game?
2012-03-19T23:32:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	you running it in wine?
2012-03-19T23:32:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	no, i installed the deb that came from the humble bundle
2012-03-19T23:34:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	how are you running it?
2012-03-19T23:34:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	first through unity and then through the cmd line
2012-03-19T23:35:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	what is the output via terminal?
2012-03-19T23:35:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	it just returns Setting Video Head to 0 and Setting Resolution to 1366, 768
2012-03-19T23:42:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	i might try using the other AMD driver to see if it makes a difference
2012-03-19T23:45:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	you might try running the game from a different desktop environment, just incase compiz is at fault
2012-03-19T23:49:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	i tried running it from unity 2d, should that do the trick?
2012-03-19T23:49:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	unity2d doesn't use compiz, so yes, that would rule out compiz if it still doesn't work
2012-03-19T23:50:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	i've started to install the restricted AMD driver to see if that helps.. although last time i used it was not that great
2012-03-19T23:52:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	i've only used nvidia, so i couldn't help you with ati/amd
2012-03-20T00:14:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	the proprietary amd/ati driver has done the trick for zenbound2
2012-03-20T00:14:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	awesome, well done
2012-03-20T00:15:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	and it looks like the drivers are better than they were with my hardware
2012-03-20T00:16:00.000Z	spych102	auronandace	thanks for your help
2012-03-20T00:16:00.000Z	auronandace	spych102	no worries :)
