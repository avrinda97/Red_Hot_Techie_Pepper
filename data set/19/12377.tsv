2007-02-16T06:57:00.000Z	gary		I'm having some problems with flash.  I'm using firefox, and I have all the flash plugins installed.  In windows, the flash file plays perfectly.  But in firefox/gnu/linux I can only see the top-right hand corner of the file
2007-02-16T06:57:00.000Z	gary		I've checked this in firefox 1.5.x and firefox 2.x and it's both the same
2007-02-16T06:57:00.000Z	gary		I'm puzzled, why this is happening
2007-02-16T06:58:00.000Z	gary		Has anyone experienced this sort of problem before, or have any idea why this may be happening?
2007-02-16T06:59:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	Do you have flash7 or flash9 installed?  if the former, install the latter.  It's available in backports.
2007-02-16T07:01:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	I have flash7 installed.  Where can I find the backports apt sources?
2007-02-16T07:01:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	I have flash7 installed.  Where can I find the backports apt sources?
2007-02-16T07:02:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	actuall, for things like this (a single package) it's best to not add the entire repository (because it has other side effects), but just download the package and install it manually.  you can download from packages.ubuntu.com
2007-02-16T07:02:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	I'll try that.  Does the error message I pasted look correct and implies I need flash 9 installed?
2007-02-16T07:03:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	packages.ubuntu.com, then search for flash (same package name) in *-backports, click the package, scroll down to the bottom, download the file for your arch, install with dpkg
2007-02-16T07:03:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	that error message looks like you don't have the flash plugin installed at all
2007-02-16T07:03:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	strange, as flash works for other sites
2007-02-16T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	odd.  Well, maybe FF has some weird mime type thing going on.  But I imagine that mime is sent by other sites as well.  since I believe that's the standard one
2007-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	I've been fiddling around with the mime type in apache.  And that file is from the apache server.  I used this line in apache: AddHandler application/x-shockwave-flash .swf
2007-02-16T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	Wait.  Is it a shockwave?  er, let me check.
2007-02-16T07:07:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	Something is strange here.  I go to http://10.0.0.xx/mysite/images/myfile.swf and it does display just a little corner of it
2007-02-16T07:10:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	Do you think it's worth installing flash 9 if the file is playing but only showing a small part of it
2007-02-16T07:11:00.000Z	Flannel	gary	I don't know.  flash9 fixes a ton of issues with flash though.
2007-02-16T07:17:00.000Z	gary	Flannel	Flash 9 installed, although it still seems like firefox is using flashplayer7
