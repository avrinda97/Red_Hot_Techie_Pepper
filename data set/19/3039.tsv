2009-11-30T02:25:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	oh!
2009-11-30T02:26:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	which page actually tells what the latest version is?
2009-11-30T02:26:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	I am browning the netbook wiki but haven't come across that page yet
2009-11-30T02:27:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	http://www.ubuntu.com/  look at the orange text at left under the gray box
2009-11-30T02:27:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	thanks!
2009-11-30T02:28:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	what are you running it on?
2009-11-30T02:28:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	aspire one.  I really like it!
2009-11-30T02:28:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	interesting.. I was going to get the toshiba nb205.. is the aspire better?
2009-11-30T02:29:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	no clue what the toshiba you mention is...  I got this because my macbook died and I needed a portable machine in a hurry...  the corner store had these in stock.
2009-11-30T02:30:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	aha :) so not too much research went into it
2009-11-30T02:30:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	no not much
2009-11-30T02:30:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	I tried to get it going with leopard and I sorta did, but it wasn't very reliable so I repaved it with ubuntu and haven't looked back
2009-11-30T02:30:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	cool
2009-11-30T02:33:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	mine came with a 6-cell pack that bulges out the back, but it makes an awesome handle and it's still very light compared to the old one
2009-11-30T02:33:00.000Z	lesshaste	Snausages	ah cool
2009-11-30T02:34:00.000Z	Snausages	lesshaste	I typically get 3-5 hours but I'm not that conservative with usage
