2012-09-11T01:53:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	i can try to help you
2012-09-11T01:53:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	you believe it's all offline -- what do you mean? are you offline?
2012-09-11T01:55:00.000Z	ubuntu8	nydel	no
2012-09-11T01:55:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	are you on that system right now?
2012-09-11T01:56:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	you're technically on your own, we don't support that release. but i am happy to help you unofficially.
2012-09-11T01:59:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	what "driver" are you worried about losing?
2012-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	it's extremely outdated. i think you will be pleasantly surprised by precise (12.04)'s automatic hardware support, don't you think, dr_willis ?
2012-09-11T02:03:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	i'm totally stabbing in the dark, but try sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install; sudo apt-get upgrade.
2012-09-11T02:05:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	does the machine run only ubuntu, or does it boot anything else such as windows
2012-09-11T02:07:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	did you use wubi?
2012-09-11T02:09:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	if i were you, i would boot into windows & use wubi to make a new possibly temporary install of ubuntu LTS. you can then boot into it & see how it works, plus you can mount your old ubuntu partition & copy over needed files etc. or you could make a ubuntu cd & install on a new partition
2012-09-11T02:09:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	basically, you are going to have more trouble than anyone would hope for if you try to upgrade from so far away.
2012-09-11T02:10:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	do you have enough hard disk free to create a new partition for a new install of ubuntu?
2012-09-11T02:11:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	you could start fresh then migrate your personal files & settings over. a lot of things are going to work differently with the newer ubuntu so you are best starting fresh than trying to upgrade.
2012-09-11T02:13:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	new ubuntu has a software center. or you can use apt-get or aptitude.
2012-09-11T02:17:00.000Z	ubuntu8	nydel	there is a difference between a live and installation hardware recognition?
2012-09-11T02:17:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	i don't understand the question -- do you, dr_willis?
2012-09-11T02:21:00.000Z	nydel	ubuntu8	good luck - i think you should worry less, i think you will have a pleasant time installing the new ubuntu.
2012-09-11T02:26:00.000Z	ubuntu8	nydel	;P what is the fastest Desktop environment with ubuntu?
