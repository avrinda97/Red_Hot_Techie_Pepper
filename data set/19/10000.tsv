2007-09-28T06:26:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		how do you get ubuntu to install on a hp laptop
2007-09-28T06:26:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		obviously, they have problems
2007-09-28T06:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	try the AlternateCD you can do a full install in text mode then when it is done you can sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop if you want the GUI
2007-09-28T06:28:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	i dont think i can handle a alternat install
2007-09-28T06:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	it is straight forward and easy to follow
2007-09-28T06:31:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	first step to installing linux is getting over the fearof text installs. it really is not that difficult, the fact that you want to install linux is already a big step so have some faith and give it a shot :)
2007-09-28T06:32:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	um isnt it like 20 commands?
2007-09-28T06:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	www.ubuntu.com has the alternate cd you have to check the box before downloading
2007-09-28T06:50:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	i have the iso already
2007-09-28T06:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	the commands are not advanced there are menus and you use the arrow keys to scroll through and ENTER to select . very simple you read carefully and follow the instruction. when in doubt go with the default :)
2007-09-28T06:51:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	so its menubased?
2007-09-28T06:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	menu based in the sense that there will be a list of options when the cd boots
2007-09-28T06:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	trust me dude you can do this.
2007-09-28T06:53:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	i just hope i dont brick a $2500 laptop
2007-09-28T06:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	I cant promise I cant promise it will go off without any hitches but nothing will break
2007-09-28T06:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	it wont erase vista if you read carefully. dont just hit enter read everything first. the instructions are clear and simple
2007-09-28T06:56:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	im not that much of a nux noob
2007-09-28T06:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	Comrade-Sergei	then take the plunge. you have already made sure that the pool is filled. nothing holding you back now
2007-09-28T06:57:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	IdleOne	other than the fact that im in a open lab at college right now and my cdr s are at home
