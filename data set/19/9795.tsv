2007-02-10T13:16:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	you could use mail-notification - that looks at your pop-boxes and displays new mails in the tray
2007-02-10T13:17:00.000Z	BigMac	seraphim	what option menu is that under?
2007-02-10T13:17:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	it's a small program, you can install it via synaptic or apt
2007-02-10T13:18:00.000Z	BigMac	seraphim	And clicking that box that pops up will open my evolution mail box
2007-02-10T13:19:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	nearly ;D there's no box popping up, just a small envelope in the tray. hovering it displays sender an title, klicking opens your mail-program
2007-02-10T13:21:00.000Z	BigMac	seraphim	the name is mail-notification? because when I type that and hit enter I get nothing
2007-02-10T13:22:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	use "sudo apt-get install mail-notification-evolution"
2007-02-10T13:23:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	i'm not sure how it works with evolution, i use thunderbird as mail-client
2007-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	"mail-notification" ;)
2007-02-10T13:26:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	i put it into system -> preferences -> sessions -> startup programs
2007-02-10T13:32:00.000Z	BigMac	seraphim	Do you mind if I pm you because keeping up with stuff out here is near impossible
2007-02-10T13:33:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	i'm not registered in this network, so you can't pm me (at least i can't pm you ;) )
2007-02-10T13:34:00.000Z	BigMac	seraphim	Do you have yahoo/msn/aim?
2007-02-10T13:34:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	only icq ... 117036506
2007-02-10T13:35:00.000Z	seraphim	BigMac	we could join #akljghauilvhaskg
