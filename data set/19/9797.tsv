2006-09-13T08:18:00.000Z	rekster		lol ok just making sure
2006-09-13T08:18:00.000Z	rekster		thats funny though eheh
2006-09-13T08:19:00.000Z	rekster		not really a big issue, just confused why installing a wireless pc card in a laptop creates a 'ETH2' AND a 'WIFI0' and which one im supposed to be configuring
2006-09-13T08:20:00.000Z	rekster		heh but i have built-in wireless and it only has an eth1 not any wifi along with it, the inconsistency is what i find confusing
2006-09-13T08:21:00.000Z	rekster		stupid built-in broadcom that i had to use ndiswrapper to make work, but im installing a second pc-card wireless controller that doesnt require this ndiswrapper
2006-09-13T08:21:00.000Z	rekster		iwconfig displays both eth2 AND wifi0 with identical info
2006-09-13T08:22:00.000Z	rekster		thats wacked
2006-09-13T08:22:00.000Z	rekster		u said iwconfig should onyl display one?
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	rekster		no the other one is disabled, it would normally be 'ETH1'
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	rekster		iwconfig shows ETH2 AND WIFI0 for the same card
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	lupine_85	rekster	that's normal
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	rekster		oh ok
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	lupine_85		wifi0 is the 'controlling' interface
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	rekster	lupine_85	so which one do i configure, or does it not matter?
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	lupine_85		you should configure eth1
2006-09-13T08:23:00.000Z	lupine_85		or eth2
2006-09-13T08:24:00.000Z	lupine_85		whatever it's called
2006-09-13T08:24:00.000Z	rekster		and leave wifi0 alone?
2006-09-13T08:24:00.000Z	lupine_85	rekster	usually yes
