2008-02-06T11:21:00.000Z	idyllic		is there an easy way to install sun's glassfish and get it to use java6 instead of java5, which is listed as one of glassfish's dependacies?
2008-02-06T11:21:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Which one is listead as its dependency?
2008-02-06T11:21:00.000Z	idyllic	puff	java5
2008-02-06T11:22:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	I'd guess if it has an outdated java 5 dependency,then install it normally, then install java6?
2008-02-06T11:22:00.000Z	idyllic	puff	hmph i'm afraid of environment path etc to be broken..
2008-02-06T11:22:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Wait, there's an ubuntu package for glassfish?  Dang.
2008-02-06T11:23:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Well yeah, you'll probably have to root around in the config files for glassfish and fix them.
2008-02-06T11:23:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	But it shouldn't be to ohard.
2008-02-06T11:23:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	I say this having never installed glassfish :-).  But seriosuly, most app servers only have one or two places where the JDK pathhas to be wired in.
2008-02-06T11:24:00.000Z	idyllic	puff	>.< thanks mate.. but i m a linux novice + i got school project to do with sun java webserver... so no time to play with config..
2008-02-06T11:24:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Guess it's time for you to learn, then :-).
2008-02-06T11:25:00.000Z	idyllic	puff	trouble... glassfish package frm ubuntu exit 0... failed to install >.<
2008-02-06T11:25:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Do you *have* to use glassfish?
2008-02-06T11:25:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Why not just use tomcat?
2008-02-06T11:26:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	And do you *have* to use both glassfish and java6?
2008-02-06T11:26:00.000Z	idyllic	puff	well is it similar to sun web server app?
2008-02-06T11:26:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	Java6 added some nice stuff, but nothing earthshaking AFAICR.
2008-02-06T11:27:00.000Z	puff	idyllic	 Hm, well I don't know glassfish's specs fully, but most app servers, most people just usethe servlets and jsp stuff.
2008-02-06T11:27:00.000Z	idyllic	puff	well i need glassfish to run jsp..
