2012-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	awolf		How do I change my home folder permissions so I can get it working again?
2012-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	you'll probably have to boot recovery mode and do it via command line.
2012-10-19T09:58:00.000Z	awolf	KM0201	what command gets my home folder permissions back?
2012-10-19T09:59:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	i'm really not sure.
2012-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	you have to do it from recovery... i don't think that requires sudo.
2012-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	recovery mode, logs you in as root automatically
2012-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	once you get logged in as root, cd to home (cd /home) and ls -l
2012-10-19T10:05:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	whatever your username is, use it in all three spots (looking at that, i assumed your username was aaron)
2012-10-19T10:06:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	now, after you do that, try ls -l and see what it says
2012-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	now, try to reboot and see if it works.
2012-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	thank me if it works..lol
2012-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	not sure if it helps, but here's mine drwxr-xr-x 50 ken ken 4096 Oct 18 17:07 ken
2012-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	KM0201	awolf	other than that "50" and yours being a "2" ours look the same
