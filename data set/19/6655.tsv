2012-10-23T21:10:00.000Z	ksbalaji		Im on a livecd. HDD damaged. 1gb RAM memory only. Hence Ive removed compiz, oo and some other apps to save memory. I also wish to remove metacity and run something like jwm. Please suggest method. I cannot obviously restart the PC now running 10.4 livecd.
2012-10-23T21:11:00.000Z	ksbalaji		Ive also installed atop, smem to see mem usage. Any suggestions here please?
2012-10-23T21:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	ksbalaji	 you can do a full normal install to a decent sized usb flash
2012-10-23T21:14:00.000Z	ksbalaji	dr_willis	I tried. I have a 4gb pendrive and I tried ubiquity. It finished install. But does not boot!
2012-10-23T21:14:00.000Z	dr_willis		or a persistant save setup
2012-10-23T21:15:00.000Z	dr_willis		4gb would barely be big enough
2012-10-23T21:15:00.000Z	dr_willis		persistant save would work.
2012-10-23T21:15:00.000Z	dr_willis		or tinycorelinyx = 10-35 mb ;)
2012-10-23T21:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji	dr_willis	But the entire os takes up only about 1gb?
2012-10-23T21:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	ksbalaji	 havent noticed really. i do full installs to 8+gb flash all the time
2012-10-23T21:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji	dr_willis	how to do persistant save please?
2012-10-23T21:16:00.000Z	dr_willis		12.10 is no longer a single cd sized iso
2012-10-23T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	ksbalaji	 that ubuntu disk creator tool can do it
2012-10-23T21:17:00.000Z	ksbalaji		I repeat -  I am on 10.4 do not have the latest.
2012-10-23T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis		10.04 has same tools.
2012-10-23T21:18:00.000Z	ksbalaji		dr_willis:
2012-10-23T21:18:00.000Z	ksbalaji	dr_willis	What option do I take for persistant save?
2012-10-23T21:19:00.000Z	dr_willis		should be a checkbox/slider. i havebt used 10.04 since 10.10 came out.. ;)
2012-10-23T21:19:00.000Z	ksbalaji	dr_willis	thanks. I shall check up.
