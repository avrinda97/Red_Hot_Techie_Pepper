2012-03-30T07:14:00.000Z	lesshaste		I don't just add the user to the admin group?
2012-03-30T07:14:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	you could, but it's not magic.  read /etc/sudoers to see why "admin" works
2012-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	I just read it .. it didn't seem very helpful
2012-03-30T07:17:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	your file doesn't have the comment "members of the admin group ..."?
2012-03-30T07:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	why not just do sudo adduser <username> admin?
2012-03-30T07:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	yes it has # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
2012-03-30T07:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	but what does that mean for me?
2012-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	that explains the mechanism why adding users to admin group allows them to sudo to get root privileges
2012-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	yes, of course you would add users to admin group to give them ability to sudo.  but, wouldn't you like to know why that works?  :-)
2012-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	why not just use the adduser command
2012-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	I still don't know as the line seems commented out to me
2012-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	no it's not.  %admin means "admin unix group"
2012-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	ok!
2012-03-30T07:24:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	in the future if you want to do something similar to admin, let's say, "junior admins", you can add similar mechanism to sudoers file
2012-04-03T04:16:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	left shift
2012-04-03T04:18:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	so ... you don't wanna hold the left-shift key during boot before grub loads? :-)
2012-04-03T04:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	that's fine but I would like to see it by default
2012-04-03T04:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	sparky-	I assume GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
2012-04-03T04:20:00.000Z	sparky-	lesshaste	/etc/default/grub
