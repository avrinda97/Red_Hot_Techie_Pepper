2009-02-05T02:34:00.000Z	amaurea		I can't seem to find liblua51 and liblualib51, but only the (relatively ancient) 50 versions (from 2003, it seems). will I have to download these manually? if so, how do I install them without making the package manager confused?
2009-02-05T02:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	i find a lot of liblua5.1-* packages
2009-02-05T02:36:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	hum, are those results packages?
2009-02-05T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	no the results of the bot are trash ;P do "apt-cache search lua5.1" on your ubuntu box
2009-02-05T02:37:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	oh, I find lua5.1, that's not the problem
2009-02-05T02:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	liblua5.1-0 <<<
2009-02-05T02:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	a lot more just run the command i gave
2009-02-05T02:38:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	which command was that?
2009-02-05T02:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	"apt-cache search lua5.1"
2009-02-05T02:40:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	misieq: ok, I am convinced
2009-02-05T02:40:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	the only lua.h I can find, though, is in /usr/include/lua50/lua.h
2009-02-05T02:49:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	misieq: thank you, my lua problems seems to be gone (though having to specify 5.1 all the time is a bit irritating)
2009-02-05T02:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	no problem
2009-03-01T01:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
2009-03-01T01:20:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	thank you, running it now. I'll see what happens
2009-03-01T01:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	no problem
2009-03-01T01:22:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	hm, that produces some messages about unknown media types. they don't seem to be fatal though. is it normal?
2009-03-01T01:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	amaurea	can not tell without seeing the actual mesgs but if the configure run until completion it may be harmless
2009-11-10T01:55:00.000Z	amaurea	erUSUL	I see. In that case, I will install a new firefox manually, and enable the proper branding myself
