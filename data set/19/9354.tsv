2008-12-23T01:05:00.000Z	joejc		how does pastebinit work?
2008-12-23T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	here's an example ... ls | pastebinit will send the output from ls to a pastebin and resturn the url
2008-12-23T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	cat /var/log/syslog | pastebinit will copy the file /var/log/syslog to pastebin etc
2008-12-23T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	cat itself just prints out a file
2008-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	ask the mint-people (but probably yes)
2009-03-15T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	stop asking meta questions.. just ask your real question
2009-03-15T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	ok, answer is yes.. someone here knows what mobile broadband is
2009-03-15T14:17:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	oh.. so that was the real question..
2009-03-15T14:18:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	you weren't really interested in the answer to the first question.. that's why it's called a meta question.. why didn't you just ask "how do I get mobile broadband to work" right away?
2009-03-15T14:20:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	then just repeat your real question every 15 minutes or something.. if you don't get an answer to that question then perhaps you might want to rephrase it.. not into an "anyone" question.. I would add what version of ubuntu you're running.. what kind of mobile broadband you are using, what you've tried so far etc etc
2009-07-13T13:56:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	or just grep 'searchterm' filename
2009-07-13T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	man grep   will tell you about all the options you have
2009-07-13T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	joejc	but grep is the tool you want, definately
