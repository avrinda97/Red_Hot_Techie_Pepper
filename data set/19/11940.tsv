2007-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	ubunt1		no
2007-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	ubunt1		58gb free hard disk and i can't transfer 4gb
2007-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	ubunt1		fat32
2007-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	ubunt1		don't say me that UBuntu is good?
2007-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	do you have a support question?
2007-09-30T10:51:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	uhm, that's not really a support question, perhaps try explaining what you're attempting to do, and what goes wrong when you try.
2007-09-30T10:51:00.000Z	ubunt1	LjL	hmm,lets see 58gb 32fat hard disk,becouse from this i can put file when i'm in Windows and from where i'm from LInux i too can send them to WIndows
2007-09-30T10:52:00.000Z	ubunt1	LjL	now lets see,i make it fat 32,becouse windows can see it,and write,but i read that the max is 4gb transfer?
2007-09-30T10:52:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	i don't think FAT32 supports files bigger than 4Gb
2007-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	ubunt1	LjL	now lets see,i make it fat 32,becouse windows can see it,and write,but i read that the max is 4gb transfer?
2007-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	yes, that's correct, FAT32 only supports <4Gb files.
2007-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	ubunt1	LjL	Then what i need to use more from 4gb?
2007-09-30T10:54:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	user another filesystem
2007-09-30T10:55:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	are you saying that the official Microsoft site is *lying* about FAT32?
2007-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	1137 files is not 1 file.
2007-09-30T10:57:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	an NTFS filesystem, or an ext3 filesystem.
2007-09-30T10:58:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	with appropriate programs, yes, Windows can see ext3. see the bot.
2007-09-30T10:59:00.000Z	LjL	ubunt1	NTFS *is* a filesystem made by Microsoft, for Windows.
