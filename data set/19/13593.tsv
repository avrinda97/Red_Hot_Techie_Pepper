2005-03-13T13:27:00.000Z	pauldaoust		seems to happen so often in the world of computers.
2005-03-13T13:27:00.000Z	pauldaoust		hey folks, I have weird load problems during periods of high disk usage... funny thing is that my load goes sky-high, but my processor usage barely budges. But my mouse skips and locks up, and I can't move windows, just as if the processor were at 100% usage. I think kswapd is spawning threads or something... yes, DMA is on; yes, I have a UDMA100 hard drive; yes, my cable has 80 conductors. ReiserFS, if anyone needs to know.
2005-03-13T13:28:00.000Z	pauldaoust		:)
2005-03-13T13:30:00.000Z	pauldaoust		great Scott, this apt update is taking ages to download... maybe I should cancel my torrents...
2005-03-13T13:30:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	pretty stable right now considering its a devel branch... hell, even if it weren't
2005-03-13T13:31:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	I prefer the daily snapshots... find the most recent with no issues on your arch, then you don't have to upgrade so much post-install  :P
2005-03-13T13:31:00.000Z	pauldaoust	lunitik	cool stuff. I'm using chunks of Hoary... mostly programs that were stale in Warty, like jack, screem, ardour, python, Firefox, etc...
2005-03-13T13:31:00.000Z	pauldaoust	lunitik	how do daily snapshots work? do you mean just daily updates through apt?
2005-03-13T13:32:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	a script gets ran once a day, and voila, you have a snapshot of the archive as an iso  :)
2005-03-13T13:32:00.000Z	pauldaoust	lunitik	my word
2005-03-13T13:32:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/
2005-03-13T13:33:00.000Z	pauldaoust	lunitik	you mean I just finished downloading Hoary array5 for nothing?!?
2005-03-13T13:33:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	heh... I know huh... pay peticular attention though to the 'report.html' files...
2005-03-13T13:33:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	if only to glance at the bottem and make sure nothing is bad on your arch
2005-03-13T13:34:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	for nothing? no... but afaik, the array's are just daily images that can be refered to more easily
2005-03-13T13:36:00.000Z	pauldaoust	lunitik	see how much I know ^_^
2005-03-13T13:37:00.000Z	pauldaoust	lunitik	I almost screwed up sacha__ 's install......
2005-03-13T13:44:00.000Z	lunitik	pauldaoust	well... if you turned off the lights, you'd have an awesome light show (more than likely)
