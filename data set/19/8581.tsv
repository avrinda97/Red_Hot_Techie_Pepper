2008-06-13T01:24:00.000Z	pawpaw		How do I keep VMware server from starting at boot?
2008-06-13T01:25:00.000Z	pawpaw		how could MTU have anything to do with DHCP, when DHCP packets will be FAR smaller than MTU?
2008-06-13T01:25:00.000Z	KyleK	pawpaw	what part of vmware server? theres i think a kernel module and like the daemon, which should just be something in /etc/init.d
2008-06-13T01:25:00.000Z	pawpaw		not saying MTU couldn't be the problem, just not likely
2008-06-13T01:26:00.000Z	pawpaw		kylek: just don't use it every time I use the machine so I wanted to shut it off unless I need to run it to save resources.... So maybe the dameon?
2008-06-13T01:27:00.000Z	pawpaw	nano	seems unlikely
2008-06-13T01:27:00.000Z	pawpaw		DHCP is a pretty standard thing
2008-06-13T01:27:00.000Z	pawpaw		and i've never seen any machines crash a router, without someone trying to do just that
2008-06-13T01:28:00.000Z	pawpaw		yeah, but you should start with the most likely cause.... if all other machines work OK, and then the *nix box doesn't and has to be rebooted to get an address.... seems to me the *nix box would be where to start
2008-06-13T01:28:00.000Z	KyleK	pawpaw	update-rc.d vmware-server(dunno exactly) remove <-- maybe?
2008-06-13T01:29:00.000Z	pawpaw	nano	no offense, just saying
2008-06-13T01:29:00.000Z	pawpaw		kylek: yeah, that stops it from ever coming up though I think
2008-06-13T01:29:00.000Z	KyleK		well you can just /etc/init.d/vmware-server start when you want it
2008-06-13T01:29:00.000Z	pawpaw		sykpomp: so you have to reboot the router, or the linux box?
2008-06-13T01:30:00.000Z	KyleK	pawpaw	well how do you want to control the service then?
2008-06-13T01:30:00.000Z	pawpaw		sykopomp: I would say maybe you could check the scope on the router, see if it is depleted... lease times... etc... that's only thing I could think of off hand on the router.  What type or router?
2008-06-13T01:31:00.000Z	pawpaw		Kylek: just don't want it to start at boot, and then if I want to use it manually start it
2008-06-13T01:31:00.000Z	KyleK	pawpaw	if you dont trust update-rc.d to just remove the links, which is what it should do
