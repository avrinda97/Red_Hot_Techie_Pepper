2008-06-30T22:32:00.000Z	greenfishx3		http://students.estrellamountain.edu/larson/help/symlinks.htm "ln seattle emerald-city RET" This command makes a hard link from an existing file, `seattle', to a new file, `emerald-city'. You can read and edit file `emerald-city' just as you would `seattle'; any changes you make to `emerald-city' are also written to `seattle' (and vice versa). If you remove the file `emerald-city', file `seattle' is also removed. <-- they cahnged
2008-06-30T22:32:00.000Z	greenfishx3		this in linux?
2008-06-30T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 thats a specific command, thats common under unix/linux and similer os's.     specifically thats a feature of the filesystems also.
2008-06-30T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 and it does work that way..  if its  the LAST hard link to the file. :)
2008-06-30T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 if a file has 4 hard links to it from different places. it will only get deleted  if all are deleted.
2008-06-30T22:35:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Dr_willis	sipior i did and the file still remains
2008-06-30T22:35:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Dr_willis	I followed the example, but my file still remains
2008-06-30T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 theres also a differance btween a hard link and soft link.. the file has its original name also.
2008-06-30T22:35:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Dr_willis	yes but I followed the example and it doesnt work, thats why im really confused
2008-06-30T22:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 the 'original' name - i guess you can consider identical to the hard link name.   s
2008-06-30T22:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 all the linux books ive read  explain it  how i mention.
2008-06-30T22:36:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Dr_willis	are you telling me if I remove the hard link the original will also be deleted (like the text states) ?
2008-06-30T22:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 make a hard link to a file. and it  really is identical to the 'original' name. the filesystem cant tell the differance.. because there really is no differance
2008-06-30T22:37:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Dr_willis	you see I removed the hard link, but my original file still remains, but the book/example claims it should be deleted
2008-06-30T22:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 the book is wrong then. the 'original' name is technically a hard link also . i guess you can say
2008-06-30T22:38:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Dr_willis	sipior thanks guys for the clarification
2008-07-02T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 i would try 'rename' or 'mv'  :)
2008-07-02T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 with fancy quoteing -> 'file with spaces'
2008-07-02T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	greenfishx3	 or 'escape' the spaces    file\ with\ spaces
