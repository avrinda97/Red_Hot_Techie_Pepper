2009-04-26T08:10:00.000Z	gasull		Hi.  I tried everything to change my desktop background.  I don't get any error.  It just doesn't change.  What can I do?
2009-04-26T08:12:00.000Z	gasull		Nobody knows how to change the desktop background in Gnome?  Really?  Please help
2009-04-26T08:12:00.000Z	xfurious	gasull	well theres like 50 ongoing problems and that one just seems strange . i mean you did try going to settings->preferences->desktop or whatever it is right?
2009-04-26T08:14:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	I don't se a settings->preferences->desktop.  I tried with System->Preferences->Appearance.  It didn't work.  (Using Ubuntu 8.04)
2009-04-26T08:15:00.000Z	xfurious	gasull	really? are you sure you have gnome
2009-04-26T08:15:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	Yest, it's Gnome.
2009-04-26T08:16:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	I was using Xcfe for a while and went back to Gnome
2009-04-26T08:16:00.000Z	xfurious	gasull	and you have icons on your desktop? but cant right click and get a menu? are you sure your right click button is working :-P
2009-04-26T08:16:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	No, I don't see the icons in my desktop
2009-04-26T08:16:00.000Z	xfurious	gasull	alt+f2 'nautilus' i think
2009-04-26T08:17:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	To see what I have in the desktop I have to go to Places->Desktop
2009-04-26T08:18:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	I don't understand what you want me to do w/nautilus
2009-04-26T08:18:00.000Z	xfurious	gasull	ok and you tried alt+f2 and ran 'nautilus' ?
2009-04-26T08:18:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	yes
2009-04-26T08:19:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	It just opens a window
2009-04-26T08:19:00.000Z	xfurious	gasull	open a terminal and type nautilus. if theres one error line, paste it, if theres a lot of output , use paste.ubuntu.com
2009-04-26T08:19:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	the file browser window
2009-04-26T08:19:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	Done.  I don't get any error
2009-04-26T08:22:00.000Z	gasull	xfurious	Will it be fixed rebooting?
