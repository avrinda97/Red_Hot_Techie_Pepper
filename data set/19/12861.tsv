2005-06-24T15:32:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	?
2005-06-24T15:37:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	konqueror treats mime types weird, and the web server probably is misconfigured
2005-06-24T16:19:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	did you install Nvidia drivers from tarball or from package?
2005-06-24T05:41:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	does GL stuff work for everything else?
2005-06-24T05:44:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	recompile kernel? sounds a bit fishy
2005-06-27T08:58:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	it sounds like a normal diff - what is the first line?
2005-06-27T09:00:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	you'll need to show me the first line - it's all relative to the path
2005-06-27T09:01:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	hmmm... looks like it was made in the source directory
2005-06-27T09:01:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	no, not really
2005-06-27T09:02:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	make sure you have a backup of your kernel source before applying it!
2005-06-27T09:02:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	then run: patch -p0 < patch-2.6.1
2005-06-27T09:02:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	from inside the source directory
2005-06-27T09:05:00.000Z	cazabam	microhaxo	it's linux-source-2.6.xxxx where xxxx is the version you want
