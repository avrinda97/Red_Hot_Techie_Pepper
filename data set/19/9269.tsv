2006-12-22T17:02:00.000Z	storkme		how does one get ram module info on ubuntu?
2006-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	storkme		?
2006-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	storkme		i think there's something seriously wrong with my ubuntu user home... Could not chdir to home directory /home/derek: Permission denied
2006-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	storkme		-sh: /home/derek/.profile: Permission denied
2006-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	Eek!
2006-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	Please do "whoami"
2006-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	Is your /home mounted on another partition by chance?
2006-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	storkme	Stormx2	yeah
2006-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	It could be that it was incorrectly mounted, not mounted at all, or mounted as root readable only
2006-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	storkme	Stormx2	can't be that, it works fine for my other user
2006-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	Thats odd...
2006-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	Could you please cd to /home, can you do that?
2006-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	storkme	Stormx2	yeah, can do that
2006-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	storkme	Stormx2	ls -l shows: drw-r--r-- 4 derek root     4096 2006-12-21 23:17 derek
2006-12-22T07:51:00.000Z	storkme	Stormx2	the more curious part is that root can see all the files and they look fine
2006-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	Judging by that ls -l output, your home partition is either owned by root or is in the group root...
2006-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	let me check what mine is...
2006-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	storkme	Stormx2	hmm, i got it working by making root do +x on the directory
2006-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	storkme	I assume your user is a sudoer, etc?
