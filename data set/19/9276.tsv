2006-12-05T09:06:00.000Z	zac1		does anyone know about glibc
2006-12-05T09:06:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	what about it
2006-12-05T09:07:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	sudo apt-get install libc6
2006-12-06T17:17:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	menu-> system
2006-12-06T14:37:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	sudo mount /dev/<dev> /mnt/<folder>
2006-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	what kind of mp3 player is it just a usb type or a hard drive?
2006-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	well that didn't really anwser my question, sicne my ipod is usb but it's hard drive one but it should be automounted if it's just a flash one
2006-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	check dmesg to see if anything is in there about your mp3 player
2006-12-12T07:31:00.000Z	zac1	kitche	Yes there is!
2006-12-12T07:32:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	then it's most likely mounted already check /media
2006-12-12T07:33:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	or type mount and see what's mounted
2006-12-12T07:33:00.000Z	zac1	kitche	not there!
2006-12-12T07:34:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	mount doesn't say something like /dev/sdX
2006-12-12T07:35:00.000Z	zac1	kitche	no
2006-12-12T07:36:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	then it seems like you need to manually mount it with sudo mount /dev/sdXc where X is a or b and c would be 1 most likely
2006-12-12T07:38:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/mp3 you ight have to do mkdir /media/mp3
2006-12-12T07:40:00.000Z	zac1	kitche	special device does not exist
2006-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	type in here what command you are using exactly
2006-12-12T07:43:00.000Z	kitche	zac1	ok then it seems that you have to figure out what device it's using
