2006-04-04T08:11:00.000Z	rubso		who's using Kubuntu here?
2006-04-04T08:11:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	#kubuntu has a lot of kubuntu users :)
2006-04-10T14:05:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	(you need multiverse)
2006-04-10T14:06:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	you can put your /etc/apt/sources.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/  if you want.  Enabling multiverse requires more than checking
2006-04-10T14:08:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	it would be a lot easier if you just pastebinned them...
2006-04-10T14:12:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	url?
2006-04-10T14:12:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	are you kidding?
2006-04-10T14:13:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	why would you pastebin ``i'm sure 100% that i've configured synaptic sources well, but no sign of mplayer, all i get is mozilla-mplayer -_-. THAT'S IT !''
2006-04-10T14:13:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' in a terminal and then copy and paste everything into pastebin
2006-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	correct, the purpose of that site is so you don't flood this channel
2006-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	rubso	_jason	check this out http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d11516
2006-04-10T14:17:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	make yourself a new one, and replace your current one.  use the command: gksudo 'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'
2006-04-10T14:18:00.000Z	rubso	_jason	thank you very much ;)
2006-04-10T14:19:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	after you do that, you need to run 'sudo apt-get update'
2006-04-10T14:19:00.000Z	rubso	_jason	never mind i know the rest!
2006-04-10T14:19:00.000Z	_jason	rubso	k
