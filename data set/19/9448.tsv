2007-04-19T16:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	First off I would plug it in, it may "just work"
2007-04-19T16:57:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	it's plugged in (and worked gerat with XP) but xp sxs..
2007-04-19T16:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	look at alsamixer to see if you can see the channel at least
2007-04-19T05:01:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	how can i check the alsamixer?
2007-04-19T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	run "alsamixer" in the terminal
2007-04-19T05:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	Use arrow keys to change volume / channel and the "m" key to mute / unmute
2007-04-19T05:02:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	the problem is that i have an internal sound card aswell (realtek crap) and an addisional SB2 notebook pcmcia (i can only see the realtek in alsamixer)
2007-04-19T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	I have never used a pcmcia card so I am basically trying to figure this out along with you, just so you know :) Have you tried booting with it in?
2007-04-19T05:05:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/87909 its a known bug?
2007-04-19T05:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	Does asoundconf-gtk work for you?
2007-04-19T05:09:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	haven't tested it out yet, i should do this right "sudo apt-get install asoundconf-gtk" right?
2007-04-19T05:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vio	correct
2007-04-19T05:10:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	*installing* i'll come with feedback
2007-04-19T05:10:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	i'll try to logout + in and see if there is any difference..
2007-04-19T05:13:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	no good..
2007-04-19T05:16:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	 when i do a "tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat" i get 0. Realtek ALC202 rev 0   and 1.1: Silicon Laboratory Si3036,8 rev
2007-04-19T05:17:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	(Preferences>Sound) does not properly switch sound cards, is there another way to do this?
2007-04-19T05:23:00.000Z	vio	Jordan_U	 it worked !!! just needed a proper restart
