2008-12-03T05:06:00.000Z	dnyy		How can I format my usb stick in FAT32 through linux?
2008-12-03T05:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/<partition nane>
2008-12-03T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	then run sudo fdisk -l
2008-12-03T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	it will tell you the partition name
2008-12-03T05:08:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	Alright, hold on
2008-12-03T05:10:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	It's telling me it's unable to open /dev/snb
2008-12-03T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	then you need to partition it, you can't open a disk, only partitions
2008-12-03T05:11:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	So I have to create a partition on it before I can format it?
2008-12-03T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	yes, you can ONLY format partitions. Windows says "C drive" which is WRONG. Its a drive with a single partition
2008-12-03T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	you need to partition it, then format the partition
2008-12-03T05:12:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	ah, alright. i'm trying to install ubuntu 8.10 from a USB stick I just bought. CD drives open. So thank ya. :)
2008-12-03T05:12:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	GParted is telling me there's already a partition on it, and the filesystem is fat32. ;o
2008-12-11T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	I use it
2008-12-11T14:18:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	Well when it asks me to pick a driver, only one shows up.  I'm guessing it's the correct one?  I really don't want to mess anything up. :x
2008-12-11T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	just instal the driver with auto hardware detection and it'll install what it needs, make sure you run the app with gksudo
2008-12-11T14:20:00.000Z	dnyy	ActionParsnip	I'm running Xubuntu and gksudo/gedit seem to never do anything. Is there a xfce alternative or something?
2008-12-11T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	sudo apt-get install gksudo maybe (?)
2008-12-11T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	according to one post, xfce uses gtk too
2008-12-11T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dnyy	you run: gksudo envyng-gtk
