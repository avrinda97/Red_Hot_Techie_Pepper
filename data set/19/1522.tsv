2011-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	sounds like grup
2011-05-27T06:28:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	not many quick steps to fixing grub unless you've made a repair disk
2011-05-27T06:28:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	oh ok...i do have a bootable usb with 10.10
2011-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	what nit-wit said
2011-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	thanks
2011-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	You can try to reconfigure it but you may have to simply reinstall
2011-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	have a guide for that?
2011-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	Know though, when it's up again to make a repair cd
2011-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	check msg
2011-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	k
2011-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	im back
2011-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	have that link again?>
2011-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	i guess if the grub reinstall doesnt work i could reinstall OS's
2011-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	zaya	rez410	try that link, if that doesn't help (which it should) then you can try a reinstall but that means something bigger happened.
2011-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	i accidentally closed out before I clicked the link so i lost it
2011-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	nevermind
2011-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	rez410	zaya	thanks for the help
