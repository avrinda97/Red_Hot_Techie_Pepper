2008-11-27T03:33:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 the screen is loading fine now, im logged on from the laptop. but i don't think the graphic card is being recognized as "nvidia" anymore ^^;
2008-11-27T03:36:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 theres version 173, 96 177 , clicking  the first 2 say: not in use, clicking 177 says: another version of this driver is in use

2008-11-27T03:37:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 yes, all of them say "activate", the green button
2008-11-27T03:37:00.000Z	]{53	Update_Manager	what model card do you have?
2008-11-27T03:37:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 GeForce Go 7300   it's worked fine until this dumb problem ;p
2008-11-27T03:38:00.000Z	]{53	Update_Manager	Version 177 works for me.
2008-11-27T03:38:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 it was working (not sure what version), its not a driver problem, because ive been using nvidia propreitary driver for years in UBuntu, but the screen hasn't shutdown like that before... it was like.. i had to "reset" the motherboard before it would work again
2008-11-27T03:39:00.000Z	]{53	Update_Manager	Strange maybe it is a hardware thing and not a software thing....
2008-11-27T03:40:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 I'm going to try sudo nvidia-xconfig  and see what it tells me, see if i can reconfigure it like that. yeah, i just put sysinfo and it still detects the card just fine Wheee!!. The screen is working just fine, but the driver wont work now. Oh well, maybe another reboot! hehe! thank you *nods*
2008-11-27T03:40:00.000Z	]{53	Update_Manager	No problem, I thought you said it wasn't a driver issue. :p
2008-11-27T03:41:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 nvidia-xconfig just told me : VALIDATION ERROR: Data incomplete in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.                       Device section "Configured Video Device" must have a Driver line.
2008-11-27T03:42:00.000Z	]{53	Update_Manager	did you try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"?
2008-11-27T03:42:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 hm, that doesn
2008-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 hm, that doesn (oops) doenst work in ibex anymore, does it? i htought it was depreciated
2008-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	]{53	Update_Manager	Now you are schooling me. :p
2008-11-27T03:45:00.000Z	Update_Manager	]{53	 I told it to use 177, I'm going to reboot and see what it does. I did click "fix x server" from recovery, and thats how I even got gnome to load.  I clicked "back up xorg " when the gnome / X error msg came up. Somehow it iddnt fully work. Anyway I' m going to reboot and see how it goes... cross fingers, people! thanks for the tips, ]{53   :)
