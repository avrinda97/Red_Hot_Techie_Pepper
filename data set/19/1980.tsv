2010-10-30T11:45:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Connor1	it should print the status of your card driver and some more info, but you should run it from ubuntu not from fedora
2010-10-30T11:46:00.000Z	Connor1	ilovefairuz	command not found
2010-10-30T11:46:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Connor1	did you run it from ubuntu?
2010-10-30T11:46:00.000Z	Connor1	ilovefairuz	I don't believe my wireless card is supported by Fedora
2010-10-30T11:48:00.000Z	Connor1	ilovefairuz	what am I looking for?
2010-10-30T11:48:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Connor1	paste the output of lshw -C network to paste.ubuntu.com
2010-10-30T11:49:00.000Z	Connor1	ilovefairuz	fpaste.org/71Cy
2010-10-30T11:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Connor1	both wired and wireless seem to be fine, check: iwlist scan
2010-10-30T11:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Connor1	should scan for available networks
2010-10-30T11:52:00.000Z	Connor1	ilovefairuz	any reason I'm doing this?
2010-10-30T11:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Connor1	doing what? you said earlier you had a wireless problem
