2006-04-13T06:20:00.000Z	Remy		hey guys, as part of an installation I've been told to apply a "patch"  http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/patches/ipaq-0.6-olivier.patch
2006-04-13T06:21:00.000Z	Remy		anyone know how to do this ?
2006-04-13T06:21:00.000Z	Remy		I've tried running "sudo patch patchfile"
2006-04-13T06:21:00.000Z	Remy		but that just sits there doing nothing
2006-04-13T06:21:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	try smoething along the lines of sudo patch -p1 < patchfile
2006-04-13T06:22:00.000Z	Remy	kingspawn	-p1 being ?
2006-04-13T06:22:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	no, patchlevel
2006-04-13T06:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	might be p0
2006-04-13T06:24:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	you have to be in the dir where the stuff to patch is
2006-04-13T06:46:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	whats the error? i havent been following conv.
2006-04-13T06:47:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	what if you run "make clean" anywhere? does it actually do anything?
2006-04-13T06:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	what are you trying to do?
2006-04-13T06:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	im starting to feel intelikey on this one
2006-04-13T06:51:00.000Z	Remy	kingspawn	trying to syncronise an IPAQ h5550 with ubuntu...
2006-04-13T06:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	aha. well, where did you get the patch, whats its name, have you applied it correctly, have you done "man patch" have you read up on how the ipaq integrates with linux?
2006-04-13T06:53:00.000Z	Remy	kingspawn	yes to most of the above... That site where I d/l that man file from has fairly comprehensive details on how to do it, unfortunately they aren't comprehensinve enough for a noobie like myself, so I'm just kinda blundering along :)
2006-04-13T06:54:00.000Z	kingspawn	Remy	go through that stuff that you linked here step by step
2006-04-13T06:55:00.000Z	Remy	kingspawn	, I am... but what I don't understand is where/when do I apply this patch:  http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/usb_linux.php (see under special information for h5550)
