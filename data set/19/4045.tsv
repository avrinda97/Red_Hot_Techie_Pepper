2009-10-21T04:49:00.000Z	PCTeacher012		What is wrong? When i boot my computer up, it is frozen on the "[sdc] assuming driver writethrough" step. How do i fish this?
2009-10-21T04:50:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	disconnect the power cable to sdc, see if it fixes it. If yes, then start troubleshooting
2009-10-21T04:51:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	Funny thing is, SDC is my flash drive?
2009-10-21T04:51:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	then pull the drive before boot, then plug it in and look at the dmesg
2009-10-21T04:51:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	So just unplug it and try rebooting?
2009-10-21T04:52:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	kay, i will let you know how it works. Be back as soon as i reboot, if i reboot and pass through *chuckle*
2009-10-21T04:59:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	I'm a little confused.. what OS are you using at this moment?
2009-10-21T05:00:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	I am running Ubuntu 9.04
2009-10-21T05:00:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	and which is it that will not boot?
2009-10-21T05:01:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	Yea, it still will not boot. It gets stuck on a little white blinking underscore on a black BG
2009-10-21T05:01:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	no, I mean which OS will not boot?
2009-10-21T05:01:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	Oh, Ubuntu 9.04
2009-10-21T05:02:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	you're being obtuse.. you are running 9.04 but 9.04 will not boot..
2009-10-21T05:02:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	No, I'm on ubuntu 9.04 LiveCD
2009-10-21T05:04:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	so you can boot 9.04 live cd but not install.. do I have that right?
2009-10-21T05:04:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	Yes, i can boot off livecd
2009-10-21T05:06:00.000Z	Legendre	PCTeacher012	was the 9.04 install ever working?
2009-10-21T05:07:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	Yes, i used it before i left for a couple dats
2009-10-21T05:30:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	Legendre	So i just let gparted repair my fs. I am going to try to reboot now. If it fails. Ill just restore. For the 4th time (ubuntu is starting to make me mad :\)
