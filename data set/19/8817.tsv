2007-02-02T07:40:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	in setup de wireless is on
2007-02-02T07:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	can you paste 'dmesg' and 'lspci -v' and 'cat /proc/interrupts' to a pastebin?
2008-03-11T23:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	flaky hardware (drive; cable; power cable) attached to ata3 sata port or maybe a kernel bug
2008-03-11T23:33:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	probably a kernel bug because i switch the drive, cable and power cable... motherborad
2008-03-11T23:34:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	i switch all hardware to a new core2duo.... and the problem is same
2008-03-11T23:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	have you tried a different kernel?
2008-03-11T23:35:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	howto i get another kernel?
2008-03-11T23:35:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	and... i have a server with ubuntu 7.10 desktop... and not apresent that problem
2008-03-11T23:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	for gutsy probably the best option is to dwonload the deb of the hardy kernel from packages.ubuntu.com and install it (if possible never tried i build my own kernels)
2008-03-11T23:36:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	u recommend a older version of kernel?
2008-03-11T23:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	you can try with the edgy kernel too
2008-03-11T23:37:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	ok
2008-03-11T23:38:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	its probably a kernel bug alright?
2008-03-11T23:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	i can not know for sure may be bad hardware too as i said but you said you changed all hardware so...
2008-03-11T23:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoFX_SBC	the only way to know for sure is to try another kernel
2008-03-11T23:39:00.000Z	NoFX_SBC	erUSUL	ok, thanks!
