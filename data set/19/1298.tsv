2011-03-10T05:59:00.000Z	drobole		whats the best IRC client for gnome (except irssi)
2011-03-10T05:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	there is no single best app for anything
2011-03-10T05:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	in any OS
2011-03-10T06:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	none and all are best
2011-03-10T06:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	your question is as intelligent as: "what is the best coloutr of the rainbow?"
2011-03-10T06:01:00.000Z	drobole	ActionParsnip	Your wrong
2011-03-10T06:01:00.000Z	drobole	ActionParsnip	Your reply is recursively correct for any question
2011-03-10T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	its not, there is no single best app for anything. Each app has different abilities. Not all users requirements and tastes are identical so there will NEVER be a best
2011-03-10T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	so no, it only applys to "best" questions
2011-03-10T06:02:00.000Z	drobole	ActionParsnip	You know I cant deny that
2011-03-10T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	i know, hence why its a useless question. If youcan constrain it some with things you want the client to do then it is an intelligent question
2011-03-10T06:04:00.000Z	drobole	ActionParsnip	In that case I'd rephrase to "Which gnome IRC clients are bad"
2011-03-10T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	none are bad, some have fewer features but if they give what is required then they are not bad are they
2011-03-10T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	why not try a few for YOURSELF and evaluate. You are using an OS which promotes freedom and choice, yet you wade into an irc channel and ask strangers what you should use. Smacks of Microsoft don't you think??
2011-03-10T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	userfriendliness is entirely tangiable from user to user. One person's easy is another person's hard
2011-03-10T06:08:00.000Z	drobole	ActionParsnip	I'm not convinced you know who you are taking to either tbo
2011-03-10T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	it doesn't matter who you are as it doesn't affect the fact that you are asking questions which cannot be answered due to too many factors
2011-03-10T06:09:00.000Z	drobole	ActionParsnip	I got many interresting answers
2011-03-10T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drobole	great :)
