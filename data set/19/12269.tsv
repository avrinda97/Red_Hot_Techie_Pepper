2007-05-18T12:01:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	So the Ubuntu computer is the VPN _client_?  And you want to connect to a VPN server running Windows XP?
2007-05-18T12:04:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	If you already have the VPN service set up, you just need to enable file-sharing
2007-05-18T12:05:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	Did you want to share files on the Ubuntu VPN server? Or did you want to make the VPN clients' file shares visible to each other in the Windows Network Neighbourhood browser?
2007-05-18T12:12:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	Basically, Samba provides a WINS server, which keeps track of Windows clients and lets them see each other in the Network Neighbourhood browser
2007-05-18T12:13:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	Once Samba is up and running, you can edit your pptpd.conf file to get WINS working over the VPN connection
2007-05-18T12:16:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	When the Windows client connects to the VPN, _all_ their traffic goes through the VPN connection. So if the client cannot connect to the Internet, it means the VPN server isn't forwarding their traffic properly
2007-05-18T12:16:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	You can fix this by enabling NAT on the VPNserver
2007-05-18T12:17:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	You can install the 'ipmasq' package to turn on NAT. That's all you need to do
2007-05-18T12:17:00.000Z	nailbiter	Sam_	That's right. "apt-get install ipmasq".
