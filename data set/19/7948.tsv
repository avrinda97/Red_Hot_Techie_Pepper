2007-08-20T05:20:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		Hi everyone, how do I make ubuntu prioritize my wireless network?
2007-08-20T05:22:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		It just seems to randomly connect to whatever network it can, that happens to be a slow unsecured one. I'd like it to try conneting to mine first.
2007-08-20T05:23:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	once you connect to it once, it should automatically connect to it
2007-08-20T05:23:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	if you have multiple ones, try using wifi-radar
2007-08-20T05:24:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	that might be it :D
2007-08-20T05:27:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	So when I disable roaming, how do I select WPA?
2007-08-20T05:27:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	It only lets me pick WEP hex and WEP ascii.
2007-08-20T05:28:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	click on the wireless network you want to join (when you right click on your little nm-applet in your panel) it should automatically pop up asking you what kind of encryption would you like to use to join
2007-08-20T05:29:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	are you sure your card supports WPA?
2007-08-20T05:29:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	It does.
2007-08-20T05:29:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	hmm... have you tried sudo iwlist [interface]  scan ?
2007-08-20T05:29:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	I can connect if I pick it myself like you described.
2007-08-20T05:30:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	It just switches back to the unsecured one after restarts.
2007-08-20T05:30:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	hmm... that is really weird lol... maybe its choosing the unsecured network cause it cant log on to the preferred?
2007-08-20T05:31:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	But it can.
2007-08-20T05:31:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	when i choose a WPA, it will automatically ask me to enter in a password for the default keyring, and if it redetects the network, it will ask me for the pass... its not asking you to do that?
2007-08-20T05:31:00.000Z	m0u5e	Ar-Pharazon	hmm thats weird :X im as stumped as you, have you tried forums to see if this problem exists with anyone else?
2007-08-20T05:32:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	When I try to connect to it it does ask for a pass.
2007-08-20T05:32:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	m0u5e	Nope I didn't try the forums.
