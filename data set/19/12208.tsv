2008-10-10T00:38:00.000Z	H|V_3ala2		!bios
2008-10-10T00:38:00.000Z	H|V_3ala2		i have a problem with my bios
2008-10-10T00:39:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	this channel is for Ubuntu questions, though
2008-10-10T00:41:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	that in itself is not normally a problem
2008-10-10T00:43:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	what do you see after that?
2008-10-10T00:44:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	what graphics card do you have?
2008-10-10T00:47:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	did you say you can login in text mode?
2008-10-10T00:48:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	I want you to try and edit your X configuration. First, create a backup with 'cd /etc/X11 ; cp xorg.conf xorg.conf-backup'
2008-10-10T00:50:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	run 'sudo nano xorg.conf' and find the line Section "Device"
2008-10-10T00:53:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	have you found the line I asked you to find?
2008-10-10T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	insert the line   Driver "vesa"
2008-10-10T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	before the EndSection line
2008-10-10T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	then reboot
2008-10-10T00:55:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	no
2008-10-10T00:55:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	I told you very clearly what to do
2008-10-10T00:56:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	yes I did. How can you misread this to mean "I just type vesa"?
2008-10-10T00:57:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	I told you to run 'sudo nano xorg.conf'
2008-10-10T00:59:00.000Z	soundray	H|V_3ala2	look, I gave you the clearest instructions that I could. If you can't follow those, you're on your own.
