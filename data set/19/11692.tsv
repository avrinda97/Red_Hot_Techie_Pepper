2005-12-07T06:00:00.000Z	Hybridx0		is there any reason why i would not want to install grub into the MBR?

2005-12-07T06:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	don't if you are dual-booting
2005-12-07T06:01:00.000Z	Hybridx0		im tri-booting
2005-12-07T06:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	otherwise I believe MBR is the best place
2005-12-07T06:01:00.000Z	Hybridx0		lol :)
2005-12-07T06:02:00.000Z	Hybridx0		xenguy so the mbr is a good place for tri-booting?
2005-12-07T06:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	I think that is the opposite of what I said previously...
2005-12-07T06:03:00.000Z	Hybridx0	Xenguy	i didnt understand ur answer
2005-12-07T06:03:00.000Z	Hybridx0	Xenguy	what would u reccomend i do then?
2005-12-07T06:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	I'm not an expert with GRUB, all I recall is that if you are dual (or more) booting with other OS's, then I don't think you want GRUB/Lilo on the MBR...
2005-12-07T06:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	you should seek other opinions on this :-)
2005-12-07T06:04:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	I just wanted to warn you what *not* to do
2005-12-07T06:04:00.000Z	Hybridx0	Xenguy	thanks, i will/ and i have heard a few objections to dual booting with mbr
2005-12-07T06:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hybridx0	google is your friend (in this case a good dose of patience helps too, to find the correct instructions)
2005-12-07T06:05:00.000Z	Hybridx0	Xenguy	yes, and i am in no hurry so i will consider every possible way
2005-12-07T06:06:00.000Z	Hybridx0	Xenguy	thanks anyway :)
