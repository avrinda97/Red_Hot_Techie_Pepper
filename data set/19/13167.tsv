2005-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	Predius		i'd sure like spotlight to be ported to linux
2005-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	Predius		i know about locate, but this updates it automatically
2005-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	Predius		yeah, i could use cron
2005-05-10T05:28:00.000Z	Predius		but it's not automatic.
2005-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	Predius		=(
2005-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	Predius		why isn't beagle on the ubuntu reps?
2005-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	Predius		I though I had seen 0.9
2005-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	Predius		not 0.0.9
2005-05-10T05:32:00.000Z	Predius		meh, I never get ideas on what to program
2005-05-10T05:32:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	depends on what kind of programs you want to make, by categories.
2005-05-10T05:47:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	isn't that CTRL-ALT-Space restarts X only?
2005-05-10T05:47:00.000Z	Predius	_ubuntu	also MS changes it from time to time
2005-05-10T05:48:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	I know, that's why I formatted one of my computers to test out Ubuntu/Kubuntu and found I fall in love with it, so I am going to test all things that I need, then I will change all my home computer to Ubuntu/Kubuntu
2005-05-10T05:54:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	hahahahahaha...nice one
2005-05-10T05:55:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	just to confirm, KDE doesn't have shortcut key like what gnome has for changing applications to different virtual desktos?
2005-05-10T05:56:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	is it good?
2005-05-10T05:57:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	I can install from synaptic right? and then I change the desktop management to fluxbox right?
2005-05-10T05:58:00.000Z	_ubuntu	Predius	thanks, let me try...
