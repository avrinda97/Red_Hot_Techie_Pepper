2005-11-08T09:29:00.000Z	zooko		Does anyone know how to go about debugging my problem of "ethernet stopped working when I upgraded to Breezy"?
2005-11-08T09:29:00.000Z	zooko		One idea is to downgrade to Hoary...
2005-11-08T09:29:00.000Z	zooko		Another is to figure out what the modern syntax is to pass irq options to kernel modules...
2005-11-08T09:30:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	you could always recompile your kernel...
2005-11-08T09:31:00.000Z	zooko	MrCroup	I'm using the standard Ubuntu kernel.
2005-11-08T09:32:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	sorry, thought you had a working boot
2005-11-08T09:32:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	er, working with network
2005-11-08T09:32:00.000Z	zooko	MrCroup	Yes, it boots.  Everything works fine except no network.
2005-11-08T09:32:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	so how is the nic different?
2005-11-08T09:34:00.000Z	zooko	MrCroup	that's the thing -- this is the same machine, same nic, etc., that worked with Hoary.
2005-11-08T09:35:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	ok so what modules was in use by hoary and are there any errors in dmesg?
2005-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	zooko	MrCroup	there are no errors.  Unfortunately I do not have extant logs from Hoary.
2005-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	what does lspci show for your nic
2005-11-08T09:40:00.000Z	zooko	MrCroup	lspci agrees with /proc/interrupts -- my eth card is using IRQ 23.
2005-11-08T09:43:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	any chance of changing the irq for the nic in the bios and sidestepping the problem altogether?
2005-11-08T09:44:00.000Z	zooko	MrCroup	I've already tried 50 different combinations of BIOS settings and passing pci=routeirq or not.
2005-11-08T09:44:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	watch it be the patch cable... ;)
2005-11-08T09:45:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	especially if you can lsmod the driver and ping the interface
2005-11-08T09:45:00.000Z	MrCroup	zooko	can you ping the interface?
