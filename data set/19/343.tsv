2012-04-04T03:44:00.000Z	Edler		i'm on 10.04LTS
2012-04-04T03:44:00.000Z	Edler		is that lucid ?
2012-04-04T03:44:00.000Z	Edler		okay
2012-04-04T03:44:00.000Z	Edler		well how can i get php-fpm working on it then
2012-04-04T03:45:00.000Z	Edler		okay
2012-04-04T03:45:00.000Z	Edler		any tutorial where i can do that ?
2012-04-04T03:46:00.000Z	Edler		ah i'll just download and figure it out
2012-04-04T03:46:00.000Z	Edler		also
2012-04-04T03:46:00.000Z	Edler		why is php 5.3.2 the latest in lucid
2012-04-04T03:47:00.000Z	Edler		is there any way to install later other than compiling from source ?
2012-04-04T03:48:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	which version would you like?
2012-04-04T03:49:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	not really... there's special ways to ensure that doesn't happen
2012-04-04T03:50:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	you just add the packages you want to the end of the deb line
2012-04-04T03:51:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	ahh okay! this would install php 5.4 on nattydeb http://apt.damz.org/ubuntu natty php54
2012-04-04T03:52:00.000Z	Edler	monotoko_	remember i'm on lucid
2012-04-04T03:52:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	remove php5 first: apt-get remove --purge php5
2012-04-04T03:52:00.000Z	Edler	monotoko_	would that disrupt anything else ? such as added php modules ?
2012-04-04T03:54:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	we can try just upgrading it
2012-04-04T03:55:00.000Z	monotoko_	Edler	I mean add the new repo, then do an upgrade
