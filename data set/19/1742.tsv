2011-10-23T20:10:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	?
2011-10-23T20:11:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	do you want to run a script when you shutdown?
2011-10-23T20:11:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	i would prefer to run it when i log out since it is specific to the user, but i could do it on shutdown if i have to
2011-10-23T20:12:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	theadmin: basically,i want to run kdestroy and delete a file from my home

2011-10-23T20:15:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	basically, i want to run kdestroy and delete a file from my home
2011-10-23T20:16:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	delete a file on shutdown? lol.. how practical is that?
2011-10-23T20:17:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	i create a link to a remote location during the session and i want to remove it as it shuts down and kdestroy terminates the connection
2011-10-23T20:17:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	i just want to know how to do it
2011-10-23T20:18:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	i thought kde takes care of all that.. this isn't really ubuntu related.. perhaps #kde or #linux more fans can help out with this.. cuse the only thing i can think of is checking out what kde can unmount stuff that it mounts
2011-10-23T20:19:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	it's not kde, kdestroy is related to kerberos
2011-10-23T20:19:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	i'm running ubuntu with unity
2011-10-23T20:20:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	i just want to know how to run scripts on shutdown/logout on ubuntu when you log out from unity
2011-10-23T20:20:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	look into /etc/init/ -- there's a new style of using .confs or something..
2011-10-23T20:21:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	ok... do you have any idea what it's called? i've been googling extensively but i couldn't find much
2011-10-23T20:22:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	did u look at find /etc/|grep -i xsession ?
2011-10-23T20:23:00.000Z	yagoo	Crazed_	try adding your own input after any of the Xsession scripts parses the home <~/.xsession ?>
2011-10-23T20:27:00.000Z	Crazed_	yagoo	mneptok: thanks for the help, i'll try that
