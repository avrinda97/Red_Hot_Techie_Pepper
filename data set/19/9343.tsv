2008-01-17T03:09:00.000Z	bjames		is there a Linux app that can scan files (that may be concatonated) and figure out what the file(s) may be?
2008-01-17T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	you can run "file weirdofile" to find out what the weirdo file seems to be.. if that's what you mean
2008-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	I don't think it will work when more than one are joined though.. I think it expects one filetype per file
2008-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	that seems to have worked
2008-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	it seems to have partially worked - it's picked up the first of the concatonated files
2008-01-17T03:13:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	it appears to be a zip file, if I change the extension and open it only shows one file (I am expecting three)
2008-01-17T03:13:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	is there any way I can find the size and "dd" the other files from the conglomerate?
2008-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	yes.. I think it looks at the first bytes in the file.. but I'm not sure.. going a scan of several joined files will be trickier.. perhaps you'll have to write this tool yourself.. I can't really see how it's useful in day-to-day usage
2008-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	I'm looking at reverse-engineering my router firmware (at least in part) as I suspect it has some GPL code in it
2008-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	who is this evil person that has joined your precious, but still unknown files, that you need so badly? =)
2008-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	I'm looking at reverse-engineering my router firmware (at least in part) as I suspect it has some GPL code in it
2008-01-17T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	oh.. well.. you're trying to split the firmware binary into separate files? .. well.. that sounds like a manual job to me.. a boring job at that =)
2008-01-17T03:16:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	I guess so
2008-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	maybe if I extract the known file from the file and create a zip from it, then compare this to the original and try again
2008-01-17T03:18:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	although this depends on knowing the exact format of the zip
2008-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	I wouldn't really know where to start.. sorry.. and it
2008-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	and it's hard to come up with some hints when I have no idea what the file looks like or what it does
2008-01-17T05:18:00.000Z	bjames	Slart	I've been hacking at it for a while and there doesn't appear to be a simple solution, maybe a project for another day
2008-01-17T05:18:00.000Z	Slart	bjames	you're welcome
