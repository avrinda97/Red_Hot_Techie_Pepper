2012-01-19T09:07:00.000Z	rodayo		Hi all, I want to create a partition on my hard-disk (somehting like 40 GB / 500GB) to install windows on. I've never used gparted before and I see that /dev/sda1 is my main partition. I can't do anything unless I unmount it. Is this safe to do(unmounting your main partition)?

2012-01-19T09:08:00.000Z	rodayo	ubluntu	I don't know that the windows installer offers anything to create a partition...as far as I know it doesn't
2012-01-19T09:09:00.000Z	ubluntu	rodayo	you can make a live-usb/cd boot from it and do what you want with gparted
2012-01-19T09:09:00.000Z	ubluntu		I mean an ubuntu live-cd
2012-01-19T09:09:00.000Z	ubluntu		!gnomefallback
2012-01-19T09:09:00.000Z	ubluntu		hrm.
2012-01-19T09:10:00.000Z	rodayo	ubluntu	are you saying to create a gparted live cd/usb?
2012-01-19T09:10:00.000Z	ubluntu		no. the ubuntu live-cd has gparted on it
2012-01-19T09:11:00.000Z	rodayo	ubluntu	so use the ubuntu-livecd to create a partition. then abort the installation and put in the windows-usb?
2012-01-19T09:12:00.000Z	ubluntu		there is no installation if you just boot a live-cd just use gparted then shut it down
2012-01-19T09:12:00.000Z	ubluntu		use the option on the menu like " try ubuntu with out installing "
2012-01-19T09:12:00.000Z	rodayo	ubluntu	oooo, I understand now
2012-01-19T09:13:00.000Z	rodayo	ubluntu	thank you i will try that
2012-01-19T09:14:00.000Z	rodayo	ubluntu	i have an old ubuntu 7.07 cd. Will that suffice?
2012-01-19T09:14:00.000Z	rodayo		7.04*
2012-01-19T09:16:00.000Z	ubluntu	rodayo	yea
