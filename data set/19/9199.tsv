2008-09-01T12:29:00.000Z	lardarse	devin	you need to make it chainload it

2008-09-01T12:31:00.000Z	lardarse	devin	you need root to set the partition to use

2008-09-01T12:39:00.000Z	lardarse	devin	do you use anything from within windows to access your linux partitions? (as it may change the answer i need to give if you do)
2008-09-01T12:42:00.000Z	lardarse	devin	also, is this xp or vista you're trying to add?
2008-09-01T12:43:00.000Z	devin	lardarse	yes actually i do, but can't think of the name of the app right off hand
2008-09-01T12:43:00.000Z	devin	lardarse	xp
2008-09-01T12:44:00.000Z	lardarse	devin	ok,. that makes things simpler
