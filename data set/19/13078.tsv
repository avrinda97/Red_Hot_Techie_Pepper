2005-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	shorty114		are dual procs easy to configure?
2005-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	sure they are (at least on my dual-G5 mac)
2005-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	i'm thinking of buying a machine with dual 3.2 P4's
2005-08-29T16:27:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	np at all, just use apt-get to install your smp kernel, and you're in business
2005-08-29T16:27:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	sweet, thanks.
2005-10-15T16:02:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	yes, but it's better to get it from azureus.sourceforge.net
2005-10-15T16:02:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	k, thanks.
2005-10-15T16:36:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	please dont paste in here
2005-10-15T16:38:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	it's the J2RE one, right?
2005-10-15T16:39:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	for the runtime, yes
2005-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	i dpkg -i'd the package file, and it went through alright, but when i try to run azureus again, it can't find the java binary
2005-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	use synaptic to get rid of all your gnu java stuff
2005-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	java-common?
2005-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	just remove all java stuff (search in 'pkg names and contents") and reinstall your javadeb
2005-10-15T16:47:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	do i want to remove java-common?
2005-10-15T16:48:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	yes
2005-10-15T16:51:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	same problem when i try to run azureus
2005-10-15T16:51:00.000Z	nalioth	shorty114	you probably have not removed all your java
2005-10-15T16:52:00.000Z	shorty114	nalioth	i removed java-common, another java package
