2011-03-04T13:49:00.000Z	shijie		my laptop is acer 4741G GT415 while I cannot install the video driver
2011-03-04T13:49:00.000Z	shijie		both nvidia drivers also recommended drivers
2011-03-04T13:50:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	please don't repeat over and over, if someone can help, they probably will. It sounds like you installed the wrong video driver
2011-03-04T13:53:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	it's always better to install the drivers that ubuntu suggests, since when you update, ubuntu knows how to keep them updated with everything else. If you use the drivers from nvidia, it might work now, but once you get a kernel update, you will have to install them again
2011-03-04T13:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	did the drivers ever work, or is this a fresh install?
2011-03-04T13:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	the newer cards are not always as well supported as the older cards
2011-03-04T14:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	I've never heard of a .run file, but it doesn't sound like something you install
2011-03-04T14:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	that's what I'm looking into right now
2011-03-04T14:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	I'm thinking with that, you need to sudo chmod +x and the ./nvidia_linux_whatever
2011-03-04T14:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	did you see this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1592955
2011-03-04T14:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	did your friend install from wubi?
2011-03-04T14:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	the only reason I ask is that wubi is kind of notorious for making dysfunctional systems
2011-03-04T14:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	shijie	sorry I can't be more helpful
