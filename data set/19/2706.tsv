2010-02-10T03:15:00.000Z	archboxman	LonelyDragon	I loaded my laptop with debian so it may not be in that location...
2010-02-10T03:21:00.000Z	LonelyDragon	archboxman	:  I don't see any proprietary drivers used on this system...

2010-02-10T03:38:00.000Z	archboxman	LonelyDragon	I would say you have done a lot with your current setup of eubuntu and may have played with xorg file caused problems...
2010-02-10T03:40:00.000Z	archboxman	LonelyDragon	your to backup your xorg.conf when moving the file or editing it...should have done that if you planned to edit it...
2010-02-10T03:42:00.000Z	archboxman	LonelyDragon	the idea is to backup every conf file you plan to edit...
