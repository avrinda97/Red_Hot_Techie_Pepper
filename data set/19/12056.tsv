2010-11-12T11:19:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	once installed to cleans all that out
2010-11-12T11:20:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	well 10.10 shouldent have anynold images

2010-11-12T11:20:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	being the last kernel update didnt leave the old one behind due to a expolite so it auto removed it
2010-11-12T11:21:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	normly it leave the old behind just in case you have issues
2010-11-12T11:21:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	well you can set the check whenever you like weekly daly montly
2010-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	when it looks for updates
2010-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	oof course you dont have to do it right then it just tells you they are there
2010-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	but always a good idea to stay updated
2010-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	check is a good idea to hit before updating
2010-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	make shure everything is still where it should be
2010-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	or it might try to get something thats not there or moved
2010-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	gogeta	chandrageetha	and fail
