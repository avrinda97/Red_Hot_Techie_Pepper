2008-11-26T06:33:00.000Z	tiredbones		how do i create sdb in /dev
2008-11-26T06:33:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	it should already be created when it's plugged in
2008-11-26T06:37:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	i have an old hard drive that I'm trying to mount and it does not get recognized when it's plugged in.
2008-11-26T06:37:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	usb?
2008-11-26T06:37:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	no
2008-11-26T06:37:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	are you sure it's spinning up then?
2008-11-26T06:38:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	and is your bios set to auto-find it?
2008-11-26T06:38:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	i realize these may be somewhat silly questions, but i'd rather err on the side of rational, not irrational :)
2008-11-26T06:39:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	how do you check to see if it is spinning up?
2008-11-26T06:39:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	do i have to boot up to look at the bios?
2008-11-26T06:39:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	when you turn the computer on without it, listen for all of the things that are turning on: the PSU, the CPU fan, any system fans, any other hard drives - then listen for the spin of THAT hard drive - does it have a little green light on it, perhaps?
2008-11-26T06:40:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	yah, during POST just press DEL or F2
2008-11-26T06:40:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	well let me reboot then.
2008-11-26T06:40:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	ok
2009-03-06T02:55:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	are you a part of /etc/sudoers?
2009-03-06T02:56:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	i use to be. this is my home pc.
2009-03-06T02:58:00.000Z	Gnea	tiredbones	you need to be able to check to see if you're part of it or not - if you can't use another account on the system to check, then the livecd should be able to show it
2009-03-06T03:01:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	and Droopsta915, i think i know what i did wrong. I add a user called admin. When I realized that my user password did authority was i then sign on as admin. things worked under admin. so i commented out the admin user in the passwrd file. when i sign back on to the system with my user ps, thing still didn't work. now I'm out of luck.
2009-03-06T03:05:00.000Z	tiredbones	Gnea	and Droopsta915,  Thanks for your time. After supper I 'll try my to recover from installed cd.
