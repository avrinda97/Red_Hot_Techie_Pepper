2006-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	aquafina	Jeruvy	and i dont like the channel/nick list on the left. i like them on the bottom like earlier...

2006-07-19T09:05:00.000Z	aquafina	Jeruvy	sorry, this is xchat-gnome.. what is teh package name for the normal xchat?
2006-07-19T09:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	aquafina	ok, I can understand you may not like it.  I don't use xchat myself.
2006-07-19T09:05:00.000Z	aquafina	Jeruvy	ok
2006-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	aquafina	Jeruvy	i'll see if i can work this out.
2006-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	Jeruvy	aquafina	you could use the irc in the help doc to ask some questions.
2006-07-19T09:14:00.000Z	aquafina	Jeruvy	finally installed the correct xchat.. it was in universe or multiverse :D Feels much better
2006-07-19T09:14:00.000Z	Jeruvy	aquafina	distro's make installations fun! :)
2006-07-19T09:15:00.000Z	aquafina	Jeruvy	well. i thought xchat would be installed by default since the first page after starting Firefox talks about #ubuntu
