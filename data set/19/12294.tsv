2006-10-07T14:52:00.000Z	JoshIRL		I need some DNS help, if anyone was here last night you know my story. I cehecked and i can connect to a RAW ip but i can't connect to a www. url, if i do it takes a while, no gaim or anything can connect, and my repositorys work. Help? >_ >
2006-10-07T14:52:00.000Z	JoshIRL		Yes, that's what i meant by raw ip.
2006-10-07T14:53:00.000Z	JoshIRL		if i nslookup site.com, use the ip, i can go there no problem.
2006-10-07T14:54:00.000Z	JoshIRL		Yeah, i've done it, and that's all taht's in there.
2006-10-07T14:54:00.000Z	JoshIRL		Perhaps if i reinstall ubuntu while my modem is connected to that pc? :S
2006-10-07T14:55:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	just for grins put the  ip and  name of  site.com  into your  /etc/hosts  and try the url and see if it works
2006-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	i  thought the linux box was connected to the modem
2006-10-07T14:57:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	no you modem wont be dialed in during the main portion of install only during (possibly) updates
2006-10-07T14:57:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	brb
2006-10-07T14:59:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	execute  ping  -Bd  68.178.253.213 and get 30-40 displays and compare the  ms  time at the end of the line and see how much it varies
2006-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	i dont understand i thought you were on the connection giving the problem
2006-10-07T15:02:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	and linux is where
2006-10-07T15:02:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	is linux   machine connected to modem
2006-10-07T15:03:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	so you r moving the modem back and forth between windows and linux correct
2006-10-07T15:05:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	ok  that test on linux would tell you basically the ms response time for about a minute of pings  to    site.com   and I  was  wondering what the spread was
2006-10-07T15:05:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	not a bad idea just make things complicated
2006-10-07T15:06:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	brb  wife need me she is on crutches
2006-10-07T15:19:00.000Z	jtholmes	JoshIRL	i will have  some info for you in a sec
