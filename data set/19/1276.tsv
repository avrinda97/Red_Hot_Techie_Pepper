2011-12-23T06:26:00.000Z	ShawnRisk		I am using a Brother-HL-5250DN with Ubuntu 11.10 and not able to print at all, any reason why?
2011-12-23T06:27:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	does your printer show up in System>Administration>Printing ?
2011-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	yes
2011-12-23T06:31:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	does your printer appear in the print dialog from an application (like gedit)?
2011-12-23T06:32:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	yes but says unable to locate printer
2011-12-23T06:34:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	it's a different model printer, but same make.  See if it helps you: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1662061
2011-12-23T06:37:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	I am using the old desktop so I might not have the same printer program.  I am not sure how to edit the settings of the printer
2011-12-23T06:39:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	System>Administration>Printing>(right-click your printer)>(click "Properties")
2011-12-23T06:40:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	there is only applications and places and no other menu
2011-12-23T06:41:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	when I asked you if the printer showed up in the System>Administration>Printing dialog, how did you pull it up?
2011-12-23T06:42:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	Applications > System Tools > System Settings (Click Printers)
2011-12-23T06:45:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	from inside there, right-click the printer and click Properties.  (I don't have the latest release, so this might not work, but give it a try for me.)
2011-12-23T06:47:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	no menu showing up when I do that
2011-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	sorry then, I don't know enough about the new release to help you further.  Ask again in a few minutes and maybe someone else will be more informed.
2011-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	which version you use?
2011-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	Maverick 10.10
2011-12-23T06:50:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	I am just using the classic desktop
2011-12-23T06:52:00.000Z	brightspark	ShawnRisk	The classic desktop is similar but not identical.  I can't help you further since I don't know how properties are adjusted in the new version.
2011-12-23T07:01:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	brightspark	I am using CUPS if that helps, and the connection says: dnssd://Brother%20HL-5250DN%20series._pdl-datastream._tcp.local/
