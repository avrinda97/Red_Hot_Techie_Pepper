2011-10-10T14:13:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	sudo service networking restart
2011-10-10T14:16:00.000Z	pitlimit	theadmin	is there another way?
2011-10-10T14:16:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	Try "network" instead of "networking"
2011-10-10T14:25:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	No, ETH is ETHernet
2011-10-10T14:25:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	wlan is Wireless LAN
2011-10-10T14:26:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	Depends on your wireless drivers, honestly, but most of the time ethX is wired
2011-10-10T14:28:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	suspend to RAM or to disk?
2011-10-10T14:28:00.000Z	pitlimit	theadmin	well I think RAM because I want to shut my laptop lid and be able to open it and start fairly quickly
2011-10-10T14:28:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	Sounds like a bug to me then, not much I can help with, honestly
2011-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	pitlimit	theadmin	actually, I thought suspending was a common problem amongst all Ubuntu users
2011-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	theadmin	pitlimit	It is.
