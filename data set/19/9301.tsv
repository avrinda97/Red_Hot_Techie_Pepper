2006-11-27T11:06:00.000Z	Winand		I don't want to reboot just to have my mouse working
2006-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	Celldweller		well
2006-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	Celldweller		it sees your mouse
2006-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	Celldweller		obviously something happened when it was probing for it
2006-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	Winand	Celldweller	I've used my mouse with  ubuntu for like 2 days
2006-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	Celldweller		just try it unless u are doing something important
2006-11-27T11:08:00.000Z	Winand		then I clicked somewhere

2006-11-27T11:08:00.000Z	Winand		and now the mouse thinks i'm moving an icon or something
2006-11-27T11:08:00.000Z	Celldweller		just reinstall the mouse driver
2006-11-27T11:08:00.000Z	Winand		how do you do that celldweller
