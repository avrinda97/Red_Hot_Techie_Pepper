2009-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	SharpRain		How do I set up a Virtual Machine or sandbox?
2009-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	SharpRain		Hmm
2009-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	SharpRain		I didn't know
2009-09-14T12:14:00.000Z	SharpRain		that there was any pay software for Linux
2009-09-14T12:15:00.000Z	SharpRain		I will get it, thanks

2009-09-14T12:16:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	Well, it uses CPU, RAM, disk space, network bandwidth...
2009-09-14T12:19:00.000Z	SharpRain	jmarsden	Yeah, but I can do anything like install software etc and It won't screw up anything but the vbox thing?
2009-09-14T12:19:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	Yes, it lets you create virtual machines and run them, and what you install inside them goes into a big file that is a "virtual disk", so it won't affect how your main host machine is configured.
2009-09-14T12:21:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox
2009-09-14T12:21:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	Yes
2009-09-14T12:43:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	It depends what kind of experimentation you have in mind :)
2009-09-14T12:44:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	One creates a virtual machine, the other just... creates a new user :)  Totally different things.
2009-09-14T12:46:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	?  How are you creating the user?  Just sudo useradd -m fred     # to create a new user named fred
2009-09-14T12:47:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	Not unless the two users cooperate to share them in some way, no.
2009-09-14T12:50:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	There are no C and D drives in Linux, the new user will use the parts of the Linux filesystem he has permission to use.  By default his home dir will be /home/fred if his username is fred
2009-09-14T12:51:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	No, "C Drive" is a Windows concept!  You mount other partitions and then you can use them
2009-09-14T12:53:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	It is whereever you mounted it :)  That's a common place to mount stuff.
2009-09-14T13:09:00.000Z	jmarsden	SharpRain	This is #ubuntu, not #pogostick ? :)
