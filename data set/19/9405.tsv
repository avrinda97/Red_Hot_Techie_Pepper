2006-11-11T14:17:00.000Z	shwouchk		If i dont set a root password, then there is no way for anyone/anyhow to log in as root, right? (excluding getting root from another user)
2006-11-11T14:18:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	if they have physical access to the machine, they always can
2006-11-11T14:18:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	I meant someone from the net
2006-11-11T14:19:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	they won't be able to login as root, no. but then you shouldn't allow SSH to root even if you're on a system where the root account *is* accessible
2006-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	root can log into a tty w/o a password?
2006-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	uh? no, i never said that
2006-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	in Ubuntu, root cannot login directly at all, by default. in other distributions, it can -- but what i'm saying is that you should *never* have root enabled for remote access anyway
2006-11-11T14:21:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	oh, yeah
2007-10-20T19:29:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	may that sound like https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/99356 or some of the related bugs?
2007-10-20T19:31:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	checking, thanks
2007-10-20T19:33:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	no - the bug there is for charachrers repeating, wheres on my end ALL characters are printed as caps.
2007-10-20T19:34:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	but you also said your cursor keys make the cursor "jump around", which sounded like the system thinks they're kept pressed
2007-10-20T19:35:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	yes but they don't jump around in the same sense - they jump to a weird location and my screen becomes partly garbled
2007-10-20T19:35:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	AND, this  is on gusty whereas that was on feisty
2007-10-20T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	shwouchk	only thing i can suggest trying is "noapic" as a kernel parameter... it's the standard suggestion when something that sounds kernel-related goes wrong and one has no clue :)
2007-10-20T19:42:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	lol, how aweful... I'll try though, thanks
2007-10-20T19:46:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	weirdly enough, if I ssh to localhost, I can edit fine
2007-10-20T19:51:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	even more astonishing is that after a second reboot all that went away
2007-10-20T19:51:00.000Z	shwouchk	LjL	:D
