2011-08-18T21:55:00.000Z	gp5st		I installed gnome-randr-applet but i can' figure out how to add it to the panel (the obvious method doesn't work) ubunut 11.04
2011-08-18T21:57:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	do you *know the command, my typo.
2011-08-18T22:37:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	it's ok
2011-08-18T21:57:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	i nkow of a way to add xrandr to it. no the command for the gnome version?
2011-08-18T21:59:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	i know how to execute randr from the command line. i was hoping to use an applet
2011-08-18T22:00:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	i figured as much, but i was wondering what the command is to run the gui randr program.
2011-08-18T22:00:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	i didn't know there was a gui for it
2011-08-18T22:01:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	ohh, my bad. I thought you had installed a gui program for it. so you want to know what gui9 programs are available then?
2011-08-18T22:01:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	i installed an applet, which i guess in the strictest sense is a gui program.  Right clicking on the bar and adding an applet doesn't show the randr applet in the list of available ones
2011-08-18T22:03:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	i see. what is the name of the applet.
2011-08-18T22:09:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	did you log out or reboot?
2011-08-18T22:11:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	why would I do that? it's an applet:-p
2011-08-18T22:11:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	no, i havn't. i'll have to check it once i do
2011-08-18T22:21:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	sorry man, i cant find anything on that prog. if you alt-f2 and then type in gnome-randr-applet, what happens?
2011-08-18T22:22:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	it can't find the program
2011-08-18T22:23:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	ok, let's go another route, maybe we can find another program to do a similar task? or do you need this to be available at all times on the app bar?
2011-08-18T22:26:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	so when you right click the top bar, and choose add to panel, it just simply does not exist...
2011-08-18T22:28:00.000Z	gp5st	hylian	yeah
2011-08-18T22:37:00.000Z	hylian	gp5st	the only other option i can see would be to go into the system menu, under preferences and drag the monitors icon or the nvidia/ati icons frm there to your top nav bar, which then would atleast give you quick access to it. sorry man that's the best i can do. as a side note you might try removing and then re-installing the app.
