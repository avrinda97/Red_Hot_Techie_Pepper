2006-08-23T09:02:00.000Z	bruenig		64 bit is a beating. Get 32 bit
2006-08-23T09:03:00.000Z	bruenig		too much work for 64 bit and no pay off
2006-08-23T09:03:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	you using 64 bit ?
2007-05-16T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	do grep -l resolv.conf /etc/init.d/* and see which script is doing it
2007-05-16T08:24:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	its pppd-dns
2007-05-16T08:25:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	so open it up and be careful, but comment out the offending lines
2007-05-16T08:26:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	but i dont see the place where it exactly writes to resolv.conf in that file
2007-05-16T08:27:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	i get 192.168.1.1 as the DNS address in the resolv.conf automatically during startup its because of the peer dyns i believe but i dont know how to stop it
2007-05-16T08:27:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	do some ctrl + f to find where it says resolv.conf
2007-09-13T10:44:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	bittornado, rtorrent, deluge, transmission
2007-11-15T08:14:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	how do i start it then
2007-11-15T08:15:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	even when i start it next time i reboot it does not run
2007-11-15T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	there is probably a daemon in /etc/init.d, but it might also be an issue with how cron is configured
2007-11-15T08:15:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	this is what i get it fails :(
2007-11-15T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	yeah that looks to be the problem
2007-11-15T08:16:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	any idea on how to rectify it ?
2007-11-15T08:16:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	read through the script, see where it is having problems
2007-11-15T08:17:00.000Z	linux__alien	bruenig	are there any logs for this?
2007-11-15T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	linux__alien	read through the script in /etc/init.d
