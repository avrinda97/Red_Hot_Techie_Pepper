2004-10-02T13:38:00.000Z	phin		is adding kdrive to the next release something i would probly be better off bringing up in the mailing list?
2004-10-02T13:39:00.000Z	plovs	phin	why would you like to have kdrive? I used it and it is not *that* special 
2004-10-02T13:40:00.000Z	phin	plovs	when your on a k6-2 300 it is
2004-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	plovs	phin	how much memory do you have
2004-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	phin	plovs	64
2004-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	plovs	phin	that's not very much maybe you shouldn't use gnome then
2004-10-02T13:48:00.000Z	plovs	phin	what I didn't like about kdrive is that (as far as I can tell) the refreshrate 60hz is, after an hour it will make your eyes fall out
2004-10-02T13:49:00.000Z	plovs	phin	ah, then t might be ok, what graphiccard?
2004-10-02T13:50:00.000Z	plovs	phin	well it is a small package, you should maybe ask on ubuntu-devel
2004-10-02T13:50:00.000Z	phin	plovs	i plan to.  thanks :)
2004-10-02T13:50:00.000Z	plovs	phin	I use a p133 laptop, so 300 is *wow*
2004-10-02T13:51:00.000Z	plovs	phin	I used it on my desktop, my laptop is not vesa-compliant :(
2004-10-02T13:54:00.000Z	plovs	phin	what did you change, you wrote it down but it scrolled of my screen
2004-10-02T13:56:00.000Z	plovs	phin	thanks
2004-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	phin	plovs	np
2004-10-02T13:58:00.000Z	plovs	phin	nice
2004-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	plovs	phin	linux is made for that :)
2004-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	plovs	phin	that is already quite nice, it is easier to see, I liked that about fedora
2004-10-02T14:33:00.000Z	plovs	phin	use qemu to install it
