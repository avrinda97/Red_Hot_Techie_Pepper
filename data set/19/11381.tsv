2006-09-11T15:23:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Why?
2006-09-11T15:23:00.000Z	KurtKraut	TiG4	I've done a very big tutorial abour ircd.conf
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	KurtKraut	TiG4	explaling the lines, A lines, M lines, O lines, C lines, what they mean and how to tune them
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Damn... Lemme guess, it's in Portuguese or Spanish
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	KurtKraut	TiG4	but in portuguese
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Here is where I am having problems
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	The IRCd is easy to install
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	It's the Services that gets me
2006-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	i.e. ChanServ, NickServ, Etc.
2006-09-11T15:25:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Yeah. I don't know how to do it, and all the tutorials online are assuming that I have alot of knowledge of IRCd.
2006-09-11T15:25:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Which I don't
2006-09-11T15:26:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Any suggestions?
2006-09-11T15:26:00.000Z	KurtKraut	TiG4	reading the documentation in the official site of the services you're trying to use
2006-09-11T15:27:00.000Z	TiG4	KurtKraut	Yeah, I did that... but again they assume that I know alot about IRCd and they use lots of "terms" that I don't understand
