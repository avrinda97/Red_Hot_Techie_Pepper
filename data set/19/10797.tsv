2007-01-07T06:16:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	black list it
2007-01-07T06:16:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	I tried that. Which blacklist file should I use?
2007-01-07T06:17:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	nvm I think I figured it out. Is there a way to monitor which modules gets loaded?
2007-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	no modules get loaded if you do a make install
2007-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	what should I look for then? Whenever I restart I have to do a make install of lirc in order to get it working again.
2007-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	why did you install it from source ?
2007-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	I followed the "how to" on the ubuntu forum.
2007-01-07T06:30:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	what makes you think its a module loading problem
2007-01-07T06:31:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	I'm a newbie, so it was just a wild shot. I just can't figure out what it is that makes lirc work after each make install.
2007-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	groggy, if I run lircd after a reboot the log returns this "readlink() failed for "/dev/lirc" "no such file or directory". But if I run a make install first it works perfectly.
2007-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	the device isn't present as you've not set a udev device to be created at boot time
2007-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	groggy, all the "how to's" mention a module which should be loaded on boot, but I don't have the module.
2007-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	is it talking about a kernel or lirc module ?
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	"it"?
2007-01-07T06:44:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	sorry I didn't see your last reply, let me see.
2007-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	jakob	ikonia	this is what the how to says "echo "alias char-major-61-* lirc_gpio" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/lirc"
2007-01-07T06:46:00.000Z	ikonia	jakob	ok
