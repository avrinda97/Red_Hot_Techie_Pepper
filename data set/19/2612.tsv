2010-03-06T18:30:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	you deal with soundcards...
2010-03-06T18:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 Nope. rarely had sound issues
2010-03-06T18:31:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	had sound issues just me I push through it ... bit hard when you have to explain it...
2010-03-06T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 ive rarely ever had any sound card issues.
2010-03-06T18:57:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	there hiding it behind the fance splash screen, but most of these issues are going to be resolved in 10.04 hopefully.... 9.10 seems like a testing ground for udev, and upstart... heard Lucid Lynx boots in 8 seconds...
2010-03-06T18:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 about 30 sec here. and yes the last reelase did test a lot of new stuff thats how they always do it
2010-03-06T19:00:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	not sure I buy the ide of that is how they always do it... only used Ubuntu since 8.10 so I don't know there history....
2010-03-06T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 i have.. and they always add in lots of new stuff befor they do a LTS. they DONT want to add new stuff to a lts if they can help it
2010-03-06T19:01:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	I jump a lot from Distro to Distro, but I must admit Arch Linux seems to be the only one I go back to time after time .... next stop Slackware...
2010-03-06T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 i got sick of arch and came back to ubuntu.
2010-03-06T19:02:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	what???? are you crazy??? why???
2010-03-06T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 i saw no benifits for me using arch. and had numerous issues.
2010-03-06T19:04:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	well they tend to be only geared to a select number of hardware and devices... as along with a limited number of programs... but if you can figure out what they use it makes life easy...
2010-03-06T19:10:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	I will agree that if it works then it works... I don't like the ideas that ubuntu puts you all out as genien pigs... every release...
2010-03-06T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 its not every release. They like to put in the features that people want in a logical way. and you DONT want lots of testing stuff in the LTS releases.. its all about 'LTS'
2010-03-06T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 ive not seen many other disrots that even use the LTS type of idea
2010-03-06T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 after the release theres only updates for security type issues
2010-03-06T19:13:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Dr_Willis	Don't like this idea because all these magazines in barns and noble, put out that its the next greatest release not that it is unstable...
2010-03-06T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DebiansArmy	 more Hype and Hype.. use what you want.
