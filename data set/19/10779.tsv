2008-12-17T15:32:00.000Z	jseagle		hello all....
2008-12-17T15:32:00.000Z	jseagle		requesting help if i could
2008-12-17T15:32:00.000Z	jseagle		hello rasta
2008-12-17T15:33:00.000Z	jseagle		well i have a Softgate 11 Mbps ap/router on which i'd like to use on my laptop but i'm clueless as to where to find drivers
2008-12-17T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	you don't need drivers for the access point
2008-12-17T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	the wirles card should just connect/treat it
2008-12-17T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	you don't plug an access point into your machine
2008-12-17T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	an access point goes on the network
2008-12-17T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	then it's not a wirless access point
2008-12-17T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	what do you want to do
2008-12-17T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	contact the people who make the card and ask them to release a driver
2008-12-17T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	buy a new card then
2008-12-17T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	a driver doesn't exist, so you need to ge a card that is supported
2008-12-17T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	you can't
2008-12-17T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	look, I'll be blunt, the driver doesn't exist, there is no documentation on the hardware api - no one is going to spent time reverse engineering a driver for you
2008-12-17T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	can you write c++, do you know the kernel api for hooking in drivers,
2008-12-17T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	can you reverse engineer hardware solutions ?
2008-12-17T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	of you go though, probably take you a few years to get up to speed and get it done. Good luck
2008-12-17T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	jseagle	off you go then
