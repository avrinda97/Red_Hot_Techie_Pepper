2011-12-12T05:28:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	try "sh jperf.sh" you're trying to run a bash script. Just make sure you know what's in it before running whatever it is. ;)
2011-12-12T05:29:00.000Z	jasmin	Gaming4JC	Jperf is a graphical frontend for Iperf written in Java
2011-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	should be ok then, you may also need to run it with "sudo sh blah.sh" depending
2011-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	just keep in mind any command with "sudo" is running as root, so use with caution.
2011-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	jasmin	Gaming4JC	thanks a lots
2011-12-12T05:30:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	np :)

2011-12-12T05:37:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	I don't know much about #fedora but you could try their channel as well
2011-12-12T05:38:00.000Z	jasmin	Gaming4JC	ok friend but on virtual machine how do i set IP address
2011-12-12T05:39:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	that depends on what VM you are running... Qemu, virtualbox? etc.
2011-12-12T05:41:00.000Z	jasmin	Gaming4JC	VMwareÂ® Workstation 8.0.0 build-471780
2011-12-12T05:42:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	jasmin	I've never used VMWare Workstation, so I've no idea. Though google brought this as first result - http://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/ws_net_advanced_ipaddress.html
