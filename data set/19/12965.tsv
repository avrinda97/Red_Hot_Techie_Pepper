2005-07-22T15:33:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	the config files might be in pure-ftpd-common, or -ldap, -mysql, or -postgresql, depending on what configs you are looking for
2008-11-14T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	try installing it with sudo apt-get install , you usually get better error messages
2008-11-14T09:36:00.000Z	hugo	nickrud	still new to using the terminal, what should i type in it?
2008-11-14T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	sudo apt-get install /path/to/openofficefileyoudownloaded
2008-11-14T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	if I'm confused on what you're doing, I'm not suprised. too many convo's do that to me.
2008-11-14T09:40:00.000Z	hugo	nickrud	I first downloaded from openoffice.org the linux version. It looks like I got the rpm version, I went back and couldn't find the deb version. I checked with the forums and it said to remove 2.4 and do a clean install of 3.0
2008-11-14T09:42:00.000Z	hugo	nickrud	SPM shows no version of openoffice installed, but tells me it can't install because it needs certain dependencies that weren't selected.
2008-11-14T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	you downloaded a file that ended in tar.gz or tar.bz2 ?
2008-11-14T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	ok, that's not a package style that synaptic can handle
2008-11-14T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	where did yo download it to?
2008-11-14T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	hugo	here are the installation instructions: http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/FAQ/Installation/How_do_I_install_OpenOffice.org_on_Linux%3F
2008-11-14T09:45:00.000Z	hugo	nickrud	ok checking it out. afk
2008-11-14T09:57:00.000Z	hugo	nickrud	I don't think I ever setup superuser. How do I go about this?
