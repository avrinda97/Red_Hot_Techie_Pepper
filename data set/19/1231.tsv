2011-03-30T15:07:00.000Z	benzaldehyde		what is the best IRC client for Linux?
2011-03-30T15:07:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	but of course its irssi
2011-03-31T19:01:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	sudo su is the wrong way
2011-04-01T03:17:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	ubuntu 11.04
2011-04-01T03:18:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	i looked into downloading it, does not have a ppc image yet though
2011-04-01T03:19:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	ppc is no lomnger supported imo
2011-04-01T03:21:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	does not supported mean no more cdimages for ppc in the future or just that there is no 'advice'
2011-04-01T03:22:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/natty-desktop-powerpc.iso
2011-04-01T03:33:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	ah upgrade, maybe choose another mirror, my speed is fine here
2011-04-01T03:22:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	wish i had met you days ago
2011-04-01T03:23:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	or google :)
2011-04-01T03:25:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	to be honest i probably couldn't use it, the 10.10 would not install on this and that iso looks like the right architecture but also i am on a ps3 so then it might not work for that reason alone. 9.10 is treating me fairly good all in all so no regrets
2011-04-01T03:26:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	for the ps3 have a look at yellow-dog linux too
2011-04-01T03:26:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	i had 6.1 before but it wasn't as widely used as ubuntu so i opted for this
2011-04-01T03:27:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	the problem is there are no drivers for the vga (geohot-hack is making linux possible at the hardware not the hypervisor)
2011-04-01T03:28:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	sounds intelligently said although that is the problem, i have no idea what all that is
2011-04-01T03:32:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	these downloads are painfully slow. when is ubuntu going to get a faster connection? my upgrade is only 700 Mb but is teetering between 2 and 3 hours remaining
2011-04-01T03:32:00.000Z	iceroot	benzaldehyde	torrent or http?
2011-04-01T03:33:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iceroot	http, it's a distribution upgrade via System>Administration>Update Manager
