2005-06-20T16:15:00.000Z	Echylo		anyone can advise me a mass rename file? i have 500+ files, which has to be renamed to each something different, but i have the filenames in a list
2005-06-20T16:15:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	Are the filenames consistent?
2005-06-20T16:16:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	For example, file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt .. or are they all random?
2005-06-20T16:16:00.000Z	Echylo	podge	like 'text1.txt, ..."
2005-06-20T16:16:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	How do you want to rename them?
2005-06-20T16:17:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	I mean.. text1.txt is to be renamed to what?
2005-06-20T16:17:00.000Z	Echylo	podge	the files are (track01.mp3, ...) and have to be renamed to (artist - song.mp3) but I have the titles in a txt
2005-06-20T16:18:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	Umm.. cut and paste the top line of your titles txt file...
2005-06-20T16:19:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	You have 500 files.. with the song names in a text file..
2005-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	How do you relate the filename to the song name?
2005-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	Is the filename and the song name in the file together?
2005-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	Echylo	podge	no
2005-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	So how do you relate a filename to a song name?
2005-06-20T16:22:00.000Z	Echylo	podge	don't understand what you mean, the txt files just have the titles of the song in it like = " 01 Real love" ....
2005-06-20T16:24:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	Okay.. If you have a filename song1.mp3 .. How do you know what to rename the mp3 file to?
2005-06-20T16:24:00.000Z	Echylo	podge	"artist - songname.mp3" but the artist is not hard to add, so just "songname.mp3"
2005-06-20T16:25:00.000Z	podge	Echylo	Give me actual examples of the mp3 filenames.. and also some examples of the song names in the text files..
