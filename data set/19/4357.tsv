2009-03-05T18:47:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	-> i can assist you here in the main, not in the pm though
2009-03-05T18:48:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	I dont understand... i logged normaly like"sudo lampp/lampp start"
2009-03-05T18:48:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	if thats what u meen =/
2009-03-05T18:48:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	-> okay, so you are already logged on, what are you trying to do next?
2009-03-05T18:51:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	well i set my user and pass long time ago so it as some security but that made xampp unable to be accessible via network.. i cant access phpmyadmin for example and i am in the computer with the databases
2009-03-05T18:53:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	-> are you a developer? you knew how to change the password so you remember it?
2009-03-05T18:55:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	yes i change it like it says in the tutorial... because by default it cames without password
2009-03-05T18:56:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	if you followed the tutorial in creating a password, then look into how you would manage an apache and mysql with password, you need to figure out the connect string on the db is one thing
2009-03-05T18:59:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	well since
2009-03-05T19:02:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	well since network access was enabled by default when i install xampp, i thougth it could be easy to enable it again.. i am not a programer if theres no tutorial i get stuck lol
2009-03-05T19:03:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	-> well you should have considered it why you have to put a password, its purpose to be open and used by developers where security is not the main goal
2009-03-05T19:11:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	i just whant it to have password so i am the only on o how can access it.. i think thats comun sence, now if i am working in a network and i must be changeing from a computer to an other i should have normal access for bouth of them =)
2009-03-05T19:12:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	-> you have to understand how one connects to mysql from a network, which client do you use?
2009-03-05T19:15:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	sorry, 'client'?
2009-03-05T19:19:00.000Z	n8tuserf	chumbo	-> you need to learn the concepts of client/server connectivity..
2009-03-05T19:20:00.000Z	chumbo	n8tuserf	lol, yap i guess i do need some reading =)
