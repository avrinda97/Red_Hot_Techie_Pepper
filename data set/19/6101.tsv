2008-03-13T17:02:00.000Z	n2diy	AQ_LIVE	what happens when you open a terminal, and enter "firefox"?
2008-03-13T17:02:00.000Z	AQ_LIVE		sadly I'm not at my linux computer right now I'm at a crapy windows pc
2008-03-13T17:03:00.000Z	n2diy	AQ_LIVE	yes, that is sad. My guess is Firefox is installed, but your icon/menu's aren't?

2008-03-13T17:05:00.000Z	AQ_LIVE		How do i fix the problem if it's only the icons tha are missing
2008-03-13T17:08:00.000Z	n2diy		I'm helping a friend put audio files on is Motorola i880 cell phone. I can read and write to the card with no problems, once the Dapper sees that card. The problem is, it takes hours for Dapper to find the card in my reader. It is a standard Sandisk SD 256m card, Ideas?
