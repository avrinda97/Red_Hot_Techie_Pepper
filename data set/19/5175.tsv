2009-01-11T21:20:00.000Z	strangeseraph		I know that ubuntu 8.04 wouldn't work with this display, I couldn't put ubuntu on this laptop until version 8.10
2009-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	shiloh7_	strangeseraph	what kind of laptop?
2009-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	strangeseraph		Acer Extensa 4630z
2009-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	strangeseraph		I don't know if I use Vesa. When I run the drivers utility it doesn't show me running any proprietary drivers
2009-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	shiloh7_	strangeseraph	thats weird,
2009-01-11T21:22:00.000Z	strangeseraph		so maybe I need to see if there's a specific driver for me?
2009-01-11T21:22:00.000Z	strangeseraph	oskude	Acer doesn't. I couldn't install Vista on this laptop properly without having all their proprietary drivers on a CD because they have a special version of vista they install
2009-01-11T21:22:00.000Z	shiloh7_	strangeseraph	any intel board i have ever loaded into has been perfect graphically
2009-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	strangeseraph		the graphics hardware is Intel GMA X4500
2009-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	shiloh7_	strangeseraph	cause vista is an abortion
