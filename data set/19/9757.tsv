2006-09-24T13:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	a .tar.gz file is an archive.
2006-09-24T13:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	I told you, you can't cd into that file. That's an archive.
2006-09-24T13:13:00.000Z	chalcedony	ArrenLex	ok sorry .. can you tell me the command?
2006-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	chalcedony	ArrenLex	no it's more complicated
2006-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	are you new to Linux?
2006-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	chalcedony	ArrenLex	 i'm a mother with years of experieance .. just  also have some bad learning disabilites that i hate sometimes.
2006-09-24T13:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	computers and Linux are not the same thing. Have you used LINUX before?
2006-09-24T13:17:00.000Z	chalcedony	ArrenLex	dear the filename is myfile09-23-06.tar.gz and i haven't messed with tar files in years.
2006-09-24T13:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	run tar -t myfile09-23-06.tar.gz, which will show you everything that's in the archive.
2006-09-24T13:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	when you extract the archive, all this stuff in the archive will get copied to the current folder. That's where you'll find it.
2006-09-24T13:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	chalcedony	actually, no, it won't do anything, sorry about that xD that was my mistake.
2006-09-24T13:22:00.000Z	chalcedony	ArrenLex	oh should i control C and stop that ?
