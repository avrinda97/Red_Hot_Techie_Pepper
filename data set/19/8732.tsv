2007-02-17T08:57:00.000Z	padge_		Is glib the GNU standard library for compiling programs?
2007-02-17T08:58:00.000Z	padge_		I'm trying to get an IDE installed... I've found Anjuta but it seems to need glib, which is not in the repositories, afaik
2007-02-17T08:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	Anjuta is in the repos. If you install from the repos, it should pull in all the deps.
2007-02-17T08:59:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	That is where I got it.
2007-02-17T08:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	You did sudo apt-get install anjuta ?
2007-02-17T09:00:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	Negative.  I used synaptic package manager.
2007-02-17T09:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	What is the exact problem, then?
2007-02-17T09:01:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	When I try to create a project, it fails with an error that glib and libtool are needed.  I found libtool on the repositiry, but not glib.  And this is not the first time I've needed glib for something.  Also, gcc doesn't compile my programs right and I was thinking this might be related.
2007-02-17T09:02:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	That's why I want a better understanding of what glib is, glibc, and the difference between them
2007-02-17T09:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	Have you installed build-essential ?
2007-02-17T09:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	apt-cache policy build-essential
2007-02-17T09:06:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	Evidently I haven't, it's working now
2007-02-17T09:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	You really should have build-essential installed if you're going to be coding
2007-02-17T09:07:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	I did not know about that package.  I thought if I had a few things like, the C library, and a C compiler, I was ready to get going
2007-02-17T09:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	Almost ;)
2007-02-17T09:07:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	but moving to a more sophisticated environment like an IDE, I figreded if I just got what the program said I needed I'd be in the clear
2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	Thanks for your help with that :)
2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge_	You're welcome
2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	padge_	ardchoille	So, do you think those programs that I wrote that compile in g++ but not gcc will compile in gcc now?
