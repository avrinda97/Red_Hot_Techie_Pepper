2007-10-11T10:09:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	Are you using the same workgroup names ?
2007-10-11T10:09:00.000Z	Wips		yes Interbird. Mshome
2007-10-11T10:10:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	So, Mshome is listed in /etc/samba/smb.conf after the workgroup= statement ?
2007-10-11T10:10:00.000Z	Wips		As I said the windows-laptop can see my ubuntu-computer in the same workgroup as it is in.. just can't access
2007-10-11T10:10:00.000Z	Wips		yes interbird =D I made sure earlier
2007-10-11T10:13:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	Does dpkg --list|grep smbfs show it's installed ?
2007-10-11T10:14:00.000Z	Wips	interbird	it lists nothing
2007-10-11T10:15:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	As root: apt-get install smbfs or use synaptic
2007-10-11T10:15:00.000Z	Wips	interbird	I have samba installed though.. shouldn't that be enough?
2007-10-11T10:15:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	smbfs is needed to connect to shares
2007-10-11T10:15:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	sudo apt-get install smbfs
2007-10-11T10:15:00.000Z	Wips	interbird	ok, it's installed now
2007-10-11T10:16:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2007-10-11T10:16:00.000Z	Wips		I looked at it geefinator, but I don't get it.. I've been able to share files on this ubuntu before, whitout having to mount etc etc
2007-10-11T10:16:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	also check that guest ok = yes in the global settings of /etc/samba/smb.conf
2007-10-11T10:18:00.000Z	Wips	interbird	there's nothing called "guest ok"
2007-10-11T10:19:00.000Z	Wips		ah, found it interbird.. It's set to Yes
2007-10-11T10:19:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and add guest ok = yes to the global section and then sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2007-10-11T10:21:00.000Z	interbird	Wips	can you paste /etc/samba/smb.conf on #flood so i can check it ?
