2009-11-09T10:18:00.000Z	regina		This is up a few times.
2009-11-09T10:18:00.000Z	regina		other errors too though.

2009-11-09T10:18:00.000Z	regina		Comes up all the time too.
2009-11-09T10:20:00.000Z	regina		um.... is that the terminal again?
2009-11-09T10:20:00.000Z	regina		I typed that in the terminal, but the files are still huge.
2009-11-09T10:21:00.000Z	regina		That will take a while...
2009-11-09T10:21:00.000Z	regina		syslog is 7gb!!!
2009-11-09T10:21:00.000Z	regina		This newest release is obviously very buggy.
2009-11-09T10:22:00.000Z	regina		I KNEW I should have put Mint on this client's machine...  :(
2009-11-09T10:23:00.000Z	scunizi	regina	maybe on your system.. generally speaking it's been pretty good.  Some people have issues based on a lot of factors,, hardware, upgrade vs fresh install, 3rd party apts and unique alternate configurations etc..
2009-11-09T10:23:00.000Z	regina	scunizi	I have a very generic emachine here with almost no special apps.  This is a very basic wubi install.
2009-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	regina		These errors should NOT have been happening.
2009-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	regina		This is a black eye for all of Linux, not just Ubuntu.
2009-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	regina		I can't believe there are no other reports of this.  This machine is ULTRA generic.
2009-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	scunizi	regina	wubi.. well that's just another layer of "problems".. if you have a gig of ram you might consider trying virtualbox.org or just run from the live cd.. or go for the real experience and dual boot
2009-11-09T10:25:00.000Z	regina	scunizi	I do that on my machine, but this is a client machine.  Not recommended.  I might do a full install, but this little trial run is not instilling me with any confidence.
2009-11-09T10:26:00.000Z	scunizi	regina	some have issues with wubi which in essence is a vm
2009-11-09T10:26:00.000Z	regina	scunizi	IT most certainly is NOT a VM.
