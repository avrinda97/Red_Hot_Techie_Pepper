2010-12-22T17:17:00.000Z	wyclif		Anyone know why a routine update of linux-headers would prevent booting?
2010-12-22T17:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	prevent booting do you mean no graphics in X?  maybe you were using propriatary drivers?
2010-12-22T17:20:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	preventing booting: "error: cannot read the Linux header. error: you need to load the kernel first"
2010-12-22T17:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	well if something is looking for headers sounds like it's trying to compile something?
2010-12-22T17:22:00.000Z	wyclif		!sacarlson Usually when dpkg runs I usually see updates to linux headers and it's usually no problem. But the latest update of those totally causes a boot fail
2010-12-22T17:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	well hold the shift key at boot and try boot the older kernel I guess.
2010-12-22T17:24:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	I may be forced to do that, right now I'm gonna try to reboot from a CD
2010-12-22T17:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	I assume you still have the old kernel,  if that is still installed just change default back to that
2010-12-22T17:26:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	yes, it's booting now, I'll try to roll back to the pre-update state, still wondering why that would happen when it hasn't before
2010-12-22T17:26:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	thanks

2010-12-22T17:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	you could also turn the text view on to see at what point it happens.  there's a gui called startup-manager that makes it easy to make changes in grub to change defaults and turn text on
2010-12-22T17:28:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	I generally prefer grub to lilo
2010-12-22T17:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	startup-manager is just the gui for grub2
2010-12-22T17:30:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	I also have my /boot/grub/menu.lst backed up just in case anything gets overwritten
2010-12-22T17:31:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	usually I just edit grub on the command line
2010-12-22T17:32:00.000Z	wyclif		Coffee, you had me at "hello."
2010-12-22T17:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	wyclif	I don't thing grub2 uses /boot/grub/menu.lst any more
2010-12-22T17:33:00.000Z	wyclif	sacarlson	yes that's true, guess I need to back up again! =)
