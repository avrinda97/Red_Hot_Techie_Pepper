2007-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	Shaddox		Hi everyone. ^^
2007-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	Shaddox		How do I find and kill a process by name in a console?
2007-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	pkill processname
2007-05-21T05:12:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	not much
2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	Shaddox	crdlb	Kubuntu's power configuration thing on the system tray in my KDE had cpu scaling support, how could I install that?
2007-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	parted is cli only
2007-06-12T14:09:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	when you install gentoo, you can do anything you want with the partition (but that's more of a question for #gentoo )
2007-06-12T14:10:00.000Z	Shaddox	crdlb	I'm trying to remove my Windows partition on my local hard disk, and replace it with fresh raw space that I can mold and shape into various Linux partitions.
2007-06-12T14:11:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	it should certainly let you delete the partition
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	oh it's mounted?
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	you can't modify the partitions on a hard drive you're using
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	is the hard drive with the 20GB partition the same one that ubuntu is installed on?
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	Shaddox	crdlb	Uh-huh.
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	are you using gparted on a livecd?
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	Shaddox	crdlb	No, I'm on my normal bootup.
2007-06-12T14:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	that's the problem
2007-06-12T14:16:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	you cannot repartition a hard drive while the hard drive is in use
2007-06-12T14:17:00.000Z	crdlb	Shaddox	pm?
2007-06-12T14:17:00.000Z	Shaddox	crdlb	yeah.
