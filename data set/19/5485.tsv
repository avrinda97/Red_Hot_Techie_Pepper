2008-06-22T03:47:00.000Z	happymonkey		how do I ask xmodmap to interpret one key for multiple keys?
2008-06-22T03:47:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	like K for Control-Alt-K?   I don't know.
2008-06-22T03:48:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	yes, exactly I have a multimedia remote I'm trying to use with evince for page forward and back etc.
2008-06-22T03:48:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	for a presentation I must give
2008-06-22T03:49:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	I briefly read the xmodmap page, seems like it would be possible, read it already?
2008-06-22T03:49:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	yes, but most likely more briefly than you
2008-06-22T03:50:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	I think I just put a space, actually between each, let me try
2008-06-22T03:51:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	what you need is a suitable expression, look at the examples. Sorry, no other way around but to try a few times.
2008-06-22T03:51:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	yes, I believe you are correct, I thought perhaps someone here had already done something like this
2008-06-22T03:52:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	maybe something like "keysim K = Meta_L Alt_L K"
2008-06-22T03:52:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	yes, the 2nd example gives it away
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	somewhat humerous, key up and down are already programmed into the remote :)
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	excuse me pg-up and down
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	what app is that?
2008-06-22T04:07:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	I'm using a hp media remote - came with my laptop and using it with evince.
2008-06-22T04:08:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	I was confused into thinking that page up and down required more than Prior and Next keys but that is all they need
2008-06-22T04:09:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	yeah, many linux apps are that way, they control things with just a key.
2008-06-22T04:10:00.000Z	happymonkey	vocx	no I am very familiar with mutt, irssi, and other command line tools but am not used to using GNOME so this is nice to see how simple it is
2008-06-22T04:10:00.000Z	vocx	happymonkey	yup
