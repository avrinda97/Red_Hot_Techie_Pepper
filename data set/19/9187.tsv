2008-03-30T09:21:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		how do i perform something similar to defrag on ext3?
2008-03-30T09:22:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		after deleting several large gobs of data and replacing them with other files, disk performance has taken a sharp downturn over the past few days.
2008-03-30T09:23:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	its true, but if you insist, run fdisk.
2008-03-30T09:26:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	is this a name brand machine like a Dell, you could have hidden partitions on it?
2008-03-30T09:26:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	no
2008-03-30T09:29:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	the machine is old and slow enough that running gnome-system-monitor takes up between 17-40%CPU randomly :p
2008-03-30T09:30:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	ok, that shouldn't affect the hard drive space, maybe the drive is going south on you?
2008-03-30T09:30:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	possibly, but i'm up the creek if thats the case
2008-03-30T09:31:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	Sorry, GL.
2008-03-30T10:08:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	no, try susdo fsck from a terminal.
2008-03-30T10:09:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	it screams at me not to run it on a mounted filesystem
2008-03-30T10:09:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	yes, you need to umount it.
2008-03-30T10:10:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	then i won't be able to run fsck
2008-03-30T10:10:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	fsck runs everyday, why do you need to run it now?
2008-03-30T10:11:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	because obviosuly rebooting the computer, etc isn't making fsck do it's job, re http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61556/
2008-03-30T10:12:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	ok, let me have a look, in the mean time triy "sudo updatedb"
2008-03-30T10:15:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	It appears fsck is trying to fix your corrupted files, and your telling it not to.
2008-03-30T10:15:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	n2diy	because i used -n to avoid screwing up the mounted filesystem
2008-03-30T10:16:00.000Z	n2diy	Bisclaveret	GL
