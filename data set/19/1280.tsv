2011-04-29T00:56:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	try plugging into a wired network and starting up the hardware driver manager. it'll search the internet for a wireless driver
2011-04-29T00:57:00.000Z	nerdshell	maco	: the driver is installed, I already done that
2011-04-29T00:57:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	is your rfkill switch enabled?
2011-04-29T00:57:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	and have you rebooted since installing the drivers
2011-04-29T00:58:00.000Z	nerdshell	maco	 : I rebooted, what is rfkill ?
2011-04-29T00:58:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	the "turn off wireless because im in an airplane / want to save battery" button or switch
2011-04-29T00:58:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	can try    sudo rfkill --unblock all
2011-04-29T01:10:00.000Z	nerdshell	maco	the computer recognizes my iphone hostspot but not my wifi network
2011-04-29T01:12:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	is your wifi network running on a very high channel?
2011-04-29T01:13:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	like, i think channel 13 is europe-only (or only recently added to the US?) ... in which case your driver might not look that high by default
2011-04-29T01:14:00.000Z	nerdshell	maco	but my wifi was working fine on 10.10
2011-05-04T18:47:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	with a space in it like that? a syntax error
2011-05-04T18:47:00.000Z	maco	nerdshell	 ./setup.sh would execute a script named setup.sh

2011-06-13T22:07:00.000Z	nerdshell	maco	how to send it to init ?
