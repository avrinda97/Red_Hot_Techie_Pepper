2010-08-24T16:18:00.000Z	joe_is_home		Hey i just installed lucid lynx on my IBM thinkpad T42, i turned the visual effects off to do a bit of testing, now when i try to re-enable them it tells me "Desktop effects could not be enabled", what gives???  Has a ATI mobility radeon 7500 AGP gphx card if that helps
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	gtroy	joe_is_home	have you reinstalled the graphics drivers?
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	joe_is_home	gtroy	there is absolutely NOTHING about a graphics driver in regards to this
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	joe_is_home		i have no idea what im looking for
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	joe_is_home		not even google could help me
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	gtroy	joe_is_home	what have you tried so far?
2010-08-24T16:21:00.000Z	joe_is_home	gtroy	google so far
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	gtroy	joe_is_home	have you installed xserver-xorg?
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	joe_is_home		no, fglrx is not compatible with this gphx card
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	joe_is_home		and there is nothing out there that hints at xserver-xorg
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	joe_is_home		so i did not install it
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	gtroy		xserver-xorg is already installed
2010-08-24T16:23:00.000Z	gtroy		just thinking of reinstalling it
2010-08-24T16:23:00.000Z	gtroy		or the drivers
2010-08-24T16:23:00.000Z	joe_is_home		and look at that, i just tried to re-enable desktop effects and now they've decided to work
2010-08-24T16:23:00.000Z	joe_is_home		odd-ball..
2010-08-24T16:23:00.000Z	joe_is_home		took 10 tries but got working now
2010-08-24T16:23:00.000Z	gtroy	joe_is_home	have you put the computer to sleep? or changed accounts?
