2012-05-10T06:52:00.000Z	st3el__		example
2012-05-10T06:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	like I'm doing to you now?
2012-05-10T06:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	you just type in their name (or use autocomplete like "st<tab>")
2012-05-10T06:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	yep, that worked
2012-05-10T06:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	x-chat supports auto-complete
2012-05-10T07:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	try typing more of the letters,
2012-05-10T07:02:00.000Z	st3el__	DarwinSurvivor	the more letters thing helped
2012-05-10T07:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	nothing really
2012-05-10T07:03:00.000Z	st3el__	DarwinSurvivor	for what its worth I feel less cool..
2012-05-10T07:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	st3el__	/quit
