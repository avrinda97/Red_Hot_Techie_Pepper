2005-12-12T14:02:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		most would disagree with me and say "that what's nice, you have a choice", but the thing i dislike most is the different interfaces and menu system in different distros.....finally i decided to stick to ubuntu, come hell or high water
2005-12-12T14:04:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		i want Linux to take over M$ :)

2005-12-12T14:06:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		i still find myself comfy with windows...i admit i'm not running a server here...just a normal desktop
2005-12-12T14:06:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		i like linux coz it's Different
2005-12-12T14:06:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		so i'm getting used to it
2005-12-12T14:07:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		in 5 months i learnt a lot...i can configure my ubuntu installation in a few hours
2005-12-12T14:08:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		the only thing i miss from windows is the click and install part

2005-12-12T14:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	St^Anger^19m	synaptic should have gstreamer in it
2005-12-12T14:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	St^Anger^19m	has alot to do with the suorce code and also the way windows and linux use the file system and cache and crap :)

2005-12-12T14:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	St^Anger^19m	 you can change the settings internally in firefox i think its about:firefox but i dont remember what the about address is
