2006-12-31T15:48:00.000Z	elyon		So would I do ./sudo [file] ?  Or sudo ./[file] ?
2006-12-31T15:48:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	 sudo ./cmd
2006-12-31T15:46:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- I'm having a problem with sudo too.  I'm trying to run a command, but sudo says the command doesn't exist.  I'm in the right directory and copy/pasting the filename...
2006-12-31T15:46:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	what happens when you try the cmd without sudo?
2006-12-31T15:46:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	you are in the dir where the cmd exists?
2006-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- It will run, but then stop and tell me it needs to be run as Super User
2006-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- Yes, in the same dir as the file.
2006-12-31T15:49:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	would you like to know why?
2006-12-31T15:49:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- Why what?
2006-12-31T15:50:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	due to security concerns, current dir is never on your PATH for exec purposes
2006-12-31T15:50:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	. is curr dir
2006-12-31T15:50:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- didn't know that.  Good to know and it makes sense.  Thank you.
2007-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- I was referring to the Ubuntu install when it is setting up partitions.
2007-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	so am i
2007-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	- Then I stand corrected :)
2007-01-02T14:17:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	you should try my eggs - when the fox doesn't get the chickens...
2007-01-05T06:05:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	something in /var
2007-01-05T06:05:00.000Z	mnoir	elyon	or maybe /media
2007-01-05T06:05:00.000Z	elyon	mnoir	 thanks.
