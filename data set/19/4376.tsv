2009-01-27T07:44:00.000Z	jedihome		how much of a hit in performance do you get when running ubuntu 'inside windows' (fat32) ?
2009-01-27T07:44:00.000Z	jedihome		also is there a way to install ubuntu without burning it to a physical cd ?
2009-01-27T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 You mean via 'Wubi' ?
2009-01-27T07:45:00.000Z	jedihome	Dr_willis	whats wubi ?
2009-01-27T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 a way to install  Linux 'inside' windows
2009-01-27T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 vs. running ubuntu under windows in virtualbox/vmware
2009-01-27T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 and yes you can make bootable/installable thumbdrives
2009-01-27T07:46:00.000Z	jedihome	Dr_willis	when i pop in the ubuntu cd it gives me the option to 'install inside windows' which i asume just installs it in fat32
2009-01-27T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 incorrect.. has nothing to do with 'in fat32;
2009-01-27T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 it makes a large file.. and installs to 'that' and then sets the boot option  to boot from that file  via WUBI.
2009-01-27T07:46:00.000Z	jedihome	Dr_willis	ok i just assumed that was the case since they make a point of saying that performance is going to take a hit
2009-01-27T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 it does.. and i dont suggest using wubi at all
2009-01-27T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 i use 'unetbootin' and a ubuntu.iso file to make a bootable thumbdrive
2009-01-27T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 or boot the live cd. and use the ubuntu Usb-drive tool to make a bootablew thmbdrive with peristant HOME save space
2009-01-27T07:48:00.000Z	jedihome	Dr_willis	problem is i cant burn the live cd to begin with; otherwise i'd just install it from there
2009-01-27T07:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 ive done it via virtualbox. :) but its an annoyance.. dident need to burn either.. I would just use unetbootin. if you just want to Install from usb
2009-01-27T07:57:00.000Z	jedihome	Dr_willis	one more quick question - how long does it normally take for this to copy to usb? its been stuck on file #7 for like 4-5 minutes now
2009-01-27T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jedihome	 it can take some time.  usb drives canbe slow
2009-01-27T08:00:00.000Z	jedihome	Dr_willis	thanks so much for all the help
