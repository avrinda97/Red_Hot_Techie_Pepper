2006-09-02T06:13:00.000Z	TeePOG		morning
2006-09-02T06:14:00.000Z	TeePOG		could anyone enlighten me...? I need to find out why wget is not using my proxy, even though every other program i have tried, does find and use the proxy correctly?
2006-09-02T06:16:00.000Z	Teller	TeePOG	Have you set it in gnome or as an environment variable ?
2006-09-02T06:16:00.000Z	TeePOG		on a related note Jack_Sparrow -- i got reading and writing of NTFS to work, way back in breezy, with ntfstools
2006-09-02T06:16:00.000Z	Teller		Or both ?
2006-09-02T06:16:00.000Z	TeePOG		erm, i installed kubuntu-desktop... it's in KDE's proxy settings
2006-09-02T06:17:00.000Z	Teller	TeePOG	Ok, `printenv` see if you have any environment variables involving proxies set
2006-09-02T06:17:00.000Z	TeePOG		so, kget and all works, but no cli... and therefore, no automatix
2006-09-02T06:17:00.000Z	TeePOG		thanks Teller, brb
2006-09-02T06:17:00.000Z	Teller		Hi! I can't get my USB mouse to work on my touchpad equipped laptop.. When I move the mouse while I cat /dev/input/mouse0 I get output, so the kernel finds it alright.. More info on http://pastebin.ca/158173
2006-09-02T06:17:00.000Z	Teller		ops
2006-09-02T06:18:00.000Z	Teller		lol, that looks good after I just told someone off for repeating :P
2006-09-02T06:19:00.000Z	TeePOG	Teller	i see nothing about a proxy, even though I typed "export HTTP_proxy=http://192.168.0.2:3128
2006-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	Teller	TeePOG	That's very odd
2006-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	TeePOG	Teller	should I rather put that line in a conf file somewhere? i don't know if it will save it when I reboot
2006-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	Teller	TeePOG	it won't, you could set it in ~/.bashrc
2006-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	Teller		.. to make it survive reboots
2006-09-02T06:22:00.000Z	TeePOG		ok Teller, do I just type it in there as i would on the command line?
2006-09-02T06:22:00.000Z	Teller	TeePOG	yepp
