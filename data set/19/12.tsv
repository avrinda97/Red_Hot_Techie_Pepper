2005-02-07T12:36:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	but of course.
2005-02-07T12:37:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	no "some assembly required" here -> batteries included!
2005-02-07T12:37:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	building doesn't optimise for your hardware
2005-02-07T12:37:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	good software dynamically adjusts to the features of the hardware.
2005-02-07T12:38:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	those define the instructions used and very corner case tuning things. they don't magically make software faster, or able to use hardware features (such as altivec).
2005-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	keep it nice please
2005-02-07T13:38:00.000Z	jdub	ron_frown	why bother?
