2008-02-01T11:35:00.000Z	drgeb		that was dumb sorry. what program can I use to make a blind copy of a CD to a harddrive ?
2008-02-01T11:35:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	"blind copy"?
2008-02-01T11:36:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	an exact binary copy
2008-02-01T11:36:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	Do you want to make an ISO image of the CD on your hard drive?  So that you can burn a CD later on?
2008-02-01T11:37:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	these cd's are all audio files. so I have a backup
2008-02-01T11:37:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	I just played with cdparanoia and then created a raw file. I ran in 4 times and then did an md5sum of the 4 files and compared them and they were equal but
2008-02-01T11:38:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	then I found out about k3b and tried this but when I compared the raw file with that off cdparanioa they were different
2008-02-01T11:38:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	What is on the CD?
2008-02-01T11:39:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	alll the CD's are audio cd's
2008-02-01T11:39:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	Then you want to rip the CD and put .wav files on your HD?
2008-02-01T11:40:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	Use CD ripper:  like sound juicer or...
2008-02-01T11:40:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	yes step 1 from cd to (raw or iso) step2 from (raw or iso ) to mp3 or flac or whatever. step 3 get a slingbox so I can stream this to my highend fidelity audio system
2008-02-01T11:41:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	soundjuice immediately goes to mp3 so I don't have an exact image backup copy of the cd itself
2008-02-01T11:42:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	Applications --> Sound Juicer
2008-02-01T11:42:00.000Z	drgeb	seacat	I know about sound juicer but this is not exactly what I am looking for
2008-02-01T11:42:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	Is that what you want?
2008-02-01T11:42:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	sudo apt-get install grip
2008-02-01T11:43:00.000Z	seacat	drgeb	grip - GNOME-based CD-player/ripper/encoder
