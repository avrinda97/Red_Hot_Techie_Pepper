2007-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn		where should I look for on-plug USB camera documentation ?
2007-03-20T14:39:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	find the name of the device and search for: ubuntu driver INSERTPRODUCTNAMEHERE
2007-03-20T14:43:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	my camera is detected, but access granted by the system are to restricted... the created file is root:root with rw,rw,r access
2007-03-20T14:44:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	are you root?
2007-03-20T14:44:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	sure I'm not :)
2007-03-20T14:45:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	are you root? right click on the file then propertys then see if you can moddigy them
2007-03-20T14:45:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	why not?
2007-03-20T14:45:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	I can't. Doing operations as root is not good :) this is not a workaround
2007-03-20T14:48:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	some things have to be done as root,like changing perrmissions
2007-03-20T14:48:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	yes but such thing should not be done each time the camera is connected to the computer
2007-03-20T14:49:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	sorry can you  explain your problem again?
2007-03-20T14:58:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	my problem is each time I connect my camera to the computer, the photo retriever software complains about not having access to the plugged device
2007-03-20T14:59:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	when I sudo chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/whatever_is_the_device
2007-03-20T14:59:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	it then works
2007-03-20T14:59:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	but this has to be done each time  I connect the device
2007-03-20T14:59:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	see what I mean ?
2007-03-20T15:00:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	yup but sorry i cant help you
2007-03-20T15:01:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	waxyfresh	ok, thank you
2007-03-20T15:02:00.000Z	waxyfresh	K3rl0u4rn	keep asking every 10-15 min someone will know
