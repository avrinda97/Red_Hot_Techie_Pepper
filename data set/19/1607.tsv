2010-12-17T06:27:00.000Z	luxurymode		Hey all. I'm running dual monitors in ubuntu with ATI catalyst. When I click to maximize a youtube video, it maximizes it onto the other screen. Thoughts?
2010-12-17T06:29:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	flashhacker for ubuntu or something.
2010-12-17T06:29:00.000Z	luxurymode	iszak	thank you sir. where can i get it?
2010-12-17T06:30:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	try http://firefox-tutorials.blogspot.com/2010/06/flash-issues-solutions.html
2010-12-17T06:30:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	"FlashHacker" is actually a Windows fix for it, but I'm assuming there's one for linux.
2010-12-17T06:30:00.000Z	luxurymode	iszak	right. im using chrome. does that make a diff?
2010-12-17T06:30:00.000Z	iszak		Honestly not sure.
2010-12-17T06:30:00.000Z	iszak		there is a separate one for chrome on windows, but not sure about linux.
2010-12-17T06:31:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	hmm
2010-12-17T06:32:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	I'm not sure if that's the answer..
2010-12-17T06:32:00.000Z	luxurymode	iszak	actually lemme first see if i have this problem in FF. i just hate FF, i prefer chrome
2010-12-17T06:33:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	I don't know if a solution exists tbh now.
2010-12-17T06:33:00.000Z	iszak		google around for it is all I can suggest.
2010-12-17T06:33:00.000Z	luxurymode	iszak	strange, i think its a monitor issue bc if i have the video playing on my left monitor and i click to maximize it maximizes on that monitor. its only when im playing on right monitor that it pushes it to the right monitor in fullscreen.
2010-12-17T06:35:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	I doubt it, but possibly.
2010-12-17T06:36:00.000Z	luxurymode	iszak	http://goo.gl/BFVGS should i try some of those solutions?
2010-12-17T06:37:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	you can, but I would personally google around, I haven't fixed it in linux only in windows.
2010-12-17T06:39:00.000Z	iszak	luxurymode	sorry I couldn't help anymore.
2010-12-17T06:39:00.000Z	luxurymode	iszak	np i appreciate your help
