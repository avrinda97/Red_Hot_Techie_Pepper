2008-05-28T14:09:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	Do you have a recovery CD from your old system?
2008-05-28T14:10:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	Do you have some sort of recovery CD from your old system? A lot of computers come with these.
2008-05-28T14:12:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	Since you are running from the CD you cannot unmount the CD to burn another CD.
2008-05-28T14:14:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	No, the CD is crap, not ubuntu.
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	Go to http://www.ubuntu.com/ and order a CD from them.
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	You've overwritten it. there is no way to access your windows partion simply because it does not exist now.
2008-05-28T14:16:00.000Z	kibibyte	Yachaziel	it does exist i didnt format it but ubuntu overwrite boot sector
2008-05-28T14:16:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	You cannot remove livecd because your computer is using it to run. It would be like trying to remove the HDD.
2008-05-28T14:17:00.000Z	Yachaziel	kibibyte	In future, test your CD's before you use them to overwrite your partitions.
