2005-11-05T16:34:00.000Z	adam_r		how does KDE follow windows...
2005-11-05T16:34:00.000Z	adam_r		honest question
2005-11-05T16:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	I think he means it has a "start" style menu nd is superficially similar
2005-11-05T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	not so
2005-11-05T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	the *boxes are quite different for instance
2005-11-05T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	fluxbox, blackbox, openbox
2005-11-05T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	window managers :)
2005-11-05T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	*cough*

2005-11-05T16:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	you have no idea what you ar talking about, sorry
2005-11-05T16:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	heheh - at least you are big enoughto admit it ;)
2005-11-05T16:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	quite true - i meant it :)
2005-11-05T16:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	yes, but you see these wm s are very configurable
2005-11-05T16:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	so you can make them look any way you want pretty much
2005-11-05T17:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	you speak from years of experience, of course ;)
2005-11-05T17:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	no, probably the same as your user name - or should be on ubuntu
2005-11-05T17:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	you'll see that if you type say  ls -l ~
2005-11-05T17:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	yes
2005-11-05T17:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adam_r	 indeed :)
