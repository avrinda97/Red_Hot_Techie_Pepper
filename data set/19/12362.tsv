2009-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	Flannel	`paul	Don't delete the kernels manually, delete them via your package manager.  Remove old linux-image-[version] packages
2009-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	`paul	Flannel	how do i do these on CLI?
2009-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	Flannel	`paul	Be sure you don't delete the newest kernel, nor the one you're on (uname -a will tell you that).  Also, for an upgrade, they should be the same.
2009-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	Flannel	`paul	apt-get purge package1 package2 package3 etc
2009-11-06T04:15:00.000Z	Flannel	`paul	to find the packages, dpkg -l | grep linux-image
2009-11-06T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	`paul	Firefox requires it.  Do you have -proposed enabled by any chance?
