2008-06-22T23:23:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983		bonjour is the compatability program set for macintosh, the rest i'm not sure of unavailable
2008-06-22T23:25:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983		hello mynetdude
2008-06-22T23:25:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	I'm also Yooshi,  would you happen to know much about samba/XP shares?
2008-06-22T23:26:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	no i'm not familiar with samba at all, i've done a lot of file sharing with windows and some with nautilus on linux
2008-06-22T23:26:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	well to do file sharing you need samba, it installs it for you so I figured you'd know
2008-06-22T23:27:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	no i had no clue, it must have been installed for me or something, mine works but i didn't set up anything
2008-06-22T23:27:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	I'm also trying to get it to require authencation to even see the ubuntu shares
2008-06-22T23:28:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	i could try to find out but i have no idea, never did any of that
2008-06-22T23:36:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	when you create a share you can make it so they have to login
2008-06-22T23:36:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	how?
2008-06-22T23:36:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	it's on the second tab when making the share
2008-06-22T23:36:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	really? I didn't see a 2nd tab... but I'll look
2008-06-22T23:36:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	you go to the samba gui and double click the share, it's the access tab
2008-06-22T23:37:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	what samba gui? guess I'll go look now
2008-06-22T23:37:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	mynetdude	install the samba gui via add/remove and then go to it
2008-06-22T23:39:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	lol oh... didn't realize samba required a gui too :P
2008-06-22T23:55:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	I got the samba GUI, I had the /root shared via the folder sharing properties then when I looked at the samba gui it wasn't there, so I manually added it in which it did... but then when I looked at the folder sharing properties it is no longer shared and I can still access it without logging in even though I selected a user already
2008-06-23T00:59:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	what do you use for samba GUI?
2008-06-23T00:59:00.000Z	mynetdude	MrWizeGuy1983	I believe there are a few of them
