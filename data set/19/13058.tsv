2005-05-24T11:35:00.000Z	ogi_		How do I edit "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"? nothing happens when I try to write
2005-05-24T11:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	you need to be root. what editor are you using?
2005-05-24T11:37:00.000Z	ogi_		I did it as sudo with gedit
2005-05-24T11:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	say it's gedit. then type 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf' in a terminal window
2005-05-24T11:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	err
2005-05-24T11:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	what error does gedit give?
2005-05-24T11:37:00.000Z	ogi_	HappyFool	 none..
2005-05-24T11:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	after you've finished the edit, you need to restart x
2005-05-24T11:38:00.000Z	ogi_	HappyFool	 the problem is I can't edit it..nothing happens when I try to write and so on..
2005-05-24T11:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	oh, you mean when you try to type?
2005-05-24T11:39:00.000Z	ogi_	HappyFool	 yes
2005-05-24T11:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	hrm
2005-05-24T11:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	that only happens to me when i start gedit *without* sudo
2005-05-24T11:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	try 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf' again?
2005-05-24T11:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	also, check the permissions on /etc/X11/xorg.org -- try 'ls -l /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2005-05-24T11:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	it should look something like this: '-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3036 2005-04-13 22:13 /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2005-05-24T11:41:00.000Z	ogi_		How stupid am I really..I didn't do it as sudo after all..I seem to become blind..
2005-05-24T11:41:00.000Z	ogi_		thanks anyawy
2005-05-24T11:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	ogi_	ah-ha ;)
