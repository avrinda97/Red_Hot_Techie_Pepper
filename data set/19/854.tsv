2012-02-12T07:40:00.000Z	Simon1245		Oh and they release a new release every 6th month?
2012-02-12T07:41:00.000Z	Simon1245		I used to use linux for like 2-3 years ago for testing and at that time I heard about it
2012-02-12T07:43:00.000Z	Simon1245		By the way what button is "Super" key?
2012-02-12T07:43:00.000Z	Simon1245		Oh

2012-02-12T07:44:00.000Z	Simon1245		Is Wine easy to use?
2012-02-12T07:46:00.000Z	Simon1245		Now too lazy to reinstall Windows again so I was hopin gthat it would work to use every Windows thing on here
2012-02-12T07:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	Simon1245	no recovery partition?
2012-02-12T07:49:00.000Z	Simon1245	urlin2u	Not sure honestly, it was on the computer that I could create a recovery disk but I didn't find it until it was like 1 hour left till I broke it.. I mean before breaking it
2012-02-12T07:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	Simon1245	if you bought it new and got no dvd for reinstall you have a recovery partition.
2012-02-12T07:51:00.000Z	Simon1245	urlin2u	Ah, that's right I didn't get a dvd with it
2012-02-12T07:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	Simon1245	you can probably recover it from a f8 prompt, but it will overwrite the main partition.
2012-02-12T07:53:00.000Z	Simon1245	urlin2u	I was checking at F8 tried to enter the safemode thing didn't work
2012-02-12T07:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	Simon1245	not sure with this model safemode is not recovery though call the manufacturer if you want to do it is what I would do.
2012-02-12T07:54:00.000Z	Simon1245	urlin2u	I would've done it the problem is that I bought this laptop in USA
2012-02-12T07:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	Simon1245	not sure what that means but okay.
