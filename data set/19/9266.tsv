2006-12-03T15:10:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	the latest drivers from the website but they are used for aiglx they are used to run beryl on plain xorg
2006-12-03T15:11:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	not used to run aiglx*
2006-12-03T15:12:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	well you need the kernel source to install the nvidia drivers from nvidia website
2006-12-03T15:13:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	not the latest drivers ubuntu is using the 8776 drivers
2006-12-03T15:13:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	but you can install the nvidia drivers they are in multiverse
2006-12-03T15:14:00.000Z	Tominator	kitche	i know, bit they are to olt to work with beryl, aren't they? so i tried to install the newer ones, but some of them won't work, some of them are buggy, and some of them won't install...
2006-12-03T15:14:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	you need XGL to use the drivers in ubuntu
2006-12-03T15:15:00.000Z	Tominator	kitche	thats too buggy either :)
2006-12-03T15:15:00.000Z	Tominator	kitche	thats why i tried to install the newer nvidia-drivers
2006-12-03T15:16:00.000Z	kitche	Tominator	well you can download the linux-source from the repo and get the nvidia driver that way
2006-12-03T15:17:00.000Z	Tominator	kitche	does the newest one install then?
