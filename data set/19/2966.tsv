2010-02-05T18:11:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Good afternoon.  I'm having a recurring problem with sound getting stuck in a loop when either using a music app (Amarok) or watching flash vids on Firefox.  This will be the 3rd time I've needed to reboot this week, so it's getting a bit tedious.  I'm using Ibix, sound device: nVidia MCP61 HDA
2010-02-05T18:12:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Can anyone help, apart from upgrade to Jaunty (can't atm, it's a webdev box that I want to keep same release as production)?  I seriously can't believe I need to be rebooting so often to solve sound issues!
2010-02-05T18:14:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Should I *not* use pulseaudio on ibex?
2010-02-05T18:16:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		No one can help with repeated audio issues?
2010-02-05T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	"repeated audio issues" is vague, try being more specific

2010-02-05T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	does it happen if you never use flash?
2010-02-05T18:19:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	jrib	I couldn't say, I work as a webdev, disabling flash would be a bit of a problem.
2010-02-05T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	I don't usually work while I troubleshoot
2010-02-05T18:20:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	jrib	Currently on lunch break.  Problem is that it only happens every couple of days.
2010-02-05T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	usually flash is the culprit so that would be my first guess.  Otherwise, check dmesg when it happens and play with pulse
2010-02-05T18:27:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	jrib	Found odd kernal msg: "ppdev0: unregistered pardevice"
2010-04-21T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	iirc, you are asked to set one during install
2010-04-21T15:49:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	jrib	That's what I though.  I used synaptic.  It did not prompt me.
2010-04-21T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	try dpkg-reconfigure whatever-the-package-was
2010-04-21T15:50:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	jrib	No apparent response to dkpg-reconfigure
2010-04-21T15:50:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	just reset the password I guess, the mysql docs have instructions
2010-04-21T15:51:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	jrib	Aye, there's the deb hack.  Strange that I have to though.  I thought default pword was blank.  Something's obviously changed in karmic.
2010-04-21T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	FunkyWeasel	it did used to be blank but I seem to recall having to set a password in debconf so it must have changed.  It should have still worked even if you used synaptic though
