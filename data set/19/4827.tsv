2009-06-27T10:53:00.000Z	halberd		I have a wireless home network with laptops that are configured with dhcp on my home router, and I want to computers by name instead of by IP (which changes).  Is ddns the best way to do this?
2009-06-27T10:53:00.000Z	halberd		want to refer to them by name
2009-06-27T10:54:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	in relation  to other computers on the network?
2009-06-27T10:54:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	or in relation to other comnps on the internet?
2009-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	you could setup a DNS server
2009-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	what are the different computers doing between eachother?
2009-06-27T10:56:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	various things, such as ssh and unison
2009-06-27T10:57:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	but maybe that might be too complicated with  a lot of computers
2009-06-27T10:57:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	but I think messing around with the IPs assigned to my computers might require me to ditch my router for an always-up Linux computer to be the server
2009-06-27T10:58:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	basically what I'm wondering is, is there any alternative to ddns or static ips?
2009-06-27T10:58:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	not it doesn't. Assign on the router static IPS, have each computer setup with the right hostname, and you're fine
2009-06-27T10:59:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	actually, if you already have hostnames setup (which you would if you installed Ubuntu the regualr way) then it should already work
2009-06-27T10:59:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	what do you mean?
2009-06-27T11:00:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	hrm. It depends on the router you have to be honest.
2009-06-27T11:01:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	have you tried just ssh'ing using the remote computer's nasme?
2009-06-27T11:02:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	well I tried ssh'ing using the name that I get on the remote computer when I type "hostname"
2009-06-27T11:02:00.000Z	porter1	halberd	with openssh installed?
2009-06-27T11:02:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	ssh is installed, it works if I enter an IP
2009-06-27T11:04:00.000Z	halberd	porter1	I don't think my router lets me set static IP's for my home network, it only does dhcp as far as I can see
