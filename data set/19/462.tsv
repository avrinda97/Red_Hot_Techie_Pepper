2012-10-24T19:05:00.000Z	deadmund		oh :P
2012-10-24T19:05:00.000Z	deadmund		yeah
2012-10-24T19:05:00.000Z	deadmund		ntfs
2012-10-24T19:06:00.000Z	deadmund		And the laptop won't boot the installed OS, windows xp, which is why it was brought to me in the first place)
2012-10-24T19:07:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	install gddrescue then info ddrescue > Fill Mode
2012-10-24T19:07:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	i think this is what you are trying to do...
2012-10-24T19:08:00.000Z	deadmund	_cronus_	I'll take a look at that.  Will it repair NTFS?
2012-10-24T19:08:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	nope
2012-10-24T19:08:00.000Z	deadmund	_cronus_	Well then it is not useful.
2012-10-24T19:08:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	just force relocation of the sectors
2012-10-24T19:08:00.000Z	deadmund	_cronus_	That's what I want to do.  I don't know how to do it.
2012-10-24T19:09:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	it uses a 2 stage procedure. first it finds the bad blocks and then it writes zero to it (thus forcing firmware to relocate)
2012-10-24T19:10:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	but it knows nothing about ntfs
2012-10-24T19:10:00.000Z	deadmund	_cronus_	ddrescue does this?  If it doesn't work with ntfs then it won't solve my problem right?  The 36 sectors are on an ntfs partition.
2012-10-24T19:13:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	i'm not sure that i would trust a disk with so many sectors bad to be honest
2012-10-24T19:14:00.000Z	deadmund	_cronus_	You should see the number of already remapped sectors! (hint: it is not small)
2012-10-24T19:15:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	i support dr_willis opinion, copy everything to a new disk
2012-10-24T19:18:00.000Z	_cronus_	deadmund	it is not a keyword i am afraid, it's a procedure. use the command info ddrescue and check under fill mode
2012-10-24T19:18:00.000Z	deadmund	_cronus_	will do!
