2012-09-16T02:30:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	which kernel version are you building against?
2012-09-16T02:31:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	: 11.10
2012-09-16T02:32:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	The symbol "dev_dbg_ratelimited" wasn't added to the kernel until v3.5
2012-09-16T02:33:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	Huh? Did I use that somewhere?
2012-09-16T02:33:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	Look at the build log you pasted
2012-09-16T02:34:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	I think you've got the wrong guy
2012-09-16T02:34:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	I apologise... I think my eyes mis-scanned!
2012-09-16T02:36:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	For postfix. Check its 'recommends' and make sure they're installed
2012-09-16T02:37:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	Ok, thanks. How do I do that? :/
2012-09-16T02:40:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	You can check using "apt-cache show postfix | egrep '(Depends|Recommends|Suggests)'"
2012-09-16T02:40:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	When you got that 500 error... were you telnet-ing manually to the SMTP server?
2012-09-16T02:43:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	yes
2012-09-16T02:44:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	The 500 may have been your using the incorrect syntax. What precisely did you send it for the EHLO ?
2012-09-16T02:44:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	https://gist.github.com/3730186
2012-09-16T02:45:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	though the bad syntax message came after pressing enter
2012-09-16T02:45:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	I think that 500 error is caused by bad postfix config. You get a 250 for the EHLO
2012-09-16T02:45:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	I'd be having postfix check the config
2012-09-16T02:57:00.000Z	macmartine	TJ-	actually things seem to be working. i just a test email. only thing now is that mac mail isn't connecting with the old settings. there must be some configs that need to be reset for dovecot?
2012-09-16T02:59:00.000Z	TJ-	macmartine	possibly - make sure the authentication is working. check the log files in /var/log/
