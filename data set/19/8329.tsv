2007-08-23T10:10:00.000Z	Megaqwerty		Anyone know how I could pipe the results of a bunch of different programs into another? (i.e. echo "this" && echo "is" && echo "a" && echo "test" | zenity --text-info --title "Testbox" )
2007-08-23T10:10:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	Yes, you can use a subshell
2007-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	For example ( cmd && cmd2 && cmd3 ) | someothercommand
2007-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	mbt	Ah! thanks.
2007-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	No problemo.
2007-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	That's particularly useful for statically scripting telnet sessions :)
2007-08-23T10:26:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	mbt	why do you say that? Haven't you heard they "signed up to be defender of linux"
2007-08-23T10:26:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	Google?  But they're not helping me with my problem.  :(
2007-08-23T10:27:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	mbt	any way I could help? or is it server side?
2007-08-23T10:27:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	Basically, trying to get pecl to work correctly.  It complains of a lack of the xmlrpc extension, but that's installed and enabled...
2007-08-23T10:28:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	and phpinfo() run both through the CLI and Apache PHP setup says it's activated, but pecl says no go.
2007-08-23T10:29:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	mbt	man, it's times like these I wish I knew what pecl was... I wonder if google will be nicer to me....
2007-08-23T10:29:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	pecl is the PHP interface to PEAR
2007-08-23T10:29:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	Supposed to be able to install custom scripts and the like.  Need it to try to interface an app with Amazon S3, which requires some libs
2007-08-23T10:30:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	mbt	not knowing this stuff...I can only work with one issue at a time...working on the pecl xmlrpc issue
2007-08-23T10:31:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	Understandable.  I am going to check that thing out about using the debian manager to build it.  That might be interesting, if it works.
2007-08-23T10:32:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	mbt	alright. I think I've hurt my head enough tonight...I'm going to stick with stuff I know in the channel...good luck.
2007-08-23T10:33:00.000Z	mbt	Megaqwerty	Understandable, thanks anyway :)
