2009-11-11T23:21:00.000Z	jlabomb	mahngiel	has anyone been able to fix it?
2009-11-11T23:22:00.000Z	mahngiel	jlabomb	not to my knowledge. you can surf the ubuntu forums
2009-11-11T23:22:00.000Z	jlabomb	mahngiel	I have been doing that, I found one step that fixed it until I rebooted  but seems like it is affecting a large ammount of people
2009-11-11T23:23:00.000Z	mahngiel	jlabomb	as with any new release, there are always kinks. just like the suspend issue on laptops
2009-11-11T23:24:00.000Z	mahngiel	jlabomb	just gotta wait it out i guess bro
2009-11-11T23:24:00.000Z	jlabomb	mahngiel	I have a laptop that 9.10 wont boot in is that what you mean?
2009-11-11T23:24:00.000Z	mahngiel	jlabomb	the suspend you referring to?
2009-11-11T23:25:00.000Z	jlabomb		yeah when you try to boot live cd or from update it just sits in black with a cursor blinking on my laptop

2009-11-11T23:26:00.000Z	mahngiel	jlabomb	yes, that is a huge issue atm . i've tried a few different kernels with no avail
2009-11-11T23:27:00.000Z	jlabomb	mahngiel	ok I thought that was just me
2009-11-11T23:27:00.000Z	mahngiel	jlabomb	there's a huge bug report with launchpad, i would recommend subscribing to it

2009-11-11T23:37:00.000Z	jlabomb	mahngiel	I am going to reboot and see if taking my router out of the resolvconf file stays, if fixed the slow problem
