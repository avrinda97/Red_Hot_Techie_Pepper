2012-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	WeThePeople		when i boot to ubuntu from dual boot menu the screen flashes and then a gui comes up and says "ubuntu is running in low graphics mode. your screen, graphics card and input device settings could not be detected correctly. you will need to configure these yourself. then i click 'ok' and the screen flickers some more and a gui comes up and says "stand by one minute while display restarts" but doesnt. then i click 'ok' and then i restart
2012-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	WeThePeople		 from there cuz it loads the boot screen and gets stuck there. i can type but i cant pull up a tty. and when the screen flickers i can see 'ntp.conf'

2012-09-27T08:02:00.000Z	WeThePeople	designbybeck	so the menu where i select what kernel i want is the grub menu.. 10.04
2012-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	designbybeck		correct WeThePeople
2012-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	designbybeck		ah yes... seems 11.10 and before I had these kinda problems
2012-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	designbybeck		so maybe nomodeset will let you get in. and then you'll have to install other video drivers maybe?
2012-09-27T08:04:00.000Z	WeThePeople	designbybeck	yes i can this takes place after i select newest kernel
