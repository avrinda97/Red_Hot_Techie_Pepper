2008-05-21T09:05:00.000Z	provolik		How can I simulate the 'enter' signal in a cron way?
2008-05-21T09:07:00.000Z	provolik		kappacino, I run XP on a vmware with 1gb of ram and it works very well. It runs perfectly a fastcad application.
2008-05-21T09:08:00.000Z	provolik		I need a way to simulate the pression of the enter button every day at a certain time. Is this possible?
2008-05-21T09:08:00.000Z	astro76	provolik	what is supposed to receive the Enter?
2008-05-21T09:09:00.000Z	provolik	astro76	Do you mean what application?
