2011-05-06T01:06:00.000Z	Cheese		Hey
2011-05-06T01:07:00.000Z	Cheese		I just installed fedora which got rid of my old GRUB2 and ubuntu is not included in the new boot loader GRUB .97. Is there any way i can add ubuntu to this new bootloader?
2011-05-06T01:08:00.000Z	Cheese		How do i add an operating system to GRUB
2011-05-06T01:08:00.000Z	Cheese		Oh im sorry
2011-05-06T01:09:00.000Z	Cheese		I was just rephrasing because the first thing i said was kinda confusing>
2011-05-06T01:10:00.000Z	Cheese		This version of GRUB is not detecting 11.04 on my PC
2011-05-06T01:12:00.000Z	Chepoll	Cheese	there was an app called BootManager or something in the repositories. Check it via Synaptic and you may find something that enables you to config the grub file a tad bit easier.
2011-05-06T01:13:00.000Z	Cheese		you have to be a member of fedora to use there IRC channel
2011-05-06T01:14:00.000Z	Cheese	Chepoll	is there no way to boot into a certain partition before booting into an operating system?
2011-05-06T01:15:00.000Z	Cheese		Is there any way to boot into it by entering a command or somethign?
2011-05-06T01:16:00.000Z	Chepoll	Cheese	If I remember right, Grub mounts the partition and then initiates the kernel on it. I was puzzled by how to do it by hand but perhaps you can. Just boot to grub, and then switch to console mode and there you have a set of commands to work with.
2011-05-06T01:17:00.000Z	Cheese	Chepoll	i think ill just reinstall grub2. Im very new to this kind of stuff
2011-05-06T01:17:00.000Z	Chepoll	Cheese	good luck is all I can say.
2011-05-06T01:17:00.000Z	Chepoll		My keyboard layout for virtual consoles gets reset at every boot, and I have to reconfigure console-data. How can I fix this please?
2011-05-06T01:18:00.000Z	Cheese		Ok for grub2 reinstallation, you have to know the partition to mount it to.
2011-05-06T01:19:00.000Z	Cheese		And i have 3 partitions that i dont know of. First off i have windows, fedora, and ubuntu. Then i have a 500mb one, a 10gb one, and a 3gb one
2011-05-06T01:19:00.000Z	Cheese		Im not sure which one is the bootloader :/
2011-05-06T01:19:00.000Z	Cheese		How big is a bootloader partition usually?
2011-05-06T01:20:00.000Z	Chepoll	Cheese	you can use the gui tool gksudo gparted to check yours, fyi.
