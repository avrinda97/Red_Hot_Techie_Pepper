2005-10-27T08:52:00.000Z	Bonzodog		but it's msn only
2005-10-27T08:53:00.000Z	Bonzodog		KDE is a desktop
2005-10-27T08:53:00.000Z	Bonzodog		there are a lot of desktop environments available for linux
2005-10-27T08:54:00.000Z	Bonzodog		KDE = Bloat
2005-10-27T08:54:00.000Z	Bonzodog		can't stand it
2005-10-27T08:54:00.000Z	Bonzodog		have also used afterstep, fluxbox,blackbox....
2005-10-27T08:55:00.000Z	Bonzodog		XFCE isn't bad
2005-10-27T08:55:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	those are all window managers.  that's not the same as a desktop environment.  you can run any of those window managers in place of metacity (which gnome uses)
2005-10-27T08:57:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	uk. isn't ok.
2005-10-27T10:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	you can run this to find out: echo $(host ie.archive.ubuntu.com | awk '{print $4}')
2005-10-27T10:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	2 of the 4 are working.
2005-10-27T10:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	what IP addresses do you see for the ie. servers?
2005-10-27T10:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	and all 4 of those are working for you?
2005-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	'cos I think ...167 and ...193 don't have any packages
2005-10-27T10:04:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	that's because you got lucky - you're using one of the 2 that works.
2005-10-27T10:05:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	visit http://82.211.81.167/ubuntu/dists and you'll see it's not working.  visit http://82.211.81.151/ubuntu/dists and it's fine.
2005-10-27T10:05:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	do you see the same?
2005-10-27T10:06:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	the us.archive.ubuntu.com name resolves to a different 4 IP addresses, and they all work.
2005-10-27T10:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Bonzodog	you can use private if you're registered.
