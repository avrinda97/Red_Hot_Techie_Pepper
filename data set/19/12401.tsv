2005-09-20T14:28:00.000Z	Will^Draven		how can i blank a cdrw?
2005-09-20T14:29:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	cdrecord -v -dev=YOUR-DEVICE -blank=fast
2005-09-20T14:30:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	of course, you'll have to know the name of the device
2005-09-20T14:30:00.000Z	Will^Draven	topyli	how do i determine my device, cdrecord -scanbus hates me, lol
2005-09-20T14:31:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	if you have a regular IDE cd drive, try cdrecord -scanbus -dev=ATAPI
2005-09-20T14:32:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	i guess your device will be -dev=ATAPI:/dev/hdc or some such
2005-09-20T14:35:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	sorry, you'll dev will be someting like ATAPI:0,0,0 or whatever scanbus tells you
2005-09-20T14:35:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	your, not you'll :)
2005-09-20T14:38:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	ok then. make an alias like "alias blank='sudo cdrecord -dev=ATAPI:/dev/hdd -blank=fast' in your bashrc :)
2005-09-20T14:39:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	then you can always just give the "blank" command in the future :)
2005-09-20T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	.bashrc in your home directory. note the dot, it's a hidden file
2005-09-20T14:42:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	see my bashrc for alias examples, they are mighty handy: http://siltala.net/comp/dot-bashrc
2005-09-20T14:42:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	yours would be like "blankcd='cdrecord -whateveryouroptionsare'
2005-09-20T14:43:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	easier to open a terminal and command: gedit .bashrc
2005-09-20T14:44:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	also, look at the first lines of my file. you need the "source global environment first" part
2005-09-20T14:45:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	every line that begins with a # is a comment, and not code
2005-09-20T14:46:00.000Z	Will^Draven	topyli	i understand comments and code, i started programming when i was 11, i just moved to linux however, lol
2005-09-20T14:46:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	ok, you're home
2005-09-20T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	Will^Draven	i just looked at my bashrc and see that my path is screwed. i have to fix it :)
