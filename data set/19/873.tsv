2011-08-05T14:43:00.000Z	nbest		 Hello.  A lot of times when I try to copy text from a web page I get a lot of things like "\u2019s" inserted in it.  Can anyone tell me why this is and what I can do about it?

2011-08-05T15:26:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	did u find any with apt-cache searchv?
2011-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	i spotted a few here->xdotool, xmacro, keylauncher -- and this project looks promising https://github.com/polyethene/IronAHK#readme
2011-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	there are more tools but takes more advanced knowledge with things like xbindkeys..
2011-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	nbest	yagoo	, yea ironahk is the first one i went for, but it's a project that's been dead for years now
2011-08-05T15:29:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	the last datestamp is apr 7 2011.. so i'm not sure if its entirely dead..
2011-08-05T15:32:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	let me know about the other tools xdotool,xmacro,keylauncher..
2011-08-05T15:32:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	problem with linux is that doing this stuff is possible for many years but it's ugly...
2011-08-05T15:36:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	np..
2011-08-05T15:37:00.000Z	yagoo	nbest	i dunno wtf is wrong with developers i bet a lot of people would like this fully implemented and more graphic friendly
2011-08-05T15:38:00.000Z	nbest	yagoo	  lol, yea, i was getting pretty frustrated trying to dl all these progs and not being able to get any to work , but you still gotta love ubuntu.. free, and secure , a great philosophy
