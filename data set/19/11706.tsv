2006-11-17T09:49:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	eh? from dapper? you just said you're on edgy
2006-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	I have an image of Dapper if the things don't go well
2006-11-17T09:51:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	no, you won't likely be able to upgrade from dapper to feisty directly without going through edgy
2006-11-17T12:43:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	you can set up a greek keyboard. what else?
2006-11-17T12:44:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	I mean for programs. I have set the keyboard, but some programs don't show the greek names but ???
2006-11-17T12:45:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	i don't know - you mean filenames? maybe it's old programs that have no clue about UTF-8, like GTK1.2 programs?
2006-11-17T12:46:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	yes. I mean other programs than gtk2
2006-11-17T12:46:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	i'm not sure that's achievable
2006-11-17T12:46:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	when I start with Greek is ok
2006-11-17T12:47:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	try typing "locale" in a shell. you could probably try playing with those variables (and then starting those non-working programs from the same shell)
2006-11-17T13:29:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	It doesn't work the locale. I made all export in bashrc without luck. the only think I hope to do is to disable the translation of gnome. anyway, thanks
2008-11-01T17:11:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	err, it only says "Error"?
2008-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	yes, and with gksudo it don't work
2008-11-01T17:13:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	sorry, gksudo works, the mount on disks inside gnome and other similar don't work
2008-11-01T17:13:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	do "grep sudo /var/log/auth.log", see if there is anything more meaningful logged there
2008-11-01T17:18:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	I get something like this "sudo: pam_lwidentity(sudo:account): cannot contact daemon"
2008-11-01T17:19:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	ok I found it, it was the likewise-open.. thanks anyway
2008-11-01T17:19:00.000Z	LjL	dxdemetriou	hm? what's that?
2008-11-01T17:21:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	LjL	it's a tool for joining linux to active directory. I used it on my work so ppl could be able to login with their domain account
