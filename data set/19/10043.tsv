2006-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Hedgie		Make sure it has 700 permissions "sudo chmod 700 filename" and put it in the /etc/rcx.d/ directories
2006-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Hedgie		The numbers mean the different runlevels -- man runlevel for info on those
2006-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Hedgie		In /etc
2006-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Hedgie		Every script in rcx.d runs whenever the computer starts in runlevel x
2006-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Hedgie		Spectator -- Yes, instead of x they are numbers.  Like /etc/rc5.d, or /etc/rc2.d
2006-08-06T06:37:00.000Z	Hedgie		Spectator -- I think by default you only need to put it in /etc/rc2.d
2006-08-06T06:39:00.000Z	Hedgie		Shak -- du
2006-08-06T06:40:00.000Z	Hedgie		Minim -- I'll try.  brb
2006-08-06T06:42:00.000Z	Hedgie		Shak -- Try du -h --max-depth 1
2006-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	sethk	Hedgie	I think you mean du -sh
2006-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	Hedgie	sethk	-- If that's what you'd prefer.
2006-08-06T06:44:00.000Z	Hedgie		okt -- Nope.
2006-08-06T06:44:00.000Z	sethk	Hedgie	it isn't what I prefer, it's what du allows
2006-08-06T06:45:00.000Z	Hedgie	sethk	-- They're two different things -s shows a summary, --max-depth stops it from display subdirectories.
2006-08-06T06:45:00.000Z	Hedgie		Try them, they both do different things than just du -h
2006-08-06T06:45:00.000Z	Hedgie		alex -- Good point, thanks.
2006-08-06T06:46:00.000Z	sethk	Hedgie	quoted from the man page:  "--max-depth=0" is the same as --summaraize.  However I didn't know you could use max-depth with du.
2006-08-06T06:46:00.000Z	sethk	Hedgie	however, the result is identical:  du -sh *
