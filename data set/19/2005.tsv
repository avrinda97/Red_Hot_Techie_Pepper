2012-02-04T19:16:00.000Z	linusoleander		I'm having some strange problem with my clock on my server machine.
2012-02-04T19:16:00.000Z	linusoleander		It's about 20% faster than normal. I used date -s "time" to reset it last night, and now it's 3h and 22 min off.
2012-02-04T19:16:00.000Z	linusoleander		The npt update is turned of as of yesterday â€“ just in case. What can the problem be?
2012-02-04T19:17:00.000Z	linusoleander		It appeard 2 days ago
2012-02-04T19:19:00.000Z	mintman	linusoleander	does this pose a problem with what the software the server runs??
2012-02-04T19:20:00.000Z	linusoleander	mintman	It times out (if that's the correct word) when i'm usig hwclock, tried it last night
2012-02-04T19:20:00.000Z	linusoleander	mintman	Yes it does, one of my apps is very dependent of the server clock

2012-02-04T19:22:00.000Z	linusoleander	mintman	I'll call the maintainer and ask.
2012-02-04T19:24:00.000Z	mintman	linusoleander	I wouldn't go that route I would go through log files see what the last update was before the clock started out of cycle..
