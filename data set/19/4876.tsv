2010-03-29T04:40:00.000Z	rdvonz	histo	Thanks, I'm just baffled as to why this happened a week after installing. It was working fine at 1280x1024 resolution before..
2010-03-29T04:40:00.000Z	histo	rdvonz	upgrade to one of the X packages probably
2010-03-29T04:41:00.000Z	histo	rdvonz	you could try rolling back if you figure otu which package.  most like xserver-video-s3 or somethign like that.
2010-03-29T04:41:00.000Z	histo	rdvonz	you may have the old package in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2010-03-29T04:41:00.000Z	rdvonz	histo	Wow, the forum thread you sent me is the EXACT same thing that's happening too me. Even the same distro.
