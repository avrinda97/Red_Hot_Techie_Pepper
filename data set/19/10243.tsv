2006-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	gonniff		I'm finding LAN and wireless don't like each other on my laptop (using Dapper)
2006-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	gonniff		Has anyone else had this problem?
2006-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	SurfnKid	gonniff	what prob?
2006-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	SurfnKid	gonniff	what card
2006-07-08T09:16:00.000Z	gonniff		If I leave the office without deactivating ethernet, my wireless won't work at home
2006-07-08T09:16:00.000Z	gonniff	SurfnKid	not sure - let me try to check - I've got a loaner machine from the office
2006-07-08T09:17:00.000Z	SurfnKid	gonniff	do ifconfig down/up the adapter and try searching for an essid  or unless youre wired, attempt to down/up the interface
2006-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	SurfnKid		Dam im  just happy i was able to get my wifi and ATI card in less than 15 minutes going, that was a super fast setup, now i just need my fans working and XGL
2006-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	gonniff	SurfnKid	yeah, I've done that, thanks for the tip. It's working now, it just seems to be a case of turn off LAN or boot at home, deactiveate both, and reboot a couple of times otherwise
2006-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	gonniff		My card info is as follows: RealTek RTL8139  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8100B/8139D'
2006-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	SurfnKid	gonniff	sounds like a pain if youve got work you want to continue without rebooting
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		yeah, it sure is. But then, ACPI really doesn't like this either. :)
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	SurfnKid		really? is it set up in the lsmod?
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		I tried a test this morning: closed all apps, locked the screen and then came back about 15 minutes later. Machine was locked up. Had to reboot.
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		I'm not complaining - I think Dapper rules!
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	SurfnKid	gonniff	my breezy had acpi broken or just not complete, but dapper got it all put together
2006-07-08T09:19:00.000Z	gonniff		I used to be a huge SuSE fan, but this is much better for daily computing
2006-07-08T09:20:00.000Z	SurfnKid	gonniff	yeah definitely
2006-07-08T09:20:00.000Z	gonniff	SurfnKid	funny that! I wonder what's the deal with this laptop. But then again, it's not mine - it belongs to the company, so I can't complain
