2005-02-27T14:54:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg		am i automatically labelled a moron for wanting to use a WM other than metacity or something?
2005-02-27T14:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	heh - Havoc doesn't want you to!
2005-02-27T14:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	I think you can use update-alternatives, but I can't recall exactly how
2005-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	try installing timidity and freepats
2005-07-16T11:04:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	thoreauputic	i got timidity and freepats installed on the other machine. "timidity foo.mid" plays, but playmidi, pmimi, kmid, rosegarden etc. don't give any midi output.
2005-07-16T11:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	yeah, you need jack/jackd and a lot of patience :/
2005-07-16T11:06:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	thoreauputic	assuming i got some patience, what should i read?
2005-07-16T11:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	looking now - hang on
2005-07-16T11:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	this might be a start >> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
2005-07-16T11:08:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	thoreauputic	don't soundblaster-compatible soundcards support hardware midi?
2005-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	for a nicer GUI frontend to timidity install timidity-interfaces-extra and call timidity as "timidity -ig "
2005-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	yes, if you have a card that supports hardware midi life is easier
2005-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	thoreauputic	easier how? what are the step that i should do differently?
2005-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	I have a crappy onboard card so i only know about soft synth etc, sorry
2005-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	thoreauputic	alright, do you know who should i ask about hardware midi?
2005-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	from memory you can install a sound font and use it directly without soft synth
2005-07-16T11:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	try  the alsa home page - I think there's info on midi there
2005-07-16T11:13:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	thoreauputic	thanks, i will
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	H0lyD4wg	http://linux-sound.org/  << lots of info here
