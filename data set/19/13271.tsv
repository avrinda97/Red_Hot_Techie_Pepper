2006-06-25T14:51:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	there are....   see http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2006-06-25T14:52:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	search for 'qt' on the  http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2006-06-25T14:52:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	it depends what you mean by install qt3 ;-)
2006-06-25T14:55:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	well... you trying te  _compile from source_  open kiosk ?
2006-06-25T14:55:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	if that is the case you will need to install all the relevant -dev  versions of the packages etc.
2006-06-25T14:56:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	well... is there a package for something similar (in requirements) in ubuntu-dapper as the  open kiosk ?
2006-06-25T14:57:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	if so, you can 'sudo apt-get build-dep (package)' and it will install all the necessities to compile that (package)
2006-06-25T15:17:00.000Z	enyc	hareem	hareem  you may find libqt3-mt-dev  and such ilke packages....
