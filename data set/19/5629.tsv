2008-06-05T20:27:00.000Z	Ironeye		Hi everyone. Ever since upgrading the ubuntu software package lots of things have gone wrong. So my question is can i roll back to the previous version?
2008-06-05T20:29:00.000Z	Ironeye		﻿bazhang_ yeah
2008-06-05T20:30:00.000Z	Ironeye		﻿bazhang_ how do i re-install 7.10 ?
2008-06-05T20:31:00.000Z	Ironeye		ahh ok, will i loose everything on harddrive?
2008-06-05T20:33:00.000Z	Ironeye		hmm it took a long time to get everything working when it was at 7.10. Maybe someone can help iron out the issues i have at the moment
2008-06-05T20:34:00.000Z	Ironeye		1st problem is this pc connects to a wireless router. When running ubuntu 7.10 it worked fine. since upgrading it does not start up with the connect automaticaly. It would then ask for the passphrase every 5-10 minutes. Any ideas how to resolve this one?
