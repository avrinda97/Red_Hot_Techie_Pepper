2005-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	testt	perhaps it would be better if you put your /etc/fstab and the output of 'sudo fdisk -l' up here: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	testt	i'll put my fstab up there too, fwiw
2005-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	testt	HappyFool	I just found out what the problem is.. my /home partition is beeing recognized as a Win95 LFS
2005-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	testt		damn

2005-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	testt	weird
2005-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	testt	HappyFool	acctualy this is it  W95 Ext'd (LBA)
2005-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	testt	HappyFool	anyway I can convert it to ext3 without loosing data
2005-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	testt		I have everything there :0
2005-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	testt	ah. those are extended partitions -- you should have a /dev/hda5 or something
2005-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	testt	which is the 'real' partition
2005-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	testt	have you taken a look at 'sudo fdisk -l' ?
2005-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	testt	HappyFool	yup
