2006-05-26T08:56:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	usually the makefile has an env variable CC - try 'export CC=gcc-3.4'
2006-05-26T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	then .configure, make etc.
2006-05-26T08:58:00.000Z	_mason	Frogzoo	Sorry youve lost me, when i 'export CC=gcc-3.4' it doesnt output anything, but no errors? where do i find .configure and do what with it?
2006-05-26T09:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	what are you building? usually the process is '.configure ; make ; make install' ...
2006-05-26T09:05:00.000Z	_mason	Frogzoo	Qemu, but for now, that wiki link told me to 'apt-get build-dep <package>', Package = gemu-0.8.1 but i get an error  E: You must put some 'source' URIs in your sources.list
2006-05-26T09:05:00.000Z	_mason	Frogzoo	I already have the latest build-essential
2006-05-26T09:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	looks like you need to add a repo to the qemu source...
2006-05-26T09:06:00.000Z	_mason	Frogzoo	Add a repository in Synaptic ?
2006-05-26T09:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	indeed
2006-05-26T09:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	afaik there's no apt source repos for qemu - just build from source without using apt - qemu's docs describe the process quite well
2006-05-27T08:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	_mason	ask in #ubuntu+1
