2007-12-21T09:45:00.000Z	Notos	Ashfire908	well i think i will go with the apt-get linux-386 :(
2007-12-21T09:46:00.000Z	Ashfire908		notos: oh. is your sys a 64-bit?
2007-12-21T09:47:00.000Z	Notos	Ashfire908	good question but i dont think so as i am runing the x86 live cd
2007-12-21T09:47:00.000Z	Ashfire908		notos: then the 386 is fine.
2007-12-21T09:47:00.000Z	Ashfire908		notos: *the 386 is fine.
2007-12-21T09:48:00.000Z	Notos	Ashfire908	so it takes advantage of the 4 cores?
2007-12-21T09:49:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Notos	386 is the processor architecture. the amount of cores doesn't matter
2007-12-21T09:50:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Notos	(except the cell processor in the ps3. (8 are cell cores and one is powerpc))
