2008-10-02T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	best to just ask the channel your question
2008-10-02T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	get rid of your second |
2008-10-02T17:37:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	Love you man :-D
2008-10-02T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	you realize your command grabs more than just .tex files right?
2008-10-02T17:38:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	really ??
2008-10-02T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	yeah, try just the find command and see
2008-10-02T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	you probably want something like: find -name '*.tex' -type f -print0
2008-10-02T17:41:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	better thanks for picking that up ...
2008-10-02T17:43:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	mate is there a way to make the substitution verbose or interactive
2008-10-02T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	don't know offhand
2008-10-02T17:44:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	thanks for all your help!! it seems safe to you ?
2008-10-02T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	seems fine, though you may want to cp everything as a backup just to be safe.  disk space is cheap, time isn't :)
2008-10-02T17:46:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	:-D thanks !!
2009-11-09T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	you probably need to use tsocks or whatever
2009-11-09T00:52:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	tsocks ?
2009-11-09T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	dan_	yes, tsocks...
2009-11-09T00:53:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	i will look into it , thank you.
2009-11-09T01:03:00.000Z	dan_	jrib	Is Tsocks even available anymore ? I tried to download from their main page and its down
