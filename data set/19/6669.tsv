2011-06-28T15:15:00.000Z	glontu		anyone know how to disable the network manager thing ?
2011-06-28T15:16:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	The default network manager? To end the process run pkill nm-applet however this will kill your connection as well.
2011-06-28T15:16:00.000Z	glontu	shane_	i am trying to set up a router from my box and i think network manager keeps interfereing
2011-06-28T15:17:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	I removed network manager ages ago for wicd and have had no problems since
2011-06-28T15:18:00.000Z	glontu	shane_	how do i remove it ?
2011-06-28T15:18:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	Download WICD and install it then purge network-manager
2011-06-28T15:20:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	apt-get install wicd; apt-get install wicd-daemon;apt-get install python-wicd;apt-get purge network-manager
2011-06-28T15:21:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	Just get wicd-daemon and python-wicd and you should be set to purge network-manager
2011-06-28T15:22:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	Paste your errors
2011-06-28T15:22:00.000Z	glontu	shane_	 RTNETLINK answers: no such process
2011-06-28T15:23:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	Not wrong! I guess youo are trying to modify iptables?
2011-06-28T15:23:00.000Z	glontu	shane_	i am just trying to add a default route for a table
2011-06-28T15:24:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	You are trying to make your box into a router?
2011-06-28T15:24:00.000Z	glontu	shane_	yes, a router with 2 wan's
2011-06-28T15:25:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	Interesting :) I shall look into that, one moment
2011-06-28T15:27:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	First of all I would start of by removing network-manager all together rather than disabling it.
2011-06-28T15:28:00.000Z	glontu	shane_	and should i install the one you recomended ?
2011-06-28T15:29:00.000Z	shane_	glontu	Well there is WICD or editing the OS's networking files.
