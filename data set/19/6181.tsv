2008-03-01T05:08:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		BESIDES...trying to get aircrack going so I can audit my environment.
2008-03-01T05:08:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		(Believe it or not, a genuine cause!)
2008-03-01T05:08:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		I host an apartment wifi spot, yeah.
2008-03-01T05:10:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		brobo: Yes but it should be wlan0 or wlan1
2008-03-01T05:10:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		Eh, anyways...
2008-03-01T05:11:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		So say I got that working. How would I use the patch from aircrack-ng on it?
2008-03-01T05:11:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		To enable monitoring mode.
2008-03-01T05:11:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki		I'm new to Ubuntu so yeah.
2008-03-01T05:11:00.000Z	Pelo	Yuji1_Saeki	please stop using the enter key for punctuation , it scrolls the channel up needlessly
2008-03-01T05:13:00.000Z	Pelo	Yuji1_Saeki	yes
2008-03-01T05:14:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki	Pelo	amenado: Alright. My apologies. I am new to IRC in general.
2008-03-01T05:14:00.000Z	Pelo	Yuji1_Saeki	 we get that ,  but this is a support channel with over 1000 ppl in it ,  it is helpfull for everyone to be brief
2008-03-01T05:15:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki	Pelo	Alright then. Perhaps you can help me. Why would my wireless USB show up as an ETH instead of WLAN?
2008-03-01T05:16:00.000Z	Pelo	Yuji1_Saeki	I am useless with wifi sorry , ask again periodicaly
2008-03-01T05:17:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki	Pelo	...Ask again?...Oh in hopes someone else will know? Alright. Perhaps tomorrow. :) One question before I go. I kinda monkey-ed around with usr/src/linux etc and wish to know how to restore it...I'm missing a few...*lot* of drivers now.
2008-03-01T05:17:00.000Z	Pelo	Yuji1_Saeki	just clean install
2008-03-01T05:18:00.000Z	Yuji1_Saeki	Pelo	amenado: Re-INSTALL?!?! Geh, nvm. Thank for your help then. I have no clue what any of that is either.
