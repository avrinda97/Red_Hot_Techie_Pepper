2005-08-01T11:14:00.000Z	puff		Evening.
2005-08-01T11:15:00.000Z	puff		I have this xp box, I'm trying to install ubuntu on it.  Step one, download the ISO for the install.  Step two, create a CD with the ISO.
2005-08-01T11:15:00.000Z	puff		Regarding Step Two... all I have is this XP box, so I used RecordNow, which appears to come pre-installed.
2005-08-01T11:15:00.000Z	puff		I'm not certain this created a bootable Cd, or how I'd check.

2005-12-31T14:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	what're you burning? if it's data or an ISO, use the file manager's built-in burner
2005-12-31T14:57:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	ISO.
2005-12-31T14:57:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	Where would I find this built-in burner?
2005-12-31T14:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	in Ubuntu's file manager, right-click on your ISO file, select the "Burn To Disc" option - done!
2005-12-31T15:00:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	Thanks!
2005-12-31T15:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	more info here, if you need it: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BurningIsoHowto
2006-01-13T09:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	probably somewhere in System menu --> Prefs --> Screensaver
2006-01-13T09:12:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	nickrud:  I checked there first, I don't see anything labeled "Disable screensaver" or the like.  I see "blank after nn minutes" and "cycle after nn minutes" (cycle to a different screen saver image).
2006-01-13T09:13:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	nickrud:  ah-hah, found it.  it's one of the display mode dropdown options.
2006-01-13T09:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	yeah, just found it myself poking around in there :P
2006-01-18T11:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	plug it in, start gthumb, try the "file --> import from camera" option
2006-01-18T11:04:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	It doesn't show up under /media.
2007-02-18T10:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	puff	right at the end, yes - new kernels
2007-02-18T10:50:00.000Z	puff	Madpilot	danke.
