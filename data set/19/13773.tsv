2005-01-24T08:20:00.000Z	froust		does anyone know which cpu's have smp support?
2005-01-24T08:21:00.000Z	froust		or what it is?
2005-01-24T08:21:00.000Z	souki	froust	do you mean hyper-threading ?
2005-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	froust		it just says smp - it's for an amd proc
2005-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	souki	froust	smp is for multiprocessor or huper-threading cpu
2005-01-24T08:24:00.000Z	souki	froust	I don't think amd has hyper-threading support
2005-01-24T08:25:00.000Z	froust	souki	it does
2005-01-24T08:25:00.000Z	froust		smp is symmetric multi processing - ie 2 cpus
2005-01-24T08:25:00.000Z	froust		amd does have hyperthreading
2005-01-24T08:26:00.000Z	souki	froust	I didn't know, I thout it was a trademark for Intel P4
2005-01-24T08:27:00.000Z	froust		sorry - amd has hypertransport
2005-01-24T08:27:00.000Z	froust		which is the same thing, afaik
2005-01-24T08:28:00.000Z	souki	froust	no, I don't think so, HT simulate 2 processor on a single
2005-01-24T08:29:00.000Z	souki	froust	that's why you can run an smp-kernel on a single P4-HY
2005-01-24T08:29:00.000Z	froust		then why does the amd64 k8 kernel support smp?
2005-01-24T08:29:00.000Z	froust		nevermind
2005-01-24T08:29:00.000Z	froust		that made no sense
2005-01-24T08:30:00.000Z	souki	froust	you can have 2x or 4x processor
2005-01-24T08:30:00.000Z	souki	froust	on a single board
