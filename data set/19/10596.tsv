2007-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	unperson		I've been watching Heroes on the NBC website via their flashplayer.  Tonight I went to watch the latest episode and now none of the on-screen controls work.  Has anyone else experienced a similar change recently (on NBC's site or elsewhere)?
2007-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	it happens on some site
2007-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	What puzzles me is that it worked just fine like last week.
2007-11-30T05:03:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	I recommend getting the eps in torrent and downlaoding it , much easier
2007-11-30T05:03:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Sure.  But I was content watching it on the site when it worked.
2007-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	just a suggestion
2007-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Having no ability to pause, skip ahead, etc., sucks.
2007-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Understood and appreciated.
2007-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	I only skip ahead when I watch lost, the eps tend to drag on
2007-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Well, in this case I couldn't pause, so I closed the window, thinking I'd be able to start up where I left off.
2007-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	As it turns out I seem to only be able to watch it all the way through without stopping.
2007-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	flash doesn't work like that unfortunately
2007-11-30T05:06:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Their site had in player controls that would let you...until this week.
2007-11-30T05:06:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	downloading it will let you watch it at leasure and it's probably the same amout of data
2007-11-30T05:07:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Yes, I agree.  No argument that the torrent would be technically superior in every way.
2007-11-30T05:07:00.000Z	Pelo	unperson	donT' panick about that , it might e caused by a number of things, the way the coded this particualr ep, a small change in the flash they used,  whatever, might be ok next week
2007-11-30T05:08:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Yeah.  I'll have to check it out next week to see if it's a consistent thing I guess.
2007-11-30T05:09:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	Well, thanks.  Later.
2008-04-27T08:49:00.000Z	unperson	Pelo	:-P
