2006-07-02T16:27:00.000Z	facefaceface		Couldn't find package libjpeg
2006-07-02T16:29:00.000Z	facefaceface		bleah... do I have to manually install things like libjpeg / libgif / etc?
2006-07-02T16:30:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	Try libjpeg62
2006-07-02T16:30:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	apt-cache search   is your friend
2006-07-02T16:31:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	apt-cache search   is your friend
2006-07-02T16:32:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	If you are trying to compile you want the -dev versions of the packages as well - they have the libraries and headers for building against
2006-07-02T16:34:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	Well if apt-cache search can't find it then it doesn't have it - but perhaps it is called something different
2006-07-02T16:35:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	There seems to be something called giflib3g
2006-07-02T16:35:00.000Z	facefaceface	penguin42	which repo?
2006-07-02T16:35:00.000Z	penguin42	facefaceface	Seems to be in universe
