2006-05-13T06:19:00.000Z	lufis		Hi. I recently wrote about my experience with photo management in Linux and I think it might interest some of you hearing opinions from a newbie. http://sufis.wordpress.com/2006/05/07/photo-management-in-linux/
2006-05-13T06:21:00.000Z	lufis		Can anyone tell me of an easy to use photo import wizard?
2006-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	I've heard that gthumb can do that, but don't quote me unless it works :)
2006-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	ask on #gimp, they know a heck of a lot more
2007-09-08T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	sudo mkdir /var/cache/apt/archives/partial
2007-09-08T09:01:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	thanks!
2007-09-08T09:01:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	That did it. Thanks again.
2007-09-22T15:15:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	lsmod
2007-09-22T15:15:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	macd: thanks :)
2007-09-23T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	module-assistant (and the INSTALL file in the source
2007-09-23T06:50:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	Where's the source, tho?
2007-09-23T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	yes
2007-09-23T06:51:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	after it's compiled, how do I register it?
2007-09-23T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	that's what module-assistant is for
2007-09-23T06:52:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	ok
2007-09-23T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	basically you copy the module into /lib/modules/linux-image-$(uname -r) somewhere and run depmod -a
2008-02-12T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	evince reads them, it comes by default
2008-02-12T07:33:00.000Z	lufis	nickrud	In firefox?
2008-02-12T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	lufis	pops up (preferred by me, anyway)
