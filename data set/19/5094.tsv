2009-08-01T13:21:00.000Z	Machtin	legend2440	hm.. i just moved the .so-file from the 64bit-version to /usr/lib/opera/plugins
2009-08-01T13:21:00.000Z	Machtin		that's the only thing that was in that tar.gz
2009-08-01T13:23:00.000Z	legend2440	Machtin	so its working now?
2009-08-01T13:23:00.000Z	Machtin	legend2440	no.
2009-08-01T13:23:00.000Z	Machtin		that's what i did in the first place.. and it worked in my former installation
2009-08-01T13:23:00.000Z	Machtin		that's what's confusing me actually.. hm.

2009-08-01T13:24:00.000Z	Machtin	legend2440	kubuntu to be more precise.. but that doesn't matter, i guess
2009-08-01T13:26:00.000Z	legend2440	Machtin	well there is a  flash deb file available here but i'm not familiar with x64   http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/  i would uninstall  flashplugin-nonfree first though before i tried the adobe one
2009-08-01T13:26:00.000Z	Machtin	legend2440	never installed it
2009-08-01T13:26:00.000Z	Machtin		and just checked, it's not installed
2009-08-01T13:27:00.000Z	legend2440	Machtin	can you play youtube flash videos? and if so how are you doing that without the plugin?
2009-08-01T13:28:00.000Z	Machtin	legend2440	i have the plugin.. but i used the one from the adobe site. and yes i can play them.. but with no sound :(
