2006-10-29T15:27:00.000Z	nashnash		i try to open Xsane image scanner and it writes me "No devices available" , reasons may be: there is rly no device supported by sane .. i installed sane like this (sudo apt-get install sane) .
2006-10-29T15:28:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	and then do xsane again
2006-10-29T15:22:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	have you added yourself to scan workgroup?
2006-10-29T15:24:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	System => Administration => Users and groups
2006-10-29T15:24:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	open and edit your user and specify rights so you can use scanners on that system
2006-10-29T15:28:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	did you have scanning rights enabled where I told you so?
2006-10-29T15:28:00.000Z	nashnash	pecisk	i added group "scanner" to my user
2006-10-29T15:28:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	do a relogin
2006-10-29T15:38:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	yes?
2006-10-29T15:39:00.000Z	nashnash	pecisk	its still not working but now i came back with screenshot ^^
2006-10-29T15:40:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	ok, clear
2006-10-29T15:40:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	let's look closer
2006-10-29T15:40:00.000Z	nashnash	pecisk	k ;)

2006-10-29T15:40:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	of scanner
2006-10-29T15:44:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	seems like not supported scanner, at least at first glance - http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html
2006-10-29T15:45:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	first, check out HP home page of that scanner
2006-10-29T15:45:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	yes, it can be clearly possible that it works, just not by default
2006-10-29T15:46:00.000Z	pecisk	nashnash	SANE is scanner system, usually vendors when provides drivers, it provides for this system
