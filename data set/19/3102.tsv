2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		i didn't set ip. Just, Listen 80, Listen 82, Listen 8080
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		and 82, and 8080 works fine.
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		i forwarded all the ports to my local machine.
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		apache logs?
2009-11-05T14:18:00.000Z	coolpro1		nothing. my i checked port, in one website, it says the port doesn't seem to be open
2009-11-05T14:18:00.000Z	coolpro1		i am using ASL, and I forwarded port in my Speedtouch router.
2009-11-05T14:18:00.000Z	coolpro1		ADSL
2009-11-05T14:20:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	 sorry connection diedd
2009-11-05T14:25:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	what is your ip or your domain
2009-11-05T14:25:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	as well check your router logs, and your  local apache logs
2009-11-05T14:25:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	while trying to access the ip on port 80
2009-11-05T14:27:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	and your router tells you what?
2009-11-05T14:27:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	as well still waiting for your ip or domain or whatever you are serving...
2009-11-05T14:30:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	should show you are trying to access it though
2009-11-05T14:31:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	k, at this point you need to attempt to access your global ip via port 80. if you cannot do this try port 22 or another unknown port. if you cannot and you are POSITIVE you have your firewall setup correctly then call your isp.
2009-11-05T14:32:00.000Z	tyler_d2	coolpro1	so you need to configure that... not an ubuntu thing or an apache thing.... :)
