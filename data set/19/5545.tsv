2008-06-09T03:12:00.000Z	MaarekStele		I have a question about samba and setting it up so that my XP machine can map a drive to it
2008-06-09T03:13:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	I've done this successfully, how can I help you
2008-06-09T03:13:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	it's installed and I've setup the user, but I still cannot connect from my XP machine
2008-06-09T03:14:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	On the XP box, you get nothing? No authentication window popping up?
2008-06-09T03:15:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	when you try to access the samba share that is
2008-06-09T03:15:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	the authenticaton pops up, but it's not registering the user and pass that I created
2008-06-09T03:16:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	I try to map the drive, and the authentication pops up.  but when I put in the user and password it won't let me in
2008-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	I'd like to see your smb.conf file...
2008-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	did you create a samba user with the smbpasswd command?
2008-06-09T03:18:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	yes:  sudo smbpasswd username
2008-06-09T03:19:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	musikgoat is right
2008-06-09T03:20:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	are they any changes needed for the smb.conf file?
2008-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	I don't know because I usually create the smb.conf file from scratch
2008-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	when installing using the sudo apt-get install samba, the file is created on it's own
2008-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	Yes I know, but I usually delete it and use my own instead
2008-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	any good sites where someone posted a good one?
2008-06-09T03:23:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	Dunno
2008-06-09T03:23:00.000Z	MaarekStele	VikJES	thanks
2008-06-09T03:24:00.000Z	VikJES	MaarekStele	can you access the share from another Ubuntu box
