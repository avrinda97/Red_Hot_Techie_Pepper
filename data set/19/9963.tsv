2011-12-18T10:08:00.000Z	mrmj		i need nvidia-71 or legacy drivers,, the oldest in 11.1 is nvidia-96 :(
2011-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	mrmj		i can but i read on the ubuntu wiki site and forums that its not good or doesnt work by downloading them
2011-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	mrmj		not sure if thats true..
2011-12-18T10:11:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	if all you need is one driver go to the package site and get the deb then use dpkg to install it.
2011-12-18T10:12:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	http:packages.com
2011-12-18T10:13:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	http:packages.ubuntu.com correction on that
2011-12-18T10:14:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	what was the last version you had it on?
2011-12-18T10:15:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	jeezzz, way back eh?
2011-12-18T10:16:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	what Nvidia card is it?
2011-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	you would mess up everything related to updates and dependencies
2011-12-18T10:22:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	install your own nvidia driver.  http://tips-linux.net/en/linux-ubuntu/linux-driver/nvidia-driver-32-bits-part-1
2011-12-18T10:26:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	follow the url directions: yes you have to download the driver plus linux module headers fro the repos you have.
2011-12-18T10:35:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	download the driver from there, yes
2011-12-18T10:36:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	it's a program from Nvidia that makes and installs, configures a driver for you.
2011-12-18T10:37:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	I beleive the program runs and needs an internet connection to get the driver from Nvidia.com or whereever.
2011-12-18T10:39:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	and also it compiles the drive module but it needs linux module headers or linux kernel source. It's simpler to just get the header files unless you are going to be compiling kernels.
2011-12-18T10:40:00.000Z	w30	mrmj	kernel headers have to be installed before the Nvidia install.sh can run.
