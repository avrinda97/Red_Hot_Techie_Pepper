2010-03-06T23:32:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	find a filemanager to suit you? what don't you like about nautilus ?
2010-03-06T23:32:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	are you aware of nautilus scripts ?
2010-03-06T23:33:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	it doesn't understand (chowder: and neither does thunar) extra columns like dimensions or resolution (i.e. attributes about particular file types like images or video)
2010-03-06T23:33:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	ah you mean the extended meta data ?
2010-03-06T23:34:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	are you referring to the search mechanisms in particular ?
2010-03-06T23:34:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	yeah... basically I'd like to be able to sort by resolution - or see at a glance that all videos use the same codec etc
2010-03-06T23:34:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	ok because thats not a fault of nautilus, the culprit there is either beagle or tracker
2010-03-06T23:35:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	such options are not listed in the "Visible Columns" dialogue box... only attributes that are common to all types of files
2010-03-06T23:36:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	i see now, but im pretty sure that it can be extended with python plugins
2010-03-06T23:37:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	ie this chap modified it to show extra kinds of dates : http://www.matijs.net/blog/2009/05/18/very-simple-nautilus-plugin-to-show-deletion-date
2010-03-06T23:38:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	this thread deals with someone who is modifying the context menu via nautilus-python : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=574637
2010-03-06T23:38:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	in short... it can't do it... I need a better file manager thats more on par with windows explorer
2010-03-06T23:48:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	not really... I don't even use MP3's - but I get the general idea... thanks
2010-03-06T23:43:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	looks like it can if you're prepared to script it with that package i linked : after installing it there are examples at /usr/share/doc/python-nautilus/examples/
2010-03-06T23:44:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	/usr/share/doc/python-nautilus/examples/block-size-column.py might be of particular interest to you
2010-03-06T23:47:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	also this is exactly waht you want : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=878683
2010-03-08T06:58:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	it's a poll ffs, it's a matter of personal opinion
2010-03-08T06:58:00.000Z	airtonix	lantizia	its also offtopic and not for this channel
2010-03-08T06:58:00.000Z	lantizia	airtonix	now asked in offtopic :)
