2010-04-08T23:48:00.000Z	sine__		guys seriously my gnome keeps crashing every day and i have to restart it kk 9.10 because im using an intellimouse
2010-04-08T23:48:00.000Z	sine__		what can i do
2010-04-08T23:48:00.000Z	sine__		how can i find out how its messing the gdm up
2010-04-08T23:48:00.000Z	sine__		im in tty1 atm
2010-04-08T23:48:00.000Z	coz_	sine__	 do you have a spare mouse to test this with?
2010-04-08T23:49:00.000Z	sine__		what do you mean, test it as in see if it does not crash
2010-04-08T23:49:00.000Z	coz_	sine__	 yes to see if in fact it is the intelli mouse
2010-04-08T23:49:00.000Z	sine__		it is definatly the intellimouse because the mouse messes up first and then the whole gnome starts to lock up
2010-04-08T23:49:00.000Z	coz_	sine__	 just be sure to shut down the computer to change the mouse unless it is usb
2010-04-08T23:50:00.000Z	sine__		it is usb
2010-04-08T23:50:00.000Z	sine__		OMFG
2010-04-08T23:50:00.000Z	sine__	coz_	why did i not think about unplugging it before !!!!
2010-04-08T23:50:00.000Z	sine__		ive just unplugged it and gnome came back to me
2010-04-08T23:50:00.000Z	sine__		:D
2010-04-08T23:51:00.000Z	coz_	sine__	 ah there you go
2010-04-08T23:51:00.000Z	sine__		so that answers 2 questions in one go
2010-04-08T23:51:00.000Z	coz_	sine__	 now what you could do is google the make of the mouse with ubuntu to see if there are issues and any solutions :)
2010-04-08T23:52:00.000Z	sine__		ill do that
2010-04-08T23:54:00.000Z	coz_	sine__	 it  good to get into practice  googling especially with hardware issues once you have isolated it as actually being hardware....even though there are many people here with many different types of hardware... not always the right people when you need an answer :)
