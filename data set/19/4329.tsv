2009-05-02T03:07:00.000Z	KingJamesII		can someone here help me with ssh?
2009-05-02T03:08:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	you gotta ask a more specific question
2009-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	i'm trying to ssh into a computer I set up that I changed the port on. The port number was changed to port 512
2009-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	ok.. ssh <username@IP_address:512>
2009-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	 ok thanks
2009-05-02T03:16:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	that doesn't seem to be working
2009-05-02T03:18:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	is there a web server on that machine as well?
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	no web server. Just a workstation that I set up and wanted to do some setting up of apps from home
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	did you port forward the correct port to that machine in your router?
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	I verified that ssh is running on port 22 before I left
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	its not behind a router
2009-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	if it works on 22 why would you expect it to work on 5xx?
2009-05-02T03:20:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	port 22 is an ssh common port. I did it for security of the box
2009-05-02T03:21:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	yea 22 is standard.. and you tested it on that port before you left but you mentioned a different port before.. did you change the port again before leaving? if so did you test it?
2009-05-02T03:22:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	yes, i changed it to port 512
2009-05-02T03:23:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	if you didn't restart the ssh demon then it's still looking at port 22
2009-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	you might also try ... ssh IP_address:port# and see if that works
2009-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	KingJamesII	scunizi	no need. I'm in
2009-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	scunizi	KingJamesII	most everyone on linux has a port scanner
