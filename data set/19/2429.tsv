2010-05-04T10:16:00.000Z	crucialhoax		Should I add all my USB drives into fstab or is mtab? They are freezing my laptop upon insertion.
2010-05-04T10:17:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	did you install ubuntu from USB?
2010-05-04T10:17:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	No, a CD.
2010-05-04T10:17:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	hmm ok, had an issue previously with USB acting up because fstab thought they were CDs
2010-05-04T10:18:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	It did it even in 9.10
2010-05-04T10:18:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	might be a HAL (or lack of) related issue
2010-05-04T10:19:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	Is there a workaround or a fix? When I plug it in, the usb light dies then the laptop just freezes lol, its quite weird.
2010-05-04T10:20:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	can't even reach a terminal session with e.g. ctrl alt F2
2010-05-04T10:21:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	Nope, everything is dead. I even tried killing X with Ctrl+alt+Bkspc absolutely nothing works but the power button.
2010-05-04T10:22:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	have you activated ctrl+alt+bkspc? in case you're unaware of it it's off by default nowadays in ubuntu
2010-05-04T10:22:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	Yes, it is activated...
2010-05-04T10:24:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	ok hmm... unfortunately I haven't had my hands on lucid yet, I'm speaking from experience in Arch linux with usb not behaving nice
2010-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	Thats fine, anything will help, I am at a loss. I do not understand how inserting a usb drive causes the system entirely to die, usually at the worst times :(

2010-05-04T10:35:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	darn sorry, bad paste, hang on
2010-05-04T10:36:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HAL#USB_sticks_and_drives_do_not_automount_correctly this is what I experienced in Arch, might be useful to you
2010-05-04T10:37:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	Thanks :)
2010-05-04T10:37:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	crucialhoax	np!
2010-05-04T10:40:00.000Z	crucialhoax	PsynoKhi0	I might have found something...
