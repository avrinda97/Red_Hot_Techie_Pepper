2010-01-25T06:21:00.000Z	dj_segfault		I want to uninstall mysql-server and reinstall it.  Where are the files associated with the databases so I can back them up just in case?
2010-01-25T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	uninstalling something and reinstalling is unlikely to accomplish much.  /Why/ do you want to do so?
2010-01-25T06:23:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	After upgrading 9.04 to 9.10 mysql won't start.  Gstar tried to help me but we ran out of things to try and very little help from my logs.
2010-01-25T06:23:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	what happens when you try?
2010-01-25T06:24:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	It just says it failed.  Log files here http://pastebin.com/m707b199
2010-01-25T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	erm, how did you upgrade?
2010-01-25T07:18:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	From the updater
2010-01-25T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	were you using unofficial repositories or debs?
2010-01-25T07:19:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	Not that I know of, other than mutlimedia (dvd stuff)
2010-01-25T07:20:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	Trying to research which version of MySQL is needed for MythTV
2012-04-16T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	umm, why would it be stupid?  It's explicitly supported...
2012-04-16T06:46:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	M'Kay.  Reading the docs it says to go one revision upgrade at a time, and I guess I could do that, but it seems like an awful lot has changed between those releases.
2012-04-16T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	no, LTS -> LTS is explicitly supported
2012-04-16T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	(i.e. you do not need to go to 10.10, 11.04, and 11.10 in between)
2012-04-16T06:47:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	I was looking at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
2012-04-16T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	and?  That page should confirm (or at the very least not contradict) what I've told you
2012-04-16T06:49:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	Ah, I see the second part of that sentence where it says you can go from LTS to LTS.  Thank you for pointing that out.
2012-04-16T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	dj_segfault	yep, one of the big benefits of LTS
2012-05-11T06:24:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jrib	beat me to most of it.
