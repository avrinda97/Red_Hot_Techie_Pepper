2010-10-03T15:33:00.000Z	eugenekorpan		hello everyone, have small question. I have just installed ubuntu and cannot setup my network. It is saying cable is unplugged. Is it something with my drivers?
2010-10-03T15:33:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	eugenekorpan	unlikely, ethernet usually works 99.9999999999% out of the box
2010-10-03T15:35:00.000Z	eugenekorpan	aeon-ltd	Is this mean I have set up network unproperly?
2010-10-03T15:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	eugenekorpan	check all connections, does any other pc connected to the router work?
2010-10-03T15:36:00.000Z	eugenekorpan	aeon-ltd	forgot to mention that I have windows on the same machine and internet is ok

2010-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	eugenekorpan	aeon-ltd	sorry what do you mean?
2010-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	eugenekorpan	desktop/laptop/netbook/nettop(or any micro-atx pc)

2010-10-03T15:39:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	eugenekorpan	try (in terminal) 'sudo /etc/init.d/network restart'
2010-10-03T15:42:00.000Z	eugenekorpan	aeon-ltd	the problem is that I have to restart my computer and run ubuntu. So I will not be able to write the results instantly. So may I ask what should I expect for after this command?
2010-10-03T15:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	eugenekorpan	a connection may come back, that just restarts the network daemon and should poll/call for all available connections, if not maybe try restaring nm-applet, just in a process manager/or using top/htop
2010-10-03T15:46:00.000Z	eugenekorpan	aeon-ltd	I have vpn and have to enter login and the password. Will it automaticaly detect it and ask me for login requirements?
2010-10-03T15:49:00.000Z	eugenekorpan	aeon-ltd	anyway, thanks for trying to help
