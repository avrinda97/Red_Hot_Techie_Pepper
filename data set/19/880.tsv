2011-10-26T23:23:00.000Z	jellow		!gdm | jellow
2011-10-26T23:24:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	need any help?
2011-10-26T23:25:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	I want to gdm to load my window manager ratpoison and not xfce
2011-10-26T23:25:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2011-10-26T23:25:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	10.10 i think
2011-10-26T23:26:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	can you give me the output of: uname -a
2011-10-26T23:28:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	can you keep it in the channel please, that means you are running 11.10
2011-10-26T23:29:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	gdm isn't on 11.10, you want to be editing lightdm instead
2011-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	I removed lightdm as i though gdm would be simpler:P
2011-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	oh, so you installed gdm instead?
2011-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	yes
2011-10-26T23:31:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	I ran gdm configure gdm comes up with option but not ratposion only xfce though startx works
2011-10-26T23:31:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	ok, is there an option when you log in to choose your session?
2011-10-26T23:32:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	yes but ratpoison is not picked up
2011-10-26T23:32:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	it may need to be added manually then, i'm not sure how to do that myself
2011-10-26T23:33:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	there must be some config file you edit to add it to the sessions list, hopefully somebody here knows
2011-10-26T23:33:00.000Z	jellow	auronandace	Do you think it's possible to just add startx to the bottom of .bashrc , so I login and it auto starts X ?
2012-04-30T15:00:00.000Z	auronandace	jellow	if you like
