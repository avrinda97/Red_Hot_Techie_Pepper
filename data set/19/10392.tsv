2009-06-06T01:42:00.000Z	Neremor		could you please stop sending me links to the wiki frontpage?!
2009-06-06T01:42:00.000Z	Neremor		i allready installed the libdvdcss2 package
2009-06-06T01:43:00.000Z	Neremor		the dvd isn't recognized
2009-06-06T01:43:00.000Z	Neremor		no player
2009-06-06T01:43:00.000Z	Neremor		the dvd is simply not recognized by my OS
2009-06-06T01:44:00.000Z	Neremor		yes.
2009-06-06T01:45:00.000Z	Neremor		Kubuntu 9.04
2009-06-06T01:46:00.000Z	Neremor		first i tried it with "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh"... Then i tried "apt-get install libdvdcss2"
2009-06-06T01:47:00.000Z	Neremor		i think they are not the problem, because the dvd playes a few seconds every 20th time i insert the disc.
