2006-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	hawk		No one here who knows if the Maintainer field in Ubuntu packages should be correct (not thinking about universe here) or if it is for some reason kept intact from the original Debian packages?
2006-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	what do you mean by "correct"?
2006-06-09T08:48:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	If I contact the person that the maintainer field on an ubuntu package says about an ubuntu specific problem with the package, will I be flamed to death or not?
2006-06-09T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	possibly.  Which package?
2006-06-09T08:49:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	firefox
2006-06-09T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	what's the issue?
2006-06-09T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	you're better off filing a bug, rather than contacting the maintainer
2006-06-09T08:51:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/46144/+index  I already have, but I would like to ask the Ubuntu maintainer a few things about the ubuntu specific patches that are applied (for instance, if they are available in some other form than the _HUGE_ diff file with all patches concatenated)
2006-06-09T08:52:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	diff files are standard for patches
2006-06-09T08:52:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	I didn't mean "non diff format", I meant if they are available as separate files with even remotely descriptive file names...
2006-06-09T08:55:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	Did you understand what I was after? I mean, the maintainer ought to have the patches separated to be able to keep things even remotely maintainable, right?
2006-06-09T08:55:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	yes, I understand.
2006-06-09T08:59:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	I think I'll simply go for the guy who makes all the Ubuntu changelog entries...
2006-06-09T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	there you go, good approach
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	Yay, the firefox maintainer suggested I should diff the enormous Ubuntu diff (some 14589 lines) with the Debian diff to narrow it down to the ubuntu specific stuff. That's just great ;)
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	you already heard back?
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	did you email, or IRC?
2006-06-09T09:16:00.000Z	hawk	tritium	Email. I was really surprised when he answered that quickly.
2006-06-09T09:16:00.000Z	tritium	hawk	that was nice!
