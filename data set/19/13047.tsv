2005-06-10T12:56:00.000Z	NicP		why isnt there a wine type program for mac osx applications
2005-06-10T12:56:00.000Z	NicP		everything i would use is on osx
2005-06-10T12:57:00.000Z	NicP		isnt pearpc an emulation for entire operating systems
2005-06-10T12:58:00.000Z	NicP		yeah i was gonna use it and try osx
2005-06-10T12:58:00.000Z	NicP		lol
2005-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	NicP		i was only going to try it, not use it all the time, i do realise all that
2005-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	NicP		but what i ment was wouldnt it be easier to try an emulate osx rather than windows to get apps like office etc
2005-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	NicP		now i think about it the cpu architecture probably is a significant stumbling point
