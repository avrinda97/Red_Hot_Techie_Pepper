2007-07-12T05:28:00.000Z	pr0nGuy		I was messing around witht he istanbul program and then I lost all my destktop icons.  Please help.
2007-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	does ls ~/Desktop show them
2007-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	i get no such file or directory.
2007-07-12T05:30:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	that's not good
2007-07-12T05:30:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	i was afraid of that
2007-07-12T05:30:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	do mkdir ~/Desktop and then add them back
2007-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	I get the following output:   mkdir: cannot create directory `/home/steven/Desktop': File exists
2007-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	you just said it didn't
2007-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	ls ~/Desktop
2007-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	ok before you said that command said it didn't exist
2007-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	do file ~/Desktop
2007-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	i'm not sure why i got that output.  I'm just following your directions.  Perhaps I erred.
2007-07-12T05:36:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	do the file command
2007-07-12T05:36:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	 /home/steven/Desktop: Ogg data, Theora video
2007-07-12T05:37:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	that is my iatanbul screencast
2007-07-12T05:37:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	ohhhh I see what happened. You saved the istanbul output as Desktop, that file overwrote your Desktop directory
2007-07-12T05:37:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	oh no!
2007-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	pr0nGuy	bruenig	can i do anything about it?
2007-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	bruenig	pr0nGuy	so you need to move that, "mv ~/Desktop ~/someothername" then do "mkdir ~/Desktop" then start readding everything
