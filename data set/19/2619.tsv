2010-02-15T10:13:00.000Z	Benbong	altNull	I've done it several times with te same result

2010-02-15T10:14:00.000Z	altNull		benbong - you need to boot up with a live-cd and go though your nvidia logs in the /var/log/ directory
2010-02-15T10:14:00.000Z	altNull		then we can help you better
2010-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	altNull		benbong - you can also change your xorg.conf to use vesa instead of nvidia or nv
2010-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	altNull		then you can boot into the gui from the hd
2010-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	Benbong	altNull	I've tried to remove nvidia drivers and reboot on low-res mode
2010-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	Benbong	altNull	but the same thing happens
2010-02-15T10:16:00.000Z	altNull	Benbong	- how did your remove your drivers and how did you try and boot into low res mode?
2010-02-15T10:16:00.000Z	Benbong	altNull	sudo apt-get remove nvidia*
2010-02-15T10:16:00.000Z	Benbong		and reboot
2010-02-15T10:16:00.000Z	Benbong	altNull	I've then been asked to use a lor-res mode
