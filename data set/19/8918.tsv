2007-02-11T16:02:00.000Z	unop	feryana	 do you have a INSTALL or README file in that directory?
2007-02-11T16:03:00.000Z	unop	feryana	 check it out, it probably has instructions on how to install
2007-02-11T16:04:00.000Z	unop	feryana	 ok, run this command - make

2007-02-11T16:10:00.000Z	unop	feryana	 ok, these utils you downloaded seem to be command line utilities -- try unraring the file from the command line -- unrar /path/to/file.rar
2007-02-11T16:12:00.000Z	unop	feryana	 are you sure that was a .rar file .. is it an empty file (check filesize) ..
