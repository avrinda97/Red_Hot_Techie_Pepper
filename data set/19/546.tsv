2012-01-01T21:32:00.000Z	Bunie	auronandace	yay! i tried to get over Unity but just couldnt so im switching to lubuntu ^^
2012-01-01T21:32:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	good choice, i prefer xfce myself, but i agree that unity is not for me
2012-03-13T19:02:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	you can't go 64bit if your processor doesn't support it anyway
2012-03-13T19:02:00.000Z	Bunie	auronandace	It does
2012-03-13T19:02:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	ah, good, i've used 64bit for years, its great
2012-03-13T19:05:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	from a user perspective you likely won't notice any difference
2012-03-13T19:06:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	maybe if you provide examples we can help
2012-03-13T19:10:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	no backups mean you don't consider your data important, hope you know what you are doing
2012-03-13T19:30:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	you can upgrade when it comes out
2012-03-13T19:31:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	apt-get upgrade installs updates for your current version, it will not upgrade you to the next version
2012-03-13T19:31:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	please stop saying lol
2012-03-13T19:32:00.000Z	Bunie	auronandace	Habbit, my apologies ^^
2012-03-13T19:35:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	use the ethernet cable
2012-03-13T19:45:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	don't need luck, have fun
2012-03-13T20:39:00.000Z	Bunie	auronandace	you still here?
2012-03-13T20:39:00.000Z	auronandace	Bunie	yes
