2012-01-23T11:00:00.000Z	cheapie		yanick: What awful things?
2012-01-23T11:01:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	because the system is broken and has some unresolved packages now
2012-01-23T11:00:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	well, for once it removed apparmor and winebind (or something like that)
2012-01-23T11:01:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	What is preventing you from reinstalling them?
2012-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	Can you try sudo apt-get -f install and tell us what happens?
2012-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	I don't think such a command exists.
2012-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	it says that there are nothing to do
2012-01-23T11:03:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	i'm not exactly sure what packages got removed since the console has output too many lines and the buffer erased the important lines containing the packages that were purged
2012-01-23T11:04:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	Please wait while I check something...
2012-01-23T11:04:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	Did you use aptitude?
2012-01-23T11:05:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	I think he means apt-get -f install
2012-01-23T11:06:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	It would help if you could be a little more specific about what happened after you removed the packages.
2012-01-23T11:07:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	nothing happened, but I'm afraid of rebooting right now :D
2012-01-23T11:09:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	Just make sure linux-image-generic and ubuntu-desktop are installed. If so, you should be fine.
2012-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	insmod, so if nothing "seem" to have broke, then I should be fine on next reboot?
2012-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	You said it removed gnome-panel, so make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed.
2012-01-23T11:13:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	alright, thanks
2012-01-23T11:16:00.000Z	cheapie	yanick_	It SHOULD work. (However, if it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces)
2012-01-23T11:17:00.000Z	yanick_	cheapie	insmod, I thought so
