2010-08-16T14:56:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		Okay, I have the stupidest question ever, and I bet the answer is totally obvious.
2010-08-16T14:56:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		Where on my system is the user-dirs.dirs file?
2010-08-16T14:57:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		I cant find it anywhere
2010-08-16T14:57:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		And yes I have tried google too
2010-08-16T14:57:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		to no luck, as usual
2010-08-16T14:58:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		Where on my system is the user-dirs.dirs file?
2010-08-16T14:58:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	~/.config/
2010-08-16T14:58:00.000Z	Irreducibilis	rww	Yes, but where is "that"
2010-08-16T14:59:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	/home/yourusername/.config/
2010-08-16T14:59:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	open file manager, go to your home folder, press ctrl-H to show hidden files, double click .config, voila.
2011-01-16T04:51:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	Nope. 1) Unity is just a shell on top of GNOME. GNOME is still there. 2) There's an option on the login screen to use gnome-panel instead.
2011-01-16T06:34:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	No idea, but #debian is offtopic for #ubuntu ;)
2011-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	Fedora should write its own copy of GRUB during installation, so I'd expect that not to be a problem...
2011-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	Irreducibilis	rww	Okay, thank you.
2011-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	I'd tell you to check that with #fedora, but it sounds like you did and that wasn't helpful :\
2011-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	Irreducibilis	rww	They basically just laughed, without actually laughing -- so to speak
2011-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	From the look of it, you got caught in crossfire between channel residents and someone asking for help with a version of Fedora from five years ago.
2011-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	Irreducibilis	rww	Seems like it. Some rude person insisted I was not asking about "current" Fedora version.
2011-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	rww	Irreducibilis	*nods*
