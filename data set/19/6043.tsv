2008-03-24T01:32:00.000Z	goose|laptop		if I were going to use Ubuntu for a server for games (Halo, Battlefield, ect) should I use regular ubuntu, xubuntu, other..?
2008-03-24T01:32:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	the server version
2008-03-24T01:33:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	I was hoping for something with a GUI interface. I just put the server edition on the computer I plan on using, and have no idea how to work off only command prompts
2008-03-24T01:34:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	if you want a desctop manager and don't lose to much resources you should go for xubuntu
2008-03-24T01:34:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	thanks
2008-03-24T01:34:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	but if you don't use is it's better to shutdown the desktopmanager
2008-03-24T01:34:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	but you don't have to reinstal
2008-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	you can install a gui on the server version
2008-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	how can I do that?
2008-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	give me a sec
2008-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	kindofabuzz showed me how
2008-03-24T01:36:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	unless it's something else than sudo apt-get
2008-03-24T01:37:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	the way kindofabuzz told it is ok
2008-03-24T01:37:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	much thanks
2008-03-24T01:47:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	, once I install ubuntu-desktop, will it automatically launch at startup? or how do I access it? just type ubuntu-desktop every time I want my GUI interface?
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	start x
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	goose|laptop	warddr	just type 'start x' and it will launch the GUI interface?
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	yes
2008-03-24T01:50:00.000Z	warddr	goose|laptop	and don't run that as sudo
