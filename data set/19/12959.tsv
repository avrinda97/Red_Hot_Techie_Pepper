2005-06-08T16:16:00.000Z	nern		anyone that can help me with this fstab thing
2005-06-08T16:17:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	sure.
2005-06-08T16:17:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	what's the problem?
2005-06-08T16:17:00.000Z	nern	dooglus	thanks, i want to be have my fat32 drive mount on boot with full reading and writing priveledges for all users.
2005-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	I got that much.  what's the problem?  did you add a line to /etc/fstab already?
2005-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	nern	dooglus	yeah the only part i need help with is the options, i have everything else right
2005-06-08T16:19:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	if you don't put "noauto" as an option, it should be automatically mounted.
2005-06-08T16:19:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	umount it, then run "mount -a" - does it get mounted?
2005-06-08T16:20:00.000Z	nern	dooglus	what I really need is to know what options will enable all users to read and write the drive
2005-06-08T16:21:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	I don't think you need any options for that.  I use these:  /dev/sda5 /mnt/fat   vfat noauto,user,umask=0,iocharset=iso8859-1,uid=1000,codepage=850 0 0     and it's fine for me
2005-06-08T16:22:00.000Z	nern	dooglus	k thx man ill try that
2005-06-08T16:22:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	I have 'noauto' mind.
2005-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	nern	dooglus	worked great thanks alot
2005-06-08T16:30:00.000Z	dooglus	nern	ok.  I don't know what bit did the trick, but glad it worked :)
