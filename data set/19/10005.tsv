2010-06-25T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	Right still here?
2010-06-25T03:15:00.000Z	Jamie	sebsebseb	Yeah, still can't get it working
2010-06-25T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	yes I thought that would be the case
2010-06-25T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	since the link SlidingHorn gave you is for older versions of Ubuntu before 9.10
2010-06-25T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	which version are you on 10.04?
2010-06-25T03:16:00.000Z	Jamie	sebsebseb	Yeah
2010-06-25T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	 old GDM is :) when it comes to themeing, new one sucks,  you can change background and thats about it, and so its better to use alternatives such as KDM or slim
2010-06-25T03:18:00.000Z	Jamie	sebsebseb	Ahh right. I'll look into those. Thanks.
2010-06-25T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	KDM  comes with a nice theme by default, and is good with more than one user, since it will show the account that was last logged in :)  KDE app though, so will want to put on quite a bit of KDE stuff, if you haven't put a KDE app on before
2010-06-25T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	shoudn't be an issue as long as your partition isn't a really stupid size.  Also with Linux distros you can have loads of apps installed without stuff getting slow, like what would happen with WIndows.
2010-06-25T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	Slim is very customizable you can get it from the repo, but you get the Debian theme by default, since Ubuntu is based on Debian. There are some pretty nice themes on the website for it, and it doesn't seem like it would take much for you to make your own theme even.
2010-06-25T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	also there is a way to have the old GDM, but not as simple as just installing and using, and I am not sure of the exact details.
2010-06-25T03:21:00.000Z	Jamie	sebsebseb	I read on the forums somewhere that messing with the new settings might make upgrading to future releases problematic.. I'll probably check out KDM at some point, though
2010-06-25T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	no probably not,  unless a load of system stuff is removed
2010-06-25T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	sudo apt-get install kdm    sudo apt-get install slim   tell it to use that, and done
2010-06-25T03:23:00.000Z	Jamie	sebsebseb	Hmm, well, maybe I'll try to get the old GDM then - though not tonight. Seems a shame they changed it when it used to work so well. And I'll do that bit now, then :P
2010-06-25T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	theres also  LXDM and XDM.  Linux is very much so about choice, from the distros, to the programs/packages you have installed in them.
2010-06-25T03:27:00.000Z	Jamie	sebsebseb	But too much choice can be confusing! :P Well, thanks for your help. I'm off to bed.
2010-06-25T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Jamie	ok np and bye
