2009-05-17T18:26:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	what sound system are you using under sound preferences
2009-05-17T18:27:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	hda intel (alsa mixer)
2009-05-17T18:28:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	try setting sound capture to OSS and select everything on the Default Mixer Tracks using your shift key
2009-05-17T18:29:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	I will try that...
2009-05-17T18:30:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	i had a problem with my mic working as well and i think this was the solution for me
2009-05-17T18:31:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	yeah I did... I had only two options under that volume and pcm-2
2009-05-17T18:32:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	i have a audigy sound card so our problems may not be the same
2009-05-17T18:33:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	what are you using the microphone for, what software
2009-05-17T18:33:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	possibly, thanks for ur time and efforts... I will upgrade to usb headset.. it might work..
2009-05-17T18:34:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	I want to use it for voice chat... but not working even with normal recording.
2009-05-17T18:35:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	i remember that also i had to unmute AND select the microphone under the recording tab in the volume control to get the microphone to work in audacity
2009-05-17T18:37:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	yeah... I did that too.. I think its common issue for everyone...
2009-05-17T18:39:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	i did have problems getting it to work, its just like everything else with Ubuntu, its not like Windows and takes some getting used to
2009-05-17T18:40:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	yeah correct, I love to playaround with ubuntu.. it keeps me awake all the time... lol :)
2009-05-17T18:40:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	yea it is a time hog lol
2009-05-17T18:41:00.000Z	phase_shift314	vasy	but it is fun and you learn a lot
2009-05-17T18:41:00.000Z	vasy	phase_shift314	yes and It helps to meet many people around the world.. like we did.. keep in touch phase.. I am taking leave now for the break.
