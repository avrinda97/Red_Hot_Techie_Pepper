2009-07-04T03:30:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04		why do 90% of the laptops have ATI cards :(
2009-07-04T03:30:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	cheaper and pushed more by ati?
2009-07-04T03:32:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	sorry you are having trouble, my x1200 works fine
2009-07-04T03:32:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	i got a x1450
2009-07-04T03:33:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	that should be a newer version then mine and should work using the fglrx drivers
2009-07-04T03:36:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	well here is the thing during the dist upgrade everything went fine. i rebooted, and everything was how to say, running but not optimal. i then checked restricted drivers and saw that the usually available ati driver was missing, i then went to my friend google, and typed ubuntu 9.04 ati driver, and saw an article "yey ati finally supports linux completly get the driver here". i downloaded it , ran the *.run fo
2009-07-04T03:36:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	maybe you need to use the fglrx drivers instead of the ati catalyst drivers
2009-07-04T03:37:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	ok
2009-07-04T03:38:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	I could use the ati drivers until I updated Debian, now I have to use the flgrx drivers
2009-07-04T03:38:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	 what i "found out" was that the x1450 is only supported by the 9.03 driver, and the new xorg wants 9.04 (right? )
2009-07-04T03:39:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	I think thats what happened to me as well, xorg making changes that "broke" things
2009-07-04T03:39:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	any hints / ideas as to how i can get rid of the restricted drivers ? and get flgrx vack ?
2009-07-04T03:40:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	can you boot into single user mode and run xfix?
2009-07-04T03:40:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	do you mean the ati drivers or the ubuntu restricted drivers?
2009-07-04T03:42:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	i installed the ati drivers and thats where it all went wrong
2009-07-04T03:42:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	ok, the restricted drivers should hopefully work where the ati drivers don't
2009-07-04T03:45:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	what about dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ?
2009-07-04T03:46:00.000Z	grrrrrr9_04	Halitech	i tried that, it backed up the existing xorg.conf and made a new one, but still artifacts .
2009-07-04T03:47:00.000Z	Halitech	grrrrrr9_04	the automagic config is great when it works but sucks in cases like this
