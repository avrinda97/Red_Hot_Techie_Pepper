2007-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	what was the problem again? you're trying to get Java working?
2007-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	as in, "working for applets in a web browser"?
2007-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	hwilde	LjL	I just need firefox java plugin that's all...
2007-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	uhm, not quite... you'll hardly go below about 300mb without removing stuff manually (i.e. without using APT), i think
2008-10-02T03:04:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	i can't find that information on that page, could you point to it exactly?

2008-10-02T03:05:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	what should i have searched?
2008-10-02T03:07:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	i don't think the volume is RAID.

2008-10-30T00:27:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	why don't you upgrade?
2008-10-30T00:29:00.000Z	hwilde	LjL	where can I find the expect package ?  that's all I need
2008-10-30T00:29:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/
2008-10-30T00:30:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	i do have to remind you that using an end-of-life release may result in security risks and the like.
2008-10-30T00:32:00.000Z	hwilde	LjL	what are you trying to specifically be not helpful?  expect is not on the livecd
2009-04-30T21:28:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	i believe that requires a kernel recompile :( especially now that the -rt kernel is no longer available
2009-04-30T21:28:00.000Z	hwilde	LjL	I concur but where is this elusive (CONFIG_HZ=1000)
2009-04-30T21:29:00.000Z	LjL	hwilde	not sure, i don't have a kernel tree on my disk currently, but iirc it's in a file just called "config"...?
