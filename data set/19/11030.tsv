2007-04-26T10:23:00.000Z	glick		with 2 gigs of ram, how much swap space do i need?
2007-04-26T10:24:00.000Z	orbin	glick	depends on what you do.  most systems are fine with 512
2007-04-26T10:24:00.000Z	glick	orbin	just desktop stuff mostly
2007-04-26T10:25:00.000Z	orbin	glick	the 2 gigs is most likely a waste.  i'd say 512 or 1GB.
2007-04-26T10:26:00.000Z	orbin	glick	i hardly even touch my 512.
2007-05-21T15:58:00.000Z	orbin	glick	source?
2007-05-21T15:59:00.000Z	glick	orbin	cd

2007-05-21T15:59:00.000Z	orbin	glick	sound juicer comes by default
2007-05-21T15:59:00.000Z	glick	orbin	grip can do ogg?
2007-05-21T15:59:00.000Z	orbin	glick	yep
2007-05-21T16:00:00.000Z	orbin	glick	cd qulaity, lossy will give you an ogg file
2007-05-21T16:01:00.000Z	orbin	glick	i meant choosing "cd quality, lossy" in sound juicer will give you an ogg file
