2010-07-11T19:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		some times they even work! :)
2010-07-11T19:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		accessing windows shares just seems to get more and more complex as times go on.
2010-07-11T19:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		To many new security settings i guess. :)
2010-07-11T20:00:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 -   yah - we should revert to   pynetnaibourhoud  -   back in the days when things was simple :P
2010-07-11T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 i had that 'fusesmb' working great for ages... then suddendly.. it dont work no moar. :(
2010-07-11T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 well suddendly as in 2 releases ago.. and never gotten fixed since. :)
2010-07-11T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 i found smb4k very handy in the good old days also.
2010-07-11T20:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 where did you even find nfs for windows?
2010-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 -  true, -  so you need  full buffer-cash before burn :P
2010-07-11T20:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 thats what copying the whole iso over to the remote box first would do. :)
2010-07-11T20:08:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 -  downscaling to  720p would do it for nearly all  current (last 3 yr hardware)
2010-07-11T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 it also depended on the codec. I  toyed with it and found xvid at the higher res worked.. but h264 (i think) was a bit too much
2010-07-11T20:11:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 -  if you want power -   and  Media ...... consider  iON
2010-07-11T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 saveing my $ for Xmas. :) supposed to be lots of new cool things out by Dec.
2010-09-02T17:07:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 not something that we should be happy about,   because  A we (the it industry) get to sell less new computers,      B we the  Software developers get to support xp and legacy hardware longer ...    and  (C) we the internet users get to recieve spam a bit longer since XP is less secure than vista and/or windows 7
2010-09-17T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	 what 'changes' ? you want the save file  to be mounted from over a network? Not sure thats possible. You proberly could set up a NFS /home however.
2010-11-04T17:01:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 and still the installer doesn't do it if auto sellected.
2010-11-04T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ichat	  its been mentioned in brainstorm/suggestions in the past.
2010-11-04T17:03:00.000Z	Ichat	Dr_Willis	 more times than i can remember yes.    in stead they spend time on unity witch on many systems dont even work because it to slow grafic cards :P  [sorry for the rant]
