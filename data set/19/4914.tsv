2008-11-05T23:30:00.000Z	Foodcoman		Anyone having good sucess with the  ATI Radeon Mobility HD 3650 in laptops?  Strange stuff here.
2008-11-05T23:30:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	hd 2400 fine here
2008-11-05T23:32:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	 Starts good once.  Reboot no X environment.  Reboot in windows/ video card is not detected by HAL.  Reboot Is detected by driver, then reboot back into 8.10 is fine.
2008-11-05T23:33:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	Once I boot 8.10, I cannot reboot directly back into it without booting windows first like it resets the mode/status of the Video card.
2008-11-05T23:33:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	its a wonder they have fglrw working with xorg 7.4
2008-11-05T23:34:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	 its to do with xorg 7.4
2008-11-05T23:34:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	I will wait for them.... Loving the distro.
2008-11-05T23:35:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	Thanks mate.
2008-11-05T23:37:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	This Lenovo Thinkpad W500 really new.  Im pleased with how well it does work so far out of the box.  Best experience I have had so far.
2008-11-05T23:38:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	 next is an acer gemstone, they look cool
2008-11-05T23:38:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	Just a couple audio things and the video problem, but mostly great.
2008-11-05T23:40:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	I hope Canonical can get profitable.  I Love Kubuntu/Ubuntu.
2008-11-05T23:40:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	 try xubuntu too, well cool blue
2008-11-05T23:42:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	Lighter desktop xubuntu right?  Have played little in past.
2008-11-05T23:42:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	  if you have a nice pc the lighter stuff does not matter
2008-11-05T23:43:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	 for me the DE in xubuntu is a bit small
2008-11-05T23:43:00.000Z	Foodcoman	Welshman	Dual core 2.8, 4 gig and 7200 rpm 160 gig laptop.  Does well.
2008-11-05T23:43:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	 nice change though
2008-11-05T23:44:00.000Z	Welshman	Foodcoman	 no problem with any DE your pc :)
