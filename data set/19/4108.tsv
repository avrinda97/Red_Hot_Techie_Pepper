2011-11-24T04:42:00.000Z	Joey_		huh
2011-11-24T04:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	download teamviewer from the website, then just start it by clicking on teamviewer.exe  also make sure wine is installed
2011-11-24T04:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	there is only a windows-version of teamviewer, so you need wine
2011-11-24T04:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	just click the teamviewer.exe after wine is installed
2011-11-24T04:44:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	no there is no teamviewer for linux
2011-11-24T04:44:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	its just an exe-file inside that at.gz
2011-11-24T04:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5
2011-11-24T04:49:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	you used sudo?
2011-11-24T04:49:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	is another process e.g. like software-center running?
2011-11-24T04:49:00.000Z	iceroot	Joey_	then wait until its finished
