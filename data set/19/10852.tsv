2006-05-04T15:24:00.000Z	sleepy_		does anyone know how to change the PATH?
2006-05-04T15:25:00.000Z	sleepy_		I don't know, I need to add gcc to my PATH so that I can compile source
2006-05-04T15:25:00.000Z	sleepy_		because I can't './configure' anything due to it not being able to fine it
2006-05-04T15:26:00.000Z	sleepy_		breezy is the latest version right?
2006-05-04T15:26:00.000Z	sleepy_		ok, thanks
2006-05-04T15:26:00.000Z	sleepy_		yes
2006-05-04T15:26:00.000Z	sleepy_		I installed it with apt-get, and it confirms it installation whenever I've tried again
2006-05-04T15:27:00.000Z	sleepy_		ok
2006-05-04T15:27:00.000Z	sleepy_		thank you very much
2006-05-04T15:29:00.000Z	sleepy_		it says "export: '/usr/bin/gcc' : is not a valid identifier"
2006-05-04T15:30:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	you added a line at the bottom of a file called .bashrc in your home dir?
2006-05-04T15:31:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	it wont show up with an ls
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	because it starts with a dot but you can see it if you do ls -a or if you try and edit it (vi ~/.bashrc)
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	also, don't put gcc in there, just the folder.  it will look in the folders on your path to find the file.
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	but i don't think that is your problem
2006-05-04T15:33:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	if you have gcc installed properly it would surely be on your path
2006-05-04T15:33:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	what happens if you do "which gcc" at the command line
2006-05-04T15:33:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	oh yes, build essentials that will be it
2006-05-04T15:34:00.000Z	bakert	sleepy_	try sudo apt-get install build-essentials
