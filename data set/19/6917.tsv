2007-11-17T04:23:00.000Z	ata4ix		how to change the resolution of console 80x25 to something like a 120x60 or something else, in process of loading of the system? after grub processing
2007-11-17T04:25:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	do you mean the resolution of you consoles?  you could specify vesa numbers in your grub configuration (e.g. vga=791 choose 1024x768, iirc)
2007-11-17T04:26:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	yes of console in text mode when system is starting the services...
2007-11-17T04:27:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	choose your number from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions
2007-11-17T04:27:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	arigoto!
2007-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	that i have no clue and you might try vga=ask
2007-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	your bios and video card need to support these modes... i thought that would not be a problem
2007-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	i dont undertand
2007-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	whta does it mena
2007-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	i try it
2007-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	but maximum is 80x60 :(
2007-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	iirc that totally depends on the font you load later on
2007-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	font is default
2007-11-17T05:30:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	do you have some ideas how to fix this? :(
2007-11-17T05:30:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	yes, ignore the few seconds unless you actively work on the console
2007-11-17T05:30:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	what?
2007-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	andi5	ata4ix	well, i have no clue why your bios/graphics card combo does not support these vesa modes...
2007-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	10x... i try to solve this
2007-11-17T05:37:00.000Z	ata4ix	andi5	i need to have framebuffer support in my linux core nj fctivate the resolutions? or kubuntu 7.10 already have this?
