2007-07-12T06:01:00.000Z	astro76	IndyGunFreak	photosmart printers have card readers, I think that's what he has
2007-07-12T06:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	astro76	oh, ok.
2007-08-13T07:25:00.000Z	astro76	IndyGunFreak	it's not, if anything it would be in cannonical's commercial repo but I don't think so
2007-08-13T07:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	astro76	ok.. i know its in a repo i've used.... maybe pLF
2007-10-02T06:03:00.000Z	astro76	IndyGunFreak	AFAIK they don't really have one... "Canonical Ltd is a company headquartered in Europe with 90+ employees working in over 18 countries.", and by headquarterd in Europe I think they mean Mark has a flat in London ;

2007-12-12T05:28:00.000Z	astro76	IndyGunFreak	indeed, the LTS to LTS upgrade path must be supported
2007-12-12T05:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	astro76	hmm, interesting, id idn't know that.
2007-12-12T05:28:00.000Z	astro76	IndyGunFreak	this will be the first so it should be interesting ;)
