2007-10-14T05:13:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	Seveas	already done (the first channels that has a problem with it ;) )
2007-10-14T05:14:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	Seveas	just btw. don't you think you should at least kick him for useless playing with this stupid bot and flooding the channel?
2007-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	Seveas	FallenHitokiri	loleeta has been banned and the bot is not stupid
2007-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	Seveas	the bot could at least send answers as query.
2007-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	Seveas	FallenHitokiri	and you could try not to go offtopic
2007-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	Seveas	don't you think it is a bit disturbing to have this many lines _and_ windows bashing?
2007-10-14T05:16:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	Seveas	right. i'm quiet.
