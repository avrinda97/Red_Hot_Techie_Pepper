2010-02-12T02:25:00.000Z	crazygir		hiya! so I just ran a set of updates and rebooted.. somewhere along the line, grub's configuration was goofed up such that it isn't able to find *any* of the kernels in /boot
2010-02-12T02:25:00.000Z	crazygir		where do I begin trying to fix this?
2010-02-12T02:26:00.000Z	crazygir		I'm wondering if the uuid is off.. but the ubuntu livecd doesn't have the vol_id program
2010-02-12T02:26:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	boot up a liveCD (this is not wubi?)
2010-02-12T02:26:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	I'm in the ubuntu live cd
2010-02-12T02:27:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	Do you use wubi?
2010-02-12T02:27:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	not sure what wubi is
2010-02-12T02:29:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	wubi installs ubuntu "inside" windows, that's noth the case here right?
2010-02-12T02:30:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	windows isn't at all involved
2010-02-12T02:31:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	ok, good :) Then it should be a simple matter of reinstalling grub, When you boot does the grub menu show up?
2010-02-12T02:32:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	reinstall grub?
2010-02-12T02:33:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	But it doesn't start when you chose a menu alternative?
2010-02-12T02:33:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	are you suggesting I just reinstall grub?
2010-02-12T02:34:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	So grub gives that error message "unable to open file" or something like that?
2010-02-12T02:34:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	yes
2010-02-12T02:34:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	It should.
2010-02-12T02:34:00.000Z	arand	crazygir	Also are you using grub2 (fresh install of karmic) or grub-legacy (basically any other case)
2010-02-12T02:35:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	there is no grub-update on the livecd
2010-02-12T02:36:00.000Z	crazygir	arand	I'm going to reboot to test fixing the UUID, I'm in IRC via screen on another server, so I won't go anywhere but will be back in a few
