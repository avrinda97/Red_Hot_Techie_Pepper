2009-05-02T16:33:00.000Z	trece8		good question! Don't know
2009-05-02T16:33:00.000Z	trece8		have you googled that?
2009-05-02T16:33:00.000Z	trece8		no, Night_Owl , mine is simpler
2009-05-02T16:33:00.000Z	trece8		install it in some unused part of a partition
2009-05-02T16:33:00.000Z	trece8		the whole point is making the new grub realise there is some other OS and put that in the grub
2009-05-02T16:34:00.000Z	trece8		you didn't have any spare space?
2009-05-02T16:34:00.000Z	trece8		you can repartition
2009-05-02T16:34:00.000Z	trece8		anyway, my idea is this: install it in unused space. Then, the GRUB will recognize the Ubuntu you had before and put it in GRUB
2009-05-02T16:35:00.000Z	trece8		afterwards, you remove the newly installed ubuntu
2009-05-02T16:35:00.000Z	trece8		is like using a needle to get another needle out
2009-05-02T16:35:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	That is a bit of a heavy handed approach for me, I would prefer to maybe re install grub, or even solve the problem that caused this :)
2009-05-02T16:36:00.000Z	trece8	Mechdave	but that could work, couldn't it? Maybe too "stupid" .. .but... i assume it works
2009-05-02T16:37:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	It will work as far as the grub on the new system would see the other system but once you removed it you possibly would be back where you started :(
2009-05-02T16:37:00.000Z	trece8	Mechdave	I don't think so
2009-05-02T16:39:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	I have never tried it myself, I have always just mounted the boot partition to make sure it is ok and then booted from live disk and chrooted to the other system and then re installed grub
2009-05-02T16:40:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	true, but check this, it is strange --> http://paste.ubuntu.com/162766/
2009-05-02T16:41:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	see the /dev/sda1 entry, see the number of blocks?
2009-05-02T16:41:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	Where did that come from?
2009-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	Mechdave	trece8	Night_Owl Who am I kidding... I have heard this before
