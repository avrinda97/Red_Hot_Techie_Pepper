2004-12-13T15:57:00.000Z	jakk		Anybody have any idea why I have a really small font size in some program option-menus, xmms and vlc for example..?
2004-12-13T15:57:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	likely GTK 1.x options...
2004-12-13T15:58:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	what can i do about it..?
2004-12-13T15:58:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	not use crap software...
2004-12-13T15:58:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	not the hugest fan of gtk 1.x in the world... was the reason I started using KDE in the first place.
2004-12-13T15:59:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	Rhythmbox for audio... Totem or mplayer for movies...
2004-12-13T16:05:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	sorry i'm a total newbie :) but what is the easiest way to change to KDE?
2004-12-13T16:06:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	can you do it with the synaptic..?
2004-12-13T16:10:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	ahh... you don't want KDE... you just want to use apps that aren't gtk1.x
2004-12-13T16:12:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	but kde could be nice too?
2004-12-13T16:12:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	I guess... I don't really like KDE anymore...
2004-12-13T16:13:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	GNOME is a lot nicer/less annoying...
2004-12-13T16:15:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	tell me what is the difference between removal and complete removal in the synaptic?
2004-12-13T16:16:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	removal uninstalls... complete removal gets rid of config files too....
2004-12-13T16:17:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	ignore kent... if you are familier with dpkg ... complete is --purge or -P
2004-12-13T16:28:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	have the font thing in audacity too is there an alternative recommend?
2004-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	jakk	|trey|	alternative you could recommend...
2004-12-14T06:13:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	not break stuff  :P
2004-12-14T06:13:00.000Z	|trey|	jakk	but then its no fun  :(
