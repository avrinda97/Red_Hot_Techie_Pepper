2009-05-10T17:21:00.000Z	vertagano	Cantcme	Have you tried re-installed ALSA and then restarting?
2009-05-10T17:22:00.000Z	vertagano	Cantcme	When you restart ALSA (   sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart  ) do you receive any error messages?
2009-05-10T17:25:00.000Z	vertagano	Cantcme	And in System -> Preferences -> Sounds, you've selected ALSA for everything?
2009-05-10T17:25:00.000Z	Cantcme	vertagano	yep
