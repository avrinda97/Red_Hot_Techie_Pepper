2010-09-02T06:18:00.000Z	hardhat01		this is my header files.
2010-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	hardhat01		http://pastebin.ca/1930889 <-- this is the compile errors.
2010-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	hardhat01		what is a good compiler for me to download
2010-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	gcc
2010-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	depends what language tho
2010-09-02T06:27:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	you are missing that file:p
2010-09-02T06:28:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	no idea :P
2010-09-02T06:38:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	what are you coding in? c++? if so what are you using to make it
2010-09-02T06:38:00.000Z	hardhat01	mickster04	I used gcc ...
2010-09-02T06:39:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	are you using an ide like codeblocks?
2010-09-02T06:41:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	i would recommend using an IDE, means you can step thru the program...alternatively add printouts as to where your program is
2010-09-02T06:43:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	i think  you could get into trouble
2010-09-02T06:43:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	its missleading, cos its not just about it working, its aobut maintanance
2010-09-02T06:44:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	some has to maintain that code
2010-09-02T06:44:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	as its proffesional then yes you could get into massive trouble
2010-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	hardhat01	mickster04	Including jail ... or not that much trouble ...
2010-09-02T06:46:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	not jail, sacking at worst, buts that just morally wrong too, to say you are doing one thing and then do another, its lying
2010-09-02T06:49:00.000Z	mickster04	hardhat01	do that, he will prolly be ok with it, but if anyone else needs to maintain that code, then the work place needs to be able to do clojure rather than java
