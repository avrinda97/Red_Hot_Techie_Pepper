2008-12-20T11:36:00.000Z	Shpook		is there a GRUB channel? I really need to try to get this fixed before tomorrow
2008-12-20T11:36:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	whats yours doing?
2008-12-20T11:38:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	Well, I installed Ubuntu EEE from a USB stick...but to boot the OS on the hard drive, I have to boot from the usb stick
2008-12-20T11:40:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	do you have grub on the MBR of the hard drive?
2008-12-20T11:41:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	I assume so, grub loads, but just says no file found when I load the default kernel.
2008-12-20T11:44:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	thanks, I'll go check now.
2008-12-20T11:46:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	There's no grub.conf in /boot/grub
2008-12-20T11:46:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	not hidden either
2008-12-20T11:48:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	/boot/grub/menu.lst instead, sorry,
2008-12-20T11:56:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	in console, $ df -h -T
2008-12-20T11:58:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	it gives you sda and sdb etc, which arent references in the menu.lst, in menu.lst, its numerated  hd0,0 hd 0,1 its weird I know, what is the reference to the / drive when you df 0-h T
2008-12-20T11:59:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	SDB1
2008-12-20T11:59:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	and grub points to hd1,0
2008-12-20T12:00:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	ok, that looks like in grub should try to be loading a kernal image at 1,1 then
2008-12-20T12:01:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	it's trying to load from 1,0
2008-12-20T12:02:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	Shpook	did you use an online guide to do you install?
2008-12-20T12:03:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	Yeah, but it didn't consist of much. Download the iso, use a program to load it onto the usb stick and make it bootable, then boot from usb stick and install.
2008-12-20T12:03:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	straight from the ubuntu eee wiki :D
2008-12-20T12:06:00.000Z	Shpook	MadCowBoy	ok, thanks for the help, I'll go give it a shot.
