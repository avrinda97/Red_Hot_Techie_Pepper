2008-10-14T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Highbreaker	set the driver to be "sis" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-10-14T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Highbreaker	then add the resolution lines to the screen section
2008-10-14T23:54:00.000Z	Highbreaker	ActionParsnip	how  can i add these lines??
2008-10-14T23:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Highbreaker	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2008-10-14T23:59:00.000Z	Highbreaker	ActionParsnip	i have a SiS Mirage 3+ graphic card ... but no idea what to change in the confg
2008-10-15T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Highbreaker	looks ok to me, you say you only have 800x600?
2008-10-15T00:01:00.000Z	Highbreaker	ActionParsnip	only 640x320 at the moment, it was 840 before but after 1 change at gksu displayconfig -gtk there's only 640 available

2008-10-15T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Highbreaker	id make a backup of your xorg.conf the use recovery to repair it
2008-10-15T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Highbreaker	then reconfigure, yours seems to have a lot of stuff for what is essentially config for mouse keyboard screen and vga
