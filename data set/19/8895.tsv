2007-11-26T14:47:00.000Z	Textboo1		I was wondering if anybody could explain why playing xvid videos uses 100% of my CPU usage in Linux, please?
2007-11-26T14:47:00.000Z	Tidus	Textboo1	what player are you using, and what version of ubuntu
2007-11-26T14:48:00.000Z	Textboo1	Tidus	Gutsy with VLC
2007-11-26T14:48:00.000Z	Tidus	Textboo1	ok, do you have the 3d desktop effects enabled ?
2007-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	Textboo1	Tidus	yes
2007-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	Tidus	Textboo1	what processor and video card you using?
2007-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	Textboo1		Intel Celeron Mobile (laptop) 1.6Ghz x86, Video is ATI Xpress Radeon 200M
2007-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	Tidus	Textboo1	that's why it's using 100% ... underpowered video card
2007-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	Tidus		try turning the 3d desktop effects off
2007-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	Textboo1		ok
2007-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	Textboo1		thanks
2007-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	Tidus		it gets choppy on my desktop... athlon-64 3500 with a geforce 6600LE
2007-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	Textboo1		wow
2007-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	Tidus		i play WoW on linux... disabling the 3d effects doubled my framerate
2007-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	Textboo1		ok, going to give it a try and report back
2007-11-26T14:53:00.000Z	Textboo1	Tidus	you're awesome, never even reached 50%
2007-11-26T14:53:00.000Z	Tidus	Textboo1	lol np.
2007-11-26T14:53:00.000Z	Textboo1		thanks again
2007-11-26T14:53:00.000Z	Tidus	Textboo1	remember, if it looks flashy, or even touches 3d, it's probably gonna kill CPU
