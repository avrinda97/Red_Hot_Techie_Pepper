2012-04-26T03:00:00.000Z	guest0012983		hi.  if i were logged in as root, for whatever reason, and i want to open a program like my browser not as root, how would I go about this?
2012-04-26T03:01:00.000Z	guest0012983		is there a command that is the upposite of sudo or gksu?
2012-04-26T03:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	su, sudo or gksu
2012-04-26T03:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	they *are* the opposite of themselves
2012-04-26T03:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	"sudo -u <username> firefox"
2012-04-26T03:25:00.000Z	guest0012983	DarwinSurvivor	hi, i just tried when logged in as root, sudo nautilus, gksudo nautilus, and gksu nautilus and all three times it still opened as root...  any ideas?  i am trying, when logged in as root, to be able to run programs not as root
2012-04-26T03:26:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	you need to run "gksudo -u some_username nautilus"
2012-04-26T03:27:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	good luck
2012-04-26T03:39:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	any luck?
2012-04-26T03:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	ah yes, nautilus is both the background AND a filemanager. use "gksudo -u s nautilus --no-desktop"
2012-04-26T03:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	did you try it with --no-desktop added?
2012-04-26T03:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	in a terminal type "gksu some_user nautilus --no-desktop" and pastebin the output if it doesn't work

2012-04-26T04:38:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	looks like root is protecting it's X session (good thing). I recommend not running a GUI as root anyways. *Why* are you logging in as root in the first place?
2012-04-26T04:40:00.000Z	guest0012983	DarwinSurvivor	when i use backtrack i need to be logged in as root
2012-04-26T04:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	when you use the backtrack software, or the distribution?
2012-04-26T04:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	backtrack is not an official ubuntu derivative, please contact the backtrack developers directly for assistance with their distrobution
2012-04-26T04:44:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	if backtrack requires you to be logged in as root (something ubuntu does NOT do), that is an issue you need to bring up with *them*
2012-04-26T04:46:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	guest0012983	I don't think backbox IS a Canonical endorsed distro at all
