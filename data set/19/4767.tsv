2008-12-08T20:30:00.000Z	zsquareplusc		hm. flash is not installable.. my problem is this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/304969
2008-12-08T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	that bug is still open if you read the bug report
2008-12-08T20:33:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	yup. and the last comment gives hope... but it means i cant use flash on that hardy for an unknown time :(  (gnash isn't compatible to the single site i really need flash)
2008-12-08T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	what do you want us to do about it ?
2008-12-08T20:35:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	so there is no good workaround? (installing it manually is no good workaround) :-)
2008-12-08T20:35:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	so the auto install doens't work, and you don't want to install manaully - what do you want ?
2008-12-08T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	that bug gives you 3 options 1.) wait for a fix 2.) manually install 3.) enabled hardy backports -
2008-12-08T20:38:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	well, it's just a bad thing, in feisty broke that package and now its hardy. you can not seriously convince less computer savvy people to convert to ubuntu if the flash plugin breaks all the time :(
2008-12-08T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	this is a problem with ALL linux
2008-12-08T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	so no, I 'm not trying to convince anyone to use linux
2008-12-08T20:39:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	it should work with hardy-backports? i have these in sources.list but i don't see a difference. hm
2008-12-08T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	if you read the bug report you'll see the details
2008-12-08T20:48:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	are we reading the same bug report? i see someone expressing a wish, but there is no solution. the backports version is also broken. but we cal also stop this discussion, i'll have to wait..
2008-12-08T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	don't know, I've closed the bug reprot
2008-12-08T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	why do you want 486
2008-12-08T23:42:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	i want what? i just never saw 486 in the output of uname recently
2008-12-08T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	because there is no 486 kernel
2008-12-08T23:43:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ikonia	right, so if he wants to know which arch he is running, 486 is not the answer..
2008-12-08T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	zsquareplusc	no it's 32bit
