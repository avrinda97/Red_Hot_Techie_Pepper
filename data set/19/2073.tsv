2010-10-04T22:01:00.000Z	nishttal2		how do I un-encrypt my home folder
2010-10-04T22:02:00.000Z	nishttal2		during Ubuntu installation.. i chose the encrypted home directory option
2010-10-04T22:02:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	you need your login password and the passphrase
2010-10-04T22:03:00.000Z	nishttal2	acicula	where?
2010-10-04T22:03:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	to decrypt your home, your password is your login pasword, and the passphrase you should have saved somewhere
2010-10-04T22:04:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	what did you change that you cant access your encrytped home directory anymore?
2010-10-04T22:04:00.000Z	nishttal2	acicula	i am logged in and can access my files..
2010-10-04T22:04:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	yeah i understand
2010-10-04T22:04:00.000Z	nishttal2		question is I want to disable encryption
2010-10-04T22:04:00.000Z	nishttal2		as some programs are not working
2010-10-04T22:05:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	ok so your encryption is working but you want to stop using the encryption?
2010-10-04T22:05:00.000Z	nishttal2	acicula	yes
2010-10-04T22:06:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	well you will have to copy all the files to a place outside your home directory, disable encryption and remove the encrypted files and then copy your files back
2010-10-04T22:06:00.000Z	nishttal2	acicula	so how do I disable
2010-10-04T22:07:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	nishttal2 im checkking into that
2010-10-04T22:10:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	it seems removing the .Private and .ecryptfs directory from your home directory may do the trick. WARNING. .Private contains your data, so back it up to another place before hand. also the ecryptfs system uses the /home/<youruser> mount point so you have to be logged out for it to be unmounted
2010-10-04T22:10:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	again .Private and .ecryptfs under your real home directory, not the one you see when you are logged in
2010-10-04T22:11:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	http://virtually-a-machine.blogspot.com/2010/08/howto-disable-ecryptfs.html this also explains how you can disable it and keep an encrypted directory
2010-10-04T22:11:00.000Z	acicula	nishttal2	mind you it seems odd that programs are affected by the encryption, unless they lock up due to heavy io like a database?
