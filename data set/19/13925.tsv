2004-12-12T16:26:00.000Z	dhanish		xchat is yucky
2004-12-12T16:27:00.000Z	dhanish		so i take it ubuntu doesnt place icons for items in /etc/fstab automatically?
2004-12-12T16:27:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	It will do all volume mounting automatically.  Just go to computer>>disks.
2004-12-12T16:28:00.000Z	dhanish	ficusplanet	unfortuantely they arent showing up there
2004-12-12T16:29:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	Are you sure they are mounted?  You can configure all of this by going to Computer>>Des. Prefs.>>Removable Storage.
2004-12-12T16:29:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	Should work with removable media of all kinds - usb sticks, digital cameras, hard drives, etc.
2004-12-12T16:30:00.000Z	dhanish	ficusplanet	they are mounted cause i can go /mnt/winxp for instance and see my ntfs parition...this is what my fstab entry is like... "/dev/hde3        /mnt/winxp        ntfs       defaults,auto,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0"
2004-12-12T16:33:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	np
2004-12-12T16:34:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	Not that I know of, but they have much nicer/clearer names in Hoary.
2004-12-12T16:35:00.000Z	dhanish	ficusplanet	i am using hoary
2004-12-12T16:35:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	Really?  Is something still showing up with an obscure name?
2004-12-12T16:36:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	Oh, heh, I like those names.
2004-12-12T16:37:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	Good point.  Maybe you could file a bug against HAL or G-V-M.
2004-12-12T16:38:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	I don't think it is.  I could be wrong though.
2004-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	dhanish	ficusplanet	so is it HAL and/or GVM that parse fstab and display items under computer....just wondering if there is some hidden config or something
2004-12-12T16:45:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	GVM is a daemon that listens for messages from HAL about things being added and removed.  Nautilus will then work with GVM to display the appropriate stuff.
2004-12-12T16:46:00.000Z	dhanish	ficusplanet	thanks for clearing that up
2004-12-13T17:18:00.000Z	ficusplanet	dhanish	reiser4 by far, but I would be careful with it since it was just recently released.  Is it even in the ubuntu kernel?
