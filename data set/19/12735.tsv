2005-07-14T10:35:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	you can do it that way
2005-07-14T10:35:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	takes a bit of work
2005-07-14T10:35:00.000Z	ZeXr0	nalioth	else if there is any floppy that I can install ubuntu from, because I don't have cddrive
2005-07-14T10:36:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	got your pencil?
2005-07-14T10:37:00.000Z	ZeXr0	nalioth	:.. got a floppy drive and a NetWork card that's all
2005-07-14T10:37:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	ok you ready to write (or log)
2005-07-14T10:38:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	go to debian.org and download the woody netinst floppy images
2005-07-14T10:39:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	make sure you get all the images (you'll be installing a very minimal debian)
2005-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	when you get this minimal debian (woody) installed, put this sources.list in place of the one that came with teh debian
2005-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	the link the dog sent you
2005-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	at that poing, you can "apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" and have ubuntu
2005-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	ZeXr0	nalioth	I can't do that now if I already have debian installed ?
2005-07-14T10:42:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	if its woody, certainly
2005-07-14T10:42:00.000Z	nalioth	ZeXr0	this method is not pretty at all from sarge/sid/etch
2005-07-14T10:43:00.000Z	ZeXr0	nalioth	okay :P thanks for the info, I will try this tomorow :P thank you :)
