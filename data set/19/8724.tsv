2008-07-09T07:58:00.000Z	nano_		Does fsck need to be run on an unmounted filesystem?
2008-07-09T07:58:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	 yes
2008-07-09T07:58:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	but it can be run on a mounted system as well, can it not?
2008-07-09T07:59:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	I did a very bad thing and fubared my system by running it on a mounted fs
2008-07-09T07:59:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	there is a switch to check it but not modify, you can do that while mounted
2008-07-09T07:59:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	what is fubared
2008-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	it means screwed up
2008-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	how did u screw it up, what happened exactly?
2008-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	I think I ended up reinstalling the OS
2008-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	thas harst
2008-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	nano_		*harsh
2008-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	nano_		Can fsck be run on an ntfs file system?
2008-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	nano_		or even fat?
2008-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	fsck made changes to a live file system while it was in use, so after it lookdc at things, things changed, and then it made changes, bad
2008-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	that sucks
2008-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	can fsck be run on fat/ntfs system?
2008-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	man fsck    that will help, there are fsck utilities for most file systems,   you have to man ntfs-3g to know what you can do with an NTFS system from linux, use NTFS native tools most of the time I think
2008-07-09T08:03:00.000Z	nykkto	nano_	fat should be Ok, to fsck I think
2008-07-09T08:03:00.000Z	nano_	nykkto	yeah i think fsck has a dos checking utility
