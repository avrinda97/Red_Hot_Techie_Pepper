2008-05-08T03:55:00.000Z	rodolfo		anyone here uses evolution to access hotmail inox?
2008-05-08T03:55:00.000Z	rodolfo		ops, inbox* :P
2008-05-08T03:56:00.000Z	DIL	rodolfo	you have to have full version paid to forward mail
2008-05-08T03:56:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	what?
2008-05-08T03:56:00.000Z	DIL	rodolfo	you have to have full version paid version of hotmail
2008-05-08T03:57:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	what do you mean by 'full version paid'?
2008-05-08T03:58:00.000Z	DIL	rodolfo	there is a free version and then there is a full version that one has to pay for.  with that version you can forward mail similar to using gmail or other
2008-05-08T03:58:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	do you know any evolution-dev's channel? if that exists..
2008-05-08T04:05:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	now that you've mentioned that, evolution's about says 'Copyright Â© 1999 - 2008 Novell, Inc. and Others'.
2008-05-08T04:06:00.000Z	DIL	rodolfo	i meant hotmail not Evolution
2008-05-08T04:07:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	I see.. :P
2008-05-08T04:08:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	and that happens only for hotmail?
2008-05-08T04:08:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	no way to get around it?
2008-05-08T04:08:00.000Z	DIL	rodolfo	if i understood your ? you wanted to fwd mail from hotmail to Evolution, is that correct
2008-05-08T04:10:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	nah I want to send an email from hotmail using evolution
2008-05-08T04:12:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	I've started telnet [127.0.0.1 110] and it used to work just fine. after trying to send an email, evolution doesn't get connected anymore
2008-05-08T04:13:00.000Z	DIL	rodolfo	i have 3 different gmail accounts that i pop to evolution and send from all there accounts using evolution.  gmail allows the forwarding of emails hotmail's free version does not. you would have to upgrade so that you could forward your hotmail account to evolution
2008-05-08T04:16:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	That's what I feared..anyway, I can't get my evolution to work anymore, I mean, it doesn't receive e-mails from hotmail anymore. the port 127.0.0.1 110 returns OK on the terminal and I have o clue why this is happening. any suggestion?
2008-05-08T04:16:00.000Z	rodolfo	DIL	its ok. thank you :)
