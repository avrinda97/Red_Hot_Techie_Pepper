2006-08-06T13:29:00.000Z	bilss_		need some info on how to change grub on boot at the moment its controled by OS on hda3 which is to be deleted. need to change back to hda0
2006-08-06T13:29:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	you want a permanent or a temporary solution?
2006-08-06T13:30:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	permanent
2006-08-06T13:31:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	you need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, find the row with the boot you wish to change and change both the "root" and the "kernel root=" options
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	ok i will take a look
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	but, best thing is to create a new entry and use that just in case you screw it up.
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	worst thing ever is to have an unbootable system.
2006-08-06T13:33:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	copy the entry you need and then change it. remove the original one after you see that it works
2006-08-06T13:53:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	please look at http://pastebin.ca/118209
2006-08-06T13:56:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	looks ok. assuming that hda1 has got the system installed on it. try it. if it works you can remove the hda3 entries.
2006-08-06T13:57:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	just double-check that the kernel names (vmlinuz-...) are correct on the hda1 partition.
2006-08-06T13:57:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	ok i am not in a live cd at the moment but when i do and i delete hda3  what to do next? yes hda1 is ok
2006-08-06T14:00:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	if you format hda3 no changes need to be made. if you wish to delete hda3 then you need to check that the order of the partitions have not changed (for example if you use SWAP on hda4 you need to change it in /etc/fstab. alternative just comment the swap file out temporary if you know that the partition order will change and reactivate it afterwards)
2006-08-06T14:01:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	since all the partitions are on the same HDD there should not be any big issues.
2006-08-06T14:03:00.000Z	Jowi	bilss_	to clarify; if your swap used to be hda4 and "fdisk -l" show it as hda3, you need to change the swap entry in /etc/fstab.
2006-08-06T14:06:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	what will happen is that the free space that is created by formatting the partiion hda1 wil then become swap partition the swap partition at the moment is very vey small  , see here http://pastebin.ca/118227
2006-08-06T14:07:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	hda3 will become part of hda5 as swap
2006-08-06T14:14:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	did you see the pastebin?
2006-08-06T14:24:00.000Z	bilss_	Jowi	here is new pasrebin to clear thing so hda3 will become part of hda5 swap  http://pastebin.ca/118227
