2010-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	nsar		not so well i solve the problem with the totem for encrypted (css) dvd's but i still can't understand why when i logon as another user i can't see my gsm modem in the network manager, should i ask help in the forum of ubuntu?
2010-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	nsar		i put ubuntu to avoid putting centos again
2010-08-31T13:13:00.000Z	nsar		so many problems
2010-08-31T13:14:00.000Z	nsar		i am experienced with redhat based linux distros but i am new in debian like
2010-08-31T13:15:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	try loggin on as an admin and under mobile broadband select avalible to all users at the bottom
2010-08-31T13:16:00.000Z	nsar	pfg	i did only to me appear the connection no one else
2010-08-31T13:16:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	err, misunderstood then, you do NOT want it avalible to other users who are not using your log on and are not admin or you DO ?
2010-08-31T13:17:00.000Z	nsar	pfg	i guess is maybe a miss configuration or bug of nm-applet
2010-08-31T13:19:00.000Z	nsar	pfg	i want all user to open the connection when they login for example my daughter, she don't see on nm applet XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX PANU and connect under even though is available for all users
2010-08-31T13:20:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	weird, try loggin inas admin and changing her user rights to admin as well, then login as her and see if it avalible, it should remain avalible after you remove her rights
2010-08-31T13:23:00.000Z	nsar	pfg	it is ubuntu 10.04 lts the version of the os
2010-08-31T13:26:00.000Z	nsar	pfg	i give administrative rights nm-applet doesn't appear on the top panel at all
2010-08-31T13:28:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	now thats weird, its on the list of start-up programs via system - prefrences - startup applications ?
2010-08-31T13:42:00.000Z	nsar	pfg	nm-applet run only in both user but only when one of them is connected, and there is no mobile broadband connections available to any one except me the first created user
2010-08-31T13:44:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	it is/should be running connected or not,  if the mobile broadband available to all users box is ticked it should work for all users, create a new user and try with them, see if it is the user or the system that is screwed up
2010-08-31T13:45:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	ah, you need to reset that
2010-08-31T13:48:00.000Z	pfg	nsar	if only, mv ~/.gnome2/keyrings default.keyring file somewhere else, then create a new key
