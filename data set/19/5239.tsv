2008-08-08T02:46:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	http://alicious.com/2008/videomovie-screen-capture-programs-for-ubuntu-linux/ could help...
2008-08-08T03:01:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	if you want to just clean out configuration this will not help
2008-08-08T03:01:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	i want to re...get flash
2008-08-08T03:02:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	Its not that... i wanted to do the thing where firefox just automatically gets it... cuz the tar.gz i got isnt working the same way as that
2008-08-08T03:02:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	to start with a clean config on firefox in terminal do mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla-backup then start firefox
2008-08-08T03:04:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	mv needs an operand
2008-08-08T03:07:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	yesterday before i re-installed linux, i clicked "get flashplayer" and it loaded it like an extension, got it, and said to restart..... today its taking me to an adobe page and asking me to get that tar.gz
2008-08-08T03:07:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	know whats going on? ^
2008-08-08T03:07:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	it is installed, maybe just not responding on some pages.. flash sucks
2008-08-08T03:08:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	i know... but do you know how to get that one i was talking about, the one where it loads like an extension would in firefox
2008-08-08T03:08:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	if you did it once, it is done, it is installed, thats it, you only do it once
2008-08-08T03:09:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	it was flash-nonfree i was referring to
2008-08-08T03:10:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	me too
2008-08-08T03:10:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	i just realized that
2008-08-08T03:10:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	in terminal do 'sudo aptitude search flashplugin-nonfree' if you see an i next to it it is installed
2008-08-08T03:11:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	 i just installed it now
2008-08-08T03:12:00.000Z	dexi	ejer	now this is getting on my nerves... every video... no matter the website, is playing intil 2 seconds, then stopping
2008-08-08T03:12:00.000Z	ejer	dexi	this is normal, flash is crappy
