2012-05-01T08:06:00.000Z	Areckx		I am trying to use my iphone as a webcam and mic for Skype on my Ubuntu 10.04 machine. Using the iPhone app for Skype is limited, and can only see my own video, and not the caller's, plus if I want to look at the camera, I am unable to look at the screen. I have iWebcamera installed on my iPhone.

2012-05-13T09:01:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	It isn't. Wireless, however, is inherently complicated. Try it in dos.
2012-05-13T09:01:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	It was a bit of a joke. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WiFiHowTo
2012-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	sudo iwconfig wlan0 key XXXXXXXXXX
2012-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	Areckx	L3top	 when I do thr it keeps sayibg invalid argument
2012-05-13T09:11:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	you can just put the 1004 dvd in and use the partitioner there for install.
2012-05-13T09:17:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	That is how it is done. Stop typing line after line. Your phone is not hitting enter, you are.
2012-05-13T09:35:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	I think you might need to reinstall your wireless driver. Can't you plug in an ethernet cable to try and get this taken care of?
2012-05-14T06:08:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	I would expect grub-install; update-grub would just do what you want with both OSes installed, but am not positive.

2012-08-17T22:13:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	Can you please explain the original problem to me again? I just dropped in
2012-08-17T22:13:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	also what version of ubuntu you are on
2012-08-17T22:14:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	sudo apt-get install libva-driver-i965
2012-08-17T22:18:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	no... you need the intel GPU accelleration package.
2012-08-17T22:20:00.000Z	L3top	Areckx	what does top reveal about what is chewing up your cpu/memory?
