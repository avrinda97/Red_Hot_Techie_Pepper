2006-01-03T07:28:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	did you run fsck on them?
2006-01-03T07:29:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	no, i didn't
2006-01-03T07:29:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	I would
2006-01-03T07:31:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	it doesn't work for "sudo fsck /dev/hda3" (my main linux partition), it says "fsck.ext3: Filesystem revision too high...
2006-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	that sounds weird
2006-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	from knoppix you say?
2006-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	the superblock looks to be corrupted
2006-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	no, from ubuntu live cd
2006-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	ok
2006-01-03T07:33:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	do you think i should better try from knoppix ?
2006-01-03T07:33:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	If fsck can't run on it, I don't know any other 'fix' than to reformat the partitions
2006-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	but i have very important datas on my partition...
2006-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	but if they're hosed, you can't save the data
2006-01-03T07:35:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	there's no rescue application ?
2006-01-03T07:35:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	anyway maybe someone else has a suggestion, though I doubt anything will work when fsck doesn't even run on the partitions
2006-01-03T07:43:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	what does fdisk -y do? and why ary you running fdisk on a partition instead of a disk?
2006-01-03T07:45:00.000Z	ordicasse	mwe	fdisk -y does nothing
2006-01-03T07:46:00.000Z	mwe	ordicasse	my eyes are tired. I misread what you typed, sorry
