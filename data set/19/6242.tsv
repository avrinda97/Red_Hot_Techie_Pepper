2008-02-23T08:34:00.000Z	sdsheeks	nickrud	you can't say that for sure..
2008-02-23T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	sdsheeks	yes I can. Firewalls in linux protect ports, they are not virus protection
2008-02-23T08:35:00.000Z	sdsheeks	nickrud	okay :)
2008-02-23T08:37:00.000Z	sdsheeks	nickrud	you can do the same in vista..it will just ask you if you are sure :)
2008-02-23T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	sdsheeks	I think we're talking about two different things, I'm talking about firewalls protecting vulnerable servers listening to the world
