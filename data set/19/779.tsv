2011-10-06T04:47:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi all!  How do I wake ubuntu up from sleep?
2011-10-06T04:48:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	try "fg <job number>"
2011-10-06T04:49:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	So I would have to ssh into the box?
2011-10-06T04:49:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	ah, sorry, just hit a button, or move your mouse :))
2011-10-06T04:50:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	None of that was working.
2011-10-06T04:51:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	is that a remote computer or a PC?
2011-10-06T04:54:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	It is a desktop PC.  I accidentally hit a button marked "sleep" on my keyboard, and the machine would no longer respond to the keyboard or mouse, and the screen went dead.  I was still able to ping the box from another machine, so it was still somewhat awake.
2011-10-06T04:56:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	Idk, sounds strange, maybe you should press shutdown button to turn off it.
2011-10-06T04:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	I wound up doing a forced poweroff.
2011-10-06T04:58:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	sorry, but that's all I can think of...
2011-10-06T05:00:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	Thanks for the help anyway.  The websites I've looked at suggest to not use sleep mode because of the wakeup difficulties.  I'll try to keep that in mind when I'm blearily fumbling with the keyboard at 3am.
2011-10-06T05:01:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	;)
2012-08-12T09:40:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	you can use route command, or use Network manager
2012-08-12T09:41:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	I thought the route command only affected the running configuration.  If I reboot, it's back to the original, no?
2012-08-12T09:42:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	yep, how about using Network Manager? It has GUI, and remembers what you set.
2012-08-12T09:43:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	System>admin>NetworkTools?
2012-08-12T09:44:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	right click on your network icon, and you will see it
2012-08-12T09:48:00.000Z	dsnyders	Stanley00	It's not prompting for admin rights.
2012-08-12T09:49:00.000Z	Stanley00	dsnyders	oh, my bad, the menu call "Edit connection..." ;)
