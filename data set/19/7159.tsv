2007-12-12T09:10:00.000Z	hdevalence		I need a script to automate the downloading of a group pool from flickr (~3000 pictures). I've been using a nice perl script, but it has a limit of 500 images, and I don't know perl.
2007-12-12T09:11:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	can you post it somewhere, even a pastebin?
2007-12-12T09:14:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	yeah, one min
2007-12-12T09:18:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	this is the original script: http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/47910/
2007-12-12T09:18:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	If i post a diff, can you check that my change is valid perl?
2007-12-12T09:19:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	ha ha ha. I don't exactly know Perl, I just wanted to look at the code and see if I can figure it out myself.
2007-12-12T09:22:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	in any case, this is my change: http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/47911/
2007-12-12T09:23:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	hey, that is actually pretty readable Perl code. I think your original problem, doing more than 500 pictures is easy to solve, since there are some variables you can change.
2007-12-12T09:23:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	I added a -page argument and then set it in the flickr api
2007-12-12T09:24:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	the 500 limit is in the flickr api
2007-12-12T09:24:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	so I think what you might want to do is have it loop through
2007-12-12T09:26:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	well in line 238 it says something about 500 photos
2007-12-12T09:27:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.pools.getPhotos.html
2007-12-12T09:31:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	I didn't declare it. It seems to work.
2007-12-12T09:32:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	hooray. In case you already have an account you can visit the Programming Talk subforum in ubuntuforums.org We certainly have a Perl expert.
2007-12-12T09:35:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	I think what I'll do is change it so that instead of ending after 500, it will loop (so putting in -max 1600 will loop 4 times)
2007-12-12T09:36:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	brilliant
2007-12-12T09:40:00.000Z	hdevalence	vocx	does perl have a do {} while() statement?
2007-12-12T09:42:00.000Z	vocx	hdevalence	most probably yes, but again I'm not good at Perl. There is more than one way to do things in Perl.
