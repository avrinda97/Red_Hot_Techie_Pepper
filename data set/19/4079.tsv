2009-03-28T21:31:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	if an app is blocking sound for other or making them crash, padsp appname should fix it right?
2009-03-28T21:33:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	thing is when I try to run teamspeak it blocks the sound for all other applications, and even makes mplayer crash =\
2009-03-28T21:35:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	yeah, then i tried using the windows version in wine, and the sound wasnt blocking anymore, but I was unable to speak to my friends <.<
2009-03-28T21:36:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	i even tried padsp wine teamspeak.exe
2009-03-28T21:36:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	but still was unable to speak

2009-03-28T22:06:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	I wouldn't have any of these problems on 32b?
2009-03-28T22:08:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	can i switch to 32b version from terminal and start all over or do I need to DL the cd and reboot from it?
2009-03-28T22:10:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	I wouldn't mind doing all over from scratch if I knew i wouldnt have these problems.
2009-03-28T22:13:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	jklock	ok i'll do it, then when I'm at the 32b ill read on that. one left question before leaving, can i switch to 32b inside the 64b version or do I need to do it from the live CD?
