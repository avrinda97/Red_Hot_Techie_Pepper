2005-10-07T09:02:00.000Z	none_-		kick?
2005-10-07T09:02:00.000Z	none_-		you mean send the file to someone else?
2005-10-07T09:04:00.000Z	none_-		gentoo is much more difficult
2005-10-07T09:04:00.000Z	none_-		it is one of the best. if not the best
2005-10-07T09:05:00.000Z	none_-		you mean the installation?
2005-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	none_-		use distcc to compile in gentoo
2005-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	none_-		redhat sucks
2005-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	none_-		has for a long time
2005-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	kurtbec	none_-	that is one opinion.
2005-10-07T09:07:00.000Z	none_-	kurtbec	i think you should be surprised how well it works
2005-10-07T09:09:00.000Z	kurtbec	none_-	i hope so.  I really do.  I've done rpm based distros since redhat 5.x and they are ok but I'm still looking for something that i really like.  Gentoo was very close, but the compiling finally got to me after over a yar.
2005-10-07T09:10:00.000Z	none_-	kurtbec	i recommend Linux From Scratch
2005-10-07T09:10:00.000Z	kurtbec	none_-	definitely not LFS.  itsgreat but a management nightmare.
2005-10-07T09:11:00.000Z	none_-	kurtbec	agreed
2005-10-07T09:13:00.000Z	none_-	kurtbec	it's virtually stable at this point.. things should run smoothly
2005-10-07T09:13:00.000Z	kurtbec	none_-	I've hear mixed on breezy.  I've heard mostly good but a few that say that are quite a few bugs yet.  So  iguess it depeds on what you do.
2005-10-07T09:15:00.000Z	kurtbec	none_-	thats good
