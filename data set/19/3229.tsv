2010-11-13T10:31:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	how did you try to install ath9k?
2010-11-13T10:32:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	please one line
2010-11-13T10:32:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	Im using ath9k, have been for awhile.  It in theory should be well supported at this point
2010-11-13T10:33:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	do you have a bug report open?
2010-11-13T10:34:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	for ath9k, I think you should open a bug report if linux-backports-modules-lucid-generic didn't work
2010-11-13T10:35:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	well, you should just install it and it will work.  What is it that you were compiling?  Madwifi?
2010-11-13T10:37:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	did you "make install" stuff?  because that puts stuff on your system that is hard to track
2010-11-13T10:39:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	well, I would get a bug report going, ubuntu-bug linux
2010-11-13T10:41:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KarmicNull	did you make the report?  post the link
