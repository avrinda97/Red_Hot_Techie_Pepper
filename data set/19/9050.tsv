2007-04-30T15:27:00.000Z	xtknight		how do i get ID3 tag info to show in nautilus?
2007-04-30T15:29:00.000Z	javaJake	xtknight	you should be able to right click a file, click Properties, then click the Audio tab
2007-04-30T15:30:00.000Z	xtknight	javaJake	indeed that facility is available to me.  any idea how to get it to show in the column-headers in the Details view like with Windows XP?  i had thought Ubuntu had that also but I wasn't sure of the prerequisites
2007-04-30T15:30:00.000Z	javaJake	xtknight	Oh, no, I don't know of such ability
2007-04-30T15:46:00.000Z	javaJake	xtknight	mhmm...
2007-04-30T15:48:00.000Z	javaJake	xtknight	I know, I'm poking fun.
