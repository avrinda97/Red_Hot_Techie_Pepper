2007-06-22T08:13:00.000Z	LCCUB		is it possible to log something for use in terminal
2007-06-22T08:13:00.000Z	LCCUB		(a command that I will use often)
2007-06-22T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	do you mean an alias or something else?
2007-06-22T08:14:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	um kinda a long command
2007-06-22T08:14:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	 (something for stunnel)
2007-06-22T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	alias something_short='something really long in here'     <-- does this do what you want?
2007-06-22T08:15:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	sorry I didn't follow you the first time, so I can create an "alias" that will do a sort of text replacement?
2007-06-22T08:15:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	right, try this one (it's not permanent):  alias e='echo hi'     and then type: e
2007-06-22T08:16:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	that's perfect :)
2007-06-22T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	add it to your ~/.bashrc if you want it to stick (there should be some comments in there about aliases but it can go anywhere really)
2007-06-22T08:17:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	sorry, care to elaborate?
2007-06-22T08:18:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	well when you do that alias command, it will only work until you close the terminal.  Then it is lost.  If you want it to work for every terminal instance, then you can add it to your ~/.bashrc file, it's just a text file you edit
2007-06-22T08:19:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	can I just add a noncommented alias to that file towards the end?
2007-06-22T08:19:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	yep
2007-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	 does it have to be within if/fi
2007-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	no
2007-06-22T08:23:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	one more thing sorry, I assume this will take effect upon reboot?
2007-06-22T08:23:00.000Z	jrib	LCCUB	it will take effect next time you open a terminal
2007-06-22T10:17:00.000Z	LCCUB	jrib	if you're there thanks again for the alias thing, been using it a ton :)
