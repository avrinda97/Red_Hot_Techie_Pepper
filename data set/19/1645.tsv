2010-11-16T17:43:00.000Z	rezeusor		I have an ubuntu box that someone added a ping to init.d
2010-11-16T17:43:00.000Z	rezeusor		so when you start the device it just keeps pinging
2010-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	rezeusor		how can I stop that and remove the rc
2010-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	rezeusor		?
2010-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	rezeusor	undo what the person did?
2010-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	rezeusor		yeah, but I can't login, as it just keeps scrolling the ping
2010-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	rezeusor	use a live cd
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	rezeusor		ah
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	rezeusor		ok
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	rezeusor	maybe recovery mode works too, I don't know
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	rezeusor		what is the command to remove the script from init.d
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	rezeusor		?
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	rezeusor	are you sure he didn't just put it in /etc/rc.local?
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	rezeusor	jrib	no idea, i can't login to see, so i'm assuming a bit
2010-11-16T17:45:00.000Z	rezeusor		:)
2010-11-16T17:46:00.000Z	rezeusor	jrib	booting into slax now
2010-11-16T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	rezeusor	well if it's in /etc/rc.local, just delete the line there.  If it's an init script in /etc/init.d/, delete it and delete the links in /etc/rc*.d
2010-11-16T17:46:00.000Z	rezeusor	jrib	k, thank you
2010-11-16T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	rezeusor	you can also read « man update-rc.d » to make it a little easier
