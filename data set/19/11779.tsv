2006-10-05T07:35:00.000Z	jmerlin		and see what they see on windows XP
2006-10-05T07:35:00.000Z	jmerlin		which is what acroread is
2006-10-05T07:35:00.000Z	jmerlin		because the machines we're installing it on
2006-10-05T07:35:00.000Z	jmerlin		are the very old machines in storage
2006-10-05T07:35:00.000Z	jmerlin		we have hundreds of them
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	jmerlin		they can't run win XP
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	jmerlin		not enough ram, too slow
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	jmerlin		and XP would cost a fortune to install on all them
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	jmerlin		linux is free, it's very low bloat
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	jmerlin		they can run it very easily =>
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	there are alternatives to acroread that are better, IMO
2006-10-05T07:36:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	try kghostview, if you are in KDE
2006-10-05T07:37:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	then ghostview should do it
2006-10-05T07:37:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	there is also xpdf
2006-10-05T07:37:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	try several, see which one runs best for you
2006-10-05T07:37:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	yes, another pdf viewer program
2006-10-05T07:38:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	once you configure printing, all the X apps will print
2006-10-05T07:38:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	w.r.t. printing, it doesn't matter which pdf viewer app you use.
2006-10-05T07:38:00.000Z	sethk	jmerlin	the package for xpdf, if you want to check it out, is :   xpdf-reader
