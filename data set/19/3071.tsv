2009-11-01T04:54:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	don't suppose you know of a way to force it to see wlan0? heh; the problem i'm having right now is that it doesn't see my wifi at all
2009-11-01T04:56:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	I right clicked on the connection icon, clicked on Properties, and selected wlan0.  I connected once I did that.
2009-11-01T04:56:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	yeah, that's what i'm saying, it doesn't see the device itself, under that, network tools, etc.; it doesn't detect it at all
2009-11-01T04:57:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	it doesn't detect the NIC, haven't even gotten to trying to get it to see the network yet, heh
2009-11-01T04:58:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	Have you gone to System > Preferences > Network Connections > Wireless and added you broadcast?
2009-11-01T04:59:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	ssid, yes, left bssid and mac address blank, i'm not running any security, just have broadcast disabled and use mac filtering on the router
2009-11-01T06:00:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	if i go to system -> administration -> network tools, it doesn't even list the device though, just eth0 and loopback
2009-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	and i thought getting an ATI video card to work was frustrating, heh
2009-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	That is one of the things I dislike about 9.10.  In 9.04, you had everything there. Now, you have to looking all over the place for it.  I am considering looking into using WICD.
2009-11-01T06:02:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	i normally use Gentoo, but for whatever reason, it can't find the cd-rom after it gets to X point in the boot sequence
2009-11-01T06:02:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	i was gonna try ubuntu because i heard it was good about seeing wireless NICs on laptops >_<
2009-11-01T06:03:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	9.04 worked really well.
2009-11-01T06:06:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	Mefached, what's WICD?
2009-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	WICD is network program.
2009-11-01T06:08:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	wicd[dot]sourceforge[dot]net
2009-11-01T06:11:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	Mefached, IndyGunFreak: i'm feeling like a tool right now, i just stumbled across a toshiba-run site dedicated to linux support on their laptops lol
2009-11-01T06:11:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	lol
2009-11-01T06:13:00.000Z	SporkWitch	aquachica	Mefached: well, it remains to be seen whether it's of any use, but it's at least something, heh; unfortunately, this laptop isn't on the (10 model) list of "certified products" :(
2009-11-01T06:16:00.000Z	aquachica	SporkWitch	Sorry to hear that.  :(
