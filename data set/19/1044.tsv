2011-05-31T00:44:00.000Z	RA_drc_		i'm trying to get an ov5642 camera to work with ubuntu.  when i searched for a driver, i found this website: http://boundarydevices.com/blogs/camera-driver-example-code  i went and downloaded the kernel that was mentioned in the previous blog post, but i could not successfully make it.  is this the right approach?
2011-05-31T00:45:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	is it usb?
2011-05-31T00:46:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	yeah, i plug it in through my usb port
2011-05-31T00:48:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	does it load ok in logs?
2011-05-31T00:48:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	i'm pretty new, which logs should i check?
2011-05-31T00:49:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	try syslog and kernel
2011-05-31T00:50:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	maybe it already works, do you have vlc installed?
2011-05-31T00:51:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	i don't have vlc installed, but i tried going to chat roulette and the ov5642 camera didn't show up as an option.
2011-05-31T00:52:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	yea thats cause linux will not allow you to have even less of a life by going there. but in the meantime install vlc, then click on Media-OPen Capture device and under capture mode see if your camera is there
2011-05-31T00:57:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	when i'm looking for those log files you mentioned, would they be in /var/log ?
2011-05-31T00:58:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	yes those but if you go to System->Adminis->log file viewer its easier (top bar)
2011-05-31T00:59:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	in the log files unplug and replug the camera and watch the bottom lines of the file
2011-05-31T01:01:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	it's showing up....but it's talking about a "bidirectional printer"
2011-05-31T01:02:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	*the log file refers to a bidirectional printer
2011-05-31T01:03:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	hrmmm ok one sec
2011-05-31T01:03:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	whats the camera model again?
2011-05-31T01:04:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	ov5642.  the best information i found was on this site, look at this blog post and the previous one: http://boundarydevices.com/blogs/camera-driver-example-code
2011-05-31T01:07:00.000Z	Kalisto	RA_drc_	yea it looks as if the driver is not yet in the kernel (must be very new camera) either attempt what it says on the page (got to know its very technical) or wait a couple of months
2011-05-31T01:10:00.000Z	RA_drc_	Kalisto	do you know someone who would be experienced with that?  and i looked in vlc, all i see in there is video for linux 2, pvr, dvb, and desktop.
