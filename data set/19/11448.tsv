2006-04-13T07:49:00.000Z	eugman		Hey where do I lodge a minor complaint with serpentine cd burner?
2006-04-13T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	you make a great straight man, but this is a family channel  :)
2006-05-05T10:16:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	edit current profile
2006-05-05T10:25:00.000Z	eugman	sethk	what do you mean? I want to know how I can get the teminal font for windows. It's not in msttfcore fonts
2006-05-05T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	oh, I thought you wanted to change the fonts in the terminal window
2006-05-05T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	with one of the font servers you can use the windows fonts directly
2006-05-05T10:27:00.000Z	eugman	sethk	Use directly? Don't you mean get?
2006-05-05T10:27:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	no, I mean you can put the windows font files onto your box and the font server will render them properly in X
2006-05-05T10:28:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	for truetype fonts, specifically
2006-05-05T10:29:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	do you mean, how do you know what font windows is using?
2006-05-05T10:31:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	you should be able to set the font for an app, then read the font spec out of the registry
2006-08-08T05:31:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	you have to extract all the files from the .iso into a tree, make the changes you want in that tree, then use mkisofs to create a new iso.
2006-08-08T05:31:00.000Z	eugman	sethk	tree?
2006-08-08T05:32:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	tree.  that means all files and directories from some location.
2006-08-08T05:35:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	it's trivial
2006-08-08T05:36:00.000Z	eugman	sethk	it looks like all the info I need is from the synopsis. Is that correct?
2006-08-08T05:36:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	yes.  is use -o filename -J -R
2006-08-08T05:36:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	s/i/is/
2006-08-08T05:36:00.000Z	sethk	eugman	is/i/i/   ;
