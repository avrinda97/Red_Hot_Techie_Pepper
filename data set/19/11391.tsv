2006-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	Scarborough		how do I install a program thats in rpm format?
2006-02-21T10:56:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	try installing the aline package, thats what i use anyway, it converts alien package formats to .deb packages for installation =)
2006-02-21T10:56:00.000Z	Scarborough	prodigy60	whats the command for that?
2006-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	heh, forgot to mention your name in the line, read my last comment, sorry ;D
2006-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	Scarborough	prodigy60	didnt work
2006-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	did it generate the .deb files for you at least?
2006-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	Scarborough	prodigy60	no, it says it cant find the file
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	Scarborough	prodigy60	I have saved it on the desktop
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	are you running the alien command from the same directory? might be easier that way, if not put the full path to the file
2006-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	Scarborough	prodigy60	Ive tried but it didnt work
2006-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	after you nav to your desktop in a terminal type "alien -d <package.name>" and it *should* generate the .deb file you need, and from there its a straight install like normal, if thats not working i dont know what else to say :S i'm far from a nix guru, heh
2006-02-21T11:05:00.000Z	Scarborough	prodigy60	this sux, says it cant find the file
2006-02-21T11:06:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	odd, are you sure you're navigating to the same dir and everything? try "ls" and see if its listed, and either tab to complete the name or type it EXACTLY as its printed
2006-02-21T11:10:00.000Z	prodigy60	Scarborough	check this page out, it might help out a lil with the .rpm file    http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/23/installing-using-an-rpm-file/
