2009-03-15T03:49:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate		i had the same problem
2009-03-15T03:49:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate		i bout a dell from walmart and it got way faster
2009-03-15T03:51:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate		anyone know how to bridge a network for OPENVPN
2009-03-15T03:51:00.000Z	_Linuxx_	PeoplesAdvocate	what do you mean, so all traffic goes out through the tunnel?
2009-03-15T03:53:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate	_Linuxx_	Im trying to set up a bridged network so that when a client connects to my VPN it seems as it is in the same network
2009-03-15T03:54:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate		i used a help.ubuntu.com website to do that but when i followed the steps it messed up my connection and had to replace the edited file with the backup
2009-03-15T03:54:00.000Z	_Linuxx_	PeoplesAdvocate	you want them to VPN into your machine, so that you can route traffic to them?
2009-03-15T03:56:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate	_Linuxx_	Ok let me explain better. lol. I want a OpenVPN server so that I can play lan games as if we are in the same network. Client 1 is somewhere else, Client 2 is in the network on XP. OpenVPN is a server
2009-03-15T03:58:00.000Z	_Linuxx_	PeoplesAdvocate	I would replace your linksys/dlink/whatever router with pfsense. then you can issue your friends vpn accounts so that they can pptp into your network, and receive ips on your network
2009-03-15T03:58:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate		ahh sounds good, can I use DD-WRT on my linksys?
2009-03-15T03:59:00.000Z	_Linuxx_	PeoplesAdvocate	depends on what version of the wt54g you have. some dont have the memory for the full version with VPN, plus ddwrt is weak, pfsense is way better
2009-03-15T03:59:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate	_Linuxx_	that man, never thought about this route. I will look into it
2009-03-15T04:00:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate	_Linuxx_	i have v2
2009-03-15T04:00:00.000Z	_Linuxx_	PeoplesAdvocate	yeah, thats a good one. if you have an extra box around, just install pfsense. 10 times better than ddwrt
2009-03-15T04:01:00.000Z	PeoplesAdvocate	_Linuxx_	will i need two NIC cards?
2009-03-15T04:02:00.000Z	_Linuxx_	PeoplesAdvocate	yep
