2008-11-04T04:09:00.000Z	solexious	erUSUL	thanks mate
2008-11-04T04:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	no problem
2008-11-04T04:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	well if the usb stick is using fat you can avoid it fat does not support unix permissions bits
2008-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	if you are making a backup use tar to create a tar.gz with all your data and copy it to the usb stick
2008-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	no problem
2008-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	solexious	erUSUL	it that better than just a normal cp?
2008-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	if the target filesystem is not linux native is the only option (or cpio or othe backup solution)
2008-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	solexious	erUSUL	thanks
2008-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	becouse if you do not use tar (that preserves ownership and permissions internally) you loose that info...
2008-11-04T04:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	and when you restore problems may arise due to permissions
2008-11-04T04:19:00.000Z	solexious	erUSUL	how can i make a tar of my home folder?
2008-11-04T04:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	right click the folder on nautilus and choose create archiver...
2008-11-04T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	solexious	command line is « tar cvzf home_backup.tar.gz /home/$USER » (that creates the home_backup.tar.gz on the current dir)
2008-11-04T04:21:00.000Z	solexious	erUSUL	i get permission denied... is there a command line way?
2008-11-04T04:22:00.000Z	solexious	erUSUL	lol, read my mind :)
