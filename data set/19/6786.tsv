2012-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	Reggie		the latest one with the thunderbolt port
2012-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	Reggie		I read that Ubuntu did not have the wifi drivers available since the hardware was brand new
2012-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	aBound	Reggie	Depends on your machine.
2012-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	aBound	Reggie	I have a week old laptop that worked with Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 wifi flawlessly.
2012-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Reggie		well I dont remember the designation for this model macbook pro but I'm fairly certain that drivers were not available for this model
2012-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Reggie		shame too I have to say Ubuntu with Unity looks absolutely glorious on the 17th screen
2012-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Reggie		17inch *
2012-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Reggie	aBound	I think these macs have broadcom installed
2012-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	aBound	Reggie	I can't say if this command works on your Mac. But you can type: lspci | grep Network. To check what your network controller is using.
2012-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Reggie		so a Broadcom driver would be needed
2012-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Reggie		anyway I came to find out if anyone has a working Ubuntu box working as a NAS device with a web frontend
2012-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	Reggie		really DrPenguin
2012-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	Reggie		are the frontends pre-made
2012-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	aBound		I'm a Mac. :P
2012-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	Reggie		or would I have to design from Scratch
2012-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Reggie	aBound	which version of Mac are you using, meaning which model?
2012-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	aBound	Reggie	No Mac here I was messing around. I'm running a System76 machine bud.
2012-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Reggie		I know this may be off topic but does anyone in here think that OSX lion is an epic fail especially on the Macbook
2012-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	aBound	Reggie	If you're using a broadcom wireless network controller you will have to install the drivers.
