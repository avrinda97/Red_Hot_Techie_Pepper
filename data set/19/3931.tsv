2009-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	xiong		this is definitely an ubuntu bug -- i'm not seeing the entity &rarr; although perhaps it's numeric
2009-06-17T14:13:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	where doesn't it work?
2009-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	xiong	cwillu	it DOES work here: http://beyondeuclid.com/wiki/User_talk:Bear
2009-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	xiong	cwillu	it DOES NOT work here: http://beyondeuclid.com/w/index.php?title=Talk:Classical_Parabola&action=history
2009-06-17T14:15:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	probably the font doesn't include it
2009-06-17T14:15:00.000Z	xiong		on the second page, the first line of the history shows three funny characters on my screen -- what do you see?
2009-06-17T14:15:00.000Z	cwillu		→ <-that, right
2009-06-17T14:15:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	?
2009-06-17T14:15:00.000Z	xiong		i see that as a rarr on xchat, no prob
2009-06-17T14:16:00.000Z	xiong		and on the first page i linked, also no prob
2009-06-17T14:16:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	sec, let me play with firebug for a sec
2009-06-17T14:17:00.000Z	xiong	cwillu	probably related, this page shows funny chars in the middle of the image dimension lines: http://beyondeuclid.com/wiki/Image:Playground_Pythagoras.png
2009-06-17T14:18:00.000Z	xiong	cwillu	so, eg, 144 ?? 72 px -- except that the ?s are non standard reversed out of black diamonds -- placeholders, i guess
2009-06-17T14:19:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	well, strictly speaking it's exactly the standard of what you're supposed to do if a renderer is presented with an unknown entity
2009-06-17T14:19:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	I can splice → into that page and have it work though, give me another sec :p
2009-06-17T14:20:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	I'm suspicious that your webserver is changing something out on you
2009-06-17T14:20:00.000Z	xiong	cwillu	i understand that on some level this is a graceful failure -- but it's still a failure -- do i need to install another font or is the issue deeper?
2009-06-17T14:21:00.000Z	cwillu	xiong	what's the difference between those two pages?  is it just that one uses the char directly, and the other uses the xml entity?
2009-06-17T14:23:00.000Z	xiong	cwillu	i'm talking to a guy on #mediawiki about this -- would you please join #codebug
