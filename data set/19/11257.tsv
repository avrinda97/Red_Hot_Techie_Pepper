2006-03-01T10:50:00.000Z	urox	rredd4	i have currently both us and il keyboard layout, and it switches them in ease
2006-03-01T10:51:00.000Z	rredd4	urox	sounds great!
2006-03-01T10:53:00.000Z	rredd4	urox	u have to unplug us keyboard and plug in il? or are you using just a us keyboard?
2006-03-01T10:53:00.000Z	urox	rredd4	my keyboard has both il and us letters on it
2006-03-01T10:55:00.000Z	rredd4	urox	what is il?
2006-03-01T10:55:00.000Z	urox	rredd4	it's the hebrew language layout...
2006-03-01T10:57:00.000Z	rredd4	urox	ok thanks, just wanted to have a german ubuntu for my gf, with no english words.  possible?
2006-03-01T10:57:00.000Z	urox	rredd4	yeah, there are translation packs for all the languages
2006-03-01T10:57:00.000Z	urox	rredd4	when you install i belive you can tell it (if not, you can always do it from the admin menu), and install GERMAN layout + translation
