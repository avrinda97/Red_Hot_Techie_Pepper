2008-05-10T11:18:00.000Z	anolis		ok, well i got ubuntu to boot on my hammerhead tablet.. but now i can't get the stylus to work..
2008-05-10T11:19:00.000Z	anolis		anyone know anything about stylus's and tablet pc's?
2008-05-10T11:21:00.000Z	anolis		does anyone know anything about stylus's?
2008-05-10T11:22:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	canon printers?
2008-05-10T11:22:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	negative... i have a Hammerhead XRT. im trying to avoid using windows xp tablet edition.
2008-05-10T11:23:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	Oh, so you mean a tablet pc, not a "canon stylus" series printer
2008-05-10T11:23:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	correct
2008-05-10T11:23:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	So, well, I have some experience, though not with model in particular... most of the screens act as a synaptics device
2008-05-10T11:24:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	well i got it installed using a dell inspiron 1000 laptop. then popped the installed hdd into the hammerhead
2008-05-10T11:24:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	had a bit of trouble getting it to boot at first, but that was operator error
2008-05-10T11:26:00.000Z	anolis		perhaps there is a distro of linux more oriented at tablet computing?
2008-05-10T11:27:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	I don't know. You didn't really say what your current problem is in detail, either :)
2008-05-10T11:28:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	my problem is, i have no OSK and the stylus doesn't do anything.. the pointer is sitting stationary in the middle of the screen. i have to plug a keyboard in to use the thing
2008-05-10T11:30:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	well, I figure you could fix your xorg configuration for your stylus to work, manually (should be like for any synaptics device if your hardware is similar - sorry, can't google you a link, but at least this gives you search terms...)
2008-05-10T11:30:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	as far as an osk goes, how would you operate that without stylus?
2008-05-10T11:31:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	thats the other problem.. the hardware spec's are very sparse.. (by plugging in a keyboard via the 1 usb port it has)
2008-05-10T11:32:00.000Z	Radtoo^laptop	anolis	there's various tools to get very exact hardware specs, such as "lshw", "lspci", "lsusb", "hwinfo", the kde / gnome hardware viewers...
2008-05-10T11:33:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	mm i will try that.. maybe i can find something..
2008-05-10T11:34:00.000Z	anolis	Radtoo^laptop	dunno what i will do with what i find though >_<
