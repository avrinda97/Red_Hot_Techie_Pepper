2005-12-06T10:58:00.000Z	USCRyan		*question* im new to linux and trying to install gtk-gnutella, i used synapics to do it but it installed an outdated version, can anyone walk me through how to install the latest version? i just downloaded it off the sourceforge site
2005-12-06T11:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	you'll most likey need to install build-essential
2005-12-06T11:03:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	then you need to decompress the archive you got, tar xjf gtk-gnutella<whatever>.tar.bz2
2005-12-06T11:04:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	ok, it probably told you you don't have GTK installed, right?
2005-12-06T11:08:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	run configure again
2005-12-06T11:10:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	then it doesn't know you have gcc, just ctrl-c and start again
2005-12-06T11:11:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	I don't know what you mean, most configure scripts are automatic
2005-12-06T11:13:00.000Z	USCRyan	Agrajag	http://pastebin.com/445072
2005-12-06T11:14:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	so, sudo apt-get install yacc
2005-12-06T11:14:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	or bison, it may be the same thing
2005-12-06T11:20:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	no, the version you compile should install to /usr/local instead of /usr
2005-12-06T11:21:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	/usr/bin/make?
2005-12-06T11:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	do you have the GTK development packages and all that installed?
2005-12-06T11:27:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	configure didn't tell you it was missing?
2005-12-06T11:28:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
2005-12-06T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	for anything you need to build from source, you'll need -dev packages install for any libraries it uses
2005-12-06T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	you can search for t by using apt-cache search <libraryname> and find anything with -dev after it
2005-12-06T11:30:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	configure should tell you if libraries it needs are missing
2005-12-06T11:31:00.000Z	Agrajag	USCRyan	well, I gotta get back to work, hope someone else can pick up from here
