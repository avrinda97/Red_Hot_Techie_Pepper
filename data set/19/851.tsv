2011-11-03T05:18:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	hwo do i avoid unity all together in process of upgrading from 9.10 to latest?
2011-11-03T05:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	ruser	unity does not appear till natty, and you have a classic desktop available in natty, a classic that is a little different maverick is the last gnome 2 really.

2011-11-03T06:06:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	 9.10 :(
2011-11-03T06:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	ruser	not good you have to follow a end of life process follow this link as I have told Scott0 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
2011-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	ruser	really I would just back up the stuff needed like media etc and just fresh install, the upgrades can take a while.
2011-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	yeah i'm going udpate to the closest LTS and actually i jsut read the comments in the file it's only  changes the prompt option.  so not an issue
2011-11-03T06:09:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	the page that documetnation links to is broken :)
2011-11-03T06:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	ruser	read carefully that link I don't just espouse this to please my self it is basically what has to be done for a stable upgrade, besides going to grub 2. Look for this line in the link for what I'm saying as proof to reading the link correctly and understanding it. We will do the following upgrades, 8.10 to 9.04 to 9.10 to 10.04 LTS.
2011-11-03T06:12:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	that's whati'm doing right now.    9.10 to 10.04  that is
2012-01-04T00:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	ruser	what is the grub problem?
2012-01-04T00:52:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	i inherited an ubuntu dedicated box with raid1. perofriming oneirc update and not sure how to deal with raid and grub on it.
2012-01-04T00:53:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	  http://pastebin.com/p8cfpgBj   that's the  question.  if i dont' get it right i'll have to scrap the entire box and re-setup up
2012-01-04T00:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	ruser	I'm not raid knowledgeable.
2012-01-04T00:54:00.000Z	ruser	urlin2u	yeah, the same here
