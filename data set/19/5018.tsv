2012-11-05T08:30:00.000Z	Sonic132		Can someone help me? I have to somehow install Ubuntu onto a laptop HDD from a desktop, and then transplant it back in the laptop in some sort of working order.
2012-11-05T08:31:00.000Z	Sonic132		Because the BIOS is locked.
2012-11-05T08:32:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	sure ... do a usb-bootmedium, for safety disconnect desktop's hdd, need an adaptor for 2,5 hdd/lappi, then boot from usb-thumb and install to hdd
2012-11-05T08:33:00.000Z	Sonic132	DasEi	I can't change the boot order since the BIOS is locked. Wouldn't that require that?
2012-11-05T08:35:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	no, as it'll probably be the only bootable medium then, though I don't know what your bios is set to, mostly one can hard-reset bios by opening the case
2012-11-05T08:36:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	so can go above described way
2012-11-05T08:38:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	to lower the risk, just do a basic/minimal install with all generic drivers (alternate or netinstall, expert-mode)
2012-11-05T08:38:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	and brick .. chances are small it won't work, but you won't break anything
2012-11-05T08:39:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	sound like grub wasn't installed properly, how did you try ?
2012-11-05T08:41:00.000Z	Sonic132	DasEi	Oh wow. I think I just figured out why that didn't work. I installed to an sda partition and that HDD also has windows on it. Would grub refer to Windows and fail because of that?
2012-11-05T08:41:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	no
2012-11-05T08:46:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	os not found is mostly grub not found
2012-11-05T08:47:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	goole the manual for that exact model and find outm wheter to reset the bios manually/mechanically (removing battery..) is possible
2012-11-05T08:48:00.000Z	Sonic132	DasEi	All the pages I could dig up said no. But I'll try the manual as well.
2012-11-05T08:48:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	I gfu, model/brand ?
2012-11-05T08:50:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	so removing batt shall be possible then :)
2012-11-05T08:50:00.000Z	Sonic132	DasEi	It's worth a try. What's the worst that could happen *nervous chuckle*?
2012-11-05T08:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Sonic132	have a black tea, let it sit for longer than 6 minutes before drinking ;), then use the screwdriver
2012-11-05T08:52:00.000Z	Sonic132	DasEi	Thanks. You and escott both.
