2009-12-30T08:13:00.000Z	joako		How can I issue apt-get remove or apt-get purge command w/o getting a prompt to confirm?
2009-12-30T08:14:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	joako	yes && sudo apt-get remove "package" if i remember right
2009-12-30T08:15:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		yes spams "y"
2009-12-30T08:15:00.000Z	joako		Right and if I do sudo apt-get remove whatever it PROMPTS if I am sure. I do not want to be promtped
2009-12-30T08:16:00.000Z	joako		I understand I need to enter root password.. fine
2009-12-30T08:17:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		joako
2009-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	joako		MilitantPotato
2009-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		the main reason not to do that, is in case an update breaks something, you'll of been prompted what was installed, so you can remove it.   (sorry, hit enter)
2009-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	joako		I understand but is there a way to bypass it?
2009-12-30T08:20:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	joako	as you type it out, add -y, like sudo apt-get -y purge ubuntu-desktop
2009-12-30T08:21:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		I'm not sure about completely removing prompts though, sorry.
2009-12-30T08:21:00.000Z	joako	MilitantPotato	Works fine... I don't care if there is output as long as it is non-interactive
2009-12-30T08:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		You maybe able to make a new app link, so when you type apt-get it auto enters apt-get -y
2009-12-30T08:22:00.000Z	joako		Now, anyone knows how this is possible? When I install ldap-auth-config it prompts for ldap server config, Can I somehow pass the options to apt-get install through the command so I don't have to answer those as well?
2009-12-30T08:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		but I'm not sure how that's done, only read about it
2009-12-30T08:23:00.000Z	joako	MilitantPotato	I really just need this for a shell script to remove and then reinstall some packages
2009-12-30T08:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		-y would do it then
2009-12-30T08:27:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	joako	you could make a custom shell script, name it whatever, and have it launch sudo apt-get -y, your shell wouldn't launch a manual apt-get, but point too the custom one you made, if you plan on doing it frequently.
2009-12-30T08:29:00.000Z	joako	MilitantPotato	I do have a shell script. What happens is the package ldap-auth-config when installed pops up a blue screen and asks to enter some settings and I would like those to be set to a certain value without interaction
