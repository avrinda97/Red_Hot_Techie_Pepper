2006-06-15T16:27:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	yes
2006-06-15T16:38:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	switch Amarok to whatever Backend they are using
2006-06-15T16:38:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	How?
2006-06-15T16:38:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	look in the Options menu for a start :P
2006-06-15T16:39:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	I am, I can't find any such thing.
2006-06-15T16:39:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	Xine options
2006-06-15T16:39:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	Engine even
2006-06-15T16:40:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	It's set to xine, and there's no other engine availible.
2006-06-15T16:40:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	What is Banshee using
2006-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	It's using GStreamer 2
2006-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	search apt for something like "amarok-gstreamer" or something
2006-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	this search command should turn up something. "apt-cache search amarok | grep gstreamer"
2006-06-15T16:43:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	Nothing showed up..
2006-06-15T16:43:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	try...gst
2006-06-15T16:44:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	try "apt-cache search amarok | grep gst"
2006-06-15T16:44:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	I allready tried that, nothing showed up. felixruina: I'm doing that now.. hope it works.
2006-06-15T16:46:00.000Z	Kyral	Tobberoth	anyway Xine should work with the libxine-extracodecs package
2006-06-15T16:46:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Kyral	Man, that person is evil... the arts engine won't work for me, so gstreamer is my only chouse
