2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	predius		Guys, do you have any idea why I'm not able to mount an ext2 drive?
2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	predius		mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc1,
2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	predius		       missing codepage or other error
2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	predius		       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	predius		       dmesg | tail  or so
2005-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	predius		then dmesg =
2005-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	predius		EXT2-fs: hdc1: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features (4).
2005-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	predius		EXT2-fs: hdc1: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features (4).
2005-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	bob2	predius	you made it with fedora and want to read it under ubuntu?
2005-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	bob2	predius	are you using a 2.4 kernel now or something?
2005-06-04T09:11:00.000Z	bob2	predius	what does "uname -r" print?
2005-06-04T09:12:00.000Z	predius	bob2	2.6.10-5-386
2005-06-04T09:12:00.000Z	bob2	predius	that is bizaare
2005-06-04T09:12:00.000Z	bob2	predius	and you created it under the same kernel?
2005-06-04T09:13:00.000Z	bob2	predius	that's very odd
2005-06-08T09:30:00.000Z	bob2	predius	they're not very well done and can cause problems
2005-06-08T09:31:00.000Z	bob2	predius	when did anyone suggest you were recommending them
2005-06-08T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	predius	because firefox has had numerous security issues since hoary came out
2005-06-08T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	predius	which are fixed in 1.0.2 in the security repository
