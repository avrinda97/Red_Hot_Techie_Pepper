2004-12-18T16:53:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	'sudo apt-get install xmms'
2004-12-18T16:53:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 That is, assuming that you don't want to use totem, because it pretty much sucks.
2004-12-18T16:54:00.000Z	martxel	geppy	i can reproduce divx with xmms?
2004-12-18T16:54:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 No, but you can with mplayer.
2004-12-18T16:55:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	Absolutely.  'mplayer /path/to/file.avi'
2004-12-18T16:55:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 Correct, without the apostrophes (').
2004-12-18T16:56:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 Could you read your private messages?
2004-12-18T16:56:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 The mplayer in multiverse is no good.
2004-12-19T17:16:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 I am running Hoary.
2004-12-19T17:16:00.000Z	martxel	geppy	and gen dont you have problems with the sound playing with totem, mplayer, xine?
2004-12-19T17:17:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 concurrent sound?
2004-12-19T17:17:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	I have no problems with sound in mplayer.
2004-12-19T17:18:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 Are you still using the mplayer from the repository?
2004-12-19T17:18:00.000Z	martxel	geppy	the problem is that i dont know how to install without the apt-get
2004-12-19T17:19:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 I was telling you;  if you run that shell script, then it will install it from source, without you needing to do a thing, other than run it.
2004-12-19T17:19:00.000Z	geppy	martxel	 If you'd like help installing it like that, I can help you.
