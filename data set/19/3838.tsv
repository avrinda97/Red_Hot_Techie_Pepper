2009-05-20T21:45:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	did you try install amarok 1.4?
2009-05-20T21:45:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	can we ?
2009-05-20T21:45:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	yeah I am in jaunty and I found instructions to install amarok 1.4 cause I didn't like the second one either
2009-05-20T21:47:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	exactly whats wrong with amarok now a days ? there cross platform dream has taken too much out of them ! ask them to forget about writing for mac ! they are spoiling a great piece of s/w and by the way how did you install it sir ? 1.4 in jaunty ?
2009-05-20T21:47:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	let me look up how I did it lol
2009-05-20T21:48:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	and why on earth is the setting turned off ? all you get is that damn global shorcuts ! and who on earth would care for global shortcuts when your amaork is stuck !
2009-05-20T21:49:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	lol i don't like amarok 2 because mine wouldn't play any mp3 at all I couldn't get the dang thing to work...and heres how to do it in kubuntu, but should work in xubuntu and normal ubuntu http://helpforlinux.blogspot.com/2009/05/get-amarok-14-in-kubuntu-904.html
2009-05-20T21:51:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	exactly any reason why its not playing any mp3 at all ? please dont tell me it only supports ogg
2009-05-20T21:52:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	i have no idea...i just installed amarok 1.4 and uninstalled amarok 2 and it works fine now
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	mate here is the solution they totally forgot to import libxine1-ffmpeg when amarok package is selected well try this this would work sudo apt-get install libxine1-ffmpeg its working like gem !
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	might have to try it but overall I still like the old one versus the new one
2009-05-20T21:56:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	 the new one reminds me of something I would see in Windows
2009-05-20T21:56:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	exactly ! they should strip it back to way it was !!
2009-05-20T21:56:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	exactly
2009-05-20T21:57:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	this new one looks too much like that made it look prettier then actually work better
2009-05-20T21:57:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	amarok is moving into mac right so they need to make it pretty :D
2009-05-20T21:58:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	yeah cause mac is mainly about making stuff purty then actually running good lol
2009-05-20T21:59:00.000Z	tv7497	pegon	any ways mate nice meeting you :) i would better catch up with ipl , too good match today
2009-05-20T22:00:00.000Z	pegon	tv7497	likewise man you have a good one and nice talking with you :)
