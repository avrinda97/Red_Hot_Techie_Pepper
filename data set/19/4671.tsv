2008-11-26T00:59:00.000Z	BusterHymen		how do i change the boot-time screen resolution?  I'd like to boot at 1680 x 1050 so that the ubuntu splash isn't distorted
2008-11-26T01:01:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	Good question! I always wanted know how to alter that boot splash screen, anyone know?
2008-11-26T01:01:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 i've been using startup-manager with some success...
2008-11-26T01:02:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 let me put it this way, i can change the splash screen, and I can change the resolution, but it doesn't offer me my native screen resolution.
2008-11-26T01:02:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	Looks like you might need to edit your xorg.conf file
2008-11-26T01:03:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	just backup your original first or be prepared for the infamous xfix ritual
2008-11-26T01:04:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 aah yes. i've been there... =(
2008-11-26T01:05:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	I think you should get to know VI first
2008-11-26T01:05:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 VI?
2008-11-26T01:05:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	terminal based text editor
2008-11-26T01:05:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 oh i've been using nano.  is that similar?
2008-11-26T01:06:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	yes, it really doesn't matter what editor you use
2008-11-26T01:09:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 how do you mean?  In the IRC chat?
2008-11-26T01:10:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 I just include your name in my message and your client will automatically hilight it
2008-11-26T01:10:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	Like this?
2008-11-26T01:10:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 yep
2008-11-26T01:11:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 yeah.  in my client it's red, but most people should see their names hilighted
2008-11-26T01:12:00.000Z	phoenix-mobile-1	BusterHymen	So right now, my name is hilighted to you?
2008-11-26T01:13:00.000Z	BusterHymen	phoenix-mobile-1	 yes, indeed =)
