2009-07-14T05:17:00.000Z	manbreadj		ok, somebody help me out here. i'm new to this crap. folks were helping me a few minutes ago, now i get no response. did I offend some protocol i don't know about? have i stumped all of you geniuses? is my ignorance that offensive?
2009-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	you have partion updates ... things are probably in a mess
2009-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	you need to get more space
2009-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	did you fill up a partition or the entire disk?
2009-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	start a terminal ... or press Alt+Ctrl+F1 to switch to text mode ... do "df" and see
2009-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	the lines with /dev/sda or /dev/hda are the ones to pay attention to ... sometimes also /dev/sdb or /dev/hdb
2009-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	how big is sda1, sda2, sda3, sda4, etc?
2009-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	the first column with numbers
2009-07-14T05:27:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	can you give me the size of it?
2009-07-14T05:28:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	this is a 4G storage device?
2009-07-14T05:30:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	the number you gave looks like a 4G device with some shaved off maybe for swap space ... did you install onto the SD card?
2009-07-14T05:32:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	it sounds like you installed more than I did, or have other data taking up space (like downloaded music)
2009-07-14T05:37:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	no registry per se ... various config files and databases
2009-07-14T05:38:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	yes ... they were being updated and could not complete when disk is full
2009-07-14T05:43:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	you can always reinstall ... that might help ... then this time don't add any new packages but check the space usage ... then update only and check usage again
2009-07-14T05:44:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	backup your data to the SD card or a USB memory stick
2009-07-14T05:50:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	you probably need to re-install from scratch ... that should work, even if you don't really need to ... but manually fixing as it is now probably is "in over your head"
2009-07-14T05:52:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	you might need to install less stuff
2009-07-14T05:52:00.000Z	Skaperen	manbreadj	I did an install then an upgrade, without adding other packages, and the size I got was much less than the size of your space
