2011-04-18T00:28:00.000Z	dean		Hi I was wondering if someone could help me with usb support for virtualbox?
2011-04-18T00:29:00.000Z	dean		Is anyone talking?
2011-04-18T00:30:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	you might be better off with a virtualbox channel i'd imagine, if there is one
2011-04-18T00:37:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	well, share a folder...
2011-04-18T00:40:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	but you're wanting to file share with the VM right?
2011-04-18T00:41:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	well, your VM has a working internet connection and has an IP address on the same network yeah? so they can ping one another? (firewalls permitting)
2011-04-18T00:42:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	i wouldn't expect so, you could try without
2011-04-18T00:45:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	so, decide on sharing a folder from which (probably the ubuntu host preferably), so create a folder called "share" in your home folder for example to start with
2011-04-18T00:45:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	i'm doing this right now too, between two networked physical PCs for fun, as i've never done it the easy way
2011-04-18T00:46:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	so i've right clicked on the folder "share" i created in my home directory, (Places -> Home) and i'm enabling sharing
2011-04-18T00:46:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	no problemo ^_^ if i can get it to work, haha - so it's asking me to install a 'service'
2011-04-18T00:47:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	ugh it wants me to restart my session to complete
2011-04-18T00:54:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	just copied 4GB to said share :)
2011-04-18T00:54:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	i ticked the boxes to allow read+write and guest access, then from my win7 desktop browsed to: \\IP of ubuntu PC\share
2011-04-18T00:55:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	it asked me for user+pass so i put "guest" as user and blank pass, then just hit enter and it worked \o/
2011-04-18T00:58:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	did you create a folder inside your home?
2011-04-18T00:59:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	is there a space in its' name?
2011-04-18T01:00:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	heh, neat
2011-04-18T01:02:00.000Z	daftykins	dean	no problem!
