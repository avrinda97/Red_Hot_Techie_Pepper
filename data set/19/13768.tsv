2005-01-28T08:38:00.000Z	thread		I accidentally upgraded to hoary... and I'm wondering how to roll back to warty
2005-01-28T08:38:00.000Z	thread		is that easy to do?
2005-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	thread		well, on purpose.. but now I realize I really didn't want to do that at all
2005-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	knghtbrd	thread	that's hard to undo.
2005-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	thread	knghtbrd	damn... and we lost synaptic.. and .. it's bad
2005-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	thread	knghtbrd	I guess the best bet is to just reinstall?
2005-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	thread		damn, okay.
2005-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	thread		thanks guys
2005-01-28T08:40:00.000Z	knghtbrd	thread	if you have /home on a seperate partition it can be less insane
2005-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	knghtbrd	thread	you can backup certain bits of configuration (dpkg --get-selections for example)
2005-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	thread	knghtbrd	what configuration?
2005-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	thread		I have a sources.list
2005-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	thread		that my friend uses who is more ubuntu-smart than me
2005-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	thread		we're just going to reinstall, copy the sources.list down, and go from there
2005-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	knghtbrd	thread	dpkg --get-selections spits out the list of installed packages
2005-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	thread		shouldn't be that big of a deal since it's a relatively fresh install
2005-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	thread		ah
2005-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	knghtbrd	thread	you can also back up bits of /etc you know you modified
2005-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	thread	knghtbrd	the beauty is that the install is barely customized. it's not a big deal at all
