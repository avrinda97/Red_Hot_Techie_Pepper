2007-02-03T10:37:00.000Z	kenthomson		Can someone please help me set the correct frequency for my monitor, i have the refresh rates for horizontal, vertical sync they are V-Synv:56-75 h-Sync:30-81, So how do i know whether my monitor can do 1440x900 (its native resolution) at 60 or 70 or 75 or 80 or 95hz?
2007-02-03T10:38:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	VertRefresh is in Hz, HorizSync is in kHzz
2007-02-03T10:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	yes please put the units there by yourself
2007-02-03T10:40:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	V-Synv:56-75 = 56Hz-75Hz
2007-02-03T10:41:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	i am looking for the single value as in 1440x900 @ 60hz or @ 75hz, the last digit is what i am interested in
2007-02-03T10:44:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	modern monitor have protection again out of specfication values
2007-02-03T10:45:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	look at the gtf command
2007-02-03T10:45:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	wwhats that
2007-02-03T10:46:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	your monitor support this,  gtf 1440 900 75
2007-02-03T10:46:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	how come you calulated the value of "75" that's what i am interested in
2007-02-03T10:47:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	gtf allow to generate custom modelines
2007-02-03T10:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	you didn't answer my question. HOw come you calculated that 75gz would be a safe valuye?
2007-02-03T10:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	i mean given the vetical and horizontal sync rates is there a way one can manually calculate the sync rates that a monitor is capabl;e of doing
2007-02-03T10:48:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	for 75Hz the hsync is 70.50kHz, that is a valid range for you minitor
2007-02-03T10:48:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	and what's the vsync
2007-02-03T10:49:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	vsync is refrest rate per seconds, it that case  75Hz
2007-02-03T10:50:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	woudl you bet your life on the fact that i can set the resolution at 75hz and wont damage my monitor?, you see i am really nervous and would't want to damage my monitor by trusting just like that
2007-02-03T10:52:00.000Z	hbaigu	kenthomson	i dont trush my life to a monitor that i don't know, maybe you just ask the manufacturer
2007-02-03T10:54:00.000Z	kenthomson	hbaigu	unop pbureau thanks for all the help, i really appreciate it. Have a nice day!
