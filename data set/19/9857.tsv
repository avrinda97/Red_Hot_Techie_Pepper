2007-08-05T11:39:00.000Z	macogw	Retnuh	i think wine has its own repositories which you have to add in system > admin > software sources, but then yes
2007-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	Retnuh	macogw	Is it called Wine Windows Emulator?
2007-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	macogw	Retnuh	maybe
2007-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	macogw	Retnuh	technically WINE stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator
