2009-06-07T15:48:00.000Z	ashmew2		omg someone needs to help me with this...My Internet is driving me crazy..Firefox downloads hang in between..
2009-06-07T15:49:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	Do you have windows ? Do downloads get stuck there too ?
2009-06-07T15:50:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	Im dual booting with Fedora..Downloads do not hang there..I used to get disconnected off IRC/Yahoo (via Pidgin) as well..
2009-06-07T15:51:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	well too bad cuz downloads get hung here on windows and linux :P i thought i found someone with the same problem :P
2009-06-07T15:51:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	Ok , im using AIrtel as ISP btw
2009-06-07T15:55:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	BSNL here ... it started quite a while back - downloads just don't complete or very rarely do.
2009-06-07T15:56:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	Just started with Jaunty on my end..was fine until intrepid...
2009-06-07T15:57:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	there could be a problem with the number of connections firefox is making to download a file ...
2009-06-07T15:58:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	I dont know..Ive added the DNS servers and everything and whats the point if i cant check my mail while downloading from rapidshare ?
2009-06-07T15:59:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	try using wget via command line to download a file
2009-06-07T15:59:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	Wget wont work with rapidshare etc..you need to wait and sometimes do a Captcha
2009-06-07T16:00:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	 by number of connections I meant concurrent number of connections - as in downloading the file in more than 2 parts at the same time
2009-06-07T16:00:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	so it's only with rapidshare ?
2009-06-07T16:03:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	hmm calm down :P if it's happening only with firefox then it must be solvable .. but downloads get hung for rapidshare only ?
2009-06-07T16:03:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	I am pretty sure its not only firefox..because i keep getting disconnected from yahoo messenger and IRC channels like i just did..Rapidshare/Megaupload/Filebase.to , everywhere , the problem's everywhere
2009-06-07T16:04:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	and none of this happens on Fedora ? Well that's strange - honestly I can't think of anything :(
2009-06-07T16:05:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	Nothing like this on Fedora..I would use Fedora but it has its own issues which give me a headache anyways..Maybe installing Karmic would help ?
2009-06-07T16:06:00.000Z	rohit	ashmew2	I don't know - better wait for some else in here to reply
2009-06-07T16:06:00.000Z	ashmew2	rohit	Been on the forums for 3 weeks now and IRC 4 days..No one knows
