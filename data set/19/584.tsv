2011-12-20T02:58:00.000Z	phil_phys		dear friends why can I do increase windows partition and not ubuntu partition?
2011-12-20T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	use gparted from a livecd to re-size
2011-12-20T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	no
2011-12-20T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	use a livecd
2011-12-20T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	whats the issue then
2011-12-20T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	unmount the ubuntu partition
2011-12-20T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	not what i said
2011-12-20T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	unmount the ubuntu partition
2011-12-20T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	you've said that
2011-12-20T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	you don't have a hard disk'??? then what are you trying to partiton
2011-12-20T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	what has that got to do with anything ?
2011-12-20T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	ok - you need to make sure your disks are not mounted, and there is free space available NEXT to the partition you want to resize
2011-12-20T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	repeating the same thing won't change anything, I've read that, and I'm advising you what to do
2011-12-20T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	1.) make sure the partitions are unmounted 2.) make sure there is free space NEXT to the partition you want to resize
2011-12-20T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	right click the partitions in gparted, there is normally an unmount option
2011-12-20T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	make sure there is freespace NEXT to the partition you want to restore
2011-12-20T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	ok, I'm not interested in helping you any more as you just repeat the same thing over and over
2011-12-20T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	phil_phys	good luck
2011-12-20T03:11:00.000Z	phil_phys	ikonia	there is free space
