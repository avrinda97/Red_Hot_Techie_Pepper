2009-10-27T14:34:00.000Z	timmillwood		thinking of making the switch to ubuntu. Wondering what laptop you'd recommend?
2009-10-27T14:35:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	I would just find some nice ones you like and then search for issues with ubuntu.  But dell and systm76 sell laptops with ubuntu
2009-10-27T14:35:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	system76*
2009-10-27T14:36:00.000Z	timmillwood	jrib	thanks.
2010-07-26T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	why?
2010-07-26T16:58:00.000Z	timmillwood	jrib	because I am getting some errors on php 5.3
2010-07-26T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	"some errors"?
2010-07-26T17:14:00.000Z	timmillwood	jrib	nevermind, I was just after a simple answer, not an interrogation.
2010-07-26T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	well I'm asking you the questions because it's not "easy" to downgrade software.  So more likely than not, you have some problem for which there is a better solution.  If you don't want to share what the actual problem is, so that we can help you, that's fine.
2010-07-26T17:16:00.000Z	timmillwood	jrib	the issue is with Drupal 6 that does not support 5.3, drupal 7 will, but does not have a stable release yet.
2010-07-26T17:17:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	interesting, does that mean the drupal6 package is broken?  Have you checked for bug reports against it?
2010-07-26T17:18:00.000Z	timmillwood	jrib	it's not broken, just doesn't support 5.3.
2010-07-26T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	what do you mean by that?  It seems contradictory

2010-07-26T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	so how is it not broken?
2010-07-26T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	does the ubuntu package patch around it?
2010-07-26T17:20:00.000Z	timmillwood	jrib	php is broken. ;)
2011-02-02T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	timmillwood	ubuntu LTS will give you 5 years support on the server from canonical
