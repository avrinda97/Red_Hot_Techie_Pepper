2011-07-01T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	xgt0011	do you mean power as in "resources" or power as in battery power
2011-07-01T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	xgt0011	have a look for yourself
2011-07-01T16:40:00.000Z	xgt0011	ikonia	battery power, dr_willi1 becaues there was a bug filed in code.google.com about more wakeups caused by chrome
2011-07-01T16:40:00.000Z	ikonia	xgt0011	these aren't really ubuntu issues you're asking
2011-07-01T16:41:00.000Z	xgt0011	ikonia	it was specific to Linux version
2011-07-01T16:41:00.000Z	ikonia	xgt0011	this is "ubuntu" support, not linux applications
2011-07-01T16:42:00.000Z	xgt0011	ikonia	apologies
2011-07-01T16:50:00.000Z	ikonia	xgt0011	if you hit the disable button, do you see a keycode in the xorg logs?
