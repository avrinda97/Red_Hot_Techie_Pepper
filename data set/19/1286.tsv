2011-03-11T06:48:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	naw x starts up by default
2011-03-11T06:49:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	you might need to tink around with your xorg configuration file depending on how ambitious you are
2011-03-11T06:54:00.000Z	fisix	skxx	what do you mean extensibl(sp)?
2011-03-11T06:55:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	it's insanely configurable and has a metric ass-ton of scripty addon type goodies
2011-03-11T06:56:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	you should try it out
2011-03-11T06:56:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	it rocks my socks off
2011-03-11T06:57:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	it's just about the greatest thing you can use for barebones web editing... and if you code or script it's the bee's friggin knees.
2011-03-11T07:05:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	rm -rf will del anything you have the priveleges to delete
2011-03-11T07:05:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	and there's no getting it back.
2011-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	skxx	fisix	there are so many ways to bone your system if you've got root priveleges.  that's why ubuntu runs without root by default.
