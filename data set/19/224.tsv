2012-06-14T10:14:00.000Z	chintanparikh		Hey all. I'm having an issue with Gnome shell. It seems to be quite laggy. All the animations that should be smooth are jagged, etc. Any ideas how to fix this? I doubt its my system as it's fairly high end
2012-06-14T10:15:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	it is probably your drivers
2012-06-14T10:16:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	That would make sense. It's also become more noticeable after I started using dual screens. Does Ubuntu have anything to automatically find updated drivers, or should I go to the vender sites manually?
2012-06-14T10:18:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	there is a tool called Jockey (it's actually called Additional Drivers in the menu) that you can use to install proprietary drivers
2012-06-14T10:19:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	Thanks.
2012-06-14T10:21:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	It's not great, but its nothing to worry about. It just means that your GUI is using up a fair bit of your CPU
2012-06-14T10:22:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	I see. Is there a way to make that lower? I assume that's also slowing me down and causing this lag
2012-06-14T10:23:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	drivers might let your GPU take over more of the load
2012-06-14T10:23:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	Installing now :)
2012-06-14T10:24:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	cHEERS
2012-06-14T10:27:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	yeah, once you upgrade to the good aTI drivers, that should improve
2012-06-14T10:28:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	Hm, installation of the driver failed
2012-06-14T10:29:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	does it say why at all?
2012-06-14T10:30:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	Just said to look at /var/log/jockey.log, which makes no sense to me. I tried to install the post-release update one, but for some reason, after failing it deactivated my first one
2012-06-14T10:31:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	I'm fairly sure I already had the first one installed from when i set up ubuntu
2012-06-14T10:32:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	Oh yeah, it was a huge pain

2012-06-14T10:59:00.000Z	agc93	chintanparikh	I at least know whats going on
2012-06-14T11:02:00.000Z	chintanparikh	agc93	I see, thanks a lot. I'll let you know if I do get it fixed. It's a damn shame. I basically need to choose between dual displays + lag, or a single display
