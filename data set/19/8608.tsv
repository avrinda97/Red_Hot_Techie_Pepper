2007-04-18T07:35:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		hello all.
2007-04-18T07:35:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		I'm having an issue. Again it seems.
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		Anyone else having one? Maybe we can reciprocate.
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		hey Crazytom
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		Seen you here a few times before.
2007-04-18T07:38:00.000Z	Crazytom	dragonfyre13	hey, got a question?
2007-04-18T07:41:00.000Z	Crazytom	dragonfyre13	i do wireless....
2007-04-18T07:41:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	ah. That helps.
2007-04-18T07:42:00.000Z	Crazytom	dragonfyre13	not really, i'm afraid....
2007-04-18T07:42:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	maybe you can tell me if the RT73 driver is working in fiesty yet then.
2007-04-18T07:42:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	how come? It's just so simple! ^_^
2007-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	Crazytom	dragonfyre13	my wired is simple.. i plug it in and at most do a dhclient
2007-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	how about the RT73 driver? That's not simple at all.
2007-04-18T07:44:00.000Z	Crazytom	dragonfyre13	it's it not broadcom and it doesn't just work use ndiswrapper
2007-04-18T07:44:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	that is ture.
2007-04-18T07:44:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	true*
2007-04-18T07:45:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	unfortunately, for a clean freak like me on my lappy, I can't use binary blobs. There's an RT73 driver out there that works fine in edgy, just wondered if it worked in fiesty yet. I maintain a thread on a particularly difficult laptop on the forums.
2007-04-18T07:46:00.000Z	Crazytom	dragonfyre13	they you are far more competent than i my friend
2007-04-18T07:47:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Crazytom	that's debatable. I think I have a sickness. Ubuntuitis.
