2008-06-22T06:28:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	when you go to the Application>Developement or whatever menu list, click and drag the application you use the most to an area on the desktop (might not work for menu items on Applications or Places, but I know this works on items listed on the main menu)
2008-06-22T06:33:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	which applications are you trying to add to your desktop?
2008-06-22T06:34:00.000Z	shaba1	FastZ	 I just want a general method of doing it
2008-06-22T06:34:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	if you know the executable path to the application, you can just create a launcher on your desktop that will open the application when you double click on the icon
2008-06-22T06:35:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	for instance, you can create a launcher for Firefox on your desktop by right clicking the desktop and selecting New Launcher (or something like that) and then naming it Firefox and then for the command field, type firefox (all lowercase) and then pick an icon and then you're done
2008-06-22T06:43:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	im booting up my xubuntu machine so I can help you figure out how to create launchers on your desktop
2008-06-22T06:48:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	finally booted!  getting logged in.  I'll be right back
2008-06-22T07:02:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	you still here?  I can't figure out how to create a launcher on fluxbox so i started searching forums for some stuff and came across this thread that shows you how to manipulate your menu to show whatever you want it to show  http://www.justlinux.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=151621
2008-06-22T07:12:00.000Z	FastZ	shaba1	did you check out that link i posted?
