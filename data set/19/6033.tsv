2008-06-03T00:13:00.000Z	danf	stefg	so how should I ask this ? :)
2008-06-03T00:14:00.000Z	danf		anyway, who used gparted recently please ?
2008-06-03T00:15:00.000Z	stefg	danf	along the lines of:' i tried to use gparted <version> to resize my ntfs partition sda1. now it's gone, and i don't know how to recover. I searched google and the forums but couldn't find anything, Any chance to get my data back?'
2008-06-03T00:16:00.000Z	danf	stefg	ok i'll do it :)
2008-06-03T00:16:00.000Z	danf		ty
2008-06-03T00:17:00.000Z	danf		the problem with gparted is that it can't run on my laptop. I tried the version 0.3.6-7. The version 0.3.4-11 worked well... but I don't have it anymore
2008-06-03T00:18:00.000Z	stefg	danf	your partition table might be in a state wher gparted refuses to work. does 'sudo fdisk -l' state anything out of the ordinary?
2008-06-03T00:20:00.000Z	danf	stefg	ok i didn't say that I used the live-cd version. I only have vista for now
2008-06-03T00:20:00.000Z	danf	stefg	read: I forgot to say
2008-06-03T00:20:00.000Z	danf		sory
2008-06-03T00:20:00.000Z	danf		*sorry
2008-06-03T00:20:00.000Z	danf		-_-
2008-06-03T00:20:00.000Z	stefg	danf	vista might use the infamous microsoft ldm. gparted is lost at that
2008-06-03T00:21:00.000Z	danf	stefg	really ? :s
2008-06-03T00:21:00.000Z	danf	stefg	no wait a minute
2008-06-03T00:22:00.000Z	stefg	danf	ldm is completly different from a good old dos partition table (compare linux lvm) gparted can only handle traditional partition tables
2008-06-03T00:22:00.000Z	danf	stefg	no way, cause I used  the version 0.3.4-11 and no problem occured. Now I can't find the cd
2008-06-03T00:22:00.000Z	danf	stefg	i think that there a problem with the last version
