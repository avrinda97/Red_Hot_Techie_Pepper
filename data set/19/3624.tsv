2009-07-01T04:46:00.000Z	ademos		I'm setting up a new storage hard disk, and it's asking for a partition table. ----- I see the msdos is the default partition table, but is there a better (opensource) parition table I should use?
2009-07-01T04:47:00.000Z	ademos		Current running Ubuntu 9.04
2009-07-01T04:47:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	will you use it in other OS? or just linux?
2009-07-01T04:48:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	well it's an internal hard disk so I'm fine with a linux-only parition table ---- Also, I'm formating it with ext4, so that in itself will make it Linux-only without extra software on Windows
2009-07-01T04:49:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	what software are you using to format it?
2009-07-01T04:49:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	I'm using gparted
2009-07-01T04:50:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	so you've decided to go with ext4 as the Filesystem
2009-07-01T04:50:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	well yes. I'm already using it for my system hard disk, and it's been very reliable, and definitely faster
2009-07-01T04:51:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	good. but what was your problem again? partition table type? I don't remember being prompted by gparted about partition tables
2009-07-01T04:53:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	my problem is the following; I just bought this hard disk (2 TB Western Digital) and so far I've plugged it in and run gparted. The first message I got when choosing "new" from the menu, was a message asking me which parition table I wanted. It tells me msdos is default, but that sounds strange, but opensource-wise and best-software-wise
2009-07-01T05:02:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	hard to say, because i've never ran into that situation before.
2009-07-01T05:03:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	alright well since msdos is default I guess I'll stick with that. Better safe than sorry I suppose.
2009-07-01T05:03:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	did you read this thread? http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1051692.html
2009-07-01T05:05:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	interesting discussion but the result was sadly...
2009-07-01T05:05:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	so I guess I'll stick with the default to make sure everything runs
2009-07-01T05:06:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	yeah. msdos seems the way to go here. i don't think you want to try with the other alternatives mentioned: aix, amiga, bsd, dvh, gpt, mac, pc98, sun, loop
2009-07-01T05:07:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	haha yeah, those aren't really any better I suppose, just different; thanks for the help
2009-07-01T05:07:00.000Z	jirg	ademos	you're welcome. I learned something today
2009-07-01T05:07:00.000Z	ademos	jirg	haha me too
