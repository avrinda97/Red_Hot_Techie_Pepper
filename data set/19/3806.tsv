2009-07-19T21:55:00.000Z	hybrid	linuxguy2009	im trying the kernel out cause i read that it is supposed to make full surround possible, but seems like it doesn't work out of the box
2009-07-19T22:00:00.000Z	hybrid	linuxguy2009	i can't get any sound out of it at the moment at all, i'm not sure i fully understood how this is supposed to work, am i supposed to still get the crappy drivers from creative, or are they in the kernel?
2009-07-19T22:01:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	Should be in the kernel I seriously dought creative even has any linux drivers to speak of.
2009-07-19T22:02:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	There are a few sites that have compatible hardware lists.Might want to check them. Also can google for your issue Im sure there are lots of others with the same issue with that card.
2009-07-19T22:02:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	Are you on 9.04?
2009-07-19T22:02:00.000Z	hybrid	linuxguy2009	yes
2009-07-19T22:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	Someone on google mentions that creative does have linux drivers. Whats the exact model you have?
2009-07-19T22:07:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	try these yet? http://opensource.creative.com/soundcard.html
2009-07-19T22:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	http://support.creative.com/downloads/welcome.aspx?nDriverType=-1#type_-1
2009-07-19T22:10:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	Linux driver source there. Looks like you have to build it or whatever. I didnt see a pre built deb there.
2009-07-19T22:11:00.000Z	hybrid	linuxguy2009	thank you but its the same drivers... according to http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/...2.6.30-git8.log x-fi should be supported?
2009-07-19T22:11:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	404 not found
2009-07-19T22:12:00.000Z	hybrid	linuxguy2009	http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.30-git8.log
2009-07-19T22:13:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	 Yeah it looks that way.
2009-07-19T22:15:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	You absolutely sure the drivers at opensource creative site are the same and no good?
2009-07-19T22:17:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	You should call creative tech support and see if they can point you in the right direction. Seriously dought they will be any help whatsoever but its worth a try.
2009-07-19T22:19:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	Soon there will be no need for any of this as the ALSA team and kernel team are working hard on integrating them into the core Linux system. Watch out for this in Karmic Koala (see bottom of post)! http://www.fusetext.com/2009/05/ubuntu-linux-creative-sound-blaster-x-fi-driver-installation-how-to/
2009-07-19T22:24:00.000Z	hybrid	linuxguy2009	interesting post, it says it will first come in 2.6.31 while the logs for 2.6.30 said in a way that it was there already..., i am running 2.6.30 right now and 2.6.31 is in RC stage
2009-07-19T22:25:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	hybrid	yeah looks like its in the process of getting done.
