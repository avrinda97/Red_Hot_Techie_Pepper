2008-02-26T10:14:00.000Z	kernfreak	workman	this is where i usual say rtfm after you saying what you did, just create another user
2008-02-26T10:16:00.000Z	workman		root@workman-linux:/home# ls
2008-02-26T10:16:00.000Z	workman		workman
2008-02-26T10:16:00.000Z	workman		still workman :|
2008-02-26T10:16:00.000Z	kernfreak		once you create another user, with the name you want  login, and sudo to move your files over, making sure not to change the permissions, or, you can goto the links that were provided, as they can probably be more help
