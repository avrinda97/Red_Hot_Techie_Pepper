2006-11-24T14:06:00.000Z	elubie		Hi! I'm trying to install the nvidia-glx drivers on Edgy with the generic kernel (AMD Athlon X2) and it wants to install linux-image-2.6.17-10-386 which I think I don't want?
2006-11-24T14:06:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	Yes you do
2006-11-24T14:06:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	Just means the driver needs an updated kernel
2006-11-24T14:07:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	I think that was why after installing them once ubuntu only recognized one processor
2006-11-24T14:09:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	ok, will try then, thanks for the help
2006-11-24T14:09:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	im a n00b too, but im tryin to help :)

2006-11-24T14:26:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	The X-Server didn't start after I installed nvidia-glx and booted into generic. Error message was something like The NVIDIA is kernel module version 1.0_8774 and the X module version is 1.0_8776
2006-11-24T14:27:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	Hmmmm, the nvidia-module is of a higher version, odd
2006-11-24T14:28:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	Wait, reinstall the nvidia-glx with the new kernel, that might be it
2006-11-24T14:28:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	eh the other way round, nvidia is lower version
2006-11-24T14:28:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	Then sorry, I got no idea.... I just know that's how I did it
2006-11-24T14:29:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	np, might try to install nvidia-glx again
2006-11-24T14:30:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	inside the new kernel tho. If you do it on the old kernel, it wont work, I think
2006-11-24T14:31:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	hmm, that would mean the module on the generic kernel is older than the one on the 386 kernel
2006-11-24T14:33:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	I know that when u install the driver, it installs a kernel module. If the module is installed on the wrong kernel.....
2006-11-24T14:38:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	It worked! I just found out that there were newer linux-generic-restricted modules in the repo. After updating that it worked! Yikes!
2006-11-24T14:39:00.000Z	elubie	GeForce	so, many thanks :)
2006-11-24T14:39:00.000Z	GeForce	elubie	grats :)
