2005-11-24T07:34:00.000Z	Blode		how do I ping in ubuntu?
2005-11-24T07:35:00.000Z	Blode		dabaR?
2005-11-24T07:35:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	from  terminal.
2005-11-24T07:36:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	Blode also, post the output of ifconfig to paste.ubuntulinux.nl, and while you are at it, post the /etc/network/interfaces file. You can display it using: cat /etc/network/interfaces
2005-11-24T07:36:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	ping http://www.google.com?
2005-11-24T07:37:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	ping www.google.com as someone said.
2005-11-24T07:37:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	Unknown host
2005-11-24T07:37:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	ok, paste what I told you to paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-11-24T07:42:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	I can't paste from ubuntu to paste.ubuntu.nl because its not connected to the internet.
2005-11-24T07:47:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	any idea how to get http working wirelessly for the thinkpad?
2005-11-24T07:48:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	do you get an IP address assigned?
2005-11-24T07:49:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	Do I have to assign it an IP? Won't my router assign one automatically?
2005-11-24T07:49:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	yes, it will, does it?
2005-11-24T07:50:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	What's the quickest way to check?
2005-11-24T07:50:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	ifconfig in a terminal, look for inet addr:
2005-11-24T07:51:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	there's an inet6 addr:, but for the wifi connection, it's jibberish. It assigns it an IP when it's connected via a network cable.
2005-11-24T07:52:00.000Z	Blode	dabaR	I can surf just fine hooking it up directly to the router.
2005-11-24T07:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	I am not knowledgeable about wireless. You can start at the wiki, if noone else knows.
2005-11-24T07:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Blode	he sent you a pm.
