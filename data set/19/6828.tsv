2007-12-02T01:02:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	what adapter do u have?
2007-12-02T01:02:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	Atheros AR5212
2007-12-02T01:03:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	is it detected ? .. i think the Atheros chipset is supported well in ubuntu
2007-12-02T01:04:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	It is detetced. But I get slow bitrates.
2007-12-02T01:04:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	Like down to 2mbps.
2007-12-02T01:04:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	The card is capable of 54mbps and I get that amount unders WindowsXP.
2007-12-02T01:05:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	.. hmm
2007-12-02T01:07:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	Do you think I should try ndiswrapper?
2007-12-02T01:07:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	AFAIK, ndiswrappers perform lesser than native drivers , but you can give it a try!
2007-12-02T01:08:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	 Looks more like a settings problem though ,... if you are getting better speeds using the same access point under windoze XP
2007-12-02T01:09:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	Like what?
2007-12-02T01:09:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	Cant say , can you post the output of iwconfig?
2007-12-02T01:10:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	http://rafb.net/p/K2ZWnt69.html
2007-12-02T01:12:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	 do you get a good signal from the accespoint?
2007-12-02T01:13:00.000Z	TigranG	lfs	30-40%, but its at the same place when I'm running Windows. I get 54 so I dont think its because of that
2007-12-02T01:14:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	 hmm .. just wondering , if you are primarily using the access point fron browsing , then it should not really affect you unless your internet pipe is bigger than 2mbps
2007-12-02T01:17:00.000Z	lfs	TigranG	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=38972 this may help
