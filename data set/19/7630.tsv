2007-07-23T06:16:00.000Z	kirk4linux	rampy	 - does it ask for a key to connect and can it see the beacon from your router?
2007-07-23T06:17:00.000Z	rampy	kirk4linux	 yes i can see the SSID of my network and other networks nearby
2007-07-23T06:21:00.000Z	rampy	kirk4linux	 do i need to install WPA applicant?
2007-07-23T06:23:00.000Z	kirk4linux	rampy	that could be - when I connected my Atheroes nic i did not see an option for WPA, so I just used WEP since it was supported out of the box - it's nice when things just work with minimal effort
2007-07-23T06:33:00.000Z	kirk4linux	rampy	I had to leave for awhile - did you get into your router?
