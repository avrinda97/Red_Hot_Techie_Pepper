2011-06-18T01:09:00.000Z	saburo		I have found that the last release of ubuntu have a bug
2011-06-18T01:10:00.000Z	jefelex	saburo	- is it an HDMI tv or just a regular tv
2011-06-18T01:10:00.000Z	saburo		is a hdmi tv
2011-06-18T01:10:00.000Z	jefelex	saburo	- then it may be a bug in your video driver for hdmi
2011-06-18T01:11:00.000Z	saburo		whit
2011-06-18T01:11:00.000Z	jefelex		if you don't like unity, then deselect it from the login screen to normal gnome screen\
2011-06-18T01:12:00.000Z	saburo		with te previous release of linux kernel all go well
2011-06-18T01:12:00.000Z	jefelex	saburo	- so its not working now, when it was working before?
2011-06-18T01:12:00.000Z	saburo		yes
2011-06-18T01:13:00.000Z	saburo		after update I've found the problem
2011-06-18T01:14:00.000Z	jefelex		then I'd go back a version until it works,and then try to figure out  what is what is wrong what is wrong with the driver
2011-06-18T01:15:00.000Z	saburo		I know that if i boot the laptop with kernel ending with 35 all work
2011-06-18T01:17:00.000Z	jefelex	saburo	- when you are booting your computer, do you get the menu about different kernals you can use?
2011-06-18T01:18:00.000Z	saburo		yes....to start laptop and to use the tv I must go to previous linux version
2011-06-18T01:20:00.000Z	jefelex	saburo	- now it's easy!!  just have to figure out what is different in the configuration when you use the newer kernel - whave version are you using
2011-06-18T01:22:00.000Z	jefelex		gotta run - be back later!!
2011-06-18T01:23:00.000Z	saburo	jefelex	I don't understand.  Where I can found the configuration file to compare?
