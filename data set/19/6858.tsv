2008-01-07T17:31:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	You shouldnt be running a telnet server, but its safe to have the client installed.
2008-01-07T17:31:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Its unsafe because there is no encryption, it sends everything, including passwords, in plaintext.
2008-01-07T17:32:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Yes.
2008-01-07T17:32:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Its called telnetd
2008-01-07T17:35:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	odd, I have port 23 open too, but it identifies itself as openssh.
2008-01-07T17:36:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	I dont think its anything to worry about.
2008-01-07T17:36:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	You can use firestarter to close that port.
2008-01-07T17:37:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Why not?
2008-01-07T17:38:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	let me open mine, give me a second.
2008-01-07T17:39:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Try clicking in the area where a rule would appear before using the add-rule button
2008-01-07T17:41:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Click on the 'allow service' area, and then just input the services that you want to allow.
2008-01-07T17:42:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	It will block everything else.
2008-04-14T03:27:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Please join #ubuntu+1 for Hardy/8.04 support/discussion.
2008-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	When 8.04 is released there will be no new packages for 8.04, save backports.
2008-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	sveakex	Pici	you mean when 8.10 is released there will be no new packages for 8.04?
2008-04-15T07:14:00.000Z	Pici	sveakex	Do you mean version upgrades or security patches?
