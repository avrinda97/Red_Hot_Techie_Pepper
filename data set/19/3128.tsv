2009-11-13T05:28:00.000Z	fcuk112		my firefox 3.5 takes a long time to startup, anyone else experiencing this?  i have disabled all my addons and still having the same problem.
2009-11-13T05:28:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	maybe a corrupted profile? try loading firefox with a fresh one
2009-11-13T05:28:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	how do i do that?
2009-11-13T05:29:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	try in a terminal. i hope it works in ffox 3.5:  firefox -profilemanager
2009-11-13T05:31:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	created a new profile, still the same issue.  there is a lot of disk activity on startup.
2009-11-13T05:31:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	hmm
2009-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	FF also goes dimmed for a while...
2009-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	hmm. are you running compiz?
2009-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	yes.
2009-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	maybe a compiz plugin is slowing ffox down for some reason
2009-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	which one I don't know, though.
2009-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	that's strange, i only use cube and grid...  no problem in the past.
2009-11-13T05:35:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	alright. when did your problem start? do you remember?
2009-11-13T05:35:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	only recently...  does doing hugday init on the profile got anything to do with it perhaps?
2009-11-13T05:36:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	hugday init?
2009-11-13T05:36:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	safe-mode works fine.
2009-11-13T05:36:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	aha, interesting
2009-11-13T05:37:00.000Z	fcuk112	kostkon	ah i just reset everything using safe-mode and it seems ok now, thanks.
2009-11-13T05:38:00.000Z	kostkon	fcuk112	:)
