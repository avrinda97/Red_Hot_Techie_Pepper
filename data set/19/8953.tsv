2008-07-03T22:49:00.000Z	djzn		fryguy: is there a way in metacity? (i know there is in beryl)
2008-07-03T22:50:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	You might be able to do something like that with devilspie
2008-07-03T22:53:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	Like I said, you can use devilspie to do that, but its requires installing a package and editing a file.
2009-07-10T20:38:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	Manually...
2009-07-10T20:38:00.000Z	djzn	Pici	chmod or chown
2009-10-02T00:12:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	cpu architecture doesn't matter when it comes to the filesystem.
2009-10-02T00:13:00.000Z	djzn	Pici	it does not interfer whatsoever with filesystems....?
2009-10-02T00:13:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	Correct.
2009-10-02T00:14:00.000Z	djzn	Pici	i am actually waiting for 9.10 release, for me to start from ZERO....
2009-10-02T00:14:00.000Z	djzn	Pici	are the video codecs and stuff stable in 64bit
2009-10-02T00:18:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	Best to ask questions about 9.10 in #ubuntu+1
2010-03-19T21:24:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	#ubuntu-offtopic
2010-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	cabaro: No, its not.
2010-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	djzn	Pici	yes it is... you have it
2010-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	djzn	Pici	has got it
2010-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	Lucid will be released some time during the 29th, i.e: there is no exact time. You can await the announcement in #ubuntu-release-party
2010-10-14T23:18:00.000Z	Pici	djzn	I'd say that its not Ubuntu related and should be answered in ##english
