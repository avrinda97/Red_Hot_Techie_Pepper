2008-08-13T20:19:00.000Z	ice_cream		yea, i know how you feel, ncls =D  i often ask, what... "difficult" questions? =p
2008-08-13T20:21:00.000Z	ice_cream		ext3 is not the only answer
2008-08-13T20:23:00.000Z	ice_cream		what is the preferred method of package searching via cli?
2008-08-13T20:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	apt-cache search
2008-08-13T20:24:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	oakgrove, powergoal2  --  apt-cache search    searches the descriptions, too, and if i do --names-only then the output is very limited (unlike aptitude search w/ formatting) ..
2009-09-18T18:52:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	what's your point?
2009-09-18T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	that in jaunty ff35 does not replace ff3 is a separate program that identifies itself as different to. so this (and my /usr/bin/firefox link stopped  pointing to -3.5)
2009-09-18T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	does not make sense. installing ff35 ddoes not change that simlink
2009-09-18T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	and if you did the link manually is normal that the upgrade broke it
2009-09-18T18:54:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	ok, so they're distinct packages and it's ok to remove 3.0 then
2009-09-18T18:55:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	k, thx
2009-09-18T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	yes. it will remove ubuntu-desktop too i guess
2009-09-18T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	just remember to install ubuntu-desktop before doing the dist upgrade
2009-09-18T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	if you do of course
2009-09-18T18:56:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	 through sudo do-relase-upgrade i think
2009-09-18T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	it is the same you need the ubuntu meta-packages installed to avoid problems
2009-09-18T19:02:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	k, did a bit of package searching --> i think ubuntu-minimal is my meta package, as you put it
2009-09-18T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	ice_cream	there are various... if you have firefox is a desktop machine so you need ubuntu-desktop minimal standar etc...
2009-09-18T19:04:00.000Z	ice_cream	erUSUL	yes, i have standard installed too, but not desktop
