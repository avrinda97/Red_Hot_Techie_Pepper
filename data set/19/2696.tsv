2010-01-28T11:56:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	Changing the screen resolution is a fairly simple request that is often left un-reversed with programs that crash before correcting it.  Have you tried launching the program from a terminal?  Maybe there's something there that will give a bit more insight.

2010-01-28T12:00:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	Looks like it's trying to use something that your hardware doesn't support (or at least that you don't have driver support for)
2010-01-28T12:01:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	XFree86-VidModeExtension (on line 102) and XF86VidModeGetGammaRamp (on line 103)
2010-01-28T12:01:00.000Z	CAPcap	cyqotiq	yeah its prob asking for 3D which isnt supported well in the open driver for my card
2010-01-28T12:01:00.000Z	cyqotiq		what is your chipset?
2010-01-28T12:02:00.000Z	CAPcap		ati mobility radeon 900
2010-01-28T12:02:00.000Z	CAPcap		9000***
2010-01-28T12:02:00.000Z	CAPcap		which ati no longer supports so i cant get prop drivers either
2010-01-28T12:04:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	That's the best I can come up with, off hand
2010-01-28T12:05:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	Is there a settings dialog where you can turn the hardware support off?
2010-01-28T12:05:00.000Z	CAPcap	cyqotiq	where? for what?
2010-01-28T12:06:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	For warsow.  I'm not familiar with it.
2010-01-28T12:06:00.000Z	CAPcap	cyqotiq	its a game. and it just never loads so i cant really change any settings in it
2010-01-28T12:07:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	Then the best I know to say is check google for a fix.  Maybe there's a manual hack to the settings file or something.  otherwise, I don't know.
2010-01-28T12:08:00.000Z	CAPcap	cyqotiq	thanks for your help.
2010-01-28T12:08:00.000Z	cyqotiq	CAPcap	np... sorry I couldn't be more help
