2010-03-26T07:26:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	yeah what vVv said...... winxp needs to be on the first partition or it complains.... if it where at sda1 thered be no problems
2010-03-26T07:27:00.000Z	arunbabu	iflema	vVvHACKERvVv: is there anyway I can solve my problem without reinstalling ?
2010-03-26T08:08:00.000Z	arunbabu	iflema	you told that XP needs to be first partition for no problems right? so isn't there anyway to fixit if it's not first partition ?
2010-03-26T08:13:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	that used to be the way.... may not be any more..... however a small partition up front say 50mb would do..... but that has its own issues
2010-03-26T08:15:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	(hd0,4)....... well......
2010-03-26T08:17:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	its windows fault :)..... you could shuffle some what.... if you dont have much going on in either os and youve backed up ya important stuff.... go again
2010-03-26T08:19:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	you could resize the ubuntu partion, make a small partitiona upfront, reload mbr from win install cd and reinstall ubuntu
2010-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	arunbabu	iflema	how to resize the ubuntu partition ? can remove it entirely ? and make xp to (hd0,0)
2010-03-26T08:22:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	uninstall ubuntu.... split its partion in 2..... the first partition 100mb say (nfts or fat32) and the rest for ubuntu later on
2010-03-26T08:23:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	reinstall the mbr from intall cd will use the 100 mb and fix winblows
2010-03-26T08:25:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	or look into uuid's for ubuntu and shuffle away
2010-03-26T08:26:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	winblows fault
2010-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	like i typed earlier..... it used to be that way..... maybe after service pack releases it was sorted...... been there.... done that.... never agin :).
2010-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	arunbabu	iflema	no
2010-03-26T08:31:00.000Z	arunbabu	iflema	can i backup the installed softwares in Ubuntu?
2010-03-26T08:31:00.000Z	arunbabu	iflema	so that I don't have to install them again .
2010-03-26T08:31:00.000Z	iflema	arunbabu	settings or packages or package selection
