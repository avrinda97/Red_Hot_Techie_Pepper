2005-10-06T16:56:00.000Z	Gorlist		Morning,
2005-10-06T16:56:00.000Z	Gorlist		just trying to compile Wine, using this tutorial - http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=29996&highlight=Installing+Wine
2005-10-06T16:56:00.000Z	Gorlist		When I try to run the compile command it comes up with - WINE Installer v0.75
2005-10-06T16:56:00.000Z	Gorlist		The source directory is not writable. You probably extracted the sources as root.
2005-10-06T16:56:00.000Z	Gorlist		You should remove the source tree and extract it again as a normal user.
2005-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	Gorlist		what does this mean?
2005-10-06T16:58:00.000Z	Gorlist		Qmario: ive done this before, but can't get a certain program running which I know is supported,
2005-10-06T16:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	probably what it says; did you extract the tarball as root? (and yes, try Wine from synaptic)
2005-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	does the wiki not have any info on wine?
2005-10-06T05:10:00.000Z	Gorlist	HappyFool	wiki says this - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToRunDVDShrinkWithWine?highlight=%28wine%29
2005-10-06T05:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	that page seems to recommend 'winetools' for setting up wine; however, I am not at all experienced with using wine. Try it and see
2005-10-06T05:14:00.000Z	Gorlist	HappyFool	at the moment is not liking the repostiry :(
2005-10-06T05:15:00.000Z	Gorlist	HappyFool	they recommend using wine cvs and compiling your own as it appears to work better - http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=29996&highlight=wine+cvs
2005-10-06T05:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	then redo it as a normal user
2005-10-06T05:16:00.000Z	Gorlist	HappyFool	I already am :)
2005-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	as root (or using sudo) you can use the chown command to change ownership of a directory (or directory tree)
2005-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	Gorlist	HappyFool	right thanks :)
2005-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	try 'sudo chown -R gorlist.gorlist '
2005-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	Gorlist	where 'gorlist' is your username
