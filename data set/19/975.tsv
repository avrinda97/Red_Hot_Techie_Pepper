2012-06-04T22:08:00.000Z	Dan39		trust me guys, ive tried working with her to use linux utilities
2012-06-04T22:08:00.000Z	Dan39		lol
2012-06-04T22:09:00.000Z	Dan39		ive been looking
2012-06-04T22:10:00.000Z	Dan39		and yes my support question is the same as hers
2012-06-04T22:10:00.000Z	Dan39		how to best do windows video encoding on a ubuntu 11.04 server
2012-06-04T22:10:00.000Z	Dan39		err
2012-06-04T22:10:00.000Z	Dan39		12.04
2012-06-04T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dan39	the server has no GUI so will be great if you can tame mencoder / ffmpeg
2012-06-04T22:11:00.000Z	Dan39	ActionParsnip	we have kde running :D
2012-06-04T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dan39	then its not server, its a desktop OS
2012-06-04T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dan39	why install server when you wanted a desktop OS?
2012-06-04T22:13:00.000Z	Dan39	ActionParsnip	its already done, why all the questions?
2012-06-04T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dan39	just curious, just seems like a roundabout way to get to the same end, rather than installing Kubuntu and doing it in one move
2012-06-04T22:14:00.000Z	Dan39	ActionParsnip	i agree
2012-06-04T22:14:00.000Z	Dan39	ActionParsnip	i wasnt sure if ovh had a desktop os image
2012-06-04T22:14:00.000Z	Dan39	ActionParsnip	now that i look i believe they did have 11.10 desktop, lesson learned
