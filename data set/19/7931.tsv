2009-05-31T10:57:00.000Z	sysadmin		is there any advantage/disadvantage on debian vs ubuntu?
2009-05-31T10:58:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	different repositories, some mind find one more suitable for a purpose than another
2009-05-31T10:58:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	are most of apps available in ubuntu available for debian as well?
2009-05-31T10:58:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	yes
2009-05-31T11:00:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	great. do you know if there are any aspects that I should be aware of before moving from ubuntu to debian?
2009-05-31T11:00:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	a lot less software is installed by default, and a lot less hardware is configred by default
2009-05-31T11:00:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	a lot less stuff "magically works"
2009-05-31T11:01:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	then I will stick to ubuntu :s. I wanna save myself some work. Now, I was thinking on moving to debian because there is a tutorial on encrypting a usb drive with debian. Is something similar for ubuntu?
2009-05-31T11:02:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	the procedure should be the same
2009-05-31T11:02:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	ok
2009-05-31T12:58:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	iwconfig
2009-05-31T12:58:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	yes, but how do I specify the network name?
2009-05-31T12:58:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	the ssid?
2009-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	it's essid (unless you are referring to the hardware bssid)
2009-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	ok, got it, and the password in hex?
2009-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	i think so, read the manpage
2009-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	if you are using wpa you'll need wpa-supplicant
2009-05-31T13:07:00.000Z	sysadmin	fryguy	when i set the essid, how can I set the password?
2009-05-31T13:07:00.000Z	fryguy	sysadmin	no idea
