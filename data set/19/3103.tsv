2009-11-12T01:35:00.000Z	rampage73		anyone help with mounting a filesystem?
2009-11-12T01:35:00.000Z	tiox	rampage73	Just access the filesystem and type your password in.
2009-11-12T01:36:00.000Z	tiox		That SHOULD do it anyway...
2009-11-12T01:36:00.000Z	rampage73	tiox	not a network filesystem but an internal sata drive that used to work in jaunty
2009-11-12T01:37:00.000Z	tiox		Ooooh... sorry, I'm a nub myself.
2009-11-12T01:37:00.000Z	tiox		:P
2009-11-12T01:37:00.000Z	rampage73	tiox	no problem we are all here to help and learn
2009-11-12T01:37:00.000Z	rampage73	tiox	at least i know people can see me!
2009-11-12T01:38:00.000Z	rampage73		question of the day: upgraded to karmic from jaunty and now cannot mount 2 separate sata hard drives which are 250 gb internal ext3 , fdisk -l shows them as /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc both have a 1 after them to represent the partition, when i try and mount either of them i get mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist
2009-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	tiox		Okay. I am going to make this as clear as can be. I had two kernels I can launch under GRUB, right? Last night I was asking about how to remove the older one to save some disk space and trim up my GRUB menu. What happened was, the next time I rebooted, I lost the capability to connect to the internet.
2009-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	tiox		I am on ubuntu 9.10, using the most recent kernel (*.15)
2009-11-12T01:41:00.000Z	tiox		Ugh... how do I go about doing that?
2009-11-12T01:41:00.000Z	tiox		I wish I knew that earlier... it was working while the old kernel was there.
2009-11-12T01:42:00.000Z	tiox		I want to explain something. I cannot access the internet. Period.
2009-11-12T01:42:00.000Z	tiox		Oh... nevermind.
2009-11-12T01:43:00.000Z	rampage73	tiox	i am sorry what are you trying to do?
2009-11-12T01:43:00.000Z	tiox		I just want my internet connection back on Ubuntu, that's all.
2009-11-12T01:43:00.000Z	tiox		I'll check that thing out and see fi I cannot configure things myself.
2009-11-12T01:44:00.000Z	rampage73	tiox	wifi or cable?
