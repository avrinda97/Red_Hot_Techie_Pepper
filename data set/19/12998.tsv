2005-10-10T07:06:00.000Z	dooglus		I downloaded a .deb file that was compiled for sarge, and I'm trying to install in on breezy.  It seems to be OK, apart from one dependancy...
2005-10-10T07:06:00.000Z	dooglus		It wants "libzipios++0c102", but I have "libzipios++0".  Can I tell dkpg not to worry, and install anyway?
2005-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	it won't work.
2005-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	whu?
2005-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	why?
2005-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	C++ API differences
2005-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	is there a debian version which has a binary compatible C++ interface with breezy?
2005-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	the sarge package is built with g++ 3, it won't work if your libraries are build with g++ 4
2005-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	the one in unstable.
2005-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	ok, thanks.
2005-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	isn't enigma in ubuntu universe, too?
2005-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	oh, wesnoth does use zipios, too? ;-) didn't know that.
2005-10-10T07:10:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	did you check universe?
2005-10-10T07:10:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	aye
2005-10-10T07:11:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	wesnoth released 1.0 recently
2005-10-10T07:12:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	yes, and it's in debian unstable, too. but that is not the version you were trying to install...
2005-10-10T07:13:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	debian unstable only has a release candidate?
2005-10-10T07:13:00.000Z	erich	dooglus	1.0 was uploaded the day before yesterday
2005-10-10T07:13:00.000Z	dooglus	erich	oh, ok.  thanks!  :)
