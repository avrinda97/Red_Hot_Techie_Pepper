2010-11-05T20:02:00.000Z	goltoof		is there a way to see progress when copying one dir to another with cli
2010-11-05T20:03:00.000Z	goltoof		I'm copying a huge directory to a backup drive... it's just been sitting there, i'm sure it's working but it'd be nice to see the progress, next time i do this
2010-11-05T20:03:00.000Z	goltoof		sorry didn't mean to flood
2010-11-05T20:04:00.000Z	goltoof		there's no extra option for the cp tool to show progress?
2010-11-05T20:05:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	cp -v will show you the files as it's copying
2010-11-05T20:12:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	With sudo, you only need to know your own password. With su, you need to password of the user you're trying to run commands as.
2010-11-13T00:53:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	When you yank lines in vim, they are stored in vim, not any type of system-wide clipboard
2010-11-13T00:53:00.000Z	goltoof	ks3	no way to yank lines to system clipboard then?
2010-11-13T00:54:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	There is, but the default yank doesn't. I believe it's +yy or *yy.
2010-11-13T00:54:00.000Z	goltoof	ks3	negative  :(
2010-11-13T00:55:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	Sorry, "+yy
2010-11-13T00:56:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	"+p will paste from the clipboard
2010-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	From within vim, do :help x11-selection for more information
2010-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	goltoof	ks3	 :S   not working for me..  when i his + it just jumps me somewhere, never says it yanked anything
2010-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	No, preface with ", so "+yy, the quote is needed
2010-11-13T00:58:00.000Z	goltoof	ks3	 i want to yank 30 lines... so 30"+yy   ?
2010-11-13T00:59:00.000Z	ks3	goltoof	Probably? Don't use the command much myself, so try it out. If not, perhaps "30+yy or similar.
2010-11-13T01:00:00.000Z	goltoof	ks3	 yea tried all different combos, still nada
