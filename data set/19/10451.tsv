2006-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	feryana		ok. thanks anyways :))
2006-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	you can opena  pdf in gimp and then write on it
2006-10-24T09:34:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	pdftk will join pdf's on the command line, I don't remember the exact syntax though
2007-02-12T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	how did you install unrar?
2007-02-12T07:03:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	from a tar.gz file, with make\
2007-02-12T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	uninstall that and use the repository version instead
2007-02-12T07:04:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	how do I do that?
2007-02-12T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	which part?
2007-02-12T07:06:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	both of them. Uninstall and the repository
2007-02-12T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	did you use "make install" to install?
2007-02-12T07:07:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	I think so, I think that I only typed make, because I don't have the install file
2007-02-12T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	erm ok, but you should install the native linux one probably
2007-02-12T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	do you still have the source directory where you compiled unrar?
2007-02-12T07:10:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	yeah
2007-02-12T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	try this command:  sudo make uninstall
2007-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	*** No rule to make target `uninstall'. Stop.
2007-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	ok, well you'll have to remove the files it installed manually
2007-02-12T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	feryana	if you're not sure how to proceed I can try to help in more detail at #ubuntu-classroom
2007-02-12T07:17:00.000Z	feryana	jrib	I really appreciate your help, but I must go in a couple of minutes and here are people who needs more help than me.  I'll try to reach you other day, thanks a lot!!
