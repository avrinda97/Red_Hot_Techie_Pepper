2007-04-07T10:01:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me		can anyone please tell me whats the command to convert vob file to avi ?
2007-04-07T10:01:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	you need mencoder
2007-04-07T10:02:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	what sort of AVI?
2007-04-07T10:02:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	you can do xvid
2007-04-07T10:03:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	I don't believe mencoder can do divx.
2007-04-07T10:03:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	if you want a nice frontend for ripping DVDs, you can install acidrip. If you want to do it from the commandline, I'll start reading the manfile.
2007-04-07T10:04:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	why not use acidrip then?
2007-04-07T10:04:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	I thought you wanted to do this from the command line...
2007-04-07T10:05:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	ah.
2007-04-07T10:06:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	I'll use acidrip to generate the command for you, and paste it here.
2007-04-07T10:07:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	that's 'cause it's not meant to be an encoding frontend for everything, just dvds
2007-04-07T10:07:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	do you want any scaling or cropping?
2007-04-07T10:10:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	I'm trying stuff now
2007-04-07T10:15:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	mencoder input.vob -o output.avi -oac mp3lame -lameopts abr:br=<AUDIORATE> -ovc xvid -xvidencopts bitrate=<VIDEORATE>
2007-04-07T10:15:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	replace input.vob, output.avi, and all the bitrates with what you want
2007-04-07T10:17:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	try different ones, let it run for 15 seconds, ctrl-c to stop it, then see what it looks like
2007-04-07T10:18:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	why are you encoding as xvid? If you're using it on a computer, I'd recommend h.264
2007-04-07T10:23:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	it's probably because it's a VOB
2007-04-07T10:23:00.000Z	cables	Thug-N-Me	I don't know how to deal with VOBs
