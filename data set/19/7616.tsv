2007-07-25T08:54:00.000Z	HHP22		Hey guys, this might be out of place but is there a way to hide the buddy window in pigin/gaim?
2007-07-25T08:55:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	close the window?
2007-07-25T08:55:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	or does that also close gaim for you?
2007-07-25T08:55:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	if so, then you need to find the option in the preferences menu that says 'show icon in tray' or something like that.
2007-07-25T08:55:00.000Z	HHP22	Music_Shuffle	Yes, that closes gaim completely.
2007-07-25T08:56:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	theres an option that keeps it from doing that, lemme see if I can find it.
2007-07-25T08:56:00.000Z	HHP22	Music_Shuffle	 Okay, Thanks :)
2007-07-25T08:57:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	open the Preferences menu; do you see a tab labeled as...Interface?
2007-07-25T08:58:00.000Z	HHP22	Music_Shuffle	I'm on Gaim, and no, no "interface"
2007-07-25T08:58:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	>_>....what tabs does it show you under Preferences?
2007-07-25T08:59:00.000Z	HHP22	Music_Shuffle	.. OH. The first tab it's on is interface. Wow. Smart one
2007-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	Yeah!  That one :P
2007-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	See the first option under it, that says...Show System Tray Icon?
2007-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	HHP22	Music_Shuffle	Set to always.. now I can close the buddy window?
2007-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	try it :)
2007-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	yay!  :D
2007-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	HHP22	Music_Shuffle	Thanks so much XD
2007-07-25T09:02:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	anytime :D
2007-07-25T09:10:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	HHP22	I think since he's using the server, he doesn't really -have- an X server :P
