2007-04-16T05:58:00.000Z	kingcobra		can somebody tell me what is wrong with that line that swap is not being mounted at bootup
2007-04-16T05:58:00.000Z	rasputnik	kingcobra	I guess the UUID? the rest looks ok.
2007-04-16T06:00:00.000Z	kingcobra	rasputnik	what should be there instead of the uuid thats there
2007-04-16T06:01:00.000Z	rasputnik	kingcobra	you can give it the physical device instead, if you know it? (e.g. /dev/sdaX)
2007-04-16T06:01:00.000Z	kingcobra	rasputnik	ok
2007-04-16T06:02:00.000Z	kingcobra	rasputnik	what is the the uuid for
2007-04-16T06:02:00.000Z	rasputnik	kingcobra	it's a way to recognize the same partition if you plugin the disk on a different bus
2007-04-16T06:03:00.000Z	rasputnik	kingcobra	/dev/sdaX is the Xth partition on scsi disk a, but UUID will be the same whatever  controller the disk is on
2007-04-16T06:03:00.000Z	kingcobra	rasputnik	very good
2007-04-16T06:04:00.000Z	kingcobra	rasputnik	i suppose i wont matter much cos i dont plan on movin it
2007-04-16T06:04:00.000Z	rasputnik	kingcobra	exactly. it became the default in edgy, i think.
2007-04-16T06:05:00.000Z	kingcobra	rasputnik	thanks for help bye now
