2009-05-31T00:58:00.000Z	xcv		trying to do reverse vnc, seems the support and procedure for that has changed with some releases. i'm running jaunty, 64bit, would like to do reverse vnc connections. what's the best practice for that currently?
2009-05-31T00:59:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	I'm not really sure what you mean by "reverse vnc"..explain it to me? please? =)
2009-05-31T00:59:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	i will be the vncviewer, but i want the remote to initiate the connection...
2009-05-31T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	ah.. like one of those.. I'll send you an executable file.. you run that and it will connect to my viewer?
2009-05-31T01:00:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	they would instruct their vnc server to add a new client and then enter my ip address
2009-05-31T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	ah.. that might work too.. yes
2009-05-31T01:01:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	similar, but vnc, tightvnc, ultravnc have support for this, seems vinagre does not
2009-05-31T01:02:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	i reviewed http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=299489&highlight=reverse+vnc
2009-05-31T01:02:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	in my experience vinagre is a really bare bones vnc implementation.. I would stick with one of the more mature ones.. tightvnc, ultravnc etc
2009-05-31T01:02:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	mm.. I'm already reading that thread =)
2009-05-31T01:03:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	and the others linked from there. I tried sudo apt-get install xvncviewer, got E: Package xvncviewer has no installation candidate
2009-05-31T01:04:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	have you tried xvnc4viewer?
2009-05-31T01:05:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	not yet. figured I'd check in here to see what the best practice for this is in Jaunty, before going on and installing anything i could find
2009-05-31T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	mm.. good plan.. I haven't used it myself on jaunty yet.. perhaps someone else has something good to recommend
2009-05-31T01:06:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	doing sudo apt-get install xvnc4viewer now. will let you know how it goes
2009-05-31T01:16:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	I can invoke xvnc4viewer in listen mode, but doesn't bind to the port I specify. However, that's another ball of wax. I'll fuss with it and see what happens. Thanks for the assist :)
2009-05-31T01:17:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	hmm.. hope you manage to bend it to your will =)
2009-05-31T01:22:00.000Z	xcv	Slart	success. the key is to not specify the port number. || rise@noon:~$ xvnc4viewer -listen ||  main:        Listening on port 5500 || =)
2009-05-31T01:23:00.000Z	Slart	xcv	oh.. that's almost zen-like.. stop trying and it will solve itself =)
