2006-11-22T12:52:00.000Z	Moose_		Good morning... anyone here know why 6.06LTS-x86_64 isn't seeing both cores on an Athlon 3800x2?
2006-11-22T12:52:00.000Z	Moose_		it's an SMP kernel.
2006-11-22T12:53:00.000Z	Moose_		2.6.15-23-amd64-generic #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue May 23 13:45:47 UTC 2006 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2006-11-22T12:53:00.000Z	Moose_		I'm looking at /proc/cpuinfo, I don't have graphic access to the machine yet.
2006-11-22T12:54:00.000Z	Moose_		I _suppose_ i can start a remote X session. :)
2006-11-22T12:54:00.000Z	Moose_		but I'm sitting on the end of a dialup connection at the moment.
2006-11-22T12:55:00.000Z	Moose_		Nope. not yet. :-)
2006-11-22T12:55:00.000Z	Moose_		I can go grab clean kernel source and build from scratch, that's not a problem to do, but if there's an easy ubuntu-esque fix i'd rather do that.
2006-11-22T12:56:00.000Z	Moose_		6.06LTS.
2006-11-22T12:56:00.000Z	Moose_		model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+
2006-11-22T12:57:00.000Z	ataq	Moose_	I think there is a mistake cos I have a similar cpu and I auto detected the two cores on the 64bit install also
2006-11-22T12:57:00.000Z	Moose_	ataq	hmmm ok. I can deal with it, doesn't mean i like it :-)
2006-11-22T12:58:00.000Z	ataq	Moose_	Well when I uname -a it says SMP #1 too, but when I look graphically it shows two cores!
2006-11-22T13:00:00.000Z	Moose_	ataq	tres weird, I've never seen /proc/cpuinfo report the wrong information before.
2006-11-22T13:01:00.000Z	ataq	Moose_	On my Fedora machine, I installed Core 6 and it set my Pentium D 820 as i586 single core.. ..  ..  joke
2006-11-22T13:02:00.000Z	ataq	Moose_	it was sickening
2006-11-22T13:02:00.000Z	Moose_	ataq	What's the kernel source package name for 6.06 LTS?
2006-11-22T13:03:00.000Z	ataq	Moose_	uname to get the kernel and is it .src at the end to get?
2006-11-22T13:03:00.000Z	Moose_	ataq	that works, let me try
