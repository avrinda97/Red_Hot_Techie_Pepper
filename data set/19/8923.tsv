2007-02-03T10:45:00.000Z	Vuen		hey guys, is anyone here familiar with binchunker?
2007-02-03T10:46:00.000Z	Vuen		i'm having some trouble converting a .bin/.cue to a .iso
2007-02-03T10:47:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 you could use file-roller or Xarchiver to extract the contents of the .bin file .. and then create the .iso from the extracted files
2007-02-03T10:49:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	the problem is the cd contains audio tracks. when binchunker converts it, intead of making one .iso, it makes a .iso and a bunch of .cdr tracks. i can't mount this.
2007-02-03T10:50:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	is there a way i can mount this cd with the audio tracks?
2007-02-03T10:51:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 errm, i'm not familiar with .binchunker or that approach -- i tend to find that ripping the audio CD works best
2007-02-03T10:51:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	i don't want the audio tracks to be separate
2007-02-03T10:52:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 it's definitely possible to rip the CD as one whole long track (although i dont know specifically how it is done)
2007-02-07T10:07:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 if [ -e file ] ; then echo exits; fi
2007-02-07T10:30:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 if you are so worried about Intellectual Property -- why paste your work on a public forum -- there's no way to enforce action now however unfortunate that is
2007-02-07T10:31:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	soundray: yeah, i know it's not a big deal. i'm just a little sore is all.
2007-02-07T10:32:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 well, i dont think you should be -- it's trivial -- if i were you i'd be happy someone else is happy with a bad conscience :)
2007-02-07T12:01:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 any plain-text editor will do
2007-02-07T12:02:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 you want to edit a xml file from a script?
2007-02-07T12:02:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	yeah
2007-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	 why not get the script to create the xml file --  a contrived example - echo "<xml> .. </xml>" > xml-file.xml
2007-02-07T12:04:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	unfortunately it's an xml file that already exists.
2007-02-07T12:04:00.000Z	Vuen	unop	i'm going to look into editing it with sed.
2007-02-07T12:04:00.000Z	unop	Vuen	yes, if "changing" the contents of the file is what you are after
