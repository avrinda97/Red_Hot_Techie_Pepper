2008-10-04T23:51:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	EvilDaemon: to determine the dependencies it's easier to do "apt-cache depends <package>
2008-10-04T23:51:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	I don't have internet on my ubuntu pc, I only have internet on windows.
2008-10-04T23:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	Could you run Ubuntu in a VM on Windows?
2008-10-04T23:52:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	not really
2008-10-04T23:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	How about booting to the Live CD?
2008-10-04T23:53:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	yes. But I don't want compizconfig-settings manager installed on live cd, but on my ubuntu pc
2008-10-04T23:54:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	is there some windows program like "download all .deb needed to install package xy"? Then I could copy them on a usb drive and to ubuntu pc
2008-10-04T23:54:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	If you had Ubuntu running you can also download all the required packages without installing them using "apt-get --download-only install <package>"
2008-10-04T23:54:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	Hmmm, sounds like you need someone else to get the list of packages for you
2008-10-04T23:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	what package do you want to install? and what version of Ubuntu is on the other PC?
2008-10-04T23:55:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	yes, that would work. (I can run a live cd on a computer that is in the internet).
2008-10-04T23:55:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-10-04T23:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	hang on
2008-10-05T00:00:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	you still there?
2008-10-05T00:00:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	On the Ubuntu PC, can you run this command to see what it *thinks* it needs? "sudo apt-get -d --reinstall install compizconfig-settings-manager" - this will tell you precisely which packages it needs to fetch, as opposed to what it has
2008-10-05T00:02:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	and then I have to download those package .deb? ok.
2008-10-05T00:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	yes
2008-10-05T00:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	homy	I think you will only need CCSM and python-compizconfig
2008-10-05T00:03:00.000Z	homy	IntuitiveNipple	ok, I'll try that first.
