2007-11-05T23:06:00.000Z	ochosi		hi, for some reason emerald doesn't show up in my package manager, i'm running gutsy with all repos (incl. multiverse, universe, restricted) enabled. shouldn't it be there?
2007-11-05T23:08:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 emerald is in universe.  Perhaps your source for universe is not complete?
2007-11-05T23:08:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	hm. strange. i didn't do any manual changes to my software sources. it's the same since i upgraded
2007-11-05T23:09:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	anyway, how could i check whether it's "complete"?
2007-11-05T23:10:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 You could browse the http URL listed in /etc/apt/sources.list.
2007-11-05T23:10:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 apt-cache tells me there is a pool/universe/e/emerald directory
2007-11-05T23:15:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	alright, had a look at my sources.list, but nothing strange about it.
2007-11-05T23:16:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 What does 'apt-get update; apt-cache show emerald' report?
2007-11-05T23:18:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	strange, apt-cache show emerald shows the package
2007-11-05T23:18:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 What does "apt-get emerald" report? ;-)
2007-11-05T23:19:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 "apt-get install emerald", actually
2007-11-05T23:20:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	i'll try to replace my sources.list with a friend's
2007-11-05T23:21:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	for him everything seems to be working fine
2007-11-05T23:21:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 Are you using some unusual architecture that may be missing from the pool?
2007-11-05T23:21:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	like what?
2007-11-05T23:22:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 what does "uname -r" say?
2007-11-05T23:22:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	2.6.22-14-generic
2007-11-05T23:24:00.000Z	stroyan	ochosi	 That seems very mainstream....
2007-11-05T23:24:00.000Z	ochosi	stroyan	it is :)
