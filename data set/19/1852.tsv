2010-09-20T01:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	what exactly do you want to install
2010-09-20T01:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	please be exact
2010-09-20T01:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	please be exact, a.) what do you want to install b.) why are you not using the ubuntu tools
2010-09-20T01:33:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	because apt-get just coredumps.
2010-09-20T01:33:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	no useful backtrace. I already deleted the *.bin in the cache dir
2010-09-20T01:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	ok - that's a serious issue, using dpkg isn't th eanswer
2010-09-20T01:34:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	what is the answer?
2010-09-20T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	resolve the issue, has this ever worked, or did it stop working
2010-09-20T01:35:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	suddeny stopped working. the update manager icon just went to a red stop sign, and neither apt-get nor synaptics start. synaptics has missing symbols in libept, apt-get just coredumps.
2010-09-20T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	ok - so what's changed
2010-09-20T01:40:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	i never ran anything but the automatic updates; sometimes installed additional packages; I didn't track what changed with them.
2010-09-20T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	any external repos ?
2010-09-20T01:42:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	/etc/apt/sources.list only contains ubuntu servers.
2010-09-20T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	unstable/proposed repos ?
2010-09-20T01:43:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	no
2010-09-20T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	what does the stack trace suggest is the issue ?
2010-09-20T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Gefflon	download apt from the web repos', do dpkg -i $filename
2010-09-20T01:44:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	(gdb) bt
2010-09-20T01:49:00.000Z	Gefflon	ikonia	after reinstalling apt and gsynaptics, apt-get and synaptisc now work again. thanks for the help!
