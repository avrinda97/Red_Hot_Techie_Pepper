2005-11-20T14:52:00.000Z	ganhongsen		sorry
2005-11-20T14:53:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	please read the /topic when you enter channels, please (and no more pasting)
2005-11-20T14:56:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	if nobody knows what you ask, nobody knows
2005-11-20T15:05:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	did you install thunderbird from the repos?
2005-11-20T15:06:00.000Z	ganhongsen	nalioth	What is repos? I downloaded and installing it through terminal, from what I read at thunderbird's website
2005-11-20T15:06:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	please dont do that.
2005-11-20T15:07:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	we have over 17,000 pkgs for you to use
2005-11-20T15:07:00.000Z	ganhongsen	nalioth	don't install thunderbird?
2005-11-20T15:07:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	using non ubuntu packages is not good for the health of your ubuntu
2005-11-20T15:08:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	use the repos (in fact, i think thunderbird is default in ubuntu)
2005-11-20T15:08:00.000Z	ganhongsen	nalioth	oh i see...
2005-11-20T15:08:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	read what ubotu sent you in a priv msg, and enable universe and multiverse repos
2005-11-20T15:10:00.000Z	nalioth	ganhongsen	i suspect if you look in the internet menu, you'll see thunderbird. if not, you can use synaptic and install it easily
