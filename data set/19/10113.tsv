2009-07-18T05:52:00.000Z	vprm		how much disk space do i need for ubuntu??
2009-07-18T05:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	yep good idea not to use Wubi, bad things can happen
2009-07-18T05:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	or do like 12GB for / the operating system partition   and  resonably  big seperate home.  only thing with that is you would have to set up the partitions yourself,  because  the guided installs won't do such set ups
2009-07-18T05:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	8.10 or 9.04
2009-07-18T06:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	8.10 is better than 9.04 in certain ways,  just like in one or two ways 9.04 is better than 8.10
2009-07-18T06:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	9.10  is the next one released at the end of  October,  and most current Ubuntu users should be clean installing that one really
2009-07-18T06:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	which version of Windows?
2009-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	9.04  is a bit pointless really  unless  people are doing the optional  Ext4  file system,  and  that's not really  the best thing to recommend to new users  in 9.04 for various reasons.   And without 8.10 is really the better release,  just most users don't know that.
2009-07-18T06:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	and yes you can use gparted on the Live CD to resize the Windows partition, that normalley works without a problem, but that slight chance of dataloss, so good to have your data backed up from XP first

2009-07-18T06:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	I see you been using a Windows program for  navigating the boat?
2009-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	ok  so you got Windows programs that you want to run inside Ubuntu?
2009-07-18T06:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	there's a program called  Wine which can get  a lot of Windows programs working,  but a lot need configuring, also I have a feeling  you won't have much luck with whatever you want to run
2009-07-18T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	ok get it installed and here's a website for you http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com
2009-07-18T06:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	learn Ubuntu there isn't really  much to learn, except the basic stuff,   unless your going to do something more advanced
2009-07-18T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	ok well  Ubuntu shoudn't be that big of a deal then
2009-07-18T06:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vprm	well   there isn't really any proper  Windows community support, as far as I know
