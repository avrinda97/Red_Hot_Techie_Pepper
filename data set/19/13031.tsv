2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		oh jesus
2006-06-13T11:46:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		the xml file is one big line
2006-06-13T11:46:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		and i can't scroll down in vim
2006-06-13T11:46:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		ok, I'm going to download the Vista beta
2006-06-13T11:46:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		this sucks
2006-06-13T11:46:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		I have, when i opened the file nothing was there
2006-06-13T11:47:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		Flannel - it was saved by openoffice
2006-06-13T11:47:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		I think its to save space
2006-06-13T11:47:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		but really it makes it un-human editable
2006-06-13T11:47:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		probably what screwed up gedit, its one big ass line
2006-06-13T11:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	there are editors that'll visually break a long line so it doesn't run off the screen - Bluefish, for example
2006-06-13T11:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	what was this 65k/single line file created in?
2006-06-13T11:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	ah... I'm not sure OOo files are really designed to be unpacked :|
2006-06-13T11:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	ouch... do you know what's breaking?
2006-06-13T11:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	search & replace will work even if it's one giant messy line
2006-06-13T11:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	not sure, I use nano when I can't use gedit, myself
2006-06-13T11:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	nano has basic commands listed along the bottom of the screen all the time - much more sensible :)
2006-06-13T12:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	what happens when you save the PPT back as an OOo format?
2006-06-13T12:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bot_Builde1	might want to file a bug w/ OOo, and (if you can) include the file that broke
