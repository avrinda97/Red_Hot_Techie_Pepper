2012-11-15T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	Bier_	no
2012-11-15T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	Bier_	apt-get update just refreshes your package cache (information about packages that are available) with the servers
2012-11-15T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	Bier_	like magic...
2012-11-15T00:23:00.000Z	Bier_	jrib	THANKS :D it's installed! i was trying for hours last time and you fixed it so fast :)

2012-11-15T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	Bier_	just any directory you want (and have write permission to).  You can create a new directory if you wish and use that
