2007-09-27T16:10:00.000Z	amadeux		I really like K3B. Is there a comparable gnome alternative?
2007-09-27T05:12:00.000Z	amadeux		What is the easiest way for me to upgrade from Ubuntus ancient gaim to a newer (newest?) pidgin?
2007-09-27T05:12:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	install the latest version of ubuntu (gutsy, when it is released)
2007-09-27T05:12:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	but I don't want to wait until it is released!
2007-09-27T05:13:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	well, you can upgrade now but it is still in development and should not be used unless you don't mind the chance of your computer not booting
2007-09-27T05:13:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	you can also compile it from soruce
2007-09-27T05:14:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	I just want pidgin :(
2007-09-27T05:14:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	all that has changed is the name.. and a few other small features.
2007-09-27T05:14:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	gutsy comes out in a month
2007-09-27T05:14:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	it's fairly stable right now though, you _probably_ wouldn't have any major issues if you upgraded
2007-09-27T05:15:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	can't I just download the gutsy pidgin package?
2007-09-27T05:15:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	and will it use my settings from my .gaim?
2007-09-27T05:15:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	that is not reccomended but it might work
2007-09-27T05:15:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	no idea about the settings
2007-09-27T05:16:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	it depends how much has changed, it's not hard to log in again though.. it imports your buddy list from the net anyway so ther eis not much to configure
2007-09-27T05:33:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	and also, I hate the ubuntu dogma that you have to sudo everything. No way I am going to sudo 10 lines in a row. Much easier just to become root
2007-09-27T05:29:00.000Z	variant	amadeux	actually, if you want to become root, use "sudo -i"
2007-09-27T05:32:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	why is sudo -i better?
2007-09-27T05:38:00.000Z	amadeux	variant	why is sudo -i better?
