2007-10-13T09:50:00.000Z	jauchter	saftle	the command is telling the machine which X server you want to use, and run the application on
2007-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	well display=:0 works at first and then freezes, =:93 is really laggy, any others I can try?
2007-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	jauchter	saftle	im late in the conversation
2007-10-13T09:52:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	trying to run 3D acceleration apps in xgl due to my ati x1650 not supporting beryl in any other xserver except for xgl.
2007-10-13T09:56:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	it was sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl
2007-10-13T09:56:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	going to attempt a remove
2007-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	jauchter	saftle	unless something has changed for gusty (that could be come to think of it), it only installs the server, there are still steps that need to be taken for the xgl server to actually be started, and in my experience (2 machines where X had to be fixed from the command prompt on ATI cards), a different session at startup through gdm is going to save you a lot of hassel
2007-10-13T09:59:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	take a look at this app and tell me if this is what I should do.
2007-10-13T09:59:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	not app sorry, meant tutorial http://ubuntu1501.blogspot.com/2007/08/compiz-fusion-in-fiesty-with-xgl.html
2007-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	jauchter	saftle	yup
2007-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	but once I did the apt-get portion, gutsy notified me that I no longer have to make a seperate xserver boot option or whatever it's called. anyway to go around that you think?
2007-10-13T10:01:00.000Z	jauchter	saftle	I think thats because they tried to turn it on by default, but, as great as unbuntu is, I think we are going to see a couple 'upgrades' before thats working cleanly
2007-10-13T10:02:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	yeah, this was what it did before the 10ths upgrades. just got the upgrades today, maybe that might change it. I'll go ahead and try this out and come back if I have any problems, thx for the help so far.
2007-10-13T10:02:00.000Z	jauchter	saftle	np
2007-10-13T10:10:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	k, you are, awesome, well, how do I find out whether my current session is xgl or not?
2007-10-13T10:18:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	still there dude?
2007-10-13T10:27:00.000Z	saftle	jauchter	you there?
