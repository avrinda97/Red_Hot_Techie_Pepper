2009-09-27T20:36:00.000Z	unimatrix		why is firefox using up my CPU even when i'm not using it? it doesn't do this on windows
2009-09-27T20:37:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	: What makes you think its firefox
2009-09-27T20:37:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	top?
2009-09-27T20:38:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	: huh
2009-09-27T20:38:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	it's eating up ~6% when idling
2009-09-27T20:39:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	: Which version
2009-09-27T20:39:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	every 3.x basically
2009-09-27T20:39:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	can't remember if it was like that on 2.x but probably yes
2009-09-27T20:39:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	 : No which one is it that you are using now
2009-09-27T20:40:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	3.5.5
2009-09-27T20:40:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	3.5.3*
2009-09-27T20:43:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	: Well you could try deleting your .mozilla , and reinstalling it again . But you would lose your information (such as bookarks , history etc)
2009-09-27T20:43:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	TheCheeze: when I close the GMail tab the usage drops to ~1%
2009-09-27T20:43:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	TheCheeze: which is still too much, but a lot better
2009-09-27T20:44:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	; Probably you did something wrong . Deleting the hidden file .mozilla in your home folder might solve it ( to unhide it just press cntrl+h)
2009-09-27T20:45:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	i wonder why i didn't do anything wrong on windows... *sigh* i'll try it anyway
2009-09-27T20:47:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	tried with a fresh .mozilla folder now... it's the same
2009-09-27T20:48:00.000Z	Blizzerand	unimatrix	: Not sure what causes it . Probably has to do something linux , not sure though , try #firefox . they have more support
2009-09-27T20:48:00.000Z	unimatrix	Blizzerand	it's probably Xorg sucking, but i'll try that, thanks
