2010-03-11T02:30:00.000Z	voicesinmyhead	iceroot	apt get
2010-03-11T02:30:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	fix your hardware!!
2010-03-11T02:31:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	i told you 10 times, you pc will even crash with xfce4
2010-03-11T02:32:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	/var/cache/apt/archives
2010-03-11T02:32:00.000Z	voicesinmyhead	iceroot	i used apt get.. it downloaded packages for xfce.. but it got shutdown during install... where can i find the xfce to install since it is already dwnloaded...plus... now i see two terminals under applications... one is the normal .. and the other shows terminal emulator..whats dat?
2010-03-11T02:32:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	also you want xubuntu-desktop and not xfce4
2010-03-11T02:33:00.000Z	voicesinmyhead	iceroot	it sasys /var/cache/apt/archives is a directory in shells.. how do i install it from shells? what commands??
2010-03-11T02:34:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop    should use the already cached packages, restwill be downloaded
2010-03-11T02:35:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	and i promise your pc will crash with xfce4 or even only cli, because if you start a program its using the cpu and because of the broken fan, the pc will crash
2010-03-11T02:35:00.000Z	iceroot	voicesinmyhead	so dont waste your time with installing xfce4 or other stuff
2010-03-11T02:38:00.000Z	voicesinmyhead	iceroot	 can i manually clean fan myself? or send laptop to manufacturer?
