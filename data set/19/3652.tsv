2009-06-21T21:32:00.000Z	sanspeaker567		I installed ubuntu, and get's can't connect to the wireless networks (secured and unsecured)
2009-06-21T21:32:00.000Z	sanspeaker567		I see them
2009-06-21T21:32:00.000Z	sanspeaker567		just when I connect to them, it doesn't
2009-06-21T21:32:00.000Z	sanspeaker567		any ideas?
2009-06-21T21:33:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	here's an idea: explain your problem in one single sentence / without hitting the return key 5 times, much more readable that way.
2009-06-21T21:41:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	seems like an issue with your network driver, check what driver you're running and ask in their support channel
2009-06-21T21:42:00.000Z	sanspeaker567	crashanddie	when installing it found my driver and installed it.  Because I can see the wireless networks, would that mean that my card is working (at least partially?)
2009-06-21T21:43:00.000Z	sanspeaker567	crashanddie	the driver actually comes with ubuntu 9, from what I understand.
2009-06-21T21:48:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	yes, it is working, it's just having a hard time connecting -- not sure anyone in here knows enough about your card to be able to help you, try dmesg to see if you get any messages there
2009-06-21T21:49:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	even though the driver shipped with Ubuntu, Ubuntu didn't create it.
2009-06-21T21:50:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	check which driver you are running, and write it down, we will try to get you some support
2009-06-21T21:50:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	no network cable?
2009-06-21T21:51:00.000Z	sanspeaker567	crashanddie	not right now, I can try to work that out.  Is there a specific command to get the driver details that are being used?
2009-06-21T21:51:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	lsmod
2009-06-21T21:51:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	and dmesg
2009-06-21T21:52:00.000Z	sanspeaker567	crashanddie	okay.  I am also using a router, does that impact anything?
2009-06-21T21:52:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	nope
2009-06-21T21:53:00.000Z	sanspeaker567	crashanddie	thks for your help, I'll give this a try.
2009-06-21T21:53:00.000Z	crashanddie	sanspeaker567	good luck :)
