2012-10-05T02:34:00.000Z	morbid		I am having an issue getting my old compaq persario laptop to work wirelessly.  I hooked it up to the cat5 in order to install the propriatary driver it offered...but it still does not work.  The unit has a button to engage the wireless...and it is not functioning
2012-10-05T02:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	are you dual-booting?
2012-10-05T02:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	enable it in windows then reboot to ubuntu
2012-10-05T03:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	see "/msg ubottu tab", typing z - y - k - o - t - i - c - k - 9 is a MAJOR pain, you don't have to.  FYI you didn't even highlight me ;)
2012-10-05T03:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	but no suggestions or wireless no.
2012-10-05T03:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	actually use "tab" "tab" until you get the nick you want.  or "zyk<tab>" type thing.
2012-10-05T03:18:00.000Z	morbid	zykotick9	better?
2012-10-05T03:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	;) nice!
2012-10-05T03:18:00.000Z	morbid	zykotick9	So, no more information on wireless?
2012-10-05T03:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	what card, was issue.
2012-10-05T03:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	sorry. i scrolled back.
2012-10-05T03:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	so does N-M see network now?
2012-10-05T03:20:00.000Z	morbid	zykotick9	It just will not allow me to see the wireless connections.  I tried rebooting back into windows and enabling it...which got the blue light going when i came back...but still no wireless.
2012-10-05T03:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	means nothing.
2012-10-05T03:22:00.000Z	morbid	zykotick9	What does?
2012-10-05T03:22:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	what card is it try "lspci | grep -i wireless" and/or "lspci | grep -i network" and paste ONLY your wireless hardware, should be 1 line.
2012-10-05T03:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	using an earlier version of ubuntu and hardware working, now it doesn't.
2012-10-05T03:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	morbid	use lsusb if above doesn't work.
