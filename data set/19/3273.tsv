2010-05-04T21:22:00.000Z	netbook		Hi, I get an brasero error when burning the Ubuntu 10.04 AMD64 Desktop image: http://pastebin.com/wc1jUkGz What is the problem?
2010-05-04T21:23:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	Problem is that Brasero is friggin' buggy. Use gnomebaker.
2010-05-04T21:23:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	is this error common?
2010-05-04T21:23:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	Well happened to me :D
2010-05-04T21:23:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	heh ok all i needed to know
2010-05-04T21:28:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	Back... I can't figure out how to do a straight copy with gnomebaker
2010-05-04T21:28:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	I don't want to make a data cd, i want to burn image to disc
2010-05-04T21:28:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	Let me take a quick look
2010-05-04T21:29:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	The "Tools" menu
2010-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	thanks
2010-05-04T21:35:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	I had same error with gnomebake actually... "wodim cannot fixate disk"
2010-05-04T21:36:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	Hm.
2010-05-04T21:36:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	Is the image file fine?
2010-05-04T21:36:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	I'll check, I got it from http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu/10.04/
2010-05-04T21:36:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	I'll dl another copy from another place
2010-05-04T21:39:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	gnomebaker and brasero both use wodim
2010-05-04T21:40:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	No idea who wodim is, actually.
2010-05-04T21:40:00.000Z	theadmin	netbook	Altough no, I have a brief understanding but not much
2010-05-04T21:41:00.000Z	netbook	theadmin	it is the program that does the actual writing to disc http://man.cx/wodim%281%29
