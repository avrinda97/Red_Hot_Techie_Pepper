2008-01-13T12:41:00.000Z	bkar		ere4si-> would I be able to modify the last mbr written within grub> like  root hd0,1  and then setup hd0,1  ?
2008-01-13T12:42:00.000Z	bkar		ere4si-> maybe time to update your knowhow, want to try this "setup" within grub prompt?
2008-01-13T12:43:00.000Z	bkar		ere4si-> yes, correct, but grub can be re-installed into mbr right?
2008-01-13T12:44:00.000Z	bkar		like that command grub-install  ?
2008-01-13T12:45:00.000Z	todd_	bkar	grub is a 2 part thing... you can have another bootloader load grub (that would be the mbr), or grub can also be used as a bootloader (then it would be the mbr)... grub, and grub mbr are 2 seperate things
2008-01-13T12:46:00.000Z	todd_		could someone with smb knowledge look at http://pastebin.com/m2d437388 for me... especially [public]
2008-01-13T12:47:00.000Z	bkar		todd_-> okay, i know its a 2 part thing, its complaining that it cant find the correct stage1.5, so i need to update whatever is in the mbr with the correct stage 1.5
2008-01-13T12:48:00.000Z	todd_	bkar	installing grub, just installs the application, you need to rewrite your mbr with the grub mbr
2008-01-13T12:48:00.000Z	todd_		bakar: sorry, i'm not a grub expert, do know a bit about the mbr though
2008-01-13T12:48:00.000Z	bkar		todd_-> and is that done via  grub-install command?
2008-01-13T12:49:00.000Z	todd_	bkar	Dont know did you read man grub?
2008-01-13T12:49:00.000Z	bkar		todd_-> yes, its just unclear on this part about using grub-instal
2008-01-13T12:49:00.000Z	bkar		l
2008-01-13T12:50:00.000Z	todd_	bkar	you could also install ubuntu, only exit after the actual install starts, should work... how i did it
2008-01-13T12:51:00.000Z	bkar	bluefoxx	 update-alternatives config java
2008-01-13T12:51:00.000Z	todd_		bakar: if you'd like another way, WhuutdupNumba2 has ideas for you
