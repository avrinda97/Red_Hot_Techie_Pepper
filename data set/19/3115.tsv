2009-10-24T16:55:00.000Z	SunlessHalo		please, will anyone advise me how to relaunch sound on Intel HDA if it just crashed?
2009-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 you could try 'sudo service alsa restart'
2009-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	alsa: unrecognized service
2009-10-24T17:04:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	didn't help, "unrecognized service"
2009-10-25T15:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	put a proper entry for it in the /etc/fstab file with the right options
2009-10-25T15:40:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	i haven't allowed mounting it yet, nor during the install.. also, there's no entry about the partition yet
2009-10-25T16:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 You havent even bothered to add an entry to fstab yet. :)
2009-10-25T16:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 somthing like  /dev/sda1  /win  vfat  .... like the other line in your fstab shows
2009-10-25T16:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 and /win HAS to exist befor  you mount it.
2009-10-25T16:32:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	what is the UUID i have to use?
2009-10-25T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 you dont have to use the UUID but you can
2009-10-25T16:41:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	what should I enter for options, dump and pass?
2009-10-25T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 same as the other line you got for the  other windows partition
2009-10-25T16:43:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	but my intention is to mount it as read-only
2009-10-25T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 then you use some different options, 'ro' perhaps..  for read only
2009-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	 the vfat mount options are documented in the fstab and mount man pages i recall
2009-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	tell me the command pls, I'll try to find out
2009-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SunlessHalo	  man fstab  :)
2009-10-25T17:50:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Dr_Willis	thanks for help.
