2005-08-13T06:40:00.000Z	keith	logical_mark	 i suggest you use rythm box to upload to your ipod
2005-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	keith	logical_mark	and i suggest you anti-drm your itunes music first
2005-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	logical_mark		well I dont have an Ipod
2005-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	keith	logical_mark	otherwise it wouldn't mark

2005-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	logical_mark		I just have a crap load of music so and itunes organizes it so well and search is great
2005-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	keith		did you buy it from itunes logical?
2005-08-13T06:42:00.000Z	keith		cause if you did and dont anti-drm , you cant play that music on linux.
2005-08-13T06:42:00.000Z	logical_mark	keith	no I didnt buy it from itunes
2005-08-13T06:42:00.000Z	keith		ah you're fine then logical
