2005-07-18T09:16:00.000Z	edamron		I'm trying to setup a SSH server.  I can connect from within my home network but no one can connect from the outside.  I have port 22 forwarded to my server so that's not the problem.
2005-07-18T09:16:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	if you can't connect from outside, but can inside, then the problem is with your firewall
2005-07-18T09:17:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	but it's not.  I was running Mandrake and it worked. It stopped when I switched.
2005-07-18T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	this is on the ip you'r irc'ing from?
2005-07-18T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	and it indeed works
2005-07-18T09:18:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	no My server has a fixed IP 192.168.1.5 and I forward port 22 from my router switch.
2005-07-18T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	192.168.1.5 is not your external ip
2005-07-18T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	if you're irc'ing from behind the same firewall as you're trying to configure, ssh is working fine; I can connect to your ssh daemon quite happily
2005-07-18T09:19:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	no, my linksys router is connected to my cable modem.  I can find my IP if you want it.
2005-07-18T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	ok...
2005-07-18T09:21:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	I gave you some bad info.  I do have it forwarded to this computer right now.  My IP is 67.168.4.197
2005-07-18T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	which also works fine
2005-07-18T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	you're running openssh version 3.9p1
2005-07-18T09:22:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	Am I?  I don't know.  Whatever installed with Ubuntu 5.04
2005-07-18T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	anyway, ssh is working fine for you, I can ssh to your (presumably) internal machine
2005-07-18T09:23:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	really?  A friend of mind can't... Maybe it's on his end.
2005-07-18T09:23:00.000Z	bob2	edamron	I'd say so
2005-07-18T09:24:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	I just discovered Ubuntu a few days ago.  It's REALLY stable.
2005-07-18T09:25:00.000Z	edamron	bob2	Thanks Bob.  I'll get ahold of my friend and have him try again.
