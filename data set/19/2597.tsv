2010-03-13T14:19:00.000Z	LincoN^		ok ty
2010-03-13T14:19:00.000Z	LincoN^		ill try
2010-03-13T14:20:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	make a directory. Then sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso /path/for/iso
2010-03-13T14:25:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	if there is a space in the mounted drive, you have to escape it.
2010-03-13T14:25:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	I'll give you a fixed post.
2010-03-13T14:26:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	http://pastebin.com/VmaweZm2
2010-03-13T14:27:00.000Z	LincoN^	SpaceGhostC2C	results in http://pastebin.com/wg1cfdB1
2010-03-13T14:29:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	look again and copy it better.
2010-03-13T14:31:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	http://pastebin.com/J1zigyHd Try that one.
2010-03-13T14:32:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	then you put the path in incorrectly. hmm.
2010-03-13T14:32:00.000Z	LincoN^	SpaceGhostC2C	i copied the line at the top of the "explorer"
2010-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	your path is broken.
2010-03-13T14:38:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	here's an idea.
2010-03-13T14:40:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	http://pastebin.com/ayGsakJx
2010-03-13T14:41:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	it's mounted.
2010-03-13T14:45:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	here's a pro-tip: don't try to use windows apps in linux, it's silly. We have a lot to use that you might love.
2010-03-13T14:46:00.000Z	LincoN^	SpaceGhostC2C	really? i just had this game file on the disk and i had nothing to do so i try to install it :)
2010-03-13T14:48:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	LincoN^	it's not a linux app, so I would say not to use it in linux. I wouldn't suggest using it, but if you want to use winedb to check if they got it working first.
