2010-07-31T19:07:00.000Z	dshbusiness		Hello everyone. Please help me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2010-07-31T19:08:00.000Z	dshbusiness		At first I installed ubuntu 10.04
2010-07-31T19:08:00.000Z	dshbusiness		I encrpted my /home
2010-07-31T19:08:00.000Z	dshbusiness		However, now, when I reinstalled OS. I just can't visit my home
2010-07-31T19:08:00.000Z	dshbusiness		Can someone tell me how to deal with this situation?
2010-07-31T19:09:00.000Z	dshbusiness		But now, How can I rescue my data?
2010-07-31T19:11:00.000Z	ohir	dshbusiness	unless you have your home partition backuped bit by bit (with dd) you have lost this data
2010-07-31T19:12:00.000Z	ohir	dshbusiness	encryption is exactly for that - so anyone, including you, can not acces data if one has no key
2010-07-31T19:15:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	I think I know the password if I have set it.
2010-07-31T19:16:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	but what should I do?
2010-07-31T19:16:00.000Z	ohir	dshbusiness	so you have a key :)
2010-07-31T19:17:00.000Z	ohir	dshbusiness	follow HOWTO you have been given. (Manual mount)
2010-07-31T19:17:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	Thanks, I will try it.
2010-07-31T19:19:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	well... Something is different... When I created that partition, my system is ubuntu. But now, it is fedora. Must I install a ubuntu again?
2010-07-31T19:20:00.000Z	ohir	dshbusiness	I do not know fedora enough to give you answer. In theory they should use same techniqe as ubuntu does.
2010-07-31T19:21:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	Thank you. Let me try.
2010-07-31T19:21:00.000Z	ohir	dshbusiness	find similar HOWTO in fedora docs and compare by self.
2010-07-31T19:22:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	OK
2010-07-31T20:30:00.000Z	dshbusiness	ohir	I have mount my /home successfully. Thank you very much!
