2012-10-01T11:39:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	alright
2012-10-03T13:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	upgrade to 11.11 then to 12.04
2012-10-03T13:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	11.10
2012-10-03T13:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	nope.
2012-10-03T13:35:00.000Z	Martell	cfhowlett	so how long 11.04 will be supported? is it ended this month?
2012-10-03T13:36:00.000Z	Martell	cfhowlett	: so if the support is stopped, i can't update it manually?
2012-10-03T13:37:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	eol means eol.  NOt sure what kind of updates you would expect at that point.  Might I gently suggest you bite the bullet and upgrade to LTS releases?  12.04 is supported for 5 years ...
2012-10-03T13:39:00.000Z	Martell	cfhowlett	: so i need to upgrade to 11.10 and then ugprade again to 12.04
2012-10-03T13:40:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	yep.  or clean install 12.04.  I recommend clean install then you can upgrade LTS to LTS.
2012-10-05T11:39:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	you'll need to restore grub to get ubuntu booted
2012-10-05T11:42:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	yes
2012-10-05T11:45:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Martell	you can make 4 PRIMARY parts.  You can make unlimited(?) logical parts.
