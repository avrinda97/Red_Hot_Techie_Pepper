2008-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	you have a program of the name 1, and you're trying to start it with ./program?
2008-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	sorry, i renamed the program to 1, and i also start with 1
2008-05-20T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	your program must be trying to call another program that doesn't exist.
2008-05-20T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	is it a script?
2008-05-20T15:16:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	its a propietary program
2008-05-20T15:16:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	when i call another program, which really doesnt exist, i get the same error message, how come?
2008-05-20T15:16:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	it must have some dependency that you haven't installed. Try running it with 'strace ./1'
2008-05-20T15:16:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	ok thanks a bunch
2008-05-20T15:20:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	http://pastebin.org/37245, ??, another reason maybe: i am on 64bit and the program is for 32bit only? would that be possible?
2008-05-20T15:21:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	what kind of program is this? It tries to call makedev, which should be restricted to admin... I wouldn't trust it
2008-05-20T15:22:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	x-plane.com linux demo (flight simulator) it worked in a vm machine 32bit yesterday
2008-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	try calling it with linux32 ./1 (you may have to install it)
2008-05-20T15:26:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	same error message, another difference (and the only additional one) between yesterday (worked) and now is: now nvidia graphics driver installed. i hope thats not relevant
2008-05-20T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	why did you rename it?
2008-05-20T15:28:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	i had problems calling it from the command line with a programname which has spaces. tab couldnt help me
2008-05-20T15:28:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	you can escape spaces with \, ie. program\ name\ with\ spaces
2008-05-20T15:29:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	ok, have it working now with original filename and +/- linux32. no luck
2008-05-20T15:30:00.000Z	soundray	chris_	sorry, can't help you then
2008-05-20T15:30:00.000Z	chris_	soundray	thank you very much
