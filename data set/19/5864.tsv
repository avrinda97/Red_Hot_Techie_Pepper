2008-05-29T09:42:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	is doing nothing out of line
2008-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	ideally you would do the monitoring at your router device anyway, avoiding the wireless entirely...
2008-05-29T09:45:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	you could use wireshark if not for the fact you are probably using a switch, or your router has a switch, rather than a hub
2008-05-29T09:45:00.000Z	arc_shmoo	astro76	im a bit ignoranton all this parents are just "hey your the tech gooru and 30 you do it..."
2008-05-29T09:46:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	if you had an old pc you can use it with something like ipcop as your "router"
2008-05-29T09:47:00.000Z	arc_shmoo	astro76	got plenty of old pc's ill go grab one tomorrow and look into that i hope there is a way only to see his comp i dont need to know about my parents
2008-05-29T09:49:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	you'll need to network cards in it
2008-05-29T09:49:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	*two

2008-05-29T09:49:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	what are you using for the wireless ap?
2008-05-29T09:50:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	not really
2008-05-29T09:50:00.000Z	arc_shmoo	astro76	linksys 54gs router
2008-05-29T09:51:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	you will be plugging one of the ethernet cards on the pc to the *lan* port on the linksys, and you won't use the wan port
2008-05-29T09:51:00.000Z	astro76	arc_shmoo	and you'll turn off the dhcp server in the linksys config
2008-05-29T09:52:00.000Z	arc_shmoo	astro76	im saving this chat because its a bit late to go rummaging around the garage waking the dead 12PM
2008-05-29T09:52:00.000Z	arc_shmoo	astro76	ok
