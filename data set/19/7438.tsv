2008-10-30T20:04:00.000Z	grendal_prime		ok I want to make a wmv(or flash or anything that these people can view with windows) file out of an avi file that was encoded with xvid,
2008-10-30T20:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you can watch xvid on windows...
2008-10-30T20:05:00.000Z	grendal_prime	dr_willis	ya if we install a codec..wich i have no problem with doing but the it guys hate that idea
2008-10-30T20:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 i find it supriseing they dont allready have the divx codec or a dozen other codecs allready installed..
2008-12-13T11:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 gnome and kde bothj have a 'session manager' feature that lets you do that. depending on theapps.
2008-12-13T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you are not being very clear as to what you want..
2008-12-13T11:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you could make a script that  you double click to launch  several apps if thats what youi are wanting.
2008-12-13T11:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 learn to do it right then i guess?  :) make a simple script  shoulden tbe too hard.
2008-12-13T11:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you havent used kde4 then have you?
2008-12-13T11:16:00.000Z	grendal_prime	dr_willis	it was already there? see this machine came with ubuntu preinstalled and it did not have a home dir shortcut anywhere
2008-12-13T11:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 i have am using my old HOME on a lot of my machines.. so its hard to tell what is default.. but im pretty sure gettting a  Home icon on the gnome desktop is rather trivial.
2008-12-13T11:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you could just put a soft link from /home/whatever to /home/whatever/Desktop/Home   if you wanted
2008-12-17T05:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 most people dont even resize the features fuse can do.      and yes i find gnomes remote dir stuff flakey also.
2008-12-17T05:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you could just set up a few scripts that run the proper commands.
2008-12-17T05:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 you could see where it mounts and make a link from it to someplace easier to access I guess
2008-12-17T05:46:00.000Z	grendal_prime	dr_willis	ya, but then how the kde apps look at is bizzar if its a shortcut...grrrrr...
2008-12-17T05:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 latest release of gnome did a lot of changes in that area. a lot of those features dont work very well for me any more either. Gnome file manager here dosent even see most shares.
2008-12-17T05:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 a 'soft link' to a mountpoint is not a shortcut. all apps should access thefiles fine with a link
2009-04-29T05:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	grendal_prime	 could be some server is having problems.. they took a lot of 'load' in the last few days.
