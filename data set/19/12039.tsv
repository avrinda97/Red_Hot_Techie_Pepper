2005-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user		i need help with x window system in the new 5.10
2005-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user		ok, i just installed it on a PC w/ athlon 64 3000+
2005-10-19T06:57:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user		when the installation is complete, it boots up ok
2005-10-19T06:57:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user		but when startx is executed, the screen shows a bunch of colored lines
2005-10-19T06:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-10-19T06:59:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user	thoreauputic	: what does that do exactly , thx
2005-10-19T07:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	no need - just run it in a terminal, then ctr-alt-backspace
2005-10-19T07:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	ctrl-alt-backspace would only be if you were in X already, sorry
2005-10-19T07:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	if you are in  a tty, you can just startx after running it
2005-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user	thoreauputic	i reconifured and got the following:  fatal error:no screens found
2005-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	oh dear. Try sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg and say "no" to the framebuffer question
2005-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user	thoreauputic	: now its doing the weird thing with the lines of color, and the screen is flashing
2005-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	I don't know what causes that, frankly - you can rerun the command I gave you without the -plow and fiddle with it - I suggest trying the vesa driver just to get something working
2005-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	also you might try the "simple" options if that won't work
2005-10-19T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	if it's having troble with drivers, the vesa driver will usually at least get you up and running
2005-10-19T07:19:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user	thoreauputic	the Vesa driver works , thanks a bunch
2005-10-19T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	you're welcome
2005-10-19T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	UBUNTU-user	if you need better performance you can trouble-shoot a bit more
2005-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	UBUNTU-user	thoreauputic	ok, thanks again
