2007-05-06T13:14:00.000Z	maddog39	praecox	no radeon is the open source one that doesnt support 3D
2007-05-06T13:16:00.000Z	praecox	maddog39	I see. I have already installed xorg-driver-fglrx. is it enough?
2007-05-06T13:16:00.000Z	maddog39	praecox	yup, should be fine
2007-05-06T13:16:00.000Z	praecox	maddog39	ok, let me try restart my Xorg.
2007-05-06T13:16:00.000Z	praecox	maddog39	when I first switched from ati to radeon, my desktop effects stop working.
2007-05-06T13:16:00.000Z	maddog39	praecox	alright
2007-05-06T13:17:00.000Z	maddog39	praecox	yea because radeon doesnt support 3d
