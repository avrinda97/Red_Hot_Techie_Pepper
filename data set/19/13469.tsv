2005-04-02T11:34:00.000Z	ian		does it?  I don't see any difference
2005-04-02T11:34:00.000Z	ian		maybe in the gimp or something
2005-04-02T11:35:00.000Z	madstop	ian	or Amaranth, for a newbie: just how does one change color depth?  I can't find any settings for it.  I'd like 32 bit.
2005-04-02T11:37:00.000Z	ian	madstop	you can change it in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 -- I don't know of a GUI way (?)
2005-04-02T11:38:00.000Z	ian	madstop	DefaultDepth    24         just change to 16 (there may be a GUI way to do this?)
2005-04-02T11:38:00.000Z	ian	madstop	neither can I!
2005-04-02T11:45:00.000Z	ian	madstop	you put up with a few things in Linux... :)  but then, same goes for Windows, eh?
2005-04-02T11:51:00.000Z	madstop	ian	while you're at it (go get 'em man! We non (yet) *nixers need you) try to get boot managers and log-in managers to be less of a pain as well...  :-)
2005-04-02T11:52:00.000Z	ian	madstop	how so?
2005-04-02T11:54:00.000Z	ian	madstop	I'm not sure what you mean-- have it all in one big "control center" ?
2005-04-02T11:56:00.000Z	ian	madstop	KDE has a sensible control center? :)
2005-04-02T12:05:00.000Z	madstop	ian	if you want to hand out awards for horrible, beastly control centers, give it to gconfig, not kde
2005-04-02T12:05:00.000Z	ian	madstop	gconfig is not for novice users
2005-04-02T12:08:00.000Z	ian	madstop	if you think KDE is easier to learn, why do you think gnome is favored by big companies in their rollouts?
2005-04-02T12:09:00.000Z	madstop	ian	one thing I know for sure, what I look for in a desktop computer is not predicated by "big companies in their rollouts"
2005-04-02T12:13:00.000Z	ian	madstop	I'd be happy to listen to other issues you've had with gnome configuration
2005-04-02T12:17:00.000Z	ian	madstop	metacity and nautilus are gnome.  I'll filter, don't worry!  seriously, message me with your thoughts :)
2005-04-02T12:20:00.000Z	ian	madstop	no need for attitude.. :)
2005-04-02T12:21:00.000Z	madstop	ian	it's almost 2:30 in the morning, I'd be happy to talk at you more about this if you're on another time, and I do thank you for your patience with a newbie's issues
