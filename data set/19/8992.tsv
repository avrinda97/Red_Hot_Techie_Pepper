2007-02-18T12:25:00.000Z	Trentster		how do i get core 2 duo cpu multicore support working under Edgy?
2007-02-18T12:26:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	edgy  supports multicore out of da box
2007-02-18T12:27:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	not with the -386 kernel...
2007-02-18T12:27:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	just did a cat/cpuinfo, only shows 1 cpu
2007-02-18T12:31:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	386 kernel is not for new machines - perhaps it has no multiprocessor support
2007-02-18T12:31:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	its a new core 2
2007-02-18T12:35:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	you should be running a 686 kernel and sorting your nvidia problems like that
2007-02-18T12:35:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	does a 686 exist under synaptic
2007-02-18T12:35:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	Linux homebox 2.6.17-11-generic #2 SMP Thu Feb 1 19:52:28 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
2007-02-18T12:36:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	mybox
2007-02-18T12:38:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	whats Linux homebox 2.6.17-11-generic / mybox kernels designed for?
2007-02-18T12:39:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	do a uname -a in a console
2007-02-18T12:40:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	2.6.17-10-386
2007-02-18T12:41:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	you may possibly have to live with 1 processor core
2007-02-18T12:41:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	why?
2007-02-18T12:42:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	 686/generic is for modern day machines - you should be using it
2007-02-18T12:44:00.000Z	Trentster	Openix	Ok, will reboot now, I assume after reboot to-generic i have to re-install nvidia-glx...correct?
2007-02-18T12:44:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	 maybe?
2007-02-18T12:45:00.000Z	Openix	Trentster	 I take it you are trying for a 3d desktop?
