2004-11-23T16:44:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	what do you mean by march settings?
2004-11-23T16:46:00.000Z	oldfish	Riddell	I mean my settings are i686, athlonxp -02, sorry my brain is dead today, I usually have it in a make file in etc
2004-11-23T16:47:00.000Z	oldfish		I just don't want to compile it as i486 that ubuntu is compiled as...
2004-11-23T16:48:00.000Z	oldfish		also will HAL work with KDE?
2004-11-23T16:51:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	HAL bits for KDE are still in development, should be in KDE 3.4
2004-11-23T16:51:00.000Z	oldfish		Thanks Riddell,
2004-11-23T16:51:00.000Z	oldfish		any idea on my other q?
2004-11-23T16:52:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	nope sorry, I just use whatever compile settings it gives me
2004-11-23T16:52:00.000Z	oldfish	Riddell	right
2004-11-23T16:53:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	you set CXXFLAGS don't you?
2004-11-23T16:53:00.000Z	oldfish	Riddell	I dont really know, Its usually auto for me in Onebase Linux, I mean it asks during the install
2004-11-23T16:54:00.000Z	oldfish		Ridell, what about using apt-get to install from source, ever done that?
2004-11-23T16:54:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	I've downloaded source packages
2004-11-23T16:55:00.000Z	oldfish		Ridell, thats all it does, not like emerge?
2004-11-23T16:55:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	well then you run dpkg-source -x foo.dsc   to unpack source and debuild -us -uc to build, there may be a way to do all that automatically but it's fairly simple
2004-11-23T16:56:00.000Z	oldfish	Riddell	cool!
2004-11-23T16:56:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	it will complain about any dependencies you don't have but you have to download those yourself, won't do it automatically
2004-11-24T17:03:00.000Z	Riddell	oldfish	incidently you could just use my KDE packages
2004-11-24T17:05:00.000Z	oldfish	Riddell	I just apt-get -b source xmms, and its doing automatically, however it installed dependancies binary only, I will have to see if I can have everything compiled next, and btw it is compiling it for i686
