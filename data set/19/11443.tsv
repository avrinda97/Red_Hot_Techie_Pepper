2006-01-22T10:05:00.000Z	Shadyman	theneonshadow	I've learned things like.. Uninstalling Python is usually a BAD thing.
2006-01-22T10:07:00.000Z	theneonshadow	Shadyman	although i wouldnt wanna uninstall python, i took a class on useing it. I almost didn't even need the class but i felt like getting my skillz on paper
2006-01-22T10:07:00.000Z	Shadyman	theneonshadow	Yeah, but there are some programs that depend on python. And doing an absolute remove doesn't help matters.
