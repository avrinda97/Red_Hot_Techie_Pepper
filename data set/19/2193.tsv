2010-07-20T23:15:00.000Z	cablop		i'm not member of group root... why i can use sudo?
2010-07-20T23:15:00.000Z	cablop		ah nice
2010-07-20T23:15:00.000Z	cablop		i want to do something people dislike, but...
2010-07-20T23:16:00.000Z	cablop		i want to stop both shell and gnome to ask my password when doing sudo tasks
2010-07-20T23:16:00.000Z	Ebuntu	cablop	not a good idea
2010-07-20T23:16:00.000Z	cablop		why not a good idea?
2010-07-20T23:17:00.000Z	Ebuntu	cablop	hackers could wipe your system in about 6 seconds
2010-07-20T23:18:00.000Z	cablop		well, i does not defeat the idea of sudo, i just need to type sudo always, then just get rid of the Vista-UAC-like experience
2010-07-20T23:19:00.000Z	cablop	Ebuntu	hackers need to enter system as ME to crash my system, and they can if i give them my password, and if they have my password, then to ask for MY password at sudo is useless
2010-07-20T23:20:00.000Z	Ebuntu		caplob if someone sit down at your computer wile it is logged in, they could trash it
2010-07-20T23:20:00.000Z	Ebuntu		while
2010-07-20T23:21:00.000Z	Ebuntu		mjrp he's trying to get rid of the sudo pass
2010-07-20T23:21:00.000Z	cablop		but, Ebunto, this is another thing... to be aware not of hackers... but newbies
2010-07-20T23:21:00.000Z	cablop		but also it renders sudo useless again, my brother just enters my sesion, and use my password to mess the system... so sude bacame useless again.... :(
2010-07-20T23:22:00.000Z	Ebuntu		mjrp i dont know why the hell he would even think of removing sudo
2010-07-20T23:22:00.000Z	cablop		well, then... mmmm can i set a diferent password for sudo?
2010-07-20T23:22:00.000Z	cablop		not my password, but another pasword, that would keep me safe of my newbie sibloings XD
2010-07-20T23:23:00.000Z	cablop		they are going to need it, asl long as they need to access some virtual machines in the mean time
2010-07-20T23:23:00.000Z	Ebuntu	cablop	give your siblings there own account with no admin privlages and keep your pass away from them
