2006-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	Cattack		I have a qustion....how do you have a /home that multiple distros use without having them refuse to let you login due to settings issues?
2006-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	Cattack		I am planning a 3 Distro linux box but I want every distro on it to use the same usernames and /home
2006-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	there is no answer to that in general
2006-05-11T07:12:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	you could, for example, use an empty home directory, but I doubt that will be terribly useful
2006-05-11T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	usually, yes, but sometimes another device becomes sda
2006-05-11T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	I have a machine where the memory on one of my mobo devices is sda
2006-05-11T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	on that box, my sata driver is sdb
2006-05-11T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	grub uses a file to determine the correspondance of it's numbers (hd0), etc.  to devices
2006-05-11T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	if that file is wrong, things will not work for you.
2006-05-11T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	look at /boot/grub/device.map, if you have a grub directory at this point
2006-05-11T08:53:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	if you have a command line and /sys is mounted, you can find out what sda is pointing to, or conversely what sd your sata drive looks like
2006-05-11T08:57:00.000Z	Cattack	sethk	I am fairly new to linux so I am not familure with the /sys folder
2006-05-11T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	start by doing   ls /sys/block     that will show you block devices
2006-05-11T09:00:00.000Z	Cattack	sethk	sda is listed
2006-05-11T09:00:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	any other sd's?
2006-05-11T09:02:00.000Z	Cattack	sethk	so that must be it.   and the partitions are numbered starting form 0 with the first one as 0?
2006-05-11T09:03:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	numbered from 1, in sda1, sda2, etc.
2006-05-11T09:03:00.000Z	sethk	Cattack	numbered from 0 in grub
2006-05-11T09:04:00.000Z	Cattack	sethk	so 1 is 1 in /dev/sda type of entry into grub?
