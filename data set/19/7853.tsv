2008-09-24T11:10:00.000Z	arrrghhh		so i installed ubuntu on my buddy's HP desktop.  i'm getting these weird errors "BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 11s!"  then it looks like a "tainted" process...
2008-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	what kernel version is it using?
2008-09-24T11:12:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	i think 2.26.19... it's kinda freakin out
2008-09-24T11:12:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	der sorry.  2.6.24-19
2008-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	there are one or two BUG issues in rare cases, do a search on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ - you might find one that matches
2008-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	hrm... this system really doesn't seem to like ubuntu.  livecd didn't boot, alternate install failed and the minimal install worked but these soft locks are strange
2008-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	what is the precise model?
2008-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	pavilion a1210n
2008-09-24T11:19:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	sorry pavilion a1220n.  i can't read.
2008-09-24T11:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	From what I can see, both those models are trouble, I'm afraid
2008-09-24T11:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	do you know why?
2008-09-24T11:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	From what I am reading it's got a broken IRQ configuration amongst other things
2008-09-24T11:21:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	so there's nothing i can do?  i was really touting ubuntu to this guy, and he's really sick of winblows... it'd be a real shame if this doesn't work out at all.
2008-09-24T11:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	Also, it seems the same model number covers two sets of hardware, one Intel 32-bit, one AMD64 !
2008-09-24T11:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	hrm.  this is a p4.
2008-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	so 32-bit then
2008-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	so... is there nothing i can do?  i don't understand what is so horridly wrong with this system i can't run ubuntu...
2008-09-24T11:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	arrrghhh	I don't know, try Googling for clues
2008-09-24T11:28:00.000Z	arrrghhh	IntuitiveNipple	i have... i didn't find anything about IRQ's or anything like that so i figured you were onto something haha
