2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	The_Josh	nixu	How I ended up with gnome classic :[
2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	nixu	The_Josh	so you want the new shiny gnome3 interface?
2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	The_Josh		Yea
2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	The_Josh		I want to try it
2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	The_Josh		I just installed it and gnome shell too of course
2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	nixu	The_Josh	You get gnome classic when your graphics card can't handle gnome3, or they're disabled
2012-09-14T14:30:00.000Z	The_Josh		But selecting gnome on log in screen ends up with gnome classic
2012-09-14T14:31:00.000Z	The_Josh	nixu	My graphics card has shader model 5.0 and supports Direct X 11 (I know Direct X has no where to be found around linux)
2012-09-14T14:31:00.000Z	The_Josh		but just telling you that Its kind of "good" graphic card
2012-09-14T14:31:00.000Z	The_Josh		graphics*
2012-09-14T14:31:00.000Z	nixu	The_Josh	But do you have it set up?
2012-09-14T14:32:00.000Z	The_Josh	nixu	Well, Don't know, really, I don't see anything in Additional hardware panel
2012-09-14T14:32:00.000Z	nixu	The_Josh	https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/hardware/C/jockey.html
2012-09-14T14:32:00.000Z	The_Josh		In fact, I don't even see Additional Hardware in this gnome classic anywhere :[
2012-09-14T14:33:00.000Z	nixu	The_Josh	what is your graphics card name?
2012-09-14T14:34:00.000Z	The_Josh	nixu	Nvidia GeForce 520 GT
