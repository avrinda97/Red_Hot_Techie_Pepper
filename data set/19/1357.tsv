2011-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	JeffCBR		gettysS
2011-02-18T09:55:00.000Z	JeffCBR		What are Getty's?
2011-02-18T09:55:00.000Z	JeffCBR		!tty
2011-02-18T09:55:00.000Z	JeffCBR		Ok, I'm getting somewhere. :D
2011-02-18T09:56:00.000Z	JeffCBR		gnome is definitely dead now. :D
2011-02-18T09:58:00.000Z	JeffCBR		gdm is long since killed.
2011-02-18T09:59:00.000Z	JeffCBR		Ideally, I'd like this machine to boot to tty1.
2011-02-18T09:59:00.000Z	JeffCBR		Then, I'd like Gnome to be just "startx" away.
2011-02-18T10:00:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	sysv-rc-conf gdm disable
2011-02-18T10:05:00.000Z	JeffCBR	blackxored	How do I reverse sysv-rc-conf gdm disable?
2011-02-18T10:05:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	like enable? :P
2011-02-18T10:10:00.000Z	JeffCBR	blackxored	It looks like that may have worked. :D
2011-02-18T10:11:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	???
2011-02-18T10:11:00.000Z	JeffCBR	blackxored	Were you the one who helped me disable gdm?
2011-02-18T10:12:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	I wrote the command yes
2011-02-18T10:13:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	what about it?
2011-02-18T10:13:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	umm weird
2011-02-18T10:14:00.000Z	blackxored	JeffCBR	I actually don't advise this but try update-rc.d -f gdm remove
2011-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	JeffCBR	blackxored	That doesn't work in 10.10 due to some change.
