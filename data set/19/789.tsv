2011-08-26T15:25:00.000Z	auronandace	user_758	xfce instead of gnome or unity
2011-08-26T15:26:00.000Z	user_758		Is it more user friendly? Or should I stay with buntu for that?
2011-08-26T15:27:00.000Z	user_758		How do I refresh my Icons in my taskbar
2011-08-26T15:27:00.000Z	auronandace	user_758	depends on what you like, I don't like unity's interface and I've never liked gnome2 (and especially don't like gnome3)
2011-08-26T15:28:00.000Z	user_758	auronandace	It just seems that most apps are for gnome
2011-08-26T15:29:00.000Z	auronandace	user_758	I like gtk apps over qt and xfce uses gtk (just like gnome)
2011-08-26T15:29:00.000Z	auronandace	user_758	anything that works in gnome works in xfce
2011-08-26T15:32:00.000Z	user_758		Can I run Compiz in xfce? I like the effects
2011-08-26T15:32:00.000Z	auronandace	user_758	yes
