2009-11-25T11:41:00.000Z	syrius		why is ubuntu slow on bootups?
2009-11-25T11:41:00.000Z	syrius		9.10 is slower than windows vista now
2009-11-25T11:42:00.000Z	syrius		that is sad :(
2009-11-25T11:42:00.000Z	syrius		no
2009-11-25T11:42:00.000Z	syrius		many other people also you should check the bugs
2009-11-25T11:42:00.000Z	syrius		https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/464369
2009-11-25T11:42:00.000Z	syrius		I have lost hope in linux
2009-11-25T11:42:00.000Z	syrius		I most go back to xp
2009-11-25T11:43:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	bottom line is, your computer is slow. A large difference between Linux and Windows is that linux distributions load up system programs during boot up, while windows loads up the bare essentials required to be able to log in and then loads everything else up once the user has logged in
2009-11-25T11:44:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	this equates to higher performance in linux systems cause with windows, everything is loading up while a GUI is running, while with linux, you just have the virtual terminal and maybe a splash screen
2009-11-25T11:44:00.000Z	syrius	iKernel	then why is it that 9.04 only took 30 seconds?
2009-11-25T11:45:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	your crappy intel celeron processor broke while you were installing ubuntu karmic koala
2009-11-25T11:46:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	i guess there are more programs which load during start up in 9.10 than 9.04, or maybe one of the programs is buggy and takes a long time to sort itself out
2009-11-25T11:46:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	for me, it doesn't take much time at all
2009-11-25T11:47:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	if you don't like ubuntu, then that is the beauty of linux: you can use whatever you want. Use a different distribution if you don't like ubuntu, for example slackware
2009-11-25T11:48:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	slow hardware=slow boot times
2009-11-25T11:49:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	then use suse
2009-11-25T11:49:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	or maybe fedora core
2009-11-25T11:49:00.000Z	iKernel	syrius	hey there's an idea, sneak into a HP building, still a copy of HP-UX and install that
