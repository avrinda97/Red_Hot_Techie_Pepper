2007-04-12T05:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic		hmm network-manager doesn't just do wireless
2007-04-12T05:51:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	I cannot believe this, it works ... I've been on the network monitor for 2 weeks thinking I was all set ..
2007-04-12T05:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	it works? Great!
2007-04-12T05:51:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	 thanks a lot. btw, should I also change the rc.local edits I made earlier ?
2007-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	I was thinking about that - if it doesn't interfere, leave it
2007-04-12T05:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	if weird things happen, just make /etc/rc.local not executable ( sudo chmod -x /etc/rc.local )
2007-04-12T05:53:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	well, I haven't restarted yet, so I'm guessing it may become a problem once I do restart ... I hope that won't be the case
2007-04-12T05:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	ah - try making it non-executable and see if n-m works by itself
2007-04-12T05:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	if not, chmod +x it again
2007-04-12T05:54:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	ok, I'll try this.
2007-04-12T05:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	you may have to re-enter your keys etc
2007-04-12T05:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	a GUI box should pop up to do that though, when you login
2007-04-12T05:56:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	well, I did that (sudo chmod -x /etc/rc.local), nothing happend, I'm still online. And nmanager asked me for the keys when I started it anyway
2007-04-12T05:56:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	 so i guess it's ok now
2007-04-12T05:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	something would only happen on boot
2007-04-12T05:56:00.000Z	ROnewbi1	thoreauputic	 :-D. let's find out
2007-04-12T05:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ROnewbi1	that script only runs on boot, or when you run it yourself
