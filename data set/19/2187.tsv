2010-08-07T08:08:00.000Z	Zeu5		hi there, i am using GNS 3. and i am using idlepc so that it does not use up too much resources in my ubuntu, so i am looking at the system monitor and inoticed taht i have 2 CPUs. may i ask why that is the case?
2010-08-07T08:08:00.000Z	Random832	Zeu5	dual core
2010-08-07T08:10:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	so is my cpu usage normal?
2010-08-07T08:12:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	i see.
2010-08-07T08:13:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	yes i know.. wich is why i am runnning system monitor at same time :)
2010-08-07T08:15:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	hmm hang on let me check
2010-08-07T08:16:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	when i click on processes, there is a long list of sleeping processes
2010-08-07T08:17:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	gnome-system monitor 18% ~ 30 %
2010-08-07T08:17:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	chrome is 4~10%
2010-08-07T08:18:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	the rest are even more insignificant :)
2010-08-07T08:18:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	so i think i am good right?
2010-08-07T08:21:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	is that cause for concern?
2010-08-07T08:21:00.000Z	Random832	Zeu5	i'm just confused where the 30% and 50% you said was coming from
2010-08-07T08:22:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	oh that was when i turned on my gns3.. haha. ijust turned it off hence doesnt add up. my question is it is okay that 1 cpu is higher than the other right?
2010-08-07T08:22:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	cool :) thanks!~~~
2010-08-07T08:22:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	bye bye.my class is restarting
2010-08-07T08:23:00.000Z	Zeu5	Random832	i guess so.
