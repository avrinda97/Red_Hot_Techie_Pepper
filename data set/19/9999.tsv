2006-08-14T05:33:00.000Z	y0rgos		Guys, i need help trying to install my nvidia display driver - everytime i install it when my system reboots my monitor goes into standby
2006-08-14T05:34:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Sounds like you are using a resolution or something that your monitor can't handle
2006-08-14T05:35:00.000Z	y0rgos	Warbo	my monitor handles 1920x1200 and i was at 800x600 when rebooting, and ive tried 1280x1024 also
2006-08-14T05:35:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Maybe it is the refresh rate, horizontal or vertical rates?
2006-08-14T05:36:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	I don't know. I always just guess mine with what I think of as conservative values
2006-08-14T05:38:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-08-14T05:39:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	It wouldn't do any harm
2006-08-14T05:40:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Easier than changing xorg.conf
2006-08-14T05:49:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Now try restarting X (ctrl-alt-backspace)
2006-08-14T05:41:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Choose nvidia (you could choose nv, but what is the point if you are trying to get nvidia working?)
2006-08-14T05:42:00.000Z	y0rgos	Warbo	right, what ammount of memory to be used by video card?
2006-08-14T05:42:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	You shouldn't have to set it unless it is onboard, and then it depends entirely on the cartd
2006-08-14T05:43:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	no
2006-08-14T05:45:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Don't use DRI, I know that much
2006-08-14T05:45:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Is there a GLCore?
2006-08-14T05:47:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	I was going to say disable it. But I think the latest driver doesn't actually care
2006-08-14T05:47:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Use medium
2006-08-14T05:48:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	Yup
2006-08-14T05:51:00.000Z	Warbo	y0rgos	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start|stop|restart (where | means or) works as well
