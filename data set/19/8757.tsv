2007-02-13T07:14:00.000Z	megafauna		Can someone recommend a really good beginners guide to using the terminal?

2007-04-05T09:22:00.000Z	megafauna	Pelo	Thanks, I'll check it out!
2007-04-22T07:46:00.000Z	Pelo	megafauna	 you can only upgrade from cd if you have downloaded the alternate install cd,
2007-04-22T07:46:00.000Z	megafauna	Pelo	THANKS! That's inportnat!
2007-04-26T14:35:00.000Z	Pelo	megafauna	 the servers are overwhelmed with ppl upgrading, try again in a few days or a few weeks
2007-04-26T14:35:00.000Z	Pelo	megafauna	 or try upgrading from the alternate install cd ,  you can get a torrent for it
2007-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	megafauna	Pelo	I did that, it didn't work. maybe I'll try again tongiht.......
2007-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	Pelo	megafauna	 personnaly I think the upgrade process is still a bit overrated and needs work,  you'd be better of idoing a clean install
