2009-11-24T14:27:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	ubuntu*
2009-11-24T14:27:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	are you behind a router? you may have to forward the ports on your router
2009-11-24T14:28:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	i dont think ubuntu firewall is the problem
2009-11-24T14:34:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	yes
2009-11-24T14:42:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	are you behind a router
2009-11-24T14:43:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	usually by default router will block all incomming connections
2009-11-24T14:43:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	the router config page will usually be your gateway ip address
2009-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	run ifconfig
2009-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	type your gateway ipaddress into a web browser
2009-11-24T14:45:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	what was the address?
2009-11-24T14:46:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	thats probably your computers ip, try 192.168.1.1
2009-11-24T14:48:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	type route -n
2009-11-24T14:48:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	yes
2009-11-24T14:49:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	you should see a 192.168 address in the gateway column
2009-11-24T14:50:00.000Z	Billiard	snoopy	ok that works in a browser?
