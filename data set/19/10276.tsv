2006-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	dcnstrct		damnit the ubuntu disk image is < 700megs and won't fit on to any of my cds :(
2006-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	dcnstrct		err >
2006-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	yeah, it got bumped up over 650Mb with the latest release
2006-07-19T14:55:00.000Z	dcnstrct	Madpilot	which release is < 700megs ? I'd like to use it then just upgrade my software with apt-get
2006-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	hm, the basic Ubuntu ISO is 697Mb
2006-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	dcnstrct	Madpilot	not according to windows
2006-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	it is according to Ubuntu - either Windows is smoking crack, or there's something wrong with your download
2006-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	dcnstrct		windows says its (731,744,256 bytes)
2006-07-19T14:57:00.000Z	dcnstrct		no doubt the M$ people have been hitting the rock
2006-07-19T14:57:00.000Z	dcnstrct		never the less it won't fit on a 700meg cd
2006-07-19T14:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	no, remember that 1Mb is NOT 1000bytes, but 1024
2006-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	dcnstrct	Madpilot	then maybe these 700meg cds are not really 700 megs
2006-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	dcnstrct		I'll try the server image
2006-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	dcnstrct		if I use the server image what do I have to do to get it to be a desktop ?
2006-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	well, they should be... the ones I've got are, and the Ubuntu ISO fits nicely
2006-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	you'd just do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, that should get you everything
2006-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	dcnstrct	Madpilot	these are compUSA brand, they probably can't count.
2006-07-19T14:59:00.000Z	dcnstrct		excellent, thanks for the help guys
2006-07-19T14:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	dcnstrct	mine are Maxwell, guess they can count... ;)
