2005-03-10T07:50:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	'upgrade' upgrades packages that have no new dependancies. 'dist-upgrade' upgrades everything, even if it requires removing some packages due to conflicts, or pulling new deps.
2005-03-10T07:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	Hm, right; I still don't think that a dist-upgrade updates everything. Are you saying that, say, doing a dist-upgrade will upgrade my kde packages (presuming they have no new dependencies)?
2005-03-10T07:52:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	dist-upgrade will upgrade the packages even if they have new dependancies. upgrade will not.
2005-03-10T07:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	Ok, interesting; thanks.
2005-03-10T07:52:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	however, sometimes packages are not able to install, based on conflicts. dist-upgrade won't fix that.
2005-03-10T07:53:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	in such cases, specifying the package manually will usually generate a descriptive error that should explain the problem.
2005-03-10T07:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	are you having problems with installing some python things?
2005-03-10T07:55:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	oh no. Just using it as an example.
2005-03-10T07:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	Right; does python-kde install for y ou?
2005-03-10T07:56:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	I don't know, I don't use KDE. ;p
2005-03-10T07:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	sure, but it seems to be a python dependency problem; not kde. That was but an example.
2005-03-10T07:57:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	I'd test it, but I don't want to pull the kdelibs.
2005-03-10T07:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	You shouldn't have to. It should calculate *all* the dependencies, in which case you'll get an error
2005-03-10T07:58:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	I'll try it.
2005-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	yup; either that or plain python-kde
2005-03-10T08:00:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	try to install python2.3 first.
2005-03-10T08:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	SiliconViper	Sorry, my mistake. Yeah, there is another python2.3-kde3
2005-03-10T08:01:00.000Z	SiliconViper	apokryphos	no... not that.
