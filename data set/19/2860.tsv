2009-12-14T08:01:00.000Z	redonk	losha	there are alot of 0day exploits out right now
2009-12-14T08:02:00.000Z	losha	redonk	apache's definitely a weak spot....
2009-12-14T08:02:00.000Z	redonk	losha	the kernel is also
2009-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	losha	redonk	yes, but they have to get to the kernel first, which shouldn't be so easy if your system's tight...
2009-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	redonk	losha	heh what are u talking about lol any port thats accessiable remotely has access to the kernel
2009-12-14T08:05:00.000Z	losha	redonk	well personally, I only leave ssh open and require keys, but if you run apache, that's a whole new ballgame....
2009-12-14T08:07:00.000Z	redonk	losha	if any port is forwarded from the firewall to the system that has a vulnerable kernel that has an open port no matter if its apache ftp ntp ssh telnet smtp or what ever, then they can send packets that the kernel will "read" which can cause the kernel to be exploited
2009-12-14T08:07:00.000Z	losha	redonk	got a citation for that?
2009-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	losha	redonk	I hope you're off finding me a reference for your claim.....
2009-12-14T08:13:00.000Z	losha	redonk	no, just a web page where I can read up on it...
2009-12-14T08:17:00.000Z	redonk	losha	but my system was exploited using 2.6.31-14-generic-pae   just not but 3 weeks ago, when i contacted the NSA about some credit card fraud that was happening
2009-12-14T08:18:00.000Z	losha	redonk	do you know what happened?
2009-12-14T08:18:00.000Z	redonk	losha	do i know what happened with what?
2009-12-14T08:18:00.000Z	losha	redonk	how was your system exploited?
2009-12-14T08:19:00.000Z	redonk	losha	through a crypt lib via kernel attack
2009-12-14T08:21:00.000Z	losha	redonk	so what do I need to look at so I can evaluate my (and other people's) risk?
2009-12-14T08:23:00.000Z	redonk	losha	i ended up taking the latest kernel from kernel.org and compiling it with out the encrypted file system module
2009-12-14T08:25:00.000Z	losha	redonk	I don't seem able to find anything matching your description on http://securityreason.com/exploit_alert....
2009-12-14T08:29:00.000Z	redonk	losha	doesnt mean that the hole isnt their
