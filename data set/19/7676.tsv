2007-07-25T09:59:00.000Z	Optimus55		hey can someone remind me how to set the default gateway in CLI?
2007-07-25T09:59:00.000Z	Optimus55		i need it for an interface tty/usb0
2007-07-25T10:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	route add addr
2007-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	to set default gateway, sudo route add 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255?
2007-07-25T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	my little bit of experience says that's ok, but ask for more help with wireless/ethernet conflicts
2007-07-25T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	assuming you'll substitute the actual route for 0.0.0.0
2007-07-25T10:06:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	?
2007-07-25T10:06:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	well i had the same prob b4 on the live cd and came here. solved it by setting the default gateway to device tty/usb0
2007-07-25T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	route add <device ip> ?
2007-07-25T10:08:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	well its an evdo card, acts as dial up. so if i add a static ip, it probably wont work the next time i connect and it changes
2007-07-25T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	it seems you'd change that in pppconfig then, if it acts as a true dialup.
2007-07-25T10:10:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	how to edit pppconfig?
2007-07-25T10:10:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	i used wvdial btw, is that something different?
2007-07-25T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	hm. different, but does the same. sudo pppconfig, fill in the blanks. then pon to start the connection, poff to stop. Depending on permissions, you may need sudo
2007-07-25T10:12:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	i think the cmd i used was something like sudo route add default gw (interface)
2007-07-25T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	if your evdo works as a ppp interface, try pppconfig. It's pretty intelligent
2007-08-17T07:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	add sudo to the front of the command
2007-08-17T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Optimus55	sudo mv ~/Desktop/folder /usr/share/icons
2007-08-17T07:51:00.000Z	Optimus55	nickrud	nice! thanks a lot man
