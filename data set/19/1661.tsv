2010-11-14T07:24:00.000Z	humanMeat		support is probably half of using a software solution lol
2010-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	humanMeat		kyle__ why isn't open source used by billions of people then :( Windows is STILL the most popular OS

2010-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	humanMeat		i'm sick of reading docs that dont' document bugs or problems

2010-11-14T07:27:00.000Z	humanMeat		it's not off topic. i followed some documentation that's ubuntu related and got exceptions
2010-11-14T07:27:00.000Z	humanMeat		i'm bring it up here lol and now i'm sidetracked fro some reason
2010-11-14T07:27:00.000Z	humanMeat		so how do you figure out why 1194 isn't accepting info?
2010-11-14T07:28:00.000Z	humanMeat		i got multiple repeated responses "configure firewall, read the manuL etc etc " that were useless
2010-11-14T07:30:00.000Z	dingurt	humanMeat	you have iptables up?
2010-11-14T07:31:00.000Z	dingurt	humanMeat	what are your firewall rules?
2010-11-14T07:32:00.000Z	dingurt	humanMeat	sudo iptables -L
2010-11-14T07:33:00.000Z	humanMeat	dingurt	i got a whole bunch of stuff from that one.. i'll paste to see

2010-11-14T07:34:00.000Z	humanMeat	dingurt	http://pastebin.ca/1990774
2010-11-14T07:35:00.000Z	dingurt	humanMeat	is this computer behind a router?
2010-11-14T07:35:00.000Z	humanMeat	dingurt	it's a linode server. i think the default gateway ends with a 1 or something
2010-11-14T07:36:00.000Z	dingurt	humanMeat	looks like you need to do some reading on iptables. I think you have a blocked port.
