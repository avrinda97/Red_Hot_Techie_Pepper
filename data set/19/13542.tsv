2005-03-13T15:04:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	yes, its a known prob
2005-03-13T15:04:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	i do have a (rather complex) workaround, though
2005-03-13T15:04:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	that is you christian, is it ? (;
2005-03-13T15:04:00.000Z	storm		ah, it you :) hi!

2005-03-13T15:05:00.000Z	storm		installing gtk 2.4 would mean replacing the newer version, right?
2005-03-13T15:06:00.000Z	aleitner		storm:so, anyway. you go download gtk and glib, etc 2.4 from source. compile it and install it to some non-std location
2005-03-13T15:06:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	no, you dont replace anything
2005-03-13T15:06:00.000Z	storm		ah, ok
2005-03-13T15:06:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	be sure to set the right pkg-config variables
2005-03-13T15:07:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	then once installed, you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the non-std lib location
2005-03-13T15:07:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	then you call estudio with that var set
2005-03-13T15:07:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	the var now causes estudio to link against gtk 2.4 instead of gtk 2.6
2005-03-13T15:09:00.000Z	storm	aleitner	ok, i see.. a pretty hard workaround.. maybe i'll try. still runs on my notebook luckily
2005-03-13T15:09:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	(;
2005-03-13T15:10:00.000Z	storm	aleitner	i could use the included gtk-version? there's one in $ISE_EIFFEL/library/gel
2005-03-13T15:17:00.000Z	aleitner	storm	not sure
