2006-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	harisund		Does anyone know of a good VPN solution? I want to access my 192.168.5.0/24 subnet at home from outside. What is the best solution?
2006-10-25T05:34:00.000Z	harisund		those Yes, I am familiar with what you are seeing and that is the short term solution I am adopting now.
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund		rag what do you mean where is kernel?
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund		rag what do you want to do?
2006-10-25T05:35:00.000Z	harisund		rag yes, UBuntu doesn't ship with the kernel sources by default
2006-10-25T05:36:00.000Z	harisund		rag you will have to download it .. I believe the sources are called linux-source-$(uname -r) or something like that.
2006-10-25T05:36:00.000Z	harisund		rag in gentoo you get the sources by default. Not so in UBuntu. You will have ot download it manually
