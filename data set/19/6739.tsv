2007-12-13T02:22:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	[Scooter]	viewed from what gui ?
2007-12-13T02:22:00.000Z	[Scooter]	TallyWaxxor	any - problem isn't with viewing it, problem is with converting it
2007-12-13T02:23:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	[Scooter]	see
2007-12-13T02:23:00.000Z	[Scooter]	TallyWaxxor	it refuses to resize the video in question, even if i hand it the actual dimensions in place of qcif
2007-12-13T02:24:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	[Scooter]	havnt seen any qcif movies. whats that ?
2007-12-13T02:24:00.000Z	[Scooter]	TallyWaxxor	it's a standard
2007-12-13T02:25:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	[Scooter]	Made by whom ?
2007-12-13T02:25:00.000Z	[Scooter]	TallyWaxxor	google it, wikipedia has the scoop - it's as if the video file itself is locked in place and can't be resized anymore
2007-12-13T02:26:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	[Scooter]	Its just a file. With a file you can do anything.
