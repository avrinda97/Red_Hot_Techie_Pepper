2008-03-07T18:25:00.000Z	Duckstar		Hi all, quick question "sudo apt-get install flash-plugin" should work yes ?
2008-03-07T18:26:00.000Z	Duckstar		I have
2008-03-07T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	no.  Why not just visit a page that requires flash in firefox and click on the yellow bar that pops up?
2008-03-07T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	you need to enable the multiverse repository
2008-03-07T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	system -> administration -> software sources
2008-03-07T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	yes, then install flashplugin-nonfree
2008-03-07T18:30:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	But i took a list from my other machine, i don't see how that machine could have the package and this one can't
2008-03-07T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	pastebin your sources.list, the command you are using, and the full output
2008-03-07T18:34:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	I am not familiar with pastebin
2008-03-07T18:39:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58721
2008-03-07T18:39:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	with a "/" on the end
2008-03-07T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	get rid of automatix
2008-03-07T18:58:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	Sorry for the delay, yeah but i don't care if automatix isn't working .  I just want to be able to install some simple packages
2008-03-07T18:58:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	getting you a paste thing
2008-03-07T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	the issue is not whether or not automatix is working.  The issue is automatix breaks other things
2008-03-07T18:59:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58724/
2008-03-07T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	pastebin the command you are executing and errors you are getting as well
2008-03-07T19:13:00.000Z	Duckstar	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58728
2008-03-07T19:18:00.000Z	jrib	Duckstar	I don't see any issue, there are just three packages that do not exist.  adobereader and flashplugin-nonfree are what you are missing.  adobe reader is probably in medibuntu with some other name
