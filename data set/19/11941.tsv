2006-09-28T13:15:00.000Z	barry_		Gaim has segfaulted and attempted to dump a core file.
2006-09-28T13:15:00.000Z	barry_		This is a bug in the software and has happened through
2006-09-28T13:15:00.000Z	barry_		no fault of your own.

2006-09-28T13:23:00.000Z	barry_		which gaim should i get, red hat, mandrake, windows?
2006-09-28T13:23:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	...sorry?
2006-09-28T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	then you'd have to compile from source.
2006-09-28T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	however, the gaim is see on the website is 1.5.0, and the gaim i have on dapper is 1.5.0.... so why do you want the website one?
2006-09-28T13:27:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	not trying to, but gaim is a standard component of Ubuntu, i'm sort of surprised that it would crash that way
2006-09-28T13:27:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	did you install software from non-ubuntu repositories, or manually, or use automatix or easyubuntu, or something else weird?
2006-09-28T13:28:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	what command did you use?
2006-09-28T13:29:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	what command is it that tells you    Could not open "gaim_1.5.0+1.5.1cvs20051015-6_alpha.deb"
2006-09-28T13:30:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	you mean double-click on it? try this from a shell instead, "sudo dpkg -i gaim_1.5.0+1.5.1cvs20051015-6_alpha.deb"
2006-09-28T13:30:00.000Z	LjL	barry_	(you have to be in the directory where the file is... if it's on the desktop, type "cd ~/Desktop")
