2009-05-21T21:05:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	nope . .  it used to . . .
2009-05-21T21:05:00.000Z	ozzmosis	jag__	maybe you're running the nv driver, not the nvidia one
2009-05-21T21:05:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	how do I check which 1 Im using ??
2009-05-21T21:06:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	nv being ?? default  ??
2009-05-21T21:08:00.000Z	ozzmosis	jag__	nv is the open source nvidia driver but it doesn't do 3D, afaik.  /var/log/Xorg.0.log should tell you which driver you're using.  should be able to open it in gedit.
2009-05-21T21:08:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	dropd to shell using CTRL+alt + F2 , then set runlevel 1 , then 3 .   then ran sudo NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-169.12-pkg2.run
2009-05-21T21:10:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	(II) NVIDIA GLX Module  169.12  out of my log

2009-05-21T21:11:00.000Z	ozzmosis	jag__	that doesn't look good :)
2009-05-21T21:12:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	(II) NV: driver for NVIDIA chipsets: RIVA 128, RIVA TNT blabla  . . .does this mean that if it shows in log it is using it ?( the open source )

2009-05-21T21:17:00.000Z	jag__	ozzmosis	would it be good idee to download linux driver from Nvidia website? or would it be better to install from ubuntu repos ?
2009-05-21T21:19:00.000Z	ozzmosis	jag__	probably ubuntu's, cos then you get automatic updates.  on the other hand it's a bit risky getting auto updates for your video driver, cos if it breaks you're stuck without X.  so I don't know.
