2009-10-29T23:58:00.000Z	MadnessRed		how do I stop if from requesting a password when I mount a partition?
2009-10-29T23:59:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	add the users option in the fstab line
2009-10-30T00:01:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	usullay, if there isn't ANY line on the fstab file, if you click on the partition in Places, it is mounted without any password request.
2009-10-30T00:01:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	it's the simplier way
2009-10-30T00:04:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	lol, you havo to paste on http://paste.ubuntu.com, NOT HERE
2009-10-30T00:07:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	any line related to the partition you have to mount
2009-10-30T00:08:00.000Z	MadnessRed	K99Brain	no there is nothing there relating to the parition i want to mount
2009-10-30T00:08:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	as you have now
2009-10-30T00:08:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	and now, if you click on the partition you want to mount in Places
2009-10-30T00:09:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	it isn't mounted?
2009-10-30T00:15:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	yes
2009-10-30T00:16:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	but, i was thinking.. you have checked the "remember authorization" checkbox?
2009-10-30T00:17:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	when the "An application is attempting to perform..." appears
2009-10-30T00:17:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	ah, ok, and in the 9.10 there isn't?
2009-10-30T00:18:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	ok, now it's clear which is the problem :D ok, add that line in the fstab file
2009-10-30T00:18:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	the policykit is changed
2009-10-30T00:19:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	you can try with: sudo mount -a
2009-10-30T00:20:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	sudo mkdir /media/DATA
2009-10-30T00:21:00.000Z	K99Brain	MadnessRed	you're welcome
