2010-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	meowkbuntu		whats teh most compace format of zip in linux
2010-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	nibbler_	meowkbuntu	bzip2 (tar cjf for eg)
2010-01-30T15:27:00.000Z	meowkbuntu	nibbler_	and ardchoille disagree
2010-01-30T15:28:00.000Z	nibbler_	meowkbuntu	well, rar is not really free, and bzip is way more modern, and its the linux standard (besides gnuzip, which is older and not as compact)
2010-01-30T15:28:00.000Z	nibbler_	meowkbuntu	i'd say in this case he is wrong, but his "?" suggests its just an idea :p
2010-01-30T15:29:00.000Z	meowkbuntu		i remember now bzip2 i cant do bzip when rightclicking the file
2010-01-30T15:29:00.000Z	nibbler_	meowkbuntu	look for downloading sourcepackages on sourceforge eg and see what you find they use as a format :p
2010-01-30T15:29:00.000Z	meowkbuntu	nibbler_	how do i do that
2010-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	nibbler_	meowkbuntu	just rightclick, chose compress, chose tar.bz2 as format
2010-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	nibbler_	meowkbuntu	by the way, tar.gz would be *the* standard format, which you can unpack on practically *any* unix out there, bzip2 needs a bit more modern systems
