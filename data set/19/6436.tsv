2008-01-31T03:38:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		Though obviously it will be fast once booted :D
2008-01-31T03:38:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		Seriously, I discovered this first in fedora and was amazed at how awesome it has been
2008-01-31T03:39:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		I assume that this loads pretty much everything into ram
2008-01-31T03:39:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		If I leave my computer on while running from RAM, how environmentally unfriendly will I be? Hmm... how about if I hibernate?
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		Ah
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		Like Flash media? What are the advantages of these?
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		Nah, I don;'t really use radiaters
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		8radiators
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		What's the advantage of this over HDD?
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		And also, don't they die after 100 000 writes?
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	no moving parts.. faster..
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	and hard drives last forever? =)
2008-01-31T03:43:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	yes.. it's just that a hard drive dies before the ssd drive
2008-01-31T03:44:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	/proc isn't a "on disc" file.. it's just a .. what to call it.. in memory file
2008-02-29T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	I'd say yet
2008-02-29T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	oops.. I meant yes
2008-02-29T03:59:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd	Slart	Cheers
2008-02-29T03:59:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	you're welcome
2008-02-29T03:59:00.000Z	Slart	Nihilist_Nerd	but I haven't seen the question yet =)
