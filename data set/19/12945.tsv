2005-07-07T16:49:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	isn't that based on wine or something like that?
2005-07-07T16:49:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	yea it uses wine
2005-07-07T16:49:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	it just makes installing the specific windows programs actually work
2005-07-07T16:50:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	will AutoCAD install using on it?
2005-07-07T16:50:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	too bad it doesn't support office 2003 yet
2005-07-07T16:52:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	it doesn't have auto cad in the list.. you may still be able to install it but I doubt it will be as easy
2005-07-07T16:55:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	here's a "Demo" so u can try before you buy http://isohunt.com/torrents.php?ihq=crossover+office&ext=&op=and
2005-07-07T16:57:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	yeah I was just looking it up on google, that's true, it won't run autocad.
2005-07-07T16:57:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	you can run quicken lol
2005-07-07T16:58:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	maybe someday, autodesk will make autocad for Linux :/
2005-07-07T16:58:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	ya maybe
2005-07-07T16:59:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	i'm thinking of installing photoshop 7 on ubuntu here but i don't think my 400mhz would like it lol
2005-07-07T05:00:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	I really prefer Gimp over photoshop,
2005-07-07T05:01:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	there's qcad but it's no where near AutoCAD.
2005-07-07T05:01:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	i've tried gimp... i can't make circles without having to do 50 different things
2005-07-07T05:02:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	you get used to it eventually.
2005-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	inc595	hussam	well i guess i'm just used to photoshop... it works for me
2005-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	hussam	inc595	try to find photoshop 6 or something, not only should it be cheaper than 7 or 8 but it should run easily on a 400Mhz PC.
