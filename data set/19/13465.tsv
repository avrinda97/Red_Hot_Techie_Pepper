2005-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	DaSkreech		Can I apt-get downgrade a package?
2005-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	DaSkreech		Yes it is for X.org :)
2005-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	yes
2005-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	DaSkreech	jasoncohen	Wonderful is there a tutorial I can read?
2005-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	you can downgrade a package easily in synaptic by selecting the package and choosing force version
2005-07-28T16:07:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	package > Force Version
2005-07-28T16:07:00.000Z	DaSkreech	jasoncohen	and if the problem is that I can't get to Synaptic which is why I need to install an old package? :)
2005-07-28T16:07:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	what did you do?
2005-07-28T16:08:00.000Z	DaSkreech	jasoncohen	Up dated X
2005-07-28T16:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	why are you running breezy?
2005-07-28T16:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	if you aren't a developer you shouldn't be using breezy. it's unstable
2005-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	DaSkreech	jasoncohen	Understood
2005-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	downgrading something like xorg isn't going to be easy because of all of its dependencies.
2005-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	DaSkreech	jasoncohen	There are some Mono apps that work better under breezy that we are very interested in
2005-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	DaSkreech	jasoncohen	All of our machines run Ubuntu Hoary cept one
2005-07-28T16:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	well, then you have to accept the instability and you should learn how to fix it yourself by reading the apt howto. you should be a knowledgable debian user
2005-07-28T16:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	these things can be fixed but not easily
2005-07-28T16:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	what's wrong with mono 1.1.7 in backports?
2005-07-28T16:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	DaSkreech	yeah, 0.17 is in ubuntu but it requires quite a bit of setup
