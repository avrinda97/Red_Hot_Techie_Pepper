2010-06-08T03:34:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	*blush* here's my very own tutorial.  Used ubuntu not fedora, but I believe the same technique will work.
2010-06-08T03:35:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	sorry I did not get the link to your tutorial
2010-06-08T03:36:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	dual booting is not a problem for me. It's triple booting that is
2010-06-08T03:36:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	understood.  I triple with osx/win7/ubuntu

2010-06-08T03:37:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	so where is the link to your tutorial? and I hope it has been updated to grub2

2010-06-08T03:37:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	thanks
2010-06-08T03:39:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	ah! it hasn't been updated to include Ubunu's new Grub2
2010-06-08T03:39:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	wrong.  ubuntu uses grub2
2010-06-08T03:41:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	ah! you went the easy way using Grub. I'm a bit of a masochist. I want to go the hard way round and use Grub2 to triple boot
2010-06-08T03:42:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	yes you're trying to cause pain to yourself.  good luck.
2010-06-08T03:42:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	lol
2010-06-08T03:43:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	you do realize this tutorial only uses grub2 since 9.10?  no GRUB involved
2010-06-08T03:45:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	I've found a problem with Ubuntu's Grub2 though...and I think they should work on it. If it is so much easier to triple or quadruple boot with Grub, is Grub2 really better?
2010-06-08T03:47:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	dual boot under grub - few problems.  triple boot under grub2 as described - no problems.  triple boot under grub - no experience.  sorry
2010-06-08T03:49:00.000Z	cheekee	acerimmer_	you triple or quadruple boot everyday with Grub when a new kernel is installed
2010-06-08T03:50:00.000Z	acerimmer_	cheekee	what we have here is failure to communicate.  GRUB is out of ubuntu as of 9.10.  GRUB2 is now the default bootloader.
