2006-10-25T06:16:00.000Z	akaspersen		Could anyone help me configure my locales, I need support for norwegian letters in bash
2006-10-25T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	bash as such does not deal with character sets. You need to configure your terminal program or console.
2006-10-25T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	are you using the console or gnome-terminal?
2006-10-25T06:18:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	gnome-terminal
2006-10-25T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	ubuntu seems to support three Norwegian languages. Which do you need?
2006-10-25T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	nn, nb or no?
2006-10-25T06:19:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	norwegian(no) or norwegian bokml (nb) should both be fine
2006-10-25T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	'sudo apt-get install language-pack-gnome-no language-pack-gnome-nb', then log out of gnome and choose your preferred language at the login screen.
2006-10-25T06:22:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	thanks, I'll try
2006-10-25T06:27:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	what's the symptom of "terminal won't understand them"?
2006-10-25T06:29:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	I could write a file with a word, e.g. fl, and when I open the file in the editor (gvim usually), everything seems fine, but if I use the "more"-command, I'll get a output like "f l"
2006-10-25T06:30:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	it could be that the font you've chosen for the terminal doesn't supply that character. Change the font via Edit-Current Profile
2006-10-25T06:34:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	that doesn't seem to work either
2006-10-25T06:35:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	you may need the language-support-nX package(s) as well
2006-10-25T06:37:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	I have all the norwegian language-support packages installed. Any other ideas?
2006-10-25T06:41:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	so you've tried different fonts in the terminal?
2006-10-25T06:45:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	yes, and nothing seemed to work
2006-10-25T06:46:00.000Z	soundray	akaspersen	sorry, out of ideas. Have you asked in #ubuntu-no ?
2006-10-25T06:47:00.000Z	akaspersen	soundray	I'll try now, thanks for your help
