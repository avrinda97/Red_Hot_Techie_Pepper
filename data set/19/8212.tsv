2009-01-18T02:08:00.000Z	corey__		under what package name would I find the development files for ncurses?
2009-01-18T02:09:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	have you searched in synaptic for ncurses dev?
2009-01-18T02:14:00.000Z	corey__	Slart	E: Couldn't find package libncurses5-dev
2009-01-18T02:14:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	are you using intrepid? have you enabled the repos?
2009-02-04T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	it sounds weird that wireless wouldn't use the dns cache
2009-02-04T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	have you tried any other dns caching system? I think there are a couple of them
2009-02-04T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	how long does a simple "host www.google.com" take?
2009-02-04T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	have you tried using opendns servers?
2009-02-06T13:54:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	scite does filetime checking?
2009-02-06T13:54:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	ah.. to see if it has to reload the files?
2009-02-06T13:56:00.000Z	corey__	Slart	I wish to not have it check for an update on the file time/size
2009-02-06T13:56:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	I'll have a look.. see what I can find
2009-02-06T13:56:00.000Z	corey__	Slart	my files are on a remote server which I am accessing via sshfs. It causes about ~5 seconds DELAY when switching to a different file.. horrible
2009-02-06T13:57:00.000Z	corey__	Slart	I combed through the globals property file. Didn't find anything that had an effect on it.
2009-02-06T14:02:00.000Z	corey__	Slart	any luck?
2009-02-06T14:02:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	I'm browsing the scite manuals.. nothing good yet
2009-02-06T14:03:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	have you tried the load.on.activate setting?
2009-02-06T14:03:00.000Z	corey__	Slart	yes with no effect. I believe that setting is for when you target the Scite window, not for the files themselves.
2009-02-06T14:05:00.000Z	Slart	corey__	nope..that was all I found..
