2007-04-04T14:59:00.000Z	timalot	|caicai|	type "about:plugins" in the location bar of firefox and see if the java plugin in mentioned in the list of plugins
2007-04-04T15:01:00.000Z	|caicai|	timalot	a don't have any plugin for java mentioned there i want to know how to put it there
2007-04-04T15:02:00.000Z	timalot	|caicai|	it needs to be installed in or linked to in either /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins or ~/.mozilla/plugins
2007-04-04T15:03:00.000Z	|caicai|	timalot	and how i do that
2007-04-04T15:03:00.000Z	|caicai|		i'm not an expert in linux
2007-04-04T15:04:00.000Z	timalot	|caicai|	ln -s /usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so ~/.mozilla/plugins
2007-04-04T15:04:00.000Z	timalot	|caicai|	but the plugin might be in a different dir on your system but it will be similar
2007-04-04T15:07:00.000Z	|caicai|	timalot	 i have done that and nothing happens
2007-04-04T15:08:00.000Z	timalot		!java
