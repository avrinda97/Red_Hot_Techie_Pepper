2009-03-16T17:34:00.000Z	Skaag		my nvidia 177 restricted driver fails, in 8.10...
2009-03-16T17:34:00.000Z	Skaag		I have an nVidia Corporation GeForce 9500 GT (rev a1)
2009-03-16T17:35:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	fails how?
2009-03-16T17:36:00.000Z	Skaag	ziroday	It can't find the kernel module for some reason
2009-03-16T17:36:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	err did you install the drivers from the repo
2009-03-16T17:36:00.000Z	Skaag		a modprobe for nvidia says not found
2009-03-16T17:36:00.000Z	Skaag		I installed it using the restricted driver manager
2009-03-16T17:36:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	right
2009-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	Skaag	ziroday	Do I also need to install something manually with aptitude?
2009-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	do you know if you are currently using the nvidia driver?
2009-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	Skaag		Right now I'm in low graphics mode
2009-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	Skaag		and lsmod doesn't show nv or nvidia
2009-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	oh kay, did you edit your xorg.conf?
2009-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	Skaag		I ran nvidia-xconfig which did that for me... was that too presumptius? :_)
2009-03-16T17:38:00.000Z	Skaag		presumptuous
2009-03-16T17:38:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	err possibly, What does nvidia-settings say?
2009-03-16T17:38:00.000Z	Skaag		it first pops a small dialog which says i do not appear to be using the nvidia X driver
2009-03-16T17:39:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	okay, you sure you have -177 installed?
2009-03-16T17:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Skaag	actually I have to run. I'm sure somebody else will be able to help you here.
