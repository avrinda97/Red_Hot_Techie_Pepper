2005-08-28T08:18:00.000Z	Milk		I was wondering if anyone could guide me through setting up a dual-head card (radeon)

2005-08-28T08:20:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	so you want to setup two monitors in xinerama mode?
2005-08-28T08:21:00.000Z	Milk	jasoncohen	yes, 2 monitors, 1 big desktop
2005-08-28T08:22:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	run fglrxconfig and choose the big desktop setting...it should be quite easy to do. make sure you know your monitor specs
2005-08-28T08:22:00.000Z	Milk	jasoncohen	do I need to download/apt-get a driver first?
2005-08-28T08:23:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	you'll need to use the fglrx driver
2005-08-28T08:23:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2005-08-28T08:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	it supports most radeons. i'm not sure if it supports one that old. i have a 9700 pro
2005-08-28T08:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	check out ati's site
2005-08-28T08:34:00.000Z	Milk	jasoncohen	It didn't work
2005-08-28T09:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	you'll want to share the printer with CUPS on windows and then add
2005-08-28T09:09:00.000Z	Milk	jasoncohen	I think you have it backwards, the printer is attached to the ubuntu machine.. I want to print FROM the xp box
2005-08-28T09:12:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	oh sorry. that's easy. you just have to add the printer in windows using the CUPS  URI
2005-08-28T09:12:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	i.e "ipp://serverip:631/printers/PrinterName
2005-08-28T09:12:00.000Z	Milk	jasoncohen	can you be a little more detailed
2005-08-28T09:12:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	for me that is "ipp://jasonsdesktop:631/printers/Stylus-C84"
2005-08-28T09:13:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Milk	you add the printer using the URI in xp
2005-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	Milk	jasoncohen	that didn't work
