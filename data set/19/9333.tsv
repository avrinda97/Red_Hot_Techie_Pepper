2009-04-05T03:45:00.000Z	SliderMan		slart, do you know if they have auto filling and stuff like vs2008 has?
2009-04-05T03:47:00.000Z	SliderMan		slart, visual studio not visual basic, and what is emacs?
2009-04-05T03:47:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	emacs is an OS (this is a troll xD, its a very complete IDE, but i very dislike it)
2009-04-05T03:49:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	directly get the site's version, the repo's one is quite outdated, and eclipse's auto update system usually fails.
2009-04-05T03:49:00.000Z	SliderMan	SiDi	thanks.
2009-04-05T03:50:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	lighttpd, apache, and there are more lightweight ones but i dont remember the name
2009-04-05T03:51:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	its a very complete one, afaik, so it should have php5
2009-04-05T03:52:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	good luck to find an httpd with a configuration GUI :) those things are designed for servers (and apache is easy to configure ;P)
2009-04-05T03:56:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	eclipse is opensource (its from sun if i remember well). you'll need some plugins for c++, check their website
2009-04-05T03:57:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	i think they have .debs anyways
2009-04-05T03:59:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	i wish i could read it without headaches :P
2009-04-05T04:02:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	hf compiling then :p
2009-04-05T04:03:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	if it fails it means you'll have to install one or two -dev packages, nothing to worry about
2009-04-05T04:06:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	extract the .tar.gz, there is a README and an INSTALL file there ;) usually just type ./configure && sudo make && sudo make install
2009-04-05T04:09:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	system -> administration -> language support :P
2009-04-05T04:10:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	check scim, you might need a file that adds hebrew support to scim (dont ask me how, i don't know ;p)
2009-04-05T04:15:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	"ubuntu+hebrew" gives me 1,2 million results on google ;) i'm going to bed, i wish you good luck with it
2009-04-06T02:20:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	some ISP offer SIP free phone :)
2009-04-06T02:21:00.000Z	SiDi	SliderMan	mine offers free SIP phone over all europe + usa + china + canada (and a few more countries)
