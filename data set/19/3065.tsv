2011-04-10T09:52:00.000Z	gartral		HELP. I let my one laptop's battery die today while it was booted into ubuntu without relising it, and when i came back i logged in fine but neither metacity nor my panels came up!
2011-04-10T09:53:00.000Z	gartral		schmidtm_: lemme try
2011-04-10T09:54:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	can you get to a terminal? (not ctrl-alt-f1)
2011-04-10T09:54:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	yes, but i can't get online..
2011-04-10T09:55:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	try running this in terminal: nautilus --no-default-window
2011-04-10T09:57:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	did you get my post?
2011-04-10T09:57:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	one sec.
2011-04-10T09:57:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	returns too prompt.
2011-04-10T09:58:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	"nautilus --no-default-window" returns to prompt? it doesn't give you an error or anything?
2011-04-10T09:58:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	i'll retype it
2011-04-10T09:59:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	returns too prompt. with both quotes and without
2011-04-10T10:04:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	that can happen. what does apt-get say about it? does it show it as installed?
2011-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	nope. i figured it out, it got removed when i tryed too remove evolution! i got if-up too connect, r4eset and download
2011-04-10T10:06:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	shcherbak thank you both!
2011-04-10T10:06:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	cool. i rip out most of that junk at install, so i set up a start up app with that "nautilus --no-default-window" command, otherwide i have no dekstop.
2011-04-10T10:08:00.000Z	gartral	hylian	yea. never remove evolution-data-server... that'swhat did it
2011-04-10T10:10:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	i just sudo apt-get remove evolution, but like i said after that, no more desktop without my little cheat.
2011-04-10T10:13:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	 glad to be a help, but you pretty much solved this one on your own.
2011-04-10T10:14:00.000Z	hylian	gartral	check this out: that's one uncluttered desktop! http://postimage.org/image/1dl88znyc/
