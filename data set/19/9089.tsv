2009-10-16T19:10:00.000Z	psinetic		is anyone listening?
2009-10-16T19:11:00.000Z	psinetic		ok, well chatting here is fine too, i just figure chatting in private message would be easier for troubleshooting.
2009-10-16T19:13:00.000Z	psinetic		i've had problems with ubuntu ever since the day I installed it. if it's not one problem it's another. But i used some software called "Remove Orphaned Packages" it removed alot of stuff i am using right now, and now alot of my apps won't run, everything looks different, and icons are missing.
2009-10-16T19:14:00.000Z	psinetic		i have no idea how to do that
2009-10-16T19:14:00.000Z	psinetic		i'm a computer technician with the navy, but i only know windows
2009-10-16T19:16:00.000Z	psinetic		how would i go about doing a "repair install" on my OS? (I have 9.10 test for ubuntu)
2009-10-16T19:17:00.000Z	psinetic		>_> why doesn't ubuntu have the system restore option? like, if i install something there's nothing to restore my system to before i did that or to another specific date.
2009-10-16T19:19:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	there are several applications able to do that, but none installed by default.
2009-10-16T19:29:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	No.
2009-10-16T19:31:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	that's because afaik, orphanded =/=crap
2009-10-16T19:38:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	exactly what packages did you remove with the orphan-clean-thingy?
2009-10-16T19:42:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	did you have a lot of packages installed without using a repository (i.e. downloaded deb files) or from a repository which are no longer enabled?
2009-10-16T19:43:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	aptitude is a higher-level program with a semi-gui available, it also tends to give you more information compared to apt-get...
2009-10-16T19:46:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	did your desktop include a menubar at the top.
2009-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	or rather, are you using Kubuntu rather than the gnome-based ubuntu.
2009-10-16T19:53:00.000Z	arand	psinetic	using tab-completion makes spelling mistakes rarer ;)
