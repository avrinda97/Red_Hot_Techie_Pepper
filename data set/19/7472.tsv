2008-12-21T15:46:00.000Z	runlevelten		does anyone know of any incompatibilities between dash and bash that would break things if I fixed the default shell
2008-12-21T15:46:00.000Z	runlevelten		?
2008-12-21T15:46:00.000Z	runlevelten		sorry, not fixed, switched it to bash
2008-12-21T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	there are quite a few differences.. some scripts just won't run with one or the other
2008-12-21T15:47:00.000Z	runlevelten		ah, so I couldn't just hand things over to bash after x starts to ensure things work for users?
2008-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	I'm not sure if bash can do everything dash does.. any special reason you want to replace dash?
2008-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	runlevelten		my thinking was that if they were nicely compatible, then the only negative upshot would be an impreceptible speed difference if they restarted stuff, etc
2008-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	dash is used just because it's a lot lighter than bash.. so replacing dash with bash will probably slow your computer down
2008-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	runlevelten	Slart	yes, I was rather hoping I could hand over to bash after init had started the machines
2008-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	runlevelten		and it's more than one machine
2008-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	but why not give it a try.. rename dash and create a shortcut that's called dash but pointing to bash
2008-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	then try rebooting.. but have a live cd ready if things don't work out
2008-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	runlevelten		I'm completely happy to have it used during startup since that offers an advantage
2008-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	runlevelten		but the incompatibility with shell scripts doesn't really give users any advantage
2008-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	or even better.. try it in a vm
2008-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	runlevelten		aside from the pleasure of being admonished for expecting things to work as bash - and I don't feel committed to arguing with them about that :)
2008-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	=)
2008-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	runlevelten	Slart	yes, really it's time to suck it and see, I guess :)
2008-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	Slart	runlevelten	it's a small enough change so reversing it would be a 2 minute job
