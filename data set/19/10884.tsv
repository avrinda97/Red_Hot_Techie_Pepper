2010-10-29T11:02:00.000Z	iheartubuntu		hello! after a recent update, i lost use of my center mouse wheel. anything i can do to fix this? thanks!
2010-10-29T11:03:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 do you recall any of the updates?
2010-10-29T11:03:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	  I assume you already rebooted to see if it persists?
2010-10-29T11:04:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	  is this a usb mouse?
2010-10-29T11:05:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 where it is plugged in is the plug round or flat?
2010-10-29T11:07:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 ok ...by chance are you dual booted with windows?
2010-10-29T11:07:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 what I mean is ..do you also have windows installed on that same machine?
2010-10-29T11:08:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 oh :) ok  the reason I asked is to rule out  hardware issue
2010-10-29T11:09:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	  ok  open a terminal  and type   xinput list
2010-10-29T11:09:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 look for your mouse id there
2010-10-29T11:09:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 did you find the mouse id?
2010-10-29T11:10:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 ok now in  that same terminal type  xinput test  id=whatever the id is  then press the middle mouse button
2010-10-29T11:11:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 ok it might be a hardware issue then...try one of the other ids as well for left click and right click test
2010-10-29T11:12:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 do you have another mouse you can test with?
2010-10-29T11:12:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 ok ... well... the first thing to test here is if it is indeed the hardware... it just may be a coincidence that after the updates the mouse decided to die
2010-10-29T11:13:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 but that has to be tested first,,, to be sure
2010-10-29T11:13:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 the thing that puzzles me is the "Virtual core pointer" listing there
2010-10-29T11:14:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	 did you try unplugging the mouse and putting it into another usb port?
2010-10-29T11:17:00.000Z	coz_	iheartubuntu	  ah  wait... on my xinput list there is also a virtual core xtest pointer however,  below that is the mouse name so apparenlty the system is not seeing the mouse properly ...change the usb port if possible  or just unplug then replug the mouse back in ...run xinput list again
