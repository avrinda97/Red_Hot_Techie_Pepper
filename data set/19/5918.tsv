2009-11-09T12:42:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	maybe you ?
2009-11-09T13:14:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	did you try right clicking the desktop icon for the disc and clicking run auto-start program? or something to that effect?
2009-11-09T13:14:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	didn't checked
2009-11-09T13:23:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	you want to install ubuntu on top of an ubuntu install WHILE you're running ubuntu?
2009-11-09T13:24:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	i want to install ubuntu on an other drive but from my alreayd installed ubuntu, should be easy no ?
2009-11-09T13:24:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	i found it amazing that i need to either burn ubuntu on a cd and reboot with the cd (used for nothing) or mount the image with daemontools in winblows to install it from winblows
2009-11-09T13:25:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	but anyway i'm gonna do like that
2009-11-09T13:25:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	except if you see another solution
2009-11-09T13:25:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	yes but its just as easy to slip the live cd in your drive, restart and install that way too
2009-11-09T13:26:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	do you read me ? to make that you need a blank cd wich is totally stupid when can mount an .iso file
2009-11-09T13:27:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	ok so mount the iso to a use and boot from there.. System > Admin > USB Startup Disc Creator
2009-11-09T13:27:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	and what's more funny is (i want to install that ubuntu on an a usb pen drive) and all around the web when you type install ubuntu on a usb pen drive they only talk about installation of a LIVE CD on a usb pen drive and not of a REAL installation on a usb pen drive
2009-11-09T13:28:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	you're funny, you're able to boot on mounted .iso files ?
2009-11-09T13:29:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	the utility makes your usb a bootable drive therefor its not a iso when you use this utility rather like a cd but on a USB
2009-11-09T13:30:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	you're not following thx for having tried to help me
2009-11-09T13:30:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	thats the sole purpose of the USB Startup Disc Creator
2009-11-09T13:32:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	please man, i've did it and that's why i want to make a real install cause usb startup disc creator creates a live cd on a usb disk and not a installed ubuntu on a usb disk wich makes a big difference cause you have more a install usb pen drive than a usb ubuntu drive
2009-11-09T13:32:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	witakr	if you would read me you wouldn't say things that i know since a long that i've made since a long time and that are not talking about what i ask
2009-11-09T13:33:00.000Z	witakr	jacquesdupontd	ok, i digress, good luck
