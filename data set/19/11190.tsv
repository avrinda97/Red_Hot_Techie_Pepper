2006-12-22T17:13:00.000Z	cafuego_		actually, gtkpod wasn't happy with the new video metatdata format last time I tried it
2006-12-22T17:13:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	nothing really likes the video ipod :)
2006-12-22T17:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	me and my tv like it a lot actually
2006-12-25T06:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	my ffmpeg outputs to flv just fine
2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	with mp3 audio?
2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	the one I did had no audio in it, dunno.
2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	Mind you, I had to go from ogg to yuv first; then to flv
2007-01-03T17:50:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	Well, the firmware isn't in Ubuntu as such.
2007-01-03T17:50:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	But thousands of users aparently like it.
2007-01-03T17:50:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	yeah I keep forgetting some people bcm don't work by defautl I m one of the lucky ones :)_
2007-01-03T17:50:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	Yours works without firmware?
2007-01-03T17:51:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	it needs firmware to use natively but it works by default in ubuntu
2007-02-05T11:00:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	ah I forgot to say cdrecord since that is the only thing that matters and works if you know how to use it
2007-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	not quite
2007-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	really how can you kill all processes? and stay login just wondering since I don't know how to do that but then again I m more of a cli
2007-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	[disclaimer]  as root: kill -9 -1 [/disclaimer] 
2007-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	kitche	that stops everything really quickly
2007-02-16T11:51:00.000Z	kitche	cafuego_	hmm I should try that on a vm since I only run linux in a VM right now
