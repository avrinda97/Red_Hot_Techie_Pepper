2005-08-29T08:42:00.000Z	nate_		With the ubuntu guide.
2005-08-29T08:43:00.000Z	nate_		So I figure, uh do you know of a java.deb file to download?
2005-08-29T08:43:00.000Z	nate_		Could you send it please?
2005-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	wiki.ubuntu.com/Java
2005-08-31T09:03:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	sure, cdparanoia has options for that.  way way easier to rip the whole thing and snip the bit you want out later, tho.
2005-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	no
2005-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	you rip it however you normally would (grip is nice), then use sweep to cut the bit of the track yo uwant
2005-08-31T09:09:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	er, weren't you trying to rip a song from a cd?
2005-08-31T09:12:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	you can't play cds with grip if your computer is missing the 10c cable linking the sound card to the cd drive
2005-08-31T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	to do what?  you mean a compiler?
2005-08-31T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	install build-essential, that will give you a compiler and such
2005-08-31T11:57:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	you mean an IDE?
2005-08-31T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	if you're using GNOME anjuta is probably a better choice
2005-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	nate_	bob2	what was the name of the compiler you recommended? Anjunta?
2005-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	it's not a compiler, it's an IDE
2005-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	the only useful, common compiler on Linux is gcc
2005-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	nate_	bob2	Is it called Anjunta? Can I get it through apt-get?
2005-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	nate_	anjuta, yes
