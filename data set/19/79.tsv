2012-11-10T17:43:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	talpur	 do you have update manager, or synaptic running?
2012-11-10T17:43:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	talpur	 if you do, close those out.
2012-11-10T17:43:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		then try
2012-11-10T17:44:00.000Z	talpur	TheLordOfTime	which command I use to close them
2012-11-10T17:44:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	talpur	 erm, are they open in another window was the question.
2012-11-10T17:44:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	talpur	 update manager'd be its own window, so would synaptic or any other package manager.
2012-11-10T17:45:00.000Z	talpur	TheLordOfTime	I want to close them forcely so is there any command

2012-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		killall synaptic
2012-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		as for others if they're open i won't know what they are
2012-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		those're the two common ones

2012-11-10T18:03:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	talpur	 no, just 'killall' as the command
2012-11-10T18:03:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		not 'kill all'
