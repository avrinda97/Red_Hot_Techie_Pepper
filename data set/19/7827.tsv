2007-06-30T13:19:00.000Z	alecwh		No, I don't want to Learn RoR. I'm more interested in Python.
2007-06-30T13:19:00.000Z	alecwh		What is that? a book?
2007-06-30T13:20:00.000Z	alecwh		Ok, great. I'm a PHP/CSS/XHTML user, but I don't know ANYTHING about Python.
2007-06-30T13:21:00.000Z	alecwh		ok. What do I need to run Python itself?
2007-06-30T13:22:00.000Z	alecwh		cool!
2007-06-30T13:22:00.000Z	alecwh		ok, cool. I'm excited to jump into Python. :D
2007-06-30T13:23:00.000Z	alecwh		Now, you can make actual programs with Python?
2007-06-30T13:23:00.000Z	alecwh		Whole programs?
2007-06-30T13:23:00.000Z	alecwh		Are tarballs just python files?
2007-06-30T13:23:00.000Z	magnetron	alecwh	yes, frets on fire is a good example
2007-06-30T13:24:00.000Z	magnetron	alecwh	tarballs (.tar.gz) is basically an equivalent of zip files

2007-07-18T14:25:00.000Z	alecwh	magnetron	thanks a lot! What command would I use to play an MP3 file in rythmbox?
2007-07-18T14:26:00.000Z	magnetron	alecwh	i am not sure
2007-07-18T14:36:00.000Z	magnetron	alecwh	you could use commandline music player, like mpg123
2007-07-18T14:37:00.000Z	alecwh	magnetron	how do I launch it (with a song) after installation?
2007-07-18T14:41:00.000Z	magnetron	alecwh	escape your whitespace
2007-07-18T14:47:00.000Z	alecwh	magnetron	do I need to start "schedulr" on bootup?
