2010-08-13T05:53:00.000Z	wheliton		good evening. i need some help to change the resolution of my ubuntu. can anyone help me?
2010-08-13T05:54:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	do you know what your video card is and do you know if you have the driver set up for it?
2010-08-13T05:54:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	for the generic resolution settings, go to System > Preferences > Monitors and you will see the controls there.
2010-08-13T05:57:00.000Z	wheliton	headkase314	- i dont know what is my video card.
2010-08-13T05:57:00.000Z	wheliton	headkase314	i know there is a command for me to get the information about my videocard, but i dont remenber it.
2010-08-13T05:58:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	are you on a fresh install?  You can go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers and see if any are offered for your machine.  Hopefully that will show either an Ati or an Nvidia solution.
2010-08-13T05:59:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	if one is offered there you just need to activate it.  Then reboot and your display should be at its native resolution.  If there is nothing there then its a bit more complex and someone else will have to jump in too.
2010-08-13T06:00:00.000Z	wheliton		HEADKASE - that is right. i am not offered any resolution but 600x800
2010-08-13T06:00:00.000Z	wheliton		HEADKASE324 - that is right. i am not offered any resolution but 600x800
2010-08-13T06:01:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	System > Administration > Hardware Drivers, do you see something that says Ati or Nvidia there?
2010-08-13T06:03:00.000Z	wheliton	headkase314	- i was said that there is no drive properties in the system
2010-08-13T06:04:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	that statement really doesn't make sense.  Go to the "System" menu in the upper-left corner, select "Administration" and then choose "Hardware Drivers", in that - exactly what does it say?
2010-08-13T06:06:00.000Z	wheliton	headkase314	- IT SAYS: "there are no driver properties in the system"
2010-08-13T06:07:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	There are no proprietary drivers on your system, not properties?  Is there any listed that you can activate - Ati or Nvidia?
2010-08-13T06:08:00.000Z	wheliton		HEADKASE314 - sorry. i had problems when translated. they said "no proprietary drivers". proprietary, not properties
2010-08-13T06:08:00.000Z	wheliton	headkase314	- but the list i was given is blank
2010-08-13T06:09:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	ok, if the list window is blank then someone else is going to have to help - first need to find out what your video hardware is and then see about getting you to a resolution higher than 800x600.  Sorry, this is the limit I know myself - someone else will have to help from here.
2010-08-13T06:10:00.000Z	wheliton	headkase314	- ok. i did appreciate your help. thank you so much.
2010-08-13T06:10:00.000Z	headkase314	wheliton	you're welcome ;)
