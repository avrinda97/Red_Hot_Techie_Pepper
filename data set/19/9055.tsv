2007-02-05T08:10:00.000Z	xtknight		lgc:wwhat do you mean by "accelerate the processor"?
2007-02-05T08:10:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	by "accelerate" I mean "make it go faster".
2007-02-05T08:10:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	you can not make your CPU go faster, other than by overclocking
2007-02-05T08:11:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	if you'd like to optimize your system we may be able to reduce the cpu load
2007-02-05T08:11:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	is there anything in particular that seems slow, or would you just like a lower latency system?
2007-02-05T08:11:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	the load should suffice to make it go faster, like when I run a number-crunching program.
2007-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	are you talking about a CPU that scales frequency?
2007-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	indeed.
2007-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	well that is a different matter :)
2007-02-05T08:13:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	i am not completely sure on how to do it.  Core Duo CPU, or Core 2 Duo ?
2007-02-05T08:14:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	single-core.
2007-02-05T08:14:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	do you know if you're using the performance governor or the userspace governor?
2007-02-05T08:14:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	no.
2007-02-05T08:15:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	i'm afraid this is all i can do: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=linux+frequency+scaling&btnG=Google+Search
2007-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	I'm looking at it, thanks!
2007-02-05T08:35:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	It did the trick!
2007-02-05T08:36:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	do you happen to know how to rev up the fan? It's starting to smell funny here...:)
2007-02-05T08:36:00.000Z	xtknight	lgc	i dont know.  i also have a controllable fan and ive been trying for ages to figure out how
2007-02-05T08:37:00.000Z	lgc	xtknight	oh, well, it seems the fan's "overdrive" just kicked in...
