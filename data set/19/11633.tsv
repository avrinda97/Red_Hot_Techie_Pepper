2005-12-18T12:04:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		Funny thing... I was an early adaptor. 1982... bought a TI/99. Went through a ton of over priced toys... c-64, amiga, apple... loved apple os 7. Finally settled into windows 3.1. geez... I'm old!!!
2005-12-18T12:05:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		My son has infected his AND my PC's with CWS highjacks. I'm ready to divorce Mr. Gates.
2005-12-18T12:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	CWS? wazzat?
2005-12-18T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	I used Windows until May of this year, but I've always had a healthy distrust of most of those "free" "helpful" addons... :P
2005-12-18T12:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	I do - you?
2005-12-18T12:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	recip - I've just got my Private, still working toward IFR/Comm
2005-12-18T12:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	you've been flying just a bit longer than I have, then :)
2005-12-18T12:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	I planning on flying for a living - and as for sanity, holding a PL & being sane seem to be mutually exclusive
2005-12-28T10:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	yes
2006-01-05T10:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	actually, I'm breaking the 8hr bottle-to-throttle rule as we speak, so no post-takeoff checklist for me! :P
2006-01-05T10:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	I usually allow 18-24 between, myself ;)
2006-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	Aviatrixie	Madpilot	at this point it's kind of irrelavent for me. I've flown professionally for 30 years. Suddenly I'm medically grounded. So... my AME tells me to keep my mind active. I've decided to learn linux. ;)
2006-01-05T11:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	good for you - too bad about the medical - hope you get it back soon!
2006-01-05T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	the great secret of aviation - aircraft are actually powered by paperwork, not by avgas or JetA... :P
2006-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	yes, got my PPL
2006-03-01T09:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	I think you've been here before - welcome back
2006-03-01T11:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	they're useful, got lots of apps & such in them
2006-06-29T11:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	be glad automatix didn't just break everything for you...
2006-06-29T11:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Aviatrixie	I do - I think I've seen you here before, too
