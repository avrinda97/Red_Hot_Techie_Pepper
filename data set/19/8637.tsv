2012-04-02T16:12:00.000Z	Kuba		hey
2012-04-02T16:12:00.000Z	Kuba		I'd like my kindle to autmount always to specified location; how should I do it? /etc/fstab and UUID?
2012-04-02T16:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 i thought mine always mounts to /media/kindle
2012-04-02T16:14:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	what should I do e.g. to change that directory then?
2012-04-02T16:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 not on ubuntu at the moment. but normally filesystems that have a "label" get mounted to /media/TheLableName
2012-04-02T16:15:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	okay
2012-04-02T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 when i plug mine in it alwyas pops up the file manager anyway. :) so ive rarely noticed its mountpoint.
2012-04-02T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Mi kindel Fire may be differnt then the Kindle reader also.
2012-04-02T16:16:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	I'm writing some scripts to autosync ebooks, so I'd like to make sure kindle is mounted at a given directory
2012-04-02T16:17:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	I'd rather not depend on "i though", you know
2012-04-02T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 pop it in look where its mounting to.
2012-04-02T16:17:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	mine's at /media/Kindle
2012-04-02T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 i use that Calibre program to sync my ebooks.
2012-04-02T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 so in theory it should always auto mount to there. thats the 'Label' of the filesystem on the book.
2012-04-02T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 there can be cases where if it dosent unmount properly you can get added _'s to the end of the mountpoint.
2012-04-02T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!info links
2012-04-02T16:19:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	btw, can you manage collections from Calibre?
2012-04-02T16:20:00.000Z	Kuba	Dr_willis	last time I checked it, it didn't have that feature
2012-04-02T16:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kuba	 i tend to just use it to read the 'reviews/summary' of the books. then i coppied over a few 100+ books. :) havent needed to run it in ages.
