2007-01-23T09:39:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	yes i'm using xgl
2007-01-23T09:41:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	i think there's a problem in beryl/compiz with the way it tells resized window co-ords to java windows, so programs that start out with a small frame then pack it with stuff don't show up at all, i think there's a workaround in java 6
2007-01-23T09:41:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	but i'm not sure, at least that give you an idea as to what's causing it tho
2007-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	thanx knwing the cause if half the solution
2007-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	oFFbeAt		*is
2007-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	so if i remove beryl.. i'll b able to use it right?
2007-01-23T09:43:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	try using beryl-manager to switch to metacity, and see if that solves teh problem
2007-01-23T09:43:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	if it does, then in theory, when you switch back with the ready resized window, it should work again
2007-01-23T09:51:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	yes forcing metacity to manage windows does solve the problem
2007-01-23T09:52:00.000Z	oFFbeAt		beryl is nasty
2007-01-23T09:52:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	nonsense, beryl's great, its just young yet, give it time to iron out the wrinkles
2007-01-23T09:53:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	yes it's very shiny :D but i'd give priority to the applications
2007-01-23T09:54:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	works perfectly with everything i use, and increases my productivity massively, i can't work without my workspaces
2007-01-23T10:09:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	according to a forum.. latest jdk solves the problem.. so i'm gonna try that now
2007-01-23T10:09:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	cool, good luck
2007-01-23T10:13:00.000Z	oFFbeAt	CookedGryphon	do i need to remove jdk 1.5?? or just go for 6 n it'll take care of it?
2007-01-23T10:13:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	oFFbeAt	if you leave the 1.5 on, do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure java to select which version to use tho
