2009-04-27T21:51:00.000Z	antonio_		i can't switch any desktop! how is it possible? Could anyone help me?
2009-04-27T21:51:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	did you try ctrl-alt and the arrow keys?
2009-04-27T21:52:00.000Z	antonio_		sure...
2009-04-27T21:52:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	when i used the live cd everything goes right, now i cant... both with ctrl+alt+arrow or by clicking the desktop switcher
2009-04-27T21:53:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	oh with the live cd the desktops can be switched... but not when you actually installed ubuntu on the harddrive?
2009-04-27T21:54:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	right... is exactly as you say
2009-04-27T21:54:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	maybe is because i installed also compiz config setting manager...
2009-04-27T21:55:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	but all others effects goes right
2009-04-27T21:55:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	did you try to lower the effects to normal just to check whether it has to do with the more complex effects?
2009-04-27T21:57:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	so you say to disable effects? but with 8.10 everything was ok :(
2009-04-27T21:57:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	yeah but will you live like this forever? just change it for a seconds to check whether this is the reason for your problem. :)
2009-04-27T21:58:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	 okok just a sec
2009-04-27T21:58:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	ok with normal effects everything goes right :(
2009-04-27T21:59:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	so, did you try to update to the latest compiz?
2009-04-27T21:59:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	i tried to re-activate effects and now works... what do you think was the problem?
2009-04-27T21:59:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	yeah i just installed it so i think is the lastest
2009-04-27T22:00:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	more complex effects only work with better graphics cards. maybe you have a graphics card that is very special? =)
2009-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	antonio_	lem_	i have a nvidia geforce 8400M... dont look so bad :D
2009-04-27T22:04:00.000Z	lem_	antonio_	check on the compiz website. I think I saw a compatibility list
