2011-05-08T23:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	oddly, the debian package seems to still be around; packages in ubuntu usually are just rebadged debian packages
2011-05-08T23:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	does it use qt 3 or qt 4?
2011-05-08T23:35:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	launchpad does have a package compiled for 11.04, x86 and x64, but I kind of want software I'm using to be in a repository, so it gets updated and stuff
2011-05-08T23:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	it's odd, there is a package for oneiric and maverick, just not natty
2011-05-08T23:36:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	it uses Qt4, or at least that's what the changelogs indicate
2011-05-08T23:37:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	there is a naty package... https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+package/kdbg
2011-05-08T23:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	there isn't one on the kdbg project page
2011-05-08T23:38:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	I think you're right... the ubuntu build is linked against Qt3
2011-05-08T23:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	okay
2011-05-08T23:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	so what i think happened
2011-05-08T23:39:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	is Qt3 verboten?
2011-05-08T23:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	the current version was built against Qt3, which might have been jettisoned in Natty, therefore it could no longer be built
2011-05-08T23:40:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	the reason it is in oneiric is because upstream moved to 4, and they bumped the package from 2.2 to 2.5
2011-05-08T23:40:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	basically, the maintainers failed to bump the package before natty froze, so the old version had to get bumped off
2011-05-08T23:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	but it's likely somehow has a ppa of the new version, i think
2011-05-08T23:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	it's unfortunate but ubuntu hasn't always been the best keeping up with kde
2011-05-08T23:43:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	to me it's not a KDE issue... it's a development issue. GDB is an aweful program to use, many say "just use emacs", other than that we have DDD which was ugly 15 years ago
2011-05-08T23:44:00.000Z	burito	tensorpudding	well at least I can stop freaking the hell out now
2011-05-08T23:45:00.000Z	tensorpudding	burito	the solution might be to try building the oneiric source package
