2007-07-13T13:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	what are your current system specs?
2007-07-13T13:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	mandriva couldn't carry ubuntu's jockstrap.
2007-07-13T13:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	then the ideal thing to do, is figure out how to configure your ethernet card, and correct the problem
2007-07-13T13:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	open a terminal, and type lspci, then hit enter, and look through the output, and find your ethernet device, and tell us what ti is.
2007-07-13T13:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	even if we could, are you gonna remember till you get to the office?
2007-07-13T13:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	way to many variables, we need to know the device
2007-07-13T13:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	its lspci
2007-07-13T13:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	wed need to know the type of card to tell you that, thats what i told you
2007-07-13T13:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vbanait	if you'd like me to just piss in the wind and tell you something, i can, but theres a 99.9% chance it won't work
