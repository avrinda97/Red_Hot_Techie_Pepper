2006-12-12T13:46:00.000Z	AlphaN3		hmm
2006-12-12T13:46:00.000Z	AlphaN3		I switched from xdm to gdm recently. The font size is now too small to read. Anyone can help me fix this?
2006-12-12T13:47:00.000Z	AlphaN3		It used to be 75dpi. Now it's like 50.
2006-12-12T13:47:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	System -> Administration -> Login Window
2006-12-12T13:51:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	you said the problem started when you changed from xdm to gdm
2006-12-12T13:51:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	yep.
2006-12-12T13:51:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	i removed xdm prior to installing gdm. could that be the cause?
2006-12-12T13:51:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	gdm uses it's own font settings as compared to your default session-wide fonts, i though
2006-12-12T13:52:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	I wouldn't have thought so, but I haven't used xdm in years
2006-12-12T13:52:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	yeah, but there is the titlebar font and many others that won't be fixed from gdmsetup. hmph...
2006-12-12T13:52:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	the distributions I use changed their defaults, and gdm works just fine for me
2006-12-12T13:54:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	but the titlebar font should be set separate from your [xgk] dm fonts, is there an xfce font selection tool?
2006-12-12T13:55:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	i don't think so.. well let me tell you the full story.
2006-12-12T13:57:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	My last setup was the default xubuntu install, plus ion3. Everything worked like a charm. Various font sizes cooperated. Then some accident happened, and i lost my /bin.
2006-12-12T13:57:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	did you re-install at that point?
2006-12-12T13:58:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	So I reinstalled the system from scratch, using the minimum setup as the base this time (i didn't want totem and something else). I installed XDM, and played with it for a while. And it worked fine, but XDM was inadequate for my need. So I aptitude remove xdm, aptitude install xdm, and arrived here.
2006-12-12T14:00:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	well, you might look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf, gdmsetup, and whatever the xfce font tool is
2006-12-12T14:01:00.000Z	AlphaN3	fangorious	alright, thanks for the advice (:
2006-12-12T14:01:00.000Z	fangorious	AlphaN3	sorry
