2008-02-02T05:40:00.000Z	jrgp		!sound
2008-02-02T05:41:00.000Z	jrgp		can anyone please help me with my broken sound?
2008-02-02T05:41:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	what's the problem?
2008-02-02T05:43:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	try running: killall -9 vlc       in the terminal
2008-02-02T05:43:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	vlc has a bug that, sometimes if it's killed via xkill, it will still remain as a running process in the background.  you can test this, if you run 'ps aux | grep vlc'
2008-02-02T05:44:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	run that ps aux | grep vlc
2008-02-02T05:44:00.000Z	jrgp	nemilar	joe      13681  0.0  0.0   2972   764 pts/1    S+   19:44   0:00 grep vlc
2008-02-02T05:44:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	huh.  try restarting alsa?
2008-02-02T05:45:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	oh, in that case... check that nothing is muted or all the way down, in the mixer
2008-02-02T05:45:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	sometimes that will happen for some reason
2008-02-02T05:46:00.000Z	jrgp	nemilar	everything is up all the way
2008-02-02T05:46:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	hmm this is very strange.
2008-02-02T05:47:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	you tried multiple applications, nothing plays sound?
2008-02-02T05:48:00.000Z	jrgp	nemilar	I didn't do anything involving root, could it be a config error in a hidden file in my home directory?
2008-02-02T05:48:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	I doubt it... if xmms is acting like it's playing sound
2008-02-02T05:49:00.000Z	jrgp	nemilar	what if I apt-get purge everything sound related and then reinstall them?
2008-02-02T05:52:00.000Z	jrgp	nemilar	what the? I change a toggle switch in alsamixer and it got the sound back :) I really appreciate you trying to help. thanks
2008-02-02T05:52:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	yeah I figured it would be something in the mixer
2008-02-02T05:52:00.000Z	nemilar	jrgp	glad it works
