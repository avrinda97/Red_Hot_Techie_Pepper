2011-02-24T20:46:00.000Z	ddi		hi guys is there a way to connect two monitors to a single ubuntu machine and display one workspace on monitor1 and workspace2 on monitor2
2011-02-24T20:47:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	yes but might depend on the graphic card you have
2011-02-24T20:47:00.000Z	ddi	High_Priest	Redbox thanks
2011-02-24T20:50:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	redbox, it also depends on the motherboard. not all mobos will support 2 graphic cards - at least to run at the same time
2011-02-24T20:51:00.000Z	ddi	High_Priest	thanks i think you are also right
2011-02-24T20:52:00.000Z	ddi	High_Priest	how do i set one work space on one monitor and workspcace2 on second monitor
2011-02-24T20:52:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	2 monitors are usually done via 1 graphic card which can do this
2011-02-24T20:53:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	if your graphic card can connect 2 monitors, then connect them, next step would be to configure X server to send appropriate output
2011-02-24T20:53:00.000Z	ddi	High_Priest	and how do you achieve that with one graphics card
2011-02-24T20:53:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	what does it have in the back? hdmi? vga output? how many?
2011-02-24T20:54:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	also, nvidia chip based cards have a nice GUI utility to do it
2011-02-24T20:55:00.000Z	ddi	High_Priest	my vga card is built in and only has a single monitor port
2011-02-24T20:57:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	I don't think you can accomplish what you want with what you have right now
2011-02-24T20:58:00.000Z	ddi	High_Priest	yeah but i have another video card handy i can plug that in my box
2011-02-24T20:58:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	what output that other card has? how many?
2011-02-24T21:00:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	same thing...doesn't change anything
2011-02-24T21:00:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	you need a vga card which is cappable of connecting 2 monitors
2011-02-24T21:01:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	check http://www.ubuntugeek.com/dual-monitors-with-nvidia.html and http://superuser.com/questions/29834/fedora-dual-monitor-one-workspace-per-monitor
2011-02-24T21:02:00.000Z	High_Priest	ddi	rather check second page first
