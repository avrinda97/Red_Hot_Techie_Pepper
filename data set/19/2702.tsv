2010-06-05T09:33:00.000Z	Euthanatos		is there nowhere I can go to figure out how to support my new monitor?  Or am I just just screwed because hardware is a gamble with linux?
2010-06-05T09:34:00.000Z	Euthanatos		bios settings for monitor support?
2010-06-05T09:35:00.000Z	Euthanatos		it's not an IGP
2010-06-05T09:35:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	have you even mentioned what gfx card you're running?
2010-06-05T09:36:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	then you should start looking in that area, "how do I get multiple monitor support on my ATI card".
2010-06-05T09:37:00.000Z	Euthanatos	SwedeMike	i'm not looking for multiple mointor support i only have one 1080p monitor that i want to use i was trying to get it working as a second monitor from using my old 19" 3:4 as a failsafe because ubuntu flaked on me
2010-06-05T09:38:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	sorry, no experience with ATI for me.
2010-06-05T09:38:00.000Z	Euthanatos	SwedeMike	i'm pretty sure it's not an ATI issue but okay
2010-06-05T13:52:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	so how far does the monitor work in the bootup process?
2010-06-05T13:54:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	are you sure about that 173Mhz? seems excessive?
2010-06-05T13:55:00.000Z	Euthanatos	SwedeMike	no i thought that was retarded to but that's what cvt says....furthermore it's NOT 173...it's 60
2010-06-05T13:56:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	and this is via vga, not hdmi/dvi ?
2010-06-05T13:57:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	and you don't have DVI? In my experience EDID usually works on DVI
2010-06-05T13:57:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	look here http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Modeline_Database and try some of those modelines
2010-06-05T14:03:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	spend another 10USD for a DVI cable and you'll get better picture and easier to get it to work.
2010-06-05T14:03:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	my 1920x1200 monitor was detected automatically, no problem at all.
2010-06-05T14:03:00.000Z	Euthanatos	SwedeMike	no DVI=HDMI
2010-06-05T14:04:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	whatever, DVI, HDMI, whatever connectors work for you.
2010-06-05T14:04:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Euthanatos	ok then, you seem to know best. Have a nice life.
