2012-03-22T00:42:00.000Z	AcidRain		you can use 32bit on a 64bit machine. just not 64 on a 32
2012-03-22T00:43:00.000Z	Code_Factory	AcidRain	I know.. thanx :) I'm just trying to get the best performance
2012-03-22T00:43:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	well i use a 64bit ubuntu.  and i would say im very pleased with it. my advice is to get 11.04 if you hate unity.
2012-03-22T00:43:00.000Z	Code_Factory		c_smitch: thnx for the tip..
2012-03-22T00:44:00.000Z	Code_Factory	AcidRain	hmm what is unity?
2012-03-22T00:44:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	sorry. im acutally using 10.04 LTS lucid linux
2012-03-22T00:44:00.000Z	Code_Factory		you guys think I'll have a problem with virtulization
2012-03-22T00:44:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	unity is a horrible desktop interface that trys to copy windows
2012-03-22T00:45:00.000Z	Code_Factory	AcidRain	thnx.. but no thnx :D
2012-03-22T00:45:00.000Z	AcidRain		fortunately, 10.04 was the last release (that i know of) that uses the classic gnome2 desktop
2012-03-22T00:45:00.000Z	Code_Factory		ok.. another question, what happens if I install lucid Lynx!! I already have a copy
2012-03-22T00:46:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	well i get updates still. and i am very pleased with it. very fast desktop
2012-03-22T00:46:00.000Z	AcidRain		then again, i have quadcore with 8gig memory :)
2012-03-22T00:46:00.000Z	Code_Factory	AcidRain	Nice ;) anyway, I can't opt out of unity with 11.10 and just use gnome / kde
2012-03-22T00:46:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28user_interface%29
2012-03-22T00:47:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	there is a gnome/kde package in repos for 11.04 and up. but... you will be very sad when you see the poor attempt to make gnome run under unity
2012-03-22T00:48:00.000Z	AcidRain	Code_Factory	it will take alot more  modifications to a unity desktop to make it look like gnome than what you think. i had horrible crying experience in which i stayed up late, did bad drugs, and cut myself
2012-03-22T00:48:00.000Z	AcidRain		:)
2012-03-22T00:49:00.000Z	Code_Factory	AcidRain	thnx a million you've been a gr8 deal of help
