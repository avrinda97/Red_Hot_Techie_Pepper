2008-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	I have looked at both that one and the easy to read one.
2008-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	apt-cache search packagename
2008-05-14T14:41:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	no, what software is it ? I will check the source package myself
2008-05-14T14:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	apt-cache search libqt dev
2008-05-14T14:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	I have read libgt, sorry, may had been my eyes :P
2008-05-14T14:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	I will try to build a .deb myself, but don't wait for it :P
2008-05-14T14:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	btw, that package provides .deb building rules
2008-05-14T14:48:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	I don't know exactly what that means.
2008-05-14T14:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	if you have some minutes to wait a may provide a .deb built for hardy
2008-05-14T14:55:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	I downloaded autoconf (which took forever,) but couldn't get it to generate a config file (my error or program's error, I do not know?), so that I could just download the dependencies.
2008-05-14T14:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	kajo	that software is python based, it does not use autoconf
2008-05-14T14:57:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	what is the debscripts package, and what will that do?
2008-05-14T14:59:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	you keep spelling my name wrong. xD
2008-05-14T15:02:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	did you see the above pasted?
2008-05-14T15:05:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	I'd like that .deb anyways when you are done, I have hardy on my desktop (this is my older laptop)
2008-05-14T15:06:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	command not found. :(
2008-05-14T15:07:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	it won't work on feisty, period?
2008-05-14T15:07:00.000Z	kajo	joaopinto	did you make that .deb for hardy?
