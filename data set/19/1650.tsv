2011-10-16T19:15:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	You can always: sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop...
2011-10-16T19:15:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	aah that way ok
2011-10-16T19:15:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	Then you'll have both.
2011-10-16T19:15:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	Also, you can also apt-get install a xubuntu desktop
2011-10-16T19:16:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	ok tnx

2011-10-16T19:18:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	Is this lubuntu new release?
2011-10-16T19:18:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	never heard of it even
2011-10-16T19:19:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	Pretty much.
2011-10-16T20:37:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	I believe you mean, "Will ubuntu run better if I do SO and SO"
2011-10-16T20:38:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	yep is there any diffrence from lucid to 11.10 with speed in gnome ?
2011-10-16T20:39:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	I can only mention that while quite a few things were improved, a few problems appeared that lucid users never experienced.
2011-10-16T20:39:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	dunno really i should try lubuntu then
2011-10-16T20:41:00.000Z	Ibis	wilhart	Lubuntu is nice, fast too. Synopic package manager is what you use to install softwares with, unless you like to install apps from terminal using apt-get install command
2011-10-16T20:41:00.000Z	wilhart	Ibis	yep
