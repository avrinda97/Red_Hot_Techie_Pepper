2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	Aggort		ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ badblocks -n -s -v /dev/hda/
2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	Aggort		badblocks: Not a directory while trying to determine device size
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	castoff	Aggort	use it on a partition not a device
2007-01-07T12:12:00.000Z	castoff	Aggort	i.e. badblocks /dev/hda1
2007-01-07T12:12:00.000Z	Aggort		ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ badblocks -n -s -v /dev/hda
2007-01-07T12:12:00.000Z	Aggort		badblocks: Permission denied while trying to determine device size
2007-01-07T12:12:00.000Z	Aggort		why would permission be denied.... castoff: I need to do the whole device sorry
2007-01-07T12:14:00.000Z	castoff	Aggort	not sure you can
2007-01-07T12:14:00.000Z	Aggort	castoff	Well somehow I need to find out if anything at the evry begining of the drive is corrupted
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	Aggort	castoff	Even doing it by partition the device size still gets checked
2007-01-07T12:16:00.000Z	castoff	Aggort	i just read the manpage and it says by partition basically, it is how I have always used it
