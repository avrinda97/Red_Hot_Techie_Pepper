2008-02-11T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	tribaldata	why are you launcing it as root
2008-02-11T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	tribaldata	forget running it as root. Open a terminal as a non-privileged user and type "firefox"
2008-02-11T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	tribaldata	nothing launched, what about the command prompt, anything out of that
2008-02-11T21:15:00.000Z	tribaldata	ikonia	: tribaldata@tribaldata:/usr/lib/firefox$ firefoxtribaldata@tribaldata:/usr/lib/firefox$
2008-02-11T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	tribaldata	"which firefox"

2008-02-11T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	tribaldata	so as a nonprivileged user do "/usr/bin/firefox"
2008-02-11T21:18:00.000Z	tribaldata	ikonia	yeah but this doesn't work, it is not starting anything i try doing this then ps -aux | grep firefox and grep come back with nothing
