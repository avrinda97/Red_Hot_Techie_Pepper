2009-04-18T03:15:00.000Z	LiraNuna		/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGL
2009-04-18T03:15:00.000Z	LiraNuna		anyone has a clue?
2009-04-18T03:15:00.000Z	vocx	LiraNuna	what are you trying to do?
2009-04-18T03:16:00.000Z	LiraNuna		I'm trying to compile an OpenGL application
2009-04-18T03:16:00.000Z	LiraNuna		I'm a developer, and I switched to 64bit,
2009-04-18T03:16:00.000Z	LiraNuna		it can't find opengl libraries..
2009-04-18T03:17:00.000Z	vocx	LiraNuna	Have you installed the developer packages, eh, developer?
2009-04-18T03:17:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	what do you think?
2009-04-18T03:17:00.000Z	vocx	LiraNuna	NO
2009-04-18T03:17:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	libglu1-mesa-dev is already the newest version.
2009-04-18T03:19:00.000Z	vocx	LiraNuna	you need several packages, like freeglut, libglut and so
2009-04-18T03:19:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	why would I need freeglut for openGL?
2009-04-18T03:19:00.000Z	LiraNuna		glut is libglut (-lglut) NOT -lGL
2009-04-18T03:20:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	uh, seems like I need to use the libraries for my graphic card, installing nvidia-glx-180-dev worked...
2009-04-18T03:21:00.000Z	vocx	LiraNuna	I see.
2009-04-18T03:22:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	that's weird, on 32bit I don't need to install anything else
2009-04-18T03:24:00.000Z	vocx	LiraNuna	you should check specifically which libraries it is liking, and see if they are contained in the same packages.
2009-04-18T03:24:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	it wants /usr/lib/libGL.so - aka -lGL
2009-04-18T03:25:00.000Z	LiraNuna	vocx	libglu-mesa1-dev also provides it, but it didn't work; seems like I need my driver's libGL
