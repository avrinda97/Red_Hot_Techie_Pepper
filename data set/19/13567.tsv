2005-03-06T09:42:00.000Z	ssam		frafraxy thats not easy
2005-03-06T09:42:00.000Z	ssam		maybe it isnt so hard
2005-03-06T09:42:00.000Z	ssam		i couldn't do it when i tried a while ago
2005-03-06T09:44:00.000Z	ssam		i think realmedia files where the problem
2005-03-06T09:45:00.000Z	ssam		only the horrible player from real could do them, and then you'r have to hijack the sound from the sound card
2005-03-06T09:47:00.000Z	ssam		does mplayer do realmedia files?
2005-03-06T09:47:00.000Z	ssam		thats cool
2005-03-06T09:49:00.000Z	ssam		the open souce ati driver seems ok for me
2005-03-06T09:49:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	is it in apt? if not, where do i get it?
2005-03-06T09:52:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	well that's there already
2005-03-06T09:52:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	perhaps i need some gl-stuff
2005-03-06T09:55:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	291FPS
2005-03-06T09:58:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	yes, warty
2005-03-06T09:59:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	well maybe i should.. but it should work in xfree too, though :P
2005-03-06T10:07:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	ah
2005-03-06T10:07:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	i also checked a bit around and i'm gonna try to set Driver "r128" now...
2005-03-06T10:08:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	brb, gonna try the driver thing
2005-03-06T10:19:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	 i get 690 FPS i glxgears now, is that acceptable?
2005-03-06T10:20:00.000Z	Medrakil	ssam	allright, then it's probably decent
