2007-10-11T05:13:00.000Z	Innomen	tom__	i usta play armored core, the game has 64000 parts give or take, and i usta say mechs are like snowflakes as a result, and then i realized computers have far more than 64000 so the same must apply, thank you :)
2007-10-11T05:26:00.000Z	Innomen	tom__	ok the drivers are in use but now i cant drag around windows, shrink them, alt tab, etc
2007-10-11T05:27:00.000Z	Innomen	tom__	 and the irc windows covers everything so whatever you tell me to do i'll have to leave to do it.
