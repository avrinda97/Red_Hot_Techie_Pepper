2005-08-11T12:26:00.000Z	hondje		does that make all the inodes contiguous, cafuego ?
2005-08-11T12:27:00.000Z	hondje		hmm
2005-08-11T12:29:00.000Z	hondje		defrag says it only does ext2, minix and xiafs
2005-08-11T12:30:00.000Z	hondje		Take one for the team, man
2005-08-11T12:31:00.000Z	hondje		hmm, defrag doesn't support vfat, and dosfstools doesn't make inodes contiguous ... what shall hondje do?
2005-08-11T12:32:00.000Z	hondje		:-)
2005-08-11T12:33:00.000Z	hondje		!tell Keegan about repos
2005-08-11T12:34:00.000Z	hondje		voila!
2005-08-11T12:34:00.000Z	hondje		that's lame
2005-08-11T12:34:00.000Z	hondje		it's the 21st century, why doesn't it take care of itself
2005-08-11T12:35:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	hondje	use mkfs.vfat   and just use the format command to clean it up
2005-08-11T12:35:00.000Z	hondje	Linux_Galore	Wouldn't that delete the data, though?
2005-08-11T12:35:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	hondje	well what are you trying to do ??
2005-08-11T12:36:00.000Z	hondje	Linux_Galore	make the inodes contiguous on my mp3 player, which mounts as an external usb drive
2005-08-11T12:37:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	hondje	the fs is defined by the players firmware
2005-08-11T12:37:00.000Z	hondje	Linux_Galore	It's vfat
2005-08-11T12:37:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	hondje	yeah but there is vfat and then there is somthing that looks like vfat thanks to some firmware
2005-08-11T12:48:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	hondje	nope no work at all....Ive got crossover, theres an install wizard that does the whole lot for you...download quicktime installs it and links it in
2005-08-11T13:37:00.000Z	hondje	Linux_Galore	buntu
