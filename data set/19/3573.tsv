2010-02-03T06:15:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		someone posted an awesome link about conky the other day
2010-02-03T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 thers dozens of sites with conky scripts/examples
2010-02-03T06:16:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	yeah
2010-02-03T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 my own scripts are at http://drop.io/dr_willis
2010-02-03T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 but thiose are modified from ones i got from the conky formus/homepages
2010-03-19T05:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 what is it even supposed to be? ive never seen that extension befor
2010-03-19T05:53:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	it's a python installer
2010-04-03T13:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 often  java --jar foo.jar  i thought
2010-04-03T13:02:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	it didn't work :I
2010-04-03T13:02:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	:D I just had to right click and choose to run with java
2010-04-14T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 ages ago i found a X modeline generator web site.  and used that. but   There may be better ideas in the forums.  KVM's are often a problem i hear.
2010-04-14T06:42:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	do you think manually adding resolution to xorg.conf would fix my problem anyway?
2010-04-14T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 thats how others have handled it in the past. but Ive never used a KVM switch. so no personal experioence with it
2010-04-14T06:43:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	the other side of the kvm is plugged into an xbox360, and it finds the resolution fine on that
2010-04-14T06:43:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Dr_Willis	oh...well okay
2010-11-06T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 yes. you can.
2010-11-06T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 but the chipsets of the cards can make the task harder,. or easier..
2010-11-06T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 for my nvidia system . took all of 10 sec...
2010-11-06T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shazbotmcnasty	 depends on your chipset.. with nvidia.. its easy.
