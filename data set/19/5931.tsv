2008-05-01T11:57:00.000Z	Bidget		or how do I undo what I've done
2008-05-01T11:57:00.000Z	Bidget		it says right at the top of the file "this file MUST be edited with the visudo command as root"
2008-05-01T11:58:00.000Z	Bidget		how do I fix visudo?
2008-05-01T11:58:00.000Z	FastZ	Bidget	just type :quit! and it will exit out without saving anything you have changed
2008-05-01T11:59:00.000Z	Bidget	FastZ	ok, so how do I add a line to it? I have to add in "ALL ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/g15daemon"
2008-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	FastZ	Bidget	when you type 'sudo visudo' you're opening the file to edit with the program 'vi' or possibly 'vim'.  I would suggest searching for a good crash-course tutorial in vi basics.  but to edit a file, you first have to enter insert mode... after you open the file press the Insert key, make your changes, then press the Esc key to get out of insert mode.  then type :wq to exit and save the file
2008-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	Bidget	FastZ	thank you
2008-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	FastZ	Bidget	no prob
2008-05-01T12:03:00.000Z	FastZ	Bidget	as fde said, you can also type 'vitutor' at the command line and it will run you through a tutorial of how to use vi
2008-05-01T12:04:00.000Z	FastZ	Bidget	cant use your arrow keys in vi
2008-05-01T12:09:00.000Z	FastZ	Bidget	you might want to try editing the file in gedit.  'gksu gedit /etc/sudoers'
2008-05-01T12:10:00.000Z	Bidget	FastZ	it says right in the file that I cant do that
