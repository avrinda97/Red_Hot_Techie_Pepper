2005-09-28T13:06:00.000Z	AndieB		I have a laptop, IBM Thinkpad on which I have installed Ubuntu Linux 5.04 Hedgehog. I have a slight question. When I choose "shutdown", the system takes the computer DOWN, but I never goes so far to really "power-off" so to speak. Anyone got an idea?
2005-09-28T13:07:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	if/when this apt-get install finishes pulling down Kubuntu-desktop, I'll "shutdown" my gateway notebook and see if I have the same problem
2005-09-28T13:07:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	I suspect it has to do with a bios ACPI setting, but I'm definatly not an expert on the subject
2005-09-28T13:09:00.000Z	AndieB	Absenth	Well, when it was Windows XP installed on the laptop, it worked fine...
2005-09-28T13:09:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	I know the shutdown feature works great in my XP install.  I'm just not sure how ubuntu hoary deals with it.  I figured I'd check it out and let you know.
2005-09-28T13:09:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	I'm dual booting XP-Pro and Hoary currently.
2005-09-28T13:10:00.000Z	AndieB	Absenth	I really thankfull!
2005-09-28T13:10:00.000Z	AndieB	Absenth	Ah, I just kicked out XP and running "pure" Ubuntu... :D
2005-09-28T13:11:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	I manage a Windows network.  There aren't many domain administration tools avalible on the linux side, short of installing a Samba server, joining it to the domain, and doing administration that way.
2005-09-28T13:11:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	at the same time, there are very few Good network analysis tools that are free or cheep for windows:)
2005-09-28T13:12:00.000Z	AndieB	Absenth	Ah, I get it. But isn't it possible to just administer the Domain via a LDAP tool that is available on the Linux?
2005-09-28T13:12:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	it is.
2005-09-28T13:13:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	I just haven't had the time to figure out how to get openLDAP working correctly.
2005-09-28T13:13:00.000Z	AndieB	Absenth	Ah, I C... :D
2005-09-28T13:13:00.000Z	Absenth		I just want to know how to change the background between the GDM login, and the Desktop
2005-09-28T13:14:00.000Z	Absenth		it's brown, and boring.   would that be a gnome "splash screen" from art.gnome.org?
2005-09-28T13:15:00.000Z	Absenth		ok BRB, AndieB I'll let you know how the "shutdown" goes on my Centrino based Gateway
2005-09-28T13:16:00.000Z	AndieB	Absenth	Do you know where I can find the "boot up" script for Linux, like the old fashioned Windows 95 autoexec.bat? So I can manage what DAEMONs to autostart when powering up my linux box?
2005-09-28T13:19:00.000Z	Absenth	AndieB	Went down like a champ in my case
