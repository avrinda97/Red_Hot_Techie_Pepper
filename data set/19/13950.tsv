2005-04-10T05:00:00.000Z	zapada		Someone already told me that I should install the GCC and kernel header files... but they are already installed
2005-04-10T05:02:00.000Z	zapada		can anyone helpme?

2005-04-10T05:03:00.000Z	zapada	Burgundavia	someone already told me to get gcc and the kernel headers installed, but they already were
2005-04-10T05:04:00.000Z	zapada	Burgundavia	I also tried this while using the live cd... maybe that makes a diff?
2005-04-10T05:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	it is looking for the kernel source, which is not there
2005-04-10T05:04:00.000Z	zapada	Burgundavia	is that because im running the live cd?
2005-04-10T05:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	you would have to download that as well
2005-04-10T05:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	what are you trying to install?
2005-04-10T05:05:00.000Z	zapada	Burgundavia	linuxant drivers for my 56k connexant modem
2005-04-10T05:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	ah
2005-04-10T05:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	try with the installer
2005-04-10T05:06:00.000Z	zapada	Burgundavia	try what with what installer?
2005-04-10T05:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	I have never used the linuxant drivers
2005-04-10T05:09:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	you need build-essential and the linux kernel source for a minimum
2005-04-10T05:10:00.000Z	zapada	Burgundavia	can I use the symantic thing to get it from CD?
2005-04-10T05:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	zapada	yes, but everything you do will be gone when the power is gone
