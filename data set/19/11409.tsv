2006-01-26T16:58:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	run `id`
2006-01-27T17:04:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	Don't install RPMs on Ubuntu.
2006-01-27T17:04:00.000Z	twan	cafuego	why
2006-01-27T17:05:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	They're not designed for it and will probably break things.
2006-01-27T17:10:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	sudo alien <foo.rpm> will generate foo.deb. You can install the .deb.
2006-01-27T17:11:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	What .rpm is it anyway?
2006-01-27T17:12:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	Go to that page, follow the instructions.
2006-01-27T17:13:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	Does it also fail if you run the init script by hand?
2006-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	cafuego	twan	yes
