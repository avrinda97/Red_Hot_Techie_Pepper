2010-09-05T10:50:00.000Z	fujiosan		I have an Intel mac normally i would use wubi to install the ext3/4 filesystem of ubuntu in ntfs5 on win7, but on the intel Mac unlike on the PC this doesnt seem to work, is there another way of installing Ubuntu on the intelMac that avoids having to use grub?

2010-09-05T10:52:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	have you had a look at refit?
2010-09-05T10:52:00.000Z	fujiosan	chris_osx	nope what is it?
2010-09-05T10:53:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	the software that lets you triple boot mac os x , linux and win
2010-09-05T10:53:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	google refit
2010-09-05T10:53:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	you can also dual boot macosx/win or macosx/linux
2010-09-05T10:54:00.000Z	fujiosan	chris_osx	yeah im already dual booting osx/win
2010-09-05T10:55:00.000Z	fujiosan	chris_osx	how can i dualboot osx/ubuntu without refit?
2010-09-05T10:56:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	i think that will not work properly
2010-09-05T10:56:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	go with refit
2010-09-05T10:57:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	np. refit is really the way to go for mac users
2010-09-05T10:57:00.000Z	chris_osx	fujiosan	not just my personal view
