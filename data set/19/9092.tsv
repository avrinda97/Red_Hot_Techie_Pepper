2009-07-13T03:01:00.000Z	jrib		In my custom keyboard layout, can I have a key press correspond to the same as alt+SOMEKEY?  Or is there some way to have altGr act as alt when a 3rd level does not exist?
2009-07-13T03:03:00.000Z	arand	jrib	look in layout options in keyboard prefs
2009-07-13T03:05:00.000Z	jrib	arand	okay, I'm there, which option should I try?
2009-07-13T03:22:00.000Z	arand	jrib	sorry for delay, the "key for 3rd level"-options might make something happen...
2009-07-13T03:25:00.000Z	jrib	arand	I have my right alt  as the third-level-chooser (not using this dialog though) but I am trying to make it so that if I hit right-alt and some other key it still acts as alt plus that key
2009-07-13T03:25:00.000Z	jrib	arand	when there is no third level of course
2009-07-13T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	arand	cdimages.ubuntu.com should have them
2009-07-13T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	arand	or releases.ubuntu.com
2009-07-13T18:44:00.000Z	arand	jrib	like I said, I only saw the DVDs there.
2009-07-13T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	arand	no, you didn't say where is "there" :)
2009-07-13T18:46:00.000Z	arand	jrib	ah, I took "ubuntu's servers" as implying that, as opposed to "ubuntu's homepage"... but anyways, so they're gone then?
2009-07-13T18:47:00.000Z	jrib	arand	did you check the second link I gave you (they are there)?
2009-07-13T18:47:00.000Z	arand	jrib	um yes, stupid me nevermind...
2009-07-13T18:48:00.000Z	arand	jrib	Why is cdimage and releases different and unlinked? hmm...
2009-07-26T22:13:00.000Z	arand	jrib	Has relevant ppl been notified?
2009-07-26T22:13:00.000Z	jrib	arand	yes
2009-08-15T22:08:00.000Z	arand	jrib	sorry about the afk before, since I had open conversations I thought it would be the least rude way to leave them.
2009-08-15T22:09:00.000Z	jrib	arand	oh didn't realize, that's fine
2009-10-30T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	arand	they should be listed there.  If you prefer, just edit /etc/apt/sources.list and run « sudo apt-get update »
