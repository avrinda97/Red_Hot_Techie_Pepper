2011-02-10T04:09:00.000Z	matt___		okay.... so you guys are probably going to be sick of a question like this... but I am completely new.  I went to the home page for Ubuntu, downloaded the .iso, burned it to disk, stuck it in the machine I am going to install it on... and got  "No init found. Try passing init=bootarg."  I have no clue what to do from there
2011-02-10T04:10:00.000Z	matt___		burned with sonic in Windows XP...loaded it as an iso disk image
2011-02-10T04:11:00.000Z	matt___		no clue what you mean
2011-02-10T04:11:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	an MD5 sum is an algorithm to make sure the file you downloaded is downloaded correctly, with no parts corrupted
2011-02-10T04:12:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	there are a couple programs for Windows XP that can check to make sure that the md5 is correct on the iso.
2011-02-10T04:14:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	the Ubuntu website has the md5 checksum of the iso
2011-02-10T04:17:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	if you don;t have a usb stick don't listen to anyone who wants you to use one
2011-02-10T04:17:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	do you still have the file you downloaded on the computer?
2011-02-10T04:19:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2011-02-10T04:29:00.000Z	matt___	nillerz	It checked the same
2011-02-10T04:31:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	burn at*
2011-02-10T04:34:00.000Z	matt___	nillerz	when I was trying to fgure out what it meant... i kept getting so much info that is way beyond me.  I dont know console... people were saying it had something to do with the install... i am trying to install this on a brand new hard drive
2011-02-10T04:35:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	you'll get that, let me try looking for one specific to this condition
2011-02-10T04:36:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	most people are solving this error on already installed systems by using a file-system check, "fsck"
2011-02-10T04:37:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	os CDs are very sensitive and generally won't work if a few bytes didnt copy well
2011-02-10T04:38:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	the one on the download page would probably work great
2011-02-10T04:48:00.000Z	matt___	nillerz	should I burn it slower than max?  just in case...
2011-02-10T04:48:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	slow as possible
2011-02-10T05:37:00.000Z	nillerz	matt___	how'd it work?
