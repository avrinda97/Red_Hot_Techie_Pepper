2009-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	LetsGo67		My DVD ripped all the way to 51 minutes, then failed: what's wrong?
2009-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	is there still room on the drive?
2009-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	I mean was there room for the DVD rip to fit on the hard drive?
2009-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	LetsGo67	weternal	plenty, the encoded 51 minutes Theora file is only 600 megs, I have over 40 gigs left.
2009-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	LetsGo67	weternal	could it be the dual-layer transition?
2009-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	it's possible... what program are you using to rip?
2009-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	what's the program you're using, I'm pretty sure you can write an ISO using Brasero
2009-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	what option did you choose in Brasero?
2009-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	does ardchoille's solution work? come back if you need more help
2009-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	the 1:1 copy should be what you want
2009-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	dvdshrink defaults to a compressed version of the dvd
2009-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	It could be copyprotected
2009-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	I'm not sure about the
2009-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	don't know, don't own either
2009-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	I lost the train of thought here, how's the DVD ripping going?
2009-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	if you put our username in your responses it makes it easier for us to follow along :) for future reference
2009-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	I've never used that package, but It think that ardchoille recommended it
2009-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	I'm not sure... never used a screen recorder--if you don't have ethical objections perhaps a torrent would be less work
2009-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	weternal	LetsGo67	what's eseven73
