2007-10-31T04:09:00.000Z	chris85		Hello, is it possible to create a new partition after ubuntu is already installed?
2007-10-31T04:10:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	through gparted yes, but i'm fairly certain you can't do it while you're using any of the partitions you'd modify, and even if you could, it's a bad idea, use the GParted liveCD
2007-10-31T04:12:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	putting windows on your computer AFTER ubuntu is a recipie for a pain in the ass because windows overwrites GRUB, you'd have to restore it via a liveCD in order to continue using both windows and Ubuntu
2007-10-31T04:12:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	i've done it before, but needless to say, it sucked
2007-10-31T04:14:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	pretty much, if you installed windows first and left room for an ubuntu partition, you should be able to just install ubuntu and it will detect the existing windows partition and let you choose between the two at boot time
2007-10-31T04:14:00.000Z	chris85	Ademan	i'm having a hard time putting windows on.  Grub won't run the install disk.  (Well, that is what I can gather from googling it all night.)
2007-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	well you should be running the install disk BEFORE it gets to GRUB
2007-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	should be a bios setting
2007-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	chris85	Ademan	I enter bios and hit "Run from disk drive" and grub starts up
2007-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	every bios is different, but at least for me, when i boot up i can hit f2 and choose to boot from the cd drive
2007-10-31T04:16:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	hrm, that sounds right...
2007-10-31T04:16:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	you sure you're selecting the correct drive? (like maybe by disk drive it means your hard drive rather than your CD or DVD drive?)
2007-10-31T04:16:00.000Z	chris85	Ademan	could be.  I'll give it another try.  But grub isn't the defualt now for any OS?
2007-10-31T04:17:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	after you install windows you'll lose grub and you'll have to reinstall it via the liveCD (or just reinstall ubuntu but i figure you won't want to do that)
2007-10-31T04:18:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	i'd definitely google reinstalling grub beforehand, it's not terribly easy (it's not hard once you know how, but the first time is pretty hard)
2007-10-31T04:18:00.000Z	chris85	Ademan	what I want to do is leave my computer like it is with the brand new Gutsy, but LabView (National instruments software) only works in windows, osx and rpm based linux, so....
2007-10-31T04:23:00.000Z	chris85	Ademan	what were you trying to say with that link?
2007-10-31T04:23:00.000Z	Ademan	chris85	i just thought that was the site for the software, and maybe it would have information that would help kylequamme
2007-10-31T04:24:00.000Z	chris85	Ademan	ok, gotcha
