2007-02-27T17:54:00.000Z	tm4		yeah - it's not a major problem. i can usually either reboot or just ctrl+alt+backspace, but occasionally it just revers
2007-02-27T17:54:00.000Z	tm4		!ati
2007-02-27T17:55:00.000Z	tm4		hmm - if i'm using the ati fglrx driver, is there any reason not to uninstall the restricted package?
2007-02-27T17:55:00.000Z	tm4		i'm checking envy out now, as well
2007-02-27T17:56:00.000Z	tm4		guajiro - i am. i may have made a small error some where with xorg.conf. i've been messing with the latest release of beryl
2007-02-27T17:57:00.000Z	tm4		and it worked for a day, then i update and only get the white cube ;)
2007-02-27T17:57:00.000Z	tm4		yeah
2007-02-27T17:57:00.000Z	tm4		i have it working - but i use a cheap hack
2007-02-27T06:00:00.000Z	tm4		guajiro: i noticed that the device is defined twice in there as well. i changed the two device sections to include "fglrx" rather than "ati". i've been nothing but irritated with ati's drivers, but that's beside the point. i just wonder why i occasionally have the mesa drivers rather than the ati drivers. if i restart x it generally works.
2007-02-27T06:00:00.000Z	tm4		guajiro: i may can help you with beryl. i've got a small script running that fixes the white cube issue - do you have an ati?
2007-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	yes I do
2007-02-27T06:03:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	-  I have been trying to get beryl to work for the last 2-3 days now
2007-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	the scripts seem to be running fine...X starts up on :1 and I get the Beryl splash, but the cube is blank
2007-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	yes I wrote the startxgl script
2007-02-27T06:07:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	thanks. I'll give that a shot right now..
2007-02-27T06:08:00.000Z	tm4	guajiro_nj	don't forget to chmod +x /usr/bin/startxglfix and add that to your sessions/startup tab
2007-02-27T06:09:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	this eventually replaces my current startxgl script correct?
2007-02-27T06:10:00.000Z	tm4	guajiro_nj	no leave the current startxgl there - this needs to run in addition to that
2007-02-27T06:20:00.000Z	guajiro_nj	tm4	if you're still here - that script did the trick.
