2009-12-17T05:46:00.000Z	occy	ActionParsnip	k  It's default on OpenSuse... and it's a unique way to manage access to apps
2009-12-17T05:46:00.000Z	occy	ActionParsnip	course i guess gnome menu editor probably finally works now though ;)

2009-12-17T05:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	occy	if you right click the panel and click add item, you can add a few meus, one looks a bit like that. You can always compile it
