2006-07-25T09:29:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	here's the odd bit, I installed mozilla-mplayer, and it only works with ubuntu's build for firefox... I was wishing to use the mozilla build
2006-09-10T05:46:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2006-09-10T05:55:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	I did dpkg-reconfigure gdm, but gdm is still messed up, I manually removed all gdm files, including /etc/init.d/gdm - and taht does not  seem to get reinstalled on it's own
2006-09-10T05:55:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	have you tried sudo apt-get install--reinstall gdm ?
2006-09-10T05:56:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	you noted the missing space, didn't you
2006-09-10T05:59:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	that did not reinstall /etc/init.d/gdm still, maybe that file is not part of the gdm package at all
2006-09-10T06:01:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	i just verified that /etc/init.d/gdm _is_ part of the gdm package
2006-09-10T06:01:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	ok, I purged the package, let me try to reinstall it again
2006-09-10T06:03:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	ah, ok, purge and reinstall worked, but now it can't find the human.xml theme, where may I get that one?
2006-09-10T06:04:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	reinstall ubuntu-artwork
2006-09-10T06:06:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	thanks again, let me know if you're in or around atlanta, I owe you a beer or something
2006-09-10T06:06:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	so support the german brewery industry by buying yourself a Becks :-)
2007-04-19T15:30:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	update-manager -c -d
2007-04-19T15:32:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  update-manager -c -d
2007-04-19T15:33:00.000Z	minerale	stefg	are you sure that requires no gui?
2007-04-19T15:34:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	errrm... i don't know if update manager is installed, if you don't have a desktop at all. But editing edg to feisty in sources-list will do, too
2007-05-01T10:34:00.000Z	stefg	minerale	that would better fit in #ubuntu-offtopic
