2010-05-11T17:20:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	calm down.
2010-05-11T17:31:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	it's how hard your pc is working on average over the past X minutes.
2010-05-11T17:31:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	to be more precise, the CPU load for your box.
2010-05-11T17:32:00.000Z	trungie	s3r3n1t7	what does a load average of 1 mean?
2010-05-11T17:32:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	100% cpu usage for the past X minutes
2010-05-11T17:33:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	the 3 you see in top are usually something around 2, 5 and 10 minutes or so
2010-05-11T17:33:00.000Z	trungie	s3r3n1t7	ive seen load averages of more than 1 sometimes. Sometimes like 4! how can my computer work at 400%
2010-05-11T17:34:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	It's calculated per core, so if you have more cores it can go well over 100%.
2010-05-11T17:37:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	instead of saying you have a question, how about just ask it? We can't read your mind
2010-05-11T17:38:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	I try to answer questions of people who use software I don't use or even heard of, by the use of  a great invention called google ;-) And even so, just ask away and if someone happens to know the answer they'll be sure to answer you.
2010-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	have you tried nesting screen?
2010-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	so run screen inside screen, with the splits inside the second screen?
2010-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	trungie	s3r3n1t7	i do that regularly
2010-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	trungie	s3r3n1t7	it's a mind fck! LOL ^aa^aa O_o!! HEH
2010-05-11T17:48:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	mind your language though, it's still a public channel. However, the nested screens seem to be able to do what you want, don't they? Since you'll either need to run the commands to create the split anyway, a second screen would be sufficient.
2010-05-11T17:48:00.000Z	trungie	s3r3n1t7	sorry, too excited. havent been on irc in 3+ years heh
2010-05-11T17:50:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	trungie	would you mind if we kept this channel to a help channel? I'm sure they love you in #ubuntu-offtopic.
