2006-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	cecilia		hello
2006-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	cecilia		how can i turn gdm as my default?
2006-04-19T11:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	Instead of kdm you mean?  sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm and that will ask you if you want it to be default.
2006-04-19T11:31:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	yes. but i did it once editing a file where i just have to change kdm for gdm, but i don't remember which was the file name.
2006-04-19T11:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	Ah, yes.  Neither do I, but I know what you mean.
2006-04-19T11:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	I'll see if I can scrounge something up.
2006-04-19T11:32:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	thx.
2006-04-19T11:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	I am not coming up with it yet.
2006-04-19T11:46:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	I found it right now. It couldn't be more obvious: /etc/X11/default-display-manager
2006-04-19T11:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	Aaargh!  ;)
2006-04-19T11:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	My grepping was having too much output, so I was in the process of trying to pare it down to something managable.
2006-04-19T11:51:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	thank you anyway :)
2006-04-19T11:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	As long as someone finds the answer, right?
2006-04-19T11:54:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	right!
2006-04-19T12:08:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	it didn't work, i had to do dpkg-reconfigure gdm to make it work. :/
2006-04-19T12:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	Really?  I would have thought stopping gdm and restarting X would have done the trick.
2006-04-19T12:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	What exactly did you try anyway?
2006-04-19T12:11:00.000Z	cecilia	tonyyarusso	yep, but I restarted and didn't work
2006-04-19T12:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cecilia	Odd.  Okay.
