2005-06-08T16:48:00.000Z	nern	qweeq	well if you are certain that you have a 64 bit processor then you should be ok, but you might try using the fbdev xdrvr instead

2005-06-08T16:51:00.000Z	nern	qweeq	well i believe the boot parameter would be xdrvr=fbdev ... that is going to tell ubuntu to use the fbdev driver for display rather than vesa, this is sometimes what you have to do on laptops
