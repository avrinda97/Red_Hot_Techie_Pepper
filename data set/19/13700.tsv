2005-05-23T13:09:00.000Z	veritas	HappyFool	If I saved http://pastebin.kaarsemaker.net/39 that code as bat in ~, how would I run it?
2005-05-23T13:10:00.000Z	veritas	HappyFool	No idea. Seveas made that code for me
2005-05-23T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	i don't think you want to run this file
2005-05-23T13:11:00.000Z	veritas	HappyFool	Why not?
2005-05-23T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	you can either do 'bash filename'
2005-05-23T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	or 'chmod a+x filename'
2005-05-23T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	and then ./filename
2005-05-23T13:13:00.000Z	veritas	HappyFool	Do I hve to do the chmod/bash command everytime I want to run it?
2005-05-23T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	no
2005-05-23T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	chmod makes it an executable file
2005-05-23T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	System -> Take Screenshot
2005-05-23T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	not sure what formats it supports, but you can always convert the .png file to .jpg with gimp
2005-05-23T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	see what happens, i'm not sure
2005-05-23T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	no, just rename it
2005-05-23T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	it worked here
2005-05-23T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	i mean, in the Take Snapshot dialog box
2005-05-23T13:48:00.000Z	veritas	HappyFool	Cool, I'll try it
2005-05-23T13:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	veritas	side-scroller with a penguin
