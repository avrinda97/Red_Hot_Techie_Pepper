2006-10-26T14:30:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	ahh. I seem to recall receiving that advice once before too :-)
2006-10-26T14:31:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	you're probably the first one i hear saying that.
2006-10-26T14:32:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	I meant it's less work in edgy than in dapper :-)
2007-01-23T09:58:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	thanks a lot
2007-05-31T14:00:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	find -name "*.zip" | xargs -n 1 mv '{}' .      simulate on a non-critical directory first
2007-05-31T14:01:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	thanks. I gotta learn bash. I tried "find -name *.zip | xargs mv .", but that wasn't exactly correct :-)
2007-05-31T14:02:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	it isn't correct for two reasons at least (maybe mine is not really correct either, mind you)
2007-05-31T14:02:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	I get "foo.zip" is not a directory
2007-05-31T14:02:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	first, you need to quote "*.zip", you can't just type it without quotation marks, because without quotation marks, it will be parsed by the *shell*, while you need *find* to parse it
2007-05-31T14:03:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	second "mv ." after xargs would make xargs execute "mv . <filename>", while you want the other way round
2007-05-31T14:04:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	as for it not being a directory - are you actually quoting *.zip?
2007-05-31T14:04:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	yes. I ran the line you gave me
2008-02-17T21:00:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	no
2008-02-17T21:00:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	bazhang, ok. I'm having sound issues on my laptop, so I'm grasping for straws :-)
2008-02-17T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	backports are usually safe, but still less thoroughly tested than the main repositories. you should enable them if you really know you want them. if you want one single program from backports, you can install just that program. proposed can be very buggy, as they're packages that are published so that they can be *tested*.
2008-02-17T21:02:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	ok.
2008-02-17T21:02:00.000Z	LjL	Ayabara	and when i say "buggy", i meant they can break the rest of the system (especially APT)
2008-02-17T21:03:00.000Z	Ayabara	LjL	I'll stay away for now. Maybe compiling alsa 1.0.16 will fix my issues
