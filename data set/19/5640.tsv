2008-12-02T00:40:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	take a look at "wall".. perhaps you can make it do what you want
2008-12-02T00:41:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	thanks for the suggestion
2010-03-19T02:19:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	have you checked the man page for apt-get?
2010-03-19T02:21:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	reading  man pages, yes, but not exactly sure what it would be called...
2010-03-19T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	try "man apt-get"  then press "/" and type "specific" and press enter.. that should get you to the right place
2010-03-19T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	I think it's pkg_version_number you're looking for
2010-03-19T02:25:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	looking at that now, thanks for the hint
2010-03-19T02:31:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	-t option? not the apt-get install <somepackagename>=<version-number> ?
2010-03-19T02:31:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	as stated, when I use that syntax I get the error stating that the package could not be found... I'm trying -t to target the release I want
2010-03-19T02:32:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	what I'm not able to figure out is how to determine which versions are available
2010-03-19T02:32:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	they might remove packages from the repos when updated ones come in..
2010-03-19T02:34:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	tried "apt-cache madison <packagename>" ?
2010-03-19T02:35:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	thank you, that returns the version I've been installing, so I guess that confirms what I have in the package.
2010-03-19T02:35:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	I think that will return all available versions of a package.. if you only get one hit it might be the only version available
2010-03-19T02:36:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	that being said it appears as though I'm sol and will have to build from source
2010-03-19T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	or try using the main repository.. perhaps it has more versions of the packages available than your local mirror
2010-03-19T02:40:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	I'm using the us.archive.ubuntu.com repo source
2010-03-19T02:40:00.000Z	zanberdo	Slart	are you suggesting there is another source I should consider using?
2010-03-19T02:41:00.000Z	Slart	zanberdo	I'm not sure where the main ubuntu repository is located..
