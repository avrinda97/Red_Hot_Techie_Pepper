2010-06-03T19:53:00.000Z	Shock	kaioken	I want certain partitions to be mounted automatically after I login

2010-06-03T19:55:00.000Z	Shock	kaioken	gvfs-mount does what i need but i can't figure out how to pass it an uuid instead of a device file
2010-06-03T19:55:00.000Z	kaioken		whats is the device name of your partition
2010-06-03T19:55:00.000Z	Shock	kaioken	sda5
2010-06-03T19:56:00.000Z	kaioken		Shock:So you want uuid for sda5?Is it your question?
2010-06-03T19:57:00.000Z	Shock	kaioken	no, i know the uuis of sda5; i want to use that uuid to mount the partition using gvfs-mount
2010-06-03T19:57:00.000Z	kaioken		Shock:I dont know about gvfs-mount But I know how you can mount your partition automatically at startup
