2006-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	Squatch		Quick question, I'm installing Ubuntu for the first time and have an extremely limited knowledge of Linux...  So, sorry if this question doesn't make any sense.  I'm trying to set up how things will be mounted, have a 5GB partition for Root, 2GB partition for Swap, and the rest of a 40GB HDD for whatever else...  Should I mount /var, /usr, /home, and /boot on the 33GB partition or in some other configuration?
2006-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	TimothyP	Squatch	work the other way around :)
2006-09-20T14:10:00.000Z	TimothyP		you can't say how big you're / will be, but you can say how b ig  /home /usr etc... will be
2006-09-20T14:10:00.000Z	TimothyP		for example 20GB for /home ,   2GB for swap , 128MB for /boot would leave you about 17GB for /
2006-09-20T14:11:00.000Z	Squatch		So I have to have dedicated partitions for /usr, /var, /home, and /boot as well as root and swap?
2006-09-20T14:11:00.000Z	TimothyP		no :)
2006-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	TimothyP		you can but you don't have to
2006-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	TimothyP		but since you want to limit the ammount in / .....
2006-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	Squatch		Alright, I was working off some Slackware setup I tried a couple years ago that recommended about 5 different partitions...
2006-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	TimothyP	Squatch	unless your system has a very specific purpose , stick to / and your swap, and maybe a /home if you want that to be on a seperate drive
2006-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	Squatch		So, re-partition it to a 2GB swap partition (for 2GB Ram, that excessive?) and all the rest for root and everything?
2006-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	TimothyP		if you have an older mainboard with a raid controller, where windows is on your IDE hard drive and ubuntu on your sata/scsci drive, I suggest creating a 128MB /boot on your IDE
2006-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	TimothyP	Squatch	 yes that would be good :)
2006-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	Squatch		Nope, it's fairly new, putting Ubuntu on an old 40GB IDE, have Windows on a SATA and a 120GB IDE for data shared between the two.
2006-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	TimothyP		:)
2006-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	Squatch		Cerberus:  Thank you, I'll keep that in mind =).
2006-09-20T14:15:00.000Z	Squatch		Thanks for the input guys!  :)
2006-09-20T14:16:00.000Z	Squatch		So, this is the configuration I've come up with.  5GB for root, usr, var, and boot (BTW, do I even need to specify these or will they just default to the same partition as root?), 2GB swap, and the rest I'm putting home on.
2006-09-20T14:17:00.000Z	Squatch	TimothyP	JoseStefan, Cerberus, Yacc, thanks for the help guys =).
