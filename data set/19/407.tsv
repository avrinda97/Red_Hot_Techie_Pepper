2012-11-27T14:41:00.000Z	akw_		how can i install a program from its source file , i have ubuntu software center
2012-11-27T14:42:00.000Z	akw_		but ubuntu software center cannot read pacakage files ?
2012-11-27T14:42:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	open the package file in file-roller, it should offer to instal it
2012-11-27T14:43:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	 i extracted the tar.gz  , the extraction has a PackageSetup.py file and few folders
2012-11-27T14:43:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	does it have a "README" or "INSTALL" file?
2012-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	have you tried just running the .py file?
2012-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	with terminal window ?
2012-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	yes, a terminal might be helpful :)
2012-11-27T14:48:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	how do i run a .py file ?
2012-11-27T14:48:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	"python " + filename
2012-11-27T14:48:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	ok
2012-11-27T14:49:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	nothing happened ?
2012-11-27T14:51:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	then i don't know. i'd have to find and read the install instructions, maybe you can find better ones. however, if you're new to ubuntu, rather try and find a binary package, then install that with help of file-roller.
2012-11-27T14:51:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	ok one last question , what is a file-roller ?
2012-11-27T14:53:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	i think the menu calls it "Archive Manager". in this usage, it is a program that provides an "Install" button when you give it a .deb package.
2012-11-27T14:53:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	thanks very much for your help , i appriciate it
2012-11-27T14:54:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	btw, if you happen to have a shell open, you can more simply install with just dpkg -i setup.de
2012-11-27T14:55:00.000Z	akw_	Sven_vB	unfortunately it doesn't have .deb extenstion
2012-11-27T14:56:00.000Z	Sven_vB	akw_	that's why i suggested to look for a binary package. it should have .deb then.
