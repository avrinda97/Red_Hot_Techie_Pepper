2005-06-02T07:06:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	that's a kde app isn't it?
2005-06-02T07:07:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	works on gnome as well
2005-06-02T07:07:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	i used it on fc3, which is gnome based as well
2005-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	ok, but it means you have lots of kde stuff in memory as well as lots of gnome stuff
2005-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	well yes, but he asked for the best ;)
2005-06-02T07:09:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	the torrent is down

2005-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	I think you have to use torrent - it's only available on torrent
2005-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	heh, ok. didnt care about the dvd yet :)
2005-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	doesn't azureus have a decentralised tracking technique now ?
2005-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	it does, yes.
2005-06-02T07:13:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	shouldn't the download work then anyway ?
2005-06-02T07:13:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	I didn't try it in azureus, 'cos I hadn't worked out how to install sun java at that point in time.
2005-06-02T07:14:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	ah okay
2005-06-02T07:20:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	open k3b-> click tools-> dvd-> burn dvd iso
2005-06-02T07:21:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	thanks.  obvious really isn't it!  I was looking at the 'project' icons in the bottom left pane
2005-06-02T07:21:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	:) lol np
2005-06-08T09:00:00.000Z	othernoob	dooglus	sudo -i
2005-06-08T09:07:00.000Z	dooglus	othernoob	I asked whether he could "su root" because that would be a test of whether he really had, and knew, a root password.  "sudo -s" doesn't need a root password to even exist
