2006-09-04T11:34:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino		hello, I know that it might be old subject, but I have just installed xgl+compiz and there are no borders at all.
2006-09-04T11:34:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino		can anybody help me?
2006-09-04T11:35:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino		I've already verified processes with ps, and xgl is runing, but there is no compiz.
2006-09-04T11:36:00.000Z	eggman	fabiomazzarino	still got the xgl/compiz problem?
2006-09-04T11:37:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	I'm trying to solve today. I didn't tryied at the weekend.
2006-09-04T11:37:00.000Z	eggman		ok
2006-09-04T11:37:00.000Z	eggman		i had the no borders problem too
2006-09-04T11:38:00.000Z	eggman	fabiomazzarino	does your compiz work?
2006-09-04T11:38:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	not working.
2006-09-04T11:39:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	fglrx gave me some problems, but I had already solved them.
2006-09-04T11:39:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	now I'm trying to run compiz. but it seems to be unable to connect to the server
2006-09-04T11:39:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	Xlib: connection to ":1.0" refused by server
2006-09-04T11:41:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	it's weird because xgl and gnome-panel is running.
2006-09-04T11:44:00.000Z	eggman	fabiomazzarino	you need compiz to be able to do anything with xgl
2006-09-04T11:44:00.000Z	eggman	fabiomazzarino	 you also use compiz to configure the whole eye candy
2006-09-04T11:45:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	I know
2006-09-04T11:45:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	that's why I'm this worry to make it work :)
2006-09-04T11:46:00.000Z	eggman	fabiomazzarino	if you have the 64 bit ubuntu, compiz/xgl needs to be compiled seperately. search in the forum for a thread about "dapper 64bit xgl compiz"
2006-09-04T11:46:00.000Z	fabiomazzarino	eggman	32bits here
