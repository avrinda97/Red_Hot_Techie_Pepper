2009-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	LetsGo67		dvd::rip where does it store extracted files?
2009-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	are you ripping a dvd9 to dvd5?
2009-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	dvd9 = dual layer, dvd5 = single layer
2009-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	LetsGo67	ardchoille	thx.  :)  the dvd I am ripping is dvd9, I am trying to either make ISO or encode it in Theora.  Weternal, selected the "1:1" option.
2009-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	If you're ripping a dual layer dvd to dingle layer size, then there is an app in the repos called dvd95 and it does that. There's also http://dvdshrink.sourceforge.net/
2009-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	ah, ok, nvm then
2009-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	I know that xdvdshrink rips a dual layer dvd to single layer size and outputs an iso
2009-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	I tried several rippers on that particular dvd movie and none of them finished the rip correctly
2009-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	it shrinks a dual layer dvd down to fit on a single layer dvd

2009-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	yes, but none of the rippers worked for that movie
2009-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	That's what I thought

2009-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	you could try acidrip to rip it to an mpeg or avi, I never tried that with wall-e
2009-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	If it's copy protected, I'm not sure acidrip will work either
2009-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	I don't think you're going to be able to rip that dvd. I've become quite the expert at ripping and there just some that you can't rip
2009-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	LetsGo67	you could do that but does recordmydesktop also grab audio?
2009-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	LetsGo67	ardchoille	see above.  :)
