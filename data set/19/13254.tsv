2005-12-28T17:43:00.000Z	MarcN		I have two sets of ~300 scanned photos from a wedding (damn CVS screwed it up the first time) - the photos are close, but not identical and have totally different filenames.  Any tools to find the matching scans?  findimagedup only finds 4 matches and they are right.
2005-12-28T08:21:00.000Z	MarcN		postfix isn't sending email off my system.  Do i really need to do all the mucking the wiki talks about?  I've dpkg-reconfigure postfix and pointed to a local smarthost.
2005-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	which wiki?
2005-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	wiki.ubuntu.com/Postfix
2005-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	that is really overkill, isn't it:)
2005-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	sendmail is easier ;-)
2005-12-28T08:24:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	a personal opinion: install exim4-daemon-light, set it up as a smarthost, then edit /etc/exim4/passwd.client. If all you want is to send mail from your box, that's the easiest
2005-12-28T08:25:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	I'll give it a go.
2005-12-28T08:25:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	I've been using that config on a user box for several years
2005-12-28T08:27:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	heh, just lost what was in the mailq.   i should have figured that.
2005-12-28T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	ouch
2005-12-28T08:28:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	it was only a couple of nautilus bug reports.
2005-12-28T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	well, actually if you didn't purge postfix, the messages may still be there. Getting them is another story :)
2005-12-28T08:29:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	I just did a apt-get install of exim...
2005-12-28T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	then, no purge. look in /var/postfix or something, I would think
2005-12-28T08:30:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	at the rate that nautilus crashes, i'll be able to regenerate those bug reports in no time.
2006-02-21T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	I have som 10,000 rpm 9.1 ibm scuzzies, if you want some
2006-02-21T07:27:00.000Z	MarcN	nickrud	nah, moving away from scsi.
2006-02-21T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	MarcN	well, I was told to throw them around :)
