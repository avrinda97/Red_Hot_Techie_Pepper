2008-11-30T22:15:00.000Z	RugB		how do I get it to always boot into ubuntu?
2008-11-30T22:16:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	in /boot/grub/menu.lst there is a line "default 0" change 0 to whatever your ubuntu is
2008-11-30T22:17:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	numbering starts at 0 and goes up per line that you would see... atleast thats how I interpret it
2008-11-30T22:17:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	how do I find where that is?
2008-11-30T22:18:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	keep scrolling down in that list until you see the bunch of "title, root, kernal" things. Each "title" denotes the os
2008-11-30T22:18:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	so count from there down
2008-11-30T22:21:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	I only have ubuntu installed, I'm off the livecd right now
2008-11-30T22:26:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	ubuntu is the only thing installed right now
2008-11-30T22:27:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	hold on, are you running off the livecd or do you have it installed?
2008-11-30T22:28:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	right now I'm off the livecd because I couldn't get it to boot, but I have it installed
2008-11-30T22:28:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	what happens when you try to boot?
2008-11-30T22:30:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	I get a bash prompt for my login and it continues in bash
2008-11-30T22:30:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	so your gdm isn't starting?
2008-11-30T22:31:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	I guess not
2008-11-30T22:31:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	then booting is probably not your problem
2008-11-30T22:32:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	it sounds like it boots but then gdm (or X) fails to run
2008-11-30T22:32:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	what did you do before it stopped working?
2008-11-30T22:32:00.000Z	RugB	Nith	I put it in Hibernate last night, Brandano: no, 2 the same
2008-11-30T22:35:00.000Z	Nith	RugB	sorry but I can't help you with the problem. Good luck to you and Brandano
