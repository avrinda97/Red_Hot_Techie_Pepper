2012-03-24T15:29:00.000Z	g0th		yeah but I'm telling you I don't have dconf installed
2012-03-24T15:29:00.000Z	g0th		so nothing uses dconf in my case
2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	g0th		ouff
2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	g0th		ok
2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	g0th		but can you promise me that it won't mess up my system?
2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	g0th		because there are two competing systems?
2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	g0th		kde is broken
2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	g0th		gnome-desktop is not
2012-03-24T15:31:00.000Z	g0th		I just don't know how to change the number of desktops
2012-03-24T15:31:00.000Z	g0th		how do I do that with dconf?
2012-03-24T15:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	g0th	 depends on if you are using unity, gnome-shell, or fallback.
2012-03-24T15:32:00.000Z	g0th		I already tried that
2012-03-24T15:32:00.000Z	g0th		it is a bug in the update system probably
2012-03-24T15:32:00.000Z	g0th		I tried for several days
2012-03-24T15:33:00.000Z	g0th		in the end someone suggested that I just try gnome-desktop
2012-03-24T15:33:00.000Z	g0th		that worked
2012-03-24T15:33:00.000Z	g0th		it is still here
2012-03-24T15:33:00.000Z	g0th		I just don't login with it
2012-03-24T15:33:00.000Z	g0th	Dr_willis	unity
