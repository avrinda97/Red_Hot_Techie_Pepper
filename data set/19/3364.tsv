2011-01-31T20:49:00.000Z	Bridge|		anyone know why my nis client on ubuntu (meerkat) keep giving this error: dpkg: version 'nis_2.17-18' bad syntax: invalid character in version number. (this was the version meerkat decided to download from the repositioy, so i dont see why it would be wrong version).... sorry i'm kinda lost here and we've been working on this for a while now with no sucess
2011-01-31T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	is/was NIS working on this machine at all
2011-01-31T20:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	is the bind failure intermitent or all the time
2011-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	we have ypserv running on a centOS box listening, and nis client on ubuntu
2011-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	ok, but does the yp bind on the ubuntu box ever work or does it fail all the time
2011-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	all the time
2011-01-31T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	so it's never worked ?
2011-01-31T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	does the version match with this
2011-01-31T20:54:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	it saays 3.17-18
2011-01-31T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	ok, maybe worth doing an apt-get update, then seeing if apt-cache search nis shows the upgraded version ?
2011-01-31T20:55:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	k i'll try this
2011-01-31T21:04:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	yea i updated apt-get check the version of nis client which is 3.17-31, still getting same error when trying to bind to ypserv on the centOS box
2011-01-31T21:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	just having a little read on version compatabilities
2011-01-31T21:06:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	ypserv version 2.19 (incase u need it)
2011-01-31T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	thank you
2011-01-31T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	can't see anything about incompatabilities
2011-01-31T21:36:00.000Z	Bridge|	ikonia	okay, thank you for trying :-) (sorry for late response had to run down for a little, my son was crying non stop)
2011-01-31T21:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	still looking at other things too
2011-10-04T00:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Bridge|	those are not valid bash arguments or operators
