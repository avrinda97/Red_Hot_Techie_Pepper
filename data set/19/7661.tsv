2007-07-21T11:36:00.000Z	sauvin		then copy what you need from it and trash it.
2007-07-21T11:37:00.000Z	sauvin		You can mount it automatically the same way your current drives mount, you know.
2007-07-21T11:38:00.000Z	sauvin		Windows can do WHAT!?
2007-07-21T11:38:00.000Z	sauvin		Oh, MAN, that's just WRONG.
2007-07-21T11:39:00.000Z	sauvin		Hey... that reminds me... firefox crashes when i try to download a flash plugin. any ideas?
2007-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	sauvin		Burner, that crashed on me to.
2007-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	grab it from the repos, or straight from adobe
2007-07-21T11:53:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	up, just unpack into the proper directory and you're good to go :)
2007-07-21T12:32:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	apt should not mess with /usr/local at all (it's designed that way so you can install your own apps there without worrying about conflicts)
2007-07-21T12:32:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	glad to help!
2007-07-21T13:00:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	yup it does (maybe not in add-remove, but it's in the repos)
2007-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	It's set up by default, but you can always changes it's polling frequency or disable it if desired
2007-08-15T13:15:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	updates will not download or install unless you give the app permission
2007-08-15T13:17:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	as long as you are using the official repos all the updates are tested quite a bit to make sure they don't break anything. I can happen of course...
2007-08-15T13:31:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	Depends on what you want, for most things runlevel 2 is s'ok (for X). The only exception is rc.s for root apps
2007-08-15T13:33:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	just a pre-defined "space" for certain apps to run in. Runlevel 2 is for X for Debian (for other distros it's runlevel 5). If I recall correctly: runlevel 1 is for single-user mode, 6 is for reboot (or shutdown)
2007-08-15T14:34:00.000Z	sauvin	somedrew	why didn't you use synaptics?
2007-08-15T14:34:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	for the touchpad? I'm using the synaptics driver, but it's an Alps touchpad
2007-08-15T14:35:00.000Z	somedrew	sauvin	yup. What's this about. I prefer aptitude myself
