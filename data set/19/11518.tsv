2006-01-09T17:48:00.000Z	cary_	SEJeff	Sorry, user cary may not run sudo on localhost.
2006-01-09T17:48:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	you aren't in the admin group, strange. the admin group is what gives you sudo access
2006-01-09T17:49:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	pastebin /etc/group and /etc/sudoers
2006-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	cary_	SEJeff	dude. i have not done a damn thing. i installed. thats it.
2006-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	I've never heard of that happening, very weird
2006-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	well pastebin it and I'll take a look
2006-01-09T17:52:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	on your system, group id 106 is crontab, on mine, crontab is 107 and admin is 106. That is your problem
2006-01-09T17:53:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	You're going to need to reboot again so that you can edit /etc/group. Change 106 on the admin line to be 113
2006-01-09T06:03:00.000Z	cary_	SEJeff	im back to GUI
2006-01-09T06:03:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	you should have typed sudo -l before rebooting to make sure it was fixed :)
2006-01-09T06:04:00.000Z	SEJeff	cary_	do enlighten me?
