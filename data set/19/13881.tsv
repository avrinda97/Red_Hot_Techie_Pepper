2005-02-19T16:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		this is retarded
2005-02-19T16:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		if I use nvidia now, X sets my resolution to 1024x768
2005-02-19T16:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		there's no way for me to force it to do 1400x1050 (it was doing it prior to rebooting)
2005-02-19T16:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		it goes "huh.  I think 74hz is outside your hsync range so I'm setting it to 70.  Now you can't handle more than 1024x768" .  . . my eyes can't handle less than 1280
2005-02-19T16:11:00.000Z	dreamer	bluefoxicy	I had a similar problem with my lcd, but I just manually set the hsync and vsync + res
2005-02-19T16:11:00.000Z	dreamer		in .Xdefaults or whatever it was ;)
2005-02-19T16:11:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	dreamer	 I set them manually in xorg.conf
2005-02-19T16:11:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		and it was like "OMFG DDC LOOK HSYNC TOO BIG"
2005-02-19T16:11:00.000Z	dreamer		heh
2005-02-19T16:11:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		and set them back
2005-02-19T16:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		and I'm like 'WTF, gimme the ruler, I need to break your hand now'
2005-02-19T16:12:00.000Z	dreamer		that sounds most unhelpful
2005-02-19T16:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		yes
2005-02-19T16:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		(WW) NVIDIA(0): The user specified HorizSync "30.000-74.000" has been adjusted

2005-02-19T16:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	dreamer	 that came out of xorg
