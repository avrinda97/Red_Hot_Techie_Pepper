2005-07-15T13:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Just type that in the command line: dhclient
2005-07-15T13:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79		The router's the important part, hubs don't do DHCP so it doesn't matter.
2005-07-15T13:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		If you have a router, there's a good chance you need to do dhclient
2005-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Hmm
2005-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Do "ifconfig eth0"
2005-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79		And paste output
2005-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79		In #flood if its too long
2005-07-15T13:27:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Is the multiverse repository still deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty multiverse or is there a "hoary multiverse" ?
2005-07-15T13:29:00.000Z	Hikaru79		So "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hoary multiverse" exists?
2005-07-15T08:49:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Does anyone know if there's a deb package for NetBeans 4.1 somewhere in some third-party repository, or if I'll have to install manually?
2005-07-15T08:50:00.000Z	dabaR	Hikaru79	why not get it from the SDK?
2005-07-15T08:51:00.000Z	Hikaru79	dabaR	from the Java SDK you mean?
2005-07-15T08:51:00.000Z	dabaR	Hikaru79	ya, there should be a netbeans install once you install the SDK, is there not?
2005-07-15T08:51:00.000Z	dabaR	Hikaru79	ah.
2005-07-15T08:53:00.000Z	dabaR	Hikaru79	ya, it may be in some third party, did you look at the towers one?
2005-07-15T08:54:00.000Z	Hikaru79	dabaR	yup. Towers is where I got j2sdk
2005-07-15T08:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Hikaru79	how come netbeans, if you dont ,mind me asking, I have not tried it, I use eclipse, is Netbeans good?
2005-07-15T08:55:00.000Z	Hikaru79	dabaR	I've tried both, and I've found I'm *much* more comfortable in NetBeans.
2005-07-15T08:57:00.000Z	dabaR	Hikaru79	I guess I have to try it then, I mean, eclips does the job for me, Im just a student, anyhow...
