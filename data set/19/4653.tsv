2008-11-27T23:25:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	No.
2008-11-27T23:34:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	do you have the Ubuntu CD right now?
2008-11-27T23:35:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	It's the same machine...
2008-11-27T23:37:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	Which is why I want to know everything before I... wait a second.
2008-11-27T23:42:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	Done
2008-11-27T23:43:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	what?
2008-11-27T23:51:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	Yes.
2008-11-27T23:54:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	How do I access my cd from terminal?
2008-11-28T00:02:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	Yeah, the same as DOS.
2008-11-28T00:10:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	"syntax error near unexpected token '('"
2008-11-28T00:10:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	"syntax error near unexpected token `('"
2008-11-28T00:14:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	That's exactly what I tried, but I don't think Terminal likes brackets in folder names.
2008-11-28T00:16:00.000Z	Meophist	rmitchell	Yeah, I'll try that.
