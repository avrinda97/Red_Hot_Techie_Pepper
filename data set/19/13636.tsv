2005-02-20T14:16:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	if you look  with nautilus, do you find your files in /mnt ?
2005-02-20T14:07:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	can you please plug in your memory stick and afterwords open a terminal type dmesg and report the last few lines?
2005-02-20T14:10:00.000Z	ren0	albi1	sda: assuming drive cache: write through
2005-02-20T14:18:00.000Z	ren0	albi1	No not there
2005-02-20T14:19:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	next try ;-) sudo umount /mnt - is there a error message?
2005-02-20T14:25:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	it is a little bit of guessing, i know, but we should figure out where the error could be...so let's try another one:
2005-02-20T14:31:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	we are getting closer :) sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt
2005-02-20T14:34:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	Great! You said, they where automagically recognised, but now, not anymore...did you do something special (upgrade, new hardware....)??
2005-02-20T14:35:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	the magic lies in the so called hotplug-system, which manages "hotplugable" devices as sticks, mice...
2005-02-20T14:36:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	do you have an usb-mouse?
2005-02-20T14:38:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	hmmm strange...
2005-02-20T14:38:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	the second stick was detect automatically?
2005-02-20T14:40:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	because if yes it could be that a module was missing, and because of mounting by had it was loaded...
2005-02-20T14:42:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	has the stick a hardware-lock (a small switch on the side) to write-protect it?
2005-02-20T14:47:00.000Z	ren0	albi1	sdb is automagically being detected. No hardware lock visible.
2005-02-20T14:49:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	could it be possible that there is something wrong with the sticks...?
2005-02-20T14:50:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	hmmmm....
2005-02-20T14:52:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	let's go back to square one: let's umount all sticks: closing all nautilus windows and tkae the terminal
2005-02-20T15:01:00.000Z	albi1	ren0	nice evening...then
