2010-02-28T01:01:00.000Z	dante123		hi all, is there a GUI way to edit startup OS menu....for grub2
2010-02-28T01:02:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	well, using gedit is pretty good... as long as you know what you are doing :D
2010-02-28T01:02:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	there is a command to make it autoupdate; however, I think the file is set as read-only
2010-02-28T01:03:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	I would suggest making a "backup copy" of grub.cfg and then deleting it
2010-02-28T01:03:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	it being the original file
2010-02-28T01:04:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	then from there, running "sudo grub-mkconfig"
2010-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	so, a recap of everything I just said... 1: find the grub.cfg file 2: make a copy of the file 3: delete the original 4: run "sudo grub-mkconfig"
2010-02-28T01:07:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	and of course, if it doesn't work, restore the original from the backup
2010-02-28T01:08:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	ahh, I see what you want to do
2010-02-28T01:09:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	well, someone decided to make the file "read-only" so you can't save :P
2010-02-28T01:10:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	well, not easily
2010-02-28T01:10:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	you can still copy the file and delete the file
2010-02-28T01:11:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	so, make a "backup copy", then make a blank file of the same name "grub.cfg"
2010-02-28T01:11:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	then from there, copy your original file into the new one
2010-02-28T01:12:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	well, we need to make the file writable in order to change boot order
2010-02-28T01:15:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	I would assume it goes by menu order
2010-02-28T01:16:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	I would assume (I never used menuorder)
2010-02-28T01:17:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	you would have to use VIM to edit it though
2010-02-28T01:17:00.000Z	p1oooop	dante123	because gedit doesn't support writing over read-only files
