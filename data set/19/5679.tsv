2008-05-17T18:58:00.000Z	yamanickill		anyone had any exprience with nvidia geforce 8400GS? i'm building a new computer and am gonna use that as my second graphics card for dual screen
2008-05-17T18:59:00.000Z	yamanickill		i find that a lot more bother to set up dual screen than having 2 graphics cards
2008-05-17T18:59:00.000Z	yamanickill		plus, my first graphics card is on my motherboard
2008-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	yamanickill		otherboard is an intel...can't remember model number
2008-05-17T19:02:00.000Z	yamanickill		motherboard*
2008-05-17T19:03:00.000Z	yamanickill		but xmoto works fine with my 7 year old laptop with an ATI graphics card
2008-05-17T19:03:00.000Z	yamanickill		infact, i got compiz-fusion working on this
2008-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	yamanickill		i think my motherboard's built in graphics card only has 1 output...which is why i was getting the nvidia
2008-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	yamanickill		2 secs i'll check the model number
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	yamanickill		you recommend something else? i've not bought it yet
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	bazhang	yamanickill	this is getting a bit offtopic
2008-12-29T23:40:00.000Z	bazhang	yamanickill	sounds like the md5 error
2008-12-29T23:49:00.000Z	bazhang	yamanickill	what are you using to burn this
2008-12-29T23:50:00.000Z	bazhang	yamanickill	to burn the iso
2008-12-29T23:50:00.000Z	yamanickill	bazhang	i used the built in cd burner to burn it to cd, and unetbootin to put it on the usb stick
2008-12-29T23:51:00.000Z	bazhang	yamanickill	then it is likely the media if md5 sum passes as well as the disk integrity check
2008-12-29T23:51:00.000Z	yamanickill	bazhang	but i tried cds, usb drives, and 3 different harddrives
2008-12-29T23:52:00.000Z	bazhang	yamanickill	what I meant was the media (ie cd quality, sometimes are name brand but are in fact counterfeit)
2008-12-29T23:54:00.000Z	yamanickill	bazhang	i tried 2 different brands. and my usb drives are kingston and cruzer
