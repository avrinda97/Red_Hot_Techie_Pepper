2007-04-27T16:19:00.000Z	Zampiela		if I remove iptables, it won't be any firewall in my system, right?
2007-04-27T16:20:00.000Z	Zampiela		if I remove iptables, it won't be any firewall in my system, right?
2007-04-27T16:20:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	why would you want to remove iptables... leave it open...
2007-04-27T16:20:00.000Z	Zampiela		cause I can't connect to anything
2007-04-27T16:20:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	check this: iptables -L
2007-04-27T16:21:00.000Z	Zampiela	aleix	: yes I checked, there's no rule in there
2007-04-27T16:21:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	and what about the default policies? all ACCEPT?
2007-04-27T16:21:00.000Z	aleix		or DROP?
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	Zampiela		I removed iptables, but utorrent still doesn't download anything nor it connects to any peer. Port is forwaded right, tracker is working. what's the problem?
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	anyway, this commands will bypass your firewall: iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	aleix		iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	Zampiela		i removed iptables
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	aleix		iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	no more firewall on your system
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	Zampiela		but it still doesn't connect
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	also you could do: iptables -F; iptables -Z; and iptables -X to erase previous rules
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	Zampiela		but I removed iptables
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	Zampiela		why utorrent don't connect to anyone?
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	aleix	Zampiela	maybe that wasn't your problem, what about you net config? ip, netmask... gateway?
