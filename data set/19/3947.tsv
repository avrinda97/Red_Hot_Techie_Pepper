2009-07-17T22:06:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	it should take a while to run
2009-07-17T22:08:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	did you do it as sudo?
2009-07-17T22:09:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	in the terminal or alt F2
2009-07-17T22:12:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	possible
2009-07-17T22:14:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	there is but I cant think of the top of my head ....  should be something under system ?? about this computer/ubuntu
2009-07-17T22:15:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	then you should be able to upgrade to 8.10 and then 9.04 if you want so not sure why its not working ... do you have an intel video card?
2009-07-17T22:16:00.000Z	Halitech	cdw32	open a terminal and post the output of lspci | grep video
