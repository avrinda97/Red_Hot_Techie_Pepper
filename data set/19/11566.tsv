2006-06-01T07:54:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	as an op, do you have some control over ubotu?  because there should really be a note that the 9200 cards and below can use the open source driver
2006-06-01T07:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	you cn change ubotu factoids
2006-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	e.g. " no, blah is ..... corected version
2006-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	do it in /msg though
2006-06-17T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	assuming you own it
2006-06-17T15:23:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	well, yeah, of course.
2006-06-17T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	else use sudo kill -9
2006-09-18T12:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	you know about the bcm43xx driver, right?
2006-09-18T12:36:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	the bcm43xx driver doesn't work.  i fought with it for a good month before giving into ndiswrapper.  i'd rather have a better supported card
2006-09-18T12:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	hmm - I'm using bcm43xx here with an Apple "airport extreme" Broadcom card without issues
2006-09-18T12:38:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	my issue involved losing the connection every 10 minutes, and often failing to get an IP address.
2006-09-18T12:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	hmm - seems Ok here, although it took me a while to get it working with network manager. I'm only using WEP here though ( home router )
2006-09-18T12:39:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	yeah, i don't like network manager. i have my own custom scripts :-P
2006-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	fair enough - network manager has a ways to go :)
2006-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	netapplet also worked OK for me
2006-09-18T12:41:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	well, i don't really use gnome... or kde... or xfce... and don't really have a system tray up often...
2006-09-18T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	krazykit	right, n-m is useless without X at least ( works in fluxbox, sort of)
2006-09-18T12:43:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	indeed.  iwconfig works well enough, anyway.
2006-09-18T12:43:00.000Z	krazykit	thoreauputic	8.3 :D
