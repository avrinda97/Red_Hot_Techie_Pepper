2010-05-16T00:52:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	sorry I am just looking at your questions.... what tool is indicating you have a bad block, fsck?
2010-05-16T00:53:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	that is from the dmesg log
2010-05-16T00:53:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	what category, kernel, smartctl...?
2010-05-16T00:54:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	i'm sorry, but i don't quite know. how do i find out?
2010-05-16T00:55:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	the bracketed text in dmesg output, like [kernel] or [kvm]
2010-05-16T00:56:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	sorry, i misspoke, the time is in brackets in dmesg output....
2010-05-16T00:56:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	the first thing after the time in dmesg, before the first :
2010-05-16T00:56:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	i'll try finding it
2010-05-16T00:58:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	is ata1.00 what we're looking for?
2010-05-16T00:59:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	that's the first thing after the brackets, but before the :
2010-05-16T01:00:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	yeah, ok, so that's definitely a bad block from the driver.... is this on the disk that has the / file system?
2010-05-16T01:01:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	well, sda has both my windows file system and my backtrack / file system. windows works with no problem, i can access the backtrack / via ubuntu live usb
2010-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	and you said you identified the location of the bad block, or is that what you're trying to figure out so you can fix this issue?
2010-05-16T01:04:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	because local installs of backtrack can be tricky unless you're familiar with the kernel boot process
2010-05-16T01:05:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	well, the bad blocks location i took from the dmesg log. that block is not in any of my partitions. gparted however, does flag that something strange is going on with the EFI-partition. it doesn't recognize it as efi at all actually
2010-05-16T01:05:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	alse, the efi seems to be closest to the faulty block blockwise
2010-05-16T01:06:00.000Z	thedude42	anothernoob	what does parted see exactly?
2010-05-16T01:07:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	gparted shows me a warning triangle next to sda4, which is recognized as an efi-partiton by both windows and fdisk
2010-05-16T01:19:00.000Z	anothernoob	thedude42	you still there?
