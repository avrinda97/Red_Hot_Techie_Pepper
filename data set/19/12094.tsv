2006-01-13T11:22:00.000Z	crouton	gnomefreak	Yes
2006-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	crouton	gnomefreak	question is, do I absolutely need the analog audio cable for the system to even recognize it's an audio cd.  i don't think so, but i'm curious.
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	crouton	sound juicer doesnt open?
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	crouton	gnomefreak	no.
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	crouton	gnomefreak	I get a 'CD-ROM Disc' on the desktop, not Audio CD.
2006-01-13T11:26:00.000Z	crouton	gnomefreak	sound works fine, xmms can play mp3s.  i just can't get audio cds to be recognized at all.
2006-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	crouton	have you tried other cds?
2006-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	crouton	gnomefreak	Yes, several.
