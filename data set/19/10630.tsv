2006-06-02T14:25:00.000Z	UserName14		 This morning I had courier\postfix working perfectly on my system but its not working anymore i cant send pop\imap or login to my inbox I assume ubuntu forgot the Maildir thingy and thats why its no longer working  In telnet i get a ERR Maildir no such file or directory

2006-06-02T14:30:00.000Z	richiefrich	UserName14	 getmail  fetchmail?
2006-06-02T14:31:00.000Z	richiefrich	UserName14	what else do u have installed postfix ?  procmail
2006-06-02T14:32:00.000Z	UserName14	richiefrich	both of the configs seem to be need a system variable that i bleieve is Maildir I just think the Maildir variable has changed breaking the server
2006-06-02T14:33:00.000Z	richiefrich	UserName14	look at this url --> http://www.hypexr.org/linux_mail_server.php#procmail_install  skip all the pacman stuff
2006-06-02T14:33:00.000Z	UserName14	richiefrich	ok, thanks
2006-06-02T14:43:00.000Z	UserName14	richiefrich	I believe the problem is with ubuntu not with my server.......... Like i said from the start Maildir is a variable.... That variable is screwed up if that variable changes back how it was earlier today it will just work I cant even smpt unix mainbox from the same machine like i could earlier (yes the smpt thing works)
2006-06-02T14:52:00.000Z	richiefrich	UserName14	 sorry idk
