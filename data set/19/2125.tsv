2010-07-09T11:15:00.000Z	Vin73		hello, can someone tell me which is the default audio driver that comes with lucid, alsa or oss?
2010-07-09T11:16:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	ubuntu uses alsa. it's whats in the kernel
2010-07-09T11:16:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	oss is not part of the upstream kernel
2010-07-09T11:16:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	is there a command that lists the driver?
2010-07-09T11:16:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	lsmod | grep snd <-- will list the modules
2010-07-09T11:17:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	thanks
2010-07-09T11:19:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	when I run the command, I see that oss is the built-in driver...as part of the command output I see snd_mixer_oss, snd_pcm_oss et al.
2010-07-09T11:20:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	those are emulators for oss
2010-07-09T11:20:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	for old programs that dont speak alsa
2010-07-09T11:20:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	what is the command output that would inform me that alsa is available?
2010-07-09T11:20:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	I don't see any output text that says alsa
2010-07-09T11:21:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	i have patches in the alsa that's in ubuntu's kernel...
2010-07-09T11:22:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	snd_* modules are from the alsa-kernel tree
2010-07-09T11:22:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	ok...so if you see snd_* output, it should inform you that alsa is present, am I correct?
2010-07-09T11:23:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	believe so
2010-07-09T11:24:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	cat /proc/asound/version
2010-07-09T11:24:00.000Z	maco	Vin73	thatll tell you the alsa version
2010-07-09T11:25:00.000Z	Vin73	maco	ok thanks a lot, the reason I asked was I need to install zoiper softphone on my system...and the softphone comes in both oss and alsa variants...so I will go ahead and install the alsa variant...thanks again
