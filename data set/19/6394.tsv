2010-12-29T12:57:00.000Z	kaushal		is there a wiki which says about supported Ubuntu releases ?
2010-12-29T12:58:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	which are supported, you mean?
2010-12-29T12:58:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	yes
2010-12-29T12:58:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
2010-12-29T12:58:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	everything in "Stable"
2010-12-29T12:59:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	Thanks
2011-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	#ubuntu+1
2011-06-12T07:51:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	as in mailing lists? or what?
2011-06-12T07:52:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	yes
2011-06-12T07:52:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	No, but lucid-changes isn't something you send mail to. It's an autopost from Launchpad or something.
2011-06-12T07:52:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	ok
2011-06-12T07:53:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	what is it you're trying to do? (i.e., why were you trying to send that mail?)
2011-06-12T07:53:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sun-java6/+bug/784604
2011-06-12T07:55:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	please suggest further
2011-06-12T07:55:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	That's not going to happen. Ubuntu doesn't upgrade to new major versions of packages after release in most cases. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates for the procedure, though.
2011-07-17T08:46:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	The 5 year support period applies to the base system and specific packages used frequently on servers (e.g. apache) in main and restricted. sun-java6-* is not one of those packages.
2011-07-17T08:47:00.000Z	rww	kaushal	it does not apply to whatever packages you manage to install on an Ubuntu Server installation
2011-07-17T08:48:00.000Z	kaushal	rww	Thanks
