2008-12-30T12:59:00.000Z	kalvin_		says player and workstattions
2008-12-30T13:01:00.000Z	kalvin_		i hvae a version of vmware for ubuntu, but it fails to install, can anyone help?
2008-12-30T13:02:00.000Z	kalvin_		one sec, ill tell you
2008-12-30T13:04:00.000Z	kalvin_		i just do sudo ./vmware-install.pl right?
2008-12-30T13:04:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	that sounds awfully complicated compared to "sudo aptitude install kvm virt-manager" :)
2008-12-30T13:12:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	start it (applications->system tools->virtual machine manager) and then either create a _New_ virtual machine or attach it to an already existing one, the menus should be self-explaining :)
2008-12-30T13:13:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	iso w/ livecd?
2008-12-30T13:15:00.000Z	kalvin_	nonix4	maybe im not doing the right thing, but i want to install windows xp on a virtual machine, i have the windows iso file and now i want to load it up
2008-12-30T13:15:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	I mean is that iso an installer type of iso? If so, you need to decide where you will be installing it as well :)
2008-12-30T13:16:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	3rd button from right at the bottom of the window should be "new", which you can use to allocate disk space for it and so on
2008-12-30T13:18:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	not necessary - above should be a list of currently available VMs, you need to choose which one to use - doubleclick on one of the localhost entries
2008-12-30T13:19:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	are there other localhost entries as well?
2008-12-30T13:20:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	virt-manager can handle at least xen, kvm, qemu... not sure whether it is set up for vmware by default as well.
2008-12-30T13:23:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	ps auwx | grep libvirt # lists libvirtd now?
2008-12-30T13:24:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	that new button should be available at least on the one that said something about libvirtd...
2008-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	well, been ages... but you can try the usual, "sudo /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin start" (possibly after aptitude install of it, if it wasn't already installed)
2008-12-30T13:34:00.000Z	kalvin_	nonix4	thanks a lot i got it
2008-12-30T13:34:00.000Z	nonix4	kalvin_	cool :)
