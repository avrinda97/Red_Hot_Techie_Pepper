2009-08-18T02:22:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	gscan2
2009-08-18T02:23:00.000Z	^Phantom^	maco	my scanner is not supported by xsane
2011-02-07T12:41:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	you're missing the 2 at the end?
2011-02-07T12:42:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	there's also the part where its not in ubuntu's repos for legal reasons. did you add the medibuntu repo?
2011-02-07T12:46:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	repository, not package
2011-02-07T12:46:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	medibuntu.org
2011-02-07T12:46:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	read the webpage
2011-02-07T12:49:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	it only asks if there are extra packages being pulled in
2011-02-10T09:04:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	as long as you dont do an install
2011-02-10T09:04:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	after you get to the live cd you can come back here and ask how to run fsck on the drive and how to chroot into a system to complete an upgrade
2011-02-10T09:04:00.000Z	^Phantom^	maco	sweet, thanks
2011-02-10T09:21:00.000Z	^Phantom^	maco	I am here.
2011-02-10T09:22:00.000Z	^Phantom^	maco	I am ready to fix this now :)
2011-02-10T09:23:00.000Z	^Phantom^	maco	so what do i need to run again?
2011-02-10T09:27:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	my suggestion was to make sure the disk is unounted, then run "sudo fsck /dev/sda1" (do it with each partition) to make sure the filesystem gets into an ok state first
2011-02-10T09:42:00.000Z	maco	^Phantom^	sudo fsck /dev/sdc1
