2009-03-28T02:46:00.000Z	ChotaZ		How can I get my Creative Fatal1ty headset to work on Ubuntu 8.10?
2009-03-28T02:48:00.000Z	ChotaZ		Who can suggest me a good media player for both audio and video files?
2009-03-28T02:49:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	mplayer
2009-03-28T02:52:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Can you see the files listed when you browse it, using nautilus?
2009-03-28T02:53:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	You need to change the filters on the current dialog. Look for a dropdown on the bottom of the window. And change it to Audio files, or all files
2009-03-28T02:55:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Right click -> Properties -> Open with, select mplayer
2009-03-28T02:58:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	ALT + F2, xkill, enter, click on mplayer
2009-03-28T03:00:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Open a terminal, and type in: pkill mplayer
2009-03-28T03:01:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	So, did it close?
2009-03-28T03:02:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	mplayer is good for a terminal based player. The default gui, gmplayer is kinda crappy. For a gui based, I would prefer you go with totem as well
2009-03-28T03:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Totem should automatically find a plugin for you if you don't have one installed
2009-03-28T03:05:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Let me guess. Teamspeak was running in WINE with ALSA, that blocked PA from connecting to your soundcard
2009-03-28T03:06:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Well, if you are running ALSA without the dmix plugin, only 1 application can output to your sound card(provided it has no hardware mixing)
2009-03-28T03:10:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	I don't know anything about teamspeak, sorry
2009-03-28T03:11:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Like I told you. If you are using ALSA without dmix, then any 1 application can only output sound to a soundcard (assuming no hw mixing present)
2009-03-28T03:16:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Getting PA working would be the official choice
2009-03-28T03:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2009-03-28T03:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	You should already have PA... I don't see how you can install it... you need to configure teamspeak properly, most likely. But like I said, I haven't worked with teamspeak before to guide you
2009-03-28T03:22:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ChotaZ	Yeah, that would be the expected behaviour. You can confirm that teamspeak is blocking your soundcard, by running mplayer in terminal, and it will say that it cannot connec to to your sound server. But, like I am saying the third time, i cannot help you
