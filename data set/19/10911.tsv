2006-04-26T12:04:00.000Z	mimm		hi together.. just wanted some help with fluxbox transparency and feh..
2006-04-26T12:05:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	what's up?
2006-04-26T12:05:00.000Z	mimm	_jason	- i cannot run the render on thing
2006-04-26T12:05:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	what render on thing?
2006-04-26T12:07:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	are you using fluxbox from the repositories?
2006-04-26T12:09:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	how did you upgrade?
2006-04-26T12:11:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	ok, well did you install feh?
2006-04-26T12:11:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	huh?
2006-04-26T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	ok well did you set the background with fbsetbg?
2006-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	mimm	_jason	- yes, i have it.. and i think something from gnome WM /also installed/ makes my term to get also transparent.. but in menus, slit, toolbar, and windows nothin..
2006-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	I just realized I compiled fluxbox... so I'm not sure if the one in the repos was compiled with support for that or not.  Basically on mine all I had to do was install feh, use feh with fbsetbg -f file, and then restart fluxbox, then I could control transparency
2006-04-26T12:16:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	pastebin what fluxbox -i gives you, maybe we can do some quick research and figure it out
2006-04-26T12:17:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	check your private messages
2006-04-26T12:18:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	actually, just tell tell me what this says: fluxbox -i | grep RENDER
2006-04-26T12:20:00.000Z	mimm	_jason	- not enabled.. thats the point :/
2006-04-26T12:20:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	yeah, I believe you would have to compile your own if you wanted it
2006-04-26T12:21:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	nah not feh, fluxbox
2006-04-26T12:22:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	yeah
2006-04-26T12:22:00.000Z	_jason	mimm	k
