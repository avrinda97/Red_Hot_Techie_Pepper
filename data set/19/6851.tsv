2008-07-01T11:22:00.000Z	t35t0r		lmsensors will complain at 78 by default
2008-07-01T11:23:00.000Z	t35t0r		kernel messages will complain
2008-07-01T11:23:00.000Z	t35t0r		with or without lmsensors
2008-07-01T11:23:00.000Z	t35t0r		that's for CPU
2008-07-01T11:23:00.000Z	t35t0r		i dunno about gpu
2008-07-01T11:24:00.000Z	t35t0r		would be nice if you could test it on _otherOs_
2008-07-01T11:24:00.000Z	t35t0r		or try other version driver
2008-07-01T11:26:00.000Z	t35t0r		http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/HOWTO:_Install_Ubuntu <- lol
2008-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	t35t0r		obviously because devs don't like opera
2008-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	t35t0r		closed source
2008-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	tomasko	t35t0r	if you're not being facetious... why are the devs imposing their will on users?
2008-07-01T11:29:00.000Z	t35t0r	tomasko	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
2008-07-01T11:30:00.000Z	tomasko	t35t0r	completely useless. i've quite obviously read that since i setup apt sources to get me opera...
2008-07-01T11:31:00.000Z	tomasko	t35t0r	i understand that the canonical repositories might lag a bit
2008-07-01T11:31:00.000Z	tomasko	t35t0r	but it's ridiculous that 9.5 _still_ isn't in while firefox's been getting so much attention from frickin' beta
2008-07-01T11:31:00.000Z	t35t0r	tomasko	close source
2008-07-01T11:31:00.000Z	tomasko	t35t0r	that's completely irrelevant
2008-07-01T11:32:00.000Z	t35t0r	tomasko	very relevant
2008-07-01T11:33:00.000Z	tomasko	t35t0r	since you didn't state a reason, i'll take it that you are... again, being mischevious rather than participating in a civil discussion
