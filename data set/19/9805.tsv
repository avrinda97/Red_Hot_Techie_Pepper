2006-09-12T05:49:00.000Z	Rico-		how easy is it to install murrine?
2006-09-12T05:50:00.000Z	Rico-		ah, http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=42755
2006-09-12T05:50:00.000Z	Rico-		it would be nice to package it
2006-09-12T05:51:00.000Z	Rico-		Bli
2006-09-12T05:51:00.000Z	Rico-		*DNS
2006-09-12T05:51:00.000Z	Rico-		that made every site slow
2006-09-12T05:51:00.000Z	Rico-		other question to tunneled X folks: is it as simple as running ssh -X on the remote machine?
2006-09-12T05:52:00.000Z	Rico-		:/
2006-09-12T05:54:00.000Z	Rico-		or is this done automatically?
2006-09-12T05:54:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	After yoy 'ssh -X' you can just run X apps. Note: use 'ssh -C -X' for speed.
2006-09-12T05:55:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	Only if they have vnc or somesuch running.
2006-09-12T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	UOn ubuntu, you can tick a box in the remote desktop prefs to make vnc work.
2006-09-12T05:58:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	Log in to Ubuntu, then 'Preferences -> Remote Desktop'
2006-09-12T05:59:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	After that, you can ssh or vnc in.
2006-09-12T05:59:00.000Z	Rico-	cafuego	can't believe i never noticed that item.
2006-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	Don't; tunnel it over ssh (really!)
2006-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	Rico-	cafuego	oh right, of course. so to clarify this in my stupid brain, ssh -X homepc, vncviewer localhost:0
2006-09-12T06:02:00.000Z	cafuego	Rico-	Yup, or you could portforward (ssh -L 5700:localhost:5700 remotehost; then 'vncviewver localhost' locally)
2006-09-12T06:03:00.000Z	Rico-	cafuego	this seems a bit strange though - tunneling VNC over X. but I suppose you can't do the same thing just using X on its own.
