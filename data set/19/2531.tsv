2011-08-15T20:38:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	See:  http://pastebin.com/MDg0R2Kx  &  http://pastebin.com/ybBS23WG
2011-08-15T20:40:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	I agree but i had a similiar issue until i mounted it as myself
2011-08-15T20:42:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Yea, but shouldn't happen.  I don't know why it's doing this.
2011-08-15T20:48:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	gary mounted it with his uid and it worked
2011-08-15T20:48:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	stupid but it worked for me a while back: sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/LACIE -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137
2011-08-15T20:49:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Ok, well, what is the deal then.  Why is that happening?
2011-08-15T20:49:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	i'm not sure, i think it's a bug.
2011-08-15T20:50:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	my usb drive does the same thing. even if I su to root i can't make any changes to /media/drive1
2011-08-15T20:50:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Ok.  Well thanks for getting him going with it.  (I guess I got hung up on the diagnosis part...)
2011-08-15T20:50:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	but then as soon as i mount it as my regular user, it works great
2011-08-15T20:50:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	all good just glad to help, i spent months on it LOL
2011-08-15T20:51:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Well, maybe someone should file a bug report.  But I suppose it only happens with certain types of drives... or...?
2011-08-15T20:52:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	yea it seems for me to be drives that automatically mount a "cdrom" drive with it
2011-08-15T20:52:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Ahhhh, something amiss in udev ?
2011-08-15T20:52:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	or hald
2011-08-15T20:55:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Probably particular to 11.04 ?
2011-08-15T20:55:00.000Z	thunsucker	usr13	it happened to me on 10.04 and 11.04
2011-08-15T20:58:00.000Z	usr13	thunsucker	Well, I have a 10.04 system and not doing it here, so.... I dono.  Ok well.  Is mystery...
