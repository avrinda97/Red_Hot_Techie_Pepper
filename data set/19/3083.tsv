2009-10-31T01:07:00.000Z	guntbert	Diddleha	what is your real problem?
2009-10-31T01:08:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	Well, i cant code using MC natively on Ubuntu because its not using the correct internal editor. The one you use is not usable at all now (Press F4 on a file, edit and save it)
2009-10-31T01:10:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	See if you can have another compile/version included by default. Id appreciate that very much.
2009-10-31T01:10:00.000Z	guntbert	Diddleha	well - I guess I never used the internal editor of mc - always switched to vim, so I'll be no big help there - sorry - but in earnest: file a bug against mc on launchpad
2009-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	Theres nothing wrong with the MC, it just need a dustoff and return to the roads as we say ;)
2009-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	As a developer i expect this will be fixed.
2009-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	guntbert	Diddleha	I understand - but there are mainly two ways to reach this goal: do it yourself - or - file a bug
2009-10-31T01:13:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	I have compiled it myself for the past years (Since it got borked). Its time to make it work again.
2009-10-31T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	Diddleha	so submit the patch :)
2009-10-31T01:13:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	You see its useless as an editor right ?
2009-10-31T01:14:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	Problem is, that patch will bork German "Umlauts". Im willing to code with someone though.
2009-10-31T01:14:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	We need unity in this area
2009-10-31T01:14:00.000Z	guntbert	Diddleha	this is way off toic now - I never used that editor so I could not say if it was useful or useless
2009-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	I have coded about 15 applications for GNU/other free oses using it. Its good if i dont have to waste time correcting bugs
2009-10-31T01:16:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	Do i have a point ?
2009-10-31T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	Diddleha	:-) - but we are off topic
2009-10-31T01:17:00.000Z	Diddleha	guntbert	Alrighty, now... a terrible thing will befall things if the MC params arent considered.
