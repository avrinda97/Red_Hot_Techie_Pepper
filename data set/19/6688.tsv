2007-12-26T04:16:00.000Z	GMoo		question: does ubuntu come with divx codecs installed
2007-12-26T04:18:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	no. but if you try to read a divx, you'll get a nice message asking you if you want to install them.
2007-12-26T04:18:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	and then if you answer yes, it will install the codecs for you
2007-12-26T04:21:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	same with all standard proprietary codecs really : they are not there by default for legal reasons .. but Ubuntu is rather helpful when you appear to need them
2007-12-26T04:22:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	enjoy ;)
2007-12-26T04:22:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	how so?
2007-12-26T04:23:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	do you mean LAN or internet?
2007-12-26T04:25:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	hmm using Amarok right now .. but it really depends on what you're looking for. Amarok is great if you want custom random  playlists, and generally want an organized way to manage your music.
2007-12-26T04:26:00.000Z	GMoo	sammyF	i was using amarok but had trouble adding music over the network ?
2007-12-26T04:26:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	for fast listening of random files, I use audacious
2007-12-26T04:26:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	yep .. that was my question : what network? LAN?
2007-12-26T04:27:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	hmm .. Can't help you much with that I'm afraid .. only one comp here
2007-12-26T04:27:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	but thanks ... now you reminded me that I wanted to install ubuntu on an old laptop I have upstairs :)
2007-12-26T04:29:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	System->Administration->Synaptic
2007-12-26T04:29:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	actually "Synaptic Package Manager
2007-12-26T04:29:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	use the search button ;)
2007-12-26T04:31:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	yeah ... just try not ot get into a download frenzy ;)
2007-12-26T04:33:00.000Z	GMoo	sammyF	do you have AIM?MSN?
2007-12-26T04:34:00.000Z	sammyF	GMoo	yes, but I don't give away my nick, sorry
