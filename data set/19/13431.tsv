2005-04-16T08:39:00.000Z	Crane		hello
2005-04-16T08:39:00.000Z	Crane		I have a silly question
2005-04-16T08:39:00.000Z	fangorious	Crane	just ask
2005-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	Crane		what do I need to run ro reconfig X?
2005-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	Crane		I add a new card
2005-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	Crane		went from pci to agp now x doesn't work
2005-04-16T08:41:00.000Z	Crane		nvidia
2005-04-16T08:41:00.000Z	Crane		I had nvidia before just pci
2005-04-16T08:41:00.000Z	Crane		nope
2005-04-16T08:41:00.000Z	Crane		have it hooked by KVM
2005-04-16T08:41:00.000Z	fangorious	Crane	I've never used them, but xorgcfg and xorgconfig are the default utilities to configure X
2005-04-16T08:42:00.000Z	Crane		cool
2005-04-16T08:42:00.000Z	Crane		I think just changing from pci to agp messed it up
2005-04-16T08:42:00.000Z	fangorious	Crane	it might be as simple as changing the driver listed in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-16T08:42:00.000Z	Crane		the driver is nvidia
2005-04-16T08:43:00.000Z	Crane		yep thats what I thought, location
2005-04-16T08:43:00.000Z	fangorious		Crane so you just went from a PCI nvidia to an AGP nvidia?
2005-04-16T08:43:00.000Z	Crane		thmmm... hang on I'll get it
2005-04-16T08:43:00.000Z	Crane	fangorious	yep
