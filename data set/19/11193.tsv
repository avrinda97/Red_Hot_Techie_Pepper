2008-09-05T04:58:00.000Z	Fused		Guys, I had Fluxbox 1.0.0-3 installed on my Ubuntu system. Well, I found out that Fluxbox has a newer version (1.1.0.1) and I downlaoded & installed it. Then I removed the 1.0.0-3 version. If I do "fluxbox -v", it shows that I have Fluxbox 1.1.0.1 properly installed; however, when I logout or restart to attempt to change my session to Fluxbox, it isn't in the list of available sessions.
2008-09-05T04:58:00.000Z	Fused		Anyone know what to do from this point?
2008-09-05T04:58:00.000Z	kitche	Fused	make the fluxbox.xsession file most likely
2008-09-05T04:58:00.000Z	Fused		How would I go about doing that, kitche?
2008-09-05T05:02:00.000Z	Fused		Create the file: /etc/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox with contents:
2008-09-05T05:02:00.000Z	Fused		There is no /etc/gdm/Sessions
2008-09-05T05:02:00.000Z	Fused		Desktop.
2008-09-05T05:04:00.000Z	Fused	jrib	/etc/gdm/Sessions doesn't exist as a directory, and that's where it's telling me to put the fluxbox file.
2008-09-05T05:06:00.000Z	Fused		So I need to make one fluxbox.desktop
2008-09-05T05:06:00.000Z	Fused		With the file contents on that page?
2008-09-05T05:10:00.000Z	Fused		Okay. I have the fluxbox.desktop in /usr/share/xsessions
2008-09-05T05:10:00.000Z	Fused		Question, though.
2008-09-05T05:10:00.000Z	Fused		It has "/usr/bin/startfluxbox" in those contents, but there is no "startfluxbox"
2008-09-05T05:11:00.000Z	Fused	jrib	Do you know how to fix that issue?
2008-09-05T05:12:00.000Z	Fused		Edit what?
2008-09-05T05:12:00.000Z	Fused		There's no startfluxbox in /usr/bin/
2008-09-05T05:12:00.000Z	Fused		but there is a startfluxbox in /usr/local/bin/
2008-09-05T05:13:00.000Z	Fused		Should I just change it to go there instead?
2008-09-05T05:13:00.000Z	kitche	Fused	yep
