2010-05-26T21:59:00.000Z	Nijverheid		is there a default keyboard shortcut for opening your home folder in the file browser or do I have to set one myself?
2010-05-26T21:59:00.000Z	Nijverheid		I do
2010-05-26T22:00:00.000Z	Nijverheid		but is there any chance of you answering my actual question? :)
2010-05-26T22:02:00.000Z	Nijverheid		second question, how can I play encrypted .wma files?
2010-05-26T22:03:00.000Z	Nijverheid		totem cries over it, vlc has a good effort but fails
2010-05-26T22:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	have trouble playing a particualr video file?
2010-05-26T22:03:00.000Z	Nijverheid	onetinsoldier	it's an audio file, and yeah, i'm having trouble
2010-05-26T22:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	try 'winff'... see it it will play it
2010-05-26T22:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	try 'winff'... see iF* it will play it
2010-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	Nijverheid	onetinsoldier	will give it a go cheers :) is that software in the repos?
2010-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	yes
2010-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	it will probably work. good luck :-)
2010-05-26T22:11:00.000Z	Nijverheid	onetinsoldier	hur, I think it managed to convert all the files successfully... problem is it squashed all the audio into about a 10th of a second worth of ogg files XD
2010-05-26T22:14:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	hmm, roger. i just use it to 'play' files. haven't tried to convert with it. i do know of an excellent tutorial that guides you through downloading, compiling, making a .deb, of the latest bleeding edge 'svn' version of ffmpeg and x.264 codecs, which winff will work fine with. winff is just a gui frontend to those codecs
2010-05-26T22:15:00.000Z	Nijverheid	onetinsoldier	I'm with you :) I'll try it the other way then
2010-05-26T22:15:00.000Z	Nijverheid	onetinsoldier	thanks for all your help :)
2010-05-26T22:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	sure, you're welcome
2010-05-26T22:18:00.000Z	Nijverheid	onetinsoldier	I just worked out the answer :) transfer the files to the other partition and reboot into windows XD
2010-05-26T22:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Nijverheid	yeah.. of course that will work ;-)
