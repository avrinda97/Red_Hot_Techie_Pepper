2011-08-14T04:24:00.000Z	kijutsu		heh
2011-08-14T04:24:00.000Z	kijutsu		what the heck was that? :P
2011-08-14T04:25:00.000Z	kijutsu		"I WANT BUGFREE SOFTWARE>. WHINEWHINEWHINE."  Keeeep dreamin friend. :P
2011-08-14T04:25:00.000Z	kijutsu		moving on indeed
2011-08-14T04:25:00.000Z	kijutsu		Dumb question of the evening:  How do I mount a physical disk under KVM without breaking everything?
2011-08-14T04:26:00.000Z	StevenR	kijutsu	can you be more precise about what you want to do ?
2011-08-14T04:27:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	I'm building a Windows XP virtual machine to create an audio server via shoutcast.  I would like this virtual machine to read the mp3s i have on a physical ext3 drive on the host machine.
2011-08-14T04:28:00.000Z	StevenR	kijutsu	ok, then use samba to share them. Windows XP won't read them on it's own if it's ext3.
2011-08-14T04:28:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	Doh.. I was hoping KVM had a middle-man software to convert to NTFS/Fat32 on the fly.
2011-08-14T04:29:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	guess Samba is the answer -- I just hope the loopback network interface doesn't cause issues for streaming audio.
2011-08-14T04:29:00.000Z	StevenR	kijutsu	nope, samba is your way here... or get an icecast/shoutcast server for ubuntu?
2011-08-14T04:30:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	the shoutcast/icecast servers I found are.. unimpressive.
2011-08-14T04:30:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	Thanks though. guess I'll have to go dig into some samba manuals and figure out how the heck to make that fly right.
2011-08-14T04:33:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	while we're on the subject -- do you have any recommendations to create samba shares with a mimimum of hassle?
2011-08-14T04:33:00.000Z	StevenR	kijutsu	you might look at SAT
2011-08-14T04:33:00.000Z	StevenR		*SWAT
2011-08-14T04:34:00.000Z	kijutsu	StevenR	I did try that under PPC and it damn near took out the system.  Is it stabler under x86/x86_64?
2011-08-14T04:35:00.000Z	StevenR	kijutsu	not sure... I've always just used the manpage and vim to edit samba configs.
