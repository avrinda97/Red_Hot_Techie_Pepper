2006-01-12T13:01:00.000Z	DivGradCurl		So, yeah, where do I go about starting this entire project?  I assume I need to download something, make some changes - I think I understand what I need to change at this point - put it back together, and put it on a disk.
2006-01-12T13:03:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	There are a lot of pre-made boot floppies - have you checked to see if there's one that matches your requirements?
2006-01-12T13:04:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	 Yeah, but I alwas could have missed something.  The challenge here is that I have to create a virtual kernel that loads inself into the RAM, loads some drivers, detects the dang external, and then boots into the kernel on the external.
2006-01-12T13:04:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	woah
2006-01-12T13:05:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	 I've already spent a bunch of time tweaking the grub already installed on the local machine, and it quite simply doesn't realize there is an external there before it tries booting!
2006-01-12T13:06:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	Everything I need to do it is intermediate from the looks of things.  However, I ain't intermediate.
2006-01-12T13:06:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	What are you? ;)
2006-01-12T13:08:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	 Completely new.  I used Norton Partiton to carve out room on my dads comp and then installed Ubuntu for him.  At this point, I know how to install Ubuntu, and how to move around in directories.  He asked me how to install Opera and I had no idea where to start (the forums held the answer)
2006-01-12T13:11:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	tweaking kernels sounds more advanced to me
2006-01-12T13:11:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	It's one of the few things I haven't tackled...
2006-01-12T13:12:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	 Heh, I really have no idea how advanced kernel tweaking is.
2006-01-12T13:12:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	It's infinitely variable, so ^_^
2006-01-12T13:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	Can you login on the Ubuntu box?
2006-01-12T13:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	Have you tried downloading the installer from Opera.com?  They provide an ubuntu-specific version...
2006-01-12T13:20:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	 *lol*  That's cool.
2006-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	Sorry, but out of my league with kernels. :D
2006-01-12T13:35:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	Have you tried in #linux or #kernel? ;)
2006-01-12T13:37:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	PuMpErNiCkLe	 Not a bad idea.  This seemed a good place to start since (a) I'm an aspiring Ubuntu user (b) it MIGHT work with any kernel, not 100% if it must be a copy, and (c) this room is extremely active.
2006-01-12T13:39:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	DivGradCurl	lol
