2011-01-26T23:34:00.000Z	Stereocaulon		Yesterday I've  got an automatic  distupgrade via the normal update notifier. This strikes me as strange since I'm already running 10.10. Does anyone have a clue why this might happen?
2011-01-26T23:34:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	it pushed you to 11.04??
2011-01-26T23:35:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	if OSS is back in 11.04 I won't complain.
2011-01-26T23:36:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	ive heard no news of Linus accepting OSS, so no probably not
2011-01-26T23:37:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	so it was Linus that acknowledged the removal of OSS from the kernel? I thought this was an Ubuntu-only choice.
2011-01-26T23:38:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	abandoning OSS makes my Wine pretty much useless for games
2011-01-26T23:38:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	it was removed upstream for licensing reasons and replaced with ALSA. Additionally, Linus does not permit any floating point arithmetic in the kernel, which OSS does use, so it's unlikely it'll be reaccepted upstream any time soon
2011-01-26T23:39:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	do you know any solid solution for the slew of Windows games that *require* OSS to have any sound whatsoever?
2011-01-26T23:39:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	there is a compatibility layer to let pulseaudio and alsa handle them
2011-01-26T23:39:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	should all be there by default...
2011-01-26T23:40:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	ALSA does not work, nor does Pulse. when selected, Wine crashes those games involved completely
2011-01-26T23:41:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	i suggest talking to wine devs then, if they're handling the api oddly
2011-01-26T23:41:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	the removal of OSS also breaks several video frontends, like MythTV
2011-01-26T23:42:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	im sure that's not true. OSS hasnt been in the kernel for a couple of years now, and i've used MythTV just fine
2011-01-26T23:42:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	I might just do that, talk to the Wine devs...
2011-01-26T23:43:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	I've been using Linux since 1997
2011-01-26T23:44:00.000Z	maco	Stereocaulon	thats fine, but my point is that Myth has worked for me and OSS hasnt been around the whole time ive used linux, so therefore...myth works without oss
2011-01-26T23:45:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	well then I'll just keep my fingers crossed and start the upgrade.
2011-04-07T00:16:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	maco	groundup, if only that "distro" from Redmond would be so transparent about it's updates...;-)
