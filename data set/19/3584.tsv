2009-08-24T18:46:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		what happened to ye olde grey hash screen?
2009-08-24T18:47:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		...
2009-08-24T18:47:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		i could flipping see if the damned thing was working or not.
2009-08-24T18:48:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		no mouse pointer.
2009-08-24T18:48:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		xinit
2009-08-24T18:49:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		same black screen.
2009-08-24T18:49:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		it might be out of range... but i thoguht xorg took care of all of that.
2009-08-24T18:50:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		Halitech,, of course. but i've been completely spoiled by freebsd's sheer ease of use
2009-08-24T18:50:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		and i'm expecting services where they evidently don't exist on ubuntu.
2009-08-24T18:50:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		yeah, i s'pose so.
2009-08-24T18:51:00.000Z	maco	bjorkintosh	id say OS is correct. ubuntu is linux and freebsd is bsd.
2009-08-24T18:51:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	maco	i run debian on this machine, it isn't nearly as much of a PITA...
2009-08-24T18:51:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		and i know ubuntu is based on debian
2009-08-24T18:52:00.000Z	maco	bjorkintosh	ohok
2009-08-24T18:52:00.000Z	maco	bjorkintosh	maybe if you install xdm?
2009-08-24T18:52:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		see, i don't need XDM but if i must, i shall.
2009-08-24T18:52:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		i have.
2009-08-24T18:52:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		my machine keeps crashing.
2009-08-24T18:53:00.000Z	maco	bjorkintosh	though i guess if startx is failing.. :-/ maybe you need to actually do things to xorg.conf for your hardware?
