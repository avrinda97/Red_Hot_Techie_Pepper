2007-04-01T12:35:00.000Z	cables		What does a dist-upgrade do that just upgrading packages doesn't?
2007-04-01T12:35:00.000Z	cables		I got a prompt to do a dist-upgrade today in Feisty beta.
2007-04-01T12:37:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	cables	no, ubuntu uses ubuntu-desktop metapackage for that
2007-04-01T12:37:00.000Z	[WaZ] 		(installing new packages/software)
2007-04-01T12:37:00.000Z	cables		[WaZ] , ok, so what does upgrading do?
2007-04-01T12:38:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	cables	i think dist-upgrade also upgrades system files
2007-04-01T12:38:00.000Z	cables		[WaZ] , is that for modifying things that aren't in the metapackage?
2007-04-01T12:38:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	cables	not sure tho, i guess if dist-upgrade: reboot needed
2007-04-01T12:39:00.000Z	cables		ok...
2007-04-01T12:39:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	cables	well if dist-upgrade: reboot possibly needed
2007-04-01T12:39:00.000Z	cables		ok
2007-04-01T12:39:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	cables	makes sense for servers at least, to make the difference
2007-04-01T12:39:00.000Z	cables		ok

2007-04-01T12:41:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	cables	I was wrong: http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Upgrade_vs._dist-upgrade
2007-04-01T12:41:00.000Z	cables	SlimeyPete	I think WOW works in wine
2007-04-01T12:41:00.000Z	cables		[WaZ] , thanks
