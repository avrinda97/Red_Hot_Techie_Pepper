2005-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	bjron		having a problem w/ upgrading to hoary:  seems xorg-driver-synaptics tries to overwrite /usr/bin/synclient, which is also in package xfree86-drive-synaptics.
2005-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	bjron		so it stops
2005-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	bjron		and I can't get past that
2005-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	farruinn	bjron	remove xfree86 stuff
2005-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	bjron	farruinn	yes, but it won't let me remove xfree86-driver-synaptics because of unmet dependancies, wants me to run apt-get -f install first
2005-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	bjron		which tries to install xorg-driver-synaptics
2005-03-14T07:49:00.000Z	farruinn	bjron	can you try using apt-get -f remove xfree86-driver-synaptics?
2005-03-14T07:49:00.000Z	bjron	farruinn	yea, one sec . .
2005-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	bjron	farruinn	nm, removed ubuntu-desktop which was the one w/ the dependancy, and onward it goes
2005-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	bjron		thanks tho
2005-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	farruinn	bjron	are you doing a dist-upgrade?
2005-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	bjron		yes
2005-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	bjron		will have to put back those packages again tho
2005-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	bjron		after it's done
2005-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	farruinn	bjron	odd, I would have expected dist-upgrade to take care of that
2005-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	bjron	farruinn	yea, so would I
2005-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	farruinn	bjron	yeah, ubuntu-desktop would be good to install
2005-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	bjron		I was vorried it would take  a bunch of other stuff out when I removed it, but it didn't so it was ok :P
2005-03-14T07:52:00.000Z	farruinn	bjron	ubuntu-desktop is a "meta package" - it doesn't actually install anything itself, it just depends on a ton of other packages so they're installed
