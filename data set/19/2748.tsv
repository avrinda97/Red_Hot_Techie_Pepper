2010-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	psyphercode		hi all, i have been annoyed with a problem in ubuntu since almost fore ever., it happens on every install of ubuntu of various different hardware. recently i was told that it's the sata drivers and i must upgrade to karmic, well i have upgraded to karmic and the problem is still there.
2010-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	psyphercode		problem is that as soon as there is ANY kind of high disk activity, and not even THAT much, just having 2 copying threads will do it, and the entire pc comes to a grinding halt, firefox greys out and locks up ALL the time and i can barely do anything. since i am constantly doing large file copies, using vmware, encoding videos, unraring files I have to constatnly sit and wait for my pc to become responsive.
2010-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	psyphercode		why am i told I am the only person who has this issue, I don't believe that for a second. i would really like to squash this bug one and for all, it's driving me nuts, and as one for the biggest linux/ubuntu fanboys it's actually driving me back to winblows!!!! PLEASE help
2010-01-14T01:23:00.000Z	psyphercode		why does my entire pc friezze when there is any kind of dicsk acticvity
2010-01-14T01:24:00.000Z	psyphercode		every pc i have every installed with ubuntu, no matrter the verison no matter to hardware
2010-01-14T01:25:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	that sounds highly unlikely
2010-01-14T01:25:00.000Z	psyphercode	protojay	well i have been using ubuntu since breezy and this issue has been VERY prevelant since feisty
2010-01-14T01:26:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	why dont i have that issue? im using 9.10 on a relatively modest laptop
2010-01-14T01:27:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	if it happened on only one or two different pieces of hardware, maybe.... but that certainly isnt prevalent with other people
2010-01-14T01:28:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	it does indeed sound like a hardware issue... maybe a mainboard or cpu problem... or your harddisk is messed up
2010-01-14T01:30:00.000Z	psyphercode	protojay	my hardware is fine, happens on all my pc's
2010-01-14T01:30:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	how many pcs have you tried it on?
2010-01-14T01:34:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	i meant how many pcs have you had this problem on? asin a number...
2010-01-14T01:35:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	your consider us to think its likely that 4-6 computers with fresh installations of ubuntu have the exact same problem?
2010-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	psyphercode	protojay	as far as i am concrned from my extensive experience this is general ubuntu issue
2010-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	try googling the problem... "ubuntu slow hard disk activity"
2010-01-14T01:37:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	i may not have your extensive expeirence, but i have first hand experience that your problem should not be a prevalent as you infer it to be
2010-01-14T03:53:00.000Z	protojay	psyphercode	ah your back, what have you messed up this time?
2010-01-14T03:58:00.000Z	psyphercode	protojay	he installed the latest kernel and his pc is completely hosed
