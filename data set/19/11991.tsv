2005-10-25T09:04:00.000Z	ja76		Please, anyone? Need help with a usb mouse problem.
2005-10-25T09:06:00.000Z	brenner	ja76	probably can't help, but what's the prob?
2005-10-25T09:07:00.000Z	ja76	brenner	At some point in time it stopped working. It works fine on other puters though, and I have a usb key which works in my puter.
2005-10-25T09:08:00.000Z	brenner	ja76	maybe plug it in, then dmesg | tail
2005-10-25T09:10:00.000Z	ja76	brenner	It says: "Cannot enable port 3. Maybe the USB cable is bad?".
2005-10-25T09:11:00.000Z	ja76	brenner	But it is not - the mouse works on other puters.
2005-10-25T09:11:00.000Z	brenner	ja76	dunno..if you say it works on other computers...

2005-10-25T09:13:00.000Z	ja76	brenner	Yes, get the same message.
2005-10-25T09:14:00.000Z	brenner	ja76	weird dunno, sorry....have you tried another usb mouse?
2005-10-25T09:14:00.000Z	ja76	brenner	Yes, I tried another. Same problem.
