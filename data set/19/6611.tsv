2008-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	rikkimaru		Does windows have to be installed on the 1st primary partition?
2008-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	rikkimaru	no.  It just has to think it is.
2008-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	rikkimaru	(you can fool it with GRUB)
2008-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	is there a way to do that?
2008-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	rikkimaru	GRUB's map
2008-02-28T09:15:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	the problem I'm having is installing windows.  When i run the install CD, it claims there is no space avaliable
2008-02-28T09:15:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	GRUB doesn't even run when the CD boots, right?
2008-02-28T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	rikkimaru	oh, thats different.  Do you have any space available?
2008-02-28T09:16:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	yes, and it's at the front of the disk
2008-02-28T09:16:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	but my current ubuntu install is /dev/sda1
2008-02-28T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	rikkimaru	once you create a new partition infront of sda1, it'll become sda2.
2008-02-28T09:17:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	how can I do that?
2008-02-28T09:17:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	if i try with fdisk it claims its already taken
2008-02-28T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	rikkimaru	In the windows installer, you'll be able to create a partition.
2008-02-28T09:17:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	hmm... I'll try, but I don't think it let me
2008-02-28T09:17:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	brb
2008-02-28T09:22:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	It doesn't let me get to the partitioning system
2008-02-28T09:22:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	is there a way I can change my ubuntu install from /dev/sda1 to something else?
2008-02-28T09:22:00.000Z	rikkimaru	Flannel	or at least whichi primary partition it is
