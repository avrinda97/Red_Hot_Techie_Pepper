2005-10-15T12:33:00.000Z	mirak		if the bootloader manage to load the kernel he should be able to load the initrd as well ?
2005-10-15T12:35:00.000Z	mirak		how to get the exact sources of a kernel image, with ubuntu patches and such ?
2005-10-15T12:37:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	no
2005-10-15T12:37:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	gui is bettwer
2005-10-15T12:37:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	if the resolutions aren't listed in the gui there is no way he will get them
2005-10-15T13:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	ask
2005-10-15T13:01:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	the module for the cmd64x module is in the initrd and in the config file of the kernel, however at boot it fails to load it
2005-10-15T13:02:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	the G3 blue and white have two ide controlers, and the one for the cdrom loads fine, but the one for hard drive doesn't load
2005-10-15T13:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	not me, sorry
2006-05-22T14:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	single, not -single
2006-05-22T14:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	the appfolders way is flawed
2006-05-22T14:36:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	yes, but the wheel group thing is not that bad
2006-05-22T14:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	(by design and by implementation)
2006-05-22T14:37:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	with OS X when you install an app there is rarely dependencies. I mean, when you install an audio player there is not mysql that want to installs itself, so that's doable
2006-05-22T14:37:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	what is bad in your opinion ?
2006-05-22T14:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	mirak	he is a complete newbie to linux
2006-05-22T14:59:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	lol, I give him the root acces and it doesn't even know how to do it
2006-05-22T14:59:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	there is not that much risk in fact
2006-05-22T14:59:00.000Z	mirak	kbrooks	what's problem with OS X app folder ?
