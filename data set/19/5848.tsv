2009-05-17T19:31:00.000Z	clearscreen		Firestarter requires enabled eth0 device, enabled eth0 device drops my internet from wlan0
2009-05-17T19:32:00.000Z	clearscreen		I can share the connection easily through firestarter, but it requires eth0 to be up
2009-05-17T19:32:00.000Z	clearscreen		but eth0 = up means ubuntu prefer that adapter over wlan0 to get internet
2009-05-17T19:32:00.000Z	clearscreen		which is what I dont want
2009-05-17T19:32:00.000Z	clearscreen		wlan0 should ALWAYS be the device to get internet from
2009-05-17T19:34:00.000Z	clearscreen		basically I just want wlan0 to be considered the default device for internet connections, that's all.. so I can enable eth0 without worrying about internet being dropped

2009-05-17T19:35:00.000Z	clearscreen	PhotoJim	I dont want to use the wired one preferentially :P
2009-05-17T19:35:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	why wouldn't you?  faster, lower latency.
2009-05-17T19:35:00.000Z	clearscreen	PhotoJim	because it isnt connected to the internet :)
2009-05-17T19:36:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	why do you have wire connected then?  pirated wifi?
2009-05-17T19:36:00.000Z	clearscreen	PhotoJim	Not pirated, we have two floors here
2009-05-17T19:42:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	you need a router that can handle being a WiFi client.  or you need to run wire from the access point downstairs.  anything else is going to be a kludge.  you could set up a modest old Linux box (even a Pentium 1) to be your router, and make things work a lot more elegantly.
2009-05-17T19:42:00.000Z	clearscreen	PhotoJim	I just need ubuntu to route my internet traffic over the wlan0 adapter instead of preferentially pick the eth0 adapter even though it doesnt even have a WAN connection
2009-05-17T19:43:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	I don't know how to do that with Network Manager.  but if you configure your network manually you could maket he default route be via the WLAN gateway.
2009-05-17T19:44:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	like I said, making it so that you could access the gateway via wire would b ea lot less kludgy.
2009-05-17T19:44:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	essentially if you want to do what you want, you need to make your client machine act as a router for itself, which is an advanced configuration.
2009-05-17T19:45:00.000Z	clearscreen	PhotoJim	firestarter can easily do it, and I have some experience with iptables, that really isn't the issue.. I just want it to stop picking my default gateway for me
2009-05-17T19:45:00.000Z	PhotoJim	clearscreen	network manager is your issue, no doubt, then.
