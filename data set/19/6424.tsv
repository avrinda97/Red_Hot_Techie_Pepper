2008-06-21T22:52:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	it's also wrong
2008-06-21T22:52:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	what?
2008-06-21T22:53:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	running apps nilly willy with root priviledges
2008-06-21T22:53:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	they asked how to run something without a console as sudo, I told them how, it's not up to me, or you, what they choose to run
2008-06-21T22:54:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	just like you don't help them to re enable root accounts you don't help them to run normal apps suid root. for the same reason
2008-06-21T22:55:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	unless you want to help him forever when (not if) this causes problems
2008-06-21T22:56:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	I personally want help, he asked a question that he wanted to know the answer to, I always enable root, I don't think it's my issue what he does with it, that's his choice, not ours, although I guess I should have warned him, but then, he used sudo, it's the same
2008-06-21T22:56:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	it'S channel policy not to do it.
2008-06-21T22:56:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	not to tell someone about gksu? do you think it's a secret ?
2008-06-21T22:56:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	what you do in your private home with root and such is nobody's business. what you tell others new here is not
2008-06-21T22:57:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	no it's not
2008-06-21T22:57:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	then why is a problem for me to tell him about gksu?
2008-06-21T22:57:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	but we're getting OT
2008-06-21T22:58:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	please don't do that, I never suggested root
2008-06-21T22:58:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	you make him run it with root priviledges which is what I said
2008-06-21T22:59:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	I didn't make him do anything, the first message of his I saw was him asking how to make a message box come up to run something as root, some things need it, gparted for example
2008-06-21T23:00:00.000Z	wols_	azexian	sorry
2008-06-21T23:01:00.000Z	azexian	wols_	you're forgiven =)
