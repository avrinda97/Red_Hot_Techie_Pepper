2012-10-18T07:34:00.000Z	tedski	Mcl0vin	login as guest and do ls -ld /home
2012-10-18T07:34:00.000Z	tedski	Mcl0vin	see if /home/userid is owned by userid
2012-10-18T07:34:00.000Z	tedski		and yeah, as bfortified noted... it won't hurt one bit to chown it anyway
2012-10-18T07:35:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tedski	drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep  1 11:09 /home

2012-10-18T07:39:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tedski	any suggestion on how to fix it
2012-10-18T07:41:00.000Z	tedski	Mcl0vin	humor us and do: chown -R yourusername:yourusername /home/yourusername
2012-10-18T07:41:00.000Z	tedski	Mcl0vin	just to make sure that's not the issue

2012-10-18T07:46:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tedski	i will have to reboot
2012-10-18T07:46:00.000Z	tedski	Mcl0vin	you shouldn't have to... you should be able to just log out and log back in
