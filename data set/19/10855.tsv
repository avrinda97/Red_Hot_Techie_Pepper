2006-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	tristanbob		in the cups web-interface - what credentials is it looking for? (Ubuntu 6.06)  I am trying to add a printer.
2006-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	tristanbob		and I get a Username/Password prompt
2006-07-09T07:41:00.000Z	tristanbob		so any ideas what credentials I need to use in the cups web interface?  I tried "root" and the sudo password
2006-07-09T07:43:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	your password is the sudo password
2006-07-09T07:44:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	check the paper size from the program you print from
2006-07-09T07:44:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	also turn the printer off and back on
2006-07-09T07:44:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	I will try that
2006-07-09T07:44:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	I filed a huge bug report on it, but for some reason it worked after I turned it off and back on.  Made no sense.
2006-07-09T07:45:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	is this required every time?  or once per reboot?
2006-07-09T07:45:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	I haven't had to do it since, but who knows.  I generally leave my printer on 24/7 so I hope not
2006-07-09T07:45:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	I am just trying to get the test page to work
2006-07-09T07:45:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	it is an HP PSC 2110
2006-07-09T07:46:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	mine was also an HP
2006-07-09T07:46:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	also did you update to the newest cups packages?  There was an update either today or yesterday
2006-07-09T07:47:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	yes, I saw those - and yes I updated
2006-07-09T07:51:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	any luck?
2006-07-09T07:51:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	no - the test page job is just sitting there - not printing
2006-07-09T07:52:00.000Z	sharms	tristanbob	do you know how to file a bug report?
2006-07-09T07:52:00.000Z	tristanbob	sharms	yes - but you would think basic printing should be working - perhaps I am doing something wrong
