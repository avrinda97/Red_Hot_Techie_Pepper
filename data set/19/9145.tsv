2007-06-19T08:49:00.000Z	logomancer		Can someone help me out when a wireless problem when they're free?
2007-06-19T08:50:00.000Z	logomancer		Alright then.
2007-06-19T08:50:00.000Z	logomancer		(sorry, I've not been here in a while)
2007-06-19T08:51:00.000Z	logomancer		So. I can't access my home network over wireless. It looks like the card associating with the AP, but I'm not getting an IP address.
2007-06-19T08:52:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	logomancer	so is the ESSID unique?
2007-06-19T08:52:00.000Z	logomancer	nomasteryoda	it is.
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	logomancer	and using ubuntu vs kubuntu?
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	logomancer		nomasteryoda,
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	logomancer	nomasteryoda	ubuntu
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda		ok, did you try to manually set the network stuff or use the network-manager?
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	logomancer		network-manager keeps asking me over and over again for a WEP key -- which I provide -- it looks like it associates -- and then it asks me again after about one minute
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda		ah
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	logomancer	nomasteryoda	network-manager
2007-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	logomancer	what card?
2007-06-19T08:54:00.000Z	logomancer		Intel 3945.
2007-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	nomasteryoda		ok
2007-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	logomancer		It might be an issue with dhcdbd, because I find: "dhcdbd: Unrequested down ?:3" in .var.log/messages
2007-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	logomancer		/var/log/messages, that is...
2007-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	logomancer	might try the driver from here?? http://intellinuxwireless.org/
