2007-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	niuq		S0mel: isnt dangerous to play with ntfs partitions?
2007-06-15T10:07:00.000Z	lo4fer	niuq	as root, i would think so.
2007-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	why as a root?
2007-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	lo4fer	niuq	are you talking about during ubuntu installation
2007-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	no i am not
2007-06-15T10:09:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	so what it does?
2007-06-15T10:09:00.000Z	lo4fer	niuq	do you not have access to windows?
2007-06-15T10:10:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	i do have access, why?
2007-06-15T10:10:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	i had some troubles with partition magic using windows
2007-06-15T10:12:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	so i thought i could do it with ubuntu...
2007-06-15T10:12:00.000Z	lo4fer	niuq	presumably you are shrinking the partition? extending is a fairly simple matter if i'm not mistaken. you can do that in windows disk management right?
2007-06-15T10:13:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	what do you mean with extending?
2007-06-15T10:13:00.000Z	lo4fer	niuq	when you resize a partition, you either make it bigger or smaller. when making it bigger, you "extend" it into unpartitioned space on the drive. or something.
2007-06-15T10:15:00.000Z	niuq	lo4fer	and you can give a specific format with that, to the unallocated space
