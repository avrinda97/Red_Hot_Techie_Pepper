2005-07-27T05:43:00.000Z	coolkev		ubuntu keeps accessing my harddisk for no reason... like i tested it.. after my computer loaded i left it idle and i keep hearing every 5-10 seconds ubuntu access my hard drisk
2005-07-27T05:43:00.000Z	coolkev		this is the reason why my hard drisk get so hot for no reason..
2005-07-27T05:44:00.000Z	coolkev		evey right now
2005-07-27T05:44:00.000Z	coolkev		even*
2005-07-27T05:44:00.000Z	coolkev		all i'm doing is being on x-chat and i hear linux accessing hd
2005-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	coolkev		and one of them is not even mounted and it's still getting hot
2005-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	many modern hd's get hot
2005-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	it's just the way it is
2005-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	yes, the spindle motor is what gets hot
2005-07-27T05:47:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	when the hd is accessed, look for what starts using CPU
2005-07-27T05:48:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	might also run "lsof" while the hd light is on and run it again when it stops and see whats different
2005-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	the heat isn't likely to hurt the hd
2005-07-27T06:52:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	is it an lcd?
2005-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	coolkev	cw2	Do you a solution to that problem i had, witht eh fuzzy screne
2005-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	maybe a low refresh rate?
2005-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	cw2	coolkev	or too hihj of one
2005-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	coolkev	cw2	it happens only when ubuntu first boot right after GRUb where the kernal loads
2005-07-27T06:58:00.000Z	coolkev	cw2	it's like dos so I don't know how there is a resolution problem
2005-07-27T06:58:00.000Z	coolkev	cw2	it runs perfect after like now
