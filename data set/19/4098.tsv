2009-03-26T22:58:00.000Z	PaperTiger		Quick question, if I restart during the format part of the install process, does that ruin the hard drive
2009-03-26T22:59:00.000Z	Jason_CO	PaperTiger	it cant be good - -but i doubt it would ruin it
2009-03-26T22:59:00.000Z	PaperTiger	Jason_CO	Didn't think it would be good, but I realised I had to remove the RAID settings...
2009-03-26T22:59:00.000Z	PaperTiger		So I had to quit it...
2009-03-26T22:59:00.000Z	Jason_CO		if i were you -- i would go back, erase all your partitions and start over
2009-03-26T23:00:00.000Z	PaperTiger	Jason_CO	I tried to install Ubuntu after that, but the format process bar started where it left off, but didn't move. What you think?
2009-03-26T23:00:00.000Z	Jason_CO		did you remove all the partitions?
2009-03-26T23:01:00.000Z	PaperTiger	Jason_CO	I'm going guided, use whole disk
2009-03-26T23:01:00.000Z	Jason_CO		ok - go manual
2009-03-26T23:01:00.000Z	Jason_CO		delete all the partitions

2009-03-26T23:01:00.000Z	PaperTiger		Fair enough...
2009-03-26T23:02:00.000Z	Jason_CO		i could do it on my own on my system -- but to try to walk you through it
2009-03-26T23:02:00.000Z	Jason_CO		im not sure i can help
2009-03-26T23:02:00.000Z	PaperTiger		Well, it won't hurt to try it using manual, will it? I have nothing to lose :)
