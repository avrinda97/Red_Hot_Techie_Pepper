2005-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	froust		I want to set up a secure (no username/password in clear text) ftp server at home - can anyone point me to a howto?
2005-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	why not use ssh? you can use scp and sftp with it for security
2005-02-27T13:25:00.000Z	froust	thoreauputic	i don't know how to set that up... i'm connecting from a windows box
2005-02-27T13:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	ssh is installed by default
2005-02-27T13:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	use putty on windows
2005-02-27T13:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	starting point -> http://www.google.com.au/search?q=sftp+howto&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
2005-02-27T13:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	or  http://pigtail.net/LRP/printsrv/cygwin-sshd.html
2005-02-27T13:28:00.000Z	froust	thoreauputic	if i had had any luck with google, i wouldn't be asking
2005-02-27T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	not to be rude, but there is a huge number of googlable howtos on this subject
2005-02-27T13:30:00.000Z	froust	thoreauputic	i know that. i've been using linux for a month, and i don't quite understand what it's saying.
2005-02-27T13:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	 http://www.openssh.com/windows.html
2005-02-27T13:31:00.000Z	froust	thoreauputic	i can get the client side working fine
2005-02-27T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	the server is linux, right?
2005-02-27T13:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	once you ahve ssh running on the linux box (which it does by default I believe), you just need to open port 22 and login, as far as I know, using the instructions for putty.
2005-02-27T13:40:00.000Z	froust	thoreauputic	thanks for the help
2005-03-08T10:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	use visudo
2005-03-08T10:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	it checks for errors
2005-03-08T10:06:00.000Z	froust	thoreauputic	thanks
2005-03-08T10:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	froust	you're welcome :)
