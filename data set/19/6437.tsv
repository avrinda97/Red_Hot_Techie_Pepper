2008-01-30T08:20:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector		I'm getting a blank desktop after logging into gnome... signing out and trying to log in again.  I created a separate user, and everything works fine.  Any ideas where to look to troubleshoot?
2008-01-30T08:22:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector		mkquist... it works find for my new user... just when I try re-logging in with the old user
2008-01-30T08:22:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	First off, you will probably want to afford the new user some more priviledges.  Edit /etc/group  (to give new user rights to more devices / services).
2008-01-30T08:23:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	is there a quick command to assign my new user the same groups as my existing user?
2008-01-30T08:24:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	Edit /etc/group and add the new user name to the end of each line that has old user name, (preceeded by ,  and no spaces).
2008-01-30T08:24:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	thanks
2008-01-30T08:26:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	e.g.  cupsys,user1,user2
2008-01-30T08:28:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	k, I've added my new user to the same groups as my old user... still can log in/out and in again just fine...
2008-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	Log out and back in again in order for the new user to realize new priviledges.
2008-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	done... logged in and out twice
2008-01-30T08:35:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	any other ideas for troublshooting this gnome login issue?
2008-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	There are only 2 issues, username and password.  You are typing one of them in wrong.
2008-01-30T08:38:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	un/pw isn't the issue, it works fine after reboot... but after logging out and back in is when it stops working
2008-01-30T08:39:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	I'll see what I can figure out.  Thanks for the help
2008-01-30T08:40:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	I'm sorry.  What stops working?
2008-01-30T08:40:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	the desktop doesn't show up.  the panels, the icons, nothing
2008-01-30T08:41:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	just a brown screen with a working mouse
2008-01-30T08:41:00.000Z	pure`eigenVector	usr13_	is there any particular logs I should be looking for errors in?
2008-01-30T08:43:00.000Z	usr13_	pure`eigenVector	You might try Alt-F2  and run  gnome-panel
