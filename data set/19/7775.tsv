2007-06-25T13:26:00.000Z	mcmx_		Hi i have a problem, when using home directories on an nfs4 share i get a problem when a new user logs on pam_mkhomedir creates the home directory with user nobody then the logging on user has no permissions, any help would be great, cheers
2007-06-25T13:28:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	why not give user nobody permissions?
2007-06-25T13:28:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	also, you can specify which user samba uses in the /etc/samba/****.conf file
2007-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	can you explain your setup for me?
2007-06-25T13:33:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	any better?
2007-06-25T13:34:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	yeah, lemme find an answer for you
2007-06-25T13:36:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	it seems to me that unless pam_mkhomedir is failing horribly, all your users are being bounced back as the default login
2007-06-25T13:36:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	any suggestions?
2007-06-25T13:39:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	check the config on the ldap server, and make sure its logging into the nfs with the users instead of nobody
2007-06-25T13:40:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	Logging into the nfs?
2007-06-25T13:41:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	sounds like you have one server with LDAP, another with your filesystems and directories, and the third being the user
2007-06-25T13:43:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	yeah, well thats the plan
2007-06-25T13:44:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	so either the LDAP server is seeing nobody and assigning everyone a default account, or samba is just failing to use the LDAP server and using the default account
2007-06-25T13:48:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	I dunno man, turn off the default account, and see if the LDAP logs show anyone even logging in
2007-06-25T14:12:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	It appears i cannot change ownership of a file on any nfsv4 share even if the permissions permit this, it works fine on the local file system, any ideas on that?
2007-06-25T14:13:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	that is interesting, can you login as root and try?
2007-06-25T14:14:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	i am trying to change permissions as root no avail. its nfsv3 sorry
2007-06-25T14:15:00.000Z	LeoDioxide	mcmx_	are the filesystems mounted read-only?  I know that over a network sometimes you won't get errors
2007-06-25T14:18:00.000Z	mcmx_	LeoDioxide	i know i cant get my head round it lol
