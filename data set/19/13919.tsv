2004-12-14T17:28:00.000Z	zooko		oh wait
2004-12-14T17:29:00.000Z	zooko		What's the difference between uni and multi verse?
2004-12-14T17:29:00.000Z	zooko		Now I've tried both, to no avail.
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		Okay, I also tried adding the apt-source maintained by the darcs people.  The line they suggest is:
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		deb http://abridgegame.org/debian/ woody/
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		as written here:
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		http://www.scannedinavian.org/DarcsWiki/CategoryBinaries#head-4e7d1aacd7618015f43023071a3cecd3724cfad0
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		But then it says "Hit" and then "Ign" on that line when I run apt-get update.
2004-12-14T17:31:00.000Z	zooko		I guess it is "Ign"oring it because it is from a release named "woody" ?
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	zooko		okay, now I'll dl the .deb file from the darcs devels and try dpkg -i on it.  :-)
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	nevyn	zooko	it's in debian..then it's in universe.
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	zooko	nevyn	then something is wrong!  darcs is definitely in debian.
2004-12-14T17:33:00.000Z	zooko	nevyn	darcs is sweet and simple to use, and has some unique flexbility over arch.
2004-12-14T17:33:00.000Z	nevyn	zooko	it's different certainly
2004-12-14T17:39:00.000Z	nevyn	zooko	star merge merges a remote development tree into the local tree.
2004-12-14T17:39:00.000Z	zooko	nevyn	very interesting!
2004-12-14T17:40:00.000Z	nevyn	zooko	if someone's got physical access you're screwed already.. so taping them to the monitor isn't that bad.
2004-12-14T17:41:00.000Z	nevyn	zooko	I've done that to a gpg key
2004-12-14T17:43:00.000Z	nevyn	zooko	I did it about then
