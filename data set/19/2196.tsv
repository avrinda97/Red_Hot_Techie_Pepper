2010-06-01T03:01:00.000Z	EmilySC		I just installed Lucid on a Asus G72GX laptop and I want to use my speakers with it.  They work, however the internal speaker still is on.  How do I turn it off?
2010-06-01T03:02:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	try alsamixer
2010-06-01T03:03:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	okie, I'll look for it now :)
2010-06-01T03:09:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	alsamixer didn't help any :(
2010-06-01T03:09:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	you don't see the speaker in alsamixer?
2010-06-01T03:12:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	I see master (which did what its supposed to do), headphone which don't effect either speakers, speaker which has no bar and stays at 00, PCM, Front, Surround all do nothing
2010-06-01T03:13:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	that seems correct- have you tried looking at the sound preferences on the speaker icon in the panel?
2010-06-01T03:14:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	yep, I don't see any way to change which speakers do what.
2010-06-01T03:14:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	check the Output panel and verify that the Connector is what you want it to be
2010-06-01T03:15:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	Says Internal Audio Analog Stereo.  Shouldn't it be something external?
2010-06-01T03:15:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	Thats the only option btw
2010-06-01T03:15:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	probably- try some of the other ones and see if that fixes it
2010-06-01T03:15:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	oh... well then. Sorry dont know the solution
2010-06-01T03:16:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	one other thing to try is see if lsmod has pcspkr in it
2010-06-01T03:16:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	Thanks for your efforts anyway :)  I'm going to keep at it
2010-06-01T03:16:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	if it does- remove it and see if that addresses your problem
2010-06-01T03:16:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	Okie.  What is LSmod?
2010-06-01T03:17:00.000Z	gagzilla	EmilySC	lsmod = list modules
2010-06-01T03:18:00.000Z	EmilySC	gagzilla	nope :(
