2006-01-21T09:29:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	802.11b will work though?
2006-01-21T09:29:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	Not with that hardware
2006-01-21T09:29:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	do you know if it can be emulated with the normal drivers and he can be stuck using 802.11b?
2006-01-21T09:30:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	so he needs to get cvs version of dapper to get it running?
2006-01-21T09:57:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	Install a different theme, ot make one.
2006-01-21T09:57:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	i'd like dashboards and embedded objects and shadows and invisible effects.
2006-01-21T09:58:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	Oh, crashy features...
2006-01-21T09:58:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	in gdm? Why?
2006-01-21T09:58:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	precisely!  i want the linux equivalent to vista.   yes yes i know, fluff and obnoxiousness.  but it's what i personally want.
2006-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	what do you recommend?   i use gdm because it's what ubuntu came with, i feel it works fine.  it uses my volume wheel on the keyboard and my ATi remote works.
2006-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	I think you mean 'Gnome' when you say 'gdm'.
2006-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	gnome desktop manager.
2006-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	gdm is the login screen.
2006-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	There's not much point in candying up the login window, as you don't generally stare at it for hours.
2006-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	i stare at login for days . . .     ok well sorry for getting the names mixed up.  i want eye candy through the desktop.
2006-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	I'd avoid drop shadows and transparency, they cause memory leaks & crashing. Apart from that, run whatever you like, use whatever theme you like. Check out gdesklets and art.gnome.org
2006-01-21T10:04:00.000Z	lysis	cafuego	what if i would like to at least try out drop shadows and transparency?  where do i go to try it for gnome?
2006-01-21T10:04:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	You need to enable that in xorg, not Gnome.
2006-01-21T10:04:00.000Z	cafuego	lysis	Check the docs for xcompmgr, I think.
