2007-12-19T14:28:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	you thing someone is flooding? doesn't seem so
2007-12-19T14:29:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	i thought maybe it was a DCC attack.  i remember over the summer one day i was told to change my connection port because i had a DCC exploit available through my router and that they knew because i was one of the people who disconnected when someone did a DCC attack on the whole channel
2007-12-19T14:30:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	hmm... saved by firewall... interesting, anyone care to setup some kind of honeypot to verify that?
2007-12-19T14:32:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	i connect to freenode on port 8001 because its non-standard but still supported by freenode, so attacks on that port are less likely
2007-12-19T14:34:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	if its a DCC attack it doesn't matter on which port _you_ connect, it matters if your own DCC port is open
2007-12-19T14:38:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	PriceChild said to connect on port 8001 and then it wouldn't work if someone does that then go to #ubuntu-ops to test it.  after connecting on that port, it passed
2007-12-19T14:39:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	funny, they may be exploiting some netfilter bug in routers, though using that port may mean DCC won't work for you
2007-12-19T14:40:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	so?  dcc never worked for me before anyway.  at least, any time i tried to send a file to a friend over irc, they never got any notification to accept it
2007-12-19T14:45:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	they used to use linux.  they dont anymore, and they made the roms smaller since they got smaller non-linux firmware so you cant fit dd-wrt and openwrt on anymore either
2007-12-19T14:46:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	ok i think stdin is right that they do have 1 model that's specifically open source
2007-12-19T14:47:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	stdin : that is, considering that I did go into the trouble of making ip_conntrack_irc work...
2007-12-19T14:52:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	you'd wish intel tech was that clean and simple...
2007-12-19T14:53:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	i said theoretically.  there's probably some optimizations in there to make 64bit not waste so much memory on small operations
2007-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	also a bunch of ugly hacks to make it backward compatible with 32bit...
2007-12-19T14:55:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	& evanr: havent gotten to computer architectures 2 yet :)  until i realized today that i have a B, not a C, in comp archs 1, i was thinking i wouldnt take it at all
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	notice the "md0"
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	i dont know what that means
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	macogw	ifireball	ive never seen it before
2007-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	ifireball	macogw	MD is the Linux software raid, it came before LVM
