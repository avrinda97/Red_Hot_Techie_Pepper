2011-10-03T21:02:00.000Z	BarkingFish	gigenieks	you gave the wrong command.
2011-10-03T21:06:00.000Z	BarkingFish	gigenieks	i don't know if this works in ubuntu, I know it does in kubuntu... Try Ctrl, Alt, Escape - usually that activates a kill window thing for your mouse
2011-10-03T21:09:00.000Z	BarkingFish	gigenieks	try what theadmin just posted

2011-10-03T21:14:00.000Z	BarkingFish	gigenieks	it's not possible to help you when you're not here, since we'd need to get you to try stuff out as it's done
2011-10-03T21:14:00.000Z	BarkingFish	gigenieks	before you go, can you just try what fritsch suggested please?
2011-10-03T21:21:00.000Z	BarkingFish	gigenieks	we will speak again later, I have to leave also for a while.  I will come back in about 1.5 - 2.0 hours
