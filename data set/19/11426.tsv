2006-01-23T09:12:00.000Z	BoldStrike		how do you log into ubuntu live as root?
2006-01-23T09:12:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	I don't think you can, you have sudo access on the livecd
2006-01-23T09:13:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	what if i want to use Nautilus to view a HD that is available to root only?
2006-01-23T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	did you mount this cd yourself?
2006-01-23T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	I mean hd
2006-01-23T09:14:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	yeh
2006-01-23T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	is it ntfs or fat32?
2006-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	certain directories are locked
2006-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	neither... it's reiser
2006-01-23T09:16:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	use a umask, or fmask/dmask combo when you mount it.  OR, if you really want a root privileged nautilus, 'gksudo nautilus'
2006-01-23T09:17:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	that link will give you the info you need, read the 'manual part'
2006-01-23T09:18:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	i'm mounting an image file though, using loop.. and it's a reiser fs
2006-01-23T09:19:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	I believe the mask options would still work, ignore the fact the link says windows.  It has info their that you can use.  If it's too much trouble, just do 'gksudo nautilus' in a terminal.  Doesn't really matter since you are on a livecd
2006-01-23T09:19:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	ok. thanks
2006-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	that seems to have worked. thnx again
2006-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	np
2006-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	one other question, if i wanted to say dump the entire .img file to create an actual directory tree on a disk partition, how would i do that?
2006-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	_jason	BoldStrike	not sure about that
2006-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	BoldStrike	_jason	i'm sure i use dd, just not sure how
