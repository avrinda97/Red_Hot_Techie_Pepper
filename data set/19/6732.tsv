2007-12-18T06:08:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	try asking a question. and not "what does the terminal DO?!"
2007-12-18T07:38:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	NAT
2007-12-18T07:39:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	mneptok	NAT? whats that?
2007-12-18T07:39:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	network address translation. you need ports forwarded.
2007-12-18T07:39:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	mneptok	ok, and how do i do that?
2007-12-18T07:40:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	i don't know. what kind of router? do you have admin access? what firmware revision?
2007-12-18T07:40:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	now is the time to go to Google and ask about NAT, port forwarding, and your router. ;)
2007-12-18T07:40:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	mneptok	im stealing my internet from a router
2007-12-18T07:41:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	then you have no options.
2007-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	stop stealing. then worry about your IM problems.
2007-12-18T07:44:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	mneptok	well its not stealing to be correct, the person knows and just lets me
2007-12-18T07:45:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	so ask them to set you up with a static IP and a port forward
2007-12-18T07:45:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	mneptok	they dont even have admin control, its not installed on their computer
2007-12-18T07:48:00.000Z	mneptok	NeT_DeMoN	please stop asking about how to get unauthorized access to a router you do not own
