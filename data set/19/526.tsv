2012-01-14T08:06:00.000Z	gdoteof		i am on 11.10; i added another keyboard layout because i am in south america right now.
2012-01-14T08:06:00.000Z	gdoteof		i got a little widget in my toolbar that allowed me to easily switch between them
2012-01-14T08:06:00.000Z	gdoteof		but after i reset my computer; the widget went away
2012-01-14T08:06:00.000Z	gdoteof		and i don't see how to add things to the top anymore; since unity

2012-01-14T08:11:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	no idea.  i don't even know what that means
2012-01-14T08:12:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	hrm.  i have nothing on the bottonm.  i have on the left a panel
2012-01-14T08:13:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	the keyboard from the system settings?  it does not drag
2012-01-14T08:14:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	yeah i was thinking of doing that.  it seems to be the direction things are going so i thought i'd get used to it
2012-01-14T08:14:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	i used xmonad before; and exclusively for a while but i fail at connecting to wireless without a widget
2012-01-14T08:15:00.000Z	Demonstrate	gdoteof	have you tried, using NDISwrapper?
2012-01-14T08:15:00.000Z	Demonstrate	gdoteof	are you using linux drivers for your wireless network?
2012-01-14T08:16:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	i tried a lot and failed.  maybe i will pick it up again eventually.  i don't have so much tiem to fight with my desktop right now
2012-01-14T08:16:00.000Z	gdoteof	Demonstrate	no i am using the proprietary ones
2012-01-14T08:16:00.000Z	Demonstrate	gdoteof	the options in keyboard and language, lets you set ctrl+shift and key combonations like that to change language configureations
