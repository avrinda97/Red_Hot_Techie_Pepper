2008-09-14T06:39:00.000Z	Jay^		is the one designed for ubuntu an extended partition ?
2008-09-14T06:40:00.000Z	Jay^		you have 2 re-install the kernel
2008-09-14T06:40:00.000Z	Jay^		i think u can do it with dpkg
2008-09-14T06:41:00.000Z	Jay^		well i don't think linux can see a windows volume in the exnteded partition
2008-09-14T06:43:00.000Z	Jay^		hum
2008-09-14T06:44:00.000Z	Jay^		u can boot debian CD1 and go 2 a shell and re-install grub from there
2008-09-14T06:44:00.000Z	Jay^		did, one addresses memory in chuncks of 32bits and the other 64.. :)
2008-09-14T06:45:00.000Z	Jay^		rjwoestn, putty ?
2008-09-14T06:45:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	looking
2008-09-14T06:47:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	will this allow me to transfer a source file to the desktop and compile it using a program on the remote host?
2008-09-14T06:47:00.000Z	Jay^	rjwoestm	yes
2008-09-14T06:48:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	should i install the putty-tools package also?
2008-09-14T06:50:00.000Z	Jay^	rjwoestm	putty on it's own should be sufficient for normal SSH operation
2008-09-14T06:51:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	putty-tools was auto-selected by synaptic when i clicked to install putty hahah
2008-09-14T07:04:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	i connected but i just get a terminal .. how do i connect graphically, like if i am sitting at the workstation? can putty do that too?
2008-09-14T07:05:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	Ubuntu Hardy
2008-09-14T07:06:00.000Z	Jay^	rjwoestm	unforteuntely i've only done it with a windows program called hummingbird. it can also be done with cygwin i believe
2008-09-14T07:08:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	I can't even figure out how to transfer a file from my machine to the one i am connected to
2008-09-14T07:10:00.000Z	rjwoestm	Jay^	there is a little check-box (unchecked) that says "Enable X11 forwarding" // below that it has a field and asks "X display location"
