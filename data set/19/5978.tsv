2008-04-05T09:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 its a better idea to forget you ever HEARD about automatix at all.
2008-04-05T09:19:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	: thanks for lettin me know.
2008-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 i normaly install the nvidia drivers,   run sudo nvidia-settings --twinview, restart X, then tweak the setup with sudo nvidia-xconfig
2008-04-05T09:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 i may have that backwards.. :)   run sudo nvidia-xconfig --twinview, then sudo nvidia-settings
2008-04-05T09:27:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	i was gunna say gave me a unrecognized option
2008-04-05T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 its weird.. the X gui command has NO X in the command.. while the text based tool.. has a X in the name. :)
2008-04-05T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 nvidia-xconfig -A   to see all the options
2008-04-05T09:28:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	so restart X with alt+crlt+backspace?
2008-04-05T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 thats one way
2008-04-05T09:29:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	is that a good way to do so?
2008-04-05T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	you DID backup your original xorg.conf  ? i hope.
2008-04-05T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 or logout and use 'restart x server'  in the menus
2008-04-05T09:30:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	Fizz= new to linux, which means not used to backups
2008-04-05T09:30:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	ill restart X now....i hope it works....
2008-04-05T09:34:00.000Z	fizzbane	Dr_willis	that seemed to work out just nicely
2008-04-05T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 i found the cube effect combined with  multi monitors..  to be.. lacking :)
2008-04-05T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fizzbane	 of course i find the cube to be a bit on the  useless side anyway
