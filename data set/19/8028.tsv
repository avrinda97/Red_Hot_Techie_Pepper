2007-05-14T10:10:00.000Z	margorach		Has anyone had problems with devices in /dev having incorrect permissions whenever the system is rebooted?
2007-05-14T10:11:00.000Z	void^	margorach	incorrect?
2007-05-14T10:14:00.000Z	margorach	void^	lots of devices with 660, when they should be 664 or 666.
2007-05-14T10:14:00.000Z	margorach	void^	eg. /dev/random & /dev/null both start at 660
2007-05-14T10:15:00.000Z	margorach	void^	which prevents standard users from flushing stuff to /dev/null or using /dev/random (or /dev/urandom) to seed openssl and create ssh keys.
2007-05-14T10:16:00.000Z	void^	margorach	strange, what does 'grep null /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules' say?
2007-05-14T10:16:00.000Z	margorach	void^	KERNEL=="null",                         MODE="0666"
2007-05-14T10:18:00.000Z	void^	margorach	it ought to be 666 then, unless something chmods it explicitely or you aren't even using udev
2007-05-14T10:18:00.000Z	margorach	void^	yeah I know, it's a fiesty install, I've got about 4 other edgy installs that work fine.
2007-05-14T10:19:00.000Z	margorach	void^	If I change the permissions it's fine, but when I reboot they're back where they were.
2007-05-14T10:21:00.000Z	void^	margorach	what happens to those permissions when you run 'sudo udevtrigger'?
2007-05-14T10:22:00.000Z	margorach	void^	remain what I left them at.
2007-05-14T10:22:00.000Z	void^	margorach	even if you set them to something else first?
2007-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	margorach	void^	they remain what *I* set them to, not what they were on boot.
2007-05-14T10:24:00.000Z	void^	margorach	that certainly sounds like udev is utterly broken.
2007-05-14T10:24:00.000Z	margorach	void^	I was afraid that was going to be the answer.
2007-05-14T10:24:00.000Z	void^	margorach	do you have a tmpfs mounted on /dev?
2007-05-14T10:25:00.000Z	margorach	void^	udev on /dev type tmpfs (rw,mode=0755)
2007-05-14T10:34:00.000Z	margorach	void^	and someone just starting using the server, damn. Thanks for your help.
