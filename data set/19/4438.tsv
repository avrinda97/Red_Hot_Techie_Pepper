2009-05-27T07:56:00.000Z	V0iD_		Does 64bit Ubuntu have the same 32bit compatibility layer as windows?
2009-05-27T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 not the same sort of animal.
2009-05-27T07:57:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	Wat!
2009-05-27T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 i use 64bit system here.. works great.. no issues other then a very few apps not having 64bit versions for one reason or another. (i can name 1 app thats not 64bit compat)
2009-05-27T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 if you got 4+GB ram you will want 64bit.. otherwise.. try it.. or not..
2009-05-27T07:59:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	Yeah got 12Gb of ram so will do! I have wubi install so need to remove and get x64.
2009-05-27T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 wubi is  best avoided like the plague. :)
2009-05-27T07:59:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	Why?
2009-05-27T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 why bother? :) if you want to test linux out with windows.. use virtualbox.. much safer, and easier
2009-05-27T08:01:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	I have a tone of spare HDD but would only use them if i can get the ZFS working.
2009-05-27T08:02:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	I thought u would have a serious reason.
2009-05-27T08:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 hang out in here long enough and see the dozen+ people in a here a week with wubi issues.. and you will want to avoide it also.
2009-05-27T08:16:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	Are there any laptop PCI-E intel wireless N card Drivers for Ubuntu?
2009-05-27T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 it all depends on the chipset of the card i imagine.  wireless works in all 3 of my laptops.
2009-05-27T08:18:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	So no intel specific drivers
2009-05-27T08:20:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	I have wireless but just wanted to know if there are any intel drivers available for ubuntu!
2009-05-27T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 from what i gather most intel stuff works very well.
2009-05-27T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	V0iD_	 you would have to check the specifci card/chipset and see how well its supported.
2009-05-27T08:21:00.000Z	V0iD_	Dr_Willis	Thanks.
