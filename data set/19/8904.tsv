2007-01-17T11:41:00.000Z	kwayne		so, your nvidia module is not in the kernel anymore
2007-01-17T11:41:00.000Z	kwayne		thus X cannot load it
2007-01-17T11:41:00.000Z	kwayne		you're welcome
2007-01-17T11:41:00.000Z	kwayne		so, can anyone take a second and answer my question please? :)

2007-01-17T11:42:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	to do what? install something or upgrade?
2007-01-17T11:42:00.000Z	kwayne	gma	to install a newer version of a package
2007-01-17T11:42:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	you can try. may or may not cause a problem.
2007-01-17T11:43:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	depends on the specific package and it's dependencies.
2007-01-17T11:43:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	you can try it and back out if it looks like you're going to install too much stuff
2007-01-17T11:43:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	but in general it's not a great idea; when you revert to your dapper repo, what happens to that package?
2007-01-17T11:43:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	at some point in the future it'll get in your way
2007-01-17T11:43:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	it's often quite easy to rebuild an edgy package for dapper though
2007-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	kwayne		so, i better won't try
2007-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	kwayne		:)
2007-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	gma	kwayne	it can be a good learning experience!
2007-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	gma		;)
2007-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	kwayne	gma	reinstalling my ubuntu is an experience, too
