2010-05-02T09:04:00.000Z	amabo	Izinucs	localhost
2010-05-02T09:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	amabo	to display web content in apache?  if http://localhost doesn't work try http://127.0.0.1 .. if that does work then you need to edit the hosts file and add "localhost
2010-05-02T09:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	amabo	try localhost:631 and see if you get the cup server
2010-05-02T09:06:00.000Z	amabo		can't establish a connection at 127.0.0.1

2010-05-02T09:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	amabo	then you don't have apache installed.. do sudo tasksel and choose lamp
