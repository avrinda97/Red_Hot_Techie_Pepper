2005-07-04T16:06:00.000Z	mwe	JHK	you need the kernel source code
2005-07-04T16:07:00.000Z	JHK	mwe	i already installed it
2005-07-04T16:08:00.000Z	mwe	JHK	well that link needs to point to the kernel source tree
2005-07-04T16:09:00.000Z	mwe	JHK	ls -ld /lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/build does that point to the kernel source?
2005-07-04T16:10:00.000Z	JHK	mwe	/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.10-5-386
2005-07-04T16:11:00.000Z	mwe	JHK	you only have the headers?
2005-07-04T16:11:00.000Z	JHK	mwe	hmm, no, i also have the linux-source installed
2005-07-04T16:12:00.000Z	JHK		how should i change it?
2005-07-04T16:13:00.000Z	JHK	mwe	there its unzipped /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.10
2005-07-04T16:13:00.000Z	mwe		it need to point to the source tree. ln -fns /usr/src/LINUX_SOURCE /lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/build
2005-07-04T16:16:00.000Z	JHK	mwe	now it works a bit more but there is already an error
