2007-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	boselecta		am i the only one with an occasionallly thrashing disk all of a sudden?
2007-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	boselecta		at 10:30pm?
2007-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	next time it happens, run system monitor, see what's running
2008-01-11T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	you would think so
2008-01-11T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	did you only have to do it once? If so, possibly the swap partition got corrupted somehow
2008-01-11T08:15:00.000Z	boselecta	nickrud	no it's something i've been having to do routinely
2008-01-11T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	I would file a bug on bugs.ubuntu.com , that would definitely qualify in my mind
2008-01-11T08:20:00.000Z	boselecta	nickrud	i think it's something to do with hibernate
2008-01-11T08:21:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	I hibernate with no problem, or have been. (tries)
2008-01-11T08:24:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	no, everything fine here
2008-01-11T08:28:00.000Z	boselecta	nickrud	does your hibernate work?
2008-01-11T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	yes it did. No problems with swap either
2008-01-11T08:29:00.000Z	boselecta	nickrud	so my hibernate experience is that it spins the disk and then eventually powers off. it doesn't wake up on keypresses, and when i press the power button it reboots freshly.
2008-01-11T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	yes, that sounds like a bug. Not sure what to file it under, though.
2008-01-11T08:37:00.000Z	boselecta	nickrud	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/134680/comments/61
2008-01-11T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	you running the 2.6.24 kernel as well? (or is that you)
2008-01-11T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	not sure, I stopped watching the kernel much in the 2.4 series, I just use what I'm given these days
2008-03-08T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	how'd you set yours up?
2008-03-08T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	boselecta	is that with mplayer plugin? I ended up installing realplayer so I could watch bbc
