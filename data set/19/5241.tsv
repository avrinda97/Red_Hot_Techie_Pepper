2008-08-13T05:48:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Gnea	Are you serious?? You brought it up!
2008-09-06T07:44:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Gnea	which part do you hate? The whining, the lack of help, or the lack of followup?

2008-09-06T07:45:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Gnea	Why? They got no help - why bother contributing back?
2008-09-06T07:46:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Gnea	seriously, why would someone spend 15 mins document a problem that apparently no one gave a crap about?
2008-09-06T07:46:00.000Z	Gnea	joejoecircusboy	because they're taking it personally and injecting negativity into the community - this goes against what ubuntu's basic design.

2008-09-06T07:54:00.000Z	Gnea	joejoecircusboy	we don't put up with swearing in this channel. the c-word.
2008-09-06T07:55:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Gnea	'crap' has been the English word for 'fecal matter' for at least 1000 years. If you think it's a swear word, you need to get out into the real world once in awhile
2008-09-06T07:57:00.000Z	Gnea	joejoecircusboy	there's a difference between #ubuntu* and the real world.
