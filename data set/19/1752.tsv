2012-04-24T16:04:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	did you use wubi, or did you set up a traditional dual boot?
2012-04-24T16:04:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	traditional
2012-04-24T16:04:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	most likely grub didn't get installed to the MBR for some reason
2012-04-24T16:06:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	when this has happened to me in the past.
2012-04-24T16:07:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	yup this is exactly what happen
2012-04-24T16:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	yup, it's become more and more of a problem since manufacturers want to create 5-6 partitions on their drives now
2012-04-24T16:10:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	no.. you can just reinstall Ubuntu
2012-04-24T16:10:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	for some reason I have 4 partitions on the disc, where I just want two for windows and ubuntu
2012-04-24T16:11:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	i dunno, i don't do windows, i can't imagine why Windows would have so many partitions
2012-04-24T16:12:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	if I use gparted and partition manually 250 Win7 and 250 Ubuntu and install them seperately will that work?
2012-04-24T16:13:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	are you installing win 7 from cd?
2012-04-24T16:13:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	yes
2012-04-24T16:14:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	but honestly, you don't need to reinstall windows 7 (at least you usually don't)
2012-04-24T16:15:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	also, 250gigs for Ubuntu is crazy big.. you might want to short cut a folder that is on your 7 partition, and keep all data there, then just create a more "normal" ubuntu partition, say 15-20gigs.. but.. thats just my opinion
2012-04-24T16:16:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	I have a another drive that is 1TB that I use for that
2012-04-24T16:16:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	i'm not that familiar with win 7, so i'm always concerned w/ windows running out of space
2012-04-24T16:16:00.000Z	Chr|s	KM0201	Yeah, I turn off page file and only use windows for games
2012-04-30T13:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Chr|s	not really
