2012-04-24T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	do you use proprietary video drivers?
2012-04-24T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	is libreoffice slow as well?
2012-04-24T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	try reinstalling dkms, may help
2012-04-24T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	yes
2012-04-24T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	it should rebuild the video kernel driver and may help
2012-04-24T20:48:00.000Z	iLogical	ActionParsnip	still slow
2012-04-24T20:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	can you give a pastebin of the output of:  sudo lshw -C display; lsb_release -a; uname -a
2012-04-24T20:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	you are using the open source driver  'driver=radeon'
2012-04-24T20:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	were you using that before?
2012-04-24T20:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	uninstall the proprietary driver then reinstall it, may help
2012-04-24T20:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	works in some cases, like older ATi chips

2012-04-24T20:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogical	np man, may be a bug, not tried a newer release?
