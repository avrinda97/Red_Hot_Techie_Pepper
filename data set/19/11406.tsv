2006-01-26T14:34:00.000Z	KSean		I already did do the server thing and it worked
2006-01-26T14:34:00.000Z	KSean		Also, I'm giving it 10gb
2006-01-26T14:34:00.000Z	KSean		I installed the server then tried sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-01-26T14:35:00.000Z	KSean		I got an I/O error
2006-01-26T14:35:00.000Z	KSean		:S
2006-01-26T14:35:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	first thing to do is make sure you aren't just running out of space
2006-01-26T14:36:00.000Z	KSean	sethk	I think 10gb is enough :S
2006-01-26T14:36:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	well, ok, if you already know why it's failing ...
2006-01-26T14:40:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	five minutes ago it was 9 hours
2006-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	what is device hde?
2006-01-26T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	no
2006-01-26T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	does it ask you to put the cd in when you do the apt-get?
2006-01-26T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	you can probably get around it by removing the CD references from your list of repositories
2006-01-26T14:46:00.000Z	sethk	KSean	that will force it to get the stuff from the 'net
