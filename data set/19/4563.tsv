2009-08-13T10:15:00.000Z	Berzerker		oh lol
2009-08-13T10:15:00.000Z	Berzerker		yay
2009-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	Berzerker		that's how I installed it.
2009-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	Berzerker		yes
2009-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	Berzerker		I used that option once as well.
2009-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	Berzerker		USB flash drive would be cheaper though. :P
2009-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	Berzerker		you only need a 1GB max.
2009-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	Berzerker		indeed. That's how I've done it the past 3 installs I've done.
2009-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	Berzerker		although, I'm on the windows version. but you have the advantage of having a SSD drive. and opt for the 16GB if you can
2009-08-13T10:18:00.000Z	Berzerker		openoffice is extremely similar
2009-08-13T10:18:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	so does oo
2009-08-13T10:18:00.000Z	Berzerker	mjheagle8	yes that's what I said. oo supports those formats.
2009-08-13T10:19:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	sry, i wasnt paying too much attention
2009-08-13T10:19:00.000Z	Berzerker	mjheagle8	heh. np :P
2009-08-13T10:27:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	should be in the options
2009-08-13T10:27:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	right click...?
2009-08-13T10:28:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	there only is one notification area
2009-08-13T10:29:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	how? and why?
2009-08-13T10:29:00.000Z	mjheagle8	Berzerker	seems pointless
