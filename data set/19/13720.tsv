2005-03-14T11:14:00.000Z	prego		Attention Hoary guys: DO NOT CHOOSE ubuntu-artwork for update
2005-03-14T11:14:00.000Z	prego		(or if you do, check it is the only package you choose to)

2005-03-14T11:05:00.000Z	prego	zenrox	yes, but I got an error during installation with ubuntu-artwork package and it looks like the packages were only installed but not configured ????
2005-03-14T11:05:00.000Z	zenrox	prego	then do a apt-get install ubuntu-artwork
2005-03-14T11:06:00.000Z	prego	zenrox	thanks, I'll try prior to next reboot ;-)

2005-03-14T11:32:00.000Z	prego	zenrox	I'm in conflict with gnome-backgrounds package... I don't know when I installed that package and where from... ??? but after removal I've been able to install ubuntu-artwork. However apt should have detected that, isn't it?
