2007-12-24T03:25:00.000Z	LuitvD		I guess my ALSA stopped working... is that possible?
2007-12-24T03:27:00.000Z	LuitvD		my sound stopped working from one boot to the other... how is that possible?

2007-12-24T03:30:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	LuitvD	that has happened to me before, sometimes the volume controls mute themselves for some reason
2007-12-24T03:31:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	the strange thing is, I can't get ALSA to make a sound at all, and OSS does work
2007-12-24T03:31:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	but ALSA did work before
2007-12-24T03:32:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	LuitvD	yeah just double check it didnt re-mute it self.  if that wasn't the problem, then i don't know how to help :(
2007-12-24T03:32:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	right...
2007-12-24T03:33:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	thanks anyway, but I slammed the volume slider up and down numerous times
2007-12-24T03:33:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	maybe it's the kernel...
2007-12-24T03:33:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	no other updates could be changing ALSA's behaviour
2007-12-24T03:34:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	LuitvD	no no, not the slider, doubleclick the speaker icon and check the bottom row of icons
2007-12-24T03:35:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	I'll try
2007-12-24T03:36:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	looks like the ALSA mixer slider got reset, which can't be changed with the media-keys
2007-12-24T03:37:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	it works now...
2007-12-24T03:37:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	I never use the mixer window :P
2007-12-24T03:37:00.000Z	LuitvD	h4ngedm4n	thanks :) bye
