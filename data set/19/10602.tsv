2007-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	sudobash		cool
2007-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	sudobash		you can check the mount by just using the command like $ mount
2007-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	sudobash		just mount
2007-05-14T08:32:00.000Z	sudobash		$ means prompt
2007-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	sudobash		so does anyone know how ubuntu deals with the X windows as tty? like im trying to send an open xterm to the desktop
2007-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	sudobash		w calls the tty :0 for tty7?
2007-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	sudobash		should be something like xterm > tty7
2007-05-14T08:34:00.000Z	sudobash		guess i should go to the linux channel
2007-05-14T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	we're not ignoring you we just dont' know
2008-02-25T05:19:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	we do not badmouth windows here , there is no need
2008-11-25T01:00:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	what kind of background is it , I just came in I didn't see the beginning
2008-11-25T01:01:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	if you just want a solid colour desktop that is easy enough
2008-11-25T01:02:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	can you put up the image on imageshack so I can have a look at it , see what might be the problem
2008-11-25T01:03:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	do you have compiz enabled by anychance ? there is a wallpaper thingy in there that might be overrissind the regular wallpaper applet in gnome
2008-11-25T01:05:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	override the regular gnome wallpaper changer,  disable the wall paper stuff in compiz , seewhat happens,  actualy turn off compiz completely to test , that will be easier ,  you can ask more about this after in #compiz
2008-11-25T01:06:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	you don't , compiz will take over if the wallpaper pluggin is enabled in there
2008-11-25T01:07:00.000Z	Pelo	sudobash	ask in #compiz, see if they know
