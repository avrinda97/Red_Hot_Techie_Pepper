2012-03-29T21:48:00.000Z	meerkats		ok, now that I have failed to make a live cd in a ust stick im trying with a dvd-r
2012-03-29T21:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	how could you fail to make a live usb boot disk?
2012-03-29T21:49:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	noob, tried unetbooting and startup disk creator and both froze
2012-03-29T21:50:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	I have reformatted the usb unit twice with gparted to ext4 and ntfs but still nothing
2012-03-29T21:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	oh I guess it broke then
2012-03-29T21:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	well do you have any linux on a hard disk with grub2 still working?
2012-03-29T21:52:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	the one Im using right now...
2012-03-29T21:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	linux?  oh then there is another option to add an entry in grub2 boot menue to boot direct an iso file
2012-03-29T21:54:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	so I copy the .iso into the usb stick, and doing nothing else to it, reboot the craptop and select the fifth option of the boot menu?
2012-03-29T21:54:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	not exactly what I want to do: my ubuntu 11.10 is very unstable, it gets more unstable with every update
2012-03-29T21:55:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	I thoguh adding a live 11.10 cd to sources would give stability, as the machine would check the downloaded information with the written information in the iso
2012-03-29T21:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	all you really need that's stable it the grub mbr sector all the reset comes from the iso file http://ansi.23-5.eu/2011/10/21/howto-boot-iso-images-via-grub2-with-ubuntu/
2012-03-29T21:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	install iso direct from harddisk is like 10 times faster than off a cd drive
2012-03-29T22:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	oh and there is one more technical problem with this, you would need a second hard disk to install it on or posibly a secound prepartition already on the disk to be installed
2012-03-29T22:00:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	you mean for the link you justa gave me?
2012-03-29T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	yes
2012-03-29T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	because you wouldn't be able to change any partitions on the disk that the iso file resides on
2012-03-29T22:02:00.000Z	meerkats	sacarlson	please confirm that adding a working copy of 11.10 to software sources effectively renders the machine more stable
2012-03-29T22:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	meerkats	it's I'm not sure 11.10 is any more stable than what you already run,  but it would be what it is 11.10 ubuntu
