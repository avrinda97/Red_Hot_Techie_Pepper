2006-01-26T08:32:00.000Z	besfred		has anyone configured his 7/10 button mouse so that forward/backward works in firefox?
2006-01-26T08:32:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	yes, use xbindkeys and xvkbd to map them to ALT+LEFT and ALT+RIGHT.  What mouse do you have by the way?
2006-01-26T08:33:00.000Z	besfred	_jason	logitech cordless click plus. the button 6 and 7 also send button 2/3 events.
2006-01-26T08:35:00.000Z	besfred	_jason	any idea why those would send 2 button events?
2006-01-26T08:36:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	hrmm, what does your xorg.conf look like?
2006-01-26T08:39:00.000Z	besfred	_jason	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7452  is the relevant xorg.conf part
2006-01-26T08:40:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	can you use usb?  the evdev protocol might handle it better
2006-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	wait you are :), but it's conencted to usb right?
2006-01-26T08:43:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	I do't know if it matters but my xorg looks like this: Option          "Protocol"              "evdev"
2006-01-26T08:44:00.000Z	besfred	_jason	well worth a try. can you look what xev gives you as button events on the thumb buttons?
2006-01-26T08:45:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	my mouse like to sends multiple signals because of 'smartscroll' functionality (not for side buttons).  I can disable it using a program called 'lmctl'... I have no idea if it is something similar to what you are getting.  Does increasing or reducing the number of buttons fix the problem at any point (just to see)?
2006-01-26T08:46:00.000Z	besfred	_jason	nope. with 4 or 5, it just doesnt get any event. with more than 10 i havent tried
2006-01-26T08:47:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	mine just do 8 and 9
2006-01-26T08:47:00.000Z	besfred	_jason	my mousewheel allows horizontal scrolling
2006-01-26T08:48:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	hrmm mine gets 6 and 7
2006-01-26T08:48:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	firefox seems to understand those
2006-01-26T08:49:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	on that wiki page, that's how I set mine up.  It is basically like yours except I have zaxis mapping with 4 entries
2006-01-26T08:51:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	yeah, it just seems strange.  Because for mine, the 2 signals make sense.  But I don't think it would make sense to send 2 signals with one of them being right click
2006-01-26T08:52:00.000Z	_jason	besfred	yeah, I noticed that changing that modified how key reacted for me a lot
