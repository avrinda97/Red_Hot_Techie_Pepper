2009-08-06T10:48:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	DasEi: i took all necessary measures to disable autorun (including the vista patch), but i still don't trust that after the technical articles i've seen
2009-08-06T10:49:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	oh, vista... sorry, anything above XP doesnt exist in my personal reality... i don't know, how it is in vista. Should be the same, i think. You could just remove any executeable from the drive using a live cd.
2009-08-06T10:50:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	remove _every_ i meant
2009-08-06T10:50:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	yes, i had hoped to do that -- but i'm doing this from hundreds of miles away, and the man i'm helping has no transportation and no extra blank media
2009-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	i had him acquire one blank disc initially, and he cannot boot it for some reason (bad media, or lousy dvd reader)
2009-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	does he need to keep the software from the infected drive? Another issue would be worms (vbscript viruses, in docs)
2009-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	I plan on destroying any software I find on the drive as soon as we get him in a safe environment
2009-08-06T10:52:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	problems getting his new install online?
2009-08-06T10:53:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	you said, he had a freshly installed sys. Windows?
2009-08-06T10:53:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	yes, he recovered via the angel partition that laptops have
2009-08-06T10:54:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	i'd try to remote login to the machine, let the user connect the infected drive and hope, the sys wont get infected again. He could wipe the sys off again.
2009-08-06T10:56:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	http://antivirus.about.com/od/securitytips/ht/vista_autorun.htm
2009-08-06T10:58:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	appreciate that link, i did the registry fix as well as the WU patch, but given the risk involved i'll play it safe
2009-08-06T10:59:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	alright... i know your pain. I hope, you will survive it without permanent brain damage.
2009-08-06T11:00:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	i can handle situations like this with ease when i've got physical access to a machine, but when you're dealing with an already frustrated non-technical end-user from several states over, there's just no room for mistakes
2009-08-06T11:00:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	esp. when said person has no transportation
2009-08-06T11:00:00.000Z	sol93	qpoi_	as i said, i know this kind of situation. Good hunting!
2009-08-06T11:02:00.000Z	qpoi_	sol93	Neros, DasEi: appreciate the time and effort, will go ahead and do the wubi route
