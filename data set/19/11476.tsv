2007-03-29T14:42:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: thnx, overwrite is to get over the conflict?
2007-03-29T14:43:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: I'm testing a new driver, in place of new driver
2007-03-29T14:43:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: sorry tht should have read as I'm a testing a new driver, in place of old driver
2007-03-29T14:44:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: the i810 display driver.
2007-03-29T14:45:00.000Z	shirish		WaZ: tutorial for dpkg or what?
2007-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: I don't know. I just made a comment in https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-i810-modesetting/+bug/90213
2007-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: and there somebody has got a bleeding edge driver out
2007-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: the only thing I wanna know is what the overwrite flag is for, whether the driver works or not, tht's equally good. I can easily remove the old driver & do an apt-get for the older driver.
2007-03-29T14:48:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: I know but I don't want to lose Xserver till then, I wanna over-ride the conflict
2007-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	shirish		Waz: I've got 640*480 so it couldn't get any worse, I'm writing from windows otherwise its unsuable
2007-03-29T14:52:00.000Z	Jowi	shirish	what are you trying to do and what chipset do you have?
2007-03-29T14:52:00.000Z	shirish	Jowi	get some decent resolution like 800*600 or 1024*768, the chipset is i845G Intel Express
2007-03-29T14:53:00.000Z	Jowi	shirish	install 915resolution. reboot.
2007-03-29T14:53:00.000Z	shirish	Jowi	already have installed 915resolution, doesn't work
2007-03-29T14:55:00.000Z	Jowi	shirish	then you can put a modeline in xorg.conf. I've got the 945GM using i810 driver with 914resolution and wrote a few lines about it at http://www.burninghands.eu if you want to have a look. it is under "articles" -> linux on intel mac
2007-03-29T15:03:00.000Z	Jowi	shirish	you left before I could finish. if 915resolution does not help (it does help but you might need to put a modeline in xorg.conf). I've got the 945GM using i810 driver with 914resolution and wrote a few lines about it at http://burninghands.eu/#Xorg_Resolution if you want to have a look.
2007-03-29T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	shirish	sorry, the correct link should be http://burninghands.eu/linux-on-mac.html
2007-03-29T15:07:00.000Z	shirish	Jowi	thnx trying it out
2007-03-29T15:07:00.000Z	Jowi	shirish	especially don't forget to look at section 4.3 on that page (i'm not sure if it applies to exactly your chipset)
