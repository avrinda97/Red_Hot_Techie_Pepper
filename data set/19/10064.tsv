2006-08-11T10:05:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , it is about 5% above NTFS needed space.
2006-08-11T10:05:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , so if you had 100GB of hard drive space, and formatted it NTFS, if you reserve ~8%, ext3 will reserve abobut ~13%
2006-08-11T10:06:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , but a 5GB file will still take 5GB
2006-08-11T10:06:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , about that, yeah
2006-08-11T10:07:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , per formatted partition.
2006-08-11T10:07:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , thats pretty typical.
2006-08-11T10:07:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , cafuego is correct, but i would just go with the defaults and let it take the 13%
2006-08-11T10:08:00.000Z	cafuego	CyaniCs|transcde	The default is 5% actually
2006-08-11T10:08:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , it has to do with the journal on the disk (your datas protection)
2006-08-11T10:08:00.000Z	cafuego		Icemasta[God] : 'tune2fs' is the tool you're after.
2006-08-11T10:08:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde	cafuego	my typical is about 13%
2006-08-11T10:08:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde	cafuego	about 70gb on an 80gb partition, net result
2006-08-11T10:08:00.000Z	cafuego	CyaniCs|transcde	Not so much that as the reserved blocks count for root. That's all fine and well on /, but on /home it's kinda useless.
2006-08-11T10:09:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde	cafuego	true.
2006-08-11T10:09:00.000Z	cafuego	CyaniCs|transcde	No, the issue there is that an 80GB disk is NOT 80GiB - the 1024 factor.
2006-08-11T10:09:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde	cafuego	that also. i recognize that. but basically, a noob is best off knowing they are only getting 95% of the advertised space
2006-08-11T10:10:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde		Icemasta[God] , nope. i make no assumptions ;-) i am just trying to make it easy
2006-08-11T10:10:00.000Z	cafuego	CyaniCs|transcde	Aye, but 95% != 87% ;-)
2006-08-11T10:11:00.000Z	CyaniCs|transcde	cafuego	ok. i will just shut up and stick to my assessment of 13% on a typical partition
