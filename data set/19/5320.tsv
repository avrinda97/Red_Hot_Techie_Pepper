2011-06-19T08:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	Does it both not show up AND not work?
2011-06-19T08:30:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	lspci only shows two cards, i know the card works in other sysems
2011-06-19T08:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	does it work in this system?
2011-06-19T08:30:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	yes
2011-06-19T08:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	so what's the problem?
2011-06-19T08:31:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	i have 3 cards 2 are the same one of the two which is the same the one in the 3rd pci-e slot from the top isn't accessible
2011-06-19T08:32:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	the problem is i need all 3 for opencl
2011-06-19T08:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	Try that sentence again with punctuation so people can read it.
2011-06-19T08:33:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	i have 3 cards, they all work independently, but whichever is in the 8x pci-e slot(the bottom card) doesn't show up
2011-06-19T08:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Okay then.
2011-06-19T08:33:00.000Z	glassresistor		all are 6000s
2011-06-19T08:33:00.000Z	glassresistor		sorry i've bee up 2 days working on this
2011-06-19T08:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	HOW OLD IS THE MOBO?  iS IT UNDER WARRANTY?
2011-06-19T08:34:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	yes new got it this week
2011-06-19T08:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	in that case, call the vendor with your issue?  Sorry about the caps thing.
2011-06-19T08:36:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	yeah i doubt they will help with a issue this "complex" especially since its linux
2011-06-19T08:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	What do you mean "complex"?  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
2011-06-19T08:39:00.000Z	glassresistor	tonyyarusso	vendors never actually help
2011-06-19T08:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glassresistor	Then you need to buy from better vendors.
