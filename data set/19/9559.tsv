2006-10-23T16:33:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	we are all ears
2006-10-23T16:34:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	it's about sound. Alsa drivers to be exact.
2006-10-23T16:36:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	I wonder how one installs the newer version of alsa-base. the one in apt is 1.0.11 and the newest stable is 1.0.13.. and I wonder if I install the newer ones.. are they compatible with ubuntu and how do I do it...
2006-10-23T16:37:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	you'd probably need to recompile your kernel and use other black magic to achieve that. if the current drivers work, i'd advice leaving them as they are. if they don't, then there's still not much i'd be able to tell you, except for giving you a couple of pointers about kernel recompiling
2006-10-23T16:39:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	so I must recompile the linux-kernel.. why is that.. isn't it the alsa-base drivers that need recompilation?
2006-10-23T16:40:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	the alsa-base package doesn't contain kernel modules as far as i can see, but still i wouldn't upgrade a part of ALSA without upgrading all of it, i think
2006-10-23T16:40:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	so a part of the alsa is implented to the linux kernel?
2006-10-23T16:41:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	the low level drivers are
2006-10-25T05:24:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Channel_architecture
2006-10-25T05:24:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	Do I need it in my kernel?
2006-10-25T05:25:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	no
2006-10-25T05:25:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	cool.. so it's like the support for ISA bus.. that dissaperd along time ago.. lol
2006-10-25T05:26:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	no, ISA stayed for much longer than MCA. a 1.2GHz machine i have has ISA still.
2006-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	and on the other hand, do expect lack of automatic security fixes ;)
2006-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	u mean security of the kernel.. I still can download stuff via apt ?
2006-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	not kernel fixes.
2006-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	maxflax	LjL	ok... I can live with that.. I can recompile the kernel when I want the new modules
2006-10-31T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	maxflax	OSS has been deprecated from the Linux kernel since a few years
