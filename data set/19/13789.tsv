2005-07-29T15:58:00.000Z	v1ru5		actually i haven't ecked it with md5 :P
2005-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	v1ru5		 hm
2005-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	v1ru5		how do i check cd's md5?
2005-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	v1ru5		when its already burned
2005-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	what OS are you on?
2005-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	ok, is the CD mounted?
2005-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	there's a file md5sum.txt in the CD's root
2005-07-29T16:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	go to that directory, and type 'md5sum -v -c md5sum.txt'
2005-07-29T16:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	do you have a root password? did you enter one during install?
2005-07-29T16:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	then use 'su -c <command>' instead
2005-07-29T16:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	entering the root password
2005-07-29T16:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	you can add yourself to the sudo list by doing something like 'EDITOR=gedit su -c visudo /etc/sudoers'
2005-07-29T16:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	v1ru5	yeah, you can do 'su -c aptitude' to, but ubuntu gnome admin apps (and most people here) will assume you have sudo setup
