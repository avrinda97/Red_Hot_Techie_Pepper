2004-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf change Driver "kbd" to Driver "keyboard"
2004-12-27T06:14:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	why...it works now
2004-12-27T06:14:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	kbd should work fine
2004-12-27T06:17:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	yes your right sorry, that should have been the other way, keyboard is depreciated
2004-12-27T06:18:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	i just read a doc the other day about differences in xorg and xfree config, and my memory was a bit cloudy, just looked again to refresh
2004-12-27T06:19:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	the kbd is working fine....but as soon as I run sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart then the y and z gets switched...if I change it to use xfree86 and keyboard or just keyboard no changes are made when I restart the service again
2004-12-27T06:20:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	which version of xorg
2004-12-27T06:21:00.000Z	scizzo		6.8.1
2004-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	yeah, that was the other thing that was confusing me, xorg 6.7.x and xfree 4.4 both use keyboard, and xorg 6.8.x uses kbd iirc
2004-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	scizzo		ok
2004-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	scizzo		well I am going to test another thing now
2004-12-27T06:24:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	which is odd because if thats the case, im using xorg 6.8.1 myself, and the keyboard driver
2004-12-27T06:26:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	I can try it again if you want to
2004-12-27T06:27:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	have you tried doing changes or even tried /etc/init.d/gdm restart?
2004-12-27T06:28:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	its not when it first boots up...that works fine when it goes from a reboot or something...its when I need to restart X that it changes the keys
2004-12-27T06:28:00.000Z	scizzo		tried using the keyboard driver now...I still get the same result
2004-12-27T06:29:00.000Z	linux_mafia		ok, that sounds like some kind of a bug then
2004-12-27T06:30:00.000Z	linux_mafia	scizzo	but ive not seen similar problems
2004-12-27T06:30:00.000Z	scizzo	linux_mafia	the logfile is happy with kbd
