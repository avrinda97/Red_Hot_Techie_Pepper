2007-01-04T17:42:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	isnt the live cd system loaded to ram - also you only need one cd burner and a cd reader
2007-01-04T17:44:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	i can get them for about 20 which is about 40 us dollars
2007-01-04T17:44:00.000Z	bruenig	hjmills	well the lowest I could fine was 60 bucks
2007-01-04T17:45:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	us dollars? odd - normally stuff here in the uk is more expensive - try www.ebuyer.com - i think it does the us as well
2007-01-18T17:23:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	i find notepad on wine by far the easiest as i dont have to learn the complexities of gedit or another text editor
2007-01-18T17:38:00.000Z	bruenig	hjmills	you will have to add the command to sudoers
2007-01-18T17:38:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	how do i do that?
2007-01-18T17:39:00.000Z	bruenig	hjmills	do sudo visudo, then add this line "username localhost= NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown -h now" with your own username substituting
2007-01-18T17:39:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	thanks :D
2007-07-03T10:40:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	the normal argument is that aptitude removes packages that were installed as dependencies when you remove the package that depended on them provided no other package needs them
2007-07-03T10:41:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	it didn't used to iirc, now I think you need to use apt-get clean
2007-07-03T10:41:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	or apt-get autoremove
2007-07-03T10:41:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	if it was in earlier versions of apt I dont think it told you there was stuff to remove
2007-07-03T10:43:00.000Z	bruenig	hjmills	it should already
2007-07-03T10:44:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	I am symlinking a directory full of symlinks into /var/www so they are accessible over the network but the symlinks arent showing up
2007-07-03T10:51:00.000Z	hjmills	bruenig	Oops, my bad - the program creating the symlinks created them in the wrong directory...
