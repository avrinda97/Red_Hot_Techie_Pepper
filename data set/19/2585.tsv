2010-02-25T12:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	it is
2010-02-25T12:45:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	awesome, thanks
2010-02-25T12:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	ahe, I think it was called that in Jaunty
2010-02-25T13:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	That's the best explanation I've seen in years
2010-02-25T13:48:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	:)
2010-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	seriously, the last time someone explained that to me it was paragraphs out of a tech manual.. I wanted to stab my ears with scissors
2010-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	haha, tech manuals are never fun
2010-02-27T10:47:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	probably not. installed libraries needed for dependencies, etc may be different
2010-02-27T10:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	Ah, very good point
2010-03-10T15:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	how do you revert it back to requiring a username and password in Karmic?
2010-03-10T15:20:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	sudo -u gdm gconftool-2 --set --type boolean /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true
2010-03-10T15:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	done that weeks ago, never worked for me
2010-03-10T15:21:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	did you remember the -u gdm part? i missed that the first time through and couldn't figure out why
2010-03-10T15:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	Oh, no, didn't get that. I'll try that now
2010-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	that command works great, thanks. I've been trying to accomplish that for a while.
2010-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	glad I could help :)
2010-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	brjann	ardchoille	(and glad I still had it bookmarked)
2010-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	hehe
2010-03-10T15:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	brjann	just fyi, that setting is in /var/lib/gdm/.gconf.defaults line 22
