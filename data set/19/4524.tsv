2008-12-30T01:18:00.000Z	costlyeffects		can anyone tell me how to put up a external hard drive on nfs?
2008-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	Is it a LAN connected drive with NFS support, or do you want to export an USB connected drive to NFS clients?
2008-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	costlyeffects		it is a usb drive connected to an nfs client
2008-12-30T01:20:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	Please elaborate. Which machine is the drive usb cable connected to, and which machine needs access to it?
2008-12-30T01:21:00.000Z	costlyeffects		machine 192.168.1.3 is connected to it and machine 192.168.1.2 needs access to it.
2008-12-30T01:22:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	Is .3 running NFS services today?
2008-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	costlyeffects		both are
2008-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	Then it
2008-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	costlyeffects		both server and client on both
2008-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	costlyeffects		what?
2008-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	Then it's just to export it from the first and mount it on the second.
2008-12-30T01:23:00.000Z	costlyeffects		thats what im trying to do
2008-12-30T01:24:00.000Z	costlyeffects		what do you think im trying to do
2008-12-30T01:24:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	Nothing special about USB drives, other than that it needs to be connected before the client attempts to mount..
2008-12-30T01:24:00.000Z	costlyeffects		ok
2008-12-30T01:24:00.000Z	costlyeffects	hno1	how do i mount it ?
2008-12-30T01:25:00.000Z	costlyeffects		hno1
2008-12-30T01:26:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	on the server, add the drive to /etc/fstab (with a LABEL or UUID, not device name... USB device names is strange..) and /etc/exports
2008-12-30T01:27:00.000Z	hno1	costlyeffects	on the client, also add it to /etc/fstab but with a filesystem type of nfs, and device serveraddress:/mount/point (where it's mounted on the server)
