2010-05-11T00:57:00.000Z	acerimmer_	kristian_	download and install from the *gz file on that page.
2010-05-11T00:58:00.000Z	kristian_	acerimmer_	i will attempt to do the impossible! ;-D
2010-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	acerimmer_	kristian_	take your time and come back if it doesn't fly as expect.  FWIW isn't there a firefox plugin that will do the same thing??
2010-05-11T01:00:00.000Z	acerimmer_	kristian_	"youtube to MP3" firefox addon
2010-05-11T01:00:00.000Z	kristian_	acerimmer_	yeah someone mentioned a firefox addon that would download the video, maybe there is one that will download and convert to mp3 as well... not sure...
2010-05-11T01:00:00.000Z	kristian_	acerimmer_	oh thanks! :-)
2010-05-11T01:00:00.000Z	kristian_	acerimmer_	btw what is FWIW?
