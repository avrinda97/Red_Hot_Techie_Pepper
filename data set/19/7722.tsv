2007-07-07T11:44:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras or install it from synaptic or the application > add/remove, search for restricted
2007-07-07T11:45:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	any of those will install a bunch of goodies to get you going including flash and a few codecs
2007-07-07T11:45:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	let me know how that goes
2007-07-07T11:51:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	did you install that package?
2007-07-07T11:52:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2007-07-07T11:55:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	that is ok, just wait for it to finish and then try to play the video

2007-07-07T12:25:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	im working on it, but you might want to mention to the channel youre having trouble getting your external sound card to work
2007-07-07T12:26:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	before you do, does sound work in videos not online, like local videos lke one of the example videos installed with the system
2007-07-07T12:28:00.000Z	inayet	Shadow6363	Are there any videos on my ubuntu systems that came with it?
2007-07-07T12:29:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	there should be an Examples folder on your desktop or in your home folder, if not you should be able to create a new user and that user will have them
2007-07-07T12:29:00.000Z	Shadow6363	inayet	or just google for a .avi and download it
