2007-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	zukero		hi
2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	zukero		i have an Intel core 2 duo processor. should I install ubuntu  x86 or x64 version ?
2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	zukero		ok
2007-01-20T16:39:00.000Z	zukero		ok thanks
2007-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	zukero		'cause i'm running the same install i had on my old P4, and with my c2d, it keeps crashing
2007-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	zukero		guess i'm on for a reinstall
2007-01-20T16:41:00.000Z	owh	zukero	I'd be surprised if you need a re-install. I migrated my installation for seven years across countless platforms.
2007-01-20T16:42:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: i got less crashing when i removed the ndiswrapper driver i compiled for the P4, but I still can't get uptime more than 24hrs
2007-01-20T16:42:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: X keeps crashing
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	owh	zukero	What was your "old" hardware, and what is your "new" hardware?
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: old was P4 2ghz, new is core 2 duo 1.9 ghz
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	owh	zukero	Same VGA?
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: yeah, geforce 6600 agp
2007-01-20T16:44:00.000Z	owh	zukero	I'd be even more surprised if you need to re-install. I'd try by seeing what syslog tells you and what the x-logs show.
2007-01-20T16:45:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: where's the X log ?
2007-01-20T16:45:00.000Z	owh	zukero	/var/log
2007-01-20T16:45:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: :) *dumb*
2007-01-20T16:45:00.000Z	owh	zukero	Heh.
2007-01-20T16:46:00.000Z	zukero	owh	: just waking up, a bit dizzy
