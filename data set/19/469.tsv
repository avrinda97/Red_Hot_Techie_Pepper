2012-05-18T12:39:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	Not a programmer, but I have my whole `~/Documents/' directory in a git repo on a USB stick I have. I just "push" new changes to the stick (about every week) and "pull" them onto a separate computer when I want them updated. Keeps the sets of files consistent. Much easier than emailing myself a change everytime I update the file.
2012-05-18T12:40:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	do you recommend a git for me?
2012-05-18T12:42:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	I *do* recommend git. It's not an issue to set up, and has some really nice tools available. I do the pushes manually, but you could run it every 5 minutes (if you wrote a naive script, it could be a bit painful)
2012-05-18T12:42:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	heh, Git is the git. Sorry.
2012-05-18T12:43:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	What do you mean by naive script, could be painful??
2012-05-18T12:44:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	Well, presumably you'd only want to issue the push if the file had actually changed. In a naive script, you probably wouldn't take that into account.
2012-05-18T12:45:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	I'll check git out I think It'll do the job. I was actually thinking about writing a perl process which did the job, it wouldn't be sooo hard.
2012-05-18T12:46:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	Git is pretty amazing.
2012-05-18T12:52:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	Do you use LyX for LaTeX?
2012-05-18T12:53:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	No. What's lyx?
2012-05-18T12:54:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	Just a WYSIWYG-esque LaTeX editor :) (I'm in the same boat, I mainly just write latex files)
2012-05-18T12:56:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	I just apt-get lyx to check it out. Normally I just use latexila.
2012-05-18T13:41:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	I get a error openin .nano_history file permission denied when i run git commit, why is git even wanting to open that file?
2012-05-18T13:43:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	What directory did you initialise git in?
2012-05-18T13:45:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	home
2012-05-18T13:46:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	Not sure, but you could add the file .nano_history to the .gitignore file.
2012-05-18T13:49:00.000Z	Josssse	chu	Shoot, one deleted another of my files! Is there some sort of ubuntu one log I can check out to see what it's doing exactly?
2012-05-18T13:49:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	I don't really know anything about Ubuntu One. Sorry.
2012-05-18T13:50:00.000Z	chu	Josssse	hehe, sorry I couldn't be more help.
