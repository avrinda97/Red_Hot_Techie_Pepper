2006-09-13T10:14:00.000Z	ViperFox		Can any one here give me some help with nvidia and tv out?
2006-09-13T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 i set up twinview. and hacked my xorg to get it working.. found an example at a gentoo wiki page.
2006-09-13T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 ive not seen a walkthrough. I set up twinview and  set up the tv as if it was a monitor.
2006-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 the ubuntu wiki/forums may have some guides now.
2006-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 i  had to install the nvidia drivers.. then the dang X server defaulted to showing on the tv..
2006-09-13T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	  My xorg.conf --> http://usalug.org/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=25
2006-09-13T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 yes? :P
2006-09-13T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 you may want to enalble the clone mode
2006-09-13T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 i dont have the twinview docs memorised. :P not sure exactly.. ive twiddeld with the stuff so much.
2006-09-13T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 i recall a clone option somewhere.. :) perhaps in one of my other xorg.confs
2006-09-13T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 it pays to read/learn/tweak.. it can work..  ya just got to figure out what to change..
2006-09-13T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	http://usalug.org/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=26   i THINK has the clone option.
2006-09-13T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 i got a collection of like 20 different xorg.confs i messed with. :P
2006-09-13T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 also the  xorg configure tools i hear CAN set up twinview. but not sure how it handles tv out.
2006-09-13T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 be sure to backup your working xorg.conf files - and the command that MAY set it up.. is...
2006-09-13T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 ' sudo nvidia-xconfig -twinview '
2006-09-13T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 what did?
2006-09-13T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 no clue on that.. ive never used it. :P just saw it in that book.
2006-09-13T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ViperFox	 plus thers the ntsc/pal settings that may vary.
