2011-01-31T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	web browsers are fine, or you can use torrents
2011-01-31T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	its just a file, remember to MD5 test it before you use it
2011-01-31T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	makes life easier if it is ;)
2011-01-31T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	I suggest you create a seperate /home partition too
2011-01-31T22:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	I recommend 3, 10Gb for / formatted Ext4, 1xRAM for swap, the rest for /home formatted Ext4
2011-02-05T08:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	np bro, you'll help others as you learn
2011-02-05T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	you will need notepad++ to thn resave it as Linux uses different CR characters to Linux
2011-02-06T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	for what reason?
2011-02-06T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	lucid comes from light. Natty means a bit crazy or messy
2011-02-06T07:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	it does matter
2011-02-12T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	yes, it exists
2011-02-14T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	it's google's public DNS service, Google has many services
2011-02-14T21:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	they are all essentially the same OS, Linux. Just the differences are default WM/DE and package management system
2011-02-24T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	what file?
2011-02-24T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxNoob	tar zxvf python-2.7.1.tgz     will extract it. I don't suggest you mess with python, it can make things go horribly wrong if you screw it up
