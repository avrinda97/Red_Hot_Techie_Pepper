2009-05-06T13:50:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	Does that mean you know how to rename them back?
2009-05-06T13:51:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	that was for you.     ls -l
2009-05-06T13:53:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	  First  mv 87mfcy9p.default.save 87mfcy9p.default
2009-05-06T13:53:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	Sorry.  Good luck, then
2009-05-06T13:54:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	after the rename, firefox should run.   Go to a terminal prompt and start it with    firefox -ProfileManager
2009-05-06T13:56:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	  Yes.  Did you get the dialog for that?  If so create a new one and see if you can load your addins there.
2009-05-06T13:57:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	What does it say, exactly?
2009-05-06T13:58:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	creating a folder should be fine.
2009-05-06T13:58:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	use default.
2009-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	On the Right?   What happens if you go to the Tools menu and choose Add-ons?  Do they show there?
2009-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	I don't know what that thing on the right is that you speak of.  I think I would need a picture.  It might be that the addins are all working fine.
2009-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	Do I follow what?
2009-05-06T14:06:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	Good news.  Good luck.
2009-05-06T14:10:00.000Z	Severian	ubuntistas12	Yes.  That will take a little time and I just started on something with scizo.  Can we talk about that later.
