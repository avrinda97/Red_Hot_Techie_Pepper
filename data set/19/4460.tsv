2009-01-10T02:22:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	jussi01	I just installed b43-fwcutter on 8.10 and I don't know how to use it
2009-01-10T02:22:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I already tried ndiswrapper/ndisgrk with no luck
2009-01-10T02:22:00.000Z	jussi01		!bcm43xx | TheFunkbomb

2009-01-10T02:23:00.000Z	jussi01	TheFunkbomb	also, the device is not listed in restricted drivers?
2009-01-10T02:23:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		nope
2009-01-10T02:23:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		wait, would fwcutter install it in there?
2009-01-10T02:23:00.000Z	jussi01	TheFunkbomb	then have a look at the links from ubottu ^^
2009-01-10T02:23:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	jussi01	will do.  Thanks!
2009-01-10T02:24:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		it doesn't include 8.10
2009-01-10T02:24:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		8.04 is the latest documented
2009-01-10T02:25:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		you know what?  I gotta just reboot in linux and muck with it until it works
2009-01-10T02:25:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		hopefully, next time you'll see me will be via ubuntu
