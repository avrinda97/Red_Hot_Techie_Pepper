2011-03-26T03:25:00.000Z	dejan_		how can I give apache user access to edit file?
2011-03-26T03:25:00.000Z	dejan_		my pache server is set to use apache user
2011-03-26T03:26:00.000Z	dejan_		and it don't have permision to write files
2011-03-26T03:26:00.000Z	DaPenguin	dejan_	giving an apache user perms to write files is probably a bad idea...
2011-03-26T03:27:00.000Z	dejan_	DaPenguin	any suggestion what should I do?
2011-03-26T03:27:00.000Z	dejan_		I need to write into few files that are in www folder
2011-03-26T03:28:00.000Z	DaPenguin	dejan_	sudo up to edit the files you need to.
2011-03-26T03:28:00.000Z	dejan_		can I make the files open for writing?
2011-03-26T03:28:00.000Z	dejan_		no no
2011-03-26T03:28:00.000Z	dejan_		you don't understood me, I have php script that edit some files in www folder
2011-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	dejan_		when I open the php file (execute the script) it should write into few files
2011-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	dejan_		5 files only
2011-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	dejan_		can I make these files open for writing ?
2011-03-26T03:30:00.000Z	dejan_		i think i can do this with chmod command
2011-03-26T03:30:00.000Z	dejan_		im new to linux sry
2011-03-26T03:30:00.000Z	DaPenguin	dejan_	you can change the owner of those files to the apache user
2011-03-26T03:30:00.000Z	dejan_		is that better or should I lower the access of the files?
2011-03-26T03:31:00.000Z	DaPenguin	dejan_	well, think about it this way. who do you want to have write access to those files?
2011-03-26T03:32:00.000Z	dejan_	DaPenguin	for these files only me now, but later I will also need permsion for visitors of my website to upload files
