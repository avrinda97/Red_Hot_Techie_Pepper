2011-09-06T20:01:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__		i have suspicions it might be the micro sd => sd card adapter
2011-09-06T20:01:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__		as i know other sd cards have worked with this
2011-09-06T20:01:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__		without drivers etc
2011-09-06T20:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 you may want to check the forums for that exact make laptop. Often theres some kernel options needed for  some special cases.
2011-09-06T20:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 ive also seen some cases where the card Must be inserted at boot time. or else the system cant see/access it..  (which is annoying, but thats how my netbook is)
2011-09-06T20:02:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	rather
2011-09-06T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 You are not plugging a 'sdhc' card into a normal 'sd' slot are you?   saw that issue once. :)
2011-09-06T20:04:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	i'm plugging in a microsd hc card into a microsd to sd adapter
2011-09-06T20:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 ive seen where a 'sdhc' (high capacity) card wont work on an older 'sd'  slot.   how big is the card?
2011-09-06T20:05:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	16gb
2011-09-06T20:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 be sure the slot says its a sdhc slot perhaps?  in system specs or printed on teh pc somewhere.
2011-09-06T20:05:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	slot reader should support it according to The multi-card reader only supports SD and SDHC cards with Ubuntu 10.10.
2011-09-06T20:07:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	i think its the fault of the adatper
2011-09-06T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 could be.  I got a little  mini-usb adaptor i always use for my micro sd cards these days. i rarely use a microsd-sd adaptor
2011-09-06T20:08:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	what do you mean mini-usb adaptor
2011-09-06T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 its a litlte plug about the size of the end of your pinky. :) microsd plugs into it.. it has a usb plug on the other end.
2011-09-06T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 cost me like $5 on amazon.com
2011-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	arooni-mobile__	Dr_Willis	what would you recommend?
2011-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile__	 I always use that usb adaptor for mine. it always works. :)
