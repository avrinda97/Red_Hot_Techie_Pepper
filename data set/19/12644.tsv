2005-07-30T16:20:00.000Z	postmodern		is there a way i can download all the ubuntu updates since last release
2005-07-30T16:21:00.000Z	postmodern		im going to be installing ubuntu on a dialup box, no way I want it to download it all over 56k
2005-07-30T16:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	There aren't that many updates.
2005-07-30T16:21:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	how big is the average one?
2005-07-30T16:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	archive.ubuntu.com if you can figure your way around
2005-07-30T16:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	but that has warty, hoary, and breezy stuff all lumped together in /pool
2005-07-30T16:22:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	excellent
2005-07-30T16:23:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	yeah im just going with the latest update branch
2005-07-30T16:27:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	so what would i need to d/l that i could feed into synaptic so that everything can be updated easily?
2005-07-30T16:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	There isn't anything like that.
2005-07-30T16:28:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	isn't there some distfiles directory that i could just put them all
2005-07-30T16:29:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	so synaptic/apt-get dosn't have to d/l them
2005-07-30T16:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	I know there is a dir that apt checks before pulling them off the internet but I'm on windows right now so I can't look it up. Sorry.
2005-07-30T16:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	You're not running the extensions that break it.
2005-07-30T16:32:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	which extensions?
2005-07-30T16:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	I dunno, ask #ubuntu-devel
2005-07-30T16:34:00.000Z	postmodern	Amaranth	alright i was worried firefox was severaly broken, not just a minor bug
2005-07-30T16:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	pretty major if you have one of the extensions installed
2005-08-05T16:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	postmodern	synaptic
