2008-04-03T02:55:00.000Z	Steven2		Make is still not working. Message reads: 'make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.'
2008-04-03T02:55:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	you need to run make in a directory with a make file in it
2008-04-03T02:55:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	try cd src; make
2008-04-03T02:56:00.000Z	Steven2	WheelsOnFire	Well then the program install is broken then. Because I'm trying to run it in the directory for the install.
2008-04-03T02:57:00.000Z	Steven2	WheelsOnFire	All of the installs that I run are like that though.
2008-04-03T02:57:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	make is for compiling the source. it needs a file called Makefile which tells it what to do
2008-04-03T02:57:00.000Z	Steven2	WheelsOnFire	Well the install doc said to run ./configure make and make install.
2008-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	yes I know how to build from source.
2008-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	you know how to pastebin?
2008-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	Steven2	WheelsOnFire	Well it doesn't work. None of them do.
2008-04-03T02:58:00.000Z	Steven2	WheelsOnFire	No.
2008-04-03T02:59:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	pastebin.com paste the results of ls -R
2008-04-03T02:59:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	it's a website so that you don't flood this channel with a whole bunch of lines of code
2008-04-03T02:59:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	so you temporarily post it on a website and give me the link
2008-04-03T03:01:00.000Z	WheelsOnFire	Steven2	well?
