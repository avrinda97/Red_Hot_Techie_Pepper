2004-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	wfx		poweroff does not work, where do i find the infos to get it also work under ubuntu
2004-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	theine	wfx	what's your machine?
2004-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	wfx	theine	pc with amd cpu mainboard is gibayte, yes i have test it with apm
2004-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	theine	wfx	no clue in that case
2004-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	theine	wfx	and you do have the apm module loaded, right?
2004-11-19T08:22:00.000Z	theine	wfx	and you are running apmd
2004-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	wfx	theine	no apmd is running
2004-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	theine	wfx	that might be the reason then
2004-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	theine	wfx	wait, it is running you say?
2004-11-19T08:24:00.000Z	wfx	theine	ps -xa | grep apm say yes it is up
2004-11-19T08:25:00.000Z	theine	wfx	I guess you're really unlucky in this case
2004-11-19T08:25:00.000Z	wfx	theine	i test it, back in 1min. :-)
2004-11-19T08:32:00.000Z	wfx	theine	i have add noacpi acpi=off now it works
2004-11-19T08:33:00.000Z	theine	wfx	good to hear that
2004-11-19T08:33:00.000Z	theine	wfx	what's your machine by the way?
2004-11-19T08:34:00.000Z	wfx	theine	it a normal pc with an amd cpu, what info you want
2004-11-19T08:34:00.000Z	theine	wfx	right, i already asked...
2004-11-19T08:36:00.000Z	theine	wfx	i think that's quite unrelated to apm/acpi
2004-11-19T08:37:00.000Z	wfx	theine	rhythmbox, yes it is :)
