2007-06-26T08:48:00.000Z	tom_		hey guys, i'm having a problem with my new laptop. I have specified that while on battery power, when i close the lid the computer should enter sleep mode. however, when i open the lid again, the screen does not turn back on. pressing keys, moving the mouse, pressing the power button, nothing works.

2007-06-26T08:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tom_	I've heard a lot of people saying that hibernate can be iffy.
2007-06-26T08:49:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	Its not hibernation, it's sleep. if it helps, i'm using intel 8.10 drivers running beryl
2007-06-26T08:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tom_	Sleep being suspend to ram?
2007-06-26T08:50:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	yes, and i have no lack of ram on this laptop.
2007-06-26T08:50:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	i know that hibernation won't work for me since i forgot that the swap has to be more than the ram.
2007-06-26T08:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tom_	It might be beryl related, you could always try switching back to meta-city temporary...But, personally speaking, I have found that both are generally iffy, and I have my machine set just to shut off the monitor.
2007-06-26T08:52:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	i'll take that into consideration. this is my first laptop, and overall i'm extremely pleased with ubuntu's performance on a laptop. the only thing i had to do was reconfigure panel-applets so i could specify the governor for the cpu scaling.
2007-06-26T08:53:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	that and the modem doesn't work, but i expected that.
2007-06-26T08:53:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tom_	I've never played with CPU scaling, how does that affect your setup?
2007-06-26T08:53:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	i'll try sleeping with metacity, and i'll let you know how it goes.
2007-06-26T08:54:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	instead of ondemand scaling, which goes up and down madly, i want to be able to set a definite limit on the speed of the cpu, so i can squeeze some extra battery life out. i have it locked on the minimum clock speed right now.
2007-06-26T08:54:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tom_	Got it.
2007-06-26T08:54:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	i'll brb.
2007-06-26T08:58:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	yeah no dice.
2007-06-26T08:58:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tom_	I have to run in a hot second, but like I said, I've heard it is iffy
2007-06-26T08:58:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	perhaps it's an issue with intel's drivers.
2007-06-26T08:58:00.000Z	tom_	PurpZeY	goodnight then, thanks.
