2010-07-13T11:14:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		that is correct Jordan_U. my computer has an outdated bios, so no USB boot, and a broken CD drive, so no CD boot. i downloaded the 10.04 iso, and i have it mounted as a loop device. now i want to install it using the program that it uses to install it, that is in the ISO
2010-07-13T11:15:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		jordan_u yes i do

2010-07-13T11:18:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jussi	that wont work for me. unetbootin seems to never work with ubuntu 10.04, like the kernels to boot are different
2010-07-13T11:19:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	that doesnt use unetbootin
2010-07-13T11:20:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	what I linked to does not use any cd's, and does not use unetbootin. did you read it?
2010-07-13T11:22:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	512 meg hd? and you want to install ubuntu?
2010-07-13T11:23:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	yeah, so use the method I mentioned, create a new partition, put the cd there and boot from that, as the guide says
2010-07-13T11:35:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jussi	i need some help with this guide, it doesnt say where i am suppose to create these directories.
2010-07-13T11:36:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	where are you running into trouble? which directories?
2010-07-13T11:39:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	so you are changing the diskimage.iso for the path to your cdimage?
2010-07-13T11:39:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	as the guide says, you first need to create those dir's, then mount the partition into them, then copy the cd over with the rsync command
2010-07-13T11:40:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jussi	thats not what i asked, i want to know whether i put it in my "new" partition, or my "old one"
2010-07-13T11:42:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	?
2010-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	in your old one. you then mount the new partition into those directories.
2010-07-13T11:50:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	read down a little more :D
2010-07-13T11:54:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	jussi	since i have this as the installer, would it be a good idea to make a new partition from the remaining space on my installer partition, leaving the installer to have only enough for the CD contents, so i dont get the error?
2010-07-13T11:54:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	Im not sure. I havent actally completed the process before.
2010-07-13T11:55:00.000Z	jussi	CkhiKuzad	I need to disappear now - actually have to do some work. please keep reading the instructions and hopefully someone else can help if you run into issues.
