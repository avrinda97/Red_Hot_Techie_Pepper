2009-06-06T06:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	ok so ndiswrapper job
2009-06-06T06:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	say said she had the drivers CD
2009-06-06T06:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	yes, but I don't remember how to get drivers  working with ndiswrapper
2009-06-06T06:54:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	the ones provided on the linksys page don't work?
2009-06-06T06:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	trust me it's people like  yvonne  that need to be won over to  Ubuntu and such, or those programs wil never gain mass market share,  slight off topic here I know
2009-06-06T06:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	she has a driver CD, the Windows drivers
2009-06-06T06:56:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	Well you need a good tutorial on the internet, or you have to guide her through the installation... ;)
2009-06-06T06:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	I would do it if I had the ndiswraper installation proccess in a document or something
2009-06-06T06:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	driver installation proccess
2009-06-06T07:00:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	Yeah... Always the same with ndiswrapper. You often need a script and cabextract to fetch the firmware file...
2010-04-29T22:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	 sambagirl   no Ext4 file system or Grub 2 boot loader, if upgrading to 10.04 from 8.04, however don't really need those anyway
2010-04-29T22:04:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	I had some speed gain specialy with ext4.
2010-04-29T22:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	indeed at that
2010-04-29T22:06:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	What will happen, if we don't need the ext4 'patches' anymore? We will fly away... ;)
2010-04-29T22:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	uh?
2010-04-29T22:08:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	ext4 has a 60seconds write on disk by default. The problem is, that if you have a system crash and your software is not programmed well, you might loose all your settings and so on. Gnome and KDE software is affected. So they set the wirte settings differently.
2010-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	there was some data loss issue when Ext4 was in development, but I think that issue  has been fixed for quite a long while now
2010-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	minimec	Ext4 also became stable in Ubuntu starting with 9.10,  where as in 9.04 not properly stable and optional :)
2010-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	minimec	sebsebseb	fixed yes, by slowing down the ext4 system ;)
