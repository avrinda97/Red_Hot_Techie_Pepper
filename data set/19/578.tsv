2012-07-31T01:27:00.000Z	theadmin		Anyway, thanks for the distro people. Even though Ubuntu's not my favorite, it's definetly the distro I suggest for newbies and install on comps of such.
2012-07-31T01:29:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	Mandriva has a PAID VERSION!?
2012-07-31T01:30:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	It does indeed. As well as a free one.
2012-07-31T01:30:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	I shun Mandriva. Dear god, how can any devs stomach working on that?
2012-08-06T09:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	Do you have your graphic drivers installed? Cinnamon is very 3D accelerated, so you'll need a decent video card and the official drivers for it.
2012-08-06T09:44:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	Well, I have two laptops. One is mine, which defaults to Unity but runs Cinnamon just fine, and the other is configured for my younger brother, who I just managed to get to use Linux. His runs Windows XP far better than Cinnamon, and that is scary.
2012-08-06T09:44:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	That extra info was really unnecessary. Sorry about that.
2012-08-06T09:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	Well, that doesn't tell me *anything*. Just open the "Additional Drivers" tool and see if your video card drivers can be found there.
2012-08-06T09:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	Okay look. Go to the laptop where it doesn't work. Open the menu. Find "Additional Drivers". Open the app. Search for videocard related stuff. Activate that.
2012-08-06T09:47:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	Yep. All the driversare active.
2012-08-06T09:48:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	Hm, okay... That's... sad. Because I can't think of anything else.
2012-08-06T09:50:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	Hm. Do any other Desktop Environments feel that similar to Windows?
2012-08-06T09:50:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	Uh. KDE?
2012-08-06T09:52:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	cfhowlett: I've used KDE before, and it feels very Mac-like to me. LXDE is fast and reminiscent of Windows XP, but very ugly. I will have to look into XFCE.
2012-08-06T09:54:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	Mint is not supported here.
2012-08-06T09:55:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	cfhowlett: Yes, I know, just thought one of you might be able to answer the one question...
2012-08-06T09:55:00.000Z	theadmin	Relondo	The answer is "yes".
2012-08-06T09:55:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	Thanks.
2012-08-06T09:55:00.000Z	Relondo	theadmin	cfhowlett: Well, thanks to both of you for your help. Later.
