2009-04-26T03:05:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	fix your attitude if you want help.
2009-04-26T03:06:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	go calm down first.
2009-04-26T03:08:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	9.04 is a totally new distribution. it will take time to get used to it. some things change, some things don't.
2009-04-26T03:12:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	we don't complain about porno not working, you do. please, go chill out for awhile and, uhm, find some pictures. then come back later.
2009-04-26T03:12:00.000Z	miik	Gnea	pictures is so 1990, i want movies
2009-04-26T03:12:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	well, you're still going to have to fix your attitude to get the help that you need from here, regardless.
2009-04-26T03:13:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	have you tried a different media player?
2009-04-26T04:13:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	have you tried any other players besides totem? like mplayer, xine or vlc?
2009-04-26T04:14:00.000Z	miik	Gnea	no, i like totem
2009-04-26T04:14:00.000Z	miik	Gnea	also flash dont always work in firefox
2009-04-26T04:14:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	well, sometimes totem isn't the best application for the job, that's why there are alternatives in order to solve the problem.
2009-04-26T04:15:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	someone else was having a problem with flash not working either....
2009-04-26T04:16:00.000Z	miik	Gnea	sometimes it works, sometimes not
2009-04-26T04:17:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	have you checked the ubuntu bug reporter to see if anyone else has posted a fix?
2009-04-26T04:20:00.000Z	miik	Gnea	nope
2009-04-26T04:23:00.000Z	Gnea	miik	well, the best place to search would be at http://bugs.launchpad.net and you could also try http://ubuntuforums.org as well, as both of those sites compliment this official IRC channel.
