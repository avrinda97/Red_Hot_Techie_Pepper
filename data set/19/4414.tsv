2009-01-19T15:06:00.000Z	aeosynth		i deleted my ~/.dmrc file, then created a new one with nothing in it, now I can't log in
2009-01-19T15:08:00.000Z	aeosynth		what should be in my .dmrc file?
2009-01-19T15:10:00.000Z	aeosynth		can someone just copy and paste their ~/.dmrc file? I deleted mine....
2009-01-19T15:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 no need.. it gets remade if its gone
2009-01-19T15:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 next time you log in via gdm it will get remade
2009-01-19T15:11:00.000Z	aeosynth		when I log in, I just get a blank screen
2009-01-19T15:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 plus its just 2 lines - that shoudlnt be causeing that.
2009-01-19T15:11:00.000Z	aeosynth		dr_willis_znc: could you just tell me those two lines?
2009-01-19T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 2 lines -->  [Desktop]  Session=gnome
2009-01-19T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 it just saves the session you selected int eh GDM menus
2009-01-19T15:12:00.000Z	aeosynth		1st line: [Desktop], 2nd line: Session=gnome?
2009-01-19T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 yes
2009-01-19T15:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 i imagine its COMPIZ causing your problems
2009-01-19T15:13:00.000Z	aeosynth		lemme try that, i'll be back here if it doesn't work
2009-01-19T15:13:00.000Z	aeosynth		i disabled visual effects, so i don't think i'm using compiz that much
2009-01-19T15:13:00.000Z	aeosynth		i followed the instructions at http://www.ubuntuproductivity.com/journal/ubuntu/08/2008/fix-ubuntu-dmrc-permissions-error-on-login/ because i was having a .dmrc permission error
2009-01-19T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	aeosynth	 for some reaon i had s similer issue.. i disabled then reenabled compuiz and it workled then
2009-01-19T15:14:00.000Z	aeosynth		but because i deleted my .dmrc file to try to solve it, i think i messed something up
2009-01-19T15:14:00.000Z	aeosynth	Dr_Willis_ZNC	ok, so how would i disable compiz from the terminal?
