2006-10-23T08:46:00.000Z	dwango		but got passed that somehow
2006-10-23T08:47:00.000Z	dwango		does anyone use a Xinerama on a laptop with an Intel graphics card (i810 driver)
2006-10-23T08:48:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	I do, but I don't have that machine handy. what's the prob?
2006-10-23T08:48:00.000Z	dwango	rbil	I'm trying to get the external monitor to be the 1st screen, and the Laptop LCD to be the 2nd
2006-10-23T08:48:00.000Z	dwango		and it's not going so well
2006-10-23T08:49:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	I do just the opposite,  can u use rightof instead of leftof  for example?
2006-10-23T08:50:00.000Z	dwango	rbil	yeah I can.. but when I'm docked I like to use the large display as my primary (e.g. with my panels, application menus), and obviously when i'm undocked the internal display should be primary
2006-10-23T08:50:00.000Z	dwango		otherwise when I undock the panel positions will be on the wrong display
2006-10-23T08:51:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	understand. not sure how one handles that. short of having 2 xorg.conf and do renaming to change things after booting in
2006-10-23T08:52:00.000Z	dwango	rbil	well the conf management is something else altogether.  I'm just trying to get it to work in that layout first =)
2006-10-23T08:52:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	would be nice to check for whether connected and then use appropriate xorg.conf ... maybe there's a script somewhere that will do that?
2006-10-23T08:52:00.000Z	dwango		yeah i dunno
2006-10-23T08:53:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	then it's more than just leftof or rightof, but what screen comes first
2006-10-23T08:53:00.000Z	dwango		if only Xorg supported dynamic serverlayout selection :-/
2006-10-23T08:53:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	agreed
2006-10-23T08:54:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	I've seen example xorg.conf's with more than one severlayout, but what software would select which to use, I have never found
2006-10-23T08:54:00.000Z	dwango	rbil	you can pass a parameter to X when starting it manually
2006-10-23T08:54:00.000Z	dwango		but using kdm/gdm, I don't know
2006-10-23T08:55:00.000Z	rbil	dwango	yes that might do it... pass xinerama only if connected, don't load it in xorg.conf? maybe?
