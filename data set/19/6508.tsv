2009-07-24T02:17:00.000Z	Dekko		Tried reinstalling it and then 'sudo usplash' to test it, but all I get is a black screen.
2009-07-24T02:18:00.000Z	Dekko		I have disabled framebuffer etc.
2009-07-24T02:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	you can reinstall usplash too
2009-07-24T02:18:00.000Z	Dekko	ActionParsnip	tried reinstalling it but still only get a black screen (and no usplash shown on boot - just textmode)
2009-07-24T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	try modifying the splash screen to something, also check /boot/grub/menu.lst and make sure it says quiet on the kernel line
2009-07-24T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	the boot logo is a boot option and is not compiled into the kernel.
2009-07-24T17:24:00.000Z	Dekko	ActionParsnip	Why then IS there a bootlogo option you can choose when choosing what to enable in the kernel?
2009-07-24T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	add    quiet     to the boot option
2009-07-24T17:26:00.000Z	Dekko	ActionParsnip	Boot logo - I didn't mean the Usplash but the Tux penguin that shows up during TEXT BOOT with framebuffer enabled in some kernels. But obviously not in the ubuntu generic compile.
2009-07-24T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	oh, i know what you mean. not sure
2009-07-24T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	see ya
2010-05-02T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	did you md5 test the iso before you burned it? Did you burn as slowly as you could
2010-05-02T00:32:00.000Z	Dekko	ActionParsnip	Did not do that no, but the same CD worked just fine booting on my computer.
2010-05-02T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	ok then a ram check is useful. Or some boot options
2010-05-02T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	more power doesn't mean more compatible
2010-05-02T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	did you burn the 64bit iso?
2010-05-02T00:35:00.000Z	Dekko	ActionParsnip	nope 32 bit.
2010-05-02T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	it may need 64bit although technically 32bit should work. You need 64bit or 32bit+pae to address 8gb ram
2010-05-02T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dekko	i'd grab the 64bit iso and burn it after md5 checking it
