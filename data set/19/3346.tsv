2009-09-06T04:24:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	you mean absolutely no gui loaded?
2009-09-06T04:24:00.000Z	pbink	cameron	yep
2009-09-06T04:24:00.000Z	pbink		just terminal
2009-09-06T04:25:00.000Z	pbink		etc/initdefault?
2009-09-06T04:25:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	well you may be better off installing something that by default has no gui, which will obviously boot to terminal
2009-09-06T04:25:00.000Z	pbink	cameron	hmm, well i'd like the ability to load the gui, but don't use it that much on this virtual machine
2009-09-06T04:26:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	I'm not exactly sure what you use it for, but my friend has just installed gentoo, and installed xcfe, but he automatically boots to command line
2009-09-06T04:27:00.000Z	pbink	cameron	roger, thanx
2009-09-06T04:27:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	you could just change the tty, but trying to use the key combination under ubuntu will change the host computers tty
2009-09-06T04:27:00.000Z	pbink	cameron	like mintty?
2009-09-06T04:29:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	tty's aren't emulators, they are *like* exclusive sessions
2009-09-06T04:29:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	Are you using ubuntu now?
2009-09-06T04:29:00.000Z	pbink		yeah on a virtualbox
2009-09-06T04:30:00.000Z	pbink		desktop edition
2009-09-06T04:30:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	if you press ctrl+alt+f[n] it will take you to a different tty, and ctrl+alt+f7 will take you back to the gui
2009-09-06T04:31:00.000Z	pbink		ahh smart, i forgot about those function switches
2009-09-06T04:31:00.000Z	pbink	cameron	thanx
2009-09-06T04:31:00.000Z	pbink	cameron	i ended up just unchecking gdm from the system > admin > services, but that works too
2009-09-06T04:32:00.000Z	cameron	pbink	that should also work haha
