2010-01-06T10:29:00.000Z	david__		was just wandering what is going on about downloading limewire
2010-01-06T10:29:00.000Z	david__		cool thanks
2010-01-06T10:31:00.000Z	david__		ok one more question how about flash
2010-01-06T10:32:00.000Z	david__		were do you download flashplayer at for firefox
2010-01-06T10:32:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	Install 'flashplugin-installer' package.
2010-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	No, use Firefox, Opera or Google Chrome
2010-01-06T10:39:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	Flash for IE is not gonna work on Ubuntu anyway
2010-01-06T10:40:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	If you're running Karmic or Jaunty, then type "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer" into the terminal, if you're running an earlier release, type "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2010-01-06T10:41:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	And restart the browser after it installs.
2010-01-06T10:45:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	Expirement around. You might like Linux Mint since it comes with restricted drivers.... If you preffer RedHat-like distros, try Fedora... But I'd say sticking to Debian ones is a better idea.
2010-01-06T10:46:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	lubuntu? What the heck is that?
2010-01-06T10:47:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	It's ubuntu with educational tools.
2010-01-06T10:51:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	Oh, nice-looking :D Well, try enabling GNOME desktop effects :D and Linux Mint looks quite nice.
2010-01-06T10:53:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	As stated, did you try enabling desktop effects and/or downloading themes? GNOME can look AWESOME.
2010-01-06T10:54:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	(GNOME is the Ubuntu's desktop)
2010-01-06T10:54:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Desktop Effects, if I recall properly.
2010-01-06T11:07:00.000Z	theadmin	david__	Xubuntu is intended to be quick, meaning not eye-candy
