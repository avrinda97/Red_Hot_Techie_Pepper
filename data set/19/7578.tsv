2007-10-31T04:30:00.000Z	aguitel	Ademan	,i like to open the terminal in any directory
2007-10-31T04:30:00.000Z	Ademan	aguitel	oh, there's a package for that, i have that installed one sec
2007-10-31T04:30:00.000Z	aguitel	Ademan	thanks

2007-10-31T04:31:00.000Z	aguitel	Ademan	sudo apt-get ..... ?
2007-10-31T04:31:00.000Z	Ademan	aguitel	there are several packages that extend nautilus' functionality that way, they all start with nautilus-  so, you know, might take a look around there
2007-10-31T04:31:00.000Z	Ademan	aguitel	yes, sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
2007-10-31T04:31:00.000Z	aguitel	Ademan	thanksssss
2007-10-31T04:31:00.000Z	Ademan		no problem
2007-10-31T04:36:00.000Z	aguitel	Ademan	one question ,how i start it?
2007-10-31T04:40:00.000Z	Ademan	aguitel	you should be able to right click in a folder and there will be an option saying open directory in terminal
2007-10-31T04:40:00.000Z	Ademan	aguitel	also sorry, i was just on my way out, sorry it took so long, and i'm gone now
2007-10-31T04:40:00.000Z	Ademan	aguitel	oh yeah, you might need to restart nautilus first, but don't quote me on that
2007-10-31T04:40:00.000Z	Ademan		if you do, logging out then logging back in should be enough
2007-10-31T04:41:00.000Z	aguitel	Ademan	thanks
