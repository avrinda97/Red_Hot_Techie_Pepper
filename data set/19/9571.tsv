2007-06-16T09:02:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		How do I check a filesystem? fsck told me at startup I failed the test
2007-06-16T09:03:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		ok, but how can I get a more detailed filesystem check?
2007-06-16T09:04:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		I'd like to stay with Ubuntu, thanks for the advice
2007-06-16T09:04:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		but I would like to know how to get a detailed report on my filesystem with fsck
2007-06-16T09:05:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		because it may be related to my vfat drive
2007-06-16T09:06:00.000Z	dopry	GhostFreeman_	you can try the -V flag to fsck.
2007-06-16T09:06:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		thanks, dopry
2007-06-16T09:06:00.000Z	dopry	GhostFreeman_	from a terminal `info fsck` and you'll be able to find a lot of stuff you can use form the command line.
2007-06-16T09:07:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		thank you, this will help a lot
2007-06-16T09:08:00.000Z	dopry	GhostFreeman_	Good luck... I've been working with linux for a long time, and never found a need for detail info on the filesystem, unless it was a post mortem... What do you want the info for?
2007-06-16T09:09:00.000Z	dopry	GhostFreeman_	or better yet, just what information do you want, fsck might not be the tool for the job.
2007-06-16T09:09:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		to find out if this is my vfat drive that's going south
2007-06-16T09:10:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		wait, no, it hung up on sda2 which is my ext3 part
2007-06-16T09:11:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		yeah I'd like to see where it failed since my HDDs have been running for some time
2007-06-16T09:11:00.000Z	dopry	GhostFreeman_	So you want to know about the underlying drive or the filesystem itself?
2007-06-16T09:11:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_		the filesystem since it reported the fail on startup
2007-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	dopry	GhostFreeman_	then fsck is probably the tool... If you're concerned more about the disks themselves you can check out the smartmontools or smart-notifier packages.
2007-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	dopry		adios :)
2007-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	GhostFreeman_	dopry	thanks. I'll check those utils out.
