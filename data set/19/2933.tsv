2012-05-11T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	_val_	 you can select then middle click to paste.. in most apps.
2012-05-11T16:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	_val_	 you may want to try out some of the clipbord manager tools also.

2012-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	_val_	Dr_willis	I use fedora and gnome-shell myself.. but here at work I'm using ubuntu.. and I cannot paste using the scrollbar of the mouse.
2012-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	_val_		There is some kind of setting I don't know .
2012-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	_val_	 i dont know what you mean by scrollbar of the mouse.
2012-05-11T16:22:00.000Z	_val_	Dr_willis	you can select a certain pattern or text on the terminal by double-clicking. When you want to paste this text, you can do it using the middel-wheel of your mous. Just press the wheel of the mouse and it will paste. On ubuntu it doesn't
2012-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	_val_	 it works here just fine... at least in xchat - i just tested it....
2012-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	_val_		how to change on gnome?

2012-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Should work the same in any  desktop. the select/middle click  is a feature of X i belive. not the desktop
