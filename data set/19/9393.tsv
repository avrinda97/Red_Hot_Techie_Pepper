2006-11-13T11:30:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		Okay I'm having a problem with Audacity and Flash.  When one is using the sound card the other can't.  e.g. if I bring Audacity up, then Flash can't play sound.  If I bring Flash up, then Audacity can't open the driver.
2006-11-13T11:30:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		I am using Flash 7.
2006-11-13T11:30:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		inside Firefox 1.5 and Audacity 1.4.2.
2006-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	yes, this is correct. Caused by them both using the old style sound drier (which exclusively locks the sound device)
2006-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	The fix is to not use both at the same time.
2006-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	but I need to use both.  Is there an update for either?  would the Flash 9 beta work?
2006-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	I doubt it, but you can try...
2006-11-13T11:33:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	is there another recorder in Ubuntu that can record from the mixer like Audacity can?
2006-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	Oh, you're trying to record from flash?
2006-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	Yes.
2006-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	sound recorder perhaps... dunno...
2006-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	um, Sound Recorder?  I see nothing to the likes of that in the Multimedia menu.
2006-11-13T11:35:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	I have a `gnome-sound-recorder'
2006-11-13T11:35:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	Ahhh okay.  I will go apt-get it :)
2006-11-13T11:36:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	E: Couldn't find package gnome-sound-recorder
2006-11-13T11:37:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	in `gnome-media' on Edgy.
2006-11-13T11:39:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	Kubuntu 6.06 LTS.
2006-11-13T11:39:00.000Z	cafuego	AWOSLappy	sound-recorder - Direct-to-disk recording and play-back programs.
2006-11-13T11:40:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	cafuego	okay I'm getting it.
