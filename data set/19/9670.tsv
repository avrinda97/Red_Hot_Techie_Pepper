2007-12-21T17:55:00.000Z	Belisarivs		Hi all.
2007-12-21T17:55:00.000Z	Belisarivs		I have problem with Ubuntu. Could someone help me?
2007-12-21T17:56:00.000Z	Belisarivs		OK
2007-12-21T17:57:00.000Z	Belisarivs		After logging in, GNOME takes ages to start when not connected to the internet.
2007-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	Belisarivs		Also gnome apps and mc rake too much time to start.
2007-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	Belisarivs		I have Core Duo notebook with 2GB RAM.
2007-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	Belisarivs		What if I did strace of mc and upload it somewhere?
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	Belisarivs		Any idea?
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	its a reverse resolution problem, upload your /etc/hosts file to pastebin
2007-12-21T18:00:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	what does running "hostname" on the terminal give you?
2007-12-21T18:02:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	ok, now what does "grep `hostname` /etc/hosts" give you
2007-12-21T18:13:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	glad to help
2007-12-21T18:13:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	shoot
2007-12-21T18:17:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	you press ctrl+alt+F1 and get a blank screen?
2007-12-21T18:18:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	can you get back to the graphical screen afterwards?
2007-12-21T18:20:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	getty is supposed to be run by init, there sould be 6 such lines in /etc/inittab
2007-12-21T18:22:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	I suppose you should put those in /etc/modules then
2007-12-21T18:23:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	just the module names, without the "sudo modprobe" commands...
2007-12-21T18:25:00.000Z	ifireball	Belisarivs	just making sure. wouldn't want you hosing your system because of me ;)
