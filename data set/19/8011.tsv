2007-07-28T13:33:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu		Ok Ive got one of my HDs mounted but it's permissions are listed as root. I did sudo chown -hR brandon:brandon /media/disk, but it didnt change the permissions. What do I need to do?
2007-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	what filesystem does that disk have?
2007-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	it's ReiserFS
2007-07-28T13:35:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	and you dont get any errors? is the drive mounted read+write and not readonly? check mount|grep /media/disk for "ro" or "rw"
2007-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	sounds like black magic is involved
2007-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	lol
2007-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	I just did the same on /dev/hdf1 also, which is the dev of the HD
2007-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	changing perms on the /dev worked
2007-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	have you tried that chown under sudo su - ? dont think it makes a difference, but... atleast it should show you errors if it didn't work
2007-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	I did sudo -s and switched to root, then did the chown
2007-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	I'll umount and remount to test
2007-07-28T13:40:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	you dont have a user set in the mount options, do you? ;)
2007-07-28T13:40:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	no
2007-07-28T13:41:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	I just remounted using sudo mount and the perms are assigned to me, not root
2007-07-28T13:42:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	so I guess whatever I did worked
2007-07-28T13:42:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	well, I guess something did it ;)
2007-07-28T13:43:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	what would I use as command?
2007-07-28T13:46:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	lietu	I have an ornery dir that wont delete from the Trash
2007-07-28T13:48:00.000Z	lietu	PF|Ubuntu	hehe, fine enough ;)
