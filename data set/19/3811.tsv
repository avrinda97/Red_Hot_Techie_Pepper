2009-06-02T11:20:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Why is PROXY the name of a machine?
2009-06-02T11:21:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Are you using a proxy right now?
2009-06-02T11:22:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	tiyowan	no Im at home right now, but when I go back to school tomm I will have to
2009-06-02T11:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Pastebin: cat /etc/apt/apt.conf
2009-06-02T11:24:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	tiyowan	That file is empty, I have nothing to paste
2009-06-02T11:25:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Hmm...one sec. Did you set "No Proxy" vis that System -> * -> Networks?
2009-06-02T11:25:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	tiyowan	yes and I clicked the apply-systemwide button too
2009-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Did you log out and back in after doing that?
2009-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	tiyowan	No I have not
2009-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Do that and then try apt-get update.
2009-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	tiyowan	sorry I should have thought of that :(. Ill brb.
2009-06-02T11:33:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	No worries.
2009-06-02T11:34:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Well...you could kill the graphical desktop.
2009-06-02T11:35:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Ctrl-Alt-F3 to get to a virtual console, then sudo killall gdm I think.
2009-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	It's not the same thing as "restarting linux", but it's functionally equivalent to killing the explorer.exe process on Windows.
2009-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Ctrl-Alt-Backspace (RHorse) is great, too. :)
2009-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	Same thing. Kills X.
2009-06-02T11:37:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	startx. :)
2009-06-02T11:37:00.000Z	tiyowan	PsyCl0ne	If you use Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, it'll auto-restart.
