2008-05-02T00:06:00.000Z	Pici	fde	mib_56b8am: Wubi is offered on the Hardy install CD
2008-05-29T20:39:00.000Z	fde	Pici	aptitude why <package> is more readable :P
2008-05-29T20:40:00.000Z	Pici	fde	But that doesnt tell me anything I need to know if the package is already manually installed
2008-05-29T20:42:00.000Z	fde	Pici	I think I picked a bad example to look at... apt-cache rdepends libmad0 dumps out a bunch of stuff... much cleaner to just know why it's installed...
2008-05-29T20:42:00.000Z	fde	Pici	I see what you mean though I suppose... but if you installed it yourself, I doubt you really want to know why it's installed  :P
2008-05-29T20:43:00.000Z	Pici	fde	I often do actually, like if something is bugged, or if I'm helping someone else out... neat command anyway, wasn't in zsh's autocomplete for aptitude  stuffs
2008-05-29T20:44:00.000Z	fde	Pici	I'm trying to do everything via aptitude... been an apt-get user for 10 years... it's really nice once you get used to the search strings... heh
2008-05-29T20:46:00.000Z	fde	Pici	also, there is why-not that can answer why something is being help back or what is breaking the installation... etc...
2008-05-30T20:02:00.000Z	Pici	fde	#ubuntu-doc
2008-05-30T20:02:00.000Z	fde	Pici	I tried there... it made me op... so that can't be right
2008-05-30T20:03:00.000Z	Pici	fde	I'm there now, and you arent
2008-11-18T20:33:00.000Z	Pici	fde	freenode no longer blocks unidentified users from sending private messages.
2008-11-18T20:35:00.000Z	fde	Pici	Why not? I don't want random bots bothering me about porn  :/
2008-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	fde	Pici	you really think ##windows will assist him?  :/
2008-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	fde	Yes.
2008-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	fde	Its offtopic here anyway.
2008-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	fde	Pici	they will laugh at him
2008-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	fde	Why?
2008-11-20T21:18:00.000Z	fde	Pici	he is trying to figure out why Ubuntu won't let him access its partition from Windows... how is it offtopic?
