2010-02-06T11:02:00.000Z	nyaa_		does brasero have a problem with burning iso's to regular cd's? it was fine doing a dvd image but the regular cd just hangs
2010-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	depends how big the iso is really??
2010-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	it's 600 megs or so, it just hangs at "preparing to write"
2010-02-06T11:04:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	you said brasero rite?
2010-02-06T11:04:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	yup
2010-02-06T11:05:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	I don't know how else to do an image to install ubuntu on the other pc
2010-02-06T11:05:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	it shouldnt have a problem burning iso's to a disc
2010-02-06T11:05:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	make sure the burn speed is set low?
2010-02-06T11:05:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	hopefully its a clean disc
2010-02-06T11:08:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	how long has it been doing this like, everytime, possibly is the iso?? have check the hash
2010-02-06T11:09:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	every time I try, even if the iso is somehow downloaded wrong, it should still try to burn it to the disk right?
2010-02-06T11:09:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	yeah it should burn anything that is formated as .iso
2010-02-06T11:10:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	then it's some issue with my burner or brasero or something, heh.
2010-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	yeah it could have problems with your burner,, kinda weird tho
2010-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	unixalot		does it recognize a disc when you put it in nyaa_
2010-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	unixalot		who buys a macbook?
2010-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	yeah it recognizes that it's a blank disc
2010-02-06T11:12:00.000Z	unixalot	nyaa_	I would recomend synaptic and installing k3b, its for kde but see if it burns at least
2010-02-06T11:12:00.000Z	nyaa_	unixalot	ok, thanks =)
