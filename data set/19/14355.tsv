2006-12-10T15:17:00.000Z	echosystm		do i need xdm?
2006-12-10T15:18:00.000Z	echosystm		how do i get into the window manager?
2006-12-10T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	what did you install?
2006-12-10T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	on top of an already-installed Ubuntu?
2006-12-10T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	you don't need xdm, no.
2006-12-10T15:21:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	it's recommended that you use the "Ubuntu method" of enabling the Nvidia drivers from the repositories.
2006-12-10T15:23:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	as gnomefreak mentioned, it should be installed already if linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) is installed
2006-12-10T15:24:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	dpkg -l linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)|grep ^ii
2006-12-10T15:24:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	use it verbatim.
2006-12-10T15:25:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	just type it.
2006-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	or you could have just typed $(uname -r) instead of expanding it manually
2006-12-10T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	startx does not depend on xdm
2006-12-10T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	correct. I said so a while ago. :)
2006-12-10T15:51:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	no, invoking ``startx'' does not exec blackbox automatically. You need to configure ~/.xinitrc to exec blackbox.
2006-12-11T15:35:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	just use netjack.
2006-12-11T15:36:00.000Z	crimsun	echosystm	I don't have time, sorry. Use a search engine.
