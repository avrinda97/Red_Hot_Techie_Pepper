2011-12-13T04:57:00.000Z	genjix		ok guys, i was defending Unity before because i assumed that Canonical knows what it's doing more than us hackers. but after trying it with my friend who is a new linux user since yesterday and my mum: i hate it, the entire geek community hates it, my mum hates it, my friend hates it.
2011-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	genjix		unity is a failed experiment.
2011-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	genjix		linux mint has overtaken ubuntu on distrowatch
2011-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	genjix		unity == shit
2011-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	m4v	genjix	try gnome shell.
2011-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	genjix		i was supportive before.
2011-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	genjix		but after testing with people, i cannot ignore the results
2011-12-13T04:59:00.000Z	m4v	genjix	and get a grip, this channel isn't for complain about it.
2011-12-13T04:59:00.000Z	genjix		free advice
2011-12-13T04:59:00.000Z	genjix		a complaint would be blaa blaa i didn't get my money's worth
2011-12-13T04:59:00.000Z	genjix		i am switching to linux mint or arch in the future.
2011-12-13T05:00:00.000Z	genjix		instead of plugging your ears to the community and going lalalalala, drop unity. it is a failed project.
2011-12-13T05:02:00.000Z	genjix		derp, distro is broken, fix it yourself
2011-12-13T05:02:00.000Z	m4v	genjix	move it to offtopic, your rant isn't topic here.
2011-12-13T05:02:00.000Z	genjix		^ goood advice :)
2011-12-13T05:02:00.000Z	genjix	m4v	#ubuntu ... off topic? lol
2011-12-13T05:02:00.000Z	genjix		looking for discussion here
2011-12-13T05:03:00.000Z	genjix		it's a channel about #ubuntu
2011-12-13T05:03:00.000Z	m4v	genjix	exactly, go to offtopic for that.
