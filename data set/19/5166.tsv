2008-08-29T00:26:00.000Z	xbxb		Is Eclipse a good IDE for C/C++ programming? or does someone know a better solution?
2008-08-29T00:28:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	i hear anjuta is pretty good for C/C++ development
2008-08-29T00:29:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	thanks
2008-09-10T00:25:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	i believe they are cleared on boot
2008-09-10T00:26:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	I'm asking because I'm now using a separate partition for /tmp (fstab already changed, will take effect on reboot), but I want to delete all files in the "old" /tmp directory before that.
2008-09-10T00:27:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	you'll need to delete them .. preferably after reboot - or in single-user mode (runlevel 1)
2008-09-10T00:27:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	how do I get into runlevel 1 after reboot?
2008-09-10T00:28:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	choose recovery mode from the grub screen  ... or you can type this now.  sudo telinit 1  (after closing your programs down)
2008-09-10T00:28:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	many thanks
2008-09-10T00:28:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	to return to runlevel 2 after that.  sudo telinit 2
2008-09-10T00:28:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	OK
2008-09-10T00:29:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	though, you'll need to mount /tmp first.  sudo mount  -a
2008-09-10T00:29:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	but then I can't access the current /tmp directory anymore, whose content I want to delete?!
2008-09-10T00:31:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	you should carry out the procedure like this .. step into runlevel 1, clear /tmp, mount /tmp and then return to runlevel 2
2008-09-10T00:33:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	Oh, got you now. One last question: do I have to set the permissions of the /tmp folder *before* mounting the new /tmp?
2008-09-10T00:34:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	errm, no, you need to change permissions on the partition you want to mount at /tmp .. mount it somewhere temporarily and then .  sudo chmod +t /that/mount_point
2008-09-10T00:35:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	thanks a lot for your patience. I'll try that.
2008-09-10T00:35:00.000Z	unop	xbxb	the next time you mount that device somewhere, the mount point (which in your case is /tmp) - will automatically assume the permissions of the partition.
2008-09-10T00:36:00.000Z	xbxb	unop	OK
