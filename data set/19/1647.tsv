2010-11-15T21:18:00.000Z	YouArePwned		hey guys
2010-11-15T21:18:00.000Z	YouArePwned		just a small question
2010-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	YouArePwned		in windows i could do that: echo %time%
2010-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	YouArePwned		so i get current time
2010-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	YouArePwned		in linux?
2010-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	YouArePwned		i mean, in bash
2010-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	date
2010-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	date -u for UTC
2010-11-15T21:20:00.000Z	YouArePwned	DasEi	thanks but i need to transfer the date to another program
2010-11-15T21:21:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	which program ? either use a function in that prog or pipe date to it
2010-11-15T21:21:00.000Z	YouArePwned	DasEi	yeah, it's a perl script. so how to pipe?
2010-11-15T21:22:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	simple use the functions in that script then : time, localtime, gmtime
2010-11-15T21:23:00.000Z	YouArePwned	DasEi	I will try now
2010-11-15T21:27:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	the script needs a variable, to pipe the output of date could go date | pastebinit, f.e.
2010-11-15T21:27:00.000Z	YouArePwned	DasEi	but how to do that outside of the script
2010-11-15T21:34:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	date > myVariable
2011-03-22T18:58:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	use rsync -R
2011-03-22T18:59:00.000Z	DasEi	YouArePwned	or mv -r , as cp doesn't support subdirs
2011-03-22T19:00:00.000Z	YouArePwned	DasEi	basically, i need to copy a folder, into a mounted folder
