2012-09-09T08:19:00.000Z	Elesa		Another question, the installer says that it can keep installed programs on the new Precise system if I upgrade directly from Natty to Precise.. Does that really work? Is there any way to do it manually with advanced partitioning?
2012-09-09T08:21:00.000Z	Elesa		I knew you'd tell me that, and I think the same too. Any way to make a list of installed programs?
2012-09-09T08:21:00.000Z	Elesa		I hope I can just sudo apt-get install it >.>
2012-09-09T08:22:00.000Z	Elesa		Thanks lotuspsychje!
2012-09-09T08:24:00.000Z	Elesa		So.. aptoncd or clone? D:
2012-09-09T08:26:00.000Z	Elesa		Maybe I'll use aptoncd because I want to start fresh and maybe there will be some packages that I don't want anymore, thanks for you great help anyways. =D
2012-09-09T08:28:00.000Z	Elesa		Umm.. APTonCD is certainly NOT displaying all my packages.
2012-09-09T08:28:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	It just lists packages available in the apt cache
2012-09-09T08:37:00.000Z	Elesa	napster	any way to make it list every package? ._.
2012-09-09T08:38:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	What you exactly wanted to do is to make a list of names of all installed packages.
2012-09-09T08:38:00.000Z	Elesa	napster	I guess I will open Gedit and do it. xD
2012-09-09T08:39:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	no
2012-09-09T08:39:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	I think this will do it for you : dpkg --get-selections > installed-software
2012-09-09T08:41:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	jeep Actually the first command outputs something that can be used to reinstall those packages back, That is exactly what Elesa want to do
2012-09-09T08:42:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	dpkg --set-selections < installed-software Use this command when you are done with your fresh install get all those packages back installed.
2012-09-09T08:45:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	no, debs are available
2012-09-09T08:46:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	if you don't find precise packages, you will need to build it your own.
2012-09-09T10:34:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	If you have data in that partition it could take time
2012-09-09T10:35:00.000Z	napster	Elesa	So it will take time usually
