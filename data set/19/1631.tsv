2010-11-21T19:42:00.000Z	alexmaco		hello everyone
2010-11-21T19:43:00.000Z	alexmaco		has anyone got 5 minutes for a really weird network problem?
2010-11-21T19:43:00.000Z	alexmaco		_everything_ network related works, apart from firefox
2010-11-21T19:43:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	confirm you don't have a proxy set in firefox
2010-11-21T19:44:00.000Z	alexmaco		and it's not just my half broken system, it's also on a friend's fresh install
2010-11-21T19:44:00.000Z	alexmaco		i'll look
2010-11-21T19:44:00.000Z	airtonix		!ot
2010-11-21T19:44:00.000Z	airtonix		clear
2010-11-21T19:45:00.000Z	alexmaco	airtonix	nope, not that
2010-11-21T19:45:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	terminal : dig google.com
2010-11-21T19:46:00.000Z	alexmaco	airtonix	as i said, _everything_ works - dig, wget, other browsers, apt, you name it
2010-11-21T19:46:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	tried moving the mozilla user settigns folder ?
2010-11-21T19:47:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	i mean you could remove it but just in case you want to keep settings.
2010-11-21T19:47:00.000Z	alexmaco	airtonix	no, i didn't - i'll look, but that shouldn't be it (it also as i said happens on another fresh install)
2010-11-21T19:49:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	i assume you are using 10.10, (and i can't be sure of any maverick specific wierdness) next thing i would try if using a brand new mozilla profile is to download the firefox from the mozilla website and run the tar.gz version
2010-11-21T19:49:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	unfortunately, i 'm not using maverick.
2010-11-21T19:49:00.000Z	alexmaco	airtonix	i'm on 10.04
2010-11-21T19:49:00.000Z	airtonix	alexmaco	and it's just default firefox that comes installed ?
2010-11-21T19:50:00.000Z	alexmaco	airtonix	oh crap - pretty imbarrasing but after the last crash it was stuck in offline mode for some reason; thanks though :)
