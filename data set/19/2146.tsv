2010-06-18T12:11:00.000Z	ManDay		then ill use wireshark, thanks!
2010-06-18T12:11:00.000Z	ManDay		sure undecim
2010-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	ManDay		Its not apache - its the SAGE server backend
2010-06-18T12:13:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	Have you tried wireshark for sniffing?
2010-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	I just used to to solve a failing Soap system.....
2010-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	Silly MS shop tried to setup a SOAP server....
2010-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	I use it on terminals...  tshark has earned me $$$$
2010-06-18T12:19:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	Gotta be root.....
2010-06-18T12:20:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	It can be run as a common user and do a very good job....
2010-06-18T12:20:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	Yep...  That's very common....
2010-06-18T12:20:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	And real....
2010-06-18T12:21:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	In other words....  Troubleshoot....  then turn it off....
2010-06-18T12:24:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	There are a couple of methods....  The first one is to just dump everything...  And look for port 8000...  then follow the TCP stream  (Right click)
2010-06-18T12:25:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	The other way is to just set the filter at the top......  The filtering system is very point/click....  Look for port and insert 8000
2010-06-18T12:26:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	That took a few minutes...  I chalk it up to complex packet scanners....
2010-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	Just right click on one of the packets and select "Follow TCP Stream".....
2010-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	It's like magic....
2010-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	And that's complex....  :)
2010-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	HermanDE_	ManDay	Takes me about 10 minutes to demonstrate surfing without SSL to clients with Wireshark....
