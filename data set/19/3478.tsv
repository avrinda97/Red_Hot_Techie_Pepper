2009-08-01T12:30:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	if not even the bios shows.. it's almost definitely hardware
2009-08-01T12:31:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	Yeah I figured the video card could be turned off or burnt I wish the first one
2009-08-01T12:32:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	on the bright side.. what if it's just your monitor broken? or just a loose connection for opening your lid up too much (laptop right?) .. in that case you should try plugging in svideo or whatever to your TV to see if it works
2009-08-01T12:32:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	Also I thought of the auto BIOS reset. If the laptop is left without energy for more than 72 hours it does a reset
2009-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	3 days is a long time =[
2009-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	I tried connecting it to a external monitor and it doesn't show any images neither the BIOS
2009-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	it's been around 2 and a half so I am good
2009-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	then the bios reset is probably your best bet .. xD a little more waiting to go
2009-08-01T12:35:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	Yeah I am doing so much stuff on this pc ( studying Computer Engineering Technology ) and I need it badly because I need to read an e-book
2009-08-01T12:36:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	that sucks =\ i hope the BIOS reset works.. but you better start saving up some money just in case
2009-08-01T12:37:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	I know lolz at least the Hard Drive and Ram is working
2009-08-01T12:38:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	Hey which is the package I need to download for adobe flash player
2009-08-01T12:39:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	the non-free one i think.. but i usually just download the deb from adobe's website
2009-08-01T12:39:00.000Z	Phantom1654	moymoy	okay cause my mom gets on my back because she needs freaking Farm Town
2009-08-01T12:40:00.000Z	moymoy	Phantom1654	rofl! her little flash games?
