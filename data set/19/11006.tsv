2006-05-25T12:47:00.000Z	odin_		will dapper fix the problem of firefox spontaneously closing, and too much activity resulting in a random system crash?
2006-05-25T12:47:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	no.
2006-05-25T12:48:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	well, for the too much activity resulting crash.. that's better than in breezy to me anyways.
2006-05-25T12:49:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	 but firefox still spontaneously closes?
2006-05-25T12:50:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	yeah :/
2006-05-25T12:50:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	 is there any simple reason for that?  at least good to know that I'm not the only one having that problem
2006-05-25T12:51:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	I guess it's because that's the first thing programmed to close if there's a need to free memory.
2006-05-25T12:51:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	 really, it's cuz I don't have enough ram?
2006-05-25T12:52:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	I think so, but I couldn't say.
2006-05-25T12:52:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	 seems to happen even when I don't have much open
2006-05-25T12:53:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	yeah. I had that a lot in breezy.
2006-05-25T13:28:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	You need to mount the drive and well.. then it just there to read.
2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	Dapper does that automatically and places symlink to your desktop.
2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	 oh, is that all?  things are always just so simple...
2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	 I forget, how do I check my hard drive's partitions again?
2006-05-25T13:36:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	in case anyone didn't already tell you: fdisk -l /dev/hdX
2006-05-25T13:36:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	thanks
2006-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	Samuli^	odin_	you want to add your windows partition into fstab of course.
2006-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	odin_	Samuli^	okay, um, that didn't work....o.O
