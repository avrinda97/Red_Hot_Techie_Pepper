2006-03-01T07:05:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	heh, the ultimate window manager
2006-03-01T07:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	Or... Just: ":set ff=dos"
2006-03-01T07:16:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	that will hide them in vim but leave them in the file I believe
2006-03-01T07:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	vim tries to be smart. If it detects line endings in dos, it'll do it in dos, and likewise for unix.
2006-03-01T07:17:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	yeah
2006-03-01T07:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	But if you set the encoding, I'm 99% sure that it'll write it in that format.
2006-03-01T07:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	In this case, there must've been a mixup somewhere, perhaps some configuration isn't quite right, or there is some confusion in the file (mixed line endings?)
2006-03-01T07:21:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	2.2 is potato?
2006-03-01T07:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	Yes.
2006-03-01T07:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	Worked well on the 486.
2006-03-01T07:21:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	yeah, that's the first debian I installed
2006-03-30T06:40:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	heh, the debian user shining through? ;)
2006-03-30T06:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	Heh :)
2006-03-30T06:57:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	don't say that to the plan 9 guys ;)
2006-03-30T06:57:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	Plan9 guys should stop playing around and modify linux to the environment.
2006-03-30T07:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	I assume that's what *+patches means.
2006-03-30T07:05:00.000Z	amphi	Arafangion	?
2006-03-30T07:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	amphi	+patches are generally backports with respect to the kernel, imho.
