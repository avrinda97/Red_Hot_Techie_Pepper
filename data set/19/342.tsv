2012-09-19T18:18:00.000Z	alusion		Hello Ubuntu, I want to SSH to my home machine while I am at work -- how do I set this up quickly?
2012-09-19T18:18:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	you have to set up the ssh server on the work machine first
2012-09-19T18:19:00.000Z	alusion	|Anthony|	do you know of the command
2012-09-19T18:19:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	what os is on the work machine?
2012-09-19T18:20:00.000Z	alusion		the one I want to SSH to is ubuntu 12.04 but the one I am ssh'ing from is an android tablet
2012-09-19T18:21:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	here is a quick howto: http://www.ubuntututorials.com/enable-ssh-ubuntu-12-04/
2012-09-19T18:22:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	but you should do some further configuration imo
2012-09-19T18:23:00.000Z	alusion	|Anthony|	 when editing the configuration files, what are some safety configurations I should be aware of?
2012-09-19T18:29:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	one moment
2012-09-19T18:36:00.000Z	alusion		I'm still here btw, |Anthony|
2012-09-19T18:36:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	i was looking for a good how to for you, but i can't seem to find an all encompassing one so i'll give a quick outline you can research further
2012-09-19T18:37:00.000Z	alusion		I'd appreciate that greatly, |Anthony| ! Thanks for trying ^_^
2012-09-19T18:39:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	1) setup pre-shared keys 2) use a passphrase 3) limit the number of allowed active ssh connections 4) change the port from the standard port 22 5) configure your os firewall (ufw) to only allow connections from the IPs you want to access it 6) do the same thing on the network firewall/router
2012-09-19T18:40:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	oh and deny root access of course
2012-09-19T18:40:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	4) and 5) are a bit redundant but i'm paranoid
2012-09-19T18:41:00.000Z	alusion	|Anthony|	thank you! How long should the passphrase be typically, 16-20 characters?
2012-09-19T18:42:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	well... mine (for example) is about 40 character
2012-09-19T18:43:00.000Z	alusion		0_0
2012-09-19T18:52:00.000Z	|Anthony|	alusion	you good?
