2008-01-11T02:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	there is no boot sector on your drive by the sounds of it
2008-01-11T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	boot the windows XP disk and use the fixboot options
2008-01-11T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	from rescue mode
2008-01-11T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	why can't you get into rescue mode
2008-01-11T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	most likley you've lost your boot sector
2008-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	yes, boot from a windows XP cd and use the fixboot options
2008-01-11T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	then something is wrong with your hardware
2008-01-11T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	check the error message

2008-01-11T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	your hardware has an issue then as I told you
2008-01-11T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	if you can't use the ubuntu livecd and you can't use the windows cd
2008-01-11T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ShawnEckhart	you can't install, you can't use the ubuntu cd and you can't use the windows cd - you get blue screens, sounds like a hardware error
