2005-12-05T13:57:00.000Z	ruairi	blue-frog	It seems to decript fine, the problem is not one of a totally garbled output, just the edges of any moving objects become fuzzed, with every 3rd or 4th line being offset by about a cm
2005-12-05T13:57:00.000Z	blue-frog	ruairi	try installing mplayer or oggledvd to see if it does the same
2005-12-05T14:01:00.000Z	ruairi	blue-frog	ok sorry, not oggledvd, it was ogle
