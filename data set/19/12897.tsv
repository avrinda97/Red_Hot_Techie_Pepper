2009-01-09T23:48:00.000Z	PMantis		Can someone please help explain why I'm getting out of disk space messages with 2.8G free?  (http://paste.ubuntu.com/102868/)
2009-01-09T23:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	 how big a hard drve total? 5% is normally reserved for root/system recovery
2009-01-09T23:49:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	57% free!
2009-01-09T23:50:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	6.5G drive, one partition (/). If you check my pastbin, you'll see it all:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/102868/
2009-01-09T23:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	 what is saying you are getting out of disk space exactly?
2009-01-09T23:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	I would have to suggest booting a live cd and fscking the filesystem
2009-01-09T23:52:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	Please look at my pastebin. 'touch' (0 bype file) won't run. apt-get refuses to do anything either because it has 'no breathing room'?? I think 57% of the hard disk is plenty of space.
2009-01-09T23:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	I would have to suggest booting a live cd and fscking the filesystem   <---------------------- I would try this..
2009-01-09T23:54:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	And what do you mean by try? run it and hope it does magic? I've had this happen on this system many times, and I have to delete all logs, then apt-get clean, apt-get autoremove, remove old kernels, etc.
2009-01-09T23:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	 its 1/2 full and it says its full.. sounds to me like the filesystem has gotten currupted.   Try removing some stuff I guess.. but sonmthing seems very odd in your drive
2009-01-09T23:55:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	But on other systems, I've seen them run to exactly 0% disk space free. Why is *this* install different - that's my main question... something deeper is wrong.
2009-01-09T23:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	 right. I would guess Filesystem CUrruption. Or the HD is goind bad.
2009-01-09T23:56:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	It's definitely not a bad drive, many other system are on this SAN.
2009-01-09T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	 not sure what a 'san' is. So it may be some very odd issue that ive never herd of.
2009-01-09T23:56:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	I have ran fsck, gpartend, etc on a live CD before... never helped. I can try again.
2009-01-09T23:56:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	Fiber channel storage.
2009-01-09T23:57:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	It's an industry standard for enterprise storage.
2009-01-10T00:00:00.000Z	PMantis	Dr_willis	Do you know how to check the # of inodes on the filesystem?
2009-01-10T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	PMantis	 not really. Been ages sinvce ive had to mess with that stuff
