2010-07-17T09:15:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		grub-pc is being updated, and its asking me where I want to install it
2010-07-17T09:15:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		i have linux on /dev/sda6, windows on /dev/sda
2010-07-17T09:16:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		where do I install grub to
2010-07-17T09:17:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	You can install it to the mbr or the first boot sector or sda
2010-07-17T09:17:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	*of sda
2010-07-17T09:18:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	Oh wait. You have windows on sda... you have to install to mbr
2010-07-17T09:18:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	Zatcharius	There are 3 choices, sda, which is windows, sda6 which is my linux partition, and another one is my flash drive obviously thats not the right one
2010-07-17T09:18:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		so im guessing i just select sda6
2010-07-17T09:18:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		and that will still allow me to access windows
2010-07-17T09:19:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	Go for it. I'm surprised there's not an option for the mbr
2010-07-17T09:19:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	Zatcharius	you sure this wont mess anything up?
2010-07-17T09:19:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	I've always installed to either mbr or first boot sector... I have no idea
2010-07-17T09:19:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	Zatcharius	I am very hesistant to do this if youre not sure
2010-07-17T09:21:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	sda should be your mbr
2010-07-17T09:21:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	sda1 is your windows partition
2010-07-17T09:21:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	Zatcharius	I am upgrading to Ubuntu 10.04 from an older version, so I already had Grub installed
2010-07-17T09:22:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		however, my nvidia module apparently didndt work, so i have a low graphics desktop right now
2010-07-17T09:23:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	I'd install to sda. It's your mbr. From there grub will allow your to boot from sda6 or chainload to windows
2010-07-17T09:24:00.000Z	Zatcharius	Silent_Dream	However, you may need to edit /boot/menu.lst to point it to sda1. Usually, it's detect automatically though.
