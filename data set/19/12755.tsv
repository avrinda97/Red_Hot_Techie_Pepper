2005-07-13T05:00:00.000Z	chris24tn		hi, folks. i have an odd (and probably horribly newb) question: is there an easy way to move a panel?  I moved my top panel to the right, and now it blew my icons up HUGE, and I can't right-click on the panel to change it's properties, and I can't drag it up to the top.
2005-07-13T05:01:00.000Z	chris24tn		how can I get it back to the top?
2005-07-13T05:02:00.000Z	chris24tn		that's what i'm saying
2005-07-13T05:02:00.000Z	rasputnik	chris24tn	but why? are the icons too big or something?
2005-07-13T05:02:00.000Z	chris24tn		when i moved it over, my applications menus and such are up at the top, then it immediately goes to HUGE icons (4 of them), and after that the rest of the bar
2005-07-13T05:02:00.000Z	chris24tn		can't right click on anything that is the panel itself, i've thuroughly checked the whole bar
2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	chris24tn		the icons are like 90-100 pixels wide
2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	chris24tn		nm, figured it out: had to delete a couple of icons, to get some free (blank) panel space
2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	chris24tn		now i can change it back
2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	chris24tn		will have to re-add those icons, tho
2005-07-13T05:04:00.000Z	chris24tn		if i submit that as a bug report, do you think anyone would take me seriously?
2005-07-13T05:04:00.000Z	chris24tn		exactly
2005-07-13T05:05:00.000Z	chris24tn		um...how do i submit a bug report? i mean, gnome is huge, is there a person or list or something i should send gui useability issues to?
2005-07-13T05:05:00.000Z	rasputnik	chris24tn	I think you could have tweaked something in 'configuration editor' - it has loads of settings for the panel
2005-07-13T05:05:00.000Z	chris24tn		hmm
2005-07-13T05:06:00.000Z	rasputnik	chris24tn	I remember the first ever gnome beta back on the 2.0 kernels. It stank, the panel expanded to eat your screen several times a day
2005-07-13T05:06:00.000Z	chris24tn	rasputnik	that's still not intuitive or simple, which is something i think ubuntu works towards
2005-07-13T05:06:00.000Z	chris24tn	rasputnik	lol. they've come a very long way,t rue
2005-07-13T05:07:00.000Z	rasputnik	chris24tn	no, it's a bug for definite. you should google for 'gnome usability project', they do exist
