2008-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	Grab		hello, is it possible to install a mini linux distro in a few MBs of space, (with a gui) ?
2008-12-04T00:30:00.000Z	Grab		i need to run a virtual OS on that linux distro
2008-12-04T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	there is a minimal ubuntu install option available
2009-01-05T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	it is much more stable than it was, however there is still a risk, just much smaller
2009-01-05T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	it is reversed engineer so nothing is perfect
2009-01-05T18:23:00.000Z	Grab	ikonia	 what do you mean exactly?
2009-01-05T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	exactly what I've just said
2009-01-05T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	what part is not clear ?
2009-01-05T18:26:00.000Z	Grab	ikonia	 i got you. you mean that microsoft didnt tell how ntfs work.
2009-01-05T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	how NTFS works is not known to anyone other than microsoft, the open source developers implimented their version of the tools
2009-01-05T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	depends if you feel you need it
2009-01-05T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	this isn't windows
2009-01-05T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	anti-virus probably not as long as you apply common sense to how you work.
2009-01-05T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	firewall, if your connected directly to the internet and running services, possibly a good idea
2009-01-05T18:32:00.000Z	Grab	ikonia	 what firewall?
2009-01-05T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	you can read ntfs - no problem
2009-01-05T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	I explained the potential risks of writing to ntfs earlier
2009-01-05T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	please investigate the bot in a private message
2009-01-05T18:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Grab	no difference
