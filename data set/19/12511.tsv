2005-09-18T14:38:00.000Z	hexion		many people has adviced me (mainly mi operating-systems teachers)
2005-09-18T14:39:00.000Z	hexion		oh, another issue...
2005-09-18T14:39:00.000Z	hexion		is there any way to launch apt-get dist-upgrade and force it to download X packages at a time?
2005-09-18T14:40:00.000Z	bob2	hexion	yes, but it would be painful. why?
2005-09-18T14:41:00.000Z	hexion		I explain... actually my apt-get downloads just make a single download at a time... but that way I don't waste the whole downloading-rate of my ISP
2005-09-18T14:41:00.000Z	hexion		of my ADSL..
2005-09-18T14:41:00.000Z	hexion		sometimes apt-get downloaded 2 or 3 files at a time.. and it was much faster
2005-09-18T14:42:00.000Z	hexion		but I don't know how to control the number of downloads apt-get make
2005-09-18T14:47:00.000Z	hexion	bob2	can you tell me how to do that? (setting apt to download 3 files at a time)
2005-09-18T14:48:00.000Z	bob2	hexion	why do you want to do that?
2005-09-18T14:49:00.000Z	hexion	bob2	because when apt-get (sometimes) downloaded 3 files at a time, it was very much faster
2005-09-18T14:49:00.000Z	bob2	hexion	oh, you mean simulatenously? no.
