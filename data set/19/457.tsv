2012-02-15T18:26:00.000Z	qmr1		What is the proper way to remove a PPA from the command line?
2012-02-15T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	sudo ppa-purge address
2012-02-15T18:27:00.000Z	qmr1	ActionParsnip	that's what I found on google bu tI don't have that command installed
2012-02-15T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	not thought to install it then...?
2012-02-15T18:28:00.000Z	qmr1	ActionParsnip	what is the package name?
2012-02-15T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	guess.. it's pretty obvious in this case
2012-02-15T18:28:00.000Z	qmr1	ActionParsnip	... it's not in the standard repos?
2012-02-15T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	wanna bet
2012-02-15T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	its in the universe repo
2012-02-15T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	if you run a command and its not installed, the OS will suggest the packagename to install
2012-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	qmr1	ActionParsnip	I have universe enabled, still not showing up ..
2012-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
2012-02-15T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	can you give a pastebin of the output of:  gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-02-15T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	ok, then run:  sudo apt-get install pastebinit; pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-02-15T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	pastebinit is a cli pastebin command, dead handy
2012-02-15T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	you can give an option to use a different bin, not sure what a bad pastebni is tbh
2012-02-15T18:34:00.000Z	qmr1	ActionParsnip	copying line numbers w source code, font that makes it hard to distinguish between 1 and l, O and 0, tiny font, among other things
2012-02-15T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	ok, basically the PPAs make files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d    if you delete the files in that folder relating to the PPA, it will do the same thing
2012-02-15T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmr1	strange it's not in there
