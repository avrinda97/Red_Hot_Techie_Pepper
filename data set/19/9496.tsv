2006-11-01T07:53:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	I have an iRiver 790.  It is nice in most ways (1G flash)
2006-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	neonempyr		Falstiul: good battery life on that?
2006-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	1 AAA battery, supposedly lasts 19 hours.  It 'feels' good.  A fresh battery can record for many hours on end.  I used it recently to record some family history that my aunt was relating.
2006-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	neonempyr	Falstiu1	sounds good. have any idea of the bitrate on those recordings and how they sound to you as far as quality and mic sensitivity?
2006-11-01T07:56:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	you can set the recording quality (sample rate, bitrate, mic gain) ... it is 'pretty good' with the built in mic and there is a line-in jack.
2006-11-01T07:56:00.000Z	neonempyr	Falstiu1	thanks a lot mate, you've just ended my quest. :)
2006-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	I'm not an audiophile though.  For simple voice it is great ... it even has an auto-detect.
2006-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	neonempyr	Falstiu1	yep, not looking for broadcast quality or anything, just for memos and lectures.
2006-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	oh, 1 caviat.  The firmware that comes on it doesn't act like a USB hard drive.  There is an official version of the firmware that does, but it was difficult to find.
2006-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	neonempyr		falstiu1: do you know if there is an updated model with the same features that they are selling?
2006-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	not by name ... I haven't looked much since I got mine 3 years ago.
2006-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	neonempyr		falstiu1: Do you remember where you got that update?
2006-11-01T08:04:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	you can get the UMS (the mass storage firmare) here http://www.iriveramerica.com/support/ums.aspx   .... the new T30 (the updated version of the ifp-790 I have) doesn't have a UMS version though.
2006-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	neonempyr	Falstiu1	is there a list of their devices that are UMS compatible? I don't see one
2006-11-01T08:07:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	that link lists UMS versions of the firmware that are available.  Even without the UMS firmware, there is an opensource utility that lets you use the dev with linux.  It is a little annoying though.
2006-11-01T08:07:00.000Z	neonempyr	Falstiu1	looks like iRiver now suppors T series UMS: http://www.mtp-ums.net/
2006-11-01T08:09:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	cool.  I wish I had an excuse to buy a new one :)  They're about half as much now.
2006-11-01T08:09:00.000Z	neonempyr		falstiu1: yep. thanks again mate, night
2006-11-01T08:10:00.000Z	Falstiu1	neonempyr	np.
