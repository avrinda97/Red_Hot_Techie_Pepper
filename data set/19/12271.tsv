2005-11-16T11:47:00.000Z	Knelix2		hmm.
2005-11-16T11:48:00.000Z	Knelix2		Its seems to output fine in terminal mode. It's just X that doesn't show.
2005-11-16T11:49:00.000Z	Knelix2		Newbie Question: I use the terminal, but usually in X. Toi run a new process I just open a new terminal window, but how can you run to processes in terminal mode?
2005-11-16T11:49:00.000Z	Knelix2		(console mode)
2005-11-16T11:49:00.000Z	Knelix2		*two proceses, that is
2005-11-16T11:50:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	&
2005-11-16T11:51:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	exe ?
2005-11-16T11:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	alt-crtrl-f7
2005-11-16T11:54:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	f1-f6 are terminals... f7 is X
2005-11-16T11:54:00.000Z	Knelix2	wickedpuppy	Ah, right, thanks.
2005-11-16T11:55:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	can be both ??
2005-11-16T11:56:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	type mail ... and select the number of the mail you wanna read
2005-11-16T12:11:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	if you put the command in background with & yes
2005-11-16T12:12:00.000Z	Knelix2	wickedpuppy	huh? hmm... I didn't do that
2005-11-16T12:13:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	then go back to that terminal and see if its running ?? why you need f3 or f4 btw .. xterm or kterm not good enough ?
2005-11-16T12:14:00.000Z	Knelix2	wickedpuppy	Because I need to output to TV, and only the terminal will do this, not X.
2005-11-16T12:14:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	if default is background then fine :P
2005-11-16T12:16:00.000Z	Knelix2	wickedpuppy	OK :-) Just to know- you type the command and then & right after it to run it in the background, right?
2005-11-16T12:16:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Knelix2	yes ... but default behaviour is in bg then no need
