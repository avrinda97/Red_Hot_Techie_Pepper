2007-10-22T04:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Just use sound recorder and attach it to an email?
2007-10-22T04:24:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	bruenig ok, thanks
2007-10-22T04:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Please clarify. The recorded sound is silence, or something else?
2007-10-22T04:33:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	i can record, but when clicking on play, it dosn't play anything.
2007-10-22T04:33:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	it looks like the record itself if fine (i see the time counter after i hit 'record')
2007-10-22T04:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Does it play as if the track is silence, ie, the recorded sound is the right length but contains silence.
2007-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	or does it simply refuse to play anything?
2007-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	it refuse to play. i click 'play' and nothing happened,
2007-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Try saving the file and then try.
2007-10-22T04:35:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	could not save the file "invalid parameters"
2007-10-22T04:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Google it. Known problem I think, meh.
2007-10-22T04:35:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	ok, thanks
2007-10-22T04:42:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	it's ok, but the volume is teriblely low!
2007-10-22T04:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Do you have a speaker icon in the top right?
2007-10-22T04:43:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	top upper corner of my ubuntu? yes.
2007-10-22T04:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Right click > Open Volume Controls
2007-10-22T04:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	Look under recording for "Mic volume" or whatever. Also check for "mic boost"
2007-10-22T04:46:00.000Z	owen1	Stormx2	i raised all the gauges and it's better. i couldn't find any boos or anything.
2007-10-22T04:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	owen1	You may have to enable that option. Edit > Preferences, find the "boost" or "mic boost" option, and check the box. It'll appear under the "switches" tab when you're done
