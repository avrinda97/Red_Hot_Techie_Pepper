2010-08-15T18:29:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	what trouble does it ?
2010-08-15T18:35:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	basically it crashes when I play .avi at full screen
2010-08-15T18:36:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	system > hardwaredrivers, driver installed ?
2010-08-15T18:38:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	nvidia accelerated graphics driver (version current) [reccommended]
2010-08-15T18:38:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	so it is installed, all packages up to date ?
2010-08-15T18:39:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-08-15T18:39:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	I am a paranoid patcher
2010-08-15T18:39:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	what app you use to play avi's ?
2010-08-15T18:40:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	usually vlc or Movie Player
2010-08-15T18:41:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	start vlc from trml and watch an avi, afterwards the freeze check it's otput there and look also in /var/log/syslog and messages ;; I assume enough ram, not oc'ed to a limit and harddrive not full, there should be additional info
2010-08-15T18:50:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	I can't see any references to vlc in messages or syslog
2010-08-15T18:52:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	what does happen , if the freeze occurs, is just vlc not playing on or does the whole desktop freeze ?
2010-08-15T19:01:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	When the vlc's picture locks I still get sound
2010-08-15T19:02:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	does the pc become inresponsive ?
2010-08-15T19:04:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	?
2010-08-15T19:06:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	I was reading this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1058836&highlight=vlc+crash+fullscreen+avi
2010-08-15T19:06:00.000Z	DasEi	digifor	It's a little nervy if you response takes such a long time, could you please answer to my questions ?
2010-08-15T19:07:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	it gave me the idea to look in the vlc settings. Ticked the box that says 'Fullscreen' and vlc seems to work without crashing
2010-08-15T19:08:00.000Z	digifor	DasEi	Thanks for your assistance at any rate
