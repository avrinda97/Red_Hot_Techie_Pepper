2006-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	use pastebin and put a copy of your fstab
2006-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	add them to fstab, and remember the user option
2006-06-02T10:31:00.000Z	TokenBad	paradizelost	if I go to places and then computer....it shows them...but says can't mount them...but if I do df -h it don't even show the drives/partitions so don't know what to put them as..hdd1 or what
2006-06-02T10:33:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	the line for your fstab for the windows, assuming hda1 is windows is
2006-06-02T10:34:00.000Z	TokenBad	paradizelost	you don't understand...I can't seem to find what the drive is labeled as...hdd1 or hda1 or what
2006-06-02T10:35:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	use cfdisk or gparted
2006-06-02T10:40:00.000Z	TokenBad	paradizelost	my drive is fat32 not ntfs
2006-06-02T10:40:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	so change the ntfs part to vfat
2006-06-02T10:43:00.000Z	TokenBad	paradizelost	ok if my one partition is ext3 would I use the same user info?
2006-06-02T12:22:00.000Z	TokenBad	paradizelost	ok if my one partition is ext3 would I use the same user info?
2006-08-22T08:13:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	did you run a gui program w/ sudo and not gksudo?
2006-09-13T08:52:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	sounds like you could have a bad disc or bad hardware, or just generally something went wrong in the install
2006-09-13T08:53:00.000Z	paradizelost	TokenBad	be sure to run a cd media check
