2005-06-11T07:08:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	typical
2005-06-11T07:09:00.000Z	dbernar1	cafuego	is he gonna work right at some point?
2005-06-11T07:09:00.000Z	dbernar1	cafuego	your opinion....
2005-06-11T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	Depends on whether the author will fix his code eh.
2005-06-11T07:10:00.000Z	dbernar1	cafuego	any other one we could use? I mean, dpkg does not seem to have these issues...
2005-06-11T07:10:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	dpkg is identical code though.
2005-06-11T07:10:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	I think he got confused yesterday when the package download went wonky.
2005-07-18T09:39:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	You could typosquat and buy ubunto.com
2005-08-26T06:39:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	They just don't suffer fools well. neither should #ubuntu.
2005-08-26T06:40:00.000Z	dbernar1	cafuego	there is a dose of jellaousy I find, among some.
2005-08-26T06:41:00.000Z	cafuego	dbernar1	Not really, people there just get shitty (rightly so) when people on another distro start asking for help. After saying "We don't know, we use something else" 10,000 times you'd get irritated as well.
2005-08-26T06:42:00.000Z	dbernar1	cafuego	well, I am not in the mood for a conversation on that, and I understand what you mean.
2005-12-25T08:27:00.000Z	dbernar1	cafuego	haha. What is with the bot name ubotflu? You never told me. Cause it is flu season?
