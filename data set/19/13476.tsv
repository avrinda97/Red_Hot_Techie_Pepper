2005-03-26T10:22:00.000Z	desrt		it's a command-line tool
2005-03-26T10:22:00.000Z	desrt		it has every mixer channel on your system
2005-03-26T10:22:00.000Z	desrt		play a song and turn all the channels up until it starts working
2005-03-26T10:22:00.000Z	desrt		on my desktop i had to enable 'audigy analog' and on my laptop some other weird thing
2005-03-26T10:22:00.000Z	desrt		n0mad;  some channels look like [OO] 
2005-03-26T10:23:00.000Z	desrt		and some like [MM] 
2005-03-26T10:23:00.000Z	desrt		[MM]  means that it's muted... the 'm' key will turn it on
