2009-10-06T04:58:00.000Z	soreau	eido	If you have troubles with getting compiz to work, we can help you in #compiz
2009-10-06T04:59:00.000Z	eido	soreau	i have problems with x compiz works flawlessly when x works but thank you
2009-10-06T05:02:00.000Z	soreau	eido	Can you show the output of 'egrep "XAA|EXA|UXA" /var/log/Xorg.0.log'?

2009-10-06T05:07:00.000Z	eido	soreau	sorry pastebin seems to having problems
2009-10-06T05:20:00.000Z	soreau	eido	Oh yea, pastebin has been having problems all day
2009-10-06T05:21:00.000Z	soreau	eido	Which version of ubuntu do you have there?
2009-10-06T05:21:00.000Z	eido	soreau	99.04
2009-10-06T05:22:00.000Z	soreau	eido	Try UXA acceleration method to see if it helps by putting the following line in the Device section of xorg.conf: Option "AccelMethod" "UXA"
2009-10-06T05:22:00.000Z	soreau	eido	Or just change EXA to UXA if that line is already there
2009-10-06T05:23:00.000Z	soreau	eido	This way, you will have DRI2 and gl should work better with compiz (dragging glxgears window around will stay with the window instead of leaving a mess on your screen for example)
2009-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	eido	soreau	this is my current xorg http://pastebin.com/m45a2690a
2009-10-06T05:27:00.000Z	soreau	eido	You see the Device section? That's where you put: Option "AccelMethod" "UXA"
2009-10-06T05:30:00.000Z	eido	soreau	is there a text editor that i can launch gksudo other than pico which seems to have issues from text copied from browsers
2009-10-06T05:31:00.000Z	soreau	eido	gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-06T05:31:00.000Z	eido	soreau	thanks much easier
