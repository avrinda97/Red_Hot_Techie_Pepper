2007-03-04T17:23:00.000Z	phatrabbit		Hi i have a problem with Ubuntu 6.10. When i boot up ubuntu it shows the ubuntu loading screen and then my monitor goes to standby
2007-03-04T17:23:00.000Z	phatrabbit		it was working fine before
2007-03-04T17:23:00.000Z	phatrabbit		!xorg
2007-03-04T17:24:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	is someone helping you?
2007-03-04T17:25:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	nope i tried restarting xorg but i get this drum noise and my monitor tuirns off
2007-03-04T17:25:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	ubuntu used to work correctly for you, or did you just install it?
2007-03-04T17:26:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	no i have not changed anything its a fresh install and i got all the updates
2007-03-04T17:26:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	what is the command to reconfigure my xorg
2007-03-04T17:59:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	do you have any ideas. everytime i update my xconf to the new nvidia drivers my monitor goes to standby. so i think the drivers are not compatible
2007-03-04T06:00:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	I know that when I triple-booted my computer I had the same problem
2007-03-04T06:00:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	no i am only using XP and ubuntu
2007-03-04T06:00:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	I think that my computer did not like 64bit ubuntu at all
2007-03-04T06:01:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	I think the principal still applies
2007-03-04T06:01:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	how do i check if my ubuntu is 64 or 32
2007-03-04T06:02:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	do you have your ubuntu install CD?
2007-03-04T06:03:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	have you tried booting from that?
2007-03-04T06:03:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	well i can just reconfigure my xserver and it fixes it
2007-03-04T06:03:00.000Z	phatrabbit	st0n3cutt3r	its just i am puzzled becos i am updating my nvidia drivers and they dont work so what else am i spose to do :(
2007-03-04T06:06:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	phatrabbit	I'm sorry, I'm a noob with linux, I just know that I was having a very similar problem and thought I might offer up my solution
