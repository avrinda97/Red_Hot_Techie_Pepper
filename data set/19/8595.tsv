2007-03-07T13:44:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651		Where should I turn for a question?
2007-03-07T13:45:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651		I just tried running ubuntu for the first time...
2007-03-07T13:45:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651		allright, I tried to run ubuntu from the CD, it loaded, and right when it was finished I get a black screen, and I get a monitor-error saying something like "frequency out of range" -_-'
2007-03-07T13:46:00.000Z	Vaalth	UT_Guest_651	: it sounds like youre trying to use a resolution that your monitor doesn't support
2007-03-07T13:47:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651	Vaalth	Yes! but I never "tried" using any particluar resolution. :)
2007-03-07T13:48:00.000Z	Vaalth	UT_Guest_651	: this is before you choose your preferred resolution?
2007-03-07T13:48:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651	Vaalth	yes, it loaded, got to 100%, I was expecting to see ubuntu for the first time, and then..black!
2007-03-07T13:49:00.000Z	Vaalth	UT_Guest_651	: sorry, but i don't know how to fix that. if you stick around someone here should be able to help you though. :)
2007-03-07T13:49:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651	Vaalth	oki, thanx mate. SHould I keep repeating my question?
2007-03-07T13:50:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651		:D
2007-03-07T13:50:00.000Z	Vaalth	UT_Guest_651	: if no one answers then yes, but not too often. ;)
2007-03-07T13:50:00.000Z	Vaalth		is there anyone here knowledgable with x that would be able to help me with a fatal error im getting?
2007-03-07T13:51:00.000Z	Vaalth		(WW) ATI: PCI Mach64 in slot 5:0:0 could not be detected
2007-03-07T13:51:00.000Z	UT_Guest_651		Waalth: Do you think it has to do with my tv-out? I have no clue how ubuntu handles tv-out. also I have two display-outputs, one dig and one ana.
