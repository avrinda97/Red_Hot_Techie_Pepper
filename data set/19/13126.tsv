2005-05-16T09:40:00.000Z	nat_		call me a n00b, its ok, I am one, but I have a (perhaps stupid) question
2005-05-16T09:40:00.000Z	nat_		whenever I load synaptic, I get this error message:
2005-05-16T09:41:00.000Z	nat_		: Couldn't stat source package list http://.archive.ubuntu.com hoary/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_hoary_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
2005-05-16T09:41:00.000Z	nat_		my take on it is that I am failing to connect
2005-05-16T09:41:00.000Z	nat_		yet, I can go online
2005-05-16T09:42:00.000Z	nat_		oh, ok
2005-05-16T09:43:00.000Z	nat_		what can one do about that sort of thing?
2005-05-16T09:43:00.000Z	sir-gold	nat_	im looking on google for it
2005-05-16T09:43:00.000Z	nat_		thinks, sir-gold
2005-05-16T09:44:00.000Z	nat_	sir-gold	the reason i thought it had to do with connection issues was that my machine was really reluctant to connect to the internet
2005-05-16T09:45:00.000Z	sir-gold	nat_	did you refresh synaptic after adding sources?
2005-05-16T09:45:00.000Z	nat_		I'm connecting through a shared connection on a winXP machine
2005-05-16T09:45:00.000Z	nat_		yes
2005-05-16T09:45:00.000Z	nat_		i believe so
2005-05-16T09:46:00.000Z	nat_		well....maybe not since my connection started working, actually
2005-05-16T09:47:00.000Z	sir-gold	nat_	refresh again and see if that helps
2005-05-16T09:47:00.000Z	nat_	sir-gold	i think that's doing it, it seems to be dl'ing
2005-05-16T09:47:00.000Z	nat_		d'oh, that was rather dumb on my part
2005-05-16T09:48:00.000Z	nat_	sir-gold	its checking the repositories, which was the source of the error before, so yeah, that did it
