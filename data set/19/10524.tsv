2006-06-10T11:13:00.000Z	farous	makko	you can use aptitude for installing and when you remove it wil take care of that for you
2006-06-10T11:14:00.000Z	makko	farous	aptitude does that automatically??

2006-06-10T11:15:00.000Z	makko	farous	what if i use synaptic for installation and aptitude for uninstallation?
2006-06-10T11:15:00.000Z	farous	makko	you have to use it for both
2006-06-10T11:16:00.000Z	makko	farous	i see... so aptitude is just smarter.
2006-06-10T11:16:00.000Z	farous	makko	there is a filter in synaptic though that will display unused packages
2006-06-10T11:17:00.000Z	makko	farous	i don't find that filter in synaptic
2006-06-10T11:17:00.000Z	makko	farous	does it depend on having installed deborphan?
2006-06-10T11:18:00.000Z	farous	makko	never used it. the filter i told you about is in custom bottom
2006-06-10T11:23:00.000Z	makko	farous	my synaptic / custom / search filter  shows... all the packages available in apt-get
