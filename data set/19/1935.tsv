2010-08-27T08:13:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		this is kinda important to get fixed :(
2010-08-27T08:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		I didn't change any settings since I got Ubuntu, and it just started doing this today
2010-08-27T08:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		I can type it, but I can't see it
2010-08-27T08:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2010-08-27T08:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		I couldn't see _anything_ until I pressed enter on that line
2010-08-27T08:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		text documents, and _all_ of the menus...
2010-08-27T08:15:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		the "m" is there.
2010-08-27T08:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		both of them
2010-08-27T08:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		but when I type in the character map input box thing, I can't see the "m"s I type
2010-08-27T08:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b		I'm so confused... I don't know how I broke it...
2010-08-27T08:19:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	A screenshot might help.
2010-08-27T08:21:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	fixermark	I'll get you a couple of screenshots. coming right up!

2010-08-27T08:26:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	Hunh. So specifically, it's your gnome desktop apps. Your taskbar, the various dialogs, etc. Your chat client is fine.
2010-08-27T08:26:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	My guess is that something bad happened to whatever default font your gnome session is using. I'd recommend zeroing in on that possibility.
2010-08-27T08:27:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	I believe you. But I'm out of other ideas. ;)
2010-08-27T08:29:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	If you're not interested in investigating the font issue, you could always move your data someplace safe and re-install from scratch.
2010-08-27T08:34:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	What is at the bottom, under the "Preview:" label?
2010-08-27T08:43:00.000Z	fixermark	ubuntu_n00b	You may also want to gifve your /etc/fonts/fonts.conf file a poke... See if anything in there makes no sense.
