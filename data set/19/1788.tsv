2010-10-09T09:23:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	i could jus search it on google nd hope i get results

2010-10-09T09:26:00.000Z	RRU_Sciguy	glithcd	just get a prog that can mount the vhd as another drive
2010-10-09T09:28:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	if i creat a vhd of my linux install, would it take up the same amount of space an my real install?
2010-10-09T09:28:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	im guessing so but idk
2010-10-09T09:29:00.000Z	RRU_Sciguy	glithcd	idk. all I know is that when I used Wubi to install ubuntu on a vhd, i created a 30GB vhd
2010-10-09T09:29:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	ok
2010-10-09T09:30:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	so if i do this, i can run linux inside of windows and vice versa?

2010-10-09T09:31:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	tensorpudding enav fuck it
2010-10-09T09:32:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	tensorpudding enav now i have a question about ext4 in win7
2010-10-09T09:32:00.000Z	RRU_Sciguy	glithcd	only if you install windows on a vhd. if you use Wubi, you can have ubuntu on a vhd, and access all your windows files after booting into ubuntu
2010-10-09T09:32:00.000Z	glithcd	RRU_Sciguy	tensorpudding enav any way to get win7 to understand and/or read/write to it?
2010-10-09T09:33:00.000Z	RRU_Sciguy	glithcd	i don;t have w7, but there is probably some program out there somewhere that can do it
