2005-05-08T06:01:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	syn-ack	heh, I'm still trying to figure out how to file bugs for universe packages
2005-05-08T06:02:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	Heh, Ive going some things here like libaspell that Im tracking... broke a few things like Pan and Bluefish so far
2005-05-08T06:07:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	syn-ack	so, how the hell do I file bugs for universe packages?
2005-05-08T06:08:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	it does... automagically scrambled
2005-05-08T06:09:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	syn-ack	ooh
2005-05-08T06:15:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	just check it out.. its like anyother bugzilla
2005-05-08T06:23:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	No it doesnt... OSS is only emulated in 2.6
2005-05-08T06:23:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	syn-ack	look again, you can build oss drivers in 2.6.
2005-05-08T06:23:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	xmms. :)
2005-05-08T06:25:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	My mac wont work without OSS
2005-05-08T06:28:00.000Z	syn-ack	Diablo-D3	Then you can call ATI and tell them to open the spec so that we can have a non suck driver for my video card.
2005-05-08T06:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	syn-ack	heh, dri is working on r300/400 drivers
2005-05-08T06:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	syn-ack	quake3 already... somewhat works on them
