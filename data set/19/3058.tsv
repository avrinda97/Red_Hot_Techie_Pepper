2009-11-02T08:32:00.000Z	Revol5		Anyone have experience with Firefox/Flash sound not working in Karmic?
2009-11-02T08:33:00.000Z	Revol5		Several ways so far actually haha
2009-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	Revol5		I've tried through synaptic, and the AMD64 alpha script on the forums
2009-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	Revol5		Then again I didnt uninstall flash before trying the script..
2009-11-02T08:35:00.000Z	Revol5		Thing is, Flash sound worked on the Live CD
2009-11-02T08:35:00.000Z	Revol5		But not when I upgraded my Jaunty to Karmic
2009-11-02T08:35:00.000Z	Revol5		No I have not seen that kinja I'll check it out
2009-11-02T08:36:00.000Z	Revol5		But how can I tell if the Firefox I'm running is 64bit?
2009-11-02T08:37:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	bottom line in "help - About firefox" Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091028 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.4
2009-11-02T09:08:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	there are a few people having that problem with PulseAudio
2009-11-02T09:09:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	change to alsa (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8217190#post8217190) and see if it helps
2009-11-02T09:09:00.000Z	Revol5	TheCheeze	but what's weird is that upgrading to Karmic has solved other PulseAudio problems I had, with XBMC
2009-11-02T09:10:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	let me know. It took me 3 days to figure out how to get rid of pulse lol
2009-11-02T09:11:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	ORLY?? how did you manage that??
2009-11-02T09:11:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	so did i, but karmic shoved pulse down my throat when i upgraded
2009-11-02T09:12:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	what sound card do you have?
2009-11-02T09:13:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	unfortunately i dont know how much help i can be in this case. i just know the many headaches that pulse gave me when i upgraded, including a random "ticking" when the speakers were muted
2009-11-02T23:40:00.000Z	TheCheeze	Revol5	did you add the firefox ppa to your repository?
2009-11-02T23:40:00.000Z	Revol5	TheCheeze	The one with 3.6 and 3.7? yeah
