2008-07-28T06:00:00.000Z	Gillpy	Nimn	use cfdisk or fdisk, both are fairly self-explanatory

2008-07-28T06:02:00.000Z	Nimn	Gillpy	it gives me  FATAL ERROR: Cannot open diskdrive
2008-07-28T06:04:00.000Z	Gillpy	Nimn	try passing it the device name  'cfdisk /dev/hda'  for example
2008-07-28T06:04:00.000Z	Nimn	Gillpy	ok
2008-07-28T06:05:00.000Z	Nimn	Gillpy	I get the same error
2008-07-28T06:07:00.000Z	Gillpy	Nimn	can you post the output of 'fdisk -l'

2008-07-28T06:08:00.000Z	Nimn	Gillpy	when i use gparted it says there are no conected devices, and when i go through the install process, there are no partitions for me to choose from

2008-07-28T06:13:00.000Z	Nimn	Gillpy	 could it be a problem with my ram? idk, for all my laptop knows, the harddrive isnt evenconnected
