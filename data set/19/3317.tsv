2010-09-22T00:18:00.000Z	quantumlemur		hey, I'm using firefox 3.6.9 on ubuntu 9.10 with flash 9.0, and I can't get the audio working.  I've tried various things already, including installing alsa-oss, which seemed to be the suggested way to fix it, but that didn't work.  When I open up the sound preferences dialogue, the "ALSA plugin" flickers in the Applications tab, which according to the internet, is indicative of the connection dropping frequently.  Any ideas?
2010-09-22T00:18:00.000Z	xangua	quantumlemur	the lates adobe flash plugin version is 10
2010-09-22T00:19:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	what is the recommended way to install it?  it doesn't show up as an updated package, even though I have the package installed
2010-09-22T00:19:00.000Z	xangua		what version of ubuntu are you using quantumlemur¿
2010-09-22T00:20:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	I'm on ubuntu 9.10.  And strange: I just checked, and aptitude says flash 10 is installed, but about:plugins says it's using 9.0
2010-09-22T00:21:00.000Z	xangua	quantumlemur	you just updated¿ rstar the browser
2010-09-22T00:22:00.000Z	xangua	quantumlemur	 also, are you using 64bit or 32bit
2010-09-22T00:22:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	there wasn't any update, and I did just restart the browser
2010-09-22T00:24:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	it's a 64-bit box, but I believe I had to install 32 bit flash originally; how do you tell which flash version you have, exactly?
2010-09-22T00:24:00.000Z	xangua	quantumlemur	well maybe using 64bit is the problem
2010-09-22T00:25:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	do you mean that I should install the 64bit version?
2010-09-22T00:26:00.000Z	xangua		no, i said using 64bit OS might be a problem since the flashplugin it uses is 32bit and it uses an extra plugin to force flashplugin to work
2010-09-22T00:26:00.000Z	xangua	quantumlemur	* see above
2010-09-22T00:27:00.000Z	xangua	quantumlemur	you may want to use the 32bit version to avoid this and other little issues in th future or wait until adobe delivers a new flashplugin for 64bit
2010-09-22T00:28:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	I see.  However, I did have flash audio working in the past.  Do you mean that I should use the 32bit version of ubuntu as a whole?  I probably cannot reload the machine
2010-09-22T00:30:00.000Z	xangua		you could also try the development 64bit plugin (under your own risk) http://www.webupd8.org/2010/09/adobe-flash-player-square-102-64bit.html

2010-09-22T00:32:00.000Z	quantumlemur	xangua	I can try that.  but first, I'm in the process of trying to reinstall (or uninstall) the existing flash packages, and both adobe-flashplugin and flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound show up as "ip" in an aptitude search, which would seem to be a contradiction.  I can't remove them because it says they aren't installed
