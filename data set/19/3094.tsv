2009-11-15T07:52:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	im in there they dont answer :(
2009-11-15T07:52:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	thanks anyway hehe
2009-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	epinky	freaky[t]	could you explain better what's the problem? I think that ns-cert-type server is not needed
2009-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	that has nothing to do with the problem. i cant ping the server from the client and vice versa
2009-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	with a windows client but with a linux client everything works
2009-11-15T08:13:00.000Z	epinky	freaky[t]	what version are you using on client and what on server?
2009-11-15T08:14:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	2.1 on server and 2.0.9 on client but there is no openvpn gui f√ºr 2.1
2009-11-15T08:15:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	well there is but ... i cant install it says tap driver not compatible and wont let me use it
2009-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	epinky	freaky[t]	I thinks it's incompatibility of version problem, TOPOLOGY is being misundesrtood by 2.0.9 client, can you try to downgrade/upgrade one of the two?
2009-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	not really
2009-11-15T08:20:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	:(
2009-11-15T08:21:00.000Z	epinky	freaky[t]	not even on VM ?
2009-11-15T08:21:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	what VM?
2009-11-15T08:22:00.000Z	epinky	freaky[t]	dunno, maybe VirtualBox :)
2009-11-15T08:22:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	i have nothing like that ...
2009-11-15T08:23:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	no i cant ... i have only 2.1 on the server via apt and only 2.0.9 on client because the 2.1 version is beta and the tap adapter driver cant be used
2009-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	epinky	freaky[t]	then, sorry and good luck
2009-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	freaky[t]	epinky	thanks
