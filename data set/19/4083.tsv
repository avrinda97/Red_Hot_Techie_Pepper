2010-01-21T08:31:00.000Z	Fezzler		anyone familiar with the whole pulseaudio / jack compatibiltiy issue?  Can they co-exist?
2010-01-21T08:33:00.000Z	tweaksource	Fezzler	I have never gotten pulseaudio to work with jack. Better of using ALSA or OSS.
2010-01-21T08:34:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	So just uninstall pulseaudio - that's what I figured.  I only installed it to record audio reference songs from YouTube for my guitar/Ardour sessions
2010-01-21T08:34:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	It introduced a ton of latency
2010-01-21T08:35:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	I guess there is another way to record YouTube video with fflmgr or something like that
2010-01-21T08:35:00.000Z	tweaksource	Fezzler	Yeah. I'm not a big fan of pa. pavucontrol is the best thing for it.
2010-01-21T08:36:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	I really don't need it.  Why do people like /need pusleaudio - it must serve some nitche
2010-01-21T08:42:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	Yea, especially when I don't have a lot of time to practice / play.
2010-01-21T08:43:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	pulseaudio - zapped.  gone.  uninstalled.  I hope it didn't leave anything troublesome behind
2010-01-21T08:44:00.000Z	tweaksource	Fezzler	Lemme check and see what I have running.
2010-01-21T08:45:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	may go ProTools soon with M-Box or Edirol Firewire and stay with Ardour/Reaper
2010-01-21T08:46:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	Either Mac or Vista
2010-01-21T08:47:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	but I really like Ardour, so I may go with Edirol unit - the seem to work well with Ubuntu
2010-01-21T08:48:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	spend money saved on a SM57
2010-01-21T08:48:00.000Z	tweaksource	Fezzler	I couldn't get anything to work correctly in Vista. $8000 of software/hardware and only half of it would even load!!!
2010-01-21T08:48:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	Even in XP compatibility mode?
2010-01-21T08:49:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	lmms and Reaper are very good too
2010-01-21T08:50:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	Also looking at an M-Audio Oxygen 61 mini controller/keyboard.  I think I need slide controls for channels
2010-01-21T08:58:00.000Z	Fezzler	tweaksource	but someone told me "knob" type controllers are cool - like the Apogee Duet
