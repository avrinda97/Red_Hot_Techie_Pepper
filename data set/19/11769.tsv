2007-08-12T16:31:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Hm. / has suddenly become a read only file system. dmesg says http://pastebin.com/d62595a12
2007-08-12T16:31:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Do I need to panic? :)
2007-08-12T16:31:00.000Z	DRMacIver		(And what do I need to do to fix this?)
2007-08-12T16:32:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	back up your data and if it is backed up reboot and see if fsck can help, you may however have a flaky disk needing replacement
2007-08-12T16:33:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	That's what I was afraid of... Thanks.
2007-08-12T05:09:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	ok, fsck seems to have repaired things without any noticable adverse effects.
2007-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Anything I should check other than being paranoid about backing up for the immediate future?
2007-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	I would back up, and repartition the drive, things like that always make me edge
2007-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	edgy
2007-08-12T05:12:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Well, I've backed up. I'll probably leave off repartitioning for now, though you're probably right that it's a good idea.
2007-08-12T05:13:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	and if anything happens again soon on that drive I would be looking at a new one
2007-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Thanks very much.
2007-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	you were as they say "very lucky" and in Disaster Recovery there is the phrase, you just had a disaster and you think you are going to get lucky :-)
2007-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Oh, I'm always lucky. ;) (kidding)
2007-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Mostly I'm lazy. I'll take steps to minimize potential consequences of that drive exploding and keep an eye on it. :)
2007-08-12T05:17:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	there is good lazy (sysadmin stuff) and bad lazy doing nothing
2007-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Mm. At any rate, it's past midnight over here. I'm certainly not repartitioning the drive *now* :)
2007-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	DRMacIver	ompaul	Anyway, thanks again. I'm going to vanish now. :)
2007-08-12T05:22:00.000Z	ompaul	DRMacIver	no problem
