2011-09-26T04:50:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	you need open sources.list and edit the line it said, change the ", I think

2011-09-26T05:05:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-09-26T05:06:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	 the " cause the prob here
2011-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	press down key until you get to line 52, I guess it's some where in the end
2011-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	delete the " before the deb
2011-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	yes, delete the " char , all of them
2011-09-26T05:10:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	yes

2011-09-26T05:14:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	did you press Ctrl + x to exit nano?
2011-09-26T05:14:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	you should do that, and run sudo apt-get update before check in Ubuntu Software Center
2011-09-26T05:17:00.000Z	Stanley00	marcuscrassus	after running apt-get update?
