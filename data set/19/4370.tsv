2009-06-12T00:10:00.000Z	yowshi		ok something is wierd. both gkrellm and ghnome-system-monitor are reporting 50-60% load on my processor which shouldnt be because i have almost nothing running but i cant see whats using all that power in tops nor my system monitor
2009-06-12T00:11:00.000Z	yowshi		what i see in my monitor adds up to less then 30%
2009-06-12T00:12:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	you are running gkrellm under X and with a display and window manager, are you SURE you are not running anything?
2009-06-12T00:13:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	i said almost nothing. other then gkrellms and a few other programmes IE pidgin evolution and the system basics i have nothing running. i ahve an e6600 here that nshouldnt be taking up 50% of my processor
2009-06-12T00:14:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	abnd nthat doesnt account for the fact that gnome-system-monitor doesnt show anything or cvombinmation of programmes eating up that processor power
2009-06-12T00:14:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	use top and see what it reports.  Keep in mind top is VERY minimal.
2009-06-12T00:17:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	VSpike htop reports something similiar. the numbers show higher in htop but nowhere near the 50-70% grellm and gnome-system-monitor is reporting
2009-06-12T00:18:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	VSpike hell even htop at the top of that there reports a 50-70% load but the numbers in cpu% dont add up to that
2009-06-12T00:19:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	neither top not htop really can tell you what is going on, if you actualy want to see the cpu stats install sar
2009-06-12T00:20:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	whats a sar and where do i get one?
2009-06-12T00:20:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	look up atsar
2009-06-12T00:25:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	sar is of no real use to me since i cant figure out how to use it
2009-06-12T00:28:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	its not too difficult to learn but if you really want to know what that cpu is doing you need something like sar to report it.  And you need to understand how a cpu accesses its devices.  Things like top will give a brief look into what is going on currently (ignore the load averages up top there just about useless).  And you need to know more about that cpu and what its spending its time doing. It is totally posible to make a cpu 100% busy and not have
2009-06-12T00:28:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	VSpike well i cant figure out what is cauing the load but it is interfering with my ability to use dosbox
2009-06-12T00:30:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	well then it is useless to me anyway since i have no clue about my cpu and how it spoends it time nor do i know how to find out how it uses it's time or how it accesses it's devices
2009-06-12T00:30:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	then you will spend allot of time chasing ghosts and trying to figure out the problem.
2009-06-12T00:31:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	that wasnt entirely useful
2009-06-12T00:31:00.000Z	yowshi	mdm	i already know my problems i need to know where to find the resources to help me fix them
2009-06-12T00:32:00.000Z	mdm	yowshi	 you are asking what makes my cpu so busy.  It was not readaily apparent from a list of running processes.  So your CPU is doing something.  Learning that somethign is a matter of knowing performance tuning and how your system operates.  For all I know it could be servicing memory
