2005-10-20T10:44:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	try system monitor
2005-11-02T10:05:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	I am seeing a pattern of k7 kernels and nvidia problems
2005-11-02T10:06:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	many threads going on the forums about same problem
2005-11-02T10:06:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	I'm on 686 kernel and nvidia is behaving
2005-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	thirso	mustard5	wierd
2005-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	thirso	mustard5	was is the nvidia driver updated?
2005-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	thirso	mustard5	was the nvidia driver updated?
2005-11-02T10:08:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	you might monitor the threads in the forum for solutions
2005-11-02T10:08:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	if it was I never updated
2005-11-02T10:08:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	I'm on latest nvidia 7667 drivers
2005-11-02T10:09:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	I downloaded them quite some time ago, I don't imagine they update old versions though I suppose
2005-11-02T10:09:00.000Z	thirso	mustard5	the error im getting is that the nvidia kernel version is 7174 and the X module is 7667
2005-11-02T10:10:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	perhaps its an issue with the k7 kernel, I would only be guessing though.
2005-11-02T10:10:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	I'm a bit of noob with linux :D
2005-11-02T10:10:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	I'm on AMD too
2005-11-02T10:10:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	just running 686 kernel
2005-11-02T10:11:00.000Z	thirso	mustard5	well guess ill just boot to kernel 386 and check the threads
2005-11-02T10:11:00.000Z	mustard5	thirso	whatever works is best :)
