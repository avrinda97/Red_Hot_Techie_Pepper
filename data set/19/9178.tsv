2006-12-16T06:03:00.000Z	Drako60	joeish	do you have libdvdcss installed from apt? and you don't want libdvdnav installed from apt it messes with mplayer for some reason
2006-12-16T06:03:00.000Z	joeish	Drako60	libdvdnav was not originally installed, libdvdcss is installed

2006-12-16T06:05:00.000Z	joeish	Drako60	in the gui i am rightclicking and selecting open....DVD
2006-12-16T06:05:00.000Z	Drako60	joeish	do you have more then one drive?
2006-12-16T06:05:00.000Z	joeish	Drako60	yes
2006-12-16T06:06:00.000Z	Drako60	joeish	open preferences and make sure the proper /dev line is in the dvd-device feild
2006-12-16T06:06:00.000Z	joeish	Drako60	but the other one is completely unresponsive (i think it is the drive)
2006-12-16T06:08:00.000Z	Drako60	joeish	try this command from terminal mplayer -vf lavcdeint -dvd-device /dev/cdrom0 dvd://1 (replace /dev/cdrom0 with the proper drive)
2006-12-16T06:10:00.000Z	joeish	Drako60	thanks a million....mplayer was pointing...well nothing (changed it to hdc and done!)
