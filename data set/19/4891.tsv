2008-10-17T17:32:00.000Z	redheat_		that's what it says
2008-10-17T17:33:00.000Z	redheat_		what you mean? I know what my wireless network adapter card is...
2008-10-17T17:34:00.000Z	redheat_		Action, I can't login to the wireless network..
2008-10-17T17:34:00.000Z	redheat_		did I say something? all I wondered about was why is he telling me about my wireless adapters name..don't need that..
2008-10-17T17:35:00.000Z	redheat_		the problem has to do with ubunt not enabling my wireless adapter to connect to my wireless network
2008-10-17T17:35:00.000Z	redheat_		I've already upgraded my  wireless adapter's firmware..
2008-10-17T17:37:00.000Z	redheat_		Action..

2008-10-17T17:39:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	yes we did. From what I can see you can't get your wifi adapter to connect to your ap
2008-10-17T19:10:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	most probably you'd extract the files from the .tar.gz file. Then complile the kernel module, which might require only the kernel headers, or the worst case, the entire new kernel.
2008-10-17T19:11:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	where did you get the driver from? paste the link
2008-10-17T19:13:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	which of those is yours ?
2008-10-17T19:14:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	hehe. well... it's still a young experience to have such things transfered from the developers to the users. Users are growing fast. Till late few botherd to make drivers abailable for linux. Allow the distros to catch up and incorporate the drivers by default, won't ya? :p
2008-10-17T19:20:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	From what I just saw, do exactly as the README says and you should be fine
2008-10-17T19:21:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	it's an usb wifi adapter ?
2008-10-17T19:21:00.000Z	Akhanu`	redheat_	oh. Never plaied with one of those.
