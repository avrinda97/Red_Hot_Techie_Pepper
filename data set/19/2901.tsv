2010-04-21T02:05:00.000Z	Consul_Falx		hello folks
2010-04-21T02:06:00.000Z	Consul_Falx		please, I just bought a Western Digital 070A external drive, preformatted NTFS + a virtual CD partition
2010-04-21T02:07:00.000Z	Consul_Falx		I'd like to reformat the main partition into fat32, so that it would be nicely compatible with linux for data writing as well
2010-04-21T02:09:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	if you are running linux check out fdisk
2010-04-21T02:28:00.000Z	Consul_Falx	boabsta	there is something weird with the GParted
2010-04-21T02:28:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	personally i dont like it - i prefer fdisk but i'm getting old
2010-04-21T02:29:00.000Z	Consul_Falx	boabsta	well, I just need to reformat the sdb1 to fat32, it's all I need
2010-04-21T02:29:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	open a terminal and type "fdisk /dev/sdb" then type "m"| for help
2010-04-21T02:33:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	onceyou have created/deleted partitions type "w" to save the partitions to your disk then type "mkdosfs -F 32 /dev/sdb1"
2010-04-21T02:33:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	you probably dont need fdisk/qparted at all actually
2010-04-21T02:36:00.000Z	Consul_Falx	boabsta	succeeded. yet I'd like to set up the volume's name if possible
2010-04-21T02:37:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	fdisk will do that, 2 secs
2010-04-21T02:39:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	hmm im not sure - dont usually bother with labels. m for help :)
2010-04-21T02:39:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	what do you mean by "label" exactly just to be sure?
2010-04-21T02:40:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	*name even
2010-04-21T02:41:00.000Z	Consul_Falx	boabsta	the name :) my flash disk is labeled vladuj-data and hence it's defaultly mounted into /media/vladuj-data/
2010-04-21T02:43:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	mounts after UUID? not sure what you mean, specifying UUID in fstab doesnt work?
2010-04-21T02:45:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	do you know the UUID?
2010-04-21T02:48:00.000Z	boabsta	Consul_Falx	np
