2012-01-28T06:26:00.000Z	jmscomtech		u installed a very old driver
2012-01-28T06:27:00.000Z	jmscomtech		ben64 no it dopesnt as nuveua is used and hasnt been disabled u get stack at the purple screen which glitchs
2012-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	jmscomtech		its happend to me once and i learnt my lesson
2012-01-28T06:28:00.000Z	jmscomtech		um noahnoah what happens when u hit alt+f1 or f4?
2012-01-28T06:30:00.000Z	jmscomtech		ben64: its because in xorg its trying to use both nuveua and the nvidia drivers at same time, if installed the correct way it disables and correctly installs the drivers for nvidia, but nuveua has to be disabled before the nvidia drivers get installed or xorg will forever look up nuveua
2012-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	jmscomtech		yeah happens when u try out stuff
2012-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	jmscomtech		never apt-get the drivers allways activate the hardware recomended
2012-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	jmscomtech		its one lesson i learnt the hardway
2012-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	glosoli	jmscomtech	So that means that most of the time you activate quite out dated drivers, if you use ATI
2012-01-28T06:35:00.000Z	glosoli	jmscomtech	Ah, sorry, my mistake

2012-01-28T06:40:00.000Z	jmscomtech	glosoli	tint2 is a minimal bottom bar that allows u to see whats open
2012-01-28T06:40:00.000Z	glosoli	jmscomtech	Gnome Shell ?
2012-01-28T06:41:00.000Z	glosoli	jmscomtech	Sorry for oftopic, never heard of it, do you think it is worth trying ?
