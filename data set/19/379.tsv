2012-04-05T21:59:00.000Z	scarykitties		For instance, early on, I get an I/O error that says it cannot write files to a disk
2012-04-05T21:59:00.000Z	scarykitties		This is doing a clean install with everything being cleared out and going Ubuntu's default.
2012-04-05T21:59:00.000Z	scarykitties		I don't think it would be the HDD that is broken because the HDD worked mere hours ago.
2012-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	scarykitties		Is it probable that it is the DVD drive?
2012-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	scarykitties		It stops the process
2012-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	scarykitties		"The installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk"
2012-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	scarykitties		Which certainly suggests an HDD problem, but the note says that it could be the DVD drive
2012-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	scarykitties		And it's hard for me to believe that the HDD would just die all of a sudden.
2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	scarykitties		It was working with Windows 7 just 8 hours ago.
2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	scarykitties		I do, wylde
2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	but hdd do just die all of a sudden, thats how they go out
2012-04-05T22:02:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	what type of errors do you get when installing?
2012-04-05T22:05:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	i would take the drive out of your computer. and throw it against the wall. thats the only thing i know to do. if that dont make it work. then you need a new one
2012-04-05T22:06:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	with that said then. i would listen to see if its spinning. you should be able to hear it
2012-04-05T22:12:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	check for bit versino
2012-04-05T22:16:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	to know for sure. i would take it out, put it in another computer, mount it. then try to format it to ext3. if that works. the drive is good
2012-04-05T22:21:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	do you actually have your dvd hooked up to the mobo by sata? ;)
2012-04-05T22:35:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	if it worked this time, and not every other time. and you did nothing different, then that sounds even more like the hdd has failed
2012-04-05T22:47:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	scarykitties	what tool is that you are using? looks nice
