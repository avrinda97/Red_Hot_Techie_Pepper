2007-07-26T15:25:00.000Z	raf256		it took several hours with help of meany people (thanks)
2007-07-26T15:25:00.000Z	raf256		and still we are unable to reinstall apache2
2007-07-26T15:26:00.000Z	raf256		on a fresh 7.04
2007-07-26T15:26:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	what problem ar eyou having?
2007-07-26T15:26:00.000Z	raf256	JosefK	I delted /etc/apache2 and now I can reinstall apache2
2007-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	and now you "can" or now you "can't"? If you can, I don't see how that's a problem
2007-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	raf256	JosefK	I cant
2007-07-26T15:28:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	what commands have you already tried to reinstall it?
2007-07-26T15:29:00.000Z	raf256	JosefK	aptitude install apache2 - it fails because It cant find /etc/apache2
2007-07-26T15:30:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	what does "dpkg -s apache2 | grep Status" say?
2007-07-26T15:30:00.000Z	raf256	JosefK	g2g, bbl.. thanks
2007-07-26T15:31:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	hmm, fine, there are a few ways to fix it if you're on later
2007-07-26T15:36:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	did that work for you?
2007-07-26T15:34:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	in case you come back later, and with the usual caveats that dpkg --force-* is baad, mm'kay
2007-07-26T15:35:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	dpkg --force-confmiss -r apache2
2007-07-26T15:35:00.000Z	JosefK	raf256	and then just reinstall apache2 and be more careful next time.
2007-07-26T15:35:00.000Z	raf256	JosefK	ok trying that
2007-07-26T15:36:00.000Z	raf256	JosefK	why is it so terribly not intuitiall O_o
