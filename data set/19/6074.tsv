2008-03-31T21:52:00.000Z	Lainy		I'm trying to uninstall a program Irssi. Where do I type 'make uninstall' (in the source folder? where is that?) Thanks for any help.
2008-03-31T21:52:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	did you install irssi from source?
2008-03-31T21:52:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Yes
2008-03-31T21:52:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	do you still have the source folder?
2008-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	err, directory**
2008-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	I don't remember deleting it.
2008-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Is the source folder the tar I untarred?
2008-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	yes
2008-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Oh no, I deleted that
2008-03-31T21:54:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	How do I manually uninstall it, or is it safe to reinstall it via apt-get (I just found a source link to install it via apt-get)?
2008-03-31T21:54:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	well, then the only way to attempt a make install is to download the source again, compile it but dont install it (via 'make install'), then issue a 'make uninstall'
2008-03-31T21:55:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	DRebellion: Okay, thanks.
2008-03-31T21:55:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	if you ever compile from source, you must build a .deb file so apt can remove it later .. otherwise it's a headache
2008-03-31T21:55:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Okay, I will look into that, thanks.
2008-03-31T22:03:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Is there any other way to uninstall the program? I unpacked the same .tar in the same directory, but I cannot make uninstall (make: *** No rule to make target 'uninstall'. Stop.). Thanks.
2008-03-31T22:05:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	you probably need to run ./configure (and whatever else README/INSTALL tells you to do) and make before the uninstall target can be used -- again, there is no guarantee that you can run a 'make uninstall' not all makefiles support it
2008-03-31T22:06:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Thank you, that worked!
2008-03-31T22:07:00.000Z	unop	Lainy	try and not build from source unless absolutely necessary -- if ever you do, use the ubuntu sources and always build a .deb
2008-03-31T22:07:00.000Z	Lainy	unop	Alright, thanks again.
