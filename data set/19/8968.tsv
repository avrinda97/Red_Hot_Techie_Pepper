2007-01-14T13:42:00.000Z	riotkittie		my ubuntu partition's like 3gb. but if you have more space, you might want to add it ;p
2007-01-14T13:43:00.000Z	riotkittie		try slackware, bartist :D
2007-01-14T13:44:00.000Z	riotkittie		hiya CyberCod
2007-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	riotkittie		ehhh. i need a nice, small distro with a decent package manager and overflowing repos
2007-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	May I point you to Xubuntu?
2007-01-14T13:46:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	uh. no. xubuntu does not qualify as small.
2007-01-14T13:47:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	i'm pretty much out of luck everywhere. :P
2007-01-14T13:47:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	define "small".
2007-01-14T13:49:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	to paraphrase ...  i cant tell you what small is, but i know it when i see it.  :P  zenwalk is kind of small ...  1.4gb
2007-01-14T13:51:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	And what makes small so attractive to you, riotkittie?
2007-01-14T13:52:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	for starters,  i have an 11,2gb hard drive :P
2007-01-14T13:53:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	I use 10GB partiitons for my testbed and am wasting over 75% of each partition's space with Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu.
2007-01-14T13:54:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	My wife uses a 10GB partition for Ubuntu *WITH* extra software installed and hasn't run out of room yet.
2007-01-14T13:54:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	im sure that with dapper alone, i'd have no issues
2007-01-14T13:54:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	have you thought about upgrading the hard drive then?  :)
2007-01-14T13:56:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	yeah, i'm going to get a new drive eventually.
2007-01-14T14:00:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	you don't need a new laptop.  Laptop hard disks can be upgraded.  I upgraded mine from 40GB to 100GB, for instance, at a tiny fraction of the price of a new laptop.
2007-01-14T14:01:00.000Z	riotkittie	ttmrichter	i know laptop drives can be upgraded, but i /want/ a new laptop
2007-01-14T14:01:00.000Z	ttmrichter	riotkittie	Well, that's a different story then.  :)
