2009-09-08T05:10:00.000Z	Random774		hey is this were I can get tech support
2009-09-08T05:11:00.000Z	Random774		sweet. I just uninstalled Ubuntu, but now by computer won't boot Windows Vista. I'm using the LiveCD session to get some help on the matter.
2009-09-08T05:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	I guess for some reason Vista didn't get added to   menu.lst     gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst and you can add it in yourself, if it's not there
2009-09-08T05:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	there's a example for how you add Windows
2009-09-08T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	by the way with enough RAM, and depending on what you want to do,  you could just virtual machine  Ubuntu inside Windows for that,  also  your programs might work well in Wine that you want to run
2009-09-08T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	uh above,  virtual machine Windows inside Ubuntu
2009-09-08T05:23:00.000Z	Random774	sebsebseb	where? "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst" seemed to open a text based screen. sorry, but i'm really confused..
2009-09-08T05:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	ok instead of  lst put list
2009-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	Random774	sebsebseb	ok, so what do I type in the new scrren
2009-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	has it opended up the menu.lst file?
2009-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	it should have come up with stuff
2009-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	ok  ##  or # is commented
2009-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	it doesn't use the stuff that's commented
2009-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	 there's an example for adding Windows, and with the Ubuntu kernel and that,  you  can add it
2009-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	of course  your set up may vary a little from the example, depending on which partition Windows is on, but  hd0,0  is the first hard disk  and the first partition,  where as hd1,0  would be the second hard disk  and the first partition
2009-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	Random774	sebsebseb	i'm probably driving you nuts, but the page it opened is simply a blank page titled "menu.list (/boot/brub) -gedit"
2009-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	hmm  maybe you don't have Grub on there at all
2009-09-08T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	so this does not work at all?   gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2009-09-08T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Random774	Grub should be on there, unless you told it not to install
