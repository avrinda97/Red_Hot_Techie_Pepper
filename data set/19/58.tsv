2012-10-26T12:55:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	yes
2012-10-26T12:56:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	i couldn't reconfigure your problem
2012-10-26T12:57:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	man a func ,but the man-doc not installed
2012-10-26T12:58:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	i don't know about setupterm command ..maybe i miss or nothing there
2012-10-26T12:59:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	it is not a command , it is : 3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
2012-10-26T13:00:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	setupterm is not : 1   Executable programs or shell commands
2012-10-26T13:00:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	try with man -k setupterm to search
2012-10-26T13:01:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	It must install xxx-doc first to use man -k xxx
2012-10-26T13:02:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	look at man2
2012-10-26T13:02:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	if i'm not wrong, cmiiw, thats for manual of library calls
2012-10-26T13:03:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	yes, it is library calls
2012-10-26T13:03:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	example: sudo apt-get install manpages-posix-dev
2012-10-26T13:05:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	usually,manual doc for a lot of system calls was installed by default
2012-10-26T13:06:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	but I install ubuntu server only, how to find the package which I need install : example sudo apt-get install glibc-doc
2012-10-26T13:08:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	I got it : apt-file search setupterm ,thanks .
2012-10-26T13:10:00.000Z	vchi	blackshirt	ncurses-doc: /usr/share/man/man3/setupterm.3ncurses.gz
2012-10-26T13:12:00.000Z	blackshirt	vchi	sorry, i'm wrong...man 2 was for system call, and man3 was for library calls manual
