2006-07-05T08:25:00.000Z	EnsilZah		Question - How do i get ubuntu to re-recognize my GPU?
2006-07-05T08:25:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	sudp dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-07-05T08:26:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	Wouldn't that make me reconfigure all the outher hardware as well?
2006-07-05T08:26:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	no
2006-07-05T08:27:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	I'm asking that because i did that once and it asked me about my keyboard and such...
2006-07-05T08:27:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	yes, but not _all_ your hardware
2006-07-05T08:28:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	you could also manually edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-07-05T08:29:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	I'm trying to get my GPU re-recognized after flashing its BIOS, any suggestions for the best way to do that?
2006-07-05T08:29:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	what makes you think it's not "recognized"?  And what do you mean by that?
2006-07-05T08:31:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	Well, it listed as a different type of GPU, i have a GeForce 6600 AGP  and it was listed as GeForce Go 6600 GT PCI-E, i flashed the card which should enable me to install the nVidia drivers, but it doesn't so i'm guessing it still thinks it's the old one.
2006-07-05T08:32:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	listed it where?
2006-07-05T08:34:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	Well, in windows, i just read a thread by a guy who had similar hardware...
2006-07-05T08:34:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	but are you having an issue with it in ubuntu?
2006-07-05T08:35:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	The issue i'm having is that i can't get the nVidia driver to work on ubuntu and flashing the drive should have solved that.
2006-07-05T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	which nvidia drivers are you using?  ubuntu packaged ones?
2006-07-05T08:37:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	I tried several, the one from the nvidia pages, the nvidia-glx thing from Synaptic Package Manager, the guides by that Itallian fellow who's name i can't recall at the moment.
2006-07-05T08:38:00.000Z	tritium	EnsilZah	you're best off using the wiki page for guidance, and using ubuntu  packaged drivers
2006-07-05T08:40:00.000Z	EnsilZah	tritium	I've tried all those, i think it's just the assholes that manufactured the card saved time by using the same bios for their whole 6600 series.   I think i'll just try reinstalling ubuntu.
