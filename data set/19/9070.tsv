2006-12-31T07:31:00.000Z	Derek		does anyone have any suggestions on what could be wrong with my computer that's causing it to go black screen after ubuntu loads?
2006-12-31T07:31:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	you have an LCD monitor?
2006-12-31T07:33:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	after installation: 1st-recovery mode (second option in Grub menu), 2nd-install ati driver, 3rd- dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-12-31T07:37:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	you're on the live cd?
2006-12-31T07:38:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	put your livecd, boot, before selecting the boot option (on the boot menu) do F4, select the graphic mode you want
2006-12-31T07:39:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	use the resolution that is shown on your montinor manual
2006-12-31T07:41:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	did you select the correct frequency?
2006-12-31T07:42:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	frequencies are important,
2006-12-31T07:42:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	i'm on 70
2006-12-31T07:42:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	you'll see the frequency after an '@'
2006-12-31T07:44:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	try again :)
2006-12-31T07:50:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	alternate is the best solution
2006-12-31T08:11:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	the alternate CD is the only solution for you problem :)
2006-12-31T08:12:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	there are already tutorials for that :)
2006-12-31T08:13:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	on the ubuntu download page
2006-12-31T08:38:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	386
2006-12-31T08:38:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	i'm not sure it supports the 686
2006-12-31T08:40:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	good luck
2006-12-31T08:48:00.000Z	_TsU_	Derek	it has nothing to do with the OS :)
