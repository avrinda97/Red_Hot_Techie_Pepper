2011-08-05T14:42:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	What are you having issues with?
2011-08-05T14:43:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	Got following line in FSTAB file and it works. Just don't have write access to share.
2011-08-05T14:44:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	Add rw past the password section.
2011-08-05T14:44:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	And don't forget your 0 0's.
2011-08-05T14:44:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	so password=***,rw
2011-08-05T14:44:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	Should work just fine.
2011-08-05T14:45:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	nope, i did try that, but when i right click I don't get create folder etc...
2011-08-05T14:45:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	Okay, then it seems like it's a permissions issue. Lemme look up cifs.
2011-08-05T14:46:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	thanks
2011-08-05T14:47:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	Does this apply to you? http://lists.samba.org/archive/linux-cifs-client/2006-November/001590.html
2011-08-05T14:48:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	reading it now
2011-08-05T14:50:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	my password in ubuntu and windows are the same.  The windows PC is a Windows 2008 R2 Server (Domain)
2011-08-05T14:50:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	It's still a cifs share.
2011-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	I don't know. I just googled your issue, and came to this. It looks like adding noperm to the args section of the mount would solve your issues...But I don't know.
2011-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	All of my samba stuff is RW/usr out of the box.
2011-08-05T14:53:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	top man. It's done
2011-08-05T14:53:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	Did it solve your issue?
2011-08-05T14:54:00.000Z	kyle_	OmegaForte	If my ubuntu password was not the same as windows, Would it not work or something??  --- Yes it seems to be working fine..
2011-08-05T14:54:00.000Z	OmegaForte	kyle_	That's not the issue...The issue would be that the unix/linux permissions are not compatable with NTFS/CIFS permissions.
