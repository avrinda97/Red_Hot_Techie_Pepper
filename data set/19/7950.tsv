2007-11-24T01:46:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	apt in itself is not a command.
2007-11-24T01:46:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	yeah how about apt dependency
2007-11-24T01:47:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	i mean apt depends
2007-11-24T01:47:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	??
2007-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	nope.. never heard of it.. my mistake sorry
2007-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	try typing apt into a linux install
2007-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	I try not to sound rude but I'm sure exactly what you're trying to achieve..
2007-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	you do or dont know
2007-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	type *not* sure. what would you like to do?
2007-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	typo _shit_
2007-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	im not really trying to acheive anything except get answers
2007-11-24T01:52:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	I mean what would you like to do? install a package?
2007-11-24T01:52:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	no i want to use the command apt depends which maps out software dependencies
2007-11-24T01:53:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	and i know to install software i can just type apt-get install
2007-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	_nix_	blahblahx	glad you got ur answer..
2007-11-24T01:55:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	actually i got half of it because apt depends is a real command. but thanks, honestly.
2007-11-24T01:55:00.000Z	blahblahx	_nix_	oh and one more for you. how do i add the action for nautilus to delete files and folders?
