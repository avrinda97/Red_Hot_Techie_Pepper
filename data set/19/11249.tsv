2006-03-04T15:02:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		I want to setup my computer before I go to bed so I can play with Linux remotely when I'm supposed to be doing work :P
2006-03-04T15:03:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Will I be able to telnet into my computer by default, or do I need to turn on?
2006-03-04T15:04:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Is that in the inetd file I hear so much about?
2006-03-04T15:04:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Ahh, ty, ty - good point.  Even on windows I had an ssh client
