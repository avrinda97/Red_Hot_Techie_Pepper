2005-08-08T13:16:00.000Z	Razor-X		anywhere from 1-4 weeks, IIRC
2005-08-08T13:16:00.000Z	Razor-X		are you using Kubunut?
2005-08-08T13:16:00.000Z	Razor-X		s/Kubunut/Kubuntu/
2005-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	Razor-X		i've modded my box so heavily, XFce refuses to work ;)
2005-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	Razor-X		as does Fluxbox
2005-08-08T13:18:00.000Z	Razor-X		Eterm is nicer, though
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	Razor-X		this _is_ my working space, I have to have it so that my eyes don't go bad from staring at the Terminal
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	Razor-X		with screen, tabs are useless
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	nonsense
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	reisio	in the Terminal, i'ld think so
2005-08-08T13:21:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	tabs are nice
2005-08-08T13:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	reisio	what are it's advantages over screen?
2005-08-08T13:22:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	sameness with all my other GUIs
2005-08-08T13:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	reisio	oh, you care about the tab actually being there in the GUI?
2005-08-08T13:22:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	firefox, xchat, terminal - all have tabs, top left to right
2005-08-08T13:22:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	well what else is the point of a tab :p
2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	I have very good reasons to use X, the tabs are just a perk
2005-08-08T13:43:00.000Z	reisio	Razor-X	hopefully we'll have something better than Linux by then
2005-08-08T13:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	reisio	possibly
