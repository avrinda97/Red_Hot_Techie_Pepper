2010-12-18T15:56:00.000Z	bonjoyee		Tuplad:install ext3 drivers on windows...
2010-12-18T15:57:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	did, but I still can't view the drives. I got as far as viewing my external hard drive, but now that doesn't work either since I've got myself a new drive :/
2010-12-18T15:58:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Tuplad	sure the drives formatted ext3?
2010-12-18T15:58:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	positive, always been!
2010-12-18T15:58:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	disk internals linux reader SEES the drive, but can't open it.
2010-12-18T15:59:00.000Z	bonjoyee		randy_:what cd do you want to run?
2010-12-18T15:59:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	the other drives are labeled as "local drive (X:)" etc., when I double click I get "drive is empty, format ?"
2010-12-18T16:00:00.000Z	bonjoyee		Tuplad:so you had this thing working earlier with other drive>
2010-12-18T16:00:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	yes, only the external drive
2010-12-18T16:01:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Tuplad	do sudo fdisk -l for both the drives..and check if the results are identical..
2010-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	crap... I don't have the other drive. which results should I look for ? I've bought myself a bigger drive of an other brand. I always format my drives ext3.
2010-12-18T16:03:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Tuplad	the last column...that identifies the filesystem type
2010-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	"Linux" it is
2010-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Tuplad	 and id?
2010-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	83
2010-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	I've got an idea! I just checked the disk rights and only "owner" had read/write rights. I set read rights for others, let's try again :D ?
2010-12-18T16:05:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Tuplad	never used ext3 under windows..so dont know if it honors the file permissions
2010-12-18T16:05:00.000Z	Tuplad	bonjoyee	I'll try it out in a moment
