2011-11-18T03:02:00.000Z	xruud		Can someone help me with my laptop that wont shutdown when I click shutdown?
2011-11-18T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	if you run:  sudo shutdown -h now    does it die?
2011-11-18T03:03:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	yes, that is my temp fix :P
2011-11-18T03:04:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	I want it to just shutdown using the gui buttons. Instead it logs me out
2011-11-18T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	just checking, its good to test
2011-11-18T03:07:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	I think it is a rights issue
2011-11-18T03:08:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	but even when logged out, the menu there will not shutdown the machine either
2011-11-18T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	try: gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/halt   and add: rmmod snd-hda-intel
2011-11-18T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	add it below the line: ### END INIT INFO

2011-11-18T03:15:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	This did not work. It also seemes to have reset unity or something as my bar on the left is now back to default
2011-11-18T03:15:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	I'm having multiple issues anyway; I also have to fill in my password everywhere I need to twice, always. The first time is ignored even if I use a wrong pwd
2011-11-18T03:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	editing that file will not change unity in any way
2011-11-18T03:17:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	I did not expect it to, perhaps it was me shutting down the laptop with the pwr button. In any case, it did not solde the problem
2011-11-21T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	how fast is your web connection? Are you installing to an SSD? How fast is your cpu?
2011-11-21T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	minimal is the daddy :-)
2011-11-21T12:53:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	It sure is nice and minimal. But I'm not quite ready yet
2011-11-21T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xruud	as long as LAN works then install the desktop with apt-get. Its groovy
2011-11-21T12:59:00.000Z	xruud	ActionParsnip	I'm doing that, but it is a nearly endless list of packages (835). I can't figure out the order, so for now I suppose I must be patient
