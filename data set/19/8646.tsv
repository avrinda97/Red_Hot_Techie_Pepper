2007-02-28T11:45:00.000Z	duryodhan		How do I make a Ubuntu LiveUSB from the LiveCD image?
2007-02-28T11:46:00.000Z	duryodhan		Infact I have already managed to make it to boot using the extlinux system from syslinux package
2007-02-28T11:46:00.000Z	duryodhan		but its hangin ...

2007-02-28T11:49:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	ya ... but thats for installing ... I alread y have a linux , I just want to make the LiveCD to a LiveUSB.
2007-02-28T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	duryodhan	Right, that instruction will put the liveCD on the USB, and make it bootable, so you'll boot to a live environment from the USB.  Regardless of whether you choose to install
2007-02-28T11:52:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	ya but I dont want to type something everytime ... thats something I tried... I had used syslinux and got stuck there and that solution came to me . But waht I am asking is ... I edited the isolinux.cfg , renamed it to extlinux.conf , and edited it properly .. just changed something like /cdrom/preseed to /preseed .... shouldn't it work now ??
2007-02-28T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	duryodhan	I don't know what you need to type everytime
2007-02-28T11:54:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	the whole symlinkin /dev/sdb1 to my /cdrom
2007-02-28T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	duryodhan	You could edit the boot script to do that automatically
2007-02-28T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	duryodhan	I don't see why it would, no.
2007-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	k thanks
2007-02-28T12:21:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	its giving me error . "tty not found . Job Control turned off"
2007-02-28T12:23:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	not an error like CDROM not found. This error I am not able to understand
2007-02-28T12:29:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	the link you gave me for the guide is almost certainly wrong in 1 respect.. can you correct the wiki?
2007-02-28T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	duryodhan	er... What's wrong about it?
2007-02-28T12:30:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	see the subheadings Move files to the root directory and Editing SYSLINUX.CFG
2007-02-28T12:31:00.000Z	duryodhan	Flannel	stupid autoid completion- I sent a msg to flamesrock above my previous msg .. did you read that one ?
