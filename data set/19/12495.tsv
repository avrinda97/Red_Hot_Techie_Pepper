2006-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	Zaph		I would like to stay using Linux, but if it keeps like this, I will be forced to move back to windows..
2006-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	Zaph		another problem also...OpenOffice.org is really slow? will getting XFCE help?
2006-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	Zaph		0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp. 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)
2006-06-26T16:36:00.000Z	Zaph		so... can my problem be solved?
2006-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	Zaph		ok.. I'm gonna try xubuntu.. busy installing it now.
2006-06-26T16:38:00.000Z	Zaph		but if it does not work, then I suppose I'll have to get rid of Linux for now...
2006-06-26T16:38:00.000Z	Zaph		hopefully it will work for me..
2006-06-26T16:38:00.000Z	Zaph		thanks alot guys..
2006-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	Zaph		it runs... but just not that fast.. like loading apps takes long..
2006-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	Zaph		what other options have I got to read exec and word documents besides OpenOffice.Org?
2006-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	gnumeric and abiword or koffice
2006-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	and yes, openoffice is a memory hog
2006-06-26T16:40:00.000Z	Zaph	mjr	do they run better than openoffice?
2006-06-26T16:40:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	they should, in limited memory.
2006-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	I'm more an abiword/gnumeric guy, since I'm a gnome person. Koffice is for KDE, but you can try that as well.
2006-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	you mean "excel", and no, since it's a word processor. Gnumeric is a spreadsheet.
2006-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	and btw, I don't think you should be forced to move to xfce with your memory; try just changing the office programs first and see if that helps
2006-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	as said, openoffice is probably the thing sucking up most of your memory :] 
2006-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	mjr	Zaph	no, you can have them all installed at once if hd space is not an issue
