2006-05-21T09:30:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	dunno :/ All I know is that gksudo is useful for in menu and stuff.
2006-05-21T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	gksudo sets the home dir to roots, but preserves all the same stuff otherwise that sudo -s does
2006-05-21T09:32:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	and displays that nice windows to type your password.
2006-05-21T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	file mask and directory mask
2006-05-21T09:40:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	ok. why do you need different permissions for files and folders?
2006-05-21T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	cuz directories need executable bits, files don't
2006-05-21T09:40:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	ok. Good to know.
2006-05-21T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	you can also give groups permissions to write to a fat32 using that (I do that for shared files between users)
2006-05-21T09:42:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	doesn't gid= do the same.. oh, right. fat32 doesn't handle permissions well.
2006-05-21T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	exactly, but you can specify group write in the fstab :)
2006-05-21T10:44:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	lol
2006-05-21T10:45:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	it's logged as 'dapper'
2006-05-21T11:09:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	you need to change that a bit
2006-05-21T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	I was kinda hoping it would get ignored, it's my only hope :)
2006-05-21T11:10:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	:)
2006-05-21T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	been there, been embarassed, got over it. Well, a beer helps
2006-05-21T11:12:00.000Z	samuli	nickrud	I'm sort of not following.
2006-05-21T11:13:00.000Z	nickrud	samuli	trust me, if you spend any time here, you will get punked. It's a condition, not a state
