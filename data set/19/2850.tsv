2010-06-19T16:37:00.000Z	moody		started installing ubuntu on my PC and something went wrong hardware wise...computer won't turn on!  the light on the power source turns on, then right back off, then nothing.  after this, i have to unplug it and plug it back in to get the same result... but still won't start up.  did my power source blow, or did my motherboard fry?
2010-06-19T16:37:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	that sounds bad
2010-06-19T16:37:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	yeah... its definitely not good!  lol
2010-06-19T16:38:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	by pulling the CMOS bat?
2010-06-19T16:39:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	Optikn3rv, thanks for the suggestions... will try tonight.  If these suggestions don't work, would you say its the power source or the mobo?
2010-06-19T16:39:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	thats impossible to determine from the info you gave
2010-06-19T16:40:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	Optikn3rv, roger that.  thanks guys.
2010-06-19T17:21:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	you still around?
2010-06-19T17:21:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	yes
2010-06-19T17:22:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	no, i'm at work... i'm gonna try it tonight.  but i was just looking back over what you guys recommended, and i'm not quite sure what you mean by "earthing" the pc... was hoping you could elaborate a bit. and i don't think i have a radiator pipe in my home...
2010-06-19T17:23:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	US
2010-06-19T17:25:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	oh, in that case, it may already be earthed... i haven't touched it in about two weeks.  ever since i had the problem, i've been using strictly my laptop
2010-06-19T17:26:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	well then its unessesary
2010-06-19T17:26:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	so I should just try resetting the BIOS?
2010-06-19T17:27:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	thats the first thing I would do yes - do you have an alternative PSU at home?
2010-06-19T17:27:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	nope, i was gonna buy one if all else failed... i'm on a pretty limited budget right now :)
2010-06-19T17:28:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	well if resetting the bios wont help it (which i assume it doesnt) i suggest you get a new PSU (or just borrow one to try it out)
2010-06-19T17:29:00.000Z	moody	ManDay	ok, thanks again for the help :)  will try your suggestions tonight
2010-06-19T17:30:00.000Z	ManDay	moody	yw
