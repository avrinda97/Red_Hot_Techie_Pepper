2007-09-17T06:19:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	what error?
2007-09-17T06:20:00.000Z	Cinnabun		It tells me that boot file not found
2007-09-17T06:20:00.000Z	Cinnabun		or Boot name
2007-09-17T06:21:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	can you give me a verbatim message? word for word.  right now it sounds like a bad burn
2007-09-17T06:21:00.000Z	Cinnabun		Alright, I'll be right back, getting it verbatim.
2007-09-17T06:29:00.000Z	Cinnabun		I'm back, it was Boot filename not recieved. If you're still in here/
2007-09-17T06:31:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	that's after you run the cd?
2007-09-17T06:31:00.000Z	Cinnabun		No, if I run it in windows it works fine but to install it I have to boot from it, and that is when I get the message
2007-09-17T06:33:00.000Z	Cinnabun		Frostburn, No, if I run it in windows it works fine but to install it I have to boot from it, and that is when I get the message
2007-09-17T06:34:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	so it's not installed, its just booting from the cd
2007-09-17T06:34:00.000Z	Cinnabun		Frostburn, It's not doing either. I would like to install it instead of just booting from the cd, but I do not know how to do that.
2007-09-17T06:35:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	so you are able to get to an ubuntu desktop with the cd, but after the install, it doesn't work?
2007-09-17T06:37:00.000Z	Cinnabun	frostburn	you're quite a few steps ahead of me. Unless I am in windows, where the disc has only the option to isntall some programs such as firefox and not the OS itself (at least that I can see), I cannot even get anything ubuntu-related to happen (when I try to boot from the disc).
2007-09-17T06:38:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	from what i've seen, it might be a hardware problem
2007-09-17T06:40:00.000Z	Cinnabun		Frost, anything off the top of your head that could be screwing things up? It's a core2duo system with a 7600gt nvidia card, pheonix mobo (don't know ID) and 2gb ram... dunno what else would affect it not booting
2007-09-17T06:41:00.000Z	frostburn	Cinnabun	you also might want to check out the ubuntu forums for your specific hardware to see if there's any quirks.  From weird boot errors that I get, I find burning the cd slower helps.
