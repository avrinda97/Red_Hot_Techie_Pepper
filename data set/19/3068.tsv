2011-04-13T07:29:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	ok, type this into terminal: sudo apt-get install -f (it will ask for your password most likely)
2011-04-13T07:31:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	ok, now attempt to do what didn't work before.
2011-04-13T07:33:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	it shure sounds like it.

2011-04-13T07:39:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	let me see what i can find out about on that error.
2011-04-13T07:44:00.000Z	noobguy	hylian	can i send you full error log ??
2011-04-13T07:45:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	your problem somehow is still broken packages, i would fire up synaptic, and have it do a rfepair on broken packages and see what it gives youy for idea/errors.
2011-04-13T07:46:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	sorry, i somehow lost your request, i yiy yiy.
2011-04-13T07:53:00.000Z	noobguy	hylian	any idea?
2011-04-13T07:53:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	sorry man. ok from what i pieced together, it looks like you recieved a package that is damaged. you may have to go to /var/cache/apt/archives and remove the package, as well as removing it from /var/lib/dpkg/info, however, if this is somehow being caused by a bad net connection, like a damaged wire, it may happen all over again.
2011-04-13T07:57:00.000Z	hylian	noobguy	i hope it helps, as for being grand, my kind of computer repair is less than pretty, usually functional, but not so pretty.
