2008-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	tiredbones		 this command "sudo dpkg -i smplayer_0.5.42-1~getdeb1_amd64.deb" gave me this error  package architecture (amd64) does not match system (i386). my system is a amd64.
2008-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	paste the output of uname -a
2008-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	Linux wayne-desktop 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Tue Dec 18 08:02:57 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
2008-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	you aren't running a 64bit version of ubuntu...hence the package you are installing is failing. its for a 64bit version of ubuntu
2008-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	I have a 64 bit machine.
2008-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	yes, i understood that but you are running the 32bit version of ubuntu. This means the binary files(i.e. executables) are compiled for a 32bit processor...you cannot run a 64bit binary on a 32bit system. Your 64bit system is running a 32bit version of ubuntu
2008-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	just get the i386 version of the file from wherever you got the 64bit one from and install that
2008-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	how can that be, I download and install ubuntu 7-10 for amd64 three or four days ago and have been doing updates.
2008-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	see the i686 bit from the uname -a output you posted...that means you are running the 32bit version
2008-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	I'm going to boot my system now and see what that reports.
2008-01-01T03:45:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	is there anyway to tell what image i have on the cd i burnt?
2008-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	the cd should have a .disk folder on the root of it, which has a file called "info" which tells you what release of ubuntu that cd is
2008-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	 I don't believe I did that. I thought sure I had amd64.
2008-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	whats the output of that file then?
2008-01-01T03:51:00.000Z	thingy	tiredbones	Ubuntu 7.10 "Gutsy Gibbon" - Release i386 (20071016) <-- ?
2008-01-01T03:51:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	 It show I have i386!!!!!!!
2008-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	it doesn't have the Gibbons, just Gusty. otherwise everything is the same.
2008-01-01T03:55:00.000Z	tiredbones	thingy	I guess I have to get the amd64 version. thanks for your help.
