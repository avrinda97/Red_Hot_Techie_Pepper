2011-08-14T20:56:00.000Z	edbian	dougl	what do you mean 'unity' is disabled. Can you be more explicit about what is missing
2011-08-14T20:58:00.000Z	dougl	edbian	enabling cube disable desktop wall that unity depended on so now unity is disabled,
2011-08-14T20:58:00.000Z	edbian	dougl	I was confused about what you meant by 'unity'
