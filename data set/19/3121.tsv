2009-11-19T23:06:00.000Z	DareDevil0		There should be a conf problem
2009-11-19T23:07:00.000Z	flan_suse	DareDevil0	what error are you getting?
2009-11-19T23:08:00.000Z	DareDevil0		In the Windows host: The session can not initiate from this host your account is not authorized
2009-11-19T23:09:00.000Z	DareDevil0		In the Windows host the error is: The session can not initiate from this host your account is not authorized
2009-11-19T23:09:00.000Z	flan_suse	DareDevil0	and you made sure username and password are correct?
2009-11-19T23:09:00.000Z	DareDevil0		flan_suse,
2009-11-19T23:10:00.000Z	DareDevil0		i can't enter the username and password because when i try to connect to the samba server shows up the message
2009-11-19T23:10:00.000Z	DareDevil0		but without giving me options of writing any username or pass
2009-11-19T23:11:00.000Z	DareDevil0	flan_suse	any suggestion?
2009-11-19T23:12:00.000Z	flan_suse	DareDevil0	are you doing this via a "Shared Folder" under Nautilus?
2009-11-19T23:13:00.000Z	DareDevil0	flan_suse	the same error in console of windows
2009-11-19T23:15:00.000Z	flan_suse	DareDevil0	so you're trying to share a folder on Ubuntu, via Samba/CIFS, and you require the Windows client to enter the Ubuntu username/password to view the share?
2009-11-19T23:15:00.000Z	DareDevil0	flan_suse	that's right
2009-11-19T23:16:00.000Z	flan_suse	DareDevil0	how did you set up the share? The easy way by right-clicking > Share folder?
2009-11-19T23:17:00.000Z	DareDevil0	flan_suse	when i try to share by doing that i get the error in the ubuntu host: net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare add: cannot convert name "Everyone" to a SID. Invalid parameter.
2009-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	flan_suse	DareDevil0	so then how did you set up the share?
2009-11-19T23:23:00.000Z	DareDevil0	flan_suse	by using the root
