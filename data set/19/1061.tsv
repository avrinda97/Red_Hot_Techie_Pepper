2011-12-11T19:43:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	bind your bt-device with rfcomm to a port (rfcomm bind 0 x:y:a:b:h:i) and run gpsd
2011-12-11T19:45:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	, so , using usb is not an option ?
2011-12-11T19:46:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	yes it is
2011-12-11T19:46:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	so how will you use USB then?
2011-12-11T19:47:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	thought it would be simpler
2011-12-11T19:47:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	if your device is giving gps via usb too, try "gpsd -n -N -D4 /dev/ttyUSBx"  (replace x with real device number)
2011-12-11T19:48:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	i am installing gpsd at the moment. thanks, i will try that after its installed :)
2011-12-11T19:49:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	check "dmesg" to get the proper device. when gpsd runs, check for data "telnet localhost 947"
2011-12-11T19:49:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	err*  "telnet localhost 2947"
2011-12-11T19:49:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	some weeks ago, someone invented something called paper and pen
2011-12-11T19:49:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	thanks, im writing all of this down by keyboard ... because xchat is weak :)
2011-12-11T19:53:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	thanks, ctrl+c works... tell me more about this new device "paper and pen" .. is it open source? is it linux compatible ? is it rechargeable ? do i have to pay for a subscription to use it ?
2011-12-11T19:57:00.000Z	pinguy	llutz	how do i get the usb device number ?
2011-12-11T19:57:00.000Z	llutz	pinguy	dmesg
