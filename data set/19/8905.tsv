2007-01-17T09:24:00.000Z	jak1		I need quite guidance to build Makefile to C or C++ programs
2007-01-17T09:25:00.000Z	jak1		I've tried to read several documents but I'm quite newbie in this
2007-01-17T09:25:00.000Z	jak1		I hadn't ever build my own Makefile - just use some one else made of
2007-01-17T09:26:00.000Z	jak1		and now I've to build such of Makefile that can run several other Makefiles which follows their own build rules or uses the global rules
2007-01-17T09:26:00.000Z	jak1		this kind of Makefile is one kind Universal Makefile
2007-01-17T09:26:00.000Z	jak1		can anyone help me?
2007-01-17T09:27:00.000Z	jak1		I found two web pages which was something like that what I'm looking for, but understanding is quite low
2007-01-17T09:28:00.000Z	bulmer	jak1	i was going to recommend a book thats available on line..if you are interested
2007-01-17T09:29:00.000Z	jak1	bulmer	where I can download it?
2007-01-17T09:29:00.000Z	bulmer	jak1	http://sourceware.org/autobook/download.html
2007-01-17T09:35:00.000Z	jak1	bulmer	thanks, but some how I do not want to use Automake :) I'm searching quite simple example what can build several different programs from one makefile
2007-01-17T09:35:00.000Z	bulmer	jak1	I have not finished actually started reading that book, but thats the basis for .configure that turns it into a bigger Makefile
2007-01-17T09:36:00.000Z	jak1	bulmer	something like this -> http://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/make_16.html
2007-01-17T09:37:00.000Z	bulmer	jak1	use it as reference then to build up one to customize your needs
2007-01-17T09:39:00.000Z	jak1	bulmer	I think I do that, but how do I split one makefile to several files and include those makefiles what current progrman needs
2007-01-17T09:40:00.000Z	bulmer	jak1	thats the reason I suggested reading that book on autoconfig, automake, it gives you the baseline on how to build Makefiles in sub-dirs and work your way up to the root Makefile
2007-01-17T09:41:00.000Z	jak1	bulmer	ok, thanks you guidance... I try to solve my problem now on... thanks again
