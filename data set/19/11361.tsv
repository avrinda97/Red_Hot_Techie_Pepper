2006-02-20T07:57:00.000Z	mordof		ok, so im trying to install my nvidia drivers, and my kernal is different, so i have to re-compile it.. but it cant find kernel source files, i THINK i downloaded them but am not sure, i need help here
2006-02-20T07:58:00.000Z	mordof		this is frustrating
2006-02-20T07:59:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	you might only need kernel headers, install them with 'sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2006-02-20T07:59:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	aptitude or apt-get?
2006-02-20T08:00:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	either (i prefer aptitude)
2006-02-20T08:00:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	is it possible to do that inside this? im running irc inside terminal
2006-02-20T08:01:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	possibly - or you could opan another virtual tty with ctrl-alt-F2 (c-a-F1 to get back)
2006-02-20T08:01:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	you said linux-header-$(uname -r)... i type that exactly?
2006-02-20T08:02:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	just making sure so i dont screw anything up..
2006-02-20T08:02:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	yes (it will replace with the output of the command 'uname -r')
2006-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	Couldn't find package linux-header-2.6.12-10-386
2006-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	 headers (plural)
2006-02-20T08:04:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	hurray! that worked, ok now to try the video drivers
2006-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	YES! tyvm! video card drivers installed as a success :D:D:D
2006-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	great! :)
2006-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	i wasn't aware you could do so much without X.. this is amazing
2006-02-20T08:07:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	haha, well once upon a time there was only cli
2006-02-20T08:07:00.000Z	bimberi	mordof	your irc client?  /quit
2006-02-20T08:07:00.000Z	mordof	bimberi	yeah.. thanks, ill be back in in a minute with x-chat
