2008-01-31T20:48:00.000Z	[nrx]		hey folks. I've stupidly enabled restricted drivers, when the machine reboot, my monitor now complains that it can't display the resolution. Can someone give me a quickie on how to rectify this so i can get back in please?

2008-01-31T20:51:00.000Z	[nrx]		i remember there's a bit in xorg.conf that i need to edit, just can't remember how to get to it
2008-01-31T20:51:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ when booting, press F8 or Esc to load the boot menu and choose 'safe' mode
2008-01-31T20:51:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ why not?
2008-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ do you get any errors or what?
2008-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ ok
2008-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ i guess you are booting from the livecd..
2008-01-31T20:53:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ make sure your ubuntu cd is NOT in the drive
2008-01-31T20:53:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ then use 'recovery mode'
2008-01-31T20:53:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ when you log in in recovery mode, edit the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the driver from 'nvidia' to 'nv'
2008-01-31T20:54:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ then try 'mv' the xorg.conf file to xorg.conf.backup and reboot.. see what happens
2008-01-31T20:55:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ then whenever you can just run 'sudo dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2008-01-31T20:56:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ try what i told you to do
2008-01-31T20:57:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ yes. try it.
2008-01-31T20:57:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ later, you can reconfigure your xorg by running 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2008-01-31T20:58:00.000Z	LiMaO	[nrx]	➡ also you may keep the flgrx setting and erase the 'meta modes' section of the xorg.conf file
