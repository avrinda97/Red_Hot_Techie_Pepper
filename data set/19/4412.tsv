2009-01-19T17:49:00.000Z	nzz		all of the lines matching that are ioport/iomem ranges or usb hcd related
2009-01-19T17:50:00.000Z	nzz		the cdrom drive was working for more than a year, though
2009-01-19T17:50:00.000Z	nzz		any way to check without rebooting?
2009-01-19T17:51:00.000Z	oCean_	nzz	what does command "eject" output? (use no options)
2009-01-19T17:52:00.000Z	nzz		eject: unable to open `/dev/hdb'
2009-01-19T17:52:00.000Z	oCean_	nzz	ok, how does ls -al /dev/hdb look?
2009-01-19T17:53:00.000Z	oCean_	nzz	just to make sure the block device is created correctly
2009-01-19T17:53:00.000Z	nzz		 ls -al /dev/hdb
2009-01-19T17:53:00.000Z	nzz		brw-rw---- 1 root cdrom 3, 64 2009-01-19 13:37 /dev/hdb
2009-01-19T17:54:00.000Z	nzz		........ but it only shows up that way because I did mknod, chmod, and chgrp; it doesn't show up on boot
2009-01-19T17:54:00.000Z	nzz		# eject
2009-01-19T17:54:00.000Z	nzz		eject: unable to open `/dev/hdb'
2009-01-19T17:55:00.000Z	nzz		mknod -m 660 hdb b 3 64
2009-01-19T17:56:00.000Z	oCean_	nzz	you're sure of the major/minor ?
2009-01-19T17:56:00.000Z	nzz	oCean_	it's what seems to be documented everywhere for hdb, and it's what my ubuntu machine has; what does ls -la /dev/hdb say for you?
2009-01-19T17:57:00.000Z	oCean_	nzz	I have a scsi drive, so it's /dev/sdc0
2009-01-19T18:01:00.000Z	nzz		ok, yes, my bios seems my cdrom drive; it's the primary IDE slave
2009-01-19T18:01:00.000Z	oCean_	nzz	the major #3 = ide hdd or cd indeed. 64 is slave
2009-01-19T18:02:00.000Z	nzz	oCean_	exactly :/
