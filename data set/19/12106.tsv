2005-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	AES_24_96		is it even possible to dual bnoot? I got 7 gigs left on the system drive
2005-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	AES_24_96		sure
2005-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	Ubuntu is about 1.8Gb installed, so you should have space w/ 7Gb
2005-10-14T15:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	I'd do a 2.5 or 3Gb root, and the rest of that 7Gb as /home partition...
2005-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	AES_24_96	Madpilot	I will go to wikipedia to see what that means :)
2005-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	heh... sorry, I assumed you spoke Linux... ;)
2005-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	do you know what a harddrive partition is?
2005-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	OK... Windows generally uses one big partition; the OS and your own files all together. Linux generally uses two partitions, one for the OS and /home for the user
2005-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	you can use everything in one partition if you want
2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	yes there is - the Ubuntu installer can do it, among other methods
2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	NTFS is read only for Linux
2005-10-14T15:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	what do you do that needs whole drives moved around like that?
2005-10-14T15:26:00.000Z	AES_24_96	Madpilot	here is my ugly mug http://www.recordingproject.com/articles/article.php?article=23
2005-10-14T15:40:00.000Z	AES_24_96	Madpilot	ok aso this is what I want to grab right? http://www.ubuntu.com/download/
2005-10-14T15:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	that's where you'll get the ISOs of Ubuntu, yes
2005-10-17T14:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	if you're running Ubuntu, you have a BT client built in..

2005-10-17T14:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	WinRAR has some odd ideas about what it should open - it screws with Java jar files too
2005-10-17T14:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	AES_24_96	see the wiki URL I gave you earlier, it's got info on verifying md5 in XP
