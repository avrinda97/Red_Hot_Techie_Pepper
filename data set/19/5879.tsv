2009-01-27T06:21:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	does that apply to binaries?
2009-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	that tutorial doesn't no
2009-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	have you got one for me? :)
2009-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	it depends on the setup. It is pretty straight forward.
2009-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	care to enlighten me?
2009-01-27T06:23:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	azureus is a garbage application, but what it wants you to do is extract and run a program in it
2009-01-27T06:23:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	Start Azureus by running the script named 'azureus'; ex. "./azureus"
2009-01-27T06:23:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	extract the tarball, then run the script named azureus
2009-01-27T06:24:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	bruenig but where is a good place to store the dir?
2009-01-27T06:24:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	/opt
2009-01-27T06:26:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	i'm being told i don't have the right permissions. also, the dir is empty, is there any reason i don't store it with the rest of my programs wherever they are?
2009-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	because according to the filesystem hierarchy standard any program which does not follow the FHS conventions goes in /opt
2009-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	ok, i'll google fhs conventions, can you tell me how to make it let me put a program there even though it says i don't have the right permissions?
2009-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	you use root
2009-01-27T06:29:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	is there a way to perform a sudo file operation through gnome?
2009-01-27T06:35:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	cool, i have the dir now in my opt dir using the sudo cli, the read me says i just need to run the script azureus now and gives an example of ./azureus, but when i type that nothing happens?
2009-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	bruenig	laeg	cd into the extracted directory and run that command
2009-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	laeg	bruenig	hold that though, sorry i thought i was in there but i'm only in opt. i think i have it from here, thanks for your help, and i'm only using azureus because last time i checked it's the only client capable of shuffling inactive seeding torrents for others in the queue to help with ratio
