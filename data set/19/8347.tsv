2007-04-08T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntuuser9090	aeonix	insert it into your cd drive and reboot
2007-04-08T15:47:00.000Z	ubuntuuser9090	aeonix	 most computers will handle this fine, if not you may have to go into the bios and set it to boot from CD
2007-04-08T15:48:00.000Z	ubuntuuser9090	aeonix	wait, are you trying to upgrade?
