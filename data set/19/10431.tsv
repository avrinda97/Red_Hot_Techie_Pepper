2009-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	bod		Hi, i cant seem to install nvidia drivers from the hardware drivers program. how can i install them through apt?
2009-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	bod	what version of ubuntu?
2009-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	bod	jrib	intrepid
2009-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	bod	that document covers intrepid
2009-02-23T06:03:00.000Z	bod	jrib	cheers :)
2009-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	bod	jrib	just out of curiosity, should that link have been to the binary drivers how to (in general) or to the nvidia one (specific)?
2009-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	bod	well the binarydrivers link should link to nvidia
2009-02-23T06:05:00.000Z	bod	jrib	yes it does, but as the factoid was !nvidia i just wondered why it was not a direct link, nvm :)
2009-02-23T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	bod	ah, probably just to keep factoid maintenance down :)
2009-02-23T06:06:00.000Z	bod	jrib	ok, I do have another problem though, that link does not seem to explain how to install from apt, just the hardware drivers ap way (which does not work for me)
2009-02-23T06:10:00.000Z	jrib	bod	it should mention the name of the packages for nvidia (apt-cache search -n nvidia-glx)
2009-02-23T06:10:00.000Z	bod	jrib	i have that package, and the nvidia-177-modaliases
2009-02-23T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	bod	what package exactly?
2009-02-23T06:11:00.000Z	bod	jrib	nvidia-glx-177
2009-02-23T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	bod	did you enable the nvidia driver in your xorg.conf?
2009-02-23T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	bod	so it's fine then?
2009-02-23T06:14:00.000Z	bod	jrib	that means im using the driver? hmm, wonder why im stuck in 800x600 then
2009-02-23T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	bod	pastebin the log
2009-02-23T06:20:00.000Z	bod	jrib	WelshDragon -- found some nvidia related stuff in there  http://paste.ubuntu.com/121636/   -- and heres the whole log  http://paste.ubuntu.com/121637/
