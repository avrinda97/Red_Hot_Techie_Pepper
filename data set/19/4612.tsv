2009-01-08T19:30:00.000Z	mchelen		how do you find the connection speed of a network card from the command line?
2009-01-08T19:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	ifconfig <interface name>
2009-01-08T19:31:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	that doensnt show the connection speed
2009-01-08T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	let me websearch
2009-01-08T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	try iftop
2009-01-08T19:35:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	its not installed, will try though
2009-01-08T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	http://pwet.fr/man/linux/administration_systeme/iftop
2009-01-08T19:36:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	im talking about the network speed 10/100/1000mbps not bandwidth usage
2009-01-08T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	seems to be: lshw -C | grep -i size
2009-01-08T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	or try grepping capacity
2009-01-08T19:43:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	-C option needs a class group name
2009-01-08T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	lshw -C network
2009-01-08T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	look for size and capacity
2009-01-08T19:46:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	there is no size, only various other stats
2009-01-08T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	did lshw not show it?
2009-01-08T20:11:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	not anywhere in the -C network or with grepping for size
2009-01-08T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	bah
2009-01-08T20:14:00.000Z	mchelen	ActionParsnip	"dmesg | grep eth" worked for me on one system
2009-02-16T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mchelen	depends on the data needs of the game, it might not suffer over a slow link, it vary from game to game
