2007-09-21T16:04:00.000Z	rosenator		hey are there any preseed experts around?
2007-09-21T16:05:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	What do you need to know about preseed files?
2007-09-21T16:06:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	Please put my nick in the line or it is easy to miss in scoll here :)
2007-09-21T16:07:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	sorry
2007-09-21T16:07:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	1 moment I'll try to view what you wrote, need to scroll up
2007-09-21T16:08:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	just trying to do pressed install remotely using PXE boot + VNC
2007-09-21T16:08:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	You can execute preinstall and postinstall scripts directly from the preseed file itself. you want to install over VNC?
2007-09-21T16:09:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	yeah, just like autoyast for opensuse does.  I found the preinstall script, I'm just not sure I can redirect the running installer session to the vnc.  maybe Xvnc would do it?
2007-09-21T16:11:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	I haven't yet tried this method, but did work out a way to install via ssh. You are looking at an interactive install or hands-off/automated?
2007-09-21T16:12:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	well,this is mostly hands off, but with the ability to 'step in' or at least observe the progress
2007-09-21T16:15:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	You can run in the preinstall the neccesary steps to install the dependent packages for vnc, then to execute it and background. I did this with the openssh-server (I also ran screen in this case to allow interactive from either console)
2007-09-21T16:17:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	Make sure to either execute by prefix /target or use the other method, in-target
2007-09-21T16:19:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	ok I'll let you know how it goes
2007-09-21T16:20:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	You're welcome. i had to empirically learn these things, i know how frustrating it is, little docs on the preseed files etc
2007-09-21T16:22:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	yeah, of all of ubuntu's great community support, it seems the pressed info is a little lacking
2007-09-21T16:22:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	preseed, I mean
2007-09-21T16:23:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	I found the debian documentation most helpful for it :)
2007-09-21T16:25:00.000Z	rosenator	genii	a ha that's a start
2007-09-21T16:27:00.000Z	genii	rosenator	I installed with text installer. I found looking at console4 output when it got stuck processing a preseed directive very useful in debugging.
