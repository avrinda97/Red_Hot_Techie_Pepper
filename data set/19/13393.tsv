2005-04-08T15:00:00.000Z	grogoreo		does anyone have any problems with TOTEM on Ubuntu, because every time I try to play a range of formats it says thers no plugins for it. I've looked in the plugins folder (well i think it was the plugins folder) and there was nothing there. Any ideas?
2005-04-08T15:01:00.000Z	PecK	grogoreo	do you know how to use Synaptics, the package manager?
2005-04-08T15:03:00.000Z	grogoreo	PecK	yes
2005-04-08T15:04:00.000Z	grogoreo	PecK	I can use Synaptic
2005-04-08T15:04:00.000Z	PecK	grogoreo	did u add universe and multiverse repositories to it?
2005-04-08T15:04:00.000Z	grogoreo	PecK	yes
2005-04-08T15:04:00.000Z	PecK	grogoreo	then look for gstreamer plugins, mpg, faad, faac
2005-04-08T15:22:00.000Z	PecK	grogoreo	check your volume level
2005-04-08T15:23:00.000Z	grogoreo	PecK	volumes are fine. If I play a CD by pressing the play button on the front I can adjust the volume of it with the Master Volume but I cant hear anything if I use the Gnome CD Player or any other program
2005-04-08T15:24:00.000Z	grogoreo	PecK	I updating a few days ago
2005-04-08T15:26:00.000Z	PecK	grogoreo	try shutting down the pc and restarting it

2005-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	PecK	grogoreo	if everything's ok it's hard to help ;) do your appz play sounds??
2005-04-08T15:29:00.000Z	grogoreo	PecK	yes. Well normally Ubuntu makes sounds and Totem says its playing something but doesnt sound anything
