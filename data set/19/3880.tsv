2011-04-08T00:10:00.000Z	gedO		Any way to fix this???
2011-04-08T00:11:00.000Z	gedO		Guys how to check my hdd with smartmontools???
2011-04-08T00:13:00.000Z	gedO		?
2011-04-08T00:14:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	nope
2011-04-08T00:11:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	what is the error
2011-04-08T00:11:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	smartctl
2011-04-08T00:11:00.000Z	gedO	acicula	"Realocated sectour Count"
2011-04-08T00:12:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	or under administration -> disk utility
2011-04-08T00:12:00.000Z	gedO	acicula	How I could fix this error???
2011-04-08T00:13:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	that number represents reallocated sectors to compensate for broken secots
2011-04-08T00:13:00.000Z	gedO	acicula	any way to reduce that number?
2011-04-08T00:13:00.000Z	gedO	acicula	lets say with nuke
2011-04-08T00:14:00.000Z	gedO	acicula	 is that dangerous to use this hdd longer?
2011-04-08T00:15:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	you probably want to replace the disk as soon as possible
2011-04-08T00:17:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	you can tell the disk firmware to remap sectors as good using a low level format, but it does not fix the drives surface. best to just shell out for a new drive
2011-04-08T00:19:00.000Z	acicula	gedO	reallocated count means the drive is compensating for bad sectors
