2010-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	plasmator		Hi, my ubuntu doesn't work can someone help me
2010-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	plasmator		Why does my ubuntu look like Windows?
2010-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	plasmator		It looks like Windows not Ubuntu
2010-04-19T09:53:00.000Z	plasmator		the whole thing looks like windows
2010-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	plasmator		it even says 'starting windows'
2010-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	plasmator		but I installed ubuntu
2010-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	plasmator		what is a bootloader
2010-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	plasmator		i installed ubuntu
2010-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	plasmator		it said it worked
2010-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	did you install ubuntu ALONGSIDE windows or INSTEAD OF windows?
2010-04-19T09:56:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	did you install ubuntu from within windows by any chance?
2010-04-19T09:58:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	that means you installed wubi and that makes sense
2010-04-19T10:06:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	I suggest that you get help from your local ubuntu community, ubuntu is not hard to use for people with computing experience, but if you don't know computing basics
2010-04-19T10:07:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	I'm sure your local community can guide you through the installation process and can probably help you get used to ubuntu. you'll probably even find it easier to use eventually
2010-04-19T10:07:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	well if you tell us where you live we can find it for you, or you can use the internet
2010-04-19T10:10:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	you should've at least been funnier
2010-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	plasmator	inglor	 Yeah but there's that fine line between funny and unbelievable
2010-04-19T10:16:00.000Z	inglor	plasmator	thing is you can get good power supplies that rarely fail but good hdds also fail pretty bad -_-
2010-04-19T10:16:00.000Z	plasmator	inglor	true
