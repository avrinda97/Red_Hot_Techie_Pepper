2007-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	cube		i have a new pc build and it makes the thinking sound when my hd activity light goes on! does it mean my sata hd is messed up??
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	cube		the sound didn't happen right away when i installed ubuntu as a OS but now about a week later it happens when i open programs etc
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	cube		its like the classic crappy computer thinking sound, but this thing is a beast why is it doing it?
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	cube		for sure... it would be cool to know u had the option
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	cube		anyone know why my computer is making the thinking sound?? would it be my hard drive?
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	cube		it makes the sound when my hd activity light blinks
2007-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	cube		im not too happy that my new pc build is making the thinking sound...the same 1 that old pos pc's make
2007-11-02T09:33:00.000Z	cube		anyone know of any good readings at barnes and noble? im going to go there to get linux bible 07 and looking for something else to pickup
2007-11-02T09:34:00.000Z	cube		manufacturer for the mother board ?
2007-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	cube		scguy318:yeah thats what i am thinking but my old 40gb ide drive didn't why would my new 400gb sata do it?
2007-11-02T09:36:00.000Z	tr0seph	cube	depends on how much ram you have. If you are constantly going to the swap, its going to read your HD a lot.
2007-11-02T09:36:00.000Z	cube		trOseph: I have 2gb of ram per cpu (dual socket) and like 5.8gb of swap
2007-11-02T09:37:00.000Z	tr0seph	cube	lol I don't know what the problem is then.
2007-11-02T09:37:00.000Z	cube		its not good...i don't want to put this pretty box in a another one
2007-11-02T09:37:00.000Z	cube		i am sure hitatchi doesn't support anything
2007-11-02T09:38:00.000Z	cube		zippy: what is daily build?
2007-11-02T09:38:00.000Z	tr0seph	cube	perhaps it has to do with this: https://launchpad.net/bug59695.html
2007-11-02T09:38:00.000Z	cube		lol pm him if you don't want others
2007-11-02T09:39:00.000Z	cube	tr0seph	that link was about switching to battery power though
