2006-06-03T13:47:00.000Z	TR_WolF		hi i have a ?
2006-06-03T13:47:00.000Z	TR_WolF		I need help
2006-06-03T13:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	just ask, no need to ask to ask...
2006-06-03T13:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	first you need to ask an actual question...
2006-06-03T13:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	before you can PM on freenode you need to register - http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
2006-06-03T13:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	is your 2nd HD an NTFS drive?
2006-06-03T13:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	you can mount & read NTFS in Linux, but you can't write to it
2006-06-03T13:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	you'll have to partition one drive to give Ubuntu some space to install, and your XP partitions will be read-only
2006-06-03T13:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo
2006-06-03T13:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	it shouldn't - and if your 2nd HD is blank, you can use it and leave your windows HD mostly alone
2006-06-03T13:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	but read that dualboot URL I gave you
2006-06-03T14:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	GRUB is what boots Ubuntu, and it can boot Windows too if you're dual booting
2006-06-03T14:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	grub gets installed by Ubuntu when it installs
2006-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	what're you trying to do?
2006-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	the big ISO file?
2006-06-03T14:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	ISO files aren't zip files. don't unpack it
2006-06-03T14:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BurningIsoHowto
2006-06-03T14:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	scroll down to the Burning in XP section, it's quite short
2006-06-03T14:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	TR_WolF	between XP & Ubuntu? it should be set up automatically during Ubuntu's install
