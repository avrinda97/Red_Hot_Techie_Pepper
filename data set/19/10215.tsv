2006-07-12T15:09:00.000Z	kakado	paul__	have done something before ?
2006-07-12T15:09:00.000Z	paul__		like what?
2006-07-12T15:09:00.000Z	kakado	paul__	changed some config files
2006-07-12T15:10:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	my friend was helping me thru it and we changed  /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-07-12T15:12:00.000Z	kakado	paul__	so, have you checked for typos in menu.lst ?
2006-07-12T15:13:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	I tried to change the BIOS boot order but still nothing. I think its booting thru the wrong partition
2006-07-12T15:13:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	no
2006-07-12T15:14:00.000Z	kakado	paul__	the partition is defined like /dev/hda3
2006-07-12T15:14:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	im told there are none
2006-07-12T15:14:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	its /dev/hda1
2006-07-12T15:16:00.000Z	kakado	paul__	you can boot on a livecd an use cfdisk to list the partitions, see if you can figure out the correct to boot
2006-07-12T15:17:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	thats what i have to do, boot through the live cd, just to get linux to load
2006-07-12T15:19:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	thanks, i'll try that
2006-07-12T15:19:00.000Z	kakado	paul__	ok
2006-07-12T15:26:00.000Z	paul__	kakado	rebooting now...thanks
