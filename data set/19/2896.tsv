2011-06-22T08:26:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	tried testdisk... it was useless. It couldn't find the old partition
2011-06-22T08:27:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	Why nD comes befor nb with TAB????
2011-06-22T08:28:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	what?
2011-06-22T08:29:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	Are the files you want to read named .doc
2011-06-22T08:29:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	yeah... basically I just want to compose a text file with the recovered name followed by the first few lines of a file.
2011-06-22T08:30:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	simple script if I can get the first few lines of the .doc file
2011-06-22T08:30:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	doc, do not contain test in first line, rather formating. but...
2011-06-22T08:31:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	I know. I want to know if there's a command line tool for reading .doc files that I can use to grab the first few lines.
2011-06-22T08:31:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	find /change/path/here/ -name *.doc -exec head -n 1 {} \;
2011-06-22T08:32:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	but that doesn't actually read the text in the .doc file. That returns junk from an ascii read of the file.
2011-06-22T08:34:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	well, yes, can you paste sample of any doc file?
2011-06-22T08:36:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	can I add an attachment to the pastebin?
2011-06-22T08:42:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	Try catdoc, if this wont do, there is few php based scripts, or some in development
2011-06-22T08:42:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	thanks. I'll give it a shot.
2011-06-22T08:51:00.000Z	qin	nbros652	Found one more, wvWare (going to test it, as soon as i will get any doc file).

2011-06-22T08:51:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	thanks
2011-06-22T08:51:00.000Z	nbros652	qin	don't worry about testing. I should be good to go from here.
