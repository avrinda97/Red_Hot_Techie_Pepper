2005-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	effie		blender
2005-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	effie		no, I'm not a regular ubunto person
2005-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	effie		I mean, I'm trying to find what's best for 'them'
2005-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	effie		not for me
2005-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	effie		:)
2005-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	effie		I was just looking at totem-xine or totem-gstreamer
2005-10-19T16:38:00.000Z	effie		wich would give them the most possible options?
2005-10-19T16:39:00.000Z	effie		no, really, some do you have some advice? some user ideas? or is vlc (ATM) the most versatile player?
2005-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	effie		I use mplayer for 'whatever' but I'm used to reading html sources or other stuff to find the mms:// url and so on
2005-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	effie		( me even uses edl editing _
2005-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	_jason	effie	what do you use to play mms:// ?
2005-10-19T16:41:00.000Z	effie	_jason	mplayer
2005-10-19T16:41:00.000Z	effie		*no idea wether it works with any packaged version since I compile my own
2005-10-19T16:41:00.000Z	_jason	effie	 k I was hoping there was another option because some of my streams don't work
2005-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	effie	_jason	most mms I encountered work. but mms doesn't say much about the codec, it's just the way it's delivered
2005-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	effie		you did try vlc?
2005-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	effie		tho it's a hard ui to use
2005-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	_jason	effie	 can you do me a favor and see if it will play: mms://rdp.oninet.pt/antena1  I ahve been trying everything.  If I have to compile mplayer I'll gladly do it.
2005-10-19T16:42:00.000Z	_jason	effie	 it's a portuguese news station btw
