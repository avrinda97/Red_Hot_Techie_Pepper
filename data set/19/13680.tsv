2005-03-02T12:39:00.000Z	zOap		Noone know how to choose video card in ubuntu? I have a s3 virge mx and it wont work, only 640x480. In wharty it works fine...
2005-03-02T12:40:00.000Z	zOap		Am i invisible?
2005-03-02T12:42:00.000Z	zOap		I understand if you guys can't help me with my problem, but you could atleast have the courtesy to give me a hint where to find the info... This is not what I call a "good" support channel"...
2005-03-02T12:43:00.000Z	zOap		zen, did so, couldnt find any info
2005-03-02T12:45:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	first make sure that all XFree86 stuff is purged. Then try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2005-03-02T12:45:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	purged?
2005-03-02T12:46:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	then stap yourself in the eye for switching to Hoary when you dont know how to purge packages and use apt
2005-03-02T12:47:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	I don't have any eyes... I'm blind... I get error: conflict when i do the dpkg..
2005-03-02T12:49:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	I think the largest hurdle when switching from Warty to Hoary is to remove XFree86 in favour of Xorg... try marking xserver-xfree86 for deletion in aptitude and see if it will be able to resolve dependencies - that will be a start.
2005-03-02T12:50:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	ok. I'll try that. thanx
2005-03-02T12:56:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	Ok I'm now trying to use xfree86.. I have another q if  you can answer it: I need to use ProTools Free for win98. I've found wine to be somewhat unreliable. Is there any other emulation software for win98 which can do  the job?
2005-03-02T12:57:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	You dont want to use xfree86 (and Lathiat is right; it shouldnt be intalled). You want to use Xorg. I dont know anything protools
2005-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	xfree wasnt installed...
2005-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	and still only 640x480 res? try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2005-03-02T13:00:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	i did that. and i got the error : conflict in action, --control and --remove..
2005-03-02T13:01:00.000Z	zOap	JDahl	actually, any dpkg responds with the conflict error..
2005-03-02T13:02:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	try "sudo apt-get install -f"
2005-03-02T13:03:00.000Z	JDahl	zOap	there could be some pending packages with buggy configuration scripts that's blocking apt
