2007-04-30T11:08:00.000Z	Polygon89		im trying to run the live cd, but my computer is refusing to boot from any live cd, and ive set it in the bios to boot from cd first. any suggestions?
2007-04-30T11:08:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	if you really want to see if it'll boot from the CD, disconnect your hard drive and floppy manually, and only leave the CDROM attached
2007-04-30T11:10:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	then it just says operating system not found
2007-04-30T11:10:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	do you have another bootable CD of anything else ?
2007-04-30T11:11:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	i will try a different live cd but i think it still doesnt work
2007-04-30T11:11:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	yep still does not work
2007-04-30T11:12:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	if your computer is unable to boot from two different live cds, don't you think it might not be an ubuntu problem?
2007-04-30T11:12:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	maybe your CDROM is busted?
2007-04-30T11:12:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	have you tried booting with a windows cd?
2007-04-30T11:13:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	i dunno whats wrong, cause the light on the cd rom drive flash, and you can hear it spinning up but for some reason it does not boot from it... this is also the second cd rom that ive tried
2007-04-30T11:13:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	most likely a comp problem... great.
2007-04-30T11:20:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	great thing about open source, programs can be ported =)
2007-04-30T11:21:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	life is short
2007-04-30T11:21:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	you could be a big nerd and install cygwin and run irssi
2007-04-30T11:21:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	you could
2007-04-30T11:22:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	but this is windows your talking about, it has enough trouble running its own programs, let alone programs in cgywin or gtk ;)
2007-04-30T11:22:00.000Z	mobutu	Polygon89	i run GAIM in windows, and GAIM does irc.
2007-04-30T11:23:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	i like xchat better, although i do use gaim in windows
2007-04-30T11:25:00.000Z	Polygon89	mobutu	there is, but the offical xchat version (made by the xchat devs) costs money, while someone just made another port and its free.
