2005-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	epicenter		I saved most of Crimsun's messages. I hope I can get this shit compiled on my own
2005-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	epicenter		I did lose the URL to the ALSA 1.0.9 rc 2 pack though :(
2005-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	epicenter		IS THERE ANYONE ALIVE OUT THERE
2005-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	epicenter		ext3 still
2005-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	:)
2005-04-21T12:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	k8 should be better than k7, yeah :)
2005-04-21T12:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	You aren't smarter than gcc. Most people aren't.
2005-04-21T12:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	You'd be surprised.
2005-04-21T12:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	Um, gcc doesn't write algorithms.
2005-04-21T12:32:00.000Z	epicenter	Amaranth	That's my point :P
2005-04-21T12:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	But that has nothing to do with switching to 64-bit.
2005-04-21T12:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	gcc figures out how to use the registers, the algorithm is written in C
2005-04-21T12:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	I don't know if I've said this enough yet but AMD64 is just an x86 with 64-bit extensions. :)
2005-04-21T12:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	It all comes down to gcc being smarter than you are producing machine code for the AMD64. :)
2005-04-21T12:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	Let me know we you rewrite GNOME in asm
2005-04-21T12:38:00.000Z	epicenter	Amaranth	if you read what I said, you'd see only bits and pieces of things are ASM Now. Like a looped encoding function. Never a whole program.
2005-04-21T12:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	The only time ASM is used is when you're doing embedded stuff.
2005-04-21T12:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	epicenter	for 99.99999999999999999999999% of applications
2005-04-21T12:50:00.000Z	epicenter	Amaranth	I'm not lecturing you on anything
