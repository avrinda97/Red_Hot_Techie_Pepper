2005-01-15T16:46:00.000Z	siddharth	onno	could be a problem of the php script itself.

2005-01-15T17:00:00.000Z	onno	siddharth	do you know how to add something to the menu... I installed quanta but it isn't in any menu?
2005-01-15T17:02:00.000Z	siddharth	onno	not sure what you mean. Add something to the gnome-panel menu?
2005-01-15T17:02:00.000Z	onno		also that, it is a bit awkward if you want to add an app to the panel
2005-01-15T17:03:00.000Z	siddharth	onno	I had heard some time ago that menu editing was a work in progress. Not sure if Gnome 2.8 has full support.
