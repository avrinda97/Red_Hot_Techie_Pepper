2005-07-18T09:13:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	post the output of lspci that is relevant to the card
2005-07-18T09:14:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	if u google for that chipset, it will tell u whether linux has native support for the device. if it doesnt, go to the ndiswrapper home page and it gives instructions for installing it
2005-07-18T09:15:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	keep in mind that ndiswrapper, well working good, doesnt support 100% of all devices
2005-07-18T09:15:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	78 :-P
2005-07-18T09:15:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	is ubuntu detecting the device?
2005-07-18T09:16:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	its seeing it, but is it actually detecting it as a network card? according to Juhaz it is supported natively
2005-07-18T09:17:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	open System >> Administration >> Network
2005-07-18T09:18:00.000Z	gm78	Scroopy	how many network cards do u have in the computer?
