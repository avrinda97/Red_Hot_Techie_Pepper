2008-11-02T21:45:00.000Z	ping		Hi
2008-11-02T21:46:00.000Z	ping		somebody here who has knowledge of vnc4server?
2008-11-02T21:48:00.000Z	ping		if i try to run vnc4server allways come the error:vncpasswd: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2008-11-02T21:48:00.000Z	ping		can't fix this problem
2008-11-02T21:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 thats.. weird.. is this a  8.10 upgrade or clean install?
2008-11-02T21:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 well its running here on my upgraded machine properly
2008-11-02T21:53:00.000Z	ping	dr_willis	hmm which libary you use then, for vnc4server?
2008-11-02T21:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 no clue.. i dont have that lib at all installed.. could be  the twm window manager calling for it?
2008-11-02T21:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 try editing your .vnc/xstartup script to run some other window manager.  like icewm
2008-11-02T21:56:00.000Z	ping	dr_willis	hmm this seems to be my fault, there doos not exist any xstartup file
2008-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 normally the first time you run vnc4server it generates a .vnc/xstartup file
2008-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	ping	dr_willis	but i couldn't run vnc till now, cause of this missing libary
2008-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 yep.. thats weird..
2008-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 apt-cache search libc6.2   dosent even show that lib.
2008-11-02T22:00:00.000Z	ping	dr_willis	yes only deb packages exist for this libary
2008-11-02T22:00:00.000Z	ping	dr_willis	think i only have to route the request to a newer lib??
2008-11-02T22:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 somthing seems very odd about this.. You might want to try removing the vnc4server package and try reinstallin git.. or try the tightvnc server
2008-11-02T22:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 im running vnc4server and I dont need that lib.. so somthing is very.. odd..
2008-11-02T22:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	ping	 and this is on a upgraded machine from hardy
