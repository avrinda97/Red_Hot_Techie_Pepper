2012-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	krababbel		Can I use OpenJDK for Libreoffice and Oracle Java for Firefox?
2012-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	I suppose so
2012-05-10T03:59:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	I'll try, just installed oracle java from a ppa
2012-05-10T04:00:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	why you all want to use ppas?
2012-05-10T04:00:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	oracle java is better supported by browser apps, and not available in ubuntu
2012-05-10T04:02:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	well, you can try with the packet default-jdk etc.
2012-05-10T04:07:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	you should _really_ not remove j6
2012-05-10T04:07:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	I thought I could safely install openjdk7 instead.
2012-05-10T04:08:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	I am nearly sure that that would break things. There are a lot of programs just for J6
2012-05-10T04:08:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	you can specify the classpath etc.
2012-05-10T04:09:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	thanks for the hint. I hoped libreoffice would support openjdk7 already, didn't check.
2012-05-10T04:15:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	did it randomly disconnect?
2012-05-10T04:16:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	no, the display wouldn't work correctly, when switching channels
2012-05-10T04:16:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	I think is because of the key shortcuts
2012-05-10T04:19:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664858 seems to be due to my nvidia card too
2012-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	doomrobo " we have to invent entirely new GL extensions" is the last post
2012-05-10T04:21:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	lol
2012-05-10T04:21:00.000Z	krababbel	txomon|home	Well I need shortcuts anyway. In virtualbox there were no problems by the way. :)
2012-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	txomon|home	krababbel	I will stand in 11.10 till they resolve those sort of things...
