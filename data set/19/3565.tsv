2009-07-16T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	mount
2009-07-16T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	do yuo mean drives or drivers
2009-07-16T11:54:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	i knew a tow char command which gave more info
2009-07-16T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	do you mean drivers for hardware, or do you mean drives as in hard drive storage?
2009-07-16T11:55:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	please give the command for drivers too.
2009-07-16T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	mount   will show you where partitions (you can't mount drives) are mounted.   sudo lshw | less   will show you all hardware and what driver it is used
2009-07-16T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	whch is why I asked you to clarify
2009-07-16T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	its a DRIVE, you never mount a drive, you can mount the partition/s  on the drive
2009-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	thx... and the answer to my question ?
2009-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	if they are not mounted how you like then you can remount them using terminal
2009-07-16T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	you will need to use:   sudo umount /mount/point   to unmount the partition first
2009-07-16T12:02:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	we can see a list of partitions in places/computer window. are these mounted and have they any mounted name which we can use in terminal or we should mount them in termianl ...
2009-07-16T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	i use terminal persoanlly
2009-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	maybe my question is not clear....
2009-07-16T12:05:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	I want to use some nfts partion in terminal. they are accessible without mounting in gdm. are they accessible in termianl (without mounting) too?
2009-07-16T12:06:00.000Z	staticRails	ActionParsnip	do they have any default mounted name in terminal or should id mount them ?
2009-07-16T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	staticRails	sudo mkdir /media/ntfs_partition; sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/<partition name here> /media/ntfs_partition -o uid=1000
