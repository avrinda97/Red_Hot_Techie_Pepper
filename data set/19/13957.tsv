2008-11-04T15:47:00.000Z	linux_trojan		I didnt know that
2008-11-04T15:47:00.000Z	linux_trojan		well, I am running VISTA at home, and my laptop has Ubuntu
2008-11-04T15:48:00.000Z	linux_trojan		there is no SSH for windows, at least none that is reputable
2008-11-04T15:48:00.000Z	linux_trojan		never heard of rdp
2008-11-04T15:49:00.000Z	linux_trojan		hmmmm
2008-11-04T15:49:00.000Z	linux_trojan		I dont like that stuff, Dell always ask me for that and it pisses me off
2008-11-04T15:49:00.000Z	linux_trojan		trying to see my porn
2008-11-04T15:50:00.000Z	linux_trojan		anything Windows makes me nervous, if I could record tv on my comp in linux I would dump Vista
2008-11-04T15:50:00.000Z	linux_trojan		but tv viewing and recording is cumbersome and difficult on linux
2008-11-04T15:51:00.000Z	linux_trojan		Myth TV can download tv schedules and setup timed recordings?
2008-11-04T15:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 you can.. but unfortuntly - to get tv schedules you have to subscribe to some service.. like $10 a year..
2008-11-04T15:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 unless its changed by now. check in #mythbuntu
2008-11-04T15:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 you can even rcord and auto-zap commercials and auto-convert to avi or whatever
2008-11-04T16:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 it may not be able to access the tv tuner hardware that way
2008-11-04T16:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 it may ne easier to use the mythbuntu livecd/installer cd..  depends on your Linux-Skills
2008-11-04T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 lightweight... :P
2008-11-04T16:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 i saw one of those storage servers.. that had its own torrent client built in. :)
2008-11-04T16:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 theres proberly a way to convert them
2008-11-04T16:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	linux_trojan	 theres dozens of fancy video tools for linux. Most are not GUI however.. :) but once ya learn how to use them
