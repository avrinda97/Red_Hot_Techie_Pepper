2008-08-01T11:43:00.000Z	dglkn		I'm getting really slow network file transfers with my wireless LAN. Distance from the router is not the problem. I've got my devices set to 36Mb/sec, and the transfers are only about 7Mb/sec
2008-08-01T11:44:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	which wifi is it?
2008-08-01T11:44:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	not the router, the wifi adapter in your computer
2008-08-01T11:45:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	ok, the one in my laptop is bcm43xx, and the one in my desktop is rt61pci
2008-08-01T11:46:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	and which one is slow?
2008-08-01T11:46:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	i'm not sure
2008-08-01T11:47:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	first of all, for rt61pci, you have to do "sudo iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M" to get full speed
2008-08-01T11:47:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	that actually made it slower
2008-08-01T11:47:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	for some reason, 36M seems to be optimal
2008-08-01T11:47:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	for the broadcom, you have to upgrade to the "b43" driver instead of "bcm43xx"
2008-08-01T11:48:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	i just used the restricted drivers for the bcm43

2008-08-01T11:49:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	i already have that installed
2008-08-01T11:50:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	which? bcm, or b43?
2008-08-01T11:51:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	when i look at the connection information, the driver says b43
2008-08-01T11:51:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	ok, good
2008-08-01T11:52:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	it's probably a limitation of your specific revision of the wrt54gs, then
2008-08-01T11:52:00.000Z	sn9	dglkn	wikipedia has a nice reference on them
2008-08-01T11:53:00.000Z	dglkn	sn9	well, what's odd is that it will transfer files at about 7Mb, and I can still download files from the internet at 6Mb(which is my connection maximum)
