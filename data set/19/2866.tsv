2010-06-04T13:41:00.000Z	misterB		couple of questions... 1. I can't change the default video player for any type of file even when I right-click and choose open with other app.           2. I get no preview for any audio files when I hover over them, but the option is turned on.        Any ideas on either question?
2010-06-04T13:42:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	to  change the app use right click - properties -open with tab, to the other question i think you may be missing the required plugins/libraries to playback those files and thats why it fails
2010-06-04T13:43:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	that took care of problem number 1, thanks. Any ideas on problem 2?
2010-06-04T13:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	whats the type of file it doenst work with?
2010-06-04T13:45:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	I've only tried mp3's
2010-06-04T13:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	you may need to install the packages mpg321 and vorbis-tools for the audio preview to work
2010-06-04T13:48:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	still not working. would a logout/login be required as well?
2010-06-04T13:48:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	maybe or restarting nautilus
2010-06-04T13:49:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	ok, brb
2010-06-04T13:51:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	didn't work, will try logout/login
2010-06-04T13:55:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	no good.
2010-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	i know it requried those packages in earlier version, maybe they switched the preview to gstreamer, do those files playback in totem?
2010-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	mgolisch		maybe you need to install the gstreamer-mad plugin
2010-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	mgolisch		just a guess though
2010-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	yeah, plays fine in totem
2010-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	maybe theres a bug filed for that in launchpad, might  be worth looking for
2010-06-04T14:00:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	okay, checking to see if it's 64bit specific.
2010-06-04T14:08:00.000Z	misterB	mgolisch	... figured it out. Apparently the preview uses rythmbox, and by default, the audio was muted in rythmbox.
2010-06-04T14:08:00.000Z	mgolisch	misterB	lol
