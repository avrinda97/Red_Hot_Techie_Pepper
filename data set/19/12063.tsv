2007-05-10T14:09:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	what's the command?  gcc -kernel +hack.c?
2007-05-10T14:10:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	make menuconfig && make  but you know that already:P
2007-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	don't you think makefiles are too advanced for him?
2007-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	I don't think so.  A simple 2-liner will save him a lot of typing
2007-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	a lot of typing he should actually know... not to mention that this way he will never check what flags gcc can handle
2007-05-10T14:40:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	we're not :)
2007-05-10T14:40:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	even once you set the options, none of the VNC software works very well in ubuntu
2007-05-10T14:48:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	he wants 2 VNC servers: one on :0 and one on a new :1
2007-05-10T14:49:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	re-read what he wants
2007-05-10T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	particularly the last 8 words
2007-05-10T14:50:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	I must have missed it... and this channel updates too quickly
2007-05-10T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	he wants one VNC session shared with the person sitting at the console, and one 'private'
2007-05-10T14:51:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	okay, I have no idea what that's supposed to mean
2007-05-10T14:54:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	using a password doesn't help - VNC sends the password in clear text doesn't it?
2007-10-18T15:24:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	nice to see you here as well:)
2007-10-18T15:24:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	so they didn't upgrade synfig for feisty?
2007-10-18T15:25:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	looks like feisty has .05 and gutsy has .06
2007-10-18T15:25:00.000Z	afief	dooglus	current is 0.7 though, isn't it?
2007-10-18T15:25:00.000Z	dooglus	afief	yes, but .06 is still a big improvement on .05
