2011-06-29T06:31:00.000Z	sarkis		yes
2011-06-29T06:31:00.000Z	sarkis	ZykoticK9	i cant know for sure if they are working?
2011-06-29T06:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sarkis	open nvidia-settings it will tell you
2011-06-29T06:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sarkis	i have some more complicated methods to know if the kernel is using the driver or not, but nvidia-settings is MUCH easier
2011-06-29T06:32:00.000Z	sarkis		48584 frames in 5.0 seconds = 9716.609 FPS
2011-06-29T06:32:00.000Z	sarkis		glxgears -_-
2011-06-29T06:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sarkis	glxgears is a terrible non-benchmark - but with that FPS i'd say they are working!
2011-06-29T06:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sarkis	my non-3d nvidia is currently "3342 frames in 5.0 seconds = 668.262 FPS"
