2007-01-29T06:18:00.000Z	poningru		thats set by the hardware
2007-01-29T06:20:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	 here now
2007-01-29T06:20:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	are all the interfaces connected to same router etc.
2007-01-29T06:21:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	no;  one is the lan, the other is straight into the highspeed-modem
2007-01-29T06:21:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	which one is dhcp?
2007-01-29T06:21:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	wan
2007-01-29T06:21:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	how is it possible for them to switch then???
2007-01-29T06:22:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	it's almost like iftab is being used to reconfigure the interfaces rather than just rename them
2007-01-29T06:22:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	but it doesn't look like either interface is promisc
2007-01-29T06:23:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	that is extremely weird
2007-01-29T06:23:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	without being there I dont know what to tell you dude
2007-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	iftab is the right thing to be editing to make sure interfaces come up under the same name, right?
2007-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	well you shouldnt be really editing that
2007-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	as in the system is supposed to handle that
2007-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	um, well, you kinda have to if you've changed interfaces, no it doesn't handle that except on the initial install
2007-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	well right except that is not supposed to be changed at all
2007-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	poningru	cwillu	that is supposed to be set in stone
2007-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	cwillu	poningru	?
