2008-12-29T17:32:00.000Z	Stavros		hello
2008-12-29T17:33:00.000Z	Stavros		what does the slider called "stored in reserved extra space" do in usb-creator?
2008-12-29T17:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 you can have a set of space reserved fpr persistant storage for the user to user that is saved to the card.  for docs and so forth.. its handy. :)
2008-12-29T17:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 i set mine to be 512mb for my casual user. :)
2008-12-29T17:34:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	yes, but what's stored there? what if i don't set anything to that?
2008-12-29T17:34:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	is it the size of the /home dir
2008-12-29T17:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 anything your user changes/adds is stored there.  the thing makes a bootable live-cd thing with persistant storage.. basically. Not the same as a normal install
2008-12-29T17:35:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	hmm yes, but you can still run apt on it and install things, no?
2008-12-29T17:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	  any extra installed packages go there also.
2008-12-29T17:35:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	so it makes sense to set it to as much as i can?
2008-12-29T17:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 using apt-get update/upgrade may or may not cause issues.. since its NOT the same as a full install.
2008-12-29T17:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 yes. I set mine to fill up most all the thumbdrive
2008-12-29T17:36:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	ah, thanks... so if i set it to less, the rest of the space will just be unused and lost, i take it?
2008-12-29T17:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 you may NOT want to run a 'update/upgrade' since that may take up a lot of space.
2008-12-29T17:36:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	ah, thanks
2008-12-29T17:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 you can still mount the thumbdrive and access the space as vfat if you want.. or do like i do and use the TD. also for windows files.
2008-12-29T17:37:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	ah, i see, so it leaves a vfat partition and formats what you specify as ext2, i take it
2008-12-29T17:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stavros	 it has a ext2 filesystem in a file
2008-12-29T17:37:00.000Z	Stavros	dr_willis	thanks for your help
