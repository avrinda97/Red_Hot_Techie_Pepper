2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	nickrud	SAM_theman	as the original installer (password entered during the install) : sudo gedit will work. If not, you have reall, serious issues
2006-06-13T06:39:00.000Z	nickrud	SAM_theman	you got the best info available: the 3653 is not mentioned in the printer database, only the 3650. linuxprinting.org will tell you if the 3650 driver works with the 3653
