2010-01-02T07:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	JMONEY	have you used the alternative install CD ?
2010-01-02T07:50:00.000Z	JMONEY	Samus_Aran	nah
2010-01-02T07:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	JMONEY	and did you check the disc for defects ?
2010-01-02T07:51:00.000Z	JMONEY	Samus_Aran	I can't do that
2010-01-02T08:00:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	JMONEY	the web site also has md5 checksums of all downloads, so if you do a direct download, check that after
2010-01-02T08:01:00.000Z	JMONEY	Samus_Aran	thanks I've tried that too
2010-01-02T08:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	JMONEY	anyhow, the alternate installer is there for everyone that has any issues with the main one.  it's far more fool-proof and bug-free
2010-01-02T08:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	JMONEY	it's just not quite as "pretty"
2010-01-02T08:03:00.000Z	JMONEY	Samus_Aran	aslong I can install Im good
