2010-10-06T22:04:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	Which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-10-06T22:15:00.000Z	rusivi		!maverick | izardstreet
2010-10-06T22:17:00.000Z	jags		sorry rusivi, I just fixed it
2010-10-06T22:17:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	Cool what did you do to fix it?
2010-10-06T22:18:00.000Z	jags		apparently in addition to the bcmwl-kernel-source, I needed the bcmwl-modaliases installed as well
2010-10-06T22:18:00.000Z	jags		then reboot
2010-10-06T22:18:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	Nice job, ty for sharing
2010-10-06T22:19:00.000Z	jags		now if I can just get my notebook to suspend I'll have everything working, atm if I close the lid it will go into suspend, but will never wake up, or rather fans and hd turn on, but no screen
2010-10-06T22:20:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	Can it successfully hibernate?
2010-10-06T22:21:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	I'm not sure, I try and hibernate but it basically shutsdown
2010-10-06T22:21:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	Its the same as if I shutdown the system, don't see a difference
2010-10-06T22:21:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	Hibernation should shut it down, then come back up in the state immediately prior to the hibernate.
2010-10-06T22:22:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	yah i suppose that does work, but if it takes just as long to boot up as to come back from hybernate it seems silly to not just shut it down in the first place
2010-10-06T22:22:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	i'd like to close the lid and come back to it quickly, is that not possible?
2010-10-06T22:23:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	The lid closing then coming back should be possible.
2010-10-06T22:23:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	I can set it to just black out the screen instead, but my battery gets eaten while it runs
2010-10-06T22:23:00.000Z	rusivi	jags	When you try to come back from a standby due to lid close, if you type on the keyboard does the screen recover?
2010-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	no from suspend it never comes back, have to hard reboot it
2010-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	jags	rusivi	I tried ctrl-alt+7 and other terminals didn't seem to do anything
