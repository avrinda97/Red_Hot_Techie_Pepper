2011-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	umm, that's not normal...
2012-03-29T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	just means they're full, no?
2012-03-29T16:24:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	but its an 80gig hdd. ive had it in use for about 2 months. yesturday it was at 50gig free space
2012-03-29T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	well check what's using the space now
2012-03-29T16:25:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	it says its my home directory, but when i look at my home directories subdirectories, none of them equal the 67gigs it claims to be using
2012-03-29T16:26:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	what should i do? im pretty sure the disk usage analysis program that comes with ubuntu has to by lying to me
2012-03-29T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	how are you checking?  What's the output of df -h?
2012-03-29T16:27:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	i had to shut it down because i was afraid something was about to fry because it was moving so slow with 8gig of ram and a quad core
2012-03-29T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	boot a live cd
2012-03-29T16:28:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	now when you say a live cd. u mean the "try ubuntu instead of install" right?
2012-03-29T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	yes, by "live cd" I mean "try ubuntu" option
2012-03-29T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	pastebin the output of « df -h »
2012-03-29T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	where exactly do you see the message about a hard drive being full?
2012-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	the message is gone right now. but before i rebooted, i would get a popup message on my system that says "This computer has 0bytes remaining." then i had the options to Examine, Ignore
2012-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	did you examine?
2012-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	yes, and it opened the ubuntu disk analysis application
2012-03-29T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	acidrain_	if it happens again, come back without closing anything
2012-03-29T16:36:00.000Z	acidrain_	jrib	... yes sir... this is crazy dude
