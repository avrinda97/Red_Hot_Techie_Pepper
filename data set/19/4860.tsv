2008-11-02T19:45:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	I succesfully blanked out my backup file -_-
2008-11-02T19:45:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	But I did manage to find another backup file
2008-11-02T19:46:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	I gedited both files and copied the other backup file to xorg.conf
2008-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	 what can I sya, I'm good at messing things up. I once deleted explorer.exe from windows. Completley
2008-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	 nope.
2008-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	 still in 800x600
2008-11-02T19:48:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	 but at leaast my xorg.conf file isn't empty. Although nothing works
2008-11-02T19:49:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	 looks like I'm going to have to. 8.04 worked perfectly, so I'm going to reinstall it. Oh, and I'm looking to switch completely to Ubuntu. Only using windows at work.
2008-11-02T19:49:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	luckily I don't have too much that I can't just reinstall on here
2008-11-02T19:55:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	I'm on vacations 4 hours from home, but luckily I just appened to have my ubuntu ISO that I could burn
2008-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	so luckily I'll be able to go back to 8.04 today
2008-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	thanks for all your help :)
2008-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	DrthTater	n8tuser	yeah
