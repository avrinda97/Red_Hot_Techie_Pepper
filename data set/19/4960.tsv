2009-03-24T21:51:00.000Z	zer0o		hi guys, i use WICD to connect to my wi-fi router, i tried to set a WEP key to my connection in my router settings webpage (192.168.1.1) and then i set up the same WEP key on my WICD settings, but it wont work... fortunately from another pc i could re-enter the router settings webpage and delete that key. is there any known issue with WICD and WEP keys? shall i try a WAP? am I doin anything wrong? thanks

2009-03-24T21:54:00.000Z	zer0o	dreamy	that was a known issue of Network Manager, just uninstall it completely and install WICD instead, the wifi connection is perfect with it, fast and never falls, as it used to happen with NM. the only thing is, it seems having issues with WEP keys, but u do get connected!

2009-03-24T22:05:00.000Z	zer0o	dreamy	im sorry but i cant find it, but i can tell u what to do, u gotta get rid of Network Manager and its wifi drivers which are some SERIALMONKEY drivers, could be the rtx or the rt73 u gotta do a little search for this one. once u've done with this, u install WICD and the new drivers, u better use the COMPAT-WIRELESS. try to google it, some guide will come up for sure, cuz apparently the wifi linux drivers wont work with some peripheal, such
2009-03-24T22:05:00.000Z	zer0o		as my wi-fi usb pen (my airport) and i guess if u had the same prob, urs is probably in that list. hope i helped :D
