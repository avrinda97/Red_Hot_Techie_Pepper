2007-01-12T12:43:00.000Z	assasukasse		however i must say that it takes age to load at bootup
2007-01-12T12:45:00.000Z	assasukasse		from time to time ubuntu fails to load, tries to run fsck and hangs
2007-01-12T12:45:00.000Z	assasukasse		i reboot then works
2007-01-12T12:45:00.000Z	assasukasse		should i run fsck? and how?
2007-01-12T12:45:00.000Z	stefg	assasukasse	dapper is fast, edgy even faster at boot-up... check the prelink and preload packages , and see what services start up at boot. evms and lvm are smetimes not needed
