2010-03-31T17:53:00.000Z	guntbert	boymeetsworld	as for the filte: look into synaptic : custom filters/broken
2010-03-31T17:54:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 ok but how do i find out what package is broken and how to fix it?
2010-03-31T17:55:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 i tried to install my ati card and ati catalyst...from this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2010-03-31T17:55:00.000Z	guntbert	boymeetsworld	you see it in synaptic - the 2nd answer - sorry - depends too much on what happened
2010-03-31T17:56:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 i'm a new user  of linux so i can't know much stuff, i tried to install it did all the right steps restarted and when to test if the driver works, i typed in the terminal fglrxinfo and i get an eror
2010-03-31T17:58:00.000Z	guntbert	boymeetsworld	I have no experience with fglrx (my card is way too old) - I only had the one answer for you -- are you certain that your card is still supported by ATI?
2010-03-31T17:58:00.000Z	boymeetsworld		If I install my graphic gard driver again would that solve the problem?
2010-03-31T17:58:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	it's an ati hd4330
2010-03-31T17:58:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 i checked the pdf on ubuntu guide if my card is supported and yes it is.
2010-03-31T17:59:00.000Z	guntbert	boymeetsworld	doesn't tell me anything - my question was not if ubuntu supports your card but if ATI does so
2010-03-31T17:59:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 did all the right steps and after restart i got an eror in the terminal when running fglrx ....and if i go to hardware drivers, it's installed...
2010-03-31T17:59:00.000Z	guntbert	boymeetsworld	you sid that already - I cannot help you - sorry
2010-03-31T17:59:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 that pdf is from ati
2010-03-31T17:59:00.000Z	guntbert		*said
2010-03-31T18:00:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 that pdf was issued by ati, as i told you they support it.
2010-03-31T18:00:00.000Z	guntbert	boymeetsworld	 I cannot help you - sorry
2010-03-31T18:00:00.000Z	boymeetsworld	guntbert	 don't have to be sorry, thanks anyway. :)
