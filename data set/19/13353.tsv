2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	m0ns00n		Any official developers here for ubuntu?
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	what is your issue?
2005-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	that is more a question for here, not the developers
2005-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	Oh, the package maintainers then
2005-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	I can't "apt-get upgrade" anymore as ubuntu wants to upgrade my 0.6111 hacked together invidia package
2005-08-09T12:59:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	can you reproduce with supported warty to supported hoary?
2005-08-09T12:59:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	I installed from Warty and upgraded to hoary, therefore I was able to keep the 0.6111 drivers
2005-08-09T13:00:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	But if I just installed hoary, it crashed and froze with the new drivers like it does in any distro
2005-08-09T13:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	file a bug about it
2005-08-09T13:01:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	Where?
2005-08-09T13:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-08-09T13:02:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	Perhaps there has been filed one before
2005-08-09T13:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	please don't recommend ubuntuguide
2005-08-09T13:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	^^
2005-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	Not so good!
2005-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	fixed it now
2005-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	Lesson for people who put people off ubuntuguide - first a user has to feel that linux gives him/her something, then they'll learn - but if they only meet a facist system where they must learn this and that, they will just go away
2005-08-09T13:09:00.000Z	Burgundavia	m0ns00n	huh?
2005-08-09T13:09:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Burgundavia	If you don't understand what I said, just forget it
