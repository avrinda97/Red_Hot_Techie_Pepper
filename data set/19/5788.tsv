2008-05-01T19:03:00.000Z	codemon_		hey, I'm a C# developer and I'm trying out using mono developer on ubuntu, but from the default install it doesn't seem to want to play nice. Any hae much success using mono with c#.net apps?
2008-05-01T19:04:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	which mono version
2008-05-01T19:05:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	well I just downloaded ubunto yesterday and install mono from the package manager
2008-05-01T19:06:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	the mono from apt is very old - you should try the new version 1.9.1    http://swik.net/Mono
2008-05-01T19:08:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	do you do any dev with mono? Can VS 2005 solutions be loaded and built?
2008-05-01T19:08:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	we just cross compile then run the binaries throuhg mono.
2008-05-01T19:10:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	it's really the only thing that has stopped me moving back to linux, but since I'm not keen to go to vista I'm looking for alternatives.
2008-05-01T19:11:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	well then why don't you just port it to c++ ?
2008-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	lol yeah
2008-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	if you are really the codemon then that could be easier to adjust to than vista :)
2008-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	well I make a living writing C# on windows so I'm kind of stuck
2008-05-01T19:13:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	that industry is doomed
2008-05-01T19:13:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	not much demand for linux /c++ dev here
2008-05-01T19:14:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	c#.net sux man
2008-05-01T19:14:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	yeah I prefer c++ but gotta pay the bills somehow
2008-05-01T19:15:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	the problem is that entire industry is under the thumb of microsoft, and this entire open source universe is eating away its market share as fast as possible.  so you should just convert now and be ahead of the curve
2008-05-01T19:17:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	you really see the MS machine ever being taken down, it is the epitome of capitalism
2008-05-01T19:18:00.000Z	hwilde	codemon_	competition and change are the epitome of capitalism.  ms is a stagmant monopoly, which will inevitably die.
2008-05-01T19:20:00.000Z	codemon_	hwilde	one of the big hooks for MS is office. So many businesses are bound to it. Integrating with it is a nightmare, this one of the areas I work in most of the time word and Interop is hell
