2009-01-30T12:02:00.000Z	DamienCassou		I've a font problem when I plug my external 24" monitor (wide). As soon as I use plug it to the laptop, the font becomes unreadable (some characters are replaced by rectangles). I'm on a fresh Ubuntu 8.10. Can somebody help me please?
2009-01-30T12:02:00.000Z	DamienCassou		I've a macbook 4.1 and an intel graphic card
2009-01-30T12:03:00.000Z	mindrape	DamienCassou	sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
2009-01-30T12:04:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	ok, installing. Do I need to do anything else before retrying to plug my monitor?
2009-01-30T12:06:00.000Z	mindrape	DamienCassou	- it could also be that you are trying to use too high a resolution on a graphics card that cant handle it.
2009-01-30T12:06:00.000Z	mindrape	DamienCassou	it may make sense to edit your xorg.conf and bump down the default res to like 1024x768 til you get it working
2009-01-30T12:06:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	I don't think so because it worked on hardy
2009-01-30T12:07:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	there nothing more on the xorg.conf than the virtual resolution
2009-01-30T12:07:00.000Z	mindrape	DamienCassou	lspci -k        see which graphics driver you are presently using.

2009-01-30T12:12:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	thank you. I will try.
2009-01-30T12:24:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	that didn't fix my problem :-(
2009-01-30T12:26:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	in fact, I thought it did work because I didn't have any problems for a few seconds. Then the font became unreadable again. To set-up my dual screen, I use: xrandr --verbose --fb 1680x1850 --output TMDS-1 --auto --output LVDS --auto --below TMDS-1
2009-01-30T12:37:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	did you see that msttcorefont didn't solve my problem?
2009-01-30T12:38:00.000Z	mindrape	DamienCassou	yeah... dunno man.  :(
2009-01-30T12:38:00.000Z	DamienCassou	mindrape	ok. Do you know where I can ask?
