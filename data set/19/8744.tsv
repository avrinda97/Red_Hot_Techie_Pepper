2008-10-22T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	right.  You should use the packages from the repositories.  They set things up for you.  You need to install the sun-java6-plugin package if you want sun's java plugin
2008-10-22T02:55:00.000Z	aflack	jrib	this is under synaptic?
2008-10-22T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	right
2008-10-22T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	tell me the output of this command please: uname -m
2008-10-22T02:58:00.000Z	aflack	jrib	x86_64..
2008-10-22T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	sun does not provide a 64bit java plugin.  Your only options on 64bit are to either use an open java like gcjwebplugin or to install a 32bit firefox as described in !java64
2008-10-22T02:59:00.000Z	aflack	jrib	where can i get a 32bit firefox then
2008-10-22T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	oops, issue was on my end.  That's conky.  Why do you want to compile it?  It's in the repositories
2008-10-22T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	what does that have to do with anything?
2008-10-22T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	tell us the output of: uname -m
2008-10-22T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	tell us the output of: uname -m
2008-10-22T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	now go bug sun about them not providing a java plugin
2008-10-22T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	aflack	sun does not provide a 64bit java plugin for linux.  Either use an open java like gcjwebplugin or install 32bit firefox (see !java64)
