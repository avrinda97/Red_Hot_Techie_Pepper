2009-12-26T22:40:00.000Z	`mOOse`		I want the opposite ActionParsnip1...I'd like all apps to have the ALT-Key combo to be underlined so when you choose, the menu for that corresponding set of command drops down, like in all the default gnome pgms like Terminal, etc...you know, if you hit ALT-F in Terminal you get the File menu etc...not all pgms do it and I want them to be able to
2009-12-26T22:41:00.000Z	`mOOse`		not all of them no unfortunately...I think it might be hard-coded into each app, and some pgmers don't see the need I guess
2009-12-26T22:42:00.000Z	`mOOse`		on a laptop (and I admit I prefer the keys over the mouse anyways - old DOS/Unix guy here) it's a PITA to use the touchpad
2009-12-26T22:43:00.000Z	`mOOse`		sure zagnut easy
2009-12-26T22:43:00.000Z	`mOOse`		highly recommended :-)
2009-12-26T22:44:00.000Z	zagnut	`mOOse`	so the installer does it for you?
2009-12-26T22:44:00.000Z	zagnut		awesome :)
2009-12-26T22:44:00.000Z	zagnut		*downloading the latest releast*
2009-12-26T22:44:00.000Z	zagnut		*release
2009-12-26T22:44:00.000Z	zagnut		wait, should I download the latest, or the latest LTS?
2009-12-26T22:44:00.000Z	`mOOse`		weeellll....I would read up on dual booting if I were you but it's common, and the tools are easy to use
2009-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	zagnut		I'm honestly not looking for latest/greatest anymore, I'm in school full-time and working. I don't have time to just fiddle with linux anymor
2009-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	`mOOse`	zagnut	yer in the right channel (ubuntu) but now you have to decide - gnome or kde...that's the $100 question ;-)
2009-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	zagnut		actually, I'll probably just install a server CLI environment
2009-12-26T22:46:00.000Z	zagnut		and then install a lightweight fluxbox environment
2009-12-26T22:46:00.000Z	`mOOse`		lol - NOH!
2009-12-26T22:46:00.000Z	`mOOse`		you have to leave now!
2009-12-26T22:46:00.000Z	`mOOse`		;-)
