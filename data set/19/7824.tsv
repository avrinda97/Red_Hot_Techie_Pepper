2007-07-16T08:19:00.000Z	gerro		anyone know how to enable/disable irq polling in grub startup scripts? someone mentioned I need that since I have frequent freeze ups
2007-07-16T08:20:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	irq=useirqmask???
2007-07-16T08:33:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	okay thx but any idea what difference between irqpoll and irq=poll is?
2007-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	where would I insert that into grubs menu.lst?
2007-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	i beleve its on the SINGLE commented line that says something like "kopt= uuid=2398waejkawe"
2007-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	then do "sudo update-grub"
2007-07-16T08:27:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	ah someone posted example of irq=poll on forum hmm part you mentioned of menu.lst is currently commented out for me
2007-07-16T08:27:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	should be. see how the double comments and the comments are different? the single are for "update-grub"
2007-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	after I add irq=poll to end of that line do I have to type update-grub as root?
2007-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	yes.
2007-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	would rebooting do the same?
2007-07-16T08:30:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	nope.
2007-07-16T08:40:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	turns out on menu.lst I have irq=poll at bottom by kernel images to load, however on forums people have said to use irqpoll
2007-07-16T08:41:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	well, im not entiarly sure, so...
2007-07-16T08:41:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	debating on if I should change irq=poll or just add irqpoll in
2007-07-16T08:42:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	try to change it.
2007-07-16T08:42:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	if all else fails, change it back to the origianl at the boot propmt for grub.
2007-07-16T08:43:00.000Z	gerro	jamman	I left the recovery mode settings alone
2007-07-16T08:43:00.000Z	jamman	gerro	not a bad idea.
