2007-02-28T15:32:00.000Z	n-iCe		works in xubuntu ?
2007-02-28T15:32:00.000Z	n-iCe		good , thank you
2007-02-28T15:32:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	limewire uses the gnutella network, there are LOTS of gnutella clients available as well
2007-02-28T15:34:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	did you download the deb file, and then type "cd ~/Desktop" like the page tell you to
2007-02-28T15:39:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	is trying to install frostwire which is not in the ubuntu repositories, he just has to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire go there and follow the directions
2007-02-28T15:40:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	go here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire and follow the instructions
2007-02-28T15:46:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	up to you, we can't tell you which player you'll like best
2007-02-28T16:02:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	reading some of the ubuntu/xbuntu guides might help you more then asking millions of questions in here
2007-03-05T07:34:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	another vote for mpd, you can also try exaile, listen, banshee, etc
2007-03-05T07:34:00.000Z	n-iCe	kelsin	 how can i downlaod mpd , sudo apt-get install mpd ?
2007-03-05T07:35:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	yes, mpd might be tough though, it's a server program... if you are unfamiliar with linux might want to try listen, banshee, or amarok (kde) before mpd
2007-03-05T07:37:00.000Z	n-iCe	kelsin	 now how can i open it?
2007-03-05T07:38:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	taht's what I was trying to tell you, start out with "listen" or "banshee" or the rythembox mp3 player included with gnome before mpd
2007-03-05T07:38:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	mpd is "Music Player Daemon" it's a daemon that sits in the background you need to install another client to use it, and edit some config files to point you to your mp3 player
2007-03-05T07:38:00.000Z	kelsin	n-iCe	use synaptic to uninstall it by right clicking and select mark for removal
