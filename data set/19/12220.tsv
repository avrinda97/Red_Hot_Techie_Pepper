2007-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	swanyl		ok no difference with the sound but the startup sound only played twice.... dunno what its suppoed to do
2007-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	'cat /proc/cmdline'?
2007-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	'uname -a'?
2007-03-22T09:41:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	hello, what do you get from 'uname -a'?
2007-03-22T09:42:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	it's not enough to make a change to a file in an editor. You have to also save it before it can take effect.
2007-03-22T09:43:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	what update?
2007-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	'sudo update-grub' -- did this return any messages?
2007-03-22T09:49:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	how many lines of output from 'grep pci=noacpi /boot/grub/menu.lst'?
2007-03-22T09:50:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	this is the one where you were supposed to put it. But the update hasn't worked. Let's do it another way:
2007-03-22T09:53:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	'cd /tmp ; wget http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11520/plain/ ; sudo cp index.html /boot/grub/menu.lst'
2007-03-22T09:55:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	how many lines of output from 'grep pci=noacpi /boot/grub/menu.lst'? No paste please.
2007-03-22T09:56:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	the last one starting with 'kernel'?
2007-03-22T09:56:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	excellent. If it doesn't work after a reboot now, I'm gonna have to give up.
2007-03-22T09:59:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	just reboot
2007-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	'cat /proc/cmdline'?
2007-03-22T10:05:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	well, the change has gone through this time, but it obviously doesn't make a difference. Did you try the sound after booting from the desktop CD?
2007-03-22T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	I'm just looking at bug reports on launchpad. There seems to be one similar
2007-03-22T10:10:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/94333
2007-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	soundray	swanyl	there are a few guys here who are better than I with sound. Try asking again in the evening (GMT).
