2008-04-30T18:42:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	what's the card model number?
2008-04-30T18:42:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	hold on, it's booting...I'll have more information in a second
2008-04-30T18:47:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	ok, lspci says: 00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)
2008-04-30T19:20:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	I think I may have found you a solution

2008-04-30T19:22:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	Basically, you want to do this at a terminal: sudo cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst.backup && nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-04-30T19:22:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	yes, I've read this post many times
2008-04-30T19:23:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	oh :-/
2008-04-30T19:23:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	no luck?
2008-04-30T19:23:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	well, I want to get Internet working on the LiveCD before I install...
2008-04-30T19:23:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	so I can't try messing with grub unless I actually install
2008-04-30T19:24:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	oh... well, that might be tricky
2008-04-30T19:24:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	I don't know for sure, but that might not be possible then
2008-04-30T19:25:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	so I guess I should just install and hope for the best?
2008-04-30T19:25:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	what's the worst that could happen... if you decide you don't want it, you can boot off the live-cd and resize your windows partition back to normal
2008-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	this is true...but for some reason gparted doesn't work off the hardy CD...I think I'm going to grab the gparted livecd and try that
2008-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	it just sits there at "resizing" and does absolutely nothing
2008-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	Vlet	luinfana	I've noticed the same, but the actual installer has never failed me (as far as resizing goes)
2008-04-30T19:28:00.000Z	luinfana	Vlet	OK then...install commencing.
