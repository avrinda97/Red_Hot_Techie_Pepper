2010-04-12T05:14:00.000Z	chibihogoshino		how would i go back to a older kernel version if the new one wont let me boot ?
2010-04-12T05:14:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	did you custom compile?
2010-04-12T05:17:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	you might boot from live cd and then mount your hard drive and move the bad kernel out and put the new one in
2010-04-12T05:18:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	i tryed that.. the new kernel is the bad one .. and when i boot from when i did that it comes up with the blue screen debien error where it has you need to load the kernel first .. press enter
2010-04-12T05:19:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	do you know the location of the "good" kernel
2010-04-12T05:19:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	yeah.. its in the same dir as the other one
2010-04-12T05:20:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	IIRC you should be able to just issue the command boot /dev/slice/kernel
2010-04-12T05:20:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	let me check
2010-04-12T05:21:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	from a live cd ?
2010-04-12T05:22:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	You "should" be able to tell the loader where your kernel is but if you boot from live ccd you can just mount the drive and go move the file
2010-04-12T05:22:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	how will grub know that to use the older kernel ?
2010-04-12T05:23:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	If you have grub setup then you dont need to go through all these hoops man
2010-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	aaa  so it should auto detect the other images ?
2010-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	you should be able to press esc or shift while its booting up to get the grub menu
2010-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	aaa thanks.. i didnt know about the holding shift down..
2010-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	right on! you should be able to get fixed up from there w/e got screwed up
2010-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	 thanks for your help..   its working now..
2010-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	craniumslows	chibihogoshino	2 fer 2 woo hoo
2010-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	chibihogoshino	craniumslows	 keep rocking
