2009-05-31T20:32:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	its poor 3D support
2009-05-31T20:32:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	poor?
2009-05-31T20:32:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	not full 3D support
2009-05-31T20:33:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	no. The -ati driver has full accelerated 3D support for the ATi X1300
2009-05-31T20:35:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	link would be nice, where i got my info from: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
2009-05-31T20:37:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	read http://www.x.org/wiki/radeon
2009-05-31T20:40:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	Radeon 7000 - X1950: *well* supported in both 2D and 3D by the free drivers (ie. Radeon driver 6.9.0 and Mesa 7.2)
2009-05-31T20:40:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	yes that is correct
2009-05-31T20:41:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	I was saying that it isn't Fully supported. Anything well supported isn't as well as you'd hope
2009-05-31T20:42:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	err full == well
2009-05-31T20:42:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	what exactly is your point here?
2009-05-31T20:43:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	"well" in my case, was it didn't work. I have an X1300
2009-05-31T20:44:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	I am sitting right next to a machine with the X1300 currently, tested with both the radeon and radeonhd drivers (which both work). If it wasn't working on your machine it was a configuration error as the radeon drivers _definitely_ support that card
2009-05-31T20:45:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	you tried running Nexuiz ?
2009-05-31T20:46:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	no, but I have played other 3D games
2009-05-31T20:46:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	Nexuiz just crashes....so do alot of other games.....wait X1300 mobility or the regular X1300 ?
2009-05-31T20:47:00.000Z	ziroday	shiznebit	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc M52 [Mobility Radeon X1300]
2009-05-31T20:48:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	well it works correctly for me with the bleeding-edge drivers. yes,  i have compiz off ...
2009-05-31T20:48:00.000Z	shiznebit	ziroday	hopefully he wont have problems
