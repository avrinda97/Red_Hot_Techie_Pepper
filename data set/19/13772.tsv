2005-11-06T16:02:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	google answers most questions asked in this channel ;)
2005-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	np at all ofcourse :) it was just a friendly advice =)
2005-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	Casanova	thenuke	thank you :-)
2005-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	from the page I gave the url for.. "After some playing around, I found the best way to run my startup script was to add it at the end of: /etc/init.d/rcS.sh"   I think that is the best way to do it :o
2005-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	so you do sudo nano /etc/init.d/rcS.sh and on the last line you add the script you want to run like.. /home/casanova/myscript
2005-11-06T16:05:00.000Z	Casanova	thenuke	its just 1 line... can iu just add that line direct.. rather than the file name?
2005-11-06T16:05:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	oh, yes you can.
2005-11-06T16:05:00.000Z	Casanova	thenuke	i dont have /etc/init.d/rcS.sh i only have /etc/init.d/rcS is it the same?
2005-11-06T16:06:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	I am not sure :) let mee check it a bit
2005-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	yes that seems to be the same I think
2005-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	Casanova	thenuke	i am having one more problem too... the /dev/dsp device is not given enough permission at boot up... i have to do "sudo chmod 777 /dev/dsp" on every boot to let the normal users use the sound card
2005-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	Casanova	thenuke	is there a more elegant solution to it?
2005-11-06T16:08:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	yes there is.. you need to give your users privileges to use that.. and that is done  like ummmmm hmmmmm hmmm :)
2005-11-06T16:09:00.000Z	thenuke	Casanova	let's change to privatemessages
