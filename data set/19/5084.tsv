2008-11-25T16:24:00.000Z	reqqit		I have an old machine, I ripped the motherboard, cpu, ram and graphics card out, and put in new ones. The Ubuntu 8.04 on my original disk works PERFECTLY in this new setup - not a single hitch
2008-11-25T16:24:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	welcome to linux
2008-11-25T16:25:00.000Z	reqqit		However, I tried the 8.10 live CD, and whereas before it worked, on my current, new setup (HD monitor, intel chipset, nvidia graphics card) the monitor is 'fuzzy' and waving... like the horizontal refresh is off
2008-11-25T16:26:00.000Z	reqqit		Yeah, I was impressed it worked - just the live CD for 8.10 has a problem, perhaps because of my HD monitor? What could cause the fuzzy waviness that makes the screen unreadable on the live CD ? I could do a live update or stick to 8.04 for now
2008-11-25T16:26:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	you might need to adjust the horiz-sync setting in your xorg.conf file to match that of your monitor ( check the lable on the back)
2008-11-25T16:27:00.000Z	reqqit		This machine originally had feisty installed, or was it gusty? around 3 years ago, and has upgraded to 8.04 since then at every point
2008-11-25T16:27:00.000Z	reqqit	Pelo	can I do that on the LIVE CD?
2008-11-25T16:27:00.000Z	reqqit		do I need to add a boot option when launching?
2008-11-25T16:28:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	you could but it's messy, boot the recovery mode instead, drop in to root mode, the file you want is   /etc/X11/xorg.conf  , that'S X eleven, not X LL , and note the capitals. linux is case sensitive
2008-11-25T16:29:00.000Z	reqqit	Pelo	I've edited my xconf plenty of times in the good old SuSE 6.0 days, I am not entirely new to this - but just to ubuntu recovery modes - it isn't my fault ubuntu keeps working without any problems... if it would just break once in a while I'd learn something.
2008-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	reqqit		Perhaps an idea to add to launchpad? random crashes to improve the learning of users? We could call it 'windows'.
2008-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	I knwo what you mean ;-)
2008-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	you can edit the xorg file from the live cd if you want, just make sure you edit tthe one on the actualy hdd and not the one from the live cd session
2008-11-25T16:31:00.000Z	reqqit	Pelo	erm, the one on the HDD works fine. The one on the live cd session doesn't work
2008-11-25T16:31:00.000Z	reqqit		if that makes sense. I can boot and all is ok, but if I put the 8.10 CD for live install, it doesn't work. 8.04 works, I can boot, old system is 100%, but live CD b0rks at my l33t monitor
2008-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	ah,  well , the edit won't last throught a reboot unfortunately,  and I don'T know if you can just restart X on the live cd,  you can try giving it a try
2008-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	reqqit		so, edit the one on the live session CD? or run it in text mode or alternative mode?
2008-11-25T16:33:00.000Z	Pelo	reqqit	you do know you can use the alt cd to do an upgrade right ? won'T need to reinstall the whole thing
2008-11-25T16:33:00.000Z	reqqit	Pelo	yeah, I'll try alt
