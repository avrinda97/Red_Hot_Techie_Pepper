2005-09-26T15:18:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	could you explain how upstream translations get integrated in to the language packages? (I'm a member of the DutchTeam)
2005-09-26T15:18:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	right now they have to be updated in the source package first
2005-09-26T15:18:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	later you can throw them into Rosetta
2005-09-26T15:19:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	I will build new language packs soon anyway
2005-09-26T15:19:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	so now i should update the my upstream translations manually in Rosetta?
2005-09-26T15:20:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	either that, or update the source package; the latter will always work
2005-09-26T15:20:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	but if they are upstream, why not just do a new release and ask us to package it?
2005-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	i'll have to ask the upstream-maintainer?
2005-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	oh, I thought you are an upstream for a package; of course you can also send the translations directly to him
2005-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	but uploading them into Rosetta is easiest for now
2005-09-26T15:22:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	thanx ... already filed a bug in Malone though ... should I clear it?
2005-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	not necessary, adding the translations to the source package is a good idea anyway
2005-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	what about the ubuntu additions to gnome which don't have(?) public sources and aren't in Rosetta (like 'update-manager')?
2005-09-26T15:27:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	hmm, if they are not in rosetta, that's a bug
2005-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	I ask carlos about it
2005-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	i'll try to make a list
2005-09-26T15:30:00.000Z	pitti	ronalde	carlos just told me that it is there
2005-09-26T15:31:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	ok ... ubuntu's world is a fast world indeed! I'll continue to try the other packages... thanks!
2005-09-26T15:38:00.000Z	ronalde	pitti	"Administrator help needed. gnome-app-install has not yet been setup for translation through Rosetta."
