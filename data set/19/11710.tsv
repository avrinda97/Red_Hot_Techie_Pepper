2005-12-16T15:20:00.000Z	eksajm		hey guys i have a question about dhcp.
2005-12-16T15:20:00.000Z	eksajm		my router can reserve a internal ip, why doesnt this work for me
2005-12-16T15:21:00.000Z	eksajm		i get different internal ips allt he time
2005-12-16T15:21:00.000Z	eksajm		does the hostname change for my ubunto box
2005-12-16T15:21:00.000Z	eksajm		cause ot works for all other OSs
2005-12-16T15:22:00.000Z	eksajm		but why not for this.
2005-12-16T15:22:00.000Z	eksajm		does ubuntu change some variable in the name every time?
2005-12-16T15:22:00.000Z	eksajm		just the one with ubuntu
2005-12-16T15:23:00.000Z	dooglus	eksajm	it's possibly that the dhcp client isn't telling the dhcp server what hostname it wants to be known as
2005-12-16T15:23:00.000Z	eksajm	dooglus	how do i fix it?
2005-12-16T15:24:00.000Z	dooglus	eksajm	what I did was tell my router to only assign IP addresses from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199 and then told ubuntu to use static address 192.168.1.200
2005-12-16T15:24:00.000Z	dooglus	eksajm	so basically dodged the issue by using an unused static ip
2005-12-16T15:24:00.000Z	eksajm	dooglus	oh.
2005-12-16T15:25:00.000Z	dooglus	eksajm	sure, if your router is happy with keeping some addresses aside.  you wouldn't want the router giving the ip you use to another machine
2005-12-16T15:25:00.000Z	eksajm	dooglus	no but my router is kidn of smart, and only uses the first numbers if they are availible
2005-12-16T15:26:00.000Z	dooglus	eksajm	so in the network properties, select 'static' instead of DHCP
2005-12-16T15:26:00.000Z	eksajm	dooglus	fixed-adress 192-.168..; in dhcpclient.conf file?
2005-12-16T15:26:00.000Z	dooglus	eksajm	don't run a dhcp client at all...
2005-12-16T15:26:00.000Z	eksajm	dooglus	 okey
