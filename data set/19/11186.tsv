2006-11-15T16:39:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		aside from ekiga?
2006-11-15T16:41:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		anyone?
2006-11-15T16:42:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		anyone know of some video chatting software aside from ekiga?
2006-11-15T16:43:00.000Z	ithicine	tuxtheslacker	aMSN has some webcam support for MSN chatting
2006-11-15T16:43:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	ithicine	thanks
2006-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		hey, in amsn, how do I see my webcam to test if it's working?
2006-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	ithicine	are you there? if so, can you tell me how to check if amsn accepts my webcam?
2006-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	ithicine	tuxtheslacker	sort of here... busy atm
2006-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	ithicine		one sec
2006-11-15T16:51:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	ithicine	when you get back, how can I tell if my webcam is working with AMSN?
2006-11-15T16:52:00.000Z	ithicine	tuxtheslacker	your webcam just needs to be supported by v4l, I believe... video4linux.  Do you already have your camera set up?
2006-11-15T16:53:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	ithicine	yep how do  Icheck it though?
2006-11-15T16:54:00.000Z	ithicine		hrm... checking it, I don't quite remember.  I'm not in Linux as the moment as I'm playing EVE Online.  I think there's a configuration thing *somewhere*, but it's been ages since I used it
2006-11-15T16:55:00.000Z	ithicine		just a min, I'll be able to take a look around online in a minute
2006-11-15T16:57:00.000Z	ithicine	tuxtheslacker	I think you just might have to get a contact on your MSN list to accept video
2006-11-15T16:58:00.000Z	ithicine	tuxtheslacker	if they see you, great... and if not, there's more troubleshooting to be done
2006-11-15T16:59:00.000Z	ithicine	tuxtheslacker	after finishing this mission in EVE, I can quit that and help out a touch more if needed.  Burning an Edgy disc then :)
