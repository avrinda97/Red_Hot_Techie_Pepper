2008-10-16T15:25:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	i know about that, and that is not what i am looking for. that would require me to set up ubuntu on each and everyone of the machines.
2008-10-16T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	of you could use dd with the hard drives to copy the data from dive to drive, essentially cloning it
2008-10-16T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	i think you'd have to setup grub thought
2008-10-16T15:26:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	no thats not what i want either. dd clones empty spaces too, and i would have to set up grup. the images would be huge.
2008-10-16T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	you could set up a local repository on your network to distribute update packages
2008-10-16T15:28:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	i think  you are misunderstanding me. I have 70 machines with empty hard drives. All are the same. And i am gonig to deploy ubuntu on them, the same setup.
2008-10-16T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	id use something commercial then, norton ghost server is sweet imho
2008-10-16T15:30:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	I use acronis, it practily does the same. But if i take a image of a ubuntu setup then i have to manually edit the hostname and jon the directory etc etc. Thats a bit of a hassle. Im looking for something like sysprep in windows, that ill just prompt me for hostname when i have deployed the image and stated the computer
2008-10-16T15:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	i get what you mean, we used ghostwalk to change host names, you could use ssh to each pc but its still a ball ache, you could script it
2008-10-16T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	im not sue if it works on linux, we used it on NT
2008-10-16T15:35:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	im going to look into it though.
2008-11-05T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	i thought that was standard
2008-11-05T19:16:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	what was standard?

2008-11-05T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	i always type my domain name\username when i login
2008-11-05T19:17:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	for me, its not a problem. But i want to make it is easy as possibel for the users.
2008-11-05T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benedikt_	that link should help
2008-11-05T19:18:00.000Z	benedikt_	ActionParsnip	ill try it. i used the likewise stuff to join the domain.
