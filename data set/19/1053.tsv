2011-05-28T17:50:00.000Z	anddam		where should I look for wifi log? I'm in installer and it's not connecting to wifi WEP network, I'd like to see why
2011-05-28T17:50:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	Somewhere around /var/log, for sure
2011-05-28T17:50:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	that I figured :-)
2011-05-28T17:51:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	The root password isn't used in ubuntu, please use sudo.
2011-05-28T17:52:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	just noticed
2011-05-28T17:52:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	Weird right? xD
2011-05-28T17:53:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	it's really system dependent, I remember there is a system against the usage of sudo
2011-05-28T17:54:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	Gentoo?
2011-05-28T18:00:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	syslog helped, probably wireless chipset isn't supported
2011-05-28T18:00:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k
2011-05-28T18:03:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	Okay, just "sudo modprobe ath9k"
2011-05-28T18:04:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	it's already loaded, gnome menubar show the wireless icon, the point is NetworkManager can't connect to WEP network
2011-05-28T18:04:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	*shrug* get wicd?
2011-05-28T18:04:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	neverheard
2011-05-28T18:05:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	It's a wireless/ethernet network manager for GTK
2011-05-28T18:06:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	Do try wicd, it's often the only networkmanager that connects to wireless thingies
2011-05-28T18:06:00.000Z	anddam	theadmin	how does it do the magic?
2011-05-28T18:07:00.000Z	theadmin	anddam	You can get the package from packages.ubuntu.com anytime
