2010-01-06T16:19:00.000Z	Slart	meway	try wineconsole
2010-01-06T16:19:00.000Z	Slart	meway	ouch.. never run wine as root.. never.. ever

2010-01-06T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	meway	I'm not really sure what you're trying to do.. you might want to ask in #winehq instead.. that's the offical wine support channel
2010-03-01T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	meway	this might work       for a in $(ls); do mv $a `echo $a | sed 's/\(.*\)\..*/\1/'`; done
2010-03-01T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	meway	oh... but brjann's looks much more elegant.. doh
