2007-11-05T00:50:00.000Z	scguy318	sawyer_	this is for sound?
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	sawyer_	scguy318	it's sort of simple. had feisty. removed esd for pulseaudio and jack. some stuff work, some don't. removed pulse, left with alsa. updated to gutsy and i wanna reinstall esd.
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	sawyer_	scguy318	yeah
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	scguy318	sawyer_	should be a simple matter of sudo apt-get install esd
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	sawyer_	scguy318	yes did that but i don't have any init.d scripts for esd
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	sawyer_	scguy318	and problems still exist
2007-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	scguy318	sawyer_	like?
2007-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	sawyer_	scguy318	skype gives an "audio capture error", rezound doesn't play anything, audacity can't record.
2007-11-05T00:53:00.000Z	scguy318	sawyer_	not too sure unfortunately
2007-11-05T00:54:00.000Z	sawyer_	scguy318	well thanks for trying anyway :)
