2006-06-04T16:15:00.000Z	bolsh		Hi
2006-06-04T16:15:00.000Z	bolsh		Just upgraded from Breezy to Dapper final
2006-06-04T16:16:00.000Z	bolsh		and I have noticed a couple of issues
2006-06-04T16:16:00.000Z	bolsh		On a PPC
2006-06-04T16:16:00.000Z	bolsh		First, in rhyhtmbox, DnD to add albums to playlists doesn't work for some disks
2006-06-04T16:16:00.000Z	bolsh		Very odd
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	bolsh		Second, I have a blue pixel on the screen that wasn't there before...
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	bolsh		Oh - and xchat-gnome got uninstalled
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	Fujitsu	bolsh	sounds like a dead pixel.
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	bolsh	Fujitsu	Due to the upgrade?
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	bolsh	Fujitsu	It was fine before, and is fine under OSX
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	Fujitsu	bolsh	due to a hardware failure.
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	Fujitsu	bolsh	oh.
2006-06-04T16:17:00.000Z	Fujitsu	bolsh	only one pixel?
2006-06-04T16:18:00.000Z	bolsh	Fujitsu	Yeah
2006-06-04T16:18:00.000Z	Fujitsu	bolsh	what video card?
2006-06-04T16:19:00.000Z	bolsh	Fujitsu	The one that comes with a mac mini :)
2006-06-04T16:19:00.000Z	Fujitsu	bolsh	that's not very helpful.
2006-06-04T16:23:00.000Z	bolsh	Fujitsu	Let me look in the device manager
