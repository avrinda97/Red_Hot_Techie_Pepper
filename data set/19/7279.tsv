2007-09-16T07:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	your username and password
2007-09-16T07:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	what problem is that?
2007-09-16T07:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	wait have you installed the actaull os and have decided to boot the hd through the cd than that means you use the username and pass that you created
2007-09-16T07:25:00.000Z	Sidius	Pirate_Hunter	I downloaded ubuntu iso image bunrnt it and boot from it to see desktop and start installation on my hard disk
2007-09-16T07:26:00.000Z	Sidius	Pirate_Hunter	yes, right
2007-09-16T07:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	if the cd is askign you for password than scrap it and downlaod it again from the ubuntu site... otherwise if you installing the os than it will ask for you to create a password and username to use but that doesnt seem to be the case here
2007-09-16T07:29:00.000Z	Sidius	Pirate_Hunter	i downloaded it from ubuntu site, and u see, i cant download it again cos i have traffic limits
2007-09-16T07:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	one last question i hope you havent passworded you bios like i did cause if ubuntu need to write or do anything on the bios that wil stop it, probably thats why you're being asked for pass but than this is just theoretical thinking
2007-09-16T07:30:00.000Z	Sidius	Pirate_Hunter	i didnt passworded my bios), and can i request free cd if i live in ukraine
2007-09-16T07:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	well linux ubuntu is worldwide you're just going to have to find out
2007-09-16T07:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	still its weird its asking for pass to load the cd, are you the admin on the comp you're trying to install ubuntu to?
2007-09-16T07:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	what ubuntu version are you installing, im guessing feisty fawn 7.04 but i could be wrong, i always insatll with the laternate CD since its text base but yeah you cna install wihtout the desktop
2007-09-16T07:35:00.000Z	Sidius	Pirate_Hunter	yes i think i have feistyfawn 7.04 so how can install ubuntu without loading dekstop?
2007-09-16T07:38:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	sidius did you read what ive typed to nrx?
2007-09-16T07:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	dont worry ill post again it was meant for you
2007-09-16T07:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	im goign to ahve to check that since you not using the alternate Cd but if im correct all you have to do is press escape to go to command line than you must know the commands to do the installation which i have never tried
2007-09-16T07:40:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Sidius	if you're planning to do it that way google is your friend and soemone more experienced than me :(
