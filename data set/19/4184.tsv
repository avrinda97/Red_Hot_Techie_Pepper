2009-06-10T14:13:00.000Z	krishmish		slart: are u there?
2009-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	krishmish		can someone tell me how i can login into a ubuntu machin as a user from a windows box?
2009-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	juxta	krishmish	on the console? or using a GUI?
2009-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	 using gui
2009-06-10T14:16:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	configured between 2 ubuntu machines
2009-06-10T14:16:00.000Z	juxta	krishmish	you'll need to look into install vnc or one of the similar programs on the ubuntu machine if you want remote desktop access
2009-06-10T14:17:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	vnc i know
2009-06-10T14:17:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	but i dont want desktop sharing
2009-06-10T14:17:00.000Z	juxta	krishmish	if you use the tightvnc package, you can setup multiple desktops
2009-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	i ubuntu machine should offer a user customised desktop...and the same for the same user at all times
2009-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	 like as in between 2 ubuntu machines
2009-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	i go to system>administration>login window
2009-06-10T14:19:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	click the remote tab and set the style to "same as local"
2009-06-10T14:19:00.000Z	juxta	krishmish	I don't have a whole lot of knowledge re vnc - I've only used it on server machines, so I probably can't offer too much help
2009-06-10T14:20:00.000Z	juxta		but there's a tightvnc package which allows you to have multiple desktops
2009-06-10T14:20:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	 and from the guest machine at the login terminal i go to options and choose connect via XDMCP
2009-06-10T14:20:00.000Z	krishmish	juxta	 well thats okay
