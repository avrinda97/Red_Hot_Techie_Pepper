2008-01-02T06:34:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise		is it a bad idea do mount /dev/sda4 to /home/user and /dev/sda1 to /home/user/folder ?
2008-01-02T06:35:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	that's perfectly valid
2008-01-02T06:35:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	ty
2008-01-02T06:43:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	yeah I was just thinking about this... not sure how that works
2008-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	did you have a problem or didn't try yet?
2008-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	is that a yeah it will always go in order?
2008-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	yeah I agree it probably mounts intelligently
2008-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	if the mounts are not in the right order, the second mount hides the first
2008-01-02T06:45:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	mount must know upper level directories need mounted first
2008-01-02T06:45:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	so if the mounts do not go in the right order, I have to unmount and remount in the correct order. Havent tried it "live" yet. Still messing with truecrypt and partition encryption
2008-01-02T06:46:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	no I'm saying it will work correctly no matter the order in fstab
2008-01-02T06:46:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	so the problem must have been because I mounted them manually, in the wrong order then huh?
2008-01-02T06:47:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	yes by hand you would need to do it in the correct order, but on boot or with mount -a, mount will figure it out
2008-01-02T06:48:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	cool, so now I just gotta make sure the truecrypt volume mounts properly and I have 55GB of high security encrypted bliss :D
2008-01-02T07:33:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	if I can get the mount order down, I got it, finally!
2008-01-02T07:28:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	basically rc.local unless you make a daemon in which case update-rc.d
2008-01-02T07:29:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	oh yeah, rc.local will run last so if you need the order listen to rjs
2008-01-02T07:30:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	astro76	ty also. boy, encrypting a /home partition is no small task!
2008-01-02T07:31:00.000Z	astro76	WorkingOnWise	it is so complicated, there are over 10 howtos on the wiki :O https://help.ubuntu.com/community/?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=encrypt&titlesearch=Titles
