2010-04-02T04:25:00.000Z	neohaven		I have a bit of a weird problem I haven't encountered before.
2010-04-02T04:25:00.000Z	neohaven		I need to move my windows partitions across disks.
2010-04-02T04:26:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	you can use dd for that
2010-04-02T04:26:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	won't that mess up the part tables?
2010-04-02T04:27:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	no ... you create the partitions before you copy and then reinstall your boot loader
2010-04-02T04:27:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	the drive I'm going to move the windows parts to is bigger than the original. could I just dd the whole drive then resize the partition?
2010-04-02T04:28:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	yes, as long as its bigger its ok
2010-04-02T04:28:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	if you were moving to a smaller drive you'd have to resize the filesystem before the partition
2010-04-02T04:29:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	you can also consider making a backup with dd of the windows partition before the move
2010-04-02T04:31:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	the windows part is 160GB, I'm moving to a 250. I am obviously gonna try and boot off the 250 before wiping the 160 :P
2010-04-02T04:31:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	that won't prove anything
2010-04-02T04:31:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	I meant ripping out the 160 and trying to boot off ot it and running stuff.
2010-04-02T04:32:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	oh right, you're correct
2010-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	is there a block size that would speed things up? I remember reading 512, but I also remember people saying about 4k blocks a while ago...
2010-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	dd doesn't change block sizes
2010-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	I mean, the bs= argument.
2010-04-02T04:36:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	i assure you i have no legitimate ties to bs
2010-04-02T04:36:00.000Z	repo_man	neohaven	use the default
2010-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	neohaven	repo_man	it's working, the part table has been copied. Thanks. :)
