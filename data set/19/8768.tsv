2007-02-11T17:38:00.000Z	mynick		if you want to know which ubuntu you are running you are running 6th month 06 year release
2007-02-11T17:38:00.000Z	mynick		its a lot easier to know what that release means than to go, okay in 2001 i was running ubuntu 1.23.3542.3-mybutt
2007-02-11T17:40:00.000Z	mynick		for me its install, install packages, done
2007-02-11T17:40:00.000Z	mynick		i don't really understand what is there to configure
2007-02-11T17:41:00.000Z	mynick		ah that, don't know bro, i don't use that.  is that TRULLY a show stopper?
2007-02-11T17:41:00.000Z	mynick		how about you config that when you have time?
2007-02-11T17:42:00.000Z	mynick		i one day just switched everything
2007-02-11T17:42:00.000Z	mynick		it forced me to learn NOW, instead of taking forever
2007-02-11T17:42:00.000Z	mynick		in the end i completely dropped windows
2007-02-11T17:43:00.000Z	mynick		i don't see yo complaining about paying $400 for vista when it borks?
2007-02-11T17:43:00.000Z	yodude	mynick	it didn't work
2007-02-11T17:45:00.000Z	yodude	mynick	replacing it didn't work it said again that it is not set up correctly
2007-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	mynick	yodude	oh okay ... so uninstall nvidia drivers next , then do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and select vesa for your drivers.  that will get you an x session and you can go from there
2007-02-11T17:49:00.000Z	yodude	mynick	just two questions: since i'm gonna be using a command line:
2007-02-11T17:55:00.000Z	mynick	yodude	ken gave you wrong info, you have no x session and no desktop
2007-02-11T17:55:00.000Z	mynick	yodude	like i told you 4 times already
2007-02-11T17:56:00.000Z	mynick	yodude	no probs i think :)
2007-02-11T17:58:00.000Z	yodude	mynick	could you pass this request to the developpers: can you include a full nvidia driver with the CD please?
2007-02-11T17:58:00.000Z	mynick	yodude	we cant really, its not free softwqre, its propreitary
