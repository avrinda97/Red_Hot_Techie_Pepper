2006-02-20T14:25:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	sort of mac os start bar thingy
2006-02-20T14:27:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	got it, looks very sweet
2006-02-20T14:27:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	in fact it does, but it would not fit into my oldskool desktops :)
2006-02-20T14:27:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	i do make my own fluxbox/wmaker styles and currently i'm just using KDE and am proud to say that i like KDE.
2006-02-20T14:28:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	i prefer wmaker :=)
2006-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	i like wmaker, fluxbox and KDE. those three are my absolutely favourite desktops.
2006-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	i couldn't think of anything else that i would use an a daily basis.
2006-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	well, there is always the console
2006-02-20T14:30:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	this animated mac os x like bar , did you test it with wmaker ?
2006-02-20T14:30:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	well, there is always a terminal shortcut on my desktop or in my wm's menu :)
2006-02-20T14:30:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	i didn't even test it at all, i just googled for it and what i found was a page containing that screenshot i url'ed you.
2006-02-20T14:31:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	okidoki
2006-02-20T14:32:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	did you check what novell did for the X desktop ?
2006-02-20T14:32:00.000Z	snoozix	c0ntrol	no, URL?
2006-02-20T14:34:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	try google again for novell linux desktop, they got inspired by mac os x too (3d accelerated x (org))
2006-02-20T14:38:00.000Z	c0ntrol	snoozix	nope, my bookmarks are 400 km away from me now (and pc is off)
