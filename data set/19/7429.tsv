2007-08-25T12:12:00.000Z	z0rz		What would you'll suggest for remote control of audio?
2007-08-25T12:12:00.000Z	z0rz		s/you'll/you all/
2007-08-25T12:12:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	depends what you want to use for remote controll
2007-08-25T12:12:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	Suggestions?
2007-08-25T12:13:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	well you either have a remote control and adevice on your computer or you use another computer
2007-08-25T12:14:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	remote control meaning.. from another computer
2007-08-25T12:14:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	you can use ssh and alsamixer
2007-08-25T12:15:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	Already am :D
2007-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	That's a possibility..  I think I want a web interface though..
2007-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	well google for it if someone made it already, or code an interface to alsamixer ;)
2007-08-25T12:18:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	I think I want more than just volume up and down.. maybe like a command line program.. kinda like when you run top .. it takes over the terminal..
2007-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	amixer is what you want then
2007-08-25T12:30:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	Oh I like alxamixer .. now I just need something like xmms cli version or something
2007-08-25T12:31:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	not sure if there is one
2007-08-25T13:23:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	restricted formats perhaps
2007-09-24T08:44:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	use a pipe | or  > ?
2007-09-24T08:45:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	Yeah but it's still echoing the contents of grep (or maybe it's awk) to the standard output (the console)
2007-09-24T08:48:00.000Z	z0rz	rexy_	Nevermind.. it's not.. I'm retarded
2007-09-24T08:48:00.000Z	rexy_	z0rz	ok :P
