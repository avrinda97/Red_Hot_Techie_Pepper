2007-11-23T15:58:00.000Z	zackeroo		I am wondering why I am constantly having issues playing DVD's
2007-11-23T15:58:00.000Z	zackeroo		???
2007-11-23T15:58:00.000Z	zackeroo		in Windows VLC is playing all these DVD's fine
2007-11-23T15:59:00.000Z	zackeroo		but in Linux ... nothing doing
2007-11-23T15:59:00.000Z	zackeroo		I have been trying to find a solution to this widespread problem but nothing has worked
2007-11-23T15:59:00.000Z	zackeroo		I have EVERYTHING installed
2007-11-23T16:00:00.000Z	zackeroo		and folks this is happening with MANY machines running Ubuntu Linux here

2007-11-23T16:01:00.000Z	Guillem_	zackeroo	this is not a technical issue. It is a layers issue....
2007-11-23T16:02:00.000Z	zackeroo	Guillem_	explain please
2007-11-23T16:02:00.000Z	Guillem_	zackeroo	in some countries, using libdvdcss is ilegal.
2007-11-23T16:02:00.000Z	Guillem_	zackeroo	for this reason ubuntu (and other distros) do not include it
2007-11-23T16:02:00.000Z	zackeroo	Guillem_	I don't understand
2007-11-23T16:03:00.000Z	zackeroo	Guillem_	it works in Windows .... libdvdcss in VLC
2007-11-23T16:03:00.000Z	Guillem_	zackeroo	in windows, you have paid a license, which includes licensing of playing dvds
2007-11-23T16:04:00.000Z	zackeroo	Guillem_	ummm... Windows does not come with a DVD codec
2007-11-23T16:05:00.000Z	zackeroo	Guillem_	thats why VLC got so popular
2007-11-23T16:08:00.000Z	zackeroo	Guillem_	yes
