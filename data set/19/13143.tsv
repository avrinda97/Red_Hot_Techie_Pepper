2006-09-18T16:00:00.000Z	ndlovu		if I can see that stellarium is taking up 15MB in /var, why does it only say 2286kB will be freed if I try to apt-get remove it?
2006-09-18T16:01:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	erm... /var ... cached data?
2006-09-18T16:01:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	ok... pease explait/show how you came to the 15mb value
2006-09-18T16:02:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	using xdiskusage
2006-09-18T16:02:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	note that disk usage  and file content sive are not the same thing
2006-09-18T16:02:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	it shows graphical blocks showing what directory is taking up what space
2006-09-18T16:02:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	hrrm  /var/stellarium  or something?
2006-09-18T16:03:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	/usr/share/stellarium
2006-09-18T16:03:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	I see
2006-09-18T16:03:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	now... the 'stellarium' may be a depenhdancy for other packaces
2006-09-18T16:03:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	e.g. there might me a separate 'stellarium-data' package
2006-09-18T16:03:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	ah
2006-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	oh yes there is ;-)
2006-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	indeed there is a stellarium-data package!
2006-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	that will by why then
2006-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	thanks for the help!
2006-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	im sure there is a may in dembian packaging to romeve packages that havent been explicitly installed...
2006-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	enyc	ndlovu	bunt are no-longer depended-upon
2006-09-18T16:05:00.000Z	ndlovu	enyc	I'll check the apt-get man - should be in there somewhere
