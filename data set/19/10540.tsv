2006-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	try du -hs /* to find out where your stuff is so you can clean out some stuff
2006-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	will do
2006-06-04T11:32:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	1.3 gigs in /usr, 108 megs /var, 86 megs in lib, 35 m in /etc, 8.1 m in /sbin
2006-06-04T11:33:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	all seems normal... what does df -h give for free space?
2006-06-04T11:33:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	what about /home?
2006-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	how big is the drive that you have this on?
2006-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	16% free 319 megs availabe
2006-06-04T11:38:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	did you try sudo apt-get clean ?
2006-06-04T11:38:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	yeah
2006-06-04T11:41:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	you will probably need to uninstall some things... you only have about a 2 gig disk right?
2006-06-04T11:42:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	should have formatted stupid windos partition
2006-06-04T11:42:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	uninstall gnome?
2006-06-04T11:42:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	you don't really need it for a server right?
2006-06-04T11:42:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	nope
2006-06-04T11:43:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	apt-get remove gnome?
2006-06-04T11:44:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	dpkg -l will tell you have installed
2006-06-04T11:44:00.000Z	deshantm_	maikol	then you can go through and uninstall with apt-get remove
2006-06-04T11:45:00.000Z	maikol	deshantm_	alright, thanks man
