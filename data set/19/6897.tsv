2009-01-31T07:24:00.000Z	bnovc		its trying to use us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/multiverse/binary-i386
2009-01-31T07:24:00.000Z	bnovc		what/where should i change this to
2009-01-31T07:25:00.000Z	bnovc		apt-get update dies on the same thing
2009-01-31T07:26:00.000Z	bnovc		apparently this is because fiesty now longer is update
2009-01-31T07:26:00.000Z	bnovc		*updated
2009-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	bnovc		why do repositories for older versions of ubuntu just get deleted with no way to update anymore?
2009-01-31T07:29:00.000Z	bnovc		this is absurd that it just dies and i can't update
2009-01-31T07:30:00.000Z	bnovc		the newest would be great
2009-01-31T07:30:00.000Z	bnovc		i thought i would be able to upgrade without wiping and reinstalling?
2009-01-31T07:30:00.000Z	bnovc		apparently not :(
2009-01-31T07:31:00.000Z	yoyoned	bnovc	update-manager -c
2009-01-31T07:24:00.000Z	yoyoned	bnovc	apt-get update
2009-01-31T07:24:00.000Z	bnovc	yoyoned	k
2009-01-31T07:25:00.000Z	bnovc	yoyoned	why isn't that run automatically on updates?
2009-01-31T07:29:00.000Z	yoyoned	bnovc	upgrade to hardy
2009-01-31T07:32:00.000Z	bnovc	yoyoned	that is what i tried to using originally
2009-01-31T07:37:00.000Z	yoyoned	bnovc	there is one other thing you could try, but it may not go smoothly
2009-01-31T07:39:00.000Z	yoyoned	bnovc	last resort - chnage every instance of fiesty to hardy in /etc/apt/sources.list then   apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-01-31T07:40:00.000Z	bnovc	yoyoned	that sounds like it will cause even more problems
