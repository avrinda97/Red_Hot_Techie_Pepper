2005-06-16T08:32:00.000Z	moonshot		hey guys, having some problems getting my wireless card to work.  I think the problem is that ubuntu isn't seeing pcmcia devices.  How can I confirm that?
2005-06-16T08:33:00.000Z	fr500	moonshot	what card do you have?
2005-06-16T08:33:00.000Z	fr500	moonshot	type lspci and see if there are any references to it
2005-06-16T08:34:00.000Z	moonshot	fr500	 nope
2005-06-16T08:34:00.000Z	fr500	moonshot	paste the lspci output at www.pasetbin.com and give me the link to your post
