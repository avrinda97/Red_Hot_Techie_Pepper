2007-03-18T07:14:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	just one question, what comes after loading the input devices?
2007-03-18T07:06:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	why did you build your own kernel
2007-03-18T07:08:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	I wanted to safe boottime and enlarge the hardware compability
2007-03-18T07:08:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	why ? a new kernel doesn't increase hardware compatability as ubuntu builds all the modules
2007-03-18T07:08:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	hmm well, but at least I'll save some boot time
2007-03-18T07:08:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	a failed keyboard config shouldn't hang your kernel, I suggest is something else
2007-03-18T07:08:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	doubtful
2007-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	I've got a USB-Keyboard and USB-Mouse going over one receiver
2007-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	that shouldn't hang a boot
2007-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	and I disabled the support for serial input devices, could that be the cause?
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	you can boot  box without a keyboard nad mouse
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	are there any apci warnings ?
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	I see
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	I mounts the root file system, loads the mouse, then the keyboard and then there's just nothing further
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	I just hangs, no error
2007-03-18T07:12:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	I suggest you listen to ravi and his random debugging
2007-03-18T07:12:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	I don't think that this solution is the best one
2007-03-18T07:12:00.000Z	ikonia	xfab	best of luck
2007-03-18T07:14:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia	normally
