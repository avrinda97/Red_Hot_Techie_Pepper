2008-07-12T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	please ask your question on one line if possible
2008-07-12T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	please don't use that sort of language
2008-07-12T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	if you can't ask without swearing
2008-07-12T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	sorry, could you explain that a little clearer please. What are you trying to do
2008-07-12T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	ok, so sap I can't see prixovy in the repo's what is the package name for it
2008-07-12T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	whats the package called ?
2008-07-12T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	please calm down
2008-07-12T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	calm down - yo udon't like gnome, we get it, the channel doesn't need to hear about it
2008-10-15T03:22:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	what application and what version of ubuntu
2008-10-15T03:23:00.000Z	sap	ikonia	its "motion" and on xubuntu 8.10
2008-10-15T03:24:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	ask in #ubuntu+1 as 8.10 is beta
2008-10-15T03:25:00.000Z	sap	ikonia	hmm.. I don't think that would make a difference.. its probably just a problem of accessing that machine through internet
2008-10-15T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	but the channels topics make a difference, so best to ask in #ubuntu+1
2008-10-15T03:27:00.000Z	sap	ikonia	ok will try that :)
2008-10-15T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	sap	thank you
