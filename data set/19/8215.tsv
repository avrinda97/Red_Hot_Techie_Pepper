2007-09-27T07:51:00.000Z	f0rtune		i cant connect to my vncserver, i get connection refused from a computer in my LAN, and firestarter is set to accept all connections on port 5900, what should i do?
2007-09-27T07:53:00.000Z	f0rtune		i cant connect to my vncserver, i get connection refused from a computer in my LAN, and firestarter is set to accept all connections on port 5900, what should i do?
2007-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	do you have the vncserver running on that port?
2007-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	i thought it was the default
2007-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	i did a port scan and it says that 5900 is closed, but in firestarter it says its accepting all connections..
2007-09-27T07:58:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	netstat -l | grep 590
2007-09-27T07:59:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	it didnt output anything
2007-09-27T08:00:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	perhaps you vnc server isn't running.  did you do vncserver :0
2007-09-27T08:00:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	yes its running...
2007-09-27T08:02:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	do you suggest anything?
2007-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	iono ok  try launching another.   vncserver :1
2007-09-27T08:05:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	well the only problem resides in the port that firestarter says is open but isn't
2007-09-27T08:06:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	can you telnet localhost 5900
2007-09-27T08:06:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	'Connection Refused'
2007-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	so it's not firestarter
2007-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	start a vnc server on 5901
2007-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	how do i do that?
2007-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	f0rtune	wastrel	i know that, it doesnt say where i can specify a port
2007-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	wastrel	f0rtune	that's the port  5900 = :0 , 5901 = :1
