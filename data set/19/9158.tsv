2007-03-28T05:08:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	do you have ashit load of extensions installed? performance issus are usually created by bad plugins/addons

2007-03-28T05:09:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	disable then, restart firefox and see if the problem still exists. if no ... i'd re enable them one by one and see which one is casuing problems

2007-03-28T05:11:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	no still same problem, actually i think this problem is in all my apps...
2007-03-28T05:11:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	yeah, its a problem in all my apps
2007-03-28T05:12:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	could it have to do with drivers for my scroll wheel, or for my screen?
2007-03-28T05:13:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	ok. hmmm. yes, it could be a general xorg problem, a vid card driver problem or DE problem. do you see any process eating up your cpu cycles ?
2007-03-28T05:13:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	what's metacity?
2007-03-28T05:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	metacity is the window manager for gnome.
2007-03-28T05:14:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	i think its a mouse driver actually...
2007-03-28T05:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	i see. have you tried to google for problems with you specific mouse ?
2007-03-28T05:18:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	nothing comes up, no specific drivers either
2007-03-28T05:22:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	its the kensington optical elite mouse in a box - and there dont appear to be specific linux drivers...
2007-03-28T05:23:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	you might rty to use different mouse drivers in you xorg.conf. it's basicly an xorg config problem.
2007-03-29T13:28:00.000Z	Spliffster	fotoflo	if you are meaning nforce chipset, then yes
2007-03-29T13:29:00.000Z	fotoflo	Spliffster	cool thanks
