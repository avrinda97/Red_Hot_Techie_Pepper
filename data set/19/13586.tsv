2005-05-03T06:56:00.000Z	tidalwav1		Hi, all, who knows how to get ALSA working :p
2005-05-03T06:57:00.000Z	tidalwav1		anyone with ALSA experience? :(
2005-05-03T06:58:00.000Z	tidalwav1		trent: just installed Hoary on a new(er) computer than I had been using it on previosuly. ESD works, but ALSA is dead...I can't select it in multimedia systems selector, I have no sound in frozen-bubble, etc, but I have the regular GNOME sounds.
2005-05-03T06:58:00.000Z	tidalwav1		how do I make them play nice? :P
2005-05-03T06:58:00.000Z	tidalwav1		uhhhmmm

2005-05-03T06:59:00.000Z	tidalwav1		Informative?
2005-05-03T06:59:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	I would suggest to turn off the sound server
2005-05-03T06:59:00.000Z	tidalwav1	scizzo	killall esd?
2005-05-03T07:00:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	turn of ESD and skip the sounds that GNOME uses and try to use ALSA instead...
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	turn off the sound server in: system -> administration -> sound
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	tidalwav1	scizzo	it isn' there
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	look in the rest of the menu
2005-05-03T07:04:00.000Z	tidalwav1	scizzo	yep, got it
2005-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	easy...you turned it off
2005-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	tidalwav1	scizzo	but...gah?
2005-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	ESD is being used by GNOME...
2005-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	scizzo	tidalwav1	killall esd killed the soundserver
