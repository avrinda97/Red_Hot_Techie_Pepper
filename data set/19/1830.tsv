2010-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	x0rs		Anyone know where I can find my "Session" options in Ubuntu 10?
2010-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	Do you mean like KDE or Gnome "sessions"
2010-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	x0rs	JohnHeikkila	yes Gnome Sessions
2010-09-26T22:55:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	Log-out and you should see a box on the bottom of your screen where you can choose your sessions
2010-09-26T23:20:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	alt+f2 is not a command line, it's like a quick-launch
2010-09-26T23:21:00.000Z	x0rs	JohnHeikkila	gotcha, do you know of a good quick-launch app that will replace gnome-panel?
2010-09-26T23:21:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	Well, DockbarX
2010-09-26T23:21:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	Cairo dock
2010-09-26T23:22:00.000Z	x0rs	JohnHeikkila	I already use AWM, do those docks add a panel? All I need is an Alt-F2 launcher
2010-09-26T23:22:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	Cairo dock is like Mac's
2010-09-26T23:22:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	the Alt+F2 launcher comes from Compiz. <sudo apt-get install compiz fusion-icon>
2010-09-26T23:23:00.000Z	x0rs	JohnHeikkila	nice thank you
2010-09-26T23:23:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	then Applications-->System tools->Compiz Fusion Icon
2010-09-26T23:23:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	That will pop up an icon in the notification area. Right-click it and Select Window Manager as Compiz
2010-09-26T23:25:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	AWM, eh? You need to put the notification area / indicator applet there
2010-09-26T23:25:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	I am using gnome-panel and AWM
2010-09-26T23:26:00.000Z	x0rs	JohnHeikkila	I have notification area, and it seems I am already using Compiz... it's already selected, but no Alt-F2 launcher still
2010-09-26T23:27:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	x0rs	Then it's the gnome-panel you need
2010-09-26T23:27:00.000Z	x0rs	JohnHeikkila	/nod - seems so... I just don't need the panel... my AWM has everything on it I need
