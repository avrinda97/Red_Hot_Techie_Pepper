2008-04-03T06:23:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	IndyGunFreak	I think  he was talking to me
2008-06-30T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	lol, thats why i laughed
2008-08-14T07:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	i think a broadcom wireless device
2008-09-15T08:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	i was messing w/ Intrepid today, it doesn't support my atheros chipset yet(Ar242x)
2008-09-15T08:32:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	IndyGunFreak	you can get the drivers Intrepid will be using backported to Hardy but it's kinda messy
2008-09-15T08:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	well, i was trying to make it work w/ madwifi under Intrepid, the way I did under hardy, and that was no joy.
2008-09-15T08:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	how difficult is it to install build-essential on w/o an internet connection?.. i've never had much luck w/ it.
2008-09-15T08:41:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	IndyGunFreak	no idea, I don't recall ever really using it
2008-09-15T08:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	hmm,
2008-09-15T08:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	that 242x one is a pain, only worked on gutsy w/ a patched madwifi... and doesn't work w/ the current version of madwifi
2008-09-15T08:43:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	IndyGunFreak	You need ath9k for those AR242x things which I was assured will be in Intrepid on I couldn't find it last I looked...
2008-09-15T08:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	yeah, i tried today for a while to get it to work... no joy
2008-09-15T08:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	i have a verison of madwifi that does, thats what pw- needs, but he'll need to install build essential, and i can rapidshare the file to him.
2008-09-15T08:47:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	IndyGunFreak	I was just going on what I read over at the madwifi site. I only have ath_pci/ath5k cards and don't care one way or the other how well Linux supports the one in my MacBook :P
2008-09-15T08:51:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	IndyGunFreak	It shouldn't be hard, Atheros are usually good but between the drivers being in a state of transition (both upstream and in ubuntu) and Ubuntu being a little slow to roll out madwifi updates we're in a bit of a rough patch right now
2008-09-15T08:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	i know..
2008-09-15T08:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	madwifi is not the problem, i have the version of madwifi he needs, he needs to install build-essential, and i've just never had luck installing that w/o an internet connection
2009-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LSD|Ninja	lol, thats all i use, it works perfectly as long as you pay attention
