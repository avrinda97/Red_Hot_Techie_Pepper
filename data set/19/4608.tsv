2009-06-10T21:56:00.000Z	chanux		some stuff needed to compile QT
2009-06-10T21:56:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	all the p means is that the package is not installed. an i would be an installed and a v would mean its a virtual package.
2009-06-10T21:56:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	But man aptitude said something diff
2009-06-10T21:57:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	Aditionally, why are you trying to compile QT?
2009-06-10T21:58:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	well I want to learn :)
2009-06-10T21:58:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	the most common states are p, meaning that no trace of the package exists on the system, c, meaning that the package was
2009-06-10T21:58:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	^ from man aptitude
2009-06-10T21:59:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	p = pacakge is not installed, c = package was unisntalled, but not purged, i = package is installed.
2009-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	That is what the manpage says.
2009-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	I checked under search section
2009-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	As did I.
2009-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	'no trace of this package exists on the system' means that it is not installed.
2009-06-10T22:02:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	No offense but here's that part from my man aptitude http://pastebin.com/d4d91b825
2009-06-10T22:03:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	ah it's now I realized
2009-06-10T22:03:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	So why I can't install it with aptitude install? :(
2009-06-10T22:04:00.000Z	Pici	chanux	Which package?
2009-06-10T22:08:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	I think I got an idea. Thanx for your valuable time. Will come back with ne wprobs
2009-06-10T22:14:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	what does piA means in aptitude search results
2009-06-10T22:16:00.000Z	chanux	Pici	I can remember I installed libxtst-dev before. Now I get piA for the aptitude search for it
