2011-08-02T19:46:00.000Z	hroi		hi...
2011-08-02T19:46:00.000Z	hroi		I just installed vnc4server package on my ubuntu server.
2011-08-02T19:46:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	yeah, try 'w' instead of 'users'
2011-08-02T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	what does x-window-manager point to?
2011-08-02T19:49:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	checking
2011-08-02T19:50:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	it points to nothing... ubuntu tells me it is contained in this and that such and such packages.
2011-08-02T19:50:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	install a window manager :D
2011-08-02T19:51:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	dr_willis: thanks... so I just need to install some window manager package
2011-08-02T19:52:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	dr_willis:  I kinda like those old ones... really basic and lightweight right?
2011-08-02T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	yeah, it will probably become what x-window-manager points to automatically, but if not, use update-alternatives (in my case x-window-manager points to xmonad and I never set that)
2011-08-02T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	try fluxbox
2011-08-02T19:53:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	ok fluxbox why not.
2011-08-02T19:53:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	just want something ultralight and stable
2011-08-02T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	fluxbox is pretty light while still being pretty straightforward imo.  But there are tons of light window managers in the repositories
2011-08-02T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	just install half a dozen and try them all imo
2011-08-02T19:57:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	fluxbox 4.7 MB.... but flwm is 165 kB.
2011-08-02T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	probably, but use update-alternatives to change
2012-04-26T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	hroi	subversion
2012-04-26T19:08:00.000Z	hroi	jrib	thanks
