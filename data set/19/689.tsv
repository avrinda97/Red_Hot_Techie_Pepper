2011-10-27T20:59:00.000Z	TorbenBeta		How can I safely back up my files?
2011-10-27T20:59:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	rsync
2011-10-27T20:59:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	or duplicity if you want a more userfriendly frontend
2011-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	MrElendig	rscync is a terminal app?
2011-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	yes, but there exist several gui fronts for it
2011-10-29T20:00:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	use saner permissions instead
2011-10-29T20:00:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	shouldn't need sudo
2011-10-29T20:01:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	MrElendig	will it work anyway?
2011-10-29T20:01:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	what fs is it on the external btw?
2011-10-29T20:01:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	also, rsync is better for backup usage, since it checks for consistency and has resume support
2011-10-29T20:02:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	urgh, you will lose all posix permissions, which is bad
2011-10-29T20:02:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	specially for .files that contains passwords and the like, not to mention for .ssh
2011-10-29T20:03:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	I would strongly suggest somethign else than ntfs for backups
2011-10-29T20:03:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	MrElendig	do you have a better one?
2011-10-29T20:03:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	alternativly tar or cpio up /home before
2011-10-29T20:03:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	to preserve the permissions
2011-10-29T20:03:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	MrElendig	the problem is that it is not mine but from my father and I have no other.]
2011-10-29T20:03:00.000Z	MrElendig	TorbenBeta	tar/cpio then
2011-10-29T20:04:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	MrElendig	example please (I'm not that versed in the CLI.
