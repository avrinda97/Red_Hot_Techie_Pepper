2010-11-20T06:48:00.000Z	aarcane	yxz97	it was a joke, but I really do get e-mails from newegg with cheap prices on large hard-drives.  try one of those.

2010-11-20T06:49:00.000Z	aarcane	yxz97	if that's true than you have more drive space than you're admitting.  I haven't seen anything for sale with less than 250GB.
2010-11-20T06:50:00.000Z	aarcane	yxz97	then you've got enough for ubuntu.  quit wining and go install.
