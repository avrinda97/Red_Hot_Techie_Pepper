2005-10-10T11:59:00.000Z	thompa		hey anybody: im running breezy badger rc, can i just keep updating it and not have to install the final release?
2005-10-10T11:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	of course
2005-10-10T11:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	if you do a dist-upgrade after the release-date you'll have official anyway
2005-10-10T12:00:00.000Z	thompa	apokryphos	how can i remove old kernekl entries in grub then
2005-10-10T12:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	removing the kernel should remove them...
2005-10-10T12:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	you likely still have them installed
2005-10-10T12:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	sure
2005-10-14T10:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	like?
2005-10-14T10:15:00.000Z	thompa	apokryphos	windows manager maybe. i dont know.
2005-10-14T10:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	in...?
2005-10-14T10:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	in gnome?
2005-10-14T10:16:00.000Z	thompa	apokryphos	also the menus in gnome have old kde look theme maybe. yes gnome
2005-10-14T10:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	sounds very odd; how did you install kde?
2005-10-14T10:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	and, have you changed the window managers or something?
2005-10-14T10:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	well, compile a bug report; you shouldn't really get that behaviour anyhow
2005-10-14T10:22:00.000Z	thompa	apokryphos	probably i should stay with one desktop anyway or ill never get any work done
2005-10-14T10:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	as I said, you shouldn't get that behaviour anyway. I have both installed in perfect harmony here
2005-10-14T10:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	thompa	and many many others do
2005-10-14T10:24:00.000Z	thompa	apokryphos	how do you solve the problem when switching to other desktop, icon image or name missing.
