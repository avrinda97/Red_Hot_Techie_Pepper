2008-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	sarana_monk		is there any display configuration tool for Ubuntu?
2008-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	sarana_monk		GUI or command line, that doesnt matter
2008-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	sarana_monk		I mean to change the screen configuration
2008-12-09T11:58:00.000Z	sarana_monk		no, I have an old graphics card
2008-12-09T11:59:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	you can do gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and manually do it, srry for the lack of real help but it's the only way I know how to
2008-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	sarana_monk	binarymutant	heh, that I have heard so many times - xorg
2008-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	sarana_monk	binarymutant	but this is very strange, on computers that work well the xorg.conf is absolutely empty
2008-12-09T12:01:00.000Z	sarana_monk	binarymutant	there must be some other configuration file, I am sure
2008-12-09T12:01:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	it can't be empty, or else you wouldn't have an gui
2008-12-09T12:01:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	it used to be called xfree86.conf or something, could have been that
2008-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	sarana_monk	binarymutant	I work with vim - and all the lines start with _
2008-12-09T12:07:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg?
2008-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to get a new one
2008-12-09T12:12:00.000Z	sarana_monk	binarymutant	this I tried already two times. It configures only the keyboard. it doesnt work.
2008-12-09T12:12:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	yeah but afterwards you'll have the file, so you can manually edit it
2008-12-09T12:15:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	yea
2008-12-09T12:16:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	now under device put driver "ati" <- or whatever video driver and it should be great
2008-12-09T12:17:00.000Z	sarana_monk	binarymutant	ok, Ill try it ... brb
2008-12-09T12:18:00.000Z	binarymutant	sarana_monk	if it doesn't work pastebin your xorg.conf so we can see it
