2011-07-18T12:55:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		Hi, #ubuntuans.  I just installed a new ubuntu system on this box, and everything seems smashing except that my computer seems confused about the size of my monitor.
2011-07-18T12:55:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		Everything displayed is a bit too stretched horizontally/squeezed vertically...
2011-07-18T12:57:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		I'm unsure what the processor is...
2011-07-18T12:58:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	Have you tried beating it with a stick yet? (Joking) => you might want to check for the proper video driver.
2011-07-18T13:00:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	So...how do I go about that?
2011-07-18T13:01:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	I'm not happy nor familiar with 11.04, so you might want to look somewhere in the System Settings for "Hardware Drivers" => see if the proper video driver is installed mate.
2011-07-18T13:03:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	I'm not using 11.04; I'm using 10.04.2
2011-07-18T13:04:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	Also, I'm not familiar with this "system settings" thing
2011-07-18T13:04:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	Awesome. Right. Then click SYSTEM => ADMINISTRATION => ADDITIONAL DRIVERS
2011-07-18T13:05:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	Awesome. Right.  I'm not using one of the standard guis.
2011-07-18T13:05:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	Roger that.
2011-07-18T13:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	(or jockey-text)
2011-07-18T13:09:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	and m0n : groovy...it's downloading a driver.  I'll let you know if it works...  Thanks!
2011-07-18T13:09:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	Does that mean you're buying the beer?
2011-07-18T13:09:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	The virtual beer, sure.
2011-07-18T13:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	Roger that.
2011-07-19T12:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	Um...it actually should be something like /dev/sr0
2011-07-19T12:45:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoAnneThrax	You installed libdvdcss?
2011-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax	YankDownUnder	Yes.
