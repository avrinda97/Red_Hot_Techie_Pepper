2005-07-23T08:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	axis	stop repeating yourself, pls. but yes, I'm on a SATA HDD right now...
2005-07-23T08:30:00.000Z	axis	Madpilot	 i'm on a msi k8t neo2 plat. running 1 maxtor 16mb cache 250gig SATA . it installs great, dma enables, 32 bit io .. nope
2005-07-23T08:32:00.000Z	axis	Madpilot	Do you have 32bit i/o enabled on your SATA ??
2005-07-23T08:32:00.000Z	axis	Madpilot	and if so, how did you manager
2005-07-23T08:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	axis	haven't a clue. WTH is 32bit i/o? the damn thing works, that's all I care about...
2005-07-23T08:33:00.000Z	axis	Madpilot	: Your hard disk is running at half speed. drop to root console and type "hdparm /dev/sda"
2005-07-23T08:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	axis	no ERROR msgs, but it says this: IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
2005-07-23T08:35:00.000Z	axis	Madpilot	: yah sorry, it says error when you type "hdparm -d1 -c3 -a64 -X66 -k1 /dev/sda"
2005-07-23T08:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	axis	this isn't an AMD64 box, it's a K7. the 64 bit part might be your problem?
2005-07-23T08:37:00.000Z	axis	Madpilot	: It installs fine, but it's only at 16 bit i/o like yours
2005-07-23T08:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	axis	I'm not even going to try, frankly. it works, it's stable, and I'm not that speed obbsessed right now...
2005-07-24T13:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	axis	desrt, maybe take it to /msg?
