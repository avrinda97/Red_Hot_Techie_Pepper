2010-07-26T18:04:00.000Z	chilli0		Anyone know what this means? Session error : Data could not be written (Input/output error) (brasero_burn_record brasero-burn.c:2839)
2010-07-26T18:05:00.000Z	chilli0		And I can watch the movie just fine by playing it.
2010-07-26T18:06:00.000Z	chilli0		Copy a disk to an iso.
2010-07-26T18:06:00.000Z	chilli0		The latter.
2010-07-26T18:07:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	I think K3B can.
2010-07-26T18:08:00.000Z	chilli0	tntc	So can bras
2010-07-26T18:08:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	oh, ok.
2010-07-26T18:09:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	oh, you mean it won't copy this particular disk?
2010-07-26T18:09:00.000Z	chilli0	tntc	Yes.
2010-07-26T18:10:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	you might want to try something like gddrescue.  If the disk has errors, it'll just write zeros
2010-07-26T18:10:00.000Z	chilli0	tntc	I will not be doing that haha. ( It's a movie)
2010-07-26T18:11:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	oh, you might need like DVDShrink (A windows app) or something.
2010-07-26T18:11:00.000Z	chilli0	tntc	I wanna copy the iso ( no quality loss and can re-write ealy_)
2010-07-26T18:12:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	DVDSrhink'll do that.  You just need to turn off compression.  I use it to back up all my DVDs and so I can watch em on my netbook.

2010-07-26T18:13:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	k9copy looks promising, though ymmv
2010-07-26T18:15:00.000Z	chilli0	tntc	I'm trying k3b as we speak. Then ill try k9copy. then the other one you said =P
2010-07-26T18:16:00.000Z	tntc	chilli0	bear in mind DVDShrink is Windows only, and kinda tough to get, since they don't host it in the US.  They're scared of the whole dvdcss situation, especailly since it stores an unencrypted copy and can remove region encoding.
2010-07-26T18:17:00.000Z	chilli0	tntc	Ill be able to get a copy =P
