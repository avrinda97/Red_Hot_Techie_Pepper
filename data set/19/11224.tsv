2006-03-29T09:04:00.000Z	jlhenry		Hello
2006-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	jlhenry		can anyone tell me how can I do a script that move file named "filename.new" to "filename"?
2006-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	mv
2006-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	...
2006-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	yes I know
2006-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	no, seriously
2006-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	but I've got 72 files
2006-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	I know a bit "sed" but can't figure out how to use it to do that
2006-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	do you just want to rename them?
2006-03-29T09:07:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	I just want to know how i can say "remove the .new"
2006-03-29T09:07:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	man rename, let me know if you have questions
2006-03-29T09:09:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	the problem i think is not the tool, i could do it with rename or mv. the pb comes to write the argument
2006-03-29T09:10:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	rename -n 's/\.new//' *, should do work right.  If it works just get rid of the -n so it actually acts on the files
2006-03-29T09:12:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	thanks a lot!
2006-03-29T09:12:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	np
2006-03-29T09:13:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	do you understand it?
2006-03-29T09:13:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	yes I understand it. I was just not imagine that this was just like that! :)
2006-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	jlhenry	_jason	there is probably shorter, but here what i done
2006-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	_jason	jlhenry	ouch
