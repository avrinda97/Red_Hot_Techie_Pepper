2005-01-26T14:38:00.000Z	Greves		try eh? hmmm
2005-01-26T14:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	there are many ubuntu reviews available on line
2005-01-26T14:38:00.000Z	Greves	HappyFool	i'm looking around - not so easy to do on links :D
2005-01-26T14:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	you can get an ubuntu CD mailed to you for free here: http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org/
2005-01-26T14:39:00.000Z	Greves	HappyFool	they actualy mail it for free? no shipping?
2005-01-26T14:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	the package comes with a live cd which you can just use without installing
2005-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	Greves	HappyFool	ok, but assuming i would want to install it? livecds dont tell you much about the distro
2005-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	and with an install cd that (obviously) installs ubuntu onto your machine
2005-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	Greves	HappyFool	but is it as simple or easier than say a windows install?
2005-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	umm, if you are willing to let ubuntu be the only OS, pretty easy
2005-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	Greves	HappyFool	why would i need another, if its so great? ;)
2005-01-26T14:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	otherwise, if you have a clue about partitioning etc, very easy
2005-01-26T14:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	ubuntu is based on debian. ubuntu uses apt
2005-01-26T17:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	sudo -s
2005-01-26T06:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	is your synaptic working? or was that just a warning you pasted earlier?
2005-01-26T06:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	It Just Worked For Me (tm)
2005-01-26T06:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	you seem to have lots of bandwidth ;). Maybe you should try download the full iso and install from that?
2005-01-26T06:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	you appear to be having unusually bad luck
2005-01-26T06:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	Greves	oh ;) like ?
