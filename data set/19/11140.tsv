2006-06-13T08:06:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	am trying using dpkg-reconfigure
2006-06-13T08:05:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	re-run alsaconf?
2006-06-13T08:05:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	ok, thanks
2006-06-13T08:05:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	um, what happened to alsaconf
2006-06-13T08:06:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	Oh darn... I think it's gone
2006-06-13T08:06:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	it's just a script though, I'll look for a link on the net
2006-06-13T08:07:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	thanks, I used to think alsa+debian was hard, this is just impossible <wink>
2006-06-13T08:08:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	I believe that you can grab a tarball from ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/driver/alsaconf/
2006-06-13T08:08:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	that should work
2006-06-13T08:08:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	thanks
2006-06-13T08:12:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	ok, this is starting to scare me, running alsaconf, my card isn't in the available driver list (I think) - triple checking)
2006-06-13T08:13:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	what does your card show up as in lspci?
2006-06-13T08:13:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	its a common sound card I mean sb audigy 2
2006-06-13T08:13:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	0000:02:02.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Audigy (rev 04)
2006-06-13T08:13:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	I heard that a lot of people are having problems with audigy cards...
2006-06-13T08:14:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	yikes, any refeernce?
2006-06-13T08:15:00.000Z	Noahj	aa_	I was chatting at the time, so I don't have any particular reference.
2006-06-13T08:15:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	ah cool, well I need to reboot to turn the onboard card on in BIOS, thanks for your hel
2006-06-13T08:34:00.000Z	aa_	Noahj	ok, ripped out the audigy, on the on board card, all working perfectly, thanks :)
