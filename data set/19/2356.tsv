2011-08-07T19:57:00.000Z	Frijolie		how do you replace colons in file names with a dash in all folders and subfolders given a directory?
2011-08-07T19:59:00.000Z	Frijolie		unknown number of files and unknown number of subdirectories
2011-08-07T20:00:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	find . type -f -exec echo rename 's/:/-/' {} \;        (echo for testing purposes)
2011-08-07T20:01:00.000Z	Frijolie	rumpe1	i'll try that...
2011-08-07T20:03:00.000Z	Frijolie	rumpe1	"find: unknown predicate -f"
2011-08-07T20:04:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	you have a typo
2011-08-07T20:05:00.000Z	Frijolie		rumnpe1, I took out the -f and it's looping through all the files..is it only showing the files which need to be renamed or is it showing all files?
2011-08-07T20:10:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	lol.. okay, i've made a type. One moment...
2011-08-07T20:10:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	typo not type
2011-08-07T20:11:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	find . -type f -name '*:*' -exec echo rename 's/:/-/' {} \;      should be better i guess
2011-08-07T20:11:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	it should send one line for each file with a ":" in its name and the corresponding command, that would be executed, if there weren't an "echo"
2011-08-07T20:12:00.000Z	Frijolie	rumpe1	will this also rename directories (folders) which may have a colon?
2011-08-07T20:12:00.000Z	Frijolie	rumpe1	thanks for your help. this will save me a TON of work
2011-08-07T20:12:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	no  (because of the "-type f(ile)"
2011-08-07T20:13:00.000Z	Frijolie	rumpe1	so if I omit the 'type -f' it will also search for folders with a colon?
2011-08-07T20:13:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	I'm just not sure, what happens, if there are more than one colon in the filename... maybe you need a "g" for the substition pattern
2011-08-07T20:14:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	then it will search for anything with a colon in it's name (file, folder, device, ...)
2011-08-07T20:16:00.000Z	rumpe1	Frijolie	ah... as i thought: for multiple colons you need 's/:/-/g'
2011-08-07T20:17:00.000Z	Frijolie	rumpe1	well I'm running this from a specific folder (Pictures), so it will only search recursively from where I run the command
