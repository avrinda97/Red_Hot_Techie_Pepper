2010-03-03T02:03:00.000Z	melodie_		I would like to have an information about the latest dual-boots with Windows : how does it go with Seven, provided a machine with NO tatoo ?
2010-03-03T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	same as any dual boot
2010-03-03T02:04:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	do you redimension from within seven or with gparted is allright too ? what about the restoration partition ? doesn't it "repair" the partitions done for Ubuntu in it's own way ? (that happened to us on someone's laptop where vista was installed)
2010-03-03T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	i've heard 7 can do it. I'd use that to reduce risk, make sure your backups arerecent incase of catastrophe
2010-03-03T02:09:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	all I'll have to backup is the system : a new machine is arriving, it's a netbook for my son's birthday.
2010-03-03T02:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	i just always remind users to backup, ive seen too many people try resizing then moan when their data is destroyed and they have zero backup
2010-03-03T02:13:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	does Seven need 24 go for it's partition ?
2010-03-03T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	24Gb for ubuntu is plenty
2010-03-03T02:14:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	Ubuntu doesn't worry me, but Seven yes : how much does it need to keep ?
2010-03-03T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	ive never used it, i wouldnt know
2010-03-03T02:20:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	ok thanks a lot
2010-03-03T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	ask in ##windows for windows stuff
2010-03-03T02:21:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	if I talk about dual-booting they may not welcome me, what do you think ?
2010-03-03T02:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	not sure, if they are nice they will
2010-03-03T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	indeed. /j ##windows
2010-03-03T02:22:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	thanks again
2012-07-08T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	no 3D accelleration
2012-07-08T13:34:00.000Z	melodie_	ActionParsnip	sure, then maybe it is necessary to install the latest mesa packages available
2012-07-08T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	melodie_	blacklist.conf ;)   all the files in the modprobe.d must end in .conf (no idea why)
