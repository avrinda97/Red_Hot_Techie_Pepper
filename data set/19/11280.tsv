2006-02-27T15:07:00.000Z	Mabus06	acasues	when it's red, it means that the message is highlighted by your xchat. By default, it will highlight if somebody mentions your nickname. That is why I prefix comments to you with your name, so you will be able to read comments easily. Many other clients are like this. In a popular channel like here, it is a good idea to prefix comments with the nickname of the person you're talking to.

2006-02-27T15:11:00.000Z	Mabus06	acasues	nickname completion worked, but you had to manually set highlighting to your nickname. With xchat it's like that by default. And, autocompletion suffixes a character (in your case, ",", in my case, ":") and then a space
