2008-07-28T02:01:00.000Z	russ		Does anybody have an explanation for why gtkpod keeps setting my podcasts to the "not yet listened to" state?
2008-07-28T02:02:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	combined knowledge as a team, lots can be done
2008-07-29T06:38:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	ACPI
2008-07-29T06:39:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	Power Management settings in CMOS
2008-07-29T06:40:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	anything specific I should look for?
2008-07-29T06:40:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	ACPI
2008-07-29T06:40:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	does Ubuntu shut down automatically when you press power button once ?
2008-07-29T06:44:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	Actually it goes to a password prompt screen, which seems to work intermittently.  Most recently the system was unresponsive to the keyboard and I had to hold down the power key to do a reboot
2008-07-29T06:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	what version Ubuntu you running ? i seen that in 7.x
2008-07-29T06:45:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	Also, when it is "waking up" to get to that (intermittently working) password prompt, it reported a bunch of I/O errors on device sdb1
2008-07-29T06:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	that was meant for you> what version ?
2008-07-29T06:45:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	8.04
2008-07-29T06:46:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	ACPI function allows for that, thats about all i can tell you. you can disable it if need be
2008-07-29T06:47:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	all acpi reports is the battery state, ac charger state, and temperature (the terminal command acpi that is) - haven't tried the cmos yet
2008-07-29T06:47:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	go to this
2008-07-29T06:47:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	sure would be nice to be able to edit the cmos without rebooting (sigh)
2008-07-29T06:48:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	System/Administration/Services and look for ACPID
2008-07-29T06:48:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	russ	you can try and disable it there to see if it works for you, but your ACPI functions will also be disabled
2008-07-29T06:51:00.000Z	russ	ManualOverDozer8	well I'd rather get it to work; I can disable it by setting the suspend time to "never" - but was wondering if anybody knows what is going on, or how to identify device "sdb1"
