2011-08-13T11:29:00.000Z	yezariaely		after dist upgrade my dpkg status file is corrupt. How can I fix that?
2011-08-13T11:31:00.000Z	slim_charles	yezariaely	i think u can do that by going to recovery mode
2011-08-13T11:32:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	thing is, there is only some descrption of a package broken
2011-08-13T11:33:00.000Z	slim_charles	yezariaely	this command comes to mind dpkg-reconfigure
2011-08-13T11:43:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	indeed it does.
2011-08-13T11:44:00.000Z	slim_charles	yezariaely	does this actually fix the problem of there being a corrupt package status file?
2011-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	so the reason for the problems was an empty line in a package description.
2011-08-13T11:46:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	so if that goes for the total package broken, then yes
2011-08-13T11:47:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	maybe you can do a apt-cache show mirthkit and see if there is a new line in the description?
2011-08-13T11:48:00.000Z	slim_charles	yezariaely	 how would you check for newline like that? you def need  some  extra commands in there
2011-08-13T11:49:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	see the url I posted.
2011-08-13T11:49:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	sure, but a plain old regular expression should be enough
2011-08-13T11:50:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	in fact it is only this line that is necessary pcregrep -nM '\n\s*\n[^P]+' /var/lib/dpkg/status
2011-08-13T11:51:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	and I think this could be done in sed as well
2011-08-13T11:55:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	this seems to be something for lintian, doesn't it? (if it is not already checked in there)
2011-08-13T11:57:00.000Z	slim_charles	yezariaely	probably yes , it is definitely a weird issue which im sure others have had or have and dont know they have it
2011-08-13T12:02:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	not for me ;)
2011-08-13T12:02:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	lintian seems to check for this errors
2011-08-13T12:15:00.000Z	yezariaely	slim_charles	lintian catches the error definitely. I tried it here.
