2005-09-23T12:36:00.000Z	daaku		hey everyone, was gonna do a new ubuntu indtall, and was trying to decide which filesystem to use, and came across something about dir_index to speed up ext3. anyone have more suggestions to improve performance?
2005-09-23T12:36:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	pretty sure modern ext3 uses hashed directories by default
2005-09-23T12:37:00.000Z	daaku	bob2	the man page doesnt say the hashed b-trees are used by default
2005-09-23T12:38:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	hm you're right
2005-09-23T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	any idea what the filetype ext3 option does?
2005-09-23T12:43:00.000Z	daaku	bob2	not quite sure. trying to see if i can find something about it
2005-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	both are more or less needed
2005-09-23T13:19:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	initramfs is esseitnal if you want to be able to boot
2005-09-23T13:21:00.000Z	daaku	bob2	ah. ok. can i disable the mdadm init script though? (and lvm while i'm at it?)
2005-09-23T13:21:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	sure
2005-09-23T13:21:00.000Z	daaku	bob2	nice. under 512mb system, with a ~15-20sec boot. yay!
2005-09-23T13:36:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	you could minimise it by removing modules you know you don't need
2005-09-23T13:36:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	but apt can't pick them for you
2005-09-29T11:15:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	bounce should work
2005-09-29T11:15:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	ie it has always worked for me
2005-09-29T11:31:00.000Z	daaku	bob2	i found mime_forward, did the job perfectly
2005-11-23T17:01:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	it's simpler if you explain your goal in a bit more detail
2005-11-23T17:03:00.000Z	bob2	daaku	can A connect to C?
2005-11-23T17:04:00.000Z	daaku	bob2	no it cant, b is the only one that can connect to both
