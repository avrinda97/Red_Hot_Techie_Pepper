2010-01-05T00:15:00.000Z	nohup		why would they do that on purpose ?
2010-01-05T00:15:00.000Z	nohup		(and why would ffmpeg then still list the mp3 codect in it's list ?)
2010-01-05T00:17:00.000Z	nohup		will do :)
2010-01-05T00:18:00.000Z	nohup		that should be all that's needed, right ?
2010-01-05T00:19:00.000Z	nohup		ah, never mind
2010-01-05T00:19:00.000Z	nohup		https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ffmpeg/+bug/296922
2010-01-05T00:19:00.000Z	nohup		there's already a report there :)
2010-01-05T00:20:00.000Z	mkanyicy	nohup	just curious which bug did you find?
2010-01-05T00:20:00.000Z	nohup		apt-get install apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-52  should fix it, it says ?
2010-01-05T00:20:00.000Z	nohup		or actually it sais apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-51, which is 52 now :)
2010-01-05T00:20:00.000Z	nohup		is it maybe a license issue or something then ?
2010-01-05T00:21:00.000Z	nohup	mkanyicy	maybe it's not one... but i can't test if it's working anymore now, since i don't have anything to convert on my computer now.. but ffmpeg refused to use libmp3lame. i just read that installing libavcodec-unstripped would fix it
2010-01-05T00:22:00.000Z	mkanyicy	nohup	to decode mp3 or to encode mp3?
2010-01-05T00:23:00.000Z	nohup	mkanyicy	encode
