2007-01-06T07:57:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	I'll have a look, thanks
2007-01-06T07:59:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	the mv builtin can do what you want but find makes it easier - it is still a primitive as you want :)
2007-01-07T17:36:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	gimp? edit pdfs?? since when?
2007-01-07T17:36:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	i agree - i'm askin him to prove it since i do not beleive it
2007-01-07T17:38:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	well.. how about that.. it opened the pdf.. showed me the first page as an image.. wouldn't call it editing though
2007-01-07T17:38:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	I AGREE - SEE MY LAST MESSAGE TO YOU
2007-01-07T17:39:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	ah, didn't see that.. I concur.. importing pdf's is more correct
2007-01-07T17:39:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	especially when somebody asks how to edit PDFs :)
2007-01-07T17:40:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	=).. well.. it did open it...
2007-01-07T17:40:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	:)
2007-01-07T17:47:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	better than konversation and why?
2007-01-07T17:47:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	because I'm running gnome? =).. I haven't tried konversation so I wouldn't know
2007-01-07T17:48:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	oic - a purist :)
2007-01-07T17:49:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	hehe.. nah.. I think I have half of kde installed already.. there are so many nice small programs for kde that doesn't exist for gnome
2007-01-07T06:04:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	so.. how was bitchx?
2007-01-07T06:04:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	i do not like it - i am gui spoiled....
2007-01-07T06:05:00.000Z	Slart	mnoir	hehe.. so the search for the perfect IRC-client goes on
2007-01-07T06:05:00.000Z	mnoir	Slart	i guess i like konversation but i would like an easier way to set highlights
