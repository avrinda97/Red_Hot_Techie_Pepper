2006-06-16T14:25:00.000Z	ulisse		people, what about an iPod that after 3 mins of playing says "impossible to determinate the kind of stream"?
2006-06-16T14:27:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	run 'dmesg' and see if there are lot of I/O errors
2006-06-16T14:28:00.000Z	ulisse	NoUse	yes, i think so, because gtkpod says something about I/O
2006-06-16T14:28:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	known bug, are you running the iPod through a USB hub?
2006-06-16T14:29:00.000Z	ulisse	NoUse	yes, i think (it's not mine, I translate for a friend who speaks oly italian...)

2006-06-16T14:30:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	see if he can run it directly to a USB port on the machine
2006-06-16T14:30:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	it solved similar problems for me
2006-06-16T14:48:00.000Z	ulisse	NoUse	it seems that the ipod is working now! So probably now we have another Ubuntu addicted :)
2006-06-16T14:48:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	was it the usb hub fix?
2006-06-16T14:49:00.000Z	ulisse	NoUse	yes, now it's connected directly to an usb on the motherboard
2006-06-16T14:49:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	cool
2006-06-16T14:50:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	hopefully that will be fixed in edgy but at least it works :-)

2006-06-16T15:40:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	what is that for?
2006-06-16T15:41:00.000Z	ulisse	NoUse	it's an issue with latest fglrx driver, it screws up 3D with radeon9000 cards
2006-06-16T15:41:00.000Z	NoUse	ulisse	where is that documented?
2006-06-16T15:41:00.000Z	ulisse	NoUse	let me see if I can find back where I've found it
