2011-03-21T01:31:00.000Z	RealEyes		i just dont know how to read the language, thats the problem.
2011-03-21T01:31:00.000Z	RealEyes		Im not fluent in Python :P
2011-03-21T01:34:00.000Z	scarleo	RealEyes	did you see that the path is hardcoded? /home/jack/.album I believe you have to change that to your username
2011-03-21T01:35:00.000Z	RealEyes		I have done that.
2011-03-21T01:35:00.000Z	scarleo	RealEyes	tha jack part that is
2011-03-21T01:35:00.000Z	RealEyes		And I even created the ~/.album folder that wasn't there.
2011-03-21T01:35:00.000Z	scarleo	RealEyes	ok
2011-03-21T01:35:00.000Z	RealEyes		But, it's empty.
2011-03-21T01:35:00.000Z	RealEyes		Does anyone here have a ~/.album?
2011-03-21T01:36:00.000Z	RealEyes	scarleo	MrStryker: BRB :P

2011-03-21T01:58:00.000Z	RealEyes		hey, so what'd you suggest, after reading the tut?
2011-03-21T01:59:00.000Z	RealEyes		killall conky
2011-03-21T01:59:00.000Z	RealEyes		lolwhoops
2011-03-21T02:00:00.000Z	scarleo	RealEyes	I suggest you double check all the steps, make sure you haven't missed any hardcoded paths. Other than that I don't know, I don't use conky
