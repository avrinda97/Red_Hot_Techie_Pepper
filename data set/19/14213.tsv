2004-10-31T17:09:00.000Z	swim	beezly	it's baghira for kde
2004-10-31T17:09:00.000Z	beezly	swim	what RPM is it?
2004-10-31T17:11:00.000Z	beezly	swim	it's pretty unpleasant to alien an rpm to a deb then install it
2004-10-31T17:11:00.000Z	swim	beezly	can you assist?
2004-10-31T17:11:00.000Z	beezly	swim	try the debian packages at http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=12498
2004-10-31T17:11:00.000Z	swim	beezly	ok thanks
2004-10-31T17:12:00.000Z	swim	beezly	oh Ive been trying that but have been getting problems
2004-10-31T17:12:00.000Z	beezly	swim	i don't know if it'll work, but it's better to try and install a debian package than alien an rpm
2004-10-31T17:12:00.000Z	beezly	swim	what kind of problems?
2004-10-31T17:14:00.000Z	swim	beezly	lets see: let me try again, I had problems last time I tried... yesterday... where is sources.list?
2004-10-31T17:14:00.000Z	beezly	swim	/etc/apt
2004-10-31T17:17:00.000Z	swim	beezly	Im trying again, but would I have a problem trying to install that package using x86_64 ?
2004-10-31T17:18:00.000Z	beezly	swim	ah right
2004-10-31T17:23:00.000Z	beezly	swim	I don't know tbh... I've not installed x86_64 yet
2004-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	swim	beezly	Im getting this along with many moreerrors: dpkg-gencontrol: error: current build architecture amd64 does not appear in package's list (i386)   
2004-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	swim	beezly	so no way to use this right?
2004-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	beezly	swim	doesn't look like it
2004-10-31T17:30:00.000Z	swim	beezly	thats why I wanted to try one of the x86_64 rpms...
2004-10-31T17:30:00.000Z	beezly	swim	it's really evil to do that.. you might even be better off compiling the source... or waiting til ubuntu has kde included?
