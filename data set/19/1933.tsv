2010-08-28T12:29:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 depends on the issue.. :]
2010-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	p0pc0rn	well_laid_lawn	i have no idea what the issue is
2010-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 k - you are in rescue mode - why?
2010-08-28T12:31:00.000Z	p0pc0rn	well_laid_lawn	i have no idea. when i rebooted my computer i was presented with a text based installer. it looks like the mini installer. i chose rescue mode because it is the closes i can get at this point to booting my current install.
2010-08-28T12:32:00.000Z	p0pc0rn		closest*
2010-08-28T12:32:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 so reading between the lines you couldn't boot so put in a live cd?
2010-08-28T12:32:00.000Z	p0pc0rn	well_laid_lawn	No.
2010-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 where does the installer come into it pls?
2010-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	p0pc0rn	well_laid_lawn	when i start my system
2010-08-28T12:34:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 I think that is the grub boot menu then
2010-08-28T12:35:00.000Z	p0pc0rn	well_laid_lawn	No. It has install options.
2010-08-28T12:36:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	so you are not running a live cd but have the option to install, is that right?
2010-08-28T12:36:00.000Z	p0pc0rn	well_laid_lawn	yes #3
2010-08-28T12:37:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 running of a usb stick ?
2010-08-28T12:37:00.000Z	p0pc0rn		No.
2010-08-28T12:37:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn		k
2010-08-28T12:38:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 I don't know how you got that on the boot menu then - might be quicker to reinstall - unless someone else has a clue
2010-08-28T12:39:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	p0pc0rn	 open the cd player just to check pls
