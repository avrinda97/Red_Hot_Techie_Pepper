2012-11-01T08:44:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		but i cant sudo!
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		it keeps giving me <username is not in the sudoers list>
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		if i am not even in the sudoers list, how can i do what you asked
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		yeah, bad install..even when clicking next all the way, it can "result" in bad install?
2012-11-01T08:46:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		reboot: needs to be root
2012-11-01T08:46:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		lol
2012-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		yes
2012-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		i am
2012-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		more like ubuntu screwed up for not b eing able to install properly
2012-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		so much for VMWare "Easy Install"
2012-11-01T08:51:00.000Z	OerHeks	FISH_SOUP	"clicking next all the way " isn't the way to setup a server.
2012-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP	OerHeks	well, they didnt ask for any other information except username and password
2012-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		what else can i do other than clicking next to continue?
2012-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		i blame this issue on VMWare "Easy Install"
2012-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		doing it manually now
2012-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		lets hope this manual install goes well too
2012-11-01T08:59:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		hmm, isnt it weird why they asked you to select if you would like to install LAMP Server when obviously you are already installing Linux?
2012-11-01T08:59:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		unless you want it to install another Linux on top on Ubuntu
2012-11-01T09:01:00.000Z	OerHeks	FISH_SOUP	maybe you want only ssh & ftp.
