2012-01-26T07:22:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Bsims	wow, beautiful picture there. Love trees in autumn
2012-01-26T07:23:00.000Z	Bsims	Stereocaulon	the pano pic? thats 14 shots all stitched by AI under free software
2012-01-26T07:26:00.000Z	Bsims	Stereocaulon	what are ya trying to do, and when does it fail?
2012-01-26T07:29:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Bsims	well I've tried the tested method of 1) renaming the repos to karmic, mounting the karmic iso and running cdinstall. The procedure failed because ubuntu could not authenticate a massive slew of packets (probably) all.
2012-01-26T07:30:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Bsims	he did not have a separate partition for his /home, so I taught him howto targzip his /home dir and split it into DVDR-sized chunks.
2012-01-26T07:30:00.000Z	Bsims	Stereocaulon	try the server upgrade, if that doesn't work new install and copy home from backup
2012-01-26T07:32:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Bsims	I already tried the server upgrade (Upgrade not supported with this tool: You cannot Upgrade: Distribution End of Life)
2012-01-26T07:33:00.000Z	Bsims	Stereocaulon	then install from new and restore from backup.. worst case delete the kde/gnome home dir and let it recreate it
2012-01-26T07:34:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Bsims	that's exactly why I taught him to zip his /home dir and split it.
