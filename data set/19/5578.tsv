2009-04-08T01:29:00.000Z	_Brun0_		can I have gnome and xfce in my Ubuntu 8.10 installation? Does this use to mess up with anything in gnome or xfce? Also, If most of programs I use are gnome is it worth using xfce interface for better performance?

2009-04-08T01:33:00.000Z	_Brun0_		sebastien, i know i can. I'm ocncerned if there will be a performance gain with xfce. My laptop is not slow, 2GB DD2 and NVidia 8400 video. But I'm always seeking for the better.
2009-04-08T01:35:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	in my experience XFCE4 is much, much faster than either KDE or Gnome, yes
2009-04-08T01:36:00.000Z	_Brun0_	rickest	ty alot. i'll test it.
2009-04-08T01:36:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	Nowadays when I get a new computer, I simply install ubuntu-server, then xfce4.  screams
2009-04-08T01:37:00.000Z	_Brun0_	rickest	does it have any gui?
2009-04-08T01:37:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	yes, IceWM is basic but is basically laid out similar to Windows.  With XFCE4, I disabled panel and run avant-window-navigator with compiz.  it's closer to mac than win
2009-04-08T01:38:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	I think XFCE is the best compromise between small footprint but still completely usable as a full-time GUI if that's your preference
2009-04-08T01:40:00.000Z	_Brun0_	rickest	IceWM rocks i've used it some years ago! Does it messes my system to have xfce or IceWM with gnome?
2009-04-08T01:40:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	not at all
2009-04-08T01:41:00.000Z	_Brun0_	rickest	I might dump xfce to use IceWM now that you remembered me about it. 2 extremes lol.
2009-04-08T01:41:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	yeah, IceWM is another magnitude smaaller than XFCE  :).  I do like compiz, however, and you cannot replaced Ice's WM so that's why I stuck with XFCE
2009-04-08T01:42:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	later, you can even get rid of Gnome with: apt-get purge gnome-desktop
2009-04-08T01:43:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	I'm not necessarily recommending that, just that most folks don't realize ALL the *buntus are the same thing except for what they install by default, and that CAN be changed later w/o having to switch *buntu
2009-04-08T01:44:00.000Z	_Brun0_	rickest	yea they are all the same lion with different clothes =P
2009-04-08T01:45:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	yep.  the various *buntu packages are ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop (XFCE), etc.  Or as I said earlier, you can just install ubuntu-server and then only install the exact packages you want.  less cruft
2009-04-08T01:47:00.000Z	_Brun0_	rickest	ty alot for your tip on the ubuntu server. i'll do that next time: ubuntu server + http://www.masclat.com/cimasclat/Icewm.html
2009-04-08T01:48:00.000Z	rickest	_Brun0_	you don't even have to do it as manual as that web page.  just install ubuntu-server, then 'apt-get install icewm'.  voila
