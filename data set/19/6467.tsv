2009-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	RudyValencia		Hi, why would Ubuntu newer than 8.04 fail to burn properly, when the ISO's MD5 is correct and the CD passed the burning program's check?
2009-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	did you burn as slow as you could?
2009-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	RudyValencia	ActionParsnip	Should I try burning at a low speed?
2009-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	yes for bootable disks
2009-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	if the cd passes consistancy check and the image md5s ok then you have a good ubuntu cd
2009-02-09T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	override it and burn at 8 or 4 which may help
2009-02-09T15:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	then thats ok
2009-02-09T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	is it working ok now?
2009-02-09T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	sweet, yeah most systems dont like CDs burned too fast, plus you get a better burn at lower speeds
2009-02-09T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	makes sense. thats why i never get these drives that do huge speeds
2009-02-09T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	i never burn over 16x
2009-02-09T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	it will be in the livecd environment.
2009-02-09T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	or sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2010-10-13T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	nice
2010-10-17T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	correct
2010-10-17T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	in large partitions you may want to reduce the percentage used as it can start getting massive
2010-10-17T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	yeah, on 2Tb partitions it is a large chunk of space
2010-10-17T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	may help ^
2010-10-17T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RudyValencia	if the nautilus makes it run: add it to your startup items
