2010-05-07T22:42:00.000Z	chmac		Can anyone tell me what the default theme is in lucid? If you click System > Preferences > Appearance, what is selected?
2010-05-07T22:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chmac	 i think its called radience, or ambiance.
2010-05-07T22:43:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	guntbert: Awesome, thanks
2012-06-25T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chmac	 sure its not just the pointer thats invisible?
2012-06-25T16:17:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	I can see the cursor, move it around, but clicking / right clicking / etc has no effect...
2012-06-25T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chmac	 that is.. original.. ;)
2012-06-25T16:18:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	Twice in a row on the same web site, I thought it was a fluke the first time, apparently not, it's reproducible!
2012-06-25T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chmac	 unplug/plug the mouse back in perhaps?
2012-06-25T16:18:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	Apologies, didn't say, laptop!
2012-06-25T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chmac	 whats the url?
2012-06-25T16:19:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	It's the post page for a forum, so you'd need to register an account first, but here's the url http://riviera.angloinfo.com/forum/post.asp?method=Topic&forum_ID=106
2012-06-25T16:20:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	I wrote a post, selected a word, made it into a link, and once I clicked the "OK" button on the javascript prompt, boom, my cursor has been taken over...
2012-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	I was writing a new post, happened before, I rebooted, then tried to post again, and the same thing happened.
2012-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	Even the whole browser won't make any difference, at least it didn't last time.
2012-06-25T16:26:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	I'll try dmesg now...
2012-06-25T16:27:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	xev does not appear to register the clicks
2012-06-25T16:27:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	dmesg produces output and then stops, it's too quick to try clicking while it's running I think.
2012-06-25T16:31:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	Ok, I don't see anything in the end of dmesg about clicks, it's all UFW block messages.
2012-06-25T16:39:00.000Z	chmac	Dr_Willis	Oh shoot, turns out killing firefox did work this time, DOH!
