2005-04-12T07:00:00.000Z	drasko		hi all. How to make midi work on sounblaster live!
2005-04-12T07:01:00.000Z	delire	drasko	check this 'lsmod | grep midi'
2005-04-12T07:06:00.000Z	drasko	delire	ok, I can see snd_seq_midi, snd_seq_midi_emul, snd_emux_synth snd_virmidi, snd_seq_virmidi, snd_seq_midi_event, snd_seq, snd_seq_device snd
2005-04-12T07:07:00.000Z	delire	drasko	well then you have midi support.
2005-04-12T07:09:00.000Z	drasko	delire	yes, but I don't hear anything when midi is played in Muse
2005-04-12T07:09:00.000Z	delire	drasko	try using aconnectgui
2005-04-12T07:11:00.000Z	drasko	delire	what to connect exactly?
2005-04-12T07:12:00.000Z	delire	drasko	do you have it there? dos midi support show up?
2005-04-12T07:12:00.000Z	drasko	delire	no, it gives me segmentation fault, won't open... But I can try with aconnect...
2005-04-12T07:14:00.000Z	drasko	delire	I have emu10k1 uart and 4 emu10k1 ports... Also I have 4 virtual ports... What is all this suppose to be and how to connect?
2005-04-12T07:16:00.000Z	drasko	delire	There are outputs -- client 64: 'EMU10K1 MPU-401 (UART) - Rawmidi 0' [type=kernel] , client 65: 'Emu10k1 WaveTable' [type=kernel]  -- what's the difference here?
2005-04-12T07:17:00.000Z	drasko	delire	for input I have client 64: 'EMU10K1 MPU-401 (UART) - Rawmidi 0' [type=kernel]  -- what's that suppose to be?
2005-04-12T07:28:00.000Z	delire	drasko	the midi driver you have is perfectly ready to use.
2005-04-13T16:59:00.000Z	delire	drasko	still no midi?
2005-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	drasko	delire	no.. I can't hear it... uh.
2005-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	delire	drasko	well that may be Muse's problem, not Ubuntu's
2005-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	drasko	delire	how to check out quick if midi is working?
2005-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	delire	drasko	apt-cache search midi and choose one of many to test it. you can play midi in xmms with a plugin i think
2005-11-24T16:49:00.000Z	delire	drasko	well that is more a question for #debian. i'd suggest 'ifdown eth0; ifup eth1'
