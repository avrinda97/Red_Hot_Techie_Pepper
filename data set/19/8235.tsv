2007-04-20T11:37:00.000Z	Bo7a		does anyone happen to know the best workaround for older ati cards under feisty? rather than downgrade back to edgy i was wondering if it is at all possible to just downgrade X to 7.1 to make the 8.28 drivers which still have support for my card a possibility. apologies for repeat posting, im not doing it to garner attention just to restate for when osmeone has time.
2007-04-20T11:38:00.000Z	Bo7a		and with 8.28 not supporting xorg 7.2 this is an issue :p

2007-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	Bo7a		nope
2007-04-20T11:41:00.000Z	Bo7a		ati pulled support for 9250 and older cards in 8.35 drivers
2007-04-20T11:41:00.000Z	Bo7a		so no 3-d for me unlessi go back to .28
2007-04-20T11:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	is there no legacy package like for nvidia in fesity ?
2007-04-20T11:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	I know its ati not nvidia, hence why I said is there not a legacy package LIKE the nvidia legacy package in fesity
2007-04-20T11:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	I suspect many things are linked against the current xorg in fesity
2007-04-20T11:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	I thought we'd discovered they are not supported
2007-04-20T11:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	so whats the question then, if they are not supported, your out of luck
2007-04-20T11:56:00.000Z	Bo7a	ikonia	please keep your snark to yourself. i was asking a question aboute 'where to go from here' not for an explanation of a problem i understand
2007-04-20T11:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	I'm not being Snakry (??) if the card isn't supported there is nothing you can do ???
2007-04-20T11:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	???? what are you talking about. The card is not supported and not working. If you don't want to wait for ati to fix something - then your only other option is to go back to edgy as you said yourself - so there is nothing you can do
2007-04-20T11:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	but your asking questions that are nothing to do with ubuntu - the ati drivers don't support it, question ati about it
2007-04-20T11:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	so what is the question ?
2007-04-20T12:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	you said yourself the card is not supported by ati - ubuntu can't change this, so your option is to use the "broke" ati driver or bo back to a working senario in edgy
2007-04-20T12:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	its not an ubuntu isse, its the driver issue if its not up to your requirments
2007-04-20T12:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Bo7a	what do you expect though, you don't have a working driver ???? what do you expect people to do  ???
