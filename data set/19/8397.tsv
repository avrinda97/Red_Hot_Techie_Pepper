2007-09-07T12:29:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	is it only totem that is giving you the problem? did you try xine?
2007-09-07T12:30:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	xine doesnt work either
2007-09-07T12:32:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	did you try googling your problem?
2007-09-07T12:33:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	that's a good question from aurous.  Are you able to mount data dvds?
2007-09-07T12:35:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	hmm.... so totem and xine don't work, but vlc does.  strange
2007-09-07T12:37:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	Totem uses gstreamer?
2007-09-07T12:37:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	no idea
2007-11-06T11:12:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	did you try apt-cache search vmware?
2007-11-06T11:13:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	 I used synaptic but essentially the same. I have tried it.
2007-11-06T11:13:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	 I searched in add/remove and it showed up. but not in synaptic
2007-11-06T11:13:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	vmware-player

2007-11-06T11:16:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	is it possible for you to upgrade do something that does have vmware?
2007-11-06T11:16:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	oh i figured it out. It's not showing cuz there is no support for it
2007-11-06T11:17:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	I doubled clicked in add/remove (shows up there) and It says no support
2007-11-06T11:17:00.000Z	punsad	kahrytan	do let that stop you!
2007-11-06T11:18:00.000Z	kahrytan	punsad	I figure gutsy and want to try Vmware's Partition runner
