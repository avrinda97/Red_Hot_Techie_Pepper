2008-01-18T18:51:00.000Z	risjh_		sorry i was disconnected
2008-01-18T18:51:00.000Z	risjh_		yes that seems like an option
2008-01-18T18:52:00.000Z	risjh_		does edubuntu install it by default?
2008-01-18T18:52:00.000Z	risjh_		its not about "normal users" we are university students
2008-01-18T18:52:00.000Z	risjh_		who need to compile stuff as we are learning C/C++
2008-01-18T18:52:00.000Z	risjh_		so i was wondering if it has it by default
2008-01-18T18:52:00.000Z	risjh_		yeah, but we need build0essential to compile stuff
2008-01-18T18:53:00.000Z	risjh_		but when things dont work, its a shame :(
2008-01-18T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	risjh_	build-essential is on the cd, just not installed by default afaik
2008-01-18T18:53:00.000Z	risjh_		on the cd, sure?
2008-01-18T18:54:00.000Z	risjh_	jrib	sure?
2008-01-18T18:54:00.000Z	risjh_		talking about the cd, not the dvd
2008-01-18T18:54:00.000Z	jrib	risjh_	last time I checked, yes.  But I have not needed it from 7.10, so I can't be sure.  Just pop in a CD and check
2008-01-18T18:54:00.000Z	risjh_	jrib	how to check?
2008-01-18T18:54:00.000Z	risjh_	jrib	apt-get install?
2008-01-18T18:55:00.000Z	risjh_		or apt-cache search
2008-01-18T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	risjh_	are you on the live cd or an installed ubuntu?
2008-01-18T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	risjh_	I have to go now for a bit, but others can help you check.  If you have the CD's repository enabled, then yes, you can try to apt-get it directly
