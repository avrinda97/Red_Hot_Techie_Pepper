2010-10-19T21:42:00.000Z	lolcat		Hello
2010-10-19T21:42:00.000Z	lolcat		Would an install on a USB-stick be much slower?
2010-10-19T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 it would be a little slower. but i found them very useable.
2010-10-19T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 you can do a 'normal' install, or a live-cd- Plus persuistant save file.. type install.
2010-10-19T21:43:00.000Z	lolcat	Dr_Willis	I am going to let my gf use MSN, facebok and such on it. I used the usb-creator in Ubuntu. I selected 4GB for changes, it is a 16GB stick
2010-10-19T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 should work fine.
2010-10-19T21:44:00.000Z	lolcat	Dr_Willis	Can I install programs on it?
2010-10-19T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 yes.
2010-10-19T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 just be carefull that the apt cache dosent fill up all the 4gb..
2010-10-19T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 i did a normal install to my big flash drive.
2010-10-19T21:45:00.000Z	lolcat	Dr_Willis	What happens with the leftover space?
2010-10-19T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 kernel updates and video drivers can be an issue
2010-10-19T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 its on a windows partition on the flash drive..   you gave it 4gb to 'use' as its save space...
2010-10-28T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 how did you install to the usb stick?
2010-10-28T16:58:00.000Z	lolcat	Dr_Willis	The tool included with ubuntu.
2010-10-28T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 you made a persistant save file also? really that method is a bit limited and can have 'issues' when trying to update/upgrade the system.  I normaly just use that methiod and install the few apps i need and never 'apt-get update/apt-get upgrade' because it can cause issues.
2010-10-28T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 if you want a fully working like on a HD setup. You may need to do a regular install to the flash drive instead.
2010-10-28T17:00:00.000Z	lolcat	Dr_Willis	Ok, I think that would be smart
2010-10-28T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lolcat	 i tedn to keep my changes to the live-usb setups rather minimal.
