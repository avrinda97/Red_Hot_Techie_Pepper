2006-09-20T13:15:00.000Z	spudds		Just completed the CD rom integrity check. No issues.
2006-09-20T13:16:00.000Z	spudds		Is there any file I can check to see why it's hagning on the kernel boot step?
2006-09-20T13:17:00.000Z	spudds		Having an install/boot problem.  Installed Ubuntu 6.06(?) twice now. Both times, after installation has completed successfully, it gets to the "booting the kernel" message and hangs.  I've verified the install CD is fine.  Looked in /var/log nothing
2006-09-20T13:18:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	hvow can you look in /var/log if your system doesn't boot?
2006-09-20T13:19:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	Recovery mode from the CD, getting a shell and more'ing the file
2006-09-20T13:19:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	but if it doesn't get any further than booting the kernel, syslog isn't running....
2006-09-20T13:19:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	prob. why all the logs are empty :)
2006-09-20T13:20:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	any diagnostic avenues for me?
2006-09-20T13:20:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	ehh
2006-09-20T13:21:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	is there any way to diagnose why the kernel won't boot on my system?
2006-09-20T13:21:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	it's tough
2006-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	Does Ubuntu work inside Vmware?
2006-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	maybe "linux init=/bin/sh" from the bootloader
2006-09-20T13:25:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	got further with linix init=/bin/sh but VFS threw an error VFS: Cannot open root device "<NULL>"
2006-09-20T13:26:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	sounds like your disk isn't recognised at boottime
2006-09-20T13:26:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	It seemed as if it was properly configured and formatted at install time.  Could this be due to multiple scsi disks or vmware settings?
2006-09-20T13:27:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	more likely a wrong disksetting somewhere in vmware
2006-09-20T13:27:00.000Z	spudds	kalif	 Going to try another re-install with a single scsi disk and see what happens. thx for the help
2006-09-20T13:27:00.000Z	kalif	spudds	which scsi-controller are you using?
