2007-09-01T16:33:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		Eh, alright. I suppose I'll wait around some more befor etaking the plunge... Maybe someone's heard of it.
2007-09-01T16:33:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	heared what?
2007-09-01T16:34:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	A virtual serial port for Linux.
2007-09-01T16:34:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	what's wrong with the /dev/ptty* ?
2007-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	Now this is embarrassing... What is /dev/tty*?
2007-09-01T16:36:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	Oh, and, I don't seem to actually have a /dev/tty.
2007-09-01T16:36:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	/dev/tty* are all your serial devices ... you use them for e.g. console login
2007-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	/dev/ttyS0 is your physical serial port
2007-09-01T16:38:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	So if I write to, say, /dev/tty1, I'll write to a vrtual port? Where does the data go?
2007-09-01T16:39:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	? You just said you were writing to the virtual port => data goes to virtual port ... if noone is listening, then data will be 'lost'
2007-09-01T16:39:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	what you want to do?
2007-09-01T16:41:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	We're writing software for hardware connected to a pc through an RS-232. We used to do it in delphi but I want to try Java...  have to get a hang of how it works first though.
2007-09-01T16:42:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	Basically I need a java executable that, when run on a windows box with an RS 232, will be able to write to and read from the port.
2007-09-01T16:42:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	I'd suggest to use the real port (usually /dev/ttyS0)
2007-09-01T16:43:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	Didn't you say that is the physical port?
2007-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	not sure how java accesses it ... perhaps you should check #java instead? (probably there are already ways to do it)
2007-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	I was just thinking of that... Thanks for the tip, I'll go check there.
2007-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	candyban	Ar-Pharazon	yes, exactly ... why 'mess' with virtual ports when you can test it as easily with physical ports?
2007-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	candyban	=D Cuz I don't have one.
