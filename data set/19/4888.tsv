2008-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	probably keep your old settings
2008-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	macvr		but would it include the option for the new kernel?
2008-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	macvr	_grepper	but would it include the option for the new kernel?
2008-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	if you use the new version, it will overwrite your settings, I'd prefer to take a note on the new option and add it manually later
2008-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	macvr	_grepper	oh... so adding the option for the new kernel after the restart would be better?
2008-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	did you customize anything on the menu.lst file?
2008-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	macvr	_grepper	s... a few things were changed...
2008-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	would you mind sharing the new setting
2008-11-01T08:01:00.000Z	macvr	_grepper	new settings? i dont know which u are asking? the settings that i had changed?
2008-11-01T08:02:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	I think the ubuntu installation offer you an option to compare the new and old files, right?
2008-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	you mentioned there are new settings on the menu.lst file you're upgrading to
2008-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	macvr	_grepper	http://paste.ubuntu.com/65524/ <<<
2008-11-01T08:04:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	I'd go with the new version. IIRC, your old version will be backed up with some different extension on the same path, so you can at least reboot and then add your customized settings
2008-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	_grepper		anyone else has an opinion on that?
2008-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	macvr	_grepper	ok... will choose the new settings... thank u...
2008-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	_grepper	macvr	judging from the changes, that's the best way to go... np
