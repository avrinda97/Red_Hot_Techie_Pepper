2009-05-12T11:23:00.000Z	brassmaster1	FPSDavid	Do you have network with the live CD?
2009-05-12T11:23:00.000Z	FPSDavid	brassmaster1	possibly
2009-05-12T11:24:00.000Z	FPSDavid	brassmaster1	i havent tried booting from it
2009-05-12T11:24:00.000Z	FPSDavid	brassmaster1	someone said you cant upgrade by booting from it
2009-05-12T11:24:00.000Z	FPSDavid	brassmaster1	i can check if its important, though
2009-05-12T11:25:00.000Z	brassmaster1	FPSDavid	Well, it might be nice to know that upgrading is going to solve your problem for sure before you waste lots of time doing it.
2009-05-12T11:25:00.000Z	FPSDavid	brassmaster1	alright i'll give it a shot
2009-05-12T11:31:00.000Z	brassmaster1	FPSDavid	chuck_ had a good point when he asked how it is that you burned the .iso to disc, whether you just added the file to a data disc or burned the directory structure described by the image file to disc
2009-05-12T11:40:00.000Z	FPSDavid	brassmaster1	i burned the iso properly, i just booted from it and now the network works
