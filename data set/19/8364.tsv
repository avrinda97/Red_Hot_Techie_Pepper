2007-08-16T06:20:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	strictly computer. I don't game and I hate MS and the other demon called Sony.
2007-08-16T06:22:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	this is not the forum but I like the WII idea. Every since vid games, the most successful ones have been built around an imaginative interface... that's my take.
2007-08-16T06:23:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	so you bought a game console to hack it?
2007-08-16T06:24:00.000Z	Beta-guy	ztomic	no it has built in support for linux
2007-08-16T06:26:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	until it breaks. BTW blueray will die like betamax.
2007-08-16T06:26:00.000Z	Beta-guy	ztomic	Blu-Ray is dominating HD-DVD
2007-08-16T06:30:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	remember when 14.4 KB was fast?
2007-08-16T06:30:00.000Z	Beta-guy	ztomic	thought 2400 baud was fast at one point
2007-08-16T06:31:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	Damn!  youre older than me!
2007-08-16T06:32:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	I used to put the handset in a cradle to  connect to UT mainframe when I took Basic in high school. It was probably slower than 2400. 1979.
2007-08-16T06:34:00.000Z	Beta-guy	ztomic	I was born in 1983 if you were in high school in 1979 your older then me
2007-08-16T06:34:00.000Z	ztomic	Beta-guy	I'm old enough to be your daddy.\
