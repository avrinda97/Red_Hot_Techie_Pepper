2006-06-08T09:22:00.000Z	jackn		Hello. Help with Pan newsreader please?...
2006-06-08T09:22:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	what about it?
2006-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	i use pan, and it works fine. but a lot can vary depending on server.
2006-06-08T09:24:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	you need to get group list from server (whichs is probably huge these days)
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	do you see the list of newsgroups?
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	you need to download that from server if you haven't.
2006-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	i think there's a "server" menu. look for option to download newsgroups.
2006-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	once you have master list (.newsrc) you should see them (LOTS OF THEM) under "other"
2006-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	sorry, not in linux atm.
2006-06-08T09:29:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	hang on, firing up pan
2006-06-08T09:31:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	if you do Server->Get list of all groups, does it work?
2006-06-08T09:34:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	yeah, didn't you see it?
2006-06-08T09:34:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	servers->download all newsgroups ... does that work?
2006-06-08T09:35:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	no servers menu?
2006-06-08T09:35:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	ah... version i'm using isn't on ubuntu (long story) so maybe they changed it?
2006-06-08T09:36:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	nothing under actions?
2006-06-08T09:40:00.000Z	bobstro	jackn	good luck
