2009-09-21T15:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Wo1F	are you sure it is a iso filesystem ? can the file be corrupted ?
2009-09-21T15:26:00.000Z	Wo1F	erUSUL	 well i was using it in windows quiet well :(
2009-09-21T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Wo1F	try "-t auto" instead of "-t iso9660"
2009-09-21T15:28:00.000Z	Wo1F	erUSUL	i did it says: "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
2009-09-21T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Wo1F	and "-t udf" ?
2009-09-21T15:29:00.000Z	Wo1F	erUSUL	 i got same responce like with iso9660 :(
2009-09-21T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Wo1F	what does « file TinyXP-Rev09.iso » says ?
2009-09-21T15:30:00.000Z	Wo1F	erUSUL	TinyXP-Rev09.iso: data
2009-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Wo1F	¡¿?! ? how you created that iso. what program you used in windows to "mount" it ?
2009-09-21T15:34:00.000Z	Wo1F	erUSUL	i could burn it with nero 7 and deamon was mounting it
2009-09-21T15:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Wo1F	i suspect that it is not an iso image but maybe *.nrg or *.bin or something like that... look into converting it with bchunk or similar software

2009-09-21T15:38:00.000Z	Wo1F	erUSUL	ok ty :)
