2009-11-11T17:21:00.000Z	xoveruk		guys, how do i list all my keyboard mappings? I forgot the command
2009-11-11T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	xmodmap maybe?
2009-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	redirection, usually to a file or block device
2009-11-24T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	e.g.   cd ~; ls -a > ~/files.txt; gedit ~/files.txt
2009-11-24T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	will run the ls command but the output will not go to the screen, it will be redirected to the file ~/files.txt
2009-11-24T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	just redirects that output, its the same for any command
2009-11-24T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	-F   == append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
2009-11-24T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	the same
2009-11-24T17:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	it will redirect any output normally headed for the terminal, to a file or block device
2009-11-24T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	its a pipe, you can pipe the output of one command into another
2009-11-24T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	thats what i said, just in not those exact words
2009-11-24T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	the character is called a pip, it pipes the output of one command into another, the 2 commands are proceses so how was I miles off?
2009-11-24T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	you areasking what the characters mean, i am telling you then you say its not. you got some head issues
2009-11-24T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	like i said, it puts the output normlly destined for the terminal to the file
2009-11-24T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	yes
2009-11-24T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	you'll find its what we have said but its your porogotive
2009-11-24T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	i wouldnt get tied up on what they are called, as long as you understand the function it doesnt matter what its name is
2009-11-24T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	whatever
2009-11-24T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xoveruk	welcome to ignore
