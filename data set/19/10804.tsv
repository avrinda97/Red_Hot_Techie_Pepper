2007-12-12T03:25:00.000Z	steve_b		hey can anyone help me - I need a way to use different configurations in different sessions
2007-12-12T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	different configurations of what
2007-12-12T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	create 2 users
2007-12-12T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	I used to do something similar with my laptop for when it was docked or not.
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	I had to write a script at init to detect "something" to work out if it was docked and then put the correct xorg.conf in place.
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	you'll have to script that
2007-12-12T03:28:00.000Z	steve_b	ikonia	is it easy?  what script do I need to edit?  can you point me in the direction of somewhere that I can learn to do this?
2007-12-12T03:28:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	its not straight forward, more so for you as you want a different setting based on your desktop
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	steve_b	ikonia	what I was thinking is that I need multiple xconf files
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	thats correct
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	however by the time you login, X is already running so you'll need to restart, in which case you'll get logged out
2007-12-12T03:30:00.000Z	steve_b	ikonia	so how do I make it so that I can switch between them?  is there a command line utility that reloads the config that I can run from a script?
2007-12-12T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	I can't figure a way to do it that way
2007-12-12T03:30:00.000Z	steve_b	ikonia	I meant reload the config
2007-12-12T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	you can init it before xorg loads, but I don't know how to dynamically do it
2007-12-12T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	try #xorg see if they have any options
2007-12-12T03:31:00.000Z	steve_b	ikonia	ok will do.  Thanks for your help
2007-12-12T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	steve_b	sorry its not easy
2007-12-12T03:31:00.000Z	steve_b	ikonia	heh heh nothing ever is....
