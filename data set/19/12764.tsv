2005-07-12T14:48:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	Yes; I have 2GB and cannot perform a server installation (it appears).
2005-07-12T14:50:00.000Z	delire	HaroldJohnson	i think nalioth has the right approach. a clean minimal install from the boot prompt.
2005-07-12T14:51:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	I just tried doing that, but the boot prompt doesn't seem to be accessible here.  It's ash, right?  I'm able to get into ash, but when I typed "server" at the prompt nothing happened.
2005-07-12T14:52:00.000Z	delire	HaroldJohnson	hmm.. there must be material online about this.
2005-07-12T14:52:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	There is, but not for a server install on an Old World PowerBook.
2005-07-12T14:54:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	When are you going to start placing those Intel chips in the Apple Powerbooks?
2005-07-12T14:55:00.000Z	delire	HaroldJohnson	hehe i don't know, i think the iBooks and PB are pretty shitty anyway. i would never consider one.
2005-07-12T14:57:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	and nalioth: I love the look (form factor) of the newer iBook and Powerbook G4 lines, but I wonder about the ergonomics.  The PowerBook G3 series had good ergo.
2005-07-12T14:58:00.000Z	delire	HaroldJohnson	nalioth: the next generation iBooks and PB's will continue to be made by this company Asustek, and will probably looks similar to this (i predict): http://store.agearnotebooks.com/asusw5aphotos.html
2005-07-12T15:00:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	Those are a bit thinner than the older Powerbooks, aren't they?
2005-07-12T15:00:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	Oops, i mean the current Powerbooks.
2005-07-12T15:01:00.000Z	delire	HaroldJohnson	yes..
2005-07-12T15:01:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	Thinner would make sense for Apple, and a change in color scheme to match the iPod lineup.
2005-07-12T15:02:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	Change in color, as in something neutral, yet matching iPods.
2005-07-12T15:02:00.000Z	delire	HaroldJohnson	i agree.. i'm not sure about the company really and where it's going albeit.
2005-07-12T15:03:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	and nalioth: I think Apple is also looking to lower their prices a bit, *perhaps*.  Reach more of the Mac mini market.
2005-07-12T15:03:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	and nalioth: No, but they *could* lower their prices, probably, once the Intel Mac hit the market.
2005-07-12T15:06:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	delire	Take it easy
