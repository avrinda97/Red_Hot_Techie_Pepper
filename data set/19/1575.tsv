2010-12-19T21:57:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d		most wifi cards are pain
2010-12-19T21:58:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	not really... atheros/intel, typically just "work"... broadcom/ralink just require installing firmware/restricted drivers... not that hard once you figure it out.
2010-12-19T21:58:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	KM0201	i had to fight with my broadcom.
2010-12-19T21:59:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	which broadcom?.. most of them.. use either the new STA driver, or the b43 driver/firmware.. both of which are in the repositories and take about 10sec to install
2010-12-19T21:59:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	KM0201	had to patch my kernel , install fakeroot , slap my mother
2010-12-19T21:59:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	what?... which broadcom
2010-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	KM0201	, BCM4321
2010-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	what version of Ubuntu? that really should not have been such an issue
2010-12-19T23:34:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	he'll learn.. i was just hoping to get him to go away
2010-12-20T08:54:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	yup.. the little "windows" key on your keyboard, usually by control or alt
2010-12-20T08:55:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	well that is obviously linux's fault
2010-12-23T10:25:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	i had that for a while.
2011-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	i'v enever understood why people think the OS should assign a static IP...
2011-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	i understand that, but set it up through your router..
2011-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	the other way, seems like saying "I need to stop and get gas, so i'll wait till I run out then walk to the gas station"
2011-01-03T06:41:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	KM0201	negative , in synaptic there is a version that has no kde dep
2011-01-03T06:41:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	is that right?... hmm, !info listed it as a KDE app..
2011-01-14T02:49:00.000Z	KM0201	r00t4rd3d	lmao!
