2010-11-05T19:41:00.000Z	mibbed		I have a problem with a dual boot
2010-11-05T19:41:00.000Z	mibbed		I installed ubuntu on a second HDD
2010-11-05T19:41:00.000Z	mibbed		with windows 7 on the first
2010-11-05T19:41:00.000Z	mibbed		and intended it to be swapped over to my other machine
2010-11-05T19:42:00.000Z	mibbed		which has no disc drive or network connection
2010-11-05T19:42:00.000Z	mibbed		but now the boot loader is messed up and I can't get into windows
2010-11-05T19:42:00.000Z	mibbed		can't find any instructions that are specific to this, so I wondered if anyone here could help
2010-11-05T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mibbed	you need an install CD or network connection to install os-probrer  then run: sudo os-prober
2010-11-05T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mibbed	pretty much
2010-11-05T19:44:00.000Z	mibbed	ActionParsnip	great, thanks :D
2010-11-05T19:47:00.000Z	mibbed	ActionParsnip	I didn't get any output, did it work?
2010-11-05T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mibbed	ok now run: sudo update-grub
2010-11-05T19:48:00.000Z	mibbed	ActionParsnip	done, more talkative this time
2010-11-05T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mibbed	do you see windows in the list of output?
2010-11-05T19:51:00.000Z	mibbed	ActionParsnip	so if it isn't showing, do I need to unmount the drive it's on or something?
2010-11-05T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mibbed	no, you just need more work. Usually os-prober inds bootable OSes
2010-11-05T19:56:00.000Z	mibbed	ActionParsnip	All the things it finds are in its own file system, if that changes anything. Is there any way I can get windows to boot without using grub?
2010-11-05T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mibbed	if the OS is on a seperate drive you can simply switch in BIOS. If you boot to windows CD and reinstate the windows boot loader then boot to ubuntu live CD and reinstate grub it should pickup the windows boot
2010-11-05T19:58:00.000Z	mibbed	ActionParsnip	excellent, I'll try that. Thanks
