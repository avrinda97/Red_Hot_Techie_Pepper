2007-11-07T19:52:00.000Z	LjL		only the proprietary driver currently provides usable hardware acceleration
2007-11-07T19:53:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	thanks, but the newest thing I see on that page is for 7.04
2007-11-07T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	that's because in 7.10 you're supposed to just use the Restricted Driver Manager
2007-11-07T19:54:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	exactly.  That's why I was asking for a doc on how to do it in 7.10 .. the links I found were outdated
2007-11-07T19:54:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	but just using the restricted manager fails for you?
2007-11-07T19:54:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	I installed ubuntu for the first time yesterday, so I don't even know how to get to the restricted manager
2007-11-07T19:55:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	from that very page i gave you: As of Kubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) the recommended way to install the binary driver is to open System Settings KMenu â†’ System Settings, go to the Advanced tab and click Restricted Drivers. Then click the Administrator Mode button and check the box marked Enable to install the driver. This should install the right package for your card and set it up for you.
2007-11-07T19:55:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	err not the kubuntu version though
2007-11-07T19:55:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	sorry, I ignore that because I didn't think I was using Kubuntu
2007-11-07T19:56:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	you're quite right, that wiki page is missing something. namely, the correct instructions. hold on
2007-11-07T19:56:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	the instructions are the same as for 7.04 using restricted manager. it just doesn't say that they're valid for 7.10 :|
2007-11-07T19:56:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	thanks ... just offering the problems a new/naive user gets.  :)
2007-11-07T19:59:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	thanks, restarting
2007-11-07T19:59:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	please tell me how it goes with the restricted manager. if it works exactly as those instructions say (i use KDE, i can't check myself), i'll edit the wiki to make it clear that 7.10 is covered too
2007-11-07T20:03:00.000Z	jorvis	LjL	it seems to have worked.  When I run glxgears now I get around 10,000 fps, but this is about half of what I get when I restart into gentoo.  Is there more I can do to make this better?
2007-11-07T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	glxgears is NOT a benchmark, and it should only be used as an indication of whether or not you have hardware acceleration working. get GLOBS if you want a benchmark.
2007-11-07T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	GLOBS is not in the repositories, but i believe an Ubuntu package is available upstream
2007-11-07T20:07:00.000Z	LjL	jorvis	uhm there are a few, i'm not entirely sure *which* one is the correct one to use with nvidia, possibly libgl1-mesa-glx
