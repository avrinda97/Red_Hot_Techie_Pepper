2006-09-12T10:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	do you have a stock sources.list, or is yours customized somehow?
2006-09-12T10:30:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	original with additions - please review at : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23181
2006-09-12T10:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	your sources.list is a bit messed up, that could be why you're getting those errors - rebuild it and try again
2006-09-12T10:46:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	have gone back to original and added only 2 - 1 for mplayer and 1 other at the end - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23183
2006-09-12T10:47:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	I still get the darn libclamav1 held back!
2006-09-12T10:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	you probably need to get that Debian repo out of there. Debian & Ubuntu are not compatible
2006-09-12T10:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	not at the binary repo level, anyway
2006-09-12T10:48:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	ok - thank you - will do
2006-09-12T10:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	try http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17674 for your sources.list
2006-09-12T10:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	only one you'll need to add to that is the dapper commercial repo - let Add/Remove Apps do that
2006-09-12T10:52:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	thank you for you time - again - I am using it and will post result so you can sleep at night
2006-09-12T10:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	not a problem, hope things work out from now on - just be careful what you stick in sources.list - it's far too easy to screw up your Ubuntu that way
2006-09-12T11:45:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	apt-get now says 0.82 installed - but I can find no reverence to it - nor can I start it ip <ugh>
2006-09-12T11:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	is this clamav still? I know zip about it, actually. I don't bother running any AV on Ubuntu myself.
2006-09-12T11:46:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	Yup and I am about to give up for a while
2006-09-12T11:48:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	I had a lot of trouble getting spamassassin to work on ubuntu - I am a little dissapointed - there are a few things that still need to be tidied up - when is the new version due - do you know?
2006-09-12T11:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	no idea, I use gmail for my main email and they have excellent spam filters
2006-09-12T11:49:00.000Z	dannyr	Madpilot	that works for you - but I have to support linux here - and I am having some trouble replicating the production box
2006-09-12T11:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	dannyr	fair enough - I'm purely a desktop/home user, not a server guy
