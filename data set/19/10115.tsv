2009-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	there's one for not calling people noobs in here,  so I was thinking maybe for idiot to,  but calling yourself it hmm
2009-09-17T07:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	heh no you weren't
2009-09-17T07:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	you were off topic before though
2009-09-17T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	apt get manage ????  what are you on about
2009-09-17T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	I thought Suse used yum?
2009-09-17T07:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	there's apt and synaptic a GUI for it
2009-09-17T07:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	in Ubuntu
2009-09-17T07:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	and   the add/remove GUI as well which can't do as much as synaptic by a long way
2009-09-17T07:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	ah ha I see
2009-09-17T07:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	ok  Ubuntu  uses  DEB instead of  RPM,  no not Debian Debs,  Ubuntu Debs
2009-09-17T07:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	there is also  Alien  which can convert a RPM into a  DEB, it is also apparantly dangerous,   but  that's apparantly not true,  according to some people,  that have used it and that
2009-09-17T07:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	yes it's based on Debian, but there are quite a few differences here and there
2009-09-17T07:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	as a result you don't use Debian DEBS on Ubuntu  instead you use Ubuntu DEBS
2009-09-17T07:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	if you missed it, see above for the alien stuff
2009-09-17T07:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	justin-	oh so something happended to you, and you missed the alien stuff?
