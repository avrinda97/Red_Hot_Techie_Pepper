2009-11-21T21:01:00.000Z	epinky	aiwata55	"sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin" ?
2009-11-21T21:02:00.000Z	aiwata55	epinky	I ran the command as root
2009-11-21T21:03:00.000Z	epinky	aiwata55	it didn't work (as root)?
2009-11-21T21:03:00.000Z	aiwata55	epinky	no

2009-11-21T21:12:00.000Z	aiwata55	epinky	http://paste.ubuntu.com/324451/
2009-11-21T21:13:00.000Z	epinky	aiwata55	enter synaptic, then configuration, repositories and add the universe and multiverse repositories for all the categories
2009-11-21T21:17:00.000Z	aiwata55	epinky	thank you for the advice, but I don't understand the Unix terms at all
2009-11-21T21:18:00.000Z	epinky	aiwata55	did you enter Synaptic?
2009-11-21T21:21:00.000Z	epinky	aiwata55	I know this is a bit outdated but the procedure is similar for Karmic 9.10 , check this and try http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-enable-the-universe-and-multiverse-repositories-in-ubuntu-804-hardy.html
2009-11-21T22:13:00.000Z	epinky	aiwata55	you're welcome, glad you've solved it :)
