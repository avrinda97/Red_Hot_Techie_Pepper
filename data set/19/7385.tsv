2007-09-03T12:37:00.000Z	wolfsong		anyone know why I would get an out of memory error when trying to mount shares on one of my winboxes but not the other?
2007-09-03T12:38:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	try increaasing your paging file
2007-09-03T12:39:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	how?
2007-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	the error is in mount/fstab
2007-09-03T12:49:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	what size, in human, is your swap file?
2007-09-03T12:49:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	human?
2007-09-03T12:50:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	1.8GB
2007-09-03T12:52:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	copy the swap line in /etc/fstab for us
2007-09-03T12:55:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	sudo first
2007-09-03T12:57:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	if u can help it, try not to use uid,
2007-09-03T12:57:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	that'll just confuse the heck out of you
2007-09-03T12:59:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	apparently
2007-09-03T12:59:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	nope
2007-09-03T13:46:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	yes
2007-09-03T14:45:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	not sure yet...rebooting the winbox...had an idea
2007-09-03T14:46:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	it may be a problem with the way the win shares are configured
2007-09-03T15:08:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	can you swapon /dev/sda2 yet?
2007-09-03T15:09:00.000Z	wolfsong	WONToN	i did that earlier but i still have mem errors with the win shares
2007-09-03T15:10:00.000Z	WONToN	wolfsong	so after that whole thing, it wasn't ram, but smb shares?
