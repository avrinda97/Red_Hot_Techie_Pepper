2004-12-27T17:42:00.000Z	nakee		hey
2004-12-27T17:42:00.000Z	nakee		who is the guy responsible for localization?
2004-12-27T17:43:00.000Z	daniels	nakee	there is no single point of contact for localisation
2004-12-27T17:45:00.000Z	nakee	daniels	there is a listed team leader, just no details about him beside his name
2004-12-27T17:46:00.000Z	nakee		the universaty I study/work in is intrested in making a project to push hebrew into linux desktop as much as possible
2004-12-27T17:46:00.000Z	nakee		I thought about recommanding them to use debian at start
2004-12-27T17:47:00.000Z	nakee		but since we want to use stable and we don't want our patchs to be released only in 2 years
2004-12-27T17:47:00.000Z	nakee		that using ubuntu might be better idea:)
2004-12-27T17:47:00.000Z	nakee		Anyhow I think it would work much better with collaberiation from the distribution we chose
2004-12-27T17:48:00.000Z	nakee		and I wonder how intrested would ubuntu be in it
2004-12-27T17:48:00.000Z	nakee	daniels	so I need to know who I should talk to:) any idea?
2004-12-27T17:48:00.000Z	daniels	nakee	very interested, of course
2004-12-27T17:48:00.000Z	daniels		email ubuntu-devel if you like
2004-12-27T17:48:00.000Z	daniels		but 'we would like to do stuff' ... well, there's nothing much useful we can say
2004-12-27T17:49:00.000Z	daniels	nakee	daf works on rosetta for canonical
2004-12-27T17:49:00.000Z	nakee	daniels	ofcourse help with the technical how things should be done to be easily integrated, willingness to work and advise on bidi patchs
2004-12-27T17:50:00.000Z	daniels	nakee	easily integrated -> submit .po files, bidi patches -> file them in bugzilla
2004-12-27T17:51:00.000Z	daniels		[dEvIL-bOy] : http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/root
2004-12-27T17:54:00.000Z	nakee	daniels	well if they decide on using ubuntu (and would officialy approve the project) I would probebly come back with more specific questions:)
