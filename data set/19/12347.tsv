2005-09-30T13:38:00.000Z	Knelix		I guess not.
2005-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	Knelix		Hey guys... is there any local app/protocol I can use to send instant text messages (ala AIM, etc) from between my Mac OS X and x86 Ubuntu machines without sending it all around the Internet?
2005-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	nybble	Knelix	like rendevouz?
2005-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	yes.
2005-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	nybble	Knelix	err... Bonjour
2005-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	Hehe. Exactly.
2005-09-30T05:12:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	That would certainly make things easy.
2005-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	Yes, there is a developmental gaim plugin for Bonjour, but it seems I need to compile the source and so forth... which I've never really done before on Linux.
2005-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	nybble	Knelix	want me to give it a go?
2005-09-30T05:30:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	I wasn't really suggesting that, but if you'd like to sure. ;-) Here's where I found the info: http://gaim.sourceforge.net/summerofcode/juanjo/
2005-09-30T05:31:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	It's the third paragraph in the top entry.
2005-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	It's surprising to me that there isn't an included local text computer to computer app/protocol natively included in all systems.
2005-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	I mean, AIM is fine, but do you really want to rely on a remote, external server all the time, and send your private network chat halfway around the world just to talk to your neighboring computer? Geez...
2005-09-30T05:36:00.000Z	nybble	Knelix	well, the one thing needed (howl) is in the repos
2005-09-30T05:37:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	Okay, so I just download howl and I can install the plugin? Lemme look...
2005-09-30T05:40:00.000Z	nybble	Knelix	ok
2005-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	I was sent you a private message... don't know if you got it.
2005-09-30T05:51:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	I was able to install howl, thanks to your instructions.
2005-09-30T05:52:00.000Z	Knelix	nybble	Now, I'm trying to figure out what else to do. :-)
