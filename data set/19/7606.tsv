2007-07-26T13:43:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	you ever noticed how suspicious ie7pro is? there's something really bad going on with that add-on, must be
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	what plugin handles those?
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	Going4Linux	Anlar	dunno.. its firefox..
2007-07-26T13:47:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	I have no idea why, but the totem plugin is 20x more stable (never crashes browser no matter what) with Epiphany.. with firefox it just sucks, and you'd better off with mplayer-plugin perhaps
2007-07-26T13:48:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	about:plugins tells btw that information
2007-07-26T13:59:00.000Z	Going4Linux	Anlar	thats reboot the gui, i thought linux never had reboots
2007-07-26T13:57:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	actually most of the config files are in same places due LSB, and you usually don't have to edit them anyways nowadays
2007-07-26T13:58:00.000Z	Going4Linux	Anlar	LSB? and how to get READ graphics drivers to work without edit thet xorg file and reboot linux?
2007-07-26T13:59:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	there's no xorg.config on newest versions at all, it's automatic. and you don't have to reboot, just ctrl-alt-backspace is enough :)
2007-07-26T14:00:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	mu.
2007-07-26T14:01:00.000Z	Going4Linux	Anlar	mu? are you a cow now?
2007-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	read on http://dict.die.net/mu/ :)
2007-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	you know, linux isn't really better. it is just a tool, and your needs dictate what is better and what you should use.
2007-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	if you feel that Windows is better, then stick with it :)
2007-07-26T14:08:00.000Z	Going4Linux	Anlar	but the site http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/ said linux is so much better then windows
2007-07-26T14:09:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	there are a lot of zealots and fanboys making those pages. but seriously, what you have now is general change resistance. you are against linux providing equivalent things DIFFERENTLY. it is not even always meant to be alike actually.
2007-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	Going4Linux	Anlar	oki, but i saw one page they wrote firefox protects your from virus and stuff like that, is firefox a browser AND antivirus ?
2007-07-26T14:11:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	no, firefox is plain honestly complete trash if you take a closer look at the quality of that application.
2007-07-26T14:12:00.000Z	Anlar	Going4Linux	you really might be surprised to try out for instance konqueror and then having one of those cases where your multimedia plugin goes haywire. nothing special will happen. no crash. and it renders the page at least equally well and is meaner and leaner. :) (no, I don't use konqueror myself - that was just an example)
