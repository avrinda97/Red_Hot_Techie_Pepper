2007-08-13T07:11:00.000Z	BCMM		is there a way to regenerate the default xorg.conf?
2007-08-13T07:12:00.000Z	BCMM		sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg asks questions and stuff, right?
2007-08-13T07:12:00.000Z	BCMM		is there not a way to just get the same defaults which the installer chose?

2007-08-13T07:13:00.000Z	BCMM	IdleOne	if i go through that hitting enter, i'll get the same results as the installer?

2007-08-13T07:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	BCMM	oh sorry I misread
2007-08-13T07:19:00.000Z	BCMM	IdleOne	i run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and first thing i see it's asking me which driver
2007-08-13T07:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	BCMM	does it give you coices?
2007-08-13T07:20:00.000Z	BCMM	IdleOne	yes

2007-08-13T07:21:00.000Z	BCMM	IdleOne	but then it will ask me about EVERYTHING
2007-08-13T07:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	BCMM	after that it should give you some default answers go with those
2007-08-13T07:22:00.000Z	BCMM	IdleOne	no. it's all based on answers from last time
