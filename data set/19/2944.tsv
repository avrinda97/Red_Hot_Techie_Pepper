2009-11-22T12:23:00.000Z	mcurran		NTLDR is a part of the vista bootloader

2009-11-22T12:25:00.000Z	mcurran		oh
2009-11-22T12:25:00.000Z	ghem	mcurran	how do I check?
2009-11-22T12:26:00.000Z	mcurran	ghem	 There's a command to locate grub but I don't remember what it is - google maybe
2009-11-22T12:27:00.000Z	ghem	mcurran	/boot/grub/grub.cfg is on /dev/sda1 if thats whay your were asking
2009-11-22T12:30:00.000Z	ghem	mcurran	the linux partition already has boot flag
2009-11-22T12:35:00.000Z	mcurran	ghem	 Now you should check it out and see if there's an entry for XP
2009-11-22T12:36:00.000Z	ghem	mcurran	grub.cfg has the entry from this: http://grub2xp.pastebin.com/d1fb43394
2009-11-22T12:56:00.000Z	mcurran	ghem	 You probably need a chainload option in grub2
2009-11-22T12:57:00.000Z	ghem	mcurran	I have     chainloader +1
2009-11-22T12:59:00.000Z	ghem	mcurran	thanks for help
