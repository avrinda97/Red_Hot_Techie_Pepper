2009-05-15T00:32:00.000Z	ExAstris		it says I have broken packages. How can I fix this?
2009-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ExAstris	aptitude safe-upgrade
2009-05-15T00:35:00.000Z	ExAstris	PhotoJim	running that now
2009-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	ExAstris		blargh.
2009-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	ExAstris		I may just DL the source and build it... but I think that'd take forever
2009-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	ExAstris	PhotoJim	what should I do when that completes?
2009-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	ExAstris		Attempt the install again?
2009-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ExAstris	I didn't see your original problem, but that will install those "not upgraded" packages.
2009-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	ExAstris	PhotoJim	my original is that I can't install openoffice.org
2009-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ExAstris	well, this is a good step then. your system will be completely up-to-date.  and then you can try installing it again.
2009-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	ExAstris	PhotoJim	It gives me an error about openoffice.org-writer2latex not being installed, so I try to install that and it says openoffice.org-core isn't installed. I try to use that but it doesn't fix the problem
2009-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		yep, error
2009-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2009-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		  openoffice.org: Depends: openoffice.org-writer2latex but it is not going to be installed
2009-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		E: Broken packages
2009-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ExAstris	it should handle the dependencies together.  but you can multiinstall, e.g. aptitude install openoffice.org-writer2latex openoffice.org-core ... should not be necessary though.
2009-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	ExAstris	PhotoJim	let me try...
2009-05-15T00:40:00.000Z	ExAstris		yay now it's installing; thanks PhotoJim
2009-05-15T00:40:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ExAstris	glad to help :)
