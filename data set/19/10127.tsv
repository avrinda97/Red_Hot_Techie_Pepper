2009-11-05T00:11:00.000Z	Nokio		Hi all, When i try to do a apt-get upgrade it get a lot of package to be installed i say yes and it download it. Then i get to the preconfiguration and the proccess dpkg-preconfigure spawn but turn to zombie right away. What can i do to be able tp upgrade properly ?!
2009-11-05T00:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	upgrade aye?  9.04 to 9.10 you  mean or?
2009-11-05T00:13:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: well i did an upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04 and i think something went wrong..... i can still boot it but i cant get to gdm and there seems to be some broken package. So i did an apt-get update then upgrade to see if i could fix it.
2009-11-05T00:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	oh you recently went from 8.10 to 9.04?
2009-11-05T00:13:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: yes
2009-11-05T00:16:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: any idea of what could be done to try ti fix this ?!
2009-11-05T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	broken package managers or whatever hmm,  Synaptic has something that can fix  stuff like that
2009-11-05T00:17:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	anything that can be done from the cli ?!
2009-11-05T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	by the way if you upgrade  9.04 to 9.10,  you may end up with other issues,  a lot of people have ended up with issues after upgrading from 9.04
2009-11-05T00:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	probably, but I am not sure about that
2009-11-05T00:18:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: i wont upgrade for now hehe all i want for now is to get my 9.04 to work properly then ill wait before i get up to 9.10
2009-11-05T00:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	or just skip it and do 10.04
2009-11-05T00:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	a clean install yes :)
2009-11-05T00:19:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: probably that for 10.04 it will be a clean reinstaller or yes skip 9.10 and up to 10.04 but for now i need to get this working since im using it as a server hehe !
2009-11-05T00:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	oh  no
2009-11-05T00:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	well  proper servers  are meant to be run on the LTS
2009-11-05T00:20:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: i know but still hehe !
2009-11-05T00:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nokio	I was going to suggest that ask the question again,  so someone else can hopefuly help
2009-11-05T00:22:00.000Z	Nokio	sebsebseb	: hehe thanks for the help ill try that
