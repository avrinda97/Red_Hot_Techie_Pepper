2005-09-01T05:05:00.000Z	Yukimaruo		Hello, I ude to run Fedora core 3 on my box, and I want to covert to Ubuntu but before I did that I tryed out Gentoo... but my install failed, and I fear that I did something wrong with the install because now I tryed to install Ununtu and when it boots up I cant use the keyboard to hit "Enter" and I though it might be the CD but I also tryed the Fedora CDs and they did not work as well. I also checked the keyboard on another computer and
2005-09-01T05:06:00.000Z	Yukimaruo		I think its a geometry problem, does anyone know how i can wipe my entire HD out without an OS
2005-09-01T05:07:00.000Z	Yukimaruo		oblibm i dont know... how do i get to BIOS?
2005-09-01T05:07:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 usually you hit "DEL" when booting
2005-09-01T05:08:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	during POST
2005-09-01T05:08:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 it doesnt sound like an issue with your Harddisk that your keyboard is nto responing
2005-09-01T05:10:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 if you boot from CD, then the harddisk isnt relly 'involved' in the process
2005-09-01T05:14:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 it doenst sound like a software-issue to me
2005-09-01T05:15:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 f.ex if the Keyboard has been working with a FC3 bootable cd before, and not now, it really has nothing todo with your harddrive nor it's content
2005-09-01T05:15:00.000Z	Yukimaruo	kemik	what should i do then...
2005-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 try another keyboard would be the simples solution imo
2005-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	Yukimaruo	kemik	i already tryed 3 keoboards
2005-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 all USB keyboards ?
2005-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 as oblib says, if you cannot access BIOS.. then somethings fubar with your hardwere
2005-09-01T05:18:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 yes, usually, consult your manual
2005-09-01T05:18:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 there's usually a jumper that you'll have to set/unset
2005-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	kemik	Yukimaruo	 and make sure you're grounded before touching the greenstuff with silicon ;)
