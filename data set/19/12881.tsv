2005-06-18T12:25:00.000Z	J0el		how can i write to my ntfs partition?
2005-06-18T12:25:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	I wouldn't, data corruption is possible
2005-06-18T12:25:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	if you still want to try, use captive_ntfs
2005-06-18T12:26:00.000Z	J0el	seth_k	.. hmm so i guess ill have to convert it back to fat :\
2005-06-18T12:27:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	recommended. No benefits in not using FAT for a windows-linux share partition
2005-06-18T12:28:00.000Z	J0el	seth_k	i have xp installed on the ntfs part and most of my files are there.
2005-06-18T12:30:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	rather than converting the whole partition, just make a share partition so you can swap files back and forth between OSes
2005-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	or you could use explore2fs
2005-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	it's a windows program that lets you r/w ext2, ro ext3
2005-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	J0el	seth_k	yea ill try that.
2005-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	you want a bootsplash, or a graphical grub menu?
2005-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	J0el	seth_k	a bootsplash .. if thats what its called.
2005-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	check out Splashy
2005-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	http://wiki.nanofreesoft.org/index.php/Splashy
2005-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	J0el	seth_k	its a package?
2005-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	J0el	seth_k	hrm k.
2005-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	seth_k	J0el	there are sources there to add to your sources.list
