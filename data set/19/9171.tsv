2006-12-17T16:17:00.000Z	TheKittenEater		Anyone awake? Heh. I need a little help here, I'm really new to Ubuntu and Linux in general. I just installed 6.06, but there's a little problem. My laptop has a 15" Widescreen, but the only resolution options are for 5:4 Monitors. I'd like to use 1280x800, any ideas?
2006-12-17T16:19:00.000Z	TheKittenEater		Errr... Do you guys know of any tutorials for that? I'm really new to Linux, not familiar with any commands or anything...
2006-12-17T16:19:00.000Z	TheKittenEater		Thanks a ton!
2006-12-17T16:19:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Which card do you have?
2006-12-17T16:20:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Then you need two things:
2006-12-17T16:20:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Plenty of time (and a kitten for throwing against a wall sometimes)
2006-12-17T16:21:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	1st edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-12-17T16:21:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Do you know how to do that?
2006-12-17T16:22:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Are you on Ubuntu (Gnome) or Kubuntu (KDE)?
2006-12-17T16:23:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	So try to open a terminal (there must be a menu entry)
2006-12-17T16:24:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Type `sudo -s` (without the ``)
2006-12-17T16:24:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	and enter your pw.
2006-12-17T16:24:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Now your command prompt should have changed from "$" to "#".
2006-12-17T16:25:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	`nano /etc/apt/sources.list`
2006-12-17T16:27:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	look for a line taht ends with "universe" and remove the "#" at the beginning
2006-12-17T16:29:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Stop. While you were searching I looked it up and found that editing of sources.list  is not nesseccary for ATI.
2006-12-17T16:31:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	So let's interrup step 1 by pressing F2 for closing the editor nano and say "No" to saving any changes.
2006-12-17T16:42:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	Already finished installing ATI driver?
2006-12-17T16:44:00.000Z	christiane	TheKittenEater	I found this wiki that should help you: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide
