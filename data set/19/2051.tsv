2010-07-25T10:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 what all is on it right now?
2010-08-10T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 its .bashrc
2010-08-10T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 if you mean the bash startup scripts
2010-08-10T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	i dont know what you are trying to do.. read the .bashrc and learn its layout.
2010-08-10T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	time to learn some bash then i guess.. its rather straight forward i thought.
2010-08-10T04:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 all 90% of it is doing is setting  ariables
2010-08-10T04:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 theres dozens of web sites and books on 'learning bash'
2010-08-10T04:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	I have to ask why are you messing with the .bashrc exactly if you dont know any bash? what are you trying to do?
2010-08-10T04:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 you want EVER terminal you open to do this? I think you are confused about some things.
2010-08-10T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	You can start conky from  the gnome startup manager tookls/system. NOT .bashrc
2010-08-10T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 .bashrc is ONLY for bash specific stuff.
2010-08-10T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 theres Dozens of 'wallpaper changer' tools out there.
2010-08-10T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 check out  http://www.webilder.org  for a neat wallpaper changer
2010-08-10T04:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RealEyes	 webilder? You are confuised then. i see no mention of a radio swbsite.. --> Webilder delivers stunning wallpapers to your Linux desktop, directly from Flickr and Webshots.
