2009-03-28T03:43:00.000Z	bluenzo	remoteCTRL	i need to restore grub, i just fixed windows mbr, i finally just got back into windows... Last time i tried "setup (hd0,0)" i think, and it was on the wrong HDD (i have 4 HDDs) i dont know which one im supossed to select
2009-03-28T03:43:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	bluenzo	oh i see you grub is gone from the mbr
2009-03-28T03:43:00.000Z	bluenzo	remoteCTRL	you put in a HDD number in the setup command right? well how do u know what to type...is what im asking
2009-03-28T03:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	bluenzo	there s this thing called supergrub  disk: http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
2009-03-28T03:44:00.000Z	bluenzo	remoteCTRL	just do you know, i have 4 HDDS, Vista, Ubuntu, data (no os), and a blank 40GB
2009-03-28T03:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	bluenzo	you  b oot into that and it gives you several options, does it all by itself and is wuite self explanatory
2009-03-28T03:45:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	bluenzo	ya that doesn't matter supergrub disk is able to assmble all that it finds bootable into a proper boot menu
2009-03-28T03:45:00.000Z	bluenzo	remoteCTRL	ok, can i run that on windows? or do i have to go to cd-live, im on vista right now
2009-03-28T03:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	bluenzo	you need to burn that .iso onto a cd and boot that cd
2009-03-28T03:46:00.000Z	bluenzo	remoteCTRL	so if i boot that CD, i can fix the boot stuff? for my two OS's ?
2009-03-28T03:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	bluenzo	that would be the sole purpose of that thingie;)
