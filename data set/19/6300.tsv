2010-07-02T09:50:00.000Z	Shpook		Ok, I'm back. I've installed Ubuntu from the alternate install CD....still get a blank screen after the splash screen. No response to ctrl-alt-F1. Anyone?
2010-07-02T09:50:00.000Z	Shpook		#css
2010-07-02T09:50:00.000Z	Shpook		i believe
2010-07-02T09:51:00.000Z	Shpook		Ok, well, anyone know how I can boot into a command line
2010-07-02T09:51:00.000Z	Shpook		?
2010-07-02T09:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	did you try booting 'single user mode', or 'recovery'?
2010-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	hard to say when you can't log at any logs or anything. work on being able to boot to a command line
2010-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	*look at any logs, i mean.
2010-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	i'm guessing it might have to do with video mode
2010-07-02T10:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	press 'e' in the grub menu to edit the boot command line
2010-07-02T10:04:00.000Z	Shpook	prince_jammys	sweetpi: I don't actually get a grub menu...it pauses for a moment with a cursor, then goes to usplash, then goes blank. pressing "e" does nothing. :/
2010-07-02T10:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	mm, that sucks. i had this problem with one of my monitors. it still has to do with video mode, i think, but i don't know the solution.
2010-07-02T10:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	ah, you were able to edit the boot line?
2010-07-02T10:15:00.000Z	Shpook	prince_jammys	eventually I'll get it figured out...I have video problems on every gateway I've ever tried installing ubuntu on
2010-07-02T10:15:00.000Z	Shpook	prince_jammys	yeah, through the grub editor
2010-07-02T10:20:00.000Z	Shpook	prince_jammys	sweetpi: I was able to boot into recovery and low graphics mode, so now I'm going to go over the logs
2010-07-02T10:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	excellent
2010-07-02T10:31:00.000Z	Shpook	prince_jammys	sweetpi: Thanks for the help guys. I'll get the rest of it figured out tomorrow, ou got me pretty far though. Again, thanks.
2010-07-02T10:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Shpook	welcome
