2009-06-15T22:18:00.000Z	bigos		is it possible to connect to the wpa encrypted wifi network in linux?
2009-06-15T22:18:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	currently wpa support is very limited.. some cards will some just wont
2009-06-15T22:19:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	wep should be no problem
2009-06-15T22:20:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	what it could be, if it is a problem? it just doesnt connect, says it's "failed". there is no problem, if i remove the encryption. i am sure i am writing the password correct
2009-06-15T22:22:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	are you using the generated key, (your router does this for you) you shouldn't have a problem w/that
2009-06-15T22:23:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	yes, my router generates 4 keys, i copy the first into a textfield in this fancy plasma widget. but it stills asks me about "connection secrets", and even if i retype it (still right) it doenst connect ("connection failed")
2009-06-15T22:24:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	the first question is for the wep key ... the second is your sudo password
2009-06-15T22:26:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	it doesnt ask me about my root password, it the same window again, with "choose wep 64 or 128 bit" etc etc
2009-06-15T22:27:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	and you have set a 64 bit or 128 bit in your router?
2009-06-15T22:27:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	64 bit 10 digits
2009-06-15T22:28:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	and it doesn't work ....  hmmm - what kind of wireless card do you have?
2009-06-15T22:29:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	atheros 5something
2009-06-15T22:29:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	stand by
2009-06-15T22:31:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	do you have linux-restricted-modules installed.. you may also need madwifi for that card's incryption to work
2009-06-15T22:32:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	i've got both... and the card is working no problem with unencrypted network ... but i dont want to host free internet to for anyone ;/
2009-06-15T22:32:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	that is understandable .. lemme go look at something real quick... I may come up with a solution
2009-06-15T22:33:00.000Z	bigos	fccf	would unencrypted network with MAC filter be any close to "safe network"?
2009-06-15T22:35:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	depends on where you live ... MAC filtering would work to keep people from using your network .. but people could still 'sniff' your unencrypted traffic
2009-06-15T22:39:00.000Z	fccf	bigos	you may want to look at this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=798485
