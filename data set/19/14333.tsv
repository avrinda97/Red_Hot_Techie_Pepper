2010-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	sam_2007		im using transmission to download torrents.  i open the torrents add them to transmission and three hours later there still isnt anything downloading.  is this a bug or something?
2010-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 try some other torrent client.
2010-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 or some very poor torrents.
2010-05-02T14:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 i perfer qbtorrent. or was it qtorrent
2010-05-02T14:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 or try 'wine utorrent.exe' :)
2010-05-02T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 time to fire up the package mnager and explore whats avail then.
2010-05-02T14:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 i find it faster here.
2010-05-02T14:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 or it may take off and  be 1000000+k/s in another 3 min.. hard to tell
2010-05-02T14:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 try utorrent and wine. that way you know youa re using the same app in other oss
2010-05-02T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 if you want to 'test' speeds.. use  similer tools..
2010-05-02T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 as far as speed goes. ive heard 'rtorrent' is faster.. but such testing is very hard to prove/benchmark
2010-05-02T14:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 also configure your diffrent torrent clients so they use the same dirs. that way you can change from one to the other and still have them working on the same 'files'  to test out speeds
2010-06-06T22:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 winff,ffmpeg, mencoder, can do it. and other front ends to those tools
2010-06-06T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 winff for one
2010-06-06T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 i just made a nautilus script -> i right click on a flv and select convert to avi :)
2010-06-06T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 because its a script I made....
2010-06-06T22:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 use ffmpeg
2010-06-06T22:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 example command line (from my script) --> ffmpeg -i "/media/SHOWBOOK/Animation_Shorts/Wouldn_t_It_Be_Great_if_Everybody_Had_a_Gun_.flv" -f avi -r 29.97 -vcodec libxvid -vtag XVID -s 640x360 -aspect 16:9 -maxrate 1800k -b 1500k -qmin 3 -qmax 5 -bufsize 4096 -mbd 2 -bf 2 -flags +4mv -trellis -aic -cmp 2 -subcmp 2 -g 300 -acodec libmp3lame -ar 48000 -ab 128k -ac 2
2010-06-06T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_2007	 rather straight forward.. replace the file names.. and away it goes
