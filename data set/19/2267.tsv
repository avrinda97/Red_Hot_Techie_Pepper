2010-11-10T23:47:00.000Z	c4pt		hello i was wondering if someone could give me a suggestion i am have two video cards in my system and i am trying to run nvidia-settings from the nvidia binary i can load the nvidia module but when i try to use nvidia-settings as root i get this error http://www.pastie.org/1287746
2010-11-10T23:48:00.000Z	blue_anna	c4pt	try sudo nvidia-settings
2010-11-10T23:49:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	i did
2010-11-10T23:49:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	im running it directly as root
2010-11-10T23:49:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	sorry yes i am root
2010-11-10T23:52:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	or a suggestion to run twinview with dual monitors in xorg.conf with 3840 X 1080 combined resoloution
2010-11-10T23:53:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	cant seem to figure it out i usually use nvidia-settings and its just done
2010-11-10T23:53:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	guess its the laziness of a gui
2010-11-10T23:53:00.000Z	blue_anna	c4pt	you have two cards or jsut two monitors to one card?
2010-11-10T23:54:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	well i have two cards and two monitors but at the moment i just want to use one card with both monitors
2010-11-10T23:54:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	i usually just enable twinview and combine 1920x1080 + 1920x1080 (for 3840x1080)
2010-11-10T23:56:00.000Z	blue_anna	c4pt	I was thinking it might be trying to talk to the wrong card .. but I'm not sure how to get around that .. you can find the proper pci address with lspci
2010-11-10T23:56:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	yeah ive tried that
2010-11-10T23:56:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	one is 8:0:0 the other is 7:0:0
2010-11-10T23:56:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	if i totally remove the one i am not using and reload X i still cant run nvidia-settings
2010-11-10T23:57:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	and all instances that point to the other card also (card0, card1 etc)
2010-11-10T23:57:00.000Z	blue_anna	c4pt	oo, that sounds bad
2010-11-10T23:58:00.000Z	blue_anna	c4pt	do the other commands work? nvidia-settings -q screens for isntance?
2010-11-11T00:08:00.000Z	c4pt	blue_anna	i removed the nvidia binary and it still didnt work so finally hiding it from the system (the other card ) completely i could once again run nvidia-settings (since the cards are different)
