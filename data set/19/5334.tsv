2008-07-25T05:40:00.000Z	kdb424		Hey, I'm having wireless problems with my macboo pro. ANyone have a mcbook pro?
2008-07-25T05:40:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro
2008-07-25T05:42:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	I did that. Still having issues after a couple restarts
2008-07-25T05:43:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	I'm afraid your best friend is google, I don't have a mac, feel free to keep asking, or search the channel list, may be a macubuntu channel
2008-07-25T05:44:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	Thanks so much. Google hates me after about 200 pages of searching on one topic. lol
2008-07-25T05:44:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	lol, you'll make up, if not, try the haxor version :p or perhaps the brazil version, apparently if you search 100 pages, google send you chocolate :p
2008-07-25T05:45:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	It keeps bringing me the same pages after a while
2008-07-25T05:45:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	or at least the same info
2008-07-25T05:46:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	well, if you keep waiting, eventually at some point, a chocolate bar will come your way, I like to think of that as 'google's pushing influence' of real life :p
2008-07-25T05:46:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	so what's the problem?
2008-07-25T05:47:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	ok, so you're timing out, overheating perhaps?
2008-07-25T05:47:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	Heat is fine. I keep an eye on it, and not timing out, cause it works great if I plug ethernet in and redo it a second later
2008-07-25T05:47:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	it happens on routers too, sometimes you get them so you have to reset after so much downloading, the bthomehub is the worse for that, reseting weekly...
2008-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	and the speed is fine till it dead stops
2008-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	are you using ndiswrapper?
2008-07-25T05:49:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	if it is atheros (I think madwifi is) then you are better off using the ubuntu-extras, they have it inbuild
2008-07-25T05:50:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	I mean the restricted ones sorry
2008-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	kdb424	azexian	I PM'd you
2008-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	azexian	kdb424	but you don't have to use cvs, that could be the problem, it might just be unstable
