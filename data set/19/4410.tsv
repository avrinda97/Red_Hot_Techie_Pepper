2011-05-04T18:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_		on ubuntu because have dropped F1-F6 ahell?
2011-05-04T18:26:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	alt-F1 to alt-F6
2011-05-04T18:26:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	wait maybe it was ctrl-alt
2011-05-04T18:27:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	from X, ctrl-alt. from tty, just alt
2011-05-04T18:29:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	i know that because isnt there the shell? i see nothing..
2011-05-04T18:30:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	no login at all? just blank? but you have X (GNOME/KDE/etc)?
2011-05-04T18:32:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	yes are all blank im using gnome, for add  how i do it?
2011-05-04T18:33:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	tty should've been installed by default
2011-05-04T18:34:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	see if you have tty1.conf in /etc/init/
2011-05-04T18:35:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	if i install tty then work like other distro?
2011-05-04T18:37:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	yes ive this file there...
2011-05-04T18:38:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	the conf file is installed by upstart (I found out by doing 'dpkg -S /etc/init/tty1.conf'), and I think it is also installed in your distro
2011-05-04T18:39:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	the command 'ps' will list running processes. If you do 'ps -a | grep getty', do you get a list, or nothing?
2011-05-04T18:50:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	thanks again but for add only 2 tty?i know the comand please
2011-05-04T18:52:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	sorry I'm not sure what's wrong there. so you ctrl-alt-f1 and nothing comes out? Does it stay in GNOME/KDE/XFCE/Unity/whatever  or does it become black screen?
2011-05-04T18:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	in ctrl-alt-f1 is a X mode,where i am....
2011-05-04T19:00:00.000Z	ubuntu_	syockit	i know that exist a comand just for add other virtual shell but i dunno :(
2011-05-04T19:01:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	wow I haven't seen one that use f1 for X before. Wait, what about arch... err anyways so how about f2 and f3 or others? btw just for the record my X is on 8, and upstart output on 7
2011-05-04T19:03:00.000Z	syockit	ubuntu_	try "getty 8 38400 tty2"?
