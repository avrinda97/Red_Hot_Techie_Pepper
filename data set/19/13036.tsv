2009-12-06T12:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	darkely1024	for floods and a few other things, the bot has some op/admin powers. There's human ops around too.
2009-12-06T12:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	darkely1024	most of the bots won't speak unless spoken to; the floodbots have some exceptions.

2009-12-06T12:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	darkely1024	if you want to start a new channel, just join a channel that doesn't already exist
2009-12-06T12:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	darkely1024	please do NOT randomly DCC people
2009-12-06T12:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	darkely1024	if you want to PM someone, just type "/msg <nick you want to contact> <message to send>" with the quotes or the <> brackets.
2009-12-06T12:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	darkely1024	in the same window you type stuff for this channel in, type "/msg <nick> <msg to send>" and leave off the quotes and the <angle brackets>. Clear?
