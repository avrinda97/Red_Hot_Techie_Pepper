2007-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		on that note. anyone here with an ATI card that has any luck with TV (S-video) output?
2007-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		;p
2007-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		hehe np
2007-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		i tried to update the ATI drivers to 8.40 and it screwed up my whole system (XGL)
2007-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		so im back to the repositories
2007-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		but that doesnt have the Catalyst Control Center
2007-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		how do open ati drivers compare with fglrx
2007-09-02T12:45:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		hmmm open drivers have auto-detect i guess
2007-09-02T12:45:00.000Z	milanl	Streetsurfer	the open ati drivers are not really good performance in 3D
2007-09-02T12:46:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		well, i cant even run games with compiz fusion running with fglrx anyway no direct rendering at all
2007-09-02T12:46:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		I wanna get an nvidia too but my AGP x1600 pro is still decent so it doesnt seem worthwhile
2007-09-02T12:46:00.000Z	Streetsurfer	manduski	what u trying to do
2007-09-02T12:47:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		well, do either of the computers have a ftpd installed?
2007-09-02T12:47:00.000Z	milanl	Streetsurfer	it must be possible to get direct rendering with fglrx and x1600
2007-09-02T12:47:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		not via XGL :(
2007-09-02T12:47:00.000Z	Streetsurfer		i get direct rendering with regular xsession though
2007-09-02T12:47:00.000Z	milanl	Streetsurfer	no that not
2007-09-02T12:48:00.000Z	milanl	Streetsurfer	nvidia support is mucccchhhh better
