2007-09-26T10:06:00.000Z	anandanbu		Suggest a good pdf reader for ubuntu 7.04
2007-09-26T10:06:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	evince
2007-09-26T10:07:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	is it different from the document viewer
2007-09-26T10:07:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	no
2007-09-26T10:07:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	evince sucks for some pdf files
2007-09-26T10:08:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	i am not able to read the fonts for those files
2007-09-26T10:08:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	is the fonts included in the pdf, or is the fonts used by the pdf?
2007-09-26T10:09:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	whats the difference between them
2007-09-26T10:10:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	in the first case, the fonts are distributed with the pdf. in the latter case, it uses the fonts in the operating system
2007-09-26T10:10:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	how to find that
2007-09-26T10:11:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	inside evince, look at the file menu > preferences. it has a tab with font info
2007-09-26T10:12:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	in that tab it displays some fonts(around 6)
2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	it should say if the fonts are built-in or not
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	in that all are said as not embedded
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	then you need to download the fonts for ubuntu
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	u mean those fonts that are listed in the tab
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	yes
2007-09-26T10:17:00.000Z	anandanbu	magnetron	thanks for the info
2007-09-26T10:17:00.000Z	magnetron	anandanbu	you're welcome
