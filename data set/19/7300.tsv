2009-02-13T09:57:00.000Z	_2		wrong and bad ???
2009-02-13T09:57:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	have you run xfix>
2009-02-13T09:58:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	nope.  no such command.
2009-02-13T09:58:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	boot to recovery mode
2009-02-13T09:59:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	?
2009-02-13T09:59:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	errr ummm why ?
2009-02-13T09:59:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	boot the machine. look for the "Press <ESC> to enter the GRUB menu" prompt. do so. choose recovery mode.
2009-02-13T10:00:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	there isn't a recovery mode.   why do you want me to do that ?
2009-02-13T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	because that's where the xfix command lives, which will re-write a sane X config for you.
2009-02-13T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	if you have no recovery mode, your installation is very, very broken.
2009-02-13T10:01:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	no.   i use lilo.  installation is not broken
2009-02-13T10:01:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	why lilo?
2009-02-13T10:01:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	no partitions.
2009-02-13T10:02:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	well one would think so.  but not when they don't even try to help.
2009-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	but that's not a good reason to impose on another community of users.
2009-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	i'm not imposing.   you know i'm a regular here.
2009-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	if that's so, why not just switch to Ubuntu?
2009-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	mneptok	_2	end of problem
2009-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	_2	mneptok	i'm using ubuntu
