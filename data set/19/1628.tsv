2010-11-25T01:17:00.000Z	blup		i'm having trouble with the latest ubuntu version... i installed it on my new dell xps, and if i unplug the power chord, 1-5m later it freezes and i have to do a hard reboot. am i missing a driver, or what else could be causing this?
2010-11-25T01:19:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	it might be related to your graphics driver according to something I've read on ubuntu forums
2010-11-25T01:19:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	I read it here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1463355
2010-11-25T01:19:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	do you remember the thread?
2010-11-25T01:19:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	thanks
2010-11-25T01:20:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	they basically tell you to download the latest version of your graphics driver
2010-11-25T01:21:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	i believe i already did that :(
2010-11-25T01:21:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	but yea, i suspect it's still a graphics card problem.. i'll keep searching in that direction
2010-11-25T01:21:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	what is your graphics card, and what driver do you have for it?
2010-11-25T01:24:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4670, and i installed the driver from the driver manager (ATI/AMD propietary FGLRX graphics driver)
2010-11-25T01:25:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	ok now I have more info to help you :), let's see what the forums have to say
2010-11-25T01:27:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	thanks a lot
2010-11-25T01:30:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	I still didn't find the right post for you... still looking
2010-11-25T01:32:00.000Z	blup	littlejoey	thanks, if not i'll keep searching in that direction... do you know where i could find linux graphics card drivers?

2010-11-25T01:33:00.000Z	littlejoey	blup	sure on the ATI website for instance, try to see if there is a more recent version
