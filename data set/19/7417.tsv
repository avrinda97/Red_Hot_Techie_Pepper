2007-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	Pricey	super61	you're talking about RAM right? (fragalot)
2007-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	super61	Pricey	yes my laptop is old so i cant get new ram or i would have already
2007-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	Pricey	super61	then use the alternate install cd, I would recommend using a lighter desktop than gnome though
2007-08-26T07:32:00.000Z	super61	Pricey	i am but i cant burn i dont have a big pc only  slim drive
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	Pricey	super61	an .iso file?

2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	Pricey	super61	well that, or burning a video.. or other files?
2007-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	Pricey	super61	because if its a ready iso, then right click it, then select "burn to disc"
2007-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	super61	Pricey	ok
