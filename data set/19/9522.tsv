2007-05-08T11:02:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		omg I just put a dvd in and it showed up on my desktop. And when I right click it there is an option that says copy disk, Is it really that crazy simple ?
2007-05-08T11:03:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	quite possibly
2007-05-08T11:03:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	if not, install k3b it's great for all your CD/DVD needs
2007-05-08T11:03:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		do you have to have kde for that megaqwerty?
2007-05-08T11:04:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	nope, you can run it in gnome
2007-05-08T11:04:00.000Z	QuixoticJ	Megaqwerty	im really looking for the best solutions for simple dvd coping and dvd data disc creation. Since I have to teach it to my family members also. They are use ot my 2 click windows solution of dvd coping.
2007-05-08T11:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	Well, k3b has a great gui, just download it, and try it out. If you don't like it, you can remove it.
2007-05-08T11:06:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	but it's very easy to use
2007-05-08T11:06:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		megaqwerty I will check it out. But first im going to see what this right click copy disc does. If it actually works I will be totally amazed
2007-05-08T11:07:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	it also makes .iso files of dvds, which it can then subsequently burn to a blank dvd, or dvd+rw
2007-05-08T11:07:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	cool, good luck!
2007-05-08T11:07:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		megaqwerty have you ever used the clonedvd or clonecd programs they are windows programs
2007-05-08T11:07:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	no, I haven't but I assume that they make .iso files, correct?
2007-05-08T11:08:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		megaqwerty no it just rips the dvd no matter what kind and then tells you to put a blank dvd in and writes a copy of it. then removes the files that it created.
2007-05-08T11:09:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		megaqwerty makes coping movies very easy I'm wondering if there is similiar functilaity or just the ability to copy movies on here. megaqwerty
2007-05-08T11:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	so it does exactly what I just said. Just behind the scenes. k3b also has that ability :-P
2007-05-08T11:11:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		megaqwerty sounds good thanks Ill check it out. IThe dvd showed up on my desktop upon insert I right clicked its icon and it had a copy disc option. Is it possible to see which program is handling this copy? Since it was just built right into the system.
2007-05-08T11:12:00.000Z	Megaqwerty		hm...unknown to me. It could be nautilus (the file manager) which has it's own cd/dvd burning capability akin to the one in windows. (Drag and drop files into the cd making window, select burn)
2007-05-08T11:13:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	QuixoticJ	 the only problem I've ever had with k3b is when it wasn't able to access my cd/dvd drive, which is solved by running it as root (i.e. Alt+F2 then typing into the box "gksu k3b" without the quotes) you can also just change the launcher to do this automagically, by right clicking on the launcher, choosing properties, and changing the command to "gksu k3b" (without the quotes)
