2009-12-14T00:12:00.000Z	itilious		is it possible to have ubuntu automatically disable compiz after so long of idleness?
2009-12-14T00:13:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	You could do that with a script I presume
2011-04-14T19:37:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	modesetting is enabled by default
2011-04-14T19:38:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	i have a laptop that requires "i915.modeset=1" to boot, but when i try to boot with flash drive it doesnt set the mode correctly
2011-04-14T19:40:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	what did you mean by its set by default?
2011-04-14T19:40:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	I mean the default is already i915.modeset=1
2011-04-14T19:41:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	then why is that not in /etc/default/grub after "quiet splash" ?
2011-04-14T19:41:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	Because it is the default :)
2011-04-14T19:41:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	i'm the n00b here but youre wrong, its not there by default
2011-04-14T19:42:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	That is strange if you have to manually enable it on recent versions of ubuntu
2011-04-14T19:42:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	i've ALWAYS had to manually add it to get this to boot
2011-04-14T19:42:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	i'm using ubuntu 10.04
2011-04-14T19:42:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	I have no idea why you would have to enable modesetting manually to make it work then
2011-04-14T19:43:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	its an older laptop
2011-04-14T19:43:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	Are you sure its an i9xx intel chip?
2011-04-14T19:43:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	yes
2011-04-14T19:44:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	strange. Maybe something disables KMS on some chips
2011-04-14T19:45:00.000Z	soreau	itilious	Did you check the md5sum for the image you put on the flash drive?
2011-04-14T19:45:00.000Z	itilious	soreau	yes and yes it matched
