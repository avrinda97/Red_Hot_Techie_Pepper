2009-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Royall		Is it possible to force a device/directory to stop being busy?
2009-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Royall		or force the deletion of a directory that is busy
2009-02-28T06:56:00.000Z	Royall		lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuseblk file system /media/[re]drive
2009-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	see where its busy and kill the processes that are accessing it
2009-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	lsof | grep /mount/point
2009-02-28T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	ps -ef | grep <directory>
2009-02-28T07:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	sudo umount /[re]drive
2009-02-28T07:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	you need to umount the mount oint first]
2009-02-28T07:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	whatever, sudo umount it
2009-02-28T07:08:00.000Z	Royall	ActionParsnip	Ok I got it mounted as [re]drive
2010-10-13T10:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	dont run nautilus with sudo
2010-10-13T10:43:00.000Z	Royall	ActionParsnip	I don't do that normally
2010-10-13T10:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	you should use gksudo, sudo is NOT for gui apps
2010-10-13T10:44:00.000Z	Royall	ActionParsnip	I just used it to discover I can access my external HDD with root
2010-10-13T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	then you may need to add it to /etc/fstab
2010-10-13T10:44:00.000Z	Royall	ActionParsnip	I'm not sure what to add in the way of options
2010-10-13T10:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	i don't think you should have the brackets in the line, i suggest you change the mount point
2010-10-13T10:46:00.000Z	Royall	ActionParsnip	the brackets have worked for a while.. but how would I change the mount point
2010-10-13T10:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Royall	make a new empty folder with a simple name and then edit fstab to mirror the new folder
