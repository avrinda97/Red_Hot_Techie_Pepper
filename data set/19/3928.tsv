2010-02-14T02:16:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Did you install a new kernel?  if so, try one of the older ones at the GRUB menu - if you get no grub menu, try holding shift after the bios screen.
2010-02-14T02:20:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	You need to hold it after the POST, when grub would load.  If you're not on Karmic, try pressing esc when it says "GRUB loading..." instead.
2010-02-14T02:22:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Try using the third option, if it's an older kernel.
2010-02-14T02:23:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Normal, but you should have more than one of each.  Ifnot, I'm not sure.
2010-02-14T02:24:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Use the second-latest one that's not a "recovery mode"
2010-02-14T02:26:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Hmm, interesting - I don't know much about graphics issues, you may be better off asking for general help again.
2010-02-14T02:28:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Hmm, something like "Having trouble booting <release>, getting low-graphics mode when using older kernel" where <release> is which version of Ubuntu you're using.  HTH and good luck!
2010-02-14T02:30:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	If you want to revert to GDM, use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm"
2010-02-14T02:35:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	"sudo apt-get -f install" and/or "sudo dpkg --configure -a" should fix any broken packages, between tham.
2010-02-14T02:36:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	The "sudo" bit makes it run as root; if you're already root you can drop "sudo" from the start.
2010-02-14T02:45:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Hmm, interesting... try "aptitude reinstall gdm" as root, then.
2010-02-14T02:47:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	In that case, "aptitude install gdm" and see what it complains about.  It'll be a dependency problem.
2010-02-14T02:49:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	You'll need an internet connection.
2010-02-14T02:50:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	How do you normally connect?
2010-02-14T02:51:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	You'll need a wired connection.
2010-02-14T02:52:00.000Z	Darael	nomadmatus	Probably!
