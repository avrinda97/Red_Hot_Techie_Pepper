2006-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	piwi	SanketMedhi	sounds really exciting, thanks for the links! Im not sure to understand what free world dialup is... Basically its a free voip gateway??
2006-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	SanketMedhi		umm, my Ctrl+Alt+F1/2/3.... keys stopped working few days back. All other shortcuts with Ctrl+Alt are working fine. Any suggestions?
2006-07-18T11:48:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	piwi	that's something trivial, look some info up voip-info
2006-07-18T11:48:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	piwi	btw, the other link was asteriskguru.com not .org
2006-07-18T11:48:00.000Z	piwi	SanketMedhi	cheers
