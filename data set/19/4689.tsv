2011-10-05T03:37:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	I havent done it with 11, but in 10
2011-10-05T03:38:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	search for macbuntu
2011-10-05T03:39:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	no macbuntu
2011-10-05T03:40:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	but there is an entire ubuntu site named something like that and it links to all of the drivers you need and tells you what works and what doesnt
2011-10-05T03:41:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	maybe one of those
2011-10-05T03:41:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	thanks i saw it but doesn't talk about 11.04
2011-10-05T03:43:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	 i searching about have already had the same problem
2011-10-05T03:43:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	i was talking to someone else
2011-10-05T03:43:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	the built in touchpad about macbook pro doesn't work great for ubuntu :(
2011-10-05T03:43:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	ok sorry
2011-10-05T03:43:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	nope, I'm sorry
2011-10-05T03:46:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	I know there isnt a lot of info on your problem, I went through the same thing on my macbook. But the good news is that, at least with 10.04, I was able to get everything working on my macbook pro with a little effort, and it made a great machine
2011-10-05T03:47:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	 i have this model of macbook pro but here is talking about and old release

2011-10-05T03:48:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	rickyrich	the mactel pages are what i was trying to think of earlier, identify your machine if you havent already and read through those
2011-10-05T03:49:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	i've already identifi it is macbook pro 5,1 late 2008
2011-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	rickyrich	noisewaterphd	here you have http://pastebin.com/K8Yf0ZvT
