2007-10-12T14:39:00.000Z	khairall		I have a question
2007-10-12T14:39:00.000Z	khairall		How to change my hostname
2007-10-12T14:39:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	'echo newhostname | sudo tee /etc/hostname' -- then update /etc/hosts
2007-10-12T14:41:00.000Z	khairall	soundray	after rebooting, would the effects
2007-10-12T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	yes. In fact, you should reboot to make sure every bit of your system is up to date on the name change.
2007-10-12T14:42:00.000Z	khairall	soundray	I tried doing that but did not work.
2007-10-12T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	you tried this before I suggested it?
2007-10-12T14:45:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	sorry, got sidetracked. What do you get from 'cat /etc/hostname'
2007-10-12T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	is that the old or the new hostname?
2007-10-12T14:47:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	did you enter that in /etc/hosts as well? (Second line)
2007-10-12T14:48:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	elaborate on "does not work" please
2007-10-12T14:49:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	is that on the local network or the internet?
2007-10-12T14:50:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	on the internet, you would have to update your DNS entry
2007-10-12T14:51:00.000Z	khairall	soundray	under general I put greif for host name
2007-10-12T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	you went under network?
2007-10-12T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	sorry, I don't understand that
2007-10-12T14:53:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	that depends on your setup
2007-10-12T14:54:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	probably
2007-10-12T14:55:00.000Z	soundray	khairall	sure, you can make a fixed entry in the /etc/hosts of the other machine
