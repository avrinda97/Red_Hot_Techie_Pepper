2005-05-06T15:58:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	don't you have to remake the ttf database or something?
2005-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	the database will see the new file and update automatically
2005-05-07T16:00:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	ok, i got some instructions off some linux page about database updateing and some claptrap
2005-05-07T16:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	talks about mkttfdir & the like?
2005-05-07T16:02:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	something like that
2005-05-07T16:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	that's the old style, gnome uses fontconfig. I'm not sure if kde does
2005-05-07T16:03:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	so the new hotness scans dir(s) on startup for new shtuff?
2005-05-07T16:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	yes, and when I drop a ttf into ~/.fonts, gnome sees it immediately.
2005-05-07T16:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	you could try the ~/.fonts directory and see if it works
2005-05-07T16:06:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	i d/l a 7000+ font rar t'other day
2005-05-07T16:07:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	any ideas for some nice free ones?
2005-05-07T16:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	I use the ttf fonts provided by ubuntu, plus the better ones I bought with PrintShop ages ago :)
2005-05-07T10:10:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	serious qyuestion?
2005-05-07T10:10:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	tofu?
2005-05-10T10:46:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	checkinstall is da bomb!
2005-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	checkinstall is great, keeps your system tidy (deb install as opposed to "make install"
2005-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	I can't tab complete your name:) about the only thing I compile these days are gnome, and I use jhbuild for the cvs
2005-05-10T13:23:00.000Z	Nalioth	nickrud	are you inciting conversation again?
2005-05-10T13:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Nalioth	possibly :)
