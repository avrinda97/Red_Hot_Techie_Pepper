2007-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	thesilentw	billy	this works even without linux installed on normal partition right?
2007-03-29T05:18:00.000Z	billy	thesilentw	 to the best of my knowledge, though I've never used it sans Linux.
2007-03-29T05:19:00.000Z	thesilentw	billy	is there a chance i get things worse with that ?
2007-03-29T05:20:00.000Z	billy	thesilentw	 well, there's always that chance I guess.
2007-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	thesilentw	billy	ok, does it require you to input locations by hand?
2007-03-29T05:22:00.000Z	billy	thesilentw	 no.  it'll read your hdd and stuff.
2007-03-29T05:24:00.000Z	thesilentw	billy	how do i burn it onto dvd to make it bootable?
2007-03-29T05:25:00.000Z	thesilentw	billy	shouldnt it be like...an ISO file
2007-03-29T05:26:00.000Z	thesilentw	billy	shouldnt it be like...an ISO file
