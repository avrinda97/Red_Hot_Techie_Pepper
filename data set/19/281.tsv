2012-10-08T20:10:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	http://pastebin.com/Cgv1igHc   here you go bro
2012-10-08T20:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	That's his fdisk it is a gpt
2012-10-08T20:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	You would have to chroot into the install to install there
2012-10-08T20:27:00.000Z	BluesKaj	wilee-nilee	are you sure , /dev/sda4 is his ubuntu install , why bothger with chrooting ?
2012-10-08T20:27:00.000Z	BluesKaj	wilee-nilee	he's using the live cd with the terminal
2012-10-08T20:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	 From a live cd you would have to chroot. As it is he can boot to Ubuntu I believe you can you purge and install all from there.
2012-10-08T20:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	It is a GPT it is not  msdos partitioning set up, Personally I think a person who know GPT booting wu=ith grub will know what to do.
2012-10-08T20:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	wilee-nilee	I never do chroots to install grub to a different partition
2012-10-08T20:29:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	Cool but I doubt that will fix it but one never knows. I never of had to reload a grub this way.
2012-10-08T20:37:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	I believe GPT can work with grub fine it just needs someone who knows this stuff.
2012-10-08T21:01:00.000Z	BluesKaj	wilee-nilee	I wonder if this would have worked for Arcanewater , http://www.wensley.org.uk/gpt
2012-10-08T21:04:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	Not sure to be honest there are official ubuntu wiki's on this stuff.  I spent a long time on the UF helping with grub issues and dualbooting stuff, there were a couple of helpers there who knew this part of it and were on daily, so I let them mess with the unusual partitioning stuff, lol.
2012-10-08T21:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	here is one of the best helpers there. http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11509699&postcount=2
2012-10-08T21:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	wilee-nilee	it looks like grub devs better get a handle this if we're going to see more and more pcs with GPT tables
2012-10-08T21:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	BluesKaj	I think they do it is just not a click and play situation.
