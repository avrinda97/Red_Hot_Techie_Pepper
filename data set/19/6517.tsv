2011-06-11T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	there is no best
2011-06-11T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	fileroller is default in gnome, its just a gui to the cli compression tools
2011-06-11T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	there isn't a best compression tool in any OS. Its as intelligent as asking what the best colour of the rainbow is
2012-01-05T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	the man pages help a lot
2012-01-05T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	or if you post your command here we may be able to help

2012-11-28T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	its no more techy than other mobile OSes. You install apps and use them.
2012-11-28T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	you can do that on iPhone too.....
2012-11-28T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	yes but it does what you said, you can install apps.
2012-11-28T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	exactly, so how is that being 'tech savvy'?
2012-11-28T19:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	i'm not making an arguement, i'm not seeing how installing apps is 'tech savvy'
2012-11-28T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	especially when 'yupie dicks' can do the same thing on iphone
2012-11-28T19:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	stll doesn't answer me, but its offtopic here
2012-11-28T19:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	no, i don't. Your statement just makes no sense
2012-11-28T19:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Erealz	i use android, but you knew that
