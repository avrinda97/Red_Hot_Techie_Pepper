2006-09-28T09:37:00.000Z	thedash		I did

2006-09-28T09:37:00.000Z	thedash		the time it gives me is a little ove 4 hours in the future

2006-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	thedash		working on ntp atm
2006-09-28T09:40:00.000Z	thedash		well, my computer has the correct time
2006-09-28T08:31:00.000Z	thedash		I am having some problems with my C compiler, and I don't know much about it
2006-09-28T08:32:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	what problems
2006-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	"sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2006-09-28T08:40:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	make
2006-09-28T08:40:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	usually preceeded by ./configure
2006-09-29T07:22:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	fsck
2006-09-29T07:23:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	well, chkdsk check a partition AFAIK... anyway, if you want to check an *entire* disk, then i assume it means you want to check for *physical* defects, like bad blocks or worse.  i don't know of any bad-sector-checking packages on Linux, but you might want to try smartmontools (run "smartctl -A /dev/hdwhatever") to see what your HD's health is like
2006-09-29T07:24:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	that's -- of course -- a S.M.A.R.T. data monitoring program
2006-09-29T10:27:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	it depends, "drivers" can be many things in ubuntu. what do you want to know?
2006-09-29T10:28:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	uhm, i don't see any package mentioning them... they're probably a standard part of the kernel, i'd assume
2006-09-29T10:31:00.000Z	LjL	thedash	well, *if* they're part of the kernel, then i'm afraid you'd just have to wait for a newer kernel. can't seem to find too much on google though
