2011-08-08T01:54:00.000Z	newbuntguy		where do i need to go to find help with virtualbox,..
2011-08-08T01:55:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	do you have a specific question (I might be able to answer :) ) ?
2011-08-08T01:58:00.000Z	newbuntguy	coraxx	I can get it to work but i have to run /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup from terminal
2011-08-08T01:58:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	ok ...that usually means that there has been a kernel update....and you need to run the 'vboxdrv'
2011-08-08T01:58:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	(sorry you were a faster typer than me :) )
2011-08-08T01:59:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	is there a problem in running it from the terminal ?
2011-08-08T01:59:00.000Z	newbuntguy	coraxx	im way faster than yo
2011-08-08T02:00:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	did you read my previous question ?
2011-08-08T02:02:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	strange ...which kernel are you currently running ?
2011-08-08T02:04:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	(maverick meerkat I presume) ...alright ...how many times have you tried running the 'vboxdrv setup' and the rebooted subsequently after ?
2011-08-08T02:05:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	(remember to write who you are talking to :-) )
2011-08-08T02:07:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	have you installed VirtualBox from a single downloaded .deb-file (from VirtualBox.org) or have you installed it from the repositories (either the virtualbox.org-reps or Ubuntu's own for the OSE-version) ?
2011-08-08T02:08:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	(remember to write who you are talking to :-) )
2011-08-08T02:08:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	ok...but .deb or repos. ?
2011-08-08T02:12:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	There are two option when you install from virtualbox.org ...you can either visit the download-section and download a certain version that matches your ubuntu ...OR ....you can add the virtualbox.org's repositories to your Ubuntu and thereby installing and maintaining it through there ...so for me to give you a solution, I will need to know which you have chosen ?
2011-08-08T02:14:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	I felt you had an AHA-Moment :-)  (I'm spelled with 2 X's)
2011-08-08T02:14:00.000Z	coraxx	newbuntguy	exactly :) (I'm still spelled with 2 X's)
