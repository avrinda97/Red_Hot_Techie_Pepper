2011-09-24T16:29:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	you can save pictures using mplayer: http://www.infohit.net/blog/post/taking-snapshots-from-a-webcam-under-linux.html
2011-09-24T16:30:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	I'd suggest you write a small script
2011-09-24T16:30:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	This was no problem in windows, :-(
2011-09-24T16:31:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	make mplayer open a video stream from the camera in a window. when the window is closed, next command will be run. that command should save the image to a filesystem.
2011-09-24T16:32:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	ICK! really? close the window to take the picture, not real intuitive is it?
2011-09-24T16:32:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	so: display video from device; take picture
2011-09-24T16:33:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	you could write a small application to do it if you don't think it's too much of a waste of time
2011-09-24T16:39:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	to know when the picture was taken: http://www.econowics.com/linux/258/show-image-properties-meta-data-from-cli-linux/
2011-09-24T16:40:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	use grep etc on that output. look for line lines   Exif:DateTime*
2011-09-24T16:41:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	ok but what the heck should I use for yourpicture.jpg???
2011-09-24T16:41:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	the picture that contains the information that you want
2011-09-24T16:41:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	If i remember correctly cheese saves anywhere on the filesystem
2011-09-24T16:42:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	so I am a bit confused on your post???
2011-09-24T16:43:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	Cheese stores your pictures in a folder called Webcam inside the XDG-Directory set for Pictures (in most distributions its ~/Pictures/Webcam)
2011-09-24T16:44:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	really?? let me check that? I did not see that in the man pages, or the info pages
2011-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	cool! thanks man, you are a lifesaver!
2011-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	it's in their faq: http://library.gnome.org/users/cheese/stable/faq.html.en
2011-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	joel135	todd_	np
2011-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	todd_	joel135	the man page should link there, IMHO
