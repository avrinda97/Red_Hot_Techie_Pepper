2012-01-07T01:41:00.000Z	Jsn0327		it doesn't
2012-01-07T01:41:00.000Z	Jsn0327		I don't understand why it can't read the file!?
2012-01-07T01:41:00.000Z	Jsn0327		I can go to the path that the syslog is pointing to and open it up as a regular user just fine
2012-01-07T01:42:00.000Z	Jsn0327		"/etc/init.d/pptpd start" without the quotes
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	Jsn0327		yeah i use sudo
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	Jsn0327		i have done stop, start, restart
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	Jsn0327		all with sudo
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	Jsn0327		it doesn't produce any errors in terminal
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	Jsn0327		but it does log that error to the syslog
2012-01-07T01:45:00.000Z	Jsn0327		pptpd[20217]: MGR: PPP options file /etc/ppp/options.pptpd#015 not readable
2012-01-07T01:45:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	Have you tried "sudo service pptpd stop" and "start" afterwards? doing it manually through /etc/init.d/file is a bit depricated in my oppinion?
2012-01-07T01:49:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	if you are familiar with the cli then pipe - "|" - it through "pastebinit", it's much easier than copy/paste all the time ;)
2012-01-07T01:51:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	"sudo apt-get install pastebinit"
2012-01-07T01:52:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	I would recommend to look at the man pages for pastebin, it has some truely awesome features.
2012-01-07T01:52:00.000Z	Jsn0327	jstoone	 I stopped and started with the service command like u suggested, but i got the same result in the syslog
2012-01-07T02:08:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	Yes, or well, I've heard about openvpn. Here is an official Ubuntu guide - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenVPN
2012-01-07T02:10:00.000Z	Jsn0327	jstoone	thanks!
2012-01-07T02:12:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	You are so welcome! Please just ask away if you have any questions. And let me know if it does any difference using OpenVPN
2012-01-07T02:13:00.000Z	jstoone	Jsn0327	It would probably be best to purge pptp from the system, just for good maners ;) (and to exclude eventual bugs and config errors)
