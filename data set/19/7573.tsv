2008-01-15T22:29:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	need to give us the error
2008-01-15T22:29:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	let me try again to install it
2008-01-15T22:34:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	I have the terminal log
2008-01-15T22:34:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	it is here http://pastebin.com/m3fde6331
2008-01-15T22:35:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	use sudo make instead of just "make"
2008-01-15T22:36:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	for some reason make is trying to create files in /usr/local/lib which requires root access
2008-01-15T22:37:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	I'll try that hold on
2008-01-15T22:39:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	here is the new error log http://pastebin.com/ma7ad1e8
2008-01-15T22:40:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	there is no error, it is successful
2008-01-15T22:40:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	it isn't showing up for some reason in my plugin's list
2008-01-15T22:43:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	maybe it installed to the wrong directory?
2008-01-15T22:43:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	it installs wherever you tell it to install, you told it to install in /usr/local/
2008-01-15T22:43:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	is that where pidgin plugins go?
2008-01-15T22:45:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	I don't know, might want to find that out though
2008-01-15T22:45:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	bruenig	where can I find out?
2008-01-15T22:46:00.000Z	bruenig	CheeseGardener	ask other people, google, etc.
