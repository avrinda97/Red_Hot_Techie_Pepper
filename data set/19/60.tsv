2012-10-24T23:05:00.000Z	lourtyp		because kexec install get stuck wilee-nilee
2012-10-24T23:05:00.000Z	lourtyp		E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock -
2012-10-24T23:07:00.000Z	lourtyp		I searched around a lot. couldn't find one tutorial that actually works. I have the mint iso written on SD. just want to boot from it
2012-10-24T23:07:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	you just want to boot an iso from sd? I can help you set that up with syslinux.
2012-10-24T23:08:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	Is it a livecd iso? I can only help with that.
2012-10-24T23:09:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	Well, try this first: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ It has been a while, not sure I remeber exactly how to set it up manually...
2012-10-24T23:10:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	Well, this method is supposed to work for any iso: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/ That entire site is pretty nice for that stuff.
2012-10-24T23:11:00.000Z	lourtyp	MiningMarsh	isn't it an exe file?
2012-10-24T23:12:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	no, that page is linux only. You install grub2 to the flash drive, and grub 2 pretends the iso is a cd
2012-10-24T23:13:00.000Z	lourtyp	MiningMarsh	my apt-get is stuck whilst installing kexec-tools
2012-10-24T23:13:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	Do you already have grub2?
2012-10-24T23:13:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	Grub or grub2? If you ahve grub2, you don't need apt-get for that page. All standard terminal commands.
2012-10-24T23:14:00.000Z	lourtyp	MiningMarsh	I dont have grub2 command. so no I guess I dont have it
2012-10-24T23:15:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	lourtyp	The command is actually grub-install. not quite sure how to test if you have it for grub or grub2 though.
