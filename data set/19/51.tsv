2012-11-17T03:16:00.000Z	Sazzo		Hi.. 12.04 server. I updated my kernel and was faced with a option screen saying the menu.lst can be modified.  I was offered to leave it alone or choose the package maintainer's version.  Is there anything dangerous about the wrong choice?  Other than booting into the same kernel as before?  For reference: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/ubuntu-grub-unchanged-734864/  I didn't reboot yet.. thought I'd ask first.
2012-11-17T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	that is grub legacy, i'd use the maintainers one then install Grub2 for an easy life
2012-11-17T03:21:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	is there any risk on leaving the original grub alone?  I ask this because this server is 20 miles away.. I took over this role. :)
2012-11-17T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	you could keep it but it is recommended to move to the newer grub
2012-11-21T07:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	sure
2012-11-21T07:51:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	any idea how?  I've looked in the kb settings and it doesn't specify....will i need compiz to do this?
2012-11-21T07:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	is this what you ultimately want: http://askubuntu.com/questions/105558/how-do-i-disable-the-super-key
2012-11-21T07:53:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	sort of.  I did find that page but it didn't specify which super key.
2012-11-21T07:53:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	I might just yank the key out :)
2012-11-21T07:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	i guess
2012-11-21T07:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	each key makes an event ID, the keys are unique
2012-11-21T07:55:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	I am aware.. just gotta find where that specific key assignment is being passed from.
2012-11-21T07:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	run:   xev    and press each key
2012-11-21T07:56:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	yes,.. but if I do, then what can I do result?
2012-11-21T07:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	let me see
2012-11-21T07:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	seems you can use xmodmap to map it
2012-11-21T07:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	here is one for caps lock, could be useful
2012-11-21T07:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazzo	http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/4378
2012-11-21T08:00:00.000Z	Sazzo	ActionParsnip	yep there are enough clues there.. thanks.
