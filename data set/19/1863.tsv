2010-11-01T02:39:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		NEED HELP: How can I tell Ubuntu to install to a drive the installer does not see, but Ubuntu livecd sees under gpart?
2010-11-01T02:41:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		Now can anyone help me?
2010-11-01T02:42:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		I read the 4th gen book like 10 years ago, was good then, I can only imagine the volume they have now
2010-11-01T02:43:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		I STRONGLY suggest a book ;)
2010-11-01T02:43:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		makes customizing kernels to your needs easy
2010-11-01T02:44:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		Where can I find installing Ubuntu ADVANCED help?
2010-11-01T02:46:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		just had to "hack" a device driver in order to get Ubuntu to see one of my SATA controllers, but still can't install to the drive that GPART can now see...
2010-11-01T02:46:00.000Z	MetaPhaze		This more or less seems to be a kiddie channel
2010-11-01T02:47:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	What file system is on the drive?
2010-11-01T02:48:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	nothingspecial	the drive wasn't anything, I just built a partition structer in hopes to get Ubuntu to see the drive
2010-11-01T02:48:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	Try formatting it
2010-11-01T02:49:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	nothingspecial	I did, 6GB linux-swap part, ext4 / partition, and ext4 /home partition
2010-11-01T02:50:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	Sounds like a bug, sorry for the missunderstanding. I have been able to install it to any drive i like on multiple machines.
2010-11-01T02:51:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	nothingspecial	I can't see this drive, it took work to get it to even show up in GPART
2010-11-01T02:53:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	Try the alternate install or minimal iso
2010-11-01T02:53:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	nothingspecial	c'mon now! if the default install won't see the drive, then the minimal or alt. wont see it with the complete driver list
2010-11-01T02:54:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	^^
2010-11-01T02:59:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	Me too
2010-11-01T03:00:00.000Z	nothingspecial	MetaPhaze	So install Gentoo
