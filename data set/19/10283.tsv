2006-07-02T07:21:00.000Z	davro_		anyone having problems with x freezing, keeps doing it to me about 3-5 times a day.
2006-07-02T07:23:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	only X or your whole system?
2006-07-02T07:24:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	what system is it u are using? im using a toshiba laptop and it also freezes from time to time everthing else just works fine
2006-07-02T07:28:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	 you know what ati gfx? cause i think there could be the problem. ive got a radeon x200 on my system
2006-07-02T07:28:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	So there is no real fix for this freezing bug, will have a look at the gfx card one sec.
2006-07-02T07:29:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	lspci said VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M6 LY
2006-07-02T07:29:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	well i didnt find any soution till now.
2006-07-02T07:30:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	well its a diffren gfx card but also the mobility
2006-07-02T07:31:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	i have read on the ubuntuforums of people having freezing problems that are running nvida chipsets so ?
2006-07-02T07:32:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	so its another problem
2006-07-02T07:33:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	i also have the feeling that it freezes faster if im running firefox
2006-07-02T07:33:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	Think so but im not sure, i have just finished downloading the debian iso, so i think im going back to debian, this is silly as there seems to be no rush to sort/find/fix the problem/bug whatever.
2006-07-02T07:35:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	yes im also pissed off because everything else worked really fine but if the system falways reezes you cant really use it
2006-07-02T07:36:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	Real shame i liked ubuntu, but i cannot work in hope that it not going to freeze every hour or two.
2006-07-02T07:37:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	yes the same for me
2006-07-02T08:05:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	so you are switching to debian?
2006-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	Yup after running ubuntu for about year and a half, i really need to have a stable laptop for next week.
2006-07-02T08:07:00.000Z	RustyJames	davro_	i understand that. tell me if the problem remains ;-)
2006-07-02T08:07:00.000Z	davro_	RustyJames	Will do mate :)
