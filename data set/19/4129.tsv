2009-03-22T03:17:00.000Z	epaphus		linux
2009-03-22T03:18:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	You can call it whatever you want as long as grub knows what it's called!
2009-03-22T03:19:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	right.. so for that I just have to download the kernel source and rebuild it.. correct? ...
2009-03-22T03:20:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	You shouldn't even have to do that. Just look in /boot/ for your kernel image and rename it, making sure to tell grub the new name (and run grub-install)
2009-03-22T03:20:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	would that give me a new name in uname -a ?
2009-03-22T03:21:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	But as _Whipper said, there's really no reason to do it (other than temping fate on boot problems)
2009-03-22T03:21:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	Oh, you want to change the output from uname?
2009-03-22T03:22:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	thats fine.. i just want to learn.., yes The_Drizzle
2009-03-22T03:25:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	Here's the easy way "1) mv /bin/uname /bin/uname.orig
2009-03-22T03:27:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	indeed.. thats an easy way :) .. the hard way is to tebuild the kernel.. correct?
2009-03-22T03:28:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	I suppose it is. Might I recommend taking an adult education class of some kind if you have this much spare time on your hands? :P
2009-03-22T03:29:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	common.. iam sure you as a higher level linux user have rebuild kernels in the past.. havent you?
2009-03-22T03:29:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	Sure, many times, but not just to display a different uname!
2009-03-22T03:30:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	yeah.. well its an experience .. so that i can say.. i have sucessfully rebuild the kernel and here is the prove hehehehe
2009-03-22T03:30:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	I have actually never rebuilt a custom kernel in Ubuntu... I asked about it here an hour or so and was told it is not a wise decision...
2009-03-22T03:31:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	i agree... but if I go for the default configurations.. just change the name i think i should be safe
2009-03-22T03:32:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	epaphus	Best of luck :)
2009-03-22T03:33:00.000Z	epaphus	The_Drizzle	thank you
