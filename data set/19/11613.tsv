2005-12-22T07:49:00.000Z	Gargoyle		how do I test if 3D accel is working properly?
2005-12-22T07:49:00.000Z	Gargoyle		xorg.log shows no obvious errors
2005-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	run glxheads and see the output
2005-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	it should display which 3d driver it's  using
2005-12-22T07:51:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	there's also glxinfo, which gives much more verbose info
2005-12-22T07:55:00.000Z	Gargoyle	ptlo	It says Mesa Indirect.
2005-12-22T07:56:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	run glxinfo also
2005-12-22T07:56:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	which card do you have, btw?
2005-12-22T07:56:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	i'm not sure what the output is for radeon
2005-12-22T08:02:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	any luck with it?
2005-12-22T08:02:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	hehe, true :) only the first lines are interesting now, glxinfo | less
2005-12-22T08:02:00.000Z	Gargoyle	ptlo	for vendor string it says SGI.
2005-12-22T08:03:00.000Z	Gargoyle	ptlo	I have Radeon X800 XT
2005-12-22T08:08:00.000Z	Gargoyle	ptlo	any more ideas for me? (I think I am getting retina burn of my xorg.conf!)
2005-12-22T08:08:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	what ddoes it say for 'direct rendering' ?
2005-12-22T08:09:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	hmm, no, i'm not radeon user so i don't know how it looks with radeon....setting the right driver in xorg.conf and loading the kernel module should be enough
2005-12-22T08:09:00.000Z	Gargoyle	ptlo	it says no.
2005-12-22T08:10:00.000Z	ptlo	Gargoyle	fglrxinfo  mentiones mesa or radeon?
2005-12-22T08:11:00.000Z	Gargoyle	ptlo	mesa
