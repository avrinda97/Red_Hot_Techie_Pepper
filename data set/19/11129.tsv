2006-08-31T14:52:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	i wouldn;t be bothering with it except VMWare wants an image file from us.
2006-08-31T14:53:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	what kind of image file do you need?
2006-08-31T14:53:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	building an Ubuntu desktop image for them.
2006-09-29T13:20:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	heya

2006-09-29T13:21:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	i'm glad it's friday
2006-09-29T13:24:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	there isn't one. just enable that menu with A La Carte.
2006-09-29T13:24:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	There is one actually: Don't remember what program that was though.
2006-09-29T13:25:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	the menu is there now, it's just hidden.
2006-09-29T13:25:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	Ahh
2006-09-29T13:25:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	the app you're talking about probably just unhides that menu when it installs itself.
2006-09-29T13:28:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	alacarte is open but i dont see how to make debian visible :S
2006-09-29T13:51:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	abortd: you guys still there?
2006-09-29T13:59:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	hey - How do I make debian menu visible in Alacarte then?
2006-09-29T13:59:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	add something to that menu subset
2006-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	erm - okay
2006-09-29T14:03:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	okay - that's odd, i added an entry but the full menu isn't coming.
2006-09-29T14:03:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mneptok	doesn't the Debian menu show all the applications that are installed?
2006-09-29T14:05:00.000Z	mneptok	DJAdmiral	no.
