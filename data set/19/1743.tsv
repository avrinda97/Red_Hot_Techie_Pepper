2011-10-21T08:08:00.000Z	yagoo	CaptWho	?? that's like comparing gnome and kde..
2011-10-21T08:09:00.000Z	yagoo	CaptWho	that's your opinion.. I think that was true in the past..
2011-10-21T08:09:00.000Z	yagoo	CaptWho	I think the opposite
2011-10-21T08:10:00.000Z	CaptWho	yagoo	that might be true...  i haven't touched kde for years
2011-10-21T08:11:00.000Z	yagoo	CaptWho	Um.. I've been using both interfaces for years. Gnome2 i like.. Gnome3 not.. I installed kde4x a few days ago and imho it's better than Gnome3.
2011-10-21T08:11:00.000Z	yagoo	CaptWho	install kde and give it a whirl.. otherwise u're missing out
