2009-10-06T00:49:00.000Z	p1ckLe		whoops
2009-10-06T00:50:00.000Z	p1ckLe		what's a reason that ubuntu would freeze during installation?
2009-10-06T00:51:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	bad cd would do that
2009-10-06T00:51:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	or if installing to flash, it may take longer
2009-10-06T00:52:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	i did the test cd for defects, and test memory, both passed with flying colors.
2009-10-06T00:53:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	let it sit for a while, i've 30meg isos take 40 minutes to install before, shrug
2009-10-06T00:53:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	ill try that, ty
2009-10-06T00:55:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	if it's a live cd, pop open a terminal and watch top and iostat to make sure stuff is being written
2009-10-06T00:55:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	it freezes before i can do anything.
2009-10-06T00:55:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	i cant even move the mouse.
2009-10-06T00:55:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	or open the cd drive.. everything freezes.
2009-10-06T00:56:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	oh... hmm,, how much ram does the box have?
2009-10-06T00:56:00.000Z	p1ckLe		only 128.
2009-10-06T00:56:00.000Z	p1ckLe		its a p3 900mhz 128mb
2009-10-06T00:57:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	yeah, i've had installs fail at 256mb, you might need to find an alternative means of installation... like popping the hdd into a device with more ram if possible then moving it back out again
2009-10-06T00:59:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	ahhh.. Makes sense. I only have a laptop available, is there a way to hook a hdd (if its an internal) to the laptop? or is that not possible?
2009-10-06T01:01:00.000Z	frostburn	p1ckLe	yeah, you can get usb to laptop adapters off newegg or amazon for less than $10
2009-10-06T01:02:00.000Z	p1ckLe	frostburn	awesome.. thanks for ur help, i imagine thats what it is, not enough ram. i think i can get a stick of ram for that box for cheap as well. thanks again.
