2010-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	cpu support ?
2010-11-06T18:22:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	you may try virtual machine within ubuntu
2010-11-06T18:23:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	in fact, it's better for security reasons
2010-11-06T18:23:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	virtual machine trough ubuntu. That sounds nice! I remember people doing the other way around, virtual machine in win to run linux.
2010-11-06T18:24:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	any tips on getting started on doing that (Virtual Machine + windows ) ?
2010-11-06T18:24:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	because virtual machines don't have access to hardware by default, whatever viruses windows might have is contained
2010-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	is there any disadvantage on running win in vm ?
2010-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	it's quite straight forward, if you have the disk space, and CPU support for virtual machine (not absolutely required thought)
2010-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	i'm on a dual 1.4
2010-11-06T18:26:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	what cpu?
2010-11-06T18:26:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	intel
2010-11-06T18:26:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	what model? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM
2010-11-06T18:27:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	I dont know the model :X
2010-11-06T18:27:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	cat /proc/cpuinfo , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization
2010-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	steffen123__  thanks
2010-11-06T18:29:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	then, basically, you create a virutal machine image file, and supply it with an installation cdrom (iso file) to boot to install as normal
2010-11-06T18:31:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	I would recommend KVM, if your cpu supports vmx, and you don't use USB hardware within the virtual windows. otherwise, you use virtualbox
2010-11-06T18:45:00.000Z	Shwaiil	dli	are you there? My cpu is not supported by KVM, so, I guess I must go with virtualbox ?
2010-11-09T05:11:00.000Z	dli	Shwaiil	isn't it right Ctl by default
