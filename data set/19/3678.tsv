2009-07-16T19:13:00.000Z	mazda01		y to get it to stop is to restart the machine. any ideas on that issue while that box restarts?
2009-07-16T19:15:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	you might consider looking at X forwarding via ssh...much better than vnc
2009-07-29T08:21:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	there's an app in universe called pastebinit. it's awesome. you just run pastebinit /filename   and then the terminal returns the pastebin url. awesome app for when you need help.
2009-08-09T23:31:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	unrar e $@
2009-08-09T23:32:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	that's the exact command i should have in user action in rox-filer or is there some quotes needed?
2009-08-09T23:32:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	I think unrar x would work better than unrar e, but no quotes (I think) Don't use rox so it is a best guess
2009-08-09T23:34:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	yeah, i am using rox because xfce4 is just too much for only 256 ram. i like nautilus little box that appears showing me the rar set is extracting
2009-08-09T23:34:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	I use xfce, and there would be no quotes with that
2009-08-09T23:36:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	ok, trying unrar x $@   doesn't appear to do anything? huh, i wish i knew how to use rox better. you'd think that this would work for file manager because it's just passing the command to a shell right?
2009-08-09T23:36:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	I tried rox once. Was impressed with the abilities, but it did seem confusing at times getting it all set up.
2009-08-09T23:37:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	make sure that $@ is what you want for passing the whole path/filename to unrar
2009-08-09T23:38:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	thats the thing. i don't even know what $@ is what I want???? I just want the .r00 or .rar file to extract to the current working dorectory when I click on it in rox-filer.
2009-08-09T23:39:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	have you seen this....http://roscidus.com/desktop/Archive
2009-08-09T23:43:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	thanks, will try. i still wish I could figure out how to add command for certain file types by using the user action thing. i just don't knwo what the $@ means. by default the when I click on user action on a .txt file, this is what it says mousepad "$@" and that actually opens the file i clicked on in mousepad, so I would haev thought that unrar x "$@" would work also for unraring rar sets
2009-08-09T23:44:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	I would have thought that would work....can't see why it won't
2009-08-09T23:44:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	i don't know either??
2009-08-09T23:45:00.000Z	mazda01	th0r	do you know how to see what command is run when clicking on extract here in nautilus? because I know that command extracts the rar set to the directory
2009-08-09T23:46:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	if you can catch it while it is extracting then 'ps ax' in a terminal will show
2009-08-11T06:52:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01	there is supposed to be a man page for every command
