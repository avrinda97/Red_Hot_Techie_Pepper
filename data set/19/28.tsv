2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	shank_		oops
2004-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	shank_		well, i give up on ubuntu
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	shank_		it fails trying to fetch some pkg from the cd
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	shank_		and flashes the screen repeteadly
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	shank_		and f4 terminal shows md4sum
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	shank_		its fin
2004-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	shank_		but some packages are missing
2004-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	shank_		doesn't exactly inspire confidence
2004-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	jdub	shank_	there are no packages missing on the cd.
2004-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	shank_	jdub	um, i'm talking about jigdo
2004-11-18T07:02:00.000Z	jdub	shank_	it's not degrading your performance.
2004-11-18T07:02:00.000Z	shank_	jdub	i was looking at top on the wrong machine :-)
2004-11-18T07:02:00.000Z	jdub	shank_	regardless, that idea is wrong.
2004-11-18T07:03:00.000Z	shank_	jdub	quick heckling me
2004-11-18T07:03:00.000Z	shank_	jdub	your assuming i don't
2004-11-18T07:04:00.000Z	jdub	shank_	"why is the kernel cache'ing so much of the fs? its really degrading my performace"
2004-11-18T07:04:00.000Z	jdub	shank_	based on that, i thought i'd help you understand what's going on
2004-11-18T07:04:00.000Z	shank_	jdub	yes, cause i thought it was caching 410MB worth of shit on a 512mB laptop while swapping out 300mb of stuff
2004-11-18T07:04:00.000Z	shank_	jdub	but as i said, i was looking at the wrong top
