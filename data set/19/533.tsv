2012-01-08T18:32:00.000Z	Xeneth		noone can direct me to instuctions on installing a PCI card?
2012-01-08T18:32:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	installing a PCI card is easy if you have a screwdriver and know how to open your case.
2012-01-08T18:34:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	Ubuntu sees it with lspci, but tty
2012-01-08T18:34:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	Ubuntu sees it with lspci, but ttyS is not show new serial ports
2012-01-08T18:35:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	lspci will show any PCI card.  If you want to use it, you need to make sure that you have a driver loaded for it.
2012-01-08T18:35:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	It's a 4 port serial PCI card.  I have ttyS0 (built in serial) to ttyS31.  None of them other then ttyS0 is reacting like a serial.
2012-01-08T18:36:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	Sadly, I don't know much about PCI serial cards.
2012-01-08T18:36:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	lspci shows the card, so I know it's seen.  I did not have drivers for it so it may be the incorrect drivers.
2012-01-08T18:37:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	but it sounds like ttyS1--31 aren't actually connected to any device, which is an indicator that the kernel didn't load any drivers.
2012-01-08T18:37:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	the best thing to do is to google for the pci id of you card and "linux driver" to see what you find.
2012-01-08T18:38:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	From what I can tell, ttyS1 is my keyboard, it's odd, but I think they are other devices, just not serial.
2012-01-08T18:40:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	have been googling all of yesterday, how I was able to come up with some info.
2012-01-08T18:40:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	/dev/ttyS* exist all the time.  It's a vestige of the way /dev worked in the old days.
2012-01-08T18:40:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	you can have a device node in /dev/ with no device connected to it.
2012-01-08T18:41:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	it's less common today with udev, but it's still possible.  I have no serial ports on my laptop here, yet I have ttyS0--ttyS31
2012-01-08T18:43:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	I am still learning linux, and had to put the reading on hold to work on my CCNA (the reason I am trying to install these).  Since it shows in lspci, I am assuming it's installs, just not setup properly.  Any refrences I can look at to find out how to do this?
2012-01-08T18:46:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	that's the wrong assumption to make.  lspci only shows PCI-specific information like card manufacturer, memory addresses, etc..  It's a tool for browsing.  To actually use the card, you need to load a driver for it.  Linux is usually pretty good about loading drivers for cards that it has drivers for.
2012-01-08T18:46:00.000Z	jmp1	Xeneth	however, if it's not loading, you should follow up with the manufacturer's website to see if they have drivers.  If they don't have drivers, then try to figure out what chipset it uses and then see if there is a generic driver for that chipset.
2012-01-08T19:14:00.000Z	Xeneth	jmp1	  thanks.  That's what I was looking for.  :)  Sorry it took so long to respond.
