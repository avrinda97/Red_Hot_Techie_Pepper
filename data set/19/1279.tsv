2011-09-21T03:49:00.000Z	stupidhead		hi all, using dwm and looking to set random wallpaper with feh.... not sure how to pipe this command to feh though... : find /usr/home/user/Downloads/ -type f -print | random | tail -1
2011-09-21T03:49:00.000Z	stupidhead		could anyone help please?
2011-09-21T03:50:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	or just use $()
2011-09-21T03:52:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	yes
2011-09-21T03:52:00.000Z	stupidhead	jrib	ahh.. this is giving me an illegal variable name.... i should say i'm using sh NOT bash.. take it this makes a difference?
2011-09-21T03:53:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	just use bash :)
2011-09-21T03:53:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	what's "random" do by the way?
2011-09-21T03:54:00.000Z	stupidhead	jrib	random takes directory and randomises it :)
2011-09-21T03:55:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	it seems to return empty sometimes
2011-09-21T03:56:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	yes, seems like you have (1/2^n) probability of not having a background :D
2011-09-21T03:59:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	use of random doesn't seem like the right approach since the chance always exists that it displays nothing
2011-09-21T04:01:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	there were 3 options given to you
2011-09-21T04:03:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	instead of random, "sort -R" is probably a better option
2011-09-21T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	cheako: though command substitution, $(), should work in dash too
2011-09-21T04:09:00.000Z	stupidhead	jrib	if $() is specific to dash or bash then i can't use it as i'm bourne
2011-09-21T04:09:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	erm, what?
2011-09-21T04:09:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	sh is dash on ubuntu by default
2011-09-21T04:11:00.000Z	stupidhead	jrib	using freebsd here. suppose should have started with that
2011-09-21T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	stupidhead	this is the wrong channel then...
