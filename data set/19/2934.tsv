2010-10-03T12:59:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	 try adjusting your mixer settings.  Your mic is probably off
2010-10-03T13:01:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	find a mixer program ,   you can try alsamixer   but its not very friendly
2010-10-03T13:03:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	 thats hard.  you want to make a linux part bigger?
2010-10-03T13:04:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	is there unallocated space on the hard disk?
2010-10-03T13:04:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	 is there windows on the machine?
2010-10-03T13:05:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	 what do you want to use the extra space for?
2010-10-03T13:06:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	,  you can mount the windows partition and use some space there.   You would not have to reformat your whole machine then
2010-10-03T13:06:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	but its not good for general space like software.
2010-10-03T13:07:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	you will have to research that a little, I cant help you.
2010-10-03T13:07:00.000Z	sync3times	ysk	welcome
