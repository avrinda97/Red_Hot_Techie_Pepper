2011-10-17T03:14:00.000Z	FoolsRun		Nice. GDM doesn't work anymore either.
2011-10-17T03:14:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	GMD?
2011-10-17T04:00:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	You're affected by this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-session/+bug/834137
2011-10-17T04:00:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	passwd says my uid is 1000
2011-10-17T04:00:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	At least, you ddn't mentioned what version of ubunt you're using. did you update?
2011-10-17T04:01:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	yes, 11.10
2011-10-17T04:01:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	Clean install, or used Upgrade Release command?
2011-10-17T04:01:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	upgrade release through 11.04's update manager
2011-10-17T04:03:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	could the UID_MIN thing be causing my numerous Unity/LightDM/icons/colors/themes/etc problems?
2011-10-17T04:04:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	Can you run in terminal, dpkg -s indicator-session|grep Version                              Please?
2011-10-17T04:04:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	yes, once my machine comes back up from a reboot
2011-10-17T04:05:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	 Version: 0.3.6-0ubuntu2
2011-10-17T04:08:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	any thoughts?
2011-10-17T04:09:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	Apparently, the bug still exists. :S          "Username shown as [Invalid UTF-8]".
2011-10-17T04:10:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	I seem to be the only one with a white Unity top bar and no GTK theme, though. So that's fun for me.
2011-10-17T04:10:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	I usually do clean installs.
2011-10-17T04:10:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	it would take me weeks to reconfigure everything.
2011-10-17T04:11:00.000Z	Ibis	FoolsRun	I actually am using a white Unity theme right now. Radiance <3
2011-10-17T04:11:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Ibis	maybe Raidence is stuck somewhere, then. My top bar is white and it won't change.
