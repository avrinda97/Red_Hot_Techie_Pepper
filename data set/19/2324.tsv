2010-05-02T19:29:00.000Z	sidboswell		question - why would i resolve hostname-2.local but not hostname.local? this is dual boot machine and the XP instance has the same computer name (so i can resolve locally to either when it is booted)
2010-05-02T19:30:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	cat /etc/hosts | grep 127
2010-05-02T19:31:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	no -2 just says 127.x.x.x localhost and hostname
2010-05-02T19:31:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	and /etc/hostname is just hostname (no -2
2010-05-02T19:31:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	cat /etc/hosts and put it in pastebin
2010-05-02T19:32:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	/etc/hostname is not being looked at when doing name resolution :)
2010-05-02T19:33:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	/etc/hosts looks normal i don't see any -2 or any reason it wouldn't resolve locally (even other computers on the network resolve to hostname-2.local but nobody answers to hostname.local
2010-05-02T19:35:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	1. cat /etc/hosts and put it in pastebin 2. what exactly are you trying to do?
2010-05-02T19:36:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	slava@dogbert:~$ ping localhost.local
2010-05-02T19:36:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	I am trying to have other computers resolve on the local network to this machine using hostname.local
2010-05-02T19:36:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	do you have a DNS server set up?
2010-05-02T19:38:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	pasted in pastebin ... computer is named homebrew and when i do a ping homebrew.local it does not answer (however a ping homebrew-2.local) does
2010-05-02T19:38:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	a link to pastebin with text would be most helpful :)
2010-05-02T19:40:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	what's the link to your pastebinned output?
2010-05-02T19:42:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	- i restarted avahi-daemon and it is now working ... i don't know why this is.  I didn't change any of the conf files
2010-05-02T19:42:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	oh well ...
2010-05-02T19:43:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	my thoughts are that there was a remnant of the hostname.local from the XP instance and avahi didn't want to stomp on it so it just added the -2
2010-05-02T19:43:00.000Z	slavik	sidboswell	could be ... but I suggest having a real DNS server :P
2010-05-02T19:43:00.000Z	sidboswell	slavik	a few more reboots will tell the tale (maybe I'll do a script that sleeps for a bit and then restarts avahi on reboot
