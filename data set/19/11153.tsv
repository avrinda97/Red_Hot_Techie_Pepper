2008-11-13T10:51:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 no, i am not :)
2008-11-13T11:26:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 no clue, sorry.  But do you get the same error message on precompiled virtualbox-ose from apt?
2008-11-13T11:27:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 let me verify: you get the error message "Cannot mix incompatible Qt libraries" on precompiled virtualbox-ose from apt????
2008-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	giacomo	unfo	pvt
2008-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 it is better not to PM without asking first.
2008-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 let's keep it in channel.
2008-11-13T11:29:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 odd.  And vbox doesn't start?
2008-11-13T11:30:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 that is odd.  What have you tried to resolve the problem so far?  (For quicker response, write "unfo: " at the beginning of each line you write to me.  Otherwise I cannot guarantee any response at all.)
2008-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	giacomo	unfo	I really need virtualbox please unfo help me in tracking down the problem, it's a week that I'm fighting. I've checked ldd timestamps of the libs
2008-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	giacomo	unfo	I've gdb backtrace too
2008-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 do you know how to find the key 3 lines of the backtrace?  can you tell me them?
2008-11-13T11:33:00.000Z	giacomo	unfo	immediatly, gimme a second
2008-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	giacomo	unfo	this is the vlc backtrace http://pastebin.com/d63e5ea75
2008-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 please tell me the key 3 lines here.
2008-11-13T11:35:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 no, not that.  I mean the "Application 'foo' crashed with signal SIGSEGV at bar.c line 1234", plus the line of code in question.
2008-11-13T11:36:00.000Z	giacomo	unfo	do you mean recompiling the application with the debugging symbols?
2008-11-13T11:37:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	no.  Use what you have now.  I mean run it, wait for it to crash, then tell me the "Application 'foo' crashed with signal SIGSEGV" line, plus the line after that, from gdb.
2008-11-13T11:38:00.000Z	unfo	giacomo	 I warn you that I must go and get back to coding soon.
