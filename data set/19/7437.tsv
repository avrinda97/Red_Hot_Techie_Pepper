2008-12-17T02:20:00.000Z	grendal_prime		ok i need serious help with gvfs.
2008-12-17T02:21:00.000Z	grendal_prime		i need to be able to connect to a website with...well some sort of ssh based protocol.  I need to be able to edit web documents with quanta.  But for whatever reason in ibex i cannot bet the kio server working with quanta.
2008-12-17T02:21:00.000Z	grendal_prime		is there a way to use gvfs and have it actually mount to a folder so that i can then edit the file with quanta plus as if it were a local file.
2008-12-17T02:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grendal_prime	I think it does that by default, in ~/.gvfs
2008-12-17T02:22:00.000Z	grendal_prime	Jordan_U	one would think..but  i see nothing there.
2008-12-17T02:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grendal_prime	I just tried "mounting" an iso via "Archive Mounter" and it
2008-12-17T02:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grendal_prime	.... and it's showing up in ~/.gvfs
2008-12-17T02:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grendal_prime	How are you using gvfs?
