2005-08-29T13:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	doh!
2005-09-15T13:21:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	Hehe, true...although I can understand a bit of French.
2005-09-15T13:30:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	Damn, you beat me to it.
2005-11-02T16:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	that will remove kubuntu dependencies? i thought only aptitude did that
2005-11-02T16:56:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	Honestly, don't know....figured if it installed everything, it should remove everything as well =)
2005-11-02T16:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	unfortunately, i think that is not correct
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	Well, that's pretty lame, isn't it? =\
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	*shrug* use aptitude
2005-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	What exactly does aptitude do that apt-get doesn't in this case?
2005-11-02T16:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	if you install something with aptitude, when you uninstall it, it will also install dependencies which where installed with it (and not required by other, installed programs) -- or so i believe
2005-11-02T16:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	err, it will also UNinstall dependencies, that is
2005-11-03T17:01:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	That's kinda lame about apt-get. Can't even find a switch to get it to include dependencies.
2005-11-03T17:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	hence aptitude
2005-11-03T17:03:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	My point is whoever designed apt-get should have thought of simple functionality like that.
2005-11-03T17:05:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	aptitude maintains it's own DB for un/installs?
2005-11-03T17:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	i guess has to
2005-11-03T17:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	darkheart	there's a /var/lib/aptitude, maybe it's there
2005-11-03T17:06:00.000Z	darkheart	HappyFool	I guess I can see how it has different functionality then. I figured there was a db that libapt kept that all progs (apt-get,aptitude, etc) referred to.
