2008-03-30T08:29:00.000Z	Peddy		can someone please help me? I get this error when trying to start X: http://pastebin.ca/962946 :)
2008-03-30T08:30:00.000Z	THEO|WxC	Peddy	are you unable to start X at all?
2008-03-30T08:30:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		it looks like that isn't a big problem (that error message), since it says "fixing"
2008-03-30T08:31:00.000Z	Peddy	THEO|WxC	the cursor and a bakground just shows up. and it stays like that.
2008-03-30T08:31:00.000Z	Peddy	THEO|WxC	but I can log in through gnome
2008-03-30T08:32:00.000Z	THEO|WxC	Peddy	I just google'd the error, and it seems I might be right: that isn't a big deal, and probably isn't the reason you are having trouble. That error is just a warning about fonts, but the system automatically fixes it.
2008-03-30T08:33:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		if you are having a problem, it is probably something else.
2008-03-30T08:33:00.000Z	THEO|WxC	Peddy	you are trying to start X from the command line?
2008-03-30T08:33:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		if so, there are usually a few commands and stuff you need to use.
2008-03-30T08:34:00.000Z	Peddy	THEO|WxC	yes, and the error always stays like that. I am starting it from the command line, I want to run a separate x server.
2008-03-30T08:34:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		I can't remember any off the top of my head, since I never start X from the command line (always Gnome, the GDM)
2008-03-30T08:35:00.000Z	THEO|WxC	Peddy	ah... a 2nd X server? in that case that isn't your problem for sure, and there are definately special options and commands you have to give on the command line for that to work.
2008-03-30T08:35:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		I can't help you much there, since it's been many many years since i've had to run multiple X servers,
2008-03-30T08:36:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		but I do remember it can be messy for beginners because there are some config files and commands you have to do special for it.
2008-03-30T08:36:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		because X servers use ports, files, and all sorts of stuff that has to be set up separately for a 2nd server.
2008-03-30T08:37:00.000Z	Peddy	THEO|WxC	I know, startx /usr/bin/gnome-wm -- :2 does not work, either (it starts gnome and gets stuck)
2008-03-30T08:39:00.000Z	THEO|WxC	Peddy	sorry I can't help more, but I'm sure that font thing isn't the problem.
2008-03-30T08:40:00.000Z	THEO|WxC		anyone have a fav 2d animation program?
2008-03-30T08:41:00.000Z	Peddy	THEO|WxC	I won't bother you if you don't want me to, but it gives this error in the terminal: Xlib: connection to ":1.0" refused by server
