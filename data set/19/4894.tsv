2008-10-20T02:37:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	after you added cdrom did you run an update?
2008-10-20T02:37:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	run apt-get update, then try to install the package again
2008-10-20T02:39:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	in /etc/apt/sources.list what does the cdrom line look like?
2008-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	to add a cdrom you should use apt-cdrom
2008-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	example: apt-cdrom -d /mnt/cdrom add
2008-10-20T02:43:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	actually you need an = in there, like apt-cdrom -d=/mnt/cdrom add
2008-10-20T02:44:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	the mount point of the cdrom, usually from /etc/fstab
2008-10-20T02:44:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	it's probably /media/cdrom
2008-10-20T02:50:00.000Z	SpinachHead	dulak	that syntax should be sudo apt-cdrom=/mnt/cdrom0 add  ?
2008-10-20T02:51:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	apt-cdrom -d=/media/cdrom add
2008-10-20T02:52:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	once that's done you should be able to apt-get install packages off the cdrom
2008-10-20T02:58:00.000Z	SpinachHead	dulak	it looked like the cdrom was added to souces but sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper says ccould find package..... or anyone that knows
2008-10-20T02:58:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	is ndiswrapper on that cd?
2008-10-20T03:00:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	try apt-get install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils
2008-10-20T03:35:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	ndiswrapper-utils-1.9 is the actual package name
2008-10-20T03:56:00.000Z	SpinachHead	dulak	thanks for your help. I now have wireless connection
2008-10-20T03:56:00.000Z	dulak	SpinachHead	np
