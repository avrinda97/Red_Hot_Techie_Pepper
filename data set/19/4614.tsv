2009-03-16T04:14:00.000Z	Nalf		Fglrx broke my X! Gahhh pffftbah.
2009-03-16T04:14:00.000Z	Nalf		How do I uninstall fglrx?
2009-03-16T04:15:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	try Synaptic package manager
2009-03-16T04:16:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	"sudo apt-get remove fglrx" should work
2009-03-16T04:17:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	that doesn't work. :
2009-03-16T04:18:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	did you compile it yourself?
2009-03-16T04:18:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	no. All I did was enable the proprietary driver.
2009-03-16T04:20:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	do you have an nvidia card?
2009-03-16T04:20:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	ati. RadeonHD 4850 x 2.
2009-03-16T04:22:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	try fglrx-uninstall
2009-03-16T04:22:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	thank you!
2009-03-16T04:22:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	YAY! I'm still new but glad I could help
2009-03-16T04:31:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	weird
2009-03-16T04:34:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	see if "man fglrx" has anything
2009-03-16T04:34:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	back to ubuntu for me. Brb.
2009-03-16T04:48:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	there was nothing.
2009-03-16T04:53:00.000Z	Chaorain	Nalf	sorry out of ideas
2009-03-16T05:00:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	I found the issue. It's because ubuntu is using an unstable version of X.
2009-03-16T05:00:00.000Z	Nalf	Chaorain	it's not compatible with the FGLRX driver.
