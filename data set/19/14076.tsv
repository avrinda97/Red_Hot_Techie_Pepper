2004-11-15T11:49:00.000Z	utis		I tried cat /dev/psaux and then moving the mouse, but that did help.
2004-11-15T11:50:00.000Z	utis		oh, that means if nothing is screwed up with cat, then the mouse is not detected/connected?
2004-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	utis		hm, in that case I suspect that some drivers are not loaded. I need to enable my laptop touchpad.
2004-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	utis		my USB mouse was plugged in at that time and it works. There is just no provision for both mice in XF86Config-4.
2004-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	utis		hmm, modprobe psmouse changed nothing.
2004-11-15T11:56:00.000Z	utis		I have XF86Config-4 open in an editor on tty1 (the batteries of my USB mouse are empty and X is no fun without a mouse).
2004-11-15T11:57:00.000Z	utis		And I have already frobbed it. To no avail so far.
2004-11-15T11:57:00.000Z	utis		Before I proceed I want to make sure that it is actually detected by the kernel.
2004-11-15T11:57:00.000Z	utis		Since cat /dev/psaux does not produce garbage characters and screw my screen, I suspect that it is not.
2004-11-15T11:58:00.000Z	utis		What do I need to do to make Ubuntu reckognize my touchpad?
2004-11-15T11:58:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	utis	what kind of laptop?
2004-11-15T11:59:00.000Z	utis	KeyserSoze	Fujitu/Siemens Amilo.  It used to be unproblematic back then with Debian Woody, though.
2004-11-15T12:00:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	utis	dmesg|grep PS/2
2004-11-15T12:01:00.000Z	utis	KeyserSoze	mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
2004-11-15T12:08:00.000Z	utis	KeyserSoze	I tried cat as root, but I'll try xxd now to make sure.
2004-11-15T12:09:00.000Z	utis	KeyserSoze	the USB receiver is listed in /proc/bus/input/devices; the USB mouse is out of battery right now. :)
2004-11-15T12:17:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	utis	go to bios and disable something like the parallel port and see if that frees it up
2004-11-15T12:18:00.000Z	utis	KeyserSoze	o.k. I'll be back in a minute or two.
2004-11-15T12:26:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	utis	seriously? thats bs
