2007-05-08T13:57:00.000Z	shimete	crimsun	not
2007-05-08T13:58:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	add your user to the audio group.
2007-05-08T13:58:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	then log out and back in.
2007-05-08T13:58:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	sudo adduser $YOURUSER audio
2007-05-08T13:59:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	replace $YOURUSER as appropriate, of course
2007-05-08T13:59:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	and please don't query me unless I request it.
2007-05-08T14:00:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	private message.  Whisper.  Whatever your client calls it.

2007-05-08T14:07:00.000Z	shimete	crimsun	so i can't use sudo unless the root account says i can...
2007-05-08T14:07:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	so use it with the primary account.
2007-05-08T14:24:00.000Z	shimete	crimsun	do i need to be an administrator to add myself to the audio group?
2007-05-08T14:24:00.000Z	crimsun	shimete	you need to have sudo/root access, yes.
