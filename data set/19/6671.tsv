2007-12-29T09:07:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	use the terminal and type 'sudo su' then use the terminal to copy files
2007-12-29T09:11:00.000Z	katharos		ok, question, last time i used this bt878 capture card, it worked out of the box, now i have no /dev/video0 i assume because the card wasn't in when i installed ubuntu.
2007-12-29T09:11:00.000Z	katharos		How do i set it up?
2007-12-29T09:11:00.000Z	crossen	katharos	for the love of god....please do a walk through....i can usually do this...
2007-12-29T09:14:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	go to the usb in the terminal and type 'chown -R myusername *'
2007-12-29T09:15:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	the usb should be in /media/
2007-12-29T09:16:00.000Z	crossen	katharos	i think i got it....thanks....too much glenlivet....
2007-12-29T09:17:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	cool, i'll just wait until someone answers my question... sigh...
2007-12-29T09:18:00.000Z	katharos		does anyone have any idea how to set up a tv tuner card?
2007-12-29T09:20:00.000Z	crossen	katharos	what was your question....???....
2007-12-29T09:20:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	i have a bt878 tv tuner card which i know works in ubuntu as i have used it before, but before it was automatically set up on install
2007-12-29T09:21:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	this time i've added it after installing ubuntu and i dont know how to set it up
2007-12-29T09:21:00.000Z	katharos		there should be a /dev/video0 but there isn't
2007-12-29T09:23:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	sigh, i guess i'll just go back to searching the ubuntu forums
2007-12-29T09:23:00.000Z	crossen	katharos	i have the same problem....it seems ubuntu is better on install than later additions....is it not possible to reinstall....
2007-12-29T09:26:00.000Z	katharos	crossen	well, it's possible, it's just a pain in the butt. And i'll probably learn more this way :)
