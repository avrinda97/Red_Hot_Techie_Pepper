2005-05-31T06:43:00.000Z	NaWer		i need help for smeg 0.6.1 on hoary, nobody ?
2005-05-31T06:43:00.000Z	NaWer		i know, he seems to be away
2005-05-31T06:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Don't open the preferences dialog, hoary's pygtk sucks.
2005-05-31T06:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Unless you're a KDE user you don't need it anyway.
2005-05-31T06:47:00.000Z	NaWer	Amaranth	the pref dialog seems to load itself when i run smeg
2005-05-31T06:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Now _that_ is odd.
2005-05-31T06:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Run smeg from a terminal, see if it outputs anything.
2005-05-31T06:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Also, does this stick on the screen like that after you've tried to open the preferences dialog or is it always like that?
2005-05-31T06:52:00.000Z	NaWer	Amaranth	nothing in a terminal
2005-05-31T06:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Now I'm just confused...
2005-05-31T06:53:00.000Z	NaWer	Amaranth	and when i open the pref dial with the menu, the empty dial box go a the corner top left on my screen - and smeg freeze
2005-05-31T06:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Ok, I'm starting to think something is wrong with your computer.
2005-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	I'll have to wait for someone else to report the bug before I can even begin to figure out why it's happening.
2005-05-31T06:56:00.000Z	NaWer	Amaranth	i've use the script, and i've got a depandance error like this : http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=184438&postcount=6
2005-05-31T06:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	You need to install the pyxdg deb linked to in the first post in the thread.
2005-05-31T06:58:00.000Z	NaWer	Amaranth	i've did it :(
2005-05-31T06:59:00.000Z	NaWer	Amaranth	smeg work now, but with a empty pref dial at the stat up of smeg
2005-05-31T06:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	I know, you told me. Does the pref dialog ever go away though?
2005-05-31T07:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	NaWer	Nevermind, I know the answer. I'll try to work something out for 0.6.2, but I'm not even sure what is wrong.
