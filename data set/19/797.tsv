2011-12-30T10:58:00.000Z	thechris		Does anyone know if ubuntu's gcc sets -Werror-implicit-function-declaration someplace?
2011-12-30T10:59:00.000Z	thechris		I've been trying to install the rt2870 modules, and they don't build
2011-12-30T10:59:00.000Z	thechris		There is a warning about implicit function declarations, which then becomes an error.
2011-12-30T11:00:00.000Z	thechris		I've tried to find the offending lines and remove them, but this hasn't worked./
2011-12-30T11:00:00.000Z	thechris		I'm assuming that if this option was meant to be set, then someone at ralink would have seen the issue.
2011-12-30T11:01:00.000Z	thechris		Which makes me think the issue is with something in ubuntu's setup
2011-12-30T11:01:00.000Z	thechris		there are a lot of .o.cmd files, but I think these are generated by the makefile and not used by the makefile
2011-12-30T11:01:00.000Z	Flatlined	thechris	: Firmware?
2011-12-30T11:02:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	this is the rt2870sta kernel module
2011-12-30T11:05:00.000Z	Flatlined	thechris	: you need the firmware
2011-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	Flatlined	thechris	: http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=firmware-ralink
2011-12-30T11:49:00.000Z	Flatlined	thechris	: you need the firmware
2011-12-30T11:49:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	as far as I can tell, i have it.
2011-12-30T11:51:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	do you have any specific information about where to get the firmware, and what to do with it when I get it?
2011-12-30T11:52:00.000Z	Flatlined	thechris	: unplug the adaptor and post your "dmesg" to paste bin
2011-12-30T11:52:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	i got the rt2860 firmware and the rt2870 firmware and placed both .bin files in /lib/firmware
2011-12-30T11:52:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	agian, no internet access.  the dmesg is pretty short though
2011-12-30T11:53:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	"rtusb init --->"
2011-12-30T11:53:00.000Z	thechris	Flatlined	'usbcore: registered new interface device rt2870"
