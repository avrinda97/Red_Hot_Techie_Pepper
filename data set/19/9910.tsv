2006-10-28T13:47:00.000Z	Tjoels		If i don't know the HorizSync and VertRefresh rates of my screen, what should i enter in xorg.conf then?
2006-10-28T13:48:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	have it auto detect
2006-10-28T13:50:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	how do you make it auto?
2006-10-28T13:50:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	did it work in the live cd?
2006-10-28T13:51:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	autodetect?
2006-10-28T13:54:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	if it worked with the live cd, what do you mean?
2006-10-28T13:56:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	was your monitor configured properly inside the live cd environmen?
2006-10-28T13:56:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	if so, save that config
2006-10-28T13:56:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	and use it in your system
2006-10-28T13:56:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	yeah, it was.
2006-10-28T13:57:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	isn't there a way of getting it to auto detect it?
2006-10-28T13:57:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	then just boot into the live cd and email /etc/X11/xorg.conf to yourself then save it over your system configured one that is installed to the HDD
2006-10-28T13:57:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	Xorg -configure
2006-10-28T13:58:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	Xorg -configure will make it auto detect?
2006-10-28T13:58:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	it will try to detect all your settings
2006-10-28T14:34:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	your monitor sync ranges are too low then
2006-10-28T14:35:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	well, i did the reconfigure and set it in "medium" mode to 1280x1024 @ 60 Hz....
2006-10-28T14:35:00.000Z	khermans_	Tjoels	then maybe your monitor cant handle it
2006-10-28T14:36:00.000Z	Tjoels	khermans_	it can. all these problems just appeared after updating the nvidia-glx from the update manager!
