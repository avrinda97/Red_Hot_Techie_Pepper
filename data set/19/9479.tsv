2006-11-01T14:01:00.000Z	dom_f		Can anyone suggest how I troubleshoot the root partition not showing in df or mount in Edgy?  I've spent a long while googling and searching ubuntuforums and could do with some help!  More info at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2258
2006-11-01T14:01:00.000Z	dom_f		Thx
2006-11-01T14:02:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	your /etc/mtab is out of sync with the real world
2006-11-01T14:02:00.000Z	dom_f	GyrosGeier	I know - however this is constant after each reboot and some things seem to depend on mtab
2006-11-01T14:04:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	I don't know the details of that process, given that the root fs is usually mounted with -n I'm actually puzzled it *does* show up
2006-11-01T14:05:00.000Z	dom_f		OK - back to basics - does / show up in df on Edgy for anyone else?
2006-11-01T14:06:00.000Z	dom_f	GyrosGeier	 Didn't know it was mounted with -n
2006-11-01T14:07:00.000Z	dom_f		Paddy - which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2006-11-01T14:09:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	it is, because / is readonly at this point, which leads to mount failing because it writes the new mtab to a temp file first, then mounts, then renames
2006-11-01T14:10:00.000Z	dom_f	GyrosGeier	Thanks.  Any idea what else I can check/try?
2006-11-01T14:10:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	not really
2006-11-01T14:10:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	you can always remount it again later
2006-11-01T14:10:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	then it should show up
2006-11-01T14:10:00.000Z	dom_f		Thanks Anyway - anyone else got any ideas ? (df and mount missing root!)
2006-11-01T14:11:00.000Z	dom_f		See https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2258 for more details
2006-11-01T14:12:00.000Z	dom_f	GyrosGeier	- wouln't my sudo mount -a attempt to remount it?
2006-11-01T14:13:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	no, -a doesn't do remounts
2006-11-01T14:15:00.000Z	dom_f		OK - GyrosGeier - if I try sudo mount  -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /   I get mount: /dev/hda1 already mounted or / busy
2006-11-01T14:15:00.000Z	GyrosGeier	dom_f	-o remount
