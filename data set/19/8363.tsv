2007-10-31T06:54:00.000Z	monkeyBox		Ok, I'm having this really annoying problem w/ my video display.  I keep seeing green "sparkling" dots in various places, and when I try to run certain graphics intensive programs, the screen just goes black for a couple of seconds.  What could be causing this?
2007-10-31T06:56:00.000Z	ztomic	monkeyBox	how much mem? vid/system.
2007-10-31T06:57:00.000Z	monkeyBox	ztomic	 768M system..  how do I find out my video memory?
2007-10-31T06:58:00.000Z	monkeyBox		My video card is:  "nVidia GeForce4 Ti 4200 AGP 8x"
2007-10-31T06:59:00.000Z	ztomic	monkeyBox	you could #lspci and find it on the net.
