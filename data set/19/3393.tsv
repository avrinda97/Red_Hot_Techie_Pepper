2009-08-28T04:21:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		Audacious is my favorite, sorta
2009-08-28T04:21:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		just because it's a WinAmp clone
2009-08-28T04:21:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		What frontend do you use kri?
2009-08-28T04:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		Isn't xmms a CLI app?
2009-08-28T04:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		Ah, xmms2 must of been what I installed
2009-08-28T04:24:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		If Amarok got it's EQ working again I'd use it.
2009-08-28T04:24:00.000Z	BioVore	MilitantPotato	they break it again?
2009-08-28T04:24:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		I've really had a falling out with KDE4 in a major way
2009-08-28T04:25:00.000Z	BioVore	MilitantPotato	same.. kde4 just dosn't do it for me anymore..
2009-08-28T04:25:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		KDE4 feels like a demo, no real features that made KDE3.5 great work, alot of  the apps are incomplete
2009-08-28T04:26:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		Amarok's prev version was amazing, they released the latest w/o most of the features it needs to be a complete player.
2009-08-28T04:27:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	BioVore	EQ has been missing since they went with 2.0 yea?
2009-08-28T04:27:00.000Z	BioVore	MilitantPotato	I guess..  I havn't bothered with kde4 atm.  I am still using kde3
2009-08-28T04:28:00.000Z	BioVore		works better imo
2009-08-28T04:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	BioVore	on Jaunty?
2009-08-28T04:28:00.000Z	BioVore	MilitantPotato	Naw.. I run LTS  8.04
2009-08-28T04:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	BioVore	ahh, If it wasn't such a chore I'd downgrade.  going to gnome was easier
2009-08-28T04:29:00.000Z	BioVore	MilitantPotato	technically you could build it..  I wouldn't be supprised if someone has some debs..
2009-08-28T04:29:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	BioVore	There are, I prefer to avoid 3rd party or bleeded edge installs
