2006-04-04T12:51:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	no
2006-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	try with -idx
2006-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	if that doesn't work try with -vo=x11
2006-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	some videos need an index to seek and don't have one - -idx builds one before playing it
2006-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	WiFi_Warri0r	trappist	im not having video problems, im having trouble with my sm\amba file shares
2006-04-04T13:12:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	a) don't paste here.  b) smbpasswd -e
2006-04-04T13:12:00.000Z	WiFi_Warri0r	trappist	sorry and thnx
2006-04-04T13:15:00.000Z	WiFi_Warri0r	trappist	i typed in "smbpasswd -e roy -n" and it still shows me switches, any help?
2006-04-04T13:16:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	maybe your smbpasswd file is in the old format.  man smbpasswd and search for 'enable'
2006-04-04T13:16:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	oh, and you have to run it as root (i.e. with sudo)
2006-04-04T13:17:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	there is none.  sudo takes *your* password.
2006-04-04T13:18:00.000Z	trappist	WiFi_Warri0r	not su.  sudo.
