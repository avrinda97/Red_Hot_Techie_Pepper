2006-06-06T12:32:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	I want a powerbook ...
2006-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	stevejesus	CrippsFX	15-inch 1.25, airport extreme, 512mb
2006-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	stevejesus	CrippsFX	will ship with fresh dapper is desired.
2006-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	what's the processor, clock speed, and price?
2006-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	stevejesus		Cripps, just sent that info... look above.  800?
2006-06-06T12:34:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	you got all but clock speed and storage in there.
2006-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	unfortunately I don't have 800 to play with :/
2006-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	stevejesus		1.25 g4, and 60gb
2006-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	CrippsFX		ahh. that's what the 1.25 was.
2006-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	stevejesus		Cripps, are you interested?
2006-06-06T12:36:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	I'd like to be, but I can't justify spending that much money.
2006-06-06T12:36:00.000Z	stevejesus	CrippsFX	actually i need to sell it so bad that if you buy it in the next couple of days, i will throw in some harmon kardon soundsticks (non-USB, the good ones) at no charge
2006-06-06T12:37:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	heh. payday isn't for 2 weeks, and even then, to give you an idea, I could only afford a max of $200
2006-06-06T12:37:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	and you could definitely get more for that.
2006-06-06T12:37:00.000Z	stevejesus	CrippsFX	oh well.  guess it will be going on craigslist.
2006-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	CrippsFX	stevejesus	sorry I can't help you out there.
2006-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	stevejesus	CrippsFX	i could, but i want to be fair.  and the new intel macbooks are really driving the value down
