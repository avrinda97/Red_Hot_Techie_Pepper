2005-10-27T10:30:00.000Z	hyphenated	kono	when it says to edit something, it can be done in a number of ways. there are editor programs for shells, and editor programs for GUI environments
2005-10-27T10:30:00.000Z	hyphenated	kono	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2005-10-27T10:31:00.000Z	hyphenated	kono	you need to install it first! :-)
