2007-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	jack		how is it possible a disk is mounted (rw), but still a "read-only filesystem"? ;x
2007-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	jack		cant even boot up my feisty anymore because of that
2007-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	jack		glad if i can get any hints :(
2007-06-04T12:16:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	can't mount the root filesystem?
2007-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	jack	dawn_chorus	it is mounted, i'm in text (recovery) mode atm
2007-06-04T12:20:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	i dunno.  you in text mode now?
2007-06-04T12:21:00.000Z	jack	dawn_chorus	i feel so f**king lost
2007-06-04T12:21:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	not too sure myself.  have you edited /etc/fstab recently?
2007-06-04T12:22:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	which kernel?
2007-06-04T12:23:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	uname -r
2007-06-04T12:23:00.000Z	jack	dawn_chorus	i'll brb
2007-06-04T12:25:00.000Z	jack	dawn_chorus	2.6.20-16-generic
2007-06-04T12:25:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	and it's done this every time you've tried to boot into this kernel?
2007-06-04T12:26:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	perhaps it's a bug in the kernel.  do you have any other kernel entries in your GRUB menu that you can boot into?
2007-06-04T12:28:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	can you get the exact error that's produced when you boot?
2007-06-04T12:29:00.000Z	jack	dawn_chorus	it just hangs, after executing all the rc6 scripts with start
2007-06-04T12:30:00.000Z	jack	dawn_chorus	then x doesnt come up, and init seems dead
2007-06-04T12:31:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	i'm not sure what's going on man.
2007-06-04T12:32:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	jack	try booting into a livecd, chrooting and updating.
