2007-12-20T17:34:00.000Z	Xsylotte		i've updated gutsy and restarted computer.
2007-12-20T17:34:00.000Z	Xsylotte		after that i got that error
2007-12-20T17:35:00.000Z	Xsylotte		hmm, what to do now ?
2007-12-20T17:35:00.000Z	Xsylotte		:D
2007-12-20T17:36:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	did you reboot with the noapic or apic=debug options, as it suggested?  Or just tried the recovery mode boot?
2007-12-20T17:36:00.000Z	Xsylotte	etfb	atm i am running ubuntu with noapic
2007-12-20T17:36:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	and it booted ok?  (it's late where I am; forgive me if I ask braindead questions)
2007-12-20T17:36:00.000Z	Xsylotte	etfb	yes,'
2007-12-20T17:38:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	recompiling kernels is well outside my area of expertise, but presumably there's some kind of option to do with the 8254 timer chip and APIC that you can set when you ./configure or make or whatever...
2007-12-20T17:39:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	you didn't save a copy of the old kernel before you rebuilt?
2007-12-20T17:39:00.000Z	Xsylotte	etfb	I am linux newbie, I used Update manager.
2007-12-20T17:40:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	that's good news - it means the old kernel is still sitting there, I expect.  Sorry - didn't you say you recompiled your kernel yourself?  Did I misread?
2007-12-20T17:40:00.000Z	Xsylotte	etfb	you misread.
2007-12-20T17:41:00.000Z	Xsylotte	etfb	 :D
2007-12-20T17:42:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	presumably I got the new kernel too, so I'll have a look and see if I can find where it puts the old one.
2007-12-20T17:43:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	tt_: any idea what the newest version number is?
2007-12-20T17:49:00.000Z	etfb	Xsylotte	probably by editing your boot menu.  Hang on while I get the details
