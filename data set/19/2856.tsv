2010-07-16T17:47:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		guys.. one question.. i downloaded ubuntu 10 series [ .iso DVD file ] .. but when trying to bring it up in VM .. just a blank screen shows up
2010-07-16T17:48:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		any additional config we need to do ...unlike other flavours
2010-07-16T17:48:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		lol abhijit
2010-07-16T17:48:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	stanley_robertso	did you download a live version?
2010-07-16T17:49:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		its ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso   noisewaterphd
2010-07-16T17:49:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	stanley_robertso	vmware player or virtualbox?
2010-07-16T17:49:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		virtual box.. i shld be specific
2010-07-16T17:50:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		iam able to install/use ubuntu 9 .. but not 10 series
2010-07-16T17:50:00.000Z	noisewaterphd		i'd say ditch the dvd, and just install from the iso and see what happens
2010-07-16T17:50:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		yes.. i booted the virtual box .. using the .iso itself
2010-07-16T17:50:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		just a black screen comes up
2010-07-16T17:50:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		:(
2010-07-16T17:50:00.000Z	noisewaterphd		i see
2010-07-16T17:51:00.000Z	noisewaterphd		i hate to send you away, but you'd have better luck on the virtualbox channel
2010-07-16T17:51:00.000Z	stanley_robertso	noisewaterphd	 i hope you are referring me :)
2010-07-16T17:51:00.000Z	noisewaterphd		somebody over there will likely have run into the issue
2010-07-16T17:52:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	stanley_robertso	ya
2010-07-16T17:52:00.000Z	stanley_robertso		will try in the vbox channel .. be right back :)
2010-07-16T17:52:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	stanley_robertso	I'm not saying that nobody here could help, just that that sounds like a virtual box problem, not an ubuntu problem, so those guys might be of better assistance
