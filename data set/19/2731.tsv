2012-10-08T22:08:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	have you check the file system health in windows
2012-10-08T22:08:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	you MUST
2012-10-08T22:08:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	it is there for a REASON
2012-10-08T22:09:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	if you don't unmount the device properly in Windows it wil be marked as dirty and Linux will have issues with it. You will also not physically damage the device
2012-10-08T22:10:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	you as mistreating your device, then are surpricd you are getting issues?
2012-10-08T22:10:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	plug the device into windows and check the device's health
2012-10-08T22:11:00.000Z	actionParsnip	foirin	then in the system tray, you will see an icon to eject the device safely, use this and I bet it works in Linux without issue
