2010-08-14T14:48:00.000Z	rypervenche		I have a question for anyone who is able to help. I just got Ubuntu and I was wondering... If I have to change monitors, is there anything that I have to do or will it automatically recognize the monitor?
2010-08-14T14:48:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	automatically, but you might have to change the resolution yourself
2010-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	hmm, what device is it?
2010-08-14T14:51:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	not drivers, modules.
2010-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	Oh, ok. I am brand new to Linux^^ I am very excited about it though. It looks very fun and promising.
2010-08-14T14:53:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	yes, yes. what are you using to connect to the inet?
2010-08-14T14:54:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	I have had this PC for a while with Windows Vista on it. I just put Ubuntu on it with Wubi last night.
2010-08-14T14:54:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	what is problem?
2010-08-14T14:55:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	Well, I have reinstalled Ubuntu since my problem because I couldn't figure out a solution.
2010-08-14T14:55:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	bad idea.
2010-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	Well, after installing Ubuntu, I went downstairs with my PC and used a different monitor and keyboard and then it didn't load Ubuntu when I tried downstairs.
2010-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	your monitor might not be correct
2010-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	and I came back upstairs and it didn't work. I just kept getting that black screen with white lettering with different things on it, all saying "resume from disk failed"
2010-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	Well the one I use is a widescreen and the one downstairs is not.
2010-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	that shall not be a problem
2010-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	I'm on the windows on it now.
2010-08-14T14:58:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	I never hibernate or anything like that.
2010-08-14T14:58:00.000Z	Kwpolska	rypervenche	maybe the system did it for you?
2010-08-14T15:01:00.000Z	rypervenche	Kwpolska	So basically changing hardware shouldn't affect my Ubuntu and it must have been another problem? Or could it have been the monitor resolution that messed it up?
