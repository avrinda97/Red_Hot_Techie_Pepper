2007-04-18T09:27:00.000Z	iamalex		but i'll try that i guess
2007-04-18T09:27:00.000Z	iamalex		*sigh*
2007-04-18T09:27:00.000Z	iamalex		supergrub site is down as well
2007-04-18T09:28:00.000Z	iamalex		yes?
2007-04-18T09:28:00.000Z	iamalex		but how do i configure my menu.lst
2007-04-18T09:28:00.000Z	iamalex		i can't get to a terminal
2007-04-18T09:29:00.000Z	iamalex		i know
2007-04-18T09:29:00.000Z	iamalex		i know what menu.lst is ;) i'm not a noob ive just never had a problem installing
2007-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	iamalex		this is what I get for trying to learn somethiing new and setting up lvm
2007-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	iamalex		no
2007-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	but if you don't get a grub error that means you didn't install grub -- the grub install is in stages, and at the very least you should have the stage1 component on the mbr
2007-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	so reinstall it :-)
2007-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	you can use the live cd
2007-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	chroot into your old environment and use grub-install
2007-04-18T09:31:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	you did an install, right?
2007-04-18T09:31:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	if you have _no_ environment grub won't be able to find the stage 1.5 files and you will get a grub error
2007-04-18T09:32:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	that's fine. you can still boot offthe live cd and chroot into your ubuntu install
2007-04-18T09:33:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	it doesn't matter what you use -- you don't even need an ubuntu cd -- you just need a cd with a mount command and a chroot command
2007-04-18T09:36:00.000Z	eck	iamalex	it might be a bit harder with lvm, you may have to manually set up the lvm environment before you can properly mount it, but that shouldn't be too big of a problem
