2009-03-26T03:21:00.000Z	perillux		nmap doesn't appear to work, when I use the '-A' option for OS detection.  I can paste the output if needed.  But, is anyone else having this problem?
2009-03-26T03:22:00.000Z	rww	perillux	can you paste the output and the nmap command you used to http://paste.ubuntu.com, then link the page it creates in here, please?
2009-03-26T03:25:00.000Z	perillux	rww	http://paste.ubuntu.com/137851/  Then directly after that output it still displays the normal info such as IP and open ports found.  It just doesn't do any OS detection.
2009-03-26T03:26:00.000Z	rww	perillux	Looks like you ran into a known bug that hasn't been fixed yet: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nmap/+bug/288358
2009-03-26T03:27:00.000Z	rww	perillux	lemmie see if I can find a workaround =/
2009-03-26T03:27:00.000Z	perillux	rww	thanks for the help
2009-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	rww	perillux	9.04 is Jaunty, the current development release due to be released in April
2009-03-26T03:31:00.000Z	rww	perillux	Looks like the nmap thing hasn't been fixed yet. There's a possible Debian patch waiting for a maintainer fix, and it might be fixed in Jaunty, but it doesn't seem there's a working Intrepid version yet.
2009-03-26T03:32:00.000Z	rww	perillux	You could always download it from the site and compile it from source if you're comfortable with that, but that's a messy solution :/
2009-03-26T03:33:00.000Z	perillux	rww	I think I can wait for Jaunty, it's about a month away right?
2009-03-26T03:33:00.000Z	rww	perillux	The current plan is to release it on April 23rd.
2009-03-26T03:34:00.000Z	perillux	rww	I'm not so comfortable with installing programs that already exist in the repositories.  I had a bad experience with that when I first started using ubuntu.
2009-03-26T03:35:00.000Z	rww	perillux	Yeah, that's an understandable attitude. I try not to do it myself. Only reason I suggested it was that I've compiled nmap before (on OS X) and it has relatively-few dependencies. Let me go check if Jaunty's nmap works.
2009-03-26T03:35:00.000Z	perillux	rww	that would be great, thanks
2009-03-26T03:39:00.000Z	rww	perillux	erk. I got a different error from you, and it still didn't work.
2009-03-26T03:39:00.000Z	rww	perillux	hang on a couple of minutes and I'll throw some more tests and see what's going on.
2009-03-26T03:47:00.000Z	rww	perillux	Looks like I'm getting the same error as https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nmap/+bug/331303 . I'm gonna take a look at the nmap package tonight and see what the heck's going on with it, but I have to leave now, so that's all the info I can give you for now.
2009-03-26T03:52:00.000Z	perillux	rww	alright man, thanks.  I'll keep an eye on those bugs, hopefully it will be fixed by jaunty, I can live with that.
2009-03-26T03:52:00.000Z	perillux	rww	I actually gotta go, too peace
