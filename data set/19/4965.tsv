2008-09-27T16:31:00.000Z	spunk		Hello! How do I install a .deb file? I've tried using the gdebi-gtk. But it complains about some dependency. I still wishes to try my luck and install it anyways. How do I do that?

2008-09-27T16:32:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	thanks!
2008-09-27T16:35:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	It turns out that my .deb package depends on a number of libs that I don't have. Or rather, I have them, but older versions of them. That leaves me two questions: 1) is it possible to force an install anyways. 2) is it fruitful to force it, or will the application be broken due to old libs?
2008-09-27T16:36:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	Your .deb-Package depend on special Libs. If you don't install this libs, your Progs dont go. It's possible but not good to do so
2008-09-27T16:38:00.000Z	pfloydde		spunk:What Package you want install?
2008-09-27T16:38:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	It is planner 0.14.3. It is available for intrepid. Im on 8.04..
2008-09-27T16:39:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	I have 0.14.2 installed right now...
2008-09-27T16:40:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	I understand. Now you want install the new version
2008-09-27T16:43:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	Than you have to install all the new libs by hand. But it is a bad bad game. A better solution is you compile all by hand from source than. I would wait ;-)
2008-09-27T16:44:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	I'm considering that too. Problem is that the current version contains a show-stopper bug. :-)
2008-09-27T16:47:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	The current installed Version? Or the new version?
2008-09-27T16:48:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	the current installed version.
2008-09-27T16:48:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	according the planner's change list, the bug has been adressed in the intrepid-version (0.14.3)
2008-09-27T16:50:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	I read the Changelogs.... reading... reading...
2008-09-27T16:51:00.000Z	spunk	pfloydde	it is bug #486990
2008-09-27T16:53:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	I see.
2008-09-27T16:57:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	Only way i see without destroy the package-DB, is to install it from sources.
2008-09-27T16:59:00.000Z	pfloydde	spunk	you ever do something like this?
