2011-01-06T21:51:00.000Z	tucemiux		is there a guru that can help me?  I just installed the updates, rebooted my machine, now it sends me to a login prompt, i hit alt-F7 and the last message I see is "Home directory /etc/timidity not ours"
2011-01-06T21:53:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	Could you please be a little more descriptive?
2011-01-06T21:55:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	 I just installed the updates, I rebooted my machine, after I rebooted my machine it goes into console mode instead of GUI,  it's use the first terminal(alt-F1), I cant manually startx
2011-01-06T21:56:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	Can you log in to the terminal, on TTY0 (Alt-F1)? What are the permissions of the /etc/timidity folder that it's complaining about?
2011-01-06T21:57:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	 theyre owned by root
2011-01-06T21:58:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	Okay. Next, could you please run "grep $USER /etc/passwd" ?
2011-01-06T21:59:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	...and could you please post the output?
2011-01-06T22:00:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	Feel free to send it to me via private chat if you do not want to put it in this channel.

2011-01-06T22:00:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	nothing wrong there
2011-01-06T22:01:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	DId the updates finish properly, that you know of? Could you try running them again from the console? "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"
2011-01-06T22:02:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	the updates finished completely, I got a prompt asking me if I wanted to reboot now or later, i clicked on later,  after a few minutes I rebooted now I cant boot up to GUI mode
2011-01-06T22:04:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	the problem is with X server, I cant boot up using failsafe mode
2011-01-06T22:07:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	I found this, maybe it will help? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/timidity/+bug/531733
2011-01-06T22:09:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	 thanks for the reply, at first I thought it was timidity as well, it's actually the nvidia drivers got hosed after the updates, I managed to get the default drivers and blacklisted nvidia, I have low quality GUI on my box, now to fix nvidia broken drivers
2011-01-06T22:10:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	I suspect I wont be the only one with this bug, here's the fix: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1658874
2011-01-06T22:16:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	Oh, wow...that's quite the fix. It has to do with the NVidia drivers, eh?
2011-01-06T22:17:00.000Z	tucemiux	nesv	yes, now I have a GUI,  now im attempting to activate the nvidia drivers
2011-01-06T22:18:00.000Z	nesv	tucemiux	Awesome. I'm glad you got it fixed enough to a usable state.
