2009-07-05T23:25:00.000Z	stevecoh1		I am using Ubuntu 8.04 on a Dell Inspiron 530.  My problem is that boot sequence is flaky.  That is, SOMETIMES, it boots up fine, other times, I get to the Ubuntu orange bar screen and the orange bar goes back and forth forever.  What is it looking for and not finding, and how can I fix this?

2009-07-05T23:28:00.000Z	stevecoh1		I don't believe so.  It has been this way ever since I got it.
2009-07-05T23:29:00.000Z	stevecoh1		I've checked the drive and it never complains.
2009-07-05T23:29:00.000Z	stevecoh1		If it isn't the drive, can it be something else?
2009-07-05T23:31:00.000Z	stevecoh1		Again, I don't think there is anything wrong with the drive.  What else could cause the flaky booting.  Anything?
2009-07-05T23:32:00.000Z	stevecoh1		Is there any way to make the Ubuntu boot sequence less opaque?  That is, see what's behind the orange bars?
2009-07-05T23:32:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	dmesg will show some boot up info
2009-07-05T23:33:00.000Z	stevecoh1	jjnw	after a failed boot followed by a successful one?
2009-07-05T23:34:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	yes. You also have info in the log files /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog
2009-07-05T23:35:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	you can edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-05T23:37:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	remove the splash and quiet from the end of the line starting kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.x.x
2009-07-05T23:39:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	stovicek does it better
2009-07-07T19:07:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	not sure about this but you may need a backtick (`) and not a single quote (')
2009-07-07T19:09:00.000Z	stevecoh1	jjnw	no that's not it
2009-07-07T19:10:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	sorry about this but could paste the cmd line again, I've lost it off top
2009-07-07T19:11:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	no, the cmd line, not the output
2009-07-07T19:12:00.000Z	stevecoh1	jjnw	the command line is aptitude search `?installed`
2009-07-07T19:14:00.000Z	jjnw	stevecoh1	just tried  aptitude search '?installed' and it works fine (not backtick, my oops)
