2008-11-26T08:19:00.000Z	lavacano201014		Hmm, I got nothin'.
2008-11-26T08:21:00.000Z	lavacano201014		I still got nothin'.
2008-11-26T08:21:00.000Z	lavacano201014		kc8pxy-\ Where does the webstart app look for them?
2008-11-26T08:22:00.000Z	lavacano201014		Usually in the same directory as the app, methinks
2008-11-26T08:22:00.000Z	lavacano201014		Or like in ./lib or ./jars or something]
2008-11-26T08:24:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	most of them seem to be in the jre directory(it was designed narrowly to work best on windows or MacOs) for some reason it fails to verify some jars when i simply run the webstart file on any linux distro i've found,  but TRIES really hard and mostly succeeds on wine.   but if i can wine it, i SHOULD be able to make the native vm run it.
2008-11-26T08:25:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 there is A LOT of display corruption when i run it as a webstart undure a wine'd jre.
2008-11-26T08:26:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 how do i as apt/dpkg where the files for the jre got put?
2008-11-26T08:58:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 mind helping me troubleshoot this?
2008-11-26T08:59:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 that :-(
2008-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	just after you asked what  just now, i posted it..
2008-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	netx: Initialization Error: Could not initialize applet. (net.sourceforge.jnlp.LaunchException Fatal: Initialization Error: A fatal error occurred while trying to verify jars.)
2008-11-26T09:02:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 how do i unscrew them? it works "fine" on the jre in wine.
2008-11-26T09:05:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 IIRC, not..   they might have binary's in them, but they are zips, IIRC.
2008-11-26T09:06:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	i guess we have a different perspective of the definition "binary.   but ok.  i think of a binary as a machine-code executable :)
2008-11-26T09:07:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 let's agree to have different definitions(and understand the difference) and work past it.
2008-11-26T09:08:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 either way, how do we fix the jar?
2008-11-26T09:10:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	......   this is a jnlp we're running.  most of the jar's are remote.
2008-11-26T09:11:00.000Z	kc8pxy	lavacano201014	 thx for helping.
