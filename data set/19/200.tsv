2012-07-01T07:21:00.000Z	wolfgang_		Hello i was on earlier asking about mupen64plus i got it how do i run it?
2012-07-01T07:22:00.000Z	wolfgang_		I got it through sudo apt-get
2012-07-01T07:23:00.000Z	wolfgang_		How do i run mupen64plus? i did it with terminal but it doesn't run the rom files
2012-07-01T07:24:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, What router do you have?
2012-07-01T07:24:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, you should go to your default gateway in your browser
2012-07-01T07:25:00.000Z	xDD	wolfgang_	One of the wrt*s, but right now I'm on the local network - Is there a builtin firewall of sorts in Ubuntu?
2012-07-01T07:25:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, yes
2012-07-01T07:25:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, Did you configure your router in the internet browser?
2012-07-01T07:26:00.000Z	xDD	wolfgang_	Yep, a while ago, though. This is a fresh install (it was working before)
2012-07-01T07:26:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, In terminal do "sudo ufw allow (port #)
2012-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, that should do it
2012-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	xDD	wolfgang_	ActionParsnip: I'll check out ufw. Thanks!
2012-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, Np
2012-07-01T07:30:00.000Z	wolfgang_		I got a N64 emulator called mupen64plus and can't get it to run roms, how would i do that?
2012-07-01T07:30:00.000Z	xDD	wolfgang_	ActionParsnip: Hmm... According to the gufw gui, the firewall isn't currently on...
2012-07-01T07:30:00.000Z	wolfgang_		XDD, Do sudo ufw enable
2012-07-01T07:31:00.000Z	wolfgang_		Actionparsnip, no
2012-07-01T07:31:00.000Z	wolfgang_	r0tha	Didn't see one
2012-07-01T07:32:00.000Z	xDD	wolfgang_	At least right now, I'm trying to figure out why I can't ssh when I change the port (though I'll probably turn that on once this is worked out).
