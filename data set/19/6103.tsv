2008-03-12T10:07:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	xb3rt, if you have an old hotmail account, you still can.  Assuming you got grandfathered in.
2008-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	It shouldn't.  Do you get an error with the message about them being ignored?
2008-09-22T06:43:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	no. It's just something I notice when I do it in Yakuake/Terminal and type "sudo apt-get update"
2008-09-22T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	can you pastebin the output you get from that command?
2008-09-22T06:43:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	give me two minutes.
2008-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	cannot use pastebin. Too many URLs with Terminal reading out the URLs.
2008-09-22T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	sudo apt-get update > ~/Desktop/output.txt
2008-09-22T06:47:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	want me to email this to you?
2008-09-22T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	no, pastebin it
2008-09-22T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	http://paste.ubuntu.com/

2008-09-22T06:49:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	The Igns are worrying you?
2008-09-22T06:49:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	they are a little. I notice some of them goto Sources/Translation and others...
2008-09-22T06:51:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	no, you shouldn't be worried.  You'll get big error messages (that will be obvious errors) if somethigns wrong
2008-09-22T06:53:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	can you help me with another problem?
2008-09-22T06:53:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	Feel free to ask (the channel), we have no idea if I can answer it.
2008-09-22T07:00:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	how can I get my pc to list all of my hardware (like lspci)?
2008-09-22T07:00:00.000Z	Flannel	DaemonLee	lspci and lsusb
2008-09-22T07:00:00.000Z	DaemonLee	Flannel	thanks. I'm probably just going to put my problem on the Forums.
