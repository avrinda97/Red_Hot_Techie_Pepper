2010-03-03T19:57:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		I think I have forgotten the semantics of the +w flag for the group when it comes to directories. If the +w flag is set for a directory, then any member belonging to the group should be able to write to the directory right?
2010-03-03T19:57:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		However I find that any user of the group cannot write to the directory
2010-03-03T19:57:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		aaah
2010-03-03T19:57:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		hmm
2010-03-03T19:58:00.000Z	MrMarkie	bgoldsmith	Does the family group have the execute flag for the directory?
2010-03-03T19:58:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		why is that?
2010-03-03T19:58:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		no it does not.
2010-03-03T19:58:00.000Z	MrMarkie	bgoldsmith	execute-flag is used to permit browsing on directories
2010-03-03T19:59:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		ah okay! I think I got it. thanks everyone :)
2010-03-03T20:00:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		er, I have set drwxrwxr-x for the shared directory
2010-03-03T20:01:00.000Z	MrMarkie	bgoldsmith	still no cigarr?
2010-03-03T20:01:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		no luck :(
2010-03-03T20:02:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		drwxrwxr-x  2 root   family  4096 2010-03-04 00:01 data
2010-03-03T20:02:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		and I belong to the family group
2010-03-03T20:02:00.000Z	MrMarkie	bgoldsmith	Thats odd...
2010-03-03T20:03:00.000Z	bgoldsmith		and I cant move stuff from /home/myhome to /home/data which has  drwxrwxr-x
2010-03-03T20:06:00.000Z	bgoldsmith	MrMarkie	This is funny. Would it have something to do with AppArmor or something ?
2010-03-03T20:07:00.000Z	MrMarkie	bgoldsmith	not sure.... I'm not well versed in the workings of apparmor
2010-03-03T20:10:00.000Z	bgoldsmith	MrMarkie	okay ... thanks! Ill try some more stuff to see if it works
