2009-12-31T18:17:00.000Z	MoonShadow		Hi, I have a problem with a freshly set-up ubuntu 9.04 server
2009-12-31T18:17:00.000Z	MoonShadow		after I log in it runs fine for some time and then jsut freezes
2009-12-31T18:18:00.000Z	[S|G]	MoonShadow	any error messages on /var/log/messages ?
2009-12-31T18:18:00.000Z	MoonShadow		If it happens to freeze while I'm typing something, it tells me <1>BUG: unable to handle kernel
2009-12-31T18:18:00.000Z	MoonShadow		I checket the syslog
2009-12-31T18:18:00.000Z	MoonShadow		but I didn't know about var/log/messages, I'll have a look thanks
2009-12-31T18:23:00.000Z	MoonShadow		Well, [S|G], I got as far as "could not find map file" when it froze again
2009-12-31T18:24:00.000Z	MoonShadow		I've gogoled that but I only find threads from people compiling their own kernels
2009-12-31T18:25:00.000Z	[S|G]	MoonShadow	you said it was 9.04, right?
2009-12-31T18:26:00.000Z	MoonShadow		yes
2009-12-31T18:26:00.000Z	MoonShadow		I downloaded when it came out and kept the cd
2009-12-31T18:26:00.000Z	MoonShadow		installed from that
2009-12-31T18:26:00.000Z	[S|G]	MoonShadow	is it fully updated?
2009-12-31T18:26:00.000Z	MoonShadow		I just installed that Image I had, but told it to get security updates
2009-12-31T18:26:00.000Z	MoonShadow		I imagine sudo apt-get update wouldn't do because of freezing
2009-12-31T18:27:00.000Z	MoonShadow		but I can give it a shot
2009-12-31T18:27:00.000Z	[S|G]		I found this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/250189
2009-12-31T18:27:00.000Z	[S|G]	MoonShadow	not sure if thats the same you're experiencing, but updating might help if you can do it
2009-12-31T18:29:00.000Z	MoonShadow	[S|G]	surprisingly update worked, but it doesen't look like he actually installed anything
