2007-02-19T06:59:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	you're running from the live cd?
2007-02-19T06:59:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	how are you installing
2007-02-19T07:00:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	is that what you're trying to do when you get the kernel panick?
2007-02-19T07:00:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 I wonder if you didn't get a bad download.
2007-02-19T07:01:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 from the ubuntu mirrors?
2007-02-19T07:01:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 have you tried a different disk?
2007-02-19T07:02:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 right.  I meant did you try burning to a different disk?
2007-02-19T07:03:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 4 different disks?
2007-02-19T07:03:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 I'm not trying to ask the same question over and over, really.
2007-02-19T07:04:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 It sounds like a bad download, or a bad image, but I've never gotten a bad image from the ubuntu mirrors.
2007-02-19T07:06:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 6.10 hasn't done this for many people, either.  Out of curiosity, is it a torrent or the full iso?
2007-02-19T07:07:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 if you install 6.06 back on, you can sudo apt-get install dist upgrade to 6.10 and it should work fine.
2007-02-19T07:07:00.000Z	jdiggidy	freakshow	 sorry, I gave the wrong command.  I think it's apt-get dist upgrade, no install.
