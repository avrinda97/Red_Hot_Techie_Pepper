2012-01-07T00:26:00.000Z	|Anthony|		wtf... i have compiz running on a dual x screen setup (nvidia binary) after many-a-headache but i lost my panel on my main screen. Also desktop cube breaks compiz
2012-01-07T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	tone down the lanaguage
2012-01-22T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	I'm not aware of a "mouse service"
2012-01-22T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	the mouse is just part of the xorg display
2012-01-22T21:17:00.000Z	|Anthony|	ikonia	how do i reload a mouse cursor theme?
2012-01-22T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	change theme and change back
2012-01-22T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	then don't quote it if a.) you don't believe it b.) don't know if it's true
2012-01-22T21:25:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	not if it's nonsense and you don't believe it yourself
2012-01-22T21:25:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	giving wrong/miss-leading information is just as unhelpful as not giving a warning for something
2012-01-22T21:27:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	there maybe a .tmp version of the file
2012-01-22T21:27:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	in addition to the existing version
2012-01-22T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	that is not file corruption
2012-01-22T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	nothing is corrupted
2012-02-12T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	there isn't a "mouse driver"
2012-02-12T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	certainly not in the way I think you mean
2012-02-12T23:37:00.000Z	|Anthony|	ikonia	i want to reload mouse driver/services
2012-02-12T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	who by ? for what reason ?
2012-02-12T23:38:00.000Z	|Anthony|	ikonia	my pointer icon is glitching out. logging out/in resets it so it doesn't glitch (until it starts glitching again)
2012-02-12T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	|Anthony|	the xorg application is what controls your mouse, so you can't restart the "mouse" component as it's part of X, you need to restart X (logging in/out)
