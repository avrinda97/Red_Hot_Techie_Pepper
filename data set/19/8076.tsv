2007-05-06T16:21:00.000Z	nonlinear		can you guys guve me your opinion on my partitioning schems that i'm gonna do in like 2 hours?
2007-05-06T16:22:00.000Z	nonlinear		yeap
2007-05-06T16:22:00.000Z	nonlinear		first of all, this is a pentium 5 at 1.73, 1.5 gb ram, single 100 gig hd
2007-05-06T16:22:00.000Z	nonlinear		toshiba laptop
2007-05-06T16:23:00.000Z	nonlinear		my first question is, is 1gb big enough swap for linux on this system?  just using it for web, personal stuff, etc.
2007-05-06T16:24:00.000Z	nonlinear		really?  i thought the std. was ram*1.5 or ram *2
2007-05-06T16:24:00.000Z	uniconformist	nonlinear	swap is used for old hardware.
2007-05-06T16:24:00.000Z	nonlinear		oh, it's not like pagingfile
2007-05-06T16:25:00.000Z	nonlinear		i thought it was virtual ramm... sorry
2007-05-06T16:25:00.000Z	uniconformist		actually swap is important if you don't have enough RAM.  swap can be important when services take up a lot of RAM.
2007-05-06T16:25:00.000Z	nonlinear		oh, i'm getting different ansers here lol
2007-05-06T16:25:00.000Z	nonlinear		anyhow, is 1gb enough for linux, since i have a lot of ram and not doing anything intensive
2007-05-06T16:26:00.000Z	nonlinear	stittel	 cool, that''s what i figured, just wanted to check before i partition
2007-05-06T16:26:00.000Z	uniconformist		SWAP is important on servers that eat up a lot of RAM.
2007-05-06T16:26:00.000Z	nonlinear		cool, thansk
2007-05-06T16:29:00.000Z	nonlinear		ok, here's my real questoin.... i have a 100gb drive in toshiba laptop, currently with 1 active partition and an extended divided into 3 logical.  it looks like this |xp (12 g)|docs and settings (13.x g)|working fragmented drive (26.48 g)|and 'archive  i have xp on it and need that for data analysis and writing for work (that is priority on this machine).  i also have a large collection of files that goes along with that.
2007-05-06T16:29:00.000Z	nonlinear		shit
2007-05-06T16:29:00.000Z	nonlinear		lol
2007-05-06T16:30:00.000Z	uniconformist	nonlinear	don't complicate your life that way.
