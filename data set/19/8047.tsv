2007-05-12T16:57:00.000Z	defcon		any way to run my windows vista on another partition in ubuntu?
2007-05-12T16:59:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	theoretically the commercial vmware-workstation can do that, but that would require switching between to hardware-profiles if you still want to boot it natively. Far too dangerous (and wasn't vista crippled to not run in VM's BTW?)
2007-05-12T15:16:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	bad idea
2007-05-12T15:17:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	well how can I even though it may be a bad idea
2007-07-31T15:03:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	you're loosing all restricted drivers from the repos if you do so. Know how to get your wifi/video working on your own?
2007-07-31T15:04:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	so give it a try, you can always revert to the stock kernel if you run into trouble
2007-08-05T15:23:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	look at /etc/iftab
2007-08-05T15:23:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	thankyou, im checking
2007-08-05T15:24:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	it looks correct wlan0 mac 00:17:3f:c5:bf:91 arp 1
2007-08-05T15:25:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	correct mac even, could it be my rt73 module reassigning the interface name?
2007-08-05T15:25:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	if not any way to force the interface name to wlan0 instead of wlan1
2007-08-05T15:26:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	strange. /etc/iftab only reason for existance is making sure, *this* doesn't happen. Blamng network-manager is quite popular, zho
2007-08-05T15:26:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	I removed network manager
2007-08-05T15:26:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	i removed nm-applet/network manager because it doesnt detect my card
2007-08-05T15:27:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	I have googled this and I have gotten other things
2007-08-05T15:27:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	wise action, but if iftab looks right, i'm out of ideas
2007-08-05T15:27:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	thankyou for your prompt advice anyways, I appreciate it.
2007-08-05T15:32:00.000Z	stefg	defcon	as a hint: this has something to do with udev. you might want to read through the udev rules
2007-08-05T15:33:00.000Z	defcon	stefg	will do thankyou
