2010-03-27T16:57:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	Grumpy this morning?
2010-03-27T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	no - but you're pointless comments are not helpful to the channel
2010-08-18T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	yes
2010-08-18T02:25:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	Ok thanks
2010-09-14T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	no
2010-10-26T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	every release is stable
2010-10-26T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	every ubuntu release is marked as a stable release.
2010-11-25T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	no, the cd's are mounted dynamically
2010-11-25T21:47:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	ok so that verifies that.Can you think of any other reason this might not work or if its a known issue? Its a feature I REALLY need for an offline machine.
2010-11-25T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	the cd's are not being made correctly ?
2010-11-25T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	faulty cd drive ?
2010-11-25T21:49:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	brand new sata dvdrw drive. I was thinking it may be aptoncd bug but wasnt sure. Is there any other way for me to create a repo cd with some other tool(s) or commands?

2010-11-25T21:53:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	Ok ill try mounting and using on another machine. I have a USB DVDRW for my netbook here Ill try that. I would think though that since I installed Ubuntu with the brand new SATA dvdrw that it should be fine. I guess Ill see.
2010-11-25T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxGuy2009	also maybe a media problem
2010-11-25T23:40:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	I think you were the one I was talking with earlier today about APTonCD discs not working on Lucid? I see what you meant about dynamically mounted CDs now. The system uses /media/<volume-label> format. So I just made a sample disc with APTonCD that just contains GIMP to test out. The discs are labeled by default "APTonCD", so when I insert the disc it gets mounted to "/media/APTonCD". I can add a sources.list entry that reads "de
2010-11-25T23:42:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ikonia	However if I dont have the disc in the system and try to install GIMP from it to test, it doesnt ask me to insert any discs like it used to so it just throws an error that the folder isnt found, of course thats cause the disc wasnt in the system and didnt get dynamically mounted. So how can I get it to work correctly and tell me which APTonCD disc to insert? Do I need to manually make a fstab entry so they dont get mounted dynami
