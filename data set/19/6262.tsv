2008-10-13T04:21:00.000Z	Mickmeister		Does anybody know how I can enable desktop effects? My PC has a graphics card built into the motherboard, and when I run lspci it says that the graphics card is unknown and lists the manafacturer as Intel.
2008-10-13T04:22:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	what happens when you try to turn effects on through System-Preferences-Appearance-Visual Effects?
2008-10-13T04:23:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	well I have 7.04 at the moment, it's a fresh installation and I haven't upgraded to 8.04 yet but when I do System > Preferences > Desktop Effects the screen goes white and then after a few seconds comes back to normal without the effects enabled.
2008-10-13T04:24:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	I think your best bet is to do a fresh installation of 8.04
2008-10-13T04:27:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	you're really making it unnecessarily difficult by trying to get an unsupported old version to work, especially if you want advanced features like 3D effects.
2008-10-13T04:28:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	yes, your graphics card should be fine
2008-10-13T04:28:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	I have reasons for what I am doing. There is a reason I have 7.04.
2008-10-13T04:28:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	okay then stick with it, but get by without effects.
2008-10-13T04:28:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	I am upgrading to 8.04 as we speak.
2008-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	via 7.10?
2008-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	yes.
2008-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	okay, if you succeed, you'll be fine (I think)
2008-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	of course I'll succeed lol
2008-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	don't challenge your fate
2008-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	haha! It should be fine.
2008-10-13T04:31:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	it should be, but if you listen carefully, you'll hear the echo of the squeals of those who have tried and failed
2008-10-13T04:31:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	I have upgraded in this way before.
2008-10-13T04:33:00.000Z	Mickmeister	soundray	you see my hardware was unsupported. Every single Linux distro I would try and install on my new machine would fail during installation with some kind of error message. So Intel made a 7.04 ISO image with the hardware drivers implemented. I burnt the ISO and installed, and that's the reason I'm using 7.04.
2008-10-13T04:34:00.000Z	soundray	Mickmeister	have you tried an intrepid beta yet? I'd be curious how that goes
