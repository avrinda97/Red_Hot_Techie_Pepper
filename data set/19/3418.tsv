2009-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	amigojapan		in a multiuser x server, is there a way I can disable the use of an xterm for all users except administrators?
2009-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 proberly can. but why?
2009-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	I am working on a project that needs that
2009-11-13T22:06:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	I need to disable not only xterm but any program that can let the user run a command
2009-11-13T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 that will be quite a task.. since just launching an icon is technically running a command
2009-11-13T22:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 theres some lockdown tools  and restricted shells you may want to look into
2009-11-13T22:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 or try changeing their default shell. but that may break X/some programs also
2009-11-13T22:07:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	that is why I am using fvwm with my customized settings that has no access to xterm,   but I can think of ways to get arround it
2009-11-13T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 thers always the console also..    With proper security settings users having access to the command line is not a security issue
2009-11-13T22:08:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	it is in my system, since I am charging money to run applications
2009-11-13T22:09:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	I dont want people running applications withought my permission
2009-11-13T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 time to read up/google on restricting shell accounts i guess then. So the users are just doing what exactly? sshing in? running X over xdmcp? vnc?
2009-11-13T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	  theres always chroot jails
2009-11-13T22:10:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	I dont want to disclose all the details of my project, but I think you got the idea
2009-11-13T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 sounds liek a lot of work for very little gain.. but good luck.
2009-11-13T22:10:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	thanx
2009-11-13T22:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 also check out 'rbash' (restricted bash)
2009-11-13T22:12:00.000Z	amigojapan	Dr_Willis	thanx, but I dont want my users to have access to any shell, only to the applications I willk serve them
2009-11-14T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amigojapan	 vncserver here puts a log in .vnc/* for  my setup
