2009-10-22T10:27:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	Odd.  It seems you have no hard drives on your machine.
2009-10-22T10:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	Okay.  Issue the command: fdisk -l /dev/sda
2009-10-22T10:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	How many entries does it print?
2009-10-22T10:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	Not good.
2009-10-22T10:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	You don't have any linux partitions on that drive.
2009-10-22T10:35:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	I think windows may have trashed your linux setup then.
2009-10-22T10:39:00.000Z	dsnyders	Help1	Wubi requres that you boot into windows, then launch ubuntu.
