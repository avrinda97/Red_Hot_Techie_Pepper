2008-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	momal		My bluetooth worked in kubuntu 8.10 RC1 but now doesn't even register in ubuntu 8.10 final.
2008-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	lsusb?
2008-11-03T14:20:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	Its a toshiba satellite a300 built in bluetooth it doens't show up at all with lsusb (the bluetooth does work in vista so its not broken)
2008-11-03T14:20:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	in lspci?
2008-11-03T14:21:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	nope nothing there either
2008-11-03T14:21:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	can you please pastebin them both?
2008-11-03T14:36:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	are you sure?

2008-11-03T14:26:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	that is your bluetooth possibly Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0930:0200 Toshiba Corp. i have a linksys one that identifies itself like so
2008-11-03T14:29:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	I am wondering if its because there is no toshiba or toshiba_acpi modules at the moment anymore. I didn't check if they were in the RC or not. Any ideas on how I can get it work the bluetooth applet for gnome doens't seem to pick up any of my phones
2008-11-03T14:29:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	can you remove every usb device and run lsusb again?
2008-11-03T14:29:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	except the bluetooth dongle
2008-11-03T14:35:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	http://pastebin.ca/1243871 - It seems that toshiba corp is the bluetooth I turned the wireless/bluetooth switch off and it disapeared had to reboot to vista with it on then back to ubuntu to get it to show again
2008-11-03T14:36:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	I am fairly certain if i switch it off it dispears from the list then turning it back on it doesn't work rebooting doesn't bring it back. If i boot vista and activate the bluetooth leave it on then reboot to ubuntu it appears again
2008-11-03T14:37:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	:| thats weird! but how can we tell?
2008-11-03T14:38:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	I was reading something about omnibook but its for toshiba laptops with pheonix bios (I have a different bios something h20) and people had the same problem it only worked when it was activated in vista.
2008-11-03T14:38:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	my guess is its either the wireless or bluetooth.. but my wireless works fine and stops when i turn it off and works fine again when i turn it on.
2008-11-03T14:39:00.000Z	jim_p	momal	does wireless and bluetooth turn on with the same button?
2008-11-03T14:39:00.000Z	momal	jim_p	yeah its just the one switch that disables the wireless and bluetooth at the same time.
