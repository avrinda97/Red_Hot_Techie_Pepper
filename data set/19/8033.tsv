2009-12-15T18:25:00.000Z	perlmonkey		Hi, I'm running a dual core CPU and think I have installed 64-bit LTS OS with SNP kernel..but can anyone confirm a) i'm 64-bit and b) I'm SNP kernel from my uname output: Linux server 2.6.24-19-generic #1 SMP Wed Aug 20 22:56:21 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
2009-12-15T18:26:00.000Z	perlmonkey		:-/
2009-12-15T18:26:00.000Z	perlmonkey		is it dual core?
2009-12-15T18:27:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ok
2009-12-15T18:28:00.000Z	perlmonkey		i see it!
2009-12-15T18:28:00.000Z	perlmonkey		so does that mean the CPU's both cores are enabled in Ubuntu and working?
2009-12-15T18:29:00.000Z	perlmonkey		cool thanks a lot guys
2009-12-15T18:29:00.000Z	perlmonkey		i just need to install 64bit version now to get best performance?
2009-12-15T18:29:00.000Z	perlmonkey		I wasn't sure if it was working or not
2009-12-15T18:30:00.000Z	perlmonkey		will 64bit be a big performance improvement, i was a bit disappointed with this sys as it seemed to run very slow, slower than my old single core
2009-12-15T18:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perlmonkey	 deopends on the task. i find video reencioding much faster
2009-12-15T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perlmonkey	 then use what you want.
2009-12-15T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perlmonkey	 i use 64bit on all my machines now.
2011-03-28T23:40:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Dr_Willis	has explained it better than I did
2011-04-17T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perlmonkey	 lsb_release -a  i think
2011-04-17T02:47:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Dr_Willis	many thanks
2011-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perlmonkey	 you can try mouseing over to where its 'at' and hold down the alt key, click , and hopefully grab the window and move it to the other monitor. :)
2011-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	perlmonkey	 or try right clicking on it in the task manager panel thing, and min/max/move/resize it.
2011-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Dr_Willis	thanks :)
