2005-08-29T12:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	lucas_vignoli	have you looked at the debugging sound page on the wiki?
2005-08-29T12:12:00.000Z	lucas_vignoli	HappyFool	i've looked into another wikipages related to sound, but not this noe
2005-08-29T12:13:00.000Z	lucas_vignoli	HappyFool	Shall i look at it and return here if the errors persists?
2005-08-29T12:14:00.000Z	lucas_vignoli	HappyFool	i thought that topic were for developers.
2005-08-29T12:17:00.000Z	lucas_vignoli	HappyFool	i've certified myself lots of times if the mixer wasn't muted
2005-08-29T12:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	lucas_vignoli	apologies; if you said much to me earlier, i'm afraid i probably missed it
2005-08-29T12:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	lucas_vignoli	ok, so you're certain sound is not muted? And you don't here any sounds at all?
2005-08-29T12:19:00.000Z	lucas_vignoli	HappyFool	don't worry, can i chat with you about something i think it is a bug an UI bug?
