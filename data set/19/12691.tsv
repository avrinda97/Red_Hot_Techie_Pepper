2006-05-23T16:13:00.000Z	watson540		SheriF_WorK<-- no, tell me how you did it :)..i know ubuntu does it, thats how 'usplash' works
2006-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	watson540		the splash screen you see on boot
2006-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	watson540		i think it involves making a certain size bmp and all that though
2006-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	watson540		:(
2006-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	watson540		i gotta go google on how to set up openssh. i installed it but it has no man page!

2006-05-23T16:15:00.000Z	variant	watson540	/etc/init.d/ssh start
2006-05-23T16:16:00.000Z	variant	watson540	yes, its sets up the init script
2006-05-23T16:17:00.000Z	variant	watson540	and installing it should generate all the host keys etc automatically
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	variant	watson540	ssh user@localhost
2006-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	variant	watson540	you might need to reinstall it to generate the host keys (easy way) or use ssh-keygen to make them
2006-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	variant	watson540	nm that then if it works :)_
2006-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	variant	watson540	not really, if its an ip you get from your isp then its up to them
2006-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	variant	watson540	you can use a dynamic ip redirector
2006-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	variant	watson540	exactly
