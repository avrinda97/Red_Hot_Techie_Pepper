2009-10-29T18:14:00.000Z	meeeeee		Hi, I had Ubuntu Hardy and recently I've upgraded to Intrepid and then Jaunty. I was trying to install g++-3.4 in Jaunty today with hardy deb packages, so I ran dpkg -i *.deb on them (gcc-3.4 and it's dependencies) but dpkg returend some dependency errors. now running any app ends with segmentation fault! even init (kernel panic). how can I undo my changes on libc (?) ?

2009-10-29T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	you shouldnt mix release debs, you will get a mess
2009-10-29T18:19:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	I know, how can I undo changes? booting with live cd and what?
2009-10-29T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	use: sudo dpkg -r <package name>
2009-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	listen! it doesn't start up!
2009-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	you will need to use: sudo apt-get -f install at the end to make sure the packages are square
2009-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	can you boot to recovery root console/
2009-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	no
2009-10-29T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	then you will need the live cd
2009-10-29T18:22:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	yeah, and then what should I do?
2009-10-29T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	chroot to the installed system and remove what you installed
2009-10-29T18:23:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	if I chroot it will probably ends up with same situation (running every command recievs segmentation fault).
2009-10-29T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	its worth a shot though
2009-10-29T18:23:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	Yeah, Actually I'm downloading the cd.
2009-10-29T18:24:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	do you know any other way?
2009-10-29T18:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	meeeeee	i cant think of anything else
2009-10-29T18:25:00.000Z	meeeeee	ActionParsnip1	thanks.
