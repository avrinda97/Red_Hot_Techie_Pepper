2008-03-04T01:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	SimplySeth	why not use ruter oriented distributions like ipcop or zeroshell ?
2008-03-04T01:27:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	I tried Mono .. but it didn't reconize my NICs .. zeroshell and ipcop .. will look into it thanks
2009-03-05T02:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	SimplySeth	they usually have -rt on the name
2009-03-05T02:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	SimplySeth	uname -a
2009-03-05T02:38:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	and hence the reason I ask .. not the case this time :)
2009-03-05T02:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	SimplySeth	then it is not realtime
2009-03-05T02:39:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	but I did run the uname command and I do see " PREEMPT "
2009-03-05T02:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	SimplySeth	PREEMT != realtime
2009-03-05T02:40:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	DOH
2009-03-05T02:41:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	hmmm I mght have to re-compile
2009-03-05T02:42:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	 thanks again
2009-03-05T02:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	SimplySeth	i think that ubuntu studio has rt kernels
2009-03-05T02:43:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	just not RT kernels that see both cores :-/
2009-03-05T02:45:00.000Z	SimplySeth	erUSUL	then again .. I think its workin' ! .. I got Jack Runnin' with the RT option :)
