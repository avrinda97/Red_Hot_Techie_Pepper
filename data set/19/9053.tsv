2007-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	so what exactly is happening?
2007-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	when I boot, it says "Missing operating system", I think I have installed grub to the wrong location during the ubuntu install
2007-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	now I want to boot from alternate CD and fix grub somehow
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	grub did not get installed in the proper place.  what drive do you have set as boot?
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	but I don't know how
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	you can use the LIVEcd
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	I have my 300gb Sata drive set as boot
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	i don't have a liveCD, I only have alternate
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	ok what other drives do you have
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	and on which is linux installed
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	I have a 120gb IDE drive
2007-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	Ubuntu is installed on the SATA
2007-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	swap the boot order and try again.
2007-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	so you want me to set the IDE drive to boot instead of the SATA?
2007-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	yes i do;P
2007-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	roger that captain, lemme have a try and i'll get back to you in a couple of mins
2007-04-02T06:30:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	the only options I have in my BIOS are: 1) Disabled 2) Floppy 3) CD/DVD Pioneer 4) WDC SATA HDD 5) BBS-1 Realtek boot agent, there is no IDE drive
2007-04-02T06:30:00.000Z	xtknight	Bonez56	hmmm i dont know
2007-04-02T06:30:00.000Z	Bonez56	xtknight	i just realised that my IDE drive was not set up in the BIOS, lol. i've set it now and I will try and boot from it
