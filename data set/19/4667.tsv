2009-04-12T02:04:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	wins is on both?
2009-04-12T02:03:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	did you add the machine IP and name to the Windows hosts file?
2009-04-12T02:03:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- I did not, but I didn't do that for the primary Ubuntu Samba desktop either. So I'm not sure why it'd matter if I didn't do it.
2009-04-12T02:04:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- wins is NOT on both.
2009-04-12T02:05:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	 you set the netbios name on both?
2009-04-12T02:05:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- netbios is not set on either one.
2009-04-12T02:06:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	set the netbios name, I'm guessing they need to be different since you're running two samba servers, correct?
2009-04-12T02:07:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- wouldnt the netbios name simply be the hostname of each computer?
2009-04-12T02:07:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	nod
2009-04-12T02:07:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- each ubuntu machine is not set with netbios, and each ubuntu machine is named differently, with this beign said why would my main machine work with NO netbios?
2009-04-12T02:08:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	hell if I know :)
2009-05-06T03:57:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	are you rebooting from the command line? or the GUI?
2009-05-06T03:58:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- GUI
2009-05-06T03:58:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- tell me about it
2009-05-06T03:58:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	upload a screenshot to imageshack
2009-05-06T04:02:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	- photobucket aint working for me, it just keeps locking up when I try to upload.
2010-05-09T23:05:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	linux or windows machine?
2010-05-09T23:06:00.000Z	Roasted	mrwes	well both if you know the answer to both, but Im looking for accessing it from another ubuntu machine
2010-05-09T23:06:00.000Z	mrwes	Roasted	when you shared it, did you make it a Windows Share?
