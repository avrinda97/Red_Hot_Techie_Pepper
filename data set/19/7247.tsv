2007-09-30T16:49:00.000Z	Rageon		what program can i use to extract .RAR files?
2007-09-30T16:50:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	unrar
2007-09-30T16:50:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	its in the repos
2007-09-30T16:50:00.000Z	Rageon	shearn89	is unrar-free just as good?
2007-09-30T16:51:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	i think so.
2007-09-30T16:58:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	try just unrar.
2007-09-30T05:01:00.000Z	Rageon	shearn89	its a multi package RAR R01 - R45 .. what command do i use to extract with unrar
2007-09-30T05:03:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	don't know i'm afraid - on windows, i'd just unrar the part01.rar...
2007-09-30T05:03:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	does that work?
2007-09-30T05:04:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	yep. doesn't seem to be an option for extracting partx.rar. I think file-roller is the gui extractor.
2007-09-30T05:06:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	no.
2007-09-30T05:07:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	open a terminal, sudo apt-get install wine.
2007-09-30T05:08:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	it will ask you for a password, just put in your normal user one. Then follow the prompts. It will install.
2007-09-30T05:08:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	but yes, its that easy.
2007-09-30T05:09:00.000Z	Rageon	shearn89	.. im new to ubuntu.. but why is my User Password the same as my SUDO password? is that normal?
2007-09-30T05:09:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	yes, its just to stop you screwing over your system accidentally.
2007-09-30T05:11:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	its cos wine needs admin rights to put stuff in the system folders, and as a normal user, you don't have them. Its just an extra security thing.
2007-09-30T05:15:00.000Z	Rageon	shearn89	It just crashes dude !*(*!@)(!#*)(
2007-09-30T05:20:00.000Z	shearn89	Rageon	i know there's something that copies dvds to mpeg4 format... only for backups of course!
