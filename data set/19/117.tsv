2012-09-09T23:05:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9		If I kill networkManager, will I loose internet? The little f***er is using 100% of one core doing nothing
2012-09-09T23:05:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	there is no need for that language please.
2012-09-09T23:05:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	if you have to star out a word - don't use it
2012-09-09T23:06:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	okay, but what is the answer to my question+
2012-09-09T23:06:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	I didn't read your question as I lost interests as soon as I saw your use of language
2012-09-09T23:06:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	...
2012-09-09T23:06:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	..... means nothing, it's just dots
2012-09-09T23:07:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	depends, mostly if you kill it and re-spawn it it will be fine
2012-09-09T23:07:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	are you using dhcp ?
2012-09-09T23:08:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	you should be able to kill it and respawn it before it re-checks for a lease.
2012-09-09T23:09:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	I managed to start my cpufan, maybe that will cool it down
2012-09-09T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	cpu temperature doesn't make it use more/less cpu
2012-09-09T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	if network manager is using %100 cpu, cooling it won't make it use less
2012-09-09T23:10:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	Since when? Every decent intel chip throttles itself if it is too warm
2012-09-09T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	limiting it's processor scalability is not % utilization
2012-09-09T23:10:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	cpu MHz         : 800.000
2012-09-09T23:11:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	On an 1.8ghz core
2012-09-09T23:11:00.000Z	ikonia	21WAAFEW9	if it's 1mhz or 1000000mhz, network manager shouldn't be using %100
2012-09-09T23:12:00.000Z	21WAAFEW9	ikonia	that is true
