2006-07-10T16:22:00.000Z	animax		any tips on partitioning to install ubuntu? can only format some space for linux
2006-07-10T16:23:00.000Z	animax		i have xp right now on one disk of 80gb, the second of 40 gb is there.
2006-07-10T16:23:00.000Z	animax		40 gb i can at max spare about 20 gb cos the other space has got stuff on it
2006-07-10T16:24:00.000Z	animax		all progs, i earlier had 64bit ububtu but switching to 32bit to make linux (after a while) my main os
2006-07-10T16:25:00.000Z	Sub	animax	youll probably want 10gb and see how it goes.
2006-07-10T16:26:00.000Z	animax	Sub	i cn do that but the thing is they are in fat32 and i cant afford to mess with them cos they have critical stuff
2006-07-10T16:26:00.000Z	Sub	animax	fat32 is safe to resize
2006-07-10T16:27:00.000Z	animax	Sub	Cool then. So my primary partition (for linux) should be say 10 gb? i'm planning to let all else remain fat32 for now. any issues there?
2006-07-10T16:28:00.000Z	Sub	animax	thats fine, make your / partition ext3 if you can, but yes i have all my multimeida partitons as fat32 with no issues.
2006-07-10T16:29:00.000Z	animax	Sub	k, thats just what  want. also what about swap, is it the pagefile of windows? cos on the sites i'm being told to have swap as phys mem x 3
2006-07-10T16:29:00.000Z	Sub	animax	how much memory you got?
2006-07-10T16:29:00.000Z	Sub	animax	i always say match your ram over 1gb
2006-07-10T16:30:00.000Z	Sub	animax	so id have a 1gb swap, i have 1gb memory and i use 1gb with no problems.
2006-07-10T16:30:00.000Z	Sub	animax	altohugh if you want to hibernate youll prob want 1.,5-2x
2006-07-10T16:30:00.000Z	animax	Sub	so does linux use swap inside that 10 gb partition or i have to create another swap separately
2006-07-10T16:32:00.000Z	Sub	animax	if you want to do alot of rendering and shit, maybe 2gb swap could be beneficial.
2006-07-10T16:32:00.000Z	animax	Sub	K
2006-07-10T16:32:00.000Z	Sub	animax	make sure you get the right drivers for your 3d card if you want to use blender etc.
2006-07-10T16:33:00.000Z	animax	Sub	yep, if i can get nvidia for 64 bit, 32 shouldnt be an issue :/
