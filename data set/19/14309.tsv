2005-02-27T12:24:00.000Z	OmniColos		hmm anyone using network-manager?
2005-02-27T12:25:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	I am.
2005-02-27T12:27:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	Do you mean wireless-tools?
2005-02-27T12:28:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	Install libiw-dev.  You need to be using hoary to build the cvs, by the way.
2005-02-27T12:29:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	It isn't too hard to get netapplet going in warty.  Do you want to try that?
2005-02-27T12:30:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	Not the newer cvs, no.  The last release probably would, though.
2005-02-27T12:32:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	OK.  Do you have the essid?
2005-02-27T12:33:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	OK, you can run "sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid yournetwork" where wlan0 is your wireless card
2005-02-27T12:35:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	No.  Run iwconfig and see which interface has wireless extensions.
2005-02-27T12:38:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	That will assign the essid.  If there is wep, let me know.  Otherwise, just run "sudo dhclient eth1"
2005-02-27T12:42:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	They're supported, but I've never used them.  :/  I know NetworkManager is going to support them soon, too.
2005-02-27T12:42:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	Good luck.
2005-02-27T12:43:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	No.  I'm on a Dell, unfortunately.
2005-02-27T12:43:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	But NetworkManager rocks.
2005-02-27T12:46:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	It's just bulky, ugly, and loud.
2005-02-27T12:49:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	So ubuntu seems to work well on that iBook?  How about suspend and such?  I ask because I have a friend with the same machine.
2005-02-27T12:50:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	Hmmm ... you might have udma disabled.
2005-02-27T12:51:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	sudo hdparm -i /dev/hda
2005-02-27T12:54:00.000Z	ficusplanet	OmniColos	Try the same command on /dev/hdc
