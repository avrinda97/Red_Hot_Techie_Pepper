2005-09-18T16:22:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-		hmm lsuactiafner I dont know I just know that when I ran one game in gentoo I got 280+ FPS and when I run it in ubuntu I get 90ish
2005-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	cevizoglu	SlicerDicer-	why do you need 280fps?  The human eye works at 24fps, iirc
2005-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	it tests my fps on my system
2005-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	its a game it does not lie
2005-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	cevizoglu	SlicerDicer-	no, I read above just now  :P
2005-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	use your brain though if one game has that much of a performance drop imagine how much every other game has that gets less FPS... come to that conclusion some games outright do not play that did before and some are just unplayable
2005-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	cevizoglu	SlicerDicer-	I never use my brain
2005-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	I was trying to see if I could get a solution and you ask why do I need that many FPS its not that I need that many its my benchmark I dont use glxgears to benchmark I use a game
2005-09-18T16:30:00.000Z	cevizoglu	SlicerDicer-	since I was not familiar with what app was giving you 90fps, it would have made more sense to say "Halo gives me 5fps", or  "Half-Life2 gives me 3fps", since 90fps is obviously enough
2005-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	how the hell can I give you that fps for any other games when they dont work at all?
2005-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	I totally lack 3D acceleration did you miss that?
2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	hehe sorry I thought you knew :)
2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	shit man my gentoo box running a 4800SE with 2700+ AMD outpreforms this box 3500+ AMD64 with a 5900XT
2005-09-18T16:33:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	2+2 does not = 5 on that one haha
2005-09-18T16:33:00.000Z	cevizoglu	SlicerDicer-	I haven't taken the cedega plunge yet as my primary pc is a powerbook running ubuntu  :)
2005-09-18T16:34:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	:)
2005-09-18T16:49:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	there :) nobody can mistake that for something else hehe
2005-09-18T16:49:00.000Z	cevizoglu	SlicerDicer-	:)
2005-09-18T16:52:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	cevizoglu	the only thing I know that even might have bearing on this situation is that when I ran gentoo and this is all I have to go on was that when it did not have 3D acceleration it had to do with not having the needed 32bit X libs
