2010-06-09T08:14:00.000Z	dayrot		OK, so sudo chmod appeared to work, but when I look at the properties of the folder they are the same...? what gives?
2010-06-09T08:14:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Can you post the terminal contents to a pastebin?
2010-06-09T08:17:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Can you tell me what "ls -ld Music" says?
2010-06-09T08:19:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	o+rX should work, though.  Out of curiousity try sudo chmod 705 Music
2010-06-09T08:20:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	AH
2010-06-09T08:20:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	You cannot change permissions of an ntfs volume.
2010-06-09T08:20:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Since they are not unix permissions, what you want to do it change how you mount it.
2010-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Show me the command you used to mount it.
2010-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	I happen to have an NTFS volume from another system, let me take a peek.
2010-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Can you show me (via pastebin) the output of 'mount' in a terminal?
2010-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Mine defaulted to using ntfs-3g with 'allow_other' option
2010-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	No problem, just type 'mount' to get a snapshot of what is currently mounted.
2010-06-09T08:23:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	Really just the line with Music (or whatever) is fine.
2010-06-09T08:25:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	So basically, because it's using fuse/ntfs-3g the filesystem permissions you see are just for compatability.
2010-06-09T08:25:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	For example, I am able to read/write to my ntfs volume as my user, even though they all show rwx------ in ls -l.
2010-06-09T08:25:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	You should be as well?
2010-06-09T08:27:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	 There are so many layers of abstractions here, you're trying to mount an NTFS volume and share it via Samba? (to Windows systems)
2010-06-09T08:27:00.000Z	skreet	dayrot	So, how are you trying to share it.  Right click > 'Sharing Options'?
2010-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	dayrot	skreet	so I'm looking at fstab and trying to figure this out, but you were saying something about it being mounted with fuse something? I looked that up and found it's some virtual filesystem, but honestly that stuff is a bit over my head at the moment. Do you think I just need to mount the drive in a different way to get it to work properly?
