2005-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	Stark		What does gtk-WARNING mean?
2005-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	cafuego	Stark	Generally means you can ignore whatever follows.
2005-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	Stark		Well, I'm trying to start ubuntu for the first time, and that's what it gave me
2005-09-17T06:56:00.000Z	Stark	cafuego	I'm trying to start ubuntu, but it crashes when it tries to load the x-server thing
2005-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	Stark		Could someone please help me, I can't even get ubuntu to run
2005-09-17T06:58:00.000Z	Stark		It crashes when it tries to start GNOME, and I trie to type x-session-manager, and it gives me an error
2005-09-17T06:59:00.000Z	Stark		It tells me gtk-WARNING **: cannoty open display
2005-09-17T06:59:00.000Z	cafuego	Stark	Ah, X isn't running.
2005-09-17T06:59:00.000Z	Stark		I didn't try that one, I'll try it (I'm new to linux)
2005-09-17T07:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Stark	To start gnome, run 'startx'.
2005-09-17T07:00:00.000Z	Stark		I'm running off the live disc to see if it'll work first, and I've used the default install
2005-09-17T07:01:00.000Z	Stark		I tried that, and it gave me a bunch of errors about not finding framebuffers, and tells me to look at a log file
2005-09-17T07:02:00.000Z	cafuego		Stop it you guys, he'll explode.
2005-09-17T07:02:00.000Z	Stark		I'm using an Nvidia card, if that helps
2005-09-17T07:02:00.000Z	Stark		what  is the problem with Nvidia cards?
2005-09-17T07:02:00.000Z	cafuego	Stark	Nothing, it's their owners ;-)
2005-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	Stark		I can't start GNOME, though
2005-09-17T07:05:00.000Z	Stark		Is there any way to enable NVidia drivers purely through the console?
2005-09-17T07:05:00.000Z	cafuego	Stark	Sure.
