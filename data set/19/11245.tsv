2006-03-05T06:39:00.000Z	callan_		I'm having some trouble with xorg and mplayer, i need to enable xv badly but I can't figure out how to.
2006-03-05T06:39:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	what happens if you run mplayer with -vo xv  ?
2006-03-05T06:40:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device.
2006-03-05T06:40:00.000Z	callan_		Same as in gmplayer.
2006-03-05T06:41:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	does "ps auwx|grep mplayer" show anything? sometimes one can get stuck and hodl the xv port open
2006-03-05T06:41:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	also you might want to check that "xvinfo" outputs something - ie that you have Xv available
2006-03-05T06:41:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	No nothing. And xvinfo says no asapters present.
2006-03-05T06:42:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	aha. what graphics card do you have?
2006-03-05T06:42:00.000Z	callan_		It worked fine in a regular ubuntu install, but now I'm trying a server install with xubuntu-desktop, and it isn't now.
2006-03-05T06:42:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	Uh... ATI Rage 128 I think.
2006-03-05T06:43:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	I'd check out which driver X is using, you might be in VESA or something
2006-03-05T06:43:00.000Z	callan_		Norfosomo: I realise that, but I wanted a clean install.
2006-03-05T06:44:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	I know I'm using vesa, I tried ati but it badly screws up resolutions and such.
2006-03-05T06:45:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	well vesa isn't going to do Xv, so you'll need to use something else. I'm not familiar with ATi cards though. Any idea what you were using before?
2006-03-05T06:45:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	No, not sure, is there a list I can look at, or maybe the apm driver supports xv?
2006-03-05T06:45:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	apm == advanced power management, so no.
2006-03-05T06:46:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	So apm will provide nothing that vesa won't? Not even some extra apm support or something? :S
2006-03-05T06:47:00.000Z	Ng	callan_	I've never seen the apm support load properly
2006-03-05T06:47:00.000Z	callan_	Ng	Well ok but any idea if there's a list I can look at?
