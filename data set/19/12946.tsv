2005-07-23T12:39:00.000Z	shawarma		Hi! There's some sort of problem with liba52 and mplayer... Does anyone know what causes this? (To reproduce: try playing almost any DVD with the mplayer from multiverse)
2005-07-23T05:27:00.000Z	shawarma		My gaim doesn't go into the foreground when someone writes to me... Is this a known issue or am I the only one?
2005-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	its not an issue, its expected behaviour
2005-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	Oh, I've configured it to do so, but it still doesn't.
2005-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	its supposed to be more user friendly
2005-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	What? How am I supposed to know that I have new messages?
2005-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	so Gnome says. But making that happen before they got the URGENT visual cue working was stupid
2005-07-23T05:29:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	I have a hacked libwnck which allows my panel to blink and thus show me new messages :D
2005-07-23T05:29:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	There's a conf option to make it jump to the foreground... Is that what they disabled?
2005-07-23T05:29:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	So that no matter if it's enabled or not, it doesn't do anything?
2005-07-23T05:30:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	see this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=39776&highlight=GAIM
2005-07-23T05:31:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	yeah, Gnome basically stopped all applications being able to do that
2005-07-23T05:31:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	That must the stupidest thing they've done yet, and that's saying a lot!
2005-07-23T05:32:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	The real issue is a window taking your cursor focus when you get a message, so they fucked up and just make it not possible for a window to do anything :/
2005-07-23T05:32:00.000Z	Davey	shawarma	I'm sure they'll get closer to that goal, but for now, that libwnck patch is great :D
2005-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	Hey, it sends it to the foregound. Excellent.
2005-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	Sometimes the gnome folks are asshats.
2005-07-23T05:35:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	Seriously.
2005-07-23T05:35:00.000Z	shawarma	Davey	Thanks for your help!
