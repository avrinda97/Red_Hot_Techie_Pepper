2011-03-12T03:08:00.000Z	WXZ		does anyone know a table/spreadsheet editor where you can put a table inside a cell?
2011-03-12T03:08:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	HTML!? :D
2011-03-12T03:08:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	would I have to write it myself?
2011-03-12T03:09:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	there are some wysiwyg editors out there
2011-03-12T03:10:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	so basically yes, I'll have to modify code
2011-03-12T03:10:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	sorry didn't follow, modify which code?
2011-03-12T03:10:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	wysiswyg editor code
2011-03-12T03:11:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	what's the goal with table inside table? Xibit style? :P
2011-03-12T03:11:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	for storing arrays, say you have a last name and you want the cell beside that last name to contain all the names of the members
2011-03-12T03:12:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	am not following you but ok...
2011-03-12T03:14:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	say I have a column, with a list of last names (corresponding to families); and beside each last name I want all the first names of the people in that family, I can ofcourse just seperate each first name with a space
2011-03-12T03:14:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	but then, what if I want beside each first name the "family member type", i.e mother, father, daughter, son, pet etc.
2011-03-12T03:14:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	I can ofcourse do sally, daughter
2011-03-12T03:15:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	I wish I could do sally as well :D
2011-03-12T03:15:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	sally, daughter \n rob, father \n james, son etc.
2011-03-12T03:15:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	but as you can already tell, that gets really, really messy
2011-03-12T03:16:00.000Z	MeanEYE	WXZ	yeah but why not make a table with all those values
2011-03-12T03:17:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	needs to be dynamic, I need to be able to add rows and tables on the flow and format them too
2011-03-12T03:17:00.000Z	WXZ	MeanEYE	and it'll take wayyyyy too much time without a GUI
