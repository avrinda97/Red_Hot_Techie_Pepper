2005-03-17T17:30:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 tho i do run apps thru ssh
2005-03-17T17:31:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 including the gui apps
2005-03-17T13:20:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	try doinf a ssh -Y -l yournick then.you.ip

2005-03-17T13:23:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 no you shouldent see that
2005-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 do you have the ssh server set up on that bax
2005-03-17T13:25:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 then make shure the ssh server is installed on that box
2005-03-17T13:26:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 another way is enable the xdmcp in the gdm and use tsclient to connect to it like you would and get a gdm login
2005-03-17T13:27:00.000Z	zenrox	cwillu	 just an idea
