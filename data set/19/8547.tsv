2007-07-24T07:53:00.000Z	rdz		hi all. is there some way to control the cpu fan under ubuntu? i am on an asus w1000 machine
2007-07-24T07:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	rdz	Yes there is. Google using the catchwords ACPI, fan, speed.
2007-07-24T07:55:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	i am googling exactly these words.. but no result yet
2007-07-24T07:55:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	did you manage to control it?
2007-07-24T07:55:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	or why do you know, that it is possible with acpi?
2007-07-24T07:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	rdz	Yes I did. It works fine with me.
2007-07-24T07:56:00.000Z	bullgard4	rdz	Because I have done so.
2007-07-24T07:57:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	does it work like echo "speed somevalue" > /proc/acpi/...=?
2007-07-24T07:57:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	can you tell me  a bit more about how to do it=
2007-07-24T07:58:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	anyway, it is good to hear, that it is possible
2007-07-24T07:59:00.000Z	bullgard4	rdz	This is one possibility. But not the safest. -- I could tell you more but the matter is delicate because you may destroy your computer if done wrongly. Iwould advise you first to read a bit about ACPI basics.
2007-07-24T08:00:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	please tell me anyway
2007-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	i am already monitoring the cpu temperature...i don't think it is dangerous for me
2007-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	so please tell me anyway how to do it
2007-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	what manufacturer are you on? i mean your computer?
2007-07-24T08:04:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	are you stilll around?
2007-07-24T08:08:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	still around?
2007-07-24T08:09:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	please don't bait me with some partial info in order to disappear afterwards...
2007-07-24T08:13:00.000Z	rdz	bullgard4	are you around?
