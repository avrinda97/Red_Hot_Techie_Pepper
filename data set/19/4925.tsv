2008-10-09T06:34:00.000Z	[mors]		after the initial menu  I select "install ubuntu" and after some 5 seconds a console on initramfs pops up and nothing more happens
2008-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	[mors]		cat /casper.logs shows "/init: /init: 1: cannot open /dev/fd0: No suh device or address" "Unable to find a medium containing a live file system"
2008-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	_Zeus_	[mors]	I assume you actually have a floppy drive?
2008-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	_Zeus_	[mors]	so the problem is?
2008-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	[mors]	_Zeus_	I'll quote me from the beginning
2008-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	_Zeus_	[mors]	ty
2008-10-09T06:39:00.000Z	_Zeus_	[mors]	so, have you tried launching the live desktop instead of saying install?
2008-10-09T06:39:00.000Z	[mors]	_Zeus_	yes, same result :/
2008-10-09T06:40:00.000Z	_Zeus_	[mors]	wow... have you set any custom flags before you started it?
2008-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	[mors]	_Zeus_	I'm using default configuration. I don't set any flags. I just select the option from the initial menu
2008-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	_Zeus_	[mors]	ok
2008-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	[mors]	_Zeus_	btw, I'm using the ubuntu-eee iso
