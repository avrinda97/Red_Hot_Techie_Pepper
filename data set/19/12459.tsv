2005-09-09T16:49:00.000Z	brownie17		how do i change permissions on a directory through the terminal?
2005-09-09T16:49:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	chmod
2005-09-09T05:11:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	^^^ to do with that
2005-09-09T05:26:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	ompaul:if this was worth fighting over, then i would probably join in with one of you, but let's just all agree to disagree. becasue i don't like unecesary conflict, and i don'rt want anyone to get banned
2005-09-09T06:21:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	lol!! i think i did that first time i found out about ctrl + alt + backspace
2005-09-09T06:21:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	haha not your fault, my inquisite nature
2005-09-09T06:22:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	i was expecting it to be like control alt delete
2005-09-09T06:22:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	so is there a control + alt + del type replacement thing?
2005-09-09T06:22:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	depends on the window manager...
2005-09-09T06:23:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	i've used gnome for .... 15 mins at most i hate the thing
2005-09-09T06:24:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	really? is KDE really any better!? i remember in FEDORA you cna choose either, but i don't remember there being any realy big differnece, although i only used fedora for 15 mins max when i discovered there was no drivers for my dial up modem
2005-09-09T06:24:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	i prefer kde to gnome.. but kde is a bit too bulky for me
2005-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	what is xfce? i have not really ever heard much about it
2005-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	xfce.org .. check out the screenies
2005-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	is it easy to just switch between gnome and one of the others with just a restart? or is there mass work to switch?
2005-09-09T06:26:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	should be as easy as apt-get install xfce4 and then rebooting and in gdm(i assume your using) choose xfce as the session? i think
2005-09-09T06:27:00.000Z	brownie17	dbzdeath	maybe before i try another desktop enviroment i should actually become a "not complete rookie" at linux in general
2005-09-09T06:28:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	hehe well thats probably wise... unless you got kubuntu instead of ubuntu
2005-09-09T06:29:00.000Z	dbzdeath	brownie17	well you can do apt-get kubuntu-desktop ? or is it kubuntu and it will install kubuntu
