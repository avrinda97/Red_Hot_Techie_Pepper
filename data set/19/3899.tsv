2009-10-01T21:48:00.000Z	fccf	geos64	you will probably need to install restricted drivers for your video card ... Do you know what kind of card you have, as in model number and make
2009-10-01T22:06:00.000Z	fccf	geos64	9.04 , or the prereleased 9.10? there is a big difference
2009-10-01T22:14:00.000Z	fccf	geos64	we cannot help you until we know what kind of hardware you have -

2009-10-01T22:18:00.000Z	fccf	geos64	doesn't tell me much about your video card ... what video card does it have???
