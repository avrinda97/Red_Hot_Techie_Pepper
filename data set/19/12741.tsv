2005-09-15T06:28:00.000Z	Belutz	noob	is it true that centrino is faster than p4 3.2ghz?
2005-09-15T06:28:00.000Z	noob	Belutz	wasnt it the other way around?
2005-09-15T06:29:00.000Z	noob	Belutz	I said the p4 is faster than the centrino, but that the centrino is already quite fast
2005-09-15T06:29:00.000Z	Belutz	noob	i thought centrino is faster, i read it in intel website, but i forgot the link
2005-09-15T06:29:00.000Z	noob	Belutz	which centrino vs which p4 ?
2005-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	Belutz	noob	maybe the p4 is faster because it uses 1gb ram?
2005-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	Belutz	noob	sorry, i forgot which centrino and which p4
2005-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	noob	Belutz	omg
2005-09-15T06:31:00.000Z	noob	Belutz	the centrino is faster than a p4 as the same frequence. but here its 1.7 vs 3.2
2005-09-15T06:31:00.000Z	Belutz	noob	oh ok... i'm clearer now :)
