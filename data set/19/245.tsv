2012-05-27T00:35:00.000Z	prixon`		s there a way to make super+D minimize all windows in 12.04 instead of ctrl+super+d?
2012-05-27T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	could set it as a shortcut in CCSM, however if you have a lot of apps in the unity bar, the one assigned to D will run every time
2012-05-27T00:39:00.000Z	prixon`	ActionParsnip	what do you mean "the one assigned to D"?
2012-05-27T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	if you hold SuperL a bit, you will see characters on the apps, if you have more than 9, it will use letters, one wil be named 'D' if you have a lot
2012-05-27T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	afaik, yes
2012-05-27T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	can you give a pastebin of the output of:   sudo apt-get udpate
2012-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	prixon`	ActionParsnip	here: http://pastebin.com/RhhWXvbz
2012-05-27T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	you see those long hex codes at the bottom of your paste
2012-05-27T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	use those codes on the end of this command: sudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com CODE-HERE-DUDE
2012-05-27T01:01:00.000Z	prixon`	ActionParsnip	the PPAs that I added? they don't relate to the packages I installed
2012-05-27T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	you still need to import the keys or the package system will moan#
2012-05-27T01:03:00.000Z	prixon`	ActionParsnip	I tried it, and that didn't fix the key error
2012-05-27T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	do the PPAs they relate to support Precise?
2012-05-27T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	no Precise there dude: http://ppa.launchpad.net/ferramroberto/java/ubuntu/dists/
2012-05-27T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	ctrl+shift+c/v
2012-05-27T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	which shortcuts?
2012-05-27T01:38:00.000Z	prixon`	ActionParsnip	shortcuts for copy/paste in terminal
2012-05-27T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prixon`	not sure there dude, sorry
