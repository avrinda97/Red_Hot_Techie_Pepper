2005-08-03T05:58:00.000Z	cato_	HrdwrBoB	how do i check my kernel version?
2005-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	cato_	it's not the kernel version it's the version of the kernel module
2005-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	cato_	if you haven't rebooted, do so
2005-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	cato_	it may still haev the old driver loaded
2005-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	cato_	HrdwrBoB	and how can i fix that? And yeah, i have rebooted several times
2005-08-03T06:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	cato_	the easiest way to fix it is to overwrite both locations again
2005-08-03T06:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	cato_	then curse the ground that ATI walks on
2005-08-03T06:00:00.000Z	cato_	HrdwrBoB	:p

2005-08-03T06:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	cato_	both the kernel module and the X driver
2005-08-03T06:01:00.000Z	cato_	HrdwrBoB	and how do i overwrite the kernel module.. to make it compatible with the "new universal ati" installer?
