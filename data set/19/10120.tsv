2008-11-03T10:13:00.000Z	hema		becuase i want to login adminster
2008-11-03T10:15:00.000Z	hema		how to change password to user root
2008-11-03T10:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	by deafult Ubuntu does not have a proper root account like other distros do
2008-11-03T10:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	when you su or sudo you become root, but only for the task you are doing
2008-11-03T10:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	and yes you can change the password for your user account
2008-11-03T10:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	 there is a way to run root for everything pretty much, but this is not a good idea at all
2008-11-03T10:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	security is there for a reason
2008-11-03T10:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	and which folder do you want root access to>
2008-11-03T10:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	yeah you want to run the  GUI as root?
2008-11-03T10:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	 if you run that as root and delete something by mistake you can screw up your system big time
2008-11-03T10:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	 security is  there for a reason, and some of that security is there to stop you the user from doing stupid things to your system
2008-11-03T10:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	yes, but not a very good idea
2008-11-03T10:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	 also to make things a bit more safe doing that you can do it, but only for the folder you want
2008-11-03T10:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	what do you want to do exactly?
2008-11-03T10:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	there has to be a reason you want root for a particualr folder.  and yes  Linux file permissions can be very annoying when your a new user, and it tells you some folder belongs to root and not you, but it's all there for a good reason
2008-11-03T10:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	how long you used Ubuntu?
2008-11-03T10:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	:   see my pm
2008-11-03T10:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hema	 I private messaged you
