2005-10-31T16:49:00.000Z	boogieman		2.6.10-5-386
2005-10-31T16:50:00.000Z	boogieman		i'm looking for something similar to cat /etc/redhat-release
2005-10-31T16:52:00.000Z	boogieman		Now my problem is this: I'm running Ubuntu 5.04 "Hoary Hedgehog" on a NC6120, and got most of the things configured (by default), but my resolution is 1024x768

2005-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	boogieman	nalioth	in my /var/log/Xorg.log i have "(II) I810(0): Not using mode "1152x864" (no mode of this name)
2005-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	nalioth	boogieman	did you uncheck all the unwanted res'?
2005-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	boogieman	nalioth	yes i did, and in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf 1152x864 is the only allowed resolution
2005-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	nalioth	boogieman	but it still loaded you into 1024x768 ?
