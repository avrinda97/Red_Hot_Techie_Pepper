2005-08-05T13:59:00.000Z	psychonate		alright, time to watch Gwar Live from Antarctica and got to sleep
2005-08-05T09:55:00.000Z	psychonate		also, I think some ID games will keep you on black screens if they can't connect to the sound device, but I could be wrong
2005-08-05T09:57:00.000Z	psychonate		ah, should be fine then
2005-08-05T09:58:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	psychonate	u might be correct
2005-08-05T10:10:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	ok, where you able to get back into X fine then?
2005-08-05T10:12:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	did you try the what reka said?
2005-08-05T10:14:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	ALT+CTRL+BACKSPACE didn't work?
2005-08-05T10:16:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	mind doing some experimentation?
2005-08-05T10:16:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	what sound server do you run?
2005-08-05T10:16:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	'ps -e | grep esd'
2005-08-05T10:19:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	excellent. Try doom3 now.
2005-08-05T10:19:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	well, you can restart esd easily once you're done playing with 'esd &'
2005-08-05T10:20:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	so, you have two options:
2005-08-05T10:20:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	either kill esd before you want to play doom3, then start esd afterwards with 'esd &' or look on the forums for a way to make doom3 work with ESD.
2005-08-05T10:21:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	I'm not sure if all the GNOME apps will like that.
2005-08-05T10:21:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	a good solution would be to make a little script to start doom3 for you.
2005-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	what is the command to start doom3? simply 'doom3'?
2005-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	alright, give me a minute. I don't do much scripting, so I'm not sure if this will be good or not heh
2005-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	psychonate	PrimoTurbo	mind if I PM you?
