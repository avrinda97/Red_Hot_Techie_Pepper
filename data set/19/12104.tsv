2006-03-24T16:31:00.000Z	holycow		how does one enable xdmcp in dapper? login setup under system no longer has xdmcp and security tabs?
2006-03-24T16:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	#ubuntu+1 please
2006-04-01T16:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	you forgot the /
2006-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	i always got the opinion of him thinking he is god but i like your way better ;)
2006-04-14T15:31:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	:) indeed, its a common problem amongs programmers
2006-04-15T16:20:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	dude, there is no such thing as ntfs write, please forget at ntfs write
2006-04-15T16:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	as stated before yes dapper should beable to and i was telling him to wait til stable to find out
2006-04-15T16:21:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	or anyone else out there: ntfs projects for writing to that file system are all defunct.  no one is bothering wasting their life trying to reverse engineer something that is complicated, undocumented and changes from release to release
2006-04-15T16:21:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	dapper has ntfs write planned? really? thats a mofo huge project i seriously doubt any intention for such support
2006-04-15T16:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	thats one of the things they were "sopposed to add"
2006-04-15T16:23:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	the only way its going to be added is if someone rips out the win dll and uses some backend to give interaction to the disks.  other than that i dont see it happening at all ... and frankly you cant redistribute windows dlls
2006-04-23T15:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	if that was directed towards me than you need to re-read the irc rules and the bot rules
2006-06-03T16:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	watch your language
2006-06-03T16:21:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	eye
2006-10-04T16:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	with language like that i will
2006-10-04T16:52:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	ah yes ban for a letter sweet
2006-10-04T06:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	again please watch your language
2006-10-04T06:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	holycow	please join #ubuntu-offtopic for that and keep this channel for support
2006-10-04T06:28:00.000Z	holycow	gnomefreak	if you are going to warn me, try spreading the love fairly and warn everyone
