2007-03-06T11:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	rm
2007-03-06T11:44:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	example i want to delete the file that i accidentaly saved inside the folder 'apt' the filename is ubuntu list. I was editing the sources.list
2007-03-06T11:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	you need sudo rm if the file is outside your $HOME directory
2007-03-06T11:46:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	is it like this $ sudo rm /etc/apt/ubuntulist.txt
2007-03-06T11:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	assuming that is the path to the file, yes
2007-03-06T11:48:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	the filename contains a white space "Ubuntu sources.list" should I type it that way?
2007-03-06T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	no - tab-complete it
2007-03-06T11:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	be careful that you are actually deleting the file you mean to delete!
2007-03-06T11:50:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	whew. thanks. I got it deleted
2007-03-06T11:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	heh - I doubt that it was doing any harm actually ( it would be ignored - doesn't mean anything to the system)
2007-03-06T11:51:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	ah ok. thanks anyway
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	i guess you still learnt a couple of tricks in the process :)
2007-03-06T11:53:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	in fact yes.... I was just starting to learn ubuntu. Is there a tutorial where i can learn the basic and advance commands they use in the terminal?
2007-03-06T11:54:00.000Z	kidbuntu	thoreauputic	and its the Linux Operating System that i've used
2007-03-06T11:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	kidbuntu	 try http://tuxfiles.org
