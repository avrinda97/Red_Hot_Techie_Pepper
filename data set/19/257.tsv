2012-05-17T16:51:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	That sounds rather strange... if the system boots at all, it probably isn't your CPU
2012-05-17T16:52:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	Are you sure you closed the installation with success?
2012-05-17T16:56:00.000Z	cgi101	ThePendulum	got any idea whyat it cazn be
2012-05-17T16:56:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	Windows works correctly, completely?
2012-05-17T16:58:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	There is no way to continue the log in?
2012-05-17T16:59:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	It can't be the CPU really... your system wouldn't boot at all, let alone successfully run Windows
2012-05-17T17:00:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	Again... that doesn't matter
2012-05-17T17:01:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	You could try to clock it normally just to see if that may cause the issue
2012-05-17T17:01:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	Explain?
2012-05-17T17:02:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	So Windows refuses to work when you do not overclock your CPU?
2012-05-17T17:02:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	Your language = 'shit'
2012-05-17T17:02:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	I, personally, don't mind. But there are frequently people in this channel who really don't want to hear such words.
2012-05-17T17:03:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	It's virtually impossible to get a blue screen when NOT overclocking, you're either overclocking wrongly or doing something else completely wrong
2012-05-17T17:04:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	I'd recommend resetting your motherboard and clock everything at their defaults
2012-05-17T17:07:00.000Z	ThePendulum	cgi101	More power... kinda is overclocking
