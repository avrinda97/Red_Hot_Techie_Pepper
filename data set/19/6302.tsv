2009-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	nagyv		could someone tell me how the bash command export works? I have two scripts, the first should set many environment variables with export, then the second would like to use them. The first gives no error, but the second still doesn't have the variables set. Any ideas?
2009-02-12T15:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	does the first script run the second script?
2009-02-12T15:27:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	no, should it? can't these variables set globally by export?
2009-02-12T15:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	changing the environment can only affect children of that process
2009-02-12T15:28:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	thx, I'll try that way then
2009-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	at that point, it might as well be all one script
2009-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	yes, I realised it as well :)
2009-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	though you can still export within the script, if the script runs programs that expect certain env variables to be set
2009-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	and is it possible to call the "settings" script from the other scripts (plural now!) to set the environment variable for the main script?
2009-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	exactly, that's what I would like
2009-02-12T15:31:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	isn't that what the export command is for?
2009-02-12T15:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	say i want any program that uses the EDITOR variable to use 'vim'. i can export EDITOR=vim in my .bashrc, and any children of my bash shell will inherit that variable. so when i run crontab, for example (which uses EDITOR), it opens my crontab with vim
2009-02-12T15:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	so by 'global', you probably mean variables that are set in your .bashrc or .xsessionrc
2009-02-12T15:34:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	but then what is the "export" command for? Can't I set ".bashrc level" variables later?
2009-02-12T15:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	if I didn't export EDITOR, crontab in the above example would not receive the value 'vim'
2009-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	I think I understand it now, more or less :)
2009-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	export makes it so that child processes of a certain process can inherit the value of a variable
2009-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	nagyv	prince_jammys	thanks
2009-02-12T15:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nagyv	cool.
