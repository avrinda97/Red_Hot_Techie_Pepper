2006-11-28T13:43:00.000Z	Jinkguns		I'm attempting to access the network samba share mounted by fstab (via //samba.egr.msu.edu/web /media/web cifs domain=egr,username=bfortino,password=dtzo7kalai,rw 0 0), unfortunetly, while the share does mount, I only have read only access. No write access.
2006-11-28T13:44:00.000Z	Jinkguns		drwxr-xr-x 37 root root 0 2006-07-31 10:50 /media/web
2006-11-28T13:45:00.000Z	Jinkguns		heh, it was an old password. :D
2006-11-28T13:45:00.000Z	Jinkguns		better then [censored]  I figured
2006-11-28T13:45:00.000Z	Jinkguns		I think I still use it on a pentium III back home. ;)
2006-11-28T13:45:00.000Z	Jinkguns		Anyway
2006-11-28T13:45:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	you need to specify a umask or uid moun option to allow non root users access
2006-11-28T13:46:00.000Z	Jinkguns	psusi	how would I add that?
2006-11-28T13:46:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	by adding it to the option list you just pasted
2006-11-28T13:46:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	it is mounted read/write... but all the files are owned by root with rw---- permissions
2006-11-28T13:49:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	why are you trying to chown it?
2006-11-28T13:50:00.000Z	Jinkguns	psusi	he told me too. ;)
2006-11-28T13:50:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	no... you were told to add the umask option to the mount parameters
2006-11-28T13:51:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	linux and windows do not understand each other's permissions systems.... so when you mount an smb share, the kernel just has to make up the file's owner and mode... unless you say otherwise in the mount options, that defaults to root and rwx------
2006-11-28T13:52:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	as I said before, to the mount options you pasted earlier
2006-11-28T13:53:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	you put a space between two options, the umask, and the rw
2006-11-28T13:54:00.000Z	Jinkguns	psusi	with , work too?
2006-11-28T13:54:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	yes, each option needs a , between them
2006-11-28T13:54:00.000Z	psusi	Jinkguns	not a space
