2006-11-30T17:18:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	what's a switcher?
2006-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	: so is it possible to connect to that machine's shared folders?
2006-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	on the windows machine you need to get the ip
2006-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	i know the ip address
2006-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	it will tell you in the network properties in the control panel
2006-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	on the linux machine, in konqueror go to     smb://<ip>
2006-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	uh or i guess you use gnome
2006-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	not sure what it is in gnome sorry
2006-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	: i installed smp4k
2006-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	i have no idea what that is
2006-11-30T17:24:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	: http://smb4k.berlios.de
2006-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	: i know that machine's ip address so then do i have to do anything else?
2006-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	probably not
2006-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	why not just use konqueror?
2006-11-30T17:27:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	: i have it
2006-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	: when i type smb://ip-address it returns with nothing i mean no folder is shown
2006-11-30T17:29:00.000Z	JohnFlux	sheriff	hmm, i take it of course that you are sharing folders on the windows machine?
2006-11-30T17:30:00.000Z	sheriff	JohnFlux	yeah i can see those folders on xp but on ubuntu cannot see them
