2011-11-11T06:28:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	do you know the full filename?
2011-11-11T06:28:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	yes, but full name does not work either
2011-11-11T06:29:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	??
2011-11-11T06:30:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	that will give you the path to the file, wherever it is, as long as it's in a hidden directory
2011-11-11T06:31:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	if you're not sure it's in a hidden folder, just delete the .*/
2011-11-11T06:32:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	ls -aR yourfilename
2011-11-11T06:32:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	this will look recursively for the file, even if it's in a hidden folder.
2011-11-11T06:33:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	but do i need to have the full name of the file? can I use placeholders?
2011-11-11T06:33:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	yes, ls can take * and ?
2011-11-11T06:33:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	THX!
2011-11-11T06:36:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	Jordan_U: ls -aR *peaceful* returns error "ls: cannot access peaceful*: No such file or directory"
2011-11-11T06:39:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	try find -iname *peaceful*
2011-11-11T06:39:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	same thing; no feedback at all
2011-11-11T06:40:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	did locate work?
2011-11-11T06:41:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	cant tell as i get no feedback
2011-11-11T06:41:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	peaceful exists, somewhere in the filetree?
2011-11-11T06:46:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	if so, then it's probably not in the ~ folder, you'll have to cd back to / (just do cd /), and do the find again, it'll take a while
2011-11-11T06:49:00.000Z	apwbdjp	nimbiotics	are you trying it from / now?
2011-11-11T06:53:00.000Z	nimbiotics	apwbdjp	last command u gave DID return what I expected; but the file I was looking for is not there, guess it has something to do with the application. THANKS A LOT
