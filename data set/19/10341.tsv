2006-06-23T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	there's a sample assignment in  update-exim4.conf.conf
2006-06-23T11:02:00.000Z	cfrun	nickrud	I don't see anything in my .conf.conf that relates to LOCAL_DELIVERY though :-/
2006-06-23T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	see CFILEMODE='644' ? like that
2006-06-23T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	now, just what the assignment should be is another question :)
2006-06-23T11:03:00.000Z	cfrun	nickrud	No, I'm looking for the option that lets me split mail in to $home/maildir or mbox
2006-06-23T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	maildir delivery, a sec.
2006-06-23T11:05:00.000Z	cfrun	nickrud	Thanks a bunch!
2006-06-23T11:05:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	it's been a while since I set it up, it was fire and forget. a sec
2006-06-23T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	I can't even find the right help yet ;(
2006-06-23T11:10:00.000Z	cfrun	nickrud	heh, well thanks for trying...if you have any input on the Ubuntu dev net, you might suggest they put that in the .conf.conf
2006-06-23T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	I remember now: I used procmail to drop mail into my maildirs, I only had to add my dc_smarthost and set up passwd.client.
2006-06-23T11:12:00.000Z	cfrun	nickrud	D0h.  Well ok thanks again mate
2006-06-23T11:13:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	I'm lazy, easy way forward for me
2006-06-23T11:16:00.000Z	nickrud	cfrun	luck
