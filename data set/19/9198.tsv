2011-08-12T19:34:00.000Z	fede		Hi, I've just installed Ubuntu 11.04, and my firefox crashes for about everything (even with flash uninstalled). libflashplayer.so an libfontconfig.so appear on the reports
2011-08-12T19:35:00.000Z	fede		@Frank I'm having the same problems with Firefox (even with Chromium)
2011-08-12T19:35:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	Frank_: did you run all the updates?  bounce the box when it asked to?
2011-08-12T19:36:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	yes, I've run every updates available.
2011-08-12T19:38:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	Most IRC clients will auto-highlight lines that start with your nick.
2011-08-12T19:40:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	Sadly no.  I've had problems due to firefox before, but not the one you're experiencing. You say it's dying every time you launch firefox, or just when you open a page with flash?
2011-08-12T19:41:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	it launches ok, but crash on random pages, not only the ones with flash. It even crashed at google!
2011-08-12T19:41:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	Umm.  Is the box otherwise stable?
2011-08-12T19:42:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	I think so. I've struggled installing both Nvidia and PCI Wifi drivers. Could that be the problem? A buggy driver?
2011-08-12T19:42:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	I suppose it could be, but wouldn't jump to that quite yet...
2011-08-12T19:43:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	Did you make any alterations, like say, turning off swap?
2011-08-12T19:43:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	mmm, no. But I've installed my custom partitioning set ( 3 partitions: / , /home, swap )
2011-08-12T19:44:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	K.  Make sure swap is indeed being used.
2011-08-12T19:44:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	: how can I check my swap?
2011-08-12T19:45:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	look in /proc/swaps or /proc/meminfo.  Or even just run top
2011-08-12T19:47:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	: my swap (8gb) is not being used, but I guess is because I've installed 4gb ram
2011-08-12T19:48:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	K.  But it's there, which is important.
2011-08-12T19:50:00.000Z	Kyle__	fede	Did you try blowing away (or just moving to a new name) your ~/.mozilla directory ?
2011-08-12T19:50:00.000Z	fede	Kyle__	I'll do that, thanks
