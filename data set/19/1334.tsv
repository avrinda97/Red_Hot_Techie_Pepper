2011-04-08T02:30:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	dont do that
2011-04-08T02:32:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	So how do I use the provided -deb flags, and more importantly, what the hell are those but I can look that up.
2011-04-08T02:33:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	eh what is the problem you are trying to solve
2011-04-08T02:34:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	Laptop boots to black screen, multiple installations so that's not a problem, but funky GPU drivers a likely suspect
2011-04-08T02:34:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	dual gpu laptop i presume?
2011-04-08T02:35:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	it's a Sony Vaio Z, so yeah, fancy "Hybrid Graphics System" and all
2011-04-08T02:36:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	do you see anything at all when you turn on the laptop?
2011-04-08T02:36:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	I installed Ubuntu within windows, so I see the dual boot screen, I chose Ubuntu, it counts down - then black screen\
2011-04-08T02:37:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	k, ill have a looksie on google
2011-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	what vaio Z series do you have?
2011-04-08T02:44:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	 not exactly sure what "series" there are, but VPCZ1190X is the full model name
2011-04-08T02:49:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	from what i can gather it requires some effort to get it working
2011-04-08T02:50:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	http://www.adhocism.net/2010/11/installing-ubuntu-10-10-on-sony-vaio-vpc-z13m9eb/ seems to apply. Not sure if its supported better under the next ubuntu version either
2011-04-08T02:50:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	exciting, I think I can follow that. Is it the dual graphic cards that complicate things?
2011-04-08T02:51:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	well that and the optimus stuff that tries to integrate the use of both gpus at the same time
2011-04-08T02:51:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	the quickest fix is to disable one of the gpus in the bios if thats possible
2011-04-08T02:56:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	No, that's not something I want to do.I take it from reading this that there is no way to get linux onto this with everything working properly. I'm not sure if there is any point in that case.
2011-04-08T02:57:00.000Z	acicula	Konnie	well im not saying it doesnt work, if you follow the steps that page i linked suggests it should work
2011-04-08T02:59:00.000Z	Konnie	acicula	from the comments it seemed that brightness settings don't work as they should, and that I won't be able to switch the GPU at my lesiure... that being said, since I won't be doing any gaming or graphics editing on the Linux boot I guess I won't need the nVidia drivers
