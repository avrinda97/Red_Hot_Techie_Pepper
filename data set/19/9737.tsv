2007-12-03T18:10:00.000Z	andreuu		tried root (hd2,1)   but it says no partition
2007-12-03T18:10:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	how far do you get with grub? does the menu show?
2007-12-03T18:10:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	that doesn't answer my question
2007-12-03T18:11:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	where is your /boot/grub directory?
2007-12-03T18:11:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	either answer what I ask or ask someone else for help
2007-12-03T18:16:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	how many harddisks do you have? hda and hdc only?
2007-12-03T18:18:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	you just said there was hda? so what is it? please be consistent
2007-12-03T18:19:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	answer my questions please
2007-12-03T18:20:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	if it worked, what did you change since then?
2007-12-03T18:23:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	for the last time: how many harddisks. ALL of them please
2007-12-03T18:24:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	it doesn't matter what is hdc or not. grub sees NO hdc
2007-12-03T18:27:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	you lied
2007-12-03T21:06:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	hd0
2007-12-03T21:08:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	wrong
2007-12-03T21:09:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	if your hdc is the only disk in there it's hd0 for BIOS
2007-12-03T21:11:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	since you hcanged your harddisks you migzht have to recreate your grub device.map again as well depending how you install grub
2007-12-03T21:14:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	just fyi, when you add the other harddisks back in you will have to do the grub installation all over again. so put all disks in the way you want it, THEN isntall and configure grub. NOT before
2007-12-03T21:18:00.000Z	wols_	andreuu	only if your boot order in BIOS changes
