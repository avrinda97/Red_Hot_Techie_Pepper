2008-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	manyou		I think anrd0id needs a GUI setup interface.
2008-06-02T12:39:00.000Z	manyou		Sure, I've done it before Sonic132
2008-06-02T12:39:00.000Z	manyou		What's the trouble?
2008-06-02T12:39:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	I have a partition I want to reformat for NTFS so I can install Windows Vista on it. But I can't see to find it in Gparted. I know it's there as I am looking at it right now in the File Browser.
2008-06-02T12:41:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	You know what. I may have solved it.
2008-06-02T12:41:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	It's under /media/disk
2008-06-02T12:42:00.000Z	manyou	Sonic132	your trouble was your NTFS partitons weren't showing up in Linux?
2008-06-02T12:42:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	No. I need to convert my ext3. It's extra. To NTFS so I can reformat it with Vista.
2008-06-02T12:49:00.000Z	manyou	Sonic132	what happened?
2008-06-02T12:50:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	I installed NTFSprogs. Closed Gparted. Tried to reopen it and it doesn't open.
2008-06-02T12:50:00.000Z	manyou	Sonic132	you could try creating a liveusb for gparted so that you can do all your partition work.
2008-06-02T12:50:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	liveusb? wtf?
2008-06-02T12:51:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	So I'd be able to install Vista onto a nonworking partition with that how exactly?
2008-06-02T12:51:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	Oh I think I see.
2008-06-02T12:52:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	How hard is that to set up?
2008-06-02T12:54:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	What's syslinux?
2008-06-02T12:55:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	And this isn't complicated or hard how?
2008-06-02T12:55:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	I don't even know if I have syslinux.
2008-06-02T12:56:00.000Z	Sonic132	manyou	Ok So I got the first program. Going to download syslinux next.
