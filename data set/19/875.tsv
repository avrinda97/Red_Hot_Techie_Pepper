2011-08-02T17:47:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	I would say LXDE is a bit too light for p4, more like for older celerons
2011-08-02T17:47:00.000Z	ionite	GirlyGirl	kde what's it?
2011-08-02T17:50:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	see my pm
2011-08-02T17:52:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	see my pm

2011-08-04T14:59:00.000Z	ionite	GirlyGirl	hi
2011-08-04T14:59:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	It really depends on your likings!
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	It isn't advisable to spend ages deciding on an interface
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	ionite	GirlyGirl	kde sure looks pretty but i'm just afraid it maybe slow compared to XFCE? because i'm running on celeron on my laptop
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	how much ram?
2011-08-04T15:01:00.000Z	ionite	GirlyGirl	512
2011-08-04T15:01:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	Should work, it flies on my Intel Atom, but I have 2Gb Ram, does windows 7 work on that laptop?
2011-08-04T15:02:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	Ram isn't very expensive should be worth it to upgrade ram
2011-08-04T15:03:00.000Z	ionite	GirlyGirl	intel atom runs windows 7 starter pathethically
2011-08-04T15:04:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	Mine runs 7 pro fine
2011-08-04T15:04:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	Like I said before, try a live cd and see
2011-08-04T15:04:00.000Z	ionite	GirlyGirl	atom dual core?
2011-08-04T15:05:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	ionite	No but twin cpu set
