2008-07-06T04:09:00.000Z	fanatixx		elijah, gparted, but it is not recomended that you use it with your partitions mounted.... it is recomended to use it on the liveCD
2008-07-06T04:11:00.000Z	Elijah	fanatixx	i just want to view my partitions is there a gui for gparted?
2008-07-06T04:11:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	i think it's ok if you wont make any change....
2008-07-06T04:12:00.000Z	Elijah	fanatixx	so gparted isnt installed by default? kinda odd
2008-07-06T04:13:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	i've used gparted and it worked for me.... unfortunatelly i don't know any other gui for a partition manager
2008-07-06T04:14:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	i think it's not installed by default to prevent user to do something wrong.... but it is on the Gnome menus in the liveCD
2008-07-06T04:14:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	you may press ALT+F2 and type it
2008-07-06T04:15:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	i dont know if you need to be root/fakeroot to use it
2008-07-06T04:16:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	as ubuntu is a distro focused on the end user, i guess they meant to prevent them to use gparted incorrectelly
2008-07-06T04:16:00.000Z	Elijah	fanatixx	fair enough
2008-07-06T04:17:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	it is used for the swap memory, the virtual memory on your hard disk
2008-07-06T04:18:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	exactly
2008-07-06T04:18:00.000Z	Elijah	fanatixx	thanks
2008-07-06T04:18:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	no problems! glad to help you
2008-07-06T04:18:00.000Z	Elijah	fanatixx	can i adjust that or is that determined on install?
2008-07-06T04:19:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	you may determinate it on the install process... i dont know if you may change it after that... i think someone else in here could tell you more about it
2008-07-06T04:22:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	i think that if you boot with the liveCD you may change it without any problem, but it's something to averiguate....
2008-07-06T04:23:00.000Z	Elijah	fanatixx	so is it already installed on live cd or in the live menu?
2008-07-06T04:24:00.000Z	fanatixx	Elijah	gparted is installed in the Ubuntu LiveCD, but when you install the Ubuntu on your PC, by default gparted is not installed
