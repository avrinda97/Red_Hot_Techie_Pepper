2008-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	chewd		now thyre on the right end
2008-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	chewd		actually disregard that... its not important
2008-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	chewd		just weird
2008-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	chewd		whats bugging me now is, since i did all the updates i cant seem to access my windows boxes shared folders
2008-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	chewd		it works when i boot off the live cd
2008-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	chewd		but when i boot off hdd (fully updated ubuntu) no access to my server
2008-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	chewd		id really like to be able to access my windows network
2008-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	chewd		it doesnt even see the workgroup anymore
2008-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	chewd		worked fine before i updated everything
2008-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	chewd		is there a software firewall somewhere in here?
2008-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	what did you update?
2008-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	there is a firewall (iptables) in the kernel, and there is samba for windows (smb protocol) networking.  the smb.conf file configs your windows workgroup et al
2008-01-18T08:55:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	but it worked on the hdd install until you did a system update off the panel nag applet?
2008-01-18T08:55:00.000Z	chewd	mojo	im not sure... it may not have
2008-01-18T08:57:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	soldats may have a point, i seem to remember having to install samba.  but that was like a couple months ago that i did the gutsy install, so i forget
2008-01-18T08:58:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	though you'd think if the livecd has it installed then the hd install would too
2008-01-18T08:58:00.000Z	chewd	mojo	no kidding
2008-01-18T08:59:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	it might not be called samba on the descriptions there... use synaptic under system/administration
2008-01-18T09:10:00.000Z	mojo	chewd	nice
