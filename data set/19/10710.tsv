2006-05-21T15:27:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg		Can anybody tell me the name of the application that gets run when I select the "networking" gui tool under administration in Ubuntuu? I am not at the machine right now but I want to run it remotely
2006-05-21T15:27:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg		I just have no idea what it is called
2006-05-21T15:28:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	tab completion is your friend;  gnome-<tab><tab><tab> until you see it :)
2006-05-21T15:29:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	cwillu	yep. got it :)
2006-05-21T15:34:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	cwillu	actually that was the wrong one. do you know what the name of the ethernet (or network) device configuration tool is?
2006-05-21T15:38:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	try the other one, there's two that start with gnome-net
2006-05-21T15:40:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	network-admin is the one you're looking for
2006-05-21T15:41:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	(yay 'locate net' :p)
2006-05-21T15:42:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	cwillu	yep. that's it!
2006-06-23T12:57:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	cwillu	it is not the right one
2006-06-23T12:57:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	I kinda figured that :p
2006-06-23T12:56:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	different package
2006-06-23T12:56:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	it's like php_mysql or something
2006-06-23T12:57:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	cwillu	ok... please tell me how I can rememdy this seemingly awful situation... can I just do an apt-get install php_mysql right now and it will add mysql support to the php I already installed?
2006-06-23T12:57:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	assuming that it's the right package, yes
2006-06-23T12:57:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	there is a package like that though that you need
2006-06-23T12:58:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	php5-mysql
2006-06-23T12:58:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	cwillu	E: Couldn't find package php5_mysql
2006-06-23T12:59:00.000Z	cwillu	loquitus_of_borg	- not _
