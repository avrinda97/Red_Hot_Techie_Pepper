2009-08-03T01:21:00.000Z	bastian		hello, I have some problems setting up a static ip with /etc/network/interfaces
2009-08-03T01:21:00.000Z	bastian		anyone willing to help?
2009-08-03T01:22:00.000Z	tritium	bastian	sure, can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file please?
2009-08-03T01:22:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	yes one second
2009-08-03T01:23:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	http://pastebin.com/m69fcb77a
2009-08-03T01:23:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	the wlan0 interface works
2009-08-03T01:23:00.000Z	tritium	bastian	also, note that you can "man interfaces", and "zless /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz" for some guidance.
2009-08-03T01:24:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	actually i am about 100% sure that this configuration should work as it has done in prev. versions.
2009-08-03T01:24:00.000Z	tritium	bastian	why no gateway?
2009-08-03T01:24:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	it's not for internet access or anything... the thing is: the interface doesn't come up correctly with it's static ip on boot
2009-08-03T01:25:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	if I do sudo ifdown etho && sudo ifup eth0 it works
2009-08-03T01:25:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	but i have to do it after every boot
2009-08-03T01:25:00.000Z	tritium	bastian	that shouldn't be the case, with the "auto" stanza
2009-08-03T01:25:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	eth0      no wireless extensions
2009-08-03T01:27:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	i guess it would work with network-manager, but my wlan driver conflicts with nm, therefore i had to uninstall it...
2009-08-03T01:27:00.000Z	tritium	bastian	it should work as you have specified.
2009-08-03T01:28:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	that's what bothers me too... maybe I could force a ifdown and ifup on every boot? in some file...
2009-08-03T01:29:00.000Z	tritium	bastian	technically, that's done too, with /etc/init.d/networking
2009-08-03T01:29:00.000Z	bastian	tritium	ok thanks for your help anyways...
