2012-08-26T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	why not just use your backups..
2012-08-26T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	there are a few
2012-08-26T16:09:00.000Z	stevo871	ActionParsnip	Its been looking for about 15 mins just drawing dots in the terminal screen
2012-08-26T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	why don't you just restore data from backup?
2012-08-26T16:10:00.000Z	stevo871	ActionParsnip	I dont think there is a backup
2012-08-26T16:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	there is only a backup if you make one
2012-08-26T16:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	why did you not make a backup if the data is important to you?
2012-08-26T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	you can maybe use foremost
2012-08-26T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	you have learned the value of backups the hardest way possible
2012-08-26T16:29:00.000Z	stevo871	ActionParsnip	Yes I have, next time will go out and but a spare external one
2012-08-26T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	install foremostin liveCD, it may help. You will need a writable storage t spit the data to
2012-08-26T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	you can install foremost in the ubuntu live desktop
2012-08-26T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	assuming you have web access
2012-08-26T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	cool

2012-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	depends on the size of the partition, the amount of data and the complexity of the data etc
2012-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stevo871	usually its a long while
2012-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	stevo871	ActionParsnip	Cheers, back in a bit then
