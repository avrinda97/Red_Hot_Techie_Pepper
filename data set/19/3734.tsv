2011-01-08T23:17:00.000Z	aneviltrend		hi all - i have a networking question. i have a 5-port switch and i'm trying to set a static ip on my ubuntu box so i can connect to it from my laptop
2011-01-08T23:17:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	sure....
2011-01-08T23:17:00.000Z	aneviltrend		unfortunately my laptop can't ping the ubuntu box
2011-01-08T23:17:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	The laptop and the ubuntu box both must have static IP addresses
2011-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	both of them? okay, i'll try that
2011-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	the laptop is win7, so i'll have to monkey around a bit :)
2011-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	yes, the packets know where the server is, they do not know where the laptop is without a valid IP
2011-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	thanks for the help
2011-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	Just to be clear, what IP does the server have?
2011-01-08T23:19:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	192.168.1.101
2011-01-08T23:19:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	k, what IP does the laptop have?
2011-01-08T23:19:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	it's assigned by dhcp
2011-01-08T23:19:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	Oh well if you have dhcp than that's fine.
2011-01-08T23:19:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	it's one of two interfaces, the other is the wireless
2011-01-08T23:20:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	PM me?
2011-01-08T23:20:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	the weird thing i'm doing is that there's no router in the setup
2011-01-08T23:20:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	you're going to have to lay out the entire network for me to fully understand what's happening.  PM me :)
2011-01-08T23:20:00.000Z	aneviltrend	edbian	sure, i'm a bit of an irc noob so how do i start it?
2011-01-08T23:21:00.000Z	edbian	aneviltrend	every client is different.  Click my name? right click my name?
