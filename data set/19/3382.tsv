2009-09-02T02:26:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	Screaming at us and pounding your fist doesn't stimulate our desire to help you.
2009-09-02T02:27:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	I found a really good link in google, but I'm contemplating giving it to you.
2009-09-02T02:36:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	This sound is fantastic - my only regret is to have bought more bread - now I'm not going to be able to whipe the bowl down! What a shame ..
2009-09-02T02:37:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	As you can tell I've got linux running all over my mind - what do you recommend I eat for desert?
2009-09-02T02:40:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	You will not lose XP from making changes to the boot loader.
2009-09-02T02:42:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	Are you aware that google has a search engine? I'm not sure when it was released but I think gmail is fantastic!
2009-09-02T02:48:00.000Z	djanatyn	cryptopsy	I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking and I won't do it again. Can you help me?
2009-09-02T02:48:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	I could, but I'd rather not enable incorrect behavior.
2009-09-02T02:49:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	More important than getting ubuntu and all this technical mumbo-jumbo working is fixing you to learn how to use it.
2009-09-02T02:50:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	I'm sorry if that sounded overly friendly. I just can't help myself from looking out for my fellow man sometimes.
2009-09-02T02:50:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	But I'd appreciate it if you could help me decide between this Haagendas, or this icecream sandwidth.
2009-09-02T02:50:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	Its the vanilla kind. I don't like the strawberry kind it doesn't taste like an authentic strawberry.
2009-09-02T03:04:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	That error 25 is a feisty one!
2009-09-02T03:06:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	Or you can use lilo instead, maybe you'll get an error with a different number, which may be one you know how to fix.
2009-09-02T03:12:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	Windows XP is a fantastic OS!
2009-09-02T03:32:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	Yes - make sure to pay for the tech-support options - its quite handy!
2009-09-02T03:37:00.000Z	cryptopsy	djanatyn	In the end I ended up having the ice-cream sandwitch. Gotta watch those carbs, hehe!
