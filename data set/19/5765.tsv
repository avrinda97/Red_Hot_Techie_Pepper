2008-05-13T15:44:00.000Z	jrib	remoteCTRL	man date  tells you what they do.  date '+%d' for example
2008-05-13T15:45:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	jrib	yeah that "+" was what i was missing, noone tells you in the manpages gg
2008-05-13T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	remoteCTRL	it does, in the second line :)

2010-05-20T15:11:00.000Z	jrib	remoteCTRL	put it in your drive, done
2010-05-20T15:12:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	jrib	if it was that easy i wouldnt have to ask... justme` that would be mounting the first hadd if it is a ide drive then...
2010-05-20T15:12:00.000Z	jrib	remoteCTRL	it is that easy.  Something is not working correctly if it is not.
2010-05-20T15:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	jrib	that i can see dude, which is why i want to mount it manually as this is actually not so rare that this occurs it would be interesting to know HOW TO
2010-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	jrib	remoteCTRL	do you have an fstab entry related to your cdrom?
2010-05-20T15:16:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	jrib	 sec opls i am just in the middle of rebooting but as i recall nope, i dont and as stated before there is no /media/cdrom /media/cdrom0 as there used to be but lucid nomally mounts cds directly to /media (discussable if thatr is clever but ok...)
2012-03-24T20:43:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	jrib	that is exactly what i was trying to explain to the man
2012-03-24T20:43:00.000Z	jrib	remoteCTRL	yes, I believe that's the proper syntax for a file with a list of paths to exclude
