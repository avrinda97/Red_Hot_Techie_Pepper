2010-03-01T09:35:00.000Z	ryanrhee90		anyone? resetting ubuntu to original settings without killing the OS? :(
2010-03-01T09:36:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	that would be possible, what part is hacked ... the os or the server datum, also what was it serving
2010-03-01T09:37:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	the server is doing a bunch of stuff - DNS, OpenVPN, Apache, mail+imap, LAMP, etc, etc.
2010-03-01T09:39:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	I'd start by backing up everything ... .. Is this a LTS version?
2010-03-01T09:39:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	the OS actually came with a custom kernel. i didn't realize this until i noticed that openvpn wouldn't load any kernel modules. I changed the kernel to the LTS. Basically, this was my first time using Ubuntu so everything on here isn't quite right. Now that I kind of know my way around, Yes, it is an LTS version
2010-03-01T09:39:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	Also, everything has already been backed up.
2010-03-01T09:41:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	I'd wait until the middle of April ... the next LTS is coming out ... everything would be updated, .. then you'd prolly have some fixing to do, but it would be a far cry from a in place reinstallation
2010-03-01T09:42:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	Alright, that sounds fine. However, when I upgrade this coming april, wouldn't I still need to ... 'wipe everything down'? (remove everything & start over)?
2010-03-01T09:44:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	if you upgrade from LTS 8.04 to LTS 10.04, just about every file on the server is going to be replaced, except for your data, essentially cleaning it too, I;d change some passwords, clean up some SQL tables and get the latest DNS data, but other than that, I think you'd be good to go
2010-03-01T09:45:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	so when i upgrade to the next LTS, what would happen to the config files?
2010-03-01T09:47:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	that is what you have to make sure to backup .. some would be replaced, others appended, but you would still have a working environment from which to reconfigure everything
2010-03-01T09:47:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	i'd actually want ALL my config files deleted, if possible. that's essentially what i'm going for here :)
2010-03-01T09:49:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	define config files ... /etc/resolv.conf is a config file, but you'd never want to change it - if you did you would loose networking, same for /etc/network/interfaces ... get my point ...
2010-03-01T09:50:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	oh yeah, haha, sorry. i meant application config files - as in httpd.conf, or php.ini, etc, etc
2010-03-01T09:56:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	for httpd.conf blanking it would be fine, whereas deleting it would be a bad idea, as for php.ini it will be replaced by the next version of php4 or 5 ... apache is a server .. php is a set of libraries that allow for parsing of php data, I don't consider them applications, I consider the webapps that exist within the webroot the application and the infrastructure that allows that to be served is the LAMP stack ... follow?
2010-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	ryanrhee90		hrm. okay. well web apps are independent, i can just remove their directory. I'm talking more like ... apache itself, for example. i'd rather just delete any trace of apache2 on my machine and re-install it using apt-get, cuz i'm almost certain i've hacked it to the point of no return. same with ... mysql. or... shorewall, bind9, etc etc
2010-03-01T10:00:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	hrm... for example, i'm guessing that "apt-get remove apache2" won't delete httpd.conf. if i do apt-get install apache2 after removing, i'm guessing that the configuration files will still be there. true?
2010-03-01T10:02:00.000Z	GeekSquid	ryanrhee90	I don't believe in no return .. but anyway .. if you wanted to truly get rid of the lamp stack (for instance) sudo tasksel remove --purge lamp-server would really get rid of everything, then i'd be just a matter of reinstalling the lamp stack, ... your example is ok, however it doesn't get rid of the configs unless you do sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2 ... follow?
2010-03-01T10:03:00.000Z	ryanrhee90	GeekSquid	Purge! okay. i'll do that. thanks! :)
