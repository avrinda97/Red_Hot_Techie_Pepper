2012-09-20T06:32:00.000Z	minetruly		Hi! This is my first time using IRC. I'm considering switching to Ubuntu. I'm willing to lean computer programming. If you don't mind talking to a total newbie, do any of you have words of wisdom for me?
2012-09-20T06:33:00.000Z	minetruly		Thank you, blackshirt.
2012-09-20T06:34:00.000Z	minetruly		What does "port" mean? (Sorry, I'm such a beginner! I promise I learn quickly.)
2012-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	WeThePeople	minetruly	port for networking in and out of the computer
2012-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	minetruly		What if it's not compatible with something i want to use, or doesn't run well enough with my computer's hardware?
2012-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	minetruly	WeThePeople	thank you, I understand.
2012-09-20T06:35:00.000Z	WeThePeople	minetruly	their are over 65000 ports on the computer
2012-09-20T06:36:00.000Z	minetruly		65000? Why so many? I get the basics like your email goes out one port, or you could specify another....
2012-09-20T06:37:00.000Z	WeThePeople		ok??
2012-09-20T06:37:00.000Z	WeThePeople		whatever
2012-09-20T06:37:00.000Z	minetruly		Thanks crimsonmane. It'll be nice to use it without hassle. But, I really am planning on learning how to program, and dealing with Linux would be as good a place to start as any.
2012-09-20T06:37:00.000Z	minetruly		I'd love to be able to tweak things.
2012-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	minetruly		Also, I'm done tolerating the glitches Windows gives me. I want the ability to get my hands around a problem until I've strangled it.
2012-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	minetruly		And, you know, solved it.
2012-09-20T06:39:00.000Z	minetruly		But with Linux, can't you get in there and manually fix the glitches?
2012-09-20T06:39:00.000Z	minetruly		Parsnip, thank you, Crimsonmane, what's the significance of ports?
2012-09-20T06:40:00.000Z	minetruly		What are Ubuntu's biggest downfalls?
2012-09-20T06:40:00.000Z	minetruly		Haha
2012-09-20T06:40:00.000Z	WeThePeople	minetruly	everything is free
