2006-01-27T08:10:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	what do you think i've been doing for some time now?
2006-01-27T08:10:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	I have no idea
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	well... have you found an answer ?
2006-01-27T08:15:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	OK ?
2006-01-27T08:19:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	i have a specific question on how-to enable mp3 encoding in ffmpeg with ubuntu that is not on the wiki
2006-01-27T08:19:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	thnx anyway
2006-01-27T08:20:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	OK. sorry. I don't understand. are you trying to use libffbmeg via programming ?
2006-01-27T08:20:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	answer
2006-01-27T08:21:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	no i'm resizing an avi for use on pocketpc with ffmpeg, and i think i can get better results encrypting the audio stream in mp3
2006-01-27T08:24:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	you're right... you should run ffmpeg binary and see if it was compiled with --enable-lame
2006-01-27T08:29:00.000Z	sobersabre	emile	are you there ?
2006-01-27T08:35:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	yes?
2006-01-27T08:37:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	it's not compiled with mp3lame, and there's no sources in the repositories
2006-01-27T08:37:00.000Z	emile	sobersabre	i want to follow this walkthrough i just found: http://po-ru.com/diary/fixing-ffmpeg-on-ubuntu/
