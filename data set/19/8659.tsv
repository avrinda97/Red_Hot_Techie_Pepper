2007-04-27T06:51:00.000Z	delire		is it normal for desktop effects to remove window decorations and titlebar?
2007-04-27T06:52:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	nvidia?
2007-04-27T06:52:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	yep
2007-04-27T06:52:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	how did you enable your 3d driver?
2007-04-27T06:53:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	i carried it over from a previous upgrade, nvidia-glx
2007-04-27T06:53:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	you need to run this: sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24
2007-04-27T06:53:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	had you used the restricted manager you wouldn't have had that problem
2007-04-27T06:54:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	cheers, i'll give that a go. will it break my xorg.conf in future upgrades?
2007-04-27T06:55:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	will this get in the way of upgrading xorg in future or is this line added anyway when using restricted-manager?
2007-04-27T06:56:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	your xorg.conf will no longer be auto-updated
2007-04-27T06:56:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	i think i'll do without trying desktop effects in that case.
2007-04-27T06:57:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	you could probably use the restricted manager to enable the driver, even if its installed
2007-04-27T06:57:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	why is that a big deal anyway?
2007-04-27T06:57:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	it already says it is enabled.
2007-04-27T06:58:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	this is not my primary machine. i only really keep it to test code i develop in Debian and to follow the Ubuntu project.
2007-04-27T06:58:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	i want to leave this machine as un-modified by me as possible.
2007-04-27T06:59:00.000Z	crdlb	delire	it's possible that unchecking, rebooting, and rechecking the driver in the restricted manager would enable the lines
2007-04-27T06:59:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	i'm trying that now
2007-04-27T07:07:00.000Z	delire	crdlb	hehe that almost worked. i have window decorations and the cube effect but then both panels flashed wildly and disappeared.
