2012-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	bcuraboy		guys i'm having serious issues to install ubuntu 12.04
2012-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	 whats the matter man?
2012-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	you're better off using 11.10
2012-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	- listen to me man
2012-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	when you're running on only 2GB of ram and 1GHz processor, you're best bet is to get 11.04 on it
2012-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	also, if you want to install it from usb - use Unetbootin
2012-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	not 11.10 - use 11.04
2012-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	likely not going to be ble to run Unity
2012-04-30T03:15:00.000Z	bcuraboy	APoulos	why you suggest 11.04?
2012-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	because 11.10  uses Unity which is a resource hog, 11.04 is easier and uses classic gnome
2012-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	yes, but why would you want to
2012-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	in fact, 11.04 is still widely supported
2012-04-30T03:19:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	thats the great thing about ubuntu - like jfreak53 said, you dont need to upgrade with ubuntu because most programs are supported on most versions of ubuntu, I still see packages for 9.04 supported
2012-04-30T03:22:00.000Z	bcuraboy	APoulos	yeah i can see you
2012-04-30T03:22:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	see, thats better, because now you highlight my name and I can see it easier
2012-04-30T03:26:00.000Z	bcuraboy	APoulos	so which would be the fastier to install on a laptop with that specs??
2012-04-30T03:27:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	well, like I said man, I ran 11.04 - for the longest time, its good, clean, quick and gets the job done.  If you install it onto a cd - set the burn speed to the LOWEST POSSIBLE BURN SPEED to prevent from any errors with the files
2012-04-30T03:28:00.000Z	bcuraboy	APoulos	ok,maybe i'll follow your advice
2012-04-30T03:30:00.000Z	APoulos	bcuraboy	if you're installing from usb, go grab Unetbootin - http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/, then download the ISO - http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ - make sure its the one for your system - 32bit or 64bit - then use Unetbootin to put it on the usb
