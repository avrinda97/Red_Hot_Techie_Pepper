2011-02-03T22:33:00.000Z	jd2320		hi, I'm new to linux and I need help changing my resolution
2011-02-03T22:33:00.000Z	jd2320		Ubuntu doesn't recognise my native resolution
2011-02-03T22:33:00.000Z	jd2320		I think, I already have
2011-02-03T22:34:00.000Z	jd2320		How do I get new nvidia drivers
2011-02-03T22:34:00.000Z	jd2320		Yeah, but my native resolution isn't there
2011-02-03T22:34:00.000Z	jd2320		1440x900
2011-02-03T22:35:00.000Z	jd2320		I've tried xrandr and everything
2011-02-03T22:36:00.000Z	jd2320		Hi, I can't set my native resolution (1440x900) on my pc. It doesn't come up on the nvidia software or the ubuntu software
2011-02-03T22:37:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	probably because the edid is not correctly detected
2011-02-03T22:37:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	notebook or desktop pc?
2011-02-03T22:38:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	that I would like you to answer my question so that I can fix your problem
2011-02-03T22:39:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	what type of monitor, and how is it connected?
2011-02-03T22:40:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	because: the nvidia driver reads out valid resolutions from the monitor EDID. It can't read it if  1) the monitor doesn't provide it 2) the monitor provides a broken one  3) an adapter for the cable or a switch makes it impossible to transfer this data
2011-02-03T22:41:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	please create a nvidia bug report as well  (sudo nvidia-bug-report.sh)  as well, so I can see whether this acutually is the problem (probably it is)
2011-02-03T22:43:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	no
2011-02-03T22:43:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	do never paste into IRC
2011-02-03T22:43:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	use a pastebin service instead
2011-02-03T22:48:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	extract the file created and then upload the content of the text file to a pastebin service you just got links to
2011-02-03T22:51:00.000Z	Fuchs	jd2320	open your file manager, right click on the file, extract. Open the text file as you would open any text file, copy the content  (CTRL+A, CTRL+C), open a browser, go to the pastebin, paste the content, submit, give us the URL resulting
