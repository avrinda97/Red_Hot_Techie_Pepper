2009-04-19T20:00:00.000Z	SockPants		hi all
2009-04-19T20:01:00.000Z	SockPants		how can i make sure when a script runs it runs in bash, and how can i make a script wait for a few seconds before proceding
2009-04-19T20:01:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	use the right shebang  i.e.  #!/bin/bash    # to sleep for 10 seconds,  sleep 10
2009-04-19T20:07:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	how is the program calling your script?
2009-04-19T20:08:00.000Z	SockPants	unop	i don't know. i specify the path to the script in an xml conf file, and it runs it.
2009-04-19T20:09:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	debug your script .. introduce a line that creates a temp file and puts some text in it.    echo "$0 was called" > /tmp/test
2009-04-19T20:09:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	and see if /tmp/test is created
2009-04-19T20:11:00.000Z	SockPants	unop	yep, /tmp/test is created and says the script path was called, yet the file did not move

2009-04-19T20:15:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	sorry,  correction  http://sockpants.pastebay.com/10050
2009-04-19T20:18:00.000Z	SockPants	unop	i put that in, nothing changed
2009-04-19T20:18:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	what's in /tmp/test now?
2009-04-19T20:19:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	have you got /mnt/downloads/stream_rec.ogg open somewhere?
2009-04-19T20:24:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	can you run a command from within your xml config? instead of calling the script?
2009-04-19T20:28:00.000Z	SockPants	unop	nope, i tried that. it'll only call the script.
2009-04-19T20:29:00.000Z	SockPants	unop	i made a script that calls the script with a &, but that didn't help
2009-04-19T20:31:00.000Z	unop	SockPants	ok, try something like this.  http://pastebin.com/d7d87ee93
2009-04-19T20:36:00.000Z	SockPants	unop	no luck. strangely, the logs of the program don't show it waiting for the script to finish before closing the file at all
