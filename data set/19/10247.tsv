2006-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	jarrett		Can someone help me, my nvidia drivers appear to be installed correctly, but when i run "glxinfo | grep direct" i get "direct rendering: No"
2006-07-08T12:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	how do you know they are installed correctly?
2006-07-08T12:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	when you boot, or when gdm starts?
2006-07-08T12:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	don't know what the BUMPS utility is, but you can easily verify that you are using the nvidia drivers or not. First, type this grep nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-07-08T12:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	you should get one line - Driver  "nvidia"
2006-07-08T12:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	okay, no problem. Are you using anything like XGL?
2006-07-08T12:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	okay, what do you get with this glxinfo | grep vendor
2006-07-08T12:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	seems you are running xgl.
2006-07-08T12:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	I think you are running the xserver-xgl version, not the plain version -- which is why your server vendor is sgi and client is nvidia (which is what I get on my xgl desktop)
2006-07-08T12:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	okay let me try to explain it. When you install compiz, you actually change the x server that you are running -- which I think kills direct rendering. If you revert back to the 'normal' x server, you will get direct rendering.
2006-07-08T12:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	yes, but I think there is a way to get direct rendering running with the xgl server -- atleast I read something to that effect. Try searching the gentoo-wiki
2006-07-08T12:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	there is a script floating around on compiz.net that turns it on and off via a click.
2007-04-10T16:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	ssh
2007-04-10T16:22:00.000Z	jarrett	fyrestrtr	can you give me an example oh how its used?
2007-04-10T16:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	well, first you have to make sure ssh is running on the remote machine.
2007-04-10T16:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	then, from your local terminal, ssh username@remotemachine (remotemachine can be the dns name, or ip address -- username is an account on the remote machine)
2007-04-10T16:24:00.000Z	jarrett	fyrestrtr	it is, its for school, ive connected on windows with putty, i just didnt know how in ubuntu
2007-04-10T16:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jarrett	in ubuntu, just open a terminal. Then type ssh username@machinename
2007-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	jarrett	fyrestrtr	thanks but it appears the server is down anyway =/
