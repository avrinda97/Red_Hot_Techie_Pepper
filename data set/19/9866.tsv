2010-04-20T08:33:00.000Z	droid7		yes by default
2010-04-20T08:33:00.000Z	droid7		i installed 2 days ago
2010-04-20T08:33:00.000Z	droid7		it prompts root pass then adds user
2010-04-20T08:33:00.000Z	droid7		then prompts user pass
2010-04-20T08:34:00.000Z	droid7		9.10
2010-04-20T08:34:00.000Z	droid7		64bit server install
2010-04-20T08:35:00.000Z	droid7		so how does root get a pass then?
2010-04-20T08:35:00.000Z	droid7		..
2010-04-20T08:36:00.000Z	droid7		then he should be able to login as root without a pass
2010-04-20T08:36:00.000Z	droid7		according to your logic
2010-04-20T08:36:00.000Z	scunizi	droid7	doesn't work like that
2010-04-20T08:37:00.000Z	droid7	maginot	i don't know what you're trying to say. but i was asked for root pass when i installed 2 days ago
2010-04-20T08:39:00.000Z	droid7	maginot	have you used any other distro besides ubuntu?
2010-04-20T08:39:00.000Z	scunizi	droid7	we all know other distros have user and root password associations
2010-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	droid7		yes, for desktop
2010-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	droid7		not server..
2010-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	droid7		why would root be disabled on a server..
2010-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	droid7		you never use root, but you never disable it
2010-04-20T08:41:00.000Z	scunizi	droid7	maginot this is getting off topic and should be moved to #ubuntu-offtopic
