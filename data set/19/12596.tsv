2005-08-13T05:26:00.000Z	cafuego_		Just run 'nvidia-glx-config' to enable it in xorg.conf
2005-08-13T05:26:00.000Z	cafuego_		Note that glxgears is missing in breezy
2005-08-13T05:28:00.000Z	cafuego_		I expect you'd need to run ET in a 32bit chroot.
2005-08-13T05:30:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	sorry I didn't even realize you were talking to me there :s
2005-08-13T06:55:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	Do you have access to a 32bit box to convert that package?
2005-08-13T06:55:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	no I don't
2005-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	Shall I volunteer?
2005-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	to "look after" my box?
2005-08-13T06:57:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	No, to run alien and give you  a.deb
2005-08-13T06:57:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	I don't know what you're talking about, but I kinda want to get a game working more than anything... /sigh
2005-08-13T06:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	Sorry, i thought you were having limewire issues
2005-08-13T06:58:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	I'm having Linux issues!
2005-08-13T06:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	<heh>
2005-08-13T06:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	Mebbe going to 32bit would solve a lot of hassles.
2005-08-13T07:01:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	what? Windows is 32 bit and I can guarantee it works, but people keep telling me that Linux is worth all the hassels so I'm thinkin that I'm in for a real treat being that this is a big fucking hassel
2005-08-13T07:02:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	Well, yes and no. A lot of end-user software is still 32bit and doesn't port particularly well. Examples being cedega, w32codecs and flash.
2005-08-13T07:02:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	yeah, all the things I came here for
2005-08-13T07:03:00.000Z	cafuego_	kaffeend	In time they _will_ be ported to 64bit...
2005-08-13T07:04:00.000Z	kaffeend	cafuego_	yes, in time... I'm waiting for a fix on this nvidia.glx bug now
