2005-03-31T08:17:00.000Z	crimsun	Diablo-D3	you could do the manual method that I used with the Warty preview: as soon as the partitioning udebs have been unpacked, switch to a busybox shell on alt+F2 and create a swap partition, then mount it
2005-03-31T08:17:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	it doesnt even get that far
2005-03-31T08:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Diablo-D3	I'm fairly certain by that point the partitioning udeb(s) have been unpacked, but I haven't tried it since the Warty preview
2005-03-31T08:21:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	hrm
2005-03-31T08:21:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	does ubuntu have a partition editor?
2005-03-31T08:21:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	because I need to repartition the drive
2005-03-31T08:24:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	no partitioning tools are installed
2005-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Diablo-D3	yes
2005-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Diablo-D3	it just uses the same base as Ubuntu
2005-03-31T12:27:00.000Z	crimsun	Diablo-D3	you can use Woody netinstall and dist-upgrade over
2005-03-31T12:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	yup, I could
2005-03-31T12:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	Im just trying to get a sane linux onto the box
2005-03-31T12:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	doesnt have to be ubuntu
2005-03-31T12:28:00.000Z	crimsun	Diablo-D3	tried netboot? http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-11-26.2137127791/view?searchterm=netboot
2005-03-31T12:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	no network card
2005-03-31T12:28:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	which pisses me off
2005-03-31T12:29:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	it should not be this hard to install linux.
2005-03-31T12:30:00.000Z	Diablo-D3	crimsun	I cant even get at the hd without opening it up. I could put the hd in my laptop, and then install linux, but noooOOOOooo.
