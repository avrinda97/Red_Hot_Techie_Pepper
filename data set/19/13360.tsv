2005-04-12T10:36:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	oh hi, somebody linked your mockup in another channel.  :x  i came to say you've quite miscredited the icons...
2005-04-12T10:36:00.000Z	Nekohayo		I did? what should I write?
2005-04-12T10:36:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	look at http://www.brisgeek.com/etiquette
2005-04-12T10:36:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	also http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=19853
2005-04-12T10:36:00.000Z	Nekohayo		XD
2005-04-12T10:37:00.000Z	Nekohayo		ok, thank you Em (this is my first time..)
2005-04-12T10:37:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	all it's fine, dear.  also, about your mockup, it looks a LOT like a gdesklet, and is a lot like something a gdesklet would exist to take care of.  like individual little gdesklets
2005-04-12T10:38:00.000Z	Nekohayo	Em	but it's meant to be independant.. I think.. like beagle for instance
2005-04-12T10:38:00.000Z	Nekohayo	Em	so the author is Andrew Fitzsimon?
2005-04-12T10:38:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	**shrug**  that's fine, it's kinda what gdesklets exists to do, but otherwise this might be a bit harder to write (if it's standalone, ya know ?)
2005-04-12T10:38:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	as far as i know
2005-04-12T10:39:00.000Z	Nekohayo	Em	besides, never got to make gdesklets work.. Xd
2005-04-12T10:39:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	i know, it's a really immature project, i do wish they'd polish it up more, it's such a pain to make any of it work the way you want
2005-04-12T10:40:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	that said, this is what it exists for.  :x
2005-04-12T10:40:00.000Z	Nekohayo	Em	anyways, I'm thinking of writing down thoughts, better mockups (fixing that one) and all during the week end, and then maybe start publicizing to get some help out there or something.. but it needs to be foretought
2005-04-12T10:41:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	well good luck, you'll probably run into the "show us the code" attitude a lot though...  :x   if you really want it, keep at it i guess.
2005-04-12T10:41:00.000Z	Nekohayo		yeah but I think we'll have to wait for this like you say..
2005-04-12T10:41:00.000Z	Nekohayo		but the only thing I can do for now is write text...
2005-04-12T10:43:00.000Z	Em	Nekohayo	well good luck.  maybe you could learn to do programming ?
