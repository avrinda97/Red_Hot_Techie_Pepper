2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		they all differ
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		and I got hundreds of them
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		all over the place
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		I simply don't want to make a shellscript or some program to rename all files
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Trixsey		I rather format and get debian or whatever
2007-03-14T16:22:00.000Z	Trixsey		I'll just get KDE then.. this is nuts.. I know there are solutions and workarounds but why spend hours (it'd take plenty of time) on converting from one extension to another? (I have a bunch of extensions and they are all wrong, and in different folders and stuff).. not only MPEG/QT
2007-03-14T16:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		I mean, everything can be solved if you put lots of time to solve it, but my point is why oh WHY would you include such a useless feature in the first place!?!?
2007-03-14T16:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		I dont download pirated movies
2007-03-14T16:23:00.000Z	Trixsey		I download free pornography that I masturbate to
2007-03-14T16:25:00.000Z	Trixsey		It's not hard to make a shell script that renames the file extensions in a folder, but like I said.. it's not only QT/mov files.. I don't even know what all are
2007-03-14T16:26:00.000Z	Factory	Trixsey	you downloaded it, didn't you?
2007-03-14T16:26:00.000Z	Trixsey	Factory	I have hundreds of movies
2007-03-14T16:31:00.000Z	Factory	Trixsey	or just get a diff file manager.
2007-03-14T16:31:00.000Z	Factory	Trixsey	why throw away the fridge because the milk is bad?
2007-03-14T16:32:00.000Z	Trixsey	Factory	if the same person made both the fridge and the milk.. you take out your anger on everything he made.. and remove it all! ROAR
2007-03-14T16:33:00.000Z	Factory	Trixsey	You're pretty impatient then =p Remind me not to make you tester for anything I ever right, lest you complain about the colors used.
2007-03-14T16:33:00.000Z	Factory	Trixsey	If you change your mind, http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/nonautilusplease
2007-03-14T16:35:00.000Z	Trixsey	Factory	I didn't complain about the colors.. ??
2007-03-14T16:35:00.000Z	Factory	Trixsey	I was making an analogy =)
