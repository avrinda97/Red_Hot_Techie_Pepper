2009-08-12T07:45:00.000Z	ninjaslim	stlsaint	i would need to do manual configuration right in say network settings and not use dhcp for eth0 right?
2009-08-12T07:45:00.000Z	stlsaint	ninjaslim	right no dont use DHCP...set ip, gateway and dns manual...
2009-08-12T07:46:00.000Z	ninjaslim	stlsaint	ok, so gateway should be the ip of the macbook pro or the router and what about dns?

2009-08-12T08:06:00.000Z	ninjaslim	stlsaint	wow i cannot get this to work
2009-08-12T08:09:00.000Z	ninjaslim	stlsaint	it's ubuntu side, the connection works but i can't get onto the internet, no pages open, and the connection intermittently disonncets and recnnects
2009-08-12T08:15:00.000Z	ninjaslim	stlsaint	i have no clue, how can i set the port?
2009-08-12T08:19:00.000Z	ninjaslim	stlsaint	i think my router runs a firewall but that shouldn't matter, i don't think my mac runs one
