2009-01-14T19:24:00.000Z	bert1		i'm downloading steam/counterstrike1.6 right now thru wine and i need to get verdanna arial and tahoma truetype fonts, where can i get these free?
2009-01-14T19:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	msttfonts package I believe
2009-06-03T06:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	a cd is supposed to hold 700 meg single layer dvd at 4.7 or so and I dont know about dbl layer
2009-06-03T06:25:00.000Z	bert1	Jack_Sparrow	- so, like, if you want to burn a DVD and you are at best-buy, do you buy special DVD cds? is there a difference in the size allowed on the CD, or just in the files and way you burn to the CD?
2009-06-03T06:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	cd and dvd are very different.  use the right one for each purpose, cd can be audio or data or bootable etc.
2009-06-03T22:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	Are you doing if from livecd or from the install.  Dont try to move or resize a mounted partition
2009-06-03T22:33:00.000Z	bert1	Jack_Sparrow	livecd. its unmounted
2009-06-03T22:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	ty just checking
2009-06-03T22:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	if you have an extended partition that complicates the issue
2009-06-03T22:34:00.000Z	bert1	Jack_Sparrow	- i think i do. in noob speak... i think my sda3 contains sda3 (swap) and sda5 (main ubuntu space) as well as unallocated space . what should i do?
2009-06-03T22:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	Pastebin your sudo fdisk -l   and provide a link please

2009-06-03T22:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	to expand sda1 or 2 you will need to remove 345 etc
2009-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	bert1	Jack_Sparrow	- so i have to delete all my linux partitions, resize vista, then reinstall ubuntu ?
2009-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	you can trhow things onto a diff drive and move them back,
2009-06-03T22:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	You may be able to umount 345 and try to shrink the ext3  sda3 etc, just not sure that will work right
2009-06-03T22:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	fixing the mbr to get windows isnt hard, but reinstalling ubuntu / grub will fix that anyhow
2009-06-03T22:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bert1	np, good luck
