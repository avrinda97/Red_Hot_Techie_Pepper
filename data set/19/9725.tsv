2007-12-09T18:38:00.000Z	larson9999		i'm starting to get nervous.  this mobo boots but doesn't install.  can't figure it out.  tried all sorts of versions of ubuntu, sysrescd, puppy linux.  wonder if i goofed something up installing it
2007-12-09T18:39:00.000Z	larson9999		guess i'll try gparted
2007-12-09T18:39:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	which mobo is it?
2007-12-09T18:40:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	mis k9vgm-v
2007-12-09T18:46:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	everyone says this mobo is supported well.  guess i'll start unplugging stuff one by one
2007-12-09T18:56:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	not really. when exactly does it crash everytime?
2007-12-09T18:57:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	it depends on which version i try to install.  which should i try?
2007-12-09T18:58:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	we are in #ubuntu
2007-12-09T18:59:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	yeah, well there is i386 and 64bit, livecd and alternate.
2007-12-09T19:56:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	it hangs at 'loading please wait'
2007-12-09T19:57:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	directly when loading the kernel? nothing else on screen? before that?
2007-12-09T20:35:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	it was memory.  i'm a moron.  this board only supports 2 gig and i had 4 in.
2007-12-09T20:36:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	good to know. what chipset (so I can avoid it in the future if the need arises)?
2007-12-09T20:37:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	via k8m890
2007-12-09T20:38:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	now the joy of trying to take a mobo back :)
2007-12-09T20:38:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	seves you right that you bought via crap :P
2007-12-09T20:39:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	karma imho :)
2007-12-09T20:40:00.000Z	larson9999	wols	i always buy the cheapest i can find.  actually, i usually get my stuff from dumpsters or curbside.  i just went to compusa to buy some ram for my wife's laptop and picked this up then.  that'll teach me
2008-08-06T00:13:00.000Z	wols	larson9999	you need 700MB CD-Rs
