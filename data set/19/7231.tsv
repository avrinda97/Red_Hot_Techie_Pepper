2008-01-17T00:28:00.000Z	sco50000		i'm really starting to hate Ubuntu :(
2008-01-17T00:29:00.000Z	sco50000		with a fresh install of Ubuntu, i can't even boot
2008-01-17T00:30:00.000Z	sco50000		how*
2008-01-17T00:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sco50000	What do you get... cli...

2008-01-17T00:35:00.000Z	sco50000	Jack_Sparrow	dual
2008-01-17T00:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sco50000	Do you get to the grub menu?
2008-01-17T00:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sco50000	What happens when you go into recovery mode
2008-01-17T00:37:00.000Z	sco50000	Jack_Sparrow	then it works fine and i get a root prompt
2008-01-17T00:37:00.000Z	sco50000	Jack_Sparrow	and i can do 'startx' and get a root kde session
2008-01-17T00:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sco50000	From there I would try sodu dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  select vesa as my video card and 1024 max res  just to see if you get the gui
2008-01-17T00:38:00.000Z	sco50000	Jack_Sparrow	okay i'll try all that
2008-01-17T00:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sco50000	obviously I meant sudo
2008-01-17T00:44:00.000Z	sco50000	Jack_Sparrow	now it went one step further and hangs on 'starting k display manager: kdm'
2008-01-17T00:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sco50000	Post your xorg to the pastebin and someone will look it over
