2008-01-27T22:40:00.000Z	Stephen-Mason		it says rerun this program as a super useR?
2008-01-27T22:41:00.000Z	Stephen-Mason		how do i enable super user?
2008-01-27T22:43:00.000Z	Stephen-Mason		What is the directory that contains the init directories (rc0.d/ to rc6.d/)?  where are these files?
2008-01-27T22:44:00.000Z	Stephen-Mason		kk
2008-01-27T22:45:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	$ whereis rc0.d ,, jsyk.
2008-01-27T22:49:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	You probably want "server"
2008-01-27T23:00:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	Trust me,, go for "server". It is a lot more "mindless" to configure.
2008-01-27T23:01:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	Especially if you intend on running multiple vm's which I know you will. :)
2008-01-27T23:22:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	Ok Synaptic package manager is your friend,
2008-01-27T23:23:00.000Z	Stephen-Mason	phenom	i didnt use synaptic package manager to install it?
2008-01-27T23:23:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	Until you become a bit more familiar using the terminal, then I'd suggest you to useit/live it/love it. Open Synaptic, and simply right click/uninstall.
2008-01-27T23:24:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	I'm not sure how you installed it, I assume either via apt-get/aptitude/or synaptic.
2008-01-27T23:24:00.000Z	Stephen-Mason	phenom	command line
2008-01-27T23:26:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	Yes, use search "vmware" or whatever you installed via comand line.
2008-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	A couple notes: You can only have one apt-get process running at a time, as synaptic is only a gui for apt-get you can only run one synaptic also. Did you uninstall whatever it was you installed via command line?
2008-01-27T23:33:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	What command did you install that program with?
2008-01-27T23:34:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	What command did you install vmware player with? :P
2008-01-27T23:41:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	I again,, would use synaptic package manager to install everything until you get a bit more comfortable with the command line, and note: anything that you can install via "sudo apt-get install whatever" can be installed/removed with synaptic package manager. It is perfectly find to install/remove programs with either method, but I would suggest only those 2 methods "for now at least", do not contemplate building or installing from "s
2008-01-28T01:46:00.000Z	phenom	Stephen-Mason	You get your VMWare working? :)
