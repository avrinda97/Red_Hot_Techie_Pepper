2009-04-24T23:13:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	"don't work" is extremely vague
2009-04-24T23:14:00.000Z	ubuntistas	maco	 sucks
2009-04-24T23:15:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	again, vague. what is it doing wrong?
2009-04-24T23:16:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	try launching totem from a terminal. see ifi t's giving you the error it's giving me
2009-04-24T23:17:00.000Z	ubuntistas	maco	iam in jaunty
2009-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	ubuntistas	maco	http://paste.ubuntu.com/157413/
2009-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	thats not an error, but totem just crashes immediately?
2009-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	no additional error on teh crash?
2009-08-26T00:55:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	because they block everything thats not quicktime. because they're jerks.
2009-08-26T00:55:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	you can use wget to download them if you give it a quicktime user agent string like "-U Quicktime/screwapple.0"
2009-08-26T00:57:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	and then youd play it in totem or whatever video player you have
2009-08-26T00:57:00.000Z	ubuntistas	maco	any other solution
2009-08-26T00:58:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	this just started like 3 days ago, but there's a patch in existence to make gstreamer identify as quicktime. it hasnt been merged anywhere yet though
2009-08-26T01:13:00.000Z	maco	ubuntistas	i already explained to you
