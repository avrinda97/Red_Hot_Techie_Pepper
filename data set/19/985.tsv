2011-06-25T00:21:00.000Z	kate_r		hi
2011-06-25T00:21:00.000Z	kate_r		does anyone know how to connect a bluetooth headset? i'm following the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothHeadset but when i do
2011-06-25T00:21:00.000Z	kate_r		pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset
2011-06-25T00:22:00.000Z	kate_r		i get an error saying module initialisation failed
2011-06-25T00:22:00.000Z	kate_r		when i run "pactl list" i don't see a module called "module-alsa-sink". is that module still in natty?
2011-06-25T00:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kate_r	what version of Ubuntu are you using?  from 10.10 on it "should" almost work OOTB with Pulse
2011-06-25T00:24:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	i'm running natty
2011-06-25T00:24:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	i can pair with it, but just that i can't find it under Sound input/output
2011-06-25T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kate_r	you're following directions for Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04 -- see the very top of that page for 10.10 ON
2011-06-25T00:25:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	yeah, do they not apply to natty as well? i can't seem to find documentation for natty, that's why.
2011-06-25T00:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kate_r	do you see the very top of that page?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothHeadset
2011-06-25T00:27:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	yep. i've clicked on it and took me to the BluetoothSetup page
2011-06-25T00:27:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	in it, it says "For Bluetooth Headsets specifically refer to BluetoothHeadset" which points to the Jaunty instructions
2011-06-25T00:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9		!es | dell
2011-06-25T00:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kate_r	and on that BluetoothHeadset page at the top it talks about what to do for 10.10 ONwards - it's all Pulse now.
2011-06-25T00:28:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	though it says for 10.10 and later, i can just go to Sound and find it. unfortunately it's not there.
2011-06-25T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kate_r	ummm, if it doesn't show up, I really don't know what to suggest.  Bluetooth was always a nightmare until 10.10, which on my system worked perfectly for two headsets.  Best of luck!
2011-06-25T00:29:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	hmm ok
2011-06-25T00:30:00.000Z	kate_r	ZykoticK9	thanks anyway
