2008-01-22T02:32:00.000Z	h1st0	tanath	what where you doing when this started?
2008-01-22T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	h1st0	my power supply exploded... then it started getting slow (lagging a bit). now my icons don't show & that
2008-01-22T02:33:00.000Z	h1st0	tanath	hrm...
2008-01-22T02:33:00.000Z	h1st0	tanath	and they all work for other users?
2008-01-22T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	h1st0	lag is mostly gone though
2008-01-22T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	h1st0	yeh
2008-01-22T02:34:00.000Z	tanath	h1st0	i need this account though
2008-01-22T02:34:00.000Z	h1st0	tanath	Well you can keep the account just your gconf settings are hosed or something.
2008-01-22T02:34:00.000Z	h1st0	tanath	all the files for the account are in /home/username
2008-01-22T02:34:00.000Z	h1st0	tanath	in there is a .gconf folder.  I'm not sure what happens if you delete that though if it will be recreated.  Someone else may know.
2008-01-22T02:35:00.000Z	tanath	h1st0	yeah, but many are hard coded, and i can't seem to apply permissions recursively
