2006-07-01T13:17:00.000Z	devonst17_		Yo, Dapper 6.02 PPC problem,
2006-07-01T13:18:00.000Z	devonst17_		I've got an iBook clamshell, 800x600 resolution max, when I boot up the LiveCD, it looks perfectly fine till it loads X, at which point I get a black screen
2006-07-01T13:18:00.000Z	devonst17_		I was guessing this was a resolution conflict,
2006-07-01T13:19:00.000Z	devonst17_		so I booted up with the alternate video setting (cant remember what it was, sry)
2006-07-01T13:19:00.000Z	devonst17_		and it dumped me into bash
2006-07-01T13:19:00.000Z	devonst17_		well,
2006-07-01T13:19:00.000Z	devonst17_		It booted fine till it started x
2006-07-01T13:20:00.000Z	devonst17_		and garryF its yaboot
2006-07-01T13:20:00.000Z	devonst17_		*yabboot
2006-07-01T13:21:00.000Z	devonst17_		anyway, it dumped me into Bash,
2006-07-01T13:21:00.000Z	stefg	devonst17_	This is not an uncommon issue...
2006-07-01T13:22:00.000Z	devonst17_	stefg	I've found nothing :(
2006-07-01T13:24:00.000Z	stefg	devonst17_	The forums and the net were full of reports, when I set up an oldish iMac G3 4 weeks ago.. The video-autorecognition simply doesn't work perfect. type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg at the bash-prompt and do it manually (sometimes 15-bit colour is required!)
2006-07-01T13:24:00.000Z	devonst17_	stefg	Does this problem also effect the terminal?
2006-07-01T13:24:00.000Z	devonst17_	stefg	cause it was _WAY_ the hell off
2006-07-01T13:28:00.000Z	stefg	devonst17_	the thing with apples is that there's certain pram parameters (e.g. video-settings) that linux can't access
2006-07-01T13:29:00.000Z	stefg	devonst17_	but there's more knowledgeable people around than me when it comes to powerbooks
2006-07-01T13:29:00.000Z	devonst17_	stefg	(Sorry to correct you when you are helping me and all, but its not an apple... Apples went out of production a very long time ago. The computers Apple makes these days are called Macs)
