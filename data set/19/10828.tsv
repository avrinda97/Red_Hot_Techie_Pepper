2006-05-11T14:40:00.000Z	bioSys		Hello community. I recompiled my kernel 4 times now, and its never able to mount my root fs, which is reiserfs. The splashscreen comes up but everything stops at "Mounting root filesystem \n Waiting for root fs". Can unsupported hardware cause this? I compiled reiserfs support in the kernel offcourse
2006-05-11T14:41:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	and ide/scsi chipset in?
2006-05-11T14:41:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	what disk?
2006-05-11T14:41:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	yes. Its a sate dma 133
2006-05-11T14:42:00.000Z	bioSys		sata
2006-05-11T14:42:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	then, you have sata support problem
2006-05-11T14:43:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	but it worked when I had ext3 root fs
2006-05-11T14:45:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	okay, fsck
2006-05-11T14:46:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	you can boot livecd to fsck
2006-05-11T14:47:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	ok thanks
2006-05-11T14:48:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	but, wait, its working with the default kernel, im here now
2006-05-11T14:49:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	btw, are you sure it's the correct kernel you are booting?
2006-05-11T14:49:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	yes, very shure
2006-05-11T14:52:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	but I am wondering, when I download the kernel sources, and do a menuconfig, is the default settings the same as the settings in the default kernel package?
2006-05-11T14:52:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	no, you have to go over menuconfig
2006-05-11T14:54:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	ok, thanks for your help, Ill dive in to the menuconfig once again
2006-05-11T14:54:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	go over all steps
2006-05-11T14:56:00.000Z	dli	bioSys	if you can still change, reiserfs is not a good choice, try jfs/ext3, or xfs, if you have UPS
2006-05-11T14:57:00.000Z	bioSys	dli	yes, I actually think ill do that
