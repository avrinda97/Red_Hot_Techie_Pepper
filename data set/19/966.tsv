2011-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	mecheese		my monitor says "signal out of range" how do I fix that?
2011-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	 another useless answer, get a bigger monitor.
2011-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	more usefully you need to lower the default resolution
2011-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	I have an lcd. it's fairly large and high resolution. It's just not being detected and set up for my nvidia drivers.
2011-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	ok. you can muck with the current settings using xrandr
2011-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	is that in the terminal?
2011-07-03T13:12:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	will that work through the live cd to fix an install on hard disk?
2011-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	darn. do you know any settings that will fix x? my xorg.conf is empty of settings.
2011-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	yeah, they switched to auto-detecting everythign
2011-07-03T13:16:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	it's funny. my monitor worked better with version 10.04. now 11.04 is not doing so good with it.
2011-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	maybe boot into 10.04 and grab the x config? and see if you can merge some of its settings into 11.04?
2011-07-03T13:20:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	that's an idea. I'm gonna try that now and see what kind of magic happens.
2011-07-03T13:33:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	hi again. i can't fix my monitor because ther's no xorg.conf file
2011-07-03T13:34:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	I'm stumped
2011-07-03T13:35:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	i have read that the x configurations are in the server now. that's a problem. no easy way to reconfigure.
2011-07-03T13:36:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	it's the nvidia drivers. before I installed that my monitor worked fine.
2011-07-03T13:36:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	ah ok. there is a nvidia config tool?
2011-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	faina	mecheese	I'd search for  nvidia on the ubuntu wiki.
2011-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	mecheese	faina	but how would I get to it if I can't see it in my monitor?
