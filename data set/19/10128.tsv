2009-04-02T18:45:00.000Z	clearscreen		Guess I'm the one asking the question this time :) I was trying to install vista. Booted into ubuntu live cd and resized my ext3 partition. Problem is that vista install does see the reserved space and apparently is able to create a 'new' partition in that space, but it can't find 'a partition suitable for installation' for some reason. I'm now trying to create an ntfs partition from ubuntu, but gparted cant make ntfs partition.. MY QUESTI

2009-04-02T18:46:00.000Z	clearscreen	sebsebseb	oh?
2009-04-02T18:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	can't resize VIsta to a good size  without risking dataloss
2009-04-02T18:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	yeah GParted won't do vista's partition properly,  and the vista resizing itself stuff is not that good either
2009-04-02T18:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	if you got enough RAM, you can  virtual machine Vista  or  XP
2009-04-02T18:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	fine for everything pretty much, but not 3D games
2009-04-02T18:47:00.000Z	clearscreen	sebsebseb	the problem is that I need to develop C# XNA apps for my job, which is very buggy (very early 3d acceleration support) in VM's
2009-04-02T18:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	ok
2009-04-02T18:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	well you can put Vista, on  and save to the partition from Ubuntu anyway
2009-04-09T00:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	indeed, however when the channel is dead arguing as you called it, well made it at least more active :D
2009-09-07T06:49:00.000Z	clearscreen	sebsebseb	why so fast :(
2009-09-07T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	what?
2009-09-07T06:49:00.000Z	clearscreen	sebsebseb	you're too fast
2009-09-07T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	good :)
2009-09-07T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	also isn't that really the point of this channal, to hopefuly get fast help?
2009-09-07T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	or to be giving that help
2009-09-07T06:51:00.000Z	clearscreen	sebsebseb	Good for the channel, bad for my self-esteem! :D
2009-09-07T06:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	clearscreen	ok
