2008-05-04T20:51:00.000Z	European-African		hey guys, how do you install kde, on ubuntu, is there a kde-install-all package in the spm?
2008-05-04T20:52:00.000Z	European-African		ok thanx. will install mow
2008-05-04T20:52:00.000Z	European-African		now
2008-05-04T20:52:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	kubuntu-desktop is what you need to install
2008-05-16T12:49:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	it is envyng-gtk for gnome (-qt for kde)
2008-05-16T12:53:00.000Z	European-African	bazhang	I can find envy in spm under any name!
2008-05-16T12:53:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	this is for hardy only
2008-05-16T12:54:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	restricted drivers manager for gutsy
2008-05-16T12:55:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	have you used it yet
2008-05-16T12:57:00.000Z	European-African	bazhang	does restricted drivers manager do a better job than envy or the same?
2008-05-16T12:57:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	envy in gutsy is not supported here
2008-05-16T12:59:00.000Z	European-African	bazhang	restricted drivers manager, will it install nvidia 8500 gt so it will be utilized fully?
2008-05-16T13:00:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	it should do; dont have that card so cannot say from personal experience
2008-05-16T13:01:00.000Z	European-African	bazhang	how do I use the tv out on the card, does rdm install a utility to do this?
2008-05-21T18:33:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	they are not meant to be used together
2008-05-21T18:34:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	ah I see.
2008-05-21T18:36:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	no means of comparing here as I only use the one.
2008-05-21T18:58:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	no, but there is a workaround if you wish
2008-05-21T18:59:00.000Z	bazhang	European-African	frontpage of slashdot today
