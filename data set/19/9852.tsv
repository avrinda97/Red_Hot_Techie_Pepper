2006-10-04T16:35:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Can anyone answer my question?
2006-10-04T16:36:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		How would i install windows(on a seperate) partition without it messing up my mbr and/or xubuntu install?  (i need to install windows for college)
2006-10-04T16:36:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		I dont wanna mess around reinstalling grub and such :(
2006-10-04T16:37:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Because i need it for college
2006-10-04T16:37:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		and im on a 1.4ghz powerbook, I dont wanna use a virtual machine.
2006-10-04T16:38:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Listen, I came here to ask for advice not to be questioned, I need windows because theres alot of windows only software i need for college which the chances are wont work with wine and its far easier for me to just dual boot.
2006-10-04T16:39:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	what are these windows only programs?
2006-10-04T16:39:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	what programs?
2006-10-04T16:43:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	are some of those must use programs office stuff?
2006-10-04T16:44:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	sivik	some of them yes, Along with macromedia, Groupwise, .Net 2.0 runtimes with VC# and other stuff
2006-10-04T16:44:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	ok, .net 2.0 can be run with mono, some of macromedia stuff can be ran with crossover office
2006-10-04T16:45:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	sivik	now your talking shite, Half of .net 1.1 is still missing in mono let alone 2
2006-10-04T16:45:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	whatever you say, i haven't had much problems with it
2006-10-04T16:47:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	sivik	Don't get me wrong, im not saying its bad or naff software or anything, nor am i saying that about crossover or anything else you mentioned, I just dont see the point in me spending hours trying to get everything running when the tutors would complain anyway, It seems a big waste of time and effort to me since the only thing ill be using it for is collage
2006-10-04T16:47:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	then don't use linux
2006-10-04T16:48:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	sivik	I use it only for home use, But i NEED to use windows for college, hence the dual boot
2006-10-04T16:53:00.000Z	sivik	Crippy-Boy	i didn't say that, i just said you can run a bunch of that stuff with either wine or crossover
2006-10-04T16:54:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	sivik	no worries, crossed wires then, but it didnt help that you wasnt the only on :-)
