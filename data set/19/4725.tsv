2008-11-17T01:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	atmosfer	no, the problem is that you don't understand what you are doing, I already instructed you to chroot and then execute the dpkg command, knowing that you are doing something dangerous
2008-11-17T01:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	atmosfer	if you just broke your system libraries with forced installs or using the wrongs reposiotires, you will be better by reinstalling the system after backing up your data
2008-11-17T01:33:00.000Z	atmosfer	joaopinto	i'm new to linux how can i chroot and then execute the dpkg command?
2008-11-17T01:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	atmosfer	just reinstall your system, if you are new to linux and you don't know how to execute a single command, you will noe be able to fix a broken libc
