2008-05-20T16:50:00.000Z	Lr5_		Is it normal to have three compiz processes running?
2008-05-20T16:50:00.000Z	Lr5_		umm, four
2008-05-20T16:51:00.000Z	Lr5_		actually five
2008-05-20T16:51:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	i just started playing with it today, so dunno, but I have compiz-decorator (2 instances), compiz and compiz.real in my process table
2008-05-20T16:55:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	huh.  i've only got a 1.8GHz p4m, and it's sitting at about 1.3% with a 31M memory footprint
2008-05-20T16:56:00.000Z	Lr5_	garrett__	I have a core 2, 2.13 ghz both
2008-05-20T16:56:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	could it be that it's showing up twice in your process table because it's spread across both cores?
2008-05-20T16:56:00.000Z	Lr5_	garrett__	it shows as 4-5
2008-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	i don't have a dual core box, but i remember about 8years ago there was some serious goofyness with process reporting on SMP machines.
2008-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	i'm guessing that's been fixed up, but im' not too familiar with it.
2008-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	is it running slow?  or are you just making sure that it's not doing something silly?
2008-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	powered by rabits!
2008-05-20T16:58:00.000Z	Lr5_	garrett__	other programs are running a bit slow
2008-05-20T16:58:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	huh
2008-05-20T16:59:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	are you using gnome?  if so, try disabling it and see if you get you performance back
2008-05-20T16:59:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	dunno what'll happen if you killall -9
2008-05-20T16:59:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	huh.  that probably shouldn't happen
2008-05-20T17:09:00.000Z	garrett__	Lr5_	something probably got bjorked up
2008-05-20T17:10:00.000Z	Lr5_	garrett__	could be related to testing how firefox crashes the x server when visiting certain pages
