2006-12-08T11:31:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	  go look around linux.org   there is a live linux cd for disk and partition backups   can't remember the name but it is comparable to Partition Magic
2006-12-08T11:31:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	  you can use it to backup the partition and or copy it to another disk
2006-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	it runs on linux and is designed for exactly what you are doing....in linux
2006-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	Manstein	ITSa341	ill try to find the distro on www.linux.org
2006-12-08T11:36:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	  I would be careful until you nackup the 2bg drive and have the replacement installed and booting
2006-12-08T11:37:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	 I would also recommend replaceing it SOON
2006-12-08T11:38:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	 Bummer, I lost a 250GB in my xbox last week
2006-12-08T11:58:00.000Z	Manstein	ITSa341	I'm trying the "dd" program. Since it's my first time using "dd" and I don't know what I'm doing, any comments will be appreciated :D.

2006-12-08T12:00:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	   asking the wrong person, I can't remember the name of the live linux disk utilities I found but they were graphical like Partition Magic and was idiot proof
2006-12-08T12:01:00.000Z	ITSa341	Manstein	  Seveas is the one to listen to, saved my butt a few times in here !!   :-)
