2005-10-08T13:02:00.000Z	GDorn		!tell me about fluxbox
2005-10-08T13:03:00.000Z	GDorn		I'm a little vague on windowmanagers...  if I switch to a different one, say, fluxbox, does it mean I'm going to have to manually build menus again?
2005-10-08T13:05:00.000Z	GDorn		I tend to use apt-get for packages I know the names of, and synapse only when I need to search for something that I can't recall
2005-10-08T13:06:00.000Z	GDorn		hmm.
2005-10-08T13:07:00.000Z	GDorn		here's a little pet peeve of mine:  windowmanagers that don't map the upper-right-pixel of the screen to the 'close' button on a maximized window.  there's only one gnome theme in ubuntu that doesn't have a border in the way up there, and it's ugly...

2005-10-08T13:09:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	i always used to hate that too. then i started using windows like they were _meant_ to be used (not maximizing all of them) and that problem went away
2005-10-08T13:11:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	switching to dvorak doesn't fix your wrist pain. switching to _any_other_keyboard_style fixes your wrist pain just the same
2005-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	i had tons of wrist pain. now i vary my keyboards once a week (flat, microsoft natural, different curves). ive even learned to start using my mouse left handed
2005-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	because you are consistently using the same posture and same muscles in the exact same way, thats what causes rsi/pain. "switching it up" solves a lot of problems
2005-10-08T13:13:00.000Z	GDorn	esac	 that still doesn't discount that some keyboard layouts require more difficult hand positions than others.
2005-10-08T13:14:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	ive been there. i used dvorak for 2 years. the pain came back once i became used to typing that way all of the time.
2005-10-08T13:16:00.000Z	GDorn	esac	 maybe it's working for me due to having different keyboards on different computers?  I've got a laptop with a smaller keyboard, a computer at work with a natural keyboard, and a flat one at home.  thing is, I had all of those with qwerty, and the only difference between then and now is dvorak.  and the lack of wrist pain (except for mousing)
2005-10-08T13:17:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	it comes down to just the fact that it is something new. it _will_ help your wrist pain, but your wrist pain will come back. you need typing breaks, and to learn to use your mouse left handed, and pick up some odd keyboards
2005-10-08T13:18:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	do not use wrist straps when typing. at night time is ok, but never when typing
2005-10-08T13:18:00.000Z	GDorn	esac	 it's been new for two years?
2005-10-08T13:18:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	go to a few doctors. i got work to pay for some odd keyboards because of it :)
2005-10-08T13:21:00.000Z	esac	GDorn	left handed, make sure everything is 1 click (trust me you'll get used to it)
