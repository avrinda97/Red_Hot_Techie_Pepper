2007-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	SamePaul		HOW TO INSTALL HOTPLUG? Anybody knows?
2007-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	transgress	SamePaul	hotplug is outdated.  it's udev now
2007-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	thanks. Can I use it for wireless too?
2007-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	transgress	SamePaul	i fail to see why not.  if your card is supported.  what do you mean?
2007-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	I installed driver for Intel 2200BG (iwp2200) but it does not load firmware, since it requires hotplug service
2007-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	Or maybe it is not the problem... But I'm close to smash this NB! I'm f***g 4 hours with wireless and can't get it working!
2007-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	transgress	SamePaul	eh i'm trying to find some info
2007-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	alright. Send me private message if you fund something
2007-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	so you've got something?
2007-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	transgress	SamePaul	nope.  best i can see is it should be working, but i'm still looking.  is it a pcmcia card?
2007-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	 No. It is mini-PCI
2007-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	I gues that problem is in HOTPLUG because in example syslogs I see more prints than I see on my ubuntu
2007-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	SamePaul	transgress	but it uses hotplug for firmware too!
