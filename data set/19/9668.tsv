2007-12-28T04:40:00.000Z	gabbah		hi guys. i ran ubuntu, and moved the system partition on the disk (booted from live cd to do that). Now i get a error 17 when grub loads. how can i tell grub that the partition has moved?
2007-12-28T04:41:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	you need to reinstall the MBR component of grub, try the "grub-install" script
2007-12-28T04:42:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	ok.. so where is that script? can i run it from live cd?
2007-12-28T04:45:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	I think so, you should read the manpage first though, the script might be volatile...
2007-12-28T04:46:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	ok cool.. so i'll just man grub it then i guess...
2007-12-28T04:46:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	actually, reading the manpage myself, I think it may not exactly do what I want it to... did you ever do a manual grub install?
2007-12-28T04:47:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	no i just installed ubuntu on a partition, and it fixed the grub part by itself
2007-12-28T04:47:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	but now the ubuntu partition has been moved by me. so grub cant find it and boot it
2007-12-28T04:48:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	hmm... can you get up to the grub menu?
2007-12-28T04:49:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	no menu. it just says grub loading stage1.5    grub loading please wait... error 17
2007-12-28T04:49:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	error 17 is it cant find the partition, which is correct
2007-12-28T04:49:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	I feared so... this is a bitch to fix...
2007-12-28T04:50:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	hmm but cant i just edit some file?
2007-12-28T04:50:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	where is the grub.. stuff located?
2007-12-28T04:51:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	no its a matter of rewriting grub to the MBR, the last time I tried that I got it wrong, my grub is rusty...
2007-12-28T04:51:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	grub actually have 3 components: stage 1 on the MBR, stage 1,5 and stage 2 in /boot
2007-12-28T04:52:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	well ok if it's that much trouble... i guess i'll just reinstall everything then.. i have the moste improtant stuff backed up anyway
2007-12-28T04:53:00.000Z	ifireball	gabbah	it just not something I feel capable of helping with over IRC, its a couple of grub commands, but it has to be the right ones...
2007-12-28T04:54:00.000Z	gabbah	ifireball	alright.. thanks man :)
