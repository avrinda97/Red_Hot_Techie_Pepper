2011-07-19T06:53:00.000Z	snax	wechat	shouldn't ubuntu work out of the box?
2011-07-19T06:54:00.000Z	wechat	snax	sudo aptitude -f -s install
2011-07-19T06:55:00.000Z	snax	wechat	I don't know aptitutde, nor do I care to learn it.  The question is why isn't apt working out of the box.

2011-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	wechat	snax	what is with locales?
2011-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	snax	wechat	I don't even know what locales are.  I just put the linux disk in and clicked install.
2011-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	wechat	snax	reconfigure them
2011-07-19T07:04:00.000Z	wechat	snax	sudo dpkg --configure cups
2011-07-19T07:04:00.000Z	wechat	snax	sources.list doesn't matter there
2011-07-19T07:05:00.000Z	wechat	snax	you have to finish installation of cups and the second package or force remove them or configure locales (languages)
2011-07-19T07:06:00.000Z	snax	wechat	You mean linux isn't dones installing?
2011-07-19T07:07:00.000Z	wechat	snax	packages for _dpkg_ are not finally_ installed
