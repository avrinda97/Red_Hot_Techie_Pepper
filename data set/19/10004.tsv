2006-08-13T06:44:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	hey, there you are.
2006-08-13T06:44:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	It mounted fine under knoppix. It's a ubuntu bug, it has to be
2006-08-13T06:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	in Ubuntu, you cannot mount a drive which has no partitions. I am guessing the eother debian based systems do something to allow you to mount a partitionless drive or there is at least one partition on that drive.
2006-08-13T06:46:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	It worked fine under knoppix. Don't see why it wouldn't in ubuntu.
2006-08-13T06:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	talk to the ubuntu devs and ask them why Ubuntu won't mount a drive that has no partitions on it?
2006-08-13T06:48:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	Any in here?
2006-08-13T06:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	Then there is at least one partition on that drive for that to work.
2006-08-13T06:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	CD/DVD drive?
2006-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	How many partitions are on that drive?
2006-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	I didn't think there was any. fdisk -l shows hdd1 . but I mount with /dev/hdd
2006-08-13T06:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	That is a partition (hdd1) it's the first partition on that drive. You have to have at least one partition in order to mount a drive.
2006-08-13T06:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	try sudo mount /dev/hdd1 /mountpoint in Ubuntu .. I bet it works.
2006-08-13T06:59:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	heh, I spent 3 hours trying to get it to work. If it was that simple I would have gotten it :P
2006-08-13T07:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	If sudo mount /dev/hdd1 /mountpoint doesn't work in Ubuntu, then something is wrong with your install. You mount partitions (hdd1) not drives.
2006-08-13T07:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	open a term in that livecd and type mount. Is hdd mounted or is it hdd1 ?
2006-08-13T07:03:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	heh, look, I'm not going to argue with you. I am telling you what I have done, not what I think. Yes, I know you typically mount partitions, I mount the device. I made the device have no partitions and just a filesystem ... bad idea. But you can do it, I've done it. And it is mounted as hdd, as I've already told you.
2006-08-13T07:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	foo-knoppix	Ok, I don't think you nderstand how drives/partitions/file systems work. Thanks for the info, though.
2006-08-13T07:05:00.000Z	foo-knoppix	ardchoille	I know how they work, I made the partition wrong... I see what you're saying, though, it's just the wrong way I made the partition.
