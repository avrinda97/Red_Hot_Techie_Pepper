2008-01-07T17:51:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	problem is i have no cd drive
2008-01-07T17:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	you have USB ports? it can be done, but it's difficult (I had the same problem)
2008-01-07T17:52:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	so what i have done i have created a fat32 partion with the complete cd on it
2008-01-07T17:53:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	i do have USB ports as well as USB cd
2008-01-07T17:53:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	does your usb cd work in linux?
2008-01-07T17:54:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	trouble is the machine is without OS and i boot from DOS diskette
2008-01-07T17:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	if you can plug the usb cd in and use a grub floppy, you might be able to boot from the usb cd drive, which would solve the problem
2008-01-07T17:55:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	been there done that ;)
2008-01-07T17:55:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	no luck?
2008-01-07T17:56:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	if i just could find out which file to kickstart from within DOS trouble would be solved
2008-01-07T17:56:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	I've never used DOS, so I can't help you there
2008-01-07T17:56:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	thx anyway matey
2008-01-07T17:56:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	no problem.
2008-01-07T18:04:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	what I did was I got a 1gb usb key, and used dd to write the image straight to the usb key (ie, dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdx1) and then plugged the usb key in, used a grub boot floppy to boot from it, messed around in /dev (moved the cd device to hdc-1 and then mv'ed the usb key (sdx1) to hdc) and then proceeded to install as normal
2008-01-07T18:06:00.000Z	aknot	compwiz18	problem is that its an old LB 112 ;) and dont support USB boot
2008-01-07T18:06:00.000Z	compwiz18	aknot	that's why the grub cd :)
