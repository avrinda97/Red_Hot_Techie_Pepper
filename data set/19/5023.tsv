2010-01-28T11:09:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	hmm, have you got a live cd ?
2010-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	i do, but i actually booted to another partition i still had
2010-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	so can you access your ""crypted"" files ? ? are they mountable ?
2010-01-28T11:18:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	yes i can access them.  I mounted, chroot, update, and i'm gonna run update-initramfs -u when this upgrade is done
2010-01-28T11:19:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	good approach, else update grub another try
2010-01-28T11:19:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	I am wondering if the computer doesn't actually think my harddrive is encrypted, but is actually hung up on whatever the next part of the boot sequence is
2010-01-28T11:20:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	is there a command to update grub?
2010-01-28T11:20:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	karmic / grub 2 ?
2010-01-28T11:21:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	LinuxMint KDE 8 touched the grub last... i'm not sure if it is grub 1/2
2010-01-28T11:22:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	if you got a file : /etc/default/grub,    its grub2 , then can do sudo update-grub
2010-01-28T11:23:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	thanks             Thank you cyqotiq
2010-01-28T11:25:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	sudo update-grub 'Cannot find list of partitions!'
2010-01-28T11:26:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	same harddrive?
2010-01-28T11:27:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	yeah one hard drive, i entered the command on my chrooted partition
2010-01-28T11:28:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	still a little more to do : http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-01-28T11:30:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	but beforehand, check if initramfs hasn't resolved it, grub is before cryption is called, so posibly still in order (though wrong labels there can cause that behaviour, too)
2010-01-28T11:31:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	okay.  had success with updating grub from your link.. i didn't mount /sys for chrooting
2010-01-28T11:32:00.000Z	kingbilly	DasEi	going to restart. thanks for the help *crosses fingers*
2010-01-28T11:32:00.000Z	DasEi	kingbilly	yess
