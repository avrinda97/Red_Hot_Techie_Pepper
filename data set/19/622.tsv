2011-11-12T17:42:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	I don't think a sector get marked broken unless it really is.
2011-11-12T17:46:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	who says bad sectors? S.M.A.R.T?
2011-11-12T17:47:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	no gparted does something with ntfsresize and tells me that there is at least one bad sector and to do a chkdsk /f /r and reboot twice
2011-11-12T17:48:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	dr_willis: is there a good tool to check the entire hard drive before sending it back?
2011-11-12T17:49:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	check out what palipsest says about it. System -> Administration -> Disk Utility
2011-11-12T17:50:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	i´m currently not on that machine but i will take a look in diso utility
2011-11-12T17:51:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	it gives a clear SMART report, bad sector count, and everything.
2011-11-12T17:52:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	so if smart says the hard drive has got a bad sector than i can send my hard drive back?
2011-11-12T17:53:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	I guess so, yeah. A brand new drive should NOT have any bad sector.
2011-11-12T17:54:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	if SMART says it's fine, then you might just have to zero the drive entirely, and repartition it.
2011-11-12T17:55:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	I am not sure if dd copies the bad sectors too, and the "good" hard drive thinks that it´s broken
2011-11-12T17:56:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	if SMART says there are bad sectors, then they are MARKED as bad sectors. But what gparted tells you is that there's corrupted data on the ntfs partition, which could be caused by dd'ing from a faulty disk
2011-11-12T17:57:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	so if I delete the content from the new hard drive and use dd_rescue it could work again?
2011-11-12T17:58:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	yep! There's a good chance! But before that just take a look at the SMART report to make sure your new disk is healthy.
2011-11-12T17:58:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	But windows should repair itself by chkdsk /f /r or not?
2011-11-12T17:58:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	can't be too cautious.
2011-11-12T18:02:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	chkdsk would have trouble repairing dd'ed datas. ddrescue'ed on the other hand are a bit more complete, so it'll be repairable by chkdsk
2011-11-12T18:03:00.000Z	MeMyself	apwbdjp	dr_willis: ok thank you for you help i will look at smart if smart shows that there is an error i will send it back if not i will try ddrescue and not dd_rescue
2011-11-12T18:04:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MeMyself	Nice then! You're welcome!
