2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	bieb		how can I connect to an ubuntu box remotely like 'rdesktop" in win
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	use vnc
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	you'll need a vnc server on one machine and a viewer on the client machine
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	vnc or tightvnc?
2009-01-27T00:25:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	in the ubuntu repos are vnc4server and vnc4client
2009-01-27T00:29:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	what I am trying to do is replace my Win (at work) box with Ubuntu. I will have to run win in vmware or something, need the win server tools for administration of exchange and other things.  So VNC should be my best way to remote in and open vmware from home to do admin work?
2009-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	that should work
2009-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	how familiar are you with vmware?
2009-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	have vmware-server v200 running
2009-01-27T00:32:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	comes with great admin interface, which before only was in the paid versions. Let me give you a link..
2009-01-27T00:35:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	you find that link??
2009-01-27T00:35:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	one moment :)
2009-01-27T00:37:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	I seem to have lost that bookmark somehow :(
2009-01-27T00:40:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	well, not exactly the link I was looking for, but most of it is the same for setting it up in 8.x ubuntu: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183209
2009-01-27T00:41:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	how about this one... http://wilsont3ch.com/vmware-server-v200-build-122956/

2009-01-27T00:42:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	will I be able to share the USB printer between ubuntu and the guest OS?
2009-01-27T00:42:00.000Z	oCean_	bieb	yep
2009-01-27T00:54:00.000Z	bieb	oCean_	should I follow the server 2.0 direction or the server 1.0.6??
