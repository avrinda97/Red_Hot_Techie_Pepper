2005-09-21T14:49:00.000Z	mdke		does anyone know where the account details get saved for evolution? I need to transfer my evolution to another computer
2005-09-21T14:49:00.000Z	meuserj|work	mdke	is should all be in .evolution
2005-09-21T14:50:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	i copied that across but my accounts are not there
2005-09-21T14:50:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	everything works except for that
2005-09-21T14:50:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	i also copied across the .gnome2_private/evolution file
2005-09-21T14:50:00.000Z	meuserj|work	mdke	oh yeah.. that's right hold on, let me check something
2005-09-21T14:51:00.000Z	meuserj|work	mdke	it looks like it keeps it in gconf
2005-09-21T14:52:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	eww
2005-09-21T14:53:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	ok i did that, still nothing, should i restart gnome?
2005-09-21T14:54:00.000Z	meuserj|work	mdke	yeah, and make sure gconfd shuts down too
2005-09-21T14:55:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	all right *sigh*
2005-09-21T14:55:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	they should really make it easier to migrate!
2005-09-21T14:57:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	still nothing :(
2005-09-21T15:00:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	recreate them manually do you think?
2005-09-21T15:01:00.000Z	meuserj|work	mdke	still didn't work?? odd... yeah it looks like that is all you can do...
2005-09-21T15:01:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	k
2005-09-21T15:04:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	found the answer in #evolution on gimpnet
2005-09-21T15:05:00.000Z	mdke	meuserj|work	you have to stop the gconf daemon while copying and e-d-s too
2005-09-21T15:06:00.000Z	meuserj|work	mdke	ah.. makes sense.. I should have thought of that....
