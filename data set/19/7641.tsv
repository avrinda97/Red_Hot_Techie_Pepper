2007-07-26T05:01:00.000Z	professor		Hey guys I was wondering what is the best way to configure ubuntu, Im a noob and was wondering how do I find out if everyting is working
2007-07-26T05:02:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	one way that I have noticed is to go to System->Administration->System Log and see if errors are showing up there.
2007-07-26T05:03:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	yea there is
2007-07-26T05:03:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	I have an Edubuntu system that keeps trying to start some fan somewhere.  Quite annoying.
2007-07-26T05:04:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	var/run/cups/certs
2007-07-26T05:04:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	is that related to an error you are getting?
2007-07-26T05:05:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	oh i was just curious how I know everything is working, cause in device manager, some stuff says the name but for capabilities it says unknown
2007-07-26T05:06:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	oh ok.  cups has to do with printing from my limited knowledge.
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	is there more info in the error ?
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	I've installed on an early P4 Intel motherboard/chip and so far everything is running pretty good.
2007-07-26T05:08:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	 yea it says creating a missing directory, and then exactly what I told you.
2007-07-26T05:09:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	are you running from the live cd or did you do the install ?
2007-07-26T05:09:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	I installed
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	unfortunately with my knowledge at this time, i don't know that there is a single location to tell if everything is good to go.
2007-07-26T05:11:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	I just know this computer runs fine with whatever I've thrown at it, and my Edubuntu Server has that darn fan error message in System Log. :-(
2007-07-26T05:13:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	another question do you know how to use wireshark
2007-07-26T05:13:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	to test your wireless
2007-07-26T05:13:00.000Z	Kawika	professor	I haven't used that one.  My installs are all desktop computers connected via ethernet.
2007-07-26T05:14:00.000Z	professor	Kawika	oh ok
