2005-12-09T07:36:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	your nick is very confusing for dyslexic people. >_>;;;
2005-12-09T07:36:00.000Z	dabaR	MickMcMack	why is that?
2005-12-09T07:37:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	I think because the da ba, d's and b's can get confusing. And the R is at the end, so together with the b/d - it just looks all WOOOOO!
2005-12-09T07:38:00.000Z	dabaR	MickMcMack	are you dyslexic?
2005-12-09T07:38:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	yessir.
2005-12-09T07:41:00.000Z	dabaR	MickMcMack	so my nick causes you pain?
2005-12-09T07:41:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	I wouldn't say pain - it's just confuddling at times. :o
2005-12-09T07:42:00.000Z	dabaR	MickMcMack	you think I should change it?
2005-12-09T07:42:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	nononononono. Not at all.
2005-12-09T07:42:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	if people change themselves just to suit others, we wouldn't be individuals anymore. >_<
2005-12-09T07:43:00.000Z	dabaR	MickMcMack	well, I dont want to cause trouble to poor dyslexic people.
2005-12-09T07:43:00.000Z	MickMcMack	dabaR	do I detect a hint of minty sarcasm? :o
