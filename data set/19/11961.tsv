2006-04-14T15:18:00.000Z	jenda		Can someone educate me a bit on creation of a safe-enough but not annoyingly complex or long passphrase for GPG?
2006-04-14T15:19:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	use 8 to 12 characters, include upper characters and at least 2 special characters (#_, etc.)
2006-04-14T15:20:00.000Z	jenda	CosmoDad	that looks more sensible.
2006-04-14T15:20:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	and don't use anything that can be found (either directly or by combination) in a dictionary
2006-04-14T15:20:00.000Z	jenda	CosmoDad	even better point...
2006-04-14T15:20:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	often, people use initial letters of sentences, like "I love to go out for a walk with my dog" turns to "Il2gOfaWwmD0g"
2006-04-14T15:21:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	this is already a somewhat bloated example, but you get the point
2006-04-14T15:21:00.000Z	jenda	CosmoDad	yup :) Now i've read suggestions not to make notes in my PC - I feel using gedit is reasonably safe, if I don't save it, isn't it?
2006-04-14T15:22:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	if you don't save at all, it should be sufficiently safe
2006-04-14T15:22:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	for permanent storage, I suggest encryption
2006-04-14T15:22:00.000Z	jenda	CosmoDad	And is there a good place to test passwords?
2006-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	jenda	CosmoDad	definitely... or memory :)
2006-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	not that I know of
2006-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	I guess there are websites and places like that where you can test passwords...
2006-04-14T15:23:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	but I(!) wouldn't use any password I've entered cleartextly into a website or something
2006-04-14T15:24:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	just follow my tips and maybe look for further on the web and you'll be fine
2006-04-17T12:16:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	out of curiosity (because I don't owe free time), what would that be?
2006-04-17T12:16:00.000Z	jenda	CosmoDad	the Marketing Team
2006-04-17T12:18:00.000Z	CosmoDad	jenda	ok thanks
