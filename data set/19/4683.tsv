2009-01-06T04:55:00.000Z	exodus_ms		is there a way to get the terminal to behave like 'Terminator' without running an emulator?
2009-01-06T04:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	that makes no sense... just install terminator
2009-01-06T04:58:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	explain what you think emulation means?
2009-01-06T04:59:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	I have installed Terminator, just don't want to use a terminal emulator.
2009-01-06T04:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	then how do you intend on running it :/
2009-01-06T04:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	you do realise its built from gnome-terminal
2009-01-06T04:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	which is a terminal emulator
2009-01-06T05:00:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	yes, I rtfm,
2009-01-06T05:00:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	wind the neck in we are just trying to help.. and you misunderstand
2009-01-06T05:00:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	yes, I read the 'fine' manual
2009-01-06T05:01:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	well it certainly does not seem like it..
2009-01-06T05:11:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	You should clarify a little what you mean by "enhance" too.. as it is not specific to anything.. kinda vague
2009-01-06T05:08:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	yeah, your right, i understand you are trying to help, do you understand that I want to enhance the terminal without using a GUI program?
2009-01-06T05:09:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	hmm.. I dunno about that.. but I mean you could try a different WM like awesome or something... not exactly what you are looking for but not far away either
2009-01-06T05:13:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	understood, basically I wanted the terminal to behave similar to irssi, (using split windows but without the need for a separate GUI app),  Terminator and Screen both seem to provide what I'm looking for.
2009-01-06T05:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	yeah.. screen is really nice.. I am a big fan :)
2009-01-06T05:15:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	thanks for you help, really I just wanted a way to read man pages and test commands without switching back and forth between tab/windows etc, I'm sort of lazy :)
2009-01-06T05:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	exodus_ms	no thats not lazy.. thats good thinking.. and nice to see you are getting adventurous
2009-01-06T05:19:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Paddy_EIRE	thanks again for your help and I apologize once again for the quick temp.
