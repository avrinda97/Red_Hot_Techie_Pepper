2009-02-27T22:29:00.000Z	lenswipe	doctor_flash	someone is coming up with viruses for macs now with the popularity of apple computers rising through the ranks
2009-02-27T22:30:00.000Z	lenswipe	doctor_flash	i once read an article that stated that there were about 140,000 viruses and security threats for windows but only 100 for linux... so there you go :)
2009-02-27T22:30:00.000Z	lenswipe	doctor_flash	i guess... idk
2009-02-27T22:31:00.000Z	lenswipe	doctor_flash	im quite glad to hear about the viruses for macs actually because. while i dont have a problem with macs, the apple fan boys really get up my nose, as do any other type of fan boy... lol so it will be a good thing to share with them that their sacred OS is no longer virus free
2009-02-27T22:35:00.000Z	lenswipe	doctor_flash	ubuntu-offtopic i think, wana take this conversation there?
