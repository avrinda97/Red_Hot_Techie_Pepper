2005-01-19T09:08:00.000Z	swim		im having a ridiculous time with lib64 stuff... I need libs such as libglx.a and stuff to compile the nvidia driver...
2005-01-19T09:09:00.000Z	daniels	swim	um, why are you trying to 'compile the nvidia driver'?
2005-01-19T09:10:00.000Z	swim	daniels	because the package doesnt work...
2005-01-19T09:11:00.000Z	daniels	swim	update xorg to 6.8.1-1ubuntu9 (been available for a few hours); reinstalling the nvidia driver won't fix it
2005-01-19T09:11:00.000Z	daniels	swim	the nvidia installer will do weird things with amd64, because it has been designed for red hat, which does amd64 differently
2005-01-19T09:12:00.000Z	swim	daniels	Im using warty... so xfree
2005-01-19T09:15:00.000Z	swim	daniels	do I need hoary to use xorg?
2005-01-19T09:16:00.000Z	daniels	swim	yeah
2005-01-19T09:18:00.000Z	swim	daniels	just change source.lst to hoary? or would it be a lot better to install hoary first?
2005-01-19T09:23:00.000Z	daniels	swim	note that hoary is not recommended if you're not familiar with how to fix breakages
2005-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	daniels	swim	not really, sorry
2005-02-01T10:03:00.000Z	daniels	swim	it would just be a horror to build two versions
2005-02-01T10:03:00.000Z	swim	daniels	so Im just stuck with the older kernel? that sucks
2005-02-01T10:03:00.000Z	daniels	swim	tell me about it :\
2005-02-01T10:04:00.000Z	swim	daniels	so my only hope is that newer nvidia kernels thus ubuntu packages will fix the problem ?
2005-02-01T10:06:00.000Z	daniels	swim	yeah.  apparently breaking older cards is a 'known issue' upstream, and they'll fix it in their next driver revision.
2005-02-01T10:06:00.000Z	swim	daniels	Im not even using an older card! nvidia is driver crazy or something
2005-02-01T10:07:00.000Z	daniels	swim	the joys of binary drivers, eh?
2005-02-01T10:08:00.000Z	daniels	swim	i think the biggest breakages were on tnt2, geforce2, and geforce4 mx440
