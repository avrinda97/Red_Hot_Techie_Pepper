2011-08-09T07:55:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	dont know what you want exaclty maybe "xmodmap" ?
2011-08-09T07:56:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	keybindings isnt what i would succinct
2011-08-09T07:58:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	should be descriped in the according window manager manual so look in the unity manual if you are using unity and so on
2011-08-09T08:00:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	i think their is no such thing as "ubuntu kesyboard" shortcuts normally they are defined thorugh your windows manager
2011-08-09T08:00:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	gtk shortcuts?
2011-08-09T08:02:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	ylour shortcuts should be defined in ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml.
2011-08-09T08:02:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	as i understnad you need to edit the file their is no graphical frontend
2011-08-09T08:02:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	yes, but ctrl+tab isn't defined there
2011-08-09T08:03:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	hmm in my ubuntu ctrl+tab dont do anything, so whereever its defined dont has anything to do with ubuntu, maybe gnome, do you use openboy as a standalone window manager?
2011-08-09T08:03:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	^^
2011-08-09T08:04:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	then configure gedit maybe? or just use vi its far superior in any case ;)
2011-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	gedit is what i'm trying to configure
2011-08-09T08:08:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	so its no ubuntu question  but a gedit one, so of theirs is no such thing as #gedit, than good luck or maybe try in #ubuntu-pfftopic
2011-08-09T08:08:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	i just said it's not a problem in gedit
2011-08-09T08:09:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	but their should be anything bound to it my ubuntu dont do anyhting when i press ctrl+tab
2011-08-09T08:09:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	doesn't do anything in mine either
2011-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	sorry but then i dont have a clue, still think its gedit realted
2011-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	cypha	ldr	how can I do a search for .gtkrc?
2011-08-09T08:12:00.000Z	ldr	cypha	yes and i would say .gtkrc is rather a long shot in any case
