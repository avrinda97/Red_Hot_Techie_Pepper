2007-11-18T06:10:00.000Z	HunterKiller		Can someone please help me? My screen doesn't dim properly when the password prompt or the logout/reboot screen pops up. It only dims the top left two thirds of the screen as though it is detecting the resolution wrong. How can I fix that?
2007-11-18T06:12:00.000Z	HunterKiller		#ubuntu is definitely where I'd go for medical advice.

2007-11-18T06:23:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	how much memory do you have allocated to yoru video card ? make sure it is at least 32 meg that might help
2007-11-18T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	from what I see,  the shading is all over but you seem to have a black section on the uper left,  wich is not the same as what i was expecting to see,  it looks like you have a windows open in that section that overlaps everything else, not sure what it might be
2007-11-18T06:49:00.000Z	HunterKiller	Pelo	No, it's like that whether anything is open or not. I'll take a new screenshot with everything minimized except the password prompt
2007-11-18T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	actualy that looks like your terminal windows
2007-11-18T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	checking , and there is now w in my nick btw
2007-11-18T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	that screenshot looks excatly as I would expect it to look with that background and the panels set that way,  I don'T see anything wrong with it
2007-11-18T06:54:00.000Z	HunterKiller	Pelo	How do you mean? The top left two thirds of the screen is shaded really dark while the bottom and right sides are just barely shaded. That's not how it's supposed to be.
2007-11-18T06:56:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	ok I think I see it,  I thought your top pannel was jsut set to the right ,  no idea what could be the problem, I've never seen anything like it , have you tried different resolutions just to test ?
2007-11-18T06:56:00.000Z	HunterKiller	Pelo	No. I will.
2007-11-18T06:57:00.000Z	HunterKiller	Pelo	Changing my resolution fixes the problem but my native resolution is what I want to run at
2007-11-18T06:58:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	no idea what the issue might be , try checking in the forum for shading problems at 1680x1050, that's all I can suggest
2007-11-18T06:59:00.000Z	HunterKiller	Pelo	Thanks, will do.
2007-11-18T06:59:00.000Z	HunterKiller	Pelo	I don't see any mention of a problem at my specific resolution
2007-11-18T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	HunterKiller	search for shading on shutdown, or similar, thats all I can suggest
