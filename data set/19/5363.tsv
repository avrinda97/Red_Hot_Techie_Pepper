2009-12-24T14:47:00.000Z	nickoe		Where do I download an official *.img of ubuntu?
2009-12-24T14:47:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	we ship ISO images, not .img files these days
2009-12-24T14:47:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	you can use usb disk creator or unetbootin to put the iso onto a usb disk
2009-12-24T14:48:00.000Z	nickoe	popey	okay... bad...
2009-12-24T14:48:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	its a lot easier to use unetbootin with an iso than dd with a .img file
2009-12-24T14:48:00.000Z	nickoe		I just think it was easier to use an img
2009-12-24T14:48:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	you're in the minority :)
2009-12-24T14:49:00.000Z	nickoe		how can it be easier to use unetbootin?
2009-12-24T14:49:00.000Z	nickoe	popey	what about saying that https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles is not used anymore?
2009-12-24T14:49:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	 "dd if=./foo.img of=/dev/sdb" is arguably harder for new users than clicking a couple of buttons
2009-12-24T14:50:00.000Z	nickoe		but otherwise for experinced users...
2009-12-24T14:50:00.000Z	nickoe		The wiki is misleading then
2009-12-24T14:51:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	not really, there are still .img files kicking about, just not many
2009-12-24T14:52:00.000Z	nickoe	popey	what about a notice in the wiki then? I see that there are img for armel.
2009-12-24T14:52:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	a notice saying what?
2009-12-24T14:53:00.000Z	nickoe	popey	that ims are not used for the regular ubuntu install
2009-12-24T14:53:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	which page do you think that notice would be useful on?
2009-12-24T14:53:00.000Z	nickoe		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles
2009-12-24T14:54:00.000Z	popey	nickoe	the first line explains it
