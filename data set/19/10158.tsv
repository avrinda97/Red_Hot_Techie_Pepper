2008-06-06T09:39:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		hi, does anybody know where to get usleep source code for ubuntu?
2008-06-06T09:40:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		I need usleep but it's not in Gutsy
2008-06-06T09:40:00.000Z	micahcowan	ApOgEE-	what, you mean a command line program called usleep?
2008-06-06T09:41:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	i see... because i've tried to compile some but it gets error
2008-06-06T09:41:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	i wonder if i need specific code for ubuntu
2008-06-06T09:42:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	error running gcc usleep.c -o usleep
2008-06-06T09:42:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		i just have the usleep.c files
2008-06-06T09:43:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		i need the source code or maybe pre-compiled if exists
2008-06-06T09:44:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		i couldn't find it, that's why i ask if you know
2008-06-06T09:44:00.000Z	micahcowan		I've never heard of a usleep command... and, of course, the function call would be in glibc (and, probably, the kernel sources).
2008-06-06T09:45:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	i wanna use usleep in my bash script
2008-06-06T09:45:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	but it's not here in gutsy
2008-06-06T09:46:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		usleep is "sleep in microseconds"
2008-06-06T09:46:00.000Z	ApOgEE-		while sleep is in seconds
2008-06-06T09:47:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	i found that usleep is suppose to be in /bin/usleep in other distro
2008-06-06T09:48:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	but i cannot find any packages in ubuntu containing usleep
2008-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	that's why i wonder if i can compile the source code
2008-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	ApOgEE-	gonzoism	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=334173
2008-06-06T09:50:00.000Z	micahcowan	ApOgEE-	y'know, GNU sleep supports non-integral numbers of seconds...
