2010-05-01T10:38:00.000Z	tripelb		idleone I have chrome. So I'll try using only chrome
2010-05-01T10:39:00.000Z	tripelb		I do like chrome IdleOne - I wish it had the noflash option. uses less bandwidth. but I can cope
2010-05-01T10:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	you may as well get through the pain now, if you have a bit of time. I upgraded this one without any major issues, not to menting the old laptop install - all good.
2010-05-01T10:40:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	thanks.
2010-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	wait around 5 months 10.10
2010-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	the grass is always greener in the future.
2010-05-15T10:06:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	sounds like a configuration problem :/
2010-06-20T11:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	did you try from CUPS? localhost:631 ?
2010-07-03T11:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	I'll shove one in there and see, brb.
2010-07-03T11:32:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	The only real diff is status=ready
2010-07-03T11:34:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	nope I dont get that. worked a week ago.
2010-07-03T11:36:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	you are sure the hardware is cool? Have you recently updated your system? What about burning software, changes there?
2010-07-03T11:36:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	neither drive sees. no hardware changes. ubuntu updates.
2010-07-03T11:37:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	I also added gnomebaker and tried that ditto
2010-07-03T11:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	I'd crack the box open, and verify that everything is seated well, and try again first.
2010-07-03T11:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	why?
2010-07-03T11:52:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	I'm not taking it  apart. it worked. I have to pay time warner. if I break the connection it will be dead. It's 2 drives ---wait, it can see a pre-burnt disk so that means it is sitting properly,, right?
2010-07-03T11:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tripelb	yeah, I'd say so.
2010-07-03T11:53:00.000Z	tripelb	greezmunkey	another day
