2005-03-22T16:38:00.000Z	scizzo		you never ever change the permissions with chmod on a win disk....
2005-03-22T16:39:00.000Z	scizzo		still...be very careful with chmod on another filesystem
2005-03-22T16:40:00.000Z	scizzo		if I where you..I would start from the beginning...
2005-03-22T16:40:00.000Z	scizzo		1. Umount the disk that has win mounted on it
2005-03-22T16:40:00.000Z	scizzo		2. go to fstab....remove everything from the user,blaha thingy but not... defaults, umask=0222
2005-03-22T16:41:00.000Z	scizzo		3. look at the persmissions on the mountpoint ls -ld /mnt/windows
2005-03-22T16:41:00.000Z	scizzo		4. change it to the persmissions you want with chmod and chown...
