2007-11-01T14:31:00.000Z	inversekinetix		i need to get mame working , anyone use it?
2007-11-01T14:32:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	what problems are you seeing?
2007-11-01T14:32:00.000Z	inversekinetix	achadwick	most of the games wont work
2007-11-01T14:33:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	you need the ROM files. Ubuntu can't distribute those.
2007-11-01T14:34:00.000Z	inversekinetix	achadwick	i have ALL the roms 1.20u1  its the mame sdl that is old, i need to use sdl 1.20, i managed to get it installed but i need a front end for it
2007-11-01T14:36:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	I ended up rolling my own that shoves icons into the GNOME games menu. That's really all the frontend you need, but I also gave gnome-video-arcade a little try. Didn't work.
2007-11-01T14:37:00.000Z	inversekinetix	achadwick	 I have ALL the artwork for mame, i want to use it in a front end
2007-11-01T14:40:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	I can't really recommend any because I don't use them. Assume you have sdlmame set up correctly with the right directory layout and a properly configured mamerc somewhere. Most frontends should pick up on that. Google, I suppose.
2007-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	inversekinetix	achadwick	 i dont know where it put the mame cfg file
2007-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	the old xmame packaes used /etc/xmame/xmamerc and a local copy in your $HOME/.xmame/xmamerc . Assume sdlmame is something like that; that said, I get by with the Debian xmame-sdl packages.
2007-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	inversekinetix	achadwick	 xmame is way outdated, i dont have enough space to move 80GB of roms to my linux drive, i need to modify the paths manually
2007-11-01T14:47:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	try looking in the files I mentioned, substituting "sdl" for "x". I'm assuming you're using something like http://wallyweek.altervista.org/
2007-11-01T14:48:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	copy the master *mamerc to your home in the place where sdlmame expects it to be. Modify that copy with  text editor.
2007-11-01T14:50:00.000Z	inversekinetix	achadwick	thanks, i just tried modifying it but it tells me im not authorized to make changes to the file, Im getting tired of all this b.s
2007-11-01T14:51:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	you copied the file to your home, right? You can edit that.
2007-11-01T14:53:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	it's done that way for basic system security reasons.
2007-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	System > Preferences > Main Menu
2007-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	right button, unmount first
2007-11-01T15:19:00.000Z	achadwick	inversekinetix	now *that* sounds like a bug rather than user error.
