2011-01-06T23:32:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	so have you run sudo apt-get -f install ?
2011-01-06T23:33:00.000Z	glaceman	gobbe	i tried sudo apt-get -f install
2011-01-06T23:33:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	and what happened?
2011-01-07T01:23:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	which wireless adapter you are trying to get working and which version you are running?
2011-01-07T01:24:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	like i told you earlier, this channel is for ubuntu, not for backtrack
2011-01-07T01:24:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	well, we cannot help with that
2011-01-07T01:25:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	you could also try general linux-channel
2011-01-08T02:09:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	yes
2011-01-08T02:09:00.000Z	gobbe	glaceman	/etc/fstab
