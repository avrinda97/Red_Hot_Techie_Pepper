2005-04-24T11:42:00.000Z	cnes0red		ok I'm back.
2005-04-24T11:42:00.000Z	cnes0red		next, how do I get some decent fonts? The ones I see in xchat are utterly sucky.
2005-04-24T11:43:00.000Z	cnes0red		I honestly can't distinguish , from .
2005-04-24T11:44:00.000Z	cnes0red		then $apt-get install ttf-freefont
2005-04-24T11:44:00.000Z	cnes0red		?
2005-04-24T11:45:00.000Z	cnes0red		the fonts all seemed so biiig and blocky on my 1024x768 resolution.
2005-04-24T11:46:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	the DPI should be set to the real DPI of your screen.
2005-04-24T11:46:00.000Z	cnes0red	Blissex	how can I determine the dpi of my screen ?
2005-04-24T11:47:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	measure the width of your screen in inches, divide the numbers of pixels by that.
2005-04-24T11:47:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	depends on what is the real DPI of your screen.
2005-04-24T11:47:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	and a little annoying misfeature in X.
2005-04-24T11:49:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	so it should be OK, but there is a terrible little misfeature; if you are using standard bitmaps X fonts, the X server forces the DPI to be either 100 or 75, even if the screen is 85DPI.
2005-04-24T11:50:00.000Z	cnes0red	Blissex	so I should download some funkier fonts with apt-get ?
2005-04-24T11:50:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	depends on which ones you are using.
2005-04-24T11:50:00.000Z	cnes0red	Blissex	how do I tell which font package I'm using?
2005-04-24T11:51:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	the bad news is that depends on which application you are using.
2005-04-24T11:51:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	for GNOME applications, look at the control panel.
2005-04-24T11:52:00.000Z	cnes0red	Blissex	where is the control panel?
2005-04-24T11:53:00.000Z	Blissex	cnes0red	in the main menu, may be called ''Settings'' or something similar.
