2008-04-27T00:14:00.000Z	jburd		Does hardy have a firewall blocking 53 by default?
2008-04-27T00:14:00.000Z	jburd		port*
2008-04-27T00:15:00.000Z	jburd		I'm trying to set up a caching dns server on one machine but can't reach it
2008-04-27T00:17:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	no ports are blocked by default.
2008-04-27T00:18:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	check that the dns server is listening on the right interface.
2008-04-27T00:19:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	or ip, some daemons want a ip instead of a interface to get the ip from
2008-04-27T00:19:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	it is listening on eth0
2008-04-27T00:19:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	trying the ip now
2008-04-27T00:20:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	hmm... stupid question are you using the right ip to use to lookup?
2008-04-27T00:20:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	yes I am
2008-04-27T00:20:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	this is a pdnsd instance
2008-04-27T00:21:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	i what?
2008-04-27T00:21:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	oh lol sorry
2008-04-27T00:21:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	it's a persisting caching dns server
2008-04-27T00:22:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	I get proper results with 127.0.0.1, that is weird.
2008-04-27T00:23:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	however, with the ip address assigned to eth0 I don't
2008-04-27T00:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	hmm well i've never used pdnsd (or any other dns server), though i've done stuff with having to deal with intefaces and stuff
2008-04-27T00:24:00.000Z	Ashfire908	jburd	you could check you iptables with "sudo iptables -L". that will list the iptables firewall settings
2008-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	jburd	Ashfire908	sure
