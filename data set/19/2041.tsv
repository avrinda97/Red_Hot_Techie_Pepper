2010-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	oly562		gotta a quick desktop network question. when I turn on my computer, connected via eth0. I would like to be able to log into it without having to log into locally. I just want to be able to turn the power on, let it boot up, sit at another computer and log into via ssh and do my stuff.    Is there a way to automajically have the network up and ready to log into remotely?

2010-08-11T10:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	oly562	why do you have to login locally?
2010-08-11T10:13:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	well not really, I did default, and I can log in with out logging in locally first, which evokes the eth0
2010-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	don't know, that's what im trying to find out
2010-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	every other "nix" I have used, other than solaris, does so, this new 10.x doesnt, at least for my box
2010-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	oly562	you can or cannot log in ssh without being logged in locally?
2010-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	I can not log in ssh first, no, I need to log in to the gui locally first.  sighs...
2010-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	is this a sudo service thing?
2010-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	envoking the start up services
2010-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	oly562	no, perhaps you need to make the connect available to the whole system in network manager, right click on icon, edit connections
2010-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	yah, ic your point
2010-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	maybe
2010-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	but im loggin in with only one log in, and it's the same user remote im using
2010-08-11T10:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	oly562	network manager applet only runs when you log in locally, the connection won't be established, you need to make it system wide
2010-08-11T10:20:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	where can I do that from ssh, im logged in now, after logging in locally first. I should goto /etc/network/interfaces...
2010-08-11T10:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	oly562	remove network manager, edit /etc/network/interfaces , will only take a couple of lines
2010-08-11T10:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	oly562	ah don't remove it now, will log you out
2010-08-11T10:21:00.000Z	oly562	ilovefairuz	correct
