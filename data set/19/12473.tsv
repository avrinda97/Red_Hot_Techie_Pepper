2007-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	In_Silico		does nothing
2007-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	In_Silico		it's a downloaded and unpacked Apache 2.0.50 archive

2007-12-20T04:00:00.000Z	In_Silico		that's why i'm confused
2007-12-20T04:01:00.000Z	mneptok	In_Silico	what command are you using to delete this stuff?
2007-12-20T04:01:00.000Z	In_Silico		yeah, no kidding. I used lynx to download the package, and it opened automatically with some package program, but there was some Gnome error and it wouldn't let me save anywhere but the root drive, so I saved a copy of the archive as to my home folder, and unpacked to the desktop - now it has a red lock and I can't even SU it away
2007-12-20T04:02:00.000Z	In_Silico		sure, lemme find it in the log
2007-12-20T04:03:00.000Z	In_Silico	Eagleray	sudo rm httpd-2.0.50
