2005-11-15T17:28:00.000Z	LjL		aven: and then use "gcc-3.4" to compile
2005-11-15T17:28:00.000Z	LjL		aven: or do "export CC=gcc-3.4" when you need to ./configure; make something that needs gcc 3
2005-11-15T17:30:00.000Z	LjL		aven: and what happens if you type "gcc-3.4"?
2005-11-15T17:30:00.000Z	LjL		aven: well, then it *is* installed, and all is well
2005-11-15T17:32:00.000Z	LjL		aven: as i told you, "export CC=gcc-3.4"
2005-11-15T17:33:00.000Z	LjL		aven: yeah
2005-11-15T17:33:00.000Z	LjL		aven: before configure, actually
2005-11-15T17:34:00.000Z	LjL		seems clear enough
2005-11-15T17:34:00.000Z	LjL		aven: yeah, make clean; make dist-clean and then try it all again
2005-11-15T17:35:00.000Z	LjL		Darkheart: i wouldn't do that, definitely
2005-11-15T17:35:00.000Z	darkheart	LjL	Why not?
2005-11-15T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	darkheart	'cause breezy is meant to be used with gcc 4, and bad things may happen if, for example, you tried to build a source .deb
2005-11-15T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	darkheart	just setting "export CC=gcc-3.4" when you REALLY need gcc 3.4 for some reasons seems a decent solution to me
2005-11-15T17:37:00.000Z	darkheart	LjL	Well, that works also. I would have just said to re-link it back when you're done.
2005-11-15T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	darkheart	oh, well yeah, that could be done... i just wouldn't leave it to gcc-3.4 stably. but anyway, setting CC also has the advantage of working in the *specific* terminal you're using; you could even be compiling something *else* in another terminal with gcc-4.0
2005-11-15T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	darkheart	also, you don't need root access
2005-11-15T17:39:00.000Z	darkheart	LjL	LoL Yeah man. I know how it works ;) I just wasn't thinking about using env variables.
2005-11-15T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	darkheart	ok, but i was just trying to justify my opinion :)
2005-11-15T17:40:00.000Z	darkheart	LjL	I think your solution is better. I wasn't thinking...again ;)
