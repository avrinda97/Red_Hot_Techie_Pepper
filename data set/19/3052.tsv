2009-12-02T17:05:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	Will try those see if they behave better
2009-12-02T17:19:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	No luck it seems the drivers are installed but the nvidia tool is saying i don't appear to be using it ... ideas?
2009-12-02T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	i can send you my xorg.conf if you want. I have to use it to make my display run
2009-12-02T17:22:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	What video card do you got?

2009-12-02T17:24:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	and you use SLI?
2009-12-02T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	for somme unknown reason my monitor doesn't tell my system refresh rates so I need to manually fill it in
2009-12-02T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	no but the config will help some
2009-12-02T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	if not you can always rename the folder to use the open driver
2009-12-02T17:25:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	well if i get my visual effects working with this I will be happy
2009-12-02T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	its free to try
2009-12-02T17:29:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	rebooting to to try config

2009-12-02T17:58:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/m7d247e1e
2009-12-02T17:59:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	there is a log there I am curious what you think it means...
2009-12-02T18:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	maybe you need to define which PCI reference it uses
2009-12-02T18:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kcwiro	sudo lshw -C display       should tell you
2009-12-02T18:10:00.000Z	Kcwiro	ActionParsnip	this maybe stupid but I have a dual core on this system... and I see this entry about vmallocsize.... wondering if I should have installed the x64 edition of this
