2007-12-14T09:58:00.000Z	jsu	bulmer	that shouldn't really make a difference
2007-12-14T10:02:00.000Z	jsu	bulmer	im a bit confused, cus i thought that im using PAN not ppp

2007-12-14T10:05:00.000Z	jsu	bulmer	ok thanks for the tip. although i still dont think it has anything to do with ppp. afaik im connecting with a protocol called pan, not ppp.
2007-12-14T10:08:00.000Z	jsu	bulmer	im not argueing, if you say so i guess you know more than me. im quite new to ubuntu and linux just testing to see if i like it, so far its pretty cool expect its useless to me without internet
2007-12-14T10:13:00.000Z	jsu	bulmer	if you say so
2007-12-14T10:15:00.000Z	jsu	bulmer	k, i guess i was just searching for pan straight. anyways iv got some instructions, im going to reboot into ubuntu and see what i can do.. thanks for the help
