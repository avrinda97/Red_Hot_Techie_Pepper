2012-05-13T17:27:00.000Z	Jazanyc		trying to get dolby digital and DTS sorround to work but have not had any luck any suggestions?
2012-05-13T17:27:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	you mean passthrough to an external decoder?
2012-05-13T17:31:00.000Z	Jazanyc	krababbel	have tried the wiki pages with no luck, plus some of the info is way beyond my ubuntu abilities
2012-05-13T17:31:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	pulseaudio probably has wrong default settings for you, like 44.1KHz instead of 48KHz for example. maybe this : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1151680
2012-05-13T17:52:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pulseaudio-discuss/2011-February/008800.html They seem to have an option for passthrough,  there is #pulse channel also and a wiki
2012-05-13T17:56:00.000Z	Jazanyc	krababbel	thanks, no luck with first link.
2012-05-13T17:57:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	don't forget to logout for the local defaults to apply, maybe even reboot :)
2012-05-13T17:57:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	you can also restart the daemon maybe, not sure how ubuntu does that
2012-05-13T18:01:00.000Z	Jazanyc	krababbel	not to proficient in ubuntu or linux for that matter, trying to switch from windows but having issues. windows is definitely more user friendly
2012-05-13T18:01:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	make dir? you mean in the ubuntu forum thread? the third post could work, but look at the wiki or ask in their channel. There are also terminal commands pacmd and paplay, which may help.
2012-05-13T18:03:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	it is, I scratched my head when pulse was about to be ready, but still not default. now in ubuntu at least it should be installed correctly, you just need to change the default ouptut settings. Also maybe the video player could be a problem. Never used passthrough, but multichannel analog.
2012-05-13T18:05:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	the audio hardware should be compatible too
2012-05-13T18:05:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	if paplay can play it back, then you know it should work according to pulseaudio
2012-05-13T18:07:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	well paplay would rule out any bugs in playback programs, better go step by step to save you time
2012-05-13T18:09:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	you have it, it comes with pulse, best used for testing like this

2012-05-13T18:12:00.000Z	Jazanyc	krababbel	thanks I'll try that link
2012-05-13T18:13:00.000Z	Jazanyc	krababbel	not sure what happened but I think I removed pulse when I tried that first link you send me
2012-05-13T18:14:00.000Z	krababbel	Jazanyc	well revert that and reboot, pulse isn't the problem probably and ubuntu is meant to use pulse
