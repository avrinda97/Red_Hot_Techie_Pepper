2006-11-28T08:15:00.000Z	Megaqwerty		Okay, during study hall I stupidly allowed someone on my computer so they could experience linux. Big mistake. Now my menu is all messed up (on the right side of the screen with the power button and the like). Can someone please tell me how to re-arrange it?
2006-11-28T08:16:00.000Z	ezenu3	Megaqwerty	you can drag the entire panel from one side of the screen to another, and you can right click on one of the icons to move it, often
2006-11-28T08:17:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	that's not applicable...hold on I'll upload a screenshot to the net...

2006-11-28T08:20:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	do you see what I'm talking about?
2006-11-28T08:21:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	are you there?
2006-11-28T08:22:00.000Z	ezenu3	Megaqwerty	to fix the power button itself, can you right click on it, uncheck the Locked box, then right click and do "Move" and drag it to where you want?
2006-11-28T08:22:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	okay, so lemme show you a picture of how it was before all of this. The separator is all messed up as well.
2006-11-28T08:24:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	nevermind, I can't find one. However, I wish to know how to fix that separator.
2006-11-28T08:26:00.000Z	ezenu3	Megaqwerty	you should also be able to not only right click on one of those items (including the separator), but you can right click, then click on remove, then add it again, but right clicking and doing "add to panel".. I don't know of any automated method of restoring a previous known 'good' config
2006-11-28T08:27:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	Thank you so much, It was unlocking that seperator.
2006-11-28T08:27:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	seriously my utmost gratitude.
2006-11-28T08:28:00.000Z	ezenu3	Megaqwerty	lol, ok. at least your friend didn't really screw up your settings
2006-11-28T08:28:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	yeah, that would have killed me. My life is becoming assimilated into that which is Ubuntu
2006-11-28T08:34:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	it looks like he deleted one of my seperators :-( do you know how I could add another one? (the seperator at the end of the list of stuff doesn't look like the default one)
2006-11-28T08:34:00.000Z	ezenu3	Megaqwerty	right click on panel, then select "Add to panel". At the bottom of the list is the separator element
2006-11-28T08:35:00.000Z	Megaqwerty		 ezenu3: if you look at the parenthesis at the end of my last statement, I stated that that seperator doesn't look like the default one (none of those dots, just a line)
2006-11-28T08:37:00.000Z	ezenu3	Megaqwerty	maybe "Notification Area"
2006-11-28T08:38:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	ezenu3	Yes, that's it THANK YOU SO MUCH (to everyone else, sorry for the caps)
