2008-03-12T05:56:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	it puts it into a pastebin
2008-03-12T05:51:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	can you boot in recovery mode?
2008-03-12T05:52:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	did it ever work?
2008-03-12T05:52:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	I mean the graphics
2008-03-12T05:58:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	are you sure that's the correct BusID for your card?
2008-03-12T06:00:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	I wouldn't suggest attempting to use a card with no driver
2008-03-12T06:00:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	google the model
2008-03-12T06:02:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	I believe the link he meant was http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/59313
2008-03-12T06:07:00.000Z	cornfused	computer	revert back to an old xorg.cong file to get the standard video card working and try one of the graphical methods. Obviously the manual method isn't working for you
