2009-08-19T05:26:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	try "nmap paissad-server -p 5900-5910"
2009-08-19T05:26:00.000Z	paissad-hp	Ben64	what does this do ?

2009-08-19T05:28:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	try "vncviewer paissad-server:2"

2009-08-19T05:29:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	:)
2009-08-19T05:29:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	just try not to run vncserver as root, not very safe
2009-08-19T05:29:00.000Z	paissad-hp	Ben64	ok i won't do that anylonger
2009-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	"mplayer http://98.124.140.137:8030" should work
2009-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	paissad-hp	Ben64	how did you find the ip adress ? how do you know the port ?
2009-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	thats just for my favorite shoutcast station
2009-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	but you should be able to put any one in there
2009-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	paissad-hp	Ben64	i guess, but if would like to listen to some other stations, how can i proceed (ip adress , port )
2009-08-27T08:54:00.000Z	Ben64	paissad-hp	get it from the .pls file from wherever you want
