2012-05-12T21:47:00.000Z	Fezzler		I have an old AMD K6 26^ computer that ran earlier verisons of Ubuntu fine.  It doesn't have enough power to run newer verisons.  Should I just covert it to a file server?

2012-05-12T21:50:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	you can just install and use the appropriate desktop, the base packages are the same.
2012-05-12T21:51:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	eg. sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
2012-05-12T21:52:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	not if you're not changing the kernel. Installing the desktop doesn't affect the kernel or base packages at all.
2012-05-12T21:53:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	if you want to remove the "ubuntu-desktop" there's some links at the followinf factoid.
2012-05-12T21:54:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	for the most part.
2012-05-12T21:54:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	all the prettines comes at a cost of CPU/RAM use. :)
2012-05-12T21:55:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	if you have ubuntu already, all you have to do is install the desktop. For example for lubuntu 'sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop'
2012-05-12T21:56:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	if you're just going to use it as a fileserver why have a gui at all then?
2012-05-12T21:58:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	is there already data on the machine you want to keep?
2012-05-12T21:59:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	if so back it up, and use the server installation disk. It won't install a gui. Just be sure to add openssh-server. Then you can do all your administration from a remote desktop.
2012-05-12T22:00:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	yeah, I'd go with a fresh server install then. Backup your stuffs, and do a clean server install. Once you can access by shh you can do everthing you need to remotely.
2012-05-12T22:02:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	rsync :)
2012-05-12T22:02:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	make what hard? sorry, not following what you mean.
2012-05-12T22:03:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	yessir, or you can get it by torrent. the follwing factoid will have links.
2012-05-12T22:03:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	ahh yep the do, but that's any proprietary system for you :)
2012-05-12T22:10:00.000Z	wylde_	Fezzler	glad to help :)
