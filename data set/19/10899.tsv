2006-04-26T13:05:00.000Z	dager		or whatever the xorg package is.. (sorry, not on ubuntu)
2006-04-26T13:06:00.000Z	dager		Butterina.. i dont think you can configure zlib1g
2006-04-26T13:07:00.000Z	dager		Butterina.. zlib1g is the library for gzip files, as far as i can recall, so even if you could configure it, it should be working
2006-04-26T13:07:00.000Z	dager		dont quote me, though
2006-04-26T13:07:00.000Z	Butterina	dager	..... why
2006-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	dager		Butterina.. because it's a library runtime
2006-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	Butterina		but when i installed vlc it says that zlib1g installed but not configured yet.. so what can i do with it
2006-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	dager		Butterina.. get zilb1g-dev
2006-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	dager		zlib*
2006-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	Butterina		ok. i'lll try
2006-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	dager		hope so :P
2006-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	Butterina	dager	.... zilblg or zlib???
2006-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	dager		zlib1g-dev
2006-04-26T13:11:00.000Z	Butterina		my totem cant play video
2006-04-26T13:11:00.000Z	Butterina		what plugins it need
2006-04-26T13:11:00.000Z	dager	Butterina	do you have the video codecs installed for whatever format you're attempting to play?
2006-04-26T13:12:00.000Z	Butterina		mpeg, wmv
2006-04-26T13:14:00.000Z	Butterina	dager	... i've install theora, libmpeg 1.2
2006-04-26T13:15:00.000Z	dager	Butterina	I don't normally watch movies on linux (media based on windows partition).. but I think you need the w32codecs package to view a wmv file
