2007-01-25T16:26:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	yes...
2007-01-26T17:11:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	f-spot is tolerable in its way.. what's your problem?
2007-01-26T17:11:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	no problem :-\
2007-01-26T17:11:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	you can't force it
2007-01-26T17:11:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	why not?
2007-01-26T17:12:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	well, why can one not obtain lethal doses of paracetamol from pharmacies?
2007-01-26T17:13:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	not the same thing - besides, this is a CDROM
2007-01-26T17:13:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	livecd?
2007-01-26T17:13:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	no, just a cd
2007-01-26T17:13:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	meh
2007-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	wget :P
2007-01-26T17:33:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	I reckon wget would have a fairly good multi-connection thing, and leeching is likely supported also. see "man wget"
2007-01-26T17:34:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	also - GUI :-\
2007-01-26T17:34:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	you can't use linux properly without the CLI. don't be a baby
2007-01-26T17:34:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	I just don't think that using X to run terminals is a great use of resources
2007-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	well, I suggest you use tty then :P
2007-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	unknown_host_	goodgerster	I like my X server, lol
2007-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	I would look in Add/Remove Programs for something. but they're all rather poor compared to wget
2007-01-26T17:36:00.000Z	goodgerster	unknown_host_	bearing in mind that the GUI is much more a waste of resources
