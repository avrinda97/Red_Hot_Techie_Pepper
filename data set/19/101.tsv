2012-11-16T04:51:00.000Z	ikonia		bad call
2012-11-16T04:52:00.000Z	TomyLobo	ikonia	was that to me? if yes, what do you mean?
2012-11-16T04:52:00.000Z	ikonia		trying to get the drivers from nvidia.com is a bad idea
2012-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	TomyLobo		well the ones coming with ubuntu didnt work, so what else would i do√ü
2012-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	TomyLobo		?
2012-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	ikonia		define didn't work
2012-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	TomyLobo		nvidia-settings says i'm not using an nvidia driver. sudo nvidia-xconfig creates an xorg.conf that sets my X into 640x480.
2012-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	TomyLobo		^ = didn't work
2012-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	ikonia		yes, that means "not using" not "didn't work"
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia		so you need to look at why they are not in use
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia		have you tried to install from nvidia.com ?
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	TomyLobo		yes
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia		then I won't help
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	TomyLobo		it made backups, so i guess i could uninstall it
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia		you can't uninstall it
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia		you need to manually remove every object
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	TomyLobo		then reinstall the nvidia packages from ubuntu for good measure
2012-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia		hence "bad idea"
2012-11-16T04:55:00.000Z	ikonia	TomyLobo	it won't overwrite everything,
