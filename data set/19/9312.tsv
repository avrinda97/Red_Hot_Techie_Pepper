2007-10-22T09:45:00.000Z	MasterShrek		kc it woudlnt have hurt to leave the server one installed tho
2007-10-22T09:45:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	Sorry, but I messed up my ndiswrapper install, and now I can't boot
2007-10-22T09:46:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	try blacklisting ndiswrapper
2007-10-22T09:46:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	How do I do that from the liveCD?
2007-10-22T09:47:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	youll need to mount your ubuntu partition and go edit that file
2007-10-22T09:48:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	Sorry, total newbie here, how do I figure out which is my Ubuntu partition?
2007-10-22T09:51:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	It's definitely sda1. WHat next?
2007-10-22T09:52:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media
2007-10-22T09:56:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	I added "blacklist ndiswrapper" to /etc/modprobe.d
2007-10-22T09:56:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	did it allow you to boot?
2007-10-22T09:57:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	I haven't tried, but does that ndiswrapper entry need the version number in there? Like "blacklist ndiswrapper-1.48"
2007-10-22T09:58:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	no
2007-10-22T10:01:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	Dang, it's stuck in booting again. And I can tell that ndiswrapper is still activeated, because the light turned blue. I'll boot back into the liveCD right now
2007-10-22T10:02:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	Should I just reinstall?
2007-10-22T10:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	you didnt follow the directions correctly for blacklisting ndiswrapper
2007-10-22T10:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	tony_	although you may not have to really blacklist it, if u set it to be loaded during boot, is it listed in /etc/modules ?
2007-10-22T10:06:00.000Z	tony_	MasterShrek	Sorry! I already started reinstalling! D'oh!
