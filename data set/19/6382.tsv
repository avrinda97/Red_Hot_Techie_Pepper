2008-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	tapas		hmm, the libc in edgy complains about my 2.4.36 kernel to be too old
2008-01-30T16:00:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	and it is quite old
2008-01-30T16:00:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	edgy?
2008-01-30T16:00:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	or the kernel?
2008-01-30T16:00:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	the kernel -- it's in the 2.6 series now
2008-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	i know
2008-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	we have a legacy kernel module here
2008-01-30T16:02:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	well, for the sakes of keeping that module you are kind of depriving yourself from a whole bunch of software that requires functionality from the 2.6 kernel
2008-01-30T16:03:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	i know
2008-01-30T16:03:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	do you have any new information for me, too?
2008-01-30T16:05:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	out of curiosity, what's this legacy module you have?
2008-01-30T16:05:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	it's a custom robot control module
2008-01-30T16:06:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	right, and no available alternative for 2.6?
2008-01-30T16:06:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	we are in the process of porting the module
2008-01-30T16:07:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	for the time being we need a 2.4.x system where we can run our software builds from our feisty systems
2008-01-30T16:07:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	and this means glibc >= 2.4 and glibc <= 2.5
2008-01-30T16:09:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	well, i guess with this predicament, it's one way or another, no? i dont think you can have both
2008-01-30T16:09:00.000Z	tapas	unop__	hmm? we got it to work on a gentoo box
2008-01-30T16:10:00.000Z	unop__	tapas	if thats the case maybe you'd like to ask the guys in #ubuntu-devel
