2008-10-16T12:46:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿airtonix: I know, but I think you have me confused with someone else, I never started any discussion about ad blocking
2008-10-16T12:48:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿airtonix: ok, maybe I'm just confused because you are telling me things I already know and/or have no interest of ;)

2008-10-16T12:50:00.000Z	aion	fenerli7	the default resolution for splash is 800*600, when I changed it to 1024*768, grub told that its unsafe to boot with "new window modes" and each time I need to press spacebar to skip this warning
