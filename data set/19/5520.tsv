2008-06-25T11:29:00.000Z	Xavura		Mozbot?
2008-06-25T11:29:00.000Z	Xavura		Custom?
2008-06-25T11:29:00.000Z	Xavura		Supybot? Never heard of that one
2008-06-25T11:30:00.000Z	Xavura		:P
2008-06-25T11:31:00.000Z	Xavura		Ok, just so I'm clear
2008-06-25T11:32:00.000Z	Xavura		I installed Kubuntu from DISC, then installed Ubuntu from KONSOLE, on TOP of Kubuntu
2008-06-25T11:32:00.000Z	Xavura		This isn't going to break anything, right?
2008-06-25T11:32:00.000Z	Xavura		It seems like the tutorial is talking about people who installed Kubuntu from within Ubuntu
2008-06-25T11:32:00.000Z	Xavura		Not the other way around.
2008-06-25T11:32:00.000Z	magnetron	Xavura	we understand your question. they are not on top of eachother at all
2008-06-25T11:33:00.000Z	Xavura		Ok, just checking, I'm relatively new to Linux so
2008-06-25T11:33:00.000Z	Xavura		It's best to be safe

2008-06-25T11:36:00.000Z	Xavura	magnetron	at the end of that long command it has && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-06-25T11:36:00.000Z	Xavura		Isn't that going to overwrite everything?
2008-06-25T11:36:00.000Z	Xavura		and effectively get rid of all my programs etc.
2008-06-25T11:37:00.000Z	magnetron	Xavura	nonono, installing a package doesn't overwrite anything
