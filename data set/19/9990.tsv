2007-05-07T13:09:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		hi, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq.... i haf read this article..on how to add swap space..and they say u can onli add swap files...i jus wanna knoe if it still possible to create swap parition or not..after installing ubuntu
2007-05-07T13:09:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	yes, with gparted
2007-05-07T13:10:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		DarkGuy: i actually have acrionix in windows, can i use that...
2007-05-07T13:11:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	No idea, I don't think so... never used it. I know you can do with gparted under ubuntu
2007-05-07T13:12:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		DarkGuy: so this partitions the ubuntu drive ...onli.. i reckon...
2007-05-07T13:12:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	because, if I'm not mistaken, a swap partition must be added to the Linux system inside itself.. I dunno if it can detect them all at boot, so
2007-05-07T13:12:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	well, I *think* you can resize your ubuntu partition to leave some space for the swap one, I dunno how though
2007-05-07T13:13:00.000Z	DARKGuy		hey, ps/2 rocks xD
2007-05-07T13:13:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		DarkGuy: yeah,man...dats exactly wat i wanna do...
2007-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	well, I'm running a heavy task on my system right now (it even lags when typing x_x) but try looking for "resizing ext3 partitions" or something around those lines
2007-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		cdrlb: as darkguy mentioned, i wanna rezise my ubuntu partition to create a swap partition.
2007-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		DarkGuy: thanks for the input
2007-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	then you could create a swap parittion in the free space - you could do what crdlb says too
2007-05-07T13:14:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	welcome
2007-05-07T13:15:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		Darkguy,crdlb: not left with much free space..for linux... man.. thats why wanna resize my current ubntu parition
2007-05-07T13:16:00.000Z	DARKGuy		hm, good idea
2007-05-07T13:16:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz	crdlb	:) ...newly installed system..not much data or any data to backup
2007-05-07T13:17:00.000Z	ubuntubeginz		crdlb,darkguy: k, thanks guys..will install gparted livecd and try it..
2007-05-07T13:18:00.000Z	DARKGuy	ubuntubeginz	good luck! :D
