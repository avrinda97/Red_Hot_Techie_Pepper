2009-02-08T21:41:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I have read it, it still isn't really clear.
2009-02-08T21:45:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	thanks. I can't just leave it empty by any chance?
2009-02-08T21:47:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	what is the network in there then? :D
2009-02-08T21:48:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I just meant what I should write there. :D
2009-02-08T21:50:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I'm sorry if I'm being ignorant. I just want my connection up and running, it's messing with me.
2009-02-08T21:52:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	it's just a wired network, straight from my card to the wall, and I have a static IP.
2009-02-08T21:52:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I guess that's it? :)
2009-02-08T21:53:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	yeah. Nothing in between, no firewall, no DHCP router.
2009-02-08T21:57:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I understand. Hell, when I first put in the details in the network-manager it worked, then it borked and I uninstalled it so I could install some other GUI network manager, but the IP wouldn't stay the same.
2009-02-08T21:57:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I just put in my IP address, gateway and DNS and everything was go.
2009-02-08T21:58:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	I have, but it still won't work. In ifconfig it looks like it should, but I get "no such host" when I try to ping something.
2009-02-08T22:00:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	yeah I know, I've actually just read that, and it's just the same.
2009-02-08T22:00:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	will have to restart into ubuntu to check again.
2009-02-08T22:02:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	should "auto eth0" be at the top even if I have static?
2009-02-08T22:03:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	be right back then, will check.
2009-02-08T22:04:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	the tutorial?
2009-02-08T22:04:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	oh the one with the example? Yeah, I have.
2009-02-08T22:04:00.000Z	Safe	n8tuser	i actually copied from there.
