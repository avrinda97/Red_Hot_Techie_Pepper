2010-04-30T00:53:00.000Z	FreedomMaster		Help, i have the following situation, i have a somewhat small hard drive, i'm on my laptop, i have hardy installed on dual boot with windows 7, I have been running low on the 7 ntfs partition, how can i shrink a bit the hardy partition and extend the ntfs partition without causing any major havoc? much appreciated
2010-04-30T00:53:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	use gparted
2010-04-30T00:54:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	ok how do i do that?
2010-04-30T00:54:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	boot a live CD ~ and system > admin > Gparted
2010-04-30T00:54:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	 does that = booting from livecd and then going to the gnome partition editor and resizing with the slide thingy?
2010-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	yes
2010-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	that wont mess up either partition will it?
2010-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	as in would you strictly back up?
2010-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	unlsess you loss power in the middle of resizing
2010-04-30T00:56:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	do you happen to know the minimum size for hardy to run on? i.e. harddrive space?
2010-04-30T00:56:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	depends on what you have installed.....
2010-04-30T00:57:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	how do you mean? i have hardy....and lxde
2010-04-30T00:58:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	there are many package~ like office , etc.... so ... ~ how tight is your space?may be time to upgrade youyr hd?
2010-04-30T00:58:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	pocket says definitely not time to upgrade harddrive, besides it being a pain given it's a laptop
2010-04-30T01:00:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	hmmm~ disable window7 hibernate and system recovery ~ uninstall Openoffice in you hardy if you don't use ~ that save you 2GBs+
2010-04-30T01:01:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	what do you mean? my intention is to get the windows 7 partition more space by taking some from the ubuntu hardy partition
2010-04-30T01:02:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	not a  good idea to dual boot on small drive thou if you ask me ;p
2010-04-30T01:02:00.000Z	FreedomMaster	wildbat_10_40	it's not that small, it's over a 100gb
2010-04-30T01:03:00.000Z	wildbat_10_40	FreedomMaster	i told you the method already ~gparted
