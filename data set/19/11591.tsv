2008-01-11T11:22:00.000Z	IcemanV9	char	after you installed the video driver, did you try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" ?
2008-01-11T11:22:00.000Z	char	IcemanV9	Yea, I'm not sure what to put for all of the settings.

2008-01-11T11:25:00.000Z	IcemanV9	char	your video has mesa and mine has ATI (x600); little difference
2008-01-11T11:25:00.000Z	char	IcemanV9	Probably why that other thing didn't work. =P
