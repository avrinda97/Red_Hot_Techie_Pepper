2008-11-08T17:47:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	bah
2008-10-31T17:24:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	have you seen this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook?
2008-10-31T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	ziroday	yep, but it's outdated :/  Apparently it's supposed to work with uvcvideo driver in the new kernel :/
2008-10-31T17:27:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	I thought it would be, you had obviously done the google search before. My bad
2008-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	have you seen this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/251838 and have you got isight-firmware-tools installed?
2008-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	ziroday	yep, but it fails to extract my copy of AppleUSBVideoSupport.  So I never get a isight.fw file.  I was hoping this wasn't needed though.  There's a report from a macbook air user, that his isight works with the uvcvideo driver and doesn't mention running anything
2008-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	well thats all I had. Good luck
2008-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	ziroday	thanks
2008-11-08T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	ziroday	should work ok if you use aptitude to install.  I don't know how good autoremove is now
2008-11-08T18:01:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	dr_willis all right, thanks a lot!

2009-05-25T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	ziroday	evince
2009-05-25T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	ziroday	sort of, I can change the resolution, just not to 1280x800 (I'm not presented with that as a valid mode)
2009-05-25T17:22:00.000Z	ziroday	jrib	heh, well the mactel wikipages have no mention of it
