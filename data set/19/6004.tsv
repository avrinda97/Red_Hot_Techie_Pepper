2008-04-08T12:08:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani		i want to remove the need of passeord intering, when i use "sudo" for a command, ! ;)
2008-04-08T12:08:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	Why do you need to do that?
2008-04-08T12:08:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	cos, i use sudo more :)
2008-04-08T12:09:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani		i know their is a way with editing the "etc/sudoer" file, but i can't remmber that
2008-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	you shouldn't remove the password prompt, just enter your password.  Security is a wonderful thing, and once you get through a week or two, you'll use sudo less and eventually almost not at all (and if you aren't, you may be doing something wrong)
2008-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani		:D i found that way! if anybody like to do that, this is the way
2008-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani		add the following line to "/etc/sudoers"
2008-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani		%<your-user-name> ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
2008-04-08T12:13:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	;) i do that
2008-04-08T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	We know how, its not a good practice.
2008-04-08T12:14:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	but, i use "sudo" more that 100 times in a day, if i use it less :D
2008-04-08T12:15:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	i know, what u mean about scurity, but this is my home PC , by the way, tnx for ur help :*
2008-04-08T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	You're probably doing somethign wrong then.  And you should probably go outside more.  Using the computer for 17 hours every day isn't healthy.
2008-04-08T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	Sudo stores the password for 10 minutes, you know that right?  What are you using sudo for 100 times every day?
2008-04-08T12:15:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	yep, :'(, a bit more, aroung 19 - 20 hour in a day
2008-04-08T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	What are you using sudo with 100 times a day?
2008-04-08T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	AliRezaTaleghani	since, I honestly think you're doing something wrong setup wise.
2008-04-08T12:16:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	cos, i damage my PC more, :)
2008-04-08T12:17:00.000Z	AliRezaTaleghani	Flannel	it's ur kind. :)
