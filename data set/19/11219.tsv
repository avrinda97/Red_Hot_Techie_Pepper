2006-03-09T07:33:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	you were asking about ifconfig?
2006-03-09T07:34:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	nope, i was asking somebody if his ifconfig turned up anything (since his network wasn't working)
2006-03-09T07:34:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	that was me
2006-03-09T07:34:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	oh :)
2006-03-09T07:35:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	what should I be looking for
2006-03-09T07:35:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	well, is there an "eth0"?
2006-03-09T07:35:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	no
2006-03-09T07:35:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	inet, inet6 ,loopback
2006-03-09T07:36:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	is that under the "lo" entry?
2006-03-09T07:36:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	have a look at /etc/network/interfaces. is there an eth0 there?
2006-03-09T07:37:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	I'll be back let me go check. I do know that I can't access my router from within ubuntu if that helps any. Nor can I ping anything
2006-03-09T07:38:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	well, quite clearly your network interface isn't being used at all. we only have to find out why
2006-03-09T07:39:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	Let me go check /network. anything else I should check when I reboot?
2006-03-09T07:39:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	aw, it's the same machine you're using right now?
2006-03-09T07:40:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	well then, first thing i would try "sudo ifconfig eth0", and see if your network starts working (that only has a chance of working if eth0 is mentioned in your /etc/network/interfaces)
2006-03-09T07:40:00.000Z	theplaytpus	LjL	Yes. I would pay large sums of money if someone could give me a live cd right now
2006-03-09T07:40:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	also, let me paste my own /etc/network/interfaces so you can compare it to yours
2006-03-09T07:41:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9696 <- of course, the details (addresses etc) will vary, but at least it should give you a basic idea what it should look like
2006-03-09T07:42:00.000Z	LjL	theplaytpus	if it's similar to mine, *and* your network starts working with a "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" (oh, try also "sudo ifup eth0"), then look at the "auto" section and check that it does bring up eth0/inet automatically
