2006-05-17T16:51:00.000Z	HymnToLife		pianoboy3333> it seems like our boot screen is using a resolution too high for your monitor
2006-05-17T16:51:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	My monitor is using 1280x10243
2006-05-17T16:53:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	settings where?
2006-05-17T16:53:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	yes, it's fine
2006-05-17T16:54:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	I was just wondering if there was a way to not look at an ugly booting and shutdown screen....
2006-05-17T16:54:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	... Even if I got rid of the boot screen, the plain text is still distorted
2006-05-17T16:56:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	what's a CRT monitor?
2006-05-17T16:58:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	no, it's because I use a DVI cable instead of a VGA from my gfx card to my computer, it looks fine on my VGA cable.
2006-05-17T05:00:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	do you know what do to with dvi cables?
2006-05-17T05:01:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	DVI has a better look
2006-12-31T08:48:00.000Z	HymnToLife	pianoboy3333	sudo runs stuff as root, and root can edit anything
2006-12-31T08:49:00.000Z	HymnToLife	pianoboy3333	if I got it correcly, you want to have a user who can do everything BUT edit given files ?
2006-12-31T08:49:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	HymnToLife	correct
