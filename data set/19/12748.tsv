2010-11-18T18:13:00.000Z	J_P		hey all, anyone can help me why this new version of ubuntu does not have permission to mount remote samba point as normal user?
2010-11-18T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 mount via the nautilys file manager? or via the command line with the mount comm,and>?
2010-11-18T18:15:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	cmmand line, like as "smbmount //192.168.0.1/ti /home/cic/net -o username=test,password=test"
2010-11-18T18:18:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	I have message: mount error(1): Operation not permitted; Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs). But in 9.4 works..
2010-11-18T18:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 sounds luike it may be a groups setting. or some sort of security lockdown they did.
2010-11-18T18:22:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	I set +s in mount.cifs (that is default in 9.4)
2010-11-18T18:22:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	but is note default +s in 10.4. Maybe a bug?
2010-11-18T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 that could be considred a security issue. but its your pc. :)
2010-11-18T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 i would imagine it was done on purpose.
2010-11-18T18:23:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	because now normal user can mount points :-)
2010-11-18T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 they could proberly of mounted them via nautilus anyway.
2010-11-18T18:25:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	but that mount not create a mount point in system. And if user need to sabe a page on netwokr, can't see that mounn point understand?
2010-11-18T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 Nautilus puits the samba shares it mounts in ~/.gvfs i belive
2010-11-18T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 id like them to get put in ~/Network/ but thats just me. :)
2010-11-18T18:27:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	not.. that not works.. in open office for example.. save a doc in a network, how? mounting bvia nautilus is not possible..
2010-11-18T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 access teh share via the nautilus file manager, then it should be in .gvfs/ or i just save somewhere and drag it over.. or if i want to get 'fancy'  i use that samba-fuse tool so i have a 'Network' Directory that updates automatically with all the windows machines/shares.
2010-11-18T18:31:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	I will to try that.. Bu I would like something easy, like as a mount point after mounted with cmd line..
2010-11-18T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	J_P	 some would say using nautilus is easy..
2010-11-18T18:34:00.000Z	J_P	Dr_Willis	yes, nautilus is very easy. problem is to use applications to sabe inside networks using nautilus mounted..
