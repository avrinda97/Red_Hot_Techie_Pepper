2011-01-16T23:48:00.000Z	mister_m		what are the differences between gnome and kde? are they interchangable with ubuntu?
2011-01-16T23:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	they are Desktop ENvironments they run on top of the 'core' of ubuntu, they are just graphical layers
2011-01-16T23:50:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	is one faster than the other?
2011-01-16T23:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	gnome is lighter is terms of software footprint, and some would say faster but its only cutting it by about 10-20 mb worth of ram
2011-01-16T23:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	if you wanna go lighter don't use DEs use Window Managers standalone
2011-01-16T23:51:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	DEs?
2011-01-16T23:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	dsektop environments
2011-01-16T23:52:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	ok I see. I just have whatever comes by default, I'm trying to figure out what sort of options there are
2011-01-16T23:53:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	DEs include, GNome kde, lubuntu(though its just 'openbox' as the WM and lxpanel as the panel, xfce
2011-01-16T23:55:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	and the desktop environments are not the same things as window managers
2011-01-16T23:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	they are similar but include a set of applications when installed, many consider this to be 'heavy' as opposed to the lightweightness of WMs
2011-01-16T23:56:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	ah I see. Would it be possible to try KDE or some other DE without installing all the apps that come with it? (I already have the ones that come with gnome)
2011-01-16T23:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	not sure if kde has a 'core' version
2011-01-16T23:58:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	maybe I could try a window manager or two then
2011-01-16T23:59:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	ok, when they are installed you'll have to log out and change the session in gdm
2011-01-16T23:59:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	ok, that is one thing I can definitely handle
2011-01-16T23:59:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	still very new to how all of this works
2011-01-16T23:59:00.000Z	mister_m	aeon-ltd	thank you for your patience
2011-01-17T00:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	mister_m	you're welcome
