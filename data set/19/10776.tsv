2012-11-04T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	why do you think there is an executable hanging ?
2012-11-04T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	http is nothing to do with ping
2012-11-04T00:06:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	if you "know" why are you quoting it as a test
2012-11-04T00:07:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	if you know ping is nothing to do with http, why use it as a test or mention in here, why not troubleshoot the issue
2012-11-04T00:08:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	ok, so the question you have is "I don't know why I can't see web pages"
2012-11-04T00:08:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	first question, is apache running ?
2012-11-04T00:09:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	first question, is apache running ?
2012-11-04T00:09:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	ok, a gut feeling is unacceptable in troubleshooting
2012-11-04T00:09:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	please verify apache is running
2012-11-04T00:10:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	feelings are unacceptable, please verify it's running
2012-11-04T00:10:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	how have you been verifying it so far ?
2012-11-04T00:11:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	ok, you need to look for the httpd process in the proces list
2012-11-04T00:11:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	look for httpd or apache2 in the process list
2012-11-04T00:18:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	you need to pipe
2012-11-04T00:18:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	it's not annoying, but I'd suggest stepping back and reading the basics on bash usage
2012-11-04T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	it will make general advice going forward easier
2012-11-04T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	runderw	it's worth just a few hours delay to get your head around the basics
