2012-03-08T02:04:00.000Z	Nullzie		why is there no scrollbar in the unity terminal?
2012-03-08T02:05:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	iirc, it should be using the same overlay scrollbar that the rest of Ubuntu uses by default.  If you can't even see that, you can change your terminal profile settings to enable it.
2012-03-08T02:07:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	If you don't care for the look of the Ubuntu scrollbars, you can remove the overlay-scrollbar package.
2012-03-08T02:08:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	thanks but Im not seeing any scrollbar in the gnome terminal whatsoever
2012-03-08T02:08:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	I have also enabled it in the profile settings, but nothing happens
2012-03-08T02:09:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	You don't see anything if you move the mouse to the right of the window?
2012-03-08T02:09:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	well a resize icon instead of the cursor but thats it
2012-03-08T02:10:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	hmmm...
2012-03-08T02:10:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	in nautilus i see it light up to a red bar and a little scroll bar appears, but in termal - nothing
2012-03-08T02:11:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	Are you using byobu?
2012-03-08T02:11:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	not sure what that is. this is a fresh oneiric install
2012-03-08T02:12:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	Its bascially a set of presets for screen.
2012-03-08T02:12:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	its gnome terminal 3.0.1 if that helps
2012-03-08T02:13:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	Can you try running byobu-disable to see if that fixes anything?
2012-03-08T02:13:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	ok
2012-03-08T02:14:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	its byobu isnt installed
2012-03-08T02:15:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	could it have something to do with compiz wobble effect?
2012-03-08T02:17:00.000Z	Pici	Nullzie	it shouldnt.  You could try disabling the fancy scrollbar overlay, but I'm just guessing at this point.
2012-03-08T02:18:00.000Z	Nullzie	Pici	tried with byobu terminal but same issue
