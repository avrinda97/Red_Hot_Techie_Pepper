2010-09-15T23:08:00.000Z	Licuadora		Ok. I am back
2010-09-15T23:08:00.000Z	Licuadora		I aked how to install a GPU driver
2010-09-15T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 which video card do you have?
2010-09-15T23:09:00.000Z	Licuadora	coz_	QuadroFX 580
2010-09-15T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	  ok you should have nvidia_current   under system / administration / hardware drivers
2010-09-15T23:09:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 install that ...reboot... and see if it works well
2010-09-15T23:10:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 well there is a 260 driver but mm hold on
2010-09-15T23:11:00.000Z	Licuadora	coz_	Well Ubntu not always has the latest in their repositories
2010-09-15T23:11:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 well in the x-updates ppa  the 260.19.04  nvidia driver is available but I have never used that ppa
2010-09-15T23:11:00.000Z	Licuadora	coz_	Like, Blender, they still have 2.49 when the 2.53 version is already out there
2010-09-15T23:12:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 well I believe the x-update ppa would have most of the recent drivers    and as for blender you can compile that manually if you want or see if there is an ubuntu ppa for blender
2010-09-15T23:12:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	   here is the x-update PPA    https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates
2010-09-15T23:14:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	   http://developer.nvidia.com/object/opencl-download.html
2010-09-15T23:16:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 I agree   about the ppa
2010-09-15T23:16:00.000Z	Licuadora	coz_	I already doenloaded the 190.29 drivers, but i need to installed
2010-09-15T23:16:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 well  if you downloaded from nvidia you are going to jump through a few hooops to get that installed
2010-09-15T23:16:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 that is an older driver anyway
2010-09-15T23:17:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 probably not
2010-09-15T23:17:00.000Z	coz_	Licuadora	 if you do  I would use the x-update ppa  for safety
