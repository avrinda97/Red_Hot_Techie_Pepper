2011-08-03T01:54:00.000Z	OmegaForte		Are you even running Ubuntu?
2011-08-03T01:55:00.000Z	OmegaForte		I just edit xorg.conf because I'mma baws.
2011-08-03T01:55:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	You can still do that, but in some (most?) cases it's not even necessary at all.
2011-08-03T01:56:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	That's what I do, and that's how I does it.
2011-08-03T01:56:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	By all means. :D
2011-08-03T01:56:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	And it saves me time typing in pathnames when I BREAK EVERYTHING.
2011-08-03T01:56:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	Gotcha on that.
2011-08-03T01:57:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	Which I did quite a bit fighting emerald.
2011-08-03T02:03:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	No prob, it was a lame joke anyway. :)
2011-08-03T02:06:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	He wants to switch from pixels to move, to percent of screen.
2011-08-03T02:06:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	Only way I know how to do that is through YAST or xorg.
2011-08-03T02:12:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	Oh? Please do share.
2011-08-03T02:13:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	has gained 5 experience points! Setting wrap modes defines the space the mouse has to travel, not the pixel bias of the resolution!
2011-08-03T02:15:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	You could have just spoken hebrew for all I know, but cool!
2011-08-05T21:34:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	No, he's trying to get an older, compatible alsa package to work with a device that doesn't have support niow.
2011-08-05T21:36:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	Uh oh...
2011-08-05T21:38:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	He has a device that falls under 815006, and I've been trying to figure out a way to get him running.
2011-08-06T00:33:00.000Z	OmegaForte	astraljava	Ahhh...SVN's. I remember those days. Check out, ./configure, make and makeinstall..
2011-08-06T00:34:00.000Z	astraljava	OmegaForte	I was shocked, moving into a new job 5 weeks ago, to learn they still store all code in svn. Together with another up-to-date developer, we're now starting the migration to git. But that's OT, so no more of that.
