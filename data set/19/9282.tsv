2007-08-09T12:04:00.000Z	godzirra		Heya guys.
2007-08-09T12:05:00.000Z	godzirra		I'm trying to get ubuntu installed on my laptop, but its been sitting at the screen that says "Ubuntu" and has the little orange bar moving back and forth underneath for about 20 minutes.
2007-08-09T12:05:00.000Z	godzirra		a gig
2007-08-09T12:06:00.000Z	godzirra		Yup.
2007-08-09T12:06:00.000Z	godzirra		bleh.. ok.  I've got to download it first.
2007-08-09T12:06:00.000Z	godzirra		I was afraid you'd say that.
2007-08-09T12:07:00.000Z	godzirra		<flamewar>Thats because ubuntu's pretty awesome and fedora sucks.</flamewar>
2007-08-09T12:07:00.000Z	genii	godzirra	when it boots to the cd, select whataver one you wanted like Install. then hit f6 key. remove "quiet"    then when it locks up report the last message it gives
2007-08-09T12:07:00.000Z	godzirra	genii	I'll try that.
2007-08-09T12:10:00.000Z	genii	godzirra	Anyhow, if you are getting some message like Intel ISA PCIC probe: not found    letme know
2007-08-09T12:10:00.000Z	godzirra	genii	Actually I got "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off <newline> (initramfs)"
2007-08-09T12:11:00.000Z	genii	godzirra	cycle thru the consoles by alt-f1 thru alt-f7 and tell me if one has any other msgs on it
2007-08-09T12:11:00.000Z	godzirra	genii	F1 says "Begin: Mountying root file system" as the last message.
2007-08-09T12:21:00.000Z	genii	godzirra	The alternate install cd in text mode install with same thing ("quiet" removed by f6 at load) will show in console4 some informative error msg if there is any. also it has a busybox
2007-08-09T12:23:00.000Z	godzirra	genii	The cd I have no had busybox as well.. is that unusal?
2007-08-09T12:25:00.000Z	genii	godzirra	The regular livecd doesn't have it just the alternate one. It is on console 2 and 3 then 4 is the error msgs, etc
2009-02-20T20:29:00.000Z	godzirra	genii	3 burns of bad cds? :p
2009-02-20T20:29:00.000Z	genii	godzirra	"sb_bread failed reading.."
2009-02-20T20:30:00.000Z	godzirra	genii	I'm worried if that the cd or my hard drive.
