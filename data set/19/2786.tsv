2010-01-04T22:57:00.000Z	stevenvu		I was using 9.10 and was accessing a ntfs partition. I was extracting an archive when the computer became unresponsive. couldn't alt ctrl backspace or get into another tty. I turned off the computer. Turns out i curropted the ntfs partition. windows won't boot, tried chkdsk with /r and /f, which came back with the mft could not be recovered. I then tried testdisk on ubuntu which crashed with a mftsegmentation fault.

2010-01-04T22:58:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	i know, turns out ntfs3g aint that robust
2010-01-04T22:59:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	is there anything else i can try
2010-01-04T23:00:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	i'm actually a little peeved. Apparently a currupt mft should only be caused by a physical defect
2010-01-04T23:01:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	getting proper help here is almost impossible, good luck getting your stuff back :/
2010-01-04T23:01:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	I plugged the hdd into another computer running windows and getdataback shows all the files so i should just be able to rebuld the mft but i havn't found a way how to
2010-01-04T23:02:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	I accidentally found like 8 bugs today in 9.10, 5 un-reported
2010-01-04T23:02:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	they really shouldn't include ntfs3g if it isn't ready to be used everyday
2010-01-04T23:03:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	Same goes out for ext4, it still needs a lot of work
2010-01-04T23:04:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	I give ubuntu 3 more years and it's going to be a less-buggy fully functional usable operating system
2010-01-04T23:05:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	Are you using 9.10? Can you check if the bug I reported affects you as well?
2010-01-04T23:05:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	what bug is that
2010-01-04T23:06:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	that]
2010-01-04T23:06:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	the link I just posted https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/503041 check it out and let me know
2010-01-04T23:07:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	thats the bug that i got, when extracting the arcive the computer locked up. After the partition was screwed i noticed the same problem when trying to copy it over to the nas, after copying 30gb the computer slowed down to a crawl
2010-01-04T23:08:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	Then its some ef-up with the clipboard
2010-01-04T23:08:00.000Z	nahs	stevenvu	right feedback or something on that bug so it gets attention/gets fixed
2010-01-04T23:10:00.000Z	stevenvu	nahs	i'm not actually on the computer where i encountered the problem, when i get to it i'll try to reproduce the error,. If youd like me to run a command to get more information then i can but i wouldn't know where to start to track down the problem.
