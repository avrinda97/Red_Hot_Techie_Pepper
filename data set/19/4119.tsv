2009-03-27T00:23:00.000Z	B419kid		I tried looking it up on the internet but couldn't find anything, is there a way to resize my ubuntu partion or do i have to reinstall?
2009-03-27T00:23:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	you can download an ISO disc image you can burn and boot from, and it will let you resize the partitions.
2009-03-27T00:25:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	thanks, um do you have or link or will google do it and/ is there a way also to merge partions beause i think i have some free space not used
2009-03-27T00:27:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	you can delete partitions and merge the space, depending on where it is on the disk.  ultimately yes, possible.  I don't have a URL but google will find it easily.
2009-03-27T00:28:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	Thanks. I got it but if i don't have a disc is there a way to do it on an operating system (mac or linux) or must i use a seperate bootable thing
2009-03-27T00:28:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	you can do it on a running Linux system, it's just more dangerous.
2009-03-27T00:28:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	and I imagine it's possible to install it on a bootable USB flash drive.
2009-03-27T00:28:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	How much space? I don't have a very big usb at the moment
2009-03-27T00:29:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	Honestly not sure...
2009-03-27T00:31:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	and dangerous? meaning lose of data possible?
2009-03-27T00:31:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	possible.  not likely, but possible.  far less likely if you boot from the parted CD.
2009-03-27T00:32:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	Can i install it on my disk as a seperate partion?
2009-03-27T00:32:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	there's a channel on here about it.  #parted ... and theoretically you could install a Linux system on a spare partition and resize the other partitions, but that's getting complex.
2009-03-27T00:35:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	ill join the parted channel thanks
2009-03-27T00:35:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	they could give you much more direction than I could I suspect.  one option is to borrow an external CD or DVD drive though.  they're pretty cheap.  handy for installing OSes on netbooks too. :)
2009-03-27T00:36:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	the parted channel is quiet, no one is responded
2009-03-27T00:37:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	I didn't know how busy it was.  but be patient, someone might eventually respond.
2009-03-27T00:37:00.000Z	B419kid	PhotoJim	no i mean know one there is active: all afk/idle
2009-03-27T00:38:00.000Z	PhotoJim	B419kid	be patient.  often people show up hours later and see your question, and respond.
