2005-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	pestilence		anybody here use fluxbox from universe?  i have a older box that i would like to run fluxbox on, and the version in universe is *extremely* slow...slower than KDE (and that's saying a lot...this is a 300 mhz celeron machine)
2005-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	pestilence		i have removed .fluxbox, anything else i could try?
2005-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	pestilence		i don't understand why it's so slow.
2005-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	xoz	pestilence	what about blackbox or openbox? openbox rocks AFAIK
2005-06-22T09:38:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	mainly because i've used fluxbox extensively and so i'm quite used to it
2005-06-22T09:39:00.000Z	xoz	pestilence	they bahave and look similar. openbox gives you more options.
2005-06-22T09:39:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	i'll give it a shot.
2005-06-22T09:42:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	openbox seems to suffer the same slowness.  strange.
2005-06-22T09:42:00.000Z	xoz	pestilence	hmm... something is not right... what about xfce? or blackbox or wmaker?
2005-06-22T09:43:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	well, i'm starting to wonder what the problem is.
2005-06-22T09:43:00.000Z	xoz	pestilence	maybe, your xserver acceleration support has something to do with it.
2005-06-22T09:44:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	seems possible
2005-06-22T09:45:00.000Z	xoz	pestilence	slow in a sense that moving/resizing windows take time? what's your video card?
2005-06-22T09:45:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	no, it takes a very long time to load up.
2005-06-22T09:46:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	longer than kde, which is depressing.
2005-06-22T09:47:00.000Z	xoz	pestilence	try strace startfluxbox
2005-06-22T09:47:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	but the xserver is doing a lot of work when it loads...so perhaps there is something wrong in the configuration of it.
2005-06-22T09:48:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	ok, i'll do that in a minute.  i want to see what has been said in the forums
2005-06-22T10:07:00.000Z	pestilence	xoz	so what should i do with the trace produced by "strace startfluxbox"?
