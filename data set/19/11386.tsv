2007-01-31T12:35:00.000Z	starz		but your doing something very very wrong
2007-01-31T12:35:00.000Z	starz		open synaptic and push the refresh button
2007-01-31T12:35:00.000Z	starz		it will refresh from repos
2007-01-31T12:36:00.000Z	starz		then go to ndisgtk and install that
2007-01-31T12:36:00.000Z	starz		that will be easiest bet to get the thing installed
2007-01-31T12:37:00.000Z	starz		then: sudo ndiswrapper -da
2007-01-31T12:37:00.000Z	starz		then: sudo ndiswrapper -di
