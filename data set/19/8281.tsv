2007-04-17T12:38:00.000Z	tehxed		How often should I repeat my question? As in after how many minutes should I re-ask for help?
2007-04-17T12:38:00.000Z	Shootfast	tehxed	whats the problem
2007-04-17T12:39:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	I'm having trouble with VLC Player not going fullscreen. I'm running Ubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10 (AMD64 Installation) on an intel d805 2.66GHz(dual core). I checked around and I found the following website: http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=32049 ; which in the end links to http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/changeset/19577 to use as a patch. I am not entirely sure what to do with the last link there.
2007-04-17T12:41:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	It basically maximizes the window.
2007-04-17T12:42:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	I just made some progress! Now, instead of seeing the top bar (Applications, Places, System, etc) AND the bottom bar..I only see the top one!
2007-04-17T12:43:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	How would I go about doing that?
2007-04-17T12:45:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Right, I did that. i selected Xvideo for Video Output
2007-04-17T12:46:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	And then I selected Xvideo and enabled "Alternate Fullscreen Method"
2007-04-17T12:47:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Again, that's what I did to make the progress. Except I can still see the top bar...(Applications, Places, System, etc..)
2007-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	VLC media player 0.8.6 (wxWidgets interface)
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	I thought this was the latest version!
2007-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Thought it might be. =|
2007-04-17T12:51:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Doesn't mplayer require codecs and the such?
2007-04-17T12:53:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	When I try to run a file in Mplayer I get the following error: 'Fatal Error' "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device."
2007-04-17T13:03:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	How do i go about installing these "mp3 libs" ?
2007-04-17T13:04:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Hanging on.
2007-04-17T13:14:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Any luck with my mp3 related issue? (Something about the mp3 libs?)
2007-04-17T13:18:00.000Z	tehxed	Shootfast	Any luck with my mp3 related issue? (Something about the mp3 libs?)
2007-04-17T13:19:00.000Z	Shootfast	tehxed	look into the libxine-ffmpeg
