2011-07-18T19:32:00.000Z	snimavat		one more thing, how do i setup wireless network between ubuntu and my win 7 laptop
2011-07-18T19:32:00.000Z	snimavat		both are connected to a wireless router
2011-07-18T19:33:00.000Z	Traintop	snimavat	just go to "Network" in nautilus :-)(
2011-07-18T19:33:00.000Z	snimavat		files and printer
2011-07-18T19:34:00.000Z	snimavat		the main thing is, i want to share win7 files in linux and vice-versa
2011-07-18T19:34:00.000Z	snimavat	Traintop	what after that ?
2011-07-18T19:35:00.000Z	Traintop	snimavat	if you have installed samba you can easily browse the win-shares via network in nautilus; if you want to share dirs on your ubuntu-machine for win-machines right-click them and go to "Freigabeoptionen" don't know how this is called in english
2011-07-18T19:35:00.000Z	snimavat		okey
2011-07-18T19:35:00.000Z	snimavat		let me try it, does any one know the english name for it, btw ?
2011-07-18T19:36:00.000Z	Traintop		should be something like "share-options" or similar
2011-07-18T19:36:00.000Z	Traintop		in german it's the third entry from the bottom of that context-menu
2011-07-18T19:38:00.000Z	Traintop		in german from bottom there are: "Eigenschaften, Senden an, Freigabeoptionen"
2011-07-18T19:39:00.000Z	Traintop		so in english it should be: "Properties, Send to, Share...."
2011-07-18T19:43:00.000Z	snimavat		shared it
2011-07-18T19:43:00.000Z	snimavat		but still win7 doesnt see the folder.
2011-07-18T19:44:00.000Z	Traintop	snimavat	did you look for "Workgroup", the samba-shares are in this group
2011-07-18T19:45:00.000Z	snimavat	Traintop	how do i do that ?
