2008-02-07T22:56:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut		is EXT3 the best option use when installing ubuntu? as opposed to NTFS.
2008-02-07T22:57:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	installing GNU/Linux (which includes Ubuntu) on NTFS is not going to work out, believe me
2008-02-07T22:57:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	you could use reiserfs or xfs, but ext3 is the de-facto standard
2008-02-07T22:58:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	should not be the reason for that, really, sounds like a bug, but installing on NTFS is not going to work as I said
2008-02-07T22:59:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	a bug with my computer, or with the software? I heard there's an 'alternate' version of ubuntu I can try to download instead, I don't know whether that's wrong or not
2008-02-07T22:59:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	maybe a software bug, but why do you want to create a NTFS partition anyways?
2008-02-07T23:00:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	if you plan on creating a dual-boot environment you should install the other operating system first anyways
2008-02-07T23:00:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	well my drive is NTFS to begin with and I run win xp on here, I only recently found out that linux doesn't get along with NTFS
2008-02-07T23:01:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	so the other OS (windows) has already been installed
2008-02-07T23:01:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	well, you cannot install (or should not) GNU/Linux on an NTFS partition, however, reading and writing should work fine
2008-02-07T23:02:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	if you are trying to resize an NTFS partition make sure you defragmented that partition first
2008-02-07T23:05:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	yep, so last night I downloaded a stand-alone version of gparted and booted off that, and was able to set it so that the half of my HDD with windows was NTFS, and the half I intended to install ubuntu on was EXT3. it got me a little further than before, but crashed once again
2008-02-07T23:06:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	when exactly does the installer crash? you shouldn't touch the NTFS partition at all from within the installer
2008-02-07T23:08:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	it crashed after I'd manually selected in the installer which 'half' (the EXT3 half) I wanted ubuntu to go on. I pressed forward to start it, and it froze after about five or ten seconds
2008-02-07T23:08:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	okay, you might want to download the alternative install CD
2008-02-07T23:10:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	rightio, cool. that's not the LTS one, is it? or the one for serves?
2008-02-07T23:11:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	there should be an alternate install CD for the LTS version too iirc
2008-02-07T23:11:00.000Z	sp	thatoldchestnut	but no, that is not the server version
2008-02-07T23:14:00.000Z	thatoldchestnut	sp	is the alternate version of ubuntu essentially the same as the normal one? I can't quite seem to see a link anywhere to download it
