2004-11-25T13:14:00.000Z	d0gmaz		:P
2004-11-25T13:14:00.000Z	rip024	d0gmaz	I have had trouble before buring ISO so I have saved my self some pain by using ISObuster and then buring disk as data
2004-11-25T13:15:00.000Z	rip024		I'll try ISO burn with nero  cd's are cheap
2004-11-25T13:15:00.000Z	d0gmaz	rip024	yeah but you wont extract the boot sector that way
2004-11-25T13:16:00.000Z	d0gmaz	rip024	if you use the fancy eyecandy nero wizard choose "burn disc image"
2004-11-25T13:16:00.000Z	rip024	d0gmaz	it's buring now
2004-11-25T13:17:00.000Z	rip024		hey is ubuntu a good version for a newbi to try
2004-11-25T13:17:00.000Z	d0gmaz	rip024	yes
