2006-07-19T10:04:00.000Z	Nekow42		today I ran memtest86+ and got 1 error... Ubuntu runs fine, however. Can I continue to ignore it or will this come back to haunt me?

2006-07-19T10:08:00.000Z	Nekow42	runes	It's late now, and my finances might not allow me to get a new stick. I'll have to run at half-mem for a while, eh?

2006-07-19T10:11:00.000Z	runes	Nekow42	check with the store you purchased the memory at cahnces are it may have a lifetime warranty..in that case all you need is the invoice and you ship it to the manufacturer
2006-07-19T10:12:00.000Z	Nekow42	runes	that's where it gets tricky... Newegg purchase...
2006-07-19T10:13:00.000Z	runes	Nekow42	the mem manufacturer will still honour it
