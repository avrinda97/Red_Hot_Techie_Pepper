2009-08-20T15:29:00.000Z	omac		Ok.  For those of you who don't want to lose you keyboard or mouse input, PLEASE DON'T TURN OFF THE "DBUS" SYSTEM ADMIN SERVICE.  Immediately after turning it off, you'll be in a state that you won'd be able to type or use the mouse.  In other words it's ugly, if you don't have an Ubuntu CD/USB Boot disk handy.  To fix it, you need to check out your /etc/init.d/rc2.d/ directory and then make sure the dbus service has S12dbus linked to ../init.
2009-08-20T15:29:00.000Z	omac		d/dbus.  If the file isn't in there, your mouse or keyboard just won't work.
2009-08-20T15:31:00.000Z	omac		lucky for your in BSD, but this dbus service being turned off was ugly.
2009-08-20T15:32:00.000Z	omac		It's hard to go to ctrl-alt-f1 when the keyboard isn't working.
2009-08-20T15:32:00.000Z	omac		good night.

2012-11-07T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	omac	what did you do to try and install the driver
2012-11-07T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	omac	so it didn't work first time and you have done nothing to try and work out what went wrong...
2012-11-07T09:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	omac	try reading the screen, it is telling you stuff
2012-11-07T09:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	omac	you can then take steps
2012-11-07T09:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	omac	did you read the InstallationInstructions_Linux.txt file?

2012-11-07T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	omac	did you read it?
2012-11-07T09:29:00.000Z	omac	ActionParsnip	I'm going to try to install the 3Dconnexion plugin for blender.  That was the piece I was missing.
