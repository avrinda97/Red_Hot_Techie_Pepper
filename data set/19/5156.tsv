2009-01-02T14:39:00.000Z	mayank		torrent paused: disk read error, slot has no storage
2009-01-02T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	how much free space do you have on the partition where you download torrents to?
2009-01-02T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	then i'd run an fsck on the partition, make sure you are downloading to the large partition. If you have made a small partition and are accidentally downloading there it will fill the partition nicely
2009-01-02T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	you can check disk usage with df -h
2009-01-02T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	its a standard command, the disks need to be unmounted so I'd run it from livecd, or theres aswitch you can use on the shutdown command to make it happen next boot
2009-01-02T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	the partitions are still mounted
2009-01-02T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	wine or maybe a loki installer

2009-01-02T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	it also runs aweomse under wine
2009-01-02T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	mayank	theres also a doom client which you can put any .wad in and play doom
