2011-07-09T15:00:00.000Z	latagore		Hi, I want to remap my keys; are there any GUI utilities to do it?
2011-07-09T15:00:00.000Z	Cradam	latagore	you want to remap what the alt key does?
2011-07-09T15:01:00.000Z	Cradam		i hate the alt key because its used by apps i like and the WM i use
2011-07-09T15:01:00.000Z	latagore	Cradam	...Did I ask this before? Because it's creepy that the answer is yes
2011-07-09T15:02:00.000Z	Cradam	latagore	no i just have the same problem and am looking for the same solution
2011-07-09T15:02:00.000Z	latagore	Cradam	How old is your keyboard?
2011-07-09T15:02:00.000Z	Cradam	latagore	its a laptop keyboard
2011-07-09T15:03:00.000Z	latagore	Cradam	Hm, try xkeycaps, it MIGHT work for you. You have to make it load on startup though
2011-07-09T15:05:00.000Z	Cradam		thanks
2011-07-09T15:05:00.000Z	latagore	Cradam	It might not work because the keyboard layouts for it are very old
2011-07-09T15:06:00.000Z	Cradam		the laptop is about 1.5 years old
2011-07-09T15:06:00.000Z	Cradam		budget
2011-07-09T15:06:00.000Z	latagore	Cradam	The keyboards the utility are at least 10 years old
