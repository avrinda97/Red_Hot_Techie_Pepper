2009-12-13T15:27:00.000Z	jean-claude		Hi, I have a problem with usb I think.I am on a old amilo (celeron1.6 512ddr) , the trackpad is ok but when I use an usb mouse when i launch program the pointer is very slow ... I try my scanner and it seems that the scan is slow too .. Someone has an idea of how to slow the prob ?
2009-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	jean-claude		I saw a solution saying to plug the mouse in an ohter usb device but nothing change, I try with a other mouse, same problem
2009-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	Exaltia	jean-claude	look your mouse speed settings
2009-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	Exaltia	jean-claude	i doubt that usb port speed has an effect on a mouse pointer speed, but it could have one on your scanner
2009-12-13T15:30:00.000Z	jean-claude	Exaltia	: the problem is the mouse works fine 90% of the time but when i launch program or do something else it is very very slow
2009-12-13T15:30:00.000Z	jean-claude	Exaltia	: but when I use the trackpad is ok 100% of the time
2009-12-13T15:31:00.000Z	Exaltia		how slow, mouse pointer is moving anytime at the same speed or does it "jump" ?
2009-12-13T15:32:00.000Z	jean-claude		jump yes
2009-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	jean-claude		for example when I launch firefox, the 2 first second it is unusable because it jump , same thing for program so its not linked to firefox
2009-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	Exaltia	jean-claude	looks like this is a performance problem , try to desactivate compiz and so on, the point is that your trackpad is probably on the ps/2 bus, wich requires far less cpu to handle versus usb
2009-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	jean-claude	Exaltia	: I have already disactive compiz etc because yes its a old computer
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	Exaltia	jean-claude	how many ram?
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	jean-claude		yes but when I launch firefox using the trackpad is not sow at all
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	jean-claude		512ddr
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	Exaltia	jean-claude	wich window manager?
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	jean-claude		gnome (?)
2009-12-13T15:35:00.000Z	jean-claude	Exaltia	: I was using ubuntu 8.10 last week, same problem. Now 9.10 exactly same prob
2009-12-13T15:36:00.000Z	Exaltia	jean-claude	try to install a lighter weighted desktop manager (window manager?) like xfce or equivalent, and test, i think i can't be of anymore help at this point, sorry
2009-12-13T15:37:00.000Z	jean-claude	Exaltia	: ok I ll try, or use windows xp :'(
