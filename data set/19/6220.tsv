2011-04-10T15:40:00.000Z	swatto		Hey all, im having issues getting Xchat to start up minimized to systray, i got a little bash script that runs which is just 'xchat minimize=2' (excluding quotes)...the application loads on startup but doesn't appear in systray and i can't see that its running unless i view with top
2011-04-10T15:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 i was thinking there was an extra xchat package to add the min to systray feature.
2011-04-10T15:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 does that command work from a terminal?
2011-04-10T15:56:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	yep it does - works from the terminal
2011-04-10T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 you could make it  'sleep 10' from the script. so it waits a bit befor starting. It may be the gnome desktop is not fully setup when the script runs.
2011-04-10T16:01:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	i will try that, thanks :)
2011-04-10T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 dont merge them like that perhaps.. do each on own line. sleep 10     then 'xchat &'
2011-04-10T21:49:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	do i need the ampersand?
2011-04-10T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 try it without.. and with.. learn bash job control basics. :)
2011-04-10T21:57:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	It didn't make a difference :( still doesnt load the ts3 server
2011-04-16T02:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	its a meta-key (aka the super key) its  used by many many other apps as that sort of a key. remaping it may goof up a lot of things.
2011-04-16T02:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 theres tools like guake,  that can scroll down a terminal with differnt key combos
2011-04-16T02:50:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	a meta-key? Ive never had no use for it yet?
2011-04-16T02:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 compiz and  unity make use of it for a great many things...
2011-04-16T02:51:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	ahh ok, shall i leave it then?
2011-04-16T02:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 i use it in unity, and for compiz featutres all the time. :) even in windows  it has special features these days
2011-04-16T02:52:00.000Z	swatto	Dr_Willis	Windows as in the OS? Cause i dont use it
2011-04-17T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 you could do it that way. Or ssh to pc 1, then from there ssh to pc2
2011-04-17T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	swatto	 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
