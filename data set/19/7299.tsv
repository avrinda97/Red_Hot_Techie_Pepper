2009-01-18T10:00:00.000Z	Name141		Is it possible to make a Wubi install larger than 30 GBs?
2009-01-18T10:02:00.000Z	Name141		"super grub disk" ?
2009-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	Name141		And what is the advantage of running Native than Wubi ?
2009-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	_2	Name141	for one thing you don't have two filesystems that can be corrupted and affect your linux system
2009-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	Name141	_2	NTFS?
2009-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	_2	Name141	yes the ntfs and the linux fs withing the file
2009-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	Name141	_2	So NTFS-whatever is not stable ?
2009-01-18T10:07:00.000Z	_2	Name141	stable is a relative term.    can a worm infect it?   sure it can.
2009-01-18T10:08:00.000Z	Name141	_2	So you are telling me to be worried about a windows worm screwing up Wubi cause it will be accessable through Windows ?
2009-01-18T10:09:00.000Z	_2	Name141	i'm telling you that if a virus or other anomily affects the ntfs you will lose linux too because it it in a file within the ntfs
2009-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	_2	Name141	you asked about advantage/disadvantages of wubi -vs- native    that's one.
2009-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	_2	Name141	for a test drive   sure use wubi   but know that linux will preform better natively     even if the amount of change is so small you cant see it.
2009-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	_2	Name141	what is wrong with xchat konversation irssi ... ?
2009-01-18T10:13:00.000Z	Name141	_2	same
2009-01-18T10:13:00.000Z	_2	Name141	you mean for writing scripts for it... doesn't xchat also read shell scripts ?
2009-01-18T10:14:00.000Z	_2	Name141	at any rate there is always a way.  that's what linux is all about
2009-01-18T10:14:00.000Z	_2	Name141	it's called freedom.  :)
2009-01-18T10:15:00.000Z	Name141	_2	No, it's called getting flooded.
2009-01-18T10:16:00.000Z	_2	Name141	heh. default is only the starting point on the long road to right.
