2009-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	felixsulla		In Nautaulus if you're not root, how can you change permissions on a file?
2009-02-06T11:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	use gksudo instead of sudo, for graphical apps like nautilus
2009-02-10T03:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	yes, you can. does the script have to run inside a terminal?
2009-02-10T03:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	that is, does it print output to a terminal?
2009-02-10T03:04:00.000Z	felixsulla	prince_jammys	hmm.. thats a good question. Let me run it.
2009-02-10T03:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	then you can add it with the menu editor
2009-09-14T04:23:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	how does it not work from cron?
2009-09-14T04:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	cron mails the output to you.
2009-09-14T04:26:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	and what is the problem?
2009-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	how does it not work?
2009-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	felixsulla	prince_jammys	Well, the script never runs.
2009-09-14T09:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	how do you determine that?
2009-09-14T09:04:00.000Z	felixsulla	prince_jammys	My python script writes to a log file, and the log file has no new entries.
2009-09-14T09:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	is the log file a full absolute path in the script?
2009-09-14T09:05:00.000Z	felixsulla	prince_jammys	No, it just runs in the folder its in..?
2009-09-14T09:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	provide a full path.
2009-09-14T09:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	felixsulla	debug your cron'd script by also producing output to stdout, and tail -f /var/mail/$USER  to see what's happening.
2009-09-14T09:08:00.000Z	felixsulla	prince_jammys	tail -f /var/mail/$USER gives an error message, no such file or directory.
2009-09-14T09:09:00.000Z	felixsulla	prince_jammys	Ok, added absolute path on the log file, ran it again from command line, and it updated the log properly.
