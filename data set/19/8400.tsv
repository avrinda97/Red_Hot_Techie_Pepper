2007-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	aricz		Is there any particular reason we should not login as root? .. enlighten me please :)
2007-04-02T14:33:00.000Z	aricz		yup
2007-04-02T14:34:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	is there any particular reason you *should* login as root? :P
2007-04-02T14:34:00.000Z	aricz		hehe, not really, but why not? :)
2007-04-02T14:35:00.000Z	LjL		!paste > upd    (upd, see the private message from Ubotu)
2007-04-02T14:35:00.000Z	aricz		ljl, but uhm, root gives full access.. so do sudo I guess?
2007-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	because anything you do has the power to affect the whole system. and that can be a problem because of 1) human error 2) executing malicious code 3) running software with bugs that can be exploited by malicious people
2007-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	aricz		Ljl, sounds perfect to me.. I don't trade freedom for paranoia.. muhahaha
2007-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	why would you need "full access" except when you do need it?
2007-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	aricz		Ljl, I want to live in this enviroment knowing I can do anything I want to do.. hehe
2007-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	aricz		Ljl, but yeah, I get your picture, hopefulle you get mine as well.. we all want to be God right? ;)
2007-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	when you need to (say) install software, you tell you system "hey, look, i'm going to make a system-wide change, i'll be root for a while". that's what sudo is about. why would anyone in their sane mind *login* as root? mind you: ubuntu uses sudo by default, but most other distributions, too, do *not* allow graphical root logins
2007-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	uh, maybe, but being root doesn't necessarily make me feel like any supernatural entity. i'd rather use my system sanely.
2007-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	you *can* do whatever you want to. you have the password.
2007-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	aricz		Ljl, yup, so that's why I don't see why not just login as root in the first place
2007-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	aricz		Ljl, sure, you may fuck up, but it's all your blame, and hopefulle you'll learn from your mistake.. lets not discuss this anymore, I get the point with not being root.. I'm just not afraid I'll twinkle with something and crash the system:p
2007-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	alright, we'll talk about this again when you come here from a live CD after some 12 years old guy has hacked into your machien :)
2007-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	LjL	aricz	then suit yourself (and watch your language)
2007-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	aricz	LjL	ah, sorry..
