2011-04-24T08:15:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	ubuntu comes with onboard too
2011-04-24T08:15:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	Probably, I have the Accessibility off all the time =X
2011-04-24T08:28:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	you need to quote * too, or the shell will expand it
2011-04-24T08:28:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	That's why the . is in front of the * =P
2011-04-24T08:29:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	The command ls -lR | grep .*.php | wc -l works fine here
2011-04-24T08:30:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	it's not that it works; it will sometimes match a file that the shell sees, you need to quote it to be sure it will never be expanded by the shell
2011-04-24T08:30:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	The .*.php prevents it
2011-04-24T08:30:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	if there was a file that matched the pattern that'd turn into "grep file"
2011-04-24T08:31:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	only if there isn't a file named .<anything>.php in the current directory, try it
2011-04-24T08:31:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	I guess =S, but they're rarely used
2011-04-24T08:31:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	easy test, touch .test.php ; echo .*.php
2011-04-24T08:31:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	it's the one time it matches that it gets you
2011-04-24T08:32:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	it's usually by the time someone is comfortable enough with it :D so it's dangerous
2011-04-24T08:32:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	It still works fine for me =P
2011-04-24T08:32:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	Made a file like that, the count increased by 1
2011-04-24T08:33:00.000Z	ohsix	hkmix	if it matches something it's only grepping for the filename it matched, not a wildcard
2011-04-24T08:33:00.000Z	hkmix	ohsix	But I'm getting the wildcard results still
