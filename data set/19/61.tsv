2012-10-23T22:25:00.000Z	loadid	Shahrooz	what kind of video card do you have?
2012-10-23T22:27:00.000Z	loadid	Shahrooz	^
2012-10-23T22:28:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	I tried many times but its impossible. I get blank screen, deletex xserver, ...
2012-10-23T22:29:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	I tried the driver ubuntu recommends and it adds the nvidia cpanel but as I run it, I have errors about xserver, this is a very fresh ubuntu  just installed. I tried every method and technique in web but I get no result.
2012-10-23T22:31:00.000Z	loadid	Shahrooz	have you tried apt-get install nvidia-173 sometimes you need to force an alternate version of the nvidia drivers
2012-10-23T22:33:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	I'm not sure about that, but I did try the driver that nvidia website offers for linux and it gave me blank screen. installing the driver like you said is safe ? I mean what if I get black screen ?
2012-10-23T22:35:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	well I can but last time I did it, it removed the entier xserver xD hehe I'm installing it right now. let see what happens
2012-10-23T23:12:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	okay the driver is installed, but when I run the cpanel it says "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server." what should I do ?
2012-10-23T23:26:00.000Z	loadid	Shahrooz	did you run nvidia-xconfig as root and restart the X server?
2012-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	I did run nvidia-xconfig and it just made a config file, but I don't know how to restart the x server
2012-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	ah okay. I'll brb then :)
2012-10-23T23:37:00.000Z	Shahrooz	loadid	blank screen again, I'm in recovery mode now
2012-10-23T23:38:00.000Z	loadid	Shahrooz	^
