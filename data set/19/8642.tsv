2007-03-01T10:18:00.000Z	linevty04		if somebody feels the urge to wanna help me with my thrice (getting frustered) crashed ubuntu install i'd appriciate it alot, this third install was the best, 2 OS, custom grub n uspash screens, shared win/lin hd space, pimp gui, but anywho i removed my pcmcia card n it froze, crashed, i fsck'd all the partitions from the live cd (which i've been using for 2 weeks) and all my files have been restored to the lost+found folder. all
2007-03-01T10:18:00.000Z	linevty04		i need is a "Your screwed" or help restoring my file structure if possible. :)
2007-03-01T10:19:00.000Z	linevty04		i know :( i've googl'd all i can google
2007-03-01T10:19:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	usually you are out of luck :-(
2007-03-01T10:27:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	next time just back up /etc and maybe the dot folders in ~
2007-03-01T10:30:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	you can put up a thread on the forums, i think there is also space on the wiki
2007-03-01T10:32:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	ouch, just switch to a vt and copy over a backup xorg.conf
2007-03-02T07:38:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	it should just work
2007-03-02T07:39:00.000Z	linevty04	eck	i've read of bugs with opengl and the i915gm opengl/dri support... there's workarounds but i dont know where/how to insert some lines of code i've found
2007-03-02T07:40:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	well, i am using hte 855gm which uses the 915 driver, and everything works for me
2007-03-02T07:41:00.000Z	linevty04	eck	i know it shold work, but it doesnt... there's others with the same chipset that say it works, and other like me that know it doesnt
2007-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	in that case, i would try downloading the latest kernel from kernel.org and compiling it with the 915 drivers
2007-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	have you compiled the kernel before?
2007-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	linevty04	eck	i havent had much luck with compiling... u know of a good how-to?
2007-03-02T07:43:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	use the gentoo docs
2007-03-02T07:43:00.000Z	linevty04	eck	i've tried compiling xorg-air but not much luck, did the menu-config and make and whatnot and usually got errors with a main.o file
2007-03-02T07:44:00.000Z	eck	linevty04	you don't need to recompile xorg, just the kernel module
2007-03-02T07:44:00.000Z	linevty04	eck	i think i'll do some googlin' on that so i dont bombard you with noobish questions :)
2007-03-02T07:45:00.000Z	linevty04	eck	thanks, 'cause i was trying to compile it all
