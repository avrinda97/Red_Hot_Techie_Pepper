2010-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	drew212		why do i get a boot disk failure, but when i use a disk to boot, i can still boot from the hard drive?
2010-06-19T11:33:00.000Z	pres	drew212	what is telling you boot disc failure?
2010-06-19T11:34:00.000Z	drew212	pres	if i start my computer without a cd of 9.04 in the drive, i get a blank screen telling me, boot disk failure, if i pop the disk in, i can select boot from first hard disc, and it works....
2010-06-19T11:34:00.000Z	drew212	pres	i used to get grub errors all the time =X, then they stopped, now this
2010-06-19T11:34:00.000Z	pres	drew212	Corrupt grub config?
2010-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	pres	drew212	what is ltsp?
2010-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	drew212	pres	how can i fix that? also, i cant use my 10.04 disc to boot, it goes right to booting from the disc, doesn't give me any options
2010-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	pres	drew212	what iso did you leech for 10.04?
2010-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	drew212	pres	uhh, i forget
2010-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	drew212	pres	let me check
2010-06-19T11:36:00.000Z	pres	drew212	ok
2010-06-19T11:37:00.000Z	drew212	pres	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download is where i downloaded it from
2010-06-19T11:37:00.000Z	drew212	pres	its the x86_64 bit
2010-06-19T11:38:00.000Z	pres	drew212	when you first start the disc, you have to select the option to boot from hard disk first.
2010-06-19T11:39:00.000Z	drew212	pres	it didn't even give me the option, but i dont really care about that, i want my disc to boot without a CD =X
2010-06-19T11:39:00.000Z	pres	drew212	why so daunting?
2010-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	drew212	pres	i hate clean installs, i have to set everything back up, and it's never the way i had it...
2010-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	drew212	pres	i suspect there is a larger issue, because i cannot boot my windows partition anymore, possibly one of my HDDs failing
2010-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	drew212	pres	my computer has a montage of issues =P
