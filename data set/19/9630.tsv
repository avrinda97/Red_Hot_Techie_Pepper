2006-10-16T16:42:00.000Z	constricted		hmmm how come 16 by 1200 isnt on the change resolution?
2006-10-16T05:13:00.000Z	constricted		whats the command line to change the permissions for a folder?
2006-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	constricted		i cant change in the gui cause it says im not the owner (root)
2006-10-16T05:14:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	sudo chmod <permissions> -R <folder>
2006-10-16T05:15:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	if you give me the permissions you want to set and the folder I'll give you something more complete
2006-10-16T05:15:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	err... the line I gave you above will change the files inside the folder too
2006-10-16T05:17:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	if you want to change the owner (only do this in your /home/<your login name> directory), you may want to use chown...
2006-10-16T05:22:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	you'll have to put 'sudo' before that
2006-10-16T05:22:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	np
2006-10-16T05:25:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	oh, didn't I suggest that you shouldn't use chown outside of your home directory?
2006-10-16T05:26:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	copy the file to your home dir first, or use sudo before writing the file
2006-10-16T05:27:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	no, it'll be fine
2006-10-16T05:36:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	are you able to mount it?
2006-10-16T05:37:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	what is the mount point?
2006-10-16T05:38:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	sudo ls /media/sdc1
2006-10-16T05:41:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	you can install it as a 'nautilus-script'
2006-10-16T05:56:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	sudo chown whyso:whyso (assuming that's your group name) /home/whyso/Desktop
2006-10-16T05:56:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	sudo chmod o+w -R /home/whyso/Desktop
2006-10-16T06:15:00.000Z	jacked	constricted	np, killin' time before studying
