2005-12-29T14:04:00.000Z	gary__	bluefrog-10	no, the problem is that I'm trying to use dhcp to get an IP address
2005-12-29T14:04:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	gary__	where is your dhcp server located?
2005-12-29T14:04:00.000Z	gary__	bluefrog-10	on the router
2005-12-29T14:04:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	gary__	is it enabled and fully working?
2005-12-29T14:04:00.000Z	gary__	bluefrog-10	it worked, then I did a network restart and it hasnt worked since
2005-12-29T14:05:00.000Z	gary__	bluefrog-10	so its definatley something that fucked up in the software on ubuntu not the router, I booted into windows to make sure
