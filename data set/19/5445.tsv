2008-06-30T03:32:00.000Z	shaba1		that was not the question
2008-06-30T03:33:00.000Z	shaba1		the question is how do I start it as root. I know sudo "whatever the thundar executable is"
2008-06-30T03:33:00.000Z	shaba1		BUT I cannot find where are what the thundar executable is
2008-06-30T03:33:00.000Z	HailandKill	shaba1	Just a check.. but I think you mean thunar, not thundar.. you probably can't start thundar because it doesn't exist. Try typing thunar instead
