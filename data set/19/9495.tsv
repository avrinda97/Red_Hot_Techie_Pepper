2006-10-30T11:12:00.000Z	alecjw	Mariolink	you need to do this command:
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	alecjw	Mariolink	make sure you have the uni and multiverse repose enbled then do this command in the terminal: sudo aptitude install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse

2006-10-30T11:24:00.000Z	alecjw	Mariolink	it should say that you need to refresh your software sources becuase they're out of date. let it do it. if it doesn't ask you, do sudo aptitude update in the terminal
