2009-08-26T16:38:00.000Z	AnActivist		Hello fellow Ubuntuers, I am in desperate need of a webspider similar to Teleport Ultra for windows, I need a program the will be able to actually download the files off the site and not just mirror the page, open source software has never let me down but I can't seem to find an answer to my problem, any help would be appreciated :)
2009-08-26T16:39:00.000Z	innomen	AnActivist	have you tried scrap book or httttrack? i think even wget the cli thing might be able to help you
2009-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	AnActivist	innomen	I was checking out wget but I couldn't seem to figure out how to get it to download the files
2009-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	AnActivist		alright, I'll do some more reading
2009-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	AnActivist		thanks guys, I'll report back in a couple minutes
2009-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	innomen		dr willis!
2009-08-26T16:41:00.000Z	innomen		doc doc gimmie the news...
2009-08-26T16:41:00.000Z	innomen		how would i increase the volume on a bunch of ogg files :)
2009-08-26T16:42:00.000Z	innomen		hmmmm
2009-08-26T16:43:00.000Z	AnActivist		i think this is what I'm looking "wget --mirror -w 2 -p --html-extension --convert-links -P <dir> http://www.yourdomain.com" however how would I specify it only to download a certain file type when following the links?
2009-08-26T16:44:00.000Z	AnActivist		I'm also not sure if wget requires you to specify the depth, I'll keep reading but any help innomen or Boohbah could give me, thank you :)
2009-08-26T16:45:00.000Z	innomen	AnActivist	all i know is that wget is a took that downloads things from the web, i use scrap book for grabbing pages, it'sa  firefox plugin and it will do what you want
2009-08-26T16:45:00.000Z	innomen		tool*
2009-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	innomen		it really depends on what you are trying to accomplish
2009-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	AnActivist	innomen	can I use scrap book to download only the files
2009-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	AnActivist		a specific file
2009-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	AnActivist		sorry a specific file extension
2009-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	innomen	AnActivist	maybe not ina  single step but you can use scrapbook to grab the whole page plus files and then lift out what you want from the folder where it puts stuff
2009-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	innomen	AnActivist	i'm about 90% sure you can
