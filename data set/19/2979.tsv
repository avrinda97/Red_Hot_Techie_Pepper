2010-06-16T20:30:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	you should be asking in #bash
2010-06-16T20:31:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	not when the script works when not running from PostSession
2010-06-20T06:17:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	I think its dual boot
2010-06-20T06:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	sudo lshw    .. it will be the first on the list.. use shift pgup to scroll up
2010-06-20T06:39:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	sudo lshw tells you about your motherboard.
2010-06-20T06:39:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	sadly no
2010-06-20T06:41:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	it will give you enough information about your board to allow you to search online for more detailed information
2010-06-20T06:41:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	I am trying to figure out what sound device I have (not a card-onboard), so I am hoping that there will be *some* documentation on my motherboard that'll tell me what module to use for sound
2010-06-20T06:41:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	how is this device connected to your computer?
2010-06-20T07:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	this is old but see if your module/card is blacklisted.. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/11868
2010-06-20T08:09:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	change your sound preferences.. click the sound icon > preferences > Output > connector
2010-06-20T08:20:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	that didn't work-ish, Output isn't listed anyware in preferences, I'm on 9.10 if that means anything, and all of the drivers listed didn't do anything
2010-06-20T08:21:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	ah, 10.04 has changed a bit in that aspect.
2010-06-20T08:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	System > Preference > Sound ?
2010-06-20T08:23:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	what about it?
2010-06-20T08:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	acovrig	are you able to change the output method there? on this laptop it matters which i use..
2010-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	ALSA and Pulse are the only ones that don't give me err msgs, but none work
2010-06-20T08:28:00.000Z	acovrig	bastid_raZor	headphones work ok, but not built-in speakers
