2011-08-23T21:50:00.000Z	macfire		I am here to vent more than a necessarily help. First, if I try to install an OS, would not need much help, my video card does not work, this drug can not boot OS. I've tried everything, but unfortunately I can only install version 10.10, this would be the same as a having a great PC and use Windows 95. Actually the windows have their problems of security, not free, but he can use their latest
2011-08-23T21:50:00.000Z	macfire		version, features the best of my pc without getting stressed. Two days ago I'm banging my head to install an OS, which is said friendly and safe, should really be safe, because the difficulty of installing it is huge, simply give up that OS, and if someone come to ask for information or not to keep Ubuntu installed, I will say with all words, do not use, no use this garbage
2011-08-23T21:52:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	actually with Windows one can't use the latest
2011-08-23T21:52:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	Windows doesn't let people use their latest OS developments, they get the release which is stale by the time it's shipped for retail
2011-08-23T21:52:00.000Z	macfire	NthDegree	three day for install a SO and dont works
2011-08-23T21:53:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	why not use the LTS version?  That's the one Canonical ships CDs/DVDs for
2011-08-23T21:53:00.000Z	macfire	NthDegree	because dont works system in radeon
2011-08-23T21:53:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	tried booting with nomodeset?
2011-08-23T21:54:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	try the Ubuntu LTS version and see if it works
2011-08-23T21:54:00.000Z	macfire	NthDegree	sure, in install is corret after stop in that message
2011-08-23T21:55:00.000Z	macfire	NthDegree	five cds and downloads?
2011-08-23T21:55:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	in that case, you'll have to try the LTS
2011-08-23T21:57:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	try the Ubuntu LTS
2011-08-23T21:59:00.000Z	macfire	NthDegree	10.04 is works fine
2011-08-23T22:00:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	if you're moving from Windows, the LTS is the best option.  It better matches the same release style Windows uses
2011-08-23T22:02:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	btw, ATI is the worst option for using 3D, ironically the proprietary NVIDIA drivers are the most bug-free in my experience lately
2011-08-23T22:03:00.000Z	macfire	NthDegree	and ActionParsnip when I removed the option vt.handoof = 7 in grub, he began, but was in text mode, and it was not for the graphics mode, I typed startx, and it did not work.
2011-08-23T22:05:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	that's because the graphics card drivers aren't working right there and then
2011-08-23T22:06:00.000Z	NthDegree	macfire	i'd recommend installing fglrx drivers and trying to boot normally then ;)
