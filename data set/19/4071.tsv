2009-11-10T16:11:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral		hey guys, im trying to install 8.10 on this laptop. It has XP on it already. It is an old laptop so I ran chkdsk on it and it reported no errors but when I try to install Ubuntu it comes up with an I/O error, dev 0, sector xxxxx
2009-11-10T16:11:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral		any idea?
2009-11-10T16:11:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	when exactly do you get this error
2009-11-10T16:12:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	I have put the disc in to run ubuntu from the disc...i choose english, choose try ubuntu without installing, the prgress bar bounces back and forth a few times and then it does it
2009-11-10T16:13:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	check the cd for errors?
2009-11-10T16:13:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	check the iso download md5?
2009-11-10T16:14:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	disc is bad then probably, has nothing to do with the hard drive as the live cd shouldnt be using it at that point
2009-11-10T16:14:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	ah ok, ty then...good job im downloading koala...i just wanted to get the disc wiped and partitioned while i was waiting for koala to finsih downloading
2009-11-10T16:15:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	ty for your help...oh hang on
2009-11-10T16:15:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	its loading other bits ok but some bits im still getting an i/o error on
2009-11-10T16:15:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	what other bits
2009-11-10T16:16:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	you know when you start from the disc it lists a load of processes with [ok]
2009-11-10T16:16:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	yeah, im guessing parts of the disc are unreadable
2009-11-10T16:17:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	hmm it seems to be booting into the desktop fine
2009-11-10T16:17:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	very odd
2009-11-10T16:22:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	nah its hung on the plain brown screen after username....oh well lol
2009-11-10T16:23:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	try the check disc option?
2009-11-10T16:23:00.000Z	Billiard	Jimi_Neutral	or do ubuntu cds not have that anymore
2009-11-10T16:23:00.000Z	Jimi_Neutral	Billiard	i think 8.10 does, yeah i will try that
