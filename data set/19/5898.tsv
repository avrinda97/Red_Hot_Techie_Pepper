2008-04-21T08:51:00.000Z	WootOnLinux		no one has any words of wisdom for me???
2008-04-21T08:53:00.000Z	WootOnLinux		um.. the wirless card that i was browsing the internet with like 2hrs ago no longer shows up?
2008-04-21T08:53:00.000Z	WootOnLinux		and the ethernet card which connected to the internet, is now nowt connecting.
2008-04-21T08:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	is the nm-applet running ?
2008-04-21T08:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	one possible thing to try with network-manager              sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart
2008-04-21T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	that sometimes gets nm working again
2008-04-21T08:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	you haven't given it very long...
2008-04-21T08:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	Ubuntu doesn't use xinetd
2008-04-21T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	ah I see - hmm, don't know much about vmware, sorry
2008-04-21T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	I know that it sets up an annoying number of interfaces though ;)
2008-04-21T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	have you tried VirtualBox ?
2008-04-21T09:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	VB just does NAT as far as I can see - works well with Linux but I don't use windows so I don't know how well it handles that
2008-04-21T09:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	hint: type thore <tab>
2008-04-21T09:02:00.000Z	WootOnLinux	thoreauputic_	ahhh nice
2008-04-21T09:02:00.000Z	WootOnLinux	thoreauputic_	 isnt there a way to force linux to recognize hardware??
2008-04-21T09:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	umm... it usually does unless it's not supported
2008-04-21T09:04:00.000Z	WootOnLinux	thoreauputic_	 its just weird that it was fine when i first installd it, so i know hardware is supported...so frustrating
2008-04-21T09:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	WootOnLinux	sounds like a vmware issue as you say
2008-04-21T09:05:00.000Z	WootOnLinux	thoreauputic_	 : gogeta, how will i do that?
