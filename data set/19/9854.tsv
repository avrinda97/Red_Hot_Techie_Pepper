2007-03-13T06:58:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Anyhoo, the deal is, I got problems with Ekiga.
2007-03-13T06:58:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		I'd appreciate anyone's help, please.
2007-03-13T06:59:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Guys, I need help with Ekiga, not rm!
2007-03-13T07:01:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Guys, can anyone help me with Ekiga, please?
2007-03-13T07:01:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	What's the problem?
2007-03-13T07:02:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	It seems that I am sending packets, but not receiving.  And the voice quality is awful.
2007-03-13T07:02:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	How fast is your connection?  What protocol is Ekiga using?
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	SIP(Gizmo), under a wireless network and 3Mbps internet (runs at 180Kbps the fastest).
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	That should work.
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	Do you have a firewall?
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	We have a NAT (a router/modem that connects all the computers).
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	Okay, have you forwarded ports to the box with Ekiga?  I think the wizard it runs gives you the settings.
2007-03-13T07:04:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	Symmetric NAT has to be changed in Cone NAT.
2007-03-13T07:07:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	Any ideas?
2007-03-13T07:07:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	Did you forward the ports?
2007-03-13T07:07:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	Don't know which ones to forward.
2007-03-13T07:07:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	The wizard should tell you.
2007-03-13T07:10:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	ttuttle	Any advice, please?
2007-03-13T07:10:00.000Z	ttuttle	superkirbyartist	Sorry, all I can say is try the wizard.  Are you sure it doesn't work?
