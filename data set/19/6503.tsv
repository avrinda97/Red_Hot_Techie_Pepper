2012-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	What window manager are you using?
2012-10-31T00:41:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	my original question was: while upgrading to 12.10 i lost my gnome classic/compiz settings. also some functions do not work (alt+tab for example). perhaps it has something to do with the gdm/lightdm question i encountered during upgrade, but it didn't make any sense to me. please help with recovering
2012-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	if you enable a switcher in ccsm, is it ok?
2012-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	i'm using gnome 2 everyday, ocassionally gnome 3 and unity
2012-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	just a moment
2012-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	Gnome2 is dead
2012-10-31T00:44:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	"gnome classic" if you will. works okay, and i enjoy full compiz effects, to be true (not available on g3 or unity to my knowledge)
2012-10-31T00:45:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	enabled switcher, and it works.
2012-10-31T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	sweet
2012-10-31T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	I don't use compiz. I think its totaly not worth it
2012-10-31T00:48:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	well, on my side i am quite disappointed that all this eyecandy is gone.
2012-10-31T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	just re-enable the stuff you want.
2012-10-31T00:50:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	vfw: or "wasted". but anyway. it's open to debate. the good thing is i can use it if i want.
2012-10-31T00:51:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	thanks, i can do it, but it was kind of tweaked to my preferences...
2012-10-31T00:51:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	not easy to recall everything
2012-10-31T00:52:00.000Z	baskak	ActionParsnip	btw. i'm still curious about this gdm/lightdm question i received during upgrade to 12.10, can you direct me to any explanation?
2012-10-31T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	can you give some details please
2012-10-31T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	then you have gdm and lightdm installed
2012-10-31T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	baskak	maybe the newer compiz had an issue with the old configs
