2006-07-25T16:28:00.000Z	bobbyw		isn't there an easier way to unpack a tar.gz file than the whole extracting in archive manager crap?
2006-07-25T16:29:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	tar zxvf thing.tar.gz
2006-07-25T16:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	preface statements directied to individuals with their name or some of us won't see it.
2006-07-25T16:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	man tar
2006-07-25T16:31:00.000Z	bobbyw	gyaresu	okay, I understand tar, why all the zxvf
2006-07-25T16:31:00.000Z	bobbyw	gyaresu	why not just tar this.tar.gz
2006-07-25T16:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	read the fantastically documented manual. "man tar"
2006-07-25T16:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	and the programme "file" will tell you what a file 'actually' is. not like windows where the characters after the dots mean something.
2006-07-25T16:37:00.000Z	bobbyw	gyaresu	I'm still confused by the whole things after dots don't mean anything
2006-07-25T16:38:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	try going into your home directory and doing the command 'file blah' where blah is some file.
2006-07-25T16:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	now try doing it on a bunch of different files. linux doesn't care what the file is called. ie thing.tar.gz then rename to thing.wooble would not change the file.
2006-07-25T16:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	a symbolic link is handy to point to a place. i.e. put a link to /mnt/thing/stuff/thing/blah in your home directory that stops you from having to type the whole path out.
2006-07-25T16:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	man is your friend. more than google really. e.g. 'man ln'
2006-07-25T16:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	remember that it's still a stupid computer.
2006-07-25T16:43:00.000Z	bobbyw	gyaresu	I learned that, but some really basic commands arn't in man
2006-07-25T16:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	like?
2006-07-25T16:44:00.000Z	bobbyw	gyaresu	I can't remember now, but I've typed a few commands in before and I guess I typed the wrong thing because I got no page
2006-07-25T16:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	tab complete is great.
2006-07-25T16:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobbyw	try rtorrent run under screen
