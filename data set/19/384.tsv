2012-08-02T17:36:00.000Z	Thomas_		yes
2012-08-02T17:37:00.000Z	Thomas_		I use only 100 gigs of my 500 gb drive so yes
2012-08-02T17:37:00.000Z	Thomas_		from the looks of it
2012-08-02T17:38:00.000Z	Thomas_		that's my question, can I create a free partition now?
2012-08-02T17:38:00.000Z	Thomas_		wait a second
2012-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Thomas_		I have 2 choices
2012-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Thomas_		1) Replace windows 7 with Ubuntu
2012-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Thomas_		and 2)
2012-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Thomas_		"something else"
2012-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Thomas_		I'd gladly do the first one but I need to test out Ubuntu first :P
2012-08-02T17:40:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	what does the partitioning look like?
2012-08-02T17:35:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	what is the other OS?
2012-08-02T17:35:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	try using wubi.exe then, from inside windows
2012-08-02T17:41:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	then the easiest thing might be to boot windows, shrink the partition, and then boot your ubunu install medium again
2012-08-02T17:43:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	for a nearly foolproof way, just resize your windows partition in windows, and then you should be able to use the "install alongside windows" option :)
2012-08-02T17:44:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	in gparted, or in windows?
2012-08-02T17:51:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	mountpoint "/" is the main filesystem. you may or may not want to use one for "/home"
2012-08-02T17:52:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	it's easy
2012-08-02T17:53:00.000Z	samster34	Thomas_	open the disk manager (run diskmgmt.msc), select your windows partition, "shrink" it by how much space you want for ubuntu, now start the ubuntu setup again and you will have the choice to install alongside windows 7
