2007-07-16T12:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	Is this on the LiveCD or the actual install?
2007-07-16T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	Ahh, ati...
2007-07-16T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	Try installing xorg-driver-fglrx

2007-07-16T12:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	You can scroll up and down
2007-07-16T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	AFIK the identifier can be whatever you want
2007-07-16T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	Like Nubbie said, just stick to the defaults

2007-07-16T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	It will offer to download the firmware for your card, choose yes
2007-07-16T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vsop_Vsop	That's it, it's done :)
