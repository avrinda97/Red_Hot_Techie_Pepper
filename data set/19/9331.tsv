2006-11-20T12:12:00.000Z	linux666	pip	delete those partitions and create new ones if you have backed up your data
2006-11-20T12:13:00.000Z	linux666	pip	why do you need to recognize them?
2006-11-20T12:13:00.000Z	pip	linux666	I need not to ?
2006-11-20T12:14:00.000Z	linux666	pip	no, you dont need your old partitions to reinstall ubuntu, but you will lose everything, so back it up.
2006-11-20T12:15:00.000Z	pip	linux666	OK,I want to use to old linux partitions to install the new ubuntu. after I configure them and to format,the installer said "you do not have root partition",but I did set '/' partition
2006-11-20T12:16:00.000Z	linux666	pip	did you set one partition for booting?
2006-11-20T12:16:00.000Z	pip	linux666	I have double system installed, I do not want to lose windown partitions
2006-11-20T12:16:00.000Z	pip	linux666	yes,I set a "/boot"
2006-11-20T12:17:00.000Z	linux666	pip	have you tried the alternate installer?
2006-11-20T12:17:00.000Z	linux666		alternate cd
2006-11-20T12:17:00.000Z	pip	linux666	the problem is that the installer told me "no root partition specified"
