2008-02-26T02:35:00.000Z	arthurmaciel		does anyone know any small and slim laptop that can run ubuntu smoothly? (I would like personal reports on that - I know most of them can run ubuntu, but want one that is small and light)
2008-02-26T02:36:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	check out the eeepc.  I think it takes a little configuration to get ubuntu running on it smoothly, but it's a pretty nifty little laptop
2008-02-26T02:37:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	but I`ve heard from people that have it that is not quite confortable to use eeepc as main laptop/pc
2008-02-26T02:38:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	That's true, it depends how small/slim you want to go
2008-02-26T02:38:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	a buddy of minie has one and loves it... me, I run out of screen real estate on my 17" monster laptop :)
2008-02-26T02:39:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	I'm using a 12.1" laptop now. It is not widescreen and its screen is xga. I would like some that is maybe of this size, but with greater resolution (max here is 1024x768).
2008-02-26T02:41:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	 I'm not very current with the latest laptop models anymore, but a Dell XPS 1710 is a sweet little laptop you can get with decent graphics capability and a 12.1" screen.  I know in windows it will support resolutions over 1024x768
2008-02-26T02:43:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	thanks. I'll take a look.
2008-02-26T02:44:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	np, the laptop has been out for about a year and half, so you could probably get it at a decent price now
2008-02-26T02:46:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	but it is 17" screen, right? I want something much smaller and light
2008-02-26T02:47:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	my laptop does not have cdrom and weights about 1.5kg. I want something at the same size or smaller.
2008-02-26T02:47:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	oh no, the 1710 is tiny, unless i have my model numbers backwards
2008-02-26T02:47:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	I've found xps m1710. is it the same?
2008-02-26T02:48:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	 oops.  XPS 1210 is what i'm thinking of :)  my fault - http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2965&review=XPS+M1210+Review
2008-02-26T02:48:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	oh, ok now :-)
2008-02-26T02:50:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	there ya go :)  Kemrin2 confirms that ubuntu works great on his 1210 :)
2008-02-26T02:51:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	psyferre	hm. great. Just want to find the weight and size of it.
2008-02-26T02:52:00.000Z	psyferre	arthurmaciel	4.4 lbs - about 2 kg
