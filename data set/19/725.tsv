2012-11-10T08:07:00.000Z	lunaphyte		hi.  when a new windows opens on the desktop [a program, folder, etc], it's always stuck in one of the corners.  how can i change that, so it's in the middle of the screen?
2012-11-10T08:07:00.000Z	lunaphyte		*window
2012-11-10T08:09:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	if you're using compiz you need only to set the window placement parament to center
2012-11-10T08:11:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	thanks for the clue, i'll have a look
2012-11-10T08:13:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	/apps/compiz/plugins/place/screen0/options/mode, set it to 2. you need gconf-editor.
2012-11-10T08:13:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	not that's 1 not 2
2012-11-10T08:33:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	thanks, i found the setting, but it doesn't seem to have worked.
2012-11-10T08:33:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	are you running compiz?
2012-11-10T08:34:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	i think i am, how can i confirm?
2012-11-10T08:42:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	egrep compiz
2012-11-10T08:43:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	sorry?
2012-11-10T08:44:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	oh, pgrep compiz
2012-11-10T08:44:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	ah, gotcha.  pid 1977
2012-11-10T08:46:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	you have compiz running. if you set the key right you should be getting centered windows poping up all over the center.
2012-11-10T08:48:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	i believe i have it set right.  it was labelled as you described - 1 = center
2012-11-10T08:48:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	is there a shell command i can use to print settings?
2012-11-10T09:07:00.000Z	Cong	lunaphyte	install CCSM from the software centre. It will make turning on plugins for compiz a snap. That's the theory anyway.
2012-11-10T09:07:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	ok
2012-11-10T09:54:00.000Z	lunaphyte	Cong	i must have been doing something wrong before.  adjusting the setting using ccsm seems to have worked.  thanks for the help
