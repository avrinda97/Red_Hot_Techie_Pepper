2008-01-21T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	install libgtk2.0-dev , you need the headers for the library to compile
2008-01-21T08:59:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	nickrud	ok
2008-01-21T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	seriously though, lots of someones helped me learn this free thing, I'm passing it on
2008-01-21T09:02:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	nickrud	do you feel "other people's problems are my problems"?
2008-01-21T09:02:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	it's off-topic, but up to a point, yes. I'm actually very self centered.
2008-01-23T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	probably .001%
2008-01-23T11:37:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	nickrud	why?
2008-01-23T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	but #ubuntu-marketing probably has real numbers
2008-03-01T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	I've had success on some streams with the mozilla-mplayer plugin, with the w32codecs
2008-03-01T10:54:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	yes, that's what I was answering
2008-07-12T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	yao_ziyuan	alltray gives some support for that
