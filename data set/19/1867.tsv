2010-09-17T01:19:00.000Z	NoTownKasper		System: Ubuntu 10.04, right out of the box with the exception of a few updates and firefox plugins...but the whole system is incredibly flaky on resolving hostnames. So far the only workaround I've found has been to completely re-configure my network settings, watch the new config fail even harder and then reset to original settings. Any ideas what's causing this and how to fix it?
2010-09-17T01:20:00.000Z	NoTownKasper		Thank you, but IPV6 is disabled.
2010-09-17T01:20:00.000Z	NoTownKasper		:P
2010-09-17T01:22:00.000Z	warflyr	NoTownKasper	may want to start trying some tracert, digs, nmaps, telnets, etc ;)
2010-09-17T01:41:00.000Z	warflyr	NoTownKasper	make sure you dont have 2 default gateways
2010-09-17T01:41:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	Excuse me? 'splain please?
2010-09-17T01:42:00.000Z	warflyr	NoTownKasper	$ route -n; are there two gateways at the bottom with dest 0.0.0.0?
2010-09-17T01:42:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	Nope, just the one.
2010-09-17T01:43:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	Want the whole output?
2010-09-17T01:46:00.000Z	warflyr	NoTownKasper	does it actually get to 8.8.8.8?
2010-09-17T01:46:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	 don't know, it gets about 5 hops down then starts getting a butt-load of "no reply"s.
2010-09-17T01:48:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	 first 3 hops, fine, 4 and 5, no reply 6-12 fine, then nothing but no-replys...
2010-09-17T01:49:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	oddly enough though, I tracepath'd yahoo.com and it sprung into action. :\ but my browser won't resolve much of anything.
2010-09-17T01:49:00.000Z	warflyr	NoTownKasper	oh, if its your browser causing the problem; im not sure, youll have to look at its logs and maybe check out its wiki or irc chan
2010-09-17T01:50:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	Well, earlier it was everything. Pidgin, audacious, Evolution, nothing would resolve...I'm starting to think it's an external issue with my ISP...
2010-09-17T01:51:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	Except the other machines on the network never have troubles. :\
2010-09-17T01:56:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	...Ok...deus ex machina, I swear. Everything is working fine now...but I'll probably be back here if the issue crops up again. Before I go though, ever hear about P2P programs causing troubles like this? Perhaps even to other machines on a network?
2010-09-17T01:57:00.000Z	warflyr	NoTownKasper	p2p using excessive upload bandwidth can cause tons of problem up to the bottleneck
2010-09-17T01:58:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	warflyr	Thought so...whenever someone around here boots up eMule or one of it's clones...the whole network goes down for the rest of us...I thought it was connected to my issue for a while, until a couple days ago. Alright, thanks for the info and the assistance. As always, the Ubuntu support can't be beat. :P
