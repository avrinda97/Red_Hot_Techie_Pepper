2009-07-09T20:58:00.000Z	rebel		actually.. its me that needs help :)
2009-07-09T20:58:00.000Z	rebel		im his friend
2009-07-09T20:59:00.000Z	rebel		I can get ubuntu installed but then on first bootup my keyboard and mouse will not work causing me to not be able to login..
2009-07-09T21:00:00.000Z	rebel		it does work when im booted from the live cd though
2009-07-09T21:00:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	did you reboot?
2009-07-09T21:01:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	sometimes hal and dbus cannot start, not drivers was not installed.
2009-07-09T21:02:00.000Z	rebel	whatvn	so is there a way to fix that?
2009-07-09T21:03:00.000Z	rebel	whatvn	these are the errors I received after first boot, but went away after second boot, SRST failed (errno=-16), and EXT3-fs error
2009-07-09T21:03:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	I just recommend booting in to livecd and find what cause that problem
2009-07-09T21:03:00.000Z	rebel	whatvn	well when I boot into the live cd everything works fine.. and im kind of new to ubuntu so im not sure how to troubleshoot it
2009-07-09T21:04:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	Ext3-fs is not in this case
2009-07-09T21:04:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	you dont have another keyboard or mouse?
2009-07-09T21:05:00.000Z	rebel	whatvn	I do, but even when I plug them in after bootup they dont work.. should i try plugging them in before boot up?
2009-07-09T21:06:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	you should try :D
2009-07-09T21:07:00.000Z	rebel	whatvn	it is still not working with a PS/2 kb/mouse
2009-07-09T21:08:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	so I think hal and dbus not working. dont know why
2009-07-09T21:09:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	you need to boot in to live cd, then mount your filesystem, then chroot to work on your current system, and start hal and dbus or add it to default run level.
2009-07-09T21:10:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	but in this case, I'm not sure if it works or not, I never did it on ubuntu before
2009-07-09T21:12:00.000Z	whatvn	rebel	see your PM
