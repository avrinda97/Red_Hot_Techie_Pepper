2007-01-25T13:56:00.000Z	mxli20		please i need help.  i need to fix something wrong with xgl/beryl;  when i see a movie, after 10 o 15 minutes my screen turns black and i need to move my mouse for to see my movie again, i've already tried to change my screensaver configuration and the power management configuration, but i'm still with the same problem....    i don't know what to do.  i have an nvidia graphic card, i've already tried aigl
2007-01-25T13:56:00.000Z	mxli20		x and the nvidia beta drivers, but they don't work well
2007-01-25T13:57:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	I think you are dealing with the kernel level screenblanker, and not the X one.
2007-01-25T13:58:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	and what does mean that. i'm noob.
2007-01-25T14:00:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	It means your settings in X won't effect it, it is built into the kernel.
2007-01-25T14:01:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	oooh!!! so i can' fix it...
2007-01-25T14:01:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	Not easily, you might want to google on kernel and screen blanking, maybe there is a simple fix?
2007-01-25T14:03:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	i'll do that... if it doesn't work well then i'll wait until feisty 7
2007-01-25T14:05:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	you might find the same behavior with Feisty, a custom install might be the only work around?
2007-01-25T14:06:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	ok.
2007-01-25T14:07:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	thanks any ways
2007-01-25T14:07:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	nada, gl.
2007-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	i think that i've found the solution....   maybe its something about x.org
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	I don't know? If your going to mess around there, back up your stuff.
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	mxli20	n2diy	do you speak spanish?
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	n2diy	mxli20	no.
