2007-03-19T07:47:00.000Z	balzac		i think the "linux community" needs more leadership
2007-03-19T07:47:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	step up
2007-03-19T07:49:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	take that to #ubuntu-offtopic please.
2007-03-19T07:52:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Then ask about upgrading instead of questioning GPL or something :P
2007-03-19T07:54:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	You might be onto something there.
2007-03-19T07:55:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Compile from source then.
2007-03-19T07:55:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	or, step up.
2007-03-19T08:31:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	What are these GUI's you speak of?
2007-03-19T08:31:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	I live ina  world of screen, nano, and bash.
2007-03-19T08:33:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Start programming.
2007-03-19T08:33:00.000Z	balzac	rukuartic	i'm better at evangelizing than programming
2007-03-19T08:34:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Might want to try yelling at hardware vendors too.
2007-03-19T08:35:00.000Z	balzac	rukuartic	i have an idea
2007-03-19T08:40:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	#ubuntu-offtopic seriously. This isn't a discussion channel.
2007-03-19T08:41:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	go there and ask for #ubuntu-discussion
2007-03-19T08:42:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Its not that we don't want to discuss stuff with you, we just don't want to discuss it with you here.
2007-03-19T09:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Not surprised.
2007-03-19T09:07:00.000Z	rukuartic	balzac	Wanna get banned from here too?
