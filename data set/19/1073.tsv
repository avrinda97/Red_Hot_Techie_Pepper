2011-05-19T12:50:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	xfce is win!
2011-05-19T12:51:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	yeah, I use it on my netbook. Wonder if it'll help at all with this problem I'm having, though.
2011-05-19T12:52:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	xfce is the best DE at multiple screens/monitors
2011-05-19T12:53:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	really? how exactly, on my netbook at least I only have the same image displayed to an external projector, which doesn't seem that spectacular to me.
2011-05-19T12:54:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	Well, not spectacular but as far as out of the box suppport for multiple monitors xfce wins imo
2011-05-19T12:55:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	I don't seem to have any out-of-the-box support for an external display. hm..
2011-05-19T12:56:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	hmm, you mentioned you have a netbook. Is it an intel card?
2011-05-19T12:56:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	yep, seems so.
2011-05-19T12:58:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	using XRandR?
2011-05-19T12:58:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	i have no idea what's XRandR
2011-05-19T12:59:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	XRandR is a toold to configure which display ports are open, and to configure display modes
2011-05-19T13:00:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	like xinerama
2011-05-19T13:00:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	yep, seem i have the command at least. never used it.
2011-05-19T13:03:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	XRandR is a simple way to set up multiple monitors, but it's a bit rough around the edges. I recommend looking in to xinerama, it's very powerful
2011-05-19T13:03:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	i'm ok with rough around the edges, as long as they do what I want. I'll look into both, thanks.
2011-05-19T13:04:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	there's also a program in the repos called "arandr" which is a gui front end to XRandR
2011-05-19T13:07:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	probably intel GMA (that's what I have, an Acer Aspire One)
2011-05-19T13:07:00.000Z	Ileden	linuxnja	note that I'm talking about another thing with xtknight (a desktop computer)
2011-05-19T13:07:00.000Z	linuxnja	Ileden	lol, okay my bad :P
