2008-06-22T10:14:00.000Z	Flannel	axisys	Why not just use a native client?
2008-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	axisys	Flannel	u mean pidgin can use the talk of gtalk ?
2008-06-22T10:15:00.000Z	axisys	Flannel	please advise
2008-06-22T10:16:00.000Z	Flannel	axisys	gtalk is just a jabber client.  So you can use any jabber client, including pidgin, yes.
2008-06-22T10:16:00.000Z	axisys	Flannel	it will do the talk ?
2008-06-22T10:16:00.000Z	axisys	Flannel	i thought just chat
2008-06-22T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	axisys	the audio (actual "talking" part) is Jingle, which is an extension to XMPP.  There are a number of clients that support it (pidgin isn't one).  Try Telepathy, or... well, here's a list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_%28protocol%29

2009-03-03T00:39:00.000Z	axisys	Flannel	i do not see anywhere how to boot from a remote live cd iso
2009-10-20T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	axisys	How about booting from a USB?
2009-10-20T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	axisys	You can use a recent version of Ubuntu (including a liveCD) to turn an arbitrary iso into a USB installer/live environment
2009-10-20T08:12:00.000Z	axisys	Flannel	i dont want to keep burning CD
