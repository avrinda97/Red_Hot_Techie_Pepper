2012-06-13T14:38:00.000Z	lizzin		my resolution and font size are set to what i am used to in osx(1920x1200 and 14pt.) but everthing still looks so big. what can i do? decreasing the font size degrades they way chars look
2012-06-13T14:39:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	is this in libreoffice, gedit, then entire system, just your user account...?
2012-06-13T14:42:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	well with firefox, only the menu buttons look overly big. same with evince and other apps. terminal chars are also big
2012-06-13T14:42:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	fwiw, it is a fresh install
2012-06-13T14:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	did you set any custom video settings (dpi, etc)?
2012-06-13T14:43:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	i dont recall doing so. played around with xrandr. thats it though
2012-06-13T14:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	do you have the same issues if you create a new user and login as them?
2012-06-13T14:45:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	one sec
2012-06-13T14:56:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	even new users are bigger than what i am used to in osx
2012-06-13T14:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	can you post a screenshot of what you are seeing?
2012-06-13T14:57:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	working on it now
2012-06-13T14:59:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	what is a good site to post a screenshot?
2012-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	http://imagebin.org/216217 hopefully you can see the size diff. also notice the diff in the brightness. can the brightness on the ubuntu terminal(on left) be increased too?
2012-06-13T15:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	that looks normal to me. the terminal tends to have a fairly large font, I usually run mine with "monospace 10"
2012-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	why would the same settings(font and resolution) be different sizes?
2012-06-13T15:15:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	any idea why the same settings(font and resolution) would appear differently?
2012-06-13T15:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	who knows. fonts are *supposed* to be standard sizes, but anyone who has worked with layout software and document editors enough knows it simply doesn't happen
2012-06-13T15:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	lizzin	one reason is that font points are defined by the PHYSICAL size (a "point" is a unit of measurement), so if the DPI settings for the display settings are different, the fonts will be different
2012-06-13T15:18:00.000Z	lizzin	DarwinSurvivor	oh ok, i look into the dpi settings
