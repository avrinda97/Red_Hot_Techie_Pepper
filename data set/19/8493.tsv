2007-05-07T12:29:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	Are you sure it doesn't automatically mount?  Most things do.
2007-05-07T12:31:00.000Z	ForsakenSoul	godlygeek	if it mounts ... i actually don`t know where to look for it
2007-05-07T12:31:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	dmesg | tail after reinstalling
2007-05-07T12:32:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	I meant after 'reinserting', not 'reinstalling.'  ;)
2007-05-07T12:32:00.000Z	ForsakenSoul	godlygeek	with a little more detail i`m kinda newbie
2007-05-07T12:33:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	Ok.  try this.  Open up nautilus, the file manager, and navigate to /media
2007-05-07T12:35:00.000Z	ForsakenSoul	godlygeek	... there are only two folders for the cdrom 2 for the floppy and one with my windows files

2007-05-07T12:39:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	try, from a terminal, 'sudo mkdir /media/camera; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/camera -ouser,umask=0; ls /media/camera'
2007-05-07T12:41:00.000Z	ForsakenSoul	godlygeek	10x ... it worked :D
2007-05-07T12:42:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	You can lose data off a mounted drive if you don't unmount it safely and just disconnect it.  ;)
2007-05-07T12:44:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	You're right, of course, but that was my quick helping-you-out help.  i don't know how to make something automatically mount if it doesn't work properly OOTB.  I'd ask on the forums.
2007-05-07T12:44:00.000Z	godlygeek	ForsakenSoul	But, at least now you can use it in the mean time.
