2006-06-11T13:50:00.000Z	Ayabara		I get an error message when I follow the "restricted formats" help. E: Couldn't find package gstreamer0.10-pitfdll. Any ideas?
2006-06-11T13:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	methinks typo dude
2006-06-12T11:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	k3b
2006-06-12T11:37:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	thanks. somehow I end up installing a bunch of kde apps in my ubuntu. is this a sign I should run kubuntu instead?
2006-06-12T11:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	imo - only 2 kde apps worth having k3b & amarok
2006-06-12T11:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	and they run fine under gnome
2006-06-12T11:38:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	ok. I like krusader too actually. only thing I miss from windows is total commander
2006-06-12T11:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	I'm not familiar with tc
2006-06-12T11:39:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	at work, all I need to get thru the day is emacs and total commander :-D
2007-07-08T09:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	I can't believe sdc & sdb keep swapping around - is this ide or sata?
2007-07-08T09:05:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	it's external usb drives.
2007-07-08T09:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	what file systems ?
2007-07-08T09:06:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	hfs+
2007-07-08T09:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	that a mac thing?
2007-07-08T09:07:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	yep. I'll receive a MB pro one of the following days, and it seemed the best fs to use from both Ubuntu and OSX
2007-07-08T09:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	can you set a disk label in hfs+ ? that would be best maybe
2007-07-08T09:09:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	I think that's possible
2007-07-08T09:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Ayabara	mkfs.hfsplus -v volume_name              -hopefully this will work same as ext3, which mounts your usb as /media/volume_name
2007-07-08T09:13:00.000Z	Ayabara	Frogzoo	sounds like a plan. but... that will recreate the fs as well as set volume_name, won't it? I have lots of data on the drive, so I need to just set the label. I'll google a bit :-)
