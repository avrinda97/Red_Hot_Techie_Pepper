2007-03-06T14:25:00.000Z	TheVault		Got a question. I just installed wine and its going good, but the problem is, I wanna create shortcuts for my programs that are exe files....Am I able to do so and if so how?
2007-03-06T14:26:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	It is possible to create a shortcut that does 'wine *file*'
2007-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	TheVault	abelstr	What I mean is. So I have a program called skype.exe for instance, I wanna create a shorcut that when I click on it, it launches it using wine
2007-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	TheVault	abelstr	Just using skype.exe as an example, I don't have that installed
2007-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	yes, create a shortcut with command: wine *location of skype.exe*
2007-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	TheVault	abelstr	Lemme keep trying
2007-03-06T15:13:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	it usually means you didn't specify the correct path: if the specified file does not exist, it will look in the system32 folder
2007-03-06T15:14:00.000Z	TheVault	abelstr	But I copy and paste the address to my exe I am looking for
2007-03-06T15:16:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	use the complete path to the exe, noting case sensitivity. If you already did, I can't help you i'm afraid.
2007-03-06T15:17:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	note the first shouldn't be necessary
2007-03-06T15:17:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	mind you, the .exe needs to be executable
2007-03-06T15:17:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	chmod u+x sol.exe
2007-03-06T15:19:00.000Z	TheVault	abelstr	I don't see the sol.exe in there, what do I do now?
2007-03-06T15:19:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	try a 'locate sol.exe' incase you're quite sure it's on your system. If you didn't already, run 'updatedb' first.
2007-03-06T15:20:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	the latter as root
2007-03-06T15:22:00.000Z	TheVault	abelstr	Alright I did that, heres what I got
2007-03-06T15:23:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	that means it's either not on your system, or you didn't run 'sudo updatedb' after you installed the application. Did you use a windows installer?
2007-03-06T15:24:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	What application are you trying to run?
2007-03-06T15:24:00.000Z	abelstr	TheVault	I'm leaving, sorry. Good luck!
