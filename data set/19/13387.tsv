2005-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Zedtech		can I get some serious help here? :-)
2005-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Zedtech		I mean major
2005-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Zedtech		Where can I configure the mouse in Ubuntu?
2005-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Zedtech		The thing isnt supporting my mouse properly and totally flaking out
2005-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Zedtech		I move the mouse and it just sporadically moves/clicks/opens things
2005-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Zedtech		I just need to get to the mouse config, and see if I can do
2005-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	Zedtech		well, how can i do it without a mouse? How can I load 'system' from a terminal?
2005-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	Zedtech		I mean, I got a terminal up (obviously) and managed to get irssi started
2005-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	Zedtech		im afraid to move that mouse again
2005-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	are you using a usb mouse?
2005-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	looking at the mouse config it dosn't seem that you can fix your problem in there
2005-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	Zedtech	Dalkus	then any suggestions?
2005-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	Zedtech	Dalkus	besides "go back to gentoo"?
2005-04-08T06:30:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	none that I can think of... But i have no experience in fixing this problem, i just changed mice and never looked into it... I was very new to linux back then
2005-04-08T06:31:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	you in gnome?
2005-04-08T06:34:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	again?
2005-04-08T06:34:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	do it as sudo
2005-04-08T06:36:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	it works now?
2005-04-08T06:37:00.000Z	Dalkus	Zedtech	cool :)
