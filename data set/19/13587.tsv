2005-03-03T08:04:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		whats the command for installing the flashplayer for firefox?
2005-03-03T08:05:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla doesnt work
2005-03-03T08:05:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	what error do you get, and do you run Warty or Hoary?
2005-03-03T08:10:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	tar xzvf
2005-03-03T08:14:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	you just answer my question of what error apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla gives you, instead installing and screwing up everything manually
2005-03-03T08:14:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	JDahl	- it says the archive doesnt exist
2005-03-03T08:14:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	did you enable universe?
2005-03-03T08:16:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	try apt-cache search flash. It could be named differently under Hoary
2005-03-03T08:18:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	try entering the url, about:plugins... is flash listed?
2005-03-03T08:22:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	rm -r <dir>... there's also a handy command called "man" we linux like
2005-03-05T17:10:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	JDahl	 thanks for all your help brother.
2005-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	JDahl	 you wouldnt happen to know what the acrobat reader package name for apt-get is would you?  i tried acroread and that didntwork
2005-03-05T17:36:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	you just install it with "sudo ./install"
2005-03-05T17:38:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	I like xpdf better
2005-03-05T17:40:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	but the general way to search for packages is "apt-cache search <search expr>", and also handy dpkg -S <package> to see what files an installed package provides
2005-03-05T17:41:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	sorry - dpkg -L <package> to list files, -S for search
2005-03-11T06:04:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	/usr/local
2005-03-11T06:08:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	that's how it should be... stuff handled by the package manager goes in /usr, /sbin, etc... whatever you compile yourself should go in /usr/local
2005-03-17T13:37:00.000Z	JDahl	shadeofgrey	right click channel tab, and "detach"?
