2010-09-26T11:06:00.000Z	atxq_		hey
2010-09-26T11:06:00.000Z	atxq_		so is there a way to "bookmark" cmd in terminal?
2010-09-26T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 what do you mean?
2010-09-26T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 theres a bash/history setting for that.
2010-09-26T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 bash's history feature has a lot of very nice features taht get overlooked
2010-09-26T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 it can be set to show/log/ or hide 'duplicate' commands
2010-09-26T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	  Its setable.. read up on bash/bash history. I thought not showing dupes. was the default.. its set that way here at least.
2010-09-26T11:15:00.000Z	atxq_	Dr_Willis	thanks for the link
2010-09-26T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 You woudl never think of checking a programs config files? :)
2010-09-26T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 thats the line here.. its there by default.
2010-09-26T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 all that does is make it not log if you ran (for example) ls 3 times in a row
2010-09-26T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 one use for history is to generate 'scripts'  so its not going to hide every time you ran 'ls' if it was done 20 commands back
2010-09-26T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 thats not how it works
2010-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 thats not how it works
2010-09-26T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 bashrc gets read at startup... once..  not sure what you are trying to acomplish
2010-09-26T11:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	  Your feature would make  how i use history.. somewhat useless.. but Im still not clear on how you are working with the history.
2010-09-26T11:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	 you can use !### to rerun some specific command thats high up in the history
2010-09-26T11:38:00.000Z	atxq_	Dr_Willis	what you think? I am sure many people would like this feature too
2010-09-26T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	atxq_	  the way i work.. your feature would be useless. and break how i 'do' things.
