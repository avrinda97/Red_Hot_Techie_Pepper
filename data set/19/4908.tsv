2009-05-21T22:03:00.000Z	mroc		my computer is running exceptionally slow, and i don't know why.  it had been running fast for quite a while, but now even typing gives a huge lag..i have to sit and wait for the cursor to catch up.  how do i got about fixing this problem?  any help is appreciated.
2009-05-21T22:04:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	use top to find what makes your computer slow
2009-05-21T22:06:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	top shows firefox and xorg as the top two, both taking between 15-30% CPU, and firefox is just open in the background.
2009-05-21T22:07:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	top says how much cpu used?
2009-05-21T22:08:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	keeps fluctuating, 30-60%
2009-05-21T22:09:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	when i type anything in kile, xorg goes way above 50% cpu usage.  didn't have this problem before, and i haven't changed anything since yesterday when all was working nicely.
2009-05-21T22:10:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	free -m and see what happens?
2009-05-21T22:11:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	sorry, I said to mroc
2009-05-21T22:12:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	free -m and tell me what happens?
2009-05-21T22:12:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	11 free, 497 total.  ah, well...clearly, that's a problem.  never had that much used before.
2009-05-21T22:13:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	oh...wait, i had all these same things running yesterday, but i did suspend and resume once since then.  could that be adding to the problem?
2009-05-21T22:14:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	you have not much ram, suspend is not the right way
2009-05-21T22:14:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	did you set swap before?
2009-05-21T22:22:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	sorry about that...i'm not sure what happened there exactly.  must've dropped my internet connection briefly.
2009-05-21T22:23:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	try reboot and see if it works. do you already have Swap partition? you should have at least 1GB swap
2009-05-21T22:24:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	i have a swap of 1.44gb, showing as ~300mb used.  any way to do this without rebooting?
2009-05-21T22:25:00.000Z	whatvn	mroc	i think no
2009-05-21T22:26:00.000Z	mroc	whatvn	ok.  i'll check it out.  if things are working, i won't sign back in, so thank you in advance.
