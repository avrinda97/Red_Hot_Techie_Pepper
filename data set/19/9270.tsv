2007-01-25T12:42:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	ping your router. see whether there are dropped packets.
2007-01-25T12:45:00.000Z	Taime1	dabaR	, thanks, i have been trying to figure tat out forever
2007-01-25T12:45:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	which?
2007-01-25T12:46:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	oh, I forgot I did that:)
2007-01-25T12:47:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	try pinging someone, like google.com
2007-01-25T12:48:00.000Z	Taime1	dabaR	PING www.l.google.com (64.233.167.99) 56(84) bytes of data. <---is that a bad thing?
2007-01-25T12:49:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	it just means your router does not let you ping out.
2007-01-25T12:50:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	Ok, then why would it be bad?
2007-01-25T12:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	^
2007-01-25T12:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	what is slow on your computer?
2007-01-25T12:54:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	tell me what is in /etc/resolv.conf
2007-01-25T12:57:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	are you now on that computer?
2007-01-25T12:58:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	Well, unless someone has a better idea, sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart, then see whether your /etc/resolv.conf is still the same. paste more than one line to pastebin.com
2007-01-25T13:01:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	use sudo to edit the file, and leave only the second line in.
2007-01-25T13:01:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	that is your router ip, right?
2007-01-25T13:02:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	wasn't there a search belkin as a first line?
2007-01-25T13:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Taime1	sure
