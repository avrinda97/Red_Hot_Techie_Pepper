2007-05-08T12:17:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	Oh yeah. It's crappy one. I didnt want to remember it
2007-05-08T12:18:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	heh well it gets the job done, last time i tried it was a long time ago in suse so im guessing its gotten a lot better
2007-05-08T12:18:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	But if you used DVD Shrink, then you understand. It is much better
2007-05-08T12:19:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	It keeps the original menu structure and just shrinks the mpeg files.
2007-05-08T12:20:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	yeah i never keep the menus when i rip dvds, i just go straight for the movie
2007-05-08T12:21:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	What about episode ones?
2007-05-08T12:22:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	i just do one ep after another and just hit the next button on my dvd player lol
2007-05-08T12:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	I like menus.
2007-05-08T12:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	I suppose you could shrink ep at a time. and re-author the dvd
2007-05-08T12:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	and make your own menu
2007-05-08T12:25:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	still do, just havent ripped a dvd in over a year
2007-05-08T12:26:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	So, you don't have a need to backup dvds?
2007-05-08T12:26:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	not really
2007-05-08T12:27:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	i used to when i traveled and just took the copies with me
2007-05-08T12:27:00.000Z	kahrytan	freeza	You still burn dvds ?
2007-05-08T12:29:00.000Z	freeza	kahrytan	i burn a movie dvd here and there like when its a dvd for the kids, i let them have at it on the copied ones
