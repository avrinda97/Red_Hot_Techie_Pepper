2008-09-19T07:23:00.000Z	supercom32		When I create a new user, the only folder in this home directory is "Examples". How do I get Ubuntu to regenerate all files?
2008-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	supercom32		I'm thinking maybe I added and deleted the users home directory once too many times and now when I re-create the user account it won't make the full home directory structure?
2008-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	supercom32		Anyone know why creating a user would not generate all the home directory files/folders?
2008-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	how did you create it?
2008-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	I used user and groups system panel
2008-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	what files were you expecting that were not created?
2008-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	sound, pictures, etc. All those kinds of things.
2008-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	have you logged in with the user into GNOME?
2008-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	I didn't log in as him yet. But I never needed to before to get anything created
2008-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	try
2008-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	One sec ;P
2008-09-19T07:31:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	that did it :P
2008-09-19T07:32:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	On another note, is there a simple way to copy the settings of one user to another? Background colors, compiz settings, etc?
2008-09-19T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	sure, just copy all the .* files over
2008-09-19T07:36:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	gksudo nautilus
2008-09-19T07:37:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	Thanks! That works.
2008-09-19T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	tried ~/.config/?   or just copy everything with danbh_intrepid's suggestion
2012-08-10T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	supercom32	reinstall
2012-08-10T07:57:00.000Z	supercom32	jrib	Ah! Ok. Thanks.
