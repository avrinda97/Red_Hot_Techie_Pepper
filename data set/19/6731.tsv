2008-02-25T04:39:00.000Z	Eyemean		hellow quick question, i might be getting company laptop to use, but wanted to put ubuntu on it, can i do this and then revert it back to original wen i have to return it?
2008-02-25T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	dualboot and then put it back (you'll need to be able to fix the MBR)
2008-02-25T04:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	you'll want to backup the MBR (with Smart Boot Manager, perhaps) if you don't have any other method of restoring it
2008-02-25T04:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	Smart boot manager (when you boot it from a floppy/whatever) can make a backup of the MBR, and can restore said backup as well
2008-02-25T04:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	or, if you have *any* windows disc, you can do it there as well (and there's probably other utilities that do the same)
2008-02-25T04:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	yep
2008-02-25T04:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	http://sourceforge.net/projects/btmgr/
2008-06-28T03:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	Yes.  The only difference is that it runs on NTFS.
2008-06-28T04:00:00.000Z	Eyemean	Flannel	does that mean it will be slighly slower aswell?
2008-06-28T04:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	Its only slower when it comes to disk access.  And even then, only slightly.
2008-06-28T04:01:00.000Z	Eyemean	Flannel	thanks i might just do that then, because for some reson ubuntu is acting funny, so installtion time should be alot faster if installed in windows
2008-06-28T04:02:00.000Z	Eyemean	Flannel	 is there an easy way to uninstall ubuntu?
2008-06-28T04:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	sure, delete the partitions
2008-06-28T04:04:00.000Z	Eyemean	Flannel	what about the sectin at the start where u select operating system u want to use? sorry im new to linux
2008-06-28T04:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	You'll want to pop in your windows CD, and fix the MBR, and then once you're done with that you'll boot straight into windows.
2008-06-28T04:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	And then after that, just overwrite the ubuntu partitions
2008-06-28T04:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Eyemean	Depending on your version, yeah, repair or fixmbr or whatnot
2008-06-28T04:06:00.000Z	Eyemean	Flannel	xp
2008-06-28T04:06:00.000Z	Eyemean	Flannel	much appreciated
