2012-03-22T08:30:00.000Z	Ben64		that is much different from "no bash file found"
2012-03-22T08:30:00.000Z	Ben64		your website isn't your computer
2012-03-22T08:31:00.000Z	Ben64		you can't until you install php

2012-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	gantry		No, I'm using Ubuntu 11.10
2012-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	gantry		but for some reason my /etc/lsb-release file was set up to be LinuxMint
2012-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	gantry		so I changed it for Ubuntu
2012-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	gantry		that is the only file that I know that it uses
2012-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	gantry		I am trying to install Cinnamon 1.4 which is a Linux Mint project
2012-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	Ben64	gantry	well why was lsb-release saying mint
