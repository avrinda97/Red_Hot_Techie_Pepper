2008-07-17T19:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	Understood, but pasting only a link with no explanation is likely to get ignored.
2008-07-17T19:08:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	ok
2008-07-17T19:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	That is not a very old drive
2008-07-17T19:14:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	there are two...I#m afraid of this seek error and raw_error its very high
2008-07-17T19:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	Ah, I was only looking at the bottom drive info
2008-07-17T19:18:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	it would be great if you could meantion me worring entries of both drives
2008-07-17T19:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	the first drive looks to be on its way out, the second looks ok to me
2008-07-17T19:20:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	ok but health of the first one is passed, what should i do, will the drive be fine for the next months?
2008-07-17T19:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	If you do regular backups, you have no worries
2008-07-17T19:21:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	ok, and what about
2008-07-17T19:33:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	are this values worring? seek rate and raw error of sda?
2008-07-17T19:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	drive 1 is going to fail fairly soon
2008-07-17T22:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	select on booting the system
2008-07-17T22:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	Nope
2008-07-17T22:12:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Jack_Sparrow	ah i know i also have 3 systems, but i thought he wanted to run both on the same time
2008-07-17T22:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_ManU_212	you will need a vm soultion to do that.. and they are far from perfect
