2005-09-12T05:33:00.000Z	trett		Please, how do I open a port (ie 22) in ubuntu ?
2005-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	it shouldn't be closed in the first place. have you installed a firewall?
2005-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	trett	pauldaoust	no I didn't but I tried a web-based port scan, and it says it's closed
2005-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	sounds like nothing's running there; that's all. have you installed openssh?
2005-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	???
2005-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	that's excitingly weird. did you do that yourself?
2005-09-12T05:37:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	I'm a little confused. what sort of server do you want to have listening on port 22, if sshd is running on port 111?
2005-09-12T05:40:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	I'm still not sure why you want port 22 open; it's the ssh port, but if you have sshd listening on port 1111, you don't need 22 open anyway
2005-09-12T05:40:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	ahhhh I see, so you already tried it on 22, then you moved it to 1111
2005-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	now I understand!
2005-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	maybe your ISP is blocking port 22?
2005-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	that would explain why a web-based portscanner sees it as blocked
2005-09-12T05:43:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	who's your ISP?
2005-09-12T05:45:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	zcat: that's my guess too.
2005-09-12T05:46:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	try ssh 127.0.0.1 to see if you can log in using loopback
2005-09-12T05:46:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	then try your IP address
2005-09-12T05:57:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	just sitting there doing nothing
2005-09-12T05:58:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	must be blocked
2005-09-12T06:32:00.000Z	pauldaoust	trett	your machine is on crack; sorry to say :)
