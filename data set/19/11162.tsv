2006-03-21T10:25:00.000Z	DBO		I am having trouble getting any sound to go with my videos... I have used Easy Ubuntu to try and fix the issue.  XMMS plays music fine however
2006-03-21T10:25:00.000Z	DBO		can someone help me?
2006-03-21T10:25:00.000Z	DBO		=)

2006-03-21T10:26:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	mpeg, avi, the whole shoot really
2006-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	I will tell you how that goes, thank you
2006-03-21T10:41:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	it worked, thank you
2006-03-24T16:47:00.000Z	_jason	DBO	paste the string that appears in system > preferences > preferred applications for firefox
2006-03-24T16:47:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	"firefox %u"
2006-03-24T16:47:00.000Z	_jason	DBO	change it to firefox %s
2006-03-24T16:48:00.000Z	_jason	DBO	string I believe, but I am only guessing
2006-03-24T16:48:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	worked, thanks
2006-04-08T10:04:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	yes, maybe they could use solar flares and... transient cosmic radiation... as a medium for communication transmission...  yes...
2006-04-08T10:05:00.000Z	_jason	DBO	they just run some cat5 to the nearest satellite :)
2006-04-08T10:05:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	you know there is a 100m limit on that
2006-04-23T06:12:00.000Z	DBO	_jason	what do you think about chowning mount points for external drives?  I know its not standard practice but Im not sure I see the security hole...
2006-04-23T06:12:00.000Z	_jason	DBO	if you treat it the same you would a directory in your $HOME, I see nothing wrong with it
2006-05-05T12:02:00.000Z	_jason	DBO	tix?
