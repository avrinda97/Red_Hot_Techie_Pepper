2010-05-11T19:44:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	well, you can download the single package without root with aptitude download package_name; it will download it to the current directory
2010-05-11T19:44:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	without root (or you could get the source and rebuild the package with apt-get source package_name; without being root)
2011-08-12T19:03:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	No other way
2012-01-25T00:58:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	that isn't really the nicest way since you can't start them manually later
2012-01-25T00:59:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	True, but works
2012-01-25T00:59:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	but so does: echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/servicename.override;
2012-01-25T00:59:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Ooh, neat
2012-02-02T23:45:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	the firefox-stable ppa will no longer be updated, since the latest versions are being added to lucid-oneiric now
2012-02-02T23:45:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	I see....... Hm, that's new.
2012-02-02T23:45:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Ubuntu keeping up-to-date? That's just funny xD Finally
2012-02-02T23:48:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	yeah just announced a couple days ago: http://www.chriscoulson.me.uk/blog/?p=100
2012-04-23T22:49:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	we don't have systemd in ubuntu, it is in debian though
2012-04-23T22:50:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Ah, I see.
2012-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	sun-java isn't in the repos anymore though
2012-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Thought it'd be for Lucid
2012-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Oh well, old stuff is old, I don't touch old stuff
2012-08-25T00:24:00.000Z	trism	theadmin	was removed from all versions
2012-08-25T00:24:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Oh, I see
2012-10-11T22:13:00.000Z	theadmin	trism	Yes, that, thank you.
