2007-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	TAsn		then?
2007-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	TAsn		I meant I have installed new drivers from ati.com in the past
2007-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	TAsn		should it be any more difficult than that?
2007-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	TAsn		or should I excpect anything unexcpected?
2007-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	TAsn	yes, it uses composite and AIGLX now.
2007-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	TAsn	MilitantPotato	I know, I meant should the installtion be any diffrent?
2007-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	TAsn		I don't think I even need to change the existing (restricted drivers modules) xorg.conf
2007-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	TAsn		or am I wrong?
2007-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	TAsn	but not MUCH harder, just disable restricted, uninstall XGL, compile, install, update kernel, edit xorg for the stuff it needs, and enable restricted
2007-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	TAsn	MilitantPotato	I should re enable restricted afterwards?
2007-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	TAsn		why is that?
2007-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	TAsn	after you've installed them, yes

2007-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	TAsn		btw, does restricted auto-updates the drivers?
2007-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		no.
2007-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		the drivers in the repo are rarely if every updated
2007-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	TAsn	MilitantPotato	ok, I hope that post sums it all
2007-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	TAsn		gotta pick up my brother, cya for now...
2007-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	TAsn	mostly.
