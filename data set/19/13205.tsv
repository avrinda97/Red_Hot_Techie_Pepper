2007-09-05T09:51:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	its very unlikely  , hardware raid is deeply proprietary ( an IMHO no better than software raid) and so cannot be configured through linux , what are you using
2007-09-05T09:51:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	well thanks.... im using a supermicro server with no screen hooked up and i kind of wanted to avoid carrying a screen into the server room
2007-09-05T09:52:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	ok so that should allow you to control the bios via serial console ( i.e null modem to another linux machine )
2007-09-05T09:52:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	that's more confusing than just hooking up a screen, but thanks
2007-09-05T09:53:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	thats how the big boys do it
2007-09-05T09:53:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	run minicom
2007-09-05T09:53:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	, thanx
2007-09-05T09:54:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	real men make their own ;-)
2007-09-05T10:10:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	what's minicom do for me?
2007-09-05T10:09:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	use a nearby linux box and ssh into it and run minicom
2007-09-05T10:10:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	saves you $15 , its a software terminal emulator
2007-09-05T10:11:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	I run minicom on the server or client?
2007-09-05T10:11:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	for serial ports
2007-09-05T10:11:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	on the client (i,e the nearby machine not the one with the raid)
2007-09-05T10:12:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	can I run it on a machine that's a VM on the one with the raid?
2007-09-05T10:13:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	er no , because your server machine will be in the BIOS (i.e not running linux yet) when you are doing this
2007-09-05T10:14:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	ah. and how do I connect these boxes? with a standard serial->serial cable?
2007-09-05T10:15:00.000Z	amias	shad0w1e	skip to stage 3 on this - http://www.vanemery.com/Linux/Serial/serial-console.html
2007-09-05T10:17:00.000Z	shad0w1e	amias	so cool, thank you!!
