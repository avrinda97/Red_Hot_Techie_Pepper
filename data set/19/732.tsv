2011-09-26T01:00:00.000Z	cccangel		guys, how do you get a Logitech Headset to be useable in Ubuntu 11.04? Ubuntu recognizes it but it wont let me use it.
2011-09-26T01:00:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	is it bluetooth?
2011-09-26T01:02:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	how do i check that?
2011-09-26T01:03:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	run 'alsamixer' in a terminal, look for muted channels, channels with really low volume, or anything related to line/capture/mic/output/input
2011-09-26T01:03:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	hit TAB if you run out
2011-09-26T01:06:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	where would the usb headset show up in alsamixer (first time using it)
2011-09-26T01:09:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	sorry, is the audio meant to come in over USB, too?
2011-09-26T01:09:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	yes.  its a mic and headphone headset.
2011-09-26T01:10:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	with only a USB port input
2011-09-26T01:10:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	this is usually corrected with a reboot if i leave the headset plugged in during the whole process
2011-09-26T01:11:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	hrmmm, that's odd
2011-09-26T01:11:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	so something tells me some sort of "reset" on the audio in ubuntu would get it working
2011-09-26T01:13:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	or notlistening, any idea on how to get my headset useable in ubuntu without rebooting the whole machine each time i want to use it?
2011-09-26T01:14:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	if rebooting fixes it, then...
2011-09-26T01:14:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	you're probably losing a service or something to do with udev
2011-09-26T01:17:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	when it's working or when it isn't?
2011-09-26T01:18:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	its not working atm and when i "Test Speakers" it crashes the "Sound Preferences" dialog
2011-09-26T01:19:00.000Z	cccangel	alkafoo	how do i check to see if i have pulse?
2011-09-26T01:19:00.000Z	alkafoo	cccangel	you should I'm pretty sure it's still default in Ubuntu
