2005-04-10T10:52:00.000Z	tritium		anybody know if doko is working on python-gnome?
2005-04-10T09:53:00.000Z	delire	tritium	and so he would have people manually edit /etc/modules.conf?
2005-04-10T09:53:00.000Z	tritium	delire	no, I didn't say that
2005-04-10T09:54:00.000Z	delire	tritium	hehe good ;)
2005-04-10T09:55:00.000Z	delire	tritium	alsaconf has worked for me for many years
2005-04-10T09:55:00.000Z	delire	tritium	but it may be these days.
2005-04-10T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	delire	he's involved in the alsa project, and he doesn't recommend it.  He's also our resident alsa/sound expert
2005-04-10T09:56:00.000Z	delire	tritium	great, he's the perfect guy to ask
2005-04-10T09:57:00.000Z	delire	tritium	on my debian machines it's actually 'alsaconf' not 'alsa-conf' however
2005-04-10T10:06:00.000Z	delire	tritium	i pointed him to debian testing to get alsaconf. it fixed several other people's soundcard issues earlier and some days ago.
2005-04-10T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	delire	well, that's good that you helped them fix things up
2005-04-10T10:07:00.000Z	delire	tritium	one poor guy had no sound for 3 days after install.
2005-04-10T10:08:00.000Z	tritium	delire	it does seem to be one of the more common problems
2005-04-10T10:11:00.000Z	delire	tritium	yep, dockane has no problem with GPG authentication against marrilat. he's not trying to update to that repo.
2005-04-20T10:20:00.000Z	delire	tritium	he asked how to install a .deb so i suggested dpkg -i..
2005-04-20T10:20:00.000Z	tritium	delire	okay, but that won't grab the module-assistant dependency for him.  He'll have to use apt-get install module-assistant for that.
2005-04-20T10:21:00.000Z	delire	tritium	of course, his question didn't include enough meta data
2005-07-12T13:45:00.000Z	delire	tritium	i would suggest coefficient fribulatory retainers, sheared against a 5D Shawn (furrowed) probability Matrix.
2005-07-12T13:45:00.000Z	tritium	delire	heh
