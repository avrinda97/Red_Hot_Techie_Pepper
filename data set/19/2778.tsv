2010-08-31T10:24:00.000Z	m00t	dr0id	dstat -ta 10
2010-08-31T10:25:00.000Z	dr0id	m00t	got some weird output
2010-08-31T10:29:00.000Z	m00t	dr0id	it means that firefox is taking the CPU. Could be a javascript or a plugin like flash.
2010-08-31T10:45:00.000Z	m00t	dr0id	move the data to ext4
2010-08-31T10:45:00.000Z	dr0id	m00t	what does that mean? :P
2010-08-31T10:47:00.000Z	m00t	dr0id	it means that you should backup your partition, then format with ext4 then restore the ackup
2010-08-31T10:49:00.000Z	m00t	dr0id	is it size dependent?
2010-08-31T10:51:00.000Z	m00t	dr0id	may be you need dir_index on fs.How many files are in that folder??
2010-08-31T10:52:00.000Z	dr0id	m00t	any file deletion takes a lot of time
