2004-11-18T13:07:00.000Z	ben_		anyone know how to scale back the cpu when running on battery?
2004-11-18T13:07:00.000Z	Kirsch	ben_	mine just scales automatically, it bounces between 1.20GHz and 2.20GHz only on my P4M
2004-11-18T13:09:00.000Z	ben_	Kirsch	nope, doesn't work for me. it runs right back up to 100% cpu whenever i load a webpage or something
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	Kirsch		what processor?
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	ben_		P3
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	Kirsch		are you sure it has stepping?
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	ben_		uhhh, i dunno
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	ben_		but i know that the battery life didn't suck this much on windows ;)
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	Kirsch		yea... linux is a power ho
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	Kirsch		g
2004-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	ben_		and the cpu is the most power hungry part of the computer
2004-11-18T13:11:00.000Z	Kirsch	ben_	cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep stepping
2004-11-18T13:11:00.000Z	ben_		i found a nifty guide for linux on laptops and making it use less power, but it was written for RHL
2004-11-18T13:12:00.000Z	ben_	Kirsch	stepping       : 1
2004-11-18T13:12:00.000Z	ben_		that's what it said
2004-11-18T13:12:00.000Z	Kirsch		Yea, that means you can only have 1 speed, mine has stepping: 7
2004-11-18T13:12:00.000Z	Kirsch		something else is sucking power, probably X
2004-11-18T13:13:00.000Z	Kirsch		unless that doesn't mean that, but i'm assuming thats waht stepping: 1 menas
2004-11-18T13:13:00.000Z	ben_	Kirsch	well, can i make the cpu operate at 85% when running on battery, or is there no scaling at all?
