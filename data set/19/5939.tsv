2008-04-12T19:41:00.000Z	BizMan2008		ive done this countless times, but for whatever reason, it isnt working on this machine
2008-04-12T19:42:00.000Z	BizMan2008		dont you think i tried that already
2008-04-12T19:42:00.000Z	BizMan2008		that why im here
2008-04-12T19:44:00.000Z	BizMan2008		i understand that
2008-04-12T19:44:00.000Z	BizMan2008		i use ssh tunneling and vnc to get into my linux machine
2008-04-12T19:45:00.000Z	BizMan2008		ok so when i vnc in, usually its set up as 127.0.0.1:port
2008-04-12T19:46:00.000Z	BizMan2008		and it lets me in
2008-04-12T19:46:00.000Z	BizMan2008		i just get to a connection initialized
2008-04-12T19:46:00.000Z	BizMan2008		and thats it
2008-04-12T19:46:00.000Z	BizMan2008		i know its on the linux end because i have no probelm on my other linux machines
2008-04-12T19:47:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	ssh -X -L5900:localhost:5900 remote_machine_here --- then do vncviewer localhost
2008-04-12T19:48:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	in the putty config, tell it to forward the local port 5900 to the remote port 5900. Then you can make your vnc client connect to localhost
2008-04-12T19:49:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	ok, and connecting to port 50000 locally doesn't work?
2008-04-12T19:50:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	are you sure the vnc server is started? try this: netstat -ltnp
2008-04-12T19:52:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	it gives you the prompt again?
2008-04-12T19:52:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	k, that means it's accepting connections :)
2008-04-12T19:53:00.000Z	Seveas	BizMan2008	windows firewall getting in the way?
2008-04-12T19:54:00.000Z	BizMan2008	Seveas	ill check, but i doubt it yesterday morning, on my old image i was fine, and then last night when i redid everything probelms!
2008-04-12T19:58:00.000Z	BizMan2008	Seveas	i mean it knows that there is a connection, because anything else i type, no good, right away it will tell me i cant connect
