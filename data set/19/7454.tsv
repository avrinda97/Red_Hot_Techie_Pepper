2007-08-19T16:54:00.000Z	jimmitastic		hmm but if I have gcc, and I am root so permissions aren't a problem, are there any other obvious things I may have missed?
2007-08-19T05:04:00.000Z	jimmitastic		should the emacs folder I unpacked be in /usr/bin for me to compile?
2007-08-19T05:04:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	no
2007-08-19T05:04:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	.../bin/ is for binaries, not source code
2007-08-19T05:04:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	I unpack it into ~/programs/emacs/
2007-08-19T05:05:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	it doesn't matter, but why put non-binaries into a binary directory?
2007-08-19T05:06:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	I don't know if you've stated your problem or not, but if you did I missed it.  what's the problem?
2007-08-19T05:09:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	you know you can install Emacs from a binary package, right?
2007-08-19T05:09:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus_	So I'm told, but the emacs website gives detailed instructions for obtaining it this way so I thought I'd give it a go
2007-08-19T05:10:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	the error you mention can be fixed by installing a package called "build-essential"
2007-08-19T05:12:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	does that fix it?
2007-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus_	its not in synaptics, so I assume I have to download it too......seems odd they wouldnt include something fairly important to development in a linux distro though....
2007-08-19T05:15:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	it is in synaptic - I may have spelt it wrong though
2007-08-19T05:16:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	it's in synaptic - see what ubotu just said
2007-08-19T05:26:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	what if you run "sudo apt-get install build-essential" in a terminal?
2007-08-19T05:27:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	that's v. odd
2007-08-19T05:27:00.000Z	dooglus_	jimmitastic	are you using ubuntu?
2007-08-19T05:30:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus_	no i mean theres nothign to do with build-essentials in there!
2007-08-19T05:36:00.000Z	jimmitastic	dooglus_	it appears to be working, out of interest why wasnt it on the distro? to make it fit on a CD?
