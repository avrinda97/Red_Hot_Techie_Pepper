2010-12-29T23:50:00.000Z	gsfai		im starting to get tired of this -.-
2010-12-29T23:50:00.000Z	gsfai		why the hell do they make stuff as hard as possible in new versions?
2010-12-29T23:51:00.000Z	DasEi	gsfai	your issue ?
2010-12-29T23:51:00.000Z	gsfai		menu.lst was the world's best invention ever
2010-12-29T23:51:00.000Z	gsfai		yet they threw it away
2010-12-29T23:52:00.000Z	gsfai		you could even edit it under windows
2010-12-29T23:52:00.000Z	gsfai		now -- no
2010-12-29T23:52:00.000Z	DasEi	gsfai	..
2010-12-29T23:52:00.000Z	gsfai		you need to run update-grub, mkconfig, mkshit and a few other programs
2010-12-29T23:52:00.000Z	gsfai		and end up on a grub> shell
2010-12-29T23:53:00.000Z	gsfai		because it boots into a grub> shell
2010-12-29T23:54:00.000Z	DasEi	gsfai	grub2 can be tricky, but if you need spport,describe your problem and get help
2010-12-29T23:54:00.000Z	gsfai		... install 10.10
2010-12-29T23:55:00.000Z	gsfai	DasEi	i am trying to fix this damn box since yesterday, and all i come across are more and more problems, now i have completely bricked it, i think i cant ruin anything in a read-only CD-rom, so i think that i have broken everything that i could
2010-12-29T23:56:00.000Z	gsfai	DasEi	and i used to run a nice and clean grub, with one file called menu.lst, which was easy as hell to edit and stuff. Now i have to edit like a few thousand files. And come across an error.
2010-12-29T23:57:00.000Z	DasEi	gsfai	you can chrrot into hd and get old grub back, though I'd rather repair
2010-12-29T23:58:00.000Z	DasEi	gsfai	one hd, no encryption ?
2010-12-29T23:58:00.000Z	gsfai		one HD, 4 partitions, no encryption
2010-12-29T23:58:00.000Z	DasEi	gsfai	boot into live, open terminal ..
