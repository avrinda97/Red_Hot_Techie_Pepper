2011-08-26T20:42:00.000Z	xibalba		whats the easiest way to rename this interface
2011-08-26T20:42:00.000Z	xibalba		so i can have eth0, eth1, eth2, and eth3
2011-08-26T20:43:00.000Z	xibalba		i already have all except eth3
2011-08-26T20:43:00.000Z	xibalba		eth3 was renamed to eth1_rename
2011-08-26T20:43:00.000Z	xibalba		i've never seen a nix do this style of ethernet renaming
2011-08-26T20:44:00.000Z	xibalba		but i mostly use BSD so it's way different
2011-08-26T20:44:00.000Z	luigi	xibalba	Pretty sure you can add a udev rule to do that.
2011-08-26T20:44:00.000Z	xibalba		could you link me to a document, i'm unfamliiar with udev
2011-08-26T20:44:00.000Z	xibalba		been living under my BSD rock for a while
2011-08-26T20:44:00.000Z	luigi		Oh fff, I'm sorry. This is #ubuntu. I'm not sure if ubuntu has udev support.
2011-08-26T20:45:00.000Z	xibalba		hmm, square 1 i suppose
2011-08-26T20:45:00.000Z	luigi	xibalba	Nevermind. It's there. :) http://www.debianadmin.com/rename-network-interface-using-udev-in-linux.html
2011-08-26T20:45:00.000Z	luigi	xibalba	s/debian/ubnutu and you're all set.
2011-08-26T20:46:00.000Z	xibalba	luigi	, i haven't had a need for udev to be installed on any of my other servers. i'm almost willing to just format this thing
2011-08-26T20:46:00.000Z	xibalba		the other boxes i install ubuntu with all the cards present in it
2011-08-26T20:46:00.000Z	xibalba		this is the only one i installed ubuntu, then added on the 2port nic after
2011-08-26T20:46:00.000Z	luigi	xibalba	Format it and install something new, I guess.
2011-08-26T20:47:00.000Z	xibalba		i prefer BSD's method of NIC naming
2011-08-26T20:49:00.000Z	luigi	xibalba	If you like BSD, go to arch linux.
