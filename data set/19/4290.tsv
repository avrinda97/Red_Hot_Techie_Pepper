2009-07-12T16:00:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	sorry, was distracted. Looking now.
2009-07-12T16:01:00.000Z	pete_	mzz	can you private message me when you look through it?
2009-07-12T16:01:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	I heavily prefer staying on this channel
2009-07-12T16:02:00.000Z	pete_	mzz	I don't want to repeat myself, but I've seen that DRI is suggested to improve the situation
2009-07-12T16:03:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	yeah, and you seem to be low on dri. Do you know if the 16MB it detects is accurate?
2009-07-12T16:03:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	err, low on video ram
2009-07-12T16:03:00.000Z	pete_	mzz	I think so, but it might be 32meg, can't really remember
2009-07-12T16:04:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	can you pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.0.log too while you're at it?
2009-07-12T16:04:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	sorry, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-07-12T16:06:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	that's ok
2009-07-12T16:06:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	reading your log more thoroughly now
2009-07-12T16:09:00.000Z	pete_	mzz	find anything?
2009-07-12T16:09:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	is that an internal or external panel?
2009-07-12T16:10:00.000Z	pete_	mzz	laptop, so internal
2009-07-12T16:10:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	mmm, I wonder if a Virtual line forcing your max resolution to the panel's native (instead of 1600x1200) would help
2009-07-12T16:11:00.000Z	pete_	mzz	how do i do that?
2009-07-12T16:12:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	sec, let me try to write one
2009-07-12T16:15:00.000Z	mzz	pete_	untested: http://paste.ubuntu.com/216165/
