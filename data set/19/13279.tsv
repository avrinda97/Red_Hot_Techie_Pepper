2008-06-30T20:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	aata	$MODPATH
2008-06-30T20:28:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	aata	nevermind. I just read it again, and I agree with joaopinto now
2008-06-30T20:29:00.000Z	aata		﻿Seven_Six_Two when do i put in the %s thiing?
2008-06-30T20:30:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	aata	I've never done it(weezelding typed that) but you start with the ":" and type everything after that
2008-06-30T20:30:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	aata	you do it once you've loaded that file with vim
2008-06-30T20:31:00.000Z	aata		﻿Seven_Six_Two i did exactly that... it said 376 changes made in one line (?) abut the ^Ms are still there
2008-06-30T20:31:00.000Z	aata	weezelding	when do i insert the %s command? after typing :?
2008-06-30T20:31:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	aata	sorry. that was weezelding's suggestion
