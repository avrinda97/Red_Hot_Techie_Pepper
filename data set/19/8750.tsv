2007-02-20T07:00:00.000Z	whonicca	royel	for some reason it isnt showing anymore, but the folders are still on my desktop
2007-02-20T07:01:00.000Z	royel	whonicca	have you rebooted?
2007-02-20T07:01:00.000Z	whonicca	royel	no i havent
2007-02-20T07:03:00.000Z	royel	whonicca	in the future, it's a good idea to create a new directory to mount anything to, you might want to reboot just to be sure things are how they should, anytime you want to unmount something use: umount an the loc you mounted to
2007-02-20T07:03:00.000Z	whonicca	royel	thanks for the information
2007-02-20T07:04:00.000Z	whonicca	royel	does your desktop automatically refresh when u delete a folder on it via command line
2007-02-20T07:04:00.000Z	royel	whonicca	yes
2007-02-20T07:04:00.000Z	royel	whonicca	thats why I suggested you reboot
2007-02-20T07:05:00.000Z	royel	whonicca	you should never mount something thats actually being used like that
2007-02-20T07:06:00.000Z	whonicca	royel	yeah i wasnt thinking i would see the iso file mounted as a disk drive on my desktop
2007-02-20T07:07:00.000Z	royel	whonicca	lol, I understand, next time do: mkdir /home/julio/Desktop/CDImage or something similiar
