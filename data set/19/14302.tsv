2004-10-10T09:38:00.000Z	xf		howdy, trying to install ubuntu-amd64 on an asus k8v motherboard, grub doesn't seem to be installing properly. any ideas?
2004-10-10T09:38:00.000Z	xf		/boot/grub/menu.lst looks fine to me, not sure what's going on
2004-10-10T09:40:00.000Z	xf		hi, anybody?
2004-10-10T09:41:00.000Z	xf		i'm installing it on my master secondary hd if that makes any difference.  tried booting from the ubuntu cd, mounting the hd, chroot'ing, then grub-install /dev/hda, all with no success
2004-10-10T09:42:00.000Z	ultrafunk	xf	using Warty? or a nightly ISO?
2004-10-10T09:42:00.000Z	xf		warty amd64
2004-10-10T09:43:00.000Z	xf		it's hanging at the "GRUB loading, please wait..." prompt
2004-10-10T09:43:00.000Z	ultrafunk	xf	try - http://archive.ubuntu.com/cdimage/daily/20040924/warty-amd64.iso
2004-10-10T09:43:00.000Z	xf		ok, ta
2004-10-10T09:44:00.000Z	ultrafunk	xf	that's the ISO I used, for some reason Warty failed the same way when I tried to install it from CD
2004-10-10T09:44:00.000Z	xf	eldados	no, but it's not hard to boot up a knoppix cd et al if needed
2004-10-10T09:44:00.000Z	xf		ah, fair enough
2004-10-10T09:44:00.000Z	xf		i mean, it installed fine, grub just doesn't want to play ball
2004-10-10T09:45:00.000Z	xf		doh, only getting 10kb/sec off that site
2004-10-10T09:45:00.000Z	xf		theoretically i should be able to boot from a cd, mount the hd, chroot into it, then apt-get update && apt-get -u dist-upgrade, right?
2004-10-10T09:45:00.000Z	xf		assuming if it's a problem solved by a later grub?
2004-10-10T09:47:00.000Z	xf		what motherboard?  i'm randomly guessing here but maybe it's an ide chipset issue
2004-10-10T09:48:00.000Z	xf		never mind, i just reinstalled ubuntu exactly the same way i did before and now it's booting
2004-10-10T09:49:00.000Z	ultrafunk	xf	mine was the k8v, same as yours
