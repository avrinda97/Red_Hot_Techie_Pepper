2009-07-31T06:08:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		anu ideas why aptitude wouldnt dl anything from the uni or multi repos?
2009-07-31T06:10:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		I really need to get the universe and multi repos enabled, I know I'm askin frequently, but I got a splitting headache, and I cant restart cause I'm making a LiveCD, and I need certain files
2009-07-31T06:11:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Less there's a way to get a .deb file in there from outside the repos
2009-07-31T06:12:00.000Z	danbhfive	GodfatherofEire	you can get links to deb files at packages.ubuntu.com  ...   Im not sure whats going on with you not getting those other repos, have you checked your sources.list?
2009-07-31T06:12:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	danbhfive	yeah, but i dont know of another way to load the program into a liveCD other than via aptitude
2009-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	danbhfive	GodfatherofEire	whats the error?
2009-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	danbhfive	there isnt an error, thre just are no packages from uni or multi repos showin up
2009-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	danbhfive	GodfatherofEire	does update hit those repos?
2009-07-31T06:15:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		no, but its wierd, cause they should be enabled
2009-07-31T06:18:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		!aptitude
2009-07-31T06:19:00.000Z	danbhfive	GodfatherofEire	try editing /etc/apt/sources.list   and add the repos there
2009-07-31T06:20:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Ok, I've checked the software sources, and nothin, still not checkin uni and multi, so how would I add em from aptitude
2009-07-31T06:21:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		!repos
2009-07-31T06:22:00.000Z	danbhfive	GodfatherofEire	I just told you
2009-07-31T06:22:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	danbhfive	I know, i need to know the apt urls
2009-07-31T06:23:00.000Z	danbhfive	GodfatherofEire	you just use the existing url for main, and add: universe multiverse restricted
2009-07-31T06:24:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		riight
2009-07-31T06:26:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	danbhfive	that should do it
