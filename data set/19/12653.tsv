2005-08-11T15:27:00.000Z	catolh		Anyone else having trouble with gDesklets?
2005-08-11T15:28:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Don't install the gdesklets-data package. Or is it something else?
2005-08-11T15:28:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Okay, what's wrong? :>
2005-08-11T15:28:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	i installed only the gdesklets package. And when i start it, the window just pops up.. showing nothing, not even a menu.. then it just quits
2005-08-11T15:32:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	what i first did was install both packages.. (gdesklets + gdesklets_data), but then i removed both, and installed only the gdesklets package.
2005-08-11T15:33:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Good. So what's wrong? :)
2005-08-11T15:34:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	ok, ill try that
2005-08-11T15:35:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	thanks.. it worked :)
2005-08-11T05:24:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Never had that, but xcompmgr is known to be buggy.
2005-08-11T05:24:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	bah... the only way to get gdesklets transparent is to use xcompmgr right?.. :\
2005-08-11T05:25:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Well you can use fake transparency... I'm happy with that, as the gdesklets don't move anyway.
2005-08-11T05:25:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	how?.. :o
2005-08-11T05:25:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	But yes, real transparency only with xcompmgr.
2005-08-11T05:25:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	It's on by default...
2005-08-11T05:26:00.000Z	catolh	Tomcat_	hm..weird.. its not on here.. its a black square around the gdesklets
2005-08-11T05:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	http://w3studi.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~breiersn/Screenshot.png
2005-08-11T05:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Well if you disable xcompmgr you need to disable the translucency in gdesklets...
2005-08-11T05:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	Then it'll look like on my screenshot.
2005-08-11T05:27:00.000Z	Tomcat_	catolh	If you disable xcompmgr and have translucency in gdesklets enabled it will have a border. :)
