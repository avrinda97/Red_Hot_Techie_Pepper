2009-08-30T23:26:00.000Z	djzn		what`s better for ubuntu... A780GM-A or GF8200-A
2009-08-30T23:27:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: for better gpu support go for nvidia
2009-08-30T23:28:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	is it true that even the old ATI drivers don`t even have half the features their windows counterparts or nvidia have?
2009-08-30T23:29:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: amd is improving their gpu drivers. u can wait and watch
2009-08-30T23:29:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: check phronix.com
2009-08-30T23:38:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	what about Shapphire motherboards, are they good ?
2009-08-30T23:40:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: sapphire mobos are gud too
2009-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: ati gpu will work out of the box, but not all gpu features will bw available plus the performance will suffer too
2009-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	I am told of that.... I just ran GLXGEARS and it is 670 FPS
2009-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: i kno amd is improving their both gpu and open source driver. you need to check more than glxgear
2009-08-31T00:02:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	is there any application to test the full capped potential of the X1200 ATI IGP on this board:
2009-08-31T00:03:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: maybe u should try some gane like nexuiz
2009-08-31T00:04:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: even better, try the phoronix test suit
2009-08-31T00:04:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	can it be run on the livecd ?
2009-08-31T00:05:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	do you think Intel boards are good?
2009-08-31T00:05:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: hell no. intels igp suck
2009-08-31T00:06:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: yes they are better supported in respect of open source drivers. nonetheless they suck
2009-08-31T00:07:00.000Z	djzn	abhifx	they can even be worse than a `non` supported ATI or capped ATI driver?
2009-08-31T00:08:00.000Z	abhifx	djzn	: i already told u amd are increasing their gpu drivers, i think already they are better than intel
