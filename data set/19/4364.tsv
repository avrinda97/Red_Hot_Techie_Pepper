2009-01-29T06:20:00.000Z	syzygy		I need to reinstall gdm, but I cannot connect to the internet to dl, and I do not have a live cd...can I mount a usb key with the package and install from terminal (sicne I have no gui)?
2009-01-29T06:20:00.000Z	syzygy		stupid gnome
2009-01-29T06:21:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	I think it's do-able
2009-01-29T06:22:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	you should be able to use apt-get if you have the debs
2009-01-29T06:23:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	so just dl them on this computer, onto usb, and run install as a normal command? or should I move them somewhere?
2009-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	that would work if you can use another net connection, yes
2009-01-29T06:24:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	so you only have the alternate install?
2009-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	? I am not sure what you mean, I am runnign debian on a separate comp with a gui, my laptop has all of my data on it and lost gdm, and anm internet connection. No live cd...
2009-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	if that is what you mean by alternate install, not sure...but I still need to find the packages
2009-01-29T06:26:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	 do you have a usb stick or CD to burn to?
2009-01-29T06:26:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	just usb
2009-01-29T06:27:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	I'm sure there is a way
2009-01-29T06:28:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	what happend to the ubuntu desktop?
2009-01-29T06:28:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	it's still there, but I lsot my gui
2009-01-29T06:28:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	how is it lost?
2009-01-29T06:29:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	I can see all the folders in terminal but I cannot get back to it, and sudo apt-get install gdm says gnome is missing
2009-01-29T06:29:00.000Z	syzygy	virianflux	I cannot fetch packages, internet search reveals I need cd to install select packages w/o internet
2009-01-29T06:30:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	yes you just need the package list for ubuntu-desktop
2009-01-29T06:30:00.000Z	virianflux	syzygy	 wget them all to usb?
