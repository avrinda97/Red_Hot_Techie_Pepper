2011-09-25T08:01:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	you likely mistakenly did grub-install /dev/sda3 instead of /dev/sda and then blew through the warnings. As for removing that, you could use dd but im not sure how to do that savely
2011-09-25T08:01:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	safely
2011-09-25T08:02:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	a low level disk modification tool
2011-09-25T08:03:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	escott	i use boot-repair
2011-09-25T08:04:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	escott	and i installed the grub in separate sda, and i select sda6
2011-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	you mean you want to have sda6 be a /boot partition? the reason you aren't booting is that your mbr is looking to sda3 and its /boot directory
2011-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	whatever is in sda6 is not being used right now
2011-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	escott	so escott how to fix that?
2011-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	how do you want your boot to work. do you want to use what is in sda6 or what is in sda3
2011-09-25T08:09:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	in that case you need to 1) boot the live cd 2) mount the sda3 partition but not the sda6 partition 3) remove the files in /mount/sda3/boot 4) mount sda6 onto /mount/sda3/boot 5) chroot into /mount/sda3 6) run grub-install /dev/sda
2011-09-25T08:10:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	escott	now i'm in live cd i'll try now
2011-09-25T08:14:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	escott	what the command to mount sda3?
2011-09-25T08:16:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	sudo mkdir /media/sda3; sudo mount /dev/sda3 /media/sda3
2011-09-25T08:19:00.000Z	iqbalkhan	escott	how to remove file /sda3/boot?
2011-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	escott	iqbalkhan	i need to get to sleep. but its basically the following: sudo -i; mkdir /media/sda3; mount /dev/sda3/ /media/sda3; mount (and make sure sda6 is not mounted); rm -rf /media/sda3/boot/*; mount /dev/sda6 /media/sda3/boot; mount -t bind /dev /media/sda3/dev; there are a few others like the last check the chroot instructions; chroot /media/sda3; grub-install /dev/sda
