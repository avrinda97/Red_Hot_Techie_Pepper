2006-04-20T15:05:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	sorry, i use k3b (about the only kde app i like)
2006-04-20T15:05:00.000Z	Tedd	disasm	will K3b work with gnome
2006-04-20T15:05:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	if you don't mind the extra libraries, sudo apt-get install k3b should do the trick
2006-04-20T15:13:00.000Z	Tedd	disasm	I downloaded k3b, but it says Unsupported Format
2006-04-20T15:13:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	what format is it?
2006-04-20T15:13:00.000Z	Tedd	disasm	mp3
2006-04-20T15:17:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	is lame installed?
2006-04-20T15:17:00.000Z	Tedd	disasm	sudo apt-get install lame?
2006-04-20T15:18:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	try it, i don't remember if it's on a restricted source though
2006-04-20T15:19:00.000Z	Tedd	disasm	 it wasn't installed
2006-04-20T15:20:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	what about k3b-mp3 if that doesn't work
2006-04-20T15:21:00.000Z	Tedd	disasm	that fixed it
2006-04-20T15:22:00.000Z	disasm	Tedd	awesome, perfect timing to, cause servers going to be ready for me to do stuff in less than a minute!
