2009-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	Netham46		"[notice caught SIGWINCH, shutting down gracefully"  I'm getting that in my Apache error log, and nothing works. Anyone know how I can fix this?
2009-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> what triggered this?
2009-01-17T05:39:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	semingly nothing. It was running perfectly for almost a year, then it went down earlier, and this is what I'm getting.
2009-01-17T05:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> anyone was hitting your apache when it broke or just out of the blue?
2009-01-17T05:40:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	I was browsing some forums I host when it started.
2009-01-17T05:40:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> wait a second, browsing some forums?  that is not your apache server, it is someone else at the remote site.. am confused
2009-01-17T05:41:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	it's my server, I host some forums that I was looking at.
2009-01-17T05:41:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	I'll brb.
2009-01-17T05:53:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	I'm back, btw.
2009-01-17T05:54:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> okay, did you bring snacks? am hungry..lol
2009-01-17T05:54:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	lol.
2009-01-17T05:54:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	but, know what's going on? =/
2009-01-17T05:55:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> about that sigwinch?  i think gnutron is correct about that
2009-01-17T05:55:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	I wasn't web browsing on the server, it's headless and CLI only.
2009-01-17T05:56:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	and the error reoccurs every time I try to start my website
2009-01-17T05:56:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> umm can you post in pastebin the logs of apache or perhaps ask the nice folks at #apache to help troubleshoot?
2009-01-17T05:57:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	logs'll be hard right now, but I'll ask in apache.
2009-01-17T05:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	Netham46	-> okay good luck
2009-01-17T05:57:00.000Z	Netham46	n8tuser	thanks, heh.
