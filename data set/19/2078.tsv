2010-08-29T07:13:00.000Z	forge_		trying to remove ubuntu and grub and rewrite a windows mbr on a dual booted laptop so I can give it back to my dad
2010-08-29T07:13:00.000Z	forge_		does anyone know how to do this
2010-08-29T07:14:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	just reinstall windows and repartition everything
2010-08-29T07:26:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	you could try fixmbr to get the windows bootloader then use gparted to format the linux partition to NTFS
2010-08-29T07:26:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	if I had a windows recovery disk to use fixmbr
2010-08-29T07:26:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	so i need something to do that in a live cd
2010-08-29T07:27:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	i don't know about it really but you might be able to find a download and put it on a floppy
2010-08-29T07:34:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	you could try something in Ultimate Boot CD
2010-08-29T07:34:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	what to be exact?
2010-08-29T07:35:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	it comes with a bunch of freeware tools, so it has several for boot management...you could read about them and maybe find one that does what you need
2010-08-29T07:36:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	I will look into this right now
2010-08-29T07:39:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	I guess I could try a supergrub disk
2010-08-29T07:40:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	i haven't used any of those tools, i just knew it existed.....you'll have to experiment and hopefully at least get windows to boot
2010-08-29T07:45:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	if you can manage to boot into windows you can probably edit boot.ini to allow you to boot into a recovery console and use fixmbr
2010-08-29T07:47:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	I just stuck at grub loading
2010-08-29T07:47:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	which is why I though I could use supergrub to fix grub and just leave grub running and get into windows and not have any linux partitions
2010-08-29T07:48:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	can you get to a shell and run sudo update-grub
2010-08-29T07:49:00.000Z	forge_	extraclassic	maybe it goes into the grub recovery shell
2010-08-29T07:52:00.000Z	extraclassic	forge_	i found this - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351
