2006-03-02T11:15:00.000Z	babo		thanks guys !!! it works !
2006-03-02T11:16:00.000Z	babo		... back again, hi guys :)
2006-03-02T11:18:00.000Z	babo		I also have a video problem. My nvidia video card is recognised and I have the nvidia packages from synaptic installed - but I have video issues. Every once in a while the screen blots out. And I have the 'ghost cursor' problem. Where I would have a long line of cursors that remain on the screen even after I have moved them.
2006-03-02T11:19:00.000Z	babo		by video here - I mean graphics - not actual vide
2006-03-02T11:19:00.000Z	babo		o
2006-03-02T11:20:00.000Z	babo		anyone else get the 'ghost cursor' problem ?
2006-03-02T11:20:00.000Z	babo		My sound is working for but according to lspci ...  Multimedia audio controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device  ... what does this mean exactly then ?
2006-03-02T11:21:00.000Z	asymmetry	babo	do you have an nforce mobo?
2006-03-02T11:21:00.000Z	babo	asymmetry	yep ... geforce6
2006-03-02T11:22:00.000Z	asymmetry	babo	if you have an nforce mobo with integrated sound, it may not recognize everything about your sound chipset - it tends to respond to two different driver sets
2006-03-02T11:24:00.000Z	babo	asymmetry	what are the two driversets ?
2006-03-02T11:25:00.000Z	asymmetry	babo	one of them is the nforce chipset drivers - the other, if its the right chipset, are the Realtek ALC850 drivers
2006-03-02T11:27:00.000Z	babo	asymmetry	why are there two chipsets ? why does nvidia use Realtek drivers ? why don't they just build drivers for their own chipset ?
2006-03-02T11:28:00.000Z	asymmetry	babo	its only one chipset, but it responds to both drivers - nvidia doesn't use realtek drivers, realtek uses nvidia drivers, its actually a realtek chip
2006-03-02T11:29:00.000Z	babo	asymmetry	hmmm ... well if the same chipset responds to both drivers - why don't they show up on lspci ? ... which drivers does lspci check for ?
2006-03-02T11:30:00.000Z	asymmetry	babo	lspci doesnt check for drivers. it checks for devices that have a driver that has correctly identified them
2006-03-02T11:31:00.000Z	babo	asymmetry	... and the realtek/nvidia drivers don't correctly identify their chipset ?
2006-03-02T11:31:00.000Z	asymmetry	babo	you dont have either installed, i dont think
2006-03-02T11:33:00.000Z	babo	asymmetry	so then it's working off a legacy example ?
