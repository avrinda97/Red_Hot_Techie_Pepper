2008-07-14T04:52:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	yes
2008-07-14T04:53:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	what's the grub error ?
2008-07-14T04:54:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	"grub stage 1.5 read error "
2008-07-14T04:55:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	do you have two drives or only one ?
2008-07-14T04:56:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	and do you have ubuntu only or ubuntu and windows ?
2008-07-14T04:57:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	all right, you may try this (on the livecd) : sudo grub. Then type "root (hd0,0)" then "setup (hd0)", then reboot and see what happens
2008-07-14T04:57:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	i was following this http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-615668.html but it quite didnt work
2008-07-14T05:01:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	the link you tried to follow should work. But it may prove difficult if you're not used to it.
2008-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	removing everything and trying again won't hurt i guess :)
2008-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	it's not anymore, it's all deleted now : P
2008-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	all right, well, you may have more luck this time :)
2008-07-14T05:13:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	im on 7.10
2008-07-14T05:13:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	why don't you install 8.04 ?
2008-07-14T05:14:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	it threw me to ... forgot what was it, s something box, alot of troubles with it, so some ppl said that the only help was to just get earlier version and then update it
2008-07-14T05:16:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	20gb system is way more than enough
2008-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	why don't you use the built-in installer, tell him to use the entire disk and be done with it ?
2008-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	PhoenixUK	kyncani	thats what i did earlier and I got all these problems now ;], so just making sure this time its right
2008-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	kyncani	PhoenixUK	:) i see (sorry)
