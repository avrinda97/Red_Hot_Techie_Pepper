2012-01-22T07:07:00.000Z	poobiebear		How do I check link speed again? I Can't remember how to see that with ip.
2012-01-22T07:08:00.000Z	poobiebear		And dmesg isn't telling me anything useful.
2012-01-22T07:08:00.000Z	poobiebear		one second. Gonna disconnect.
2012-01-22T07:10:00.000Z	poobiebear		Hallo?
2012-01-22T07:11:00.000Z	poobiebear		Hnnh. Maybe I was running the hand-rolled 3.2 kernel. I have no success with that card now.
2012-01-22T07:11:00.000Z	poobiebear		Link speed is 10mbps, according to NetworkManager
2012-01-22T07:11:00.000Z	poobiebear		and I can't get a DHCP lease.
2012-01-22T07:11:00.000Z	poobiebear		:/
2012-01-22T07:11:00.000Z	poobiebear		Hmka.y
2012-01-22T07:11:00.000Z	poobiebear		K
2012-01-22T07:12:00.000Z	WoC	poobiebear	is that a intel nic ?
2012-01-22T07:12:00.000Z	poobiebear	WoC	the "flakey" card is not. It's an onboard NiC.
2012-01-22T07:13:00.000Z	WoC	poobiebear	which nic is it ?
2012-01-22T07:14:00.000Z	poobiebear	WoC	I have a PCIE Intel nic that works wonderfully.
2012-01-22T07:15:00.000Z	WoC	poobiebear	check if bringing the nic up and down a few times manual does anything
2012-01-22T07:16:00.000Z	poobiebear	WoC	Okay. I just came in here for policykit help, but I figured out that myself. :)
2012-01-22T07:19:00.000Z	poobiebear	WoC	Bringing the Realtek nic up and down twice made it work.
2012-01-22T07:19:00.000Z	WoC	poobiebear	heh nice :) used to help me 2
2012-01-22T07:20:00.000Z	poobiebear	WoC	anything you want me to try while I'm here?
