2006-03-17T09:47:00.000Z	slew		hi, has anyone ever seen this: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.6' not found ?
2006-03-17T09:47:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	What version of glibc do you have installeD?
2006-03-17T09:49:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	2.2, afaik
2006-03-17T09:50:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	 The error is saying it wants 3.4.6 it looks like.
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	yah, its not available anywhere that i've found so far. any ideas where to look?
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	What program are you trying to install?
2006-03-17T09:52:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	just a game, Widelands. its in the repositories, im trying to get the new version.
2006-03-17T09:52:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	 Is the new version for Breezy or for dapper?
2006-03-17T09:53:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	If it is for dapper, then you may need to look to dapper for some of the libs.
2006-03-17T09:53:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	its got both source and 'executable.' i've tried to build from source and using the 'executable' but get the same problem
2006-03-17T09:54:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	would it break a lot of stuff if i added a few dapper repositories to the breezy sources.list?
2006-03-17T09:54:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	 You likely will.  It is trying to load a module dynamically.  If the module is not there it cannot load it.
2006-03-17T09:55:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	 I don't know.  It is possible.
2006-03-17T09:56:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	 Another possability is to just download the .deb file for that lib.  Keep the .deb file for the old on on standby just incase.  When it tells you what files will be effected, read the list it shows so you know if you want to continue with the install.
2006-03-17T09:56:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	where would i find the .deb for that? i've been googling but all i can find are rpms.
2006-03-17T09:58:00.000Z	Nabiki	slew	start with packages.ubuntu.com   if you cant find it there, move on to packages.debian.org
2006-03-17T09:58:00.000Z	slew	Nabiki	cool thanks homie.
