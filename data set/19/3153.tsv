2012-11-19T00:35:00.000Z	oversize		hi, is there a channel where i could get help using testdisk to recover my data from a usb harddisk? i can see the data, but i can not copy them (no space) cant i just "apply" the found partitions? It does not work for me and i dont know why ...
2012-11-19T00:36:00.000Z	MoL0ToV	oversize	what means that you cannot copy them?
2012-11-19T00:37:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	it seems incredibly slow and its about 200G
2012-11-19T00:37:00.000Z	MoL0ToV	oversize	dmesg what say? there are errors releted to disk?
2012-11-19T00:38:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	yes ... (its on other pc so cant copy)   "Buffer IO error on device sdc"
2012-11-19T00:39:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	 testdisk lists  partitions and files fine though
2012-11-19T00:39:00.000Z	MoL0ToV	oversize	you can try do use dd_rescue to make a bit a bit image to another position, then try to mount with loop option
2012-11-19T00:40:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	ddrescue  will make "the whole thing" image? i mean if there is 500G data  it will be a 500G image?
2012-11-19T00:41:00.000Z	MoL0ToV	oversize	no, if your disk is 200GB the image is 200GB also if only 10MB of data is present
2012-11-19T00:41:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	ubuntu says i would have to go to win and run checkntfs (or so) but in windows i only get to "formath hd?"
2012-11-19T00:41:00.000Z	oversize		its a 1000G usb drive and i dont have enough space for that 8(
2012-11-19T00:42:00.000Z	MoL0ToV		is ntfs?
2012-11-19T00:42:00.000Z	oversize		yes
2012-11-19T00:43:00.000Z	MoL0ToV		you can try fsck.ntfs in ubuntu
2012-11-19T00:43:00.000Z	MoL0ToV	oversize	you can try fsck.ntfs in ubuntu
2012-11-19T00:44:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	thats what dmesg says: http://dpaste.com/832991/
2012-11-19T00:45:00.000Z	MoL0ToV	oversize	you can try fsck.ntfs , and then try to mount
2012-11-19T00:45:00.000Z	MoL0ToV		if don't work the only thing to do is use dd_rescue , ask friends for a disk of 1TB
2012-11-19T00:45:00.000Z	oversize	MoL0ToV	thanks, i will, do you know what package is fsck.ntfs in?
