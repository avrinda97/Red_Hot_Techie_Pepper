2012-04-26T02:23:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	to some extent the disc is a tool yes, but a in place repair like windows is not there.
2012-04-26T02:23:00.000Z	amaroks		so I have few thingsbroken
2012-04-26T02:24:00.000Z	amaroks		can't I reinstall ubuntu and keep my ubuntu documents etc ?
2012-04-26T02:24:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	did you make a separate home partition?
2012-04-26T02:25:00.000Z	amaroks		well its a default ubuntu install beside windows 7
2012-04-26T02:25:00.000Z	amaroks		been using it for long
2012-04-26T02:25:00.000Z	amaroks	Fyodorovna	nothing is seperate
2012-04-26T02:25:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	it ios a dual boot not a wubi install from W7?
2012-04-26T02:25:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		*is
2012-04-26T02:26:00.000Z	amaroks	Fyodorovna	its a dual boot
2012-04-26T02:26:00.000Z	amaroks		i choose on start up screen windows or ubuntu
2012-04-26T02:27:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	you can use the ubuntu live cd to save your docs etc, then reinstall if needed.
2012-04-26T02:27:00.000Z	amaroks		okay so I will have that option when running the live cd?
2012-04-26T02:28:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	yes, but not a gui just your skills to open that partition from home and save your stuf.
2012-04-26T02:29:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	you might be able to fix any problems if you can share them with us as well.
2012-04-26T02:31:00.000Z	amaroks	Fyodorovna	they're too many, gedit for an example the first time i start it it will open then terminate the second time it works, I no longer see Connect to server menu when im on desktop, the dual boot screen changed its look, I still see kde ,kfce, mint when logging in
2012-04-26T02:31:00.000Z	amaroks		and much more
2012-04-26T02:32:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	amaroks	it can get a bit messy if you install all those desktops, probably faster to back up then fix your choice realy.
