2011-04-28T05:51:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	you can configure how fonts look on your current system (and I assume on unity)
2011-04-28T05:53:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	System -> Preferences -> Appearance, then the Fonts tab. If you're using an LCD then turn Subpixel rendering on and then tweak it by clicking Details...
2011-04-28T05:53:00.000Z	tripelb	bloopletech	escott, unless it will get better on reboot I've configured all there is to configure and it's better on windows. I dont want windows, I want fonts I can see with more ease.
2011-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	tripelb	bloopletech	I am using a CRT.
2011-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	you're going to have to be a lot more specific than it's 'better on windows'
2011-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	tripelb	bloopletech	I can read it there. here I have to make it bigger. -- I turned it on 2 days ago and it made no differnce.
2011-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	what
2011-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	I meant grayscale font smoothing
2011-04-28T05:56:00.000Z	tripelb	bloopletech	thanks for the help. I'm too tired to remember how to get there now.
2011-04-28T05:56:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	WRT your other questions, the easiest way to partition your drives is probably to burn a livecd, boot into that and use gparted to divide your drive in half - though you may want swap partitions for each installation
2011-04-28T06:00:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	regarding accessing your other hard drive: if you go Places -> Computer your other drive sohuld be there and you should be able to double click it to access the files on that drive
2011-04-28T06:12:00.000Z	tripelb	bloopletech	yes all you say is true. I can access them. I cannot copy them because I dont have permission. when I log into the other drive I cannot even see my normal filesystem. I can only see the filesystem I am on and 2 windows partitions and one NTFS partions. (I have 3 drives mounted.)
2011-04-28T06:13:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	ah I see. To deal with the permissions issue you may be able to run gksudo nautilus and copy the files in that window
2011-04-28T06:13:00.000Z	bloopletech	tripelb	I'm not sure why you can't see the partition from the other installation
2011-04-28T06:15:00.000Z	tripelb	bloopletech	I copy what you say and do it another day. Peace. Thanks a lot for working with me.
