2012-01-11T04:22:00.000Z	arphetic		Hi, how can i burn an iso file to an usb stick?
2012-01-11T04:22:00.000Z	arphetic		a windows xp iso
2012-01-11T04:22:00.000Z	arphetic		actually
2012-01-11T04:23:00.000Z	arphetic		##windows wont tell me how to make a bootable usb disk in ubuntu
2012-01-11T04:23:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	of course they wont ;) .... but try unetbootin
2012-01-11T04:25:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2012-01-11T04:25:00.000Z	arphetic	alien2050	i just want to burn the installation file to the usb disk, not actually install XP on the disk. Will UnetBootin still do this?
2012-01-11T04:25:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	not sure I understand, but if you want a live USB with ubuntu on it, try this tool
2012-01-11T04:26:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	cuz you're talking about XP which I don't get.... why......
2012-01-11T04:27:00.000Z	arphetic	alien2050	I have ubuntu, i want to install XP next to Ubuntu. Thus I dloaded an installation cd of XP, and im trying to burn that iso to a USB stick, so i can boot the installation from that USB stick, so i can install XP next to ubuntu
2012-01-11T04:28:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	usually it's the other way around, because M$ will gladly erase your boot sector
2012-01-11T04:30:00.000Z	arphetic	alien2050	also I was trying to just write the iso to a cd, however ubuntu doesnt recognize my cd when i put it in

2012-01-11T04:32:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	try with the utility "k3b" or "brasero"
2012-01-11T04:34:00.000Z	arphetic	alien2050	to burn to CD you mean?
2012-01-11T04:34:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	yep
2012-01-11T04:34:00.000Z	arphetic	alien2050	due to some bug, Ubuntu wont recognise my cdrom drive
2012-01-11T04:34:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	try unetbootin if you want to burn to usb
2012-01-11T04:35:00.000Z	alien2050	arphetic	then burn directly the iso to USB, forget cd
