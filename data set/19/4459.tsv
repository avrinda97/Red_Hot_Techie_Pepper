2011-07-30T12:47:00.000Z	pr0ton		why doesnt this command work?
2011-07-30T12:47:00.000Z	pr0ton		fgrep -r "is_active" ".*py"
2011-07-30T12:47:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	how doesn't it work?
2011-07-30T12:49:00.000Z	pr0ton	Viking667	i dont think that tells me which files i'm using
2011-07-30T12:49:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	sigh. that's what the -n is for on the grep line.
2011-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	awww, gee. I'm heartbroken.
2011-07-30T12:57:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	uhm, works for me. What're you doing wrong?
2011-07-30T12:57:00.000Z	pr0ton	Viking667	*py works?
2011-07-30T12:58:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	ahhh. You're getting "No such file or directory", right?
2011-07-30T12:58:00.000Z	pr0ton	Viking667	i have py files in the dir i'm running this from too
2011-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	we showed you one.
2011-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	hm?
2011-07-30T13:01:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	for what you want, my find command works well.
2011-07-30T13:03:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	what's got you set against using find? (aside from the fact it's two processes)
2011-07-30T13:04:00.000Z	pr0ton	Viking667	i have to type more
2011-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	dude. I spend my whole DAY at the flaming commandline.
2011-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	pr0ton	Viking667	you can spend less of a day if you typed less :P
2011-07-30T13:06:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	ahh, but then I wouldn't get half of what I want done.
2011-07-30T13:07:00.000Z	Viking667	pr0ton	after all. You try typing a document without using a keyboard. It can be done, but it's a pain in the bum.
