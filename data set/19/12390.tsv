2007-01-25T10:26:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		<thomas_> my sound keyboard shortcuts put down the false channel on my soundcard anyone know how to solve this ? <== I have the exact same issue and do not know how to resolve this.
2007-01-25T10:27:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	thats a little bit hard because i don't know what scripts are responsible for putting down sound
2007-01-25T10:28:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	a solution would be very good
2007-01-25T10:28:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	yes, unfortunately, I haven't been able to find one.
2007-01-25T10:29:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	do you also get shown two soundcards in the gnome volume manager ?
2007-01-25T10:35:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	I will do!
2007-01-25T10:50:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	any progress ?
2007-01-25T10:52:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	no. I can't see what the command that the keyshortcut is calling :-(
2007-01-25T10:52:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	ahhh thats bad
2007-01-25T10:52:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	would be a great progess if we would know what script is called
2007-01-25T10:53:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	yeah, I just can't find it though.
2007-01-25T10:53:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	i will look through the source code of gnome volume manager
2007-01-25T10:54:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	I tried that, but it's a binary.
2007-01-25T10:54:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	hmmm that will be hard in a way
2007-01-25T11:16:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	maybe come to #alsa and watch join my conversation with a other guy
2007-01-25T11:16:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	maybe he has a solution
2007-01-25T11:18:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	I'm in #alsa now but nobody is talking!
2007-01-25T11:18:00.000Z	thomas_	Lunar_Lamp	i think he is searching for a solution
2007-01-25T11:53:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	thomas_	did you manage to get the volume problem sorted?
