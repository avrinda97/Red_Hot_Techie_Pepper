2006-10-08T11:59:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	oh my god. dpkg-scanpackages? No. dpkg -i is all you need. Or gdeb.
2006-10-08T12:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	He did say: apt-get or aptitude
2006-10-08T12:01:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	BTW I think he
2006-10-08T12:02:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	yeah, I think he's already using my suggestion though. He's just looking for something that he can install it with, and dpkg -i works fine. if you want to build a local repo (Don't come to the list for that. You have to be major techie) then you go to dpkg-scanpackages.
2006-10-08T12:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	Sometimes I would consider using dpkg-scanpackages if I wanted to use somebody else's apt archives.
2006-10-08T12:03:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	I use it to, but I don't ever reccomend it for newbies.
2006-10-08T12:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	Nor do I, but I don't recommend newbies install distinct .deb's either.
2006-10-08T12:04:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	yeah, but if they have it, it's better than nothing. debs are pretty simple, whereas dpkg-scanpackages is more difficult.
2006-10-08T12:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	For desktops, I'm torn between Debian and Ubuntu, actually - Debian can have rather nice DVD's.
2006-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	And since debian is slow to change, those can stay reaosnably up-to-date for quite a while. :)
2006-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	I go with gentoo and Ubuntu. Gentoo servers, and my geeky desktop, and Ubuntu for my wife, kids, and "easy" computers.
2006-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	My server is OBSD :)
2006-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	But I generally prefer Debian.
2006-10-08T12:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	it's quite easy - though Ubuntu wins on hardware, and it _is_ just a little more polished.
2006-10-08T12:08:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	I have a FreeBSD server, but I rarely use it. Just not fast enough.
2006-10-08T12:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	Thanks.
2006-10-08T12:11:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	for what?
2006-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	dragonfyre13	Ubuntu repos on DVD.
2006-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	Arafangion	np.
