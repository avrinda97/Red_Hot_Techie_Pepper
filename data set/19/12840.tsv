2005-12-06T14:25:00.000Z	levander		Anybody can tell me why when I click "burn" in k3b, the only option in the resulting dialog is to "Only Create Image"? I don't want to only create the image, I want to burn the image to the DVD.
2005-12-06T14:26:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	a .iso type thing?
2005-12-06T14:26:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	not sure what you mean, but yeah, a dvd image is an iso file
2005-12-06T14:28:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	no, i've got a bunch of files that I want k3b to burn to a data dvd, but "only create image" sounds like its going to stop before the image gets burned to dvd.  I don't just want an iso.  I want the iso on the dvd.
2005-12-06T14:29:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	asked in #kubuntu?
2006-11-29T09:04:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	it is a tool made for the purpose of upgrading in Ubuntu, they intend to increase its checkas.
2006-11-29T09:05:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	they don't have a command line interface to it?
2006-11-29T09:08:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	well, that is just what I got out of the https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/OpenWeek_AskMark search for "<pointwood>" in that page
2006-11-29T09:08:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	I still do not believe any of it, since I know little about it still.
2006-11-29T09:08:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	supposedly it will check for changes done by things such as automatix, and so on.
2006-11-29T09:12:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	what's automatix?
2006-11-29T09:13:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	ask google, it has a link.
2006-11-29T09:14:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	Thanks, you are very informative.
2006-11-29T09:15:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	the thing is that I could have went to google, and typed in automatix and gave you some links, or referred you to my source, I think the latter is the right choice.
2006-11-29T09:15:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	If you don't know what automatix is, you could have also just said I don't know?
2006-11-29T09:16:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	I do have some kind of idea what it is, but think their official site and the collective web have more knowledge.
2006-12-10T13:02:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	what about eth1 ath0 wlan0 or something like that?
2006-12-10T13:02:00.000Z	levander	dabaR	ummm, you would just start trying that stuff randomly, or there is way to look up what it is?
2006-12-10T13:03:00.000Z	dabaR	levander	not sure
