2010-03-18T09:00:00.000Z	madvirus420		I am using ubuntu 9.04. I had nvidia 8500 which i have removed for some reason. I have an on-board graphic card which I want to use now. But, the hardware drivers is not displaying any drivers to use. Can anyone help me install the graphic card?
2010-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	you can see graphics, right?
2010-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	there's probably already a driver in use. that tool is only for if you need closed-source drivers
2010-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	yes, lspci is showing it.
2010-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	if your onboard uses open source drivers, the hardware drivers tool is unnecessary and wont show anything
2010-03-18T09:02:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	because the graphics should start working automagically
2010-03-18T09:02:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	but i can enable 'special effects' in appearance. also, the display is laggy. i can't watch videos too.
2010-03-18T09:02:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	what are your onboard graphics?
2010-03-18T09:03:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Xpress 200 Host Bridge
2010-03-18T09:03:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	could try installing xserver-xorg-video-fglrx
2010-03-18T09:03:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	a'right. lets see.
2010-03-18T09:05:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	E: Couldn't find package xserver-xorg-video-fglrx
2010-03-18T09:06:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	I have xserver-xorg-video-ati installed
2010-03-18T09:06:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	renamed apparently. this: xorg-driver-fglrx  exist?  -ati is the open source driver. for some stuff it works better. you might need fglrx, which is the closed source driver
2010-03-18T09:08:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	xorg-driver-fglrx does exist? should i install it ?
2010-03-18T09:08:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	: does exist! *
2010-03-18T09:08:00.000Z	maco	madvirus420	yeah give that a try
2010-03-18T09:11:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	installed. reboot
2010-03-18T09:19:00.000Z	madvirus420	maco	did not work. brought me to a frozen messed up login screen where i couldn't even see the login. entered the rescue mode and uninstalled it.
