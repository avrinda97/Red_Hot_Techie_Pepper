2010-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	The_Janitor		guys my cronjobs are not running, it is a really simple cronjob, nothing special,  cron is running. i have no idea where to begin
2010-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	what line are you using?
2010-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	and have you checked your mail?

2010-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	The_Janitor		sec
2010-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	The_Janitor	Gnea	mail? which one?
2010-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	localhost
2010-11-03T06:51:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	hm, yeah, you're doing it wrong. you can't run a shell script like that. and why did you put it in /bin/?
2010-11-03T06:51:00.000Z	The_Janitor	Gnea	its not important why i put it in bin, but why cant i run a shell script like that?
2010-11-03T06:52:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	because you can't. you have to chmod 700 /bin/restart-mldonkey and get rid of the /bin/sh
2010-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	since root is the only one that's supposed to run it anyway, 700 will confirm that
2010-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	The_Janitor	Gnea	ok, so it was just the preceeding /bin/sh that was the problem? so i should just do /bin/script
2010-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	pretty much
2010-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	The_Janitor	Gnea	yeh it makes sense.
2010-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	The_Janitor		ok
2010-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	The_Janitor		sec
2010-11-03T06:55:00.000Z	The_Janitor	Gnea	cheers, you are a legend, it works. it is weird, cos normally wheni run a shellscrip i wil do ./script, or if it is a full path i will do 'sh /path/script'
2010-11-03T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	The_Janitor	if the script already has the executable bit set, there's never a need to preceed with /bin/sh
2010-11-03T06:56:00.000Z	The_Janitor	Gnea	ahh ok, so if it doesnt have it set i would use it right?
