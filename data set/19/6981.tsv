2007-11-03T04:31:00.000Z	tnek		Hi people. I need some help. If I want a command line version of Ubuntu, as bare as possible, so that I can install x.org and a window manager myself. I _think_ there are only two paths: Download alternate install of a desktop system OR download the server install. Which route do you recommend?
2007-11-03T04:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	Or you can use the mini.iso
2007-11-03T04:37:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	No I'm not a bot :) I believe it is the same.
2007-11-03T04:38:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	The same. All right. :-)
2007-11-03T04:39:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	I've got the alternate install already. So I think I'll try it. Was mostly worried about kernels and which one is most "bare". But if the difference is merely on the install cd-size, it doesn't matter to me.
2007-11-03T04:39:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	Thanks!
2007-11-03T04:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	I don't think the alternative cd will let you install just the a terminal, though
2007-11-03T04:42:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	Aha. It puts a new light on things... Well, it's burning now so the disc is wasted anyway. I'll try it and report back in some minutes.
2007-11-03T04:44:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	I think the minimal cd is what you're looking for.
2007-11-03T04:44:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	Thanks, I'll be downloading it shortly. :-) I'm about to try Ratpoison. Oo
2007-11-03T04:45:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	the mini is less than 10 MB !
2007-11-03T04:48:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	Ah. Sorry for marking words. When you said "i think" I thought "What the heck, I'm already burning it now I can give it a try" and that I would go with the mini afterwards. :-) But if it's unpossible I'll download the mini right away.
2007-11-03T04:49:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	sound great!
2007-11-03T04:49:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	I'll report back shortly. :-)
2007-11-03T04:50:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	Yep it's there. "Install a command-line system"
2007-11-03T04:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	OK!
2007-11-03T04:51:00.000Z	tnek	Odd-rationale	Once again, thanks! :-) I'll stay and perhaps I'll blurt out another question or two.
2007-11-03T04:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	np
2007-11-03T05:07:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tnek	I like pidgin
