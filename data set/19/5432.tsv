2008-12-27T06:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	What are you exactly trying to do? I came in a little late
2008-12-27T06:04:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	i want to take a file like http://decepticon.rlogin.org/~decepticon/school/knight2e/0000.swf and turn it into a png or jpg or bmp
2008-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	You mean like this? I just extracted this from the swf you gave the link to http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/120933/pic140.jpg
2008-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	thats 404
2008-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	thats error 404
2008-12-27T06:13:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	Yeah hold on. Dropbox is acting up
2008-12-27T06:15:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	Try now. http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/120933/pic140.jpg
2008-12-27T06:15:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	the jpg is not a complete snapshot of the swf file
2008-12-27T06:16:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	Oh. So you want the entire rendered flash movie screen captured?
2008-12-27T06:16:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	yes i want the entire swf, what appears in the browser to you, in a picture file, like a png or a jpg or a bmp
2008-12-27T06:17:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	And screenshot doesn't work b/c it is too big for browser?
2008-12-27T06:18:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	screenshot does not work because it requires scaling up of the swf to an appropriate size... this appropriate size is 1.6 times the real size (since it is vector, it is ok to do this), but this resulting size is too big to fit on my screen to take a screenshot of in 1 shot without gimping around and stitching
2008-12-27T06:21:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	This is what I found. But I doubt it will work with Mono properly. http://bytescout.com/swftoimagegui.html
2008-12-27T06:26:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	icant get that to make the resulting image zoomed in. its zoomed way too out, no matter the resolution
2008-12-27T06:27:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	Well... that is about it I guess. I have ran out of ideas. I don't think you can find something that will convert your swf into an image and zoom in at the same time. Sorry
2008-12-27T06:35:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	That tool works? Under Mono or Wine?
2008-12-27T06:35:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	im using it directly under winxp
2008-12-27T06:35:00.000Z	Decepticon	WebcamWonder	ill try wine, but it says it needs net framework 2.0
2008-12-27T06:36:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Decepticon	Oh ok. :)... Well, best of luck goofing around with that thing :)
