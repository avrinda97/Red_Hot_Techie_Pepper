2008-07-26T21:42:00.000Z	jeeves__		anyone else want to take a stab @ this video issue?
2008-07-26T21:43:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	???
2008-07-26T21:44:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	I'm trying to figure out why my system is freezing, then flashes the screen, then allows me to go back to work after a few mins
2008-07-26T21:45:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	Huh?
2008-07-26T21:45:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	Real weird
2008-07-26T21:45:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	you got nvidia driver working?
2008-07-26T21:46:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	I have a xsession, but randomly, the X will freeze, then flash the screen (white/black) a bunch of times, then go to a "greyed out" screen (like when it asks you to input the admin password), then after a few more seconds, it'll release me back to what I was working on
2008-07-26T21:47:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	I have no ideas
2008-07-26T21:48:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	no one does, and that's what's making it frustrating.
2008-07-26T21:49:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	All the times?
2008-07-26T21:49:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	I mean, have you tried reinstalling?
2008-07-26T21:49:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	yes, it was so bad before that I did a full re-install about 32 hours ago
2008-07-26T21:50:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	it runs fine under windows
2008-07-26T21:51:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	That's the thing, x implements the video in a different way
2008-07-26T21:51:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	maybe you have anti-linux HW
2008-07-26T21:52:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	it's a Toshiba, enough said
2008-07-26T21:52:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	lol?
2008-07-26T21:54:00.000Z	jeeves__	Drk_Guy	this is the second laptop I've had from them.  The first one went the way of the Dell laptops, so they replaced it
2008-07-26T21:54:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	jeeves__	XD
