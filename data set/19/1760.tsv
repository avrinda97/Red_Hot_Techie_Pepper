2011-12-03T11:17:00.000Z	the_3f_rule		Anyone know the easiest way to connect to a nas on xubuntu?
2011-12-03T11:17:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	either Samba, or NFS
2011-12-03T11:18:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	the "easiest" way, is samba... but thats strictly opinion... NFS isn't hard, but if you're using a mixed environment at home (linux, 'doze, mac) it might be easier to just run samba, as all the OS's can access it.
2011-12-03T11:20:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	well, its neither... samba is what your server runs...
2011-12-03T11:20:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	what OS is your server running?
2011-12-03T11:22:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	what version of linux is the NAS running?.. linux is very general
2011-12-03T11:25:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	well, that doesn't have anything to do with it.. but... have you enabled CIFS on the server?
2011-12-03T11:26:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	double check on the server that CIFS is enabled
2011-12-03T11:27:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	thats fine.. i just realized it was saying 979... but still thats at least 400 to much in my opinion..
2011-12-03T11:28:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	anyway, do you have CIFS enabled on the server?
2011-12-03T11:30:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	i've never configured NSF.... look for cifS or SMB
2011-12-03T11:31:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	so did i...
2011-12-03T11:32:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	i would think so.
2011-12-03T11:35:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	on the server, or on xubuntu?.. xubuntu can mount CIFS w/o command line
2011-12-03T11:37:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	lol, i just googled and hit that.
2011-12-03T11:38:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	no problem... so lets start from the top.. setup... you sad you did step 2 (where you enabled NFS)... .. right?
2011-12-03T11:38:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	ok, step 3... on the NFS service, did you add your xubuntu box IP address there?
2011-12-03T11:39:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	well there's our fail
2011-12-03T11:39:00.000Z	KM0201	the_3f_rule	lets take this to PM, because it is straying way off the topic of this channel
