2006-11-16T14:25:00.000Z	oddballin		for GAIM, which file should i download...   gaim-2.0.0beta5.tar.bz2    or   gaim-2.0.0beta5.tar.gz   ?
2006-11-16T14:25:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	they're pretty much going to be identical. they're just different archive formats
2006-11-16T14:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	first, you're going to want to uninstall or divert ubuntu's gaim, though
2006-11-16T14:29:00.000Z	oddballin	ladydoor	i just  uninstall gaim now... what do i need to do to install with the source code?
2006-11-16T14:31:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	ok, first put it in some out-of-the-way spot and unpack it. let me know when you're ready to go on.
2006-11-16T14:31:00.000Z	oddballin	ladydoor	im already ready, but i can't find the archive that i downloaded it on.. desktop?
2006-11-16T14:32:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	sorry, i'm not sure what you mean.
2006-11-16T14:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	cd
2006-11-16T14:33:00.000Z	oddballin	ladydoor	with terminal?
2006-11-16T14:34:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	yup!

2006-11-16T14:37:00.000Z	oddballin	ladydoor	~/dESKTOP$
2006-11-16T14:38:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	well, i don't know anything about gnome per s, but anyway, what you should do is move it somewhere out-of-the-way. i, for example, have a ~/src dir
2006-11-16T14:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	oddballin	i guess let me know...
2006-11-16T14:42:00.000Z	oddballin	ladydoor	 sorry.. im here, but i have guests right now... ;)
