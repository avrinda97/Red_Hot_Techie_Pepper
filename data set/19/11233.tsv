2006-03-20T06:59:00.000Z	vinicius_		hi folks...
2006-03-20T07:00:00.000Z	vinicius_		i have a question.. what would be the best (and hassle free) way to restart with ubuntu, without lose my settings (home and some docs)?
2006-03-20T07:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	back up your home or move it to another partition
2006-03-20T07:02:00.000Z	vinicius_	chuckyp	what i mean by restart is that i messed a lot with my installation, i would like to configure it like the first time, without a full ijnstallation
2006-03-20T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	kill the process
2006-03-20T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	what do you mean everytime?
2006-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	okay so when you start the system firefox opens?
2006-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	I don't understand the problem?
2006-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	if you don't have firefox open it shouldn't be running a process in the background
2006-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	can you remove the old one with apt.
2006-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	and how did you install the "new" one?
2006-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	well follow the ubuntu wiki for instlaling ff1.5 then.
2006-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	vinicius_	chuckyp	installing is not the problem, i already followed the wiki to install, the problem is that i want to intall the latest version *and* get rid of the old one (wich remais loaded everytime i open the 1.5.1)
2006-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	remove it with sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox
2006-03-20T07:22:00.000Z	vinicius_	chuckyp	no dependencies left behind then?
2006-03-20T07:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	I don't know you can do an apt-cache showpkg firefox and see what dependencies it has.
2006-03-20T07:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	DON"T DO THAT NEVER MINE
2006-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	that will break yelp and a whole bunch of stuff
2006-03-20T07:25:00.000Z	chuckyp	vinicius_	I think you missed the step in the wiki about the default version
