2007-04-07T09:34:00.000Z	cmillard		Hey guys, I need some leads, forums haven't helped.  xorg process eats 100% cpu when drawing windows (switching tabs, dragging, etc.).  AMD 4000+, 8800gts, newest nvidia drivers from envy.  Recently upgraded video card, nvidia drivers, and xorg.
2007-04-07T09:35:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	cmillard	are you running XGL?
2007-04-07T09:35:00.000Z	cmillard		Nope, straight xorg
2007-04-07T09:37:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	 I'd think it's normal xorg processing, but it's reeeally bad.  Obnoxiously bad.  I guess I could try XGL, but I do wonder what the root problem is
2007-04-07T09:37:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	cmillard	don't try xgl
2007-04-07T09:38:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	Can you think of anything that would make 2d rendering that slow for xorg?  3-D stuff is great.
2007-04-07T09:39:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	cmillard	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and re-configure your xserver it may help
2007-04-07T09:39:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	 I'm willing to buy that the newest nvidia drivers are causing the problem, being that the 8800gts is new, but I hate giving up
2007-04-07T09:40:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	I believe envy did that when I installed the drivers, but I'll try running it directly
2007-04-07T09:40:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	cmillard	do you _need_ the nvidia drivers? (3d gaming, etc.)
2007-04-07T09:40:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	Yup, Quake 4 ;)
2007-04-07T09:40:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	cmillard	yeah it might be the driver.. did you do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx?
2007-04-07T09:41:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	Tried those previously, they don't work with the geforce 8xxx series, had to use envy as the latest aren't in edgy's repositories yet
2007-04-07T09:43:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	cmillard	:\ maybe try the second-newest nvidia driver
2007-04-07T09:45:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	*laughs* That's an idea!  I'm trying the reconfigure, I'll see how different it is
2007-04-07T09:56:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond		sudo chown root:audio /dev/snd
2007-04-07T09:58:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	Thanks for the feedback, restarting X with the new config.
2007-04-07T10:00:00.000Z	cmillard	hyperactivecrond	Nope, no worky :/
