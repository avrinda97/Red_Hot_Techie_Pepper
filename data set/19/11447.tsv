2006-01-19T07:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	uname -r
2006-01-19T07:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	then you need to recompile the 1.0.10 drivers like you did last time
2006-01-19T07:15:00.000Z	Dave|id2	crimsun	i followed the instructions you left with ubotu and it did not work.. are they the same commands i should be using..
2006-01-19T07:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential gcc-3.4 module-assistant
2006-01-19T07:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	then, dpkg -l alsa-source |grep ^ii
2006-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	Dave|id2	crimsun	ii  alsa-source    1.0.10+1.0.11rc2-2 ALSA driver sources
2006-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	good, then: sudo module-assistant a-i alsa-source
2006-01-19T07:21:00.000Z	Dave|id2	crimsun	That is done
2006-01-19T07:22:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	did it finish immediately, or did it actually compile stuff?
2006-01-19T07:22:00.000Z	Dave|id2	crimsun	took about 3 minutes....
2006-01-19T07:23:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	good, now reboot
2006-01-19T07:31:00.000Z	Dave|id2	crimsun	That's Fantastic.. Everything is now back to normal. Once again you have saved me!
2006-01-19T07:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	great.
2006-01-19T07:31:00.000Z	Dave|id2	crimsun	Hope the next Ubuntu release will have full support for the HDA Intel soundcards :)
2006-01-19T07:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Dave|id2	it will have as full support as reasonable
