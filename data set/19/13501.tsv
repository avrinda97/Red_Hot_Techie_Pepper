2005-03-26T08:58:00.000Z	olu		whats the easiest way converting ntfs to ext2/ext3?
2005-03-26T08:48:00.000Z	olu		/dev/hdb2 /mnt/hdb2 ext3 noauto,user,exec,rw,umask=000,uid=knoppix,gid=knoppix 0 0 ...... anyone know why that won't work?
2005-03-26T08:49:00.000Z	olu		anyone good with fstab _
2005-03-26T08:49:00.000Z	olu		?
2005-03-26T08:51:00.000Z	kotatsu	olu	do any of your lines in fstab say "ro"?
2005-03-26T08:52:00.000Z	olu	kotatsu	i have changed to rw on the ext3 disk yes
2005-03-26T08:52:00.000Z	kotatsu		have you remounted it since the change?
2005-03-26T08:52:00.000Z	olu		yes
2005-03-26T08:52:00.000Z	olu		with sudo mount -a
2005-03-26T08:52:00.000Z	olu		tried it many times
2005-03-26T08:53:00.000Z	kotatsu		try sudo mount -o remount (target dir)
2005-03-26T08:53:00.000Z	kotatsu		I don't know that mount -a remounts stuff, I think it just syncs your mtab to fstab
2005-03-26T08:53:00.000Z	olu		hmm
2005-03-26T08:54:00.000Z	olu		not mounted already or bad option
2005-03-26T08:54:00.000Z	kotatsu		does typing just "mount" report it as mounted?
2005-03-26T08:55:00.000Z	olu		/dev/hdb2 on /mnt/hdb2 type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev,user,umask=000,uid=1000,gid=1000)
2005-03-26T08:55:00.000Z	olu		thats what i get when i write mount
2005-03-26T08:56:00.000Z	kotatsu		certainly looks right to me... what are you trying to do that isn't working?
2005-03-26T08:56:00.000Z	kotatsu	olu	nosuid, nodev will restrict a few things but I can't imagine that's what you're having trouble with
