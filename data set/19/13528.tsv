2005-09-08T10:59:00.000Z	sproingie		sigh.  someone is trying to brute force me on ssh ... getting all kinds of inbound port22 activity from a single ip
2005-09-08T10:59:00.000Z	sproingie		is there a decent IDS tool i can use that will firewall attackers off automatically?
2005-09-08T10:59:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	get them back =)
2005-09-08T11:00:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	it's probably just a zombie. no point.  just looking for a tool i can use to put the shields up automaticall
2005-09-08T11:00:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	I don't know a program, but I think you can set up iptables to automatically do it after so many attempts
2005-09-08T11:00:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	i don't really know anything about iptables
2005-09-08T11:02:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	i'm looking for an IDS that will write those iptables deny rules when it catches an attack

2005-09-08T11:02:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	built right into the kernel =)
2005-09-08T11:03:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	nifty.  thanks
2005-09-08T11:03:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	is there any standard place to put iptables commands on startup?
2005-09-08T11:07:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	you make a new init.d script
2005-09-08T11:08:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	this is shown at http://www.aboutdebian.com/firewall.htm
2005-09-08T11:09:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	thanks again
2005-09-08T11:10:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	thank you.  I'm adding it to my server now =)
2005-10-04T08:28:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	did the maintainer forget to bump the version on a new version of a package?
2005-10-04T08:29:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	No, I want to request libtheora gets updated to version 1.0-alpha5 (we're at alpha4 and there are bug fixes)
2005-10-04T08:31:00.000Z	Rotund	sproingie	(I;m talking breezy too... obviously they won't update hoary)
2005-10-04T08:32:00.000Z	sproingie	Rotund	yah a RFE bug report might do it.  i dont know what the etiquette is on asking the maintainer directly, but a bug will hopefully keep everyone from making the same request
