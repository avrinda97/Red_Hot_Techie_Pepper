2011-04-25T04:48:00.000Z	Soothsayer		cool, i'll find it :)
2011-04-25T04:49:00.000Z	Soothsayer		I guess I'll need at least 5 hours to do all of this with setting up apache, php, mysql, etc.. got to make some free time I guess then
2011-04-25T04:50:00.000Z	Soothsayer		a lot.
2011-04-25T04:52:00.000Z	Soothsayer		by the way, this desktop has a Wireless network card ( D-Link Wireless DWA-510 ). Any idea if this would work out-of-the box with ubuntu 10.10?
2011-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	Soothsayer		libreoffice in my opinion.
2011-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	Soothsayer		Just moved to it 2 days ago.. and I believe Ubuntu 11 is going to replace openoffice with libreoffice.
2011-04-25T04:54:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	MariaDB is a fork of MySQL that is made by the original author
2011-04-25T04:54:00.000Z	Soothsayer	smw	ye, I'm reading it now.. hmm..
2011-04-25T04:55:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	the developer sold mysql for $1 Billion and then forked it when Oracle got it.
2011-04-25T04:56:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	no, he forked it when Oracle obtained it from Sun
2011-04-25T04:56:00.000Z	Soothsayer	smw	Wow.
2011-04-25T04:56:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	just like the OO.o people forked when sun was sold
2011-04-25T04:58:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	MySQL could go unmaintained for years or Oracle could make proprietary plugins or stop accepting new features from outsiders.
2011-04-25T04:58:00.000Z	Soothsayer	smw	ye, true. Especially MySQL is something that needs a lot of catching up and features to do.
2011-04-25T04:59:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	Jenkins (formerly hudson) also changed names with Oracle obtained it.
2011-04-25T04:59:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	all these projects fear Oracle for a reason ;-)
2011-04-25T04:59:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	it is the name of the developers other daughter...
2011-04-25T05:00:00.000Z	smw	Soothsayer	I would not say that to Monty's face ;-)
2011-04-25T05:00:00.000Z	Soothsayer	smw	hehe
