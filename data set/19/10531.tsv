2006-10-08T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	not in any meaningful way, no
2006-10-08T06:25:00.000Z	fluxinator	sethk	what could I do to this system to help lock it down further besides  running bastille
2006-10-08T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	use scp instead of rcp
2006-11-08T10:46:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	there is a way to set the password in such a way that you can't log in
2006-11-08T10:46:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	ubuntu does that for one of the install modes, but not for oem install
2006-11-08T10:47:00.000Z	fluxinator	sethk	I installed from live cd, and I see that root is enabled, and has its own unique password
2006-11-08T10:48:00.000Z	fluxinator	sethk	is there a reason why this is so?
2006-11-08T10:49:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	the idea that ubuntu doesn't have a root account is utter and complete nonsense.
2006-11-08T10:49:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	the amazing thing is that people keep repeating it, as if it were true
2006-11-08T10:49:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	the root account on ubuntu is exactly like the root account on every other linux and *nix system.
2006-11-08T10:50:00.000Z	fluxinator	sethk	why does root on my computer have its own password that I have not specified... thats the real point of asking
2006-11-08T10:50:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	there is an option for setting a password to a value that doesn't match any password you can enter
2006-11-08T10:50:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	it's a method for disabling login
2006-11-08T10:51:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	for the default install, it is used.  for other installs, such as the oem install, you are prompted for the root password
2006-11-08T10:51:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	you can change the root password to a reall one if you like.
2006-11-08T10:51:00.000Z	fluxinator	sethk	in other words, root login has been disabled
2006-11-08T10:52:00.000Z	sethk	fluxinator	right.  the account is normal, but the password has been set with passwd -l
