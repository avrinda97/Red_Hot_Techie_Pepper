2012-10-09T03:35:00.000Z	Gracenotes		flash video has gotten really messed up on both Firefox and Chrome, staggering and/or speeding up both video and audio. it's really disturbing. Any tips on making the pain go away?
2012-10-09T03:36:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	can you give the output of:   lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'

2012-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-installer   then enable the partner repo and install adobe-flashplugin
2012-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	ah. Okay, I'll try it from the source then...
2012-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	source? what do you mean?
2012-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	adobe flash is proprietary, there is no freely available source
2012-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	bad phrasing. in this case, the souce is adobe.
2012-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	the partner repo has what you need, it will install 64bit flash for your 64bit OS
2012-10-09T03:43:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	yeah, I'm afraid that doesn't make a difference
2012-10-09T03:43:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	have you tried chrome?
2012-10-09T03:44:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	it's even more messed up than FF. hm.
2012-10-09T03:45:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	it has flash built in if you install the deb from the google site :)
2012-10-09T03:45:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	isn't it worth exploring though?
2012-10-09T03:46:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	I mean, it's mssed up on Chrome too.
2012-10-09T03:47:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	I see, you weren't clear. Could download the 64bit flash plugin from the adobe site and put it into the browser's plugins folder
2012-10-09T03:47:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Gracenotes	I assume you closed all browsers and reopened it after installing the flash plugin
2012-10-09T03:48:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	wouldn't that be the same one as in the partner repository?
2012-10-09T03:52:00.000Z	Gracenotes	actionParsnip	ah. loading up videos in totem, I have the same problem
