2006-08-05T15:04:00.000Z	mc_________		is there something like digiKam for gnome?
2006-08-05T15:05:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	f-spot
2006-08-05T15:05:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	i guess it's somewhat similar (never used digikam)
2006-08-05T15:05:00.000Z	mc_________	topyli	is it good?
2006-08-05T15:05:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	it's way good :)

2006-08-05T15:21:00.000Z	mc_________	topyli	f-spot is great,thank you!
2006-08-05T15:22:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	good to hear it works for you. cheers
2006-08-05T15:25:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	inspired to try all of mono goodness? :)
2006-08-05T15:25:00.000Z	mc_________	topyli	well f-spot is great but i still dislike mono itself ;)
2006-08-05T15:26:00.000Z	mc_________	topyli	or i dislike .NET
2006-08-05T15:26:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	resistance is futile :)
2006-08-05T15:27:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	think about it: much of the neatest new gnome stuff is mono: tomboy, banshee, beagle, f-spot, muine...
2006-08-05T15:27:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	being related to microsoft doesn't necessarily kill a piece of free software :)
2006-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	mc_________	topyli	i have no problem with programs written in mono,i just do not want to code mono
2006-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	ahhh
2006-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	mc_________	topyli	well but maybe i should try it out before saying it sucks ^^
2006-08-05T15:30:00.000Z	topyli	mc_________	dunno, i've never tried it personally :)
