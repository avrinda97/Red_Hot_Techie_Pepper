2010-07-18T13:14:00.000Z	saji89	ubuntunewbie	Try reading the section 6 in it, that has examples.
2010-07-18T13:15:00.000Z	saji89	ubuntunewbie	Did u install ddrescue or gddrescue?
2010-07-18T13:16:00.000Z	saji89	ubuntunewbie	I think this link can help you more better- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery
2010-07-18T13:19:00.000Z	saji89	ubuntunewbie	The command for ddrescue in ubuntu is- dd_rescue . I think that's why you couldn't find it.
2010-07-18T13:28:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	saji89	I install both gddrescue and dd_rescue
