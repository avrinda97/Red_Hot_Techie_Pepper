2006-10-29T14:22:00.000Z	riddlebox		anyone else having problems with nvidia drivers + ubuntu?
2006-10-29T14:22:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	such a general question.  i am.
2006-10-29T14:23:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	the nvidia drivers are locking up my system shortly after I boot
2006-10-29T14:23:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	have you followed configuration instructions in the nvidia readme and probably on the ubuntu forum and wiki?
2006-10-29T14:24:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	you have to remove "load dri" and "load gl<something>" and add "load glx" ... that stuff?  in xorg.conf?
2006-10-29T14:24:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	I did do that
2006-10-29T14:25:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	is this just w/edgy or when did problem start?
2006-10-29T14:25:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	the problem started in dapper so I upgraded to edgy hoping that would do it, but in edgy the same thing happened
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	does it happen every time?
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	yes like withing 5-10 minutes of booting
2006-10-29T14:28:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	?
2006-10-29T14:28:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	"so it actually starts X and you can log in, but then it freezes?"
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	yup
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	are you sure it's the drivers?  have you looked at /var/log/Xorg*?
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	I even tried the beta drivers from nvidia but I cannot get x to start with it
2006-10-29T14:30:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	if I set my xorg.conf to nv or vesa it will work fine, as soon I set it to nvidia I get a lock up
2006-10-29T14:31:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	Hmm...  I'm not sure.  I'd check the logs, I guess.  Try changing settings in xorg.conf.  I just upgraded to Edgy myself, and X didn't start... so......  :)
2006-10-29T14:41:00.000Z	riddlebox	izm99	is there a place to get the newest deb files for nvidia drivers?
2006-10-29T14:42:00.000Z	izm99	riddlebox	not sure.  I just use the ones in apt.  apt-get install nvidia-glx
