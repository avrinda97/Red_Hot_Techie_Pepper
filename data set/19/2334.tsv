2012-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	zteam		Anybody know how to solve sound issues with VLC?
2012-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	zteam		For some odd reason VLC, forgets to play the sound in my movies I puase them
2012-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	as in using vlc as a kde sound backend?
2012-11-06T03:12:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	nope
2012-11-06T03:12:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	'forgets' /???? explain that
2012-11-06T03:12:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	just pure VLC on Unity / gnome
2012-11-06T03:13:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	it does play the sound perfectly, as long as I not pause the video
2012-11-06T03:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	pausing a stream from where?
2012-11-06T03:14:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	not a stream just a regular video file on my harddrive
2012-11-06T03:15:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	does the issue also exist when you 'totem' player?
2012-11-06T03:15:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	seems to be a confirmed bug in VLC too
2012-11-06T03:16:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	nope, it works just fine in totem
2012-11-06T03:16:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	oh, try another player, assuming the point is to see the vid
2012-11-06T03:17:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	well, the thing is that Totem is a kind of broken player itself
2012-11-06T03:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	alrighty then
2012-11-06T03:20:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	I don't wanna sound ungreatfull but I really like VLC otherwise
2012-11-06T03:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	zteam	that's nice
2012-11-06T03:21:00.000Z	zteam	almoxarife	:-)
