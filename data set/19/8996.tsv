2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	does MSN support offline messages at all?
2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	msn now support it
2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	if anything supports it, it will be aMSN... it's a pretty good copy of MSN imho....
2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	oh cool, I didn't know that!
2007-01-08T09:42:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	okay and for yahoo
2007-01-08T09:42:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	except gaim
2007-01-08T09:42:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	wait, I'm pretty sure I tried offline messages with aMSN in the last day or so, and I don't think they worked. Got "cannot be delivered" message.
2007-01-08T09:42:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	in xp messnger the newest one support it
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	for gnome, I'm not much help sorry. I'm using kopete in KDE (mind you, I think with a bit of tweaking) (or maybe with no tweaking at all!) you can run KDE apps on gnome in ubuntu, 'cos all the libs are there and/or can be added
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	i was using msn live for xp
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	okay i will see
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	mena	geoffb	thanks
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	with OSS, sometimes patience is necessary for new features... a couple of months and someone will implement offline messaging on the clone clients!
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	geoffb	mena	you're welcome :-)
