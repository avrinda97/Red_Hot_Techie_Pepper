2005-12-18T09:59:00.000Z	drew		anyone have experience with twinview?
2005-12-18T09:59:00.000Z	tritium	drew	yes
2005-12-18T09:59:00.000Z	tritium	drew	did you read /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx/README ?
2006-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	drew	tritium	didn't you ban 'tuesday' for that yesterday?
2006-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	tritium	drew	no, for other reasons
2006-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	tritium	drew	you didn't even see the rude remarks
2006-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	drew	tritium	but I did watch my friend log onto the computer and talk to you, and I did see you ban him before his remarks reached anything near a 'rude' level.
2006-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	tritium	drew	and the remarks you _did_ see came before the ban
2006-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	tritium	drew	then refresh your memory
2006-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	tritium	drew	your friend went far beyond simply "rude" on the inappropriate scale
2006-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	drew	tritium	no offence, but I personally think your actions were quite naziish myself.
2006-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	tritium	drew	don't even start that.  Do you have any idea what it means to call someone a Nazi?  Stop it this very moment.
2006-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	tritium	drew	consider that a first warning
2006-07-27T06:21:00.000Z	drew	tritium	I've already dropped the conversation, and preceded my comment with 'no offence'. Calm down please.
2006-07-27T06:22:00.000Z	drew	tritium	Please drop it before you feel the need to ban me as well.
2006-07-27T06:23:00.000Z	tritium	drew	2nd warning.  Drop it entirely now.
2006-07-27T06:23:00.000Z	drew	tritium	what are you talking about? I'm done. Please stop highlighting to me.
2006-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	tritium	drew	I'm talking about your smart-ass comments
2006-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	drew	tritium	I'm not making any. Please stop highlighting me, it's quite obvious you're tyring to extend this into a ban as you did before.
