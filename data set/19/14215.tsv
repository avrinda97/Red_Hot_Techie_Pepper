2005-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	insert a blank CD
2005-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	it's also under 'places'
2005-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	thx
2005-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	will that work to burn dvds?
2005-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	yes
2005-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	assuming you just want DVDs with files on them
2005-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	for the most part yes...
2005-02-03T11:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	I think it was being redone
2005-02-03T12:00:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	meaning that could be a reason the notification thing is not in the rightclick add to panel thing?
2005-02-03T12:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	yes
2005-02-03T12:00:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	ok cool
2005-02-08T07:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	yes
2005-02-08T07:09:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	than is there a difference between debian-amd64 and debian-pure64 ?
2005-02-08T07:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	I'm not 100% sure
2005-02-08T07:17:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	do you think that running 32 as wells as 64 bit slow down the system some?
2005-02-08T07:17:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	swim	not really but it's a pain in the butt to maintain
2005-02-08T07:18:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	why isnt there a pure 64 ubuntu? do you think there will be eventually?
2005-02-08T07:20:00.000Z	swim	HrdwrBoB	it's not pure64 ?
