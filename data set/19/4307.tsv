2009-04-08T13:24:00.000Z	mimiloon		i have a small problem with my wifi card; it works but not to it's full potential. it's atheros N series (AR5008 (AR5416)). it doesn't use the N protocol in ubuntu 8.1, any thought of getting this to improve? i have the drivers from windows but when i try to use the ndiswrapper, i'm unable to get it working
2009-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	describe what yo mean by 'unable to get it working'
2009-04-08T13:33:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	sorry about the delay; i typed this: ndiswrapper -i [the .inf file, then sudo modprobe ndiswrapper, then sudo ndiswrapper -l, but i don't know what to do after
2009-04-08T13:34:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	generally, you want to remove the module that your card is currently using first. "lsmod -v" will show you that
2009-04-08T13:34:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	also, modprobe -l shows you the currently installed ndiswrapper cards, so doing that after modprobing is sort of pointless
2009-04-08T13:34:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	finally, you need to do "sudo ndiswrapper -a" before modprobing... i think
2009-04-08T13:37:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	oops, i meant "sudo ndiswrapper -m"
2009-04-08T13:38:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	how to i remove it, if the current module is ath9k
2009-04-08T13:38:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	for now, "sudo invoke-rc.d networking stop", "sudo modprobe -r ath9k"
2009-04-08T13:39:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	in the long term, add it to the blacklist file in /etc/modprobe.d
2009-04-08T13:39:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	also, is french your native language?
2009-04-08T13:40:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	english, why you ask?
2009-04-08T13:40:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	from your hostname; nevermind.
2009-04-08T13:40:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	oh ok
2009-04-08T13:41:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	thanks for your help, i'll try the instructions you've given me and get back to u
2009-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	i forgot to mention: i have 2 wifi cards hooked up to the computer; one is built in (abg) and the other is pmcia card (N); i was able to remove the ath9k driver from the pcmcia card but the built-in card it still active (wlan0). when i type the command 'sudo ndiswrapper, it wrote info about wlan0
2009-04-08T14:12:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	pcmcia... i haven't heard that in a looong time
2009-04-08T14:13:00.000Z	raylu	mimiloon	anyway, you might want to ask someone for help; i'm going to leave soon
2009-04-08T14:13:00.000Z	mimiloon	raylu	thanks for your help
