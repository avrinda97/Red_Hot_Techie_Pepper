2007-09-01T05:07:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	been ther done that - young person I'm helping - patience
2007-09-01T05:07:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	no problem, just getting crazy bout this..
2007-11-02T13:07:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	what happens with the live cd is a good indication - have you tried it?
2007-11-02T13:09:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	but i dont know whats different, why are the scsi devices found in a pre-installed environment, but on a step-by-step installed, personal system, they are not found?
2007-11-02T13:09:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	then it should be fine - the live cd is a good indicator - that's why it is made
2007-11-02T13:09:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	aaah now i know what you mean. it works correctly with knoppix based live cds, ist does NOT work with the xubuntu disc
2007-11-02T13:10:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	sorry - did you install it to hd and have trouble?
2007-11-02T13:10:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	yep. using DamnSmall or knoppix - no problems. using the xubuntu live system - scsi not found. installing xubuntu do hd - still not found
2007-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	the question - which xubuntu pls?
2007-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	7.10
2007-11-02T13:12:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	7.10 is ahead of most - what is the hardware pls?
2007-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	seems t be an old athlon, nothing special. 650 mhz, 320 mb ram
2007-11-02T13:14:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	I run xubuntu feisty on amd 500mhz ok
2007-11-02T13:14:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	with scsi?
2007-11-02T13:15:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	it recognizes ide as scsi - maybe there is an issue...
2007-11-02T13:18:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	does the pc u use have scsi? everything else works well for me too, though
2007-11-02T13:20:00.000Z	warbler	damaltor	nope - nothing for that omp is scsi - there were questions earlier why the OS sees ide as scsi - no resolution though...
2007-11-02T13:20:00.000Z	damaltor	warbler	thats bad. but thank you though
