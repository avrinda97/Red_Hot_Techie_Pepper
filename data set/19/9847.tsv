2006-09-05T10:38:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		apparently I have the drivers installed correctly, because I found a crappy CRT, plugged it into my laptop, and now I can see this
2006-09-05T10:38:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		can run glxgears and all that, but my laptop lcd is just black
2006-09-05T10:38:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		unless I kill xwindows, then I see the login fine
2006-09-05T10:40:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		has anyone read into my problem?
2006-09-05T10:40:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		i can provide log files
2006-09-05T10:42:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		no, those are the ones I have
2006-09-05T10:42:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		I'm new to ubuntu, kinda new to linux
2006-09-05T10:43:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		desperately trying to escape from winxp, not having much luck :-/
2006-09-05T10:43:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy		and I've tried with getting drivers from aptget/synaptic and nvidia.com
2006-09-05T10:44:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	nvidia 3d is really easy in ubuntu, but i didn't read you first comment. So waht's the trouble?
2006-09-05T10:45:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	what resolution is the LCD?
2006-09-05T10:46:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	you have a 30" studio-display or what?
2006-09-05T10:47:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	so let's assume 1280x1024 native reso
2006-09-05T10:47:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	are you on linux now ?
2006-09-05T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	so give these commands: 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-09-05T10:56:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	your LCD runs at 60 Hz, as all the LCDs do
2006-09-05T10:57:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	so set your reso to 1280x1024 at 60 Hz... chances are you get a picture then
2006-09-05T11:01:00.000Z	CreativeEmbassy	stefg	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22639
2006-09-05T11:03:00.000Z	stefg	CreativeEmbassy	your xorg conf looks a bit... sparse. I think the driver is waiting for DPMI info he'll never gets. Change to a console (ctrl-alt-F1), sudo killall gdm and dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
