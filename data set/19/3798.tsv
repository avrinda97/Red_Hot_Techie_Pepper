2009-05-26T02:05:00.000Z	tolun		Does anyone knows anything about encryption systems ?
2009-05-26T02:05:00.000Z	Hillshum	tolun	try truecrypt

2009-05-26T02:07:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	I have installed it and I used it. But I thing that It is not enough for my needs...
2009-05-26T02:08:00.000Z	Hillshum	tolun	I think that's one of the most robust around

2009-05-26T02:13:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	My needs is like that "I need to encrypt my USB which is carry now very important files. I want to use my USB on Tux and on micros~1. But I don't want to enter any pass phare. It should work fine with this USB files are copied to outside then they should not work" may it is in TrueCrypt but I don't know how can I do it.
2009-05-26T02:14:00.000Z	Hillshum	tolun	if you don't need to enter a passphrase then the whole setup isn't to secure as anyone could get to the files
2009-05-26T02:16:00.000Z	Hillshum		Venom: yes, but why?
2009-05-26T02:18:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	Yes I know that but it is very usefull. I saw one USB which has like this encryption. You are not entering any password for login and also you don't need to install any program/tool. I understand that it has another hidden partion for entering password but it is working automatically.
2009-05-26T02:18:00.000Z	Hillshum	tolun	but then anyone else could get the password from that partition
2009-05-26T02:21:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	Maybe, But it is not so easy. Did you hear anything like this type of encryption? or do you know any tools which is works like that?
2009-05-26T02:21:00.000Z	Hillshum	tolun	no, i don't know of anything more
2009-05-26T02:23:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	I understand that it encrypts partion which has important files. If something tries to reach them then it is inputs password from second hidden partion.
2009-05-26T02:24:00.000Z	Hillshum		but what's to keep it from only doing that for you?
2009-05-26T02:24:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	this system work automatically and you don't need to enter anything or need any external tool(s)
2009-05-26T02:25:00.000Z	tolun		Does anyone knows hidden partion encryption ?
2009-05-26T02:25:00.000Z	Hillshum	tolun	but then it won't know when to let folks get at the data and when not?
2009-05-26T02:27:00.000Z	tolun	Hillshum	Yes you have right. It is really too much interresting.  If you try to open files they are working fine but if you try to copy it then files copied to outside as encrypted.
