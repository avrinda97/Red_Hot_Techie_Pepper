2011-03-23T04:52:00.000Z	Neroon		anyone here could got some tips regarding a new wlan router (winxp works, ubuntu doesnt)?
2011-03-23T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	the router is moot
2011-03-23T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	its the wifi adapter you need to worry about
2011-03-23T04:53:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	All i can you is, the thing worked with the old router
2011-03-23T04:53:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	+tell
2011-03-23T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	then you need to associate with the new. Routers use strong standards set by the ISO foundation. If it doesn't then it isn't a router
2011-03-23T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	maybe you need to configure the router some
2011-03-23T04:56:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	The prob is with 2 Ubuntu Laptops (one kde, one xfce)
2011-03-23T04:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	can you access the config page like fishscene asked? Can you ping the internal IP? Can you connect to the SSID? Can you ping 8.8.8.8? Can you ping wwww.bbc.co.uk?
2011-03-23T04:58:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	i cant right now. I'll have a shot at it tomorrow again. But i doubt pinging works, since it doesn't even connect to the router (both laptops)
2011-03-23T04:58:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	Just looking for some new ideas, since I'm out of it ....
2011-03-23T05:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	try those tests, see how you go
2011-03-23T05:02:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	only thing i really found strange, was one of the laptops (xfce) kept asking the pwd for the router. And yes, I had the right pwd and it was the matching router
2011-03-23T05:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neroon	are there any restrictions in place in the router (mac filters and such)
2011-03-23T05:04:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	I thought about that as well, but then it wouldn't have worked on one of the laptops (booting into xp)
2011-03-23T05:05:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	It didn't even change anything, whether i tried fixed ip, nor dhcp.
2011-03-23T05:06:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	And one kept asking the pwd on and on (and i entered the same as in xp)
2011-03-23T05:15:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	Thanks for trying to hel√º
2011-03-23T05:15:00.000Z	Neroon	ActionParsnip	help :-)
