2006-12-08T13:09:00.000Z	paguilera		Hi vonguard.
2006-12-08T13:10:00.000Z	paguilera		Any ideas as to what I can do to see what's causing firefox to segfault each time I try to start it?
2006-12-08T13:11:00.000Z	noiesmo	paguilera	did it start after you add a new plugin or flash ??
2006-12-08T13:11:00.000Z	paguilera		I had tried adding Java plugin earlier this evening, but when it didn't work, I used synaptic to uninstall.
2006-12-08T13:12:00.000Z	paguilera		and it had seemed to be working ok.
2006-12-08T13:12:00.000Z	paguilera		But just a few minutes ago, it crashed as I was browsing multiple sites.
2006-12-08T13:13:00.000Z	noiesmo	paguilera	not sure then sorry have had firefox crash aftr adding extensions or plugin's and removing them has fix the issue
2006-12-08T13:13:00.000Z	paguilera	noiesmo	It actually took me a couple tries to get Java out.  I'm wondering if maybe I didn't get it all the way removed.
2006-12-08T13:14:00.000Z	paguilera		links is in synaptic
2006-12-08T13:16:00.000Z	noiesmo	paguilera	you could always move your ~/.mozilla directory then when you start firefox it will be recreated if firefox works ok then a file in your profiles .mozilla folder is causeing the problem
2006-12-08T13:17:00.000Z	paguilera	noiesmo	Ahh... I didn't think of that.  Thanks.  Trying it now.
2006-12-08T13:17:00.000Z	noiesmo	paguilera	if it makes no diff move it back
2006-12-08T13:19:00.000Z	paguilera	noiesmo	I tried that.  No dice.  Still a segfault with core dump.
2006-12-08T13:25:00.000Z	paguilera		I believe it's listed under Sun in the S section instead of by itself.
2006-12-08T13:26:00.000Z	noiesmo	paguilera	is firefox installed thru synaptic
2006-12-08T13:26:00.000Z	paguilera	noiesmo	Should be.  It's from the basic install.
2006-12-08T13:26:00.000Z	paguilera	noiesmo	I'll double check now, though.
2006-12-08T13:27:00.000Z	noiesmo	paguilera	you could try sudo apt-get remove --purge mozilla-firefox && sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox that will cause it to be removed and all config files should be purged then it will be reinstalled
