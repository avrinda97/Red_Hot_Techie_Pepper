2012-05-04T20:32:00.000Z	Daghdha		I th ink i found solution but not sure what it means "Rather than change my kernel and risk screwing something up, I looked at the available packages relating to linux-generic-pae and found the relevant linux-headers package was not installed. Installing this -- then reinstalling virtualbox-ose-dkms -- fixed the issue."
2012-05-04T20:34:00.000Z	Daghdha		worked fine till 2 hours ago though :/
2012-05-04T20:34:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	odd, did it change after an update?
2012-05-04T20:35:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	I don't "think" so. Stranger things have happened though.
2012-05-04T20:37:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	hmm, I can't say I've ever seen that. Maybe I should browse the logs on my server.
2012-05-04T20:38:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	Maybe I misunderstood earlier. You installed the headers, reinstalled VBox fix it already no?
2012-05-04T20:38:00.000Z	Daghdha	wylde_	No it is not fixed and no i did not install headers
2012-05-04T20:41:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	ahh ok. Installing the headers for your current kernel should do the trick. Rather than re-install VBox I believe 'dpkg-reconfigure <package>' will rebuild the dkms using the new headers. I'll fire up my thin client here and check on my server box.
2012-05-04T20:44:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	how did you install virtualbox?
2012-05-04T20:45:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	hmm, so running 'sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup' doesn't do anything? Just complains that it isn't there?
2012-05-04T20:49:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	hmm.. that isn't related to kernel headers, any chance virtualbox-dkms or somesuch got removed?

2012-05-04T20:56:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	basically it's telling you to add vboxdrv to /etc/modules
2012-05-04T20:56:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	but don't use sudo to satrt gedit, use gksu gedit :)
2012-05-04T21:03:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	bugger :(
2012-05-04T21:06:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	Does this situation match the issues you're having?

2012-05-04T21:11:00.000Z	Daghdha	wylde_	I am trying that now
2012-05-04T21:11:00.000Z	wylde_	Daghdha	alrighty. From what you told me that sounds like a good potential solution.
