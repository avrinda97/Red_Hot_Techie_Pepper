2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	Daviey		Hi, XDMCP only works when connecting to localhost.  Any ideas why?
2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	xhost +
2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	?
2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	you cant connect from outside?
2006-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	make sure you allow remote connections
2006-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	is enabled
2006-11-25T07:02:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	Also, if i try to connect using my localhosts IP address (ie 10.0.0.x) then i get the same result.  On works using 'localhost'
2006-11-25T07:02:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	so seems like port blocking issue
2006-11-25T07:02:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	iptables or config is setting it to block
2006-11-25T07:02:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	i checked with firestarter
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	type xhost +
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	plus i tried it on another machine (clean instalL)
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	what does that do?
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	allows any addrss to connect
2006-11-25T07:04:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	brb
2006-11-25T07:06:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	naa, still didn't work
2006-11-25T07:06:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	what is the error?
2006-11-25T07:06:00.000Z	khermans_	Daviey	run a trace with wireshark
2006-11-25T07:07:00.000Z	Daviey	khermans_	i will do that, but i think it's a job for tommorow
