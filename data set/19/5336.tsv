2008-07-20T08:20:00.000Z	JFCake		Hello there
2008-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	JFCake		I'm having a problem with Wubi on Windows Vista SP1
2008-07-20T08:22:00.000Z	JFCake		I've downloaded the lastest Wubi installer, both Desktop and Alternate ISO's for Ubuntu 8.04.1 and placed them in the same folder as wubi.exe
2008-07-20T08:22:00.000Z	JFCake		and still it downloads the file
2008-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	JFCake		Can anyone help me with my problem?
2008-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	JFCake		And (for some reason I feel like saying OFCOURSE) when I burned the desktop iso as Live CD wubi didn't work
2008-07-20T08:24:00.000Z	JFCake		Anyone?
2008-07-20T08:24:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	I am looking into it for you
2008-07-20T08:25:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	Ok what is the problem you are experiencing?
2008-07-20T08:26:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	Ok hang on I shall have a quick read of the README for wubi
2008-07-20T08:28:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	Ok have you tried turning off your internet before you run wubi?
2008-07-20T08:29:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	It seems  as though wubi will look for an internet connection first and if it can't find one it defaults to a iso install
2008-07-20T08:29:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	another thing, you did put the .iso file in the same folder as wubi?
2008-07-20T08:31:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	righto... just a sec see if I can find you some more info
2008-07-20T08:31:00.000Z	JFCake	mechdave	I'll try and report back
2008-07-20T08:31:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	LOL, righto
2008-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	JFCake	mechdave	amigo
2008-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	How did you go?
2008-07-20T08:53:00.000Z	mechdave	JFCake	I am glad to hear that, I read after you left that it would only work with a cd image and not a dvd image
