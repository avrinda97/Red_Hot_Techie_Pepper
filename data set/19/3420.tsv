2010-02-27T09:15:00.000Z	alankila		morph: you just restroyed the patch file, needs < to read from it
2010-02-27T09:15:00.000Z	alankila		destroyed even
2010-02-27T09:16:00.000Z	alankila		never mind. I just think you typoed the command here. Anyway, the errors you got from patch indicate that the patch is not compatible with the source version, I guess.
2010-02-27T09:17:00.000Z	morph_	alankila	this is what im trying to do: http://github.com/entrope/linux-magicmouse/blob/master/INSTALL
2010-02-27T09:19:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	well, I'm kinda busy cooking here... But I can only say that this particular patch did not identify the requisite source lines in the source and that is why applying the modifications failed. Perhaps you could download 2.6.33 kernel from ppa, in case it has the hooks?
2010-02-27T09:24:00.000Z	morph_	alankila	which one of these do i download: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2010-02-27T09:24:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	not so fast. You should first try to identify if 2.6.33 contains the stuff you want first. Otherwise, there's no point necessarily to update to it.
2010-02-27T09:27:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	well, there are some kernel images offered by mac users who apparently have this stuff working, but if you can just wait, the problem will resolve itself.
2010-02-27T09:30:00.000Z	morph_	alankila	can i PM u
2010-02-27T09:31:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	why not.
2010-02-27T11:41:00.000Z	morph_	alankila	what do u think
2010-02-27T11:42:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	no chance.
2010-02-27T11:43:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	maybe for 10.04. Don't know.
2010-02-27T11:44:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	well, they have generally preferred late dates to early ones. There's a whole schedule, supposedly, somewhere.
2010-02-27T11:45:00.000Z	morph_	alankila	can we make suggestions/requests somewher
2010-02-27T11:45:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	launchpad, but I read there's already bug open about it
2010-02-27T11:46:00.000Z	alankila	morph_	07:48 < al_> ardchoille: actually the 1,2,3,4,5,6 is in the dow colum? so they
2010-02-27T11:47:00.000Z	morph_	alankila	what am i supposed to do there
