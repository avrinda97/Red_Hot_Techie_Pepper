2005-07-18T14:17:00.000Z	Tarcastil		hey, what commands are called when someone uses sound? I'm tightening restrcitions on a user in visudo, but because of it, sound doesn't work
2005-07-18T14:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	none
2005-07-18T14:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	only /dev/dsp is opened
2005-07-18T14:17:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	ack, maybe it's something else, but sound works fine under root
2005-07-18T14:18:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	but not as a user
2005-07-18T14:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	root can do anything :)
2005-07-18T14:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	the user has to be in the audio group
2005-07-18T14:18:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	thanks
2005-07-18T14:20:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	ah, I didn't realize usermod -G took the user out of groups I didn't specify. Thanks :)
2005-07-18T14:22:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	hmm, sound still isn't working as user
2005-07-18T14:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	what does lsof | grep /dev/dsp say?
2005-07-18T14:23:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	no output
2005-07-18T14:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	ah, probably your program needs esd, which is not started
2005-07-18T14:24:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	I took out esd because it was messing stuff up
2005-07-18T14:24:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	sound just stopped working for some reason
2005-07-18T14:24:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	it was working before without esd
2005-07-18T14:24:00.000Z	Seveas	Tarcastil	check the programs settings
2005-07-18T14:25:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	the program was working before as a user without esd. I don't know why it's not working now
2005-07-18T14:55:00.000Z	Tarcastil	Seveas	just wanted to let you know I got it working now. Thanks again
