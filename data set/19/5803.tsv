2008-05-12T08:44:00.000Z	babolat		Does Wubi still require downloads when used from the LiveCD?
2008-05-12T08:44:00.000Z	fde	babolat	Wubi won't work from the LiveCD
2008-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	fde	babolat	I've been told it's not on the LiveCD... I'd imagine it wouldn't require any downloading on the LiveCD though, no... considering everything it needs is on the CD...
2008-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	fde	babolat	Yes it is
2008-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	babolat	fde	i thought you still needed ntfs-3g?
2008-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	fde	babolat	That is native.
2008-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	babolat	fde	wrong term.. _out_of_the_box_ might suit your diction better? ;)
2008-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	fde	babolat	It just uses fuse... so it doesn't crash the kernel, or need to be approved by the kernel guys
2008-05-12T08:48:00.000Z	fde	babolat	It's installed by default last I checked too
2008-05-12T08:48:00.000Z	babolat	fde	last i tried it wasnt
2008-05-12T08:48:00.000Z	fde	babolat	It is in hardy...
2008-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	babolat	fde	you need to apt-get install it dont you? or from Synaptic
2008-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	fde	babolat	no
2008-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	babolat	fde	yes
2008-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	fde	babolat	I never installed it, and it's installed here.
2008-05-12T08:50:00.000Z	fde	babolat	ubuntu-standard depends it.
