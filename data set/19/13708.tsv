2005-04-09T13:03:00.000Z	Zevin		wtf, why is it so fucking hard to install winetools?
2005-04-09T13:03:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	*laughs*
2005-04-09T13:05:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	apt-get install winetools?
2005-04-09T13:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	try it
2005-04-09T13:07:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	ok, there is only a wine-utils in the repositories... not sure how that compares to winetools
2005-04-09T13:14:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	what are you using?
2005-04-09T13:16:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	is there no repository for this program you want?
2005-04-09T13:16:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	that's what i used the command line tools, easier : )
2005-04-09T13:16:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	apt-get install libglib-1.2
2005-04-09T13:17:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	though if you're building you'll probably need the -dev packages as well
2005-04-09T13:20:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	?
2005-04-09T13:21:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	did youw ant to ask in channel, i suually don't do pm
2005-04-09T13:21:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	in channel the posibility of helping others always exists
2005-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	well, what was it?
2005-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	you can't have any other programs open that use the packages database...
2005-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	ie, you should close your synaptic... and you'll have to run that as root... so sudo it
2005-04-09T13:25:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	no, you don't... have you uncommented our universe?
2005-04-09T13:25:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Zevin	in /etc/apt/sources.list
