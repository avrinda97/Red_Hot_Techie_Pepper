2006-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	roico		whn i use free -m, it tells me i have no swap, although i have "/dev/hda3       none            swap    sw              0       0" on my fstab
2006-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	swapon -s   gives....?
2006-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	nothing...
2006-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	cool - so you actually have no swap - maybe you'd like to configure some...
2006-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	i have a partition formated as swap, and the ""/dev/hda3       none            swap    sw              0       0", what else should i do?
2006-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	you DEAD sure there's no useful data on /dev/hda3  ???
2006-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	yep...
2006-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	ok, at your peril, we'll make the swapfs   -  'sudo mkswap /dev/hda3'
2006-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	no label, UUID=c7d5975e-28c1-42f9-91e2-2a79bca52fab
2006-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	and still no swap...
2006-06-08T11:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	now 'sudo swapon /dev/hda3 ;  swapon -s'
2006-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	ok, the swap is on now... but is it gonna be on when i restart too?
2006-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	the fstab looks good, so 99% likely yes
2006-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	than why did it happen? anyway, ill restart in some minutes and will let u know if happens again...
2006-06-08T11:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	you didn't have the swapfs on the partition
2006-06-08T11:09:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	what do u mean? when i installed ubuntu i checked that partition as swap, what did i do wrong?
2006-06-08T11:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	roico	mkswap is a way of 'formatting' a partition so the swapfs driver can use it
2006-06-08T11:13:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	ok thanks... ill restart now and ill see what will happen...
2006-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	roico	Frogzoo	k thanks. it worked. thank u very much... :)
