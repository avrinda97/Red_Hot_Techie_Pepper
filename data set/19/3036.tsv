2009-11-05T22:49:00.000Z	insm0d	pixie_	the disc you are trying to mount, is it a dvd?, what does linux call your cd drive
2009-11-05T22:50:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	it doesnt call it anything,i can√§t seem to mount it.
2009-11-05T22:50:00.000Z	insm0d		do you know what kind of hardware interface your cd drive uses pixie_?
2009-11-05T22:50:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	no,sorry.
2009-11-05T22:51:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	i know that it's not a hardware issues though,reinstalled distro from cd a couple weeks back
2009-11-05T22:51:00.000Z	insm0d		okay pixie_ open up a console and type this: dmesg | grep CD Then tell us the output
2009-11-05T22:52:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	no return output
2009-11-05T22:54:00.000Z	insm0d		yikes pixie_, you're kernel isn't finding your cd drive.  You aren't going to be able to do anything until it gets detected.
2009-11-05T22:54:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	so how can i go about getting it to detect?
2009-11-05T22:54:00.000Z	insm0d		try finding out what type of cd drive you have and then we can help your kernel detect it pixie_
2009-11-05T22:55:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	i'm really not a hacker. i'll just have to rad more howtos then. on how to find out what cd drive i use
2009-11-05T22:56:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	thanks for the help anyways,i might be back later
2009-11-05T22:57:00.000Z	insm0d		hold on pixie_
2009-11-05T22:57:00.000Z	insm0d		we might be able to find out from here.  Is your drive internal or external?
2009-11-05T22:58:00.000Z	pixie_	insm0d	internal
2009-11-05T22:58:00.000Z	insm0d	pixie_	what kind of computer is it?  Laptop, desktop...
