2010-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	lucenut		I am interested in a way to run Ubuntu at the same time as my windows.
2010-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	lucenut		I have development environments running on my windows that I can't turn off. But I tried running Ubuntu in a VM using Virtualbox and it would only go to like 1024 pixels.
2010-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	lucenut		Are other virtual environments better? I was hoping to just run it fullscreen and be able to almost forget about the windows running.
2010-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	lucenut		Ubottu if I dual boot I am not running them side by side.
2010-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	unop	lucenut	if you install the virtualbox guest additions/extensions in windows - you'll get full resolution amongst other things
2010-06-08T20:27:00.000Z	lucenut		Yeah, but 800x600 was the largest in Windowsbox.
2010-06-08T20:27:00.000Z	lucenut		My buddy installed something in ubuntu that made it go to 1024 I think.
2010-06-08T20:27:00.000Z	unop	lucenut	actually, otherway around - install the VB extensions in ubuntu
2010-06-08T20:28:00.000Z	lucenut		VB extensions? What are those for?
2010-06-08T20:28:00.000Z	unop		!who | lucenut
2010-06-08T20:29:00.000Z	unop	lucenut	the extensions are needed to give you full resolution (and other things like sound, networking, etc)
2010-06-08T20:29:00.000Z	lucenut		Ubuntu extensions?
2010-06-08T20:30:00.000Z	unop	lucenut	no, they're called "VirtualBox Guest Additions" - part of virtualbox itself, they need to be installed in ubuntu
2010-06-08T20:31:00.000Z	lucenut		Ah, thanks.
2010-06-08T20:31:00.000Z	lucenut		So VB should be able to run fullscreen at 1900 pixels?
2010-06-08T20:31:00.000Z	unop	lucenut	yes
2010-06-08T20:32:00.000Z	lucenut		K, lemme try it.
2010-06-08T20:33:00.000Z	lucenut	Slart	I have never played a computer game. :-)
2010-06-08T20:33:00.000Z	unop	lucenut	in the VB menu, Devices -> Install Guest Additions -- see http://linuxandfriends.com/2009/02/12/installing-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-ubuntu-linux/
