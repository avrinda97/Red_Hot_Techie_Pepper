2009-01-17T23:06:00.000Z	thadthudpucker	gogoodguy	you need 2 parts on the HDD, one for ext3 about 85% total and the other swap, about 15% total
2009-01-17T23:07:00.000Z	thadthudpucker	gogoodguy	I'd say just use a different HDD
2009-01-17T23:08:00.000Z	thadthudpucker	gogoodguy	that way you can leave you XP for "just in case"

2009-01-17T23:08:00.000Z	thadthudpucker	gogoodguy	what is the size of the HDD?
2009-01-17T23:17:00.000Z	thadthudpucker	gogoodguy	the best way i know of offhand is the partition manager in the ubuntu setup :)
2009-01-17T23:18:00.000Z	thadthudpucker	gogoodguy	:) you left before i could!
