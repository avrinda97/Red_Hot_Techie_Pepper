2010-01-08T01:49:00.000Z	hey_man		does Ubuntu have a policy on responsible disclosure?
2010-01-08T01:50:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	how do you mean, if its ubuntu specific best to contact the maintainer directly or go upstream with a report?
2010-01-08T01:50:00.000Z	hey_man		well...
2010-01-08T01:50:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	there is also a ubuntu security team
2010-01-08T01:50:00.000Z	hey_man		I mean, is it Ubuntu policy to disclose before publishing?
2010-01-08T01:51:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	you mean like forward notification of planned patches?
2010-01-08T01:52:00.000Z	hey_man		well, I mean, do you guys suggest recommended security practices of contacting the vendor first and waiting for a fix before publishing a vulnerability report
2010-01-08T01:52:00.000Z	hey_man		sorry for not b eing clear
2010-01-08T01:53:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	that typically is the nice way to disclose
2010-01-08T01:53:00.000Z	hey_man		okay
2010-01-08T01:53:00.000Z	hey_man		I just noticed one of your security team members not following that, and I was confused
2010-01-08T01:54:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	example ?
2010-01-08T01:54:00.000Z	hey_man		I don't wish to disclose that here
2010-01-08T01:54:00.000Z	hey_man		is there somebody I can send a report to?
2010-01-08T01:55:00.000Z	hey_man	acicula	nevermind, I'll find somebody
2010-01-08T01:55:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	you want to complain about personal disclosure practice of someone affiliated with ubuntu?
2010-01-08T01:55:00.000Z	hey_man	acicula	yes
2010-01-08T01:56:00.000Z	acicula	hey_man	then id start with the person in question or his/her team, though not sure what you want to achieve?
2010-01-08T01:56:00.000Z	hey_man	acicula	fair enough
