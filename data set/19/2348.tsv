2010-09-19T04:51:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	actually, you want grub2 for 10.04
2010-09-19T04:56:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	it will be easier for us to help you if you could famiiarize yourself with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2...
2010-09-19T04:56:00.000Z	dwight	Loshki	ubottu I looked at that stuff, but didn't try it initially as my error message caused me to think it was something else
2010-09-19T04:58:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	your symptoms sound to me like grub is misconfigured. It's supposed to autoconfigure itself, but sometimes it messes up.
2010-09-19T04:59:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	9.10 and 10.4 are pretty close. It might work to try doing a grub2 reinstall from 9.10...
2010-09-19T05:00:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	is there something special about your hardware you haven't told us about yet? A reason why the autoconfigure would fail?
2010-09-19T05:00:00.000Z	dwight	Loshki	If that's the case, I already did the reinstall
2010-09-19T05:02:00.000Z	dwight	Loshki	Nothing exotic. Some TV tuners, a Geforce 210... Pretty vanilla.
2010-09-19T05:02:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	I'm concerned that if the autoconfig already failed once, it might keep on failing, in which case you may have to do some hand-editing.
2010-09-19T05:03:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	so was this an upgrade? Or a from-scratch mythtv system you're trying to put together?
2010-09-19T05:04:00.000Z	dwight	Loshki	It's been running for 6 months. No upgrade. 10.04 clean install.
2010-09-19T05:05:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	so it used to boot, and suddenly now it doesn't? Do you know what changed?
2010-09-19T05:07:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	either way, you need to be reading this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20GRUB%202
2010-09-19T05:07:00.000Z	dwight	Loshki	Over time, it seemed that Grub got fickle. Hardware change a bit, but nothing dramatic
2010-09-19T05:08:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	did you move disks around? That can invalidate a boot config....
2010-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	dwight	Loshki	Yes, but a long time ago. Has booted since then.
2010-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	back to the 'reinstalling grub2' page for you, then....
2010-09-19T05:16:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	the number of kernels shouldn't matter. Most people keep one current and one previous kernel, 'just in case'. Keeping more than 2 takes up disk space but it's otherwise harmless
2010-09-19T05:16:00.000Z	Loshki	dwight	good luck...
