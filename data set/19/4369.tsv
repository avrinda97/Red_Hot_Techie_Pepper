2009-07-02T22:10:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mdm	I know, but I don't see an option for Parallel
2009-07-02T22:11:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	does it list LPT#?
2009-07-02T22:12:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	does the computer HAVE a paralel port, it is enabled in BIOS?
2009-07-02T22:13:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	is parport0 loaded as a module?
2009-07-02T22:13:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	lsmod | grep parport
2009-07-02T22:14:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	now check for lp
2009-07-02T22:14:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mdm	yes parport_pc and parport
2009-07-02T22:16:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	then go looat at /var/log/cups/error_log and see why it does not like the port
2009-07-02T22:18:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	when you looked at dmesg did parport0 show a printer attached?

2009-07-02T22:21:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	go into your BIOS and turn on EPP
2009-07-02T22:21:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mdm	ok.
2009-07-02T22:33:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mdm	it seems to have found it but test page printing gibberish
2009-07-02T22:33:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	that is a matter of selecting a proper PPD, make sure you select one that matches the capability of the printer
2009-07-02T22:34:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	also did you enable DMA for it?
2009-07-02T22:37:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mdm	thanks, was the wron ppd.  I chose 810 ps/foomatic or something like that.  Switched to 800 laserjet.
2009-07-02T22:37:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	im glad it works, also if you did not already do so, enable DMA for the EPP on that port
2009-07-02T22:39:00.000Z	mdm	JuJuBee	DMA is not necessary.  Its just nice to have so you dont hold up your kernel while sending bits to the printer
