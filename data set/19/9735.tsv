2008-07-26T09:12:00.000Z	g0tcha		hey guys, is this correct to open port 6885: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6885 -j ACCEPT ?
2008-07-26T09:14:00.000Z	g0tcha		what are you talking about?
2008-07-26T09:15:00.000Z	g0tcha		i was asking about the iptables
2008-07-26T09:15:00.000Z	g0tcha		if this is right sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6885 -j ACCEPT
2008-07-26T09:16:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	if something is actually listening there
2008-07-26T09:17:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	so it should work?
2008-07-26T09:18:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	IF you connect from 192.168.0.0/16
2008-07-26T09:19:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	yeah, exactly, locally... when i telnet to this port it just doesnt do anything
2008-07-26T09:19:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	if you couldn't connect you'd get a "connection refused" immediately
2008-07-26T09:19:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	im using putty to telnet to it and its not giving me connection refused, it just stays there in black
2008-07-26T09:20:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	need more info
2008-07-26T09:20:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	this is basicly it, it just doesnt do anything when i telnet, putty stays black without bringing anything up
2008-07-26T09:21:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	not enough data to make a suggestion
2008-07-26T09:21:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	putty is NOT a telnet client btw
2008-07-26T09:22:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	use an actual telnet client
2008-07-26T09:22:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	well, it does telnet fine with other machines
2008-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	you ever run an eggdrop before?
2008-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	wols_	g0tcha	no. I'm still sane. sorta
2008-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	g0tcha	wols_	i ssh'd to ubuntu and tried to telnet from there, it does the same thing
