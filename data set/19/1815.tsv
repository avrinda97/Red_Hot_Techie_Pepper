2012-05-17T20:37:00.000Z	cordoval		ok lorddelta is there any other setting ? 2D does not seem that bad
2012-05-17T20:37:00.000Z	cordoval		is that the low power option?
2012-05-17T20:37:00.000Z	cordoval		it heats up less
2012-05-17T20:38:00.000Z	cordoval		problem lorddelta is that my graphics card is nvidia gtx440 and there is no good driver
2012-05-17T20:38:00.000Z	cordoval		also if I set to dual monitor my gpu temperatures go way up
2012-05-17T20:38:00.000Z	cordoval		100C
2012-05-17T20:39:00.000Z	cordoval		boiling point for no reason, i think ubuntu has problems
2012-05-17T20:39:00.000Z	cordoval		is there a way to do dual monitor without burning my lappy?
2012-05-17T20:39:00.000Z	cordoval		both heat up
2012-05-17T20:40:00.000Z	cordoval		is a mess
2012-05-17T20:40:00.000Z	mneptok	cordoval	are you using the proprietary nVidia drivers?
2012-05-17T20:40:00.000Z	mneptok	cordoval	the open source "nouveau" driver will do 2D. perhaps in more efficient ways? but if you need 3D, you need to proprietary driver.
2012-05-17T20:41:00.000Z	cordoval	mneptok	no need for 3D
2012-05-17T20:42:00.000Z	mneptok	cordoval	disable all 3D acceleration, and switch drivers. see what happens.
2012-05-17T20:42:00.000Z	cordoval	mneptok	how to switch back to old drivers?
2012-05-17T20:43:00.000Z	mneptok	cordoval	the same way you added the proprietary. disable those in the Restricted Drivers panel.
2012-05-17T20:45:00.000Z	mneptok	cordoval	if you remove them and reboot, the kernel should default back to what it has compiled in. in this case nouveau.
2012-05-17T20:46:00.000Z	cordoval	mneptok	so after reboot i go into 2D and just test i guess, any other thing i can do?
2012-05-17T20:47:00.000Z	mneptok	cordoval	this is probably the easiest thing, if changing drivers actually helps.
