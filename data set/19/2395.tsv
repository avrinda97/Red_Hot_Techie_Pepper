2010-04-18T09:42:00.000Z	bulletprf		I am new to Linux and I'm having problems with my sound, I can't hear anything through my speakers or headphone jack (nothing is muted) Can anyone help?
2010-04-18T09:43:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	Right click your speaker in the upper task bar.
2010-04-18T09:44:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	it's in preferences.
2010-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	There isn't anything in my hardware device list ??
2010-04-18T09:49:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	I don't know how, like I said I'm very new
2010-04-18T09:52:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	If you choose not to, then you go to the sound preferences and go to HardWare. From there, drop down the list and select Profiles. Try all of them until you find hardware.
2010-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	we can desktop share if you want, and there isn't anything in hardware
2010-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	You checked every single one of the Profiles?
2010-04-18T09:54:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	I don't know what profiles you are talking about
2010-04-18T09:58:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	there are no profiles at the bottom, the whole thing is blank, it just says Choose a device to configure: and Settings for the selected device: that's it
2010-04-18T10:01:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	now what?
2010-04-18T10:02:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	Are there any drivers that are available?
2010-04-18T10:04:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	just some Nvidia ones and a software modem, I activated the recommended one for Nvidia and the software one, but there isn't anything for my sound card
2010-04-18T10:07:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	just some Nvidia ones and a software modem, I activated the recommended one for Nvidia and the software one, but there isn't anything for my sound card
2010-04-18T10:08:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	I'm trying to find a resolution for the problem.
2010-04-18T10:16:00.000Z	techduddeee	bulletprf	My advice is to download/install all drivers being available.
2010-04-18T10:17:00.000Z	bulletprf	techduddeee	ok
