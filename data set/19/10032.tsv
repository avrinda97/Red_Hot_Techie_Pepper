2006-08-07T13:33:00.000Z	geekdom	GBK	  I have the same problem.  Tell her that you are rich :)
2006-08-07T13:34:00.000Z	geekdom	GBK	  usually that means you pulled out your usb stick without unmounting it first.   Learned the hard way
2006-08-07T13:35:00.000Z	geekdom	GBK	  later linuxes ( suse 10.1 ) handle the hostal removal much better
