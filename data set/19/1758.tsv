2011-07-21T04:54:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	why do you mock me ? you are an ubuntu master ? :)
2011-07-21T04:55:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	wasn't mocking you at all, it's a good thing the first time you come here to try and help, rather than be helped... i didn't mean that in a mocking manner at all.
2011-07-21T04:56:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	yes i know i was joking too once i talked with a guy who used linux since 1998 i wondered if it was you
2011-07-21T04:57:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	... i've been using it about that long.. but i don't recall ever chatting w/ you.. but im glad you've got everything going.
2011-07-21T05:01:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	so you come and help people here everyday ? do you know some people managing the ubuntuforums ?
2011-07-21T05:01:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	i'm here almost every day, yes, i don't hang out on the forums to often, so no.. i dont know anyone who manages the forums
2011-07-21T05:02:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	i ask that to you because now to see the forum you absolutelity have to login !! it is a real nightmare
2011-07-21T05:02:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	maybe you know somebody who know somebody you see ?
2011-07-21T05:02:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	i have a forum account, but.. i don't post there to often... (i prefer helping "live" here in the channel) i probably have less 100 posts there
2011-07-21T05:02:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	you mean the direct functionality in ubuntu to create a startup cd ?
2011-07-21T05:03:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	?..y ou went from asking me about the forums, to direct functionality oof ubuntu to create a startup cd... you lost me
2011-07-21T05:03:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	sorry :( nickname mistake
2011-07-21T05:04:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	well thats a relief, i was lost
2011-07-21T05:04:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	ok i said i was looking for the people managing the ubuntuforums to ask them why now you have to login to see posts
2011-07-21T05:05:00.000Z	KM0201	adam_	dunno, i'm sure they have their reasons though..
2011-07-21T05:07:00.000Z	adam_	KM0201	i suppose they have their reason so never mind i'll try to post directly on the forum to know more
