2007-02-12T11:16:00.000Z	Djainette		Hello all
2007-02-12T11:17:00.000Z	Djainette		I have a problem while mounting DVD-R. Is there any expert in the room ?
2007-02-12T11:18:00.000Z	Djainette		I also have crashdowns because of flash... But I'd rather fix my DVD-R problem
2007-02-12T11:19:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	Flashplayer 9?
2007-02-12T11:19:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	yep
2007-02-12T11:20:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	no log. But PC freezes and the sound loops
2007-02-12T11:20:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	You can move the libflashplayer.so to backup dir, the FF will not crash again
2007-02-12T11:21:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	backup dir ? in my .mozilla ?
2007-02-12T11:21:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	its' not only a Firefox crash. The whole PC crashes
2007-02-12T11:22:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	if you don't have backup dir, you can create a folder on your desktop screen "backup" look for libflashplayer.so then drag the file to backup folder
2007-02-12T11:22:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	I already reported to adobe techie information, they'll create new one
2007-02-12T11:24:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	I didn't quite get it... Do I have to create a "backup" folder in my "Desktop" folder ? Will that prevent crashes ? o_O
2007-02-12T11:26:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	the .so file doesn't runable.. it's special program that FF will run .so file.. does your CPU spikes at 100?
2007-02-12T11:26:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	dunno, I never monitor my CPU.
2007-02-12T11:28:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	after you moved the file, the FF will pop up "require plugins" just ignore it till the adobe fix the libflashplayer.so file when they will be available to download..
2007-02-12T11:28:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	ok, thanks for the tip. I'm glad Adobe knows about the issue
2007-02-12T11:29:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	you're welcome
2007-02-12T11:33:00.000Z	Djainette	PwcrLinux	Do you know where I could find the flash player 7 ?
2007-02-12T11:34:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Djainette	it's gone or somewhere in server might have back up file
