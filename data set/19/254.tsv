2012-05-20T11:46:00.000Z	shape		Does anyone know if your firewall iptables is not enabled, if it makes you vulnerable to attacks? I remember in Windows I was getting attacked all the time.
2012-05-20T11:48:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	depends on who you ask..  you behind a router?
2012-05-20T11:49:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	yes.
2012-05-20T11:50:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	Linksys wrt54gl. Yeah and it's all good, yet Comodo still detects intrusions in Windows.
2012-05-20T11:50:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	blocks intrusions*
2012-05-20T11:51:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	Oh, yes I know that. I was just asking if you have iptables disabled, would you still be safe.
2012-05-20T11:54:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	why do you have it disabled?
2012-05-20T11:56:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	can you please paste me what you said in case you responded? My internet crashed. :(
2012-05-20T11:57:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	Just asked why you have iptables off.
2012-05-20T11:58:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	before I answer that, is iptables the same as ufw ?
2012-05-20T11:58:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	then it's not off sorry. I meant ufw is disabled.
2012-05-20T11:58:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	ufw is a iptables frontend
2012-05-20T12:00:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	Chain input policies are set to accept, what does that mean?
2012-05-20T12:01:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	that is default.
2012-05-20T12:01:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	so it's all good, right?
2012-05-20T12:02:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	So is there any other way I might be at risk against attacks? Or just being on Ubuntu makes it hard to do that.
2012-05-20T12:03:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	being on ubuntu makes it hard, but it really depends on what you are doing.
2012-05-20T12:04:00.000Z	shape	jellypod	Like malicious websites trying to attack you.
2012-05-20T12:04:00.000Z	jellypod	shape	that is a different issue
