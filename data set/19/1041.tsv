2011-07-16T14:43:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	anything you do after updating?
2011-07-16T14:44:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	- nope updated it and it asked me to restart
2011-07-16T14:44:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	and?
2011-07-16T14:44:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	it gets to the login screen > I put in my password > it goes black and kicks me back to the login screen again
2011-07-16T14:45:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	if I put in the wrong password it says authentication failed
2011-07-16T14:45:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	I've tried using CLI to add a new user called tester, which it logs then just halts with the default background
2011-07-16T14:52:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	you want me to past what comes up when I type in gdm?
2011-07-16T14:52:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	or gdm3
2011-07-16T14:53:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	probably wouldn't hurt if you do this anyway
2011-07-16T14:53:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	sudo apt-get install --reinstall gdm && sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2011-07-16T14:53:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	gdm says warning, failed to acquire org.gnome.displaymanager
2011-07-16T14:53:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	cool 1 sec
2011-07-16T14:53:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	it'll reinstall gdm and tries to reconfigure it for you
2011-07-16T14:54:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	updated but didn't do anything much
2011-07-16T14:56:00.000Z	asdjaputra	Dasc	so does it work?
2011-07-16T14:56:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	nope didn't work
2011-07-16T14:57:00.000Z	Dasc	asdjaputra	in the cli it downloaded some stuff, then just updated it, but didn't help with the login, still kicks me out immediately after I type in the correct password
