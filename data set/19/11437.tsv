2006-01-21T14:09:00.000Z	thisplayer	sethk	how would i do this?
2006-01-21T14:04:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	that makes no sense.  xterm is a terminal emulation program.  bash is a shell.
2006-01-21T14:05:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	almost certainly you are running bash within an xterm.
2006-01-21T14:06:00.000Z	thisplayer	sethk	oo..i see..
2006-01-21T14:06:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	because your initial shell is a login shell, and the next shell is a non-login shell, and they use different configuration files
2006-01-21T14:06:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	login shells use .bash_login, other shells use .bashrc
2006-01-21T14:06:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	there are some other files but those are the most common
2006-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	what I always do is source .bashrc in .bash_profile, (or v.v, it doesn't matter)
2006-01-21T14:08:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	not weird at all.  as I said, the login shell sources different config files.  This is a very very common problem/question
2006-01-21T14:09:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	you can validate it by using the flag that tells bash to act like a login shell, even if it isn't
2006-01-21T14:09:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	let me check the man page
2006-01-21T14:10:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	in man bash, you'll find a section INVOCATION, that has some good details about how all of this works
2006-01-21T14:10:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	I believe the -l flag tells bash to act as a login shell
2006-01-21T14:11:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	the basic idea is sound; there are things that you want to do at least once, that are somewhat inefficient to do each time you start a child shell
2006-01-21T14:11:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	also it insulates child shells from certain things (such as the DISPLAY variable, which can be inherited, and thus only has to be set correctly in one place).
2006-01-21T14:11:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	the treatment of DISPLAY when using ssh -X is a good example
2006-01-21T14:13:00.000Z	thisplayer	sethk	ended up creating a .bash_profile, that seemed to do the trick. thanks for your help
2006-01-21T14:13:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	the paths can be confusing.  the shell looks for certain files in the home directory, then in /etc if they aren't there in /home
2006-01-21T14:14:00.000Z	sethk	thisplayer	good, glad you were able to fix it.
