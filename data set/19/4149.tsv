2010-03-04T20:48:00.000Z	chiiiiiz		Hi!!!
2010-03-04T20:49:00.000Z	chiiiiiz		I have purchased a Verbatim disk, it is formated FAT32. I have lost 150 Go of files... Even when I show the hidden files, even in the .trashes... there is nothing... but when I do a df command, it tells me that I only have 350 Go free... My 150Go files are not digitally gone... but where are they?
2010-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	chiiiiiz		hi!
2010-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	chiiiiiz		I do
2010-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	did you lost some file or just have the available space counter wrong?
2010-03-04T20:51:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	did you lost some file or just have the available space counter wrong?
2010-03-04T20:51:00.000Z	chiiiiiz	Nitsuga	I did lost files... as far as I know, I did not empty the bin... but I can't find my files anywhere
2010-03-04T20:52:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	did you try to use baobab to find the files?
2010-03-04T20:52:00.000Z	chiiiiiz		I guess they are still on the disk, but the "catalog" that says where they are does not find them... otherwise it would says I have my 500 Go free
2010-03-04T20:52:00.000Z	chiiiiiz		baobab? I did not know this*
2010-03-04T20:53:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	alt f2> baobab
2010-03-04T20:53:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	and click explore filesystem
2010-03-04T20:54:00.000Z	chiiiiiz	Nitsuga	work on progress... thanks
2010-03-04T20:55:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	good luck ;)
2010-03-04T20:55:00.000Z	chiiiiiz	Nitsuga	it has analysed the Verbatim disk: it has found nothing... so I guess the free space counter must be wrong...
2010-03-04T20:56:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	baobab is a free space explorer
2010-03-04T20:56:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	look for a big folder with your files
2010-03-04T20:56:00.000Z	Nitsuga		i have to go.
2010-03-04T20:57:00.000Z	Nitsuga	chiiiiiz	but to reset the free space counter use fsck-vaft after umounting the partition.
