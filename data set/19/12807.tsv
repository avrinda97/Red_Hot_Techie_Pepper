2005-07-05T06:51:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	: what? his internal dns server is screwed, is all.
2005-07-05T07:20:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	: sftp is the way to go (assuming users have local account)
2005-07-05T07:21:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	pureftpd can use sftp with virtual accounts....
2005-07-05T07:22:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	: I was thinking of the built-in sftp server in sshd
2005-07-05T07:22:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	that requires local accounts indeed
2005-07-05T07:23:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	: my current favourite is webdav over ssl, especially for web publishing.
2005-07-05T07:24:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	nonsense X has not been stolen from mac...
2005-07-05T07:24:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	: you parsed 'they' wrong

2005-07-07T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	sort of
2005-07-09T05:50:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	it is
2005-07-09T05:52:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	that' wouldn't open a display :$ - i went for xine, that seemed to have no problems.
2005-07-09T05:52:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	edit /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf and set ao=esd
2005-07-09T05:53:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	/ spike http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoundProblemsHoary
2006-03-19T08:54:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	but surely there's a patchset to apply to the stock source?
2006-03-19T08:54:00.000Z	Seveas	rasputnik	ubuntu-patch-$abinumber
2006-03-19T08:55:00.000Z	rasputnik	Seveas	cheers (I"m having a go at xen soon and could do with a headstart)
