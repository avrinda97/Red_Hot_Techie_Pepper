2007-01-27T11:01:00.000Z	shatrat	bootleg	Ive seen 2 people this week who had discs with errors becaue they burned at max speed and had no problems at 4x.  If youre ignorant, at least be ignorant and quiet.
2007-01-27T11:25:00.000Z	shatrat	bootleg	did you reboot into windows to join IRC or are you on a different PC and its still sitting there?
2007-01-27T11:33:00.000Z	shatrat	bootleg	have you tried starting with the safe graphics settings options?
2007-01-27T11:34:00.000Z	shatrat	bootleg	more like ATI hates their customers
2007-01-27T11:35:00.000Z	shatrat	bootleg	for years they had only 1 single person maintaining the ATI drivers.  Theyre getting better now but theyre still nowhere near as good as nvidia or even some intel drivers
