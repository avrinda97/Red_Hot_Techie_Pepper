2007-01-17T16:05:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	you got a pastebin of your sudoers?
2007-01-17T16:05:00.000Z	freshburn		does being in the "sudo" group do anything?
2007-01-17T16:05:00.000Z	freshburn	selahone	jsut a sec and i will
2007-01-17T16:06:00.000Z	freshburn		why dont use vlc?
2007-01-17T16:06:00.000Z	freshburn		when i run visudo it says permission denied but when i try sudo visudo it doesnt ask for passwd and it runs it
2007-01-17T16:09:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	it sounds like you've got password turned off somewhere in your sudoers
2007-01-17T16:12:00.000Z	freshburn		pastebin of sudoers is past.ubuntu-nl.org/1976
2007-01-17T16:13:00.000Z	freshburn	selahone	pastebin 1976
2007-01-17T16:15:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	that looks like an unaltered sudoers..have you tried visudo -c in a terminal window to verify it's a good one?
2007-01-17T16:16:00.000Z	freshburn	selahone	file parsed ok
2007-01-17T16:16:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	have you created a gui root login and are logged in as root? I'm running out of ideas. lol
2007-01-17T16:17:00.000Z	freshburn	selahone	ive created and enabled the root login in kdmrc but i am NOT loged in as root
2007-01-17T16:17:00.000Z	freshburn		nor at a root shell
2007-01-17T16:17:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	sorry then I'm out of ideas.
2007-01-17T16:18:00.000Z	freshburn		k
2007-01-17T16:18:00.000Z	freshburn	selahone	it seems it started behaving that way once i enabled the root login
2007-01-17T16:19:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	the only other thing I can think of is that whatever method you used to create a root login in ubuntu somehow gave root status to the user id you are logged in on.
2007-01-17T16:20:00.000Z	freshburn	selahone	i changed allow root login from false to true in the file KDMRC and in the user manager gui from the K menu i clicked enabled instead of disabled on the root account page
2007-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	selahone	freshburn	sorry I haven't done any of that so I can't help you.
