2007-05-17T07:56:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi all.  What is the control file governing the rotation of /var/log/messages?
2007-05-17T07:57:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	I think there's something called logrotate
2007-05-17T08:01:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	logrotate does not rotate /var/log/messages
2007-05-17T08:02:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	ok.. I don't know how it's used.. but I think many applications depends on it for rotating logs.. figured perhaps the system does that too
2007-05-17T08:03:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	something called sysklogd does the actual rotating, and putting the --MARK-- lines in, but I can't see which file controls sysklod
2007-05-17T08:03:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	checked crontab?
2007-05-17T08:05:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	crontab just has the usual in it.  ie run cron.daily daily, cron.monthly monthly, etc.
2007-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	then I'm out of ideas.... if it's being done on a timed schedule I would expect to find it in crontab.. but perhaps it's based on something else.. size of log or something..
2007-05-17T08:08:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	it is kind of in crontab.  sysklogd is run daily.
2007-05-17T08:09:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	well.. perhaps some googling on the subject might help you... anyways, I'm already late getting to bed.. hope you find out what rotates those log files =)
2007-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	thanks for the help.  You may have flipped over a new scent for me to chase
2007-10-20T04:02:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	python seems popular
2009-03-12T17:00:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	virtualbox is nice..
2010-03-15T00:53:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	nope.. I think cups does just fine without apache
2010-03-15T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	try running this command "apt-cache rdepends apache2 --installed"
2010-03-15T00:56:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	What does that do,  list all the apps that depend on apache?
2010-03-15T00:57:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	it lists all packages that depends on apache2.. but only prints out the ones that are installed
2010-03-15T01:02:00.000Z	dsnyders	Slart	apt-cache rdepends apache2 --installed  listed "hundreds" of lines of apache2-mpm-event, prefork, worker and itk
2010-03-15T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	dsnyders	mm.. it does that for me too
