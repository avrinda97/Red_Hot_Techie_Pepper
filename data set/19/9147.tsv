2006-12-27T12:44:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	what is a " linux-subnetting-machine" ?
2006-12-27T12:45:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	its a machine i run with 6 ethernet interfaces  with different rubnets on them... it routes between / runs NAPT
2006-12-27T12:45:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	you said it didnt run NAT??
2006-12-27T12:46:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	firewall rules etc.. runs recursive-dns with uptodate list of root nameservers... also avaids haddling external servers for forward-reverse r.e. internal/private IPs
2006-12-27T12:46:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	it has NAPT...
2006-12-27T12:46:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	but I can sub-subnet a /29 or /30 to another subnet with real-IPs if i like
2006-12-27T12:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	by NAPT you mean port translation??
2006-12-27T12:46:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	yess .network address with port tranlation... different no plain NAT
2006-12-27T12:47:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	yes, i know -- but it is NAT nonetheless
2006-12-27T12:47:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	e.g. trocoll/wiltscoll had a NAT (NOT NAPT) running between the interneta an d their dmz/like hosts... 195.195.247.132 -- 172.19.1.4, 195.195.247.133 -- 172.19.1.5  etc.
2006-12-27T12:48:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	172.19.1.4 being a RFC1918 private address
2006-12-27T12:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	do you have a problem or you here to teach NAT? that's all i'm worried about :)
2006-12-27T12:49:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	NAPT is different and stateful-requirement
2006-12-27T12:49:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	no problem ;-)
2006-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	it's called NAPT/PAT/NAT overloading is still NAT because it still translates between source and destination addresses
2006-12-27T12:51:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	and you should be calling your "subnetter-machine" a router, because thats what routers do, connect up different subnets
2006-12-27T12:51:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	well fine.. it is a router indeed ;-)
2007-01-11T13:45:00.000Z	enyc	un_operateur	coo... how did you create an appropriate dummy package ?
2007-01-11T13:45:00.000Z	un_operateur	enyc	 using !equivs
