2006-01-19T17:44:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		What do I need to install for gnome, to get all the core parts  of gnome for use with Kubuntu?
2006-01-19T06:25:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Hmmm./
2006-01-19T06:26:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Is totem supposed to be gnome's video player?
2006-01-19T06:26:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	it is Gnome's media player
2006-01-19T06:31:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	Totem has always been "simplified"
2006-01-19T06:32:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	Too simplified, I must say.
2006-01-19T06:48:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	Ubuntu arguably has the best GNOME desktop out there, so if you don't like Ubuntu's you should definetly find something else
2006-01-19T06:49:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	I use Kubuntu just fine, thank you. :)
2006-01-19T06:58:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	there is no pleasing you
2006-01-19T06:59:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	I'm quite pleased, actually. :)
2006-01-19T07:02:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	tried konversation?
2006-01-19T07:02:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	Yeah. That's my normal as of late. It's got some issues of it's own though. The text interface on it's a bit slow.
2006-01-19T07:10:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	Window-> Channel List
2006-01-19T07:10:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	nm
2006-01-19T07:11:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	Yeah. /JUST/ found it myself. :)
2006-01-19T07:38:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	you can get rid of the media automounter in kcontrol under KDE Services
2006-01-19T07:38:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	The part I really want to stop, mostly, is the fact it keeps opening a Konquerer to a CD/DVD I put in, and if it's a DVD movie, it'll auto-play it in Kaffeine. I like the popup window that asks me what to do, but when all 3 happen at the same time, it's annoying.
2006-01-19T07:40:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ORiON2012	Any idea how to fix that part of things in KDE? :)
2006-01-19T07:41:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Psi-Jack	nope
