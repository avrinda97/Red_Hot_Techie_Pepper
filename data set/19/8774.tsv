2007-05-10T10:23:00.000Z	Zoffix		Hi, I've just installed Fiesty and now I have a dual-boot XP and Ubuntu. I have a problem, I access Internet via a wireless card, however I need to install ndiswrapper in order to use it. When I try to compile it it gives me errors that it cannot find some header files. IIRC you need to install some package in order to be able to compile. BUT I can't access Internet from Ubuntu. Is there any way to download the needed package on XP and then install it

2007-05-10T10:26:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	well, when I was installing Edgy somehow I got it compiled in seconds. For some reason when I insert the CD into CD-ROM I don't get that message "Found some packages on CD, wanna install some?" message as I did on Edgy :/ it's a 700MB ISO, should headers be there? Or even any packages that are not installed by default.
2007-05-10T10:29:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	your cd is probably not in your sources list.  you can add it with this command: "sudo apt-cdrom add" then update the sources list with "sudo apt-get update" (or sudo aptitude update)
2007-05-10T10:30:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	ok, thanks. Let me try that.
2007-05-10T11:03:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	what error are you getting when you try to access your cd-rom?
2007-05-10T11:06:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	hey, well, I think it was you who I was talking to about my packages not visible from CD-ROM. When I ran the command you told me it was giving me "E: Could not mount CD-ROM" and it looked like it wasn't even trying. So I right clicked on the CD-ROM icon and changed "Mount Point" to "/mnt". Now when I insert CD-ROM it gives me "Unable to mount the volume "Ubuntu 7.04 i386" mount_point cannot contain the following characters: newline, G_
2007-05-10T11:08:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	did you get the full message? Ended with "broke it even more" I managed to `ssh` to my second box and using irssi and I know it likes to cut stuff out. BTW, is it possible to install the packages I need via this SSH connection?
2007-05-10T11:10:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	which machine are you ssd into?  obvoiusly not the one w/o any wireless yet, right?
2007-05-10T11:11:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	I have two boxes, both use wireless to connect to Internet and they are interconnected with wire Ethernet too.
2007-05-10T11:11:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	now on my main box I installed Ubuntu Fiesty from scratch and can't get the wireless card working (need to compile ndiswrapper)
2007-05-10T11:12:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	if you are ssh'ed into the machine that needs the linux-headers you can get the files you need
2007-05-10T11:12:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	no, I ssh'd FROM the machine that needs headers
2007-05-10T11:13:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	I run irssi via ssh
2007-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	oh.  i was confused.  i guess i'm tired and not much help for you.
2007-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	well, any idea how I can fix the mount point for my CD-ROM that I've just messed up :/
2007-05-10T11:26:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	try /media/cdrom0 with your -d option
2007-05-10T11:27:00.000Z	Zoffix	FakeOutdoorsman	instantly gives me "E: Failed to mount the cdrom" and I think it is trying the other (broken) one.
2007-05-10T11:51:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	Zoffix	excellent.
