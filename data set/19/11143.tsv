2007-06-21T07:42:00.000Z	pike_	student	run the verify disk thing at bootup. as a rule 1) burn the iso at the slowest speed  2) verify the image beforehand and md5sum the disk after. of course i never do 2)
2007-06-21T07:43:00.000Z	student	pike_	i verified the disk at bootup and it doesnt verify it...it says somethign is wrong...i cant remember what...but i used those discs earlier...i even burned those discs on a mac...and one of those discs was an orginal badger disc

2007-06-21T07:48:00.000Z	pike_	student	id get one of those burner programs from downloads.com i guess. its been so long im not sure of that site anymore but any of em aught to do. the md5sum thing isnt a big deal but make sure you burn at slowest speed
