2005-09-14T09:25:00.000Z	pawdro		thx
2005-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	pawdro		and how can I check the version of jdk installed?
2005-09-14T09:28:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	usually you just type: programame --version
2005-12-12T12:51:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	for P3 you should choose "Pentium-III/Celeron(Coppermine)/Pentium-III Xeon) probably.
2005-12-12T12:52:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	webwolf_27 was right that 586 is a safe bet though if you're unsure :)
2006-01-09T10:31:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	try to reinstall gdm
2006-01-09T10:36:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	did you by any chance re-install the system without formatting the /home/ partition? if so, the users id numbers may be messed up...
2006-01-09T10:38:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	ok, just a shot in the dark.
2006-01-09T10:40:00.000Z	pawdro	Jowi	i assume that i have to reinstall whole system
2006-01-09T10:40:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	i doubt it
2006-01-09T10:40:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	maybe the gdm config files is not overwritten when gdm is re-installed...?
2006-01-09T10:41:00.000Z	pawdro	Jowi	yes
2006-01-09T10:42:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	does any other work, like xdm, wdm, kdm ?
2006-01-09T10:43:00.000Z	pawdro	Jowi	i cant even lag as a normal user
2006-01-09T10:44:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	what is the exact error?
2006-01-09T10:45:00.000Z	pawdro	Jowi	if i want to log as a "user" i get Unable to cd "/home/user"
2006-01-09T10:45:00.000Z	pawdro	Jowi	if i want to start gdm (as a root ofcourse) i get: gdm_config_parse: Authdir /var/lib/gdm does not exist. Aborting.
2006-01-09T10:46:00.000Z	pawdro	Jowi	the same with /etc/init.d/gdm
2006-01-09T10:46:00.000Z	Jowi	pawdro	it seems like gdm is not installed
