2008-02-02T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	ask the question then
2008-02-02T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	does the proxy require authentication ?
2008-02-02T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	are you certan as a lot of proxy's will authenticate without you knowthing through active directory
2008-02-02T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	the first thing to do is telnet to the proxy port and see if you can actually get to it and what it's response is
2008-02-02T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	telnet to the port on the proxy and see how it responds ?
2008-02-02T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	what happens when you telnet to it ?
2008-02-02T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	what happens when you telnet to it ?
2008-02-02T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	1.) don't use that sort of language, its the best way to get kicked 2.) vista has a telnet client
2008-02-02T02:26:00.000Z	ikonia	umair	do what you want, I don't like your approach or language
