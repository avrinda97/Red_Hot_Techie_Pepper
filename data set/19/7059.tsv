2007-10-19T07:03:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		this is so irritating. i think i will just reinstall openSUSE 10.3 until we decide to make a REAL ubuntu release that does not depend on proprietary drivers that cannot be included...
2007-10-19T07:03:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		wait though... how did you other Nvidia ppl have a functional liveCD if that depends on nvidia-glx? i'm confused now
2007-10-19T07:04:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		i'm sorry i love ubuntu but i get depressed when i can't get an OS installed.
2007-10-19T07:05:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		i'm just joking anyway i hate openSUSE. but ppl on the newer nvidia cards... what did the default xorg.conf say?
2007-10-19T07:07:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		i have a question for nvidia users... does the livecd actually boot up and say that it is already using restricted nvidia drivers?
2007-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		or are the restricted nvidia drivers dl'd after install?
2007-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	the latter
2007-10-19T07:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	it wont run compiz but it should boot to X no problem...
2007-10-19T07:54:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	Evanlec	it is not even running X server properly. Just a blank black screen no matter what I try to do...
2007-10-19T07:55:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	hmm, are u seeing a splash screen or no?
2007-10-19T07:55:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	Evanlec	the splash screen and stuff works but when it tries to get to the desktop, it simply gives me a black screen
2007-10-19T07:55:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	Evanlec	but the progrss bar and boot menu works
2007-10-19T07:56:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	it doesnt kick you back to a tty?
2007-10-19T07:56:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	Evanlec	nope
2007-10-19T07:56:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	okay well i asked because i had a 'no splash screen boot freeze' problem
2007-10-19T07:57:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	yes that is what i did..
2007-10-19T07:59:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	why dont u just reinstall and use the nv driver this time
2007-10-19T08:00:00.000Z	the_darkside_986	Evanlec	I cannot even get to the point where I install or do a clean install because X server will never work on the liveCD. I'm on gutsy now but i am afraid to do a dist-upgrade
2007-10-19T08:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	the_darkside_986	forget dist-upgrade, will take forever right now, just grab the alternate cd
