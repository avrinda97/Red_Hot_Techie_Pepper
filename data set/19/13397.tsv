2005-04-08T07:21:00.000Z	robertj	Uscfan	My guess would be that localhost is not pointing to 127.0.0.1
2005-04-08T07:24:00.000Z	robertj	Uscfan	but yeah, you may need to go into single user mode
2005-04-08T07:24:00.000Z	Uscfan	robertj	??? explain
2005-04-08T07:24:00.000Z	robertj	Uscfan	my _guess_ is that localhost is not in /etc/hosts
2005-04-08T07:27:00.000Z	robertj	Uscfan	yeah but I would put michael firt
2005-04-08T07:28:00.000Z	Uscfan	robertj	ok, any thoughts pizbit
2005-04-08T07:30:00.000Z	robertj	Uscfan	did you set your root pass?
2005-04-08T07:32:00.000Z	robertj	Uscfan	that's why its called single user mode, you have one user who has no restrictions
