2005-09-29T09:36:00.000Z	crafteh		My friend said there is some apt server that has all kinds of packages that the main one doesn't ... like sun's java jre/jdk ... how do I add this server and find out about it?
2005-09-29T09:37:00.000Z	crafteh		ah... I heard its not "official"... but that there is still one?
2005-09-29T09:38:00.000Z	crafteh		How can I get mysql 4.3 from apt?
2005-09-29T09:38:00.000Z	crafteh		it seems to only have 4.0 :\
2005-09-29T09:40:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	no
2005-09-29T09:40:00.000Z	crafteh	nalioth	thanks
2005-09-29T09:41:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	you have to go out of your way to get "unstable" stuff
2005-12-01T13:42:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	dpkg keeps a log, but i'm not sure where it is kept
2005-12-01T13:43:00.000Z	crafteh	nalioth	ok- thanks
2006-01-02T08:56:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	convert to what?
2006-01-02T08:57:00.000Z	crafteh	nalioth	something like ogg or mp3?
2006-01-02T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	if you've got the right codecs onboard, you should be able to convert to anything. having faad and / or faac codecs will let you listen to them as is
2006-01-02T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	if you like.
2006-01-02T09:00:00.000Z	crafteh	nalioth	for some reason i can't get amarok to pick up the m4a's when it scans... they play though if i add them to the playlist manually
2006-01-02T09:00:00.000Z	crafteh	nalioth	what media player do you use?
2006-01-02T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	they are kind of a new format
2006-01-02T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	rhythmbox
2006-01-02T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	crafteh	as i said earlier, they play fine
2006-01-02T09:02:00.000Z	crafteh	nalioth	nice... rhythmbox has a cleaner interface too
