2008-10-23T14:10:00.000Z	Arvan		yes, and that worked..The thing is that i do not burn so much stuff, i rather play it direktly
2008-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	I do that too, I just use xbmc for ubuntu, it will read damn near every format of video I've ever found, and it will read isos and videos inside rar files
2008-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	xbmc you say..Will try that one for sure. I tried with VLC and with Mplayer so far..The movie plays, but i can choose subs or stuff like that
2008-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	I don't know anything about subs, but xbmc rocks for downloaded video
2008-10-23T14:15:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	 where do i find that amazing player? =)
2008-10-23T14:15:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	if it's an iso of a dvd xbmc gives you full access to the menus
2008-10-23T14:16:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	http://xbmc.org
2008-10-23T14:18:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	 im on it..Lets se if i can get this sucker runin
2008-10-23T14:19:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	they have a hardy repo so you can apt-get install it
2008-10-23T14:19:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	 im sort of new to this linux thing =) but i get the point atleast.
2008-10-23T14:23:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	i enterd the lines of code that i found on the website..The response was "command not found" i probably did it all wrong but im a big noob as i told you =)
2008-10-23T14:24:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	the lines of code it gives you are for the repositories, you have to add them to your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2008-10-23T14:27:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	they should be under 3rd party software right?
2008-10-23T14:28:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	http://xbmc.org/forum/showthread.php?p=185738
2008-10-23T14:35:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	 i got it =)
2008-10-23T14:36:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	let me know how you like it
2008-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	i got it working and so does the menues...The problem now is that the movies plays very very fast and i don have any sound.
2008-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	dulak	Arvan	I am not sure about that, mine worked great out of the box, you might check the xbmc forums for ideas
2008-10-23T15:07:00.000Z	Arvan	dulak	Still the same :S But while uppdating the codecs and all that i got to a sertain point where i could not press <ok> i think that might have bin the problem.
