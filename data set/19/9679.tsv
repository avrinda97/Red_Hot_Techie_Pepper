2006-12-01T15:40:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	configure your /etc/apt/sources.list (or copy it from the desktop), then 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2007-02-04T10:24:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	try 'apt-cache show network-manager'
2007-02-04T10:25:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	I
2007-02-04T10:27:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	I've tried Network Manager before, it works but it doesn't show me each WiFi spots Signal Strength correctly, it shows them all at 100% strength. It also won't let me connect to my own secured/password WiFi, yet it will connect to my neighbors that isnt secured
2007-02-04T10:28:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	Is that normal?
2007-02-04T10:30:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	I don't know, I haven't had this type of difficulty. But then my environment is simpler.
2007-02-04T10:31:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	simpler?
2007-02-04T10:31:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	have you ever heard of someone not being able to see the 'true' strength before. mine are all showing up as 100% wifi stength
2007-02-04T10:32:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	there is just one AP I want to connect to, unencrypted. I don't get interference from the neighbours' networks
2007-02-04T10:34:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	the wrong signal strength indicator is a driver problem, I believe
2007-02-04T10:34:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	Yeah, I'm using the ndiswrapper thing
2007-02-04T10:35:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	have you found the docs in file:///usr/share/doc/network-manager ?
2007-02-04T10:36:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	no, what is that
2007-02-04T10:36:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	a local directory containing documentation
2007-02-04T10:36:00.000Z	xzk	soundray	what version of Network Manager do you use
2007-02-04T10:37:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	the one in dapper. Sorry, I'm not working on the machine in question right now.
2007-02-04T10:38:00.000Z	soundray	xzk	it's 0.6.2-0ubuntu7
