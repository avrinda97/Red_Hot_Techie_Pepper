2011-01-04T20:27:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	try restarting compiz
2011-01-04T20:28:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	compiz, ok
2011-01-04T20:29:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	Where is compiz I tried /etc/init.d/compiz restart and said command not found. Or did you mean restart the computer?
2011-01-04T20:30:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	just kill it from the System monitor and type in 'compiz' in terminal.
2011-01-04T20:30:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	ok
2011-01-04T20:34:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	I am not seeing compiz I am using xfce but it also shows some gnome processes running..
2011-01-04T20:35:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	Sorry bud! I don't have knowledge about Xfce processes, but I'm wondering why Gnome processes are running in there. If there's a process named gnome-settings-daemon, try to kill and restart it.
2011-01-04T20:36:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	that I believe there is let me try that
2011-01-04T20:39:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	no gnome-settings but I did play around with killing some xfce processes to no avail. (except logging me out of the gui) I think I will just uninstall xfce, sudo apt-get remove xfce?
2011-01-04T20:39:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	any previous experiences with Xfce or a newbie? I like Gnome and if you're a newbie, do give it a try. :-)
2011-01-04T20:41:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	I have used gnome before and liked it better. Netbook edition too. That's what I will replace it with when I figure out how to uninstall xfce
2011-01-04T20:41:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	Good Luck with that bud! :-)
2011-01-04T20:42:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	so you're a web-developer?
2011-01-04T20:44:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	I'm not great at it but I run the company website and I have my own little hobby site. Although thats run out of a server in my house which is down right now until I fix the processor cooler (bad water pump)
2011-01-04T20:44:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	LOL! Okay! :-)
2011-01-04T20:48:00.000Z	Soyo	h-dee	I am trying out aptitude remove xubuntu-desktop on tty2 (finger's crossed)
2011-01-04T20:48:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	Good Luck bud!
2011-01-04T20:50:00.000Z	h-dee	Soyo	Give it a go.....
