2006-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	there are ubuntu packages of SUN's java
2006-10-04T07:32:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	yeah but I lovely to download and install manually cuz I need to change JAVA_HOME to do some tests
2006-10-04T07:32:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	*love
2006-10-04T07:33:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	you can change JAVA_HOME with environment variables
2006-10-04T07:33:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	changed and I even fixed update-alternatives manullay by redirecting the symlink in /etc/alternative/java, javaws and java_vm and completely ignore update-alternative
2006-10-04T07:34:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	doesn't sound right...
2006-10-04T07:36:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	you're saying that running sudo update-alternatives didn't work?
2006-10-04T07:37:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	thanks for your link, but I thought I've already mentioned I need JDK 1.4, not 1.5
2006-10-12T09:44:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	with the adduser command, or via the gui tool
2006-10-12T09:37:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	/etc/bash.bashrc for system-wide config
2006-10-12T09:37:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	so...should I go to /etc/profile or /etc/bash.bashrc?
2006-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	even if you look at /etc/profile, you'll end up editing /etc/bash.bashrc
2006-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	okay...I just want to set $JAVA_HOME for system-wide environment, so I should go to /etc/bash.bashrc right?
2006-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	well, there may be a config file for the java package that might be a more appropriate place.
2006-10-12T09:40:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	I don't like update-alternative that messes up my Java environment since I need multiple environments coexisting for my development
2006-10-12T09:41:00.000Z	tritium	JavaDeveloper	okay, then do as you planned above
2006-10-12T09:42:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	okay..ic ic....but if I copy my jdk there, the permission is my own and group as well, is it a better idea to put a Java group there and setup the group permission for Java group?
2006-10-12T09:43:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	how do I add an user to a group?
2006-10-12T09:44:00.000Z	JavaDeveloper	tritium	thank you very much
