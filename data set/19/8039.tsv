2007-06-21T06:26:00.000Z	lmosher	nj786	A video DVD, or another dvd+r you burned?
2007-06-21T06:27:00.000Z	nj786	lmosher	i want to copy a dvd using dvd+r
2007-06-21T06:27:00.000Z	nj786	lmosher	 a dvd thati bought form the store
2007-06-21T06:28:00.000Z	lmosher	nj786	You can, it depends what the DVD is. If it's video, or a recent game... it might be bigger than 4GB, which means it might not fit on your DVD+R unless it's dual layer
2007-06-21T06:29:00.000Z	lmosher	nj786	If it's a video, there are some utilities to rip the video and then encode it in a poorer quality so it will fit on a burnable single-layer DVD. If it's a game, there's not much you can do but put it on two disks
2007-06-21T06:30:00.000Z	nj786	lmosher	i have a dvd+r(16x)disc and i am trying to make a copy of a dvd
2007-06-21T06:31:00.000Z	lmosher	nj786	yes I undertand. Your dvd+r 16x disk is probably -not- big enough to hold the information on the DVD you bought.
