2004-10-31T12:52:00.000Z	meff		im just excited to see something debian-based with current security patches and a nice release cycle!
2004-10-31T12:54:00.000Z	meff		"Each driver needs to be available for kernel 2.6, since we will only support a bare-bones 2.4 as a fallback for conservative server-oriented users (as discussed on the mailing list already)." .. so is there a 2.4 pkg or not? :)
2004-10-31T12:55:00.000Z	bob2	meff	as I said, yes.
2004-10-31T12:55:00.000Z	bob2	meff	but they're not supported
2004-10-31T12:57:00.000Z	bob2	meff	it will not change much in the next few hours
2004-10-31T12:58:00.000Z	meff	bob2	i'm assuming it wont matter much cause right after i install im gonna apt-get upgrade the system :)
2004-10-31T12:58:00.000Z	bob2	meff	yeah, exactly
2004-10-31T13:03:00.000Z	meff	bob2	after 4.10 is released, is there going to be any repository similar to testing on debian that tracks newer packages for those of us on desktops that want the newest stuff?
2004-10-31T13:04:00.000Z	bob2	meff	yes.
2004-10-31T13:04:00.000Z	bob2	meff	the next release (hoary) will open up as a sid-style branch
2004-10-31T13:04:00.000Z	meff	bob2	sweet.
2004-12-13T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	meff	no
2004-12-13T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	meff	if you're building a kernel module, it wants linux-kernel-$(uname -r)
2004-12-13T10:42:00.000Z	meff	bob2	i installed linux-686 isnt it in there?
2004-12-13T10:42:00.000Z	bob2	meff	that's not what I said...
2004-12-13T10:43:00.000Z	meff	bob2	an apt-cache search for 'linux-kernel' only shows linux-kernel-headers
2004-12-13T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	meff	well, I see it here
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	meff	bob2	keeps beating me to it lol.. im on dvorak so typing a lil slow since i havent used it since i learned it years ago till lately :)
