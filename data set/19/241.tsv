2012-06-02T03:59:00.000Z	kosko		anyone knows how to make vim always start with the certain nice?
2012-06-02T03:59:00.000Z	kosko		aliase doesn't work
2012-06-02T03:59:00.000Z	kosko		alias*
2012-06-02T04:00:00.000Z	escott	kosko	what is your alias line? and why would you need to alias vim?
2012-06-02T04:00:00.000Z	escott	kosko	rather nice vim
2012-06-02T04:10:00.000Z	escott	kosko	up to -10 for without root privs is normally allowed
2012-06-02T04:12:00.000Z	kosko	escott	-5 permission denied
2012-06-02T04:12:00.000Z	escott	kosko	who are you?
2012-06-02T04:13:00.000Z	kosko	escott	excuse me?
2012-06-02T04:13:00.000Z	escott	kosko	i meant what is your uid? what groups are you in? but it seems you are correct you cannot increase priority
2012-06-02T04:14:00.000Z	kosko	escott	so even if i'll have the root user group i wouldn't be able to set a negative nice
2012-06-02T04:15:00.000Z	kosko	escott	CAP_SYS_NICE capability is supposed to do this
2012-06-02T04:15:00.000Z	escott	kosko	root can certainly do it. for other users you would need to modify the config in /etc
2012-06-02T04:15:00.000Z	kosko	escott	not yet know how to set it
2012-06-02T04:17:00.000Z	escott	kosko	presumably /etc/security
2012-06-02T04:19:00.000Z	escott	kosko	this link may help http://superuser.com/questions/40429/how-do-i-run-pulseaudio-with-realtime-priority-in-ubuntu-9-04
2012-06-02T04:19:00.000Z	kosko	escott	i see this info in the limits.conf file
2012-06-02T04:24:00.000Z	escott	kosko	i have no idea. rebooting would certainly force it to be reread
2012-06-02T04:25:00.000Z	escott	kosko	its not a shell script. it is read by some userspace program which injects the rules into the kernel
