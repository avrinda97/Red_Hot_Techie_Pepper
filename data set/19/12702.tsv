2005-07-21T06:31:00.000Z	knowledge_		I have a dell Inspiron 8200, and I'm trying to install the utils and it keeps telling me that it can't find /proc/i8k
2005-07-21T06:32:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	have you installed i8kutils?
2005-07-21T06:32:00.000Z	knowledge_		yeap
2005-07-21T06:32:00.000Z	knowledge_		I think it's missing i8k.o
2005-07-21T06:33:00.000Z	yaaar		well...i sold my 8100 about 2.5 years ago....but once upon a time i dealt with those drivers
2005-07-21T06:34:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	do 'lsmod | grep -i i8k'
2005-07-21T06:34:00.000Z	knowledge_		as su?
2005-07-21T06:34:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	yeah
2005-07-21T06:34:00.000Z	knowledge_		ok
2005-07-21T06:34:00.000Z	knowledge_		done
2005-07-21T06:36:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	did you get any output from that?
2005-07-21T06:36:00.000Z	knowledge_	yaaar	nothing
2005-07-21T06:40:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	k, try 'modprobe i8k'
2005-07-21T06:40:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	although from the looks of things i think you may have to compile a new kernel
2005-07-21T06:41:00.000Z	knowledge_		nothing with that either yaaar
2005-07-21T06:42:00.000Z	yaaar	knowledge_	oh cool, if you didn't get any output from the modprobe command it should have loaded. try the previous command again (the 'lsmod' one...hit the up arrow a few times to get it back)
