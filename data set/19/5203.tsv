2008-08-13T02:09:00.000Z	shawtylo		Okay, i'm installing irssi on my Ubuntu computer (this is win computer) and it requires glib. I configured glib but it says this about PKG-config (also installed) "...adding the path where the .pc file is located to PKG_CONFIG_PATH" How do I do this?
2008-08-13T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	shawtylo	install irssi from the repositories
2008-08-13T02:10:00.000Z	shawtylo		hmm
2008-08-13T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	shawtylo	sudo apti
2008-08-13T02:10:00.000Z	shawtylo		I guess that would make things easy
2008-08-13T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	shawtylo	sudo apt-get install irssi
2008-08-13T02:10:00.000Z	shawtylo		didn't know it was in the rep (i know i'm a noob)
