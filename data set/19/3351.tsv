2010-06-04T03:04:00.000Z	ibqn		I can't login to the graphical environment, gnome fails to load after an update with a message "no system tray was found on your system, mouse does not work...
2010-06-04T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	does the screen ract like it would a hover over (mouse is there but not visible)?
2010-06-04T03:05:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	no, does not seems so
2010-06-04T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	is it a laptop?
2010-06-04T03:06:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	yes, on my laptop
2010-06-04T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	try the i8024.reset boot option in /etc/default/grub
2010-06-04T03:07:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	what is this all about?
2010-06-04T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	you may ned a boot option to make the pad work, in my experience that one seems to work with most
2010-06-04T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	if you run: gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub     find this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"  and change it to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash i8024.reset"
2010-06-04T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	save the new file, close gedit then run: sudo update-grub
2010-06-04T03:09:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	I do not really folow what to do with grub and how it can be related with gnome, because only the graphicla environmet fails to load
2010-06-04T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	i thought you said there was only no mouse?
2010-06-04T03:10:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	i do not have a GUI at all, nothing loads
2010-06-04T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	gotcha, different solutio then. If you press ALT+F2 do you get the usual dialogue?
2010-06-04T03:11:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	not tried, wait...
2010-06-04T03:15:00.000Z	ibqn	ActionParsnip	seems, there is no way, there is only a gnomes desktop background image is all I can see
2010-06-04T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	ok then i'd log in as a different user, see if thats the same
2010-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	boot to recovery root mode, create a folder and move all the gconf based folders to the new folder, you should get vanilla settings
2011-10-24T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibqn	there needs to be an fstab file dude
