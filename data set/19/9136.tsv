2006-12-22T14:15:00.000Z	Shocka311		Hey can anyone tell me how to find a new device on ubuntu? I just put in a new cdrom and I can't figure out how to get my system to recognize it.
2006-12-22T14:17:00.000Z	Shocka311		Anyone???
2006-12-22T14:17:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	What is it?
2006-12-22T14:19:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	and it isn't recognized as /dev/hdc or /dev/hdc1 or anything?
2006-12-22T14:21:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	no, mount it to a mount point
2006-12-22T14:28:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	are you talking to me or someone els?
2006-12-22T14:28:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	go to the terminal
2006-12-22T14:30:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	ok how do I use pastebin?
2006-12-22T14:32:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38334/
2006-12-22T14:35:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	seems it didn't find your drive at all
2006-12-22T14:36:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	thats what I thought. is there any way I can search for it manually?
2006-12-22T14:36:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	not really
2006-12-22T14:37:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	I do have all of that.
2006-12-22T14:39:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	I hate, HATE asking this to people since I don't like to appear condescending, but did you install the device properly?
2006-12-22T14:40:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	i'm quite sure I did although I don't know too much about computers.  On windows you just plug it all in and you can search for the device or it just recognizes there is a new one
2006-12-22T14:43:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	How do I check the jumper setting?
2006-12-22T14:44:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	you'd want to turn your system off
2006-12-22T14:45:00.000Z	Shocka311	VMT2007	if I have a cdrom that is compatable with linux will it recognize it automatically or will I have to install it manually?
2006-12-22T14:46:00.000Z	VMT2007	Shocka311	it should just recognize it on boot
