2010-08-14T09:15:00.000Z	ellanceo		Is anyone able to help me with an OpenGL fullscreen scaling issue? I've been requesting help for about the last 2 years, and I just get ignored on the forums. I would greatly appreciate it!
2010-08-14T09:15:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	What's the problem?
2010-08-14T09:18:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	on-board graphics or dedicated card? // Up-to-date drivers? (I'm sure you've been asked this before, if you've been looking for help for two years)
2010-08-14T09:19:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	nvidia 7300go, latest nvidia drivers
2010-08-14T09:22:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	any suggestions? I've found others with the same issue, but no luck on a solution. It's killing me. I really just want to play with my MSX emulator. =(
2010-08-14T09:23:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	Poking around a bit to see what I can find... What version of the drivers?
2010-08-14T09:24:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	195.36.24
2010-08-14T09:24:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	Looks like you got a reply on your post as well. Still checking it out though.
2010-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	yeah,  I already tried what he suggested, several times.
2010-08-14T09:31:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	Found more bug reports on the issue, albeit older: looks like some people had reported this as a combination of xserver/opengl.
2010-08-14T09:32:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	It's obviously an OpenGL scaling issue that is probably stemming from my drivers or xorg.conf file. I checked xorg.conf today and found it is incredibly empty, but I also read that after 10.04 xorg.conf is handled differently?
2010-08-14T09:33:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	Yeah, I'm really not sure how to go about fixing it, but after 2 years, this has gone on long enough
2010-08-14T09:37:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	are you getting anything in your log file?
2010-08-14T09:38:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	Haha, which one? I never check logs. I'm a bad linux user, very bad
2010-08-14T09:41:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	Which log file should I check?
2010-08-14T09:46:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	Trying to find, couldn't tell you offhand as I'm in clie mode on a piddly little netbook at the moment. Desktop's having... issues.
2010-08-14T09:48:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	Well thank you very much for taking the time to help, glad to see someone cares. =)
2010-08-14T09:50:00.000Z	akoimeexx	ellanceo	Yeah, sorry I can't find out any more about it.... I would think errors would show up in Xorg.0.log or equiv. But nothing pointing here in my own files.
2010-08-14T09:54:00.000Z	ellanceo	akoimeexx	Alright, I'll see what i can see. Thanks again for the help, I really appreciate it.
