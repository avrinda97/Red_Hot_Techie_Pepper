2006-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	viperX		Could someone help me out for a sec please?
2006-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	viperX		Where can I go to download modules from?
2006-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	viperX		I don't have an internet connection for my Linux box. Is there a site that I can download modules from my iMac and then transfer to my Linux box?
2006-01-17T14:43:00.000Z	viperX		No i mean specific modules, like usb-storage module.
2006-01-17T14:44:00.000Z	viperX		I also need the modprobe module.
2006-01-17T14:45:00.000Z	viperX		Ummm, actually I'm suing Suse (don't hate me...), but no one was talking to me in any of the Suse channels, so i thought that I come here, becaue you guys have always been nice to me.
2006-01-17T14:46:00.000Z	viperX		*using Suse
2006-01-17T14:47:00.000Z	viperX		When i enter modprobe in the Terminal, it says command not found. So it has to be something that I have to install.
2006-01-17T14:48:00.000Z	viperX		usb-storage doesn't seem to be installed either.
2006-01-17T14:48:00.000Z	ftg2	viperX	modprobe is the kind of thing you run as root.. if you aren't currently root its likely not even in your path.
2006-01-17T14:48:00.000Z	viperX		one sec....
2006-01-17T14:49:00.000Z	viperX		ok, let me try that.
2006-01-17T14:52:00.000Z	viperX		Hey that worked! Thanks! :)
2006-01-17T14:52:00.000Z	viperX		Thats sad. I had to come to the Ubuntu channel to get help with the Suse distro
2006-01-17T14:55:00.000Z	viperX	topyli	How would I place modprobe in my path, so that I don't have to 'su -' the next time that I want to do that?
2006-01-17T14:58:00.000Z	ftg2	viperX	try looking in /etc/profile, to change the default path.. alternatively you can add to the $PATH variable with export.. export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin .. that change will only hang around until you exit the shell though
2006-01-17T14:59:00.000Z	viperX		oh, ok. I'll try both.
2006-01-17T14:59:00.000Z	viperX		thanks ftg2!
2006-01-17T14:59:00.000Z	ftg2	viperX	also pretty sure a reboot is required for changes to /etc/profile to take effect. not sure about that though
