2012-01-20T09:03:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	If you go for no warranty, you're betting that it'll be cheaper on average to replace the drive then to return it.
2012-01-20T09:03:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	there's no way to make the drive reliable again
2012-01-20T09:04:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	Is it even possible to buy a drive without a warantty?
2012-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	What brand?
2012-01-20T09:09:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	According to the hitachi site you can return the *drive* to the place of purchase under hitachi's warranty if not in one of the countries listed. http://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/support/warranty/
2012-01-20T09:10:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	Contact hitachi and tell them that the place you bought the drive from is refusing to accept it for a return.
2012-01-20T09:11:00.000Z	Zaukox	pnorman	IM NOT WARRANTY PROTECTED!
2012-01-20T09:11:00.000Z	pnorman	Zaukox	For the laptop? I'm not talking about the laptop warranty
2012-01-20T09:50:00.000Z	Zaukox	pnorman	ok, im rebotting to ubuntu to see if it works....
