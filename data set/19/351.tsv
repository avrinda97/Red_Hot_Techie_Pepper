2012-07-24T13:28:00.000Z	mang0	slackin__	Sure
2012-07-24T13:18:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	hey, which model?
2012-07-24T13:19:00.000Z	mang0	slackin__	Uh, Broadcom BCM4...fuu, ends with 306, hold on
2012-07-24T13:19:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	ok
2012-07-24T13:22:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	ahh, well, i have 4 different broadcom chipsets but none of them are a 4306, I've always had a couple issues, it sounds like maybe when you ran fw-cutter it didnt put the firmware in the right place to be loaded
2012-07-24T13:24:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	no
2012-07-24T13:24:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	well then

2012-07-24T13:25:00.000Z	mang0	slackin__	You mean shutdown, then boot up? Yeah done that too (this problem started yesterday, I turned it off overnight)
2012-07-24T13:26:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	ok, try the broadcom propetiary drivers maybe? they were always the sure thing when the FOSS drivers wouldnt work
2012-07-24T13:27:00.000Z	mang0	slackin__	And where do I get them from? The Broadcom site?
2012-07-24T13:28:00.000Z	slackin__	mang0	yea, google "bcm4306 broadcom linux"
