2004-11-10T17:39:00.000Z	afv-13		is it true that there is no root user?
2004-11-10T17:40:00.000Z	afv-13		interesting

2004-11-10T17:46:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	It caches your password for a bit.
2004-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	If the administrator's account is compromised, then you're screwed sudo or not.
2004-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Explain an attack on a system using sudo that doesn't apply anyway :)
2004-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Please explain why sudo is less secure than an alternative.
2004-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Then we can tell you why you're wrong, and hopefully you'll be convinced :)
2004-11-10T06:02:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Ok, if the user that's going to be the admin is running exploited software in their account, they've already lost.
2004-11-10T06:02:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Because it can then install keyloggers and the like in the users account to capture the password, including when they run good ol' "su".
2004-11-10T06:02:00.000Z	afv-13	spiv	in my setup, exploited software can ONLY take out my home dir
2004-11-10T06:03:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Not true.  They can grab passwords with key loggers... and getting ssh keys and gpg private keys could easily lead to more accounts on other boxes.
2004-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	Exploiting the account of an admin user is not significantly different to just getting root immediately, in terms of exposure.  As soon as that admin types "su -" into an xterm, the keylogger will have the root password.
2004-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	That's *why* sudo is a useful model.
2004-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	sudo makes it very easy to only run things as root when you need it, rather than being lazy and leaving root prompts around.
2004-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	afv-13	spiv	ok, lets forget about ketloggers for now
2004-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	spiv	afv-13	That's the exact same scenario.
