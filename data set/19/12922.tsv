2005-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	maxo_		ok I'm having a really weird problem - my computer keeps freezing up. I was on here a sec ago, and I had just asked a question about grub when it froze - could you tell me whether I disconnected at that point? (scroll up, it was about a minute ago)
2005-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	are you still on warty?
2005-06-14T15:37:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	no, the latest ubuntu, but I also have this problem on windows
2005-06-14T15:37:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	ah ok. That means a hardware problem
2005-06-14T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	you can test your memory with memtest86
2005-06-14T15:38:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	how do I do that?
2005-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	select memtest86 when booting
2005-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	ok. Also, how can I change the default grub boot entry?
2005-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	by editing /boot/grub/menu/lst
2005-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	I know, but I can't see which is the option
2005-06-14T15:40:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	the line starting with default
2005-06-14T15:50:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	always :)
2005-06-14T15:53:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	what does the umask thingy do?
2005-06-14T15:53:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	it lets you read it as normal user....
2005-06-14T15:55:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	ok this is strange, it still won't let me access it, and it won't let me umount it either, apparantely the device is busy. but fuser isn't showing up anything
2005-06-14T15:55:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	umount -f /dev/hda1
2005-06-14T15:56:00.000Z	maxo_	Seveas	yes, it still won't budge :-(
2005-06-14T15:56:00.000Z	Seveas	maxo_	lsof | grep /media/windows
