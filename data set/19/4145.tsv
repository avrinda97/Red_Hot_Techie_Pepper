2009-10-26T05:41:00.000Z	[-jon-]		what does the t in the permissions for /tmp signify?
2009-10-26T05:41:00.000Z	[-jon-]		the other group has permissions rwt
2009-10-26T05:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	sticky
2009-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	[-jon-]		any idea where i can find an explanation of that, lstarnes
2009-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	it means that anyone can delete or add files in there if they own them
2009-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	man chmod
2009-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	[-jon-]		if permissions are set to 777, does that mean anyone can delete them?
2009-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	[-jon-]		even if they dont own it?
2009-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	it means anyone may read, write, or execute
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	[-jon-]	lstarnes	but does that include deleting? =\
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	if the directory containing it is not using the sticky bit, anyone may delete it
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	if the sticky bit is there, only the owner may do that
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	[-jon-]		the owner of the file or the owner of the directory
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	normally, write includes delete
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	[-jon-]		or either
2009-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	file
2009-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	[-jon-]		ok, thanks a bunch
2009-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	er, both
2009-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	[-jon-]	you can learn about all of this from man chmod
