2007-06-03T15:04:00.000Z	lauriexxx		HELP  PLEASE !!!! I ve installed feisty for a friend, and after trying to install beryl, i can't get the graphic server working, just got a blank page... after long in, any ideas?
2007-06-03T15:06:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Was ubuntu working in the first place?
2007-06-03T15:08:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Ok, so, you had it working...installed beryl and then nothing?
2007-06-03T15:09:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Can you get to recovery console?
2007-06-03T15:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	And what is the error when trying to boot into gnome?
2007-06-03T15:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Also, how did you remove beryl?
2007-06-03T15:12:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	I think there is a way to get an x-log, during a start up, getting that might be a place to start...I mean, this is sort of beyond my scope, but I'd recommend getting some sort of log, to figure out what is going on...Also you might find more help in #beryl, since beryl caused the issue.
2007-06-03T15:14:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Is it a fresh install of ubuntu?
2007-06-03T15:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Either way, if it is, you could just install ubuntu again, fresh...otherwise, I imagine, and I might be wrong, and somebody can correct me, you should be able to remove ubuntu-desktop and apt-get it again. Someone will need to verify that though?
2007-06-03T15:16:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	I think trying to reinstall ubuntu-desktop might work...You can do it via the live CD most likely.
2007-06-03T15:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Yeah, but I imagine you want to know the name of the package first.
2007-06-03T15:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	The package for ubuntu desktop...is just ubuntu-desktop
2007-06-03T15:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	I don't really see how that could hurt. I mean, it's not going to mess up any of your data. Worst case, it doesn't work.
2007-06-03T15:25:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	On the remove or the get
2007-06-03T15:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	I'm not going to lie to you, this is start to be beyond my scope. . .But, what kind of errors?
2007-06-03T15:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	Try running the command w4ett just told Sillyz to run.
2007-06-03T15:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	lauriexxx	How did you break the aptlists using beryl?
