2011-09-04T00:11:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	did anyone tell you that it is a very bad idea ™ to irc as root?
2011-09-04T00:12:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	no, why
2011-09-04T00:13:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	what is bad with run irssi as root?
2011-09-04T00:14:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	the linux concept of user permissions is based on the fact that a normal user cannot do much harm to the system, running all programs as root invalidates that...
2011-09-04T00:14:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	btw what system are you running?
2011-09-04T00:15:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	yeah right, i just started irssi in my already opened term, and i forgot that i was logged as root ^
2011-09-04T00:16:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	lucid lynx, why?
2011-09-04T00:17:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	I asked because normally you don't run anything as root, you cannot login as root
2011-09-04T00:18:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	i can su to root in term..
2011-09-04T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	no, you cannot - on a standard ubuntu at least
2011-09-04T00:20:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	i just in stalled ubuntu 1 minute ago and you see.. it works ^^
2011-09-04T00:20:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	why you can´t do this usually?
2011-09-04T00:22:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	yeah i can use sudo or su root
2011-09-04T00:23:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	no, on a standard ubuntu you only can use sudo (sudo -s at most) - that prevents you from having a term running as root and exposing your system to the risk of you doing something foolish :-)
2011-09-04T00:24:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	sounds logic :)
2011-09-04T00:24:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	it will take time until i understand whole ubuntu ^^
2011-09-04T00:26:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	do take your time - but please don't work as root when you are not doing any administrative work in your system
2011-09-04T00:26:00.000Z	ttf1	guntbert	thanks and bye ..
2011-09-04T00:26:00.000Z	guntbert	ttf1	:)
