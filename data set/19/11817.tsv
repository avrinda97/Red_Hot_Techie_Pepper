2006-01-18T09:04:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	all Ubuntu packages are carefully selected to create a useable and intuitive desktop environment.
2006-01-18T09:04:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	if you want a minimal install, you have to enter 'server' at the first prompt.
2007-03-16T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	change it to something > 1024
2007-03-18T05:07:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	yourself: 'id'. Another user: 'sudo su - username -c id'
2007-03-18T05:07:00.000Z	Heroin	soundray	what does the su option do?
2007-03-18T05:08:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	runs a command with the privileges of another user
2007-05-19T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	sure, why not
2007-05-19T08:33:00.000Z	Heroin	soundray	how would i do that and do u have MSN or can i PM u?
2007-05-19T08:33:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	you should set up each client to mount /home from the fileserver, ie. via /etc/fstab
2007-05-19T08:34:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	check out the ubotu factoid (pm):
2007-05-19T08:34:00.000Z	Heroin	soundray	ok and the .wine .gnome etc.. are just profiles for those applications?
2007-05-19T08:34:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	yes
2007-05-19T08:34:00.000Z	Heroin	soundray	i know how fstab kinda works but i just need some more understanding on how it would work from a server
2007-05-19T08:35:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	you have to decide on a network filesystem. There are really only two contenders: nfs and smb.
2007-05-19T08:35:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	don't fall into the trap of installing samba on the clients. It's not necessary.
2007-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	all you need client-side is the smbfs package. samba is for the server.
2007-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	nfs is a bit trickier to set up, because you have to set up portmapper as well. But the wiki is quite good:
2007-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	Heroin	soundray	atm i have 4 computer in my room, 2 desktop system 1-1ghz system and 1 755Mhz. Iam thinking of converting the 755into a server but not sure which os.. 2k3 or linux. If i decide on using a windows server can i also mount those on my linux boxes as home dirs?
2007-05-19T08:38:00.000Z	soundray	Heroin	yes. Windows file sharing is typically done with the server message block protocol, recently renamed cifs (not sure what cifs abbreviates).
