2007-09-01T15:37:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	you can reboot to ubuntu, in grub choose recovery mode, then copy your backup xorg.conf over the new one, or else use sudo nano to edit it and fix it
2007-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	right, you can edit/restore the xorg.conf file from windows. let me find the extension you can use to read the ext3 partition from windows
2007-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	Ltar	dug_	thanks
2007-09-01T15:45:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	there are multiple options for reading/writing ext3 partitions from windows, i'm not sure which is best or most popular as I haven't used them: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=windows+xp+ext3&btnG=Google+Search
2007-09-01T15:47:00.000Z	Ltar	dug_	yeah, I found a lot of these on my own. I'll dick around a bit and get back to you guys later. thanks!
2007-09-01T15:47:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	this got good reviews for being simple to use: http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm
2007-09-01T15:48:00.000Z	Ltar	dug_	the site says it can read, can it write?
2007-09-01T15:48:00.000Z	Ltar	dug_	in order to restore my xorg.conf, i'll need r/w support
2007-09-01T15:49:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	yeah you're right, i was just reading that too, i'm checking out this one now: http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/ext2.html
2007-09-01T15:50:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	yeah the tool nickrud mentioned reads and writes to ext2 and ext3
2007-09-02T05:12:00.000Z	Ltar	dug_	what was the read-only ext3 browser you said got good reviews for being simple? I may have a use for it
2007-09-02T05:13:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	can't remember, but here's one: http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/  i'll look at logs to see the other one
2007-09-02T05:14:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	i guess xchat doesn't save logs by default, and i quit and restarted earlier, sorry
2007-09-02T05:15:00.000Z	dug_	Ltar	SlimeyPete says try explore2fs
