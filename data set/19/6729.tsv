2007-12-16T21:19:00.000Z	martine_		I need help troubleshooting an irresponsive nautilus
2007-12-16T21:19:00.000Z	martine_		nautilus frequently becomes totally irresponsive at random moments
2007-12-16T21:20:00.000Z	martine_		this is on a freshly installed 7.10 machine, with a homedir copied over from an older ubuntu version
2007-12-16T21:20:00.000Z	kitche	martine_	it could be due to the fact that the newrer nautilus does not understand the old format sicne config files can change sometimes
2007-12-16T21:21:00.000Z	martine_	kitche	exactly, so how do I find out more about that?
2007-12-16T21:21:00.000Z	martine_		I've already tried to move the old .nautilus out of the way
2007-12-16T21:22:00.000Z	martine_	kitche	any suggestions?
2007-12-16T21:23:00.000Z	kitche	martine_	nope since you did what I was going to suggest but I would move the .gnome folder to a backup and restart gnome or something as well
2007-12-16T21:24:00.000Z	martine_	kitche	.gnome contains evolution stuff as well
2007-12-16T21:24:00.000Z	martine_		(and .gnome2 too)
2007-12-16T21:25:00.000Z	kitche	martine_	yes that's ebcuase it's part of gnome and your point being?
2007-12-16T21:25:00.000Z	martine_	kitche	I'd rather be able to solve it in a different way if possible
2007-12-16T21:25:00.000Z	kitche	martine_	well then reinstall is your only real way then
2007-12-16T21:25:00.000Z	martine_	kitche	how would reinstall help me?
2007-12-16T21:25:00.000Z	kitche	martine_	or recompile nutilius
2007-12-16T21:26:00.000Z	martine_		this is a fresh install
2007-12-16T21:26:00.000Z	martine_		and recompiling nautilus?
2007-12-16T21:26:00.000Z	kitche	martine_	well not reall a fresh install if your using old config files
2007-12-16T21:26:00.000Z	martine_	kitche	I agree on that one
