2008-05-25T04:41:00.000Z	szx0		Whenever I use apt-get to try and install a package and that package fails for whatever reason.... Any subsequent apt-get calls to try and install anything else.... it always tries to install the first failed package.... any ideas?
2008-05-25T04:42:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	what does sudo apt-get update do?
2008-05-25T04:43:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	it just seems to go and grab the latest stuff as usual... why?
2008-05-25T04:43:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	making sure your repos are straight
2008-05-25T04:43:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	alright... well yeah that seems fine
2008-05-25T04:43:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	which package are you installing?
2008-05-25T04:44:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	ZoneMinder
2008-05-25T04:45:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	do you have any 3rd party repos added?
2008-05-25T04:45:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	nah.... ZoneMinder is part of the defaults
2008-05-25T04:46:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	im aware of this but im starting to think a 3rd party repo may be giving you the bad path
2008-05-25T04:47:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	hmm.. well I didn't add anything so can't be that
2008-05-25T04:47:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	which package is it failing on? seems to be installing for me so far
2008-05-25T04:49:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	Starting ZoneMinder: DBI connect('database=zm;host=localhost','zmuser',...) failed: Unknown database 'zm' at /usr/share/perl5/ZoneMinder/Config.pm line 89
2008-05-25T04:50:00.000Z	szx0	ish_nitti	doesn't seem to have setup mysql for me correctly
2008-05-25T04:50:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	lol you said you were getting an error from sudo apt-get install, not from running the app itself
2008-05-25T04:50:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	thats a whole diff story then
2008-05-25T04:52:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	give me a sec
2008-05-25T04:52:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	ok did you sudo apt-get install it or did you compile it from source?
2008-05-25T04:52:00.000Z	ish_nitti	szx0	when i apt-get it, it installs mysql for me
