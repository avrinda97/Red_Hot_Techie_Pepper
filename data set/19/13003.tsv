2006-06-10T09:45:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	-name '*.ogg' would be better - else it will find "frogg"
2006-06-10T09:46:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	also, "find ~ -type f -name '*.ogg'" is better still - otherwise it would find directories as well as files if you had any *.ogg dirs
2006-06-10T09:51:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	you really have directories called <something>.ogg?
2006-06-10T09:52:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	using '-type f' will only find files - it will miss out any symlinks to files.  you could "'!' -type d" if you just want to skip directories
2006-06-10T09:52:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	no, but i still get a bunch of dirs...wait they all have Permission denied appended to them. probably because i didn't run find with sudo?
2006-06-10T09:54:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	those are errors, not outputs.  you can throw the errors away if you want:  "find ~ -type f -name '*.ogg" 2> /dev/null
2006-06-10T09:54:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	why do you have directories inside your home which you can't open?
2006-06-10T09:55:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	i searched / because i wasn't finding anything useful in ~ :)
2006-06-10T09:55:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	if you want to search the whole disk, you'll find "locate" is a lot faster
2006-06-10T09:55:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	"locate" uses a database which is only refreshed once a day, so it will miss any files you've got since the last update (usually 6:30am I think)
2006-06-10T09:56:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	ah! locate, find and grep :scribbles a note to self:
2006-06-10T09:56:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	to refresh locate's database: "sudo updatedb"
2006-06-10T09:56:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	soit wouldn't've found this file, then.
2006-06-10T09:56:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	(since you've got the notepad out already)
2006-06-10T09:56:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	thanks this is all really helpful
2006-06-10T09:57:00.000Z	dooglus	nootrope	locate -r '[.] ogg$'
2006-06-10T09:57:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	gottcha
2006-06-10T10:02:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	univision.com (hah! it's in spanish!)
2006-06-10T10:04:00.000Z	nootrope	dooglus	hah!
