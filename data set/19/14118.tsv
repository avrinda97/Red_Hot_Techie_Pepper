2005-02-02T09:47:00.000Z	Zotnix		Ubuntu is very python orientated.
2005-02-02T09:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	Python is great
2005-02-28T07:09:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	read it... it was not a good review (it wasn't trying to be objective at all)
2005-02-28T07:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	yeah but it had some valid points like the color/naming schemes :D
2005-02-28T07:10:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	actually that is what I was referring to.
2005-02-28T07:11:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	one that could be changed very easily and one that doesn't have any bearing on whether the system is good or not.
2005-02-28T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	The person who wrote it was obviously a KDE user.
2005-02-28T07:13:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	yeah. It is a sad day when a desktop manager specific distro gets a bad review because it uses a certain desktop manager
2005-02-28T07:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	he seemed pretty happy once he added the universe repo tho :D
2005-03-17T06:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	the distro is only like 4 months old :D
2005-03-17T06:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	all those distro run like crap for me
2005-03-17T06:26:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	lot of bloat. Oddly once I disabled a lot on Mandrake it ran faster than most distros I've used.
2005-03-17T06:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	I started with Mandrake back in 2000 it was a real breath of fresh air coming from windows
2005-03-17T06:27:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	I loved Mandrake. I just didn't like the fact it didn't have more obscure packages.
2005-03-17T06:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	rpm's are poison that's why I switched to Debian
2005-03-17T06:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	that's because they coded urpmi in like ruby or something
2005-03-17T06:29:00.000Z	Zotnix	LinuxJones	both yum and urpmi liked to randomly freeze on me and take forever rebuilding indexes.
2005-03-17T06:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	yeah exactly
2005-03-17T06:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Zotnix	I don't know why they didn't adopt apt4rpm it's just stupid to re-invent the wheel, especially something as good as apt
