2009-02-26T19:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	it depends on the error
2009-02-26T19:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	I find that the commands are often faster
2009-02-26T19:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	what was the error message?
2009-02-26T19:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	does it say anything else?
2009-02-26T19:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	is mysql running?
2009-02-26T19:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	run ps aux | grep mysqld
2009-02-26T19:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	then mysqld isn't running.  Do you have mysql installed?
2009-02-26T19:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	try running sudo invoke-rc.d mysql start
2009-02-26T19:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	DarkKnight	you might want to try installing mysql-server-5.0 again
