2010-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	lyrae_		Ubuntu keeps suddenly freezing out of nowhere. it's getting quite frequent.
2010-05-23T10:48:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	check your logs to see what happens before/when it freezes
2010-05-23T10:48:00.000Z	lyrae_	a3ist	i am, but theres like 1000 log files haha. still checking
2010-05-23T10:49:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	you can filter them by date, as well as use the "tail" function to check the last X number of lines from a file.  Grep is good for filtering results to a specific date/time window as well.
2010-05-23T10:49:00.000Z	lyrae_	a3ist	using the log viewer
2010-05-23T10:50:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	learn some of the CLI stuff, it goes so much quicker and offers so much more finesse for finding the right entries
2010-05-23T10:50:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	especially with grep you can use the -A and -B options to pull in lines around (before and after) ones that match
2010-05-23T10:52:00.000Z	lyrae_	a3ist	yes i suspect its the gpu. its OLD and gets HOT
2010-05-23T10:53:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	have you cleaned it lately to make sure the fan isn't being clogged by dust?
2010-05-23T10:53:00.000Z	lyrae_	a3ist	yep. its just really old
2010-05-23T10:53:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	got any arctic silver around and feeling ambitious?  You could reseat the heatsink on your gpu for better heat conduction :)
2010-05-23T10:56:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	do you notice it freezing during specific functions or is it more or less random?  Is the computer on the same circuit in your home as other power hungry devices?  Air conditioners can cause big fluctuations in power.
2010-05-23T10:57:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	the biggest priority overall is finding the right logs for before it freezes.  If its software related, or the system logs hardware probs before freezing, it will show up there.  If there's nothing in the logs, it's most likely hardware alone.
2010-05-23T10:58:00.000Z	lyrae_	a3ist	dont think its software. couldnt find anything in the logs. at 01:44
2010-05-23T10:59:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	in that case trying a ghetto-cooling method like loshki mentioned might help.  try taking the side off the computer, make sure its not stuck in a tight cabinet, and possibly put a box or desk fan near it to help it disperse the ambient heat
2010-05-23T11:07:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	normally I'd recommend benchmarking software for stress testing but I'm not familiar with the linux options there
2010-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	for now yes
2010-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	lyrae_	a3ist	is it changing soon?
2010-05-23T11:24:00.000Z	a3ist	lyrae_	I think I've heard about a new bus but frankly I haven't been keeping up to date on the hardware side of things either lately
