2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		I'm trying to play Wolfenstein Enemy Territory but I have no sound. When I run it from a terminal I get the following error:
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		------- sound initialization -------
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		/dev/dsp: No such file or directory
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		Could not open /dev/dsp
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		------------------------------------
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		After some googeling I tried to instal oss-compat but that gives errors too:
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		FATAL: Module snd_seq_oss not found
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		FATAL: Module snd_mixer_oss not found
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		FATAL: Module snd_pcm_oss not found
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	Burmoz		I can play music, movies and other games fine, only Wolfenstein doesn't work. Can anyone help me with this?
2010-10-29T02:30:00.000Z	ironsight	Burmoz	sudo apt-get install alsa-oss then run the game like... aoss ./game
2010-10-29T02:31:00.000Z	ironsight	Burmoz	like if I wanted to play... newwolf... aoss /path/to/newwolf
2010-10-29T02:33:00.000Z	Burmoz	ironsight	"alsa-oss is already the newest version.", still no sound..
2010-10-29T02:34:00.000Z	ironsight	Burmoz	how do you usally launch the wolf client?
2010-10-29T02:34:00.000Z	Burmoz	ironsight	I just type et in the console
2010-10-29T02:35:00.000Z	Burmoz	ironsight	still nothing
2010-10-29T02:41:00.000Z	ironsight	Burmoz	I wonder if iowolfet is out yet...
2010-10-29T02:43:00.000Z	ironsight	Burmoz	keep an eye on http://ioquake3.org/2010/08/12/welcome-wolfenstein-enemy-territory-and-return-to-castle-wolfenstein/ since they are re-writing it with SDL sound
2010-10-29T02:44:00.000Z	Burmoz	ironsight	I hadn't heard of that yet, sounds like a good idea. Thanks for pointing it out.
