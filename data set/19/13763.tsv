2005-06-26T09:27:00.000Z	alex		sudo is something to make you run as root, apt-get is to install programs
2005-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	alex		tgz is just compressionm, right?
2005-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	alex		whoa
2005-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 tar.gz
2005-06-26T09:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2005-06-26T09:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 your current "external" ip is: 67.22.72.79
2005-06-26T09:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 internet-visible, not your lan-visble one
2005-06-26T09:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 lynx http://whatismyipaddress.com/ (seriously, heheheh)
2005-06-26T09:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 yeah, and lynx is my browser of choice, heh
2005-06-26T09:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 freenet oper
2005-06-26T09:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 freenODE oper
2005-06-26T09:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 could be either, probably the former i'd guess (but i don't know mac hw)
2005-06-26T09:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 one of those is transmit, one is receive
2005-06-26T09:51:00.000Z	alex	eyequeue	they both flash at the same time
2005-06-26T09:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 yeah, the granularity isn't up to real-time, there's a bit of fudge factor there
2005-06-26T09:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	alex	 download some huge file, you'll see the rx end overtake the tx end :)
