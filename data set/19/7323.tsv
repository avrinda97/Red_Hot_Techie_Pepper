2011-08-12T09:00:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	hibernate basically does a shutdown but remembers the systems state.
2011-08-12T09:02:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	basically stops the hard disks to conserve power.
2011-08-12T09:04:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	honestly its a machine that you have to run a lot (like my laptop I use almost 8 hours a day for work) just get a cooling station.  Otherwise just set your timeout options for like every 15 or 30 min of idle time
2011-08-12T09:06:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	its possible too that the hardware also isnt properly supported and if thats the case, its hell to work out.
2011-08-12T09:23:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	does the light at least turn off when you close the lid?
2011-08-12T09:25:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	if it works, it could over time hurt the filesystem
2011-08-12T09:25:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	by chance was this a windows install of ubuntu?
2011-08-12T09:26:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	okay
2011-08-12T09:26:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	i have that same problem with that and hibernate.  In my experience ive never seen a laptop properly support either, in my experiences.
2011-08-12T09:27:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	its really hard to say and to fix it goes pretty deep from what ive looked at
2011-08-12T09:28:00.000Z	mattgyver	jen	mine is like, half and half.  hibernate never works, but sleep sometimes does.
