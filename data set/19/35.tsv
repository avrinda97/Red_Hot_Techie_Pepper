2012-11-24T07:43:00.000Z	xDesu		so anyone have any info as how I can get skype working on quantal? x64
2012-11-24T07:44:00.000Z	xDesu		noone has info on getting skype working on quantal x64? it keeps whining about skype-bin being uninstallable.
2012-11-24T07:45:00.000Z	xDesu		Apparently it's not there..
2012-11-24T07:45:00.000Z	xDesu		yes, but then it depends on skype-bin which is nowhere to be found.
2012-11-24T07:45:00.000Z	xDesu		Yes.
2012-11-24T07:46:00.000Z	xDesu		Synaptic>repos>partner repo, BAM
