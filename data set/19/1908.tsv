2010-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	Moopz		Hey. I'm trying to install the grub2 themes from http://grub.gibibit.com/ but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to install them. Can anyone help?
2010-09-29T12:58:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	what exactly did you download ?
2010-09-29T13:03:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	Any clue on how to install it?
2010-09-29T13:03:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	hold on, I'm looking at it
2010-09-29T13:03:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	thanks :)
2010-09-29T13:08:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	if you're only looking for the themes, you should download the themes tarball : http://grub.gibibit.com/files/grub-themes-src-2008-08-15.tgz
2010-09-29T13:08:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	It contains an installation script
2010-09-29T13:09:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	but when I run the script, nothing really happens?
2010-09-29T13:11:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	I actually think they are installed now, but then I don't know how to chose which one it uses?
2010-09-29T13:11:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	do you have a themes folder in /boot/grub ?
2010-09-29T13:12:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	and it contains the themes winter, proto... ?
2010-09-29T13:13:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	yes.
2010-09-29T13:13:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	So it is installed, I know. But how to I select which one it should use?
2010-09-29T13:17:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	I'm not completely sure, you'd have to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom, but I prefer not to get further into this as I've never done that and I don't want to mess your grub installation
2010-09-29T13:18:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	try asking in #grub maybe
2010-09-29T13:18:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	Alright, I'll try that
2010-09-29T13:18:00.000Z	Moopz	glebihan	Thanks for your help
2010-09-29T13:18:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	you're welcome
2010-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	glebihan	Moopz	check if you've set "Show new distribution releases" to "normal releases" in software sources
