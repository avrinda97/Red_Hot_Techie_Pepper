2006-06-09T09:32:00.000Z	babo		how do I turn off iptables in ubuntu ?
2006-06-09T09:33:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 iptables isn't really on or off.
2006-06-09T09:33:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 you just adjust its rule set.
2006-06-09T09:33:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	you can turn it off on RH ...
2006-06-09T09:33:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 what is your issue currently:
2006-06-09T09:33:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	I want to suspend my firewall ...
2006-06-09T09:35:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 you can add firestarter which lets you use a gui to access iptables quickly.
2006-06-09T09:35:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	why would I need firestarter ?
2006-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 because it is a point and click way of accessing iptables if you aren't comfortable with the cli for iptables.
2006-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	I am comfortable with the cli, it's just that have a default script is easier ...
2006-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 well there isn't an init.d script for iptables in ubuntu :)
2006-06-09T09:52:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 unless someone has written a bad skript.
2006-06-09T09:52:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	hmm ...
2006-06-09T09:51:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 it shoudl be supressed.
2006-06-09T09:52:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	it's just a default install ... I'm still setting things up ...
2006-06-09T09:52:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 if it echoes to the screen, it isn't responding correctly.
2006-06-09T09:52:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 most of the time it shoudl be masked in some form.  shouldnt just show up.
2006-06-09T09:58:00.000Z	babo	troy_s	turns out that it's an emacs thing ...
2006-06-09T09:58:00.000Z	troy_s	babo	 ahh.  interesting.
