2011-11-19T16:11:00.000Z	Multbrelch		Question: I have Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop and no other OS. Is it easy to install a second 11.10 on some empty partition? What about grub? has somebody some experiences
2011-11-19T16:13:00.000Z	Multbrelch		Thanks all. The reason is. Somebody will obtain an Ubuntu installation from me. The person has no idea about computers. The second OS would be an emergency system ...
2011-11-19T16:14:00.000Z	Multbrelch		dr_gonzo, ah sounds interesting
2011-11-19T16:15:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	dr_willis, another option si sto install the bootloader of the second system in its own partition and not the disk mbr, that way you are chaining the bootloaders
2011-11-19T16:16:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	true ...
2011-11-19T16:18:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	well this is done like this via phone. I would even print out a photo which shows grub and what the person needs to do in an emergency case
2011-11-19T16:19:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	what is nx?
2011-11-19T16:19:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	the key is not to share /boot folder or the initramfs are going to be overwritten
2011-11-19T16:20:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	you can use freenx or the closed source nx, i never used freenx but used the nx thing and it is so nice
2011-11-19T16:23:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	i suggest you to, install the rescue system in its own partition, all, but maybe set a swap for it if the user use the main for hibernation
2011-11-19T16:23:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	then install the grub in its partition and not the mbr
2011-11-19T16:23:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	I will think about it
2011-11-19T16:23:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	for remote assitance you are going to like openssh server there too, and also teamviewer and nx
2011-11-19T16:24:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	I would install the whole bunch of software
2011-11-19T16:24:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	don't share the /boot between both installs, because you are going to overwrite the initramfs of one wirth the other breaking the purpose of the rescue system or making the main unbootable
2011-11-19T16:25:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	theadmin and dr_willis , thanks for comments !!!
2011-11-19T16:25:00.000Z	cablop	Multbrelch	nx and openssh server doesn t come by default
2011-11-19T16:25:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	okay
2011-11-19T16:26:00.000Z	Multbrelch	cablop	I just copy and pasted your comments into some file :-)
