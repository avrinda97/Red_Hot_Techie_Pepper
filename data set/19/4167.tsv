2011-01-13T04:38:00.000Z	ocean		does any one know if ubuntu supports hybrid graphics card?
2011-01-13T04:38:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	depends on the hybrid form i think
2011-01-13T04:39:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	i am usinga hp dv-6 3150sa laptop which uses ATI mobilty readon HD 5470 graphics9switchable with intel HD GMA). after partitioning i could install ubuntu 10.10 without any problems.
2011-01-13T04:39:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	but ATi is not working
2011-01-13T04:40:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	its using the intel gpu?
2011-01-13T04:42:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	i tried switcheroo programe. when i choose the low perfomance the active card is the intel one and compiz works but when i switch to high perfomance the compiz disappears. i tried installing the ati driver from the website but no joy
2011-01-13T04:43:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	you have to restart x when you switch gpus
2011-01-13T04:44:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	i am not a skilled user, could u explain me what x is pls. when i switch the graphics it automatically logs me out and i have to login again.is that enough or ?
2011-01-13T04:44:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	yeah
2011-01-13T04:45:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	did you activate the hardware drivers for ati? under system
2011-01-13T04:46:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	that was the first job i did.installing fglrx and on reboot GUI disappeared and it took me to command mode.i had to reinstall ubuntu
2011-01-13T04:48:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	k
2011-01-13T04:49:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	x is the graphical environment. if the hardware drivers crash on boot best to leave them and try again when ubuntu 11.04 comes out.
2011-01-13T04:50:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	thanks. i had a detailed googling on this issue, so far i couldnt figure out a decent article about linux support of hybrid graphics
2011-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	its still rather poor atm
2011-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	i expect it to be somewhat improved in 11.04 though
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	i can see that discussions abt hybrid graphics support started way bak in december 2009!
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	acicula	ocean	you could try disabling one of the gpus in the bios and see if it gets better that way
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	ocean	acicula	disappointing thing is that the bio doesnt support graphic selection
