2009-01-01T17:17:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix		hi all i have the same problem as last night: after an install i need internet which i get through a little usb thing that i plug in for wifi...ubuntu cant find it...it needs a driver...ive tried ndiswrapper but its not working...anyone out there know what to do?
2009-01-01T17:18:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	what version of ubuntu?
2009-01-01T17:18:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	8.10...i can downgrade to LTS if that is needed
2009-01-01T17:19:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	goto System | Administration | Hardware Drivers and see if your wireless driver is in there
2009-01-01T17:20:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	its not...just my ATI driver...but i dont think ubuntu would be able to get it anyway since im offline
2009-01-01T17:21:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	nothing is in there?
2009-01-01T17:21:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	just my ATI card driver
2009-01-01T17:26:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	what kind of card is it?
2009-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	dynex N USB Adapter
2009-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	and  you've been here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2009-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	ill try that site someone pointed me to a different similar one
2009-01-01T17:38:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	you on a laptop or desktop?
2009-01-01T17:38:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	typing this laptop problem on desktop
2009-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	then installing a PCI wifi card is pretty straight forward and easy
2009-01-01T17:48:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	goto a terminal on the desktop and type lsusb and see what chipset is in that usb dongle
2009-01-01T17:49:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	mini pci's are for laptops
2009-01-01T17:51:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	lsusb lists a lot of stuff from linux foundation...but i dont see much of anything else
2009-01-01T17:52:00.000Z	mrwes	jimi_hendrix	try lsusb | grep dynex
2009-01-01T17:52:00.000Z	jimi_hendrix	mrwes	nothing
