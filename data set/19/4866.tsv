2008-11-20T03:53:00.000Z	_steve_		but I don't recall how to install it on Intrepid
2008-11-20T03:53:00.000Z	_steve_		please remind me
2008-11-20T03:53:00.000Z	_steve_		it's a tar.gz
2008-11-20T03:54:00.000Z	_steve_		I'll leave you alone as soon as I can get my webcam stuff installed correctly
2008-11-20T03:56:00.000Z	_steve_		when someone tries to MSN and with Skype, it doesn't work
2008-11-20T03:56:00.000Z	_steve_		In msn, the person using Windows gets back a refusal from me (I don't refuse anything from these people
2008-11-20T03:57:00.000Z	_steve_		and Skype doesn't accept my webcam
2008-11-20T03:57:00.000Z	_steve_		something about audio capture
2008-11-20T03:58:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	try running skype in shell, look at the dump, and see if there's anything not installed
2008-11-20T03:59:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	it's more self explanatory that you probably think
2008-11-20T04:01:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	the difficulty is when the stack dump doesn't tell you you're missing a file
2008-11-20T04:01:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	ah. sorry. forgot to explain. to get an operational dump you need to launch a program in a terminal
2008-11-20T04:02:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	to launch type the program name in terminal
2008-11-20T04:06:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	what was the input/output error - with what program?
2008-11-20T04:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	but what was the program the input/output error was referring to (in that dump line)
2008-11-20T04:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	ah k
2008-11-20T04:08:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	shoot that line into google and see what it comes up with. I'm guessing alsa needs a specific program to run. i'd help you out here but i'm downloading big files and my internet is extremely laggy
2008-11-20T04:10:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	many of my errors I happen to fix from google. Half the time it's just a small little change you need to work out
2008-11-20T04:10:00.000Z	Tyrath	_steve_	also try ubuntu forums
