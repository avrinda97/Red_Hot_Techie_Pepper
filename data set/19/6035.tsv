2008-03-26T02:13:00.000Z	artenius2		I've switched monitors and everything was fine until I rebooted, I managed to get the resolution mostly sorted but some things still don't work, when I open a terminal, it's just a white window. How can I re-autodetect my settings so ubuntu recognizes this monitor and things get back to normal?
2008-03-26T02:15:00.000Z	artenius2		!resolution
2008-03-26T02:17:00.000Z	artenius2		when I open the terminal under accessories, it's just a blank white window, is there another way I can get in a terminal without rebooting into safe mode?
2008-03-26T02:17:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	that is a terminal.
2008-03-26T02:18:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	I know, but I can't really do anything in it when it's a blank white window
2008-03-26T02:48:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	you mean as in, you want the old setup back? You can always try to do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ... though it might not fix your problem. Do you have emerald installed?
2008-03-26T02:49:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	I don't know for sure. I was running gnome and compiz-fusion, switching monitors is what caused all this. When I rebooted my resolution was horribe and I had a new login screen. I managed to get the resolution sorted but things still don't look right.

2008-03-26T02:53:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	I think I see part of the problem already
2008-03-26T02:54:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	alright... you can also try to add 2 things under device: Option "AddARGBVisuals" "True" and Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
2008-03-26T02:55:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	you should also see if, when you run emerald by hand, it makes  a change.
2008-03-26T02:57:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	I added those lines to device
2008-03-26T02:58:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	then restart x to see if it made a diff
2008-03-26T03:01:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	I think that may have fixed it
2008-03-26T03:02:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	great to hear
2008-03-26T03:02:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	I got some weird error when I restarted, about the gnome daemon,  it said it would fix it when I restarted x again, so I did. and I got no error
2008-03-26T03:03:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	great news :-)
2008-03-26T03:03:00.000Z	artenius2	hischild	thanks a lot ;)
2008-03-26T03:04:00.000Z	hischild	artenius2	you're welcome
