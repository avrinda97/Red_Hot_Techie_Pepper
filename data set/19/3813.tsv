2011-08-27T09:24:00.000Z	bfig		my mouse has randomly stopped working twice today. what could be going wrong?
2011-08-27T09:25:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	what brand and model is it usb?
2011-08-27T09:30:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	what should i look for in the dmesg?
2011-08-27T09:33:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	i have no idea what a ring buffer is :(. i tried grepping 'touchpad' and some other variants but got nothing :(
2011-08-27T09:34:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	ok, i found it, now hwo do i interpret what's there?
2011-08-27T09:36:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	lol. how do i copy from the terminal? :|
2011-08-27T09:38:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	what about if mouse is not working? :|
2011-08-27T09:40:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	if you find it tell me please
2011-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	after great effort: http://pastebin.com/gCXSRide
2011-08-27T09:46:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	a possibly important thing: i was working with libreoffice calc and a very memory demanding spreadsheet. i have 3gb ram and an underpowered e-350
2011-08-27T09:52:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	you have restarted the machine right?
2011-08-27T09:53:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	nope. if i restart it the problem goes away for a second, but it will most likely come back (already hapened a couple times as i told you before)
2011-08-27T09:54:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	I think that ir most likely is a faulty touchpad
2011-08-27T09:55:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	do you have a spare usb mouse?
2011-08-27T09:55:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	if only the usbs were working right....
2011-08-27T09:55:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	i'll have to drive this piece of garbage to service. hopefully i'll get it fixed (or replaced). thankfully the hdd is intact :)
2011-08-27T09:56:00.000Z	bfig	notlistening	thanks for helping me understand the problem. good bye
2011-08-27T09:56:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	it is quite old..?
2011-08-27T09:58:00.000Z	notlistening	bfig	your welcome
