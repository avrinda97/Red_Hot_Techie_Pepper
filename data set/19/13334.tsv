2005-06-15T12:52:00.000Z	jmullman		strange things
2005-06-15T12:52:00.000Z	jmullman		how did you fix it then, I'd like it for personal edification
2005-06-15T12:54:00.000Z	jmullman		lol
2005-06-15T12:56:00.000Z	jmullman		yeah, thing is, I've been using Fedora a lot, so I've got yum on the brain right now
2005-06-15T12:56:00.000Z	jmullman		what's the ?
2005-06-15T12:57:00.000Z	jmullman		ya
2005-06-15T12:58:00.000Z	jmullman		I'd try, just for fun, commenting out the new repositories and going with the default
2005-06-15T12:58:00.000Z	jmullman		if that doesn't work, then it could possibly be either an dpkg db problem or a package maintainer's fault
2005-06-15T12:59:00.000Z	jmullman		the thrid is the least likely though
2005-06-15T12:59:00.000Z	jmullman		#osx
2005-06-15T12:59:00.000Z	samuel	jmullman	and very lively that is
2005-06-15T12:59:00.000Z	jmullman	samuel	in that case, no, not really.. although there are a lot of chatters about in #webkit
2005-06-15T13:00:00.000Z	jmullman		syntax: I'd eyeball one of the repos you added then
2005-06-15T13:00:00.000Z	jmullman		remove them one by one till you get the results your looking for
2005-06-15T13:00:00.000Z	samuel	jmullman	thanks - i thought osx was easy to configure! im finding it harder than slackware
2005-06-15T13:00:00.000Z	jmullman	samuel	what is it you are having a problem with?
2005-06-15T13:01:00.000Z	jmullman		and yes, slack is the bomb
2005-06-15T13:01:00.000Z	samuel	jmullman	cant print, ive a cups printer in a debian machine, and another debian can print to it just fine, but the osx machine cant
2005-06-15T13:02:00.000Z	jmullman	samuel	I've had that before... can't remember what I did to fix it lol been a long time
