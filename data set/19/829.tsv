2011-10-30T16:02:00.000Z	prophet		damn, has apple bought canonical or the ubuntu ui guys just copy osx hoping that apple "knows what is doing". from an UI perspective the new unity is a major usability/productivity drawback
2011-10-30T16:02:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	old news
2011-10-30T16:03:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	old news? meaning what exactly?
2011-10-30T16:03:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	unitys been out for ages
2011-10-30T16:04:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	ok, i'm talking about all this buttons-on-the-left and dock-style launcher in ubuntu
2011-10-30T16:04:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	yeah, gnome shell is the same. you could try kde, xfce, lxde or whatever theyre "normal"
2011-10-30T16:05:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	gnome has a fallback mode that has 2 plain panels like gnome2
2011-10-30T16:08:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	normal is when you do what you need to do in the fastest way
2011-10-30T16:08:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	yeah.. if you like using the mouse try openbox maybe its very fast. you just right click for a custom list of programs to open
2011-10-30T16:09:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	having to click panels then the programs is 10x slower
2011-10-30T16:11:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	theyre all going the same way
2011-10-30T16:12:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	all but windows
2011-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	open box looks good
2011-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	try it
2011-10-30T16:15:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	right now i preffer linux mint but it have its problems (specially when installing in a multiboot pc - osx + win7). does ubuntu install allows puting grub on the / partition?
2011-10-30T16:16:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	no it has to be on the disk itself at the very first bit
2011-10-30T16:16:00.000Z	prophet	Gentoo64	it's not mandatory, it can be on the root partition when having another bootloader
2011-10-30T16:17:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	you cant put grun on / partition
2011-10-30T16:18:00.000Z	Gentoo64	prophet	i think grub2 can boot osx
