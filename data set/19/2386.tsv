2010-12-19T06:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	what error do you get on boot?
2010-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	forestbear	greezmunkey	"ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxx doesn't exist!"
2010-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	you should be able to run sudo blkid to see the uuids available
2010-12-19T07:02:00.000Z	forestbear	greezmunkey	the uuids are correct
2010-12-19T07:07:00.000Z	forestbear	greezmunkey	using the kubuntu startup editor thing (though I use ubuntu, not kubuntu)
2010-12-19T07:11:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	look in /etc/default/grub are there any backup grub files evident?
2010-12-19T07:15:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	did you see Jordan_U's response about /boot/grub/grub.cfg ? Look in /boot/grub to see if there is a backup file.
2010-12-19T07:17:00.000Z	forestbear	greezmunkey	jordan_u: I have a backup, seems quite old though, from when I updated from 9.04
2010-12-19T07:17:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	yeah, I would tell you to use that one.
2010-12-19T07:17:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	I meant to type not use that one!!!
2010-12-19T07:17:00.000Z	forestbear	greezmunkey	okay I'll try it
2010-12-19T07:18:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	no!

2010-12-19T07:19:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	so, there is a grub.cfg file present?
2010-12-19T07:20:00.000Z	forestbear	greezmunkey	nope, in /boot/grub there is no grub.cfg file
2010-12-19T07:21:00.000Z	greezmunkey	forestbear	booting my buntu box now.
