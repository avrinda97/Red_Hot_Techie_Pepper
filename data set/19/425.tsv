2012-04-27T07:03:00.000Z	sinedeviance		okay so ubuntu still sucks (thanks unity.)
2012-04-27T07:03:00.000Z	sinedeviance		kubutnu time.
2012-04-27T07:03:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	hua
2012-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	how is it sucking
2012-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	its responsiv and snappy for me
2012-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	unity sucks (still) and so does gnome-classic (there's not even a system tray ffs!)
2012-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	lo,l you just have to turn it on
2012-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	install the app called myunity
2012-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	i have to install this on 25 machines. i dont have time to do post-config, frankly, i shouldn't need to for a "world class operating system"
2012-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	fair point i xubuntu or lubuntu for you
2012-04-27T07:06:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	i turned unity off. how would myunity help?
2012-04-27T07:07:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	myunity can change how unity works turn on desktop icons menubars and so on
2012-04-27T07:07:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	tweak it to your likeing
2012-04-27T07:08:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	i'll try that then, thanks
2012-04-27T07:10:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	some atoms (mainly the ones after the first couple years) were 64-bit
2012-04-27T07:24:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	myunity helps but it doesn't really do what i want (which is a system that is more like gnome 2.x)
2012-04-27T07:25:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	you will probly like xfce in that case
2012-04-27T07:25:00.000Z	gogeta	sinedeviance	or xubuntu
2012-04-27T07:25:00.000Z	sinedeviance	gogeta	i've been using xubuntu for years. i said that just 30 lines ago. i already know everything about it.
