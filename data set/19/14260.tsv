2004-10-11T14:58:00.000Z	joem		lshal |grep foo isn't so bad
2004-10-11T14:58:00.000Z	pitti	joem	that's what I meant :-) Easier than trying to do a screenshot of everything
2004-10-11T15:17:00.000Z	joem	pitti	if I don't have an fstab entry for a device, you guys use pmount to create a mount point in /media correct?
2004-10-11T15:18:00.000Z	pitti	joem	yes
2004-10-11T15:18:00.000Z	pitti	joem	this seems much more safe and sensible to us than fiddling around with fstab
2004-10-11T15:18:00.000Z	pitti	joem	the CD-ROM entries should be created by the installer
2004-10-11T15:19:00.000Z	joem	pitti	I had some ide trouble, and didn't fix it until after install
2004-10-11T15:19:00.000Z	pitti	joem	our current policy does not allow to pmount IDE devices (security reasons)
2004-10-11T15:19:00.000Z	pitti	joem	hmm, then I guess you have to do that manually for now
2004-10-17T05:11:00.000Z	joem	pitti	do you do hal/gvm stuff?
2004-10-17T05:11:00.000Z	pitti	joem	yes, I do
2004-10-17T05:11:00.000Z	pitti	joem	of course :-)
2004-10-17T05:13:00.000Z	pitti	joem	hmm. Can you please do "pidof gnome-volume-manager" and see whether it outputs anything?
2004-10-17T05:14:00.000Z	pitti	joem	okay, then it's running. is your CD-ROM in /etc/fstab?
2004-10-17T05:14:00.000Z	pitti	joem	internal CD-ROMs should be set up automatically during installation
2004-10-17T05:14:00.000Z	pitti	joem	or is this a hotpluggable USB CD-ROM?
2004-10-17T05:15:00.000Z	pitti	joem	hmm, that's odd. Did you modify anything in fstab?
2004-10-17T05:15:00.000Z	pitti	joem	can you see the cd-rom in "Disks"?
2004-10-17T05:16:00.000Z	pitti	joem	ah, I've got an idea. Can you please /msg me the contents of /etc/fstab (only the CD-ROM lines)
