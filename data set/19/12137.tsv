2012-08-27T03:24:00.000Z	hector		how do I check if my graphics card is running a Nouveau driver or a proprietary one?
2012-08-27T03:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	 try running the nvidia-settings tool
2012-08-27T03:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	 you got one of those dual video card laptops?
2012-08-27T03:33:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	i don`t know m8, it have an onboard and a dedicated one
2012-08-27T03:35:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	are you sure this uses optimus technology? the site i bought the laptop says nothing about it
2012-08-27T03:55:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	earlier i had a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 and then i had installed the x-swat nvidia-current. after doing that my resolution was stuck at 640x480 and when i tried to open nvidia-settings it gave me an error telling me to use a command called nvidia xorg-settings or something as root, i did but the error was still there.
2012-08-27T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	  the intel-nvidia card needs bumblebee to work properly from what i am reading...
2012-08-27T03:57:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	but we are not sure if my nvidia have optimus like we think
2012-08-27T03:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	 only time ive seen intel+nvidia on a laptop  mentioned here in the last year+ is with relateion to Bulblebee
2012-08-27T03:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	 the install guides give the exact commands and order.
2012-08-27T03:58:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	so what do u think about doing what i mentioned above?
2012-08-27T03:59:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	gotta try.. time to fail again lol xD
2012-08-27T04:01:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	i`m a bit confused not sure if you can answer to this but.. i have a fresh ubuntu install, havent installed anything from nvidia. the only thing i need to install now is bumblebee then?
2012-08-27T04:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	 the install guides give like 4 commands to run to install the needed stuff.
2012-08-27T04:24:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	ok, i`m getting started right now. added the x-swat ppa and the bumblebee one, but there`s nothing on the steps about installing the nvidia drivers before bumblebee, it just tells me to add the ppa.. should i install it or not?
2012-08-27T04:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hector	 I tInstall Bumblebee using the proprietary nvidia driver:
2012-08-27T04:27:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	i think you`re right according to arch wiki.
2012-08-27T04:28:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	In order to avoid installing nvidia-utils as a dependency when installing the nvidia driver, you have to install the nvidia-bumblebee package from the AUR instead (which is the same driver packaged for bumblebee usage).
2012-08-27T04:40:00.000Z	hector	Dr_Willis	just an info.. nvidia-current is a dependency as it is downloading it now hehe
