2009-06-20T08:13:00.000Z	rwlove_		just read up in the history
2009-06-20T08:15:00.000Z	rwlove_		I have a pretty technical question about my SSD not showing up in the jaunty installer... is this the right channel, or is there a more low level one?
2009-06-20T08:17:00.000Z	n2diy	rwlove_	I don't know what an SSD is, but there is always #ubuntu-kernel?
2009-06-20T08:17:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	oh cool... that's probably what I'm looking for
2009-06-20T08:17:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	SSD == Solid State Drive
2009-06-20T08:18:00.000Z	n2diy	rwlove_	duh, thanks.
2009-06-20T08:18:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	unfortunately only one person in ubuntu-kernel
2009-06-20T08:19:00.000Z	n2diy	rwlove_	just you!?
2009-06-20T08:19:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	no one other guy, must be the room moderator and is likely AFK
2009-06-20T08:19:00.000Z	n2diy	rwlove_	did I spell kernel correctly?
2009-06-20T08:19:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	yes!
2009-06-20T08:21:00.000Z	n2diy	rwlove_	I have 108 users in #ubuntu-kernel!
2009-06-20T08:21:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	oh, I clicked on your link
2009-06-20T08:22:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	what server are you on?
2009-06-20T08:22:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	when I click your link I go to a room with only me in it
2009-06-20T08:23:00.000Z	n2diy	rwlove_	ubuntu's servers, I joined #ubuntu-kernel, and have 68 users there.
2009-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	lol I have no idea what I'm doing wrong... on FreeNode I found a channel with like 80 members
2009-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	but on ubuntu server I can't seem to go to the right room
2009-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	rwlove_	n2diy	dunno what happened but I'm in the room now
