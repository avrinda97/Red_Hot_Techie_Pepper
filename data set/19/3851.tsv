2009-05-21T22:13:00.000Z	byerley		Hi, I'm trying to install unbound on a Ubuntu 8.04.2 box. It doesn't seem to be in the apt-get repositories. I tried install from source, but when I run it I get "[1242925358] unbound[14630:0] fatal error: user 'unbound' does not exist." I'm reluctant to just add a user manually. Any suggestions?
2009-05-21T22:13:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	add a user manually
2009-05-21T22:14:00.000Z	byerley	ejv	have you done the install before?
2009-05-21T22:17:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	what is 8.04? feisty?
2009-05-21T22:17:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	hardy?
2009-05-21T22:17:00.000Z	byerley	ejv	hardy yes
2009-05-21T22:18:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	well just because a package isn't committed to a repo, doesn't mean it's not floating around, one second :)
2009-05-21T22:20:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unbound ?
2009-05-21T22:22:00.000Z	byerley	ejv	how would I use that?
2009-05-21T22:24:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	well basically, it wouldn't be a terrible idea to upgrade your system if at all possible, but hardy is supported, so you'd download the .tar.gz file, do a tar xvfz unbound.....tar.gz, ./configure, make, make install
2009-05-21T22:25:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/hardy/+source/unbound/1.0.2-1.2ubuntu1~hardy2/+files/unbound_1.0.2.orig.tar.gz
2009-05-21T22:26:00.000Z	byerley	ejv	I've already done the manual install with the tarball at http://www.unbound.net/download.html do you think there'd be a difference?
2009-05-21T22:26:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	oh! hmm... I tend to trust sources prepared by ubuntu over the developers... lol, let me look
2009-05-21T22:28:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	yes you would encounter a difference, they are different version sources, only jaunty via launchpad supports the latest and greatest "unbound" make sense? :P
2009-05-21T22:29:00.000Z	byerley	ejv	seems to, thanks
2009-05-21T22:29:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	if you choose to use the latest source, you have to hack away at any problems yourself, generally packages prepared by ubuntu do all there own checks so you don't have to use so much elbow grease
2009-05-21T22:29:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	if upgrading to jaunty is an option, I say schedule it! ;)
2009-05-21T22:30:00.000Z	byerley	ejv	not the sysadmin for this box, don't really want to step on his toes heh
2009-05-21T22:30:00.000Z	ejv	byerley	well let me know how 1.02-1.2ubuntu1~hardy2 works out
