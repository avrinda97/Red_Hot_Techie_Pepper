2012-10-09T05:52:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		Aww, I put install,
2012-10-09T05:52:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		dang it.
2012-10-09T05:54:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		I am at a screen that gives me th options to install ubuntu alongside them, erase disc and install ubuntu or something else..Sine my hard drive is partitioned for a triboot. and i am just wanting to erase everything else is it going to completely alter the entire hard drive?
2012-10-09T05:55:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		so i would need to repartition theHD?
2012-10-09T05:56:00.000Z	jagginess	DeucesWildCatch2	if you choose erase, it will wipe out any existing partitions
2012-10-09T05:56:00.000Z	jagginess	DeucesWildCatch2	"something else" allows you to do "manual" partitioning and is the safest way to do it if you want to keep existing partitions
2012-10-09T05:56:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		Canukian, as this was given to me, I am ok with that, i was just hoping to delete everything that was done in Ubuntu without having to repartition the drive.. if that is what i need to do than I can work with that.

2012-10-09T05:57:00.000Z	jagginess	DeucesWildCatch2	ubuntu's option "something else" allows you to do manual partitioning.
2012-10-09T05:57:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2	jagginess	i can completely wipe out documents and pictures that were used on the ubuntu os partition?
2012-10-09T05:57:00.000Z	jagginess	DeucesWildCatch2	i think you missed the 'upgrade' option, ubuntu is able to upgrade itself from cd, if you already have ubuntu installed
2012-10-09T05:58:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		my sidter gave me this and it was given to her b her ex. i just found out it has open VPN.. so, i guess i will just wipe it and repartition it.
2012-10-09T05:58:00.000Z	jagginess	DeucesWildCatch2	you can wipe out everything, but there's a more convenient tool for doing this, it's gparted live cd (from sourceforge)
2012-10-09T05:58:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		oh alright I am sitting up now, I am so sorry for the typos
2012-10-09T05:59:00.000Z	DeucesWildCatch2		sourceforge.

2012-10-09T06:00:00.000Z	jagginess	DeucesWildCatch2	if you want a dualboot, you should install windows first,, the ubuntu install can automatically add a windows menu item to it's boot loader
