2010-04-11T16:02:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	i had the exact problem what fixed it for me was
2010-04-11T16:03:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	I plugged my laptop in DIRECTLY to the modem with the ethernet cord, after that everything worked perfect, I think it downloads via internet while installing I thought it could through wifi but using direct plugin fixed it
2010-04-11T16:04:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	I know I have windows 7 too, i can dual boot into win7 and ubuntu
2010-04-11T16:05:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	yes I know, i had the same problem
2010-04-11T16:05:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	like i said, plug your laptop into the internet through a cord and not wifi, then do the install
2010-04-11T16:07:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	My disk was the same size, all im telling you is this. Plug your laptop in with the cord and trust me. It will work.
2010-04-11T16:08:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	I'm telling you the fix, why don't you do as I said lol.
2010-04-11T16:09:00.000Z	banshee_	ichigo	yes, put the cd in, plug your internet cord in, and restart your computer and do the installation
