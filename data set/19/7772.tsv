2009-02-18T21:41:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	sets the level of question you want to be bothered with
2009-02-18T21:41:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	-plow on most packages will harass you with various inane questions, -phigh only checks the most critical questions and uses the defaults for everything else
2009-02-18T21:42:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	for xserver-xorg, -phigh is appropriate for the majority of cases
2009-02-18T21:42:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	ahh, I've seen it before. seen it before never looked at the man for the flag.
2009-02-18T21:42:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	a dpkg-reconfigure -a -plow will have you answering questions for hours, literally
2009-02-18T21:43:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	I'm tempted to try it now just to see how inane they are.
2009-02-18T21:43:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	do it in a vm
2009-02-18T21:43:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	it's a good learning experience though
2009-02-18T21:44:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	Current project is LFS
2009-02-18T21:44:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	not in the bad sense, you'll gain an appreciation for how much stuff it can do
2009-02-18T21:44:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	linux from scratch
2009-02-18T21:45:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	I've learned the beauty of vm's to play around with linux. I'm a terrible kernel killer.
2009-02-18T21:46:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	kde has had a graphical xorg configurator for a while now
2009-02-18T21:46:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	linux from scratch you literally compile all of linux from source starting with the kernel and building your own distro from the ground up.
2009-02-18T21:46:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	I use gnome. kde seems heavy to me.=
2009-02-18T21:46:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	I know what it is, I just didn't recognize the acronym
2009-02-18T21:46:00.000Z	loki0347	cwillu	ahh sorry.
2009-02-18T21:47:00.000Z	cwillu	loki0347	just saying, now you know of one :p
