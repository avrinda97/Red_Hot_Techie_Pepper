2006-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	AnAnt		can anyone help me in Ubuntu installation ?
2006-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	Managu	AnAnt	quite possibly, and maybe not.  But you're better off asking your question, instead of asking to ask your question =p
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	I setup the base system
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	now I want to continue the setup procedure, so how ?
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	Managu	AnAnt	once the base system is setup, the machine should reboot; did it?
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	yup
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	and I got a login prompt
2006-04-28T10:17:00.000Z	Managu	AnAnt	text or nice graphics?
2006-04-28T10:17:00.000Z	Managu	AnAnt	black background?
2006-04-28T10:17:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	yup, virtual console
2006-04-28T10:18:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	so ?
2006-04-28T10:18:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	yup
2006-04-28T10:19:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	here's what I done, I used a USB boot image on a USB disk, then installed via LOCAL network
2006-04-28T10:19:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	that is, I had a Ubuntu DVD mounted on another machine & installed via FTP
2006-04-28T10:21:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	I can't install again
2006-04-28T10:21:00.000Z	Managu	AnAnt	heh, why's that?
2006-04-28T10:21:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	whenever I try to boot from the USB flash drive, it logs me into the linux that was partially installed
2006-04-28T10:22:00.000Z	Managu	AnAnt	I don't understand why that would be a problem.  Reset the flash drive with the other machine?
2006-04-28T10:22:00.000Z	AnAnt	Managu	I did
