2008-01-28T06:47:00.000Z	bod_	rhino7	its a bit off-topic, but if you have purchased an item that does not do as it is intended to do then you have every right to return the to the store
2008-01-28T06:48:00.000Z	rhino7	bod_	would they give me dirty looks and think bad of me?
2008-01-28T06:49:00.000Z	bod_	rhino7	no you keep all of your rights when returning an item, if they do then you can submit a formal complaint with the manager of the shop
2008-01-28T06:49:00.000Z	rhino7	bod_	but i broke the package and cracked the cd case and it's only $5
