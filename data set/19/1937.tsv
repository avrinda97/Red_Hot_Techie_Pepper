2010-08-25T14:58:00.000Z	Gliktch		thanks for the help guys
2010-08-25T15:00:00.000Z	Gliktch		my situation is, I'm behind a (mis)managed firewall that completely shreds all traffic on non-80/443 ports, causing ridiculous levels of packet loss (50%+!), and if that's not the reason for my very slow package downloads then it must just be that the servers are overloaded...  I've triued using mirrors but it doesn't seem to use them and always goes back to archive.ubuntu.org..
2010-08-25T15:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gliktch	after you change mirror did you update  like apt-get update  or the botton in synaptic
2010-08-25T15:03:00.000Z	Gliktch	sacarlson	I was using command line apt-get about half the time, software-manager the other half...
2010-08-25T15:03:00.000Z	Gliktch		depending on whether or not I knew which program I wanted  ;)
2010-08-25T15:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gliktch	well you can only use one at a time.
2010-08-25T15:04:00.000Z	Gliktch		but don't worry about that part, I'll deal with that after I reinstall next - I was hoping for more info on the possibility of getting local copies of the repositories though (at least the main/universe one)
2010-08-25T15:04:00.000Z	Gliktch		of course I have no idea of its size, it might be like a couple of terabytes  :P
2010-08-25T15:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gliktch	yes you can setup local reposties with apache2
2010-08-25T15:05:00.000Z	Gliktch		thanks jpds, I'll definitely try that one first next  :)
2010-08-25T15:06:00.000Z	Gliktch	sacarlson	is that like caching apt for a LAN?
2010-08-25T15:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gliktch	yes sort of
2010-08-25T15:07:00.000Z	Gliktch	sacarlson	that's fine, I have info on those and in my situation AptOnCD does a fine job as well in my situation - but I am hoping to get a physical copy (not have to download) for all the main-line software (the few thousand packages currently in main/universe)
2010-08-25T15:08:00.000Z	Gliktch		I mean, I know I can pay for Ubuntu CDs/DVDs, but I don't see any info on getting a big fat AptOnDVD sent to me  ;)
2010-08-25T15:09:00.000Z	sacarlson		not sure this is what you want but and it's a bit old but 30gig back then http://popey.com/blog/2006/10/24/Creating_an_Ubuntu_repository_mirror_with_apt-mirror/
2010-08-25T15:11:00.000Z	Gliktch	sacarlson	yikes, yeah I'd definitely need at least 2010  lol  But thanks for that link!  :)  That tells me that in 2006 the relevant repositories were 30GB, so I can assume it's at LEAST 100GB or so by now...
2010-08-25T15:11:00.000Z	Gliktch		so my DVD idea is dead in the water - I'll work out something else though  :)
2010-08-25T15:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gliktch	no you would still get the latist but I think the 30gig part is outdated info and will be bigger now
2010-08-25T15:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gliktch	you can setup a group of package you want and make a custom install disk that has those packages on them,  I never have more than 10 gig uncompresed applications installed and packages are compressed.
