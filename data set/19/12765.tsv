2005-10-28T08:18:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson		Question: I just installed Breezy, and the installer quit near the end of the process.  My HD filled up and couldn't take any more.  How can I fix this?

2005-10-28T08:19:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. dont install all the packages
2005-10-28T08:19:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	How do I avoid doing that?
2005-10-28T08:20:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. there are options to custom select packages in the install process .. find some stuff you dont need
2005-10-28T08:21:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. or try the easy and fast arch linux .. it is awesome and perfect for you
2005-10-28T08:21:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. www.archlinuix.org
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	I'll look into it, but I've been using Ubuntu for awhile now and wouldn't rather stick with it.
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. just do a base install .. then you just add whatever you need with #pacman
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	(Though I *was* trying to install Debian yesterday.)
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	What's *pacman
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. arch is easy than deb
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. pacman is the package managing commmand
2005-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	Well, I'll try the base install deal again, and I'll look into arch.
2005-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. if install a base system with nothing, then type #pacman -S gnome .. for example
2005-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	Thanks for your help
2005-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	sml	HaroldJohnson	.. and you have gnome
2005-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	Not even certain I want a GUI.
2005-10-28T08:24:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	sml	Thanks again, I'll get back to that server install.
