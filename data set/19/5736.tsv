2008-05-09T04:20:00.000Z	TheOther		hi, I have a problem with Totem.  Often, I will be playing an mp3, a video or even something off of the web and suddenly, my entire computer freezes, requiring a hard restart.  Any ideas?  I am running Hardy w/ compiz enabled.
2008-05-09T04:21:00.000Z	TheOther		*bump*
2008-05-09T04:23:00.000Z	TheOther		barslol: try googling mencoder
2008-05-09T04:24:00.000Z	TheOther		barslol: it's what I use, although it is a command line tool
2008-05-09T04:24:00.000Z	TheOther		barslol: also, avidemux is great for any transcode job, although sometimes it can desync the audio
2008-05-09T04:26:00.000Z	TheOther		barslol: ya, my bad, it was the first thing to come to my mind
