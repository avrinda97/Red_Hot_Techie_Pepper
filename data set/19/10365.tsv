2008-06-18T04:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	You really should have a backup if anything you cant afford to lose when working at tthe partition level under any os
2008-06-18T04:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	THat does not change my suggestion
2008-06-18T04:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	defrag the windows drive and let ubuntu installer resize the partition automatically
2008-06-18T04:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	please dont repeat
2008-06-18T04:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	restart the installer and let it resize the drive automatically
2008-06-18T04:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	You dont seem to be listening so I cant help you
2008-06-18T04:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazzam	restart the installer and let it resize the drive automatically
