2009-08-28T18:48:00.000Z	Halabund		Now that's what I hate about Linux, something is *always* broken, sometimes critical things, and then I just waste the time trying to fix it, often with no results
2009-08-28T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 i often say the same thing about Windows.. golly...
2009-08-28T18:51:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	Well, several things I *need* are broken in Ubutnu.  I always end up going back to Windows, even if at first it seems that it would be possible to use Linux.  Nothing that I need is broken in Windows, only non-essential stuff.
2009-08-28T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 go do what you want I guess. Have fun.
2009-08-28T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 or hang in here and learn. (thats all i do)
2009-08-28T18:52:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	I almost never get any help here.  I've been trying to get this wireless stuff working for a week now.
2009-08-28T18:53:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	It's university policy not to allow mobile machines on the wired network... I can't access the internet except through wireless
2009-08-28T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 so the wireless works in linux at 'most places' but Not the University wireless network?
2009-08-28T18:57:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	Yes.  I haven't used it at many places though.  I mostly use the wireless.  "Doesn't work" means that it disconnects every few minutes
2009-08-28T18:57:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	*I mostly use the wried network, I mean
2009-08-28T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 ok..  ive heard of 'frequent disconnects' with some drivers.. :)
2009-08-28T18:58:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	Many people have the same problem, most of them complaining that it doesn't work at university/school/etc.  I don't know why are these school networks different than a home one
2009-08-28T18:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 could be interfearance
2009-08-28T18:59:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	It works just fine in Windows.
2009-08-28T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 that proves its not inteferance then? :) actually windows drivers do have more features then many of the linux ones.. so it could be be due to interfearince..
2009-08-28T19:00:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	I wasn't even asking for help with that.  I just want to get this ndiswrapper thing working ...
2009-10-22T20:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 you could try the updated unofficial intel drivers
2009-10-22T20:22:00.000Z	Halabund	Dr_Willis	Thanks, I'll try that
2009-11-28T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Halabund	 make a proper entry for it in /etc/fstab is one way. Install/use/run  the 'ntfs-config' tool - that may add an entry, or otherwise let you access them with no password ne3eded
