2011-02-05T17:33:00.000Z	Ddorda		hey guys. i'm willing to load a user to his gnome interface using ssh. is that possible?
2011-02-05T17:34:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	it might be possible, but it's gonna be horribly slow.. To forward gui applications over ssh use the switch -X when logging in
2011-02-05T17:35:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	i mean, to control gnome connection via the ssh. not to run the whole gnome via ssh
2011-02-05T17:36:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	oh, not sure I know what a gnome connection is. But I wouldn't be able to tell you if it's possible or not anyways.. Theoretically anything you can do with a command line you can do through ssh, so i would think it's possible
2011-02-05T17:37:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	to connect a user to gnome via ssh...
2011-02-05T17:37:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	sorry for being so dense. How do you connect a user to gnome? And what happens once he is connected?
2011-02-05T17:38:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	when you load Ubuntu you can see a login session, i'm willing to enter uname & pass via the ssh
2011-02-05T17:40:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	oh, that's an interesting way of doing stuff
2011-02-05T17:41:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	can't help you with that. Sorry. But I would be surprised if it works, tbh
2011-02-05T17:41:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	you're going to be surprised. i'm 100% sure it is possible
2011-02-05T17:48:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	you're trying to remotely log in for someone else that is currently in front of the machine?
2011-02-05T17:48:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	indeed :)
2011-02-05T17:48:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	because it disturb him doing his homework ;)
2011-02-05T17:50:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	if the person is not in front of the PC, why log him in? If you have an admin account you have full access to his files anywyas
2011-02-05T17:51:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	... i'm willing to "do the password" to the person remotely
2011-02-05T17:51:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	but what for? So that he can use the PC? Or do you want to check something in his account?
2011-02-05T17:52:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	so he can use the computer
2011-02-05T17:54:00.000Z	kaddi	Ddorda	only thing I can think of now is that you could add a new user which has no password or remove the password from your account and reboot to automatically login?
2011-02-05T17:55:00.000Z	Ddorda	kaddi	erm.. it's too hacky...
