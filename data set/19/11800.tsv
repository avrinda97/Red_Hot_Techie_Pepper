2005-12-24T07:42:00.000Z	BenC		hola
2005-12-24T07:43:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	what's up? any new bugs? ;)
2005-12-24T07:43:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	ah, well, at least that ;)
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	heh, when your developing, you have to be ready on such things :/
2005-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	any chance to see the "keyboard layout" *bug* fixed? altought I don't know if this problem exists in Debian
2005-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	at least some workaround?
2005-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	you alive? ;)
2005-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	BenC	Pygi	the one where some keys don't work right with caps lock?
2005-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	the problem with changing keyboard layout in Gnome doesn't work
2005-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	BenC	Pygi	doesn't sound like a kernel bug
2005-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	well, it isn't kernel bug ;)
2005-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	BenC	Pygi	oh, well then I can't answer that :)
2005-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	yes, yes, I know ;)
2005-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	I yet need to find someone who can, or else I'll do it on my own...
2005-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	don't know if Ubuntu/Gnome accepts external patches
2005-12-24T07:49:00.000Z	BenC	Pygi	if it fixes I bug, I don't see why they wouldn't
2005-12-24T07:49:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	bug is relativly easy to fix I suppose
2005-12-24T07:49:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	few modifications and it should work
2005-12-24T07:51:00.000Z	Pygi	BenC	I've been playing with vanilla kernel ;)
