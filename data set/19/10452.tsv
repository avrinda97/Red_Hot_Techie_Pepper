2006-10-03T06:56:00.000Z	M_A_K		I just finished going through the java installer as per instructions from the forum.  I still get error when trying to run the runlime.sh script for limewire.  Any suggestions are appreciated.
2006-10-03T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	pastebin the error
2006-10-03T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	I believe you can do  -l, and then choose one and set it with -s.   sudo update-alternatives --config java  seems easier to user though
2006-10-03T07:06:00.000Z	M_A_K	jrib	: thanks that worked.
2006-10-03T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	/usr/local or /opt are good places
2006-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	M_A_K	jrib	: I created /usr/local/custom for software that I have to install manually  Is that ok?
2006-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	/usr/local is for that purpose but it's your machine, it doesn't really matter
2006-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	what I do is if it has a nice structure (like a bin folder etc) I use /usr/local, and if it is something that is not well structured, just one big folder, I use /opt
2006-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	M_A_K	jrib	: how do I write the command to run Limewire from that location.  I entered the same thing I use at command line, but it did not launch.
2006-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	where did you decide to put it?
2006-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	is the binary then:  /usr/local/custom/LimeWire/limewire   ?
2006-10-03T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	well you can type out  /usr/local/custom/LimeWire/runlime.sh , or just 'sudo ln -s /usr/local/custom/LimeWire/runlime.sh /usr/local/bin/what_name_I_want_that_something_else_doesn't_use', or just setup an alias
2006-10-03T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	I'm not familiar with kde's menu, maybe try 'bash /usr/local/custom/LimeWire/runlime.sh'
2006-10-03T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	k, great
2006-10-06T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	all of the stuff is executable by everyone, so you'll probably need to not let everyone execute it, and then setup groups
2006-10-13T10:54:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	sticky
2006-10-13T10:55:00.000Z	M_A_K	jrib	: what does sticky mean?
2006-10-13T10:59:00.000Z	jrib	M_A_K	what are you installing?
2006-10-13T10:59:00.000Z	M_A_K	jrib	: trying to install smartboard software.
