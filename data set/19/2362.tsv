2010-04-25T20:31:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	use ssh -vvv
2010-04-25T20:32:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	freezes right after "entering interactive session"
2010-04-25T20:33:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	have you modified the /etc/passwd on the target-pc? like adding zsh into it without have it installed?
2010-04-25T20:33:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	I haven't, I'll try that
2010-04-25T20:34:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	dont try that!
2010-04-25T20:34:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	nothing in /var/log/daemon.log?
2010-04-25T20:37:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	nothing. well I mean, I don't know if it's a coincidence, but I've tried a ssh login now and daemon.log has a few lines with ddclient.cache stuff
2010-04-25T20:37:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	I don't think it's related
2010-04-25T20:38:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	and /var/log/auth.log?
2010-04-25T20:38:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	already said about /var/log/auth.log ... it initiates session and gives no more log lines. log output is set to VERBOSE
2010-04-25T20:40:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	i guess the default is /bin/bash but i dont know exactly because i am not using bash as login-shell
2010-04-25T20:40:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	maybe try one user with /bin/bash
2010-04-25T20:40:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	bash is set for the admin user, that also doesn't work
2010-04-25T20:41:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	ssh user@host touch ~/foo -vvv
2010-04-25T20:41:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	look at the host if it is creating the file foo in home-dir
2010-04-25T20:42:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	again, it freezes right after "entering interactive session"
2010-04-25T20:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Fifas	hm but that command should not start a loginshell
2010-04-25T20:43:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	it should if the user is not the one I'm logged on for
2010-04-25T20:44:00.000Z	Fifas	iceroot	anyway, even with the default user any command or session freezes in "entering interactive session"
