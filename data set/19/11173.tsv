2006-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	emo_		how shall I find all the cookies in my system and how can I get rid of them ?
2006-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	thor	emo_	just tell firefox to delete all the cookies on closing
2006-11-08T06:04:00.000Z	emo_	thor	I mean through the terminal
2006-11-08T06:07:00.000Z	thor	emo_	they are in the ~/.mozilla/firefox/????.default folder...but you will need to see what ???.default really is
2006-11-08T06:07:00.000Z	thor	emo_	it is different for each user
2006-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	emo_	thor	any strange stuff my pc behaving strange like sometimes the icone from my internet conection keep lighting without I'm being browsing ...
2006-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	thor	emo_	sometimes it will...it needs to communicate with the dhcp server and other places.
2006-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	thor	emo_	to know if it is a problem you really need to capture the packets with wireshark or some such tool and see what is being sent/received
2006-11-08T06:11:00.000Z	emo_	thor	I don't know how to analyse the packets that's the point...:(
2006-11-08T06:12:00.000Z	emo_	thor	like sometimes my browser shut down by itself...that's not normal...
2006-11-08T06:13:00.000Z	thor	emo_	No, that isn't normal. But I doubt that is a cookie issue.
2006-11-08T06:13:00.000Z	thor	emo_	do you get an error code when your browser shuts down?
2006-11-08T06:14:00.000Z	emo_	thor	no that's right I think that isn't my machine...
2006-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	emo_	thor	can you give some tips how to analyse the packages...like a book tutorial or whatever...
2006-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	thor	emo_	you might try this...instead of clicking on the firefox icon to run the program open a terminal and type 'firefox'. Then, when firefox crashes there should be some information in the terminal window about what happened.
2006-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	thor	emo_	I don't know of one, but there is plenty of information on the web about it. Start at the wireshark homepage
2006-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	thor	emo_	http://www.wireshark.org/
2006-11-08T06:18:00.000Z	emo_	thor	right I gonna have a look...cheers
