2011-02-14T23:30:00.000Z	MtrPanda		how can I stop Xchat from automatically logging on here
2011-02-14T23:31:00.000Z	MtrPanda		have looked and dont seem to make sense of it
2011-02-14T23:32:00.000Z	MtrPanda		ok will try
2011-02-14T23:32:00.000Z	MtrPanda		ikonia,
2011-02-14T23:33:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	you mean you want it to not connect to #ubuntu @ startup?
2011-02-14T23:33:00.000Z	MtrPanda		yes. not connect
2011-02-14T23:33:00.000Z	MtrPanda		to freenone
2011-02-14T23:33:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	right-click the #ubuntu tab and remove from favorites
2011-02-14T23:34:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	yes, i believe it does
2011-02-14T23:34:00.000Z	MtrPanda		ok, will exit and try again
2011-02-14T23:38:00.000Z	bc81		!info depmod
2011-02-14T23:38:00.000Z	MtrPanda		Thanks, part way there. Xchat does not auto connect to #ubuntu but still auto connects to freenode
2011-02-14T23:38:00.000Z	MtrPanda		how can i stop that?
2011-02-14T23:40:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	hmm.. XChat >> Network List >> Freenode: Edit
2011-02-14T23:42:00.000Z	MtrPanda	bc81	  the auto connect at startup has never been activated an is unchecked as are all the other servers
2011-02-14T23:44:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	no idea man, check #xchat :-)
2011-02-14T23:45:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	i mean, maybe set a different server to connect to, then you might be given the option to disable freenode auto connect
2011-02-14T23:45:00.000Z	MtrPanda	bc81	 ok, will try.. think maybe if i force it on then when i take it off it might reset it.. it came like this out of the box
2011-02-14T23:45:00.000Z	bc81	MtrPanda	because launching xchat without connecting seems rather pointless
