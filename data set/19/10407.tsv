2009-04-05T06:28:00.000Z	_d0c_F-TC		yes
2009-04-05T06:28:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	is it really that big of a problem ;)
2009-04-05T06:29:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	you can try data recovery
2009-04-05T06:29:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	well if i read correctly and yo accidentally deleted your windows partition?
2009-04-05T06:30:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	you can get something akin to @active undelete (don't use that, it sucks)
2009-04-05T06:31:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	good luck getting it back because 10 to 1 you probably wrote over everything that used to be in the windows partition.
2009-04-05T06:31:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	do you still have a windows disk?
2009-04-05T06:34:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	well... this may get you started...  if you wish to regain any important data, you may want to stop using the HDD until you can put it in another system as a slave, using windows, and then try one of many utilities.. . http://www.google.com/search?q=undelete+a+ntfs+partition
2009-04-05T06:36:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	this may also be of some help.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCapEFNZAJ0&feature=PlayList&p=E470E7505DE52C20
2009-04-05T06:37:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	  if you want to maximize the data you can recover... stop using the drive immediately.
2009-04-05T06:37:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	remember, you can run ubuntu from the cd... in live mode.
2009-04-05T06:41:00.000Z	space_cadet	_d0c_F-TC	pls don't you could get a ticket
