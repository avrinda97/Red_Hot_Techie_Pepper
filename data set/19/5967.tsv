2008-04-14T02:53:00.000Z	_Silhouette_		Hello...I am trying to load ubuntu from an external HD using EasyBCD....I don't know what the bootloader path is, though, or if I have grub installed properly. How can I tell?
2008-04-14T02:55:00.000Z	_Silhouette_		anyone?
2008-04-14T02:56:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	when nmo one answers you just repeat periodicaly ,  this is a busy channel we miss some
2008-04-14T02:59:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	are you booting from the interenal drive or from the external ?
2008-04-14T03:02:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	are you booting from the interenal drive or from the external ?
2008-04-14T03:03:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	Pelo	I would assume the internal, although ubuntu is on the external hard drive
2008-04-14T03:03:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	if you can , try booting from the external , supossing ubuntu was completely installed on the external grub incluede
2008-04-14T03:04:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	Pelo	I don't know if grub was installed. I used the alternate CD install, live didn't work
2008-04-14T03:04:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	grub is always installed,
2008-04-14T03:05:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	Pelo	EasyBCD's bootloader path mentions a \NST\nst_grub.mbr , which I don't see on the HD.
2008-04-14T03:05:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	just to recap here can you actualy boot ubuntu or not ? what exactly is the issue ?
2008-04-14T03:05:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	Pelo	Ubuntu shows on the vista bootloader, but I can't boot into ubuntu
2008-04-14T03:05:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	Pelo	I'm using EasyBCD
2008-04-14T03:06:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	that's when you boot from the internal hdd I assume,  try booting from the exxternal, see what happens,  I can't realy help you much,  I don'T know about bdc and about vista bootloader
2008-04-14T03:07:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	Pelo	i can't find a folder \nst\ or a nst_grub.mbr file
2008-04-14T03:07:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	 I dont think those aer folder you can access ,but I might bewrong
2008-04-14T03:07:00.000Z	Pelo	_Silhouette_	I'll stop now I'm realy not able to hlep you
