2005-06-04T12:35:00.000Z	rg58sma		hi have a problema
2005-06-04T12:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	we saw the other fifty times, and we are none the wiser
2005-06-04T12:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	you've beebn told about pasting: please don't
2005-06-06T16:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	your enter key is not a substitute for punctuation
2005-06-06T16:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	ifconfig perhaps?
2005-06-06T16:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	we are trying to understand your fractured english, sorry
2005-06-06T16:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	host, nslookup, dig
2005-06-06T05:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	umm... language please
2005-06-06T05:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	what is your native language? And why are you running as root?
2005-06-06T05:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	I suggest you *NOT* use IRC as root
2005-06-06T05:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	jst fix it: log in as a user, please
2005-06-06T05:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	stop it please
2005-06-07T09:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	use it to get codecs, then get rid of it or comment it out
2005-06-14T13:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rg58sma	your questions are always so vague - and you are surprised that no one can help?
