2008-08-09T13:21:00.000Z	airspace		the only think stopping me from moving from Windows to Ubunu (as with many other people in South Africa) is that I cannot use my 3G phone as a Bluetooth modem
2008-08-09T13:22:00.000Z	airspace		nope
2008-08-09T13:22:00.000Z	airspace		nokia
2008-08-09T13:22:00.000Z	airspace		says the MAC is invalid
2008-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	airspace		funny thing is if you go to the prompt and tell it to scan for DUN devices it shows my phones mac
2008-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	airspace		that's not the point
2008-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	airspace		I don't want to use it with USB
2008-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	airspace		it has to be bluetooth
2008-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	airspace		Windows does it simply
2008-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	tthat really annoys me too (in my case a blackberry pearl)
2008-08-09T13:24:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	I never did solve it (it's like the DUN profile isn't exposed when a Linux bluetooth stack is probing)
2008-08-09T13:24:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	btw, you did do a scan from linux, right?
2008-08-09T13:24:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	which commnd?
2008-08-09T13:25:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	can you pastebin the output of your bt scan?
2008-08-09T13:25:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	in windows?
2008-08-09T13:25:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	ah, you only have the one compter
2008-08-09T13:26:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	well, can't really help you then
2008-08-09T13:28:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	It does work (i've used it).. but it is tricky...
2008-08-09T13:28:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	airspace	but agreed, they need to improve that for sure
