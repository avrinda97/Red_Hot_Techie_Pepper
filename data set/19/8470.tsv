2007-04-24T09:03:00.000Z	Chicory		Okay, I'm back again -- in bitchx.
2007-04-24T09:03:00.000Z	Chicory		So now I'm getting some really weird ndiswrapper.modules error.
2007-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	Chicory		And it's some sort of a dependency from linux-image-*?
2007-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	Chicory		It worked last time, it SAYS that it's installed properly --
2007-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	Chicory		And yet?
2007-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	Chicory		AND YET IT DOES NOT FUNCTION.  >:E
2007-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	Chicory		Does anyone know whyo n earth I'd be lacking modules.ndiswrapper?
2007-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	Chicory		!rt73
2007-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	Chicory		!ralink
2007-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	Chicory		Ah.
2007-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	do you have time to return it?
2007-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	ndiswrapper is a cheap hack
2007-04-24T09:06:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	its much better to use a wireless card with native drivers like atheros
2007-04-24T09:06:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	yes, I have a proxim orinoco which uses the atheros chipset
2007-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	atheros open sourced them
2007-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	It uses the madwifi drivers
2007-04-24T09:08:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	But I can do anything with the card cause it lets you put it in monitor mode, and inject packets and even use it as an access point

2007-04-24T09:11:00.000Z	chowmeined	Chicory	and this is the card I have: http://www.proxim.com/products/cp/pc.html
