2008-03-06T08:18:00.000Z	cottima		how do I setup raid on the live installer
2008-03-06T08:19:00.000Z	cottima		softraid, that is
2008-03-06T08:20:00.000Z	owh	cottima	Format the partition, set the partition type to Raid Auto Detect, restart the partitioner.
2008-03-06T08:20:00.000Z	owh	cottima	Uh. s/format/create/
2008-03-06T08:24:00.000Z	cottima	owh	sorry, what format type do I select?
2008-03-06T08:25:00.000Z	owh	cottima	It's the partition type that you select.
2008-03-06T08:25:00.000Z	owh	cottima	Linux RAID AutoDetect, on the second page if memory serves me.
2008-03-06T08:28:00.000Z	cottima	owh	could the fact that I am using a xubuntu cd make a difference?
2008-03-06T08:28:00.000Z	owh	cottima	No, it shouldn't. What is the problem you're experiencing?
2008-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	cottima	owh	To start out, I have three options: guided entire disk, guided largest free space, and manual.  Guided continues onto user info: "Who are you?"  In manual, I only file system formats, no raid option.
2008-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	owh	cottima	In the manual section, choose the disk you want to partition, then inside that you can setup partitions, inside that you can chose the partition type. If you have multiple identical drives you can be funky and do it automatically with one drive, go back, then chose the other drive, do the same - so the partitions are identical, then go back a third time, choose manual, then set the types, then finally go back and choose manu
2008-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	owh	cottima	Did you understand that?
2008-03-06T08:36:00.000Z	cottima		yeah, but I still do not see how I can do raid without an option for it.
2008-03-06T08:37:00.000Z	owh	cottima	You can set the partition type from within manual.
2008-03-06T08:42:00.000Z	owh		:)
2008-03-06T08:46:00.000Z	owh	cottima	Is it working for you now?
2008-03-06T08:58:00.000Z	cottima	owh	excuse the wait.  I am going to download the ubuntu cd in case.
2008-03-06T08:58:00.000Z	cottima	owh	thank you.
2008-03-06T08:59:00.000Z	owh	cottima	Pleasure.
