2009-05-24T01:30:00.000Z	gharz1	pgimenez	it doesn't get deleted. i right clicked it and selected Delete but it still in the Main Menu
2009-05-24T01:31:00.000Z	gharz1		is there any xml or any text file which i can edit this?
2009-05-24T01:32:00.000Z	pgimenez	gharz1	Just try to run it as root
2009-05-24T01:33:00.000Z	gharz1		as root? how did you run it as root?
2009-05-24T01:33:00.000Z	gharz1	pgimenez	what command did you use?
2009-05-24T01:34:00.000Z	pgimenez	gharz1	on terminal sudo (wait a moment... trying to remember...)
2009-05-24T01:35:00.000Z	gharz1		ok
2009-05-24T01:35:00.000Z	pgimenez	gharz1	sudo alacarte
2009-05-24T01:35:00.000Z	gharz1		ok
2009-05-24T01:35:00.000Z	gharz1		thanks
2009-05-24T01:35:00.000Z	gharz1		i'll try that one out
2009-05-24T01:37:00.000Z	gharz1	pgimenez	why is it that the entries when i'm using root is different when i run alacarte as a normal user? in a normal user... Other folder is showing MagicISO and Wine folder is there... while in root there is no MagicISO and the Wine folder isn't there.
2009-05-24T01:40:00.000Z	pgimenez	gharz1	As root you have complete control of all menu entries. Did that work for you?
2009-05-24T01:42:00.000Z	gharz1	pgimenez	yes it did... but when i checked the entries Wine folder isn't there and MagicISO is not in the Other anymore... but when i open alacarte using a normal user... wine-wine folder appears and MagicISO is in the Other folder
2009-05-24T01:43:00.000Z	pgimenez	gharz1	Wow, don't know why!!!
2009-05-24T01:45:00.000Z	gharz1	pgimenez	yeah... i'm even surprised!
2009-05-24T01:45:00.000Z	gharz1		i just wanna know where i can find alacarte's entries
2009-05-24T01:47:00.000Z	pgimenez	gharz1	Ok. Trying to locate (think it is a xml one in /usr/somewhere...
