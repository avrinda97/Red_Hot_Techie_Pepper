2005-08-08T12:57:00.000Z	melio		OK! one issue with the installer
2005-08-08T12:57:00.000Z	melio		if anyone codes ubuntu, they NEED to setup a defualt resolution picker at install time, otherwise some people are going to have out of range on they're monitors and not know how to fix it
2005-08-08T12:58:00.000Z	melio		because I Just installed it, and it offered no assistance with resolution
2005-08-08T12:58:00.000Z	melio		ticked that it didnt give me options for resolution choices
2005-08-08T12:59:00.000Z	melio		which is fine
2005-08-08T12:59:00.000Z	melio		I'll tolerate that
2005-08-08T13:01:00.000Z	melio		hence the reason why I clean install with nothing. and do my own software additions. not that I care abotu space
