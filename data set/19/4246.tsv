2009-06-27T19:08:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu		do i have to have a bin file in the / folder to install it? or can I have it in my home folder?
2009-06-27T19:09:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	it can usually be in your home folder
2009-06-27T19:09:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	you might or might not be required to be root to run it though
2009-06-27T19:09:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	unless specifically stated?
2009-06-27T19:09:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	yeah, probably
2009-06-27T19:09:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	 coll thnx
2009-06-27T19:09:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	any specific software you're talking about?
2009-06-27T19:10:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	savage 2
2009-06-27T19:10:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	ok, wouldn't know
2009-06-27T19:10:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	just downloaded it , didnt see any instructions on the site
2009-06-27T19:11:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	probably 'chmod a+x somefile.bin ; ./somefile.bin' then
2009-06-27T19:11:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	or 'sudo ./somefile.bin'
2009-06-27T19:11:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	thats if it was in the /folder right?
2009-06-27T19:12:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	no, doesn't matter
2009-06-27T19:12:00.000Z	raboof	ohletmeinnowjesu	'./' means 'in the current directory (whatever it is)'
2009-06-27T19:12:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	right ok but if i werent operating in the dir where i saved it i would have to cd there or type in the full pathname
2009-06-27T19:13:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	what if the drive that it was saved on was an ntfs...would that be a problem?
2009-06-27T19:15:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	raboof	yeah ?
