2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	atlambert		hi
2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	atlambert		having problems installing ubuntu on my netbook
2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	atlambert		in the past, i've been able to install ubuntu via usb on my netbook
2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	atlambert		i can't get the usb to boot, though :/ i can go into windows (which is the current os) and see the installer. but it has that wubi thing for installing ubuntu along side windows
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	atlambert		i want to KILL windows and everything, and just start fresh w/ ubuntu
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	atlambert		i can't get it to boot into it though :/
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	atlambert		i feel like the problem is w/ the contents of the iso
2011-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	atlambert		km0201 it's been fine in the past
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	you installed ubuntu via wubi?
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	atlambert	almoxarife	no. doesnt that mean my only option is install alongside windows?
2011-05-30T04:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	a wubi install of ubuntu will place the complete filesystem in one file, I ran it that way for along time, and adds ubuntu as a second OS
2011-05-30T04:36:00.000Z	atlambert	almoxarife	i have like a gb of free space, and it takes years to uninstall one thing in windows because it chugs awfully on this ancient netbook
2011-05-30T04:37:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	trust me, the unstall for wubi ubuntu is quick, as a matter of fact you can unstall it by simply deleting one folder 'ubuntu'
2011-05-30T04:43:00.000Z	atlambert	almoxarife	KM0201 yeah i don't quite understand either. i'm gonna try play with wubi and see if i'm missing something here
2011-05-30T04:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	the point about wiping windows is valid, don't do it, unless you are willing to start from scratch with a virgin netbook
2011-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	how much hd space do you have?
2011-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	atlambert	almoxarife	2.65 gb
2011-05-30T04:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	KM0201 point is valid, my bad, forget wubi, you don't have the space, I am surprized, a 2g hard drive? don't fuckup windows, you might never load another system on that laptop/nettop what ever its called.
2011-05-30T04:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	atlambert	let me understand, the HD came with 2gig or you are left with 2G?
