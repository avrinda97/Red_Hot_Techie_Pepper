2011-05-13T03:06:00.000Z	kliqqq	cor_r	happen to know if that voids the warranty?
2011-05-13T03:07:00.000Z	cor_r	kliqqq	well ,it didnt say so in the manual or when openin the device, so I guess not, but I never asked^^
2011-05-13T03:08:00.000Z	kliqqq	cor_r	grrrrr well with a single core dual thread processor i wouldnt need 2 gb ram i hope, aslong as it can play a 720p video on youtube it can do more than i need
