2008-11-27T17:25:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	ty
2008-11-27T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	do you mean Fuse ?
2008-11-27T17:29:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	the fast user switcher applet is what im referring to.
2008-11-27T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	in what way doesn't work ?
2008-11-27T17:31:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	well, i just tried to add it my panel and it didnt load and it didnt give the error it normally does.  so i cant tell you the normal error but it something along the lines of 'fusa crashed upon loading.  reload?'
2008-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	it's already on your panel by default
2008-11-27T17:33:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	sorry i got disconnected for a second if you tried to reply
2008-11-27T17:33:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	it's already on your panel by default
2008-11-27T17:34:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	it should be but when i installed and it asked me if i wanted it i hit the wrong button.  now it wont load.  i've reinstalled with synaptic a couple times and it's the same thing
2008-11-27T17:35:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	you shouldn't have needed to install it, it was already there by default
2008-11-27T17:35:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	but it's not.  my panel doesn't have it.  i can assure you that.  if i trie to add it it crashes.
2008-11-27T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	log a bug
2008-11-27T17:37:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	thanks man.  i will log a bug.  but this the first thing in 4 releases that ive experienced that no one else has.
2008-11-27T17:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jerknextdoor	possible it doesn't work with your hardware ?
2008-11-27T17:38:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	ikonia	i thought that but i have a pretty generic thinkpad so it shouldn't be that.  plus it works with the jaunty alpha
