2010-03-13T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	greezmunkey	just log out and back in to make sure it's loaded automatically on login
2010-03-13T18:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	ahh, cool!
2010-03-13T18:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	ok, I get it, because it's in my home (profile) directory.
2010-03-28T20:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	Thanks for the "screen" tip, I learned something :)
2010-05-08T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	greezmunkey	well backup /etc in case you made some changes there
2010-05-08T18:03:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	That's why I ask in here! yes samba, several others! (thanks)
2010-05-08T18:04:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	I have my virtualbox .vdi file, so I'm good there
2010-05-08T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	greezmunkey	presumably you know to backup any sort of data like /var/www and so on
2010-05-08T18:05:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	yeah, nothing too valuable there, nothing I wouldn't mind redoing anyway
2010-05-08T18:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	During install - esp partitioning it will ask me about /home, what do I do there?
2010-05-08T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	greezmunkey	tell it to use your existing /home partition as /home but make sure you tell it NOT to format
2010-05-08T18:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	ok, sounds reasonable - right on man, thanks
2010-05-08T19:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	installing now...
2010-05-08T19:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	so far so good, almost done (crossing fingers)
2010-05-08T19:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	Ha! pretty slick
2010-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	Heh, I have it fully restored :) runnin' like a top.
2010-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	jrib	greezmunkey	cool
2010-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	jrib	just finished restoring mysql, all that lamp stuff
