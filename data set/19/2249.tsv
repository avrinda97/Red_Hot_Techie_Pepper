2010-05-18T02:52:00.000Z	Tetnis		google?
2010-05-18T02:52:00.000Z	Tetnis		Anyone here experienced with GRUB?
2010-05-18T02:54:00.000Z	Tetnis		Not a bad idea. GRUB keeps giving Error 17: Can't mount Selected Partition!
2010-05-18T02:55:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	Is that after having read menu.lst?
2010-05-18T02:58:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	grub version 1 or 2?
2010-05-18T03:00:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	That's version 1 ;-)   Type `root`
2010-05-18T03:02:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	Don't _try_ to set it, just set it :)
2010-05-18T03:02:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	What does `root` say?
2010-05-18T03:05:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	What partition is grub on?
2010-05-18T03:05:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	partition 0
2010-05-18T03:06:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	Then it's "(hd0,0)", not "hd0"
2010-05-18T03:07:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	I know ;-), root (hd0,0) doesn't work - and i know for a fact it's on partition 0
2010-05-18T03:08:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	After setting `root (hd0,0)` type `kernel <tab>`. Does it show files from hd0,0?
2010-05-18T03:09:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	Comes up with error 1
2010-05-18T03:10:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	Also, i have to use rootnoverify in order bypass error 13 and get to the error 17 stage.
2010-05-18T03:10:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	to get the*
2010-05-18T03:11:00.000Z	vlt	Tetnis	Is there a grub or boot/grub directory in that file system?
2010-05-18T03:11:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	yes
2010-05-18T03:14:00.000Z	Tetnis	vlt	I'm just going to scrap the system and start over. Thanks for your help :-)
