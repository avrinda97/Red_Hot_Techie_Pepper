2007-03-29T09:08:00.000Z	Crell		Hi all.  Can anyone recommend a stable PHP 5.2 backport for Edgy?
2007-03-29T09:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	I've done one for Debian Sarge that *may* work with Edgy.
2007-03-29T09:09:00.000Z	Crell		I found one on the forums from dotdeb, but it conflicted with just about everything related to PHP. :-)

2007-03-29T09:09:00.000Z	Crell	cafuego_	Eh, I suspect a sarge package won't work on Edgy unless I compile it from scratch.
2007-03-29T09:10:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	Well, let me see if it wrecks mine
2007-03-29T09:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	So far so good
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	Ok, it works. My gallery2 is up and OK.
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	Crell		Hm, ok.  Actually I'm tracking this problem closer and it may not be a PHP 5.1-related problem.
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	Crell		What's the URL for it, just in case?
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	cafuego_		http://debian.cafuego.net/dists/sarge-cafuego
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	Crell		Thanks.
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	It's a complete port of the etch apache2.2+php5.2+php4.4 to Sarge
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	cafuego_		oh and apache 1.3
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	Crell		4.4?  Why? :-)
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	I actually needed 4.4.4
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	cafuego_		There is a fair bit of stuff that won't run on 5.x
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	cafuego_		And paying clients want it, so 4.4 it is :-)
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crell	if you do want to build, I have (modified) source debs there too.
