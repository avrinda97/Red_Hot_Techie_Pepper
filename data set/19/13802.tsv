2011-12-01T04:14:00.000Z	reisio		it's just if it eats 8GB of ram and you _don't have_ a swap partition, your system won't last long
2011-12-01T04:14:00.000Z	x_	reisio	my point exactly.
2011-12-01T04:17:00.000Z	x_	reisio	what do you do to run out of ram.
2011-12-01T04:20:00.000Z	reisio	x_	updating kernels without rebooting, that's what
2011-12-01T04:20:00.000Z	x_	reisio	yea, idk ive never done that b4.
2011-12-01T09:14:00.000Z	reisio	x_	your nick is unhelpfully short :p
2011-12-01T09:14:00.000Z	reisio	x_	you'd probably have to stop xfdesktop from running
2011-12-01T09:15:00.000Z	x_	reisio	is that a good idea?
2011-12-01T09:15:00.000Z	reisio	x_	if you don't use xfdesktop
2011-12-01T09:16:00.000Z	reisio	x_	Settings > Session and Startup > Session (tab) > xfdesktop - Restart Style: Never
2011-12-01T09:18:00.000Z	x_	reisio	http://imageshack.us/f/717/screenshot1130201111170.png/ is what I wan't it to look like. but with the left being part of the desktop, but I can just use it this way with a terminal resized if it's alot easier. what will killing xfdesktop do exactly ?
2011-12-01T09:18:00.000Z	reisio	x_	cute
2011-12-01T09:19:00.000Z	x_	reisio	sort of... do you notice how on my conky the login screen of all things is bleeding through ?
2011-12-01T09:19:00.000Z	reisio	x_	as I said, it will keep Xfce from managing the desktop for wallpapers, icons, and its right-click menu (on the desktop)
2011-12-01T09:19:00.000Z	reisio	x_	things you probably won't want
2011-12-01T09:20:00.000Z	x_	reisio	it's like the dots from the login screen.. if I had it on the left. it would show ubuntu 11.10 like the login screen is under my desktop but conky shows it....
2011-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	x_	reisio	any idea what would cause a program to show parts of the login screen though?
2011-12-02T04:43:00.000Z	reisio	x_	you could log out and see if your DM can find it
2011-12-02T04:43:00.000Z	x_	reisio	yea, it doesn't/
