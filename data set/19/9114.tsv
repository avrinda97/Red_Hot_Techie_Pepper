2008-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	thats probably best, take a paxil, and go back to windows
2008-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	that tells me there's a user malfunction
2008-06-10T16:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	try the alt. install cd
2008-06-10T16:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	after the first 3x, yo probably should have assumed there was a user malfunction, and sought help
2008-06-10T17:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	look at the partition editor(system/admin/partition editor), and see if you see Linux partitions
2008-06-10T17:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	use the recovery instructions
2008-06-10T17:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	read that again
2008-06-10T17:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	you typed it wrong, read again.
2008-06-10T17:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	are you putting the = sign int he terminal?
2008-06-10T17:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	you have to give us the link
2008-06-10T17:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	well, somethinng happened and it didn't work, i would suggest using the alt. install cd
2008-06-10T17:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	eviltim	just remember, burn the ISO SLOW...
