2006-11-07T13:00:00.000Z	traskbt		I have a .iso of a GNU/Linux distro downloaded, but no blank CD-Rs, only CD-RWs is there a way I can still install the new distro? (i'm on ubuntu right now)
2006-11-07T13:01:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	multiple methods
2006-11-07T13:02:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	multiple cd/dvd drives?
2006-11-07T13:02:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	oh. i also just reread what you said. you can install from CD-RW
2006-11-07T13:03:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	but the cd is detected and starts to boot?
2006-11-07T13:04:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	what distro and arch is that?
2006-11-07T13:04:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	whats on the cd
2006-11-07T13:05:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	x86? x86_64?
2006-11-07T13:05:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	id try rewriting the image to another cd before i did anything else
2006-11-07T13:06:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	when/if that doesnt work, i'd copy the contents onto a partition that wont be overwritten during your install
2006-11-07T13:06:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	then you need a working live cd
2006-11-07T13:07:00.000Z	traskbt	Tompu	alright, thanks, I'll try burning it again now.....
2006-11-07T13:07:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	also, take a look at debootstrap
2006-11-07T13:14:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	this is why you must always repeat your question in its entirety, and not pieces :)
2006-11-07T13:14:00.000Z	traskbt	Tompu	yeah, I can see that :P
2006-11-07T13:14:00.000Z	Tompu	traskbt	did you look at debootstrap?
2006-11-07T13:16:00.000Z	traskbt	Tompu	what about it?
