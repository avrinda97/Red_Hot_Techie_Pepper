2011-06-10T13:45:00.000Z	maalac		hi
2011-06-10T13:45:00.000Z	maalac		need help on the kernel problem in ubuntu
2011-06-10T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	just ask the question
2011-06-10T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	why do you need to
2011-06-10T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	ok - so reinstalling the kernel won't fix that
2011-06-10T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	if it's a bug in the kernel - re-installing it won't fix the bug
2011-06-10T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	ubuntu4hp ?
2011-06-10T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	I don't even know what that is
2011-06-10T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	inside hp network ? what do you mean
2011-06-10T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	what hp network ?
2011-06-10T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	as in HP office lan ?
2011-06-10T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	ok - so I am also on a HP lan, and you need to use the proxy server as direct connections are firewalled off
2011-06-16T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	pastebin your sources.list file
2011-06-16T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	actually, do "sudo apt-get update" and pastebin the output please
2011-06-16T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	the problem is you have conflicting packages from different repos
2011-06-16T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	you also have a mirror down, ubuntu-mirror.fc.hp.com is not responding
2011-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	why do you think it is ?
2011-08-14T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	that's no reason to think it's compromised, that's just random assumption
2011-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	maalac	well, when it slows down, look at the cpu and memory utilisation, look at what processes are using the resources up
