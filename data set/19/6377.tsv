2008-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	darkcrab		could be your system configuration.

2008-03-10T06:50:00.000Z	oboy03		darkcrad: is it known to have that bug?
2008-03-10T06:51:00.000Z	darkcrab		oboy, go ahead and give the alternate installer CD a try and see if that helps.
2008-03-10T06:51:00.000Z	darkcrab		if it doesnt, come back.
2008-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	darkcrab		FYI, to everyone here. if you use windows to burn a copy of linux, remember that windows is not a great operating system to burn CD's. Make sure before you install your system that your CD is not bad.
2008-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	darkcrab		That can cause errors in installation.
2008-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	oboy03	darkcrab	actually i finished installing but i guess out of 10 install there are 3 that fail on grub
2008-03-10T06:53:00.000Z	darkcrab	oboy03	I would give the alt-cd a try.
