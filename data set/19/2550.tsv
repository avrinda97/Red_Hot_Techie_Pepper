2011-08-04T21:50:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		how do i assign a ip address to a client on a bridge behind a router which is
2011-08-04T21:50:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		cause anytime my box loses connection... another box takes its place in the ip table
2011-08-04T21:50:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		horrible way to live i tell you
2011-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		it changes from 192.168.1.105 to 106 and back
2011-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		but where?
2011-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		my bridge doesnt have the option for it
2011-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	then configure the dhcp server to reserve the address
2011-08-04T21:56:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	it's the IP of your router
2011-08-04T21:57:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	cause it doesn't. route print does for example
2011-08-04T21:58:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	nslookup google.com  tells you your current one. your router again usually
2011-08-04T22:00:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	it will soon blow up in your face. you didn't tell the DHCP server not to hand out .105 on its own. so sooner or later it will hand out this IP and then your whole network breaks. have fun
2011-08-04T22:00:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	wols_	.... lol.
2011-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	configure your DHCP server properly
2011-08-04T22:03:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	wols_	i think i did it correctly
2011-08-04T22:10:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	so the dhcp server gave out .105 on its own, yes?
2011-08-04T22:10:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	wols_	yeah :(
2011-08-04T22:11:00.000Z	wols_	[THC]AcidRain	either by configuring your DHCP server properly or by selecting an IP for your static setup that won't get handed out by the DHCP server
