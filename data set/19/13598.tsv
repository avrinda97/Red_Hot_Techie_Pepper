2005-02-28T09:30:00.000Z	skel_home		so is it safe to add debian apt sources to ubuntu?
2005-02-28T09:31:00.000Z	skel_home		like I would like eric3 (a python IDE ) but its not in warty
2005-02-28T09:31:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	not usually
2005-02-28T09:31:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	if it's in hoary it would be better to add a deb-src line for hoary and 'apt-get source -b eric3'
2005-02-28T09:32:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	isn't it bad to mix the two releases? messes up deps?
2005-02-28T09:32:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	yes, but you are less likely to run into trouble by building the hoary source package on your warty box
2005-02-28T09:33:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	ok thanks. I'll try that
2005-02-28T09:33:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	the apt howto at www.debian.org/doc is pretty good
2005-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	wow, that'll get you a lot of help
2005-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	thats as optimistic as I get at this point
2005-03-14T10:11:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	what are you having trouble with? I've helped a friend get it working on amd64
2005-03-14T10:12:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	firefox crashes everytime I try and type something into the google search
2005-03-14T10:12:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	I get two letters in.. py
2005-03-14T10:12:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	running fresh warty
2005-03-14T10:12:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	maybe add warty-updates to your sources.list and upgrade
2005-03-14T10:13:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	ok maybe this is an issue of me not rtfm enough
2005-03-14T10:14:00.000Z	farruinn	skel_home	actually, I don't know where I found out about warty-updates...
2005-03-14T10:16:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	is warty-updates on archive.ubuntu?
2005-03-14T10:17:00.000Z	skel_home	farruinn	i'm getting a 404 in my update
