2006-12-01T10:06:00.000Z	matthew_	strabes	well, that's is a bummer as well...
2006-12-01T10:06:00.000Z	strabes	matthew_	i know; i like automatix2 a lot myself
2006-12-01T10:06:00.000Z	matthew_	strabes	kinda similar to "we don't like coloreds around here" ?
2006-12-01T10:06:00.000Z	strabes	matthew_	i think
2006-12-01T15:11:00.000Z	strabes	matthew_	gksudo nautilus /path/to/dir
2006-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	matthew_	strabes	how do I get it on my desktop?
2006-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	strabes	matthew_	get what on your desktop?
2006-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	matthew_	strabes	a link that would open nautilus as root
2006-12-01T15:13:00.000Z	strabes	matthew_	you want a 'shortcut' like a launcher? right click on desktop, create launcher, in the command box put "gksudo nautilus /path/to/dir" I think that will work; not sure though. try it
2006-12-01T15:15:00.000Z	matthew_	strabes	ok that worked
2006-12-01T15:15:00.000Z	matthew_	strabes	thanks
