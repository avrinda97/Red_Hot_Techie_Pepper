2007-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	VirhYl3	bobstro	Right, but if they can't see what I'm doing, I just want VPN connect of certain bandwidth..... They have to shut up or I can sue, right?
2007-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	just google around. i'm paying about $20US/mo. but it's limited to 5GB/mo. or it costs more.
2007-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	well, you're after a lot of features. may be hard to find much cheaper.
2007-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	heh. no time soon, my friend.
2007-04-26T06:46:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	hey, you got a free OS and apps out of the deal at least!
2007-04-26T06:47:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	i suspect those will still have caps, unless you're talking about building your own wimax?
2007-04-26T06:48:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	in which case you'll be pissing off people that know where you live. bandwidth isn't unlimited on wimax.
2007-04-26T06:49:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	the cooperatives work when people COOPERATE. :)
2007-04-26T06:49:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	keep in mind that bandwidth is still shared.
2007-04-26T06:50:00.000Z	VirhYl3	bobstro	Yeah, but if everybody has a 100mbit connection to everyone else?
2007-04-26T06:50:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	everybody SHARES that bandwidth, unless you're doing dedicated links to each.
2007-04-26T06:51:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	don't trust the "unlimited bandwidth" from the wimax mfr. any more than from your isp.
2007-04-26T06:51:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	we've done wimax deployments. i have a good idea.
2007-04-26T06:52:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	the internet has never been the issue, it's the shared bandwidth of wimax itself.
2007-04-26T06:52:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	doing it with a FRACTION of what you're describing will choke it.
2007-04-26T06:53:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	what we need is good infrastructure like most other countries have. 100Mbps to the house isn't at all uncommon elsewhere.
2007-04-26T06:53:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	it largely is many places in the world.
2007-04-26T06:53:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	wimax is great for rurals and such, not so good for speed freaks downloading movies!
2007-04-26T06:54:00.000Z	bobstro	VirhYl3	just give me FIOS for now and i'll be happy.
