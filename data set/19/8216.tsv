2009-11-24T11:40:00.000Z	osirisx11		USB drive removal process: "eject", "unmount", or "safely remove"? what's the difference?
2009-11-24T11:42:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	unmount is to .. well.. unmount the file system on the usb stick.. it will flush out anything in the buffer and so on.. eject might be for cd's and such that physically has to be ejected.. safely remove I'm guessing is the same as unmount
2009-11-24T11:42:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	so it is a bug then? there should not be duplicate functions. it is confusing.
2009-11-24T11:42:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	where do you see this?
2009-11-24T11:43:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	context menu of removable drive
2009-11-24T11:43:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	nautilis
2009-11-24T11:44:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	hmm.. indeed.. I get both unmount and "safely remove" as well.. perhaps there is some small difference
2009-11-24T11:45:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	I'm guessing any will work.. if anything I think "safely remove" might be a little more safe in some hidden, secret way =)
2009-11-24T11:47:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	then I would go with unmount .. that should only affect the file system.. not the usb device itself
2009-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	have you used PlayOnLinux? I ran sims 3 flawlessly, it is awesome
2009-11-24T12:55:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	for playing games there just isn't a good alternative.. wine is a very nice effort and major kudos to them for all the work they've done.. but they still have a lot of ground to cover before you can even say that 50% of all the windows apps works the same way in wine as in windows
2009-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	I've used wine, which playonlinux is based on.. unless they've done some serious rewriting they won't be that much different
2009-11-24T12:58:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	yes, they have done a heck of a lot of work, you should give it a serious try before you bash it. they have a database of games and very specific wine config options per-game. it is very spiffy
2009-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	it's still wine.. no matter how much makeup you put on it
2009-11-24T13:00:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	indus: both of you are talking without experience of the product i am referencing. it does use wine, but i am here to tell you my 3d game for windows ran flawlessly with full 3d and surround sound on ubuntu jaunty
2009-11-24T13:06:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	look.. this discussion isn't really going anywhere.. perhaps #winehq or #ubuntu-offtopic might be a better place
2009-11-24T13:07:00.000Z	osirisx11	Slart	but...but he said..he wants to use windows.. :(
2009-11-24T13:07:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	this isn't a linux advocacy channel.. it's ubuntu support..
2009-11-24T13:08:00.000Z	Slart	osirisx11	you can try to convert him in the offtopic channel
