2006-12-17T09:18:00.000Z	angel12		hey guys, i have a problem with my resolv.conf file. every time i reboot i have to edit it and delete a line in it, other wise i get dns errors
2006-12-17T09:18:00.000Z	angel12		is there any way to fix it so i dont have to do it every reboot?
2006-12-17T09:20:00.000Z	angel12		any ideas guys? i have to edit my resolv.conf file every reboot as it is right now
2006-12-17T09:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	u using dhcp?
2006-12-17T09:21:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	yeah
2006-12-17T09:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	well the trouble is the dhcp server is giving you a bogus dns address - maybe that server's down atm?
2006-12-17T09:22:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	my dhcp server is my router, and that is being set in my resolv.conf every boot for my nameserver, and there is another entry in there too
2006-12-17T09:22:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	which is?
2006-12-17T09:23:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	its like 205.something, and thats the one i leave in there, and comment out 192.168.0.1
2006-12-17T09:23:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	and the 192. is your router?
2006-12-17T09:23:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	yeah
2006-12-17T09:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	yeah, what's happening is your router is sending both dns addresses - any way to turn that off on the router? (the 205. comes from the router's own dhcp)
2006-12-17T09:24:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	no clue let me check, its a crappy dsl modem with a wireless router lol
2006-12-17T09:27:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	i cant find anything about that
2006-12-17T09:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	is there a checkbox for caching dns queries? try turning it of & restart everything
2006-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	could it be NAT (name address translation)
2006-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	no, you need nat unless you have a static ip
2006-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	angel12	frogzoo	then i dont see anything for dns
2006-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	angel12	k, well look for a firmware upgrade for your router
