2007-09-14T11:10:00.000Z	n3tfury	Moduliz0r__	what's the problem
2007-09-14T11:11:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__	n3tfury	I'm in Ubuntu Live CD and I need to burn an ISO image, but I have 2 CD drives
2007-09-14T11:12:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__	n3tfury	And the default CD creator seems to fail on any CD
2007-09-14T11:12:00.000Z	n3tfury	Moduliz0r__	are you specifically telling it to burn an ISO image?
2007-09-14T11:12:00.000Z	n3tfury	Moduliz0r__	not a boot cd, etc
2007-09-14T11:12:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__		yes I right click the iso and select open with CD creator
2007-09-14T11:12:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__		it's actually a Ubuntu ISO
2007-09-14T11:13:00.000Z	n3tfury	Moduliz0r__	with the app open, choose burn iso instead
2007-09-14T11:13:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__		how about xfburn?
2007-09-14T11:13:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__		K3B?
2007-09-14T11:13:00.000Z	n3tfury		yeah, i don't recall the default burner gui :)
2007-09-14T11:14:00.000Z	n3tfury		k3b is what i use

2007-09-14T11:15:00.000Z	Moduliz0r__		I only have one spare blank disc, so if this buggers up I won't be happy, because I don't have a working OS on my HDD right now
2007-09-14T11:16:00.000Z	n3tfury	Moduliz0r__	well, good luck. i just used it on 7.04 Ubuntu about an hour ago to burn this Sabayon live cd which i'm on right now.
