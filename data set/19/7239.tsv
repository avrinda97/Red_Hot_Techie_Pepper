2008-07-15T11:59:00.000Z	binskipy2u		i reinstalled it
2008-07-15T11:59:00.000Z	binskipy2u		i uninstalled it
2008-07-15T11:59:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	y not trying to reinstall openoffice.org using synaptic?
2008-07-15T12:02:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	sudo apt-get remove --purge openoffice.org
2008-07-15T12:02:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	b4 u do that
2008-07-15T12:03:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	do sudo apt-get install openoffice.org
2008-07-15T12:03:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	then do the purge command i gave b4 then do sudo apt-get install openoffice.org again see if that works
2008-07-15T12:04:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	if ur in a rush and need an office suit right away u can temporarily use abiword for typed stuff and gnumeric for excel stuff
2008-07-15T12:06:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	i dont think so, if its new, reboot ur live cd check it for errors then use it in live cd mode to see if openoffice.org works and if it does then reinstall and since its a new install u wont have anything to lose
2008-07-15T12:10:00.000Z	s3a	binskipy2u	im sry but think of it in the positive way, ur comp will still be usable wile ur reinstalling
