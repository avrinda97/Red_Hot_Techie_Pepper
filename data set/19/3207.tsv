2010-05-08T04:48:00.000Z	pfifo		ok this is really messed up, i have an audio cd  in my cdrom drive but cannot access it through /dev/cdrom, Ive always used /dev/cdrom for as long as i can remember. but seeing as this is an audio CD it appears to be a different situation. what is happening?
2010-05-08T04:49:00.000Z	pfifo		please help, this has been a major headache for me over the last 6 months
2010-05-08T04:51:00.000Z	pfifo		how can i copy an audio cd from the command line?
2010-05-08T04:52:00.000Z	pfifo		OR how can i copy an audio cd with only a single mouse click? my mom is an areobics instructor and cannot handle copying her cds with linux if it requires more than 2 clicks of the mouse
2010-05-08T04:53:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	thats all it is..  right click, copy
2010-05-08T04:53:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	if its too much to right click make iso, right click iso, burn.. then good luck in windows.
2010-09-13T02:52:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	without persistence, no it wont..
2010-09-13T02:53:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	you can add stuff, and then mount -a
2010-09-13T02:53:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	 but its lost on reboot, without persistence.
2010-09-13T02:55:00.000Z	pfifo	duffydack	r007, what i want todo is have it mount my thumbdrives second partition as /home. Im doing the livecd customization and am nervous cause it appears fstab is only a placeholder (im expecting it to be overwritten) (im booting using grub2's loopback feature)
2010-09-13T02:58:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	why not just install ubuntu to the thumbdrive..
2010-09-13T02:59:00.000Z	pfifo	duffydack	im working with a 1gb drive, the squashfs is allowing me to have LOTS of extras, in fact i dont even think it would let me install to a 1gb drive
2010-09-13T03:00:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	so just make the usb with usb-creator and with persistence?
2010-09-13T03:01:00.000Z	pfifo	duffydack	can you give me a link to that? Ive heard of it but never tried it (i really dont want packages updating and such, i really only want persistance on /home)
2010-09-13T03:02:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	what OS you using
2010-09-13T03:02:00.000Z	pfifo	duffydack	10.04.1 LiveCD (i have no hdd til seagate sends it back)
2010-09-13T03:03:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	ah ok.. well should still work.   its in System/Admin - Startup Disk Creator
2010-09-13T03:04:00.000Z	pfifo	duffydack	im assuming i can customize a livecd and still use startup disk but with my CD?
2010-09-13T03:04:00.000Z	duffydack	pfifo	erase it so it makes 1 fat32 partition, then choose your iso to make it from, and how much (probably maximum) persistence.
