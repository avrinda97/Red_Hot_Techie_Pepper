2007-06-20T13:37:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	eth0:0 = ip public, eth0:1 = ip locak ?
2007-06-20T13:37:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	eth0:0 = ip public, eth0:1 = ip local ?
2007-06-20T13:37:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	yo2k	i don't know your setup. but you have one link from the internet router, and one more link to the box which you want to provide internet access with, so this makes already two NICs
2007-06-20T13:38:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	yes, but i use 1 nic ...
2007-06-20T13:39:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	yo2k	you can't stick two cable connectors into one NIC, right?
2007-06-20T13:40:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	yes, eth0:0, eth0:1 = can up twice ?
2007-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	yo2k	your interface is eth0, with eth0:0  and eth0:1 you will already have three interfaces
2007-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	no, i have 1 nic, i want to share internet...
2007-06-20T13:42:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	yo2k	how do you get internet to your primary box?
2007-06-20T13:42:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	i joint with 1 switch
2007-06-20T13:43:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	or i use a different segment
2007-06-20T13:43:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	yo2k	what's the problem with buying a $5 NIC ?
2007-06-20T13:45:00.000Z	yo2k	HowardTheCoward	$5 = no problem, wait 4-5 days it's problem... i try  that... thank's ...
