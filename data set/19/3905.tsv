2009-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	I asked you a question twice, if you're looking for help, it's considered general politeness to answer questions people ask you in order to be able to help you
2009-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	ok
2009-05-14T07:57:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	you were able to mount it from command line, so I assumed your problem was solved?
2009-05-14T07:58:00.000Z	SydneyGuy	blizzkid_	: I will reboot .. maybe .. it will change
2009-05-14T08:00:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	what do you mean with "still root"?
2009-05-14T08:01:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	are you mounting it as root in the terminal?
2009-05-14T08:02:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	so you mounted it as root...
2009-05-14T08:02:00.000Z	blizzkid_	SydneyGuy	try to mount it without sudo in the terminal
