2006-12-27T13:33:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	gksudo camorama
2006-12-27T13:33:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 same message
2006-12-27T13:34:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	does it launch though, I know gksudo gedit gives that same warning but always launches
2006-12-27T13:35:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 yeah but it says could not connect with video device (/dev/video0)
2006-12-27T13:37:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	that sounds like it might be an error with the program, not gksudo
2006-12-27T13:38:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 ok thanks i will try with another driver
2007-04-02T12:18:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	hoary wow. sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/whatever /mount/point
2007-04-02T12:24:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 it says kind of filesystem unrecognized
2007-04-02T12:24:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	well your cd is messed up then
2007-04-02T12:25:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 so what can i do?
2007-04-02T12:25:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	get a cd that isn't screwed up
2007-04-02T12:25:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 but that cd works
2007-04-02T12:25:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	clearly it does not
2007-04-02T12:26:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 i could install dapper with that cd on yesterday
2007-04-02T12:26:00.000Z	bruenig	gRaCiOsO	perhaps it corrupted, but I can tell you that iso9660 is the cd filesystem
2007-04-02T12:27:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 ok thanks
2007-04-02T12:27:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	bruenig	 i know the problem is the kernel now
