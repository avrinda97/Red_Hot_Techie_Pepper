2008-05-05T01:57:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		what is the resolution  you are using Fezzler
2008-05-05T01:58:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		from what i can see the login screen resolution is set to "Virtual 1280    960"
2008-05-05T01:58:00.000Z	Fezzler	jaffarkelshac	Right now in GNOME it is 1024x768@57HZ.  But login looks like 640x480 or 800x600 because image is huge
2008-05-05T01:59:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Fezzler	change Virtual 1280    960 to 1024 768
2008-05-05T02:00:00.000Z	Fezzler	jaffarkelshac	done
2008-05-05T02:00:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		logoff to see if it worked Fezzler
2008-05-05T02:01:00.000Z	Fezzler	jaffarkelshac	can I check somehow without loggin out / off irc?
2008-05-05T02:01:00.000Z	Fezzler	jaffarkelshac	do I need to reboot or restart something?
2008-05-05T02:01:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		no Fezzler, just restart
2008-05-05T02:01:00.000Z	Fezzler	jaffarkelshac	see you in a bit with the results
