2008-07-28T20:19:00.000Z	ndumac		could someone help me figure out how to set the environment variable for a systems NIC ?
2008-07-28T20:20:00.000Z	ndumac		I have a single computer which i'm cloning out to 20 other computers, and want the environment variable to contain each systems unique MAC
2008-07-28T20:21:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	macs are hardware driven, software shouldnt affect it, unless you have a script for macchanger to run on your current machine that sets it to a custom mac
2008-07-28T20:22:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	what application (out of curiosity) are you using to clone your current installation for redistribution on your other machines?
2008-07-28T20:22:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	clonezilla
2008-07-28T20:22:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	i don't want a custom MAC, i intend to use aircrack-ng to crack WEP for a class
2008-07-28T20:23:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	and i need to hardcode the scripts, so they just click them and they run, the scripts require the mac address of each computer, for fake authentication
2008-07-28T20:23:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	so i was thinking to put in the script to pull the MAC from the environment and use the $var in the script
2008-07-28T20:24:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	well if you type ifconfig eth0 | grep -i HWaddr you get the mac address for your eth0 device
2008-07-28T20:24:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	maybe if you set your script to read for the xx:xx:xx:xx format from that output, you can have it set it to that #?
2008-07-28T20:25:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	yeah I could try that
2008-07-28T20:25:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	i could use sed
2008-07-28T20:25:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	ever use that ?
2008-07-28T20:25:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	sorry, i haven't, actually i'm code stupid, i have no idea how to code
2008-07-28T20:25:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	i wish i could though lol
2008-07-28T20:26:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	haha, it's alright, i'm more of a hw guy myself, but it pays to know code
2008-07-28T20:26:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	actually im not even into computers -__-; i'm a psychology major...
2008-07-28T20:27:00.000Z	ndumac	m0u5e	i'm a psych 'minor' :)
2008-07-28T20:27:00.000Z	m0u5e	ndumac	hehe
