2007-02-03T09:22:00.000Z	James		hi folks, I need a hand here
2007-02-03T09:24:00.000Z	James		trying to save a document and I'm getting: 'You do not have the permissions necessary to save the file.'
2007-02-03T09:24:00.000Z	unop	James	 into which directory are you trying to save that file?
2007-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	unop	James	 errm, whats the full path?
2007-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	James	unop	/etc/udev/rules.d/45-libgphoto2.rules
2007-02-03T09:26:00.000Z	unop	James	 ahh yes, that directory does not belong to you (the user) .. save the file somewherre else temporarily and then copy it over to /etc/udev/rules.d/45-libgphoto2.rules later as superuser
2007-02-03T09:27:00.000Z	James	unop	do I login as superuser?
2007-02-03T09:27:00.000Z	unop	James	 you dont have to -- you can use this command -- sudo cp /path/to/file /etc/udev/rules.d/45-libgphoto2.rules
2007-02-03T09:39:00.000Z	unop	James	 yes if /home/james/Desktop/45-libgphoto2.rules is the file you downloaded :)
2007-02-03T09:40:00.000Z	unop	James	 I'd use this instead  sudo cp /home/james/Desktop/45-libgphoto2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
2007-02-03T09:43:00.000Z	James	unop	doesn't seem to be working...
2007-02-03T09:44:00.000Z	unop	James	 errm, ok, first make sure the downloaded file exists -- ls -l ~/Desktop/45-libgphoto2.rules
2007-02-03T09:45:00.000Z	James	unop	sure does.
2007-02-03T09:45:00.000Z	unop	James	 sorry, i should have asked what error messages (if any) that command gave you
2007-02-03T09:46:00.000Z	James	unop	nothing, just back to james@James-Desktop:~$
2007-02-03T09:46:00.000Z	unop	James	ahh, it means the command was successful :)
2007-02-03T09:47:00.000Z	unop	James	verify the file exists at its new location -- ls -l /etc/udev/rules.d/
2007-02-03T09:48:00.000Z	James	unop	thankyou :)
2007-02-03T09:48:00.000Z	unop	James	 yw (if it worked) :)
