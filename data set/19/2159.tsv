2010-06-11T18:35:00.000Z	Snadder		Hi.. I installed ubuntu 10.04 with grub2 (previously had debian lenny with grub1).. Now I booted to a grub 15 error.. Anyone know how to fix it?
2010-06-11T18:36:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	do you have a live CD?
2010-06-11T18:36:00.000Z	Zenith77		If so could you post (not in the IRC channel) from boot/grub/grub.conf
2010-06-11T18:37:00.000Z	Snadder	Zenith77	DO I need that?.. I have a ubuntu 10.04 server cd.
2010-06-11T18:38:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	most installation CD's will act like a live cd
2010-06-11T18:38:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	unless you customized it in some way, so just boot from that
2010-06-11T18:39:00.000Z	Snadder	Zenith77	okok.. How do I correct it after I boot from it?
2010-06-11T18:40:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	well, AFAIK, error 15 is a file not found error. It may be something in grub.conf or another grub configuration file
2010-06-11T18:40:00.000Z	Zenith77		or even grub.conf itself >.>
2010-06-11T18:41:00.000Z	Snadder	Zenith77	I think I saw this error as a common thing with ubuntu 10.04.. in a FAQ.
2010-06-11T18:41:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	I'd look over it myself and post it to pastebin and post it here so anyone can take a gander at it and spot something out of place in the configuration file
2010-06-11T18:41:00.000Z	Snadder	Zenith77	its a plain default grub.conf..
2010-06-11T18:41:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	link?

2010-06-11T18:43:00.000Z	Zenith77	Snadder	the solution says to reinstall from a live CD :) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20from%20LiveCD
