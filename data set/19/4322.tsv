2009-04-24T23:18:00.000Z	maco	oz1	what hardware are you using ndiswrapper for?
2009-04-24T23:18:00.000Z	maco	oz1	if it's for broadcom wireless, there are native drivers
2009-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	oz1	maco	I have a internal wirless card i am trying to get to connect to the internet so i don't have hard wire.
2009-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	maco	oz1	you dont have a hard wire at all?
2009-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	oz1	maco	it is for broadcom sir.
2009-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	oz1	maco	i installed the bcx-fwcutter still nothing
2009-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	maco	oz1	do you have the windows driver on hand?
2009-04-24T23:21:00.000Z	oz1	maco	no i completely installed ubuntu so i have nothing.
2009-04-24T23:21:00.000Z	maco	oz1	fwcutter means "firmware cutter"...it pulls the firmware from your windows driver. if you were online with a wire when you installed it, it wouldve downloaded the driver and done it for you
2009-04-24T23:21:00.000Z	maco	oz1	can you *get* the windows driver?
2009-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	oz1	maco	i dunno where i would, or what it is at that.
2009-04-24T23:22:00.000Z	maco	oz1	go to the website of whatever company makes your computer, and get the wireless driver there. then someone can walk you through using fwcutter on it
2009-04-24T23:23:00.000Z	oz1	maco	okay here we go...
2009-04-24T23:29:00.000Z	oz1	maco	if your still here, i have the drivers on my desktop they are .exe what's the next step?
2009-04-24T23:30:00.000Z	maco	oz1	this is where i stop, because i've never had to manually use fwcutter. i'm sure someone else here knows how to use it though
2009-04-24T23:30:00.000Z	oz1	maco	what is the question i should be asking?
