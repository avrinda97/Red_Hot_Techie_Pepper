2006-11-08T17:20:00.000Z	jadacyrus		I'm pretty sure I need the linux-restricted-modules to get some of my devices working such as my webcam
2006-11-08T17:20:00.000Z	jadacyrus		if you read above i said, when you install linux-restricted-modules is breaks nvidia driver
2006-11-08T17:21:00.000Z	jadacyrus		im on edgy w/ nvidia 9625 beta btw
2006-11-08T17:21:00.000Z	jadacyrus		If I use the nvidia-glx drivers from the repo's...can I have the restricted modules installed?
2006-11-08T06:08:00.000Z	jadacyrus		Can someone help me get my logitech quickcam working?..its listed under lsusb, but camorama and other programs dont recognize it
2006-11-08T06:08:00.000Z	sethk	jadacyrus	probably you need to load a kernel module
2006-11-08T06:08:00.000Z	sethk	jadacyrus	lsusb will see it at the vendor id/device id level, without kernel support, but the programs won't see it without kernel support
2006-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	jadacyrus	sethk	do you know what kernel module i need to load?
2006-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	sethk	jadacyrus	I already answered that question
2006-11-08T06:17:00.000Z	jadacyrus	sethk	you just said i need to load some kernel module..probably..thankyou for your input really..However im not sure what that kernel module is, so im asking to anyoen else who might give me some help
2006-11-08T06:18:00.000Z	sethk	jadacyrus	if what you need to do is load a kernel module, you can ask all day, but nothing will happen until you figure out how to load a kernel module
2006-11-08T06:18:00.000Z	jadacyrus	sethk	i know how to load a kernel module,..i just dont know which one..thankyou
2006-11-08T06:19:00.000Z	jadacyrus	sethk	your not the end all to my search for help pal
2006-11-08T06:19:00.000Z	sethk	jadacyrus	your time to waste.
2006-11-08T06:19:00.000Z	jadacyrus	sethk	im not wasting time if im still trying to find out which module to load am I?
2006-11-08T06:20:00.000Z	jadacyrus	sethk	its people like you who turn away new users to linux..stop acting self-righteous
2006-11-08T06:21:00.000Z	sethk	jadacyrus	well, my humblest apologies for trying to help you.
