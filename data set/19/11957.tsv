2005-11-06T14:30:00.000Z	cyphase		what was that study done that said it would cost 1 billion something dollars to make a certain open source program in a company?
2005-11-06T14:30:00.000Z	cyphase		it wasn't linux..
2005-11-06T14:32:00.000Z	cyphase		CaBLGuY, yes
2005-11-06T14:32:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	cyphase	 just a little, or all around??
2005-11-06T14:33:00.000Z	cyphase		CaBLGuY, much more then enough to consider upgrading
2005-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	cyphase	 ok, how bout this, streaming audio, and video codecs??   that's the two main problems I was having with hedghog...
2005-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	cyphase	CaBlGuY	there's a guide to enabling them
2005-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	cyphase		when you install it
2005-11-06T14:35:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	cyphase	of corse there is, just like theres a guide for everything else..  what im saying is, how much more "automated" is it in Breezy??
2005-11-06T14:36:00.000Z	cyphase	CaBlGuY	it's not automated..
2005-11-06T14:36:00.000Z	cyphase		you still have to follow the guide
2005-11-06T14:36:00.000Z	cyphase		but it works flawlessly
2005-11-06T14:36:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	cyphase	 so, I would have to basically set them up manualy.. is what yur saying..  and for a noob like me, that's a bit daunting at times..
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	cyphase	CaBlGuY	yes, and it's easy
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	cyphase		just do what it tells you to do
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	cyphase		you don't have to know any "third-party" info
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	cyphase	 ok,. so I'll DL breezy and go form there..
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	cyphase		yea
2005-11-06T14:37:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	cyphase	ok, I'll be back..  for more n00b help.  :p
