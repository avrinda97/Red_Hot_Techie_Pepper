2004-11-03T12:54:00.000Z	sabmoc		ok, totem wont play mpeg's.. thats a weird default behavior
2004-11-03T12:56:00.000Z	sabmoc		how do i get mpeg to work?
2004-11-03T12:57:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	did you try totem-xine?
2004-11-03T12:57:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	i tried playing it in totem if thats what you mean, yes
2004-11-03T12:58:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	totem-gstreamer or totem-xine
2004-11-03T13:00:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	totem-gstreamer is installed and i guess thats what i was using, but i noticed libxine wasnt installed, so i installed that but still mpeg's wont work.
2004-11-03T13:01:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	just for giggles, try uninstalling totem-gstreamer and installing totem-xine from universe
2004-11-03T13:01:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	mplayer is good too
2004-11-03T13:02:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	there's a good howto on www.ubuntuforums.org for mplayer
2004-11-03T13:02:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	when i search the datebase in synaptic there is no totem-xine
2004-11-03T13:02:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	do you have universe enabled?
2004-11-03T13:03:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=179
2004-11-03T13:04:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	ok, before i do that, what is universe?
2004-11-03T13:05:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	a repository of unsupported apps from the debian repositories
2004-11-03T13:08:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	ok, uninstalling totem-gstreamer also wants to uninstall ubuntu-desktop. That sounds bad.
2004-11-03T13:13:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	did it work?
2004-11-03T13:13:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	yep
2004-11-03T13:14:00.000Z	sabmoc	rancoras	i had to uninstall libxine1 and uninstall totem-xine, but then i reinstalled them both and it worked find
2004-11-03T13:14:00.000Z	rancoras	sabmoc	good deal
