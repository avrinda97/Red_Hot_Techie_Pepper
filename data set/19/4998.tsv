2008-09-20T08:58:00.000Z	isabel__		how can i edit the bios options from ubuntu so it chooses to boot directly from hard drive everytime when i press f12 it asks from which device i want to boot from but what i want is to jump to grub right from start off
2008-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	isabel__		i installed an stripped down version of ubuntu, right now i'm installing kubuntu
2008-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	isabel__		i can't do a clean install
2008-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	isabel__		when the computer boots up it shows a screen that says toshiba and press f12 to go to bios, there i can choose to boot from the hard drive and the grub starts
2008-09-20T09:02:00.000Z	isabel__		the boot up screen only offers f12 and i think f6 did the same thing as f12 but otherwise how do i get to the bios configuration
2008-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	isabel__		ok once i do that what do i have to do?

2008-09-20T09:04:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	i never made ubuntu unaccesible
2008-09-20T09:04:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	i never touched linux in my life, and neither vista nor ubuntu was unaccessable
2008-09-20T09:05:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	are you using livecd now?
2008-09-20T09:06:00.000Z	isabel__	badfish	nope, its already installed but after installation it looked like it was expecting a cd because if i dont go tot he prompt and ask for it to boot from hard disk it says something along the lines of incorrect system disk insert disk and press any key to continue
2008-09-20T09:06:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	it definitely does not say "error 17: cannot mount selected partition," correct?
2008-09-20T09:07:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	do you have a flash usb drive plugged in when you boot?
2008-09-20T09:08:00.000Z	isabel__	badfish	nope it doesnt say that, and no i dont have a flash driver plugged in when i boot up
2008-09-20T09:08:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	is ubuntu on a separate hard drive disk?
2008-09-20T09:09:00.000Z	isabel__	badfish	nope
2008-09-20T09:09:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	so you haven't installed ubuntu yet?
2008-09-20T09:11:00.000Z	badfish	isabel__	native language?
