2012-03-08T01:05:00.000Z	_enigma_		hi, I can't open pdfs because programs seem to want something in wine to open it, default afaik is set to evince
2012-03-08T01:07:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	are you trying to open the pdf from some windows program running under wine or from the file manager?
2012-03-08T01:08:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	Referencer, previously firefox
2012-03-08T01:10:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	gnome-open seems to work fine loading evince, but for some reason Referencer will only go through wine, I just fixed a similiar issue with Firefox
2012-03-08T01:14:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	maybe the type pdf is associated for some reason in .local/share/applications/mimeapps.list with the wrong application?
2012-03-08T01:16:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	application/pdf=evince.desktop
2012-03-08T01:17:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	and if you click on a pdf in the file manager it gets correctly opened with evince?
2012-03-08T01:18:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	yup, seems to be more or less application specific and there are no options in the program (unlike FF) to change the default
2012-03-08T01:19:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	can you ask the referencer guys then? i wasn't even aware that this program exists
2012-03-08T01:20:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	or try to look up if a configuration file exists. something like ~/.referencer perhaps?
2012-03-08T01:22:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	no ~/.referencer
2012-03-08T01:22:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	and in ~/.local/ ?
2012-03-08T01:23:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	not that I can find
2012-03-08T01:25:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	you can go also the hard route and try to figure out which files get opened by referencer with "lsof" or "strace". but you have to filter out a lot of information until you get to the file you need...
2012-03-08T01:26:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	if you decide to do this it might be even easier to obtain the source code and look it up there
2012-03-08T01:27:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	probably
2012-03-08T01:27:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	I was hoping it was just something I had missed since I recently had a similar issue with FireFox, thought the cause may have been the same
2012-03-08T01:28:00.000Z	velko_	_enigma_	maybe. i really don't know. sorry that i cannot help you with this
2012-03-08T01:28:00.000Z	_enigma_	velko_	thanks for trying none the less
