2005-06-19T06:35:00.000Z	haris		When running dhclient I get "No DHCPOFFERS Received. No working leases in persistent database -- sleep"... any idea what I could do?
2005-06-19T06:35:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	try sudo mii-diag eth0 (or whatever your interface is) and see whether it says "You have link beat"
2005-06-19T06:37:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	it brings up a load of other info, but it doesn't say that, nope.
2005-06-19T06:38:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	does it say "   Link status: not established."
2005-06-19T06:39:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	yup
2005-06-19T06:39:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	then check your physical connection to the network, something goes wrong there
2005-06-19T06:44:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	I don't think that's it (just triple-checked it), since this came as a result of someone playing around with the network details
2005-06-19T06:45:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	I originally did a dhclient which fixed it just fine, but the computer restarted later and when it came up dhclient wasn't working
2005-06-19T06:45:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	as in, there was no messing with the physical connection, at all, and it was working before, so I'd presume the problem wasn't there...
2005-06-19T06:46:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	well, if mii-diag say "Link status: not establshed" there is a problem with the physical connection...
2005-06-19T06:48:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	I find that hard to believe since it's always worked fine, but I may try switching the cable later. Thanks for your help. :)
2005-06-19T06:49:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	are many people on breezy?
2005-06-19T06:49:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	no
2005-06-19T06:50:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	ah, just read topic...not recommended. Any date for when users should try it out?
2005-06-19T06:51:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	not yet, there are 3 major transitions going on. After these have finished, it's time to try out
2005-06-19T06:51:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	excellent, great stuff. No rest for Ubuntu devs ;-).
2005-06-19T06:52:00.000Z	Seveas	haris	amarok leads to kde, kde leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering
2005-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	kde leads to fear? I've always imagined kde-land as a happy place filled with joy
2005-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	haris	Seveas	while I kind of imagine myself as too powerful/big for gnomes
