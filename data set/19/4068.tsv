2009-03-31T06:20:00.000Z	RedMushroom		can anyone help me with some install issues?
2009-03-31T06:21:00.000Z	RedMushroom		:(
2009-03-31T06:23:00.000Z	RedMushroom		ok, well, i'm trying to install onto a really old box, and i can't get it to boot of the cd-rom. it bios menus say it allows it, but it's just not doing it. when i go into win98 on the box and double click on the cd rom icon it says device not ready, like there's nothing in there. i don't know what's going on w/ it. when i disable the h/d from booting, and leave it with only the cd-rom it says "operating system not found"
2009-03-31T06:24:00.000Z	RedMushroom		it's good. works on my other computer. but the other one is newer
2009-03-31T06:25:00.000Z	RedMushroom		oh. you know this for a fact?
2009-03-31T06:25:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	maybe reburn it at slower speed ?
2009-03-31T06:25:00.000Z	RedMushroom	Mean_Admin	already tried that
2009-03-31T06:26:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	anything else booting ? cd-rom unbroken ?
2009-03-31T06:27:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	ok but on old pc, other cds boot  ? it's not some pata conflict or someting ?
2009-03-31T06:28:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	ok by cd rom, I mean optical drive, the thing in which you put your ubuntu disk,
2009-03-31T06:28:00.000Z	RedMushroom	Mean_Admin	yeah
2009-03-31T06:28:00.000Z	RedMushroom	Mean_Admin	go on
2009-03-31T06:28:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	it's okay you say ?
2009-03-31T06:29:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	I've had some brake on me and I've chased the culprit a lot of time before realizing that was the culprit
2009-03-31T06:29:00.000Z	RedMushroom	Mean_Admin	don't know. need to find another disk to test with it. when in win98 if i do "eject cd" it'll open the tray, so assuming it's good
2009-03-31T06:29:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	ok just saying, my cd-rw randomly stopped reading any CDs at some point..
2009-03-31T06:40:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	damn indeed
2009-03-31T06:43:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	you could be brave and boot off USB key although.. I  don't know.. can the old box handle usb boot ?
2009-03-31T06:46:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	RedMushroom	this is scary... can't you just use the cdrom off the good computer, just for the install ?!
