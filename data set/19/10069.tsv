2006-08-05T16:28:00.000Z	ttyfscker		unfun:: you need some plugins then.. try automatix or easyubuntu...  automatix works.. but for some reason the higher powers in here dont like it..  i prefer it over easyubuntu myself
2006-08-05T16:29:00.000Z	ttyfscker		boing757895445:: soft sym link
2006-08-05T16:29:00.000Z	ttyfscker		noiesmo:: i havent seen any problems with it
2006-08-05T16:31:00.000Z	ttyfscker		boing757895445:: yes you can just ln -s /source/path/  /destination/path/
2006-08-05T16:31:00.000Z	ttyfscker		boing757895445:: sorry i meant for that to be for abo
2006-08-05T16:32:00.000Z	ttyfscker		cowmilk:: good luck
2006-08-05T16:32:00.000Z	ttyfscker		cowmilk:: if gtkpod isnt good enough py gpod sure as hell wont be
2006-08-05T16:33:00.000Z	ttyfscker		abo:: im not quiet sure what your doing.. but with a symbolic link on a ntfs partition it is going to retain its same permissions in its destination path
2006-08-05T16:34:00.000Z	ttyfscker		abo:: and that is going to default to ro
2006-08-05T16:34:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	well, gtkpod is good enough. i just need podcast support, and if i can install python-gpod, then gpodder can directly sync podcasts into my iPod.
2006-08-05T16:37:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	exactly.
2006-08-05T16:38:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	i have gtkpod. but how do i get gtkpod to upload my podcasts into my iPod?
2006-08-05T16:38:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	well, not really the same way.
2006-08-05T16:39:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	ok. here's what i do. i use gpodder to download the podcasts into a folder. but that folder begins with .config.
2006-08-05T16:39:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	and gtkpod can't read folders begining with a . (period)
2006-08-05T16:40:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	do you know what i mean?
2006-08-05T16:40:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	ok. i didn't
2006-08-05T16:44:00.000Z	cowmilk	ttyfscker	i can't seem to be able to change the "Download to" folder in gPodder
