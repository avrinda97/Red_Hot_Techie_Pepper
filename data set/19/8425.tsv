2009-05-26T04:11:00.000Z	pH		hey guys
2009-05-26T04:12:00.000Z	pH		i need some help with AWK
2009-05-26T04:13:00.000Z	pH		how can I jump a line before the result of <screen_name> (i mean, in all of the results that I'll get)? My code: awk -F'>' '/<(screen_name|text)>/ { print $2 }' friends_timeline.xml | cut -d'<' -f1
2009-05-26T04:13:00.000Z	pH		ok, thanks, ubottu :)
2009-05-26T04:14:00.000Z	pH		any idea?
2009-05-26T04:15:00.000Z	raylu	pH	sounds like a job for an actual script
2009-05-26T04:15:00.000Z	raylu	pH	maybe; what is it you're trying to do?
2009-05-26T04:16:00.000Z	pH	raylu	Actually, i'm parsing two XML itens using awk :P
2009-05-26T04:23:00.000Z	raylu	pH	also, could you give us the entire xml file?
2009-05-26T04:23:00.000Z	pH	raylu	Yeah
2009-05-26T04:23:00.000Z	raylu	pH	also, your english is good enough that i didn't guess you weren't a native-english speaker
2009-05-26T04:25:00.000Z	raylu	pH	so what was it that you wanted to do again?
2009-05-26T04:25:00.000Z	raylu	pH	do you want to output a modified xml file or just extract it?
2009-05-26T04:27:00.000Z	raylu	pH	no. i have no familiarity with awk, but i was planning on writing a script to do whatever it was you wanted
2009-05-26T04:28:00.000Z	raylu	pH	since parsing xml is generally best done by actually parsing the xml
2009-05-26T04:29:00.000Z	raylu	pH	certainly, but i'm not familiar enough with awk and related tools to do it
2009-05-26T04:29:00.000Z	raylu	pH	if you just describe what you want, though, i can do it for you
2009-05-26T04:33:00.000Z	pH	raylu	its clearly now?
2009-05-26T04:36:00.000Z	raylu	pH	i think so, one sec
