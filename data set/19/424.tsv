2012-03-02T06:08:00.000Z	guyubuntu		Can I install ubuntu on fat32?
2012-03-02T06:08:00.000Z	guyubuntu		so i could access it from windows?
2012-03-02T06:08:00.000Z	guyubuntu		instead of installing it on ext4?
2012-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	guyubuntu		ext4 is the only way to go?
2012-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	guyubuntu		but wubi installs it on ntfs
2012-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	guyubuntu		No
2012-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	guyubuntu		I'm using a live CD
2012-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	guyubuntu		lol
2012-03-02T06:10:00.000Z	guyubuntu		4064 swap space is enough for ubuntu?

2012-03-02T06:10:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	IFS is an option too.
2012-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	wubi installs it to a virtual hard drive (which is ext3 if I recall right), NOT to a NTFS partition
2012-03-02T06:10:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	You have to use a sane filesystem which is compatible with Unix stuff. Actually, you can read extX filesystems from Windows using ext2read
2012-03-02T06:10:00.000Z	guyubuntu	theadmin	ext2read has aids.
2012-03-02T06:11:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	That depends on your RAM. That's more than enough, I'd never do more than 2 gigs personally actually
2012-03-02T06:11:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	Then about 4GB will be fine yeah, might actually make it bit less
2012-03-02T06:14:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	Normally you do separate / and /home
2012-03-02T06:14:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	But that's up to you
2012-03-02T06:14:00.000Z	theadmin	guyubuntu	With a separate /home, reinstalls are a whole ton easier
