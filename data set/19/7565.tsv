2007-08-02T07:54:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	Such as what?
2007-08-02T07:55:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	depending on what you do with it, you're opening up potential security holes, stability problems, or performance issues.
2007-08-02T07:55:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	not saying you shouldn't do it, I don't know what you intend, just that you should keep that tradeoffs in mind.
2007-08-02T07:56:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	performance won't be much of an issue.  The planned hardware will be far more is needed for GigE RAID6.  Security...well...it depends, though it wouldn't be a firewall :)
2007-08-02T07:58:00.000Z	jpdp		I suppose what it comes down to is just how easy/difficult it is to get disk idle spin-down, timed off/on and wake on lan support.  If it is indeed difficult in Ubuntu or debian, then it would indeed not be a good choice.
2007-08-02T08:00:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	timed off/on requires bios support (atleast for the on, a simple script can handle off), wake-on-lan is pretty much the same in all distros if your hardware has good acpi, and there are tools for tweaking disk spin-up/spin-down.
2007-08-02T08:00:00.000Z	jpdp		genii/Falstius: Actually no RAID6 in FreeNAS, so it's out of the picture :)
2007-08-02T08:01:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	you're planning to do software raid?
2007-08-02T08:01:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	Any idea what tools would be used for spin-up/spin-down?
2007-08-02T08:01:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	Yes
2007-08-02T08:01:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	for ide trides, hdparm works.  I can't remember if you just use a switch to get that to work with sata or you use another tool.
2007-08-02T08:01:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	Hardware RAID6 is quite pricy, less extendable, and far slower (if more reliable.)
2007-08-02T08:02:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	is it slower?  At work they used 3ware cards in raid6 to set transatlantic speed records.
2007-08-02T08:04:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	smart raid is typically slower...it's CPU bound, and the CPUs (perhaps except for the top-end ones) certainly can't do what a $70 system CPU can do.
2007-08-02T08:04:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	Esepcially RAID6...that's a lot of calculation.
2007-08-02T08:04:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	they're good machines, but they simply tend not to be as fast.
2007-08-02T08:05:00.000Z	jpdp	Falstius	Also, for 8-12 total drives, that's a LOT of $700 cards :)
2007-08-02T08:06:00.000Z	Falstius	jpdp	or 1 12 port card :)
