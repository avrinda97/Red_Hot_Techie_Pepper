2008-09-12T22:23:00.000Z	gharz		guys, what could be the problem if you are getting "host name not found" when you try to surf? how would i know the hosts settings?
2008-09-12T22:23:00.000Z	KaiForce	gharz	check that your DNS is set right
2008-09-12T22:24:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	i can browse the net when i connect my laptop to the router... but when i use my wireless router i get a host name not found.
2008-09-12T22:25:00.000Z	KaiForce	gharz	if you can't resolve the name (host name not found) then either a) your DNS is wrong/inaccessible or b) you don't have connectivity or c) both
2008-09-12T22:29:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	i have connectivity coz i'm using the same connection with this machine and the other machine which i'm fixing
2008-09-12T22:30:00.000Z	KaiForce	gharz	then you can't see your DNS servers or they aren't set.
2008-09-12T22:30:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	why is it that when i connect the pc through LAN cable i can browse the net... but when i use the wireless it can not. :(
2008-09-12T22:31:00.000Z	KaiForce	gharz	 i would check that dns servers are set when you use wireless (look at /etc/resolv.conf) and the nslookup test.  Also make sure you have a gateway set when in wireless
2008-09-12T22:32:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	when i ran nslookup... Server 192.168.254.254 Address 192.168.254.254#53
2008-09-12T22:32:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	Non-authoritative Answer: www.google.com canonical name = www.l.google.com.
2008-09-12T22:33:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	Name: www.l.google.com Address 64.233.183.99
2008-09-12T22:33:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	those are the details that i got... there are more 4 lines but i didn't include in my above message
2008-09-12T22:34:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	by the way, i'm using links... don't have window manager at the meantime
2008-09-12T22:35:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	that test on the wireless... i can ping my router... i can ping my isp and give the ISP's ip address... but i get Destination Host Unreachable.
2008-09-12T22:35:00.000Z	KaiForce	gharz	i don't know then - maybe something links specific?
2008-09-12T22:35:00.000Z	KaiForce	gharz	trying pinging www.yahoo.com
2008-09-12T22:36:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	PING www.yahoo.com-ht3.akadns.net (87.248..113.14) 56(84) bytes of data. From 192.168.254.18 imcp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
2008-09-12T22:37:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	is it a router problem or my wireless problem?
2008-09-12T22:38:00.000Z	gharz	KaiForce	my laptop ... the one i'm fixing
