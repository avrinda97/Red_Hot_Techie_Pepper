2010-02-26T03:44:00.000Z	alzamabar		Hi, I opened the System Monitor and I can see that 1.3GB is being taken by Ubuntu but I've got hardly anything running. A "top" does show basically no activity. Where is the memory being "eaten"?

2010-02-26T03:45:00.000Z	alzamabar	airtonix	Are you saying that Ubuntu is caching like mad?
2010-02-26T03:45:00.000Z	airtonix	alzamabar	no i am saying memory not used is memory wasted.

2010-02-27T15:08:00.000Z	airtonix	alzamabar	you can reach your web server from same machine using : http://localhost  ?
2010-02-27T15:08:00.000Z	airtonix	alzamabar	then you need to open a port
