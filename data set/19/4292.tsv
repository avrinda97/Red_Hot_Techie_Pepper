2009-05-17T01:49:00.000Z	Daremonai		I'm getting an error: Sense Key : Medium Error [current] [descriptor] in my dmesg (the hard disk in question is NTFS, am trying to back it up, but it keeps freezing) any idea what that error means?
2009-05-17T01:49:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	that actually sounds like a hardware problem, not a partition one. Can you pastebin a bit of context?

2009-05-17T01:52:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	that's the hardware or driver failing, not (just) the partition data being unhappy. If that drive supports smart (most do) running smartctl on it may be interesting.
2009-05-17T01:52:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	I did that last time, and it didn't give any errors
2009-05-17T01:52:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	(also check for obvious problems like loose cables)
2009-05-17T01:53:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	if smart says it's ok I'd suspect either the connection or the drivers
2009-05-17T01:54:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	I'll pastebin smartctl --all /dev/sdb1

2009-05-17T01:59:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	status?
2009-05-17T02:00:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	sorry, was distracted, looking now
2009-05-17T02:02:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	it's running a little hot, and if I skim the output correctly at least one sector is physically bad. Recommend you get any still readable data off the drive asap (utilities like dd_rescue may help)
2009-05-17T02:03:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	alright.. thanks :( :( :( stupid hds!!
2009-05-17T02:03:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	i'll need 750 GBs right?
2009-05-17T02:03:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	you can use that to copy the raw partition around (to a different drive), after which you can hopefully run a standard partition repair utility on the result and recover most data
2009-05-17T02:04:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	you'll need free space on the target drive for the size of the partition(s) you're recovering, yes. So ideally a slightly larger drive so you can copy everything in one go.
2009-05-17T02:04:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	how can I fsck on boot?
2009-05-17T02:04:00.000Z	Daremonai	mzz	I don't have enough space on one drive :(
2009-05-17T02:04:00.000Z	mzz	Daremonai	sorry, that's an ubuntu-specific question I can't answer. Ask the channel. I'm not even currently in ubuntu :)
