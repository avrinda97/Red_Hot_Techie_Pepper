2011-08-14T02:20:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	thanks for the heads up :)
2011-11-08T06:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	hylian	 ccsm toom has settings for it
2011-11-08T06:04:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	thanks, i'll take a look at that.
2011-11-08T06:05:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	google has nothing on "ccsm toom", even when I add ubuntu as one of the keywords.
2011-11-08T06:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	hylian	 you overlooked the bot's !ccsm it said...
2011-11-08T06:07:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	i see, thank you
2012-09-10T19:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	hylian	 and have it appear on the x server?
2012-09-10T19:05:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	yeah, I am trying NOT to go back to control alt f7. I am trying to check something quick, and get back to terminal. switching virtual terminals is rather slow...
2012-09-10T19:06:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	i am also trying to just run the one app, and not switch back to the whole gui, because I would like to use the whole screen..
2012-09-10T19:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	hylian	 somthing like the following may do it 'xhost + localhost' 'export DISPlAY=localhost:0' then 'theappname'   may work
2012-09-10T19:08:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	thanks, I will try that!
2012-09-10T19:10:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	can you send me that again, i accidentally closed my irssi client...??
2012-09-10T19:13:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	sorry I goofed up, and thanks. I'm going to see if i can find that command again on the web. i went to launch leafpad, and killed my irssi via terminator :(
2012-09-10T20:01:00.000Z	hylian	dr_willis	thanks for helping me earlier.
2012-09-10T20:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	hylian	 i aim to please... even if i cant remember the problem. ;)
