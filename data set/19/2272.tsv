2010-10-20T01:23:00.000Z	semitones		is there a way I can put my display to sleep instantly? Via keyboard shortcuts or hot corners or something like that?
2010-10-20T01:23:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	you can lock screen from the session manager on the top right of your screen, by the shutdown.
2010-10-20T01:24:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	tjat
2010-10-20T01:24:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	i guess its ctrl + alt + L
2010-10-20T01:24:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	tjat
2010-10-20T01:24:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	i'm not trying to lock the screen though, I'm just trying to turn off the display to save some battery
2010-10-20T01:25:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	you can open up gnome-power-manager probably
2010-10-20T01:25:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	are you on a laptop
2010-10-20T01:25:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	yes. There are helpful options there, but nothing like a keyboard shortcut or hotcorner that will turn the display off at my command
2010-10-20T01:25:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	personally my laptop has brightness buttons on the function keys
2010-10-20T01:26:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	so does mine, but those dim the display. I want to turn it completely off. Can ubuntu do that?
2010-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	if you turn the brightness all the way off, thats going to be the majority of your battery useage.
2010-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	the blacklight itself takes up more power then the actual display
2010-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	it doesn't go all the way off, it goes dim but not completely off
2010-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	well there is a way by editing a value somewhere in /proc depending on your video card
2010-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	im not sure id go that method unless your fairly advanced
2010-10-20T01:40:00.000Z	semitones	DCGstudios	Aut0ExeC, xilo, the command is xset dpms force standby :D :D :D :D :D
2010-10-20T01:40:00.000Z	DCGstudios	semitones	well done
