2005-04-16T12:11:00.000Z	dazed|		anyone know of a good cd ripping app?
2005-04-16T12:12:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	grip is a nice graphical front end
2005-04-16T12:12:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	sound juicer should already be on your system though
2005-04-16T12:13:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	grip + lame is a nicer combo anyway :)
2005-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	dazed|	yfir	^
2005-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	dazed|	yfir	is glame same as that lame program u were speaking of to use with grip?
2005-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	no
2005-04-16T12:34:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	afaik, glame is a sort of audio editor package, like audacity on steroids
2005-04-16T12:49:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	you set that in the "encode" file format under the config->encode tab
2005-04-16T12:49:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	put something like this in the config -> encode tab: ~/temp/%A - %d (%y)/%t - %n.%x
2005-04-16T12:50:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	if you want them to be encoded in ~/temp for example
2005-04-16T12:52:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	that will put your raw rips (not encoded) to ~/mp3/Artistname/Albumname and create those directories
2005-04-16T12:52:00.000Z	dazed|	yfir	damn...im confused then lol
2005-04-16T12:53:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	you can read about the weird looking configuration switches in the grip help
2005-04-16T12:54:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	it's simple actually. just remember as thoreauputic said, you have separate places for riped and encoded files. you have an option to delete the unencoded files after they've been encoded
2005-04-16T13:09:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	.ogg is basically an open source version of .mp3
2005-04-16T13:14:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	that's one of the primary benefits of linux - eventually you actually understand what it's doing
2005-04-16T13:15:00.000Z	dazed|	yfir	thats a very good point i have caught myself actually understanding errors it gives me and being able to fix them based on the computers response
2005-04-16T13:15:00.000Z	yfir	dazed|	one of the things that drives me crazy about Windows - I don't know what it's doing and there's no way to find out (apart from reverse engineering, but that's beyond my abilities)
