2008-12-23T12:04:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	gparted might be able to help you
2008-12-23T12:04:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	there is some command, I just can't remember it
2008-12-23T12:05:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	there are many many commands.. sudo blkid is another
2008-12-23T12:05:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	or lshw, ls /dev/hd*, fdisk -l
2008-12-23T12:07:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	thanks, trying to reinstall gru from inside ubuntu,
2008-12-23T12:07:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	well that was it, but I cannot get the command ./grub to work
2008-12-23T12:08:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	are you following some kind of howto?
2008-12-23T12:10:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	I followed the guide but when I reboot I get a blue screen, nothing else happens, any ideas?
2008-12-23T12:10:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	you've done this, right? "then change directory to your installation sbin and run grub from there "
2008-12-23T12:11:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	I did the ./grub it said command not found
2008-12-23T12:12:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	did you change directory to /usr/sbin/ before trying to run ./grub?
2008-12-23T12:13:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	I did, at least I thought
2008-12-23T12:14:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	because then you shouldn't have gotten that error, unless you've done something bad to your ubuntu install
2008-12-23T12:14:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	I'm going to redo it, see if the same thing happens
2008-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	sure, let me know how it goes
2008-12-23T12:17:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	still gives me the no such file or directory when I do ./grub, but it might be because I am in root mode maybe
2008-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	KillerOrca	Slart	let me see if more info will help, I had my orginal install, working fine, wanted to move it onto larger HDD, so i used clonezilla, gparted didn't work, got some error on copying the swap partition, tried the new drive anyway, got an infinite grub loop, followed the instuctions at the link with a livecd, rebooted got a blue screen and the within ubuntu instructions don't work
2008-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	Slart	KillerOrca	blue screen? from grub? or from windows?
