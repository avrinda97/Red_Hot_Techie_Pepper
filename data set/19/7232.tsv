2008-01-03T10:02:00.000Z	tuntun		whats the difference between xchat and xchat-gnome in the add/remove window?
2008-01-03T10:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	I believe, xchat-gnome is specifically for the GNOME Environment
2008-01-03T10:07:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	Beagle
2008-01-03T10:08:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	I don't think it's default
2008-01-03T10:08:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	In fact, I know it isn't.
2008-01-03T10:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	It is a known issue.
2008-01-03T10:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	Not sure how long on either count
2008-01-03T10:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	Right click
2008-01-03T10:55:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	You sure it's gutsy and not just compiz?
2008-01-03T10:56:00.000Z	tuntun	PurpZeY	I am suspecting compiz because it always freezes mid transistion, but that would still mean that gutsy was acrashin'
2008-01-03T10:57:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	Is it a total freeze, or you just lose windows borders and things?
2008-01-03T10:58:00.000Z	tuntun	PurpZeY	total freeze, but Borders and this also go missing occasionally without any impact
2008-01-03T10:58:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	The borders thing is easily fixed, right click on the CCSM, hit "reload windows manager"
2008-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	tuntun	PurpZeY	well the titlebar on an newly active window occasionally presents itself as inactive, and the window buttons aren't framed, its not a big nuisance tough.
2008-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	well, that's the fix. . .
2008-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	tuntun	PurpZeY	thnx
2008-04-18T21:04:00.000Z	PurpZeY	tuntun	It's not built in, you'd have to install it. . .Not hard to do...But it also takes time to crawl your files...Won't work for a little bit.
