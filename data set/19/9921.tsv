2006-08-31T11:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	brendonjt	the "ubuntu-desktop" package only matters when it's time to upgrade your Ubuntu - if it's missing the rest of the time, the system doesn't care
2006-09-04T16:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	brendonjt	the CC's page is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda
2006-09-04T16:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	brendonjt	no
2006-09-04T16:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	brendonjt	do you have a question about the CC, or?
2006-09-04T16:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	brendonjt	the CC is only 4 people. There are a number of Ubuntu Members, though - different thing from the CC itself
2006-09-04T16:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	brendonjt	please join #ubuntu-offtopic, this isn't really a tech support question, and -offtopic is quiet right now
