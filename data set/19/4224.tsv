2009-03-01T11:55:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	Does Alt-F2 pop up a "Run Application" window?
2009-03-01T11:56:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	that'd be a problem. Do ctrl-alt-F1 to get to a command line, log in, and do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. That should install everything you removed by removing e-d-s.
2009-03-01T11:59:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	I just provided you with instructions. Do ctrl-alt-F1 to get to a command line, log in, and do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.  That should install everything you removed by removing e-d-s.
2009-03-01T12:45:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#32-bit_color , and no, as far as I know you can't "enable" 32-bit color on Linux.
2009-03-01T12:49:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	and no, considering that 32-bit color essentially /is/ 24-bit color, I've never noticed a difference on Windows (which is the only place I've seen it).
2009-03-01T12:49:00.000Z	lemonsarecool	rww	jeez sorry
2009-03-01T12:50:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	did you read the wikipedia link I sent you?
2009-03-01T12:50:00.000Z	lemonsarecool	rww	what link...
2009-03-01T12:50:00.000Z	rww	lemonsarecool	whatever. 32-bit color depth is basically the same as 24-bit color depth. use 24-bit color depth. it works fine. fin.
