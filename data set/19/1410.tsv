2011-07-25T23:37:00.000Z	iter		hi all, trying to upgrade a dapper box to edgy, getting 404's... I've edited sources.list to point to old-releases but do-release-upgrade still fails with the 'getting prerequisites failed' error. /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log has 404's in it for archive.ubuntu.com
2011-07-25T23:37:00.000Z	iter		I tried just putting old-releases IP as archive.ubuntu.com in /etc/hosts but no joy
2011-07-25T23:38:00.000Z	ThinkT510	iter	both of those are no longer supported
2011-07-25T23:38:00.000Z	iter		hardy is still LTS supported
2011-07-25T23:38:00.000Z	iter		yes I have read that
2011-07-25T23:39:00.000Z	iter		it appears do-release-upgrade still points to archive.ubuntu.com and not old-releases so it blows up
2011-07-25T23:39:00.000Z	iter		I can do it the debian way and just change it to hardy in sources.list but I would rather do it the 'right' way with do-release-upgrade
2011-07-25T23:40:00.000Z	iter		sorry I just realise I said edgy and not hardy in my initial question
2011-07-25T23:40:00.000Z	iter		the upshot of my question is "what is the right way to go dapper to hardy" now that dapper is EOL
2011-07-25T23:41:00.000Z	iter		I can do it the debian way but I just wonder if there is a ubuntu way to handle it
2011-07-25T23:42:00.000Z	iter		no answers?
2011-07-25T23:43:00.000Z	iter		I can't be the only person with this problem, there are a ton of old dapper machines out there still
2011-07-25T23:43:00.000Z	iter		do-release-upgrade has a logfile
2011-07-25T23:44:00.000Z	iter		I will pastebin it one sec
2011-07-25T23:44:00.000Z	iter		http://pastebin.com/1kGeNNcL
2011-07-25T23:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	iter	why didn't you update when dapper was supported?
2011-07-25T23:46:00.000Z	iter	ThinkT510	not my machine, thanks for asking
2011-07-25T23:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	iter	its my guess that the url it is pointing to no longer exists
2011-07-25T23:48:00.000Z	iter	ThinkT510	thanks, I got that from the 404 error
