2007-04-14T06:09:00.000Z	titch	jrib	ok i right click and open with MPlayer, it opens with no errors but doesnt play?
2007-04-14T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	titch	it works here if I use "gmplayer -playlist" as the command, but note that it needs to cache for a few seconds
2007-04-14T06:12:00.000Z	titch	jrib	yes it works via command line... hmm
2007-04-14T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	titch	well, as the command you added to openwith, did you use "gmplayer -playlist"?
2007-04-14T06:13:00.000Z	titch	jrib	no but ill try that now :P
2007-04-14T06:17:00.000Z	titch	jrib	ok that works
2007-04-14T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	titch	ok, now lets fix the browser issue... have you install the mplayer plugin for firefox?
2007-04-14T06:19:00.000Z	titch	jrib	No results found. for gmplayer
2007-04-14T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	titch	install the mozilla-mplayer package
2007-04-14T06:21:00.000Z	titch	jrib	ive installed it.
2007-04-14T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	titch	ok, so remove the totem plugin
2007-04-14T06:23:00.000Z	jrib	titch	can you remove only totem-mozilla?
2007-04-14T06:25:00.000Z	titch	jrib	There is no matching application available.
2007-04-14T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	titch	erm ok, I guess they only put that in later.  close all firefox windows, run this command: 'sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*' and then start firefox again and try bbc
2007-04-14T06:28:00.000Z	titch	jrib	thats worked :)

2007-04-14T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	titch	well you can just go to system > preferences > remote desktop
