2006-07-04T08:54:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	can you paste your /etc/network/interfaces file content to pastebin?  then can you paste lspci output as well?
2006-07-04T08:55:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	I pasted interfaces, it is  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17172 and what is lspci
2006-07-04T08:55:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	a command, try it at the console
2006-07-04T08:55:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	it probably won't work, but...
2006-07-04T09:06:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	are you in vmware?
2006-07-04T09:06:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	no, I am in windows
2006-07-04T09:07:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	hmmm, i dunno then man, sorry
2006-07-04T09:07:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	oh I should also note
2006-07-04T09:08:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	that when my other computer (a kubuntu one) is off, I have internet fine, but when it is on, ubuntu can't get internet, only windows
2006-07-04T09:09:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	say what?
2006-07-04T09:09:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	I have internet in ubuntu when the other comp in the house is off, but when it is on internet only works in windows
2006-07-04T09:10:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	hmmm, is the ubuntu one using dhcp?
2006-07-04T09:10:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	the other one
2006-07-04T09:10:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	I believe so
2006-07-04T09:11:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	if there is an ip address conflict, it could explain the weird behavior
2006-07-04T09:12:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	that is weird man, I'd try checking the ips
2006-07-04T09:13:00.000Z	Reimu	fowlduck	alright, so what would I do if the ips are the same?
2006-07-04T09:13:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	set them manually to something different
2006-07-04T09:13:00.000Z	fowlduck	Reimu	and if they aren't the same, then we've eliminated a possible ssue
