2006-01-17T17:44:00.000Z	StokesTheorem		I probably just walked into something...  but devwal, are you contemplating using an external via FireWire?

2006-01-17T17:45:00.000Z	StokesTheorem		I've been trying to build a boot disk for my USB external, but I've turned up a lot of research simultaniously regarding FireWire.
2006-01-17T17:45:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	he has a mac, he can boot directly from a firewire drive
2006-01-17T17:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	does the initram for ubuntu have firewire modules?
2006-01-17T17:48:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	i'm no expert here, i'm just googling :)
2006-01-17T17:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	since macs allows booting from firewire, half the problem is solved
2006-01-17T17:54:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 Kind of...  But there is value in being able to boot a FireWire external on non-macs too.
2006-01-17T17:54:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	true, no harm in finding out. usb hdd's are cheaper than firewire :)
2006-01-17T06:00:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 I'm still on my quest to make this boot disk, and stumbled across another option.  Can you tell me whether following this (brief) is suicide for a newbie?
2006-01-17T06:03:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	ask away
2006-01-17T06:04:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 Is http://www.neowin.net/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t269145.html suicide for a newbie?  Specifically, can I get away with not having to compile anything (specifically a kernel).
2006-01-17T06:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	interesting, lemme grok
2006-01-17T06:09:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 I'm gonna try working on this a little for the moment.  Where would I find these "modules"?
2006-01-17T06:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	you basically following a procedure like a pxe-install, you could even manage with a floppy i think
2006-01-17T06:14:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 I have no idea what a pxe-install is.  I take it what you just said is a good thing, though.
2006-01-17T06:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	StokesTheorem	basically for a netboot, you install a linux kernel with your ethernet card drivers, boot of it and retrieve the packages from the network. havent gotten it to work yet :)
2006-01-17T06:16:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 *lol*  There are already a ton of generic pre-made boot disks to do precisely that.
2006-01-17T06:17:00.000Z	StokesTheorem	robotgeek	 Right now I've managed to mount initrd, and am able to "look ardound" and tweak things.  I''m supposed to "replace the modules".  Any suggestions?
