2011-11-13T19:19:00.000Z	chroot		hi , who can use kvm with command line
2011-11-13T19:20:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	what's your actual question?
2011-11-13T19:21:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	are you ssh-ing in?
2011-11-13T19:22:00.000Z	chroot	yeats	have you ever installed kvm or qemu on your machine
2011-11-13T19:22:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	can you ssh?  If so, can access the GUI by doing  'ssh -XC user@vm-host' and doing 'virt-manager' once logged in
2011-11-13T19:23:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	I have
2011-11-13T19:23:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	this assumes that the machine you're running has X on it
2011-11-13T19:24:00.000Z	chroot	yeats	i can ssh
2011-11-13T19:26:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	if you do 'ssh -XC' ('X' means add X forwarding, 'C' means compress it)
2011-11-13T19:26:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	and if the machine you're connecting from has X installed
2011-11-13T19:27:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	okay - then give it a go
2011-11-13T19:27:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	:-)
2011-11-13T19:29:00.000Z	chroot	yeats	one more question, if i want to install a VM  through command line? how should i do?
2011-11-13T19:31:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	I haven't used the command line tools all that much actually
2011-11-13T19:31:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	I've used virsh, but only to see what's running
2011-11-13T19:32:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	does it give a reason?
2011-11-13T19:34:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	have you checked permissions?
2011-11-13T19:39:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	you might need to be running it with sudo/gksudo
2011-11-13T19:40:00.000Z	yeats	chroot	in the work environments we (ahem) run virt-manager as root, but that's not recommended practice in this channel ;-)
