2010-03-31T16:04:00.000Z	edgy360		do you think me moving from Vista to Ubuntu would be a good idea?
2010-03-31T16:04:00.000Z	edgy360		IRC, FTP, webdesign
2010-03-31T16:05:00.000Z	edgy360		email, web browsing (e.g. Twitter, facebook)
2010-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	edgy360		I don't have a big enough hdd
2010-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	edgy360		I have had Ubuntu on another computer (slower one) but it seemed great
2010-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	edgy360		80GB
2010-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	Dazzled	edgy360	what kind of webdesign?
2010-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	edgy360		but it came with 2 40GB partions and the main one is full
2010-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	edgy360	Dazzled	just coding and using GIMP
2010-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	Dazzled	edgy360	ah, okay, I guess no .NET apps :p
2010-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	edgy360		Ubuntu is currently running on a live disk now on my laptop and it seems 10x faster than Vista
2010-03-31T16:08:00.000Z	edgy360		would Visual Studio run in Wine because I use it for my work
2010-03-31T16:08:00.000Z	Dazzled	edgy360	I use Eclipse with CDT in Ubuntu (for C++)
2010-03-31T16:09:00.000Z	edgy360		Dazzled would I be able to code C# the same with that? (e.g. visual tools for designing the apps)
2010-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	edgy360		yeah that program
2010-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	Dazzled	edgy360	tbh, I don't know, C# is still very MS oriented
2010-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	Dazzled	edgy360	There's Mono, but that didn't work out to well over here
2010-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	edgy360		I might just use my spare xp laptop for coding and switch the main one to Ubuntu :)
2010-03-31T16:11:00.000Z	Dazzled	edgy360	tbh, I'd advertise a dual boot, especially when being a student
