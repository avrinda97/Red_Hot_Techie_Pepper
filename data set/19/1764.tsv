2011-06-02T22:07:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	stop pasting stuff in the channel like that
2011-06-02T22:07:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	is that a desktop, or a server?
2011-06-02T22:08:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	you need to ugprade, 6.06 isn't supported any longer
2011-06-02T22:09:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	it might be faster to just install 10.04 clean
2011-06-02T22:10:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	given the amount of time it will take to upgrade 6.06 to 8.04, thne 8.04 to 10.04 (so that you have a supported release) it would be faster to just clean install 10.04
2011-06-02T22:11:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	then download and burn it?
2011-06-02T22:12:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	690mb...
2011-06-02T22:13:00.000Z	KM0201	nabi	and if you have a slow connection, the last thing yo'll want to do, is upgrade 6.06, to 8.04, then 8.04 to 10.04
