2006-05-19T09:03:00.000Z	holycow	briguyd	well you share it on xp, then you go to places / network servers and click on the share
2006-05-19T09:04:00.000Z	holycow	briguyd	your doing everything the hard way, you should be able to just browse your network
2006-05-19T09:05:00.000Z	holycow	briguyd	you don't need to install swat or samba either, you just need the samba client to browse folders on the network of windows machines
