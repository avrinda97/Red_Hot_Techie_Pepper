2006-12-03T07:37:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	How did you try?
2006-12-03T07:37:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	"everything" explains nothing. ;)
2006-12-03T07:38:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	What version are you using, where did you get them, do you use the terminal or X, on what machine are the apps, ...?
2006-12-03T07:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	I still don't know where you got Firefox/Thunderbird and what your console output/problems are...
2006-12-29T07:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	You can't usually... but you should have some warranty stickers or something on the bottom side.

2007-01-26T16:47:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	Well, you asked what to use. ;)

2007-01-26T06:11:00.000Z	Tomcat_	noelferreira	Yes, I read that, but I don't have a solution. Check if you have your TV card as input source and the volume to 100% in volume settings.
