2010-10-23T20:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	sudo mount -t /dev/"cdrom" /mnt
2010-10-23T20:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	cdrom , might be /dev/sr0
2010-10-23T20:17:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	so i found sr0, but then what do i do, double clicking = could not disable, no app for displaying block device files
2010-10-23T20:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	is there an option to open with wine if you right click on the cd in dolphin/places
2010-10-23T20:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	err nautilaus places
2010-10-23T20:19:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	no option for opening with wine, you can choose other application, so i chose wine but then it says not marked as executable
2010-10-23T20:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	right click , choose properties , permissions, make executable
2010-10-23T20:21:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	is this in /dev or Computer?
2010-10-23T20:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	try this in the terminal 'mount -o remount,rw /dev/sr0'dev
2010-10-23T20:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	try this in the terminal 'mount -o remount,rw /dev/sr0'
2010-10-23T20:23:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	right i've done that, if i right click the cd icon and go to permissions, they cannot be determined, if i right click sr0, and go to permissions the checkbox for enabling execution is greyed out (says i have to be owner), how do i do this with terminal sudo
2010-10-23T20:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	 chmod +x ?
2010-10-23T20:27:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	i just did `sudo chmod +x sr0` and now it's still greyed but checked, but now if i run with wine it still says that it's not executable
2010-10-23T20:27:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	thanks for the help but i might just not install the game.
2010-10-23T20:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	why not copy the game to your hdd, it might be easier to run in wine
2010-10-23T20:28:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	i can't access what's on the cd
2010-10-23T20:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	try this , http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/copy-cd-or-dvd-dd
2011-04-04T22:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Craig`	if you have hdmi connected to your tv and don't have audio , in some cases the graphics card with hdmi also requires a connection from the soundcard out to the graphics card audio input , if so equipped
2011-04-04T22:06:00.000Z	Craig`	BluesKaj	i said that hdmi would have worked.. i didn't say that i was using hdmi
