2006-10-04T09:49:00.000Z	sivik		minicom, i need some help getting it to connect, i have already done a setup and nothing ever happens
2006-10-04T09:50:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	minicom was no easy to use, when I tried.
2006-10-04T09:51:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	did you ever fix it
2006-10-04T09:52:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	make sure your bios is set right, first.  otherwise you'll be wasting time.
2006-10-04T09:52:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	what does the bios need to say?
2006-10-04T09:53:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	ok, wouldn't the bios cause it not to work in windows?
2006-10-04T09:54:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	i checked to make sure
2006-10-04T09:54:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	try http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/
2006-10-04T09:59:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	you're trying to connect to a cisco router, right?
2006-10-04T10:00:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	yes, 2500
2006-10-04T10:00:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	if you've connected in windows, you should know the settings, right?
2006-10-04T10:02:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	yes
2006-10-04T10:02:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	i do it at school at least twice a week
2006-10-04T10:03:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	just a sec, I'm downlaoding minicom to take a look.
2006-10-04T10:03:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	thanks
2006-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	Ctrl-A Z, then the settings are in o, should be it.
2006-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	yes, thats where i'm trying to get it to work
2006-10-04T10:07:00.000Z	jwhitlark	sivik	Ctrl-A p for params, the cycle it.  That's as far as I'v gotten.
2006-10-04T10:08:00.000Z	sivik	jwhitlark	just did that
