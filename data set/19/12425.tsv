2005-09-14T08:14:00.000Z	zblach		hi. a question about sound. I get the drums when the log-in screen loads, but when I run xmms, i get a popup telling me that my sound is not configured correctly. how to rememdy?
2005-09-14T08:14:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	go to xmms preferences and set outpug plugin to esound
2005-09-14T08:15:00.000Z	zblach	Quinthius	do i need to restart xmms?
2005-09-14T08:16:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	don't think so, but maybe
2005-09-14T08:17:00.000Z	zblach	Quinthius	nothing doing.
2005-09-14T08:17:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	go to system -> preferences -> multimedia selector, on audio output, hit test... does it beep?
2005-09-14T08:18:00.000Z	zblach	Quinthius	for every option in every column "failed to construct pipeline"
2005-09-14T08:18:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	hmm. go to system -> pref -> sound, and make sure "enable sound server" is unchecked, and then try testing ALSA in the media selector again
2005-09-14T08:19:00.000Z	zblach	Quinthius	nope. still not working
2005-09-14T08:19:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	ok... sounds like there might be some problem with the driver for your card.... you say you hear the drums at the startuo screen though?
2005-09-14T08:20:00.000Z	zblach	Quinthius	yup. got drums no problem
2005-09-14T08:20:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	hmm... actually... was "enable sound server" checked or unchecked by default when you just went to it?
2005-09-14T08:22:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	well the two common combinations are: enable sound server + use ESD in media selector, or disable sound server + use ALSA in media selector
2005-09-14T08:23:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	can you "cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp" ? (turn your speakers down a little, it will generate static noise)
2005-09-14T08:24:00.000Z	zblach	Quinthius	bash: /dev/dsp: Permission Denied
2005-09-14T08:24:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	ls -l /dev/dsp
2005-09-14T08:24:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	and also do "id", make sure audio is listed
2005-09-14T08:26:00.000Z	Quinthius	zblach	it sounds like a permission problem. using sudo in front of the cat shouldn't work either, because the > would br redirecting the whole output of "sudo cat /dev/urandom" ...the sudo isn't affecting the write attempt to /dev/dsp
