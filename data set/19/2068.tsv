2010-10-15T05:14:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	lshw
2010-10-15T05:15:00.000Z	sanduz2		thank you Kangarooo
2010-10-15T05:15:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	in terminal also just lshw -C network
2010-10-15T05:16:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	run the command lsmod to see if driver is loaded
2010-10-15T05:16:00.000Z	sanduz2		awesome, thank you Kangarooo
2010-10-15T05:17:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	If you run the iwconfig command do ypu you see wlan0      NOT READY ?
2010-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	sanduz2	Kangarooo	 my wlan0 is working, i am on it right now. The problem is it wont work when I set the router to Wireless N so I'm trying to look up info on the driver I guess
2010-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	sanduz2		it's the only thing i can think of =/
2010-10-15T05:19:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	it would be nice if u report bug to launchpad using ubuntu-bug nm-tool
2010-10-15T05:20:00.000Z	sanduz2	Kangarooo	id love to. i dont know what that is or how to use it =/
2010-10-15T05:20:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	couse maybe this N speed isnt supported jet to this driver (if ur wifi device can use N speed)
2010-10-15T05:21:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	just write in terminal ubuntu-bug nm-tool
2010-10-15T05:21:00.000Z	sanduz2		my Wifi device can use N speed on Windows, but on Ubuntu it doesnt work. how do i check if the driver supports it?
2010-10-15T05:22:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	if ur not registered then when it will open launchpad site it will ask for registration. launchpad is site where all bugs are tracked and info stored and at end - fixed and ull be notofied about that.
2010-10-15T05:22:00.000Z	sanduz2		cool. is it the package strongswan-nm?
2010-10-15T05:22:00.000Z	sanduz2		it says i  need to install the nm-tool package
2010-10-15T05:24:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sanduz2	then ubuntu-bug network-manager
2010-10-15T05:24:00.000Z	sanduz2	Kangarooo	ok that worked. thank you.
