2011-10-18T19:07:00.000Z	Neosano		lubuntu 11.10 livecd doesn't load up correctly. (silence on lubuntu channel, that's why I'm writing here). I've checked my cd, it said there are no errors. It's loading fine, but then the console pops out. no graphical interface.
2011-10-18T19:07:00.000Z	Neosano		previous versions were OK
2011-10-18T19:08:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	When does that happen? After the ISOLinux selection?
2011-10-18T19:08:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	*selection screen
2011-10-18T19:08:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	yeah, I choose "Try lubuntu without installing", then I see the loading screen with 5 dots flashing, then the black console
2011-10-18T19:09:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	What does it say on the console?
2011-10-18T19:10:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	haha! console welcomes me!  it says " Welcome to Ubuntu 11.10 (GNU/Linux 3.0.0-12-generic i686)"
2011-10-18T19:10:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	then the documentation thing and thing about sudo
2011-10-18T19:11:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	no errors
2011-10-18T19:11:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	OK, then that's a simple problem to resolve!
2011-10-18T19:11:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	Type this into it: sudo service lightdm start
2011-10-18T19:12:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	lightdm: unrecognized service
2011-10-18T19:12:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	should it be lxdm on lubuntu?
2011-10-18T19:12:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	Right, so type this into it: sudo service lxdm start
2011-10-18T19:13:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	worked! :D thanks.. but.. why?
2011-10-18T19:14:00.000Z	lkjoel	Neosano	It just started the login manager. If you want, you can file a bug report to Lubuntu, as this is a stupidly programmed bug
2011-10-18T19:15:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	yeah, no problem. only if I knew where I should report it
2011-10-18T19:16:00.000Z	Neosano	lkjoel	I never was able to find right place to report lubuntu bugs :(
