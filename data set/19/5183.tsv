2008-09-05T03:25:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	you do not want to set a root password, it is insecure, your fiesr user has admin priveliges and can run things as root
2008-09-05T03:26:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	instead open a terminal and run "sudo -s" that will give you a root prompt
2008-09-05T03:27:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	that's -i , but that's only in terminal, i want to open it in Xwindow, not terminal
2008-09-05T03:28:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	you want a graphical way to have a window with icons opened as root?
2008-09-05T03:28:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	yes
2008-09-05T03:28:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	in that case Alt-F2 and then "gksudo nautilus /"
2008-09-05T03:29:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	as you will see on the side pane everything donwe withing that window will be done as root
2008-09-05T03:29:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	would that allow from one to the other if I opened two?
2008-09-05T03:29:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	think so
2008-09-05T03:30:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	do that command twice and only work between those two windows
2008-09-05T03:30:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	tested it?
2008-09-05T03:31:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	yes, i've tested it
2008-09-05T03:31:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	thanks. that will help ALOT
2008-09-05T03:32:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	just be careful because you might damage your system, you have access to it as root, so don't delete anything
2008-09-05T03:32:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	I use ubuntu quite regular, and I'm going to kill the install on that pc now anyway lol
2008-09-05T03:33:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	only thing I might have to worry about is putting those folders back after I reinstall
2008-09-05T03:33:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	as long as i warned you, that's all I can do...
2008-09-05T03:33:00.000Z	Saiki	komputes	well-aware
2008-09-05T03:33:00.000Z	komputes	Saiki	 PM me to explain what you're doing...I didn't catch the first part of the chat
