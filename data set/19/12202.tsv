2006-09-07T11:40:00.000Z	nicedreams		You know how in windows if I want to connect to an administrative share you can do like  192.168.1.10/c$    and then put in the user/pass to get to the root of c or whatever drive letter you want?  Can you do that in linux/ubuntu?
2006-09-07T11:41:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	you can use ssh to do that
2006-09-07T11:41:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	in nautilus or konqueror type sftp://theaddress
2006-09-07T11:41:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	thx...i'll try that
2006-09-07T11:41:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	as long as ssh is installed on the computer it should work fine (openssh-server is the package)
2006-09-07T11:42:00.000Z	sagarp		cat /dev/dvd > myiso.iso
2006-09-07T11:43:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	I need ssh server package to connecto to my windows box from my linux box that way?
2006-09-07T11:43:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	ooh i thought you wanted linux->linux
2006-09-07T11:43:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	for windows->linux you should use samba instead
2006-09-07T11:43:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	In windows I can go to
2006-09-07T11:44:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	In windows I can go to \\192.168.1.10\c$  to get to my C root drive ... can I do that in linux or do I have to share the drive to do it?
2006-09-07T11:44:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	you want to go to the remote windows' computer's C root from linux? or the other way
2006-09-07T11:46:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	go from ubuntu to my windows box.  There are some files I want to get from my windows box and I don't want to share the drive to do it.  In windows I can do like I was saying   \\192.168.1.10\c$  or   \\192.168.1.10\d$   and so on without having to share the drive....  I'm hoping I can do that via linux also to get to my windows box without having to share all of it
2006-09-07T11:46:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	I can do it that way in a pure windows environment...i'm hoping i can do it through linux to windows also
2006-09-07T11:47:00.000Z	sagarp	nicedreams	oh..not sure, but samba should be able to handle it..the address sould be smb://192.168.2.10 and hten you shuold find c$ in there i hope :S
2006-09-07T11:47:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	i'll try that... thx
2006-09-07T11:48:00.000Z	nicedreams	sagarp	it worked....thx very much
