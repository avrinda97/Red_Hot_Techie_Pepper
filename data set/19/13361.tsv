2005-04-20T12:58:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		anyone here use backports?
2005-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		it's not better.. just better at what it does
2005-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		without debian, there would be no ubuntu
2005-04-20T13:01:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		so no one here actually uses backports repositories?
2005-04-20T13:01:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		hehe
2005-04-20T13:02:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		i mistakenly added backports
2005-04-20T13:02:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		it's bugging me greatly, too :)
2005-04-20T13:02:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		i'm going to have to roll back my repository list and apt-get update/grade to fix it
2005-04-20T13:03:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	flush time
2005-04-20T13:03:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	linux_galore	flush time?
2005-04-20T13:04:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	some times it takes more time to fix the install than to just flush it
2005-04-20T13:05:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	linux_galore	the backports only changed like 5 things.. i just need to find which ones :)
2005-04-20T13:05:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	check your logs
2005-04-20T13:07:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	linux_galore	my update (which i did in synaptic so have a handy history) shows 6 upgrades, how do i tell which is backport?
2005-04-20T13:07:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	wouldnt have a clue
2005-04-20T13:14:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	open getid and rip of the tittle bar
2005-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	you can always try VLOS...its Gentoo made easy
2005-04-20T13:32:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	linux_galore	i think i actually tried that once and something about it wouldn't install right for me.. just my luck :)
2005-04-20T13:32:00.000Z	linux_galore	i0n_st0rm	only other one thats intresting is Yoper Linux
