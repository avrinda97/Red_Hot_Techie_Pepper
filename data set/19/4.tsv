2005-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	knubbze		is there any known issue with the version of X that comes with 4.10 and the GeForce 6800 Ultra?
2005-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	knubbze		because X refuses to work correctly
2005-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	knubbze		and I can't install the latest nvidia drivers as they require the kernel sources and apt-cache search kernel-source doesn't find anything suitable
2005-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	knubbze		doesn't work. :(
2005-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	your best bet is to use the nvidia drivers or to go to hoary
2005-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	hoary will be out in 4 days so it is pretty safe to upgrade
2005-04-15T15:11:00.000Z	knubbze	fabbione	I downloaded the hoary build and burned it on a CD, but it isn't bootable
2005-04-15T15:11:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	it would be interesting to know why it isn't bootable..
2005-04-15T15:14:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	it's mostlikely i problem with your CD or your reader, because at that point nothing from ubuntu has been loaded.
2005-04-15T15:14:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	going back to your original problem
2005-04-15T15:14:00.000Z	knubbze	fabbione	yeah but my 4.10 ubuntu disk is loaded perfectly
2005-04-15T15:14:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	try installing the nvidia drivers
2005-04-15T15:15:00.000Z	knubbze	fabbione	it demands the kernel source.
2005-04-15T15:15:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	i have similar effects on one of my test machines, due to my half broken cd writer
2005-04-15T15:15:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	you don't need to compile it yourself
2005-04-15T15:15:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	apt-get install nvidia-glx
2005-04-15T15:16:00.000Z	fabbione	knubbze	edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
