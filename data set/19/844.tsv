2011-08-08T10:03:00.000Z	noahbanks		May i ask an ultra noob question?
2011-08-08T10:04:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	go ahead
2011-08-08T10:08:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	are you installing from a CD ?
2011-08-08T10:08:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	then you should find the pool folder at the root of the installation CD
2011-08-08T10:09:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	I've only started using Ubuntu today. How can I navigate to tha?
2011-08-08T10:09:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	the simplest way is to use nautilus (the file browser)
2011-08-08T10:11:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	How can I view the root from there? I don't see it on either the desktop or within the file browser?
2011-08-08T10:12:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	you don't see any disks in the left column in nautilus ?
2011-08-08T10:13:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	nothing is mounted other than my hard drive.
2011-08-08T10:15:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	do you see the disk if you run "df -h" from a terminal ?
2011-08-08T10:16:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	yes. the line says: /dev/hdc         694M  694M
2011-08-08T10:16:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	it's mounted on "/cdrom"
2011-08-08T10:18:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	and is there a "pool" folder in "/cdrom"
2011-08-08T10:18:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	I feel like I keep asking dumb questions, but where can I find that?
2011-08-08T10:19:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	from nautilus, click "File system" in the left column, then  should see the "cdrom" folder
2011-08-08T10:19:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	yes! success!
2011-08-08T10:20:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	thanks you! I really appreciate it!
2011-08-08T10:20:00.000Z	glebihan	noahbanks	you're welcome
2011-08-08T11:08:00.000Z	noahbanks	glebihan	I did it! I'm up and running.
