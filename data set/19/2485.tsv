2010-08-04T01:39:00.000Z	mrman208		is this channel just for regular Ubuntu or for Ubuntu Server as well?
2010-08-04T01:40:00.000Z	mrman208		is this channel just for regular Ubuntu or for Ubuntu Server as well?
2010-08-04T01:40:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	for server related problems #ubuntu-server will be better suited
2010-08-04T01:47:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	just a small advice: if you ask a question in some channel don't leave again within one minute (not that it would have made any difference in this case :-))
2010-08-04T01:48:00.000Z	mrman208	guntbert	Ok, thanks
2010-08-04T02:02:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	in its own window
2010-08-04T02:02:00.000Z	mrman208	guntbert	I am using irssi
2010-08-04T02:04:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	probably <alt>+arrow -- see http://linuxreviews.org/software/irc/irssi/#toc6
2010-08-04T02:05:00.000Z	mrman208	guntbert	I got the /window command working thank you though
2010-08-04T02:05:00.000Z	mrman208	guntbert	and <alt>+arrow brings me to a login screen
2010-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	:) I don't use irssi myself - thats why I said "probably " :-)
2010-08-08T01:48:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	that has nothing to do with setting your status it just a (here) annoying announcement (try it in #test with /me yawns)
2010-08-08T01:54:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	you just got yourself removed from vbox ??
2010-08-08T01:58:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	please don't discuss virtualization products here
2010-08-08T01:58:00.000Z	mrman208	guntbert	Sorry
2010-08-08T01:59:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	may I PM you?
2010-08-09T00:03:00.000Z	guntbert	mrman208	how is that an ubuntu support question?
2010-08-09T00:03:00.000Z	mrman208	guntbert	Good point, sorry
