2011-06-03T20:38:00.000Z	arya_		hi everyone... wireshark is not working in my ubuntu.. its not listing the interfaces.. whereas in windows its showing the realtek and i am able to use it... whats the problem here?
2011-06-03T20:39:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	Run it as root
2011-06-03T20:42:00.000Z	arya_	edbian	thanx a lot.. can you also tell me how can i see the list of all urls which are open in my browser on terminal?
2011-06-03T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	I don't know of an easy way to do that
2011-06-03T20:43:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	That's info that firefox holds (you could edit the source to print it for you).  Otherwise you'll have to capture the packets when the connects to those urls are made.  There will be a hailstorm of packets
2011-06-03T20:44:00.000Z	arya_	edbian	: how can i edit the source and fro where?
2011-06-03T20:46:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	No offense but if you don't know where to get source you aren't going to be able to edit it :)
2011-06-03T20:46:00.000Z	arya_		ok you mean the source code?
2011-06-03T20:46:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	Having said that: http://www.mozilla.org/developer/
2011-06-03T20:46:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	Yes, the source code
2011-06-03T20:47:00.000Z	arya_		ok that i know.. so what changes do i need to do ... like what command so that it will print on the terminal?
2011-06-03T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	That's the hard part.  It would take me too much time to figure it out.  Sorry, on your own here.  What is the ultimate goal here?
2011-06-03T20:48:00.000Z	arya_		i just wanna write a bash script to show all urls opened.. just a curiosity

2011-06-03T20:49:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	Yeah it would be hard.
2011-06-03T20:49:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	Perhaps you'll be lucky and that is already printed out in some debugging info or something.
2011-06-03T20:49:00.000Z	arya_	edbian	can you suggest me a tutorial or something?
2011-06-03T20:50:00.000Z	arya_	edbian	i tried to look for it but didnt get anything
2011-06-03T20:50:00.000Z	edbian	arya_	man firefox    would be a good starting point
