2012-07-14T04:41:00.000Z	Chamunks		i'm thinking of making the switch.
2012-07-14T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 fglrx depends on the exact chipset.
2012-07-14T04:41:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	I'm running dual saphire radeon hd6850's
2012-07-14T04:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 i have to wonder.. whats the point. :) well with using them on linux at least...
2012-07-14T04:42:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	with an amd 6core bla bla bla
2012-07-14T04:42:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	its a dual boot machine.
2012-07-14T04:45:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	so any thoughts or just wanted to say about the picky chipset bit.
2012-07-14T04:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 i avoide ati at all costs.. ;)
2012-07-14T04:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 i have very few issues with 12.04 on my Nvidia desktop machine.  Its about a year old now. so not that cutting edge
2012-07-14T04:47:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	brent_ beandog  I'll tell ya i never usually go for ati the only reason i did this time is my asus crosshair iv mobo boasted support for ati's crossfire.
2012-07-14T04:47:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	well i've spent about 600$ on these cards im pretty stuck with them for at least another couple years.
2012-07-14T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 im not sure if crossfire is supported at all in the FGLRX drivers.
2012-07-14T04:48:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	somewhat its not great at all.
2012-07-14T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 but i imagine you are not going to be doing any gaming that will need that much power under linux.
2012-07-14T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Chamunks	 gnome3 seems to work decently well. if you can get used to it
2012-07-14T04:50:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	well I just hope that the screen output doesnt look like this anymore... Pending link.
2012-07-19T04:15:00.000Z	Chamunks	Dr_willis	im curious what the aplication color is doing installed by default if its not supported.
