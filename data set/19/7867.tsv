2008-05-02T22:39:00.000Z	Le1		ok
2008-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	Le1		is there no data recovery tools for ubuntu?
2008-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	there is a partition recivery tool, but I just can't for the life of me recall the name.
2008-05-02T22:43:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	I remember, it's testdisk
2008-05-02T22:43:00.000Z	Le1	pajamian	I have testdisk, but I cant get it to restore anything...
2008-05-02T22:44:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	how exactly was the data erased?
2008-05-02T22:44:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	were the files erased?
2008-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	try magicrescue
2008-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	Le1	pajamian	is it an installable package?
2008-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	yes, I found it by searching synaptic
2008-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	I wouldn't hold out much hope, though.
2008-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	Le1	pajamian	:(
2008-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	if you need to be able to write the files somewhere I would recommend that you either get a usb stick, or connect to a samba or nfs share on another computer.
2008-05-02T22:47:00.000Z	Le1	pajamian	i should be able to use Ubuntu's ramdisk at the moment and then put them online for later, because .mozilla shouldnt be big :)
2008-05-02T22:48:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	ok, good luck
2008-05-02T23:01:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	if it was overwritten then the chances of you getting data off the original partition is not very good.
2008-05-02T23:03:00.000Z	pajamian	Le1	the only thing I can recommend that may possibly get your data back is to run grep on the raw partition to see if you can find the data you need, search for a bookmark name you know is in the file or a url or something.  You can use context to get most or all of the file before and after the match.
