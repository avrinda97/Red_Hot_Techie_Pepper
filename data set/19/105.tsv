2012-09-17T08:27:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	Did you found something?
2012-09-17T08:28:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	ahh there you are! No, I can't find any mention of where to get the headers or recent Linode kernels. You need to ask them. They have the IRC channel #linode on the OFTC IRc network where you can ask
2012-09-17T08:34:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	?
2012-09-17T08:35:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	Then, what should I do?
2012-09-17T08:35:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	that makes sense... but strictly they are breaking the GNU GPL because if they distribute they must offer the sources themselves, not just palm you off to some other location!
2012-09-17T08:37:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	Best thing to do is install the 'git' version control system and clone the mainline kernel source. "sudo apt-get install git" followed by (in your home directory) "git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git"
2012-09-17T08:38:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	However, that doesn't help too much when you want the kernel headers to build against on a standard Ubuntu installation
2012-09-17T08:39:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	Will I have problems doing that? I don't want to break anything
2012-09-17T08:41:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	I think it'll make things unduly complicated for you if you're not experience at this stuff. What is it you need the kernel headers for?
2012-09-17T08:42:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	I want to mount an Asterisk + FreePBX server
2012-09-17T08:45:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	Linode's docs on that are out of date I think, too. http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/Asterisk
2012-09-17T08:47:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	have you seen this? http://library.linode.com/communications/voip-services
2012-09-17T08:48:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	I'll read it, thanks.
2012-09-17T08:50:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	See this answer from Linode Support ==> http://cl.ly/image/0U3N3R3h2h1W
2012-09-17T08:54:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	It's probably not worth arguing but I think the FSF would say different :)
2012-09-17T08:54:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	I'm surprised with their answer
2012-09-17T08:57:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	So am I. You rent the VPS instance and choose what to install in it. If you get the kernel from Linode, then they are distributing. I suggest a friendly email to Chris (he has always seemed like a nice guy to me when I've had dealings with him) copied to the FSF, might help
2012-09-17T08:58:00.000Z	mushroomed_	TJ-	Who's Chris?
2012-09-17T08:59:00.000Z	TJ-	mushroomed_	Chris Akers - the guy that set-up Linode
