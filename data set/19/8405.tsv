2007-05-10T07:07:00.000Z	ROnewbie		does anyone know how to automount a data partition in Feisty ?
2007-05-10T07:07:00.000Z	ROnewbie		preferably upon boot /
2007-05-10T07:07:00.000Z	ROnewbie		?
2007-05-10T07:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	you need to edit /etc/fstab. If you google for "fstab" you should be able to find some tutorials.
2007-05-10T07:09:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	I just did that, under the help of a wannabe guru, and it didn't work
2007-05-10T07:10:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	what did you add? Do you get any error messages when you try to mount it?
2007-05-10T07:10:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	no, no error messages, but I wouldn't see it even in /mnt
2007-05-10T07:11:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	so... you created a directory, e.g. /mnt/otherPartition, then you add a line to the fstab to tell the system to mount (eg) /dev/sda1 into /mnt/otherPartition?
2007-05-10T07:12:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	no, I didn't create any directory; I just added a line in fstab
2007-05-10T07:12:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	you need to create a directory into which you will mount the drive...
2007-05-10T07:14:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	ok, sounds good, but mind the "newbie" part. Isn't there a GUI way of doing it ?
2007-05-10T07:14:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	the first time I installed feisty it would automount both other partitions on boot.
2007-05-10T07:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	there might be, but I'm not aware of it. I've always done it by editing fstab.
2007-05-10T07:15:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	sounds like you've installed a bit of software which has edited your fstab. That does happen sometimes (though it's a bit naughty - software shouldn't do that without warning you of hte consequences)
2007-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	well, that's the thing, it's a quasi fresh install I'm doing this on.
2007-05-10T07:19:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	right, just to summarise: you need to tell the system to mount a partition device (//dev/sda5) into a directory (which can be anything, for instance /mnt/disk or /media/mount or whatever you like). You also need to make sure that that directory exists - if it doesn't, then create it. The line that hellblade quoted you for fstab should work - just copy it in and subsitute your chosen directory instead of /media/mountpoint
2007-05-10T07:20:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	don't worry about UUIDs at all, by the way. That's a new thing that ubuntu uses but you can stilluse the old-fashioned "/dev/sda5"
2007-05-10T07:21:00.000Z	ROnewbie	SlimeyPete	slimey, thanks a bunch. I'm right now on the phone, i'll give this a try. Thans.
2007-05-10T07:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ROnewbie	no problem
