2008-01-16T08:54:00.000Z	Dezine		Hi there, I've been looking around at laptops and I'm hoping to find a cheap option that is perfect for Ubuntu.. wondering if anyone is using a laptop with Ubuntu and if they could suggest one I should look at.
2008-01-16T08:56:00.000Z	Dezine		good point
2008-01-16T08:56:00.000Z	Dezine		It'll just be a internet/blogging laptop so I could go for a cheap option
2008-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	Dezine		hm
2008-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	Dezine		I had a dell for while, things worked well
2008-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	Dezine		Kinda old, we're talking three years or so.
2008-01-16T08:59:00.000Z	Dezine		It's that or a used mac, just not interesting in a Windows laptop.
2008-01-16T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	I've been very happy with my $600us gateway mt64xx
2008-01-16T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	ati graphics though. Don't expect blazing 3d
2008-01-19T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	you mean line out? (I hope)
2008-01-19T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	line in is for a mike, or recording off another player of some kind
2008-02-19T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	copy the ttf file to /usr/share/fonts/truetype , or create ~/.fonts and put it there
2008-02-19T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	read back, I told you how
2008-02-19T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	restart gimp, it should find it. If not, run   fc-cache  in a terminal
2008-06-18T10:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	did you ever run alacarte with sudo?
2008-06-18T10:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	ok, don't do that :)    do   sudo chown -R patrick:patrick ~/.local
2008-06-18T10:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	when you use sudo, it writes configs to your home dir as root owned, so you are not able to edit them thereafter
2008-06-18T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	if you're trying to check a submenu, check an item inside the submenu
2008-06-28T00:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Dezine	after a failed login attempt, check the contents of ~/.xsession-errors and /var/log/Xorg.0.log (read them from ctl-alt-f1, ctl-alt-f2 to get back to gui)
