2005-06-01T15:15:00.000Z	xxenon		what's the best hardware to build a very simple and SILENT linux server/firewall ? an old laptop ? a shuttle-like small PC ?
2005-06-01T15:15:00.000Z	Shufla	xxenon	pIII old one w/o cooler.
2005-06-01T15:16:00.000Z	xxenon	Shufla	- PIII can run without cooler ?
2005-06-01T15:16:00.000Z	Shufla	xxenon	afair. or celerons. we have piii cels as ultraquiet x-terminals
2005-06-01T15:16:00.000Z	Shufla	xxenon	network card was the most loud component
2005-06-01T15:16:00.000Z	xxenon	Shufla	- interesting ...
2005-06-01T15:17:00.000Z	xxenon		yeah also.
2005-06-01T15:17:00.000Z	xxenon		Ill see what second hand hardware I can find here.
2005-06-01T15:17:00.000Z	Shufla		afair minipc do have fans, and little fans are very very loud
2005-06-01T15:18:00.000Z	Shufla		imho the best choice for u-quiet pc is smthing old without any fans and with quiet, no so fast modern disk.
2005-06-01T15:18:00.000Z	xxenon	Shufla	- I think I have a celeron 350 at home, but the fan was very loud...Ill see if I can removeit.
2005-06-01T15:19:00.000Z	Shufla	xxenon	try to remove the fan, lower it's power in bios. for router you do not need so much power.
2005-06-01T15:19:00.000Z	xxenon	Shufla	- yeah. And I will use a smartmedia card as HD.
2005-06-01T15:21:00.000Z	Shufla	xxenon	good choice. once i had pc166 mmx w/o fans (even AC was w/o, some old IBM). but hdd was to loud, and i used new one. system was running quiet and nice. compilation was slow, but do not overburn the proc.
2005-06-01T15:21:00.000Z	Shufla		s/do not/did not/
2005-06-01T15:21:00.000Z	xxenon		nice.
2005-06-01T15:21:00.000Z	xxenon		I will cross compile kernel and stuff on another machine aynway.
2005-06-01T15:22:00.000Z	xxenon		and also I want to plug a wlan card in it..so Im not sure about CPU power...but I guess it's ok.
2005-06-01T15:23:00.000Z	Shufla	xxenon	enough. that system do not have to be responsive. you can nice some processes to negative, so it'll run great.
