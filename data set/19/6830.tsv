2008-08-21T11:22:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 /usr/bin/
2008-08-21T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	... that's wrong, to begin with.  Locally compiled stuff go to /usr/local/{bin,lib,etc}.  Do you still have the source?  if so, is there a make clean?
2008-08-21T11:23:00.000Z	rgnr		nope
2008-08-21T11:24:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 nope
2008-08-21T11:24:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	Alright, well, either grab it again, and hope there's a make clean, if there's not, or you don't feel like it, you get to delete everything manually.
2008-08-21T11:24:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 and how do i do that?
2008-08-21T11:25:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	Do what?  remove stuff manually?  with rm, and... patience.
2008-08-21T11:28:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 you mean just rm all files in here? http://paste.ubuntu.com/39310/
2008-08-21T11:29:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	Those would be some of them, but not all of them.
2008-08-21T11:29:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 but those r the only ones he located i don't need to remove dependencies cuz i
2008-08-21T11:29:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	the best thing is probably to download the same version you had, do make, but not make install, and then get a list of files from that make, and then delete them in the real filesystem
2008-08-21T11:30:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 gonna compile a newer version
2008-08-21T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	Right, but not everything that pidgin installed has "pidgin" in the name.
2008-08-21T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	Don't compile.  Use packages.  Can't you tell how much of a headache this is?
2008-08-21T11:31:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 but compiling adopts the package to that specific machine
2008-08-21T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	You won't see any/much benefit, but if you'd like, would you like to buy the golden gate bridge?
2008-08-21T11:32:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 what is that?
2008-08-21T11:34:00.000Z	rgnr	Flannel	 btw there's no pidgin 4.5 for ubuntu yet
2008-08-21T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	rgnr	At the very least, in the future always use /usr/local
