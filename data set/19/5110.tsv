2008-08-31T05:28:00.000Z	buahhaha		uh, I'm not sure what I need to understand? I got your pm but my script is full of lines that only differ as far as the filename is concerned
2008-08-31T05:28:00.000Z	buahhaha		the lines are simply cp /my/mp3/collection/Some Song.mp3"  thedirectoryinwhichiwantthem
2008-08-31T05:29:00.000Z	buahhaha		i've just tried to make an absolutely trivial copying script by search and replacing a playlist
2008-08-31T05:29:00.000Z	buahhaha		and the filenames constitute the problem since they have spaces
2008-08-31T05:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	are you quoting the paths that have spaces?
2008-08-31T05:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	and what happens instead?
2008-08-31T05:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	what editor did you use to write it?
2008-08-31T05:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	do this: cat -e thescript and paste a sample line here
2008-08-31T05:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	cat -e thescript   and paste a sample line here.
2008-08-31T05:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	carriage return.
2008-08-31T05:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	see the ^M , thats a carriage return used in windows line-endings
2008-08-31T05:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	so you are copying the files to a file name '\r'  (carriage return), which ls shows as '?'
2008-08-31T05:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	tr -d '\r' <thescript >newcopy
2008-08-31T05:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	after you do that, cat -e thescript and you should no longer see ^M
2008-08-31T05:44:00.000Z	buahhaha	prince_jammys	thanks! it works now (apart from some upper/lower case mess since it's a very old winamp playlist)
2008-08-31T05:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	did you read the filenames off a winamp playlist?
2008-08-31T05:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	because that could do it. otherwise, you must have used a windows text editor somewhere along the way.
2008-08-31T05:57:00.000Z	buahhaha	prince_jammys	thanks once again for your help, gotta go
2008-08-31T05:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	buahhaha	welcome
