2009-10-31T16:59:00.000Z	Dynetrekk		is there a way to virus scan a winXP partition when booting from an Xubuntu partition? e.g. with clam or something like that?
2009-10-31T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 there are AV software for linux you can install that can scan windows machines.
2009-10-31T17:00:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	on the same disk, different partition?
2009-10-31T17:00:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	any recommendations on software? Clam?
2009-10-31T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 yes.. you can use it to scan anything you can access...
2009-10-31T17:00:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	great, thanks, I'll try after installing xubuntu
2011-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 you are using a dvi connection or vga?
2011-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	DVI, and I have a DVI->VGA plug (which works)
2011-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	I guess a new monitor will use DVI, no point in buying VGA anymore
2011-02-13T14:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 i would dump any vga adaptors and so forth.. i find things/res detection work MUCH better without them
2011-02-13T14:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 dump vga as fast as you can. :) I can think of only a few reasons to keep vga.
2011-02-13T14:16:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	sure! but as I said, what I need, is to find supported resolutions, so I can buy a new monitor. the old one is broken
2011-02-13T14:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 I imagine any new monitor can handle any res you can throw at it..  more of a mater of budget then anything else.
2011-02-13T14:17:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	resolution of the _graphics chipset_
2011-02-13T14:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dynetrekk	 that sould be listed/mentioned on the nvidia specs  i would imagine..  I just get the highest res monitor i can afford.  most cards can do more then what my monitors can do anyway.
2011-02-13T14:18:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	it's intel
2011-02-13T14:18:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	http://paste.pocoo.org/show/337487/
2011-02-13T14:20:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	there is no driver issue. I just need to figure out what monitor to buy in the future. I don't want to buy a too large monitor, in case the chipset doesn't support it
2011-02-13T14:20:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	Dr_Willis	it looks like I found my info here: http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/index.htm
