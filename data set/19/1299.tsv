2011-03-17T01:20:00.000Z	Samuel2		i noticed win7 creates a 100 mb partition for its boot stuff
2011-03-17T01:20:00.000Z	Samuel2		ext3 but i still can change it to 4 if thats better
2011-03-17T01:21:00.000Z	Samuel2		its more that i wonder where Grub gets installed, current i got the 100 mb partition, my win7 partition and my empty ext3 part.
2011-03-17T01:22:00.000Z	Samuel2		only got the ext3 partition so far, I think Ubuntu deals with creating the extra partion when needed
2011-03-17T01:24:00.000Z	Samuel2		basicly my question is: can i remove the 100mb boot partition created by Win7 after installing Ubuntu?
2011-03-17T01:25:00.000Z	Samuel2		Perhaps I can hide the boot partition instead
2011-03-17T01:25:00.000Z	Samuel2		just how many partitions do i need to create for Ubuntu Maverick?
2011-03-17T01:26:00.000Z	Samuel2		got about 200GB left
2011-03-17T01:26:00.000Z	Polah	Samuel2	At least two, one for swap; one mounted at /
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	Samuel2		how big a size for the swap?
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	Polah		If you want to store your home folder separately to encrypt it and not lose it if your main filesystem crashes then you can do that
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	Polah	Samuel2	Match your RAM
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	Samuel2		2GB ram Polah
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	Polah		So set it to 2GB
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	Samuel2		nice :))
2011-03-17T01:28:00.000Z	Samuel2		when i leave it to the Ubuntu installer it created a much bigger swap  lol
2011-03-17T01:29:00.000Z	Samuel2	saulus	I got 2 for windows indeed and 1 ext3 and one 100GB ntfs partition for just data and such
2011-03-17T01:29:00.000Z	Samuel2		got about 180gb for the ext3
2011-03-17T01:29:00.000Z	Polah	Samuel2	why ext3 and not ext4?
