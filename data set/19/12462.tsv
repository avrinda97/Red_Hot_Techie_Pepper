2006-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	oblib		I just updated to Edgy -- does anyone know why emacs can no longer find a good font?
2006-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	because emacs doenst use xft/fontconfig
2006-11-01T09:01:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	can I fix it?
2006-11-01T09:01:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	get emacs cvs
2006-11-01T09:03:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	do you know if emacs will be fixed in Ubuntu eventuallly, or will I always have to compile on my own?
2006-11-01T09:04:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	its not about fixing, nothing is broken. A feature is not supported
2006-11-01T09:04:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	and distros do not include CVS versions in most cases, try #emacs
2006-11-01T09:05:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	so do I need to enable something specifically before I 'make' the CVS version? and why did it work before but doesn't now?
2006-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	I dont use emacs.
2006-11-01T09:07:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	'CVS version' of a program usually just means the most recent, possible exerimental, version, right?
2006-11-01T09:08:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	cvs head, yes, I suggest you #emacs, again
2006-11-01T09:09:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	but this seems to be a problem with the Ubuntu package -- it worked in Dapper, but doesn't in Edgy. It seems like a distro shouldn't distribute a bad package...
2006-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	its free, dont complain
2006-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	fix it yourself, thats the motto
2006-11-01T09:11:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	not everyone can do that (but I suppose people who can't woudln't be using emacs) so it makes sense to try to fix the package. Is this worth filing a bug on?
2006-11-01T09:11:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	yes it is worth, and people who can do use emacs a lot
2006-11-01T09:12:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	I guess my question really is "Is emacs broken in Edgy, or is it likely something specific only to my set up"?
2006-11-01T09:12:00.000Z	oblib	sanmarcos	do you know if it is universally broken in edgy?
2006-11-01T09:13:00.000Z	sanmarcos	oblib	dont use emacs, and its called edgy for a reason
