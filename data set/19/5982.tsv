2008-04-05T00:52:00.000Z	xFlipx	yigal	sure - move the router.
2008-04-05T00:52:00.000Z	xFlipx	yigal	what type of router is is?
2008-04-05T00:52:00.000Z	yigal	xFlipx	the router unfortunately can't be moved, because it is located where the hardwired machines are
2008-04-05T00:52:00.000Z	xFlipx	yigal	move the microwave?
2008-04-05T00:53:00.000Z	yigal	xFlipx	:)

2008-04-05T00:53:00.000Z	yigal	xFlipx	so your not familiar with tweaking dd-wrt
2008-04-05T00:54:00.000Z	xFlipx	yigal	tweaking ddwrt won't help your problem
2008-04-05T00:54:00.000Z	yigal	xFlipx	why not?
2008-04-05T00:55:00.000Z	xFlipx	yigal	because the only tweaks are for user sessions
