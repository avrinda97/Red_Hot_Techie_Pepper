2008-04-13T04:59:00.000Z	MFen		although i am not normally a flash user or developer, i find myself very much wanting to use sIFR (the font rendering widget).  sifr requres me to open and edit the distributed .fla file.  .. . . ... . does anyone know a good application to edit a (hopefully extremely basic) .fla file in ubuntu?
2008-04-13T04:59:00.000Z	MFen		so far i've tried synfig studio and it doesn't seem to open .fla files
2008-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	MFen		i know that there are applications that will let me save or export flash.. but i need to actually edit an .fla file since that is how sifr is distributed
2008-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	MFen		any ideas?
2008-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	What does the swf do and what do you want to change?
2008-04-13T05:03:00.000Z	MFen	Jordan_U	it's a fla, not a swf.  it's this: http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/

2008-06-09T03:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	bite :)
2010-08-29T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	The intructions on every ppa page use the GUI.
2010-11-23T05:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	Install from the mainling kerenel "ppa" and make sure you install the header package as well.
2010-11-23T05:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2010-11-23T05:37:00.000Z	MFen	Jordan_U	sure, i did that already, and found that my nvidia driver wasn't available (it was a 2.6.37 kernel)
2010-11-23T05:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	You installed the corrosponding linux-headers package as well?
2010-11-23T05:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	One should be built automatically by DKMS.
2010-11-23T05:39:00.000Z	MFen	Jordan_U	define "automatically".  automatically when? at the moment the kernel is installed? when it boots? do i install some nvidia package
2010-11-23T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MFen	When the kernel package is installed IIRC.
2010-11-23T06:42:00.000Z	MFen	Jordan_U	ok, i installed a new kernel.  that url you gave doesn't appear to be a real ppa (if it is, i have no idea what the correct URL should be)
2010-11-23T06:43:00.000Z	MFen	Jordan_U	i used this, instead: http://ppa.launchpad.net/kernel-ppa/ppa/ubuntu
2010-11-23T06:43:00.000Z	MFen	Jordan_U	and, having installed the new kernel, it did not compile the nvidia driver
