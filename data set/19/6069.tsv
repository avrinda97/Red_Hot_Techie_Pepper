2008-08-03T09:20:00.000Z	mordof		ok, questions about folder permissions.. i've never quite gotten the hang of this. my user: "server" my group: added myself to "wwwstuffs" folder perms  drw-rwSr-x  server wwwstuffs (date) www... when i try to cd into the folder, i get permission denied. i don't know why
2008-08-03T09:21:00.000Z	mordof		but i'm looking to set that folder so that everyone in the group wwwstuffs has full read/write permissions, even if one user makes a new file, the other should be able to edit..
2008-08-03T09:21:00.000Z	mordof		(afaik  chown g+s folder    or something of the sort (i forget exactly) makes it so that it keeps the permissions even on new files..
2008-08-03T09:22:00.000Z	mordof		anyone able to help me sort this out?
2008-08-03T09:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	have you tried chmod and do you know how the #s work, ?
2008-08-03T09:25:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	i've played with chmod, the only one that allows me to have access is 775, but that seems like a large amount of permissions for just read and write. i'm only somewhat familiar with the system for the #s and what they do.. 4 r, 2 w, 1 x? i think, user.. group.. others.
2008-08-03T09:26:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	close,, Owner, Owner's group, and all others
2008-08-03T09:26:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	if the folder is owned by my user, and the group that my user is in.. has read write for both user and groups.. i don't see why my user wouldn't have permission to view the folder.. that's what is confusing me - there's still some stuff i don't understand about all the user permissions on linux
2008-08-03T09:27:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	is this a shared directory, or a ftp dir?
2008-08-03T09:27:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	ftp for web server (so viewed by apache as well)
2008-08-03T09:28:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	ok,,, so another app "owns" that dir or at least controls through a ~.conf file,,, in that file you need to set the UMASK
2008-08-03T09:29:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	i just made the directory with my user account using sudo  (/www)
2008-08-03T09:30:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	in what parrent dir?
2008-08-03T09:30:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	/www
2008-08-03T09:30:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	so you made the www in the root dir?
2008-08-03T09:31:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	yeah. if there's a better place (outside my home directory, since multiple users need to have rw access) i'll be happy to move it
2008-08-03T09:32:00.000Z	SeaPhor	mordof	let me understand,, other users access this thru ftp? only or are other protocols involved? and what ftp server app do you use?
2008-08-03T09:33:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	proftpd. uses users in the system. also, users may ssh into the box from time to time. both my user and the other user are under the group wwwstuffs atm
2008-08-03T09:34:00.000Z	mordof	SeaPhor	sorry for the lack of info being given, i'm not sure what all plays a part in the solution to this. I greatly appreciate the help though :)
