2009-04-26T14:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 one way    find -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755
2009-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	I tried to do that and I get this output http://pastebin.com/m6f87f63a
2009-04-26T14:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 what are you wanting to do exactly?
2009-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 ahh. you are using the busybox 'version' of the commands... Not sure what to do about that.. those are more 'limited' then the official-non-busybox versions
2009-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	yep thats right
2009-04-26T14:42:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	For some reason I have to set my directories to 755 and then the files inside it to 644 to have them visible in windows
2009-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 err you are viewing ext2/3 filesystems in 'windows'  with what tool? windows xp? vista?
2009-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	vice versa, looking at the files which are on the busybox through vista
2009-04-26T14:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 Using Vista to read/write ext3 filesystem.  then? with what tool?
2009-04-26T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 somthing is VERY confuseing here.. windows cant read/write to a ext2/3 filesystem without somthing else installed.
2009-04-26T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	 so you are accessing a Linux SHARE over the network with windows then?
2009-04-26T14:46:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	Yep!
2009-04-26T14:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	   and what are you trying to do exactly? you need to set permissions on the files on the linux side of the share, so windows can access them properly?
2009-04-26T14:47:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	Yep
2009-04-26T14:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	  NOW you are making more sence
2009-04-26T14:48:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	at the moment I can only see them if I set the directory to 755 and the file to 644
2009-04-26T14:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	schone	  that makes sence.
2009-04-26T14:49:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	Yep, the problem is that I have over 600 directories which contain files. Now I was wondering if there way with busy box to automatically go through each directory set 755 and then go through each file and set 644
2009-04-26T14:50:00.000Z	schone	Dr_Willis	or alternatively, one chmod that I can just apply to everything
