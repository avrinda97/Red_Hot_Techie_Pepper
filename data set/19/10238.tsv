2006-10-18T12:38:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	setxkbmap es
2006-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	ok...let me see...
2006-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	oh man you are God!!!
2006-10-18T12:40:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	:) you'll want to change it in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf as well
2006-10-18T12:40:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and find the line that has XkbLayout set it to es instead of us
2006-10-18T12:42:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	i will tell you the truth,... I am trying to configure XGL and there is a step that I have to do this xmodmap /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.us...i would like to load the correct keyboard
2006-10-18T12:43:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	man, I cant use alt key...with that command you told me :(
2006-10-18T12:46:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	try setxkbmap es nodeadkeys
2006-10-18T12:47:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	cant use alt+F2
2006-10-18T12:48:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	open up a terminal and type it in there
2006-10-18T12:48:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	yes I have already done it, but still having problems with alt F2
2006-10-18T12:51:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	try in #ubuntu-es they probably have more experience with spanish keyboards :)
2006-10-18T12:51:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	ok...thanks!
2006-10-18T12:52:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	but, how can I restore the old state of the keyboard, after i did what you told me?
2006-10-18T12:52:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	setxkbmap us
2006-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	setxkbmap -layout es -model pc101
2006-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	aoupi	jessid	or pc102 might work
2006-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	jessid	aoupi	where do you get those arguements?
