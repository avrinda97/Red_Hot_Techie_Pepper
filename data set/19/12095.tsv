2006-07-09T08:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	sudo apt-get install xchat
2006-10-27T06:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	its not gonna change a bit in the next week
2006-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	reiki	gnomefreak	that's encouraging :)
2006-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	the repos are closed
2006-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	we are thinking around 2 weeks
2006-10-27T06:35:00.000Z	reiki	gnomefreak	it's killing me that I have 2 physical drives here and I'm too stupid about GRUB to know how to get it to simply boot the old drive (with a complete Dapper on it) so I could experiment with upgrading that dsrive before upgrading my main drive
2006-10-27T07:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	if you mess up yes
2006-10-27T07:01:00.000Z	reiki	gnomefreak	basically I just want to boot hda1 instead of sda1. The boot images are in place and all that. Only entry I'm not sure of the the hd0,0 one
2006-10-27T07:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	in the line replace sda with hda but you should have UUID
2006-10-27T07:02:00.000Z	reiki	gnomefreak	UUID?
2006-10-27T07:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	what does it say on the kernel line
2006-10-27T07:03:00.000Z	reiki	gnomefreak	/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-25-386 root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
2006-10-27T07:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	change the s to an h
2006-10-27T07:04:00.000Z	reiki	gnomefreak	 better idea to just copy that entry and make the change? To preerve the original so I can back out if needed
2006-10-27T07:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	reiki	no just change the s to an h
