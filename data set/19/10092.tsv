2007-08-03T05:06:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	well let's start with the first one then :)
2007-08-03T05:11:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	what error does it give you?
2007-08-03T05:12:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	have you installed build-essentials?
2007-08-03T05:13:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	you can install software over system->administration->synaptic package manager
2007-08-03T05:18:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	at least we know that sudo works :)
2007-08-03T05:20:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	have a look here: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2007-08-03T05:21:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	scroll down the page to the list of repositories for  "debian-based linux distributions"
2007-08-03T05:22:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	my idea would be to add one of the virtualbox repositories to your repository list (/etc/apt/sources.list) and then try to remove virtualbox
2007-08-03T05:26:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	navigate in your file browser to /etc/apt and then click on sources.list. enter your password. add the correct line for your system from the list of repositories on http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (probably deb http://www.virtualbox.org/debian edgy non-free) and save
2007-08-03T05:29:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	korncob	have you entered the name of the repository correctly?
