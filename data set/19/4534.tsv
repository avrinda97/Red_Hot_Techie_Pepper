2009-04-22T14:29:00.000Z	randhol		I can connect with my wireless in xfce4/gnome, but when I try to follow how to do it manually with iwconfig it won't work. I can use iwlist ra0 scan to see all the available nets. I do sudo iwconfig ra0 essid "net-name", sudo iwconfig ra0 key open, sudo dhclient ra0, but the dhclient just asks and asks for an IP. what have I forgotten to do or is there some NetworkManager black magic?
2009-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	Which encryption scheme is in use on your wireless network?
2009-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	I'm trying to access an open univeristy net now
2009-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	Hrmmm.
2009-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	Does iwconfig say 'unassociated', or '802.11something'?
2009-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	Should be in the top left.
2009-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	no
2009-04-22T14:34:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	What does it say?
2009-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	ra RT2860 Wirelss... ESSID: "name-i-gave"  Nickname: "RT2860STA"
2009-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	etc
2009-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	Link quality 82/100
2009-04-22T14:36:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	What does it say just before the ESSID?
2009-04-22T14:36:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	Huh. It should normally give its association status there.
2009-04-22T14:37:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	do i need to do anything with iwpriv? iwconfig says Mode is managed
2009-04-22T14:37:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	That mode is fine. you probably don't need to touch iwpriv.
2009-04-22T14:38:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	ok, but is thhere some nm magic I'm missing?
2009-04-22T14:38:00.000Z	wgrant	randhol	I don't know, sorry.
2009-04-22T14:40:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	iwconfig gives correct access point
2009-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	randhol	wgrant	I noticed one thing and that is tthat iwconfig is not setting essid after all. seems nm-applet had done it.
