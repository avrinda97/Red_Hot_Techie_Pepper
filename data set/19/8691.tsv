2007-12-18T15:41:00.000Z	ifireball		well they did warn everyone they were doing maintenance...
2007-12-18T15:43:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	the latter
2007-12-18T15:43:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	basically I have music on my hard drive and I want to label it
2007-12-18T15:44:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	well amarok can do that for kde, exile for gnome
2007-12-18T15:44:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	really?? Let me check it out
2007-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	personally I just use id3v2 and some scripting... but that thats just my old unix habits...
2007-12-18T15:57:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	ok I have amarok running.. how do I get it to scan my mp3s and label them correctly?
2007-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	it worked for me, (on Debian though) isn't it a simple matter of right-clicking the file in Amarock and selecting "fill in details from musicbrains" ?
2007-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	yes that's one track at a time
2007-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	but if you have 100 albums that's a little painful
2007-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	you can multi-select no?
2007-12-18T16:09:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	not really.. try it
2007-12-18T16:10:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	also it seems to leave the file name  being awful too
2007-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	well, don't have amarock here, then again that Picard may do the trick for you, also try EsayTAG for mass-naming and tagging
2007-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	I can live with scripting :)
2007-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	do you rename the files too or just add some metadata?
2007-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	that really depends on what I'm doing, when you're scripting you can do both easily...
2007-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	lesshaste_	ifireball	ok.. I am eventually moving this stuff to an ipod nano... I'm not sure what it needs basically
2007-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	ifireball	lesshaste_	trial and error I suppose... anyway good luck, I gtg for now
