2005-02-19T13:01:00.000Z	tritium	guim	that date is for isolinux
2005-02-20T07:35:00.000Z	tritium	guim	did you use "cdrecord -scanbus" to find your drive?
2005-02-20T07:35:00.000Z	tritium	guim	what type of drive?  atapi?
2005-02-20T07:38:00.000Z	tritium	guim	nautilus doesn't use cdrecord
2005-02-20T07:41:00.000Z	tritium	guim	can you "dmesg | grep CD"
2005-02-20T07:43:00.000Z	tritium	guim	try "cdrecord dev=ATAPI: -scanbus" if you want cdrecord to find it.  Again, though, nautilus doesn't use cdrecord.
2005-02-20T07:46:00.000Z	tritium	guim	any luck?
2005-02-20T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	guim	"cdrecord dev=ATAPI: -scanbus"
2005-02-20T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	guim	something like this: 0,1,0     1) 'TOSHIBA ' 'CDRW/DVD SDR2102' '1D13' Removable CD-ROM
2005-02-20T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	guim	no, this is to find the drive, not burn the image yet
2005-02-20T07:51:00.000Z	tritium	guim	once cdrecord is configured, then you can use it until we figure out your nautilus problem
2005-02-20T07:56:00.000Z	tritium	guim	did you get cdrecord configured?
2005-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	guim	and did you add a line with "CDR_DEVICE=liteon" ?
2005-02-20T08:04:00.000Z	tritium	guim	it should work, now
2005-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	tritium	guim	is the cd blank media, or not?
2005-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	tritium	guim	okay, so it shouldn't be mounted.
2005-02-20T08:47:00.000Z	guim	tritium	I install k3b
2005-02-20T08:57:00.000Z	tritium	guim	sorry, I got caught up with work.  Good, I'm glad you have a solution.
2005-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	tritium	guim	yes, I agree
