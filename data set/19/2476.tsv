2011-05-12T19:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	can you connect the desktop to the router by ethernet or are you using the laptop as a gateway
2011-05-12T19:41:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	The latter. The laptop picks up the connection, and then the desktop is connected to the laptop via ethernet cable
2011-05-12T19:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	your laptop is using a 3g/4g cell connection to the internet ?
2011-05-12T19:43:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	It's using WiFi
2011-05-12T19:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	wifi router ?then connect the desktop to the router ethernet port
2011-05-12T19:45:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	If I could connect my desktop directly to my wireless router, I would have
2011-05-12T19:46:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	I can't, since the router is connected to another desktop.
2011-05-12T19:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	how many ports on the router , most have 4
2011-05-12T19:49:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	I don't know, but I know that the ethernet cable is not going to reach all the way to the router.
2011-05-12T19:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	try this if you don't want to buy a longer cable .http://www.linuxaria.com/article/how-to-ubuntu-gateway?lang=en&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Linuxaria_En+%28Linuxaria%C2%BB+English%29
2011-05-12T19:55:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	The gateway is running Windows, though. The desktop is the one on Ubuntu.
2011-05-12T20:02:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	I tried the link as much as I could. It didn't seem to do anything
2011-05-12T20:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	the best solution to your problem is to get a longer ethernet cable ...ther may be a workaround , but your situation is very unu8nusual, so unlikely to find a solution here , unless of course both machines were linux , then you could ssh into the targer pc and call up a browser and connect that way
2011-05-12T20:14:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	Somehow I doubt they have ethernet cables that go from the second floor of a house all the way to the basement. So that's kinda out of the question.
2011-05-12T20:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	well , I do :)
2011-05-12T20:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	one can buy usb wifi adapters that work out of the box for windows desktop pcs
2011-05-12T20:17:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	It's not running Windows, though
2011-05-12T20:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Golden_Kumquat	some work in linux as well, but one has to do some research before buying
2011-05-12T20:19:00.000Z	Golden_Kumquat	BluesKaj	Still, it's a workaround solution. There has to be a solution that doesn't involve buying stuff, otherwise they need to work on a fix for it.
