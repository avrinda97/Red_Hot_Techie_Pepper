2009-10-30T16:25:00.000Z	ASrock		i would like a gui if that is possible
2009-10-30T16:25:00.000Z	ASrock		would that be under System>Administration?
2009-10-30T16:26:00.000Z	ASrock		it looks like jockey found it
2009-10-30T16:28:00.000Z	ASrock		um, but jockey cant actually install the driver it said "failed to fetch (long link) could not resolve 'us.archive.ubuntu.com"
2009-10-30T16:28:00.000Z	ASrock		oh i feel stupid, havent connected to my wireless :P
2009-10-30T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	that'll do it
2009-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	what video card?
2009-10-30T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	nvidia-settings   then
2009-10-30T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	it gets installed when you install the driver
2009-10-30T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	it is a gui
2009-10-30T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	i suggest you run: gksudo jockey-gtk
2009-10-30T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	sounds like you havent installed the driver
2009-10-30T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	awesome, once its done, reboot and you can use nvidia-settings to configure stuff
2009-10-30T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	what driver did it recommend, the 185>
2009-10-30T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	network manager will handle that
2009-10-30T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ASrock	well, logically twinview wold clone the displays like a pair of twins
