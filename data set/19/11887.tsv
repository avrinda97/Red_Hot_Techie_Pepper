2005-11-07T16:35:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	Dell printers are usually Lexmark
2005-11-07T16:37:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	What model is your printer?
2005-11-07T16:37:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	That is made by Lexmark.
2005-11-07T16:38:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	Looks like Z615
2005-11-07T16:39:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	google for: dell 720 lexmark
2005-11-07T16:40:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	Dell charge UK26 for a cartridge. The lexmark cartridge cost UK 17
2005-11-07T16:40:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	But you can ue a pair of pliers to modify it.
2005-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	It is best to install everything through the package management system. There are 15,000 packages available through there, and they are likely compatible :0

2005-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	In a busy channel, it can help by quoting the name of the person you are replying to. This way, the chat program will highlight the line. Otherwise, I might miss a replay
2005-11-07T16:51:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	Like in Xchat, type the first few letters then tab will complete the name.
2005-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	That works. Although you don't need to use quotes. Which chat program do you use?
2005-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	Try typing Nick_ then press tab. See what happens
2005-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	hav0k	Nick_Hill	ahh
2005-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	hav0k	Nick_Hill	yeah, i never figured that out
2005-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	hav0k	Auto-completion, like bash provides on the command line.
2005-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	hav0k	Nick_Hill	cool
