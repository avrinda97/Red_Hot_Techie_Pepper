2010-08-29T21:08:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	in the volume applet, try tinkering with the output device selections
2010-08-29T21:11:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	how do I know when the change "takes"?  As soon as i make the selection, after closign the app, or do I have to reboot?
2010-08-29T21:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	keep something running that makes sound and change it, no reboot needed
2010-08-29T21:12:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	you're talking about the hardware, or output tab in the volume control app?
2010-08-29T21:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	output
2010-08-29T21:13:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	ok then, I've got nothing
2010-08-29T21:15:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	do you have the latest kernel updates? sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-08-29T21:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	if a new kernel was installed (linux-image package) reboot and try again, if not, try installing linux-backports-modules-alsa-lucid-generic and reboot
2010-08-29T21:46:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	ok, everything is updated, installed linux-backports-modules-alsa-lucid-generic, and still no sound.  I can go into alsa and monkey with all the faders, but there's no sound coming out of any hole on the card
2010-08-29T21:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	there are a couple of bugs filed on that card but no comments whatsoever
2010-08-29T21:50:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	huh...  Used to work in gutsy; that's odd
2010-08-29T21:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	that's been mentioned ..
2010-08-29T22:17:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	hey there; I've got sound now.  Threw in a new card, disabled the old one in BIOS...  Now sound is choppy though, after a couple of seconds
2010-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	things like system sounds play fine though (they're short)
2010-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	paulmain	uninstall the backports package and try
2010-08-29T22:19:00.000Z	paulmain	ilovefairuz	I did that before I came in
