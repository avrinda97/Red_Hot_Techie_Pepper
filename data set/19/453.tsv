2012-03-21T22:22:00.000Z	xubuntu6		down voteBitlocker is a proprietary, closed-source drive encryption system only supported by Windows. You'll have to remove Bitlocker encryption if you want to access your Windows partitions from Linux.See http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-the-difference-between-disabling-BitLocker-Drive-Encryption-and-decrypting-the-volume ...for instructions on doing so. It would be advisable to have a backup of your data

2012-03-21T22:24:00.000Z	vlt	xubuntu6	Well, it can be very annoying if you accidentally move your mouse somewhere and suddenly someone shouts at you.
2012-03-21T22:24:00.000Z	xubuntu6		haha that's very true vit
2012-03-21T22:25:00.000Z	xubuntu6		especially if your volume was up high
2012-03-21T22:25:00.000Z	xubuntu6		or connected to your yamaha vsx-21txh with def tech speakers lol
2012-03-21T22:26:00.000Z	vlt	xubuntu6	Until last week I had the problem that everytime I logged in my volume was set to 100%. Even after disabling the Ubuntu jingle (played at -0dB! before) I sometimes moved the mouse too close to an audio file :O
2012-03-21T22:28:00.000Z	vlt		Btw, I solved the audio volume at 100% issue by putting a script to /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ that sets audio volume to 12%.
2012-03-21T22:29:00.000Z	xubuntu6	vlt	sets that at startup to 12%?
2012-03-21T22:30:00.000Z	vlt	xubuntu6	The script sets audio volume to 12%, yes.
2012-03-21T22:31:00.000Z	vlt	xubuntu6	12% is fine for nearly anything, so you can imagine how much my neighbours hated me after I upgraded to 11.10 â€¦
