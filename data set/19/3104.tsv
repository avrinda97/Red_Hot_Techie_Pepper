2010-08-18T02:07:00.000Z	aafuentes		http://pastebin.com/4k5nvtUR <-- anybody can help me with this? (package system broken)
2010-08-18T02:08:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	Just off the top of my head.  sudo aptitude install -f
2010-08-18T02:08:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	That command attempts to fix all broken packages.  Be sure to read what it wants to do and think about it before hitting yes blindly! :)
2010-08-18T02:09:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	sudo aptitude -f install
2010-08-18T02:11:00.000Z	aafuentes	edbian	--> new output... same error  :S http://pastebin.com/wUXtz6v0
2010-08-18T02:12:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	Did you try removing it?
2010-08-18T02:12:00.000Z	aafuentes	edbian	yep
2010-08-18T02:15:00.000Z	aafuentes	edbian	any Other guess from the top of your head? is it my package system broken forever?
2010-08-18T02:15:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	Where did this package come from?  A special repo or something?

2010-08-18T02:17:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	I think that package is written poorly.  I'm not sure how to remove it though :(  What command did you run to install it in the first place?  dpkg?  Did you download a .deb ??
2010-08-18T02:18:00.000Z	aafuentes	edbian	i tried dpkg -i package.deb ... then unmet dependencies, so i run apt-get install -f... then this nightmare began :(
2010-08-18T02:18:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	Can you sudo apt-get purge package    ??
2010-08-18T02:19:00.000Z	aafuentes	edbian	nop :(
2010-08-18T02:19:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	I'm not sure then.  Sorry! :(
2010-08-18T02:20:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	Good luck!
2010-08-18T02:24:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	I don't think you'll have to re-install.
2010-08-18T02:25:00.000Z	edbian	aafuentes	Ask the channel in a different manner.  "Why can't I remove a package from my system?"
2010-08-18T02:27:00.000Z	aafuentes	edbian	ill try...
