2010-04-04T03:22:00.000Z	tm0		Hi Ubuntu, what is the command line for removing a program, i just can't remember :(
2010-04-04T03:23:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	sudo apt-get remove program
2010-04-04T03:25:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	what's the error?
2010-04-04T03:25:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	it can't find the program.
2010-04-04T03:25:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	how did you install it?
2010-04-04T03:27:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	if you compiled, you can remove by deleting.. if you used apt or synaptic/software center, you use that to remove
2010-04-04T03:28:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	where is it located? /etc/ i assume?
2010-04-04T03:28:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	depends where you installed it and what steps you did
2010-04-04T03:30:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	i installed a .deb package.
2010-04-04T03:31:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	then you should use apt to remove
2010-04-04T03:31:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	It didn't work though. What annoys me is its in the applications menu.
2010-04-04T03:32:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	can you still access the program?
2010-04-04T03:34:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	Yes it says a file isn't useable. Regardless i need to upgrade it anyways.
2010-04-04T03:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	if it's not useable it could be a broken link.. try dpkg -l whatpulse
2010-04-04T03:36:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	then it's a broken link and your package is gone
2010-04-04T03:36:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	go into system menu and look for menu something or others
2010-04-04T03:38:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tm0	can you run it from terminal still?
2010-04-04T03:38:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	i still get errors but yes.
2010-04-04T03:41:00.000Z	tm0	Out_Cold	thank you anyways :)
