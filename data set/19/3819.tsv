2009-05-23T13:56:00.000Z	myxo		hilarious, sitting in my townhouse parking lot leeching internet because my wireless router isn't here yet lol
2009-05-23T13:56:00.000Z	myxo		yay for battery live
2009-05-23T13:58:00.000Z	myxo		i'm looking for a software to "watch" my roommates and sort of manage the load on me and my roommates wireless network to make sure no one is hogging all the bandwidth, is there a good Ubuntu Package for that?
2009-05-23T13:59:00.000Z	myxo		idespnnr what do you mean inline
2009-05-23T14:00:00.000Z	airtonix	myxo	you need to have a linux machine acting as the router before your wireless device. then you need to setup several packages
2009-05-23T14:00:00.000Z	myxo		ah ok, well i'm not doing that airtonix
2009-05-23T14:00:00.000Z	myxo		any simpler way?
2009-05-23T14:00:00.000Z	airtonix	myxo	use squid for bandwidth control
2009-05-23T14:00:00.000Z	airtonix	myxo	jnettop for realtime network monitoring
2009-05-23T14:01:00.000Z	myxo	airtonix	squid eh? thats for my machine right?
2009-05-23T14:01:00.000Z	myxo	airtonix	monitoring IS all i need really, so that would be good
2009-05-23T14:01:00.000Z	airtonix	myxo	no you use squid on the machine acting as the 'gateway' between the home network and your wireless access device
2009-05-23T14:03:00.000Z	airtonix	myxo	with squid you can setup riles to limit bandwidth usage from and/or to ip/hostnames
2009-05-23T14:03:00.000Z	airtonix		rules*
2009-05-23T14:04:00.000Z	airtonix	myxo	but its not easy if you don;t already know how
2009-05-23T14:04:00.000Z	myxo		i might have to move to a diff parking spot, internet is getting spotty
2009-05-23T14:09:00.000Z	myxo	airtonix	then it won't be easy for me lol, i am willing to learn anything tho
2009-05-23T14:09:00.000Z	myxo	airtonix	or at least try, perhaps try now, learn later..
