2007-03-07T09:53:00.000Z	ToddEDM		i installed the .deb of unrar-free , but where do i find it ?????????????????//
2007-03-07T09:53:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	it is command line
2007-03-07T09:58:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	you are looking for how to use it, not where it is
2007-03-07T09:59:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	do man unrar-free it will tell you
2007-03-07T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	I have unrar, the non free version, else I would install and see
2007-03-07T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	do unrar-free --help, should be some condensed help that will be more usable
2007-03-07T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	the repos are debs
2007-03-07T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	nonfree means that it is not open source, it doesn't mean you have to pay
2007-03-07T10:10:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	it is called unrar
2007-03-07T10:10:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	you have unrar, the non free version, and unrar-free the free version
2007-03-07T10:11:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	are you on edgy?
2007-03-07T10:13:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	close synaptic, open the terminal (applications>accessories>terminal) and copy and paste this entire thing at once: sudo sed -e 's/# deb/deb/g' -e 's/edgy universe/edgy universe multiverse/g' -e 's/edgy-security universe/edgy-security universe multiverse/g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unrar
2007-03-07T10:15:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	it is enabling the extra repos, unrar is not in the main ones that are enabled by default being nonfree and all
2007-03-07T10:16:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	now you should be able to right click on a rar file and just choose extract here, if you want to do it command line, you will need to do rar e whatever.rar
2007-03-12T08:32:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	none exists
2007-03-12T08:32:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	set up a !chroot and install a 32 bit firefox and the plugins
2007-08-10T07:49:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	growisofs
2007-08-10T07:51:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	dvdstyler is decent
2007-08-10T07:51:00.000Z	bruenig	ToddEDM	you need to install its dependency
