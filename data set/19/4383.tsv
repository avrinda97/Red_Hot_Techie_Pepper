2009-01-26T00:26:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	Talking about WLAN
2009-01-26T00:26:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	ya basically.
2009-01-26T00:27:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	I've used wifi-radar for this on another distro and it went just fine. What kind of encryption does the TMO net use?
2009-01-26T00:27:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	not sure, good question though.
2009-01-26T00:27:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	You should definitely know this and the keyphrase to connect to it
2009-01-26T00:28:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	It might be WPA, I don't know if you can set it up with the network button in the upper bar
2009-01-26T00:28:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	ok, in vista it asks for nothing, you just plug it in and it just connects.
2009-01-26T00:28:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	So it should be an open network if you didn't enter any password or a thing like that
2009-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	Try connecting with wifi-radar, DHCP enabled.
2009-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	ok, let me see if I can nab that.
2009-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	Should be in apt-get or Synaptic
2009-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	ok, thanks.
2009-01-26T00:29:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	Does it work?
2009-01-26T00:32:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	trying it now'
2009-01-26T00:33:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	Ok, tell what it finds and what you get
2009-01-26T00:34:00.000Z	pjames	lackS	him program says it can't lauch?
2009-01-26T00:34:00.000Z	lackS	pjames	Open a console, fire it up there with sudo and see what it reports
