2012-11-03T01:26:00.000Z	linusoleander		Can I specify a pid file when using "nohup" ?
2012-11-03T01:26:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	No.
2012-11-03T01:26:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	Do you know anything similar to nohup which makes it possible to specify a pid file?
2012-11-03T01:27:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	Specifying a pid file will not help you at all. A pid file is not a running process, but a file.
2012-11-03T01:27:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	Yes, i know. But I need to pid for the process that's being started
2012-11-03T01:28:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	You cant predict the PID that is gonna be used.
2012-11-03T01:28:00.000Z	linusoleander		 bekks I want to tell the current application to use a specific file as pid pile
2012-11-03T01:28:00.000Z	linusoleander		*file
2012-11-03T01:29:00.000Z	linusoleander		nohup --pid /tmp/prod.pid && kill `/tmp/prod.pid`
2012-11-03T01:29:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	Like that ^
2012-11-03T01:29:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	That is not possible as I just stated.
2012-11-03T01:30:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	Why is that, it works with "rackup" for example
2012-11-03T01:30:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	I never heard of "rackup" until now.
2012-11-03T01:31:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	And killing a file, not a PID, is just nonsense.
2012-11-03T01:31:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	Yeah, I missed the cat part
2012-11-03T01:31:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	The idea of specifying a pid file for a process isn't strange at all. Why would it?
2012-11-03T01:32:00.000Z	linusoleander		I can do it for mysql, postgresql, redis and so on
2012-11-03T01:32:00.000Z	bekks	linusoleander	Because a "pid file" may contain everything - it doesnt have to contain a PID. And a process is not forced to actually create a PID file at all. Thats why it is nonsense.
2012-11-03T01:33:00.000Z	linusoleander	bekks	Yes, i know that is why I'm asking if there is a wrapper application which can store the pid in a file so I can access it later
