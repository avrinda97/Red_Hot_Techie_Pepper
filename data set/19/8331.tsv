2007-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		i woudl like to resize my disk partitions in order to do the feisty upgrade. i cant find the app anywhere except when i install. where is it normally?
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	do you mean GParted? Try typing 'sudo gparted' from the command line
2007-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	pelo: i can just install it cant i?
2007-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	yeah, but it makes more sense to just do it off the install cd
2007-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	the problem is that i need to partition it and move my files onto the new parition im creating before i install. if i do it from the live cd i can only add delete or modify them. not move shit around right?
2007-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	but if you install on the new partition won't it overwrite the files you just copied to it? Or do you want to make a new one, copy old files to that, and then install on your old partition?
2007-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	this is what im doing: i already have seperate partitions for /boot, /home, /var, /swap and /.  i also want to format them all again just to start fresh fresh. my /home is 120 gib but im using like 10 of it. so i want to resize my /home to make room for a new partition where i will store the files i want to keep, and format all the others. and then install again put the files back and resize the /home back to normal. make sense?
2007-04-20T07:42:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	seems like it would make more sense just to keep the /home partition and delete the files you don't want. I generally try to avoid resizing/moving partitions in case something goes wrong. What you are planning should work fine, but in any case, I hope you have a backup of important stuff in case it blows up...
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	wont everything just stay the same for setting and everything if i keep my home? grr maybe i'll just leave my /home alone
2007-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	yes, that is usually why you want to keep your /home. If you want to kill all your settings, then delete the .program_names (.mozilla for example) directories.
2007-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	i really would like everything to be completely fresh, apart from important files such as work documents and my lil indie movies, etc and music
2007-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	do you have enough space to copy the files you want to save to one of your existing partitions? If so, copy them over (so to /var/home or something), erase everything in your /home partition, and then copy it back.
2007-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	LVM is cool but fairly complicated
2007-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	i'll check out that site in one sec
2007-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	my var is fairly small, 3 gb or so
2007-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	it might squeek by though
2007-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	you are saying to move it there, format others, install while leaving /var the same. and then moving back after install?
2007-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	oblib	MrMakeveli	you can do what you were planning originally, probably without any problems. It's just a general rule to back up before messing around with partitions
2007-04-20T07:49:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	oblib	the problem is that this kind of IS my back up. haha
