2004-11-24T11:33:00.000Z	pdaoust		okay, here's a REALLY good one, for anyone with postfix experience
2004-11-24T11:33:00.000Z	pdaoust		my postfix program is set for local delivery after fetchmail sends all my POP3 mail there, but the postfix log is saying:
2004-11-24T11:34:00.000Z	pdaoust		postfix: config variable inet_interfaces: host not found: 127.0.0.0/8
2004-11-24T11:34:00.000Z	pdaoust		can't find 127.0.0.0/8?!?
2004-11-24T11:34:00.000Z	StarScream	pdaoust	is it in your /etc/hosts?
2004-11-24T11:34:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	does 127.0.0.0/8 need to be in /etc/hosts?!?
2004-11-24T11:35:00.000Z	StarScream	pdaoust	well its normally in there to begin with...
2004-11-24T11:36:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	sorry for my ignorance, but where would loopback be enabled? as in, the lo interface?
2004-11-24T11:39:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	/etc/postfix/main.cf is in #flood
2004-11-24T11:39:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	pretty simple config
2004-11-24T11:39:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	I'm using transport_maps instead of relayhost
2004-11-24T11:41:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	not supposed to be?
2004-11-24T11:42:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	I think I'll do that
2004-11-24T12:03:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	and ogra: thanks for the help; it turned out the interfaces were connected properly, but my /etc/postfix/transport wasn't
2004-11-24T12:14:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	that was weird; I got all my messages back (twice) -- looks like they were spooled!
2004-11-24T12:53:00.000Z	StarScream	pdaoust	you need to patch the source
2004-11-24T12:54:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	that's what I was worried about
2004-11-24T12:55:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	I'm trying to help out a person set up PPTP, and I'm not sure if they need something called the 'MPPE' patch
2004-11-24T12:55:00.000Z	pdaoust	StarScream	and ogra: hopefully they don't need it; hopefully pptp-linux will be sufficient
