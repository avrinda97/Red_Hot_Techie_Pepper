2009-11-22T01:17:00.000Z	Roasted		well, no kidding
2009-11-22T01:18:00.000Z	Roasted		I was kind of hoping for a common consensus on what the most common one was

2009-11-22T01:18:00.000Z	moymoy	Roasted	i would use Vinagre for VNC, but i much prefer ssh anyway
2009-11-22T01:19:00.000Z	Roasted	moymoy	- can you SSH through a gui? I've only ran SSH through the terminal.
2009-11-22T01:19:00.000Z	moymoy	Roasted	i don't know if there are any GUI tools for ssh, but you can use GUI programs through ssh
2009-11-22T01:19:00.000Z	Roasted	moymoy	- thanks. I've ran SSH to do terminal work to my desktop but I'd like to control the GUI now.
2009-11-22T01:20:00.000Z	moymoy	Roasted	if you use the -X option in ssh (ie. ssh -X) then you can type like `gedit` into the terminal, and a gedit window will pop up
2009-11-22T01:20:00.000Z	Roasted	moymoy	- well I want to have windows open on my desktop, then go to my laptop, take control, and have those same windows open.
2009-11-22T01:22:00.000Z	moymoy	Roasted	don't know how you could accomplish that with ssh, but i just find that vnc uses too much bandwidth
2009-11-22T01:30:00.000Z	moymoy	Roasted	LordVorp suggested NXserver and NX client.. judging from his reviews, it sound amazing
2009-11-22T01:31:00.000Z	Roasted	moymoy	- Ill check it out now. thanks!
