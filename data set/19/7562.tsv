2007-08-14T11:43:00.000Z	cafuego	WindsofTime	Starting a terminal does not quit X. If it does, you sdhould file a bug report, not tell us about it without showing us the script.
2007-08-14T11:43:00.000Z	WindsofTime	cafuego	i showed the script
2007-08-14T11:43:00.000Z	cafuego	WindsofTime	Oh sorry... must have pasted it when I wa soff in the other room.
2007-08-14T11:46:00.000Z	cafuego	WindsofTime	You're aware that all the lampp components are available (prepackaged) in Ubuntu, right?
2007-08-14T11:48:00.000Z	cafuego	WindsofTime	"/usr/bin/gksudo /opt/lampp/lammp start" in a standard launcher should do exactly what you want, without any need for terminals.
2007-08-14T11:48:00.000Z	cafuego	WindsofTime	The only problem I can foresee is if there is a bug in the /opt/lampp/lammp script.
2007-08-14T11:49:00.000Z	WindsofTime	cafuego	It isn't faulty if I am able to go manually into (the working) terminal and enter that.. and it does what its suppose to
2007-08-14T11:50:00.000Z	cafuego	WindsofTime	Can you pastebin the contents of the "<button>.desktop" file that was created when you made the button?
