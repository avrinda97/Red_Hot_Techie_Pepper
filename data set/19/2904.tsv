2011-02-06T03:02:00.000Z	Burzmali		Hello, is there a way to force an eject command against the loopback device?
2011-02-06T03:04:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	what do you want to do?
2011-02-06T03:05:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	I'm trying to install a game through Wine and it requires that the disks be switched.  Wine is clinging to the files on the iso, and won't allow and umount. I'm trying to force the issue
2011-02-06T03:07:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	wine is not standard ubuntu app, nevertheless, why dont you mount all your iso's at once
2011-02-06T03:07:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	say one as D: another as E: another as F: drives and so forth
2011-02-06T03:08:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	I would, but the game is pretty stubborn about insisting it be in the same drive
2011-02-06T03:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	then it's not ubuntu's fault
2011-02-06T03:10:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	Never said it was, I was just looking for a way to force an eject to the loopback
2011-02-06T03:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	sounds fancy they way you state it
2011-02-06T03:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	you mean unmounting a mounted iso?
2011-02-06T03:12:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	Can't umount, the iso has open file, hence the forcing part. The game is designed to eject an eject command to the disk drive
2011-02-06T03:12:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	why dont you just mount another iso on top of the first one?
2011-02-06T03:13:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	The open files prevent it
2011-02-06T03:14:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	Or at the very least, it appears that way, it silently fails to work
2011-02-06T03:14:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Burzmali	so the 'ejecting of loopback' you are refering to, are you doing that under wine?
2011-02-06T03:15:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	Nope, Wine can't help it's the one holding the files

2011-02-06T03:17:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	Looks like I can rename drives on the fly and trick the application into accepting two different locations
2011-02-06T03:17:00.000Z	Burzmali	mkanyicy	The funny part is that I have the disks, but some sort of latency issue if screwing installer.
