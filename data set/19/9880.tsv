2006-09-02T06:56:00.000Z	Kurimu		Basically, I am using a Ubuntu 6.06 CD; I always occasionally use ubuntu's Live-CD but always go back to windows, not the NTLDR doesn't work. I want to copy an image to my floppydisk and well... its not letting me. I tried that dd if=<image> of=<function>, but it doesnt work at all. It says the floppy disk is locked, and i can't mount any NTFS drives in hope of replacing those damaged files..
2006-09-02T06:56:00.000Z	Kurimu		btw i am a uber-linux noob ._.
2006-09-02T06:57:00.000Z	Kurimu		i dont even want to touch partitions right now, i have too much valuable info on the HD for something to go wrong
2006-09-02T06:58:00.000Z	Kurimu		i've had bad expriences with attempting to parition my drive :-/
2006-09-02T06:58:00.000Z	Kurimu		if i could only mount the main NTFS drive, i can simply replace the files; i have the files ready
2006-09-02T06:58:00.000Z	Kurimu		>_<
2006-09-02T06:59:00.000Z	Kurimu		its a .img and its 1.4MB
2006-09-02T06:59:00.000Z	Kurimu		....
2006-09-02T07:00:00.000Z	Kurimu		quick question, why cant Ubuntu mount NTFS drives; i've tried other linux distro and a few can. Ubuntu seems to me one of the most user-friendly
2006-09-02T07:00:00.000Z	Kurimu		this would all be so simple if it could -_-
2006-09-02T07:01:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	It says the disk is locked?? Is it mounted or something ? Oh hang on there is a write protect tab on a floppy. Check that?
2006-09-02T07:02:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	'It's not letting me' is not enough info. The exactly failure is needed.
2006-09-02T07:04:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	Unmount it. dd writes directly to the block device, not to the filesystem
2006-09-02T07:08:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	At a terminal type   umount /media/floppy
2006-09-02T07:09:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	sudo umount /media/floppy
2006-09-02T07:10:00.000Z	Kurimu	mutk	Okay, i think its unmounted
2006-09-02T07:11:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	Right, now you should be able to dd to the block device
2006-09-02T07:14:00.000Z	Kurimu	mutk	thanks alot... why couldnt that be that easy in the beginning? xD
2006-09-02T07:14:00.000Z	mutk	Kurimu	:)
