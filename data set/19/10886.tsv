2010-09-30T05:25:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	 unlikely but you could use the ppa for new drivers
2010-09-30T05:26:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	   https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates
2010-09-30T05:26:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	 the driver there is the 260.19.06
2010-09-30T05:28:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	  that ppa should work since that driver is slightly better than the nvidia_current offered in lucid
2010-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	  I have used that driver with fewer difficulties
2010-09-30T05:30:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	  yeah as long as you install it via that ppa... I would not suggest using the official driver ONLY because lucid makes it so you have to jump through a few hoops to get it installed
2010-09-30T05:30:00.000Z	coz_	kurt_	 so enable that ppa  and do an update and it should install automatically
