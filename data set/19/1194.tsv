2011-04-14T03:31:00.000Z	Guest40912		can anyone help with a problem i am having with avastAV
2011-04-14T03:32:00.000Z	Guest40912		once i installed it, it would not authenticate when i tried to enter key, so i just wanted to uninstall, but i cant seem to dothat
2011-04-14T03:32:00.000Z	Guest40912		i removed the package where i downloaded it, but it still shows under applications and accessories, i cant find it anywhere to uninstall it though
2011-04-14T03:33:00.000Z	Guest40912		no tips?
2011-04-14T03:34:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	have you looked in the package manager
2011-04-14T03:35:00.000Z	Guest40912		yeah, none of the package managers can find it, it installed with software center but cant locate it in there or synaptic, i even tried ubuntu tweak to see if i could locate something
2011-04-14T03:36:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	did you install it throug the package manager?
2011-04-14T03:36:00.000Z	tim		*software centre
2011-04-14T03:36:00.000Z	Guest40912		well, i downloaded from the website through my browser, and i clicked on the download in the browser and it opened software center to install
2011-04-14T03:37:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	it definitely opened the package manager?
2011-04-14T03:37:00.000Z	Guest40912		yes, it opened software center
2011-04-14T03:37:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	do the icons in your menu still work?
2011-04-14T03:38:00.000Z	Guest40912		well, kinda, it still wants me to authenticate with a key though, which didnt work before
2011-04-14T03:38:00.000Z	Guest40912		so yeah, the icon is functional but not the program
2011-04-14T03:38:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	the instructions of what to remove on uninstall are part of the package, i.e. from the people who's website it is
2011-04-14T03:39:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	if they didn't make it clean up after itself, you'd have to remove the stuff it left manually
2011-04-14T03:39:00.000Z	Guest40912	tim	thats what i cant seem to find, i search the system and nothing with avast shows up
2011-04-14T03:39:00.000Z	tim	Guest40912	if it were me, I'd go get that package (file you downloaded) again, open it with your favourite archive tool, and look in the package manifest for the files it install and where they went
2011-04-14T03:44:00.000Z	Guest40912	tim	so how do i do that in software center, cause i downloaded the package again but if i do anything with it, it start the center to install
