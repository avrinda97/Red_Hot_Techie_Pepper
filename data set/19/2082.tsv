2010-08-27T21:17:00.000Z	n0a1ias		hey, is wine the program i would use to install crisis?
2010-08-27T21:17:00.000Z	n0a1ias		nic, is it possible?
2010-08-27T21:19:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	ermmm. kinda of yes, but wine is more of an emulator and as such isn't that good at games... the specs required by crisis are high on a native OS...so through wine it will be vrey slow...
2010-08-27T21:20:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	hmm, is there any other way?
2010-08-27T21:26:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	what do you do with catman?
2010-08-27T21:27:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	i'm not shure, i saw it on a tab list and im trying to lean
2010-08-28T02:14:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	o nm then hah
2010-08-28T02:01:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	what you doing with your server then?
2010-08-28T02:02:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	vpn, samba, but thats complicated and i want the proxi serverby school so im compromising
2010-08-28T02:03:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	well vpn is harder than proxy imo
2010-08-28T02:04:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	yea so im starting here and moving up later
2010-08-28T02:05:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	fairynuff... i'm not sure a proxy will work depending on how your school does internet access. it's likely that they have a white list rather than a black list, that is sites they allow rather than sites they don't, meaning your proxy may not work...
2010-08-28T02:06:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	i dont think so, they used to have the ubuntufourms, then i went there alot and they blocked it
2010-08-28T02:07:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	hmmm then using your proxy alot wlil get that blocke too
2010-08-28T02:10:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	if your sister is in trouble im sure your school will tell you
2010-08-28T02:10:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	prolly not, its public.
2010-08-28T02:11:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	no they would
2010-08-28T02:13:00.000Z	n0a1ias	mickster04	what about you? you up for pm?
2010-08-28T02:14:00.000Z	mickster04	n0a1ias	what for? i won't be much specific help for you sorry...
