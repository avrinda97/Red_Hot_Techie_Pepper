2007-01-18T17:06:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	whats your question?
2007-01-18T17:06:00.000Z	Shaba1	juano	:  Ok can you get back the space that you dedicated to a unbuntu( or any linux) partition and not have it be seperate drive like c: d:
2007-01-18T17:06:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	you want to erase ubuntu partition and get it back for windows?
2007-01-18T17:07:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	go into partition magic in windows and just edit win partition and slide it all over the ubuntu partition
2007-01-18T17:08:00.000Z	Shaba1	juano	as I asked first. I was asking about Partition LOGIC (freeware) NOT Partition MAGIC($69)
2007-01-18T17:08:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	delete your ubuntu partitions with any partition editer
2007-01-18T17:08:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	then edit your win partition
2007-01-18T17:09:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	and slide it over the remaining free space
2007-01-18T17:09:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	this will resize the partition
2007-01-18T17:09:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	ive done this with partition magic and gparted never with partition logic , cause i never used it but it shouldnt be that different
2007-01-18T17:10:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	if you delete your ubuntu partitions, nothing to windows will happen, EXCEPT, you need to reinstall the windows bootloader
2007-01-18T17:11:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	do you have the windows CD at hand?
2007-01-18T17:12:00.000Z	juano	Shaba1	you need the windows cd, do you have it?
