2007-09-06T05:47:00.000Z	LukeEkblad		what will edUbuntu install on my computer?
2007-09-06T05:48:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	educational software...if you install the server version you get the chance to play with LTSP
2007-09-06T05:49:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 will this mess up my computer or somthing?
2007-09-06T05:51:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	it's ubuntu just with a different set of packages and apps....it didn't mess my computer up...not sure what it will do for you...
2007-09-06T05:51:00.000Z	boyam		!edubuntu | LukeEkblad
2007-09-06T05:51:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 ok, but dose it remove anything? or just install stuff
2007-09-06T05:52:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	go to the website in ubotu's message and check it out
2007-09-06T05:53:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	it's an OS based on ubuntu.....are you running ubuntu now?
2007-09-06T05:54:00.000Z	boyam		!enter | unagi
2007-09-06T05:55:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 yes
2007-09-06T05:58:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	then the quickest way to get a feel for edubuntu is to do a sudo apt-get install edubuntu-desktop.........this will give you a taste of edubuntu...it doesn't remove anything...it adds to what you have installed..
2007-09-06T05:59:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 ok awesome.  So this would be good if i'm in school?
2007-09-06T06:00:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	it depends, bulk of the apps are geared towards grade school level...however there are some apps geared towards high school/college...
2007-09-06T06:01:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 ok, cool
2007-09-06T06:01:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 thanks!
2007-09-06T06:01:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	if you don't like it just reverse the process and do a apt-get remove edubuntu-desktop
2007-09-06T06:02:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	preceed apt-get with sudo....of course you knew that already :P
2007-09-06T06:02:00.000Z	LukeEkblad	boyam	 alright, thanks
2007-09-06T06:03:00.000Z	boyam	LukeEkblad	np
