2006-06-15T05:12:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	it says i don't have right permissions to extract
2006-06-15T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	where are you extracting to?
2006-06-15T05:14:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	what does 'ls -ld /path/to/folder' say?
2006-06-15T05:15:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	oops...i was trying to extract to a folder that was created using sudo.  but i'mm still getting errors...
2006-06-15T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	what error?
2006-06-15T05:16:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	hmmm...i tried it again and now it worked.  i created a new folder and it worked fine.
2006-06-15T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	k, the other one must have just had some funky permissions
2006-07-13T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	I second irssi
2006-07-13T06:16:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	is it in the repos?
2006-07-13T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	yes, I believe it's installed by default actually
2006-07-13T06:17:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	i like something that isn't so much text-based, so yeah
2006-07-13T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	oh, you are missing out :)  other than konversation, I've seen someone here swear by kvirc
2006-07-13T06:18:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	so do you reccommend kvirc over x-chat?
2006-07-13T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	I've never used it, but it's something you can try out
2006-07-13T06:19:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	well i suppose i'll try this irssi you speak of
2006-07-13T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	just make sure you visit the irssi.org starter documentation to get started
2006-07-13T06:20:00.000Z	geeksauce	jrib	where is it?
2006-07-13T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	the docs are at http://www.irssi.org/documentation with the "startup HOWTO" as the first link
2006-07-13T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	geeksauce	yes
