2011-05-25T17:09:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	Try look into Power settings in the settings
2011-05-25T17:10:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	Might be an issue with screens saver or something
2011-05-25T17:12:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	Have you tried with another screen? Like the TV or something... might be hardware
2011-05-25T17:14:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	Could be... har to say. You also might wanna check the "gedit /var/log/syslog" or "gedit ~/.xsession-errors" for errors
2011-05-25T17:20:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	I think you need to wait for it to happen before you see the log.. could be pretty verbose otherwise..
2011-05-25T17:21:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	No, but you could check it directly after a reboot...
2011-05-25T17:22:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	or SSH into it from another computer
2011-05-25T17:23:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	You could also try another driver for the graphic card to see if it get's better
2011-05-25T17:24:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	Normally you don't need to go on the internet for that... depends little what card you have
2011-05-25T17:25:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	Although the vendor would probably have it on their site and that is probably the latest
2011-05-25T18:23:00.000Z	Almehdi	RAMLOCK	I think so... my wife is on a 82945G that works anyway
