2006-06-20T11:20:00.000Z	mooseman447		does anybody know why ubuntu randomly stops accepting connections across my network recently?
2006-06-20T11:22:00.000Z	mooseman447		does anybody know anything about my issue?
2006-06-20T11:22:00.000Z	mooseman447		sjoerd i do if my ubuntu box accepts connections
2006-06-20T11:24:00.000Z	mooseman447		sjoerd do you have webmin?
2006-06-20T11:24:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I don't think so because it doesn't mean anything to me
2006-06-20T11:26:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	It is already running, I can connect via ftp. Problem is that I have no idea how to add new users. And how do I permit them to only their own folders?
2006-06-20T11:27:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I read it enabled the system users by default. There should be more options though.
2006-06-20T11:27:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	The documentation from sourceforge doesn't seem to apply for ubuntu :(
2006-06-20T11:28:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	Like adding new users.
2006-06-20T11:29:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	My own account works, but adding users for ubuntu is not an option.
2006-06-20T11:30:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I want them to only have access to one folder in /var/www/
2006-06-20T11:32:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I know but still, I read it is possible to add users for just ftp.
2006-06-20T11:33:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	The pureftpd website does say so :)
2006-06-20T11:35:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I am reading the documentation, but it doesn't seem to apply for ubuntu
2006-06-20T11:36:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I found some things but not what i'm looking for as of yet

2006-06-20T11:37:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	as it appears, I wanted to try without it though
2006-06-20T11:38:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	mooseman447	I think you can using netstat
