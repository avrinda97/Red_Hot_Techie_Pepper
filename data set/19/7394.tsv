2007-09-11T16:25:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1		Say guys, whenever I try to configure my modem, I get an error message that says "Modem is Busy."  I have the modem link directed to a TTYS#, but nothing works.
2007-09-11T16:26:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1		Wait, why did the last half of my message come out?
2007-09-11T16:27:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1		Say guys, whenever I try to configure my modem, I get an error message that says "Modem is Busy."
2007-09-11T16:27:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1		What does that usually mean?
2007-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	VWJ1bnR1	cable "modem" or dial up modem?
2007-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	I'm sorry: I don't know what you mean.  I think it's dial-up.
2007-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	Is it a compatability issue?
2007-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	VWJ1bnR1	well is it the modem that provides the internet to your computer? or are you going to use it for faxing via a normal phone line?
2007-09-11T16:33:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	I'm going to use it as an Internet connection to my computer.
2007-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	I should probably mention I was using KPPP.
2007-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	VWJ1bnR1	so will it have to dial a number or does a cable tv type wire screw into the back of it?
2007-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	VWJ1bnR1	ah.. sounds like DSL.. is that right?
2007-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	It will have to dial a number.
2007-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	Please don't take this the wrong way, but why are you asking me all these questions?
2007-09-11T16:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	VWJ1bnR1	to determine the right kind of answers for your problem.. You didn't give enough info in the beginning to make any judgements.  There's a big difference between a DSL "modem" and a standard die-in-the-woll modem typically used for faxing.  If it's DSL, sorry I can't help.
2007-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1		I don't think it's DSL, but then again, I'm not sure.
2007-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	I don't think it's DSL, but then again, I'm not sure.
2007-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	VWJ1bnR1	there in lies the problem.  difficult to fix when the item is a mystery.
2007-09-11T16:40:00.000Z	VWJ1bnR1	Scunizi	Can we assume I don't have DSL?
