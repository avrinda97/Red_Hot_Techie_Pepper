2006-07-14T14:36:00.000Z	pvh		hi... is there any way to easily get a list of how much space various packages in an ubuntu install are taking up?
2006-07-14T14:36:00.000Z	pvh		i need to clear up space - delete big packages i dont' need...
2006-07-14T14:38:00.000Z	pvh		so what's taking up the extra space is extra scientific packages....
2006-07-14T14:38:00.000Z	pvh		'admin' password? you mean a user who is in admin group ?
2006-07-14T14:39:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	no i have my admin password but i forgot my root password
2006-07-14T14:39:00.000Z	pvh	sri_	then you can become root using 'sudo su' i think
2006-07-14T14:40:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	ya,but sudo su logs into admin account,but not in roots account
2006-07-14T14:40:00.000Z	pvh	sri_	no, it logs in as root...
2006-07-14T14:41:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	if u type su then u log into roots account
2006-07-14T14:41:00.000Z	pvh	sri_	yes, and then u can change the root password ;)
2006-07-14T14:42:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	How??
2006-07-14T14:42:00.000Z	pvh	sri_	passwd
2006-07-14T14:42:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	if we type that cmd then it asks for old password
2006-07-14T14:42:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	i changed the password before
2006-07-14T14:43:00.000Z	pvh	sri_	ok, then... do this: 'vipw' - that edits the password file
2006-07-14T14:43:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	1m
2006-07-14T14:45:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	ya i open it through my admin account then how can i change it??
2006-07-14T14:45:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	what is the process??
2006-07-14T14:47:00.000Z	sri_	pvh	can u tell about the password changing?
