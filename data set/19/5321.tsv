2012-01-19T22:56:00.000Z	epw		hello
2012-01-19T22:56:00.000Z	epw		I'm sorry to rush, but I have a fairly urgent problem that has got me really stuck
2012-01-19T22:56:00.000Z	epw		does anyone here have any experience with the Gnome bluetooth programs?
2012-01-19T22:58:00.000Z	epw		ok. I have a bluetooth adapter, and it was working just fine over the past few days
2012-01-19T22:58:00.000Z	epw		Today, when I have a phone interview I intended to use it for, my laptop has suddenly stopped even detecting that it has a bluetooth adapter at all
2012-01-19T22:58:00.000Z	epw		I have tried rebooting, switching the wireless hardware switch on and off
2012-01-19T22:58:00.000Z	epw		restarting the daemon
2012-01-19T22:58:00.000Z	epw		and can't find anything
2012-01-19T22:59:00.000Z	epw		have there been any updates in the last day or so that could have changed things so I need it now?
2012-01-19T22:59:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	epw	Does the bluetooth adapter still show as recognized?
2012-01-19T22:59:00.000Z	epw		I'll install it, but this sudden change has thrown me
2012-01-19T22:59:00.000Z	epw		not when I go to System->Preferences->Bluetooth
2012-01-19T22:59:00.000Z	gamerpro2000		I mean, does it still show as recognized as a USB device or PCI or whatever it is
2012-01-19T23:00:00.000Z	gamerpro2000		First of all, its it a dongle USB bluetooth?
2012-01-19T23:00:00.000Z	gamerpro2000		Or internal/
2012-01-19T23:00:00.000Z	epw		I don't see anything with lspci or lsusb, but unfortunately don't remember how it used to appear
2012-01-19T23:00:00.000Z	epw		internal
2012-01-19T23:01:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	epw	This might sound simple and stupid, but have you checked your BIOS to make sure it didn't randomly switch to disabled in there?  I've had BIOS do WEIRD things where it disabled Bluetooth or Wifi adapters without warning and had to be re-enabled.  Usually from low BIOS battery.
2012-01-19T23:02:00.000Z	epw	gamerpro2000	No, thanks, I'll try that soon
