2010-03-22T03:14:00.000Z	Resistol	histo	The story goes like this:  1 drive with fubared Vista...  I shrank it and made two partitions.  I had broken vista, but could not install ubuntu (no video after i asked it to start without making changes), so i put on win 7.  That worked fine, but then I removed the old partition and grew win 7 to fill the drive.  Now I'm getting this error...
2010-03-22T03:15:00.000Z	histo	Resistol	you getting the error booting windows 7?
2010-03-22T03:16:00.000Z	histo	Resistol	are you trying to dualboot windows 7 and ubuntu?
2010-03-22T03:17:00.000Z	Resistol	histo	i would love to, but i can' get ubuntu on the computer... and now i can't even get win 7 to boot
2010-03-22T03:18:00.000Z	histo	Resistol	ahh so windows 7 boot loader is fubar'd.  Try booting the 7 cd and see if they have a fixmbr option like xp/vista etc...

2010-03-22T03:21:00.000Z	histo	Resistol	that will allow you to get windows 7 to boot then you'll have to look at fixing wubi. I don't think it installs grub it just modifies windows bootloader
