2012-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	azi`		i would like japanese support in ubuntu
2012-07-04T14:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	azi`	have you tried adding it through the system settings?
2012-07-04T14:10:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	yes! it is not listed there
2012-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	gaelfx	azi`	it's listed in mine...are you sure you're looking in the right place?
2012-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	yes. on xfce though
2012-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	i have two laptops both on xfce one lists japanese the other only english

2012-07-04T14:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	azi`	yeah, that doesn't really help since it's just a list of installed languages, how did you get to that window?
2012-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	settings->language support->install/remove languages
2012-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	gaelfx	azi`	try running sudo apt-get update
2012-07-04T14:15:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	did that and nothing happened
2012-07-04T14:15:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	also tried dist-upate
2012-07-04T14:15:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	also tried dist-update*
2012-07-04T14:15:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	i think i might messed up the repositories.. is there a way to fix this?
2012-07-04T14:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	azi`	well, reinstall tends to solve those kinds of problems
2012-07-04T14:16:00.000Z	azi`	gaelfx	the repositories are in sources.list right?
2012-07-04T14:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	azi`	yeah, but that's probably not the best way to change them. there should be an app or someting called software sources, or else you have to open software center and find in the file menus "software sources"
