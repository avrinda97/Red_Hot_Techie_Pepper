2009-06-04T04:23:00.000Z	fresh_prince		Hello, I did "sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart" in order to restart USB and now I cannot moount my USB Hardisk anymore, any suggestions ?
2009-06-04T04:24:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	did you have an entry in /etc/fstab?
2009-06-04T04:23:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	reboot
2009-06-04T04:23:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	I just did that
2009-06-04T04:23:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	you rebooted after you restarted udev?
2009-06-04T04:24:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	yes
2009-06-04T04:24:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	I should probably try that another time with my HD unplugged
2009-06-04T04:25:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	I had not inserted anything manually
2009-06-04T04:26:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	but it doesn't seem to be in fstab
2009-06-04T04:26:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	do a ls /dev/sd*
2009-06-04T04:27:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	with the hdd plugged in
2009-06-04T04:28:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	sda   sda1  sda2  sda5  sda6  sda7  sdb   sdb1  (but I have a 2 windows partitions and the swap)
2009-06-04T04:28:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	you only have one internal hdd, correct?
2009-06-04T04:29:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	One internal, one external, (and was trying to plug in a USB flash drive, which also does not seem to work, but it is unplugged at this time)
2009-06-04T04:29:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	ok that means the system sees your usb hdd.
2009-06-04T04:30:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	look in /media to see if it was mounted
2009-06-04T04:30:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	no it is not, but i can see it in "Places" toolbar, but it says cannot mount
2009-06-04T04:31:00.000Z	cabrey	fresh_prince	sudo mkdir /media/disk && sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/disk
2009-06-04T04:34:00.000Z	fresh_prince	cabrey	I have to go now, I will try that soon.... thanks for the help :D
