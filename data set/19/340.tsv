2012-04-06T03:22:00.000Z	Malsasa		Hello, last night I have browsing with Oneiric. Then I don't know why, Unity crashed (strange) and I do sudo reboot. After reboot, I enter my password in LightDM. Appear black screen with so many messages (just 0.5 second) and the appearance back to LightDM. I enter my password again but the condition is same. I have tried this for +- 10 times. How to fix this? Thank you.
