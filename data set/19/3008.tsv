2009-11-08T00:45:00.000Z	Keen1		I am trying to install Ubuntu 9.10 X64.  However, when I get to step 4, neither of my 2 disks appears in the partitioner.  How can I continue installing?
2009-11-08T00:45:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Are they set up in raid?
2009-11-08T00:46:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	They might not be supported, they might require drivers, you could see if the alternate cd has drivers for your drives
2009-11-08T00:46:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Do a sudo fdisk -l in terminal
2009-11-08T00:46:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	it sees the drives
2009-11-08T00:46:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Tell me what it says
2009-11-08T00:47:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Ok so go to Computer and make sure you can access all the drives and that they are all mounted
2009-11-08T00:50:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	did you get that?
2009-11-08T00:52:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	the disk 1 with Windows 7 RC on it mounts just fine
2009-11-08T00:52:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	the other disk has nothing on it, and i dont think it will mount
2009-11-08T00:52:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Oh right it should mount ok, what type is it?
2009-11-08T00:54:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	even if i format disk 2 to something like NTFS, the installer still doesnt see it
2009-11-08T00:54:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	the installer doesnt show either drive, or any partitions at all
2009-11-08T00:55:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Hmm weird, is this thee first time you have encountered the problem?
2009-11-08T00:55:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	last time i installed ubuntu i didnt have this exact problem
2009-11-08T00:56:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	when i had more drives hooked up, it always wanted to install to the largest hard drive
2009-11-08T00:56:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	 but that isnt the problem this time
2009-11-08T00:56:00.000Z	conb123	Keen1	Erm well you could try restarting, other than that i really don't know
2009-11-08T00:57:00.000Z	Keen1	conb123	I have multiple times ... even unhooked the Windows 7 RC disk
