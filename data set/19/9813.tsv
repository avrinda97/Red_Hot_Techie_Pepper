2006-11-07T16:51:00.000Z	AlReece45	asdf_	network-admin automatically connects to any network you've connected to before. You have to go in with gconf and delete some keys related to the network ssids
2006-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	where abouts in gconf-editor?
2006-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	AlReece45	asdf_	ALT + FT, then type 'gconf-editor', open /system/networking/wireless/networks
2006-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	in system i don't have networking..only dns_sd gstreamer http_proxy proxy and smb
2006-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	any ideas?
2006-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	AlReece45	asdf_	are sure you sure you're in /system and not /schemas/system?
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	Yes, system is the last tab below schemas
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	AlReece45		asdf: which distro are you using?
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	Dapper
2006-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	I have /apps/default_setup/wireless ??
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	AlReece45	asdf_	Do you  have network-manager-gnome installed?
2006-11-08T17:03:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	Yes, but it does not detect my wireless
2006-11-08T17:05:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	do you know where the config setitngs are for network-manager
2006-11-08T17:07:00.000Z	AlReece45	asdf_	too unfortunate. I'm not 100% sure, but /etc/network/interfaces might be the file that network-manager uses
2006-11-08T17:08:00.000Z	AlReece45	asdf_	note that's a file, its not in gconf
2006-11-08T17:08:00.000Z	asdf_	AlReece45	I think that did it...I'm going to chekc
