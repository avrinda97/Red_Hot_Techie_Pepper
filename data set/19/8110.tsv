2007-10-19T01:28:00.000Z	backblue		i think it does not have like the compiz themes, or window managers or something...
2007-10-19T01:30:00.000Z	backblue		so there is solution for this compiz problem? no window manager?

2007-10-19T01:38:00.000Z	backblue		i should have emerald installed?
2007-10-19T01:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	backblue	Why?
2007-10-19T01:38:00.000Z	backblue	Amaranth	because i dont have! and i dont have window decorators
2007-10-19T01:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	backblue	emerald is not installed by default, we use gtk-window-decorator
2007-10-19T01:39:00.000Z	backblue	Amaranth	ok, in which packages, are the compiz fusion themes? and window managers?
2007-10-19T01:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	backblue	We don't have the emerald themes packaged
2007-10-19T01:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	backblue	It's just 5 themes with a million variations
2007-10-19T01:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	backblue	The decorators are in compiz-gnome, compiz-kde, and emerald
2007-10-19T01:40:00.000Z	backblue	Amaranth	i dont have any, at least it's what i think this problem it's.
2007-10-19T01:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	backblue	My guess is you use nvidia and thought you were advanced enough to set it up yourself instead of using restricted-manager :)
