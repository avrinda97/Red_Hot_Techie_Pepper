2006-12-16T17:41:00.000Z	crimsun_	mzanfardino	take a close look at the two libjavaplugin*.so
2006-12-16T17:43:00.000Z	mzanfardino	crimsun_	one is a logical link to /usr/local/jrel... while the other points to /etc/alternatives/firefox...
2006-12-16T17:43:00.000Z	crimsun_	mzanfardino	yes, now follow the /etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so symlink
2006-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	mzanfardino	crimsun_	 points to: firefox-javaplugin.so -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj/jre/lib/libgcjwebplugin.so
2006-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	crimsun_	mzanfardino	so more than likely you don't want that.
2006-12-16T17:49:00.000Z	mzanfardino	crimsun_	I removed the link to the /etc/alternative, retstarted firfox, and still no java... damnit, what am I doing wrong?
2006-12-16T17:52:00.000Z	crimsun_	mzanfardino	did you verify that the Sun one is valid?
2006-12-16T17:54:00.000Z	mzanfardino	crimsun_	I'm not sure how to verify that the Sun one is valid... how would I do that?
2006-12-16T17:56:00.000Z	mzanfardino	crimsun_	how do I verify that it's valid?
2006-12-16T17:57:00.000Z	mzanfardino	crimsun_	nm, I think I know what you mean
