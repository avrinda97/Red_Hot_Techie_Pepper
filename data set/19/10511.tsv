2007-02-19T12:09:00.000Z	Beltz		whats it for?
2007-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	Beltz		It's for very very low demand (to test apps)
2007-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	Beltz		Are some things missing in the server, that are in the desktop edition?
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	Beltz		No problems, I'm just curious if there is any downside to using the server edition actually
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	Beltz		Ack, no gui? Console only?
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	Beltz		So as a newbie, I should go with desktop, riiiiight?
2007-02-19T12:14:00.000Z	Beltz		So the day I'll need a dedicated home server, the server edition is best. but for personal use, and as the distro that will take my cherry, I should go with desktop. Confirm/deny?
2007-02-19T12:15:00.000Z	Beltz		okay
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	Beltz		Is there a LiveCD that lets me try out both xubuntu, kubuntu, ubuntu versions from the same CD? Or do I need to burn a bunch of cds?
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	bruenig	Beltz	bunch of cd's
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	Beltz	linxeh	thanks, I'm realizing that is probably best indeed
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	Beltz		alternate cd? That's a cd that has both server and non server on it?
2007-02-19T12:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Beltz	what are you looking for exactly, you can probably look at the features and whatnot of each and figure out, and look at screenshots
2007-02-19T12:18:00.000Z	bruenig		!po
2007-02-19T12:18:00.000Z	Beltz		thanks a lot
2007-02-19T12:18:00.000Z	bruenig		!pl
2007-02-19T12:18:00.000Z	Beltz		for all the advice
2007-02-19T12:19:00.000Z	Beltz		One final question - I have an ideal partition that I could split into many more (ie. my second harddrive has only data on it, no apps). IS there away to stick all its data on one side so that I can split one half of the partition in like 10 more partitions without losing data?
2007-02-19T12:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Beltz	on the install disk there is a partition editor
