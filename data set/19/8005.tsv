2007-05-18T16:40:00.000Z	Flannel	femfatale	does dist-upgrading try to install anything?
2007-05-18T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	femfatale	backup your config, then "completely remove" gdm (thats --purge with apt-get) and then reinstall it.  Hmm.  you might need to purge/reinstall feisty-gdm-themes, or any other themeish files like that.  but hte purge is the important part.  If you knew which files you edited, I could tell you which packages
2007-05-18T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	femfatale	actually, just use "dpkg -S [file] " to know which packages

2007-05-18T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	femfatale	How does that work?  You unzip that file where?
2007-05-18T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	femfatale	and how do you select it?
2007-05-18T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	femfatale	Go to your greeter chooser thing, and select a normal theme
2007-05-18T16:55:00.000Z	femfatale	Flannel	okay.. I hope that'd put it back to normal :D
2007-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	femfatale	Flannel	too bad though, because the login manager works great again.. heh, but I'm more worried about it working for good then looking pretty
