2007-04-06T09:52:00.000Z	sanzky		it repeats funex.... a lot of times then it stops with  ioctl(7, 0x4008642a, 0xbfdc4450)        = 0
2007-04-06T09:52:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	ioctl() seemed to be a success.  it is weird it stops there.  not sure
2007-04-06T09:48:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	not ati here but what problems?
2007-04-06T09:48:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	run it from the console.  (google earth)   any error output?
2007-04-06T09:49:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	hard freeze?  hogging cpu?  or just sitting with 0 cpu and not drawing?
2007-04-06T09:50:00.000Z	sanzky	xtknight	the splash screen is there, it uses 99% cpu  and it doesnt start
2007-04-06T09:50:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	perhaps ltrace or strace the program and see what's going on?
2007-04-06T09:51:00.000Z	sanzky	xtknight	this are the last lines i get with strace
2007-04-06T09:51:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	and do those repeat?  perpetually?
2007-04-06T09:51:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	or is that where the program(strace) stops printing?
2007-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	sounds more likely to be a problem with google earth.  beta program is it?
2007-04-06T09:55:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	where did you get that error though?
2007-04-06T09:55:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	hmm..  sure google earth was properly installed with all libs?
2007-04-06T09:56:00.000Z	sanzky	xtknight	running the bin file isnt enough?
2007-04-06T09:56:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	it should be
2007-04-06T09:56:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	maybe it had permission problems copying some files?
2007-04-06T09:57:00.000Z	xtknight	sanzky	if you installed it as root, you may also need to start it as root
