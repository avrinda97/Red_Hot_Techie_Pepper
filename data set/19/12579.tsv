2005-08-24T15:35:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	umm, go to ubuntu.com and download it
2005-08-24T15:36:00.000Z	LinuxDolt	DukGalNamu	uhh... i've had ubuntu installed for a few weeks now, i'm STILL trying to get my stinking printer shared
2005-08-24T15:36:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	ohh, that requires samba
2005-08-24T15:36:00.000Z	LinuxDolt	DukGalNamu	i have samba, and file shares are all working fine
2005-08-24T15:37:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	then it should be shared...
2005-08-24T15:37:00.000Z	LinuxDolt	DukGalNamu	oh, it is, but it can't find the dang drivers to install
2005-08-24T15:37:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	so you need your drivers?
2005-08-24T15:37:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	for the printer?
2005-08-24T15:42:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	still not sure what the problem is, you can't find the drivers for what?
2005-08-24T15:43:00.000Z	LinuxDolt	DukGalNamu	the printer, there are no printer drivers exported into /var/lib/samba/printers
2005-08-24T15:43:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	this is the wrong place to ask that
2005-08-24T15:43:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	head over to #samba and have ALOT of patience
2005-08-24T15:45:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	then why aren't you using gentoo?
2005-08-24T15:45:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	and why don't you export them manually?
2005-08-24T15:45:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	or how about compiling samba yourself?
2005-08-24T15:46:00.000Z	LinuxDolt	DukGalNamu	because ubuntu is a binary distro, and as such, supposed to operate out of the box much more quickly than the week it takes to get gentoo running in the first place
2005-08-24T15:46:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	yes, but it also will not always be working EXACTLY how you want it, so do a little dirty work if you want it perfect!
2005-08-24T15:47:00.000Z	LinuxDolt	DukGalNamu	i've never exported CUPS printer drivers to samba manually, where does CUPS keep them?
2005-08-24T15:48:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	LinuxDolt	man should tell you
