2009-08-31T07:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	you aren't being ignored, but you should be using #ubuntu+1 for questions about karmic
2009-08-31T07:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	it has not been released yet, so this channel doesn't support it
2009-09-28T08:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	lsb_release -a
2009-09-28T08:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	there is also /etc/lsb-release
2009-09-28T08:35:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	lstarnes	thanks!

2009-10-04T06:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	you will need to install it in firefox in wine, not the linux firefox
2009-10-04T06:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	windows uses separate APIs and binary formats
2009-10-04T06:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	ShapeShifter499	windows PE is not compatible with *nix ELF
