2010-03-10T13:25:00.000Z	WinterSky		Does anyone know of an app that I can use to detect and remove duplicate files? Currently I use fdupes to make a list and remove them by hand.
2010-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	how does fdupes work? depending on the format of the list, you can probably use the program xargs to remove the files in the list in one swipe
2010-03-10T13:28:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	fdupes creates a list with 1 file name on each line. So it takes 2 lines and lists both the file names with the same hash.
2010-03-10T13:29:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	would you mind pastebinning a few lines? i might be able to whip up a command for you
2010-03-10T13:33:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	Here it is: http://pastebin.com/FgjmJwLY
2010-03-10T13:35:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	wow, pastebin is *crawling*. i'll get back to you when it finally loads
2010-03-10T13:35:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	No problem.
2010-03-10T13:37:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	okay, so like you said, each pair of lines is the same file? what does it do if you have three copies of the same file?
2010-03-10T13:42:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	I'm not sure but I'll try
2010-03-10T13:43:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	okay. it's fairly simple to write something that will just delete every other file listed, but I want to make sure that won't have any strange side effects :)
2010-03-10T13:46:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	I tried making blank text files then 2 files with that had the number 1 inside so they'd have a different MD5. I found that it creates a blank line in between groups of files.
2010-03-10T13:47:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	ooh, that makes it tougher :) just a moment
2010-03-10T13:50:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	hm. i can't think of a way to do this in just a few lines, which would mean i'd hesitate to let someone else run it on data they care about :( sorry
2010-03-10T13:50:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	No problem. :)
2010-03-10T13:51:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	but if you can find someone who knows awk, they could probably do it. i'm just bad at awk :)
2010-03-10T15:00:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	I didn't find a visual program but I've been testing a script from here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=647883 (For duplicate files) and so far it works.
2010-03-10T15:02:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	glad to hear it!
2010-03-10T15:02:00.000Z	WinterSky	brjann	thanks for all of your help :) I really should learn python next...
2010-03-10T15:03:00.000Z	brjann	WinterSky	I've been meaning to do that, too. just never have the time...
