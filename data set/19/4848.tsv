2011-05-31T14:05:00.000Z	tanath	photon	'man mount'
2011-05-31T14:05:00.000Z	photon	tanath	sure, but what should I mount? there is no additional device in /dev/sd*, like there usually is.
2011-05-31T14:05:00.000Z	tanath	photon	sorry, missed the rest of your issue
2011-05-31T14:06:00.000Z	tanath	photon	restate?
2011-05-31T14:06:00.000Z	photon	tanath	I have successfully mounted my sd card, then safely removed it. now I want to remount it again, but after plugging it into the slot, Ubuntu does not recognize it. I presume this is because I previously unmounted it. how can I make it show up again?
2011-05-31T14:06:00.000Z	tanath	photon	shouldn't be because you unmounted it. it should detect it. wiggle it mebbe? plug again?
2011-05-31T14:07:00.000Z	tanath	photon	try different port?
2011-05-31T14:07:00.000Z	photon	tanath	it seems to be a known bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udisks/+bug/743303
2011-05-31T14:07:00.000Z	photon	tanath	will try\
2011-05-31T14:07:00.000Z	tanath	photon	i may have encountered that bug. usually using a different port works
2011-05-31T14:08:00.000Z	photon	tanath	I only have one SD card port
2011-05-31T14:08:00.000Z	tanath	photon	run 'nautilus -q' and try again
2011-05-31T14:08:00.000Z	tanath	photon	any file manager windows will close
2011-05-31T14:09:00.000Z	tanath	photon	alt+f2 > nautilus -q
2011-05-31T14:10:00.000Z	photon	tanath	did it, still now showing up. I think it's because I used "safely remove device" and not just "unmount" from the device's menu.
2011-05-31T14:10:00.000Z	tanath	photon	possibly, but you _should_ use safely remove
2011-05-31T14:11:00.000Z	tanath	photon	try sudo service udevmonitor restart
2011-05-31T14:14:00.000Z	photon	tanath	didn't do it. well, I give up. thanks for your support though. :)
2011-05-31T14:15:00.000Z	tanath	photon	would take more time to narrow down. if short on time a reboot is likely to work
