2010-07-13T01:33:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto		how can I set the default kernel for my computer to use?  I have several installed
2010-07-13T01:33:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto		before we changed to grub2, it was just a matter of editing the menu.lst, now things are all different
2010-07-13T01:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	GRUB_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub.
2010-07-13T01:34:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	ok, will chech that out
2010-07-13T01:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	You can either use a menu entry number, or the title of the menu entry (if you use the title then you don't have to worry about new kernels making the title number change)
2010-07-13T01:38:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	ok, I will add it there, thanks for the info,
2010-07-13T01:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	You're welcome.
2010-07-13T01:43:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	is there a way to look at my grub menu without rebooting? so I can count and set the number?
2010-07-13T01:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	I would personally just use the menu entry title, it's more robust. Either way, this command will get you the list of menu entry titles: sudo grep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg | grep -o '".*"'
2010-07-13T01:46:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	yes, actually I just figured out/remembered number solutions are subject to change based on newer kernels etc.
2010-07-13T01:50:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	ok, thanks a bundle, that didn't seem to spit out any errors, so we should be good now,
2010-07-14T05:52:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	hey you helped me out a day or so ago with grub2 and setting the default kernel, didn't seem to stick, we edited the /etc/default/grup and changed the 0 to saved, then sudo grup-default-update (or something like that) and the kernel "Ubuntu, kernel number"  didn't seem to stick any ideas?
2010-07-14T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	Did you run "sudo update-grub" after changing /etc/default/grub ? What is the exact command you used with grub-set-default?
2010-07-14T05:54:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	ahh, no, I didn't, that probably is why, let me give that a try
2010-07-14T05:55:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	is there a way to tell what is set as default without rebooting?
2010-07-14T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	You can look in /boot/grub/grubenv, or install grub-emu if you really want.
2010-07-14T05:59:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	ok, thanks a bundle again
2010-07-14T05:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shane2peru_lapto	You're welcome.
2010-07-14T06:00:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	Jordan_U	just checking the /boot/grub/grubenv was easy enough. quick and simple, gotta love it.
