2007-03-12T14:31:00.000Z	U-Anon		This is uncool, I compiled 2.6.20.2 and now Ubuntu doesnt recognize my wireless card, but with 2.6.17-11-generic it does, any ideas what I can do?
2007-03-12T14:32:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	what wireless card do you have?
2007-03-12T14:34:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	Looks like its something 'Atheros' AR5005G ?
2007-03-12T14:37:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	do you have the madwifi installed?
2007-03-12T14:37:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	No sir, I dont even know what that is
2007-03-12T14:37:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	But the thing is that under current kernel my wireless works perfect, under the newest one, it does not
2007-03-12T14:38:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	i had the same problem with linux mint.. which is based on ubuntu
2007-03-12T14:38:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	Were you able to solve it?
2007-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	yes... but remember to install the linux-restricted-modules-2.6.??? what you have ok
2007-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	the new kernel
2007-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	Wait, while Im compiling?
2007-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	no after
2007-03-12T14:40:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	Through apt-get am I right?
2007-03-12T14:40:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	 i thought i had to recompile. but i did not have to...
2007-03-12T14:40:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	first do the apt-cache search madwifi* line
2007-03-12T14:42:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	i had to install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-386 and linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic for the 2.6.17-11 kernel to work
2007-03-12T14:42:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	Thats funny because in that Kernel my WiFi works great, but in 2.6.20.2 it does not
2007-03-12T14:43:00.000Z	tuskernini	U-Anon	mine too.. but in linux mint it did not... so you have to install the 2.6.20.2 versions...
2007-03-12T14:44:00.000Z	U-Anon	tuskernini	Got you, will tr thanks
