2007-12-17T09:12:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8		Okay, so I DLed the 7.10 64-bit install ISO to my desktop, burned it to a CD-RW, but it won't read from it
2007-12-17T09:13:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8		I did it the second time at 4x speed
2007-12-17T09:13:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8		Can someone guide me on how to boot from the installation CD I make from the website?
2007-12-17T09:13:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	burned it how? using what program?
2007-12-17T09:14:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	which cd writer?
2007-12-17T09:15:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	did you check the md5?
2007-12-17T09:19:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	if the md5 sum doesn't match, you can burn it ten times and it wont matter
2007-12-17T09:21:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	that question meant for me? to get someone's attention use their nick to highlight them
2007-12-17T09:21:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	the same place you download the iso from has a md5 to match that iso--download that as well then check from it upon download of the iso
2007-12-17T09:22:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	same mirror means same download source
2007-12-17T09:26:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	if you choose open with cd/dvd creator
2007-12-17T09:26:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8	bazhang	 that's what I've been doing
2007-12-17T09:27:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	then it may be the media; do you have a blank cdr you can try it on?
2007-12-17T09:27:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8	bazhang	 I'll look
2007-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	if it is a cdrw it may have other stuff still on it
2007-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8	bazhang	it does. It had the previous copy of the iso, however when I tried to do the cdrecord, it didn't record.  It filled the screen with stuff and went right back to the cursor.
2007-12-17T09:33:00.000Z	bazhang	LinuxEzGer8	I've created plenty of drink coasters in burning iso files--you may want to get a stack of cdrs handy :}
2007-12-17T09:33:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8	bazhang	 Guess it's unavoidable.  PJs coming off, jeans going on.  To the store with me.
