2010-04-09T02:40:00.000Z	RyanP		I have a bunch of accounts with the group 'students'. I want to provide a person with read-only access to their home directories, but I don't want people in 'students' to be able to view each others home directories. Is there any way to do this?
2010-04-09T02:42:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	you'll probably have to resort to ACLs
2010-04-09T02:42:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	I'm assuming you don't want to create some new group, give the group ownership to all of those student's homes and then add that one person to that group
2010-04-09T02:44:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	I could do that, perhaps.
2010-04-09T02:45:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	How difficult are ACLs?
2010-04-09T02:45:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	I never found any good documentation, « man setfacl » and « man getfacl ».  They're not that difficult.  Note you have to remount the partition with the acl option
2010-04-09T02:46:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	I think I'll look in that direction. That seems to be what I need. Thanks.
2010-04-09T02:46:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	yes, they definitely give you a lot more control
2010-04-09T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	there's also eiciel (graphical editor for ACLs) that might make it easier to play with ACLs at first
2010-04-09T02:48:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	Thanks. Looks like something I don't want to just throw into a live environment though.
2010-04-09T02:49:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	well, I'd get comfortable with them first, but for something simple like you are doing, there's not much to worry about
2010-04-09T02:50:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	http://www.suse.de/~agruen/acl/linux-acls/online/ looks decent with some examples
2010-04-09T02:51:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	anyway, I'm off to grab some food
2010-04-09T02:51:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	Thanks. I think I can find what I need from here.
2010-05-08T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	what clipart out of curiousity?  It may be worth a bug report since edubuntu uses openoffice afaik
2010-05-08T01:36:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	It's nothing awful, but there's the pantyhose, a couple of people smoking and a cannabis leaf.
2010-05-08T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	I see.  Well I don't know how to refresh it, but try the openoffice channel:
2010-05-08T01:37:00.000Z	RyanP	jrib	I did. They suggested here.
2010-05-08T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	RyanP	heh
