2007-03-28T05:58:00.000Z	dave_		once i install w32codecs and mozilla mplayer with firefox plugin, i should be able to see windows medai files on the net right? For example ctv.ca
2007-03-28T05:58:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	with w32codecs yes it shouldn't be a problem
2007-03-28T05:59:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	been struggling for awhile and read all ubuntuguide.org and all wikis on net
2007-03-28T05:59:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	so exactly what's your issue now? And can you throw me a site that isn't working? I had issues with WMVs earlier and fixed it, hopefully we can do the same here
2007-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	ctv.ca
2007-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	will just go test, won't be a second
2007-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	try a video there, it uses windows media player
2007-03-28T06:03:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	getting video, no sound here, though that may be only as I had installed essentials - so where are you at so far - have you installed mplayer mozilla plugin and w32codecs?
2007-03-28T06:03:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	yes
2007-03-28T06:03:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	maybe i have to create a link in the plugins folder in firefox
2007-03-28T06:04:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	haha, sound actually did work, but something went funky on my system - does normal media work with mozilla-mplayer?
2007-03-28T06:04:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	once it does I'll throw you the guide to get WMV on Linux
2007-03-28T06:04:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	please do
2007-03-28T06:05:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	http://ubuntuos.wordpress.com/2006/08/01/howto-play-windows-media-video-wmv-in-ubuntu/
2007-03-28T06:05:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	I think the links are out of date, but the method still works - just go to mplayer.hq and download the essentials or all codec package
2007-03-28T06:06:00.000Z	dave_	Smerity	k thanks
2007-03-28T06:07:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	once that's done tell me how it goes, would be interested myself. I did the same thing for an Australian news service to get their WMVs working
2007-03-28T06:17:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	how are you going?
2007-03-28T06:49:00.000Z	Smerity	dave_	 did you get it working?
