2009-12-15T15:56:00.000Z	nigtv		im not sure what im missing but I cannot for the life of me burn a bootable cd in ubuntu
2009-12-15T15:56:00.000Z	nigtv		moreover, I dont know how to check outside of a virtual machine and im tired of wasting time and blank discs
2009-12-15T15:57:00.000Z	nigtv		however the iso does mount in ubuntu just fine, I just cant get it to be bootable
2009-12-15T15:57:00.000Z	nigtv		i tried that though
2009-12-15T15:57:00.000Z	nigtv		i also tried burning it like a should burn an image
2009-12-15T15:58:00.000Z	nigtv		and extracting the source daa and making a new iso
2009-12-15T15:58:00.000Z	nigtv		sorry, bad habit ;)
2009-12-15T15:59:00.000Z	nigtv		im stuck, i need to have xp on here tomorrow, I really didnt think it was going to be this complicated, but i do not know how to make it bootable, check if its bootable, so i have to burn it every time i try something new, and its an os so I cant really burn at a good speed or anything...
2009-12-15T16:00:00.000Z	nigtv		if i have the time
2009-12-15T16:00:00.000Z	nigtv		sorry enter thing again lol, yea i burned all of my tests tonight at under 4x
2009-12-15T16:00:00.000Z	airtonix	nigtv	did you first check the iso against the md5 ?
2009-12-15T16:01:00.000Z	nigtv	airtonix	yes, I did :/
2009-12-15T16:01:00.000Z	airtonix	nigtv	and have you tried burning other iso ?
2009-12-15T16:01:00.000Z	nigtv	airtonix	what other iso?
2009-12-15T16:01:00.000Z	airtonix	nigtv	anythin other than the one you are having problems with (preferrabley one that is bootable )
2009-12-15T16:04:00.000Z	airtonix	nigtv	you need to first 1) try burn another iso image that would be bootable and determine that your cd/dvd drive isn't on its way out
2009-12-15T16:04:00.000Z	airtonix	nigtv	also this is verging on offtopic
2009-12-15T16:05:00.000Z	nigtv	airtonix	i burned a debian iso tonight, and that worked great, and i ask here because i need to know how to check if an iso is bootable, and how to make it bootable if it isnt, in ubuntu
2009-12-15T16:05:00.000Z	airtonix	nigtv	ok then , from memory there are several tools in the ubuntu repositories for editing normal iso images
