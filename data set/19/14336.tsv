2009-10-26T15:43:00.000Z	psypher12		is that a good way to check disk usage?
2009-10-26T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 thats what i tend to use.
2009-10-26T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 thats a amazingly small partition for /
2009-10-26T15:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 you filled up your hd with stuff.. delete stuff. :)
2009-10-26T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 also the command -->  df -h -x tmpfs -x devpts -x usbfs
2009-10-26T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 gives cleaner output
2009-10-26T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 and yes.. i did learn that by reading the manuals. :)
2009-10-26T15:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 BT4?  You said you were using Ubuntu. :)
2009-10-26T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	 no its not.
2009-10-26T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psypher12	  amazing thing about 'BT' everyone that seems to use it that come in here.. seems to have very little linux experence at all.. makes me wonder why they decided to use it.
