2010-09-30T07:20:00.000Z	IConrad01		Hello...  have a tiny bit of an issue here, hopefully it'll be a simple one.
2010-09-30T07:21:00.000Z	IConrad01		How does one go about manually restarting audio in Ubuntu 10.04?
2010-09-30T07:21:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	perhaps.. sudo service pulseaudio restart ..
2010-09-30T07:22:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	then "sudo killall pulseaudio" .. it should restart by itself if not then "pulseaudio &"
2010-09-30T07:23:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	No dice.  pulseaudio doesn't restart sound.
2010-09-30T07:23:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	did it ever work?
2010-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	Yes.
2010-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	when did it stop...? after installing something?
2010-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	Nope.  Didn't do a thing.  I only noticed it died when I sent an IM and no sound came up.
2010-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	weird.. catastrophic sound card failure perhaps.. try aplay <music file> in terminal and see if it works with that
2010-09-30T07:26:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	aplay is running but there's no sound.
2010-09-30T07:27:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	I know this sounds silly but have you checked the jack going to the speaker? I've got a dog that likes to lay under my desk when I'm sitting there.. 70lbs on wires does things :)
2010-09-30T07:27:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	It's a laptop.
2010-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	that would preclude a pet pest... accidently hit the mute key?
2010-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	It changes color when you touch it.  So... no.
2010-09-30T07:30:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	click the speaker icon up by the clock and check out the preferences.. gotta cover all the bases.
2010-09-30T07:30:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	I just tried cat trial.wav > /dev/dsp and there's no audio.
2010-09-30T07:31:00.000Z	Izinucs	IConrad01	I'm stuck .. someone else will have to pick this up.
2010-09-30T07:32:00.000Z	IConrad01	Izinucs	Yeah.  I was afraid of that... <_<
