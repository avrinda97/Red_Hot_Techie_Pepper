2007-05-11T10:27:00.000Z	Grirahan		That's ok
2007-05-11T10:27:00.000Z	Grirahan		Does anyone here know anything about wireless with Ubuntu?
2007-05-11T10:28:00.000Z	Grirahan		I'm looking to connect to the wireless network here at my house, and it doesn't see the network in the list.
2007-05-11T10:28:00.000Z	Grirahan		yes
2007-05-11T10:28:00.000Z	Grirahan		eth1
2007-05-11T10:29:00.000Z	Grirahan		no scan results
2007-05-11T10:30:00.000Z	Grirahan		yes
2007-05-11T10:31:00.000Z	Grirahan		Not that I know of. It's a Linksys Wireless-G Router.
2007-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	Grirahan		yes, I know the ID, and there's no security on it.
2007-05-11T10:33:00.000Z	Grirahan		yes, it does
2007-05-11T10:34:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	alright, so, try, in a terminal, 'sudo iwconfig eth1 essid NETWORKID ; sudo dhclient eth1'
2007-05-11T10:28:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	do you not what the name of your interface is?  ath0 or wlan0 or eth0 or eth1...?
2007-05-11T10:29:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	from a terminal, try 'iwlist eth1 scan' and see if it's listed in the results
2007-05-11T10:31:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	Anything unique about the router?  For instance, some routers let you set them up to not broadcast beacons for security... that can stop them from being automatically found...
2007-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	do you know the SSID?  and does the router have any security turned on?
2007-05-11T10:33:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	and are you sure that your card supports 802.11G?  ;)  (that is, does it work in windows, hehe?)
2007-05-11T10:36:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	got something?
2007-05-11T10:38:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	no idea how to make gnome do that automatically, though.  i'm not exactly a gnome person, ;), so at present, you'd need to type that command each time you logged in.
2007-05-11T10:39:00.000Z	godlygeek	Grirahan	i'd recommend checking out the router's settings and see if it has an option called 'don't broadcast essid' or 'don't send beacons' or something like that turned on.
