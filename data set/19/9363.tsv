2006-11-18T15:05:00.000Z	Esteth		hey all, i've just managed to get ubuntu running alongside XP home on my machine, and it seems to be working flawlessly apart from one thing: the wireless internet
2006-11-18T15:06:00.000Z	Esteth		im using an RALinnk 2500 card, connecting to a linksys WRT54GS router connected to a cable modem. ubuntu sees the card and lets me connect to the network, but the internet over wireless doesnt work, any ideas?
2006-11-18T15:06:00.000Z	starchaser	Esteth	->  whats the make of your card?
2006-11-18T15:06:00.000Z	starchaser		oops...  sorry scrap my question.
2006-11-18T15:07:00.000Z	Esteth		firefox, but synaptic etc... dont work either
2006-11-18T15:07:00.000Z	starchaser	Esteth	->  you getting a connection - should be a green blob thingie on the top right?
2006-11-18T15:08:00.000Z	Esteth		i dont recall so. i can "activate" the card is what i meant then, i suppose
2006-11-18T15:08:00.000Z	starchaser	Esteth	->  sounds like a WEP problem.   disable the WEP on your router and then try it.
2006-11-18T15:09:00.000Z	Esteth	starchaser	ok, ill try it
2006-11-18T15:09:00.000Z	starchaser		esteth ->  or you can enter your WEP key.
2006-11-18T15:10:00.000Z	Esteth	starchaser	i have entered my wep key, it wouldnt even activate before i entered it, at least from the liveCD
2006-11-18T15:10:00.000Z	starchaser		esteth -> ah.   you need to first DEACTIVATE ...  then enter the wep and then ACTIVATE...
2006-11-18T15:11:00.000Z	starchaser		esteth -> i've come across that before. think its a bit of a bug.
2006-11-18T15:11:00.000Z	Esteth		so i make sure that the card is deactivated, then enter the wep key, then activate, and it should work?
2006-11-18T15:11:00.000Z	starchaser		yeah
2006-11-18T15:12:00.000Z	starchaser		came across it on  a blog somewhere.  might work for you.
2006-11-18T15:12:00.000Z	Esteth		weird. i should probably mention im running dapper drake, not eft atm
2006-11-18T15:12:00.000Z	starchaser		i'm on dapper as well.
2006-11-18T15:12:00.000Z	Esteth	starchaser	ok. im going to reboot into ubuntu now, and try that
