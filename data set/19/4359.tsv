2009-01-30T20:40:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	yea
2009-01-30T20:41:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	you need to make sure it is bootable if using usb in the bios
2009-01-30T20:41:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	is it a usb hard drive ?
2009-01-30T20:43:00.000Z	BenSmith	crocd	It is a usb hard drive.  But has the capability to be firewire if that makes a difference
2009-01-30T20:44:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	easiest to make sure your system can select usb as a bootable source in the BIOS. Then do the install on that drive
2009-01-30T20:45:00.000Z	BenSmith	crocd	Thanks.  The harddrive used to be used as a backup for mac.  Does this make a difference
2009-01-30T20:46:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	not really, if it is a unix type partition should be ok, if it is fat32 then you should be able to see it. When you run the installation you should be able to install it on the USB drive if it is detected in the partition section of the install
2009-01-30T20:47:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	are you running windows on it at the moment? What box is it?
2009-01-30T20:48:00.000Z	BenSmith	crocd	I'm running Vista x64, on an ASUS P5Q PRO.
2009-01-30T20:51:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	should be easy if you change your bios to be able to boot from a USB device then run the Live cd and install it on the USB drive. What should happen is that grub is installed on the internal hard drive of the pc. Or you can go to www.pendrivelinux.com and grab a USB boot iso to creat the full install on that. That way you wont touch the internal drive with any changes

2009-01-30T20:51:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	there are all the isntructions.
2009-01-30T20:53:00.000Z	BenSmith	crocd	 I currently have ubuntu server on a bootable flash drive.  I created this using the System>Administration>Create USB boot drive.
2009-01-30T20:57:00.000Z	BenSmith	crocd	Will that work?
2009-01-30T20:59:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	what the ubuntu server on a usb flashdrive. Yes. I have a Mandriva version installed on a 2gb flash drive. Works like a dream
2009-01-30T21:00:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	if you want to do a install on the usb drive use that website for instructions.
2009-01-30T21:02:00.000Z	BenSmith	crocd	Makes sense.  Thanks.
2009-01-30T21:03:00.000Z	crocd	BenSmith	np
