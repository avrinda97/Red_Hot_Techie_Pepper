2007-12-08T12:45:00.000Z	Kostya		well, my question is regarding Naurilus: is it possible to have a fon size bigger with small icons?
2007-12-08T12:45:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: you could create a theme for that... i guess
2007-12-08T12:57:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: afaik if you change it trough fonts in preferences you'll be changing the global settings... and as for the icongs... personally i would try to find a good themes that would suit my needs ...
2007-12-08T13:12:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: lives...
2007-12-08T13:12:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: i'm not so sure
2007-12-08T13:12:00.000Z	Kostya	zanpakatou	lives? is it QT based?
2007-12-08T13:13:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: you want Qt based?
2007-12-08T13:14:00.000Z	Kostya	zanpakatou	nope. I'd prefer GTK/gnome apps, as I'm using ubuntu...
2007-12-08T13:16:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: hm... im not so sure if it's Qt though but i've read the features... i found subtitle there
2007-12-08T13:17:00.000Z	Kostya	zanpakatou	yep. it looks promising. will give it a try. remember a year ago when I was trying to switch to ubuntu, lives was like a "set of bugs" :)
2007-12-08T13:17:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: check the features on this website http://lives.sourceforge.net/ and see if the tool you need is in there...
2007-12-08T13:18:00.000Z	zanpakatou	Kostya	: set of bugs .. hmmm maybe back then it's unstable... hmmm i was also lookin' for great movie editor for linux though...
2007-12-08T13:20:00.000Z	Kostya	zanpakatou	movie editing was the showstopper for me to move to ubuntu from windows...
