2007-08-16T09:13:00.000Z	GuHhH		how do i install and configure ipw3945d?
2007-08-16T09:14:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	I don't think it needs any configuring - just install it with synaptic
2007-08-16T09:15:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	it doesn't work particularly well, at least not for me, but it's OK if you don't mind the constant disconnections
2007-08-16T09:15:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	i will need the ieee80211
2007-08-16T09:15:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	im using it right now
2007-08-16T09:15:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	but i want to help a friend to make it run
2007-08-16T09:18:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	on every file?  or just at random?
2007-08-16T09:19:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	every
2007-08-16T09:23:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	now i cant umount it, it says "device is busy"
2007-08-16T09:32:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	to umount it, you need to not have any shells cd'ed to that device
2007-08-16T09:32:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	and to be able to read the files, mount it with a umask that lets you read it
2007-08-16T09:33:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	thanks, i guess its protected :(
2007-08-16T09:33:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	it's probably FAT format, which doesn't have the concept of 'protected'
2007-08-16T09:34:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	it's probably just mounted wrongly, so only root can read it
2007-08-16T09:35:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	but i couldnt even copy it on my windows...
2007-08-16T09:36:00.000Z	GuHhH	dooglus	it said thats its protected or something
2007-08-16T09:36:00.000Z	dooglus	GuHhH	oh, ok
