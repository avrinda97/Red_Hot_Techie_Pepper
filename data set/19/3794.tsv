2010-05-02T12:06:00.000Z	solofight		does anybody have some time to sort this installation issue of mine ?
2010-05-02T12:06:00.000Z	solofight		in desperte need of installin a linux distro now in my windows
2010-05-02T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 'in' windows? You could  use virtualbox and  have linux in a virtual machine. I find that easier to do then messing with wubi.
2010-05-02T12:08:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	virtual box will make my pc lie down and sleep
2010-05-02T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 depends on your specs..  im not even sure what your actual propblem is. but i dont use wubi. so cant help with it.
2010-05-02T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 linux can read/write the ntfs filesystems..
2010-05-02T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 windows - will have a harder time reading.writeing to the linux filesystem.
2010-05-02T12:10:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	mine is fat32
2010-05-02T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	fat32/ntfs - both work in linux
2010-05-02T12:11:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	so what do you suggest me  ? how do i make my windows read and write in linux ?
2010-05-02T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 depends on the windows version.. and ive found that its best to keep the shared data on a  vfat/ntfs drive. NOT letting windows access the linux fileysstems
2010-05-02T12:11:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	because i want to make this inter operability
2010-05-02T12:13:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	in that case i will havea shared drive where my files which can be operated from both os will be stored, and if i want to copy a file from any other folder to the shared i need to switch to the appropriate os and copy
2010-05-02T12:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 windows  is the problem. there is a ext2 driver for it. and ext3 driver. but no ext4 yet. so if you used ext3 windows intheory can access the linux stuff
2010-05-02T12:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 ive had windows Totally TRASH an ext3 partition befor.
2010-05-02T12:15:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	omg, i cannot do a r and d on it now, totally valuable data
2010-05-02T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 data that has value is data worth having a backup of.
2010-05-02T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	solofight	 ive had windows mess up my linux ext2/3 filesystem befor. So Be carefull with that fs-driver.org tool.
2010-05-02T12:17:00.000Z	solofight	Dr_Willis	so il take a backup, and will install linus inside a seperate partition
