2010-05-07T01:23:00.000Z	Tristan		I was here a little while ago. Basically, my computer is reading my Ubuntu partition as a windows partition and can't find the "windows startup file." I installed it via Wubi from my windows 7 desktop. I've also tried installing from the LiveCD with the same result.
2010-05-07T01:24:00.000Z	Tristan		I'm new to this. Define grub, please.
2010-05-07T01:25:00.000Z	Tristan		I don't get that. I basically get a message telling me to repair via the windows boot CD.
2010-05-07T01:25:00.000Z	Tristan		The error code is 0xc00000e if it's of interest to you
2010-05-07T01:26:00.000Z	Tristan		I probably can, but you'll have to tell me how to do it.
2010-05-07T01:27:00.000Z	Tristan		Windows 7, Ubuntu 10.04 (I think.) Windows 7 > Ubuntu
2010-05-07T01:27:00.000Z	Tristan		And yes, that's what I'm running IRC from
2010-05-07T01:28:00.000Z	Tristan		Yes
2010-05-07T01:29:00.000Z	Tristan		I take path A, and I get sunshine and licensing trust issues. I take path B and it tells me I should be taking path A.
2010-05-07T01:30:00.000Z	Tristan		Windows repair or startup repair?
2010-05-07T01:30:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	what are you trying to do ?
2010-05-07T01:31:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	install windows 7 first then install ubuntu
2010-05-07T01:31:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	unless you are using wubi
2010-05-07T01:32:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	wubi starts from inside of windows not really dualbooting
2010-05-07T01:32:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	yeah the startup process with wubi is different
2010-05-07T01:34:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	wubi doesn't create a partition
2010-05-07T01:35:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	what are you trying to do exactly?
2010-05-07T01:35:00.000Z	histo	Tristan	what is the problem with wubi?
