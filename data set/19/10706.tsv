2006-05-23T16:58:00.000Z	Tinse		rosen@rosen:~$ ps auwx | grep firefox
2006-05-23T16:58:00.000Z	Tinse		killall -9 firefox
2006-05-23T16:58:00.000Z	Tinse		firefox: no process killed
2006-05-23T05:01:00.000Z	Tinse		nothing seems to work though
2006-05-23T05:01:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	that's because no firefox is not running (you see only 'grep firefox', right?)
2006-05-23T05:02:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	go into your .mozilla/firefox/<profile directory> and remove 'lock' and '.parentlock'
2006-05-23T05:02:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	I dont see anything, I have no idea what is going on
2006-05-23T05:02:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	I can't .. then my nautilus crashes .... this is like the most buggy thing I've ever seen tbh
2006-05-23T05:02:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	ok, do it from the terminal
2006-05-23T05:06:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	does it work now?
2006-05-23T05:06:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	seems like it
2006-05-23T05:06:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	but it was working like a charm yesterday aswell.. untill it stopped :P
2006-05-23T05:06:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	if Firefox is running, it works. What more do you want? :)
2006-05-23T05:07:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	I want it to stop crashing and stop doing wierd stuff that makes no sense :)
2006-05-23T05:07:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	yeah, Fx crashes sometimes. Bad extensions, usually.
2006-05-23T05:08:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	hehe maybe I should update to dapper though ... is that stable?
2006-05-23T05:08:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	Dapper is stable enough at the moment (from what I've heard). But I think the problem is probably with Firefox itself :(
2006-05-23T05:09:00.000Z	Tinse	hastesaver	yeah but my entire system crashes aswell + nautilus is acting really wierd
2006-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	hastesaver	Tinse	oh, then something is wrong... do a clean installation of Dapper if you can :)
