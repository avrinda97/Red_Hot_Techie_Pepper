2007-03-05T15:18:00.000Z	moonwatcher		followed this: http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
2007-03-05T15:18:00.000Z	moonwatcher		and now i want to "undo" that
2007-03-05T15:18:00.000Z	moonwatcher		i cant seem to get proper routing with a normal lan connection
2007-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	moonwatcher		skype for linux gets a connection but nothing else works
2007-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	moonwatcher		i think its this line: sudo ln -sf ppp/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
2007-03-05T15:20:00.000Z	moonwatcher		wow, this place is busy
2007-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	moonwatcher		oh come on people: sudo ln -sf ppp/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
2007-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	moonwatcher		what des this mean?
2007-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	moonwatcher		i can see it fucks up my routing but i am not sure how to undo that
2007-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	moonwatcher		-sf doesnt show up on the man
2007-03-05T15:24:00.000Z	gaten	moonwatcher	 thats a combination of 2 switches, s and f
2007-03-05T15:26:00.000Z	gaten	moonwatcher	 donno. all that does is create a link between those 2 files. where do you see that line
2007-03-05T15:26:00.000Z	moonwatcher	gaten	http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
2007-03-05T15:28:00.000Z	gaten	moonwatcher	 you could delete the symbolic link. that wont effect the origonal file
2007-03-05T15:29:00.000Z	moonwatcher	gaten	what would be the command for that?
2007-03-05T15:32:00.000Z	gaten	moonwatcher	 the comand "ln -sf ...." just creates a link between those 2 files, kinda sorta like copying the first on the the second one
2007-03-05T15:32:00.000Z	moonwatcher	gaten	i figured i dont want to delete /etc/resolv.conf, but ppp/resolve.conf is "overriting" it now i suppose
2007-03-05T15:38:00.000Z	moonwatcher	gaten	ok so what i have is a dns problem, how do i remove that thing so it goes back to using the lan?
2007-03-05T15:39:00.000Z	gaten	moonwatcher	 remove the resolv.conf and create an empty file in its place
