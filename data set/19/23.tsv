2005-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	cg0def		how would you compare/contrast gentoo to ubuntu
2005-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	cg0def		I am thinking of withcing from gentoo but I am not yet sure
2005-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	cg0def		I know that
2005-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	cg0def		gentoo is source based
2005-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	cg0def		I was wondering how up to date ubuntu is
2005-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	it's released every six months
2005-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	so the oldest stuff you're going to get is max six months
2005-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	not in the stable release, no. otherwise it wouldn't be stable or supportable.
2005-01-24T12:47:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	our development branches are always changing.
2005-01-24T12:47:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	it will go in the development branch immediately (we actually track gnome development branch)
2005-01-24T12:47:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	it will not go into a stable release (otherwise it wouldn't be stable, etc. etc.)
2005-01-24T12:47:00.000Z	cg0def	jdub	the gnome traching is exactly what I like in ubuntu
2005-02-14T11:20:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	archive.ubuntu.com
2005-02-14T11:20:00.000Z	cg0def	jdub	thanks
2005-03-09T13:59:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	you shouldn't
2005-03-09T14:00:00.000Z	cg0def	jdub	why not?
2005-03-09T14:00:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	er, it doesn't at all
2005-03-09T14:01:00.000Z	jdub	cg0def	those issues have been fixed
2005-03-09T14:02:00.000Z	cg0def	jdub	I have 0.23 installed and there isn't anything newer in apt
