2008-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	Jangari		sudo apt-get install brasero
2008-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	Jangari		also serpentine, luis_, that's what i use, i think
2008-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	Jangari		but that's for audio cds specifically
2008-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	Jangari		yes, luis_, but check first whether you have it by looking in applications > sound and video, or by entering "which serpentine" in a terminal
2008-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	Jangari		if "which serpentine" returns something like /usr/bin/serpentine then you have it already
2008-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	Jangari		failing that, you can easily search the repository for the actual name of the package by entering apt-cache search brasero, or apt-cache search serpentine
2008-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	Jangari		a handy way of checking whether you have a program installed
2008-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	Jangari		brasero is better for either/or audio/data, etc.
2008-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	Jangari		okay, so flash is fixed? when did this happen?
2008-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	Jangari		pays to remember that http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash is a failsafe way to install flash
2008-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	ka2	Jangari	almost not for 32 firefox on AMD64 - you have to edit the installer script :)
2008-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	ka2	Jangari	if all of them are unmounted unlplug it and plug it back in

2008-02-25T09:26:00.000Z	ka2	Jangari	 > greater than = same as != not the same as
2008-02-25T09:27:00.000Z	ka2	Jangari	 yes
2008-02-25T09:29:00.000Z	ka2	Jangari	sounds right sorry about the offtopicness
