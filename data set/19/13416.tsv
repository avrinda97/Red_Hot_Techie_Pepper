2005-04-05T05:46:00.000Z	hkais		does anyone could give me a link to a page, there i can figure out:
2005-04-05T05:46:00.000Z	hkais		 - how long security fixes are available for each release
2005-04-05T05:46:00.000Z	hkais		 - how I can upgrade similar to debian to a newer release
2005-04-05T05:47:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	probably on the support page, 18 months for each release, you upgrade just as yo uwould on Debian
2005-04-05T05:47:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	ie, with apt/synaptic/aptitude, and only after reading the upgrade notes
2005-04-05T05:48:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	if you're interested in further paid support, I'm sure someone at canonical would love to talk to you
2005-04-05T05:49:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	the company sponsoring ubuntu
2005-04-05T05:52:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	you can email info@canonical.com if you want to talk to someone about support
2005-04-05T05:54:00.000Z	hkais	bob2	yes but I must figure out how expensive a longer support is
2005-04-05T05:55:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	email and ask :-)
2005-04-05T06:02:00.000Z	hkais	bob2	do you know if it is possible to upgrade from one release to an other, easily?
2005-04-05T06:02:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	sure
2005-04-05T06:02:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	should work at least as well as Debian does
2005-11-05T17:23:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	most people try to avoid it
2005-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	hkais	bob2	why?
2005-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	because people have long memories and it used to do terrible things to config files
2005-11-05T17:27:00.000Z	hkais	bob2	hmm what is interessting. I had never an problem with webmin. could you tell me more?
2005-11-05T17:27:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	no
2005-11-05T17:27:00.000Z	bob2	hkais	it used to suck. I have no idea if it does or doesn't anymore, but using a web interface to edit config files is always going to be flakey.
