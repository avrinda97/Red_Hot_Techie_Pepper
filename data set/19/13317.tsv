2005-05-13T06:48:00.000Z	andrea		ok
2005-05-13T06:49:00.000Z	andrea		i've modified the /etc/fstab file in order to remount a partition at boot time
2005-05-13T06:49:00.000Z	andrea		adding this line: /dev/hda1 /media/winxp/ ntfs umask=0777 0 0
2005-05-13T06:49:00.000Z	andrea		but when i execute mount -a
2005-05-13T06:49:00.000Z	andrea		and i try to watch the permission of the winxp directory
2005-05-13T06:50:00.000Z	andrea		permissions are different
2005-05-13T06:50:00.000Z	reed	andrea	try to write on one line: it is better for comprehension :)
2005-05-13T06:53:00.000Z	reed	andrea	show a line of output ls -la /media/xp
2005-05-13T06:54:00.000Z	andrea	reed	i can't show you the output.. it's too big
2005-05-13T06:54:00.000Z	reed	andrea	http://pastebin.org
2005-05-13T06:55:00.000Z	reed	andrea	what are the permssions then? summarize what you see
2005-05-13T06:56:00.000Z	reed	andrea	man umask
2005-05-13T06:56:00.000Z	reed	andrea	I guessed right that you don't know what umask is
2005-05-13T06:58:00.000Z	reed	andrea	there is no such thing as a folder! it is a directory
2005-05-13T06:59:00.000Z	reed	andrea	nope, umask is a different thing.  Study Unix, it is helpful
