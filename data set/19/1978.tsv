2010-08-13T04:39:00.000Z	lov255		Okay I am beyond frustrated now I still have no internet connection at all and now Network manager is gone
2010-08-13T04:39:00.000Z	lov255		please elp
2010-08-13T04:39:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	what's happening exactly?
2010-08-13T04:40:00.000Z	lov255	TrentonAdams	There is no NetworkManager icon - I can not access the internet with Ubuntu 10.04, it worked perfect last night
2010-08-13T04:40:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	Have you rebooted?
2010-08-13T04:41:00.000Z	lov255	TrentonAdams	I did a bit of reading and add the ath0 line to some file I forgot....yes I have rebooted a ton of times
2010-08-13T04:43:00.000Z	lov255		Any suggestions?
2010-08-13T04:43:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	I'm new to ubuntu myself, so I'm trying to find out how the network manager starts itself.
2010-08-13T04:44:00.000Z	lov255		and how do you enable it?
2010-08-13T04:44:00.000Z	lov255		oer: yes that is what I edited
2010-08-13T04:44:00.000Z	lov255		oer: it only had an lo line
2010-08-13T04:45:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	mine only has lo, and iface lo inet loopback
2010-08-13T04:45:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	And my stuff works perfectly.
2010-08-13T04:45:00.000Z	lov255		Hhhhmmm
2010-08-13T04:46:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	Yeah, I guess I'm not much help.  I don't know the internals of ubuntu yet.
2010-08-13T04:46:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	I'm used to gentoo linux
2010-08-13T04:47:00.000Z	lov255		thanks TrentonAdams
2010-08-13T04:47:00.000Z	lov255		anyone else can help?
2010-08-13T04:47:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lov255	What does "service network-manager status" from a command line shell tell you?
