2012-03-01T03:25:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A		shouldn't this bug be urgent, considering that it makes it impossible to install current ubuntu to acer notebooks? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/740893
2012-03-01T03:27:00.000Z	urfr332gO	PrototypeX29A	you want top be specific with the hardware I have a acer and everything runs fine.
2012-03-01T03:28:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	it affects acer aspire 5732Z and at least some other models from that series
2012-03-01T03:28:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	ich think all affected notebooks have the same graphics controller
2012-03-01T03:29:00.000Z	urfr332gO	PrototypeX29A	whic is?

2012-03-01T03:31:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	do you know how to push that bug a little bit? usually people get back on my bug reports after 2 years, i don't feel like waiting that much for this one
2012-03-01T03:34:00.000Z	urfr332gO	PrototypeX29A	seems from a quick read to be a specific kernel, have you tried 11.10?
2012-03-01T03:35:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	i am using 11.10
2012-03-01T03:35:00.000Z	urfr332gO	PrototypeX29A	same acer and it is working?
2012-03-01T03:36:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	same acer, but it is only working because i applied the workaround given on launchpad
2012-03-01T03:36:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	but it is not fun
2012-03-01T03:36:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	basically it is broken right now
2012-03-01T03:38:00.000Z	urfr332gO	PrototypeX29A	life is not fun welcome to the real world, I had a laptop with a old radeon some releases worked some didn't. Personally I jsu found a distro that did and just moved on.
2012-03-01T03:39:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	i don't feel like installing fedora as a workaround
2012-03-01T03:39:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	but considering that the bug is now known for month and still an issue, i'm afraid i will have too change something :/
2012-03-01T03:40:00.000Z	urfr332gO	PrototypeX29A	seems like it, fedora is hardly different then ubuntu anyway in a bigger scehma, I run both.
2012-03-01T03:42:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	urfr332gO	maybe it is just a kernel issue which has been fixed aeons ago upstream :)
