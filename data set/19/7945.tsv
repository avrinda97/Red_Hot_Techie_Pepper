2009-01-21T03:35:00.000Z	Lycus		How can I run a HDD recovery tool from the Ubuntu LiveCD?
2009-01-21T03:36:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	just like you would run it from an installed system
2009-01-21T03:36:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	ActionParsnip: Can I not do it from the regular LiveCD?
2009-01-21T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	depends on what kind of recovery you want to do.. but usually you can recover stuff from the regular live cd
2009-01-21T03:38:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	I want to check my HDD for errors etc.
2009-01-21T03:38:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	Ubuntu will only boot into BusyBox, so I suspect it's a HDD error.
2009-01-21T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	sure.. fsck will work from a live cd
2009-01-21T03:40:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	How do I use fsck?
2009-01-21T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	I'm going to teach you something else.. how to use a man page
2009-01-21T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	almost all commands in linux comes with a manual describing how to use them.. you can access this by writing "man <commandname>" in a terminal.. so to get information on fsck you would write "man fsck"
2009-01-21T03:43:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	The LiveCD didn't mount my computer's HDD.
2009-01-21T03:43:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	it doesn't show up in nautilus ?
2009-01-21T03:45:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	Unable to mount, DBus error, etc.
2009-01-21T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	huh? never seen that before.. but you don't have to mount it to check it.. in fact you shouldn't mount it
2009-01-21T03:47:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	Would it be fsck /dev/hda1/ ?
2009-01-21T03:47:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	just find out what the drive is called... /dev/sda3 , /dev/sdc2  or something like that.. you can use gnome partition editor to look at drives
2009-01-21T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	ubuntu doesn't use the /dev/hdXn notation anymore.. all drives use the scsi interface so it's /dev/sdXn instead
2009-01-21T04:03:00.000Z	Lycus	Slart	I get a short read drive error, http://pastebin.com/m2d2eaafe
2009-01-21T04:04:00.000Z	Slart	Lycus	see if there is an option to check for bad blocks.. use that
