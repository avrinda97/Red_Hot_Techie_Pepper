2007-06-30T15:50:00.000Z	leagris		Anyone here have some experience in using DVD-RAM within Ubuntu?
2007-06-30T15:52:00.000Z	leagris		!dvd-ram
2007-06-30T15:52:00.000Z	leagris		!pktcdvd
2007-06-30T15:52:00.000Z	leagris		!udftools
2007-06-30T15:54:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	he's talking about a CD / DVD drive
2007-07-31T13:35:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	the problem is the space and the parenthesis inside the share name
2007-07-31T13:36:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	proper quoting should solve this
2007-07-31T13:36:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	can't quote anything inside fstab
2007-07-31T13:37:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	so use escapes...
2007-07-31T13:37:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	or use fusesmb, which is easier anyway
2007-07-31T13:37:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	does not seem to work either with //servername//SHARENAME\ \(D\) /mountpount ...
2007-07-31T13:39:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	i'm no syntax expert, but might be something like \&20 fo a space
2007-07-31T13:40:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	k will try this, do you now the code for ( and ) ?
2007-07-31T13:41:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	why not just using legal filenames ? :-)
2007-07-31T13:41:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	because Windows insisting in adding a space and drive letter between parenthesis whan sharing a whole disk
2007-07-31T13:43:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	I can use that share with Gnome VFS but it has several caveat, twice slowre, does not map special letters accent correctly and is not permanent
2007-07-31T13:43:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	look at fusesmb
2007-07-31T13:44:00.000Z	leagris	stefg	will look at it but the space and parenthesis may still be a problem inside fstab, I home not
2007-07-31T13:44:00.000Z	stefg	leagris	fusesmb doesn't need a fstab entry :-) (userspace)
