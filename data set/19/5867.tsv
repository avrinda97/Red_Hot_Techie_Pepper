2008-08-08T16:10:00.000Z	wolfeySI		can anyone recommend some free software with articles and forum?
2008-08-08T16:10:00.000Z	wolfeySI		like vbulletin
2008-08-08T16:11:00.000Z	Saladin	wolfeySI	So, like a forum and wiki in one?
2008-08-08T16:11:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	something like howtoforge
2008-08-08T16:11:00.000Z	Saladin	wolfeySI	I looked at that, and it seems to be a custom site, I reckon
2008-08-08T16:12:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	nope
2008-08-08T16:12:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	it is vbulletin, themed.
2008-08-08T16:13:00.000Z	Saladin	wolfeySI	Their forum is vBulletin. Which seems to be inside an i-frame on their site
2008-08-08T16:14:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	hmm
2008-08-08T16:14:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	well phpBB would be ok as forum
2008-08-08T16:14:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	but i need something for articles
2008-08-08T16:15:00.000Z	Saladin	wolfeySI	Definitely phpBB for your forum - it rules. And you could try something like wordpress for articles.
2008-08-08T16:15:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	but i dont want blog
2008-08-08T16:15:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	i want something to write FAQ's
2008-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	i could go code php myself, but i'm looking if there's something tested
2008-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	Saladin	wolfeySI	You want a wiki system then.
2008-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	i want it more linear than wiki
2008-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Saladin	like tutorials on howtoforge
2008-08-08T16:17:00.000Z	Saladin	wolfeySI	My suggestion would be to write it yourself then. I honestly don't know any systems out there like that. And I write all my own stuff on websites. Apart from forums (Sod that), for which I use phpBB
