2007-01-27T15:10:00.000Z	Tatster		I get it everytime I try and boot from the Ubuntu CD
2007-01-27T15:12:00.000Z	Tatster		When the CD loads, I get the menu options for Start or install, Start in safe graphics mode, Check CD, Memory Test
2007-01-27T15:12:00.000Z	Tatster		If I select Start
2007-01-27T15:12:00.000Z	Tatster		the option is start or install
2007-01-27T15:13:00.000Z	Tatster		If I do that I get a box saying loading kernel, and then I get the logo with the sliding progress bar for a while
2007-01-27T15:14:00.000Z	Tatster		Then after a while I get the error /bin/sh: can't access tty
