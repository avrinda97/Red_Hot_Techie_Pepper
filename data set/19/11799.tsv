2007-03-07T07:03:00.000Z	blanky		hidden files and folders and all
2007-03-07T07:03:00.000Z	blanky		anyone
2007-03-07T07:04:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	use mv
2007-03-07T07:04:00.000Z	blanky	soundray	okay, but does it need a special flag or something
2007-03-07T07:04:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	no
2007-03-07T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	if you're moving gigabytes between filesystems, it can take some time. If you're moving within a filesystem, it should happen immediately
2007-03-07T07:09:00.000Z	blanky	soundray	can I use cp to the same effect
2007-03-07T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	no, cp will copy. Read ubotu's private message:
2007-03-07T07:09:00.000Z	blanky	soundray	I need to copy not move, but I want the hidden stuff as well
2007-03-07T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	cp -a would
2007-03-07T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	use cp -av for progress feedback
2007-03-24T10:42:00.000Z	blanky	soundray	you're always the one to complain about that huh haha
2007-03-24T10:43:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	are you coming here for help? If so, please check your attitude.
2007-03-24T10:43:00.000Z	blanky	soundray	nope I was't asking for help :)
2007-03-24T10:43:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	then you're offtopic. Sound off in #ubuntu-offtopic.
2007-03-24T10:46:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	my concern is that some people want to use this channel in some professional capacity. Bad language on a channel can be a major obstacle.
2007-03-24T10:46:00.000Z	blanky	soundray	It's okay, you can be quiet now because I shut up a while ago, I don't consider 'piss' a bad word, but I won't say it anymore in here if it offends you
2007-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	soundray	blanky	it doesn't offend me. It goes against the purpose of the channel.
