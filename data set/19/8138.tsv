2009-09-21T14:03:00.000Z	Gnea	System-7	if you don't have the data to back your claim up, it would be wise not to make the claim in the first place.
2009-09-21T14:05:00.000Z	Gnea	System-7	negatory, a webpage is required, otherwise it is word-of-mouth, which is opinion, not fact.
2009-09-21T14:06:00.000Z	Gnea	System-7	if you don't have a real reference, just admit it and move on.
