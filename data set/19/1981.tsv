2010-09-23T01:36:00.000Z	TELL0		hello. how can I install gnome with a ubuntu minimal cd?
2010-09-23T01:37:00.000Z	TELL0		with this line? >>> sudo aptitude install x-window-system-core gnome-core gdm
2010-09-23T01:37:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	sudo aptitude install gnome
2010-09-23T01:37:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	Yeah, that line looks good.
2010-09-23T01:37:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	You may be missing some video or input drives though
2010-09-23T01:39:00.000Z	TELL0	undecim	I wanna a clean install of ubuntu, WO any default application, just my desktop to start over and install whatever  I want
2010-09-23T01:39:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	Well, let me see... there was a less-than obvious package I found to install a minimal gnome...
2010-09-23T01:41:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	gnome-core includes a few default apps: GEdit, Eye of Gnome, terminal...
2010-09-23T01:43:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	If you want to be REALLY minimal, just install gnome-session, metacity, gnome-panel, your xserver and drivers, and whatever apps you need
2010-09-23T01:49:00.000Z	TELL0	undecim	that ubuntu minimal install is compatible with ubuntu repos right?
2010-09-23T01:50:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	100%
2010-09-23T01:50:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	It's the same thing as ubuntu-desktop, but without the extra packages
2010-09-23T01:52:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	That's the main benefit to the minimal install. Less bloat
2010-09-23T01:52:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	It's a little more work though... Helps to know the command line when using the minimal install
2010-09-23T01:53:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	If you want a REALLY light desktop, you should look at installing fluxbox.
2010-09-23T01:54:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	It's lots of work to setup, but ultra-customizable and ultra-lightweight
2010-09-23T01:55:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	I've set up machines that run a good-looking desktop on 100 MB ram usage (including buffers/cache)
2010-09-23T01:56:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	Well, you can use nautilus in fluxbox.
2010-09-23T01:57:00.000Z	undecim	TELL0	In-fact, fluxbox doesn't have itself a file manager (which means no desktop icons unless you use nautilus, pcmanfm, or another file manager)
