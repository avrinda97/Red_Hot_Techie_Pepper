2008-05-10T01:14:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	why do you want to chroot someone to their home dir ?
2008-05-10T01:15:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	what is your end goal
2008-05-10T01:16:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	i want to set up a webserver and people should be able to access and upload their files into their home directory
2008-05-10T01:16:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	just change the permissions on /home
2008-05-10T01:16:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	or use restricted shell
2008-05-10T01:16:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	but i read that rsh has lot of drawbacks
2008-05-10T01:16:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	I didn't say rsh
2008-05-10T01:16:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	thats remote shell
2008-05-10T01:17:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	sorry i did mean restricted shell
2008-05-10T01:17:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	there are drawbacks to chrooting too
2008-05-10T01:17:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	everything has pro's and con's
2008-05-10T01:17:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	i read in some pages a code that will allow access and hence the user can break
2008-05-10T01:18:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	I can write a webpage that says "I can break chroot like this"
2008-05-10T01:18:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	hehehe. i read it in two pages < i am not arguing>
2008-05-10T01:18:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	had you used it earlier successfully
2008-05-10T01:18:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	you see the point I'm getting at, it's as secure as you make it, a badly setup chroot is easy to get through
2008-05-10T01:19:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	you mean if i set it up properly using rsh, it should be unbreakable?
2008-05-10T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	shree_	I think it reduces the risks, very few things are "unbreakable"
2008-05-10T01:21:00.000Z	shree_	ikonia	ok. let me see into the rsh stuff too. might be there is a solution to that problem
