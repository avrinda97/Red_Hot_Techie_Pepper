2012-10-17T03:17:00.000Z	vulcanmum		I am new to ubuntu and brand new to xchat
2012-10-17T03:19:00.000Z	vulcanmum		I was directed here from reddit, someone said this was a good room for ubuntu help
2012-10-17T03:20:00.000Z	vulcanmum		thanks
2012-10-17T03:21:00.000Z	vulcanmum		I don't even know how to use xchat yet, I tried adding my server that I use for another chat room I go to but it didn't open
2012-10-17T03:22:00.000Z	vulcanmum		how do you address someone specifically in here, in chat, without having to type thier whole name?
2012-10-17T03:22:00.000Z	vulcanmum		ok thanks Rallias
2012-10-17T03:23:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	In XChat use the top menu: XChat -> New -> Server Tab
2012-10-17T03:23:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	That will open a new server tab. Then in that new server tab, just type /server address.of.server
2012-10-17T03:24:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	Or, in that new tab, click XChat -> Network List.. and use that.
2012-10-17T03:27:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	Woot, I remember dial-up!
2012-10-17T03:34:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	Well, after apt-get runs unless there was a problem it will just exit and bring you back to your terminal (The dollar sign $)
2012-10-17T03:38:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	You can test it by simply playing an MP3, I think (ubuntu-restricted-extras provides mp3 codecs, among others right?)
2012-10-17T03:44:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	I dont' use Clementine but you probably just have to open it's settings and point it to your music on your computer, like the directory it's in.
2012-10-17T03:44:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	By default it probably just isn't looking in the particular directory (Folder) your music is stored on your computer.
2012-10-17T04:43:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	Well, I'm not familiar with Clementine sorry. Where on your hard drive is your music, do you know the path?
2012-10-17T04:44:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	So in Clementine click on Settings (If you're using Ubuntu you'll have to push your mouse to the top of the screen to see the File | Edit | Settings menus) and then in Settings, click on Music Library tab
2012-10-17T04:44:00.000Z	michealPW	vulcanmum	In there, you will point Clementine to the folder on your hard drive your music is in.
2012-10-17T06:50:00.000Z	vulcanmum	michealPW	 I think mathfreak  has it whittled down to it's actually my monitor
