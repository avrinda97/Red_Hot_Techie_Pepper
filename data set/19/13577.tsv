2005-04-29T10:06:00.000Z	thr1ce		does anyone use alsa ?
2005-04-29T10:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 alsa is the standard sound system now a days :P so that would be yes fo rmost of us.
2005-04-29T10:08:00.000Z	thr1ce	dr_willis	or you, how to initially set up alsa to find my sound card ?
2005-04-29T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 it saw mine.. are you sure your volume settings are not just set to zero or muted?
2005-04-29T10:10:00.000Z	thr1ce	dr_willis	yes; when I try to play sound from alsa, it complains that it is not configured properly
2005-04-29T10:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 it can work   - if you are lucky
2005-04-29T10:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 yep. it was very easy under ubuntu.. followed that binary driver howto.. installed the packages and edited one line in the x config.
2005-04-29T10:40:00.000Z	thr1ce	dr_willis	but this wants to write an xfree86-4
2005-04-29T10:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	  the faq is mentionign the xfree version/config - same stuff applies to the x.org file
2005-04-29T10:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 if useing the x.org version of x yes you are.
2005-05-29T06:16:00.000Z	thr1ce	dr_willis	wait until the very last second to pull
2005-05-29T06:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 pull out at the last second?  Oh wait...   wrong channel.. :P
2005-06-13T08:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 seen one of those. :P but no idea if they work.
2005-06-13T09:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	thr1ce	 it was a simple about:config edit I think.. saw it ont heubuntu wiikis
