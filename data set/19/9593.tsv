2006-12-21T09:33:00.000Z	LazyAce		it's a portable drive, I would like to use it for back up and portable storage
2006-12-21T09:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	LazyAce	 easy graphical ways are with Gparted or QTparted :)
2006-12-21T09:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	LazyAce	 i've used gparted to do most all of my various portable USB media :)
2006-12-21T09:38:00.000Z	SilentDis	LazyAce	 it's been ages since I've formatted/partitioned a disk in linux from the command line.  I tend to just use the graphical tools, just easier lol
2006-12-21T09:40:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	What is the "free space preceding / following (MiB)
2006-12-21T09:41:00.000Z	SilentDis	LazyAce	 just that.  the free space before the partition starts, and how much free space there is after the partiton.
2006-12-21T09:41:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	so obviously I can't leave them at "0"
2006-12-21T09:42:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	hmmm, so How do I format, "Resize / move" right?
2006-12-21T09:42:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	cause it isn't letting me format with them set at 0
2006-12-21T09:44:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	Ahhhhh, not it's letting me do what I want me thinks
2006-12-21T09:47:00.000Z	SilentDis	LazyAce	 after you select the disk, just delete everything on it.  right click in the grey bar, choose 'new'.  free space preceeding 0, new size (whole drive, same as max size, free space following 0.  file system FAT32.  add.  :)
2006-12-21T09:49:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	sorry, was off getting cereal haha
2006-12-21T09:49:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	so would that be primary, or extended?
2006-12-21T09:50:00.000Z	LazyAce	SilentDis	Thanks :D   me <3 long time
