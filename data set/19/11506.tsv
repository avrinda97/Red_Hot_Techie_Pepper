2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	Does it print out any error messages?
2006-01-10T06:48:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	none at all
2006-01-10T06:49:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	Ubuntu has several 'virtual' terminals, and it only uses one for a graphical logon.  You can switch between them by hitting alt+F1 - F7.
2006-01-10T06:49:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	so when it boots i can hit alt+f1 ?
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	Next time you reboot, check all of them for a graphical logon.
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	ok alt f1-f7
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	alt+F1, alt+F2, alt+F3......
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	ok thanks.
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	If they're all empty, logon from the command line and type 'startx'
2006-01-10T06:51:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	thats the thing i have no command line
2006-01-10T07:05:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	That sounds like a problem with AbiWord... have you tested it with another app, like OOo?
2006-01-10T07:05:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	yea same problem, or it prints it with the text really light?\
2006-01-10T07:08:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	just printed out another perfect test page?
2006-01-10T07:10:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	Under file:printer settings have you tried messing with the greyscale settings?
2006-01-10T07:10:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	no
2006-01-10T07:10:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	It might help.
2006-01-10T07:10:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PuMpErNiCkLe	in abiword?
2006-01-10T07:11:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanYouHelpMePlz	I was looking at OOo, but AbiWord probably has something similar.
