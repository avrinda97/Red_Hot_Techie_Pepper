2005-11-08T08:05:00.000Z	Kumo		hi guys, I need help with my keyboard please, I upgraded to breeze and my keyboard in gdm doesn't work
2005-11-08T08:06:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	so the whole thing doesn't work or what?
2005-11-08T08:06:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	or is it just a wrong layout?
2005-11-08T08:07:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	I cannot login but the keyboard works outside gdm
2005-11-08T08:08:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	did you ever modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf by hand?
2005-11-08T08:09:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	yes, I checked that but I don't see anything different than my configuration on the live cd
2005-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	anyway, i would do a `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2005-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	you need to do the md5sum stuff mentioned in the header of /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	I have already done it but nothing change
2005-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	did you do:
2005-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	md5sum stuff? I'm gonna see
2005-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	theine	Kumo	if you don't do that, dpkg-reconfigure won't have any affect
2005-11-08T08:12:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	ok I'll try it
2005-11-08T08:13:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	and after that the dpkg-reconfigure stuff?
2005-11-08T08:18:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	I'll see if now is working, I'll be right back
2005-11-08T08:50:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	I did the md5sum stuff but didn't work
2005-11-08T08:55:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	Do you know what else could I try to fix this please?
2005-11-08T09:04:00.000Z	Kumo	theine	could you help me please?
