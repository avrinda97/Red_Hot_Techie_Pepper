2009-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	karatekickz		I need to find where vnc gets loaded
2009-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	What's the exact issue?
2009-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	and?
2009-06-23T10:36:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	How about looking into ~/.vnc/
2009-06-23T10:40:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	did you find a .vnc folder in the remote system?
2009-06-23T10:43:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	try searching for the vncserver -geometry...
2009-06-23T10:43:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	command call, it should be in /etc (probably in rc.local) if you are running it headless as you say.
2009-06-23T10:44:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	do a grep for "vncserver" in /etc
2009-06-23T10:45:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	or if your fs has updatedb then try and do a "locate xstartup"
2009-06-23T10:48:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	any luck yet?
2009-06-23T10:49:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	grep "vncserver" /etc -r
2009-06-23T10:53:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	try searching for vncserver -geometry 640x480
2009-06-23T10:53:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	that should be the command line invocation
2009-06-23T10:59:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	cd /etc
2009-06-23T10:59:00.000Z	mutew	karatekickz	grep "vncserver" . -r
