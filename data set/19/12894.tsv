2011-01-23T01:03:00.000Z	sketcher		hello... exist any method with apt-get to "undo" all installed packages after clean install?
2011-01-23T01:04:00.000Z	sketcher		aja
2011-01-23T01:04:00.000Z	sketcher		something like remove all these packages
2011-01-23T01:04:00.000Z	sketcher		and keep the system as fresh install
2011-01-23T01:06:00.000Z	sketcher		magical it doesn't work... i just want to remove all programs installed after a Fresh Install.. just keep the packages that comes with the system
2011-01-23T01:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sketcher	 never really seen a way to do that either.
2011-01-23T01:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sketcher	 ive heard it may be a featuer some day however.
2011-01-23T01:08:00.000Z	sketcher		ouch
2011-01-23T01:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		theres no real way for the system to 'tell' its back to defaults or not. I could remaster a cd/dvd/version with different defaults...
2011-01-23T01:08:00.000Z	sketcher		:)
2011-01-23T01:09:00.000Z	sketcher		magical thats my qs
2011-01-23T01:10:00.000Z	sketcher		how can i tell to apt-get to remove all dirs/libs installed by a package? apt-get remove.. ?
2011-01-23T01:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sketcher	 its possivle other programs depend on the same libs/packages. so even then it wont remove them all.
2011-01-23T01:11:00.000Z	sketcher		:O
2011-01-23T01:11:00.000Z	sketcher	Dr_Willis	what about for example Apache2.. ?
2011-01-23T01:11:00.000Z	sketcher	Dr_Willis	after apt-get remove apache2 it keeps the /var/www
2011-01-23T01:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sketcher	 theres some orphan tools/features of the package system. but ive rarely needed them
2011-01-23T01:12:00.000Z	sketcher		i see
2011-01-23T01:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sketcher	 thats what the 'purge' optuion is all about.. in most cases you would want to keep anything you have customized like the www dir.
