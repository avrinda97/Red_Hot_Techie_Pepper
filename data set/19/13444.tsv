2005-06-04T09:49:00.000Z	azad		hi there.. i lost my graphical surface! and "startx" doesn't work.. doesn't find the command
2005-06-04T09:51:00.000Z	azad		any idea, anyone?
2005-06-04T09:51:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	what about 'Xorg'
2005-06-04T09:52:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	then something's messed up in your config.
2005-06-04T09:53:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	sorry, i don't honestly know.
2005-06-04T09:54:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	don't give up though; there are others here who could probably help.
2005-06-04T09:57:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	see, there you go! :)
2005-06-04T10:18:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	on breezy, it is Xorg
2005-06-04T10:18:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	*hoary*
2005-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	no, breezy too, but you shouldn't be using it. :P
2005-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	you're on breezy?
2005-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	that would explain your problems!  i had them last weekend and had to reinstall hoary. :P
2005-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	azad	andrewski	well.. good to know *laughs*
2005-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	but i kinda gave up after a certain point.  maybe you'll have better luck. :)
2005-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	if you don't know what you're doing or what things mean, you *definitely* should not be on breezy. :)
2005-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	then ubuntu probably isn't the best distro for you.
2005-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	good.
2005-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	don't take my word that that's necessary, but it is probably quicker. :P
2005-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	andrewski	azad	good luck!
