2008-10-29T03:54:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	he kept flooding unseen to your eyes ;-)
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	is there a way to have more than 4gb of ram on the 32bit version of Windows? does that answer your question?
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	the answer is yes for Windows
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	oohh, url or it didn't happen
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	enable Physical Address Extension it's been arround forever before 64bit even existed
2008-11-30T21:58:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	how else do you supposed old servers pre-64bit had 64gigs of ram?
2009-09-01T14:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	diff - if you want graphical, try meld.
2009-09-01T15:02:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	I'm seeing stuff like 32,38c37,49
2009-09-01T15:02:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	line numbers
2009-09-01T15:07:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	is there a way to get a more readable printout?
2009-09-01T15:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	I personally get a more readable printout with a graphical diff viewer such as meld, I'm not familiar with diff on the command line
2009-09-01T15:07:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	I only have command line on this ubuntu server
2009-09-01T15:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	if you want to work on CLI, I guess you could use the patch mode or whatever it's called
2009-09-01T15:08:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	hrm thats an option but I gotta try to find out whats been altared between to two site source codes before I do anything that might be fatal
2009-09-01T15:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	NetEcho	I meant the mode in diff that you can use to make patches
2009-09-01T15:10:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	trying a split column view
2009-09-01T15:21:00.000Z	NetEcho	Myrtti	so meld makes it easier to see exactly which parts changed?
