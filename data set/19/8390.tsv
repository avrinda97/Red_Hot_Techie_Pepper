2007-04-03T14:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	maybe xubuntu
2007-04-03T14:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	more memory would be a big help
2007-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	can you get more memory?
2007-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	ram ?
2007-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	yes
2007-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	bummer, even 512 would be a huge help
2007-04-03T14:20:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	what do you think ? i can get more ram ... :/
2007-04-03T14:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	you could get Xubuntu Alternate CD, and use the text-based installer
2007-04-03T14:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	or you could stick some more memory in, which will make your whole experience a lot more fun
2007-04-03T14:21:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	what do you mean alternate ? is not the normal cd?
2007-04-03T14:25:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	http://www.xubuntu.org/get , which one is the alternate cd
2007-04-03T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	go here -> http://www.xubuntu.org/get and pick your local mirror, then download the alternate install CD for your computer
2007-04-03T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	you almost certainly want the PC Intel X86 one
2007-04-03T14:30:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	thank you
2007-04-03T14:31:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	i'm downloaiding the PC (Intel x86) alternate install CD i ok right? 682M
2007-04-03T14:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	paparaya	sounds about right
2007-04-03T14:31:00.000Z	paparaya	gordonjcp	:))))))))
