2006-01-10T08:42:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	root is disabled by default.
2006-01-10T09:12:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	Everyone is ignoring you.
2006-01-10T09:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	Because it snowed here today... :(
2006-01-26T06:40:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	Possibly, what's the issue?
2006-01-26T06:42:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	I don't see anything in your lspci that looks like a soundcard... what *should* it be seeing?
2006-01-26T06:46:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	What should it be seeing?  What's your soundcard?  (Maker, model #, integrated/pci...)
2006-01-26T06:52:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	Is it a pci card or an integrated chip?
2006-01-26T06:56:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	That would work.  Check if it's an actual add-on card or just a motherboard component.
2006-01-26T07:00:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	k
2006-01-26T08:21:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	It's like PCI, only less common.
2006-01-26T08:21:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CanadianSnow	And different.
