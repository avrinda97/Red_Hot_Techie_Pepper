2010-06-18T13:02:00.000Z	MrEgg964		Hi all. How do I boot into recovery mode with Lucid?
2010-06-18T13:03:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 single at the grub prompt
2010-06-18T13:04:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	I don't even get grub menu (this was easy with grub1, but I'm not familiar with grub2)
2010-06-18T13:04:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 when you reboot your box. <tab> when it starts to load and change the grub line to single
2010-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	thanks :)
2010-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 did you log out and log back in?
2010-06-24T13:53:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 what does this say? $ cat /etc/group|grep cdrom
2010-06-24T13:54:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 and are you able to sudo into root from that same account?
2010-06-24T13:56:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	and here is my fstab entry : /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
2010-06-24T13:57:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 and $ mount /media/cdrom0 as phillip doesn't work?
2010-06-24T13:58:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	Manual mount, you mean? I'll give that a try.
2010-06-24T14:01:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	nope, it doesn't work. Maybe there is something wrong with the cd itself.
2010-06-24T14:02:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 anything useful in $ dmesg | tail -n20?
2010-06-24T14:03:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	not really. I'm doing this remotely, I can't actually see what kind of cd they've inserted into the drive.
2010-06-24T14:04:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	but what you're saying is, with cdrom and plugdev membership, I should be good to go, right?
2010-06-24T14:04:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 if you are remote, then ssh in and run that command
2010-06-24T14:05:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	 I would think so yes. but if it is an audio cd you can't mount it
2010-06-24T14:06:00.000Z	MrEgg964	AAA	ok, thanks. I'll bring my own data cd with me next time I'm at the computer, and run the test there. Thanks for your time.
2010-06-24T14:07:00.000Z	AAA	MrEgg964	  good luck
