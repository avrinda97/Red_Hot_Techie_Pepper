2009-09-19T20:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	so the installer mad a 2.4 GiB parition for root that's weird...
2009-09-19T20:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	where did the rest of the space go 250 giB - 231 (windos) = 19 GiB
2009-09-19T20:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	the windows parition is 231 GiB in size
2009-09-19T20:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	/dev/sda1             231G  2.7G  228G   2% /media/disk
2009-09-19T20:23:00.000Z	JohannesSM64	erUSUL	after installing XP, i booted into it, and C: was indeed 30 GB
2009-09-19T20:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	o.0!!
2009-09-19T20:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	maybe somewhat you resized it suring install ?
2009-09-19T20:24:00.000Z	JohannesSM64	erUSUL	the option i selected during installation was "install side by side, choosing at each startup", and it didn't give me any options regarding resizing
2009-09-19T20:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	dunno really maybe there is a bug in the installer... to be honest i allways do may own paritionning of disk before installing
2009-09-19T20:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	reinstall doing a manual paritioning (before or during install) ?
2009-09-19T20:30:00.000Z	JohannesSM64	erUSUL	how? delete everything, then install XP, then install ubuntu with manual partitioning not touching the XP partition?
2009-09-19T20:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	no the windows install can be kept just resize its parition to make the room for ubuntu. then crete the partitions for ubuntu ( i recommend / /home and swap )
2009-09-19T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	swap == ram ; 15 GiB root (/) the rest for /home
2009-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	JohannesSM64	virtualization does not help with gaming
