2007-12-04T20:46:00.000Z	kjp2		I seem to be missing linux/config.h in the kernel tree anyone know how / where it's generated ?
2007-12-04T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	its a glib header
2007-12-04T20:48:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	glib header? which package is that ?
2007-12-04T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	libc
2007-12-04T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	use synaptic to check the exact package name
2007-12-04T20:49:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	libc6-dev is already installed
2007-12-04T20:50:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	any other ideas?
2007-12-04T20:51:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	sorry, but I'd get this for you in 30 seconds if I had an ubuntu box to hand
2007-12-04T20:52:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	any idea what to search for ?
2007-12-04T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	see if you can find the santised header package
2007-12-04T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	libc-header, something like that
2007-12-04T20:54:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	hmm.
2007-12-04T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	sorry, its hard not having an ubuntu box to be exact with
2007-12-04T21:03:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	so packages.ubuntu.org, searched leads to libdevel0-dev
2007-12-04T21:03:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	which I installed, and it provides /usr/include/config/config.h
2007-12-04T21:03:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	what provides /usr/include/linux/config.h any ideas?
2007-12-04T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	that should be libc-headers
2007-12-04T21:22:00.000Z	ikonia	kjp2	is it really
2007-12-04T21:25:00.000Z	kjp2	ikonia	yeah, it means that the quickcam drivers are broken
