2005-12-22T11:56:00.000Z	angsty		ok now it's freezing after I log in. shows a cursor, and the brownish-orange ubuntu thing, and then everything stops responding, caps-lock and all that don't change when I press them
2005-12-22T11:57:00.000Z	angsty		why does ubuntu hate me
2005-12-22T11:57:00.000Z	angsty		:|
2005-12-22T11:58:00.000Z	angsty		is this a known problem, it freezing after login?
2005-12-22T12:00:00.000Z	angsty		I have no idea how to browse the forums or wiki or anything from a console
2005-12-22T12:00:00.000Z	angsty		I am fairly amazed I managed to remember irssi :(
2005-12-22T12:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	You do not know how to read web pages?
2005-12-22T12:00:00.000Z	angsty	BlueEagle	not from this I don't
2005-12-22T12:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	ALT+F1 trough F6
2005-12-22T12:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	Will give you access to six consoles.
2005-12-22T12:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	Did you start linux with runlevel 1?
2005-12-22T12:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	:)
2005-12-22T12:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	Let me rephrase: How did you get to where you are now?
2005-12-22T12:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	Ok, then you probably are at runlevel 1 and have got no multitasking availible.
2005-12-22T12:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	We're working on it. As intelikey sais. Quit irssi and type openvt -c 2 bash
2005-12-22T12:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	after that get back here. :)
2005-12-22T12:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	Yes.
2005-12-22T12:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	before you quit:
2005-12-22T12:11:00.000Z	BlueEagle	angsty	borked xorg.conf in most cases. Might be a wrongly detected (usb?) keyboard and/or mouse. Might be an USB port that hasn't been reset properly. Might be any number of drivers not working correctly due to mis-detected hardware. Sound might be the problem but I haven't seen a case where it's taken the whole system down.
