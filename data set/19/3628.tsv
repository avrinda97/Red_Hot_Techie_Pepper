2009-12-16T09:32:00.000Z	Funzo	leaf-sheep	I've read that link, but my situation doesnt really fit into there, I reformatted my ext3 partition to ext4
2009-12-16T09:32:00.000Z	Funzo		by accident and lost years worth of data
2009-12-16T09:33:00.000Z	Funzo		the guides never mention anything about what to do if it;'s been reformatted
2009-12-16T09:34:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery#Lost%20Partition ?
2009-12-16T09:37:00.000Z	Funzo	leaf-sheep	thanks, but it still doesnt mention anything about reformatted partitions, it assumes I have only deleted it
2009-12-16T09:38:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	How big is the storage?
2009-12-16T09:38:00.000Z	Funzo	leaf-sheep	400gb
2009-12-16T09:39:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	The Main OS on it? (The one you're on right now?) or is it separated parition?
2009-12-16T09:39:00.000Z	Funzo		only the /home drive
2009-12-16T09:40:00.000Z	Funzo		and I'm running a live cd now
2009-12-16T09:41:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	Do you have any hard drive that you could use? I'm thinking that you could ddrescue to "clone" the home partition (byte for byte) then you could play around with recovery tools on the image instead of the actual partition.
2009-12-16T09:41:00.000Z	Funzo	leaf-sheep	I don't have any storage that big, otherwise I would have made a backup before haha
2009-12-16T09:42:00.000Z	Funzo		but at this point the data is gone so I will  try anything
2009-12-16T09:42:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	Well, if it is that important, then you would be wise.  I have 20GB dedicated for system, 2TB for data. So the home partition is really small for me.
2009-12-16T09:42:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	You could try and recover it... It is not all lost, you know.
2009-12-16T09:43:00.000Z	Funzo		how?
2009-12-16T09:43:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Funzo	By actually playing with recovery tools on the home partitions and hopefully you can recover it.
