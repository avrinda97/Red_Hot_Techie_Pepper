2007-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	w0nder		hi everyone, I have a question.  Someone please help!!!
2007-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	w0nder		is there an issue with Ubuntu not allowing  NOPASSWD: ALL in sudoers????
2007-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	why would you ever want to do that?
2007-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	sudo exists for a reason... and you will break your system so easily and quickly if you do that.
2007-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	I actually just want to allow nopasswd for one certain command, but that doesn't work either.
2007-09-01T05:18:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	what command?
2007-09-01T05:18:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	useradd and chmod
2007-09-01T05:19:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	this doesn't sound fun.... why/
2007-09-01T05:20:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	because I need the web server to be able to create users so proftd can accept their logins
2007-09-01T05:20:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	don't use ftp, its insecure
2007-09-01T05:21:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	what do you recommend? I'm trying to come up with a solution for internal users to send files externally, when our email server doesn't allow
2007-09-01T05:21:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	sftp
2007-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	this has to be easy and standard... most company's helpdesks wont even know what to do with sftp
2007-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	I just don't like the idea of this at all :P If your email server doesn't allow it... then make it allow it. OR set up sftp accounts all at once for everyone who needs one
2007-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	and it's not practical for me to have to help every single person out
2007-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	pricechild	w0nder	this is your server's security we're talking about
2007-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	just one server, and it's only running this one web page form and sends email out
2007-09-01T05:22:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	im sorry, not email, file
2007-09-01T05:24:00.000Z	w0nder	pricechild	i know im going against your advice, ,and security is important to me, but that's why this machine is sandboxed in a vmware.. it serves a very small purpose
