2007-07-09T15:19:00.000Z	alexIdoi12		so is there anyone with an idea of how to display the amount of RAM used ?
2007-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	alexIdoi12		or even the CPU temperature ?
2007-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	alexIdoi12		that would be useful

2007-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	in a terminal
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	alexIdoi12	TaJMoX	yes sure I know all of that but how to display them in my top bar
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	Install sensors-applet
2007-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	the system monitor applet can show your memmory usage
2007-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	alexIdoi12	TaJMoX	thanks
2007-07-09T15:24:00.000Z	alexIdoi12	TaJMoX	once apt-geted where do I launch sensors-applets ?
2007-07-09T15:24:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	right click on panel - add to panel - hardware sensors
2007-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	alexIdoi12	TaJMoX	I might have to restart x I don't see them in there
2007-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	you can just restart the gnome panel with sudo killall gnome-panel
2007-07-09T15:30:00.000Z	alexIdoi12	TaJMoX	I have them install, but temp1, temp2 temp3 conrespond to what exactly ?
2007-07-09T15:31:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	Depends on your motherboard, whatever is the hottest is your cpu =)  and there is probably a sensor somewhere else in your motherboard (probably for the cpu cooler) and one for the temp in your case
2007-07-09T15:33:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	60=bad usually
2007-07-09T15:33:00.000Z	TaJMoX	alexIdoi12	what's it at now?
2007-07-09T15:34:00.000Z	alexIdoi12	TaJMoX	^
