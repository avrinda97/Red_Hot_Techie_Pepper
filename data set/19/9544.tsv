2006-10-26T12:11:00.000Z	ehird		before i compile, is there any other way to get pygame?
2006-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	ehird		aahh, universe
2006-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	ehird		i have to edit a file for that right?
2006-10-26T12:13:00.000Z	ehird		(Sorry, I'm very much a n00b..)
2006-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	ehird		it's sources.list i think the file, but where is it?
2006-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	ehird		and you guys said it'd handle the load :-)
2006-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	ehird		 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28481/ i've uncommented universe in sources.list but it still says this :S
2006-10-26T12:18:00.000Z	ehird		by the way, is there any way to get numlock to turn on at startup? i type the numbers in my password with the numpad so it jarrs my typing often
2006-10-26T12:19:00.000Z	ehird		probably not a good idea for people with files on there
2006-10-26T12:19:00.000Z	ehird		this apt-get update thing, does it take a long time? it seems to be :p
