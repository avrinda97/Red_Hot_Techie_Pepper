2008-06-21T14:23:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	thats when you told me to rename it isnt it? it shows Driver: Nvidia
2008-06-21T14:25:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	im unable to use the nvidia settings i donno why
2008-06-21T14:27:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	yes, u mean like Nvidia X server settings?
2008-06-21T14:27:00.000Z	starz	Bob26	yeah
2008-06-21T14:28:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	i get an error when i open it but can still enter it. it says You do not appear to be using the nvidia x driver.
2008-06-21T14:28:00.000Z	starz	Bob26	good thats a start
2008-06-21T14:29:00.000Z	starz	Bob26	click on x server display configuration and make the screen size correct to what you want.then save to x configuration file button, and dont merge, just replace
2008-06-21T14:29:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	i had that error before as well though. Before i installed the nvidia-legacy
2008-06-21T14:30:00.000Z	starz	Bob26	dont worry about it
2008-06-21T14:30:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	ok ill try 1 sec
2008-06-21T14:38:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	ok i tested it out, the screens coming out ok now, but before when it was working the text was clearer and it wasnt too bright. i also get a blur line on top of the video when i play them.
2008-06-21T14:39:00.000Z	starz	Bob26	its a starting point
2008-06-21T14:40:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	yeh i think so
2008-06-21T14:41:00.000Z	Bob26	starz	its not very easy on the eyes though
