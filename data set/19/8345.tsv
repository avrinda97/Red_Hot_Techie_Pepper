2007-05-09T15:56:00.000Z	wolke		hi! how can i partition and format my usb-stick on edgy?
2007-05-09T15:57:00.000Z	variant	wolke	the gui way would be with gparted, the commandline (and faster) way is with cfdisk/mkfs
2007-05-09T15:58:00.000Z	wolke	variant	i had tried it with fdisk, but it doesn't work. i suspect, the problem is it was mounted
2007-05-09T15:59:00.000Z	wolke	variant	and if i unmount the stick, i can't access it any more, can i?
2007-05-09T16:00:00.000Z	variant	wolke	you partition and format while it's unmounted
2007-05-10T16:01:00.000Z	wolke	variant	but how can i access it, when it's unmounted. it will lose it's /dev-point
2007-05-10T16:01:00.000Z	variant	wolke	no it won't
2007-05-10T16:06:00.000Z	wolke	variant	i tried it, and it won't access the stick, when it's unmounted
2007-05-10T16:06:00.000Z	variant	wolke	then you are doing it wrong
2007-05-10T16:06:00.000Z	variant	wolke	remember that you need to be root to do those things (sudo command name or sudo -i to become root()
2007-05-10T16:08:00.000Z	wolke	variant	 sudo fdisk /dev/sda
2007-05-10T16:09:00.000Z	variant	wolke	i told you to use cfdisk not fdisk
2007-05-10T16:09:00.000Z	wolke	variant	same thing
2007-05-10T16:09:00.000Z	wolke	variant	same result
2007-05-10T16:09:00.000Z	variant	wolke	what result
2007-05-10T16:10:00.000Z	wolke	variant	 FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive
2007-05-10T16:12:00.000Z	wolke	variant	would i need to create some device first?
2007-05-10T16:12:00.000Z	variant	wolke	no, as long ast he device is plugged in and not mounted that should work fine
2007-05-10T16:13:00.000Z	wolke	variant	it doesn't work. :((
