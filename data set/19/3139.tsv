2009-10-27T09:15:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	Why do you want Itunes. Can't you use gtkpod?
2009-10-27T09:16:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	Its because I can.....
2009-10-27T09:17:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	and its also the challenge of trying to get windows apps/games I use to run, running again with wine
2009-10-27T09:22:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	Which version of Itunes were you trying to set up. I think the latest that worked was 7.7.
2009-10-27T09:23:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	I know 8 will let you sync with the Iphone but I don't think it will run on 9.04.
2009-10-27T09:23:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	I was going with the newest itunes 9+ but its a bust so I want something like 7 or above
2009-10-27T09:24:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	The last one I know that worked was 7.7, but I don't think you can find it anymore.
2009-10-27T09:24:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	will 8.0 work?
2009-10-27T09:25:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	I was just on the forums and it seems it won't.
2009-10-27T09:25:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	If I use it I will only need it for my ipod nano 2nd gen
2009-10-27T09:26:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	oh and my ipod shuffle
2009-10-27T09:26:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	The search I used had several links and they said you couldn't install beyond 7.7.
2009-10-27T09:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	I'll take a crack at it, brb
2009-10-27T09:28:00.000Z	Th_Doctor	ShapeShifter499	Good luck. If you get it to work, post it in the forums.
2009-10-27T09:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	I know, I did a test on itunes 8.1, look for a person with the name lance, thats me
2009-10-27T09:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Th_Doctor	look in the appdb for wine
