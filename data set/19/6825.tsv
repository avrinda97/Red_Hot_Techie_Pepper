2007-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Do you have a support question?
2007-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Sometimes things get missed.
2007-12-11T20:19:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	What version?
2007-12-11T20:19:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	I think that is just there as a warning.
2007-12-11T20:19:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	I dont have a pressed CD available to me.
2007-12-11T20:20:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Log a bug if you are really concerned about it.
2007-12-11T20:21:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Yes, well thats what it will do.
2007-12-11T20:23:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Have you personally tried running the install?
2007-12-11T20:25:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	The partitioning steps are well explained.
2007-12-28T20:11:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Ask in ##windows, many of them are Linux users as well.
2007-12-28T20:12:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	Fixing windows is a windows problem, not an Ubuntu one.
2007-12-28T20:12:00.000Z	LOGAN	Pici	i dont have any other option then use ubuntu

2010-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	Pici	LOGAN	This has never been a discussion channel. It is for support only.  You may use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics.
