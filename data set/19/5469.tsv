2012-08-30T23:43:00.000Z	savio		i'm making symbolic link into /usr/local/bin/ but i can't access the command in terminal
2012-08-30T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	you'll need to explain clearer than that
2012-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	i was extracted package and to execute the exectuable file i made a link of that file into /usr/local/bin so i can access that executable without goinig into that directory and issuing ./***
2012-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	ok, so it's not in your $PATH
2012-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	yup
2012-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	so put it in your $PATH
2012-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	it already there
2012-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	please show me ls -la on the binary
2012-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	please show me ls -la on the binary
2012-08-30T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	and none of those commands are working in htere ?
2012-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	you can't do that, you'll need a link to every binary
2012-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	show me ls -la on two of the links in /usr/local/bin
2012-08-30T23:51:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	i removed them
2012-08-30T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	ok, so then you need to create a symlink for every binary in /opt to an individual link in /usr/local/bin
2012-08-30T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	you also need to confirm /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH
2012-08-30T23:52:00.000Z	ikonia	savio	then create each symlink manually
2012-08-30T23:52:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	rox i will try recreating the link
2012-08-30T23:53:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	just for record i try this day ago it was working
2012-08-30T23:55:00.000Z	savio	ikonia	Jordan_U saviola@Saviola-PC:~$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/ |grep msf
