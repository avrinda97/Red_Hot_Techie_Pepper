2007-06-22T14:00:00.000Z	leagris		Can someone help about using Quanta HTML editor in gnome environment. I have problems working with UTF-8 encoded documents because keyboard input bring unproperly encoded typing.
2007-06-22T14:01:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	I never experienced problems with quanta in gnome
2007-06-22T14:02:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	when typing  it gets  instead and so on with UTF-8 documents.
2007-06-22T14:03:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	I do a try, wait a moment
2007-06-22T14:03:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	already present UTF-8 display ok but there is problem with keyboard input.
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	ok. you could fix using &#232; in the html. is your keybord layout properly configured?
2007-06-22T14:07:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	yes it is. There are no problems with GTK/gnome applications
2007-06-22T14:11:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	 I guessed. So it's a quanta problem. Have you any other kde app installed? have you there the same problem?
2007-06-22T14:12:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	have all the KDE stuffs installed because I worked within KDE some time ago.
2007-06-22T14:12:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	could you reproduce the UTF-8 input wierdness?
2007-06-22T14:13:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	no, I can't. can you teach me?
2007-06-22T14:16:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	open quanta, go to menu Settings/Configure Quanta select environment Icon in left side then set Default character encoding to utf8. After that, create a new xhtml/xml document and try typing some accentuated characters    ...
2007-06-22T14:18:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	it was already configured to use utf-8 ad default. It works.
2007-06-22T14:43:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	back, moved away .kde .kderc .qt from my home, logged in kde session and retryed quanta. Same problem with UTF-8. My locale setting is fr_FR.UTF-8@euro
2007-06-22T14:45:00.000Z	mat1980	leagris	my locale setting is it_IT
2007-06-22T14:49:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	thanks, found the bug is related to locale settings. Using LOCALE=fr_FR or LOCALE=fr_FR.UTF-8 is ok in quanta, but when switching to LOCALE=fr_FR.UTF-8@euro it can no longer enter UTF-8 characters in the editor. Would you try this with LOCALE=it_IT.UTF-8@euro ?
2007-06-22T14:55:00.000Z	leagris	mat1980	if you talked to me the lasts minutes, I was disconnected.
