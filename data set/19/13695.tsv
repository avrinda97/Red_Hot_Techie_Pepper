2005-03-16T14:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_		You can get good themes that make it good looking in Gnome also :)
2005-03-16T14:15:00.000Z	Tomcat_		I got... no idea, it looks OSX-ish :)
2005-03-16T14:16:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Nice. :o
2005-03-16T14:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	for future reference, if you want to know, it's *very* easy to convert image filetypes with ImageMagick. One command.
2005-03-16T14:18:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	I'll have a look.
2005-03-16T14:18:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	I don't have imagemagick installed it seems. :)
2005-03-16T14:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	you can install it from the repositories. Then, a simple command like, "convert -quality 75 picture.png picture.jpg" and it'll be very small.
2005-03-16T14:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	not quite sure if it comes by default on Ubuntu. I guess you could try to see if you've got the convert command
2005-03-16T14:19:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	Yeah, I know it... but when I want to get out a pic in a few seconds, I don't install additional software. It's not like I do screenshots every day. :)
2005-03-16T14:19:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	libmagick comes by default, imagemagick is available.
2005-03-16T14:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	Well, sure. You obviously don't have to keep installing. And yes, it would perhaps not be worth it if you were only ever using one image; hence the "for future reference".
2005-03-16T14:20:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	Yeah. Thanks. :] 
2006-04-29T09:33:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	xine can't do WMV9 afaik...
2006-04-29T09:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	neither can the w32codecs available for GNU/Linux, no?
2006-04-29T09:34:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	Sure, works for me.
2006-04-29T09:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	got an example file? I only have xine here, I'll tell you if it works.
2006-04-29T09:36:00.000Z	Tomcat_	apokryphos	http://www.jengajam.com/r/lazy-sunday-chris-snl <--- Press "download"... try that file.
2006-04-29T09:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	I don't see any "Download" text there...
2006-04-29T09:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Tomcat_	geh, ignore me. Got it.
