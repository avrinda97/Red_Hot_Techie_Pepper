2008-09-25T17:09:00.000Z	steveccc		hi all - i want to purchase a usb hard disk to use with ubuntu - most are obviously formatted with fat 32 but I want to reformat them with ext3 preferably - I would have thought as they are all usb disks which should be detected by linux that I can format any of them with ext3 but do some have issues working with linux?
2008-09-25T17:11:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	why do you want ext3 on it... are you going to install ubuntu on it?
2008-09-25T17:14:00.000Z	steveccc	arvind_khadri	no just dont want fat32
2008-09-25T17:14:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	then just buy it and format it with ext3 :)
2008-09-25T17:15:00.000Z	steveccc	arvind_khadri	thanks - thats what I was double checking that I can format any of them and actionparsnip gave me a thumbs up and so are you so thanks
2008-09-25T17:16:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	welcome :)
2008-09-25T17:16:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	tune2fs is one :)
2008-09-25T17:17:00.000Z	steveccc	arvind_khadri	its mainly to stop someone in the family opening it and overwriting work - they wont go to installing plugins to access it it just wont read
2008-09-25T17:19:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	oh
2008-09-25T17:20:00.000Z	steveccc	arvind_khadri	there isnt a simple way of encrypting the drive is there
2008-09-25T17:21:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	in Windoze or in Ubuntu
2008-09-25T17:22:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	steveccc	i guess RAID is also used for that
2008-09-25T17:23:00.000Z	steveccc	arvind_khadri	not sure what you mean with raid comment
