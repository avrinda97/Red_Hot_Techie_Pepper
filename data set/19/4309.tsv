2009-02-09T00:02:00.000Z	joanki125		recently
2009-02-09T00:02:00.000Z	joanki125		and also to see what users there are on my system?

2009-02-09T00:02:00.000Z	joanki125		no _VIM_

2009-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	joanki125	klasikahl	for previously logged in?
2009-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	/var/log/auth.log is the log of authenticated sessions
2009-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	joanki125		thanks klas
2009-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	take a look at /var/log/auth.log.. whatever editor you prefer, or `less`
2009-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	joanki125	klasikahl	so that helped, but it only goes back to february 4
2009-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	joanki125		is there a farther back log?
2009-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	joanki125		thanks by the way
2009-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	yes
2009-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	logrotate compresses your logs and puts them in archive mode
2009-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	ls /var/log/auth.log*
2009-02-09T00:05:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	to read the ones with .gz extension, do `gunzip <log>`
2009-02-09T00:05:00.000Z	klasikahl	joanki125	then use your viewer
