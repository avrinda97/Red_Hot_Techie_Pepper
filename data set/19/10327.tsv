2009-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	zamba		is it possible to set up a user with a blank password?
2009-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	zamba		so the user only needs to click on an icon to log on? kind of like *shrug* windows does it?
2009-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	hwilde	zamba	you can do autologin if you want
2009-01-20T18:54:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	well.. i still want the option of logging in as different users..
2009-01-20T18:54:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	so an option that says "click here to log on as x or type in your username below"
2009-01-20T18:55:00.000Z	hwilde	zamba	i wouldnt recommend it but http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=17520
2009-01-26T17:46:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	i wonder about the same
2009-01-26T17:46:00.000Z	hwilde	zamba	yeah the repos only give v2.4 even with all updates
2009-01-26T17:47:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	yup
2009-01-26T17:47:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	you can of course just manually install the packages for 3.0, but i am too looking for the "ubuntu/debian" way of doing it
2009-01-26T17:47:00.000Z	hwilde	zamba	yes that is specifically the question

2009-01-26T17:48:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	have you seen that?
2009-01-26T17:48:00.000Z	hwilde	zamba	it's easy to just dl the deb but i wonder
2009-01-26T17:49:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	the developers didn't have time to test it in time for 8.10
2009-01-26T17:49:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	see the url i gave you
2009-01-26T17:49:00.000Z	zamba	hwilde	again, see the url i posted
