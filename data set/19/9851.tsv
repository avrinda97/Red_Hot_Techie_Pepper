2006-09-08T13:14:00.000Z	don_jr		How do I use a .bin file?
2006-09-08T13:16:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	this is assuming that your .bin file is some kind of program, it could also be a MacBinary file, or simply a binary file of some kind
2006-09-08T13:17:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	it's a download from java, said on the site to be a 'self extracting' file....
2006-09-08T13:18:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	if it is a self-extracting archive for linux, that should work
2006-09-08T13:18:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	I thought so to, but it tells me "command not found"
2006-09-08T13:19:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	you need to cd into the directory that you downloaded the file into
2006-09-08T13:19:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	I'm there
2006-09-08T13:19:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	then type "chmod u+x " <name of .bin file>
2006-09-08T13:20:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	then type ./<name of .bin file> (note there is no space between the slash and the file name)
2006-09-08T13:20:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	the chmod fixed it, thank you
2006-09-08T13:22:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	chmod u+x mean "make this file executable for the user that owns it
2006-09-08T13:22:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	Okay, thank you.  I've got my notebook here I"ve been writing all my commands into that I learn.  I appriciate it.
2006-09-08T13:27:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	easyubuntu is nice, but it's VERY easy to get all that stuff working without it
2006-09-08T13:27:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	for java, you can just apt-get install sun-java5-plugin
2006-09-08T13:28:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	you have to have the multiverse repository enabled for sun-java5-plugin
2006-09-08T13:28:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	I have multiverse and univers enabled, monklegacy I'll do a search for jre now
2006-09-08T13:29:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	the sun-java5-plugin will install all the extras you need
2006-09-08T13:29:00.000Z	don_jr	backlit	getting it now, thank you again
2006-09-08T13:29:00.000Z	backlit	don_jr	np, it's what i'm here for :)
