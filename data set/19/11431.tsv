2006-08-01T14:08:00.000Z	stoned		I did what https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto said about nvidia, installed nvidia-glx and typed nvidia-glx-config enable and when I try to startx it crashes saying nvidia kernel module is not loaded.  I tried to modprobe nvidia but that said module not found.  What do I need to do here?
