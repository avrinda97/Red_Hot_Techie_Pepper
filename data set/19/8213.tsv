2007-04-23T16:57:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		nope
2007-04-23T16:57:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		static
2007-04-23T05:45:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		My ifconfig address shows up as 192.168.2.133, but in /etc/network/interfaces and in the networking gui it is set as 192.168.2.15 Why would there be a conflict, and how can I fix it?
2007-04-23T05:46:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	maybe dhcpcd is rewriting things
2007-04-23T05:46:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	I'm using static ip, how can I kill dhcpd? ps ax | grep dhcpd and kill the pid?
2007-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	so dhcpcd is running?
2007-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	no, but eth0 is showing up in a process which grep turned up, but I have no idea what it is
2007-04-23T05:49:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	here's the paste: 16002 ?        S      0:00 /sbin/dhclient -1 -lf /var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.eth0.leases -pf /var/run/dhclient.eth0.pid -q -e dhc_dbus=31 -d eth0
2007-04-23T05:51:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	wait a minute
2007-04-23T05:51:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	ok
2007-04-23T05:51:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	what's your eth0 config?
2007-04-23T05:52:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	check your pm
2007-04-23T05:56:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	are you behind a router?
2007-04-23T05:56:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	I sent my eth0 config to you in a private message to not flood the channel
2007-04-23T05:56:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	ok
2007-04-23T05:59:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	It's strange dhclient is running, disable it
2007-04-23T05:59:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	I'm not sure how?
2007-04-23T06:00:00.000Z	Debaser	Robbie_Crash	nor do I, I don't use ubuntu but check the system > administration > services dialogue
2007-04-23T06:01:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Debaser	Just did, it's not in there.I killed the process though, and am going to try resetting my ip through the gui
