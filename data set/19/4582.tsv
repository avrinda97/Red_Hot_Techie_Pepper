2009-01-02T00:00:00.000Z	dmole		anyone want to tray and make ubuntu mount a hard drive?  just like this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/302960
2009-01-02T00:02:00.000Z	dmole		ubuntu 2.6.24-22-generic works fine but 2.6.27-11-generic will not mount the drive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2009-01-02T00:04:00.000Z	dmole		please someone must know what is stopping the new ubuntu from mounting drives
2009-01-02T00:05:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	I haven't had that problem myself. If it's just not detecting when devices are plugged in, make sure that the hal service is running
2009-01-02T00:09:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	it's not that I don't think because of whats in the dmesg
2009-01-02T00:09:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	dmesg is kernel logs; hal is what relays that information to userland.
2009-01-02T00:09:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	s/that information/notice of the events/
2009-01-02T00:10:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	anyhow, if you try to do the mount manually, does it work?
2009-01-02T00:10:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	like in the bug report I can't mount because sdb does not exist let alone sdb1    !
2009-01-02T00:12:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	ahh -- I think I missed something, then; did you paste a link to a bug report / your pastebinned dmesg output?
2009-01-02T00:13:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	yep first post https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/302960
2009-01-02T00:14:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	is this a Nokia phone you're mounting, or are you just getting the same message?
2009-01-02T00:16:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	same problem but for just an ordinary drive in a usb external box
2009-01-02T00:19:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	will you help as Jack_Sparrow bailed (nice guy but he has other things to do atm)
2009-01-02T00:21:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	last time I had that error it was related to the USB device failing.
2009-01-02T00:21:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	does it work in any other machine?
2009-01-02T00:21:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	yes it works fine on the LTS
2009-01-02T00:22:00.000Z	nDuff	dmole	...odd. I'm not sure it's an issue I'm equipt to help you with, unfortunately. If it really does, right now, today work well with the LTS release, you might consider downgrading to that kernel.
2009-01-02T00:24:00.000Z	dmole	nDuff	bummer
