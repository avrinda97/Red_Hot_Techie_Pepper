2008-03-27T04:16:00.000Z	siso		Hey...n00b question...my firewire drive won't show up on Kubuntu Feisty...any ideas?
2008-03-27T04:16:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	It doesn't auto mount? Or you don't see the device?
2008-03-27T04:18:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	Do you know if you have the firewire card/device recognized?
2008-03-27T04:18:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	As brent113 said, try lspci in the terminal.
2008-03-27T04:19:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	lspci |grep -i firewire

2008-03-27T04:20:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	What make and model is your external drive?
2008-03-27T04:23:00.000Z	siso	ls1024	Think maybe it's a driver issue?
2008-03-27T04:23:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	When you plug in your external HD, does dmesg say anything?
2008-03-27T04:23:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	It might be something with the driver for the external HD/enclosure chipset.
2008-03-27T04:24:00.000Z	siso	ls1024	Would it have recognized it no problem under Dapper and not Feisty?
2008-03-27T04:25:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	I'm not sure.
2008-03-27T04:25:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	Usually they don't take out support for hardware
2008-03-27T04:27:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	Possibly, but usually the mount points are created automatically, and on the desktop.
2008-03-27T04:28:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	There should be a corresponding device in /dev for it.
2008-03-27T04:29:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	/media is just a place for mount points.
2008-03-27T04:30:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	No problem.
2008-03-27T04:40:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	See ubotu above.
2008-03-27T04:46:00.000Z	ls1024	siso	Basically, when you update, the packages database gets locked.
