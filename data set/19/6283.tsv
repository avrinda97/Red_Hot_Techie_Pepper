2008-05-12T04:10:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	ok well, i would of thought you were using a vesa driver but its not coming up that way
2008-05-12T04:10:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	i have fglrx installed (had problems too ) and fell back it come up with vesa
2008-05-12T04:11:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	i just changd macines here
2008-05-12T04:12:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	when i did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg i ended up with vesa
2008-05-12T04:13:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	when i have a ati1300
2008-05-12T04:14:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	when i have a ati1300 and default is vesa unless i decided to install my fglrx driver
2008-05-12T04:14:00.000Z	phoenix5002	wirechief_	well is there a general way to backup any video driver, or is it different for different drivers?
2008-05-12T04:15:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	i just backup the xorg.conf
2008-05-12T04:15:00.000Z	phoenix5002	wirechief_	I tried that and it doesn't work because the driver on ati's website has the same name I think so it overwrites the one I currently have, or something like that
2008-05-12T04:16:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	i just backup the xorg.conf   cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2008-05-12T04:16:00.000Z	phoenix5002	wirechief_	basically the xorg.conf file looks exactly the same after I upgrade as it does now, but the driver is different, I have no "direct rendering" with the proprietary driver
2008-05-12T04:17:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	try backing up this /usr/src/ati-driver-installer-8-4-x86.x86_64.run
2008-05-12T04:18:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	thats what is used to make the driver
2008-05-12T04:18:00.000Z	phoenix5002	wirechief_	I don't have that file
2008-05-12T04:20:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	do updatedb  then do locate ati-driver
2008-05-12T04:20:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	do sudo updatedb  then do sudo locate ati-driver
2008-05-12T04:22:00.000Z	phoenix5002	wirechief_	ok I did that, and I got no output from either command...  I used "sudo updatedb"
2008-05-12T04:23:00.000Z	wirechief_	phoenix5002	well that locate should of found it. guess we are out of tricks here, sorry.
2008-05-12T04:23:00.000Z	phoenix5002	wirechief_	np, thanks for your help
