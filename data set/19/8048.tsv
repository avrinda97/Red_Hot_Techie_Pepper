2007-07-20T10:51:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	How much RAM does your laptop have?
2007-07-20T10:52:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	OK, so not low on that :) What is the CPU... normal or dual core etc
2007-07-20T10:54:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	hm wait, I will check (not my laptop)
2007-07-20T10:55:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	2.80GHz Pentium, single core
2007-07-20T10:56:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	OK, so really weird kernel options should be needed for dual-cores. Did you try as kernel option   noacpi      ?
2007-07-20T10:57:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	um, I said *single* core but okay, Ill try noacpi. thx
2007-07-20T10:58:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	I omitted the word "no" before the weird kernel options part :)
2007-07-20T10:59:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	ah ok ;)
2007-07-20T10:59:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	You may want to also try pci=routeirq
2007-07-20T11:00:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	okay
2007-07-20T11:10:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	okay, tried both noacpi and pci=routeirq and there was no change. I think thats because Im at the Loading phase still - the kernel hasnt even been started. Isnt that right? Also, I need to add the options *after* the "--", correct?
2007-07-20T11:11:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	You would need to put them before the -- but otherwise yes
2007-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	right, still the same before the --. well, thanks anyway ;(
2007-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	Well, I tried
2007-07-20T11:14:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	hey wait! it got to 100% this time :) with noacpi
2007-07-20T11:14:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	YEA! its booting. thanks a million!
2007-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	genii	logixoul	Cool :)  You're welcome
2007-07-20T11:19:00.000Z	logixoul	genii	ouch. now Im getting another error "/bin/sh: cant access tty: job control turned off" - any ideas about that?
