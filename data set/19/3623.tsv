2009-07-03T16:46:00.000Z	duckwars		How can I mount my external USB harddrive into my homedirectory?
2009-07-03T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	why?
2009-07-03T16:47:00.000Z	duckwars	jrib	because I made my ubuntu computer an afp server, which makes it able to be loaded like a drive is OS X, but the problem is, on the OS X prompt I can only go as high up as my homedirectory in the file hierarchy
2009-07-03T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	symlink would be the easy solution...
2009-07-03T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	ln -s TARGET NAME
2009-07-03T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	it's like a shortcut.  I'm not sure if that works in your scenario, but if it does not, pastebin your fstab with your modifications
2009-07-03T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	it's a command
2009-07-03T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	TARGET is what you want it to point to and NAME is what you want to call it/its location
2009-07-03T16:57:00.000Z	duckwars	jrib	it worked!! awesome!! thanks!
2009-07-03T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	remove him from the admin group or use System -> Administration -> Users and groups
2009-07-03T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	man deluser
2009-07-03T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	did you not see my previous response?
2009-07-03T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	man adduser ...
2009-07-03T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	sure, though you shouldn't need any options
2009-07-20T04:16:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	ssh isn't even installed by default
2009-07-20T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	why?
2009-07-20T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	you don't have physical access?
2009-07-20T04:21:00.000Z	duckwars	jrib	so now that I have no one in the admin group, am I just screwed? The guide you linked to me says that "BY DEFAULT, THE ROOT ACCOUNT PASSWORD IS LOCKED IN UBUNTU"
2009-07-20T04:22:00.000Z	jrib	duckwars	with physical access, just load "recovery mode" from the grub prompt
