2006-06-17T07:04:00.000Z	ic56	neuro_	harry is having trouble.  I presume he's already messed up his /etc/fstab.  diskmounter -b will make a backup copy of his /etc/fstab and create a new one.  The new one won't contain any of the old NTFS entries.
2006-06-17T07:05:00.000Z	ic56	neuro_	you gotta pay attention ;-)
2006-06-17T07:05:00.000Z	neuro_	ic56	yeah, i shoudl probably stop drinking :>
2006-06-17T07:06:00.000Z	ic56	neuro_	no that's not it.  The filename on the website is diskmounter-latest.txt  harry probably saved it by that filename but tried to invoke it by a different name.
