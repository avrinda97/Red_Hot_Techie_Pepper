2011-05-10T17:18:00.000Z	x012_kool		hi there, im trying to install from git, im executing the command git clone http://gnuradio.org/git/gnuradio.git
2011-05-10T17:19:00.000Z	x012_kool		what am i doing wrong guys ? the command console stays "congelated" waiting for more commands
2011-05-10T17:19:00.000Z	x012_kool		im a little bit lost...
2011-05-10T17:20:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	once you've cloned the source code repository, you'll need to build the program using the included instructions.
2011-05-10T17:20:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	maybe i have to wait to clon the code repository ?
2011-05-10T17:20:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	why?
2011-05-10T17:21:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	perhaps it would be easiest if you used a pastebin to show the commands you typed, and the result.
2011-05-10T17:22:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	http://pastebin.com/PcsQTqBX
2011-05-10T17:23:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	that looks right. did it not work?
2011-05-10T17:23:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	should i put all this commands?
2011-05-10T17:23:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	i put the first one and i get the response: Initialized empty Git repository in /home/mario/gnuradio/.git/
2011-05-10T17:24:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	i'm guessing you mis-typed that command; double-check it.
2011-05-10T17:25:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	 it seems it works!! the problem was that i had to wait to clone or download something
2011-05-10T17:26:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	thank you very much for your time.
2011-05-10T17:27:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	sure, no trouble.
2011-05-10T17:28:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	just one last question, where should i look for "usual" commands in ubuntu, i'd like to know the meaning of ./   ./bootstrap and so on...
2011-05-10T17:29:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	./bootstrap isn't a linux command per se, just a script to set up the autotools infrastructure needed for the rest of the build.
2011-05-10T18:36:00.000Z	x012_kool	sipior	but, where could i find "the most typical" commands ans scripts ? any web ?
2011-05-10T18:37:00.000Z	sipior	x012_kool	might be best to start here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
