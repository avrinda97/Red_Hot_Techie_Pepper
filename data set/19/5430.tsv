2009-01-11T02:02:00.000Z	woody86		how can I start GDM after I've disabled it in the 'Services'
2009-01-11T02:04:00.000Z	unop	woody86	sudo update-rc.d gdm defaults
2009-01-11T02:02:00.000Z	unop	woody86	sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start
2009-01-11T02:03:00.000Z	woody86	unop	ok, and how can I make it the default?
2009-01-11T02:05:00.000Z	woody86	unop	that said it 'etc/init.d/gdm missing LSB style header'
2009-01-11T02:06:00.000Z	unop	woody86	hmm, try enabling it the same way you disabled it then -- if that gives the same error, you might want to reinstall gdm.
2009-01-11T02:07:00.000Z	woody86	unop	well 'Services' are greyed out, and I can't unlock it either
2009-01-11T02:08:00.000Z	unop	woody86	 reinstall gdm perhaps.  sudo aptitude reinstall gdm
2009-01-11T02:18:00.000Z	woody86	unop	 hey thanks! it worked :)
2009-01-11T02:19:00.000Z	unop	woody86	volumes are checked for consistency at every startup - but a full fsck is only carried out every so-many boots
2009-01-11T02:21:00.000Z	woody86	unop	cause if mine isn't on battery power, it adds another 10 secs to the startup, and it says 'Running fsck' but I don't know if this is checking the volumes, or is a full fsck?
2009-01-11T02:22:00.000Z	unop	woody86	a full fsck would probably take much longer than that - i guess that's just a consistency check then (which is not done when running on batter power)
2009-01-11T02:23:00.000Z	woody86	unop	even though it's the reiserFS? I heard they do fsck really quickly since it's a journaling FS
2009-01-11T02:24:00.000Z	unop	woody86	sure, the process takes time - same as with ext3 - which is also a journalled file system.
2009-01-11T02:25:00.000Z	woody86	unop	ok. Thanks :)
2009-02-25T03:58:00.000Z	unop	woody86	iwconfig
2009-02-25T04:00:00.000Z	woody86	unop	what about the comand that actually shows the type of adapter? Like the name of it?
2009-02-25T04:01:00.000Z	unop	woody86	lspci, lshw -C network, lshal, etc
2009-02-25T04:01:00.000Z	woody86	unop	tyvm!
