2006-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	kargath64		just a quick question, if anyone knows...
2006-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	kargath64		in dapper, is the kernel built with the same version gcc that is supplied with dapper?
2006-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	kargath64		dammit
2006-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	kargath64		that makes ubuntu rather useless for me
2006-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	mcphail	kargath64	i think the dapper kernel is built with gcc4, is it not?
2006-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	kargath64		'cause i have an nVIDIA vid card
2006-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	kargath64		and nforce mobo
2006-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	kargath64		and the drivers will not install if the gcc version on system is a different major version than what the kernel was built with
2006-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	mcphail		it make life easier
2006-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	mcphail	kargath64	you can compile with an older version of gcc
2006-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	kargath64		meaning that i have no sound, no 3d, no ethernet (so no internet/apt-get)
2006-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	mcphail	kargath64	nforce4 board?
2006-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	kargath64	mcphail	yes, nforce4 not Ultra
2006-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	mcphail	kargath64	my nforce4 board has "just worked" since breezy
2006-07-27T16:33:00.000Z	kargath64		hmm
2006-07-27T16:34:00.000Z	mcphail	kargath64	i had no probs with ubuntu, but at lot of probs with WinXP wrt networking etc
2006-07-27T16:34:00.000Z	kargath64		wrt?
2006-07-27T16:34:00.000Z	mcphail	kargath64	with regards to
