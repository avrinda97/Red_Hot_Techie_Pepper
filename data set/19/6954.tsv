2008-02-08T23:54:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	thanks!
2008-09-14T06:48:00.000Z	bazhang	hotmonkeyluv	alt f2 emerald --replace
2008-09-14T06:49:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	when I do that, nothing happens
2008-09-14T06:49:00.000Z	bazhang	hotmonkeyluv	then install some themes in the manager (are you in compiz?)
2008-09-14T06:50:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	I'm not able to use compiz with metacity, so I'm trying emerald
2008-09-14T06:51:00.000Z	bazhang	hotmonkeyluv	you dont use compiz with metacity
2008-09-14T06:52:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	yeah, i've noticed... lol
2008-09-14T07:00:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	Jay^ restarting didn't fix anything, and i'm unable to start emerald. I can start metacity though
2008-09-14T07:01:00.000Z	bazhang	hotmonkeyluv	make sure all the emerald packages are installed
2008-09-14T07:01:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	I installed it through synaptic, so they should all be there
2008-09-14T07:02:00.000Z	bazhang	hotmonkeyluv	and compiz is running?
2008-09-14T07:02:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	yeah
2008-09-14T07:05:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	I have no window title bars, can't resize, and can't move windows, but the cube thing works, as do window previews.
2008-09-14T07:06:00.000Z	bazhang	hotmonkeyluv	in ccsm enable move windows plugin
2008-09-14T07:08:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	bazhang	ok, I can now move my windows, and they are wobbly.
