2006-11-09T06:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		anyone fancy helping me fix my edgy upgrade
2006-11-09T06:05:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	i don't know if i can be much help to you
2006-11-09T06:05:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	did you take a backup?
2006-11-09T06:06:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	is there any way you can now? such as create a tar file of your home directory and then copy it to a USB drive or something?
2006-11-09T06:07:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ben_underscore	well there is other such things that I wish to keep that are not in my /home directory
2006-11-09T06:07:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	because i would suggest that and then do a fresh install of ubuntu and then copy your backed up home directory and restore it
2006-11-09T06:07:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	true - there always are
2006-11-09T06:08:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ben_underscore	I have cd-r and dvd+r
2006-11-09T06:08:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ben_underscore	how
2006-11-09T06:09:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	how for what?
2006-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	also make sure you run a md5sum on your TAR file you create and then use that again to compare it to the file after you copy it back and forth so it is exactly the same file
2006-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	you cannot burn DVDs on the comand line :-(
2006-11-09T06:12:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	needs to archive off his files to DVD from the command line so he can do a fresh install of edgy
2006-11-09T06:15:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	and your feisty install is not working off the hard drive? can you boot into safe mode?
2006-11-09T06:16:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	sorry that should have been edgy, not feisty. stupid names!!
2006-11-09T06:18:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ben_underscore	im creating a partition for the edgy live cd download as I do not have my original at hand
2006-11-09T06:19:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	ah.
2006-11-09T06:21:00.000Z	ben_underscore	Paddy_EIRE	my advice is to do nothing until you can get near an external hard drive or vice versa. then archive off all the files you need to the external drive, making sure to take md5sums of each TAR file and checking the files have not been corrupted. then wipe your drive and do a fresh install of edgy. it's a pain but the cleanest approach
2006-11-09T06:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ben_underscore	if this partiton creates properly is it possible to mount my other edgy install and copy my home dir over
