2006-11-29T07:19:00.000Z	synic	strabes	you should remember so I can fix it.
2006-11-29T07:20:00.000Z	strabes	synic	i think it had something to do with fetching album art or something. it didn't want to work
2006-11-29T07:20:00.000Z	strabes	synic	i'm behind a pretty nazi proxy though
2006-11-29T07:21:00.000Z	synic	strabes	ah, yeah, there's currently no proxy support.
2006-11-29T07:21:00.000Z	synic	strabes	er... wait, your proxy blocks amazon?
2006-11-29T07:21:00.000Z	strabes	synic	i dunno
2006-11-29T07:22:00.000Z	strabes	synic	i can go to amazon.com, but exaile isn't fetching the album art =\
2006-11-29T07:22:00.000Z	synic	strabes	hrmm, what does it say for the amazon locale in the advanced prefs?
2006-11-29T07:23:00.000Z	strabes	synic	us
2006-11-29T07:26:00.000Z	synic	strabes	weird.  You're using 0.2.6, right?
2006-11-29T07:26:00.000Z	synic	strabes	what artist/album are you looking for?
2006-11-29T07:26:00.000Z	synic	strabes	does this find them?  http://binary.twi.gs/albums.php
2006-11-29T07:27:00.000Z	strabes	synic	nothing obscure; yes that url finds them
2006-11-29T07:28:00.000Z	synic	strabes	hrmm, it definitely is your proxy then.
2006-11-29T07:28:00.000Z	strabes	synic	bummer
2006-11-29T07:28:00.000Z	synic	strabes	that url uses the same code (basically) to find art
2006-11-29T07:28:00.000Z	strabes	synic	i think everything has to go through port 80 on my proxy
