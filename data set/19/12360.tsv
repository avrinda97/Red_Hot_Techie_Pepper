2007-02-11T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	it's a derivative (fully free) version of Limewire
2007-02-11T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	I imagine it's almost identical
2007-02-11T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	read that page, it gives instructions
2007-02-11T11:33:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
2007-02-27T14:34:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	ubuntu doesn't use the root account, use sudo
2007-02-27T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	what command are you using?
2007-02-27T14:36:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	not su, sudo.  Ubuntu doesnt use the root account, hense, no su
2007-02-27T14:39:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	search for "sun-java"
2007-02-27T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	you need to enable multiverse
2007-02-27T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	L4J	ubotu just sent you a few URLs, use the first one (repositories, not components)
