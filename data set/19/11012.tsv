2006-04-10T07:35:00.000Z	tooleh		:/
2006-04-10T07:35:00.000Z	tooleh		Can anyone see my messages?
2006-04-10T07:36:00.000Z	tooleh		Cool. ETA on some help?
2006-04-10T07:36:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	where does the booting stop?
2006-04-10T07:37:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	what does your xorg log say?
2006-04-10T07:38:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	in the command line: less /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-04-10T07:40:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	that would probably be the easiest
2006-04-10T14:34:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	maybe 
2006-04-10T14:35:00.000Z	tooleh	Seveas	Hi  :)
2006-04-10T14:35:00.000Z	tooleh	Seveas	I have a problem, whenever I load any python XMMS2 clients I get this error: ImportError: No module named xmmsclient
2006-04-10T14:47:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	maybe no one is able to help
2006-04-10T14:48:00.000Z	tooleh	Seveas	Surely someone else here has surround speakers, and likes their music to come out the rear ones?
2006-04-10T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	you'd think... (I'm not that someone though)
2006-04-10T14:49:00.000Z	Seveas	tooleh	ther is the mailing list and the launchpad support pages
