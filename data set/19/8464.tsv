2007-12-02T05:07:00.000Z	mellery		I'm having problems installing java, when I try to run a program i get an exception with java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError, I think i'm missing PATHS but I dont know what I need
2007-12-02T05:07:00.000Z	mellery		can anyone help?
2007-12-02T05:08:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	you need your classpath env variable to contain whatever jar or file you need to run, what program are you trying to run?
2007-12-02T05:09:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	thanks for the reply, its reprap-host.sh
2007-12-02T05:09:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	you can also set the classpath on the java command line with the -cp flag, ussually java programs come with some sort of shell script to start them with the right classpath, where didyou install this from?
2007-12-02T05:10:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	sourceforge
2007-12-02T05:11:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	are you running it from the folder where reprap.jar is>
2007-12-02T05:11:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	?
2007-12-02T05:11:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	yes
2007-12-02T05:12:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	did you install java from the ubuntu package? sun-java5-jre or sun-java6-jre?
2007-12-02T05:12:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	when I type java -cp I get -cp requires class path specification, and I'm using sun-java5-jre from the ubuntu repository
2007-12-02T05:13:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	well in this case the program is only one jar and it's specified in the sh script with -jar on the command line, so defining a classpath isn't your issue in this case
2007-12-02T05:14:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	the script has java -Xmx384M -jar Reprap.jar
2007-12-02T05:15:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	I know, I just downloaded it, so the error is this javax/vecmath/Tuple3d error?
2007-12-02T05:15:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	correct
2007-12-02T05:22:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	yeah that vecmath library is not installed by default in ubuntu, trying to find out how to instlal it now, but I don't know
2007-12-02T05:22:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	thanks, i can find it, I know what the real problem is now. thanks for the help!
2007-12-02T05:23:00.000Z	kelsin	mellery	http://reprap.org/bin/view/Main/RepRapLinuxSoftware this might help
2007-12-02T05:40:00.000Z	mellery	kelsin	I found the java3d.jar file the reprap page links to is really an html file not the real java3d.jar, that will fix my problem
