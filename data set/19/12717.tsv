2005-07-22T07:18:00.000Z	coral		i can't seem to find an ubuntu package for bamboo-dht (.org) anywhere in the various sources i have here.
2005-07-22T07:18:00.000Z	coral		does anyone else know if a package exists?
2005-07-22T07:19:00.000Z	coral		heh
2005-07-22T07:19:00.000Z	coral		ubotu++
2005-07-22T07:20:00.000Z	coral		what's the proper way to request an ubuntu package, knowing that it may be ignored at will?
2005-07-22T07:20:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	what do you mean?
2005-07-22T07:22:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	debian-builder
2005-07-22T07:23:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	you build them. you don't ask people to build them. :)
2005-07-22T07:31:00.000Z	coral	gyaresu	that viewpoint excludes participation in package selection by all who are unable to create packages, which seems sort of not the best
2005-07-22T07:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	yes. pay money. canonical did :)
2005-07-22T07:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	interesting question. i work for 110/hr
2005-07-22T07:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	AU$
2005-07-22T07:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	but i only work on things that interest me :)
2005-07-22T07:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	point is that this damn linux relies on good faith and hobbies.
2005-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	what are you after FMI
2005-07-22T07:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	Distibuted Hash Table?
2005-07-22T07:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	so why can't you just compile from source?
2005-07-22T07:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	and they have a mailing list.
2005-07-22T07:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	coral	there's a sensible answer.
