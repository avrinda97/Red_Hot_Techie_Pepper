2007-10-23T21:36:00.000Z	joerack		Can anybody help me? Totem isn't playing dvds for me but Vlc does
2007-10-23T21:37:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	will it autoplay them? or not at all?
2007-10-23T21:37:00.000Z	joerack		not at all, but Vlc all works
2007-10-23T21:37:00.000Z	joerack	underwatercow	not at all, but Vlc all works
2007-10-23T21:38:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	mine was having trouble playing manually, but would autoplay fine... I installed totem-xine and  that made it work better... I don't know if that would help you or not though... you have libdvdcss2 installed?
2007-10-23T21:38:00.000Z	underwatercow		Xubuntu is also for those who prefer xfce ;-D
2007-10-23T21:38:00.000Z	joerack	underwatercow	installed yep
2007-10-23T21:38:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	I would suggest installing totem-xine and see if that helps...
2007-10-23T21:39:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	it uses xine instead of gstreamer
2007-10-23T21:39:00.000Z	joerack	underwatercow	I will lose gstreamer if I add xine
2007-10-23T21:39:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	it will uninstall automatically... is that a problem? you can always reinstall it too...
2007-10-23T21:40:00.000Z	joerack	underwatercow	I guess other programs can do streaming right
2007-10-23T21:40:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	I have noticed only improvements from using xine... everything else works the same as it did with gstreamer except dvd's play better for me
2007-10-23T21:41:00.000Z	joerack	underwatercow	Ok thanks for help , last question, I also have Kaffeine installed- will kde packaged cause havoc to gnome?
2007-10-23T21:42:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	kde and gnome apps are generally pretty exchangeable... I used Kate and k9burner on gnome with no adverse affects
2007-10-23T21:43:00.000Z	joerack	underwatercow	thx, oh  and as expected... with xine now totem is back
2007-10-23T21:43:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	it worked?
2007-10-23T21:43:00.000Z	joerack		straight on
2007-10-23T21:43:00.000Z	underwatercow	joerack	glad I could help ;-D
