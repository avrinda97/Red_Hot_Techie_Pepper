2010-01-02T00:04:00.000Z	sharpen047		does anyone know how to create an ad-hoc network?
2010-01-02T00:06:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	sudo iwconfig eth1 essid "blah" mode ad-hoc key off freq 2.422G ?
2010-01-02T00:06:00.000Z	sharpen047	mka	ill try that brb
2010-01-02T00:10:00.000Z	sharpen047	mka	line returned with no errors, still no ad-hoc
2010-01-02T00:11:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	what do you want to achieve again, an ad-hoc wireless network between 2 computers?
2010-01-02T00:12:00.000Z	sharpen047	mka	im trying to tether my iphone to my laptop, itunnel doesnt work and i dont have bluetooth so my only other option is wifi, and i cant seem to get adhoc up..
2010-01-02T00:14:00.000Z	sharpen047	mka	ive been looking in on this for about two months now and i know my phone is fine because i tried it on the same computer but on windows xp
2010-01-02T00:14:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	iphone? goodluck!
2010-01-02T00:15:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	the iphone and your cellphone should be in the same subnet
2010-01-02T00:15:00.000Z	sharpen047	mka	lol? all i need to do is create an ad-hoc network on my laptop and i can probably get it from there but it seems like its broken or something
2010-01-02T00:16:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	check the ip address of your iphone and then set that your pc to be very similar to that of your iphone
2010-01-02T00:16:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	how does you iphone get an ip address, can you set it or it has to acquire it form a dhcp server?
2010-01-02T00:17:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	the ideal situation is if you can set you iphone ip address to something like 10.11.12.1 and then your pc to 10.11.12.2
2010-01-02T00:18:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	it does not help for it to see the network, if there is no dhcp server, it will not be  able to connet to it even if you can see it
2010-01-02T00:20:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	?? ok, then that command I have you it's enough
2010-01-02T00:22:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	do as usr13 is suggesting
2010-01-02T00:22:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	sudo iwconfig eth1 essid "blah" mode ad-hoc key off freq 2.422G ?
2010-01-02T00:23:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	maybe remove the key and freq options for now
2010-01-02T00:25:00.000Z	mka	sharpen047	ahhaaaaa, now, how is the iPhone going to detect that static ip address, usr13 ?
