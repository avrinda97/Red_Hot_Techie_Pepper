2009-08-27T00:41:00.000Z	MindVirus		Oh boy.
2009-08-27T00:43:00.000Z	MindVirus		Does anyone know how to disable tap-to-click?
2009-08-27T00:44:00.000Z	MindVirus		And when you remove a package, deps will go too.
2009-08-27T00:44:00.000Z	MindVirus		I like to keep my machine very clean, Zzeiss, and if there is crust I freak.
2009-08-27T00:45:00.000Z	MindVirus		IWFM?
2009-08-27T00:46:00.000Z	MindVirus		Ahh, I see.
2009-08-27T00:48:00.000Z	MindVirus		It supports both, Zzeiss. This driver update made it fail.
2009-08-27T00:49:00.000Z	MindVirus		It's like a freaking conspiracy. Nobody even likes tap-to-click.
2009-08-27T00:50:00.000Z	mneptok	MindVirus	it's quite clear that the NSA and CIA want you using tap-to-click. please go to the front window and smile to the unmarked black van across the street.
2009-08-27T00:50:00.000Z	MindVirus	mneptok	hey, they're using Ubuntu too!
2009-08-27T00:50:00.000Z	mneptok	MindVirus	that's 2 black vans and a helicopter now. quit while you're ahead.

2009-12-28T12:35:00.000Z	mneptok	MindVirus	IOW, let the kernel manage your memory, and stop worrying about it
2009-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	MindVirus	mneptok	Don't assume I don't know what I'm talking about.
2009-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	mneptok	MindVirus	swap helps for systems with low physical memory.
2009-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	mneptok	MindVirus	/etc/security/limits.conf or ulimit
2009-12-28T12:42:00.000Z	MindVirus	mneptok	I mean, these systems run without swapping baseline.
2009-12-28T12:45:00.000Z	mneptok	MindVirus	ps
