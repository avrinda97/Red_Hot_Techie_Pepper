2004-12-30T11:30:00.000Z	vafnord		hi
2004-12-30T11:31:00.000Z	vafnord		while messing around with gnome keyboard shortcuts, i have totally disabled
2004-12-30T11:32:00.000Z	vafnord		my "c" key
2004-12-30T11:34:00.000Z	vafnord		does anyone know where gnome keyboard shortcuts are stored?
2004-12-30T11:35:00.000Z	vafnord		I've looked in ~/.gnome ~/.gnome2 ~/.gconf and I an't find them
2004-12-30T11:36:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	use gconf-editor to search gconf
2004-12-30T11:44:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	Thanks, but I checked there and the binding that are giving me trouble do not appear to be set
2004-12-30T11:45:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	what sort of binding is this?
2004-12-30T11:45:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	I stupidly bound "c" alone as a shortcut and now the key won't work
2004-12-30T11:45:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	hmm, it shouldn't even let you do that
2004-12-30T11:46:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	where did you bind it?
2004-12-30T11:46:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	In "computer -> desktop preferences -> keyboard shortcuts
2004-12-30T11:47:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	and you can't click on it and press delete?
2004-12-30T11:47:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	I did, and according to that dialog those bindings are gone, but the two keys still don't work
2004-12-30T11:48:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	out of interest, have you tried logged out and back in, in case something is jammed up?
2004-12-30T11:49:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	Sure did.  Haven't tried rebooting yet.  Maybe I should try restarting the x server.
2004-12-30T11:49:00.000Z	davyd	vafnord	yeah, I would
2004-12-30T11:49:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	tnx for the ideas
2004-12-30T11:52:00.000Z	vafnord	davyd	Hooray!  Killing gnome-settings-daemon worked.  Thanks so much!
