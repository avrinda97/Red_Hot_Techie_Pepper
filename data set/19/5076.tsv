2009-07-19T16:33:00.000Z	dabaR	krishmish	you would basically have to go to options, ctrl+o, then sound devices or so.
2009-07-19T16:39:00.000Z	krishmish	dabaR	i ve tried but cant make out much
2009-07-19T16:39:00.000Z	dabaR	krishmish	what I do there, is I set the sound in to the first thing, and the sound out and ringing to pulse.
2009-07-19T16:41:00.000Z	dabaR	krishmish	what I do there, is I set the sound in to the first thing, and the sound out and ringing to pulse. Then make a test call.
