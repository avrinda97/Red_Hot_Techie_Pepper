2008-05-27T03:52:00.000Z	DeFirence		when i try and ping an ip, even 127.0.0.1, it replies "segment fault". anyone know why?
2008-05-27T03:54:00.000Z	DeFirence		wtf does segment fault mean?
2008-05-27T03:56:00.000Z	DeFirence		fuck
2008-05-27T03:56:00.000Z	DeFirence		:O
2008-05-27T03:56:00.000Z	DeFirence		oh, sorry kitche
2008-05-27T03:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	yeah, if ping is segfaulting, something really odd is happening
2008-05-27T03:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	can you think of anything that might have caused this to happen?
2008-07-02T00:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	"kill 10873", if that doesn't work "kill -9 10873", possibly with sudo
2008-07-02T00:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	depends on how messed up the app has gotten itself
2008-07-02T00:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	try sudo
2008-07-02T21:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	What exactly are you trying to do?
2008-07-02T21:31:00.000Z	DeFirence	gordonjcp	and joaopinto: i dont want to do anything to do with windows, but i have a working script running under wine, the only problem is it creates a ADODB.Connection object to connect through odbc to a mysql database - I just want it to be able to somehow connect to my mysql database on linux.
2008-07-02T21:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	script running under wine?
2008-07-02T21:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	wine is for running windows binaries...
2008-07-02T21:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	can you just connect to the mysql server?
2008-07-02T21:33:00.000Z	DeFirence	gordonjcp	via what method, i was using odbc connect on windows
2008-07-02T21:33:00.000Z	DeFirence	gordonjcp	i dont know what to use on linuc
2008-07-02T21:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	DeFirence	don't know, I've never used Windows
2008-07-02T21:34:00.000Z	DeFirence	gordonjcp	is there some way i can connect to the mysql database using a object?
