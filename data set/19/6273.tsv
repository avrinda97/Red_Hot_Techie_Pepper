2008-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	how did you delete it?
2008-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	from system / administration / users and groups
2008-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	is he still listed in /etc/passwd?
2008-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	it seems yes
2008-02-15T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	gedit /etc/passwd  and search for him there
2008-02-15T18:31:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	yes, i fount it public:x:1001:1001:,,,,:/home/public:/bin/bash
2008-02-15T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	and he is no longer listed in system -> administration -> users and groups?
2008-02-15T18:32:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	i delete it but when i enter again to users and groups he is listed again as user there
2008-02-15T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	in a terminal, what does 'sudo echo hi' return for you?
2008-02-15T18:33:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	hi
2008-02-15T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	hmm.  Well try using "deluser" to delete the user
2008-02-15T18:39:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	but how to remove user if he is still login in..
2008-02-15T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	hmm, why not just log him out?
2008-02-15T18:40:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	can you tell me how please
2008-02-15T18:40:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	i am not on that user
2008-02-15T18:41:00.000Z	jrib	lxusr	well one way would be to reboot and never login with him.  Or, you can kill all of his processes with: pkill -u public
2008-02-15T18:41:00.000Z	lxusr	jrib	understood,thanks
