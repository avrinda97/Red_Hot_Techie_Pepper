2008-04-08T19:57:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	whats the problem?
2008-04-08T20:00:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	try gnome-volume-properties and enable it
2008-04-08T20:05:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	if you want to auto mount it when u start it there is a daemon running configure it from bash using gnome-volume-properties
2008-04-08T20:06:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	u using Gnome?
2008-04-08T20:08:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	fire up that command in bash then to mount your ntfs partition
2008-04-08T20:08:00.000Z	PookAir	dtolj	now just please say it in english
2008-04-08T20:08:00.000Z	PookAir	dtolj	last time i installed ubuntu it was there and working
2008-04-08T20:09:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	do you know where bash is?
2008-04-08T20:09:00.000Z	PookAir	dtolj	I don't know what it is
2008-04-08T20:11:00.000Z	PookAir	dtolj	i dont know were bash is
2008-04-08T20:13:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	not really but you can call it like that
2008-04-08T20:17:00.000Z	dtolj	PookAir	you dont need to edit /etc/fstab, from gnome-volume-properties check the first 3 options under removable storage.
