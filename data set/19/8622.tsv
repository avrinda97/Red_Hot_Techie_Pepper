2007-03-10T17:24:00.000Z	capicu		in case you cannot boot to graphics mode
2007-03-10T17:26:00.000Z	capicu		Gfree i envy you...i don't know WHY i bought an ati card...it's GARBAGE! man i tell you GARBAGE if you use linux i get beryl to work but it's slow sometimes
2007-03-10T17:26:00.000Z	capicu		best window manager fluxbox :)
2007-03-10T17:27:00.000Z	capicu		fluxbox+gdesklets *thumbsup*
2007-03-10T17:27:00.000Z	capicu		i wonder if you can have compiz and beryl installed simultaneously
2007-03-10T17:27:00.000Z	capicu		anyone know?
2007-03-10T17:28:00.000Z	capicu		you know what's awesome???? LOOKING GLASS!!!!! i give it another 6 months and looking glass is gonna rock!
2007-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	capicu		fiish : do you know if i can have compiz and beryl installed at the same time?
2007-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	capicu		probably not 'cause they probably need different xorg configurations i'm sure
2007-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	yes u can have both installed but u can only run one at any time, they wont run simultaneously
2007-03-10T17:31:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	i used the same xorg.conf for both beryl and compiz
2007-03-10T17:32:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	i had problems with full screen video with beryl, compiz works fine
2007-03-10T17:32:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	if u have a decent video card though, beryl offers more eye-candy
2007-03-10T17:33:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	it is just that the compiz hardware requirements are lot less
2007-03-10T17:35:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	i havent tried fluxbox for a long time, i stuck with gnome for a while now
2007-03-10T17:37:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	good luck , hope it works
2007-03-10T17:43:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	can u enable with Option "Composite" "Enable" or is turned off explicitly within the drivers?
2007-03-10T17:43:00.000Z	Fiish	capicu	u can still do it with installing the AIGLX layer though
