2009-05-01T05:10:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	the issue is that with intrepid there is different ldap setup
2009-05-01T05:11:00.000Z	Gnea	somatt	how so?
2009-05-01T05:12:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	it can't find the slapd.conf even though it's there
2009-05-01T05:12:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	so now with 8 and 9 there is a different way to set up apparently?
2009-05-01T05:13:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	lol i just bombed a job interview because of this today :(
2009-05-01T05:13:00.000Z	Gnea	somatt	oh man... they asked for specifics?
2009-05-01T05:15:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	he calls me on the phone and says here is the server implement ldap
2009-05-01T05:16:00.000Z	Gnea	somatt	and you were using jaunty for a production rollout?
2009-05-01T05:17:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	intrepid vm
2009-05-01T05:18:00.000Z	Gnea	somatt	so you bombed it, found the way to install it in intrepid, and now want to know how to set it up in jaunty?
2009-05-01T05:20:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	no i bombed it in intrepid because that's when the issue starts showing up.  hardy is fine.
2009-05-01T05:24:00.000Z	Gnea	somatt	then you need to create it
2009-05-01T05:25:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	it's there
2009-05-01T05:25:00.000Z	Gnea	somatt	but is it readable to the userid running slapd?
2009-05-01T05:28:00.000Z	somatt	Gnea	-rw-r----- 1 root openldap 4816 2009-04-30 10:55 slapd.conf
