2011-03-24T14:01:00.000Z	_antant		I'm trying to write a script to add all the extra packages I need after install and it's telling me that sudo apt0get update isn't a valid line. any idea why?
2011-03-24T14:01:00.000Z	hateball	_antant	because you typed a 0 instead of - ?
2011-03-24T14:01:00.000Z	hateball	_antant	that is, it's apt-get
2011-03-24T14:02:00.000Z	_antant		you know what i meant. lol
2011-03-24T14:02:00.000Z	hateball	_antant	could you pastebin your script?
2011-03-24T14:02:00.000Z	hateball		!paste | _antant
2011-03-24T14:03:00.000Z	_antant		yeah, hold on a sec
2011-03-24T14:03:00.000Z	hateball		!who | _antant

2011-03-24T14:06:00.000Z	_antant		or just strip students
2011-03-24T14:06:00.000Z	_antant		as long as they're at college of course
2011-03-24T14:07:00.000Z	_antant		why does it have to be a solution?
2011-03-24T14:08:00.000Z	hateball	_antant	thats strange indeed. I always use /bin/bash myself, but for something as simple as that dash should work. I dont have a good idea, I'm afraid :|
2011-03-24T14:10:00.000Z	_antant	hateball	Yeah, it gets stuck at the update bit
2011-03-24T14:11:00.000Z	_antant		anyone else care to have a look?

2011-03-24T14:36:00.000Z	_antant		is it possible to make and install disk from my current install?
2011-03-24T14:36:00.000Z	hateball	_antant	like a clone for backups, or for installing more machines?
2011-03-24T14:38:00.000Z	hateball	_antant	and if you're looking to backup your whole system, I prefer CloneZilla
