2011-05-30T12:33:00.000Z	nincompooop	amin`	your laptop should have some method of "flashing" it in... EG: writing it to a CD, having it on a flash drive, writing it onto a floppy disk
2011-05-30T12:34:00.000Z	amin`	nincompooop	`you mean I do not have to install windows and the install BOIS update software on it?
2011-05-30T12:35:00.000Z	nincompooop	amin`	nope.
2011-05-30T12:35:00.000Z	nincompooop	amin`	there are usually multiple ways to update bios...
2011-05-30T12:35:00.000Z	nincompooop	amin`	try finding some documentation on how to do it outside of windows.
2011-05-30T12:36:00.000Z	nincompooop	amin`	for example, my ATOM motherboard supports doing it in windows, out of a CD, out of a flash drive, booting off of a "special" OS, and "backup mode"
2011-05-30T12:37:00.000Z	amin`	nincompooop	it just says: TWO ways: for windows and ssecond the dos mode for non-windows user..
2011-05-30T12:37:00.000Z	nincompooop	amin`	you can write a CD with DOS in it and write it that way...
