2008-07-24T10:39:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	tried Envy?
2008-07-24T10:40:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	I had done that but was getting a really irritating black strobe thing when I ran stuff. So I tried this fgl something something, the xorg one, and now I can't go past 800X600
2008-07-24T10:41:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	starts in low mode
2008-07-24T10:45:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	if you are on hardy then do sudo apt-get purge xserver-xgl
2008-07-24T10:55:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	I tried that command you sent but how do I get to root? and I had to restart my computer so I need it again please
2008-07-24T10:56:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	sudo apt-get purge xserver-xgl
2008-07-24T10:56:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	that one?
2008-07-24T10:57:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	how do I become root? I am, 8.04 hardy
2008-07-24T10:58:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	using sudo should let you execute as root. try typing "sudo su" and then putting your password in
2008-07-24T10:59:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	said o removed, none installed
2008-07-24T11:00:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	Going to try that envyng again but last time I got flashy strobe issues with the driver it picked
2008-07-24T11:00:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	okay that means it isnt installed then. So you said you tried using EnvyNG and it didnt work out or what?
2008-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	and right now it boots into low graphics mode for some reason
2008-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	ya its probably something that needs to be set in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	is there a way to go back to the original drivers ubuntu came with without reinstalling?
2008-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	google for "xorg.conf nvidia" and find some examples of people putting resolutions and refresh rates in theres and you should be able to add a few and see if works
2008-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	rivitingone	mattchew	ok thanks
2008-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	mattchew	rivitingone	ya you can. I think you could just change your xorg.conf for that too because the original is probably still installed
