2010-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	Cynnamon	fiveiron	You should use chown
2010-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	fiveiron	Cynnamon	just a user folder on a secondary drive
2010-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	fiveiron	Cynnamon	i have. the dir is chowned to the group
2010-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	fiveiron		thats why i dont get it...
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Cynnamon	fiveiron	You trying to write via.....
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Cynnamon		Drag and drop?
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	fiveiron	Cynnamon	touch, cp, etc...
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Cynnamon		Ahhh
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Cynnamon		You must have sudo in front of it!!!
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Cynnamon		Or you can use sudo su
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	fiveiron		why? i'm a member of the group...
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Cynnamon	fiveiron	You should
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	fiveiron		i should have write access by way of permissions
2010-02-11T07:44:00.000Z	Cynnamon	fiveiron	It's usually required, commands like that need sudo
2010-02-11T07:44:00.000Z	fiveiron		....
2010-02-11T07:45:00.000Z	fiveiron		why in the world would copying a file to a directory that is owned by a group that i'm a member of require sudo?
2010-02-11T07:46:00.000Z	fiveiron	Cynnamon	that will obviously work, but i'm wanting to write the files as myself... not root
