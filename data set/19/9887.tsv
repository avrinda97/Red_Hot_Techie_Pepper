2006-10-14T08:00:00.000Z	Lattyware		I finally managed to get Azureus running without killing my machine, but the mimise to notification area fails.
2006-10-14T08:00:00.000Z	Lattyware		Azureus just dissapears, and I have to restart it to get it to work again.
2006-10-14T08:01:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	that's a bug... it's running in the background
2006-10-22T10:39:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	does your router use DHCP? if it does, turn that off
2006-10-22T10:39:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	No, it doesn't.
2006-10-22T10:41:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	have you actually set up your dynamic IP and etc?
2006-10-22T10:43:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	I have a static IP.
2006-10-22T10:55:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	What features are missing from OO.o compared to MSO
2006-10-22T10:56:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	let's see... grammar check, MSO has way more templates, clippy (jk), vb script, etc etc etc
2006-10-22T10:57:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	The grammar check failed miserably, who needs templates? vbscript isn't so major really...
2006-10-22T10:58:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	and if you just compare in speed (MS Office does *NOT* use java)
2006-10-22T10:59:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	For me, they run at the same speed, as under linux, the rest of my system isn't 10x as slow.
2006-10-22T10:59:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	you're blinded by zealousy... ask any professional why he doesn't use OO.o
2006-10-22T11:04:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	why bother with the hacks, if people want to use a crappy browser, let it render crappily too
2006-10-22T11:12:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	I have one.
2006-10-22T11:12:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	and it didn't come with your PC did it?
2006-10-22T11:12:00.000Z	Lattyware	anon32	no.
2006-10-22T11:14:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	but the thing is, most CPUs can decode sound as fast as a dedicated sound card
2006-10-22T11:16:00.000Z	anon32	Lattyware	I find GNOME ugly, it's a matter of taste
