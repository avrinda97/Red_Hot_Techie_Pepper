2008-05-29T22:48:00.000Z	MitchM		is there a good gui for scp?
2008-05-29T22:48:00.000Z	MitchM		I would like to 'right-click' a file and scp it to a server
2008-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	nautilus can handle sftp
2008-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	thanks
2008-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	in english you can use it ocer ssh connection, try look coonec to server from gnome places menu
2008-05-29T22:51:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	codecaine: neither suite my needs, i would like to right-click on a single file... do a 'Send To:' as scp (just type in login/pass/path and done)...
2008-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	that is probably possible with after somecoding, but how about onelines in terminal: scp filename user@somewhere:
2008-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	i do onelines currently.
2008-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	but there should be a simple gui for this.
2008-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	and that sshfs i good idea
2008-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	why ?
2008-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	for a couple hundred servers?
2008-05-29T22:53:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	then do script
2008-05-29T22:54:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	but i have files that change names
2008-05-29T22:54:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	use bash magic
2008-05-29T22:54:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	in different directories, and a script doesn't satisfy my 'dynamic' needs.
2008-05-29T22:54:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	then make perl script
2008-05-29T22:55:00.000Z	MitchM	simplexio	how about i just make a gui for scp?
2008-05-29T22:55:00.000Z	simplexio	MitchM	and that helps ?
