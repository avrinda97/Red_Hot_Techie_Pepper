2010-01-11T20:24:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		hi i have a question
2010-01-11T20:24:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		im a newbie and would like to know if i can install ubuntu on a usb drive?
2010-01-11T20:24:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	yes.. glad to be of service :D
2010-01-11T20:26:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	FiReSTaRT	will ubuntu fit on a 4gb usb drive though?
2010-01-11T20:26:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	easily.. you could even use a 2gb or 1gb drive
2010-01-11T20:28:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	can't help you on that count because i haven't been on dialup since 1998.. i can look up the community wiki for you
2010-01-11T20:28:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto?action=show&redirect=SettingUpModems
2010-01-11T20:28:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	FiReSTaRT	can you just confirm if this is what i do once i install ubuntu and load it up: Open a terminal window and type in:
2010-01-11T20:29:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	that's the right way to install the package, but i'm not sure what gnome-ppp does :)
2010-01-11T20:30:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	if you're following the instructions from a community wiki, you should be set though
2010-01-11T20:30:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	ice_age just answered it :)
2010-01-11T20:32:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	no worries, but i think ice_age was more helpful here.. good luck and get high speed.. the difference is night and day :)
2010-01-11T20:33:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	but if you install gnome-ppp it should also install wvdial as well
2010-01-11T20:34:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	wvdial is available in the repos, but not automatically installed btw :)
2010-01-11T20:35:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	FiReSTaRT	ahhhhhhhhhhh!!! so thats why i couldnt find it when i ran the live cd yesturday! i knew it!
2010-01-11T20:36:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	yeah, you should be able to install them by clicking on system, administration, hardware drivers
2010-01-11T20:37:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	in the repos, not on the cd.. u need to get it to a place with working highspeed internet
2010-01-11T20:37:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	download the drivers and the wvdial/gnome-ppp packages and you should be ready to go dialup
2010-01-11T20:37:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Alf_Stewart	why? unless it's bolted to the floor you should be able to move the comp
