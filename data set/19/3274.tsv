2010-04-06T15:26:00.000Z	trijntje		how can I permanently deny a progarm access to the keyring? Evolution is driving me crazy
2010-04-06T15:26:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	seahorse -> password -> login -> Delete the needed prog
2010-04-06T15:29:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	Told you how to.
2010-04-06T15:31:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	yes, but I dont see the program that triggers the  popup, so i'm waiting for the popup to come back again
2010-04-06T15:32:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	You don't need that. Hit alt+f2, type "seahorse", hit enter, delete evolution from there
2010-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	I dont want to completely block evolution. Its just the popup has "allow once", "denie once" and "allow permanently". I want the "deny permanently" option
2011-08-07T13:31:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	If you have aptitude installed, try using that
2011-08-07T13:31:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	It reports problems in a very descriptive way
2011-08-07T13:32:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	I have aptitude installed, running it now
2011-08-07T13:35:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	this is the output aptitude gives: http://paste.ubuntu.com/660374/
2011-08-07T13:37:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	Huh... wow, this is a mess, I can't make sense of it :(
2011-08-07T13:37:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	Ask someone with a better APT knowledge I guess, sorry.
2011-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	no problem, thanks for your time
2011-08-07T13:46:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	Unfortunately, we can't support derivs
2011-08-07T13:47:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	wols: I know, I was just hoping there would be some apt or dpkg magick known to get me out of this mess
2011-08-07T13:48:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	Unfortunately the channel policy does not allow us to support derivs
2011-08-07T13:50:00.000Z	trijntje	theadmin	wols: I understand. Thanks a lot for you time, I will try the bodhi forum if I cant work it out
2012-08-06T11:37:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	You need any web server. They all are about equally simple to setup, just search for something lightweight (lighttpd?)
2012-08-06T11:39:00.000Z	theadmin	trijntje	Ignore jalexandru. That will only work if you already have a web server installed, and none come on the default Ubuntu setup. Install one first.
