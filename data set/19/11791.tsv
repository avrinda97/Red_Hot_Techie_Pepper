2005-11-20T08:37:00.000Z	guillermito		i've tried installig a debian paakage, manually...
2005-11-20T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	do you have the multiverse repository enabled?
2005-11-20T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	then, what does apt-cache policy msttcorefonts tell you?
2005-11-20T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	then, you're not on the ubuntu box?
2005-11-20T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	the apt-cache policy command above should show a version available like so: 990 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com breezy/multiverse Packages
2005-11-20T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	but what does apt-cache policy say? (if multiverse is not enabled in the right place, you may not see it all)
2005-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	guillermito	nickrud	what soud apt-cache policy should tell me
2005-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	it tells you some details about a package
2005-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	yes
2005-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	don't flood!
2005-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	and, that output means you don't have multiverse enabled properly. Paste your /etc/apt/sources.list on pastebin, and give me the link
2005-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	guillermito	nickrud	http://pastebin.com/430321 there is my sources.list
2005-11-20T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	every line that has universe on it, add multiverse, save the file, and sudo apt-get update. You should see msttcorefonts after that
2005-11-20T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	you missed the two most important places :)
2005-11-20T08:56:00.000Z	guillermito	nickrud	oh thanks a loott I could do it, Thanks
2005-11-20T08:57:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	yw
2005-11-20T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	guillermito	no need to restart X, they should simply show up :)
