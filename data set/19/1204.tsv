2011-04-10T02:40:00.000Z	MrYes		anyone?
2011-04-10T02:42:00.000Z	MrYes		anyone got any ideas for my question?
2011-04-10T02:43:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	What is your question?
2011-04-10T02:44:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	im thinking about running different linux distros off a few 8gb usb memory sticks, is this possible?
2011-04-10T02:44:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	I think it is possible.  I don't think it's every been done.
2011-04-10T02:45:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	If partition the usb stick and use the USB installer for each distro to install to a partition it should work.
2011-04-10T02:47:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	You could also install the multiple distros on the harddrive.  I am more sure that that will work.
2011-04-10T02:49:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	yes i could do that but i aiming to have it in a cage that is connected via usb and i can switch in and out the drives i want to use
2011-04-10T02:49:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	ok. (neat idea :) )  Go for the USB drives.  It might get sort of difficult though.  It's something that is not commonly done and the installers will not be expecting it
2011-04-10T02:51:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	yes i thought of it recently i was thinking having ubuntu and xbmc on seperate usbs and linux mint on another, the data will be all stored on a 500gb hard drive but the apps and os files on the usb stick
2011-04-10T02:52:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	I think it will work :)
2011-04-10T02:53:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	okay :D im just wondering if there would be any corruption using the memory stick
2011-04-10T02:54:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	I think you'll be fine.  The hardest part will be getting them all to install side by side on the same jump drive.  The second hardest part will be grub.  If you can get those two things working everything else will work fine I think.
2011-04-10T02:55:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	im going to be using separate usb sticks for each distro :) no multiple distros on the same stick
2011-04-10T02:56:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	Then it will all work fine :)
2011-04-10T02:56:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	The only thing I noticed is that Red Hat based and Debian based distros don't share a /home well
2011-04-10T02:59:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	thanks for the info i think itll go well now, i have a usb port build in to my wall and its all hooked up to my tv so its gonna be awesome if it works
2011-04-10T02:59:00.000Z	edbian	MrYes	Glad I could help :)  Sounds awesome!
2011-04-10T02:59:00.000Z	MrYes	edbian	ill let you know how it goes :) bye
