2009-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	archman		Can I remove linux-image-2.6.27-13-generic if I am using the newest kernel now?
2009-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	you mean from grub, or the image file itself?
2009-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	the image file, it occupies 100mb...
2009-03-18T18:01:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	If you believe that the new kernel will work without any hiccups, sure.  Just make sure that you remove the entry out of /boot/grub/menu.lst as well to ensure that you dont accidentally try to boot to that image file.
2009-03-18T18:02:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	i think that if i remove the file, it will remove the entry also...So it's secure to remove those files? :)
2009-03-18T18:03:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	yes.  I have removed mine in the past without problems.
2009-03-18T18:03:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	and now that I think of it, I dont remember if I had to remove the entry out of grub.
2009-03-18T18:03:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	ok, thanks! ;)
2009-03-18T18:03:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	np
2009-03-18T18:05:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	linux-headers are safe to remove too?
2009-03-18T18:08:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	it should be safe to remove linux headers, but I have never personally done so, so I cannot vouch for that
2009-03-18T18:10:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	ok, I'm rebooting now.

2009-03-18T18:15:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	everything went smooth, entries removed automatically. I left the last one, just for the case the new doesn't work well ;)
2009-03-18T18:15:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	awesome.  sweet deal
2009-03-18T18:17:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	 found this...  http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2007/10/17/remove-ubuntu-kernels-you-dont-need/
2009-03-18T18:17:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	look at the comment left by bubble
2009-03-18T18:18:00.000Z	unr3a1	archman	and Paddy_EIRE just confirmed it.  removing linux headers is a-ok.
2009-03-18T18:19:00.000Z	archman	unr3a1	Paddy_EIRE, ok :)
