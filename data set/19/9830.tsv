2006-11-05T10:18:00.000Z	knix		can anyone tell me how direct rendering could have got disabled?
2006-11-05T10:18:00.000Z	slavik	knix	upgraded kernel?
2006-11-05T10:18:00.000Z	slavik	knix	module not loaded?
2006-11-05T10:18:00.000Z	knix	slavik	nope, stock edgy kernel, I haven't touched it
2006-11-05T10:19:00.000Z	slavik	knix	make sure the ati/nvidia module from restricted modules does not load ... I forget where to black list it
2006-11-05T10:19:00.000Z	knix	slavik	hrmm I guess that could be it, it's a 945gm chip, not nv/ati
2006-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	slavik	knix	what driver does X use? (check in /etc/X11/xorg.conf)
2006-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	knix	slavik	nope, no nv/ati modules =/
2006-11-05T10:21:00.000Z	knix	slavik	It literally just stopped working, I suddenly noticed I couldn't play video, and then found direct rendering was disabled =/ any ideas?
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	slavik	knix	is i810 is in the xorg.conf?
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	knix	slavik	yes
2006-11-05T10:23:00.000Z	slavik	knix	lsmod | grep i810
2006-11-05T10:24:00.000Z	knix	slavik	bah, wasn't loaded, sec trynig now
2006-11-05T10:24:00.000Z	knix	slavik	still no direct rendering =/
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	slavik	knix	restart X ;)
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	slavik	knix	also, do 'sudo depmod'
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	knix	slavik	I did :P I think the reason I didn't see it loaded was because X wasn't running, hehe
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	knix	slavik	agpgart and everything are enabled, drm is loaded as well, and has i810 listed as a dep
2006-11-05T10:27:00.000Z	knix	slavik	it's using Mesa GLX Indirect, I'm pretty sure it wasn't using that before
