2005-01-14T13:03:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	nvidia-glx? or Xorg?
2005-01-14T13:04:00.000Z	daniels	Lin	xorg, but the only thing it's broken with is loading nvidia-glx
2005-01-14T13:04:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	using debian (official) nvidia-glx should help?
2005-01-14T13:05:00.000Z	daniels	Lin	no.
2005-01-14T13:05:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	to the hell!! :-(

2005-01-14T13:09:00.000Z	daniels	Lin	no, no matter which version of nvidia-glx you install, it will be broken, until you try the workaround.
2005-01-14T13:25:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	the ln solution didn't work here :-(
2005-01-14T13:26:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	I didn't have restricted-modules package installed (I compile nvidia drivers by myself)
2005-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	now I solved it.. GLX didn't work with composite module loaded (but worked in the past).
2005-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	Lin	daniels	thank you for help! :-D
