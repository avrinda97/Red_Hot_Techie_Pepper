2007-11-19T03:38:00.000Z	newbie_		my computer freezes, the fan speeds up and the screen goes black when I reboot my laptop on ubuntu 7.10. I installed it yesterday, and I just noticed this problem today. Has someone experienced this problem, or is familiarized with it?
2007-11-19T03:39:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	some laptops behave strangely due to ACPI problems. Suggestion: look up your model on tuxmobil.org and see if other people have installed Ubuntu (or other distributions) on it
2007-11-19T03:40:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	thanks!
2008-03-27T21:58:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	Hold down Ctrl-Shift and press u followed by the code
2008-03-27T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	got it?
2008-03-27T22:00:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	ok, I got it, but the number is not the same as in windows, where can I get a ascii table with the codes?
2008-03-27T22:02:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	it's Unicode
2008-03-27T22:03:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	Pici, ok, thanks
2008-03-27T22:07:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	try 00F1
2008-03-27T22:09:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	Pici, eth01, thank you
2008-05-09T20:33:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	I was about to buy a device for a similar purpose, called Griffin iMic. It gets good reviews and has Linux support, but I never found out whether that support extends to stereo input
2008-05-09T20:33:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	in the end I didn't pursue the project. But the iMic may be an option for you.
2008-05-09T20:34:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	I'll check it, Thanks! :)
2008-05-09T20:35:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	do you have any idea on which software can I use to edit video and record it on DVDs which can be played back on any DVD player?
2008-05-09T20:36:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	there is a package called dvdauthor for DVD creation. For editing, I've heard of cinelerra and kino. Never tried any of those myself.
2008-05-09T20:37:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	btw, just found a customer review on Amazon saying "Exellent item - provides full stereo input in Linux" [sic] about the iMic
2008-05-09T20:38:00.000Z	soundray	newbie_	maybe I'll revive my little project -- thanks for reminding me :)
2008-05-09T20:38:00.000Z	newbie_	soundray	thanks for helping me with this dude ;)
