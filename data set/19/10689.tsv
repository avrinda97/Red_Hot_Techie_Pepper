2006-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	MilesTormani		(For the record, I'm on Ubuntu.)
2006-05-25T11:12:00.000Z	MilesTormani		Heylo.
2006-05-25T11:14:00.000Z	MilesTormani		Indeed.
2006-05-25T11:14:00.000Z	MilesTormani		What are you doing?
2006-05-25T11:16:00.000Z	MilesTormani		I think if you use Wine to run the Windows version of Quicktime, that /could/ work. However, Wine's kinda... unstable, so.
2006-05-25T11:17:00.000Z	MilesTormani		So could someone tell me why Terminal's not seeing this directory, even if I tell it to open from that directory's location?
2006-05-25T11:18:00.000Z	MilesTormani		I'm staring at it on my desktop, so, yes.
2006-05-25T11:18:00.000Z	MilesTormani		I'll try that now.
2006-05-25T11:19:00.000Z	MilesTormani		Realized that recently. ^^;
2006-05-25T11:20:00.000Z	MilesTormani		Yeah, but I probably should use sudo or something. ^^;
2006-05-25T11:20:00.000Z	elkbuntu	MilesTormani	you should only use sudo when it tells you that you cannot do something otherwise, and even then, weigh up the possible complications
2006-05-25T11:21:00.000Z	MilesTormani	elkbuntu	I'm trying to get this to install system-wide, so as to not have multiple installations of it.
2006-05-25T11:21:00.000Z	elkbuntu	MilesTormani	this = ubuntu?
2006-05-25T11:22:00.000Z	MilesTormani	elkbuntu	Flash Player 7.
2006-05-25T11:22:00.000Z	elkbuntu	MilesTormani	um. i'm not sure you can
2006-05-25T11:23:00.000Z	elkbuntu	MilesTormani	because theoretically, each user on a linux box may have different preferences
2006-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	MilesTormani	elkbuntu	This is my own personal computer, so I'm not too worried about everyone's preferences.
2006-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	elkbuntu	MilesTormani	very few programs come with a 'dictator' option ;)
2006-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	MilesTormani	elkbuntu	I worry about that when I actually start sharing this computer, which is unlikely. :P
