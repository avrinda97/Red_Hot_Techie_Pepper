2009-12-28T06:52:00.000Z	smash190		hello everyone. i was having trouble running fsck on 9.10. i unmounted the drive i wanted to check, which is my only hd, but fsck still says that it is mounted
2009-12-28T06:52:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 You can't access fsck from the single-user menu, anymore.
2009-12-28T06:52:00.000Z	smash190	Firefishe	then what should i do?
2009-12-28T06:53:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 If you want to run an fsck you have do:  touch /forcefsck    then reboot.  (Please correct me if this is wrong, people.
2009-12-28T06:53:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 That's how I had to do it on my laptop running 9.10.
2009-12-28T06:54:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 There's an entire thread dedicated to this somewhere, which where I got the general info.  I got the command advice here,though.
2009-12-28T06:54:00.000Z	smash190	Firefishe	thanks, i am giving it a try now then. it seems as if it is working. thanks a bunch
2009-12-28T06:54:00.000Z	Firefishe		You're welcome.
2009-12-28T06:54:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 I hope it works for you.  Either that, or you'd have to do fsck from a live cd.
2009-12-28T06:55:00.000Z	smash190	Firefishe	i think it worked, but it didn't correct any hd errors it seems. the "
2009-12-28T06:55:00.000Z	smash190		palimpsest disk util" says that I have many bad sectors...
2009-12-28T06:56:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 hmmm.  If it's a new install, perhaps you should re-partition *manually*, then install again.
2009-12-28T06:56:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 that, or you have a bad h/d
2009-12-28T06:57:00.000Z	smash190	Firefishe	it is indeed a new install. i will go ahead and reinstall. what could have caused this? something with the installer?
2009-12-28T06:58:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 It's hard to say.  Tell me, how new is your system?  Also, what kind of hardware (cpu and type of h/d)?
2009-12-28T06:59:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 If you need assistance, I will be happy to help you--in my limited capacity--with the install, if you wish.
2009-12-28T07:00:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 just a sec...wife came home, have to cuddle ;)
2009-12-28T07:00:00.000Z	smash190	Firefishe	it seems as if it is a bug maybe: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libatasmart/+bug/438136
2009-12-28T07:04:00.000Z	Firefishe	smash190	 I have to switch machines, wife wants this one.
