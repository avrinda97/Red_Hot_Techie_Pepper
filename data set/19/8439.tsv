2007-04-24T07:32:00.000Z	Acidz0r		Hi, anyones knows when is fiesty for ppc gonna be available?
2007-04-24T07:34:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	I thought it already was---if you've already got edgy, try going to the update manager and seeing if there's a note about it there. Don't try installing it from there, though, the official servers are way too busy. Use a Torrent if you can.
2007-04-24T07:36:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	I've check almost all US mirrors and the iso is still missing, I don't have Edgy to check from there and I haven't find a torrent of fiesty-ppc.
2007-04-24T07:38:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	Crap. I am running Edgy PPC, and I did see a note like that, but I haven't tried upgrading. Maybe try searching the Apple PPC Users forum?
2007-04-24T07:39:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	Oh, lemme check then. You running it on a laptop?
2007-04-24T07:40:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	PowerBook G4.
2007-04-24T07:40:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	any troubles getting airport to work with Ubuntu? cuz I have an iBook and the LiveCD doesn't detect the airport card.
2007-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	Hoo boy . . . getting AirPort working is NOT fun, but it can be done---not from a LiveCD, though. You'll have to install Ubuntu first.
2007-04-24T07:43:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	Meh, sounds like.. fun, hehe.
2007-04-24T07:43:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	Hang on, I'll dig up the how-to I used. I recommend installing Edgy, because I can't promise it'll work on Feisty.
2007-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=411442 , they moved the mirrors of fiesty, no wonder.
2007-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	Oh, and if you're booting from the LiveCD now, can you pull up a terminal, type in "lspci" without the quotes, and tell me if there are any lines with the words "Network Controller" in them, and if so, what do they say, exactly?
2007-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	lemme check then, gimme a sec.
2007-04-24T07:57:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	it's either a Broadcom 4318 (rev 02) or the UniNorth 2 GMAC (Sun GEM) (rev 80).
2007-04-24T08:01:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	Okay, it's probably the Broadcom. Try following the instructions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=319402 and here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2177737&postcount=9
2007-04-24T08:03:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	Oh yes---good luck . . .
2007-04-24T08:05:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	hehe, thanks. Forgot to ask you, yours came with ATi? >_<; Cuz I already know that getting ATi cards to work is a pain, hehe.
2007-04-24T08:06:00.000Z	jiminy	Acidz0r	nVidia, though I haven't tried anything fancy with it. Both have problems, from what I hear.
2007-04-24T08:06:00.000Z	Acidz0r	jiminy	Oh, okay. O_o;
