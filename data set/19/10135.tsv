2010-06-30T20:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	I just joined, whats the problem?  also Linux is just the kernel,  so you mean Ubuntu doesn't
2010-06-30T20:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	also you probably mean  the Grub bootloader can't boot Windows
2010-06-30T20:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	10.04?
2010-06-30T20:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	Are you using Ubuntu 10.04 ?
2010-06-30T20:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	Is 10.04 installed?
2010-06-30T20:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	yeah,  and neither Windows or Ubuntu will boot up?
2010-06-30T20:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	I thought you said neither will boot up?
2010-06-30T20:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nermal	well I wasn't here at the begining when you started saying stuff
