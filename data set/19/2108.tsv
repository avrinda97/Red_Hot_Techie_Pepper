2010-06-28T05:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	yes
2010-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	gene234	sebsebseb	as long as my email address wont get spamed now
2010-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	only Freenode staff have access to your Freenode account details
2010-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	well email address as far as I know, and password no
2010-06-28T05:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	you can ask in #freenode if your wondering about stuff like that
2010-06-28T06:02:00.000Z	gene234	sebsebseb	if I get spamed I hold you responsible
2010-06-28T06:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	that was a joke I assume :D   anyway not my fault, you joined the network and gave network staff  your email address,  well I think they can see it
2010-06-28T06:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	and I didn't tell you to join, so yep not my fault :)
2010-06-28T06:04:00.000Z	gene234	sebsebseb	joining a open room usually does not require an email address unless your company is harvesting them
2010-06-28T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	uhmm join #freenode and ask why they need an email address, in fact I can tell you right now
2010-06-28T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	heres the reason they want your email address or one of them
2010-06-28T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	if you forgot your password for the account, they can email you the thing so you can re set it
2010-06-28T06:06:00.000Z	gene234	sebsebseb	reset my password ???
2010-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	gene234	sebsebseb	reset my password ???
2010-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	you can for your freenode account,  since you provided an email address
2010-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	you can go into #freenode and say you want password re set, and they email you the thing for that
2010-06-28T06:14:00.000Z	gene234	sebsebseb	ok np
2010-06-28T06:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gene234	or pm a freenode staff directly.  anyway as I told you before you can join #freenode to find out how things work with accounts
