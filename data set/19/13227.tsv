2005-04-27T12:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		blackbox is very very minimal fast and gives you the same functionality as gnome
2005-04-27T12:48:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		the menu will be in /usr/local/share/blackbox/menu
2005-04-27T12:48:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		fluxbox got a stupid default font heh
2005-04-27T12:49:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		then everything that will go to var will be on the other partion
2005-04-27T12:49:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		tho if you dont config /etc/fstab afterwards you will get shit on reboot
2005-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		ppl, compile from source damnit, screw packages..
2005-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		you can compile shit youself with -O3 --march you DO NOT want packages..
2005-04-27T12:53:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		and now i need someone running a 64bit natve os to compile me a kernel for ubuntu
2005-04-27T12:54:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		well if ubuntu developers would create more kernels and spend less time on packages more ppl will be able ro run the os...
2005-04-27T12:54:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		3 kernels to chose from during an install with no indication of what they do aint a good thing..
2005-04-27T12:54:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	what are you smoking and or drinking?
2005-10-07T15:41:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	to you it does, sure.
2005-10-07T15:42:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	that's great.
2005-10-07T15:43:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	for some people maybe.
2005-10-07T15:44:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	and why is that?
2005-10-07T15:45:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	chavo	: there are better determinants, like scheduler used in the default kernel.
2005-10-07T15:45:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	if everyone was just like you, what a sad  World this would be. not that there's anything wrong with you.
2005-10-07T15:45:00.000Z	chavo	lsuactiafner	to some people that means absolutley n\othing.
2005-10-07T15:46:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	chavo	: whenever i boot a pc i dont sit and wait for the splash sreen, thats just a waste of time, if you're promoting a new product a splash screen shouldnt be its best new feature
