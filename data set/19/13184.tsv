2005-09-06T07:46:00.000Z	selinium		Quick question, if I am logged in by ssh and I issue a shutdown message, will that shutdown the remote machine? That or I have to go to the office a check someone hasn't run off with my server!
2005-09-06T07:47:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	when logged in, all commands are run on the machine you are logged in on
2005-09-06T07:49:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	I here you are being made up to 'op' :)
2005-09-06T07:49:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	if you ssh into a box and shut YOUR machine down, the connection is lost and nothing happens on the other box
2005-09-06T07:49:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	that's what i hear, too
2005-09-06T07:50:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	Are you sure? Only I can dial into the router fine, it just says there are no computers attached to it.
2005-09-06T07:52:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	thoreauptuic has been made up as well!
2005-09-07T16:01:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	After checking both systems, it seems that when I shut down my local machine it did send the shutdown signal to my remote server as well. Had to pop into the office and start the machine.
2005-09-07T05:48:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	ln -s
2005-09-07T05:50:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	you issued the "shutdown" command on your box, and the other machine went down, too?
2005-09-07T05:50:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	yep, i had to drive to the office to restart it.
2005-09-07T05:50:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	you got major security problems, then
2005-09-07T05:51:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	both machines have the same user:password ie me
2005-09-07T05:51:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	doestn matter. the machine you're logged into should ignore any commands passed to your local machine
2005-09-07T05:52:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	I havent done anything strange? I set up a shared key, would that have had any affect?
2005-09-07T05:53:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	the remote machine should only obey commands you pass to it in its ssh session
2005-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	I understand what you are saying. I am just trying to find out why :)
2005-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	Nalioth	selinium	yes, we want to know
2005-09-07T05:56:00.000Z	selinium	Nalioth	I just went through the standard system/log out/shutdown on my local machine. But i had ssh open and nautilus both locally and remote open. In the keyring.
