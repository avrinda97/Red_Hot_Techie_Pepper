2008-02-24T16:01:00.000Z	Andycass1		Where can i see the pureftpd start script?
2008-02-24T16:01:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	in /etc/init.d probably
2008-02-24T16:02:00.000Z	Andycass1	m8ram	/etc/init.d/pure-ftpd is a empty file, though i can restart/stop/start it from command line??
2008-02-24T16:02:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	you can also check the output of dpkg -L pureftpd
2008-02-24T16:03:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	seems strange that it would be empty
2008-02-24T16:04:00.000Z	Andycass1	m8ram	it displays the same /etc/init.d/pure-ftpd path.
2008-02-24T16:05:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	perhaps you should reinstall the package?  init files shouldn't be empty
2008-02-24T16:06:00.000Z	Andycass1	m8ram	uhm, it seems that i cant use the stop/start arguments on it either, im thinking its using some other way to start
2008-02-24T16:07:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	if it's empty it can't do anything, that's why I'm suspecting it's corrupt...
2008-02-24T16:10:00.000Z	Andycass1	m8ram	It does not use init.d to launch itself, it is running fine - just have to figure out where does it launch from
2008-02-24T16:12:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	I just installed pure-ftpd on this system and the init script is far from empty: wc -l /etc/init.d/pure-ftpd
2008-02-24T16:12:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	and I can't think of a way (other than manually starting) how it could be running after a reboot without an init script...
2008-02-24T16:13:00.000Z	Andycass1	m8ram	it would take me another day to set up virtual users, i think ill rather find it by hand
2008-02-24T16:13:00.000Z	Andycass1	m8ram	reinstall is not always the best option :P
2008-02-24T16:14:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	??? I don't know pure-ftpd but I guess you could move the file/db whatever that holds the users and restore it after reinstalling?  I agree that reinstalling isn't the best solution but it looks like your installation is corrupt
2008-02-24T16:15:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	another option would be to replace the init script with a working version: but if you don't know how it got corrupt in the first place there might be other files missing...
2008-02-24T16:15:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	perhaps the disk was filled at some point?
2008-02-24T16:18:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	you might also want to install debsums and see if other files are corrupt...
2008-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	m8ram	Andycass1	if you enabled bootlod in /etc/default/bootlogd you should also get the output in /var/log/boot.log
