2007-07-24T07:33:00.000Z	HHP2K		Hey guys, I have a rather urgent problem.. I was playing around with different themes for GDM and one of them was broken, so now it's not displaying the login screen correctly. I tried to access gdm.conf in etc/gdm to enable automatic login and bypass that, but it's telling me that gdm.conf doesn't exist. Help? :(
2007-07-24T07:34:00.000Z	HHP2K		So does anyone know where my gdm.conf file is or how to revert the GDM back ot its defaults?
2007-07-24T07:35:00.000Z	spikeb	HHP2K	/etc/factory-gdm.conf can be copied to /etc/gdm.conf i would imagine
2007-07-24T07:35:00.000Z	HHP2K	spikeb	I'll try that, thanks
2007-07-24T07:36:00.000Z	spikeb	HHP2K	you're welcome. i hope it works.
2007-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	HHP2K	spikeb	"cp etc/factory-gdm.conf etc/gdm" doesn't work, am I doing that wrong?
2007-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	spikeb	HHP2K	you need to write "cp /etc/factory-gdm.conf /etc/gdm.conf"
2007-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	HHP2K		oh, okay
2007-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	spikeb	HHP2K	missing the leading /
2007-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	HHP2K		thanks again :) I make that mistake sometimes
2007-07-24T07:39:00.000Z	spikeb	HHP2K	not a problem
2007-07-24T07:40:00.000Z	HHP2K		I've heard of that disastrous little command before :P
2007-07-24T07:40:00.000Z	HHP2K	spikeb	That didn't work either. :( Double triple checked for typos
2007-07-24T07:40:00.000Z	spikeb		hmm
2007-07-24T07:41:00.000Z	spikeb		well that was my bright idea, not sure what else to do HHP2K
2007-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	HHP2K		Oh, I found it..
2007-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	HHP2K		factory-gdm was in etc/gdm/
2007-07-24T07:43:00.000Z	spikeb		oh for crying out loud, i can't read
2007-07-24T07:43:00.000Z	spikeb	HHP2K	sorry.
