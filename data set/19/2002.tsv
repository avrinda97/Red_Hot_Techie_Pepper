2010-08-06T08:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	lubuser	maco I have changed from usb 2.0 to 1.0 before you can disable 2.0 I don't recall how I did it.  it made my wifi work all the time in 1.0 and crashed intermitent in 2.0 usb .  this was a via driver problem
2010-08-06T08:15:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	oh?  I'm not sure how, though
2010-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	 the usb 2 port no longer works but not sure how to disable ehci_hcd driver from trying to use it?
2010-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	lubuser	maco: usb 1.0 works ok it's just slower.  if you use it hooked to a hard disk I guess you will need 2.0
2010-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	lubuser		the module is now in the kernel?  so, when I try to remove the module, there's a fatal error?
2010-08-06T08:17:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	 yes, usb 1.0 and 1.1 works but the prob is the drive is usb 2 but the usb driver is not switching to the lower speed in order to mount the drive
2010-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	 that's how I understand it, anyway... not sure if it's right...but, my point is, in Debian, it will drop down to usb 1.1 (or 1.0?) and mount if I do it manually
2010-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	lubuser		the drive becomes detected and I often have to mount manually
2010-08-06T08:20:00.000Z	lubuser		but, some instances if I turn it on during boot up, it mounts automatically ... but, i tested this and it's not consistent... not sure what conditions I need... frustrating
2010-08-06T08:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	lubuser	oh ok then no use trying to keep usb 1.0 working.  lspci and see if he uses via chips in his usb stuf.  I'm not sure they ever fixed.  oh then maybe I should give you the comand I used to manualy change to usb 1.0
2010-08-06T08:21:00.000Z	lubuser		$ lspci -> pastebin

2010-08-06T08:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	lubuser	this comand forces to use usb 1.0 or did back when I used ubuntu 7.X modprobe -r ehci_hcd

2010-08-06T08:24:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	 that doesn't work in ubuntu anymore...at least, not 10.04
2010-08-06T08:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	lubuser	ok sorry that's all I got
2010-08-06T08:25:00.000Z	lubuser		FATAL: Module ehci_hcd not found.
2010-08-06T08:25:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	 that's what I get when I try that command.
2010-08-06T08:25:00.000Z	lubuser	sacarlson	 no problem... ubuntu devs will look at it or not... my laptop has problems... :)
