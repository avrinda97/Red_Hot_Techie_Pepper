2011-10-01T04:05:00.000Z	jclbrt		i know both of those
2011-10-01T04:05:00.000Z	jclbrt		also what config files do i need to edit for that
2011-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	jclbrt		huh? lol...
2011-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	jclbrt		ok now i am really lost
2011-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	jclbrt		what do u mean run route?
2011-10-01T04:08:00.000Z	jclbrt		i have a windows client connected to ETH1 (where it's getting DHCP) and ETH0 is connected to my modem
2011-10-01T04:08:00.000Z	jclbrt		my Windows PC is indeed able to ping the server but unable to ssh to the server, or even get on the internet
2011-10-01T04:08:00.000Z	jclbrt		from the server (running ubuntu) i am able to ping my PC client by IP, and also able to ping the internet
2011-10-01T04:09:00.000Z	jclbrt		what I dont understand is what you mean by setting up the routes or even how to compare the routes between the two machines
2011-10-01T04:09:00.000Z	jclbrt		forgive me if the questions is pretty elementary but i've never set ubuntu up at the head of a network (I.E. as the DHCP server)
2011-10-01T04:09:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 yes i think it does
2011-10-01T04:11:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 the uuid?
2011-10-01T04:13:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 yeah my bad
2011-10-01T04:14:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 i guess its better than no article s:D
2011-10-01T04:17:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 what was ActionParsnip 's method?
2011-10-01T04:19:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 we're trying to see if the routing issue is related to iptables or something else
2011-10-01T04:19:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 in that case the gateway is your modem
2011-10-01T04:22:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 also an iptables channel might be better for you, think it redirects to #netfolder
2011-10-01T04:27:00.000Z	Fudge	jclbrt	 you can use pastebinit like /exec cat filename | pastebinit to get the link directly in many irc clients
