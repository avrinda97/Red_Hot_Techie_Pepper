2010-11-10T12:12:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		I was wondering if there are any programs for ubuntu that i can see all ips that connect to me and disconnect from them if needed, I want to use to kick people from my game whenever some1 hacked joins it.   TY!
2010-11-10T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	do you mean connect to the pc itself?
2010-11-10T12:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	if you are the server you can kick whom you wish, its built into the game
2010-11-15T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	use your backups
2010-11-15T00:17:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	ActionParsnip	the backup is encrypted using ecryptfs...
2010-11-15T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	ok having a backup is good.

2010-11-15T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	this is why encrypted filesystems suck and I personally don't advise them. Too much heartache and effort
2010-11-15T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	sure, use the link I gave
2010-11-15T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	then make your username so you can su to it
2010-11-15T00:24:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	ActionParsnip	You don't get it, I don't have my old installation, just the encrypted files from my old home directory, I am logged in as my new username.
2010-11-15T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	then make a username the same as your old username and you should be ok, surely?
2011-11-19T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	what errors do you get?
2011-11-19T06:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	can you pastebin the command and all outpuuted text, thanks
2011-11-24T21:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	can just install lxde, the apps installed will run fine in XFCE ;)
2012-01-12T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	it will degrade quality
2012-01-12T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	converting from a lossy format to another lossy format will reduce quality
2012-01-21T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	do they make events in xev?
2012-01-21T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ubuntunoob	in keyboard settings, click on the volume up entry then press your shortcut
