2011-07-15T01:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!adeptfix
2011-07-15T01:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	thanks!
2011-07-15T01:07:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	Northernen the factoid !aptlock works as well
2011-09-11T18:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	I haven't heard of tovid before (it's not a debian package, but I might try it out sometime), thanks.
2012-06-29T21:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	 usually i just go into  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ and delete the ppas there , just to make sure
2012-06-29T21:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	if you have package installed from the PPA - that's a bad idea
2012-06-29T21:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	yes agreed , but of course I would have removed the package already
2012-07-12T21:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	that was my concern as well
2012-07-24T01:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	but no 3d on others :(  like my 8800.  univac
2012-07-24T01:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	really ?, that's odd , my other pc used the nouveau driver with an 8400gs with 3D and Dir
2012-07-24T01:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	i've never seen nouveau fail in 2d mode, but for 3d the list of supported cards is very short right now
2012-07-24T01:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	right , I ended up installing nvidia-current on both just to be sure
2012-07-24T01:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	router in that situation is typically so much easier
2012-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	if you want to share dsl/cable (unless you purchase multiple IPs) a router is basically "required" IMO
2012-07-24T01:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	setup satic IPs in the interfaves file might work , altho I've never tried it with a hub
2012-07-24T01:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	if you connect your "internet" to a hub, each connected device needs to have a valid IP from your ISP's network :(  (unless you use a single computer as teh router and to ICS or something - but a router is probably faster)
2012-09-04T17:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	BluesKaj	sidenote - flac being free means it SHOULDN'T be in "restricted" extras (i'm not saying it isn't, just that it shouldn't be)
2012-09-04T17:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	yeah agreed , it usually comes embeddied with a "player"
2012-09-24T19:12:00.000Z	BluesKaj	zykotick9	try the manual option , conmtinue
