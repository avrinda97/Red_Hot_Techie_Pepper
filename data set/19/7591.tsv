2007-09-08T06:55:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	What is the exact command you are putting into the terminal?
2007-09-08T06:55:00.000Z	CountX	MrObvious	sudo mount -a
2007-09-08T06:56:00.000Z	CountX	MrObvious	ive edited fstab to mount only one of my drivers
2007-09-08T06:57:00.000Z	CountX	MrObvious	"/dev/sda1 /media/windows/c ntfs marcel,fmask=0111,dmask=0000 0 0"
2007-09-08T06:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	Of course I have ntfs-3g installed lol.
2007-09-08T06:59:00.000Z	CountX	MrObvious	how do i add the ro, read only, oprtion to the fstab line?
2007-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	Google is what I'd suggest lol.
2007-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	CountX	MrObvious	i cant find anything
2007-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	Try googling ntfs fstab
2007-09-08T07:03:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	There is a way to force it to mount with 3g if "corrupted" and you know for sure it's not especially if you just had an unclean shutdown.
2007-09-08T07:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	Good.
2008-01-21T22:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	Say it, don't spray it.
2008-01-21T22:13:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	Try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade if you can get to a terminal and see if that fixes it.
2008-01-21T22:13:00.000Z	CountX	MrObvious	and no terminal access at the time
2008-01-21T22:14:00.000Z	MrObvious	CountX	There should be a failsafe option on booting from Grub I think when you push ESC. It should load a root terminal then. What exactly is the error?
