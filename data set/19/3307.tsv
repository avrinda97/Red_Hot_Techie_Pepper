2009-09-15T13:07:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw		i try to chroot direectory and i get "chroot: cannot change root directory to edit: No such file or directory", what to do
2009-09-15T13:07:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw		chroot: cannot run command `/bin/bash': No such file or directory
2009-09-15T13:09:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	you'll get that if there is no /<dir you chroot to>/bin/bash
2009-09-15T13:10:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	it exists, i try to chroot /mnt and exists, i am running from live CD, try to repair grub
2009-09-15T13:13:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	That is odd, maybe you really dont have bash in there? Have you tried /bin/sh?
2009-09-15T13:13:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	how do i try /bin/sh
2009-09-15T13:14:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	chroot /mnt /bin/sh
2009-09-15T13:15:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	doesent wotk, and both exists in /bin, bash and sh
2009-09-15T13:16:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	/mnt/bin/bash or /mnt/bin/sh has to exist.
2009-09-15T13:16:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	they do
2009-09-15T13:17:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	i am doing this: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide  commands on the bottom
2009-09-15T13:18:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	but cant do step 4 because of that
2009-09-15T13:21:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	I find it odd that its not working for you. Other things that can give you hassles is there are permission errors, or you're using a Live CD that is 32bit when your system is 64bit (or vice versa)--but those would give different errors than you've posted
2009-09-15T13:22:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	maybe  thats it, i am having 32bit cd and 64bit system
2009-09-15T13:23:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	try to run /mnt/bin/bash directly
2009-09-15T13:23:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	bash: /mnt/ubuntu/bin/bash: cannot execute binary file
2009-09-15T13:24:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	but yeah, you'll definately need the same Live CD as your system. It MIGHT work if your Live CD was 64-bit and your system is 32-bit... but I've never tried it.
2009-09-15T13:24:00.000Z	tnoy	qwqwqqwqw	yeah, thats your problem then.
2009-09-15T13:24:00.000Z	qwqwqqwqw	tnoy	ook, will be back if something wont work, tnx
