You'll need a special device, I'd guess (/dev/...) Also edit /etc/fstab according to the values you use to mount it manually. Hope this helps...
2007-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	I know how to mount the flash drive but it has 2 partitions and I only want to mount 1 of the partitions
2007-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	what command are you using? If it's a one-line, type it here...
2007-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	see that is what I do not know.. mount /dev/sdb1??? /mnt
2007-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	the partition is setup as /dev/sdb1p1
2007-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	the partition is setup as sdb1p1
2007-04-28T08:22:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	see sdb1 has 2 partitions
2007-04-28T08:23:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	try "mount -t ext2  /dev/sdb1p1 /my_flash" - "/my_flash_1" is an empty directory, change the name to something you like better
2007-04-28T08:24:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	it tells me sdb1p1 does not exist
2007-04-28T08:24:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	/dev/sdb1p1 --- is there a /dev/sdb1p2 ?
2007-04-28T08:25:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	no should I reinsert flash drive?
2007-04-28T08:25:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	oh, you have to create these devices. No need to touch your flash. Your problem is in /dev... You need to create that /dev/...
2007-04-28T08:26:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	ok how?
2007-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	 you have the /dev/MAKEDEV tool for that. Not sure I recall how to use it. I wonder if ubuntu has some tool to do the same. Anyone ??
2007-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	yeah I could not even set the partition to ext2 yet
2007-04-28T08:28:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	'ext2' is not a partivion. It's a partition 'type' used by linux filesystem.
2007-04-28T08:29:00.000Z	JROCK2004	hoth676	that still did not work
2007-04-28T08:31:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	googling for MAKEDEV would give you better help than I. At least you know where your problem is: not your flash, just configuring your linux. see http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl8_MAKEDEV.htm   for example.
2007-04-28T08:39:00.000Z	hoth676	JROCK2004	here's an interesting HOWTO on Flash: http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Howto/Flash-Memory-HOWTO/index.html
