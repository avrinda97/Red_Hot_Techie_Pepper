2007-12-03T07:45:00.000Z	scottybea		hello, I try to edit my .bash_profile but any changes i put in there do not work
2007-12-03T07:46:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	what changes aren't happening? also just to double check are you closing your term and opening it again after saving .bash_profile?
2007-12-03T07:48:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	to clarify, you did close and open the terminal again correct? Can you paste you .bash_profile in pastebin?
2007-12-03T07:49:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	ubotu (the bot) just explained it to you
2007-12-03T07:49:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	I would suggest clicking on the link, pasting the contents of your .bash_profile into the text window then clicking ok then pasteing the link to me in the channel here
2007-12-03T07:50:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	no
2007-12-03T07:52:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	paste the link in here so I can see your .bash_profile
2007-12-03T07:53:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	yes
2007-12-03T07:54:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	those aliases are fine, so after you saved the file did you open up a new terminal? so that bash loads in the new changes?
2007-12-03T07:57:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	that's due to emacs backup files, in a terminal can you type ". .bash_profile" from your home directory and see if the l alias is available?
2007-12-03T07:59:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	so for some reason your bash is not reading .bash_profile on startup
2007-12-03T07:59:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	there you go :) from astro76 lol put it in .profile
2007-12-03T07:59:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	and that's why we don't use private messages lol
2007-12-03T08:02:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	well I put all of my aliases in .bashrc so you can try that as well... my .bash_profile just loads .bashrc and .profile
2007-12-03T08:04:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	when bash starts up as a login shell it loads .profile, I would put your alias defs in .bashrc which is loads when it's started as an interactive shell
2007-12-03T08:05:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	no
2007-12-03T08:05:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	each terminal has it's own bash instance
2007-12-03T08:08:00.000Z	kelsin	scottybea	bashrc is the better place for that stuff. bash has a very complicated startup stuff. like I said before I make my .bash_profile load .bashrc (I think that was some some other distros default) and have been doing that for a while
