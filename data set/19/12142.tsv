2005-10-23T10:54:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	some kind of special mouse?
2005-10-23T10:54:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	you could try running xorgconfig
2005-10-23T10:55:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	it's r0xoR now not "ubuntu" :)
2005-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	Severian	r0xoR	Can we add a new line at the bottom that says     /usr/bin/X11/xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"
2005-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	sure why not
2005-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	or better yet put that line in a script
2005-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	and then run the script
2005-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	but yeah, you can do that
2005-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	try & at the end as well
2005-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	that'll run it in the background so you won't have to worry about waiting for startup times and in case it keeps running
2005-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	Severian	r0xoR	I was not sure if I needed a ". " at the beginning.  The line that is already there has it and I don't know what it does.
2005-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	paste the contents of .xinitrc to pastebin plz
2005-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	here: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-10-23T11:34:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	yeah that message has happened to me before the "less than ten seconds"
2005-10-23T11:35:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	usually it has to do with .xsession
2005-10-23T11:35:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	so i'm not surprised
2005-10-23T11:35:00.000Z	Severian	r0xoR	sounds likely, then.  is that message likely to have been logged, do you think?
2005-10-23T11:38:00.000Z	r0xoR	Severian	no i think he just didn't apply the number of buttons to the right device in xorg.conf
2005-10-23T11:41:00.000Z	Severian	r0xoR	I had mickey create a backup of xorg.conf before he started.
