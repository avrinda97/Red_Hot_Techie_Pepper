2010-05-12T14:12:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	if you can please show some patience I might be able to give you a hand on some things. Have you checked if the packages you are looking for are in the repositories?
2010-05-12T14:19:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	I've asked you some questions before, could you try and answer them?
2010-05-12T14:40:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	it would help if you would just tell us the problem. You've stated a whole list of different seemingly unrelated problems, so there is probably a bigger problem which you have tried to solve, and probably failed.
2010-05-12T14:46:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	Ok, and what have you done precisely? Please, be detailed and if need be use more then just 1 line.
2010-05-12T14:46:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	updating won't screw with your sources.list, so i'm lead to assume you've done some manual editing.
2010-05-12T14:49:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	you're probably talking about cups, which is ok. It's usually installed, which should have no problem. Can you pastebin your sources.list for me/
2010-05-12T14:50:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	type this on the command line : gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-05-12T14:50:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	then copy the whole content of that file to pastebin.com, click on submit and give me the link.
2010-05-12T14:55:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	then please, give me the link.
2010-05-12T14:55:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	it's the browser link. After you've clicked submit the top link will have changed. That's the link we're looking for.
2010-05-12T14:58:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	chandrageetha	and please, use this link to pastebin: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com
