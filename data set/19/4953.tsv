2009-05-29T09:37:00.000Z	deathtech		 I have an older machine that i installed ubuntu on, for the community support and other things, but was kind of wondering, for a machine running a 500 mhz proc, 184 MB'd of Ram, is there s more suitable , kinda tuned for low low end machines, but with high functionality like Ubuntu ?
2009-05-29T09:37:00.000Z	deathtech		MB's *
2009-05-29T09:38:00.000Z	deathtech		Also, Ubuntu doesnt appear to have figured out the video hardware very well, and its stu ck in 800x600, whereas the native would be 1024x768
2009-05-29T09:38:00.000Z	durt	deathtech	try a cli install of ubuntu and put LXDE on top of it.
2009-05-29T09:39:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	, interesting. Is there a particular site or configuration option to choose a command line install ?
2009-05-29T09:40:00.000Z	durt	deathtech	must be done from the alternative cd.
2009-05-29T09:41:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	, can i just do a sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop, then apt install lxde ?
2009-05-29T09:41:00.000Z	durt	deathtech	yup
2009-05-29T09:42:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	Awesome, anyway to figure out what my specific monitor settings are so i can correctly set them in xorg ? its a laptop , so its difficult to find the specs to begin with, much less one this old
2009-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	like a deep query app that can probe the settings ?
2009-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	durt	deathtech	go a google for 'your lappy's product id and xorg'
2009-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	searched high and low, really not a lot of info for my specfic model
2009-05-29T09:45:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	i put quite  a bit of effort into it, trying different search symantics and things, and couldnt find anything on it, its a Compaq Presario 1600XL-145
2009-05-29T09:46:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	for display info at least
2009-05-29T09:46:00.000Z	durt	deathtech	what video chipset?
2009-05-29T09:47:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	tried that one too, Trident Cyberblade i1
2009-05-29T09:55:00.000Z	durt	deathtech	not finding much of anything on those, try 'xrandr' for possible resolutions.
2009-05-29T09:59:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	Thanks for the help though, its a rough one for this machine i beleive :p
2009-05-29T09:59:00.000Z	deathtech	durt	not a ton of exp with xrandr, but no better time to learn, eh ?
