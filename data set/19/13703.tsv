2005-05-23T08:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		debian style
2005-05-23T08:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		I can make menuconfig
2005-05-23T08:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		which is what I plan to do
2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		yeah
2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		I know
2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		thanks though
2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		could you direct me to the tutorial though
2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		just to make sure I dont miss anything
2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	JDahl	mebaran151	you can get the default kernel build options by copying /boot/config-2.6.8-xxx to /usr/linux/.config. That way you get the same default choices used for building image-2.6.8-.xxx
2005-05-23T08:39:00.000Z	JDahl	mebaran151	that was /usr/src/linux of course
2005-07-21T09:31:00.000Z	JDahl	mebaran151	I am fairly sure that an ISP blocking port 80 wouldnt be in business for long
2005-07-21T09:32:00.000Z	mebaran151	JDahl	exactly
2005-07-21T10:00:00.000Z	JDahl	mebaran151	edit /etc/init.d/bashrc
2005-07-21T10:00:00.000Z	mebaran151	JDahl	all users or jjust root
2006-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	JDahl	mebaran151	I don't think the version that comes with Ubuntu works - I had to download it from eclipse.org
2006-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	mebaran151	JDahl	can I checkinstall it?
2006-01-13T12:05:00.000Z	JDahl	mebaran151	I just downloaded to the tar file and installed in ~/bin. I think it works with gcj - at least I don't recall any problems with Ubuntu's java (blackdown?). I didn't use it much, however; I thought xemacs was easier to use
