2005-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		any of you know if there's umm.. something like to view multiply picture formats...able to resave them...zooms...and perhaps anything else (basic editor tools optional too)?
2005-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		and simple to use too maybe? :p
2005-04-02T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	gthumb is pretty good
2005-04-04T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	www.transgaming.com
2005-04-04T08:41:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	? no.
2005-04-04T08:43:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	depends what version of windows.  gnome's probably on-par with win2k
2005-04-04T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	of course
2005-04-05T16:08:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	plug it in.  enjoy.
2005-04-05T16:12:00.000Z	black_Nightmare	bob2	... once again "what else is there that it can't do?" :p
2005-04-05T07:18:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	yeah
2005-04-05T07:18:00.000Z	black_Nightmare	bob2	hm so if I go with that option..its more likely 1.2gb+swap?
2005-04-05T07:18:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	yes
2005-04-08T05:20:00.000Z	black_Nightmare	bob2	- so true...mine works fine minus one ongoing card issue
2005-04-21T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	of course it's customisable
2005-04-21T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	but there's usually no point, just change the defauls after the install is done
2005-04-21T07:05:00.000Z	black_Nightmare	bob2	what if I was wanting to just like put a somewhat-bare installion on smaller hd?
2005-04-21T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	sure, look at the help screens at the very first installer screen (ie the boot: promopt)
2005-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	sure it can detect the card
2005-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	bob2	black_Nightmare	run pnpdump
