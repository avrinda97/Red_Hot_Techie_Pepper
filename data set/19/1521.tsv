2011-01-29T10:56:00.000Z	mbvpixies78		How can I troubleshoot Ubuntu bootup problems?  Is there a "repair" disk?
2011-01-29T10:57:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	you can use an ubuntu install live cd as a repair disc
2011-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 it won't boot from the disc
2011-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 any idea why (BIOS boots first from flash, then cd then hdd)
2011-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	and it wont boot from a cd disc?
2011-01-29T11:01:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 no...  never gets to the "boot from cd" part...  just DMI update... and "GRUB" and nothing
2011-01-29T11:02:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 weird part, this has happened on three separate computers, from different hardware
2011-01-29T11:02:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 I don't see how a kvm switch could muck up an mbr AND cause it to not boot from cd or flash...???
2011-01-29T11:02:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	i would press f2 f11 f8 and f5 during boot to get to the bios menu and try to find something
2011-01-29T11:03:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	if it is getting to grub then the bios has already booted from the hard disk so you know your boot order is messed up somehow
2011-01-29T11:03:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 yeah, I suppose it's worth a shot, as I said before, it's like the computers go through an existential crisis for a few days, cause eventually, they will boot from cd or flash
2011-01-29T11:04:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 right now it's like hot potato...  some will work others won't...  wonder if maybe my meager apartment isn't supplying adequate power?
2011-01-29T11:05:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	i dont know. i really dont know anything about hardware. and my knowledge of bios's is just from installing ubuntu and a general knowledge of what they do
2011-01-29T11:06:00.000Z	mbvpixies78	noonian	 I troubleshot this thoroughly on the oldest of the comps, thinking it was bad, but I took out CMOS battery, also cleared CMOS by shorting the pins...  no luck, then one day it worked
2011-01-29T11:52:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	 sometimes hehe
2011-01-29T11:53:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	i dont think that was me lol :P
2011-01-29T11:54:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	no worries
2011-01-29T12:12:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	tar -xvf <name>.tar.gz
2011-01-29T12:23:00.000Z	noonian	mbvpixies78	actually you might need tar -xzf for a gzipped tar file
