2007-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	TU		i am getting ungodly slow dns resolutions
2007-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	TU		so long they fail sometimes.
2007-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	TU		the network works
2007-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	TU		i am connected to my router
2007-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	TU		and every other device works perfectly
2007-09-18T14:05:00.000Z	TU		it is just this ONE pc.
2007-09-18T14:06:00.000Z	TU		look ups are perfect.
2007-09-18T14:07:00.000Z	TU		every where else it is almost instantaneous
2007-09-18T14:07:00.000Z	TU		(my other devices i mean)
2007-09-18T14:09:00.000Z	TU		my laptop's /etc/resolv.conf is kinda wierd too.
2007-09-18T14:10:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	that's correct.. but you should have another nameserver line, too
2007-09-18T14:11:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	wouldn't have thought so, but if it's a valid DNS server, there's no reason why not
2007-09-18T14:11:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	most likely, yeah :)
2007-09-18T14:13:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	put the ip address of your router in there instead :)
2007-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	not so sure then.. the only places I roam between all have the router as the same IP address, sorry :/
2007-09-18T14:16:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	possibly though i would have thought that when running on DHCP it should set it automagically for you
2007-09-18T14:17:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	i presume you have it set to DHCP everywhere.. including for dns servers?
2007-09-18T14:18:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	you could try messing with the network profiles in kde/gnome
2007-09-18T14:18:00.000Z	[nrx] 	TU	have one for home, one for school, etc
