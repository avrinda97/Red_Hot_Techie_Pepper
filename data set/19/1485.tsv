2011-01-12T19:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 you checked the forums yet? I see a question like that - or about like that - in here every week/few days.. never seen a 'quick fix' however.
2011-01-24T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 err.. 'qmake' then 'make' then 'sudo make install'
2011-01-24T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 thats the question you asked.. :)
2011-01-24T18:04:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	I'm in the main folder.. Not in SRC or anything.
2011-01-24T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 and any errors its giving are?
2011-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	It just says "The program 'qmake' can be found in the following packages.
2011-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 so its telling you that qmake is NOT installed....
2011-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 so install it?
2011-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	thanks :D
2011-01-24T18:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 sh whatever.sh
2011-01-24T18:11:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	When I type in make after qmake I get an error
2011-01-24T18:11:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	Something something fatal error: QApplication: No such file or directory
2011-01-24T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 you proberly need to isntall extra dev packages..
2011-01-24T18:12:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	Question is, how :O
2011-01-24T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	HugoGF	 read the error messages and qmake/make output and figure it out. or if the pacakge is allready in teh repos. you can use the 'apt-get build-deps pacakgename'
2011-01-24T18:13:00.000Z	HugoGF	Dr_Willis	thanks
