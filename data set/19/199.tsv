2012-07-01T15:29:00.000Z	mschr		Yo, whats up with the HDMI playback for time being?? How come it doesnt 'just-work' :/
2012-07-01T15:30:00.000Z	mschr		i have tried multiple approaches, none seemed to work. Only thing left for me - given my knowledge of the sound system - is to manually compile alsa
2012-07-01T15:31:00.000Z	mschr		HDMI device shows fine everywhere and modules are loaded, however no audio is sent through.. aplay -D hw:hdmi_ints ..wav ?> channel count not available
2012-07-01T15:32:00.000Z	mschr		k0; analog audio playback => mini-jack speakers output, digital audio playback => optical jacks etc.. hdmi => passthrough audio to receiving device
2012-07-01T15:33:00.000Z	mschr		aplay -D plughw:hdmi_ints ..wav no error - yet no sound
2012-07-01T15:34:00.000Z	mschr		discussions about the topic comes in multiples with many many forums
2012-07-01T15:35:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=0.3
2012-07-01T15:35:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	have you tried the various -ao possibilities with mplaye r?
2012-07-01T15:36:00.000Z	mschr	k0nichiwa	how would i know for sure which hw:x,y is the right one?
2012-07-01T15:38:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	it probabl isnt the right one for you
2012-07-01T15:38:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	you'd have to research that part some more
2012-07-01T15:39:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	maybe its a device listed in your /dev or whatever
2012-07-01T15:39:00.000Z	k0nichiwa		that linux directory that lists all the devices on your machine
2012-07-01T15:40:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	obviously you can make some guesses and try all the possibilities pretty quickly
2012-07-01T15:40:00.000Z	k0nichiwa	mschr	another thing ive found with alsa if you are using that
2012-07-01T15:40:00.000Z	k0nichiwa		is that alsa for me would somtimes have various outputs and inputs set to 0 volume
2012-07-01T15:40:00.000Z	k0nichiwa		i think it was alsactl in a terminal that would let you control that
2012-07-01T15:44:00.000Z	mschr		i was noticing some bumping 'ticks' on my TV over hdmi once i turn up volume 50% + (very loud). Reinstalled fglrx with one shipped on ubuntu repositories and now its gone (thumbing). yet still no audio
2012-07-01T15:48:00.000Z	mschr	k0nichiwa	MonkeyDust thx but sadly none of the above forum threads is the solution
