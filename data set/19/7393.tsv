2007-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	untagetra		Does anyone know of what resources the help file in the LIveCD booter is talking about when I can't get the LiveCD to boot?
2007-08-31T08:11:00.000Z	untagetra		...I can't get Ubuntu or any of its variants to get past the usplash (I think that's what it is?)
2007-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	try edit the boot options by pressing F6 and   remove the options    quiet & splash     that should give you a detailied eroor message that you can paste into google
2007-08-31T08:14:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	Thanks, I'll try
2007-08-31T08:22:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	Starting up without splash and quiet options on the liveCD got the loader to start up when it never has before; will it be a problem if I install Ubuntu on there?
2007-08-31T08:22:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	you mean you reached the desktop ok?  if so you can disable the logo after you install too
2007-08-31T08:23:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	That's right, I'm to the desktop when I've never gotten that computer to the desktop before. It's pretty weird. Does it point to a lurking problem elsewhere?
2007-08-31T08:24:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	not really.. i can't boot the logo because of my 8800GTS card..
2007-08-31T08:25:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	Thanks a bunch. I might just get this desktop off of Windows ME after all! :)
2007-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	you might want to write this down....
2007-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	ready
2007-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	after install the flie you want to edit a file:    sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst      and scroll down and delete the splash word... don't worry about quiet
2007-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	Thanks a bunch
2007-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	if you can't boot up at all you can edit the boot option for GRUB menu on the fly.... press e to edit there is instructions   then just delete splash like you did before..
2007-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	you should only need to do that in emergency normally you can just edit the file it will remember
2007-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	Will that apply if I'm not dual-booting?
2007-08-31T08:30:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	yes you still have a GRUB menu anyway so that you can enter recomvery mode and stuff..  when you get a new kernel it adds a new menu option sso you can go back if you have problems
2007-08-31T08:30:00.000Z	serenityUK	untagetra	recovery*
2007-08-31T08:31:00.000Z	untagetra	serenityUK	Thanks so much
