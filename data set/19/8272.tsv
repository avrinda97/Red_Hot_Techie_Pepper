2007-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	kiba		I am upgrading to Gusty
2007-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	Gutsy questions in #ubuntu+1 please.
2007-11-23T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	What version is this 'new kernel'??
2007-11-23T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	You need to be more specific, you are being very vague.
2007-11-23T19:24:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	once again, you need to be more specific.  are we talking 2.6.23.* or what?
2007-11-23T19:25:00.000Z	kiba	Pici	I cannnot be more specific
2007-11-23T19:25:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	What exact version number won't it run?
2007-11-23T19:25:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	Then we can't help you.
2007-11-23T19:27:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	We can't help you if you aren't willing to go through the troubleshooting steps.
2007-11-23T19:28:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	Did you compile a custom kernel? Are you trying to use the latest one provided with Ubuntu?
2007-11-23T19:28:00.000Z	kiba	Pici	any suggestion of doing it without rebooting?
2007-11-23T19:28:00.000Z	kiba	Pici	Uh no
2007-11-23T19:31:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	What hardware do you have that ceases to work?
2007-11-23T19:32:00.000Z	kiba	Pici	sound and networking
2007-11-23T19:32:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	What sound card? What network card?
2007-11-23T19:35:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	Did you have to do any custom stuff to get the audio and network working before you upgraded the kernel?
2007-11-23T19:37:00.000Z	kiba	Pici	no
2007-11-23T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	kiba	you could try running `modprobe e1000`, or if that doesnt work, following this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=502058
