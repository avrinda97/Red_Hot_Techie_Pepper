2010-06-22T08:44:00.000Z	MMKaho		Anybody have any experience with Ralink RT3070 drivers on Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid by any chance? ?
2010-06-22T08:45:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	what's the issue?
2010-06-22T08:47:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	what's your specific issue though?
2010-06-22T08:56:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	did you run as root/sudo?
2010-06-22T08:57:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	how did you compile the module?
2010-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	don't run make as sudo (not your problem, just a recommendation)
2010-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	and there were no errors during compilation?
2010-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	i'm certainly no expert, it sounds like maybe you compiled against the wrong kernel headers or something (total guess)
2010-06-22T09:06:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	from the windows driver installer/download
2010-06-22T09:07:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	you could try 7zip or UniExtract to get the good stuff out
2010-06-22T09:07:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	UniExtract hasn't failed me yet
2010-06-22T09:08:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	err, *on windows* that is :)
2010-06-22T10:49:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	in the GUI?
2010-06-22T10:50:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	in nm-applet the gnome thingy?
2010-06-22T10:50:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	in the panel, the little network dealy
2010-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	MMKaho	codebrainz	i have even rebooted to see if that was the issue
2010-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	not sure.  check if the wireless is in the /etc/network/interfaces file, if so, comment it out
2010-06-22T11:05:00.000Z	MMKaho	codebrainz	yea its not in that file
2010-06-22T11:05:00.000Z	codebrainz	MMKaho	no idea
