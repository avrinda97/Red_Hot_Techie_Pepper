2005-03-28T06:59:00.000Z	bdr		selinium: just use ctrl-alt-F1 and ctrl-alt-f2 to switch between them
2005-03-28T07:00:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	cheers for that one!
2005-03-28T07:07:00.000Z	bdr	selinium_	I remember installing 3ddesktop in Warty and not having any trouble with it

2005-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	bdr	selinium_	anything before that? if you look at the log: "less /var/log/Xorg.0.log" are there any more errors?
2005-03-28T07:14:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	How do i look at the log? from the command line?
2005-03-28T07:14:00.000Z	bdr	selinium_	yes, just type "less /var/log/Xorg.0.log" at the command line and you will get the log file up and can use the cursor keys to navigate it
2005-03-28T07:15:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	slept: cheers, i am learnign sooo much today!
2005-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	nope, i'm on hoary
2005-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	bdr	selinium_	oh, ok
2005-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	slept: there are a few errors, firstly wanrings that the framebuffers do'nt exist. open/dev/fb0-7: No such file or directory
2005-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	bdr	selinium_	I think you can ignore the fb errors
2005-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	slept: NV(0) failed to open framebuffer. Screens found but none have usable config
2005-03-28T07:23:00.000Z	bdr	selinium_	you're using an nvidia card? did you install the nvidia drivers?
2005-03-28T07:23:00.000Z	selinium_	bdr	slept: should i try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and use the nvidia drivers instead of NV driver, which hoary chose for me. It all worked before this morning on NV
