2009-11-14T03:15:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	think you meant to respond to someone else... not me
2009-11-14T03:16:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	err?
2010-01-05T20:37:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	marcusb : apt-cache search | grep iso
2010-03-14T00:24:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	i think there is
2010-03-14T00:24:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	hmm?
2010-03-14T00:25:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	i read a way to move processes from one machine to another
2010-03-15T19:30:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	there are specific language channels, what language do you need?
2010-05-02T15:29:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	it demonstrates that when asking a question one must be a definitive as possible. so techincally removing a file does *hide* it.
2010-05-02T15:30:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	nonsense
2010-05-02T15:30:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	not really.
2010-05-02T15:30:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	he asked how to hide a file and got told how to remove a file in a desctucive non-recoverable way
2010-05-02T15:31:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	again. questions asked need to be more definitive. not so vague.
2010-05-02T15:31:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	if the question is vague then you ask for clarification?
2010-05-02T15:32:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	but its a still a valid response. until clarification is given.
2010-05-02T15:33:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	i dont see how giving people comands that remove their files when its not clear that that is what they want is helpful in any way
2010-05-02T15:33:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	about as helpful as vague questions
2010-05-02T15:33:00.000Z	acicula	airtonix	then best not give them
2010-05-02T15:33:00.000Z	airtonix	acicula	did I ?
