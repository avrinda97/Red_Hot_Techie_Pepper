2009-11-19T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	from a while ago
2009-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	I was going through some stuff that was put here before and saw it
2009-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	Flash hmm
2009-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	rodgerr	sebsebseb	thanks want to PM to keep it off the grid
2009-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	why?
2009-11-19T05:00:00.000Z	rodgerr	sebsebseb	no particular reason
2009-11-19T05:00:00.000Z	rodgerr	sebsebseb	I'm old and hard to keep track of all the data flow
2009-11-19T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	just  checking with some guys for any suggestions, before I put something proper hold on
2009-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	Flash generally is  a bit hmm since propritary format and can sometimes cause issues with Firefox on Ubuntu.   However  according to one of the guys you can make with Open Office Impress, add your voice, and then convert it to Flash.   I was also given this articlehttp://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/81113-openoffice-impress-features by another one

2009-11-19T05:06:00.000Z	rodgerr	sebsebseb	I am familiar with the ability to record for individual slides - it is an option - was looking for something that combined the slides and possibly kept track of the time of the audio (Students only listen for about 15 minutes before tuning out)  I will look at the link you snet

2009-11-19T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	If timed properly it woudn't matter?  Also time intervals can be added to the slides.
2009-11-19T05:18:00.000Z	rodgerr		Sebsebseb: It is a lot of extra work, but doable.  Each presentation would have to be broken into 15 minutes segments, the audio would have to be made in some other application, then the audio files incorporated into impress and then compiled into flash.  I could do the smae thing in Power Point but the Authorgen product did it all in one app and it would be nice to have the same functionality in

2009-11-19T05:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rodgerr	ok  uhmm just looking at something you made
