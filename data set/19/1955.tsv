2010-10-04T05:05:00.000Z	dschuett		does anyone use ssmtp to send outgoing mail?
2010-10-04T05:07:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 i use ssmtp
2010-10-04T05:07:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	see my probelm below your message
2010-10-04T05:08:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 offhand, i don't think ssmtp is meant for anything that sophisticated.
2010-10-04T05:09:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 there is an option to *not* change from domain, but i'm not sure that'd do what you want.
2010-10-04T05:10:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	i agree it is not meant for anything sofisticated...but the problem with sendmail is that it will get rejected
2010-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 i am a fan of postfix
2010-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 did you try changing the FromLineOverride option?
2010-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	no...where is that at?
2010-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 in the /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
2010-10-04T05:12:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 there's also a rewriteDomain option you may want to disable.
2010-10-04T05:13:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	so then where to i actually set the new from address?
2010-10-04T05:14:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	the php header?
2010-10-04T05:14:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 i believe it'll take whatever you set it to in the actual message. not 100% sure though, and of course, you can't get replies.
2010-10-04T05:14:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 rfc822 From: methinks
2010-10-04T05:15:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	but it will allow replies to the address i set though, which is what i want...
2010-10-04T05:15:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 if your mail client (or script) is configured right, i think so.
2010-10-04T05:16:00.000Z	bobstro	dschuett	 if FromLineOverride is set to NO, it should simply use what's in the From: header
2010-10-04T05:17:00.000Z	dschuett	bobstro	ok, i will give it a try here and see what happens
