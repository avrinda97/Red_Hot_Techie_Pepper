2007-08-19T10:09:00.000Z	oompaloompa	Jack_Sparrow	no sh** rythmbox is reading off of it lmao thanks for the poke in the eyeball, bud
2007-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	oompaloompa	Jack_Sparrow	will fsck check ntfs?
2007-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	oompaloompa	Jack_Sparrow	with ntfsutils installed?
2007-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oompaloompa	I wouldnt think so.. at some point you need to step back and take a serious look at things and the best tools available.
2007-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	oompaloompa	Jack_Sparrow	right i understand that. . .i just meant as a quick down and dirty fix for my own ntfs volume that won't mount right now because of the same reason. . .and i only need like two things off of it
2007-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	oompaloompa	Jack_Sparrow	then i'm gonna hose the drive
2007-08-20T08:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oompaloompa	I dont let ubuntu write to my ntfs....  I would look at the hirens cd before trying to force mount it.
2007-08-20T08:29:00.000Z	oompaloompa	Jack_Sparrow	right-o.  thanks, brother
