2007-10-04T15:16:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	you can non-destructively resize your windows partitions
2007-10-04T15:17:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	when you install grub (the boot loader, that loads the OS) it will make ubuntu the default OS. you'll still HAVE windows, but ubuntu will boot by default
2007-10-04T15:18:00.000Z	trdracer	preaction	: ok so i want to install but dont want to open up a partition or whatever..
2007-10-04T15:19:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	ubuntu requires a few hundred megabytes, and until it's installed you need another OS. once it's installed you can delete windows, but until then you need it. backup some of your music and restore it later
2007-10-04T15:19:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	SOME, not all
2007-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	how much space do you have free? as i said before you can non-destructively resize your partition
2007-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	trdracer	preaction	i only have 149 total hdd space atm
2007-10-04T15:27:00.000Z	trdracer	preaction	i will find out right now exactly how much i have left
2007-10-04T15:27:00.000Z	trdracer	preaction	is 5.85GB unused
2007-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	that's fine for now. don't PM people without asking. use the ubuntu installer to resize your partition, install ubuntu on that new partition, delete the OS from your old partition
2007-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	or you don't need to delete the old OS at all, both will be loadable (as per your PM question)
2007-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	it's like telemarketers, or that guy in your office who calls you for every little issue
2007-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	trdracer	preaction	with no hassles?
2007-10-04T15:32:00.000Z	preaction	trdracer	the hassle would be Press Esc during the boot and choose Windows XP from the menu
