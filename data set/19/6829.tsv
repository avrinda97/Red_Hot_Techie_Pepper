2008-01-06T01:05:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	I am trying to fix my resolution... when i tried to use Nvidia to configure settings i got this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50894/
2008-01-06T01:07:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	you have the nvidia driver installed tho?
2008-01-06T01:07:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	yes i believe so
2008-01-06T01:08:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	I'll try to get your resolution fixed and then you can try getting dualview set up again
2008-01-06T01:09:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	sounds good
2008-01-06T01:09:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	would it be easier for you if I just gave you remote acess to my computer?
2008-01-06T01:09:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	no need to
2008-01-06T01:09:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	ok
2008-01-06T01:09:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	how do i get that file you want?
2008-01-06T01:10:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-01-06T01:11:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50895/
2008-01-06T01:14:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	try doing this, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.back then log out and login to a terminal session and do sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and then type exit and login normally. This should fix resolution. If you can't login, from a terminal just do sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.back /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-01-06T01:15:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	ok give me a second
2008-01-06T01:17:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	when you say log out and login to a terminal session do you mean open up a terminal window? or do i have to do something else?
2008-01-06T01:18:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	logout and click sessions, and choose the one that says terminal (forgot exact name)
2008-01-06T01:23:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	I did what you said... but I am still stuck in 800 x 600
2008-01-06T01:25:00.000Z	jinxed-	TigranG	you there?
2008-01-06T01:31:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	Sorry. I was afk
2008-01-06T01:32:00.000Z	TigranG	jinxed-	are you using the restricted driver or open source
