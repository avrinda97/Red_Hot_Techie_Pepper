2007-02-22T15:36:00.000Z	slippyr4		sosubuntuko: what exactly did you do to it between it last working and it being b0rked
2007-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	SOSubuntuKO	slippyr4	used synaptics to install ati drivers... :-{ must have damaged kernel or something?
2007-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	what do you mean "a nice name"
2007-02-22T15:39:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	i think a different mount point would probably suffice. i don't think that's a label shown on the desktop. create a new directory in /media - eg /media/Pretty
2007-02-22T15:39:00.000Z	slippyr4		and change /media/hdc1 to /media/Pretty in fstab
2007-02-22T15:40:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	write files to your new disk?
2007-02-22T15:42:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	: start a shell and "ls -lad /media/hdc1" - enter results here

2007-02-22T15:43:00.000Z	slippyr4		gah! i thought i'd lost my beer
2007-02-22T15:43:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	what user are you logged in as
2007-02-22T15:44:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	: you could do, or, you could change permissions- try "sudo chmod a+rwx /media/hdc1
2007-02-22T15:46:00.000Z	SOSubuntuKO		i-m stuck with error on loading ubuntu .... cannot access tty job control turned off.... can anybody help???
2007-02-22T15:46:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	chown would do it (chown <youruse> <filename>) but you don't want to do that here. change the permissions like i said before
2007-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	do you understand what all the drwxrwxrwx stuff means?
2007-02-22T15:48:00.000Z	SOSubuntuKO		HELP! i receive /bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off.... CANNOT load ubuntu anymore...
2007-02-22T15:48:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	ok. if you changed owned, then the rwx in the user permission set would allow *you* to access the stuff - but group and everyone are still read-only. in this case you really want group and world to be able to write, hence permission change. and, yes, this will work fine after reboot.
2007-02-22T15:49:00.000Z	slippyr4		sosubuntuko: there are errors listed above that. possibly something about cannot access root or something: for anyone to help you they'll need those errors
2007-02-22T15:49:00.000Z	SOSubuntuKO	slippyr4	ok i reboot and try to be back!
