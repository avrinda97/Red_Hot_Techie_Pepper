2006-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	joseph		I have a regular user who does not belong to the admin group.  I want to be able to run admin programs while this user is logged in.  how can I accomplish this?
2006-01-15T15:25:00.000Z	joseph		is this impossible in ubuntu?
2006-01-15T15:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	You can define sudo for each user to allow them to run only certain programs.  Use visudo to edit the sudoers file, and you can add whatever you need them to be able to do to that.
2006-01-15T15:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	Which do you mean by the "appropriate password"?  That of the normal user, or admin?
2006-01-15T15:28:00.000Z	joseph	tonyyarusso	that of the admin
2006-01-15T15:29:00.000Z	joseph	tonyyarusso	the way it works in Debian, if you've ever used it....when regular users launch programs requiring root permission, a dialogue comes up asking for the password.
2006-01-15T15:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	I haven't used Debian, but there are one or two things in Ubuntu that have asked for the root password, rather than the user password of a full sudoer.
2006-01-15T15:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	Why do you need these things run by the admin but under another users login?  (I'm assuming the user in question would not know the admin password?)
2006-01-15T15:31:00.000Z	joseph	tonyyarusso	because these are student library computers that will be logged in as regular users.  In case something happens I might want to walk-up to it and launch a program that requires admin permissions.
2006-01-15T15:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	How often does "something happen"?  A new login seems like the simplest way, but I'll grant that it would be annoying to have to do a lot.  Also, is it absolutely necessary to have menu access, or could you live with launching from a command line?
2006-01-15T15:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	_jason: I have root enabled, but 95% of things ask for my password like before; one or two asked for root's.
2006-01-15T15:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	Applications > System > New Login allows you to login another user without breaking the first's session.
2006-01-15T15:39:00.000Z	joseph	tonyyarusso	I don't have an "Applications --> System" menu.
2006-01-15T15:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	That's a Gnome thing, not sure what you're using.  Might have something similar though, if you look around for new login.
2006-01-15T15:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	What breadth of things are we classifying as too complicated?  I checked out ssh for the first time over break, and it didn't seem too bad.
2006-01-15T15:45:00.000Z	joseph	tonyyarusso	I don't want ssh just to get access to root priviledge from a non-admin session....
2006-01-15T15:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	You will be able to su in a command line and do whatever you want from there.
2006-01-19T10:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	Um, sure!
2006-04-17T10:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	joseph	Bunches of people have trouble with that ;)
