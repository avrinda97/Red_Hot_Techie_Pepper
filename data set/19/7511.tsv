2007-10-22T12:28:00.000Z	p34ce		ive got ubuntu 5.1
2007-10-22T12:29:00.000Z	p34ce		should i just download a newer firefox or something?
2007-10-22T12:30:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	5.1? like Hoary?
2007-10-22T12:32:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	if you're running Hoary, which I think you said you were, you might want to consider upgrade ;)
2007-10-22T12:33:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	you said you were running Ubuntu 5.10?
2007-10-22T12:39:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	after you get the ISO, you just burn it and boot to it
2007-10-22T12:55:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	you said you're on Dapper, so I think not
2007-10-22T12:56:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	whats stopping you from doing a dist-upgrade?
2007-10-22T12:58:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	its a very good idea to upgrade to Edgy
2007-10-22T12:59:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	you cant do it straight from 5.10 or w/e it was you said
2007-10-22T12:59:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	but you can always download the ISO and do a clean install
2007-10-22T12:59:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	the torrents are hot!
2007-10-22T13:02:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	nope
2007-10-22T13:02:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	you're better off doing a clean install, just download the ISOs
2007-10-22T13:03:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	best to use torrents
2007-10-22T13:06:00.000Z	scguy318	p34ce	make sure to backup as usual
