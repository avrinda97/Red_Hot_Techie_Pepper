2007-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	longgia2001	nomasteryoda	I have an icon appeared on my desktop yesterday whenever i inserted a CDROM, but not today. However, I can mount it manually. I did [System-> Preferences -> Removables ...]  and checked all the 3 1st checkboxes. Also check the [app/nautilus/desktop/volumns_visible] , but not work.  Pls help me to make the icon appear again !

2007-06-15T11:22:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	longgia2001	recommend making new user, logging in as that user... if your cd icon appears, then some setting as your main user is torqued
