2011-07-30T21:58:00.000Z	nicofs		I want to share a folder in my network so that anyone can have read-only access, even without giving username and password. How can I do that?
2011-07-30T21:59:00.000Z	nicofs		I used the GUI from nautilus and checked "Guest access" but I still can't access the shared folder without giving my credentials...
2011-07-30T22:01:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	you have set up samba to allow that
2011-07-30T22:01:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	how would i do that?
2011-07-30T22:03:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	sharing itself works. but just not without user name and passwd...
2011-07-30T22:07:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	my smb.config ftp://98.213.59.214/pub/smb.conf
2011-07-30T22:09:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	no way to do that with a GUI? where is smb.conf located?
2011-07-30T22:12:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	your smb.conf is in /etc/samba my smb.conf is wget ftp://98.213.59.214/pub/samb.conf
2011-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	ok - and now i shall compare both and spot the difference to know what makes folders shareable without user and pw...?
2011-07-30T22:14:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	the global and the dicks shared folder
2011-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	sorry, i need help not puzzles. what do i need to enable and where?
2011-07-30T22:17:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	you can left click on your folder you wish to share and in properties check the share button and the if your smb.conf is right it will share with no password
2011-07-30T22:18:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	which doesn't work. I can share there, but i still need user and password...
2011-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	after setting smb.config you need to restart samba
2011-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	nicofs	w30	i didn'T set anything because i don't know what to set.
2011-07-30T22:20:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	did you set your smb.conf up like mine?
2011-07-30T22:22:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	back up your original first
2011-07-30T22:22:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	so you can always go back to it
2011-07-30T22:46:00.000Z	w30	nicofs	did you get your smb.conf installed?
