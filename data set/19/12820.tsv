2005-07-02T06:09:00.000Z	resiak	orogor	Then that could be your problem. Try using its ip rather than hostname?

2005-07-02T06:10:00.000Z	orogor	resiak	but i am behind a router

2005-07-02T06:11:00.000Z	resiak	orogor	Sounds like the name resolution stuff is messed up
2005-07-02T06:11:00.000Z	orogor	resiak	humm
2005-07-02T06:17:00.000Z	orogor	resiak	 is there  anything in the default ssh config of ubuntu that would restrict access to locales adresses only .?
2005-07-02T06:18:00.000Z	resiak	orogor	No. I am now going to sleep
