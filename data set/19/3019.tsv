2010-01-13T01:22:00.000Z	Rodensky		Hello ppl - ubuntu 9.04 - I reinstalled alsamixer after having sound problems, so now I can hear without any problem but the mic isn't working... :\
2010-01-13T01:23:00.000Z	BitWraith	Rodensky	call up alsamixer in the terminal... the mic is probably muted.
2010-01-13T01:25:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	That's the problem - it's all up. That was the problem last time - everything was up and still there was no sound, only after reinstalling i could hear sound
2010-01-13T01:26:00.000Z	BitWraith	Rodensky	highlight the imc and press m on your keyboard
2010-01-13T01:26:00.000Z	BitWraith		same for your PCM and master channels, if necessary
2010-01-13T01:27:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	you ment the mic?
2010-01-13T01:27:00.000Z	BitWraith		yes
2010-01-13T01:29:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	The mic is up there, pressing m made no difference
2010-01-13T01:30:00.000Z	BitWraith	Rodensky	look below the master channel and the PCM channel. you should see a green square if the channel is active and an empty square if it is muted. make sure they are turned up before you bother with the mic
2010-01-13T01:32:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	Their up. I can hear songs and stuff, it's the mic that isn't working (built in, it's a laptop)
2010-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	BitWraith	Rodensky	press F5 in alsamixer and make sure the mic is set as the capture device
2010-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	Also, last time I had to reinstall because everything was up, nothing muted, yet I couldn't hear anything, but the mic worked.
2010-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	BitWraith		I think it is F5... let me make sure
2010-01-13T01:33:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	The capture is up and green, not muted
2010-01-13T01:34:00.000Z	BitWraith		Just out of curiosity, how did you know the mic was working if ou had no sound\?
2010-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	All up and is set to max (master, capture, etc) - got other idea?
2010-01-13T01:38:00.000Z	BitWraith	Rodensky	As far as I can tell, you have alsa working, I think you just need to make sure pulse is using alsa's output. I don't actually have an ubuntu box running in front of me now, so I can't see the menu, which would make it very difficult for me to help you.:-/
2010-01-13T01:39:00.000Z	Rodensky	BitWraith	thanks anyway
2010-01-13T01:40:00.000Z	BitWraith	Rodensky	no problem... I think it might help dpkg-reconfigure the pulseaudio package, but since I've never done that before you should probably not take my word for it
