2006-06-09T11:46:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	I think you can get avast for Ubuntu.  Let me check
2006-06-09T11:47:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	They have a server edition too
2006-06-09T11:47:00.000Z	Zaggynl	opitwin	okay, nice, is it free t use?
2006-06-09T11:48:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	Go to http://www.avast.com/eng/avast-for-linux-server.html
2006-06-09T11:48:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	I an checking to see if it is free
2006-06-09T11:49:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	It looks to be free
2006-06-09T11:49:00.000Z	Zaggynl	opitwin	I assume it's not in the Ubuntu repository?
2006-06-09T11:50:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	No, it don't think it is - go to packages.ubuntu.com
2006-06-09T11:51:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	Avast Linux Home Edition is Free for sure it looks like you get a 60 day trial for server edition
2006-06-09T11:54:00.000Z	Zaggynl	opitwin	Sorry I had a phonecall, no questions so far ;), thanks for the help
2006-06-09T11:54:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	Always glad to help!
2006-06-09T11:56:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	Did you check out the message from the bot
2006-06-09T11:57:00.000Z	Zaggynl	opitwin	Yup, I actually have to install an antivirus on the server (school project), but as far I can see/know it isn't really neccesary, just good configuring eliminates a lot of security risks.
2006-06-09T11:58:00.000Z	opitwin	Zaggynl	Yep, the extra ports are automactically closed
