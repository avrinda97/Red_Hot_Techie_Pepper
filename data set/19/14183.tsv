2006-03-10T13:22:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	yes but it's not working --> I'm getting the error "The system is too slow to write the CD at this speed" but I can't change the speed -- the speed box is shaded out
2006-03-10T13:24:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	worth checking
2006-03-10T13:24:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	I could just check with hdparm, correct?
2006-03-10T13:25:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	yep
2006-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	hdparm /dev/cdrom -d
2006-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	hdparm -v /dev/whatever
2006-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	ah, it's off :)
2006-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
2006-03-10T13:26:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	then sudo hdparm -d1c1 /dev/whatever   (d1 is DMA, c1 is 32bit IO)
2006-03-10T13:27:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	will this save so I don't have to do this every time I reboot?
2006-03-10T13:27:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	johndarkhorse: thank you for your help
2006-03-10T13:31:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	So I should enable the 32-bit IO support on my cdrom drive?
2006-03-10T13:31:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	it's probably worth it, yeah
2006-03-10T13:31:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	won't screw anything up?
2006-03-10T13:32:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	shouldn't do :)
2006-03-10T13:32:00.000Z	adam_	Ng	Okay thank you very much :)
2006-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	as your user or as root?
2006-07-21T15:57:00.000Z	Ng	adam_	you could always put the commands in the right order in a script and call that script from the sessions configuration
