2008-03-21T06:38:00.000Z	sam__		hi does anybody know why my DWA-542 (atheros chipset) wireless card is not being recognized like at all. Its just not showing up in iwconfig. I installed the ndiswrapper driver and I could not find where to download madwifi, only madwifi-utils was in synaptic. I am using 7.10 x86_64
2008-03-21T06:38:00.000Z	sam__		yes i did modprobe ndiswrapper
2008-03-21T06:39:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	you should not use madwifi and ndiswrapper together, they are separate drivers.
2008-03-21T06:39:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	I only have the ndiswrapper driver as far as i know, i could not even find the madwifi driver in synaptic
2008-03-21T06:40:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	I recall madwifi is included in the standard install. You need to remove that driver and blacklist it so it doesn't conflict with ndiswrapper.
2008-03-21T06:41:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	that makes sense but a.how do i black list it and b. why was my wireless card not deteted if madwifi was included? is it perhaps an old version?
2008-03-21T06:42:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	perhaps. They maybe different tricks. You needed to update the firmware, etc.
2008-03-21T06:42:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	so should i blacklist madwifi and keep trying to go with ndiswrapper? According to ndisgtk the net5416 driver is installed, but still nothing detected :(
2008-03-21T06:43:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	you don't really need ndisgtk, that's for weak people. Use command line. Also there isa million different atheros chipsets, so try with another atheros driver, and it may just work.
2008-03-21T06:44:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	well i am using the driver ndiswrapper said to use, and i dont really care whether i use the command line or a gui i just want to get online :(. like i said though, mad-wifi was working on arch linux but there does not seem to be an update for it in any repos
2008-03-21T06:45:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	you only get updates in Ubuntu with each new distro. Only security updates are applied instantly.
2008-03-21T06:46:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	I mean upgrading the mad-wifi version through apt-get
2008-03-21T06:47:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	exactly, you cannot upgrade to a new one, until the new Ubuntu version is released. That's how it work on Ubuntu.
2008-03-21T06:47:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	wait, so software only gets updated with new releases :S
2008-03-21T06:48:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	exactly. It remains frozen for 6 months. You people should read about this before switching distros.
2008-03-21T06:49:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	some people like the stability Ubuntu provides. Some people always want the latest so they use Debian unstable or Arch. There are options for everybody.
2008-03-21T06:50:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	well i dont want to go back to Arch, because i was having major problems with lag even after recompiling the kernel. does debian have good hardware / driver detection because i want to be done with this by the end of hte night?
2008-03-21T06:52:00.000Z	vocx	sam__	troubleshooting linux is half the fun! Most of Ubuntu is taken from Debian, so guess. Stay in Ubuntu. If it is fixed in Arch, probably the next release of Ubuntu will included the fixes.
2008-03-21T06:52:00.000Z	sam__	vocx	lol its not fun for me anymore :( i just want to get a stable os going
