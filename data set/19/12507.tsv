2005-08-26T05:22:00.000Z	longfeather		can anyone help with ipsec?
2005-08-26T05:22:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	I don't have a very lot of experience, but I'm willing to try :)
2005-08-26T05:23:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	thanks!
2005-08-26T05:23:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	so.. what's the problem?
2005-08-26T05:25:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	My goal is to secure my network traffic over a wireless connection.  I want all traffic to be encrypted from my laptop to my hardwired linux box.  All traffic goes thru a wireless router
2005-08-26T05:26:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	How far along the process of implementing this are you?
2005-08-26T05:29:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	stuck on a lot of levels, have 2.6.8 kernal and want to use builtin ipsec, theory escapes me, I need to ask questions to understand how ipsec owrks
2005-08-26T05:31:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	also want to set up using certs with both windows and linux clients connecting to a linux based box
2005-08-26T05:33:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	Is there any specific reason why you want to use ipsec over other vpn software? If there isn't any, I would suggest you take a look at openvpn. I use it a lot and it's really great. ;)
2005-08-26T05:33:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	has a windows client/server as well.
2005-08-26T05:34:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	I'll check that out right now
2005-08-26T05:35:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	It's very flexible, safe, and easy/fast to setup.
2005-08-26T05:36:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	installing as we speak...'
2005-08-26T05:59:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	re: openvpn, what do u recommend: routing or bridge ?
2005-08-26T05:59:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	I find routing easyest :)
2005-08-26T06:02:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	what benefits does bridging have over routing (if any)?
2005-08-26T06:03:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	with bridging the connected (single) computer acts as a member of the server's network, obtaining an ip address in the same subnet of the server's range. With routing, the client has to be in a different subnet than the server.
2005-08-26T06:05:00.000Z	longfeather	pcharky	hmmm.... I think bridging is the way I need to go - I'll check that out further
2005-08-26T06:07:00.000Z	pcharky	longfeather	I don't use bridging so i'm not sure if i can be of much assisting in you case. However don't hesitate to ask, you're welcome to pm if you like.
