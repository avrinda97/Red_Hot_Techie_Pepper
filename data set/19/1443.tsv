2012-06-22T01:17:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	does it make a difference?
2012-06-22T01:19:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	mine does weird things too! Windows wont let me format a partition to anything but NTFS! o_O
2012-06-22T01:22:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	dont know yet... the problem i am having is that my ubuntu installer cannot detect windows or other partitions...
2012-06-22T01:55:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	what was the issue you were having again? similar to mine?
2012-06-22T01:57:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	 going by the previously suggested things (i am no expert) ... could you try sudo fdisk -l ?
2012-06-22T01:58:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	oh wait.. windows doeant see it.. right
2012-06-22T01:59:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	right... Jordan_U's suggestions made it work for me..
2012-06-22T02:01:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	hmmm... sucks! :(
2012-06-22T02:04:00.000Z	Pokinawa	fuzzynurfhurter	lemme now if you find the solution... good luck bro!
