2006-07-02T08:15:00.000Z	ardchoille		I use Ubuntu with the xfce desktop and someone is logged into the computer and has their screensaver running. Is it possible for me to log into VT1 and start the xfce desktop on VT8?
2006-07-02T08:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	Ctrl-Alt-F1 should get you to VT1, not sure what the command would be though, maybe startxfce or some such thing, and then just check the man to specify VT8.

2007-03-07T13:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	do you have a good guide for writing a muttrc?
2007-03-07T13:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	I wish. I had someone walk me through it and I'm still learning.
2007-03-09T13:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	That's the second time today neo_ has done that
2007-03-24T11:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	Yeah, I know....sigh - give it another moment here
2007-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	How did you know it should be in #ubuntu+1? Because of the "20" ?
2007-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	Because his forums post says Feisty on it in the corner ;)
2007-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	Ah, ok :)
2008-12-24T03:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	those look like templates for openoffice.org, but I've never seen them show up on any of my 11 Ubuntu systems
2008-12-24T03:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	you might want to tweak the "templates" path in oo.o
2008-12-24T03:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	I haven't tried to make any templates though - any idea what would?
2008-12-24T03:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	iirc, oo.o has ~/Documents in the templates path, but you can change that within oo.o prefs
2008-12-24T03:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	no, it has /home/anthony/.openoffice.org2/user/template.  ~/Documents is the path for "My Documents" only.
2008-12-24T03:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	.odt is open document template, it looks like it's keeping copies of the templates in Documents
2008-12-24T03:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ardchoille	and more importantly, regardless of where it puts such things, what kind of nonsense is automatically creating files like this ?
2008-12-24T03:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	this is one of the reason I don't use that suite ;)
2008-12-24T03:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	tonyyarusso	gnome-office is in the repos, that may be more to your liking
