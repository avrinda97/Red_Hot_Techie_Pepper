2008-11-17T18:41:00.000Z	doors98		this is my very first install on ubuntu and my very first use but my printer is hindering me to continue using ubuntu, i guess its time to go back again for pirated windows
2008-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	ok, have fun
2008-11-17T18:45:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	I don't think I've ever tried.. I've only used ubuntu to print from network printers that handle the networking themselves
2008-11-17T18:48:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	what happens if you just click system, administration, printing and try to add it from there?
2008-11-17T18:50:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	might be some kind of setting.. there is a troubleshooting thingy for printers that lets you look at logs and what not.. have you seen it?
2008-11-17T18:53:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	in system, administration, printing, right click on the printer and select properties, there you can print a test page.. if it doesn't work you should get some kind of troubelshooting guide
2008-11-17T18:54:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	well.. if I were you I'd check the windows computer.. see if it recieves anything when you try to print.. it could be a permission problem..
2008-11-17T18:55:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	I'm not sure.. check http://linuxprinting.org . They have a long list of printers with settings and such
2008-11-17T19:07:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	I use python and html/xhtml+css
2008-11-17T19:09:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	python is pretty easy.. no need for compiling you just run it
2008-11-17T19:10:00.000Z	Slart	doors98	drag and drop.. I don't think there are many of those available for linux
