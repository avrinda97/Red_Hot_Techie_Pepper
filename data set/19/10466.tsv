2009-05-12T23:30:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	enable backports
2009-05-12T23:32:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
2009-05-12T23:33:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	read the site carefully! Backports are not always stable!
2009-05-12T23:34:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	you'r welcome
2009-05-12T23:47:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	it is possible that vlc is not in the backports yet
2009-05-12T23:47:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	did you run sudo apt-get update?
2009-05-12T23:48:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	I guess it hasn't been backported yet
2009-05-12T23:48:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	you can compile it yourself,
2009-05-12T23:49:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	If you don't know how to do it, you shouldn't do it
2009-05-12T23:50:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	it's hard to explain
2009-05-12T23:50:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	why do you want to update vlc?
2009-05-12T23:50:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	yes exactly! But you need to install dependecies too!
2009-05-12T23:53:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	well, if you can't live without
2009-05-12T23:54:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	of course you could consider upgrading to 8.10
2009-05-12T23:56:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	if you like to try out a new distro I recommend Zenwalk 6.0. It updates software often, while keeping its core packages old (and very stable!)
2009-05-12T23:59:00.000Z	anodesni	siddhartha	but if you're new to linux, just stay with ubuntu. It's easier
