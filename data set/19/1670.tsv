2010-11-14T23:08:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	I had a similar issue going from 9.10 to 10.04 I beleve. When was it they switched to GRUB2 and we were all having that issue?
2010-11-14T23:10:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	Well, back then, we just had to re-install GRUB2 at the prompt. There was a forums post detailing the how-to.
2010-11-14T23:11:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	That does not sound good. Have you tried just a re-install?
2010-11-14T23:12:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	At school, I'm the Linux guru, which isn't saying much with how MS-centered my school is, but I recently installed 10.10 to a classmate's laptop from my bootable flash. I left him alone, big mistake, he took the flash out too early in the install process, and ended up with a problem like you're having now.
2010-11-14T23:13:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	Understandable. So, have you checked the CD for defects?
2010-11-14T23:14:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	If the issue happens again, maybe the installation medium is defective. It has been known to happen now and then. And yes, it is very nice. :)
2010-11-14T23:16:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	I saw a theme that made a fresh Ubuntu install look like Win7. I, however, could never manage to get it to work. :)

2010-11-14T23:53:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	Yes, bad installation medium?
2010-11-14T23:53:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	You're going to have to make a new installation medium. Sorry.
2010-11-14T23:54:00.000Z	gidimanunaki	Sterm	CD, bootable flash drive.
