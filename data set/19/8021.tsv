2007-05-15T12:56:00.000Z	ace_ace		I got some problems with Feisty alternate install cd. It says, after first install, that apt-get is not installed and stays in command line mode.
2007-05-15T12:58:00.000Z	ace_ace		can I do that from a running system?
2007-05-15T12:58:00.000Z	ace_ace		after pressing control-D, the GUI started
2007-05-15T13:00:00.000Z	ace_ace		!ogra
2007-05-15T13:00:00.000Z	ace_ace		!seen ogra
2007-05-15T13:00:00.000Z	ace_ace		can I check the cd from the running ubuntu feisty system ?
2007-05-15T13:01:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	Not that I'm aware of, easiest is to reboot and check from the boot options :)
2007-05-15T13:02:00.000Z	ace_ace	EADG	thanks, it not really easy since I am DL the kubuntu alternate cd to see if I have more luck.
2007-05-15T13:25:00.000Z	ace_ace	EADG	Flannel: The cd had no defects, I checked it on antoher computer
2007-05-15T13:26:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	Not sure how you fix apt not being installed, but I know the alt cd does not come with a window manager, text mode only (cli/console)
2007-05-15T13:29:00.000Z	ace_ace	EADG	the alt cd does not come with a windows manager ? Of course it does
2007-05-15T13:30:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	I stand corrected.
2007-05-15T13:30:00.000Z	ace_ace	EADG	i filed a bug report on launchpad
2007-05-15T13:31:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	you may be able to install with dpkg, but I'm not familiar with it.
2007-05-15T13:36:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	try 'aptitude install apt-get'
2007-05-16T06:25:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	You get that apt-get boot error resolved?
2007-05-16T06:26:00.000Z	ace_ace	EADG	still waiting for kubuntu to download...
2007-05-16T06:49:00.000Z	EADG	ace_ace	good luck
