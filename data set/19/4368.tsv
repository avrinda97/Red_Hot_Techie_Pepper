2009-06-06T22:11:00.000Z	mdm	Kingsy101	/etc/init.d/inetd restart?  installing tftpd should already do that for you

2009-06-06T22:11:00.000Z	Kingsy101	mdm	- dont suppose you have had any experience with cisco IP phones on YATE ?

2009-06-06T22:14:00.000Z	mdm	Kingsy101	you may not have it installed, tftp should have had it as a prerequite however.  As for checking if its running ps will tell you that
