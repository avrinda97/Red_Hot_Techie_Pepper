2012-05-10T05:49:00.000Z	mca		i need to set unity 2d as default desktop enviroment
2012-05-10T05:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	at the login screen, click the "gear icon", then "unity-2d"
2012-05-10T05:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	unity-2d will now be the default shell for that account
2012-05-10T05:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	the gear icon should be next to your name
2012-05-10T05:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	oh, that's important to mention :P
2012-05-10T05:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	is there an "options" button on your screen?
2012-05-10T05:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	below the username box on the login screen?
2012-05-10T05:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	what's in the list?
2012-05-10T05:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	sure
2012-05-10T06:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	what was in the list?
2012-05-10T06:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	that's it?
2012-05-10T06:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	did you install unity?
2012-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	ok, chose "Unity 2d (previous)" and then log in
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	once you pick it, it should remain the default for that account I believe (it does in lightdm and gdm)
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	if it doesn't, there may be a checkbox for "set as default" or "save settings" or somesuch
2012-05-10T06:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	is unity 2d not logging in, or can you just not get it to be the default?
2012-05-10T06:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	is unity-2d not working at all, or just not staying as the default?
2012-05-10T06:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	alright. since it appears to be a kdm issue (not saving the default) you'll probably have better luck asking in the #kubuntu channel.
2012-05-10T06:21:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	mca	you are however welcome to stay in #ubuntu and see if anyone here is familiar with kdm
