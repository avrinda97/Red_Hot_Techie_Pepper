2007-06-22T11:17:00.000Z	Andeh		Hey, I did a xorg reconfigure and selected my card as ATI, and my screen res, but the res is distorted (fills screen tho) and when i run GNOME it looks like this: http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb258/funnyav/Mesed.jpg
2007-06-22T11:17:00.000Z	Andeh		Can anyone help me?
2007-06-22T11:17:00.000Z	Andeh		It really looks like that, completely messed up lol
2007-06-22T11:17:00.000Z	Andeh		So, can anyone help?
2007-06-22T11:18:00.000Z	Andeh		BTW i have a laptop, ATI MOBILITY RADEON 9200
2007-06-22T11:18:00.000Z	vzduch	Andeh	tried the Advanced option? (hfreq & vfreq)
2007-06-22T11:18:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	Could that be messing up the perspective and GNOME being exploded over the screen?
2007-06-22T11:18:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	lol
2007-06-22T11:19:00.000Z	vzduch	Andeh	dunno, I don't have a wide screen
2007-06-22T11:20:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	Mine's 1280X800
2007-06-22T11:20:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	One more question, when XORG fails to start (happens a lot here lol) now i don't get a terminal, i need to press CTRL+ALT+F1 for a terminal, and i can't "start" X from there
2007-06-22T11:22:00.000Z	vzduch	Andeh	if you need to Ctrl+Alt+F1 into a console, my guess is that an X server is running, but no display manager
2007-06-22T11:22:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	Ok, cause typing GDM doesnt do anything
2007-06-22T11:23:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	You said i needed to use the advanced option, how do i do that?
2007-06-22T11:24:00.000Z	vzduch	Andeh	it comes up in the process.. when it comes to configuring your screen you can choose 'Easy' (or something; don't remember exactly), 'Medium' and 'Advanced'
2007-06-22T11:24:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	Um... actually using the dpkg-reconfigure xserver.... blabla... it just asks me for the video card and res
2007-06-22T11:26:00.000Z	Andeh	vzduch	I typed this "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg"
2007-06-22T11:26:00.000Z	vzduch	Andeh	I guess that narrows down what you are shown.. try leaving the switchs out
2007-06-22T11:27:00.000Z	vzduch	Andeh	in full mode, you are being asked a lot of questions not only about the screen, but also about keyboard, mouse etc.
