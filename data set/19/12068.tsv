2007-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	ZeZu		can anyone tell me what package lspci is in ?
2007-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	pciutils
2007-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	or pci-utils.. whichever
2007-03-13T08:49:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	don't forget to run update-pciids when you installed it
2007-03-13T08:49:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	otherwise you might get a load of "unkonwn device"
2007-03-13T08:51:00.000Z	ZeZu	variant	i grabbed the -dev package
2007-03-13T08:51:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	why?
2007-03-13T08:51:00.000Z	ZeZu	variant	i'm looking to get the source to lspci so i can see how it accesses pci
2007-03-13T08:51:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	i see
2007-03-13T08:52:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	http://mj.ucw.cz/pciutils.shtml
2007-03-13T08:52:00.000Z	ZeZu	variant	thanks
2007-03-13T08:52:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	the download link fromt here is the src
2007-04-25T14:28:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	the fuser command will tell you what is holding a file open
2007-04-25T14:28:00.000Z	ZeZu	variant	thanks
2007-04-25T14:29:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	fuser -v /dev/partitionnumber
2007-04-30T08:06:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	security fixes are back ported
2007-04-30T08:07:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	how does that suck exactly? it would cease to be dapper if all the packages were updated regularly.. it would be the same as feisty
2007-04-30T08:08:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	install it manually.. not hard
2007-04-30T08:08:00.000Z	variant	ZeZu	depends on how competent you are
