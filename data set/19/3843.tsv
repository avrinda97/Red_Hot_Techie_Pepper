2009-05-17T03:47:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	your partition contains a Xandros partition to restore your eeepc, what do you want do ?
2009-05-17T03:49:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	a maximum of 4 primary partition can exist in the MBR partition table
2009-05-17T03:49:00.000Z	Codex_	jp_sf	yes. that's the problem
2009-05-17T03:49:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	it is true for any type of harddrive
2009-05-17T03:50:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	you will have to consider what do you want do with your eeepc

2009-05-17T03:51:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	ok so you have to make some choice here
2009-05-17T03:52:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	your 2 primary partition are for XP the C drive and the D drive the second two partition ("hidden") are for restoring your eeepc XP partition
2009-05-17T03:52:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	if you want to keep your current XP installation you have to delete the restore

2009-05-17T03:54:00.000Z	Codex_	jp_sf	oh, I can resize the primary partitions and delete the small primaries?
2009-05-17T03:54:00.000Z	jp_sf	Codex_	be aware that if you do so you will not be able to restore the eeepc
