2008-01-02T23:04:00.000Z	eoopy		hey people, i've been trying to install ubuntu for the fifth time now from a live CD on my DESKTOP. whenever i finish and reboot it doesn't load X but goes to a console mode where i can do nothing actually. any reason or solution?
2008-01-02T23:05:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	you can't login or type anything in the console ?
2008-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	eoopy		i can use few commands but nothing helps
2008-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	eoopy		and cant login root or a thing
2008-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	you can't even log in as root ? ,
2008-01-02T23:07:00.000Z	eoopy		tried everything, nothing would work
2008-01-02T23:07:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	weird . all of my installs have been successful ..
2008-01-02T23:07:00.000Z	eoopy		and when i start ubuntu it takes like ten mins to load. even to console mode
2008-01-02T23:08:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	can you login as the user you made in the installation process ?
2008-01-02T23:08:00.000Z	eoopy	Kasplatt	cant use login or su commands
2008-01-02T23:09:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	maybe the burn failed or something ?
2008-01-02T23:10:00.000Z	eoopy		should i try to download the file again and try to reinstall? but didn't help before..
2008-01-02T23:10:00.000Z	eoopy		checked it three times actually and was all good
2008-01-02T23:11:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	have you tried booting it up in recovery mode ?
2008-01-02T23:11:00.000Z	eoopy	Kasplatt	when i do that it gets stuck in some level then nothing happens.. and i actually have a super machine over here
2008-01-02T23:12:00.000Z	eoopy		no idea whats up with this installation
2008-01-02T23:13:00.000Z	Kasplatt	eoopy	then I don't know what could be wrong :s , sorry but I don't think I can help you .
