2012-10-08T09:03:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Hey guys.
2012-10-08T09:04:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		I recently got a new computer and installed Ubuntu on it.
2012-10-08T09:04:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		It has 2 hard drives, a solid state and a regular drive.
2012-10-08T09:04:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		The intention was to install Ubuntu to the SSD, which I did and then install everything else onto the 1TB extra HDD.
2012-10-08T09:04:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		But for some reason, everything is being installed to SSD. What do I do to fix it?
2012-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	Are you saying that you want your /home directory to be on the large drive and your system binaries to be on the ssd? Is that what you're getting at?
2012-10-08T09:08:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	So that your movies and music and all that is on the big one?
2012-10-08T09:09:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	bobo37773	that's exactly right.
2012-10-08T09:09:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	Gotcha. So first question: Did you encrypt your system at install time?
2012-10-08T09:12:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	bobo37773	nope
2012-10-08T09:13:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	Okay that's good. Now there are a couple of things that we are going to need to do. What is on the big drive now? Is it empty or does it have something on it?
2012-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	bobo37773	apparently it is empty?
2012-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	Okay. So this is not a dual boot or anything right?
2012-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	bobo37773	nope
2012-10-08T09:16:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	OKay good. Do you know how to use pastebin or other pasting services? Going to assume yes. I want you to run a couple of commands for me in the terminal and paste the output okay
2012-10-08T09:16:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	bobo37773	sure thing. :)
2012-10-08T09:16:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	bobo37773	can we do this in PM?
2012-10-08T09:17:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	Yeah it would actually probably make a lot more sense hahaha pm me
2012-10-08T10:38:00.000Z	bobo37773	Shazer[2]	you there?
