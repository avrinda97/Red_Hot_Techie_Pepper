2010-02-23T09:46:00.000Z	Leemp		Odd question. I'm using one of the older generation Mac Pros (2006 time range, x2 Dual Core Xeons). I need to upgrade my Gfx card to something with better Linux drivers, but Mac limits your options. Any idea if that is OSX specific, and Linux has no limitations? Or does all the talk about custom firmware on the graphics cards actually matter?
2010-02-23T09:46:00.000Z	Leemp		(Suppose this is more linux oriented, not ubuntu specific.. hmm)
2010-02-23T09:47:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	you might try #Linux
2010-02-23T09:51:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	which is that? *stuck in the past*
2010-02-23T09:51:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	Heroes of Newerth. I personally haven't seen too many commercial linux games i've been interested in. So im pumped for this hehe, that and i really want to show it in their linux stats
2010-02-23T09:52:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	*is googling...*
2010-02-23T09:53:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	Yup
2010-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	Yea, i really enjoyed DotA. I didn't find it amazing, but it was fun. Like Footies (i probably enjoyed that more). Either way HoN has ladders, competitive rankings, etc.
2010-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	I'm not even familiar with any other, non-fps, commercial linux games.
2010-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	Eve was the only one i even care about, but they dropped linux. Grr.
2010-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	NWN is a commercial Linux game
2010-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	Open beta for HoN right now, for the next 3* hours
2010-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	I'm into multi player, never could handle single player
2010-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	But thats good to know, i didn't know :o
2010-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	You know NWN has multiplayer?
2010-02-23T09:56:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	No i didn't, what type?
2010-02-23T09:57:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	I am going to PM you so we can keep this channel on topic
2010-02-23T10:02:00.000Z	Sarrasine	Leemp	please remember that Enter is not considered punctuation. =O
2010-02-23T10:02:00.000Z	Leemp	Sarrasine	It's not the enter key that is the problem. It's my train of thought. Or rather, many, small, and fast trains of thought.
