2004-11-09T06:34:00.000Z	gruberman		Why are the Debian folks so bitchy about ubuntu?
2004-11-09T06:35:00.000Z	stvn	gruberman	they are? I guess they prefer 'real' debian over all the derivatives
2004-11-09T06:38:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	Sorry, didn't mean to say EVERYONE :)
2004-11-09T06:39:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	But alot of them
2004-11-09T06:40:00.000Z	stvn	gruberman	ah well, they're just jealous ;)
2004-11-09T08:25:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	Gah, I was hoping to see my nick in Irssi :)
2004-11-09T08:26:00.000Z	stvn	gruberman	aw, it had scrolled out of sight ;)
2004-11-09T08:26:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	Yeah right... :)
2004-11-09T08:27:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	thats closer to the thruth

2004-11-09T08:29:00.000Z	stvn	gruberman	which one?
2004-11-09T08:30:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	the Irssi one

2004-11-09T08:31:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	ok
2004-11-10T08:06:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	they're great but consumes too much memory
2004-11-10T08:07:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	and you can't compress them either
2004-11-12T08:08:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	there will be alot of questions about x.org when hoary is released :)
2004-11-12T08:09:00.000Z	stvn	gruberman	indeed
2004-11-12T08:09:00.000Z	gruberman	stvn	I think I will wait too.
