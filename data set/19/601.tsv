2011-11-26T17:38:00.000Z	Anomie21_		Anyone able to assist? Downloaded and installed the .deb packet from here as I have no internet connection. (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/i386/linux-source-3.0.0/3.0.0-13.22). Tried to install it via the software centre but 'Install' was greyed out. Installed via dpkg -i, now shows as 'Installed' in the software centre but when I use 'apt-cache policy linux source' it says Installed (none)
2011-11-26T17:39:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	what are you trying to do? Building kernel from source?
2011-11-26T17:42:00.000Z	Anomie21_	Atlantic777	install linux-sources so I can make files
2011-11-26T18:01:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	why don't you build kernel image on pc with internet connection and just move it to the laptop? :D This is linux, you can do this if cpu/sys is the same for both systems.
2011-11-26T18:03:00.000Z	Anomie21_	Atlantic777	seems like a lot of hassle just to be able to install programs. (still dont know why ubuntu doesnt come with this by default). Is there no way of sharing my connection on this laptop with my PC via an ethernet cable?
2011-11-26T18:04:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	sure there is. You can share it if you have available networking interface on the machine "with internet".
2011-11-26T18:06:00.000Z	Anomie21_	Atlantic777	think I'm just going to abandon it and go back to xp lol
2011-11-26T18:06:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	no, no, no, wait! :D
2011-11-26T18:06:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	just  a moment, to fix something. :D
2011-11-26T18:06:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	because you need build-essential
2011-11-26T18:07:00.000Z	Anomie21_	Atlantic777	and why isnt that bundled? seems kinda important lol
2011-11-26T18:07:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	nope, ubuntu is for human beeings. Humans don't compile. xD
2011-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	packages.ubuntu.com
2011-11-26T18:12:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	let's firstly fix internet sharing, it will be easier than doing manual dependency resolution. :D
2011-11-26T18:13:00.000Z	Anomie21_	Atlantic777	It was just a rhethorical situation, I dont have a ethernet cable handy :(
2011-11-26T18:13:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	how do you connect to internet with computer you are using atm?
2011-11-26T18:13:00.000Z	Anomie21_	Atlantic777	wifi tethering to my iphone
2011-11-26T18:14:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	ummm... and wifi on laptop isn't working? :/
2011-11-26T18:15:00.000Z	Atlantic777	Anomie21_	no, you need a driver, and driver is either compiled into the kernel or used as kernel module.
