2011-05-19T15:59:00.000Z	cousin_mario		how can I persuade grub2 to scan other linux installation partitions to be added to the menu?
2011-05-19T16:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	what linux installs are you trying to detect?
2011-05-19T16:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	do you know which partition it is?
2011-05-19T16:01:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ThinkT510	of course
2011-05-19T16:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	excellent, then you can add it manually under /etc/grub.d/
2011-05-19T16:01:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ThinkT510	I'm not sure how.
2011-05-19T16:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	i'll walk you through it
2011-05-19T16:02:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ThinkT510	thanks
2011-05-19T16:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	you'll need to edit the file as sudo: so do the following: sudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom
2011-05-19T16:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	then add this to the end of the file: http://paste.ubuntu.com/610024/
2011-05-19T16:05:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	edit it accordingly
2011-05-19T16:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	after doing that run sudo update-grub (or grub-update, i never remember which way round it is)
2011-05-19T16:06:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ThinkT510	doesn't the chainloader work only when there is another bootloader installed?
2011-05-19T16:06:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ThinkT510	in other words, won't I also have to install grub1 in the opensuse partition?
2011-05-19T16:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	there likely will be in your root partition
2011-05-19T16:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	try it and see if it works
2011-05-19T16:07:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ThinkT510	ok, thanks
2011-05-19T16:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	cousin_mario	no worries :)
