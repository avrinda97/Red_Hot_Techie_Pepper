2007-01-09T08:34:00.000Z	Vuen		hey guys
2007-01-09T08:34:00.000Z	Vuen		i had an extra monitor lying around, so i just set up multiple monitors with xinerama on my ubuntu
2007-01-09T08:34:00.000Z	Vuen		which was a huge pain to set up, but it seems to work now
2007-01-09T08:35:00.000Z	Vuen		so far, i'm underwhelmed. full-screen games entirely crash the X server when they try to run, and the whole thing just seems really sluggish
2007-01-09T08:35:00.000Z	Vuen		it seems to not want to repaint windows, and when it does it's very slow...
2007-01-09T08:35:00.000Z	Vuen		is this normal?
2007-01-09T08:35:00.000Z	Vuen		is xinerama supposed to be this slow?
2007-01-09T08:35:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	what video card?
2007-01-09T08:36:00.000Z	Vuen	overridex	geforce 6600
2007-01-09T08:36:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	then no, it definitely shouldn't be like that :)
2007-01-09T08:36:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	use "twinview" in nvidia's drivers to setup dual monitors
2007-01-09T08:36:00.000Z	Vuen	overridex	alright
2007-01-09T08:36:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	i was able to play world of warcraft on one full screen monitor and play a dvd on the other without a problem when i used twinview...
2007-01-09T08:37:00.000Z	Vuen	overridex	wow. yeah, i want that
2007-01-09T08:37:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	i was using a gf 5900 at the time
2007-01-09T08:37:00.000Z	Vuen	overridex	are you still using twinview? if so, can you pastebin your xorg.conf for me, pretty please? :)
2007-01-09T08:38:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	i'm not or a i would... i got a nice widescreen lcd and need to get another :)
2007-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	Vuen	overridex	alright, i set up twinview, restarting X. wish me luck...
2007-01-09T08:41:00.000Z	overridex	Vuen	good luck
