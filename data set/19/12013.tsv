2006-03-16T11:20:00.000Z	axisys		i stripped the song to get only middle 29 secs which is 455K.. might be too big for ringtone
2006-03-16T11:20:00.000Z	axisys		any thoughts?
2006-03-16T11:20:00.000Z	jbroome	axisys	drop the bitrate
2006-03-16T11:22:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	let me try
2006-03-16T11:28:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	it shows AUDIO: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, s16le, 128.0 kbit/9.07% (ratio: 16000->176400) when playing with mplayer
2006-03-16T11:29:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	would u know how to change the 128 to lower using mplayer/mencoder?
2006-03-16T11:29:00.000Z	jbroome	axisys	i usually do that in audacity
2006-03-16T11:33:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	i change it in audacity and then want to play the new one and it does not play
2006-11-21T09:40:00.000Z	jbroome	axisys	i haven't had to do anything to get mice working
2006-11-21T09:41:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	hmm.. may be mouse battery dead..
2006-11-21T09:41:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	on the back the light is not on even after i change them
2006-11-21T09:42:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	probably.. or old battery :P
2006-11-21T10:36:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	my wireless mouse is working now.. yeaahh!
2006-11-21T10:37:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	i had to unscrew the mouse .. clear the joints where it was rusty and now it works
2008-06-17T23:57:00.000Z	jbroome	axisys	run sudo apt-get update and it will let you know if there are new packages available
2008-06-17T23:57:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	oh i c.. as a cronjob
2008-06-17T23:58:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	will it say in the terminal screen or i have to check the messages file after running apt-get update?
2008-06-17T23:59:00.000Z	jbroome	axisys	check out apticron, it'll email you about any updates
2008-06-17T23:59:00.000Z	axisys	jbroome	sweet!
