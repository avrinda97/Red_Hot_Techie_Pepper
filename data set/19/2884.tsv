2009-12-06T01:51:00.000Z	Y_Guy		I need some help using mysql on ubuntu server edition - not sure how to get to the promt, giving me errors such as "can't use socket"
2009-12-06T01:52:00.000Z	Y_Guy		yes im remote
2009-12-06T01:52:00.000Z	Y_Guy		what's the command to do so?
2009-12-06T01:53:00.000Z	Y_Guy		thanks furythor
2009-12-06T01:54:00.000Z	guntbert	Y_Guy	edit /etc/mysql/my.conf, put a # infront of the line containing bind-address           = 127.0.0.1
2009-12-06T01:56:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	same error
2009-12-06T01:59:00.000Z	guntbert	Y_Guy	there was a misinterpretation on my side: please have a look into the logs on the server (in /var/log/mysql)
2009-12-06T02:01:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	I looked in the logs - there's nothing there
2009-12-06T02:01:00.000Z	guntbert	Y_Guy	nothing? is the directory not there? is it empty? are the files empty?
2009-12-06T02:01:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	directory is there, but empty
2009-12-06T02:02:00.000Z	guntbert	Y_Guy	then please look into /var/log/syslog
2009-12-06T02:02:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	will do
2009-12-06T02:03:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	what am i looking for exactly
2009-12-06T02:04:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	possible - i have barely touched it
2009-12-06T02:09:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	furythor - I'm trying to install phpbb3 - it still doesn't detect a database
2009-12-06T02:10:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	I'm almost done - would rather not do that
2009-12-06T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	Y_Guy	understandable - but beyond my experience
2009-12-06T02:13:00.000Z	guntbert	Y_Guy	Good luck :-)
2009-12-06T02:13:00.000Z	Y_Guy	guntbert	thanks :)
