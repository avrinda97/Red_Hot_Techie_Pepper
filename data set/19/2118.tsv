2010-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		It's temporary, but it works.
2010-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		well,
2010-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		What happens,
2010-06-29T03:16:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		with an ATI Radeon X1270, or other cards (I don't know), graphics corruption occurs right after the drive formats during installation, and doesn't fix until a restart. It also happens when your in the normal desktop. I just added nomodeset to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX, and then updated grub.cfg, and it worked.
2010-06-29T03:17:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		yes,
2010-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		then also on the actual installation.
2010-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		I double checked the MD5Sum,
2010-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		and also checked my USB stick
2010-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		it also happens on all of my other USB drives,
2010-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent		and on CDs and DVDs.
2010-06-29T03:19:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	PoisonSerpent	i found that to get things to work right i needed to do a full hdd install
2010-06-29T03:19:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent	ChrazRitt	That is what I did. Wiped my hard drive and installed it.
2010-06-29T03:40:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	PoisonSerpent	did you try the sound settings? system>preferences>sound
2010-06-29T03:41:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent	ChrazRitt	the only input/output it picks up is Internal Analog Audio Stereo,
2010-06-29T03:42:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	PoisonSerpent	did you try the hardware tab?
2010-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	PoisonSerpent	did you look at the 'input' tab?
2010-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent	ChrazRitt	yes.
2010-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	PoisonSerpent	ChrazRitt	yes.
