2007-04-20T09:02:00.000Z	rellik_		if I want to upgrade to the latest stable release of ubuntu, is it 'apt-get install dist-upgrade'?  do I have to change the lines in my sources.list that all say 'dapper' ?
2007-04-20T09:03:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	No!  *Don't* do that, you'll almost certainly break something.
2007-04-20T09:03:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	Note that you *have* to upgrade through Edgy.
2007-04-20T09:03:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	pppoe_dude thanks
2007-04-20T09:04:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	so I have to upgrade to edgy, then to feisty?
2007-04-20T09:04:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	Yes.  Basically, you just have to run "update-manager" twice :)
2007-04-20T09:08:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	how can I confirm that I am running 6.06?
2007-04-20T09:10:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	By running "lsb_release --release" - It should return "6.06"
2007-04-20T09:11:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	ah, thanks..  one last question..  is there a non-gui version of update-manager?  I'm doing this over SSH
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	I don't think so.  Also, trying to upgrade your stuff over SSH is a recipie for misery :)
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	I have remote console access, in case SSH fails
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	You mean, you can go an physically get to the machine?
2007-04-20T09:13:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	no I don't have physical access to the machine. but the hosting provider provides remote console access, in case you mess up your firewall or lock yourself out someone..  it's an AJAX terminal
2007-04-20T09:14:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	What about if your Dapper->Edgy or Edgy->Feisty upgrade results in your network connection being broken?
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	the remote console doesn't rely on the host's internet connection..  the remote console sits on a seperate server, and connects as a terminal.  just like a console
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	Oooh, cool.
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	yeah it's very nice
2007-04-20T09:16:00.000Z	RAOF	rellik_	I don't *think* there's a CLI version of the update-manager, but you could just use X forwarding?
2007-04-20T09:17:00.000Z	rellik_	RAOF	yeah, I will try x-forwarding..  not ideal but ok :)
