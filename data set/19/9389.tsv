2008-04-06T17:10:00.000Z	ac3		Hi, i´m trying to boot my workstations from an nfs server, but i always get a kernel panic, just as described on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/181258
2008-04-06T17:11:00.000Z	ac3		kernel version is 2.6.24-14-generic
2008-04-06T17:11:00.000Z	Twigathy	ac3	ahha, I use root over NFS
2008-04-06T17:11:00.000Z	Twigathy		It's network manager getting in the way last time I checked
2008-04-06T17:12:00.000Z	Twigathy	ac3	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/OnNFSDriveWithLocalBoot <-- the stuff about network manager might help you there
2008-04-06T17:14:00.000Z	ac3	Twigathy	thx, but it does not solve the problem
2008-04-06T17:15:00.000Z	Twigathy		hm, interesting
2008-04-06T17:15:00.000Z	Twigathy	ac3	that's the exact same message I got before fiddling with network mangler.... maybe something else is messing with your eth0?
2008-04-06T17:16:00.000Z	ac3	Twigathy	i´l retry from scratch, maybe i did something wrong
2008-04-06T17:21:00.000Z	ac3	Twigathy	no luck, i created a new install on my nfs server with debootstrap, and still the same error message. Networkmanager is not even installed
2008-04-06T17:21:00.000Z	Twigathy		weird
2008-04-06T17:21:00.000Z	Twigathy		It's definiately something which is messing with your ethernet though - that's the message I got when eth0 was brought down and back up again, of course losing connection with the NFS server ;)
2008-04-06T17:21:00.000Z	ac3		i do have BOOT=auto in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
2008-04-06T17:22:00.000Z	ac3		could that be the problem
2008-04-06T17:22:00.000Z	ac3		should i fix this to nfs?
2008-04-06T17:22:00.000Z	Twigathy		you ought to set that to BOOT=nfs, yeah
2008-04-06T17:29:00.000Z	ac3	Twigathy	same error:(
2008-04-06T17:47:00.000Z	ac3	Twigathy	which howto dit you follow?
2008-04-06T17:50:00.000Z	Twigathy	ac3	I wrote the NFS with local boot howto, and that worked okay for me
