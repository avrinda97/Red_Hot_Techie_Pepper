2008-08-12T22:29:00.000Z	Paavi2_0		hello, i tried to resize the 1st partition on my usb-flash/stick/memory (/dev/sdb) and would've liked to create a second one, but gparted complains: http://paste.ubuntu.com/36910/ i've got billix on this stick and have done: 'install-mbr -p1 /dev/sdb' and 'syslinux -s /dev/sdb1' ...any other ways to create a second partition on usb-memorystick?
2008-08-12T22:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	what is your end goal here
2008-08-12T22:31:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	to resize /dev/sdb1 down to 256Mib and create /dev/sdb2 on remaining empty space
2008-08-12T22:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	this is to make a bootable usb flash key then?
2008-08-12T22:33:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	i've already made it bootable with install-mbr and syslinux
2008-08-12T22:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	so your end goal is to boot a linux from usb?
2008-08-12T22:34:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	the goal is to use the second partition to save session data into if needed
2008-08-12T22:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	usb persistent?
2008-08-12T22:35:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	what do you mean?
2008-08-12T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	simply to boot from a live usb but have the ability to save changes made
2008-08-12T22:37:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	yes. for example dsl contained on that usb-stick seems to be unable to save data on the same partition it was launched from :( or i'm just too newbie. :/
2008-08-12T22:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	/msg ubottu usb for some links on that
2008-08-12T22:38:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	thanks!
2008-08-12T22:45:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	the thing i really wanted to know was, does install-mbr screw up file system in such way that it becomes bigger than its volume?
2008-08-12T22:46:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	what guide are you following
2008-08-12T22:48:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	i'm not following any guide, i'd just like to succesfully "split" an usb-stick into two partitions. libparted is complaining that my "file system doesn't have expected sizes for windows to like it." D: not funny at all  :(
2008-08-12T22:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	you may want to read the usb link or check www.pendrivelinux.com doing it via the command line is easier imo
2008-08-12T22:52:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	bazhang	did you understand that my issue has actually directly nothing to do with installing linux on an usb-stick? i said i've succesfully installed billix on that drive and wasn't able to shrink a partition and create a second one on that very same stick
2008-08-12T22:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Paavi2_0	not sure; are you doing this via ubuntu? you want to have billix (another distro?) be a live usb persistent?
