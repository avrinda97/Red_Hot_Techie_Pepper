2010-01-05T14:05:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	you have to start wireshark with gksudo
2010-01-05T14:06:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	already beat you to it.. cheers :)
2010-01-05T14:06:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	nice :)
2010-01-05T14:26:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	what is your goal?
2010-01-05T14:27:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	and by what user if possible
2010-01-05T14:28:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	start with lsof -i - that shows you open/listening connections
2010-01-05T14:32:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	hmm. not really what im after.. but close.. i have a file on this machine, and its being streamed (divx) and watched on another machine.. im trying to find which file it actually is.. winxp had the feature.. its mainly incase im sharing a directory i shouldnt be.. its all read only, but yer.. you get the idea
2010-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	in that case you can use fuser /path/to/file to see what process has the file open, and then investigate further (lsof might be helpful too, but you have to look at the man pages...)
2010-01-05T14:36:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	cheers..
2010-01-05T14:37:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	:)

2010-01-05T15:53:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	thx for reporting back
2010-01-05T17:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	well said
2010-01-05T17:44:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	heh.. i try my best... AND im not drunk tonight.. thats always a bonus.
2010-01-05T17:46:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	oh ffs.. i got that the same time as you.. heh.. im on a role tonight of finding stuff myself !!
2010-01-05T17:55:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	isobuster works under wine according to the wiki.. which is fairly cool... and could make a script to mount a .iso file fairly easy too..
2010-01-05T17:56:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	why on earth don't you just sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> ? nothing could be easier!
2010-01-05T17:58:00.000Z	Quan-Time	guntbert	yes, BUT when i have a non .iso file. i need to convert it
2010-01-05T17:59:00.000Z	guntbert	Quan-Time	please don't go the long way round - but thats only me :-)
