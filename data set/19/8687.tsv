2007-02-25T08:26:00.000Z	Shrimpy		i have a problem, any body want to try and tackle this with me?
2007-02-25T08:27:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	depends what it is mate
2007-02-25T08:29:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	what did you mess with
2007-02-25T08:30:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	you need to find what was the last file you were messing with
2007-02-25T08:31:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	if you can find out for me what file it is you messed with I can help you a bit easier
2007-02-25T08:37:00.000Z	Shrimpy	nutterpc	i would shake your hand on that guess.
2007-02-25T08:38:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	I know ubuntu once you set it up right doesn't give you any hassles
2007-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	well, what you need to do now, is look for the backup you said you made of the .asoundrc file
2007-02-25T08:40:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	its normally in your home folder
2007-02-25T08:43:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	as soon as I get some things finished on my lappy, I'll be able to help others boost ubuntu up a bit
2007-02-25T08:44:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	set nautilus to show hidden files
2007-02-25T08:46:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	only thing I can suggest is to look thru all the folders you can remember going thru, but, this time, to find all the files in them, use xterm
2007-02-25T08:55:00.000Z	Shrimpy	nutterpc	i found asoundrc
2007-02-25T08:57:00.000Z	Shrimpy	nutterpc	it seems i made two files there.   asound.conf     and     asound.confg
2007-02-25T09:00:00.000Z	Shrimpy	nutterpc	those are the only files. and one is a lot larger then the other. also i don't know if i ned to rename it. and also what do i do to make it that one. (for example i am going to save both files on a flash drive. and then deploy one of them. (but i dont know what i would do
2007-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	open them up and have a look, compare whats in them against the original .asoundrc
2007-02-25T09:02:00.000Z	Shrimpy	nutterpc	crap the files are .asound    so does this mean i still need to find asoundrc?
2007-02-25T09:06:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	I would stay and help ya a bit more dude, but I have to go to work
2007-02-25T09:07:00.000Z	nutterpc	Shrimpy	when I get paid time and a half, I ain't complaining
