2007-10-18T12:01:00.000Z	heartsblood		Does anybody know if FAKEraid is part of the Gutsy install package?
2007-10-18T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	You'll want the alternate CD
2007-10-18T12:02:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	I was wondering about that, the alternate cd has the dmraid package?
2007-10-18T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	yeah, alternate CD has support for RAIDs and LVM and stuff like that
2007-10-18T12:03:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	do you know where I could find the gutsy alternate x86_84 alternate image?
2007-10-18T12:03:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	Gutsy isn't released yet, but the alternate images are in the same places as the desktop images
2007-10-18T12:04:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	no?  I read that somebody was downloading the gutsy alternate image a couple days ago.
2007-10-18T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	that was the RC, final is being released sometime within the next 24 hours or so
2007-10-18T12:05:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	Would it be bad to download the RC?  I would really like to get my server back online.
2007-10-18T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	the RC will be more or less the same, some packages might change, but its no different than downloading the final in a week, and needing some upgrades to get up-to-date
2007-10-18T12:07:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	I have no problem with that.
2007-10-18T12:07:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	actually, at the moment you might not be able to get the RC iso, just because theyre preparing for final.  Let me look.
2007-10-18T12:08:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	Just as you said that I noticed the dir was empty
2007-10-18T12:08:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	:(
2007-10-18T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/gutsy-alternate-amd64.iso ought to do it for you
2007-10-18T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	if you append .torrent to the end of that, you'll get the torrent, which may or may not be faster
2007-10-18T12:12:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	I didn't think about that, ty again sir.
2007-10-18T12:17:00.000Z	heartsblood	Flannel	Wow the torrent was a huge improvement.  done already, ty again sir!
2007-10-20T02:51:00.000Z	Flannel	heartsblood	Its a free flash, yes.  The big announcement is it works with youtube now
