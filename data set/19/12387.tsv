2005-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	NightBird		hey, if apt-get update doesn't like the online sources, what should I do?
2005-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	NightBird		bur[n] er, I've tried several times..
2005-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	NightBird		the default ones don't work right
2005-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	put your sources.list up on the pastebin (i.e., not here)
2005-09-15T09:46:00.000Z	NightBird	HappyFool	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2063
2005-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	you need main and restricted too
2005-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	the second link in what ubotu has sent you has an example 'sources.list' file which you can use
2005-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	NightBird	HappyFool	I'm getting a bunch of 302 Moved errors..
2005-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	on what URL, e.g. ?
2005-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	from the 'example' sources.list, you mean?
2005-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	stand-by
2005-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	i'm browsing archive.ubuntu.com fine; let me try the Release and Packages.gz files
2005-09-15T09:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	can you browse this url http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/Release in firefox?
2005-09-15T09:57:00.000Z	NightBird	HappyFool	I'm unable to bring up graphics mode
2005-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	hmm
2005-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	ok, try   wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/Release
2005-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	you can maybe use the http_proxy variable to specify a web-proxy to use; you may even be able to add a username password to the url (I can't remember the syntax)
2005-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	NightBird	if it's a windows-only proxy, you can install ntlmaps (download the .deb, and use dpkg to install it)
2005-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	NightBird	HappyFool	it's not what I would call a proxy really..
