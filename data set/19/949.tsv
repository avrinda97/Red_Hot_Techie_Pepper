2011-10-01T02:55:00.000Z	in0cula		yes i tried VLC, no luck
2011-10-01T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	try gnome-mplayer
2011-10-01T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	also add the medibuntu ppa and install w32codecs (I assume 32bit OS)
2012-03-05T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	did you setup the drivers and such for the USB device?
2012-03-05T20:11:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	when i have enabled my wifi in the bios i can connect with the usb wifi without problem
2012-03-05T20:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	I thought you said you could connect via the usb ok?...
2012-03-05T20:23:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	yes i can if i enable the bios
2012-03-05T20:25:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	i want to disable the internal wifi because i don't need it, because i go well with the usb wifi, but when i disable it via bios even the  usb disappear from networkmanager....if i do iwconfig is ther bu i cannot use it to connect because networkmanager ignore it
2012-03-05T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	if you unplug it the n plug it back in once booted, does it help?
2012-03-05T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	obviously when the internel is disabled.
2012-03-05T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	if the internel is a mini-pci device you could just unplug it
2012-03-05T20:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	you could blacklist  the driver for the inbuilt device
2012-03-05T20:30:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	cuold you please tell me how to find the right wifi card and how to block it?
2012-03-05T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	with the internal enabled, boot the OS and run:  sudo lshw -C network     look for the words:  driver=      you can then blacklist that driver by running:  echo "blacklist foo" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf     change footo the actual module name
2012-03-05T20:34:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	thank you very much, i'll do it. thx
2012-03-05T20:46:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	THX it worked, in this manner the wifi is OFF, don't emit any signals right? iwconfig has only the usb. good job
2012-03-05T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	sweet :)
2012-09-13T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	in0cula	use /etc/network/interfaces to configure the ethernet and let network manager manage the wifi (one way to do it)
2012-09-13T15:02:00.000Z	in0cula	ActionParsnip	good idea, I'll do it now
