2011-01-04T19:11:00.000Z	bencahill		Hey guys, I have bad audio on my 10.10 system when cpu is high, e.g. when playing a flash video, or doing something else at the same time as vlc. Any ideas?
2011-01-04T19:12:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	get in a position where your audio gets bad and give us the result of "top"
2011-01-04T19:12:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	ok...
2011-01-04T19:15:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	hmm, how should I give you the result of top, > test gives funny stuff, probably because it's live ??
2011-01-04T19:15:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	tip "top" and then CTRL + C
2011-01-04T19:16:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	then copy past the 5 first lines and post them with pastebin
2011-01-04T19:16:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	ok, that will work :)

2011-01-04T19:18:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	wow, what is your CPU ?
2011-01-04T19:19:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	sempron 3200+ :D
2011-01-04T19:21:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	I noticed that if I play, e.g., an mp3 in vlc, it's fine until I start doing other resource-heavy things (like loading new pages in ff) at the same time, at which it has the same garbled sound
2011-01-04T19:22:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	ok, that explains it ^^... arf I would recomand using a lighter system, not having any effect on your desktop.... stuff like that
2011-01-04T19:23:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	ok, ubuntu works fine with everything else I do, and is not too slow, it's just the garbled audio... :)
2011-01-04T19:24:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	well I plan on getting a new system with a 1055t in the near future, so I shouldn't have any problems then :-D
2011-01-04T19:24:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	if it's only audio related I can't help you sorry, but I believe that you shouldn't use vlc + firefox at the same time, too much load
2011-01-04T19:25:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	and if you want to listen to music, rhythmbox is lighter I guess
2011-01-04T19:26:00.000Z	bencahill	mrgalerien	yeah, vlc works fine, it's just that I can't play youtube videos (ff) without garbled sound. grr...
2011-01-04T19:27:00.000Z	mrgalerien	bencahill	my only guess is that you need a lighter system or a faster processor ^^ sorry
