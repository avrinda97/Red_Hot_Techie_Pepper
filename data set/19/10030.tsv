2008-01-22T03:42:00.000Z	bjames		does anyone know how to mount a pfs.img file?  this is part of my router firmware, file does not give any useful information, so I'm not holding any high hopes
2008-01-22T03:42:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	there are some tools that can convert .img to .iso
2008-01-22T03:42:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	are they not just for iso9660 format?
2008-01-22T03:47:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	look for knock
2008-01-22T03:47:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	look for knockd
2008-01-22T03:48:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	will do
2008-01-22T03:50:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	I don't understand exactly what knockd pages are telling me
2008-01-22T03:51:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	knockd will tell your server to open ports if you know the secret knocks
2008-01-22T03:51:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	just like your magic WOL packet would do
2008-01-22T03:51:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	I want my server to Wake-on-LAN
2008-01-22T03:52:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	are they? I thought they were just link-layer packets and therefore local
2008-01-22T03:53:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	as I understand it they are broadcast packets
2008-01-22T03:54:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	you were right and I was not completely wrong
2008-01-22T03:55:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	that's the badger
2008-01-22T03:55:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	I need to either get OpenWRT/DD-WRT/whatever onto my router, or get a new router with it on to do what I want
2008-01-22T03:57:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	I have a spare cisco monster for you ;)
2008-01-22T03:57:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	of course :)
2008-01-22T04:00:00.000Z	bjames	Seveas	I'm currently in "discussion" with Belkin (soon to also be Philips and SMC who make compatible firmware) to release GPL code
2008-01-22T04:00:00.000Z	Seveas	bjames	nice
