2006-10-02T13:42:00.000Z	deep__		umm
2006-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	deep__		Hey, does anyone know anything about the serverinstall of ubuntu?
2006-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	what, in particular? I have a server running it. :)
2006-10-02T13:44:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	i was wondering what firewall its using?
2006-10-02T13:44:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	that I wouldn't know. It's behind another firewall here, never messed with it.
2006-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	I would guess it just uses iptables, and you can use various frontends/guis to manage it.
2006-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	read something about 'firestarter' for a GUI, but I don't use X.
2006-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	"The Ubuntu Server has no open ports after the installation", the site sais. ^^
2006-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	and i wont be usint X
2006-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	i want to control everything by ssh. :)
2006-10-02T13:46:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	same here. ;-)
2006-10-02T13:46:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	might've been an installation-choice, but I have no iptables-policies.
2006-10-02T13:47:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	ah, okay. But i want a firewall, an easy firewall (aka not iptables), you know anyone? :)
2006-10-02T13:48:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	sorry, I use init-scripts w/ iptables-rules, sorry. :-)
2006-10-02T13:49:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	okay. :)
2006-10-02T13:49:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	you probably want something web-based, I haven't seen a curses- or CLI-based UI for iptables.
2006-10-02T13:50:00.000Z	deep__	daxxar	I can probably learn iptables or something. :P
2006-10-02T13:51:00.000Z	daxxar	deep__	you could look at shorewall (http://www.shorewall.net) or fireHOL (http://firehol.sourceforge.net/) - but I have no prior experience with either
