2007-07-15T07:18:00.000Z	wifenfeffer		Hi, I want to install the most current version of gmpc, what's the best way to do that ?
2007-07-15T07:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	Find the site and download it? ;-)
2007-07-15T07:19:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	it has a couple packages I'd need to update as well, plus, I'd rather install it from a repository.
2007-07-15T07:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	By the looks of thing there isn't a repo. You can checkinstall it tho.
2007-07-15T07:19:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	what's checkinstall ?
2007-07-15T07:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	Instead of ./configure && make && sudo make install             you do        ./configure && make && sudo checkinstall
2007-07-15T07:20:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	aah
2007-07-15T07:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	It creates a .deb package and installs it, so it can be managed as if it came from a repo, and easily remove/upgraded
2007-07-15T07:21:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	so can I do that with all the libraries that gmpc 0.15 requires ?
2007-07-15T07:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	Just libmpd I thought?
2007-07-15T07:22:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	a few others are outdated
2007-07-15T07:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	You might want to check out sonata, gmpc is pretty awful.
2007-07-15T07:22:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	I need profiles, I have a few mpd servers running here, and want this ubuntu machine to be able to use them all
2007-07-15T07:23:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	but I can do that with libraries too, right ?
2007-07-15T07:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	Correct.
2007-07-15T07:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	wifenfeffer	Again, I think you only need libmpd.
2007-07-15T07:23:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	thanks :)
2007-07-15T07:23:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	I'll try it and see
2007-07-15T07:23:00.000Z	wifenfeffer	Stormx2	thanks :)
