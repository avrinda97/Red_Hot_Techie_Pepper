2006-05-05T11:11:00.000Z	monomaniacpat		anyone know what the -p means in 'mkdir -p'?
2006-05-05T11:12:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	parent, if I do mkdir -p /foo/bar and /foo doesn't exist it'll create it
2006-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	some programs only have makefiles - check the INSTALL and README files
2006-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	it doesn't have an install file and the only readme says it comes preconfigured :\
2006-07-08T05:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	then type 'make'
2006-07-08T05:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	you might want to look a the makefile
2006-07-08T05:07:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	make: *** No targets.  Stop. - the makefile doesn't say much
2006-07-08T05:08:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	what package is it?
2006-07-08T05:08:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	an xpad driver
2006-07-08T05:09:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	here's the makefile (it is simply called "makefile") http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17456
2006-07-08T05:11:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	hmm, there must be another file to run or something
2006-07-08T05:11:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	can you pastebin me 'find -ls' ?
2006-07-08T05:12:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	hang on
2006-07-08T05:13:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17457
2006-07-08T05:14:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	anything of note in Kconfig?
2006-07-08T05:17:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	I did have a look at that, I don't think so *checks again* here's the text: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17458
2006-07-08T05:18:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	I suspect that it's alla actually ment to be made part of a kernel tree. You'll have to figure out the rest on your own
2006-07-08T05:19:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	bbrazil	it was inside a kernel tree, actually, but there are hardly any other files there...
2006-07-08T05:19:00.000Z	bbrazil	monomaniacpat	it's not going to work outside of one
