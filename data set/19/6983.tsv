2007-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	John_R		it tried to upgrade your whole distro
2007-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	John_R		you update your sources.list with the proper repository
2007-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	John_R		then apt-get update
2007-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	John_R		and apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	tag	John_R	My understanding (and experience) is that upgrading that way does not always work.
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	John_R		no tag it doesnt
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	John_R		it works with debian fairly well
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	John_R		fairly meaning not always
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	John_R		hhehe
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	tag	John_R	Right, I had debian croak on that a number of times :-)
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	John_R		yep
2007-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	John_R		it is better if you update your repositories, then apt-get update, then update the kernel only
2007-10-31T02:55:00.000Z	John_R		then do the dist-upgrade after
2007-10-31T02:55:00.000Z	tag		it even has gutsy in my sources.list, as a result of the cdrom being plugged in
2007-10-31T02:55:00.000Z	tag		what the update-manager does not seem to be realizing is that gutsy > fiesty
2007-10-31T02:56:00.000Z	tag		hurm
2007-10-31T02:57:00.000Z	tag	John_R	forcing the distribution label and then running update manager seems to have given it the hint to do a partial upgrade
2007-10-31T02:57:00.000Z	tag	John_R	I'm going to roll with it
2007-10-31T02:58:00.000Z	John_R	tag	sounds good
