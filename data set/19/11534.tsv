2006-01-04T11:44:00.000Z	doreiny		Package xmms is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-01-04T11:44:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	you need to enable your universe and multiverse repos
2006-01-04T11:57:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	did you enable the multiverse repos?
2006-01-04T11:57:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	and the universe repos?
2006-01-04T11:58:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	and did an apt-get update
2006-01-04T11:58:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	well either you didn't do one of those, or your sources.list is wrong
2006-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	only that you haven't enabled the multiverse repo for the security updates..
2006-01-04T12:04:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	you're also missing the  restricted and main repos
2006-01-04T12:05:00.000Z	doreiny	polpak	: i need to add a complate line's?
2006-01-04T12:12:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	and you are certain you're doing sudo apt-get update
2006-01-04T12:12:00.000Z	doreiny	polpak	yes dude
2006-01-04T12:13:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	cause the only other thing I can think is that it's not in the il repo
2006-01-04T12:13:00.000Z	polpak	doreiny	which doesn't make any sense
