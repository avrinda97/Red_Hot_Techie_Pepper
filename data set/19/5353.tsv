2012-11-06T18:18:00.000Z	Fuzzles		anyone know how to get blacklight retrubution working in wine?
2012-11-06T18:19:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	I think http://www.winehq.org might be a better help :)
2012-11-06T18:20:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=13983 - You might want to run winetricks before you install the game. apt-get install winetricks. Use it for installing directX and Visual C runtime
2012-11-06T18:21:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	so use the winetricks direct x and visual c instead of what comes with the game?
2012-11-06T18:21:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	You can use those too...
2012-11-06T18:22:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	Never tried the game, I just give the advice from past experience
2012-11-06T18:22:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	ok thanks what is winetricks exactly? like a front end for wine like playonlinux?
2012-11-06T18:22:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	Similar, yes, a bit older, and more limited, but helps sometimes
2012-11-06T18:23:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	ok thanks hopefully wine will make a big breakthrough sometime soon to hel alot of ppl like me haha
2012-11-06T18:23:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	It already went a great way, you couldn't imagine how hard it was before 1.0 :)
2012-11-06T18:24:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	you have a good point :) is it always best to sue the latiest dev version of wine?
2012-11-06T18:24:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	I do so
2012-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	Sometimes it 'breaks' things though
2012-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	But works ok for me more often
2012-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	ok thanks if i can get some of my games working on ubuntu i would gladly get rid of my windows partision
2012-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	Like earlier, before 1.3 I couldn't run Heroes of Might and Magic III with directX+Wine through network, now it works great
2012-11-06T18:27:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	did it take much tweaking?
2012-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	norbert79	Fuzzles	HoMM3? No, I had to install DirectX for DirectPlay8 with winetricks and then it started working.
2012-11-06T18:29:00.000Z	Fuzzles	norbert79	cool well done :)
