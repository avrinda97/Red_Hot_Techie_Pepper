2006-10-10T07:20:00.000Z	mnepton	savvas	the website is sadly uninformative. but basically, it's a curses torrent client written in Python. and with a few more features than the mailine BT client.
2006-10-10T07:21:00.000Z	savvas		oh ok thank you :)
2006-10-10T07:21:00.000Z	mnepton	savvas	how's your httpd-fu? could you get apache and php running on your local machine without problems?
2006-10-10T07:21:00.000Z	savvas		well i suppose
2006-10-10T07:21:00.000Z	savvas		there's always the xampp package if i can't :P
2006-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	mnepton	savvas	i use this. it uses btornado as the backend, and is easily administerable from a browser. - http://www.torrentflux.com/
2006-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	savvas	mnepton	about that web frontend.. where can i find that?
2006-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	savvas		oh
2006-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	mnepton	savvas	see above, and hence my question about your httpd skills (or lack thereof) ;)
