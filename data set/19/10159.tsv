2006-09-19T16:02:00.000Z	fcomtois		can anybody tell me which package I need to have all the normal fonts, and chinese character supported ?
2006-09-19T16:02:00.000Z	micahcowan	fcomtois	it's easiest to use Administration -> Language Support for that.
2006-09-19T16:03:00.000Z	fcomtois	micahcowan	i'm not using gnome, it's a custom install
2006-09-19T16:04:00.000Z	micahcowan	fcomtois	hm... you are using X, though, yes? What window manager/desktop environment?
2006-09-19T16:06:00.000Z	fcomtois		icewm but i'd my trying to use fvwm-crystal
2006-09-19T16:06:00.000Z	fcomtois		*like
2006-09-19T16:07:00.000Z	micahcowan	fcomtois	you'll want language-pack-zh for sure
2006-09-19T16:08:00.000Z	fcomtois		yeah, i'm living in Hong Kong for the moment
2006-09-19T16:08:00.000Z	fcomtois		that's the name of the package ?
2006-09-19T16:08:00.000Z	micahcowan	fcomtois	but you'd really benefit from something like gnome's SCIM, the input method manager, for typing Chinese. I'm not really sure how you could do it outside of a desktop environment (I /have/ set such up with Japanese, but it was rather specific to Japanese). You can use Emacs' builtin input methods to type Chinese, and copy/paste...
2006-09-19T16:09:00.000Z	fcomtois		nah don't wanna type any chinese caracters, just be able to see them
2006-09-19T16:09:00.000Z	fcomtois		i'm canadian, don't know anything about chinese

2006-09-19T16:12:00.000Z	fcomtois	micahcowan	I would use gnome, but my laptop is an old piece of crap
