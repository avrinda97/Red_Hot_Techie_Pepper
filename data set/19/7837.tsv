2008-09-07T05:19:00.000Z	shey	wers	wlan0
2008-09-07T05:19:00.000Z	wers	shey	which one there?
2008-09-07T05:19:00.000Z	shey	wers	192.168.1.2 is that system.
2008-09-07T05:19:00.000Z	shey	wers	look at the inet addr: line.
2008-09-07T05:23:00.000Z	wers	shey	and n3hima . i tried browsing this computer's contents by opening "ssh://192.168.1.2" using the other computer but it nautilus (on the other computer) said that it can't be displayed because the host cant be found. any idea why?
2008-09-07T05:24:00.000Z	shey	wers	ermm.. 1.2 is the PC you are on.
2008-09-07T05:24:00.000Z	shey	wers	do you have physical access to the other PC?
2008-09-07T05:25:00.000Z	wers	shey	yep
2008-09-07T05:25:00.000Z	shey	wers	sudo ifconfig on that pc.
2008-09-07T05:38:00.000Z	wers	shey	maybe, its a firewall issue. how do i disable it?
2008-09-07T05:38:00.000Z	shey	wers	did you install a firewall? Ubuntu does not come default with a firewall.
2008-09-07T05:39:00.000Z	wers	shey	 nope but i saw something from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto
2008-09-07T05:39:00.000Z	shey	wers	which router do you have?
2008-09-07T05:39:00.000Z	shey	wers	but even still, routers dont usually block internal traffic.
2008-09-07T05:40:00.000Z	wers	shey	netgear wgr614 v7
2008-09-07T05:41:00.000Z	shey	wers	ughh, netgear. But even still like I said, routers do not usually block internal traffic.
2008-09-07T05:41:00.000Z	shey	wers	is there any way possible to hook up the wireless one via cat5?
2008-09-07T05:42:00.000Z	wers	shey	sorry. i dont even know what cat6 is. hehe
