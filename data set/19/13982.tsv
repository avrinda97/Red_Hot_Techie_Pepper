2006-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	^jacob^		if I have a hard drive with XP on it, can I install Dapper and have it create a dual boot?
2006-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	duh ;)
2006-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er_		standalone Warbo?
2006-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	^jacob^	bsdirl	how?
2006-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: why duh?
2006-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: does Dapper keep XP and install itself automatically?
2006-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	of course you can... the new installer was designed with that in mind
2006-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	you have to repartition your free space to make a new area for ubuntu
2006-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: so its safe to install and not have XP deleted?  do I need to tell Dapper to keep XP??
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	the wizard walks you through it ;)
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: how do I repartion it without losing XP?
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	you'll get to a step where it says "wipe out drive completely" or "resize current OS to make room for ubuntu" and you want the latter
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	just try the wizard ;)  you'll get it
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: ok ty
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: as long as I dont lose XP
2006-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	no worries, it'll be in a nice new boot menu when you start the computer
2006-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: sounds good :)
2006-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	^jacob^		bur[n] er_: do I have to tell it hda2 etc and create a swap drive?  or it does it for me automatically?
2006-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	^jacob^	it's pretty intuitive and will do it
