2007-05-20T10:14:00.000Z	mc__		can i tell bash someone to ignore meta-characters? i mean,if i give "foo" as an argument to a programm,bash only gives foo. May i somehow disable that?
2007-05-20T10:14:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	escape the characters. Example: echo \"foo\"
2007-05-20T10:15:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	escaping is no option
2007-05-20T10:15:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	the output is generated by a programm and piped to another
2007-05-20T10:16:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	you can still escape or quote
2007-05-20T10:17:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	how should thath be possible?
2007-05-20T10:17:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	you make program1 issue the escape or quote characters, just like you're making it issue foo.
2007-05-20T10:18:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	output
2007-05-20T10:19:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	i cant change that programm
2007-05-20T10:19:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	can you describe the problem in more detail
2007-05-20T10:20:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	can i tell bash someone to ignore meta-characters? i mean,if i give "foo" as an argument to a programm,bash only gives foo. May i somehow disable that?
2007-05-20T10:20:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	valdyn: alright, i got a programm which pipes some output  to another program. The output is code with lots of "",\ and so on in it. now if there is something like printf("foo"); in the code,the second programm only sees printf(foo);
2007-05-20T10:22:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	make it concrete. What program is piping to what other program?
2007-05-20T10:23:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	alright,my ruby programm is using echo to pipe code to enscript(a programm which generates syntax highlighted html)
2007-05-20T10:24:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	and you can't change your ruby program?
2007-05-20T10:25:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	so that it escapes the characters? well that would be a lot of work i think
2007-05-20T10:25:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	you only have to modify the echo calls to output a ' before and a ' after the variable.
2007-05-20T10:28:00.000Z	mc__	soundray	yeah that worked! thank you a lot
2007-05-20T10:28:00.000Z	soundray	mc__	yw
