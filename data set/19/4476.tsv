2009-09-13T13:27:00.000Z	JCDG		Hello friends I have some issue with mi laptop, after watching a video for a while my screen turns black, and a ctrl alt backspace doesn't even work...I have to restart my machine every time it happens...
2009-09-13T13:29:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	Is there some kind of Power Saver program running?
2009-09-13T13:29:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	the default of ubuntu..
2009-09-13T13:31:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	Mine does that also, desktop. Karmic, I resolved it by setting the Power Saver settings a bit, like a tweak. But that is not the solution, it was a fast workaround.
2009-09-13T13:31:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	my screen blinks a little before it goes black, my Power Saving program is configured in a way the pc never turns off the screen, not even with the battery
2009-09-13T13:32:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	I use Jaunty...
2009-09-13T13:33:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	Looking at other box now, it has Jaunty, same animal, sorta.
2009-09-13T13:36:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	do you have any idea about what could it be???...
2009-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	I am thinking it is a xorg conf thing, still looking, you say it does this Hardwired also?
2009-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	yeah it does it no matter if this is plugged or unplugged...
2009-09-13T13:44:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	Do you have a screensaver set?
2009-09-13T13:45:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	it says that's on but I've never see it work..
2009-09-13T13:46:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	From the forums, that is what is doing it, or is most likely to be it, turn screen saver OFF.
2009-09-13T13:47:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	OK, I'll do that....and well I'll begin to watch a movie an see what happens..
2009-09-13T13:47:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	Gnome also added fading in, still looking at that,
2009-09-13T13:48:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	ok vigo thxs :D
2009-09-13T13:51:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	Look at what samreeds posted here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=899195&highlight=screen+fade
2009-09-13T13:53:00.000Z	JCDG	vigo	Thxs a lot I'll check it and let you know...
2009-09-13T13:53:00.000Z	vigo	JCDG	I think that is the fix that you were asking about, and quite welcome.
