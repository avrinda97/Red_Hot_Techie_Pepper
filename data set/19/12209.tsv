2006-04-02T13:32:00.000Z	soundray		Can you recommend a solution for turning on a computer remotely, other than Wake-on-LAN?
2006-04-02T13:32:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	Call someone to push the button? :)
2006-04-02T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	excellent, I should have thought of that.
2006-04-02T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	problem is the lag, of course...
2006-04-02T13:32:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	I'm here to help hehe
2006-04-02T13:33:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	APC makes power-strips that have a modem attached and you can dial in to turn on specific outlets [assuming your machine will auto-start when power is applied] 
2006-04-02T13:33:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	Not cheap of course.
2006-04-02T13:34:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	interesting. That's the APC that makes UPSs, isn't it? I'll look it up.
2006-04-02T13:34:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	Yeah that's them
2006-04-02T13:35:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	Or Sun Netra's serial console works even when the machine is turned off [as long as power is applied of course]  and you can serial console in and turn them on. :)
2006-04-02T13:36:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	I'm sure there are OOB admin cards for servers than you can get that would allow you to do that too. Don't know of any brands though.
2006-04-02T13:37:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	it must be cheaper than ca. $200 (which is what a decent mainboard with WOL would cost...)
2006-04-02T13:37:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	Ah... I think you're screwed then :)
2006-04-02T13:37:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	SOlution: don't turn off the machine. :)
2006-04-02T13:39:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	I considered that. Problem is, it's fairly unstable (running experimental VDR software) and I want it to boot on an as-needed basis to have the best chance of recording the shows I want to watch.
2006-04-02T13:40:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	good luck with that...
2006-04-02T13:42:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	I had no idea how cheap Socket A boards have become... I think one of them is going to be the answer.
2006-04-02T13:43:00.000Z	doubletwist	soundray	oh yeah they're cheap now...
2006-04-02T14:21:00.000Z	soundray	doubletwist	you overtook me in mid-sentence. :)
