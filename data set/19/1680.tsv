2011-08-17T02:42:00.000Z	Amin_		just tried to run Internet Explorer under Wine (cause I've got to browse a site which is only opens with IE). While the default IE on Wine does'nt open I tried installing IE6 which I was downloaded but it says there's an older version of IE already installed on my pc... what to do?
2011-08-17T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	use an agent switcher in firefox (or whatever browser you use)
2011-08-17T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	it makes the site think you are using a different browser
2011-08-17T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	yes
2011-08-17T02:51:00.000Z	Amin_	ActionParsnip	well, now it's not the site prompting me to use IE ! it's firefox which can't render the webpage !
2011-08-17T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	there is ies4linux but it's not great. Basically the coding for the page sucks
2011-08-17T02:54:00.000Z	Amin_	ActionParsnip	I know the page sucks but I've got to use that as far as it's the site for my university education system !
2011-08-17T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	try ies4linux is all I can suggest, or maybe chromium-browser will do better
2011-08-17T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	its not a apackage, there is a site with a compressed binary, simply extract it and run it
2011-08-17T03:02:00.000Z	Amin_	ActionParsnip	thanks I'll try
2011-08-17T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	I'd moan at the maintainers and call them lazy
2011-08-17T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	I have seen all your posts in here and I'm sure you have seen mine, so the channel "being dead" is false, and you know it
2011-08-17T20:01:00.000Z	Amin_	ActionParsnip	sure sir, no need to complain
2011-08-17T20:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	then why say it's dead when you know it isn't?
2011-08-17T20:02:00.000Z	Amin_	ActionParsnip	there was a HUP !
2011-08-17T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	what is a HUP please?
2011-09-28T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	different drivers, different OS
2011-09-28T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	how do you mean 'bypass'?
2011-09-28T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amin_	if the wireless link is 10Mb, you cannot go faster than that
