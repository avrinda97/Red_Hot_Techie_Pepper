2007-11-23T07:56:00.000Z	sdondley		I reinstalled ubuntu on a dell. Now the network card no longer shows up in network maganger. do I run a dpkg command to have ubuntu try to detect the card and install the driver for me?
2007-11-23T07:57:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	was your dell one of the preinstalled ubuntu ones?
2007-11-23T07:57:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	and what model is it if so?
2007-11-23T07:57:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	on the dell website dell has specific ISO's for the models they ship with ubuntu, that have all the proper drivers rolled into them already
2007-11-23T07:58:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/09/10/29517.aspx  that is a link to the remastered ISO for dells.
2007-11-23T07:59:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	I used the ubuntu disk that came with the dell machine
2007-11-23T07:59:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	so I still need the iso, then?
2007-11-23T07:59:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	this is a different ISO
2007-11-23T07:59:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	ok. but, damn, they should could make this shit easier
2007-11-23T08:00:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	well, at the time you bought yours I imagine the ISO wasnt done yet
2007-11-23T08:00:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	and don't forget, you can contact Dell support ;)
2007-11-23T08:00:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	well, not on t-day
2007-11-23T08:01:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	bought the inspiron last week, so it should have had the iso dated sept 10 according to the link
2007-11-23T08:02:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	no telling really, I have a d530 (which is pretty much the same) and I used that ISO to install ubuntu on it, and it worked with my wifi.
2007-11-23T08:02:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	you know if that iso has drivers for the nvidia card, that's what got me in the mess in the first place, trying to change the screen res and instllaing the driver
2007-11-23T08:03:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	and then dell ships cds with windows drivers, wtf?
2007-11-23T08:04:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	ok, I'll check out that wiki
2007-11-23T08:06:00.000Z	sdondley	macd	you save me about 2 hours of googling and searching. Thanks!
2007-11-23T08:06:00.000Z	macd	sdondley	no worries mate
