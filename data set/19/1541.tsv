2011-03-12T10:19:00.000Z	doug9		not sure what you mean "when you have it".
2011-03-12T10:21:00.000Z	tripelb		littlered it's so simple you dont need anything. I'm just a girl in a diner. I looked at the menu. first install it. then ask me.

2011-03-12T10:23:00.000Z	doug9		You all are gonna crack up... I have a disc that shows 7 modes of operation.  I'm trying to enact "client bridge" mode.  I've followed the instructions on disc.  The units software is supposedly written in Linux. but the directions use windows when talking about the settings on the computer.

2011-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	tripelb	doug9	I have an engenius card. what's the number of your card. that's a good thing to start out with when you want help. somebody give him the ubottu thing that tells how to ask a question. thanks
2011-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	doug9	tripelb	 the card is inside an Engenius ECB3550.  I'm thinking it's a Senao
