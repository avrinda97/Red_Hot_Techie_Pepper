2012-10-20T21:03:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	You have 3 primaries if that description is correct you need a extended now to comtain any more logical type partitions
2012-10-20T21:06:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	Would you run sudo fdisk -l   first and pastebin that info so we know we are all on the same page.
2012-10-20T21:07:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	sure. how do i run the console from the live cd? i'm a little lost with the new desktop
2012-10-20T21:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	Just open a terminal ctrl-alt-t should open it and copy and paste sudo fdisk -l   in and pastebin the info.
2012-10-20T21:11:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	did you get the url ?
2012-10-20T21:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	Yeah you have in the sda HD a extended already with a linux setup, I missed what you final goal is here is it a upgrade on the windows side?
2012-10-20T21:12:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	i have windows 8 installed. i want to dual boot with ubuntu, that's all.
2012-10-20T21:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	You have a extended sda4 that is good you want the linux inside that I see a sda5 and sda6 in there already.
2012-10-20T21:14:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	that was what the installer did just now after selecting "install alongside windows 8"
2012-10-20T21:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	Cool I always do a manual install, so I'm not up on how the unstaller will react after seeing some bad results others have had but this is on the UF or here where people come for help.
2012-10-20T21:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	You have to have everything inside that sda4 a extended, you could set all this up with gparted then use a manual something else install.
2012-10-20T21:31:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	alexfpms: So. 1) I remove everything and get the free space back. 2) Load installer 3) "Something else" 4) Create extended partition 5) Create /boot, primary, inside, 250mb 6) Create swap, 2gb, 7) Create ex2 for linux. 8) Install
2012-10-20T21:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	Yes https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi
2012-10-21T04:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	I use a ntfs
2012-10-21T04:44:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	you don't have writing problems ?
2012-10-21T04:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	It is just a share you don't want to write to a windows set up persay.
2012-10-21T04:45:00.000Z	ajacom	wilee-nilee	I see, so the recommendation against using NTFS is not really because of damaging the files, but because of potentially breaking the windows install
2012-10-21T04:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ajacom	Basically as I know it you don't want to change any code for windows in linux generally.
