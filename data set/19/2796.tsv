2010-05-10T01:42:00.000Z	sigmab3ta		I have lucid running on a desktop and a netbook. I am trying to setup ssh so I can access my desktop from my netbook. i am following https://help.ubuntu.com/9.04/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html . when i attempt to do ssh-copy-id i get an error message that the connection was refused on port 22. what am i missing?
2010-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	Have you started the ssh server? How about ps -ef | grep sshd
2010-05-10T01:44:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	on the netbook or on the desktop?
2010-05-10T01:44:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	On the machine you want to connect to
2010-05-10T01:46:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	it is running on both
2010-05-10T01:47:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	scratch that it is not running on the netbook
2010-05-10T01:47:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	but i would think that's not the problem
2010-05-10T01:47:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	Have you tried connecting with a 'normal' ssh command?
2010-05-10T01:48:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	what would be a 'normal' command?
2010-05-10T01:48:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	Something like ssh -l username mytargetcomputer
2010-05-10T01:50:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	my netbook can ssh to my desktop like that, yeah. and vice versa
2010-05-10T01:51:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	Then your ssh servers are working perfectly fine. I'll quickly check the tutorial you are following, hold on a sec
2010-05-10T01:53:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	i think that did it actually
2010-05-10T01:53:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	You don't want to use keys? Since that's what the ssh-copy-id command is for.
2010-05-10T01:53:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	yeah, but now that i did that, the ssh-copy-id command worked...
2010-05-10T01:54:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	i guess you have to log in once the old-fashioned mortal way?
2010-05-10T01:54:00.000Z	sigmab3ta	clrg	good thing they made a note of that in the howto...
2010-05-10T01:55:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	I guess the problem was that there existed no .ssh directory on the target machine. Once you connect to another box, the host key is saved in .ssh/known_hosts, so the directory is created automatically, enabling ssh-copy-id to work.
2010-05-10T01:55:00.000Z	clrg	sigmab3ta	I'm glad I could help you anyway.
