2007-07-12T15:50:00.000Z	aliverius		hi!
2007-07-12T15:51:00.000Z	aliverius		can someone explain me or direct me to info, regarding using an update-cd during installation?
2007-07-12T15:51:00.000Z	aliverius		how do i make one
2007-07-12T15:51:00.000Z	aliverius		?
2007-07-12T15:52:00.000Z	aliverius		i have an unsupported ethernet card (agere 131x)
2007-07-12T15:52:00.000Z	aliverius		and i wanted to load the module during installation
2007-07-12T15:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aliverius	Not that hard, I copy my var/cache/apt/archive to a cd after every major update, you should be able to drop it in after an install and have synaptic see it or copy it back to that folder
2007-07-12T15:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aliverius	Sorry, was thinking something different than what you want to do
2007-07-12T15:54:00.000Z	aliverius	Jack_Sparrow	at least you tought me something so thx for that ;)
2007-07-12T15:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		np
2007-07-12T15:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aliverius	I hate redownloading the same thing twice
2007-07-12T15:56:00.000Z	aliverius	Jack_Sparrow	my problem is i want it to work during the installation, to get the updates automatically
2007-07-12T15:56:00.000Z	aliverius		but i guess i can live without doing that
2007-07-12T15:56:00.000Z	aliverius		i will download the source for the driver
2007-07-12T15:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aliverius	I think you are going to have to finish the install then make your change..
2007-07-12T15:56:00.000Z	aliverius		in windows
2007-07-12T15:57:00.000Z	aliverius		then compile it in my new linux
2007-07-12T15:57:00.000Z	aliverius		etc etc
