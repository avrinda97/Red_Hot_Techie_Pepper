2007-12-18T15:00:00.000Z	Jupp3-		There's a rather annoying "feature" in fat support, it seems
2007-12-18T15:01:00.000Z	Jupp3-		Let's say I have a file called "FILE.EXT" and I copy it to a FAT device, and it gets renamed to "file.ext" any way I can disable that?
2007-12-18T15:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jupp3-	dunno; but fat filesystem is case insensitive so file.txt and FILE.TXT are the same file
2007-12-18T15:02:00.000Z	Jupp3-	erUSUL	Not really...
2007-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	Jupp3-	erUSUL	I mean, it will be a different file when copied back from the filesystem
2007-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	Jupp3-		And I think that some software still might expect all upper case names
2007-12-18T15:05:00.000Z	Jupp3-	erUSUL	And when backing up stuff from memory card, it's easy to end up with two equal files with different (but same on FAT) filenames on non-fat partition
2007-12-18T15:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jupp3-	well you should use tar on those cases becouse on fat you do not only loose filenames you loose all permissions bits
2007-12-18T15:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jupp3-	so if yu are using fat fs to store backups ; store tar files and not the files itself (with the added bonus of some compression)
2007-12-18T15:07:00.000Z	Jupp3-	erUSUL	I meant the other way
2007-12-18T15:07:00.000Z	Jupp3-	erUSUL	Like backing up a FAT-formatted memory card on EXT3, f.ex.
2007-12-18T15:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jupp3-	in the later cas i do not see how can be a name conflict... on the fat fs you can not create two files named FILE.TXT and file.txt
2007-12-18T15:09:00.000Z	Jupp3-	erUSUL	Let's say I have FILE.EXT on ext3, and I put it on a memory card. Then I take backup later, and get file.ext, so they are two different files
2007-12-18T15:10:00.000Z	Jupp3-		And doing mv file.ext FILE.EXT on fat doesn't seem to fix it either
2007-12-18T15:10:00.000Z	Jupp3-		Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't it be possible to have all upper case filenames on fat partitions?
2007-12-18T15:10:00.000Z	Jupp3-		Mixed case names seem to be copied just fine
2007-12-18T15:10:00.000Z	Jupp3-		But all upper case seem to be somehow converted to all lower case
2007-12-18T15:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jupp3-	in that case i recommend using tar files they were dessigned for that use case... you can extract especific files compress them mantine all the atributes intact etc...
