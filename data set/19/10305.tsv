2006-06-28T13:15:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	i assume the share uses samba, and i assume samba uses its own user database, but i never used samba...
2006-06-28T13:24:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
2006-06-28T13:25:00.000Z	WOLFdude	oskude	thanks bro
2006-06-28T13:25:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	you can start many services from /etc/init.d/programx start (other options are "stop" and "restart")
2006-06-28T13:27:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	yes
2006-06-28T13:28:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	you can start all programs from terminal, and that way you allso have a place where the program could spit errors messages if something goes wrong...
2006-06-28T13:29:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	what apache package did you install ?
2006-06-28T13:29:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	if didnt install any apache yet, i would recommend "sudo apt-get install apache2"
2006-06-28T13:30:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	server installation maybe, but apache is no desktop program ;)
2006-06-28T13:31:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	you can install ALL programs on ALL ubuntu "versions"
2006-06-28T13:37:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	good tip is to use "public_html" folders, you make that folder in your home directory, and then you can access it wih webbrowser at http://ip.ip.ip.ip/~username
2006-06-28T13:38:00.000Z	WOLFdude	oskude	whats reset by peer mean?
2006-06-28T13:39:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	dunno, google ? wikipedia ?
2006-06-28T13:42:00.000Z	oskude	WOLFdude	this is community, so you just have to ask and hope someone knows the solution...
