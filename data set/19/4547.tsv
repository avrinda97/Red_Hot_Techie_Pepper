2008-12-23T08:00:00.000Z	jeremy		is all glitchy and blotchty

2008-12-23T08:03:00.000Z	Remedial	jeremy	How old is the laptop?
2008-12-23T08:04:00.000Z	jeremy	Remedial	I don't know, but my dad just got it back from the repair shop
2008-12-23T08:04:00.000Z	jeremy		they cleaned it all off and fixed it up and everything
2008-12-23T08:04:00.000Z	jeremy		I can't imagine that in the 5 minutes I spent doing NOTHING while signed into XP before turning it off and rebooting to install ubuntu, I did ANYTHING to affect it
2008-12-23T08:05:00.000Z	Remedial	jeremy	I doubt you did anything to your machine
2008-12-23T08:06:00.000Z	jeremy	Remedial	I do too, but the fact is that no matter what I've tried, I can't turn it on without the graphic glitch
2008-12-23T08:07:00.000Z	Remedial	jeremy	it sounds like something electronic is giving out or gave out
2008-12-23T08:07:00.000Z	jeremy		like?
2008-12-23T08:08:00.000Z	Remedial	jeremy	motherboard, graphic chip
