2011-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	flynn3	benzaldehyde	nice!  I have a built in terminal on my desktop that I use for irssi.  wee-chat is a bit easier to read with the colors
2011-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	flynn3	what browser do you use generally? i was thinking about ditching firefox but now tht i see fluxbox is this fast i want to stick with it only i noticed f11 no longer works in maverick on it
2011-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	flynn3	you ought to be able to change the color scheme in gnome terminal emulation i should think
2011-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	flynn3	gonna try it
2011-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	flynn3	benzaldehyde	firefox 4 is nice

2011-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	flynn3	benzaldehyde	you like fluxbox huh?  have you tried enlightment?
2011-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	benzaldehyde		wow i unchecked "use colors from system theme" and instant improvement
2011-04-02T14:41:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	flynn3	not really, my linux use has been hit or miss, my laptop took a dump on me so i decided why not just go with linux on ps3 rather than do anything else
2011-04-02T14:42:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	flynn3	I just now got into the same speed of my laptop using fluxbox, gnome was so so slugish
2011-04-02T14:42:00.000Z	flynn3	benzaldehyde	enlightment is more attractive and as light
2011-04-02T14:43:00.000Z	flynn3		i can't paste in xterm irssi :(  be back on gnome :)
2011-04-02T14:43:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	flynn3	i'm hesitant to go too far too fast, my intention is to use this as a work station, chemistry and so forth, lots of pdf reading
