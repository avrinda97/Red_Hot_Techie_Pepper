2009-08-09T07:13:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart		evening folks. I'm having problems opening .mp4 files from YouTube. :(
2009-08-09T07:14:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart		when I open it with movie player or gxine... movie player just "goes away" ... and gxine just loads and does nothing. :(
2009-08-09T07:15:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart		ah, manually opening through mplayer ... I get "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device. any ideas?
2009-08-09T07:17:00.000Z	zvacet	AndrewGearhart	mplayer>preferences>video>X11/xv ,maybe other will work for you
2009-08-09T07:19:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	thx... didn't work... but thank you for making suggestions. ;-)
2009-08-09T07:22:00.000Z	zvacet	AndrewGearhart	did you try with other drivers you have to restart mplayer after every change you make
2009-08-09T07:26:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	it seems that I may be missing the video codec
2009-08-09T07:28:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	yeah... it says its already installed
2009-08-09T07:28:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	how can I get it to reinstall?
2009-08-09T07:29:00.000Z	zvacet	AndrewGearhart	in synaptic mark mplayer for reinstall
2009-08-09T07:29:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	will that fix all the codecs? I have the codec problem in just about all the video players
2009-08-09T07:30:00.000Z	zvacet	AndrewGearhart	do you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed
2009-08-09T07:30:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	yes. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2009-08-09T07:32:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	thanks for trying. :-)
2009-08-09T07:32:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	honestly... I'm about ready to give up and try to reinstall the whole boat.
2009-08-09T07:36:00.000Z	zvacet	AndrewGearhart	that will not solve problem you can fix it without reinstall if it is audio then in preferences>codecs&demuxer>audio codec family>ffmpeg
2009-08-09T07:37:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	there are numerous problems though... my webcam won't work anymore... I can't play most desktop videos... I get errors about permissions on my home directory when I login... :-\
2009-08-09T07:38:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	zvacet	lots of experimentation to get things working has broken lots of things unf.
2009-08-09T07:39:00.000Z	zvacet	AndrewGearhart	you can always ask on forums qestion by question but if you want to reinstall feel free to do it
