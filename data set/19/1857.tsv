2010-09-19T11:07:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	There are quite a few companies that offer support for Linux.
2010-09-19T11:07:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	What if you want support right now for some program that is rarely installed locally?
2010-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	That can be a problem that applies both to windows and linux. What if you run into problems with a Windows program not commonly installed?
2010-09-19T11:10:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	Indeed, but windows programs are less likely to be "opensource".
2010-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	I agree but I don't understand where you are going with that.
2010-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	It's really hard to set up!
2010-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	Ended up paying thousands for a different product.
2010-09-19T11:13:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	Your kidding me right? Windows can be JUST as complicated and cumbersome to setup as Linux and thats not including the product costs associated with most Windows products.
2010-09-19T11:13:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	A few hundred per computer? Pfft, that's nothing.
2010-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	Your also not thinking about the other perks of using Linux over Windows in a large environment such as a school.
2010-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	Better control over user accounts, less worry of virus's which was a MAJOR problem
2010-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	Roger. Goodnight. Was nice talking
2010-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	I am military. I use "Roger" a lot. Its habit.
2010-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	Interesting. :)  I'm deaf, so I don't hear any of that stuff. :)
2010-09-19T11:17:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	haha. I dig. Well if you idle here much hopefully I will see you here. I am in #nethack quite a bit to
2010-09-19T11:18:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	Awesome. I'm a lousy nethack player, but I do play it frequently. :)
2010-09-19T11:18:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	elricsfate	(Lousey because I like to have a game in one sitting...  So I tend to be relatively risky)
2010-09-19T11:18:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	Freaking love nethack. I to am pretty awful. I actually just got it installed on my ben nano note with some work.
2010-09-19T11:19:00.000Z	elricsfate	Arafangi1n	I am the SAME way.
