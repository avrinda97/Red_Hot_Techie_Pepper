2006-03-20T07:31:00.000Z	paulthompson949		can anyone help me with installing kde on ubuntu?
2006-03-20T07:32:00.000Z	tritium	paulthompson949	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2006-03-20T07:32:00.000Z	paulthompson949		cool... lemme try
2006-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	paulthompson949		it says that it couldnt find the package
2006-03-20T07:36:00.000Z	paulthompson949		tritium... i am having trouble with doing that... it says that it could not find the packages
2006-03-20T07:36:00.000Z	tritium	paulthompson949	have you updated your package list?
2006-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	paulthompson949		how do you do that?
2006-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	tritium	paulthompson949	are you using apt-get, or synaptic, or what?
2006-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	paulthompson949		well, i tried both
2006-03-20T07:38:00.000Z	tritium		paulproteus: have you ever run "sudo apt-get update"?
2006-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	paulthompson949	tritium	i suppose that you were talking to me... i just did what you said and it said...unable to lock administration directory
2006-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	tritium		paulproteus: do you have synaptic running?
2006-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	paulthompson949		yeah... ok... i see
2006-03-20T07:44:00.000Z	paulthompson949	tritium	it does it, but it says that it cannot find kubuntu-desktop.... i also tried sudo apt-get install kde and it says that there are a bunch of dependencies
2006-03-20T07:45:00.000Z	tritium	paulthompson949	it's in the main repo...that doesn't make much sense
2006-03-20T07:46:00.000Z	paulthompson949	tritium	i know... i am confused too... i also have the ubuntu cd in the drive
2006-03-20T07:46:00.000Z	tritium	paulthompson949	hmm, let's have a look at your /etc/apt/sources.list (please put on pastebin)
2006-03-20T07:47:00.000Z	paulthompson949	tritium	new to this stuff... i dont know what that is
2006-03-20T07:50:00.000Z	paulthompson949	tritium	i have the directory open... how can i show you the files?
