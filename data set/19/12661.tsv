2005-07-27T09:44:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah		i can't use sudo
2005-07-27T09:44:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	wait, you can boot?
2005-07-27T09:45:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	you didn't set a hostname during install?
2005-07-27T09:46:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	run /usr/sbin/ifconig, does it show a "lo" device?
2005-07-27T09:51:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	that's a problem
2005-07-27T09:51:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	boot off the cd in rescue mode (ubunutu has rescue right?)
2005-07-27T09:52:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	boot off the cd and the boot prompt type "rescue"
2005-07-27T09:53:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah	cw2	thx
2005-07-27T09:53:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	i don't know that it has that option
2005-07-27T09:53:00.000Z	cw2	bahblahblahbah	but once you get into the installer theres and option to get a console, mount your disk and fix the file
