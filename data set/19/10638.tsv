2006-06-04T08:37:00.000Z	Schalken		how can i tell whether the computer is using software or hardware rendering?
2006-06-04T08:38:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	do you mean graphics acceleration?
2006-06-04T08:38:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	what sort of video card do you have?
2006-06-04T08:38:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	but i want to make sure it is supporting and using as much hardware as it can
2006-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	the motherboards onboard video is a SiS 661FX
2006-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	hehe i have the same graphics onboard
2006-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	do you have it working well?
2006-06-04T08:40:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	ok all you need to do to get the best performance out of that card is to make sure the driver is in xorg.conf
2006-06-04T08:40:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	(with opengl and all)
2006-06-04T08:40:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	okay, how do i get to that?
2006-06-04T08:40:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	 the card worked ok, but i found it useless for composite effects, however for basic media playback etc it does fine
2006-06-04T08:43:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	it says "Driver "sis"", which im guessing is a good thing? and it also says SiS 661FX which is what i entered when i ran "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2006-06-04T08:44:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	is there a glx/opengl test i can do?
2006-06-04T08:44:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	 open a terminal and type "glxgears -iacknowledgethatthistoolisnotabenchmark" :)
2006-06-04T08:47:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	whats your FPS then?
2006-06-04T08:48:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	the gears turn smoothly for a second and then stop, turn slightly, stop for a second, turn slightly, stop et cetera. the gears wont run smoothly.
2006-06-04T08:49:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	i would expect them to be quite poor, the SIS card is internal and shares its memory bus with the CPU i believe
2006-06-04T08:50:00.000Z	skippy81	Schalken	 as long as you have SIS as the driver, and xorg is running OK i dont think theres much more you can do
2006-06-04T08:50:00.000Z	Schalken	skippy81	alright, thanks for your help!
