2007-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	right click the folder, click properties (I'm assuming you're on ubuntu) and click the permissions tab
2007-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	eternaljoy	yoda	what are you talking about???
2007-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	you said your neice can see all your files
2007-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	I just told you how to for the love of crap!
2007-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	eternaljoy	yoda	you told me squat

2007-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	eternaljoy	yoda	im logged into my account now, and when I right click on my /home, it says to only allow ME to access it.  So how can she access it>
2007-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	choose her group under "group"
2007-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	then select the permission you want to set underneath
2007-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	(none)
2007-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	eternaljoy	yoda	under Group: only my name appears
2007-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	yoda	eternaljoy	ok, under "others" set both folders and files to "none" and click apply to enclosed files
2007-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	eternaljoy	yoda	do you mean OTHERS?
2007-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	eternaljoy	yoda	ok that makes more sense now :)
