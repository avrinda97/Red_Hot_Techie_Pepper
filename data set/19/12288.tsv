2007-11-08T10:21:00.000Z	usr13	toot	what is your problem?
2007-11-08T10:31:00.000Z	usr13	toot	what software are you using to burn the CDs?
2007-11-08T10:32:00.000Z	usr13	toot	 Could be that you've made an ISO image of the ISO image in the process of burning the CD. Can you read the files on the CD?
2007-11-08T10:33:00.000Z	usr13	toot	When you read the contents of the CD, do you see a single file with extension  .iso
2007-11-08T10:44:00.000Z	usr13	toot	nothing wrong with your name.  The CD may be bad or your hardware may be bad, but your name is ok.
2007-11-08T10:49:00.000Z	usr13	toot	Run md5sum against the ISO image that you downloaded to see if it matches the one supplied by the server.
2007-11-08T10:50:00.000Z	usr13	toot	 Exactly what image did you download?
2007-11-08T10:50:00.000Z	usr13	toot	Do you have md5sum installed on your MS Windows OS?  If not get it.
2007-11-08T10:50:00.000Z	usr13	toot	So that you can test the ISO image for accuracy.

2007-11-08T10:53:00.000Z	usr13	toot	Try this:  http://www.etree.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi/software/md5sum.exe
2007-11-08T10:54:00.000Z	usr13	toot	 cd to where the iso file is, (via terminal) and issue command:  md5sum  filename.iso
2007-11-08T10:54:00.000Z	usr13	toot	What image did you download?
2007-11-08T10:55:00.000Z	usr13	toot	What is the filename?
