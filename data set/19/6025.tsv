2008-04-02T20:08:00.000Z	PredaGR		hello, by using firefox and adobe flash plugin I get really high CPU usage, is this normal?
2008-04-02T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	depend on the flash media your viewing
2008-04-02T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	some "movies" can cause high disk/cpu
2008-04-02T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	also dpends on the performance of your machine
2008-04-02T20:10:00.000Z	PredaGR	ikonia	thanks for the info, if it is known I guess it is not local fault
2008-04-02T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	no no, you shouldn't get it by default, but as I said, it depends on what you are viewing and the spec of your machine
2008-04-02T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	shouldn't be getting %100 on those things, are you just watching them in firefox,
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	PredaGR	ikonia	even when they paused and low quality setting they eat 50% cpu
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	thats interesting
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	I wouldn't expect that
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	how are you on ram and useable disk space ?
2008-04-02T20:14:00.000Z	PredaGR	ikonia	786MB RAM half full and other half as cache file system is 11% full
2008-04-02T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	so you should be pretty comfortable with that
2008-04-02T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	did you install using the ubuntu package "flashplugin-nonfree"
2008-04-02T20:17:00.000Z	PredaGR	ikonia	thats the one installed, done automagically by firefox and apt
2008-04-02T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	so that should be fine
2008-04-02T20:20:00.000Z	PredaGR	ikonia	ohh well just asked before I tinker with it, if I break it more then I come for more questions I think
2008-04-02T20:20:00.000Z	PredaGR	ikonia	thanks alot
2008-04-02T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	PredaGR	sounds goo, but I don't think you should be seeing that much cpu us on idle
