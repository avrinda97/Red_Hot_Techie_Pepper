2009-05-21T22:57:00.000Z	mbrannock	Dre4m	home stores all of your user configurations and preferences
2009-05-21T22:57:00.000Z	Dre4m		home is like my documents on windows ya?
2009-05-21T22:58:00.000Z	mbrannock		dre4m: home is like c:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME
2009-05-21T22:58:00.000Z	Dre4m		ye
2009-05-21T22:58:00.000Z	Dre4m		so basically I wont be using that then really as i'll be using this parttition to get files off
2009-05-21T22:59:00.000Z	mbrannock		dre4m: you can mount your windows drive in the home directory as if it were just another folder. this is what tones is saying
2009-05-21T22:59:00.000Z	Dre4m		THATs WHAT I TIRED TO DO!
2009-05-21T22:59:00.000Z	Dre4m	mbrannock	I wanted to mount the windows drive which I can see now . . . as "home"
2009-05-21T23:00:00.000Z	mbrannock	Dre4m	exactly, you could make your windows drive appear as a folder on your desktop, for instance
