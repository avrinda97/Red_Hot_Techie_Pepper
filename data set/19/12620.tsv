2005-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	elsha		hmmm :/
2005-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	elsha		i thought this kernel supported NTFS partitions :/
2005-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	not writing
2005-08-02T05:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	that depends on your needs really
2005-08-02T05:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	look at XFS, and ReiserFS (current version Reiser4)
2005-08-02T05:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	but do you need speed, will you have lots of small files? etc.
2005-08-02T05:17:00.000Z	elsha	Razor-X	space shouldnt be a big issue.. so reiserfs would be the best way to go?
2005-08-02T05:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	XFS has real good performance, but ReiserFS works best with a lot of small files
2005-08-02T05:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	correcto ;)
2005-08-02T05:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	ewww!
2005-08-02T05:21:00.000Z	elsha	Razor-X	what would be another option that is write for both ubuntu and winxp?
2005-08-02T05:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	ahh.... you got me there ;)
2005-08-02T05:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	you'll have to compile it yourself
2005-08-02T05:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	after a while, you end up riding the arguments for that ;)
2005-08-02T05:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	I can help with partitioning problems
2005-08-02T05:36:00.000Z	elsha	Razor-X	thanks... i'll keep that in mind if this stuffs up
2005-08-02T05:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	no problem, same with GRUB errors
2005-08-02T05:40:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	``To Each His Own'' (and i'm quoting, so I don't change gender ;)
2005-08-02T05:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	elsha	heh
