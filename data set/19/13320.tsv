2005-04-24T13:24:00.000Z	MrParker		hey
2005-04-24T13:24:00.000Z	MrParker		can anyone give me a hand with something?
2005-04-24T13:25:00.000Z	MrParker		I go to 'screen resolution' under system
2005-04-24T13:25:00.000Z	MrParker		and it only allows me to put it up to 1024x768
2005-04-24T13:26:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	did you install from a kubuntu disk or a regular hoary 5.04 install disk?
2005-04-24T13:28:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	ahh ok so your desktop is Gnome then?
2005-04-24T13:29:00.000Z	MrParker	kkathman	yes it is gnome
2005-04-24T13:29:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	when you installed, there should have been a screen that came up and asked you to tick the resolutions that you wanted to utilize, do you remember that screen?
2005-04-24T13:30:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	if you just went past that screen, it might have not gotten the higher resolutions
2005-04-24T13:30:00.000Z	MrParker	kkathman	yeah I did, but that was prior to me having an LCD monitor that requirse 1280x1024, and I was running it in 1024x768
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	no need to reinstall, but you probably will need to change your xorg.conf...if you are not comfy with this, then reinstall :)
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	MrParker	kkathman	is there no way to select resolutions past setup?
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	MrParker	kkathman	okay, where is xorg.conf
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	let me see if I can get you  a reference...one moment
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	MrParker	kkathman	thanks
2005-04-24T13:32:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	try this thread, I think it might help you:  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=21984&highlight=screen+resolution
2005-04-24T13:33:00.000Z	MrParker	kkathman	I figured it out from the .conf file thanks :)
2005-04-24T13:33:00.000Z	kkathman	MrParker	great....good luck :)
