2007-03-21T14:44:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	try -t vfat
2007-03-21T14:45:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	thanks for the suggestion.  Apparently that's not the right key/option.  (Actually, I was sure it was an NTFS drive, despite what fdisk says)
2007-03-21T14:45:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	what does fdisk -l says
2007-03-21T14:46:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	it says W95 Ext'd
2007-03-21T14:46:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	a broke ntfs or maybe an extended part that holds an ntfs drive?
2007-03-21T14:46:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	it's a single physical drive with only one partition.  I guess I could be insane =] 
2007-03-21T14:47:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	good q, indeed, i guess its time for trying for you, try all the fs types there are "man mount"
2007-03-21T14:48:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	i dunno if you may fsck a win partition from linux, never did that, maybe someone knows
2007-03-21T14:48:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	if everything fails, might do an image with dd and try to mount that
2007-03-21T14:48:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	I'll poke around the man a bit ....and if all else fails, I'll boot into Windows
2007-03-21T14:48:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	hehe, of course, if you still got that installed)
2007-03-21T14:54:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	according to UbuntuForums, one cannot mount an extended drive
2007-03-21T14:54:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	extended isnt actually a fs, thats why i was asking for an fs inside
2007-03-21T14:55:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	I'm an idiot
2007-03-21T14:55:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	solved!
2007-03-21T14:55:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	the problem was that I'm stupid and I should have been mounting /dev/hdb (not hda)
2007-03-21T14:56:00.000Z	nevermind	Huffalump	good to hear your things working out)
2007-03-21T14:59:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	(or Nullbyte) - could you point me in the right direction to solve this?  http://pastebin.ca/405706
2007-03-21T15:00:00.000Z	Huffalump	nevermind	(or Nullbyte) disregard... another ID-10-T error
