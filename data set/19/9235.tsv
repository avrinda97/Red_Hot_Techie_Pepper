2008-12-04T09:13:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		swagga*
2008-12-04T09:14:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		not sure, ive only used ubuntu XD, but i know OsX is like that too
2008-12-04T09:15:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		and vista has something like that, but you press OK instead of typing your password
2008-12-04T09:16:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		lol i agree with izinuc on this =P
2008-12-04T09:16:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		just type your password and suck it up, its for your own good
2008-12-04T09:17:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		ohhhh family computer... bad place
2008-12-04T09:18:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		dude you should have set up unbuntu/windows dualboot.... you get unbuntu, and your mother gets window$
2008-12-04T09:20:00.000Z	Alex_Gren		gnome is still sexier then kde btw... -.-
2008-12-04T09:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	Lies! Isn't this pretty? http://arrenlex.aa.am/screenshots/23525.png
2008-12-04T09:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	I sort of feel the same way about gnome... although I have it on my laptop because kde refuses to work with the fingerprint reader.
2008-12-04T09:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	I like that KDE has a configuration option for everything, but at the same time, it's so annoying KDE has a configuration option for everything. :(
2008-12-04T09:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	It sure is powerful though... you can get it exactly how you like it. :D
2008-12-04T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	And I am delighted with kde 3. :) It's perfect for me. It's awesome that Linux has so many things to make everyone happy.
2008-12-04T09:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	Naw, I tried it out a while ago and it wasn't quite there yet. kde 3 is rock solid and configured just the way I like it... I guess I'll upgrade naturally when it gets into debian testing, but hopefully that won't be for a while.
2008-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	Naw, I configured it like twice in my life... I just hold onto my .home folder to make sure I don't lose the conf :)

2008-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	Are you using ooo's built-in dictionary installer or trying to do it manually
2008-12-04T09:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	Alex_Gren	Ah, dunno then, sorry
