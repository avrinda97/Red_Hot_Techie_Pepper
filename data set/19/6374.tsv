2008-02-09T21:52:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	In the xorg configuration, where it lists all possible resolutions - none are checked off. Any idea why?
2008-02-09T21:52:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	it does not autodetect anything, you have to choose what you have
2008-02-09T21:53:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	how? If I press enter, it goes on the next step.
2008-02-09T21:53:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	space
2008-02-09T21:53:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	thank yoou
2008-02-09T21:55:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	One more thing.. for "monitors best video more", I know my laptop can do 1440x900. But it says it's at 100Hz, and offers no other frequency. Is this a standard or?
2008-02-09T21:55:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	*mode
2008-02-09T21:57:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	i quess this config is not best for laptops, it is somehow old and do not work with LCD and new stuff pretty well
2008-02-09T21:57:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	What should I do?
2008-02-09T21:57:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	i if you have no choice, then you have no choise and try what it chooses
2008-02-09T21:57:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	what do you need X configurator for?
2008-02-09T21:57:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	how can I go back a step?
2008-02-09T21:58:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	My video drivers are completely messed up and the xorg.conf too.
2008-02-09T21:58:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	_nothing_ can fix them. Not envy, not nvidia's settings.
2008-02-09T21:59:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	if they were ok, what did you want to configure?
2008-02-09T21:59:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	They weren't, they're completely broken. I'm getting max 800x600 right now. And whatever I try, I can't get it to use nvidia's driver
2008-02-09T21:59:00.000Z	Vadi	pihhan	even though xorg.conf says to use it, it doesn't
2008-02-09T22:00:00.000Z	pihhan	Vadi	i dont know if that configurator allows nvidia driver
