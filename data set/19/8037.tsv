2007-05-15T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	read the information ubotu sent you
2007-05-30T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	you try to avoid that.  It is better to use synaptic.  What are you trying to install?
2007-05-30T05:00:00.000Z	nj786	jrib	audacity
2007-05-30T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	audacity is in synaptic
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	nj786	jrib	wjat do you mean?
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	you can install audacity using synaptic, no need to download anything from the internet
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	nj786	jrib	i know unbuntu has audacity but it is giving me errors
2007-05-31T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	STOP DONT DO THAT
2007-05-31T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	he's gone
2007-05-31T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	relax, just reinstall ubuntu if you let that command run.  In the future don't run commands if you do not know what they do
2007-05-31T15:52:00.000Z	nj786	jrib	but he told me it would fix my sound
2007-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	jrib	nj786	google for "ie4linux" if you need to install IE on linux
