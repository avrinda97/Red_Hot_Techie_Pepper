2007-05-30T06:57:00.000Z	Vorbote	zamboni	add the ubuntu kernel to lilo
2007-05-30T07:01:00.000Z	Vorbote	zamboni	It is very easy. Add the ubuntu kernel to lilo. Take advantage of the kernel symlinks in root they are there to facilitate booting from another partition even if the kernel is upgraded.
2007-05-30T07:02:00.000Z	zamboni	Vorbote	Ive tried that and so far the bootprocess hangs after probing  the hardware
2007-05-30T07:02:00.000Z	Vorbote	zamboni	Have you tried adding bootflags such as noapic nolapic? That sounds like a problem with your BIOS.
2007-05-30T07:04:00.000Z	Vorbote	zamboni	or it may be that the lilo version you have is a bit old/has a bug and doesn't have enough memory space to load up a 2.6 kernel that should be a compile time option; (slackware's default was 2.4 yet afaik...)
2007-05-30T07:10:00.000Z	zamboni	Vorbote	should I say hd1 or hd1,0 in the advanced dialog of the partitioner dialog?
2007-05-30T07:14:00.000Z	Vorbote	zamboni	sorry, I steped out for a minute. Use hd1,0
2007-05-30T07:15:00.000Z	zamboni	Vorbote	thanks will give it a go
2007-05-30T07:15:00.000Z	Vorbote	zamboni	cross me fingers
