2007-02-27T16:38:00.000Z	nocturn		Hi all
2007-02-27T16:39:00.000Z	nocturn		I'm looking for an OSS issue tracking system, something light.  I looked at otrs, but it is way to much
2007-02-27T16:39:00.000Z	nocturn		Any suggestions?
2007-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	leagris	nocturn	there are many OSS IT tools out there. Maybe you can write down (not here) your requirements and look around freshmeat.net and point the ones that fit your needs and preferably thoses availables on ubuntu repos.
2007-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	nocturn	leagris	I more or less did that
2007-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	nocturn		but most come out wrong
2007-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	nocturn		some are nice, but abandonned
2007-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	nocturn		I'm looking for the bugzilla equivalent to issue tracking
2007-02-27T16:43:00.000Z	nocturn		thanks mneptok , I'll take a look
2007-02-27T16:43:00.000Z	leagris		yes nocturn went the simmilar conclusion 4 years ago. Either I had to change our ways of issue tracking according to the software design (bad) or I had to do significant code architecture change (bad either because of maintainability)
2007-02-27T16:45:00.000Z	leagris	nocturn	it ended up we where baught by another entity and they brougth us their closed source internal IT solution (IE compatible only) :(
2007-02-27T16:46:00.000Z	nocturn	leagris	that sucks...
2007-02-27T16:46:00.000Z	nocturn		I need something to track issues on the beowulf cluster I inherited
2007-02-27T16:46:00.000Z	nocturn		Just for 2 admins
2007-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	nocturn		Mantis looks good...
2007-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	nocturn		testing it further
2007-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	leagris	nocturn	(a Wiki / Forum) should be enough for small scale tracking)
2007-02-27T16:48:00.000Z	leagris	nocturn	the most usefull tool I had ever found inside en IT department was a Wiki :)
2007-02-27T16:50:00.000Z	nocturn	leagris	I know, I wanted a wiki instead of using a word document for documenting the system...
