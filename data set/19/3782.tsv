2012-04-29T00:17:00.000Z	freebird		you guys, I've a hp mini 210-1000, I want my resolution to go to 1024x600, but it's only going to 800x600, my graphic card is: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:a011]
2012-04-29T00:17:00.000Z	freebird		how should I proceed
2012-04-29T00:18:00.000Z	freebird		please, can someone give me a light ??
2012-04-29T00:18:00.000Z	freebird		please
2012-04-29T00:19:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	install the drivers?
2012-04-29T00:20:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	they are already installed I guess, I think it's only a matter of adding a line to xorg.conf, not sure
2012-04-29T00:20:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	have you tried editing your xorg.conf?
2012-04-29T00:20:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	there is no xorg.conf in here
2012-04-29T00:21:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	when I try to create, next reboot, things wont show up, do you know where I can find a good xorg.config for me ?
2012-04-29T00:22:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	afraid not, but have you tried generating one? http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/create-a-xorgconf-file.html
2012-04-29T00:27:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	please, someone told me I can find out the correct driver for me, if I have the number:id, something like that, how do I go about that mine number:id for the graphic card is: 8086:a011
2012-04-29T00:28:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	yeah, your card is VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:a011] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
2012-04-29T00:29:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	and I should seek for n10 family integrated graphics controller ?
2012-04-29T00:33:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	if ubuntu hasn't detected and loaded the correct driver, then you may need to install it manually.  I couldn't tell you where/how to do that though.  I'd perhaps try to autogen a xorg and then add the resolution you want in manually http://humanreadable.nfshost.com/sdeg/xorg_video_sizes.htm
2012-04-29T00:39:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	there's no xorg config in here, so I'm installing xserver-xorg-dev
2012-04-29T00:40:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	why are you installing the dev package?
2012-04-29T00:41:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	read this > https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config
2012-04-29T00:42:00.000Z	freebird	neurochrome	 I want to xorgconfig, how do I do that ?
2012-04-29T00:44:00.000Z	neurochrome	freebird	that article I linked will give you a better understanding.  You might also want to read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
