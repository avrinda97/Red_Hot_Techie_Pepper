2009-04-22T07:43:00.000Z	solexious	DasEi	No and only storage over a network
2009-04-22T07:44:00.000Z	DasEi	solexious	you want to backup files or double the OS ?
2009-04-22T07:45:00.000Z	solexious	DasEi	The drive is on its last legs so what ever I need to do to move it to a new one

2009-04-22T07:47:00.000Z	DasEi	solexious	so wheres the problem then ? copy the files over
2009-04-22T07:47:00.000Z	solexious	DasEi	im not sure what files to copy :s
2009-04-22T07:50:00.000Z	DasEi	solexious	/home will contain most of your private files, /etc configs, dpkg-get selections > pak.txt generates a list of installed packages
2009-04-22T07:52:00.000Z	solexious	DasEi	So if I copy that, then install ubuntu on a new hdd then copy it back? *idiot checking :)*
2009-04-22T07:53:00.000Z	DasEi	solexious	you can copy /home back, re-install the packages from the list BUT mussn't just copy /etc, but can get the configs out there
2009-04-22T07:54:00.000Z	solexious	DasEi	Ok thanks
2009-04-22T07:54:00.000Z	DasEi	solexious	best is then not to mess with usernames (home), else copy just the files, not the whole dir
