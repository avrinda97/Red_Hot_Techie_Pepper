2010-01-26T11:35:00.000Z	dft	meowbuntu	sure why not
2010-01-26T11:36:00.000Z	dft	meowbuntu	you've got some UDMA100/133 devices on a 40 wire cable.  you should find an 80wire cable to fix that
2010-01-26T11:36:00.000Z	meowbuntu	dft	i have an error at boot saying something like this. cant mount a partition in fstab. swap ???
