2005-06-18T05:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	miracleblue	you need the gstreamer-mad package
2005-06-18T06:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	miracleblue	get gstreamer-mad and use rhythmbox or muine
2005-06-18T06:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	miracleblue	you need to tell xmms to use alsa or oss
2005-06-18T06:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	miracleblue	it's a preference
2005-06-18T06:43:00.000Z	miracleblue	Amaranth	oh, okie dokie, ill try that
2005-06-18T06:44:00.000Z	miracleblue	Amaranth	It was using OSS, so i switched it to ALSA
2005-06-18T06:44:00.000Z	miracleblue	Amaranth	I'll give it another try
2005-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	miracleblue	Amaranth	It works using the eSound one ^_^
2005-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	miracleblue	ah, that was it
2005-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	miracleblue	i was thinking you needed to take it off the esd one
2005-06-18T06:47:00.000Z	miracleblue	Amaranth	Yeah, OSS is the one freezing up.  Thanks for helping, otherwise I wouldntve tried changing that option
