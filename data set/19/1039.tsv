2011-06-01T15:08:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	did you try blacklisting the kernel USB modules, etc?
2011-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	Yes, that works well with USB (usbhid module). But what would I need to blacklist to disable PS/2?
2011-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	it could well be compiled into the kernel image, not as a module
2011-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	in which case you would be sol
2011-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	Any chance of disabling the /dev/psaux, for instance?
2011-06-01T15:10:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	With "sudo nohup cat /dev/tty0 &> /dev/null &" I can take over the PS/2 keyboard and suppress input. Not sure if it's the proper way, but it works, but only for keyboard.
2011-06-01T15:10:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	you could try 'chmod 0 /dev/...'
2011-06-01T15:11:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	a device without permissions won't be usable
2011-06-01T15:11:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	I'll try but expect it to be recreated on next boot. But then I could use a startup script to change it again. Not so beautiful, but if it works... will try!
2011-06-01T15:12:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	you can put it in /etc/rc.local - then you don't need the 'sudo'
2011-06-01T15:12:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	Oh well, it doesn't work. chmod 0 or even rm doesn't affect PS/2 mouse movement.
2011-06-01T15:13:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	is superglue in the port an option?
2011-06-01T15:13:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	In fact, that's what I already considered but tried to find a "nicer" solution. :)
2011-06-01T15:13:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	who ever uses a ps2 mouse any ore?
2011-06-01T15:14:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	obviously nicer to find a software solution
2011-06-01T15:14:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	I don't - but if anyone plugged one in, they would circumvent my attempt to disable local input.
2011-06-01T15:15:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	don't forget to password protect the bios and set it not to boot from cd, usb, network
2011-06-01T15:15:00.000Z	dooglus	sz_	or they can boot from a livecd and all bets are off
2011-06-01T15:16:00.000Z	sz_	dooglus	Of course. Well, I've got to go, but thanks for your help. See ya.
