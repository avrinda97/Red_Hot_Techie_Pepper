2010-05-16T02:07:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mac9416	 . is the current directory you're in

2010-05-16T02:08:00.000Z	mac9416	bastid_raZor	:-)  Yeah, that's why I'm so confused. Not sure how that directory can even be created without throwing errors.

2010-09-29T03:56:00.000Z	mac9416	bastid_raZor	thanks. If that command doesn't exist, does it mean something is terribly wrong?
2010-09-29T03:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mac9416	if you started with Ubuntu, then it means you've done some serious tinkering.
2010-09-29T04:01:00.000Z	mac9416	bastid_raZor	thanks. Looks like I have some reinstalling to do.
2010-09-29T04:02:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mac9416	if you removed it, possibly 'ubuntu-desktop' may pull in the all the lost things..
2010-09-29T04:02:00.000Z	mac9416	bastid_raZor	roger that, good idea.
