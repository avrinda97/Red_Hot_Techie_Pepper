2010-10-14T16:52:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	you can tell apt to use a proxy
2010-10-14T16:52:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	it's just an environment var
2010-10-14T16:52:00.000Z	sangeeth	StuckMojo	HOW???
2010-10-14T16:53:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	GIYF: http://blogs.sun.com/venky/entry/using_apt_get_with_a
2010-10-14T16:54:00.000Z	sangeeth	StuckMojo	Thanks.... :)
2010-10-14T16:54:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	there's an easier way though. with just an env var, IIRC
2010-10-14T17:00:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	you can just do: export http_proxy=http://username:password@proxyserver.net:port/
2010-10-14T17:00:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	that overrides what's in the config file anyway
2010-10-14T17:14:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	second way works too, but you have to do it in every login session you want to use apt in
2010-10-14T17:14:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	the first way is more permanent
2010-10-14T17:14:00.000Z	sangeeth	StuckMojo	One more question... Should the Username Pwd be given only to http or also to https and ftp
2010-10-14T17:15:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	that depends on your proxy server
2010-10-14T17:15:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	if you need it to use a browser to go to https, then you need it here too
2010-10-14T17:16:00.000Z	sangeeth	StuckMojo	You are AWESOME!!!
2010-10-14T17:16:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	shut up baby i know it
2010-10-14T17:30:00.000Z	sangeeth	StuckMojo	sudo apt-get update  -> fails for ubuntu 10.10  --  http://pastebin.com/ycRVL3uE
2010-10-14T17:32:00.000Z	StuckMojo	sangeeth	use update-manager -d
