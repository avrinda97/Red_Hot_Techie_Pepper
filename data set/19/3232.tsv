2009-10-26T13:33:00.000Z	bigmack83_		i have a bunch of .avi files i want to convert to mpeg so i can burn them to a dvd and watch them on a dvd player. what would the workflow be in ubuntu to do so? I have tried using devede but it seems to only be able to put four ~175Mb files onto one dvd.is there a better option?
2009-10-26T13:34:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	 devede should allow more than 4 video files
2009-10-26T13:35:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	yea thats what i thought. the only thing i can think of is that its trying to put all the extra files on to the dvd/iso as well.
2009-10-26T13:38:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	i have used ffmpeg to convert, and devede to make the dvd (choosing the valid dvd format) option or something similar, so devede didnt do any converting
2009-10-26T13:39:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	ok, ill check that out. thanks
2009-10-26T13:46:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	ok each avi i have is 170mb and selecting one in devede takes nearly 25% of the disk space on a dvd. so how am i supposed to fit more than 4 avi's onto the iso to burn it
2009-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	the bitrate settings maybe
2009-10-26T13:48:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	well even then it shouldnt go from 170 mb to nearly over 1gb for one avi file.
2009-10-26T13:49:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	heh, well it seems that the default bit rate is 5001 kbps
2009-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	have a switch on your laptop for wireless?
2009-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	yea but its always red, it never worked before. ill try though...
2009-11-15T09:36:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	yea pressing the button doesnt work. its just the touch sensitive button. not a real button
2009-11-15T09:36:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	your laptop has a touch sensitive button to control the wireless lol
2009-11-15T09:38:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	yea, but its never worked in ubuntu before
2009-11-15T09:43:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	any other idea what i could try to get it to work?
2009-11-15T09:44:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	nope ive got no ideas, get intel wirelss lol
2009-11-15T09:49:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	ok thanks
2009-11-30T13:24:00.000Z	Billiard	bigmack83_	you can recreate the partition without formatting in the same place to recover it, im sure there are programs to search for the position of a lost partition if you dont know the exact location
2009-11-30T13:25:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Billiard	well im scanning the drive with testdisk, but its a rather large drive (1TB) so its going to take ages.
