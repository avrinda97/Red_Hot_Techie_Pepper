2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	jmspeex		Are there any plans on actually fixing firefox? or at least reverting to the previous version?
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	codecaine	jmspeex	what's wrong with it?
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	codecaine		hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	codecaine		it should then tell u dma on
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	jmspeex	codecaine	crashing all the time, it's even acknowledged in this chan's title

2005-07-30T05:37:00.000Z	codecaine	jmspeex	didn't notice, mine hasn't crashed yet?

2005-07-30T05:38:00.000Z	codecaine	jmspeex	i got it open now what?
2005-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	jmspeex	codecaine	trying to cring up the sidebar crashes firefox, 100% of the time.
2005-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	codecaine		"cring?"
2005-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	jmspeex		Tools->extensions crashes it more than half the time
2005-07-30T05:40:00.000Z	codecaine	jmspeex	can't get it to do it.  im running 1.0.4 from backports
2005-07-30T05:41:00.000Z	jmspeex	codecaine	I thought only 1.0.2 was available (with security fixes)?
2005-07-30T05:41:00.000Z	codecaine	jmspeex	maybe with security fixes from ubuntu, but backports has 1.0.4
2005-07-30T05:41:00.000Z	codecaine		backports is part of ubuntu officially i believe
2005-07-30T05:42:00.000Z	codecaine		theirs several updated packages in backports
2005-07-30T05:42:00.000Z	codecaine		levin, backports is part of ubuntuforums.org
2005-07-30T05:42:00.000Z	jmspeex	codecaine	how do I get it?
