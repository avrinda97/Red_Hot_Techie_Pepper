2011-07-01T03:22:00.000Z	josh__		Anybody else able to help with my lacking of the ability to click? 10.4, ran 9.10 via dual boot, and it hasn't ever given me this problem before (te installw as on an external)
2011-07-01T03:23:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	checked the obvious things?
2011-07-01T03:24:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 like what?
2011-07-01T03:29:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 it says by-id  by-path  event0  event1  event2  event3  event4  mice  mouse0  mouse1
2011-07-01T03:32:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	told me permission denied.
2011-07-01T03:33:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	hm.
2011-07-01T03:34:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 same thing
2011-07-01T03:36:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	see what Ctl-Escape does
2011-07-01T03:37:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	by the way, on my Ubuntu system (your mileage may vary)...
2011-07-01T03:38:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 what was the command again?
2011-07-01T03:45:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 okay, mouse0 did nothing, but mouse1 threw up a munch of jargen
2011-07-01T03:47:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	good. now, when you go back to the test, try just clicking each button. If you get data, then I'll send you on to the next test.
2011-07-01T03:48:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 I'll double check real quick
2011-07-01T03:49:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	hm?
2011-07-01T03:49:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 yeah it did put code up.
2011-07-01T03:50:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	start xev, click buttons again (don't forget to put the pointer INTO that white window first)
2011-07-01T03:50:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	 just "start xev" in terminal?
2011-07-01T03:54:00.000Z	josh__	Viking667	well it looks like it was registering my clicks, right and left
2011-07-01T03:54:00.000Z	Viking667	josh__	ah. Then you need to look somewhere else, i.e. the window manager. Try kde instead, see if mouseclicks work there
