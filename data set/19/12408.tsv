2005-09-10T11:02:00.000Z	cafuego	johndarkhorse	avoid!
2005-09-10T11:02:00.000Z	cafuego	johndarkhorse	anything listed on prism54.org
2005-09-10T11:22:00.000Z	cafuego	johndarkhorse	Not really, it WILL reset the boot pointer in  PRAM
2005-09-10T11:22:00.000Z	cafuego	johndarkhorse	That's easily fixable with a rescue boot off cd.
2005-09-10T11:22:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	sorry, i'm a hick and dont know the fancy explanations
2005-09-10T11:22:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	easier with open firmware
2005-09-10T11:23:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	we mac users only have to boot with the "alt-option" key to get to yaboot
2005-09-10T11:23:00.000Z	cafuego	johndarkhorse	That depends on whether you know the device string
2005-09-10T11:23:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	i've dont it beforer
2005-09-10T11:24:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	the boot partition shows up in the list when you hold the alt-option key
2005-09-10T11:24:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	then you just run ybin to reinitialize your whatzit
2005-09-10T11:25:00.000Z	cafuego	johndarkhorse	yeah, the only critical step there is the Holy Penguin Pee one. (That adjusts the PRAM)
2005-09-10T11:25:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cafuego	i cant explain it technically, i just know after an OSX install, i do the alt-option thing and ybin my way back to yabootiness
