2011-05-09T12:02:00.000Z	psypher246		Why does this stuff have to regress so badly each new version of ubuntu
2011-05-09T12:02:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	are you talking about the free equivalents of Flash?
2011-05-09T12:03:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	Adobe make a Linux version of their flashplayer
2011-05-09T12:03:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	so u suggest the offical adboe version and not ubuntu's
2011-05-09T12:03:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	yep
2011-05-09T12:03:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	The Adobe version just plain works, and you know it's developed alongside the Windows version, which is the gold standard
2011-05-09T12:04:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	ok cool going back to their version, like i said lucid played flash very well, on ubuntu's version, but yeah this sucks
2011-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	I can't play youtube videos in lucid using any flashplayer other than Adobe's
2011-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	32 or 64 bit?
2011-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	but the Adobe one works perfectly.  If you can live with having non-open-source software on your puter
2011-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	meh :) I really don't care
2011-05-09T12:05:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	32-bit I'm using
2011-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	as long as it's free and not runing on windows, i don;'t care what license it has really
2011-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	well it's just that it's an Adobe binary - they don't give you the source
2011-05-09T12:16:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	do u use chorme?"
2011-05-09T12:19:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	no, I use firefox
2011-05-09T12:20:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	np i found wher i need to place the flie
2011-05-09T12:35:00.000Z	psypher246	thegoodcushion	thanks dude, smooth fullscreen happiness. i should have thought of this before, been such a long time since i had to install adobe's version that I forgot that it was a solution back in the day, well in my case
2011-05-09T12:36:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	psypher246	as far as I'm concerned, the Adobe version is the only version, unless you're a FOSS diehard
