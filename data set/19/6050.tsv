2008-03-22T19:03:00.000Z	amenado		SubMiSSi0n-> means it can not find it..no stage 1.5 files
2008-03-22T19:04:00.000Z	amenado		SubMiSSi0n-> do you have the rest installed and only trying to clean up with finishing touches of grub install?
2008-03-22T19:05:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	i installed a Slackware based distro, wich came with LILO, but LILO doesnt seem to work (at boot i get: Could not find operating system) so i want to get rid of LILO and install GRUB
2008-03-22T19:05:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	i am now with a Ubuntu 7.04 LiveCD
2008-03-22T19:08:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	then how do i 'copy' them to the right location? I am a linux beginner , i need grub installed on my HD, do i have to run the command grub-install ?
2008-03-22T19:08:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	i read that if i install GRUB, it simply overwrites LILO, thats why i dont bother the lilo install
2008-03-22T19:09:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	well i am in the LiveCD ubuntu on my main computer now...
2008-03-22T19:10:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	the problem is that i really need that slackware based distro i have.. with GRUB
2008-03-22T19:10:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	cant i just install grub with the LiveCD like in the guide here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351
2008-03-22T19:11:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	thx for the channel, but i think it haves nothing to do with slackware, because i dont have to do something with the slackware files, just installing GRUB
2008-03-22T19:13:00.000Z	SubMiSSi0n	amenado	 its looking for stage1 yes
