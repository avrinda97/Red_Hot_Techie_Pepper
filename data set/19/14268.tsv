2006-05-27T09:07:00.000Z	Corey		cause im very used to phtooshop and dreamweaver
2006-05-27T09:08:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	photoshop and dreamweaver are windows software. if you really want to use them, you should run an operating system they run on. otherwise you better find linux programs :)
2006-05-27T08:45:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	kill it
2006-05-27T08:46:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	if you're not sure about the program's name, take a look with the system monitor
2006-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	use xkill
2006-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	maybe you're using broken java apps
2006-05-27T08:51:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	haven't seen limewire in a while, but it did seem to be pretty much crack
2006-05-27T09:19:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	well. sol.exe will probably work, something else might well fail
2006-05-27T09:21:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	are you actually giving the right executable as the argument for wine?
2006-05-27T09:21:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	give it the full path to the exe
2006-05-27T09:22:00.000Z	topyli	Corey	then it's not working
