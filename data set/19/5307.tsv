2008-10-17T08:37:00.000Z	break_free		trying to install hardy on a friend's toshiba laptop. it installed, but I'm not sure the power management is working. The laptop doesn't seem to turn on the fan, and i believe it is overheating and auto turning off
2008-10-17T08:37:00.000Z	break_free		any help?
2008-10-17T08:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	break_free	sudo /etc/init.d/laptop<tab> restart   (i think it'd laptop-mode  not usre so use the tab key.  <tab>
2008-10-17T08:40:00.000Z	break_free	Agent_bob	thanks i'll try that
2008-10-17T08:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	break_free	if it ok's for shutdown and restart.  and that gets it working, then you need to reorder the startup process to run that script later in the boot order.  if not...  idk.
2008-10-17T08:43:00.000Z	break_free	Agent_bob	how would I reorder the boot order
2008-10-17T08:44:00.000Z	break_free	Agent_bob	the fans aren't turning off
2008-10-17T08:44:00.000Z	Agent_bob	break_free	to answer your Q.  the symlinks in /etc/rc[S,2].d/   find the one that points at that script and change the number to a higher number.  they run in order starting with S00 through S99
2008-10-17T08:45:00.000Z	break_free		anyone else? the fans won't turn on in the laptop, it overheats and shutsdown
