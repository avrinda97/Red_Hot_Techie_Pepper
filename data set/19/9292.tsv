2007-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	I have made a fsck 3times and it had corrected some errors....
2007-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	but it's ever long
2007-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	riotkittie	cedric30	oh. no clue, sorry.
2007-03-04T15:12:00.000Z	riotkittie	cedric30	do you have any other accounts on the computer? can you log in as another user and see if the  slowness affects that account, too?
2007-03-04T15:13:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	no no other account
2007-03-04T15:14:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	it's come from my PC crash and now all is very long to start someone tell my it's come from my system file and I have to format ....
2007-03-04T15:14:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	but I can't save all my partition
2007-03-04T15:15:00.000Z	riotkittie	cedric30	formatting seems drastic. if you are outside of X, like in console, is it slow there as well?
2007-03-04T15:15:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	in console no
2007-03-04T15:16:00.000Z	cedric30	riotkittie	just for some graphic application
