2007-07-28T12:01:00.000Z	bobonthenet		My sound has suddenly stopped working could this be related to any of the recent updates?
2007-07-28T12:03:00.000Z	bobonthenet		My sound has suddenly stopped working I haven't the slightest idea what could have caused it except for maybe the most recent updates anyone have any ideas?
2007-07-28T12:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	bobonthenet	do you know what your sound device is?
2007-07-28T12:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	bobonthenet	did you figure out your sound problem?
2007-07-28T12:06:00.000Z	bobonthenet		I have everything set to autodetect and when I hit test it seems to just hang there.  The device is intel ICH5
2007-07-28T12:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	bobonthenet	there's a lot of intel sound devices, open a terminal, and type lspci, its going to output what your sound device is.. see exactly what its detected as.
2007-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	bobonthenet	IndyGunFreak	ok whats that website I use to paste this stuff into?  postbin or pastebin something like that?

2007-07-28T12:12:00.000Z	bobonthenet		indygunfreak: yes
2007-07-28T12:13:00.000Z	bobonthenet		indygunfreak: my sound has always worked fine and just stopped working today when I turned my computer on.
2007-07-28T12:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	bobonthenet	hmm, don't know, i'm googling..
2007-07-28T12:14:00.000Z	bobonthenet		indygunfreak: it caught me off guard I thought it was my speakers at first but they seem to be fine.
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	bobonthenet	hmm, can't really find anything.
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		doesnt seem anyones had much trouble with that sound device.
2007-07-28T12:19:00.000Z	bobonthenet		indygunfreak: well thanks for trying I'll keep messing around and hopefully be able to find something.  I'll probably be so obvious once I figure it out.
2007-07-28T12:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	bobonthenet	i hope so.. gl
