2007-09-06T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	narothepharoh	not saying anyone can, but if you open a terminal, type tail -f /var/log/syslog , and then slip in a cd , you'll get a log you can show people
2007-09-06T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	narothepharoh	do that tail -f /var/log/syslog thing I mentioned; it'll get you the "useful info"
