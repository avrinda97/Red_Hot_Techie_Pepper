2005-07-08T07:52:00.000Z	AlexBO		I've searched for more of one hour in the web, but I've not find anythings.
2005-07-08T07:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	sorry, looks like there are no sane users on at the moment. maybe ask again later
2005-07-08T07:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	you need to compile the program. There should be a 'INSTALL' or 'README' file telling you how to install the software
2005-07-08T07:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	also note that sane 1.0.13 is available via ubuntu; you're sure you need 1.0.14 ?
2005-07-08T07:59:00.000Z	AlexBO	HappyFool	in the readme file there aren't instructions to install it. There is the file "Makefile.in" , but i don't know how to work with "*.in" files
2005-07-08T07:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	probably './configure'
2005-07-08T07:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	however, i recommend using the ubuntu package rather than installing it yourself
2005-07-08T08:00:00.000Z	AlexBO	HappyFool	okey, where i can find it? on synaptic?
2005-07-08T08:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	yip
2005-07-08T08:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	in the 'universe' repository -- you may need to enable that
2005-07-08T08:01:00.000Z	AlexBO	HappyFool	how can i enabled it?
2005-07-08T08:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	go to that url
2005-07-08T08:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	should tell you how
2005-07-22T06:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	cdrecord has some issues with new linux kernels, or so it looks like.
2005-07-22T06:16:00.000Z	AlexBO	HappyFool	how can i make it work?
2005-07-22T06:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	i don't know; you probably can't
2005-07-22T06:17:00.000Z	AlexBO	HappyFool	REALLY? wao....that's good
2005-07-25T13:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	AlexBO	he meant this:
