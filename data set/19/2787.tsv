2011-07-03T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	I suggest you use gparted to resize your ubuntu partition and make room for an xp (or whatever windows) install with a large area of unallocated space
2011-07-03T05:42:00.000Z	ghostnik11	edbian	thanks i think i will just go with what green91, and others said its easier to install windows first after a wipe of entire system then install ubuntu 11.04 back again, thanks that way grub will have control instead of me messing around with resizing and other things that i might not be skilled at to fix if broken
2011-07-03T05:42:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	sure
2011-07-24T06:14:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	You can chmod it back to the original permissions but there is no 'undo'
2011-07-24T06:15:00.000Z	ghostnik11	edbian	can i just delete the executable and that can take care of the plugin
2011-07-24T06:15:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	I have no idea (probably not)
2011-07-24T06:16:00.000Z	ghostnik11	edbian	its just a plugin that lets me bypass megavideo limit but now i dont want it anymore
2011-07-29T03:40:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	location?
2011-07-29T03:40:00.000Z	ghostnik11	edbian	yeah you know like hd (0,1)
2011-07-29T03:40:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	/dev/sda1 means harddrive a partition 1
2011-07-29T03:40:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	in grub it would be hd(0,0) I think
2011-07-29T03:41:00.000Z	ghostnik11	edbian	okay cool thanks
2011-07-29T03:41:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	sure

2011-07-29T03:59:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	that first line is the kernel
2011-07-29T04:00:00.000Z	ghostnik11	edbian	the first line with /boot up to quiet splash vt.handoff=7
2011-07-29T04:00:00.000Z	edbian	ghostnik11	yes
