2005-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	germancito		and I need sudo to configure etc/hosts so I can use sudo again ?
2005-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	/etc/hosts is not where you change your hostname.
2005-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	germancito	trappist	please, help me
2005-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	the first line in /etc/hosts should look like this: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
2005-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	you can ADD your hostname to the end of that, but that doesn't change your hostname.
2005-12-06T16:58:00.000Z	germancito	trappist	but now i can't use sudo because I changed my name and i have a message that tellls me that I can correct the problem editing /etc/hosts
2005-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	I think you're going to have to boot into single user mode to fix this
2005-12-07T17:03:00.000Z	germancito	trappist	what's that single user mode?
2005-12-07T17:12:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	rebooting won't fix it
2005-12-07T17:13:00.000Z	germancito	trappist	whta should I do?
2005-12-07T17:13:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	reboot into single user mode to fix /etc/hosts
2005-12-07T17:15:00.000Z	germancito	trappist	Im sorry, single user mode?
2005-12-07T17:15:00.000Z	trappist	germancito	17:01 <SEJeff> trappist: Reboot the computer. At the grub prompt, hit e. Then put init=/bin/bash at the end. That will boot you into single user mode with a rootshell so you can fix /etc/hosts
2005-12-07T17:21:00.000Z	germancito	trappist	i can't do that
