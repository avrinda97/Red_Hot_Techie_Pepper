2008-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	you know you can open VIDEO_TS directories in VLC and they will play like a regular DVD
2008-08-12T21:39:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	I thought there was usually just the one VIDEO_TS directory in the first part of a DVD?
2008-08-12T21:40:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	ok
2008-08-12T21:40:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	sorry
2008-08-12T21:41:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	I'm not really sure I understand what you're trying to do
2008-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	well, does ctrl-d not work in vlc?
2008-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	whoa, that sounds like a wholly different problem that I'm not prepared to help with
2008-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	sorry man :S
2008-08-12T21:53:00.000Z	mps002	dabbu	never used ogle, sorry :S
