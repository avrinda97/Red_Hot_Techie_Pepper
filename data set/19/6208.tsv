2008-03-07T16:59:00.000Z	hischild		how can i run a program under a different user?
2008-03-07T16:59:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	with sudo
2008-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	sorry, i should clarify ... i want to run it from a script which is executed from contab
2008-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	simply add it to the correct crontab
2008-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	it'll still ask for my pass ... or not?
2008-03-07T17:01:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	if you add it to the correct users crontab, you don't need sudo
2008-03-07T17:01:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	right ... tnx
2008-04-10T21:17:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	that can cause "weird" things to happen but is mostly safe if the UID's are the same
2008-04-10T21:18:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	UID's are user id's? and how would i go about checking those?
2008-04-10T21:18:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	the 'id' command on both machines should give the same number next to your loginname
2008-04-10T21:19:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	i see. And would i be able to change that number? as my main pc as 1003 and the laptop has 1000
2008-04-10T21:19:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	difficult but not impossible. Easy to mess up and dangerous :)
2008-04-10T21:20:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	i see. So the best way to go about that would be to add a new user that has the same id and then use that user to share it. correct?
2008-04-10T21:20:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	well, they must have the same username too or some apps will get confused
2008-04-10T21:21:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	ofcourse but that's just common sense imo =)
2008-04-10T21:21:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	sounds like a new project for tonight once i get back. Thanks and good luck.
2008-04-10T21:21:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	I don't count on commen sense anymore. I've seen people in here do too many stupid things :)
2008-04-10T21:21:00.000Z	hischild	Seveas	hehe i understand
2008-12-22T05:02:00.000Z	Seveas	hischild	reinstalling auth-client-config or ldap-thingies will help
