2007-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	Gabz	bonii	 try unset LANG
2007-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	Gabz	bonii	 sorry that's the a different problem
2007-04-08T11:52:00.000Z	Gabz	bonii	 there is a no problem with some apt- proxys you need to type unset LANG before apt-get update
2007-04-08T11:52:00.000Z	bonii	Gabz	I didnt get the point. What exactly is the problem
2007-04-08T11:53:00.000Z	Gabz	bonii	 try "unset LANG"  then do a "sudo apt-get upgrade"
