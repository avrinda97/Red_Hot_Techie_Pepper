2009-12-12T12:15:00.000Z	mgi		hi everyone - I keep getting "error 22" from grub when I boot off a fresh install.. happened with mythbuntu 9.10 and it's happening with ubuntu 10.04.. what is this all about?
2009-12-12T12:15:00.000Z	mgi		I have 4 disks fyi and only one has partitions set up
2009-12-12T12:16:00.000Z	mgi		I don't think this is a 10.04-specific issue, as it comes up in mythbuntu 9.10
2009-12-12T12:16:00.000Z	mgi		but ok, I'll try in there...
2009-12-12T12:17:00.000Z	mgi		ok, thanks....
2009-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	mgi		right.. is that an option in the installer?
2009-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	mgi		joy
2009-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	mgi		I should never have reinstalled this machine..
2009-12-12T12:19:00.000Z	mgi		older version of ubuntu.. maybe 8?
2009-12-12T12:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	I think
2009-12-12T12:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	maybe not, but your not meant to get 10.04 help in here, untill the final has been released, and whilst it's still supported
2009-12-12T12:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	you can install the old version of Grub into 9.10/10.04  that might work better
2009-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	no
2009-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	oh what was on it before?
2009-12-12T12:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	oh right try 9.04
2009-12-12T12:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	you get the older version of Grub by default in 9.04, it's still a good release, and support runs out in October I think or around then
2009-12-12T12:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	plus 10.04 final is out at the end of April, which you should then do a clean install of really, if doing 9.04, or a 9.10 that wasn't a clean install even
2009-12-12T12:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.04 good idea to md5sum/sha1sum or both the ISO if you download from FTP/HTTP one of those files is the code it needs to be.  if you get from torrent it's probably ok
2009-12-12T12:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mgi	np and enjoy 9.04 :)
