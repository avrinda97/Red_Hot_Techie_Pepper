2006-05-23T06:12:00.000Z	Tonren		Man.. I wish I had known more about the way the filesystem in Linux works before I had set up my partitions
2006-05-23T06:12:00.000Z	Tonren		I gave /home 10 gigs and / only 5, but all of the packages go into /!!
2006-05-23T06:12:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	no that's a good option
2006-05-23T06:12:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	sudo apt-get clean
2006-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	But I only have 1.8GB left on / .
2006-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	What's that do, exactly..?  will it break anything?
2006-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	it will clean the downloaded packages
2006-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	Sounds good, I guess.
2006-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	yes, you don't need them after being installed
2006-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	Ooooooh. I see.
2006-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	look at a df -h before and after
2006-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	oo.  I didn't know about df.  that's a fun command
2006-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	usefull ;)
2006-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	Is it a bad sign if I experience a mote of nerdy joy every time I discover a new bash command?
2006-05-23T06:16:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	on the right way you are, young padawan
2006-05-23T06:38:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	so ?
2006-05-23T06:38:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	Hmm?
2006-05-23T06:38:00.000Z	tahorg	Tonren	you've cleaned your / ?
2006-05-23T06:38:00.000Z	Tonren	tahorg	Nope, gonna do that now
