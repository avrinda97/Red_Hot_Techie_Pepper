2010-08-12T11:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight		 I have a problem with Update manager: "The package 'brscan' is in an inconsistent state and needs to be resinstalled, but no archive can be found for it. Do you want to remove it now to continue?"
2010-08-12T11:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight		 When I click 'yes' it whirls away, but doesn't remove it. I'm offered to reinstall it. However, I cannot as dpkg complains

2010-08-12T11:17:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	you try using synaptic package manager?
2010-08-12T11:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	update manager has thrown a red circle with a white dash, like the highway code symbol on my panel. Clicking on it its tried to resolve it.
2010-08-12T11:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	basically it says that I need to reinstall and/or remove brscan - but I can't
2010-08-12T11:18:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	not the update manager, the package manager. you can fix broken packages etc in there
2010-08-12T11:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	I'm getting the same messages: E: the package brscan3 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it. E: internal error opening cache (1) Please report
2010-08-12T11:20:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	can you mark it for complete removal?
2010-08-12T11:22:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	I click 'ok' and synaptic closes
2010-08-12T11:22:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	ok? or apply
2010-08-12T11:23:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	if your big idea is synaptic fogged it
2010-08-12T11:24:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	do you have the package to install?
2010-08-12T11:24:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	yes
2010-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	i wouldnt rip it out. what is your issue ?
2010-08-13T11:03:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	you can pick alsa oss or pulse, depending on the app, and depending on what the app works best with. wine wise, alot of games like OSS
2010-08-13T11:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Wiesshund	I know that people at #winehq think pulseaudio sux :s
2010-08-13T11:09:00.000Z	Wiesshund	livingdaylight	so dont use pulseaudio for wine, youve got 3 choices
