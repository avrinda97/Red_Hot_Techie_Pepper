2004-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	ElVirolo		I have a realtek network card which is pretty standard
2004-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	ElVirolo		i do not have dhcpclient running
2004-10-14T12:07:00.000Z	ElVirolo		i don't think so anyway
2004-10-14T12:07:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	what kind? specifics always get quicker better answers
2004-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	8139cp or 8139too module?
2004-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	8139too
2004-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	does the card actually die? can it still ping itself?
2004-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	sorry you can still ping the router cant you
2004-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	no it's still there and pings itself
2004-10-14T12:17:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	a Comtrend CT-600 VOIP router
2004-10-14T12:19:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	i dont believe that it only does dhcp on the usb interface, that dosent make sense
2004-10-14T12:20:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	well, i am positively sure it does
2004-10-14T12:20:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	have you tried? 
2004-10-14T12:21:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	the debian installer doesn't find a dhcp server on the router ...
2004-10-14T12:22:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	i didnt mean i dont believe you, i just meant "i dont believe it" it seems strange
2004-10-14T12:22:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ElVirolo	what does route show?
2004-10-14T12:22:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	i understand :) 
2004-10-14T12:29:00.000Z	ElVirolo	linux_mafia	i have to go pretty soon
