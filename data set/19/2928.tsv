2009-11-24T02:02:00.000Z	kndg99		Q: I'm having difficulty connecting to any named internet resource... I can ping them with responses, however unable to open them in browser, any thoughts?
2009-11-24T02:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kndg99	for testing (assuming you're using firefox) "cd ~ && mv .mozilla .mozilla_BACKUP" then try firefox again
2009-11-24T02:04:00.000Z	kndg99	ZykoticK9	ty
2009-11-24T02:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kndg99	did that work?

2009-11-24T02:09:00.000Z	kndg99	ZykoticK9	I ran updates today which did a partial update.
2009-11-24T02:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kndg99	if you haven't already you'll want to undo my testing change "cd ~ && mv .mozilla_BACKUP .mozilla"
