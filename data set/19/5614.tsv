2008-09-07T00:04:00.000Z	Chlorate	IndyGunFreak	Okay. what do you suggest?
2008-09-07T00:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	hold on..
2008-09-07T00:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	are you using 32bit or 64bit?
2008-09-07T00:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	are you using 32bit or 64bit?
2008-09-07T00:06:00.000Z	Chlorate	IndyGunFreak	64 sorry.
2008-09-07T00:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	let me look, but i think for 64bit, you have to use ndiswrapper, lemme check
2008-09-07T00:09:00.000Z	Chlorate	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-Az: So what do you both suggest?
2008-09-07T00:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	what model laptop do you have?
2008-09-07T00:10:00.000Z	Chlorate	IndyGunFreak	Toshiba Satellite A305D
2008-09-07T00:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	well, like i said, you're gonna have to use ndiswrapper w/32bit... i personally don't like ndiswrapper, and avoid it.. so someone else will have to help you w/ that
2008-09-07T00:12:00.000Z	Chlorate	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-Az: Well I'm willing to try anything. Just point me in a direction.
2008-09-07T00:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	well, follow Azazel-AZ advice, and try to get it working w/ 64bit and ndiswrapper, if that doesn't work, download and burn 32bit, and cmoe back.. i've set that device up for multitudes of people under 32bit.. w/o issue.
2008-09-07T00:13:00.000Z	Chlorate	IndyGunFreak	Okay.
2008-09-07T00:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chlorate	note though, to switch to 32bit, your'e gonna have  to do a reinstall.
