2010-02-07T07:09:00.000Z	rick_		the one problem with FF is that it is a resource hog.  just sitting at a blank page it jumps my cpu useage from about 10% to 25%.
2010-02-07T07:11:00.000Z	rick_		how often do people have to reinstall ubuntu cause it gets curropted like windows?
2010-02-07T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 varey rarely.
2010-02-07T07:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 the biggest danger to your linux box.. is the admin doing somthing silly. :)
2010-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 'terminal' machine. :)
2010-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 ssh in, run htop, just watch the  loads.. :)
2010-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	rick_	Dr_Willis	you lost me
2010-02-07T07:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 i have serial terminals - and so forth run serial cable, or use network. and you got a spare console
2010-02-07T07:20:00.000Z	rick_	Dr_Willis	basically a dumb gui terminal then?
2010-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 err.. NO gui at all.. its a 'serial terminal' :)
2010-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 just like you got on the 'console'
2010-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 there are 'X terminals' also  that can do GUI/X but those are a little rare these days
2010-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	rick_	Dr_Willis	okay thanks.  I don't think I'll ever be doing/needing that type of setup ever.
2010-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 it can come in handy at times
2010-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 kernel dev's use it all the time i hear.
2010-02-07T07:23:00.000Z	rick_	Dr_Willis	i'm far from being a kernel Dev.  I'd rather make a stripped down kernel into a car pc or something of the sort.
2010-02-07T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 i used serial cables the other day to transfer stuff to/from my AMIGA. :)
2010-02-07T07:24:00.000Z	rick_	Dr_Willis	well if you found a usb port on an Amiga i'd wonder how you frankenstien'd that into it!!!
2010-02-07T07:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rick_	 of course Now i realize that the linux kernel can read/write amiga FS' so i can move the amigas hd  to this box copuy stff over. :)
