2010-01-26T02:40:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	what scrooling effect are you after
2010-01-26T02:45:00.000Z	madmike	koshari	 I just want to scroll desktops using the mouse, instead of keyboard, or actually clicking in the little desktopswitcher
2010-01-26T02:46:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	if you install compiz you can use the mouse scroller to change veiwports
2010-01-26T02:47:00.000Z	madmike	koshari	can I just install compiz from synaptic?  Will I have to configure anything to allow compiz to work?
2010-01-26T02:48:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	you can install compiz from synaptic, and use compiz settings manager to change the settings
2010-01-26T02:49:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	the scale plugin daffy speaks of is VERY handy
2010-01-26T02:54:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	compiz is very customisable, advanced things like having specific windows always open in an exact spot in exact size are handy as well
2010-01-26T03:55:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	use the cube, and mouse scroller to rotate
2010-01-26T03:57:00.000Z	madmike	koshari	 where is mouse scroller?  I got desktop cube working, but I can't find any options.  All it gives me is key grabbing
2010-01-26T03:57:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	in between the left and right buttons on the mouse
2010-01-26T03:58:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	i take it you have a scroller on your mouse?
2010-01-26T03:58:00.000Z	madmike	koshari	 My middle button (scroll button) isn't registering
2010-01-26T03:59:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	open up xev and check for what event your scroller posts
2010-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	then you somply allocate the key to the binding
2010-01-26T04:01:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	my scroller is button 4 and button 5
2010-01-26T04:02:00.000Z	madmike	koshari	 yup, button 2 is scroller, and 4/5 for up/down, they are already assigned to events, just nothing happens when I try to use them
2010-01-26T04:04:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	thats odd? possobly you have a clash of events, however it will usually trll you,
2010-01-26T04:04:00.000Z	madmike	koshari	 thanks for the help, I have to go though, I'll keep playing with it later though
2010-01-26T04:05:00.000Z	koshari	madmike	the cursur needs to be on the desktop and NOT over an app for rotate btw
