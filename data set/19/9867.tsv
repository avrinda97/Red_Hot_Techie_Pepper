2008-05-19T09:31:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hey, I've got a machine here I've just installed Xubuntu 8.04 on. It's a Celeron 1.7Ghz with 256MB RAM and it's hammering the hard-drive every time I try and do something. Is this a configuration problem or hardware?
2008-05-19T09:31:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	if it's that fresh of an install it's probably just indexing
2008-05-19T09:32:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	Wouldn't that happen in one big bunch though? This only happens when I open something.
2008-05-19T09:32:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	By indexing you mean updatedb, right?
2008-05-19T09:32:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	no .. tracker.. updatedb belongs to "locate".. tracker is the new  one.
2008-05-19T09:33:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	ah hah. I must read about how it works.
2009-06-23T18:02:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	yes.. it uses iptables to do it.
2009-06-23T18:02:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	is there a gui to turn it off?
2009-06-23T18:02:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	what are you trying to do that you can't?
2009-06-23T18:03:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	I'm having trouble getting an IP from dhcp. Can get the network if I set it static and I can see the request for an address on the router, but it doesn't accept the response.
2009-06-23T18:05:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	the firewall wouldn't be preventing that. but it was a good thought.  Is this a wireless connection?
2009-06-23T18:05:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	nope, wired.
2009-06-23T18:06:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	I fixed it.
2009-06-23T18:06:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	how?
2009-06-23T18:07:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	DHCP had a reservation for the MAC with the wrong hostname. Switched it to the correct hostname and everything came good.
2009-06-23T18:07:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	ta for the response :)
2009-06-23T18:07:00.000Z	scunizi	AzMoo	np :)
2009-06-23T18:08:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	having said that, *is* there somewhere to modify the firewall, for future reference?
2009-06-23T18:09:00.000Z	AzMoo	scunizi	nice one, thanks. I've played with iptables a bit in the past for masquerading, so I'm not entirely unfamiliar.
