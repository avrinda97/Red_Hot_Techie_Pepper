2005-07-28T09:31:00.000Z	biscuit_		Im using whatever it's set at.... it's ok
2005-07-28T09:32:00.000Z	biscuit_		1024x768 does look kinda bad on Linux for some reason and not windows.. but it could be the 17 inchmonitor......
2005-07-28T09:32:00.000Z	biscuit_		Umm
2005-07-28T09:32:00.000Z	biscuit_		I understood two words!
