2007-10-01T09:53:00.000Z	drizzyt		can someone please help me with an nvidia driver issue?
2007-10-01T09:55:00.000Z	drizzyt		can someone tell me how to find the device PCI id of a video card?
2007-10-01T09:55:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	type "lspci"
2007-10-01T09:58:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	, theres your answer :) Youre at PCI address 1:00:00
2007-10-01T09:59:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	what do you mean?
2007-10-01T10:00:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	, that looks fine... mine is: 03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV40 [GeForce 6800 XT]  (rev a1)
2007-10-01T10:03:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	well, what are you trying to do?
2007-10-01T10:04:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	I would suggest first trying just the restricted drivers on ubuntu before using NVidia's binary drivers
2007-10-01T10:05:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	Hm... I'd say try the binary drivers then but expect to have to recompile them with every kernel upgrade
2007-10-01T10:06:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	, before you do that though
2007-10-01T10:07:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	, the latest drivers from nvidia should work with your card
2007-10-01T10:08:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	have you tried installing nvidia-glx-new?
2007-10-01T10:09:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	do what
2007-10-01T10:11:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	when you do that, you also might want to run nvidia-xconfig
2007-10-01T10:12:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	comes with the installation I believe
2007-10-01T10:13:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	yes, but Im trying to remember what options to run with it... hanf on
2007-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	honestly, I install my nvidia drivers with Envy so Im not really an expert on all that :)
2007-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	yeah then last thing is just try the binary driver bro :)
2007-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	marx2k	drizzyt	no problem :D
