2008-12-08T12:14:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	i can try ;p
2008-12-08T12:16:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	So I've been trying to get my tv out to come out in color
2008-12-08T12:16:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	what's up w. your ati issue?
2008-12-08T12:17:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	specs on the card? program being used, etc?
2008-12-08T12:18:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	RADEON 2400 HD, using various drivers, most recently the ati proprietary version, with aticonfig
2008-12-08T12:18:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	let me see what i can find, but i know ati and its tv out is pretty iffy
2008-12-08T12:19:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	 Yeah, that's what I've been hearing..
2008-12-08T12:21:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	i'm looking into you're issue, i promise :]
2008-12-08T12:23:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	My problem is, on a recent install I was able to control the --tv-geometry through aticonfig.  But on this install, I can't.  I speculate that it has something to do with my various attempts at driver installs.  I'm thinking that it may have something to do with driver conflicts.  So I need to know how to find all the drivers installed, remove them, and start with a fresh, single, install
2008-12-08T12:23:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	Thank you by the way :)
2008-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	np
2008-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	dude, from what i'm reading, you're lucky to even have tv out at all w. that card :p
2008-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	still searching though
2008-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	Yeah, I know.  But I'm confident there is a way.  There has to be.   Please god, there has to be
2008-12-08T12:30:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	have you attempted using the catalyst control center?
2008-12-08T12:32:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	At the moment, I don't have a windows manager installed.  Just xserver.  I'm going for a minimal boxee install
2008-12-08T12:32:00.000Z	piklesonfire	tyebud	ah, i see, sorry, a few more moments of research then. lol
2008-12-08T12:33:00.000Z	tyebud	piklesonfire	Sure thing.  Take your time
