2007-10-30T07:04:00.000Z	sirjoebob		anytime i move an icon on my desktop, it is copying instead of moving... any ideas?
2007-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	what do you mean by mvoing, shifting it around on the desktop?
2007-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	just simply clicking and draggin it somewhere else on the desktop
2007-10-30T07:07:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	How long has this been happening
2007-10-30T07:07:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	all day...
2007-10-30T07:08:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	I can't replicate the problem
2007-10-30T07:08:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	i understand that. it is only something with my local machine and i dont know what is going on
2007-10-30T07:09:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	so a restart didn't fix it, is your mouse stuffed?
2007-10-30T07:10:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	restart did nothing. stuffed?? i dont follow. it moves it when i hold ctrl... it is like move and copy are flipped.
2007-10-30T07:11:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	have you check your mouse preferences under System->Prefereces->Mouse?
2007-10-30T07:12:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	Not left mouse button ticked is it
2007-10-30T07:12:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	nothing is stuck on
2007-10-30T07:13:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	do you have the option of trying another mouse, a spare one?
2007-10-30T07:13:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	it is a touchpad on my laptop and it does not act up on anything besides the desktop
2007-10-30T07:14:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	nevermind. it just fixed itself
2007-10-30T07:14:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	thanks anyways
2007-10-30T07:14:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	has there been any updates to the Xserver or anyother updates recently, i.e. has anything changed much or been updated on your system.
2007-10-30T07:15:00.000Z	sirjoebob	genforty	i was messing with nautilus earlier and i think that is what did it
2007-10-30T07:18:00.000Z	genforty	sirjoebob	If I were you, I would create another account and see if it goes back to normal. If it does then I would either copy stuff across to the new user account. The other option is to try open your home folder and go to edit->preferences and under there are some mouse settings.
