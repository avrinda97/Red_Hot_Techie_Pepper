2010-10-15T01:48:00.000Z	Viliny		hey guys, my file server recently broke so moved the Hard drive to a similar computer but the target machine has a integrated intel gfx card as opposed to the original nvidia gfx - im getting low graphics mode when i get to ubuntu now and it's failing to load nvidia drivers--- obviously... how do i make the switch in gfx drivers?
2010-10-15T01:48:00.000Z	phisher1	Viliny	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-10-15T01:49:00.000Z	Viliny	phisher1	thanks, it's done now without any feedback - it's ok now?
2010-10-15T01:50:00.000Z	phisher1	Viliny	eh, actually, goto console, stop gdm, then run that
