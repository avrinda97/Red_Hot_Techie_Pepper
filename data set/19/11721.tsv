2005-12-07T06:08:00.000Z	pygrammer		so, /var/lib/asterisk already exists, but why?
2005-12-07T06:08:00.000Z	pygrammer		i don't think i'd installed asterisk before...and if i had, it wouldn't be to /var/lib/asterisk
2005-12-07T06:08:00.000Z	pygrammer		but .... Errors were encountered while processing:
2005-12-07T06:08:00.000Z	pygrammer		 asterisk
2005-12-07T06:08:00.000Z	pygrammer		can anyone help? supposedly it installed
2005-12-07T06:08:00.000Z	pygrammer		but the error doesn't make me feel very good
2005-12-07T06:09:00.000Z	pygrammer		in my not so humble opinion :)
2005-12-07T06:09:00.000Z	pygrammer		i'm not running X on the server ;)
2005-12-07T06:09:00.000Z	pygrammer		meh
2005-12-07T06:10:00.000Z	pygrammer		I don't know how to use aptitude
2005-12-07T06:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	pygrammer	there's a wiki page IIRC
2005-12-07T06:10:00.000Z	pygrammer	Xenguy	for what?
2005-12-07T06:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	pygrammer	aptitude
2005-12-07T06:11:00.000Z	pygrammer	Xenguy	well, I sorta figured it out -- but it doesn't say anything about it being broken
2005-12-07T06:12:00.000Z	pygrammer	Xenguy	but the error didn't make me feel very good -- why would it error if it worked?
2005-12-07T06:12:00.000Z	pygrammer	Xenguy	it seems to work, but i don't know if it's set up right
2005-12-07T06:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	pygrammer	what error?
2005-12-07T06:12:00.000Z	pygrammer	Xenguy	I pasted it above
2005-12-07T06:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	pygrammer	sorry, supper calls :-)
