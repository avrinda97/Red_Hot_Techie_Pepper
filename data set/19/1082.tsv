2011-05-16T02:04:00.000Z	kajakajo		I'm just getting back into linux, a re-newb; remind me of the terminal command to see the system processes in tree form, someone, please?
2011-05-16T02:04:00.000Z	kajakajo		thanks hey_joe
2011-05-16T02:06:00.000Z	kajakajo		can someone point me to a nice linux beginner's guide, teaching commands and function in progressive steps from a pretty beginner level?
2011-05-16T02:07:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	linux for dummies book
2011-05-16T02:07:00.000Z	kajakajo	pfifo	I'm a poor student living in a foreign country--something online please?
2011-05-16T02:10:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	a google search will turn up many guides, butthis might be a bit better http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html
2011-05-16T04:18:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	unplug any other devices from usb that might be using too much power
2011-05-16T04:43:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	haha you said it 'unzip'
2011-05-16T04:44:00.000Z	kajakajo	pfifo	thanks
2011-05-16T04:45:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	unzipping as a normal user and then moving to /usr/src is a safer approach
2011-05-16T04:53:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	`sudo apt-get install dkms`
2011-05-16T04:53:00.000Z	kajakajo	pfifo	d'oh. Thanks.
2011-05-16T04:56:00.000Z	kajakajo	pfifo	more newb questions from someone who is obviously really rusty and never was that good in the first place: need to move all contents of a folder into another folder--best way to do this in terminal?
2011-05-16T04:58:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	I use `cp -a /path/to/source /path/to/dest`
2011-05-16T05:08:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	copy and then remove
2011-05-16T05:10:00.000Z	kajakajo	pfifo	but how do I tell cp to select all of the contents? Does recursive (-r) do that? I wouldn't think so, but I don't see any other options, and I don't know exactly how to apply that. That you use -a is puzzling to me, also. feeling stupid and confused.
2011-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	i use -a, which combines r and several other options... why dont you make a test directory and play with it a bit to see what works for you
2011-05-16T05:12:00.000Z	kajakajo	pfifo	I will certainly play some, I guess.
2011-05-16T05:14:00.000Z	pfifo	kajakajo	thats `cp -a folder/* ./`
