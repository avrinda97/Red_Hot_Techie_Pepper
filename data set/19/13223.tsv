2005-05-03T06:06:00.000Z	danwolf		I am having a hal problem, when I login to gnome, I get a "Failed to initialize HAL" erro, then I have to kill dbus-daemon-1 to get gnome to fully come up. Then I have about 20 20-hal.hotplug running and about the same 10-hal.dev
2005-05-03T06:06:00.000Z	danwolf		someone please help
2005-05-03T06:08:00.000Z	danwolf		when I try killing a bunch of the hotplugs, I get a kill process in zombie status
2005-05-03T06:08:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	have you tried with a fresh user?
2005-05-03T06:09:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	tried reinstalling ubuntu alltogether last night
2005-05-03T06:09:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	definitely file a bug, even if you can fix it
2005-05-03T06:09:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	i won't be able to fix it, but better people will :)
2005-05-03T06:12:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	ca you try?
2005-05-03T06:13:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	literally don't have a clue, how long has the bug been filed?
2005-05-03T06:13:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	week and a half or so
2005-05-03T06:14:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	I will paste you the bug link
2005-05-03T06:14:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	can't hurt
2005-05-03T06:14:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9864
2005-05-03T06:15:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	I found something somewhere that said that I could put a line in my grub kernel params to fix it
2005-05-03T06:15:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	but when I do that I get an error on start up about failed to find ide-mod module
2005-05-03T06:16:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	so I don't think that that is even working
2005-05-03T06:16:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	:/
2005-05-03T06:16:00.000Z	danwolf	mkde	any idea about that module?
2005-05-03T06:17:00.000Z	mkde	danwolf	none sorry
