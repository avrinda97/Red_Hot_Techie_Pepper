2006-05-25T05:17:00.000Z	duneatreides		hello
2006-05-25T05:18:00.000Z	duneatreides		i'm trying to compile gnomebaker
2006-05-25T05:18:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	why
2006-05-25T05:19:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	why are you compiling it
2006-05-25T05:20:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	have you seen anything I have said?
2006-05-25T05:20:00.000Z	duneatreides	Kyral	i'm new to Linux, and I want to give it a shot
2006-05-25T05:20:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	good enough answer :D
2006-05-25T05:20:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-05-25T05:21:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	best way to find depends for an app is tto keep running the ./configure and installing what it says it misses
2006-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	since you want to learn, I won' give you outright answers (and I ask that no one else does :P)
2006-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	but use apt-cache search <whatever it says you are missing>
2006-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	I will point you in the right direction
2006-05-25T05:26:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	tthere is a difference between giving the answers and giving hints :P
2006-05-25T05:26:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	thats GTK
2006-05-25T05:26:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	apt-cache search glib and choose the -dev package
2006-05-25T05:28:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	it contains the parts of the library needed for compiling from them
2006-05-25T05:28:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	as opposed tot the "object" files
2006-05-25T05:28:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	if you coded in C or C++ this would be easier to explain :P
2006-05-25T05:46:00.000Z	Kyral	duneatreides	tar -zxvf <filename>
