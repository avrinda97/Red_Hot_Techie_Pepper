2009-06-11T06:30:00.000Z	hanasaki		I have multiple NIC's in the pc . one is a pci tulip based linksys 10./100 nc100  it does not show up in lspci... how do I get it to show up and get a dhcp address?
2009-06-11T06:32:00.000Z	hanasaki		how do I find the driver for my NIC ?
2009-06-11T06:32:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	it's probably already installed
2009-06-11T06:33:00.000Z	hanasaki	fryguy	 doesn't show up in lspci and ifconfig doesn't show the eth... what can I do?
2009-06-11T06:34:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	is it onboard? is it enabled in the bios?  If it doesn't show up in lspci then there is nothing linux can do about it.
2009-06-11T06:34:00.000Z	hanasaki	fryguy	 the onboard works fine it's a SIS... this is a pci I bought for a 2nd NIC
2009-06-11T06:34:00.000Z	hanasaki	fryguy	 the link lights are on
2009-06-11T06:34:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	pastebin lspci -vvv then
2009-06-11T06:35:00.000Z	hanasaki		!pastebin

2009-06-11T06:37:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	are you sure te card is seated correctly? if it doesn't show up in lspci then it's a hardware issue
2009-06-11T06:37:00.000Z	hanasaki	fryguy	the sis190 works .. that is on the motherboard.... the other is a nc100
2009-06-11T06:38:00.000Z	hanasaki		fry.. I am sure.  it is an old card I had in another box ages ago.  it worked
2009-06-11T06:38:00.000Z	hanasaki		fryguy:
2009-06-11T06:39:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	if it's not listed in lspci then it's a hardware problem
2009-06-11T06:39:00.000Z	hanasaki	fryguy	 could it be a conflict between the onboard and the nic pci? although I tried deactivating the onboard in bios and got the same bad results
2009-06-11T06:39:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	no
2009-06-11T06:40:00.000Z	fryguy	hanasaki	just take the card out and put it back in (maybe in a different slot)
2009-06-11T06:40:00.000Z	hanasaki	fryguy	 I tried both slots :(   how many notches in a pci card connector?
