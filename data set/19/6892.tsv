2007-11-19T09:02:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	since you said you have a router, you have to forward a port on your router through to each machine you want to run bittorrent on, and assuming azureus uses the same default port on each installation, you would have to change azureus settings on each machine to be a different port, and forward each on your router
2007-11-19T09:10:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	see my reply from a few minutes ago

2007-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	drizzt69	astro76	how do i do that ?
2007-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	I don't use azureus personally
2007-11-19T09:13:00.000Z	drizzt69	astro76	how do i get into my routers settings ?
2007-11-19T09:13:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	but each would need a different port, then on the router you can forward the appropriate port to the appropriate IP
2007-11-19T09:14:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	most have web interface, and most are 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 by default
2007-11-19T10:02:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	your router, did you ever figure out how to get into the web config page?
2007-11-19T10:02:00.000Z	drizzt69	astro76	yes but i don't know what to do there
2007-11-19T10:40:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	you do understand it's illegal to copy copyrighted software?

2007-11-19T10:44:00.000Z	drizzt69	astro76	you know why its shutting down all of my torrent programs as soon as they open?
2007-11-19T10:45:00.000Z	astro76	drizzt69	no idea about azureus
2007-11-19T10:47:00.000Z	drizzt69	astro76	it did the same in bittorrent but now i can't even find bittorrent and it won't let me reinstall it because it says its still there and won't let me un-install it
