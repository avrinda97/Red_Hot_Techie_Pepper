2006-11-09T10:43:00.000Z	aro_ron		hey all
2006-11-09T10:44:00.000Z	aro_ron		I need some help installing edgy
2006-11-09T10:44:00.000Z	aro_ron		I had been running dapper since its release in june
2006-11-09T10:44:00.000Z	aro_ron		but managed to bork my upgrade to edgy, so I am tryingto instal from scratch
2006-11-09T10:45:00.000Z	aro_ron		but I cant get the installer to actually install
2006-11-09T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aro_ron	On what architecture
2006-11-09T10:46:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	x86 arch
2006-11-09T10:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aro_ron	Did you reformat the partition first? ( the liveCD installer is picky )
2006-11-09T10:47:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	not yet, think that will do it? cause the instaler has a reformat option, but it wont run it
2006-11-09T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aro_ron	What error does it give when you try to reformat?
2006-11-09T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aro_ron	That last comment was for aro_ron, sorry.
2006-11-09T10:49:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	it simply says no root filesystem
2006-11-09T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aro_ron	When in gparted?
2006-11-09T10:50:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	no, gparted seems to deal with it alright, its when I click next to set the mount points that it stops
2006-11-09T10:50:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	I am running it live right now, so I can try anything
2006-11-09T10:53:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	I still have all the leftover files from my borked dapper install, inclusing my GRUB instal for dual booting with XP. could any of that be affecting it?
2006-11-09T10:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aro_ron	If you still have files from dapper, did you not reformat or do you just have another partition?
2006-11-09T10:56:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	I havnt reformatted yet, as I was expecting the installer to do that. I have a NTFS and an EXT3 partition
2006-11-09T11:05:00.000Z	aro_ron	Jordan_U	wel, seems like reformatting did the trick, installer is running fine now,thanks!
