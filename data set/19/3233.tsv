2009-10-13T12:25:00.000Z	bigmack83_		anyone know why the 'screen' app would have no gui in the terminal, but would otherwise work normally. but im not able to use any of the gui functions
2009-10-13T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	screen doesn't have any GUI functionality
2009-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	normally on the bottom theres small area that shows what screen you on, and your able to press F9 to get into a menu, i dont see those
2009-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	The bottom area is a hardstatus line, that's a configuration thing.
2009-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	Oh, you might be talking about screen-profiles?
2009-10-13T12:27:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	ok so more just a fancy text border at the bottom than a gui, but yea
2009-10-13T12:28:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	i installed screen-profiles and screen-profiles-extras but theres still nothing. but yes thats what im talking about
2009-10-13T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	I think screen-profiles has an f9 menu, screen certainly doesn't.
2009-10-13T12:29:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	well before i reinstalled when i just entered 'screen' everything showed up. now on a new install it doesnt
2009-10-13T12:31:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	any idea how i would get that hardline then? ive installed screen profiles but nothing and when i try googling it it just up with stuff related to the physical screen monitor
2009-10-13T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	well, if you want the f9 thing, then you'll have to get screen-profiles setup, which I know nothing about.
2009-10-13T12:32:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	i found it. apparently in karmic screen has absolutely no hardline, and to use it they renamed screen-profiles to 'byobu', so running 'byobu' instead of screen gets it
2009-10-13T12:33:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	thanks
2009-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	^^
2009-10-13T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	What version of Ubuntu?
2009-10-13T12:45:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	hardy 8.10
2009-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	Flannel	bigmack83_	8.04 is Hardy, and screen-profiles didn't make the repos until 9.04 (Jaunty) it seems.
2009-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	oh yea my bad. not hardy. but it is 8.10
2009-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	bigmack83_	Flannel	ah ok, thanks
