2012-07-06T14:54:00.000Z	wmp	gaelfx	if you have too big money...
2012-07-06T14:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	what's your sound card?
2012-07-06T14:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	have you tried plugging in the HDMI and seeing if sound is coming out there?
2012-07-06T14:57:00.000Z	wmp	gaelfx	i can try this
2012-07-06T15:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	did hdmi audio ever work for you?
2012-07-06T15:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	in Ubuntu?
2012-07-06T15:01:00.000Z	wmp	gaelfx	yes ;)
2012-07-06T15:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	ah, did you install a backports kernel?
2012-07-06T15:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	have you installed the alsa backports?
2012-07-06T15:04:00.000Z	wmp	gaelfx	i havent this package in repos, and i havent installed it
2012-07-06T15:04:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	it's ok, I have no reason to think it would work, was just guessing
2012-07-06T15:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	and you did lsmod | grep snd and snd-hda-intel showed up?
2012-07-06T15:06:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	ok, last thing, and I know it's a stupid question to ask, but you're sure the correct audio device is selected in your Sound Settings?
2012-07-06T15:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	have you tried selecting a different kernel when you start up and see if that works?
2012-07-06T15:08:00.000Z	wmp	gaelfx	this isn't good idea, becouse on this kernel all work for long time
2012-07-06T15:09:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	yeah, but it would help in identifying the issue. all you have to do is start up the machine and hold shift until grub shows up, then select an older kernel and see if it gets your audio back
2012-07-06T15:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	if it does, then we have some idea about how to solve the problem, if not, you restart into the kernel you're using now, nothing lost
2012-07-06T15:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	success! :D
2012-07-06T15:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	wmp	you've experienced what I like to call a hiccup. happens to all of us, no worries
