2012-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	damagednoob		i'm running Ubuntu 11.10 and I just got a new router but I can't seem to connect to it consistently. I've run several commands and the output can be seen here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1040384/.
2012-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	damagednoob		On failures, I seem to be getting a 'Reason 2' error in dmesg which seems to mean 'Previous authentications no longer valid'
2012-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	you mean your "wifi" and your AP(access point).
2012-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	well i don't think there's anything wrong with my laptop's wifi or my AP, I dual boot win7 and it connects without a problem everytime
2012-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	says the ip is 192.168.1.66
2012-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	can you do ping 192.168.1.1 ?
2012-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	nope, but the gateway is set to 192.168.1.254
2012-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	and your ap is "MyWifiNetwork" ?
2012-06-14T11:18:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	yes
2012-06-14T11:19:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	um.. so what about pinging to .254 then?
2012-06-14T11:19:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	that works, i get a response
2012-06-14T11:20:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	oh it does.. then what "does" not work?
2012-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	maybe you mean the dns isnt working?
2012-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	it takes a long time to connect to a wifi network, today, 3 and a half minutes
2012-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	what does the wired ethernet get as it's ip?
2012-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	when I look at the output from dmesg, i see a 'Reason 2' error right before it connects to the same network
2012-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	the wired shouldn't get a similar ip in the same subnet (eg: it shouldnt get an ip from the same AP router)
2012-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	jagginess	damagednoob	disconnect the ethernet?
2012-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	damagednoob	jagginess	i'm not connected via cable, i only connect via wifi
