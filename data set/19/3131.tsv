2009-10-22T03:15:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	what about a solution that doesn't use virtualiztion of windows the laptop isn't good enough to run vms
2010-06-21T23:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	What graphics card?
2010-06-21T23:40:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	Intel Graphics card... thats all lspci tells me
2010-06-21T23:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	What is the output of this command: glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"
2010-06-21T23:47:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	direct rendering: Yes
2010-06-21T23:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	Could you pastebin the outpu from "dmesg | grep drm"
2010-06-21T23:52:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	 dmesg | grep drm returns no results
2010-06-21T23:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	Ok, that means that you aren't using Kernel Mode Setting for some reason (it may have been blacklisted for cards similar to yours). Enabling KMS may get you better performance.
2010-06-21T23:54:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	 btw, /var/log/kern.log is huge and full of lines similar to Jun 21 14:53:53 juggalo-laptop kernel: [ 3107.237522] hda-intel: spurious response 0x0:0x0, last cmd=0x270600
2010-06-21T23:56:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	how do i enable KMS?
2010-06-21T23:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes  explains how to re-enable KMS, though there is a chance that will cause hard locks with your hardware.
2010-06-22T00:01:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	im not quite sure this is a i8xx chip tho.... output of lspci for VGA is: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation System Controller Hub (SCH Poulsbo) Graphics Controller [8086:8108] (rev 07)
2010-06-22T00:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	Oh, poulsbo...
2010-06-22T00:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dopple	Poulsbo has notoriously bad linux support.
2010-06-22T00:03:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	i was afraid you were gonna say that :-/
2010-06-22T00:07:00.000Z	dopple	Jordan_U	any suggestions for this video card? :-) i really dont wanna scrap the ubuntu idea
