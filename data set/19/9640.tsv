2009-07-08T01:40:00.000Z	darrend		hi.  I just lost all sound.  Speakers are fine, all sound modules are loaded.  Tried "sudo killall pulseaudio && sudo alsa force-reload" to no avail.  Nothing obvious in logs.. anything more I can do?
2009-07-08T01:41:00.000Z	cube_	darrend	tried simply rebooting?
2009-07-08T01:41:00.000Z	darrend	cube_	trying to avoid it :)  3 people logged in, lots of stuff open.
