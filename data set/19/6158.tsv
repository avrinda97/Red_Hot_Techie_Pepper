2008-04-05T18:34:00.000Z	azuki		I am trying to mount a .bin file to a cdrom.... so I made the dir /media/[mountdir] .... and typed "mount -o loop vfat [.bin location] /media/[mountdir] .... but it says :  wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop1 ... any suggestions? (soz for repost)
2008-04-05T18:35:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	what format is the .bin file?
2008-04-05T18:35:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	using "file" it says "data"
2008-04-05T18:35:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	that doesn't tell me much :)
2008-04-05T18:36:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	hmm.. yea.. didn't tell me much either
2008-04-05T18:37:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	what do you mean?
2008-04-05T18:37:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	I'm wondering whether the file is even mountable.  what makes you think it i?
2008-04-05T18:37:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	I used to mount it in windows.. it's a cd image
2008-04-05T18:38:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	"sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 file.bin /media/iso" then?
2008-04-05T18:40:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	it's saying wrong FS-type

2008-04-05T19:16:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	pls repeat your question
2008-04-05T19:17:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	I want to unmount a drive, because I thought it would REPLACE a mount, not ADD... and I mounted a drive on a place where there allready was a mount.. now I cant unmount them...
2008-04-05T19:20:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	the last mount will overshadow the first.  the 1st will still be mounted, but you won't see it until you umount the 2nd
2008-04-05T19:20:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	try umount with the device, or with the mount point (whichever you didn't try)
2008-04-05T19:21:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	"mount" on its own will list what's mounted, and where
2008-04-05T19:21:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	you need to not be "cd"ed to it in any terminal, and not have any files open on it
2008-04-05T19:25:00.000Z	dooglus	azuki	close any file browsers or terminals that are using /media/reason
2008-04-05T19:25:00.000Z	azuki	dooglus	& kbrooks thnx!
