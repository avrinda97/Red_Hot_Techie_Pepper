2005-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	are you running hoary or breezy or warty?
2005-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel	nalioth	hoary, sorry for the pause in my response
2005-09-01T15:54:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	then at a terminal, type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and try the VESA driver
2005-09-01T15:56:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel	nalioth	i am trying to make nvidia drivers work right now, as it was looking for the onboard card and not the PCI card, i will try VESA if this fails
2005-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	you've disabled the onboard card in the bios?
2005-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel	nalioth	not my PC, not sure, i'm guessing no, how would i do this?
2005-09-01T15:58:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	when the puter first starts up, hit "DEL" and you'll come to a bios screen
2005-09-01T15:59:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	find the onboard settings and disable the onboard video
2005-09-01T15:59:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	yes, VESA will drive a tank
2005-09-06T10:44:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	what proc you got?
2005-09-06T10:45:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	dont compile, just apt you the 686 kernel

2005-10-10T16:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	shut off all your apt processes
2005-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Pickle_Weasel	poll all your windows and programs and shut off all apt, synaptic, aptitude etc
