2011-08-18T01:46:00.000Z	delac		is there any fix for the bug where usb-creator starts to require root privileges to write usb sticks?
2011-08-18T01:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	you have to enter a password to run the install to the stick.
2011-08-18T01:50:00.000Z	delac	urlin2u	Jordan_U: well, it didn't use to require it. what has changed?
2011-08-18T03:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	yes, always has.
2011-08-18T03:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	live cd of 9.10?
2011-08-18T03:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	well it does now why are you obsessed with this?
2011-08-18T03:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	unetbootin needs u=it just to open.
2011-08-18T03:45:00.000Z	delac	urlin2u	it just seems like some sort of bug, and i dont like using buggy software. expecially when it writes over stuff
2011-08-18T03:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	seems and reality are not the same, if you want no bugs you will have to stop using a computer.
2011-08-18T03:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	it happens we are all learning here. ;-)
2011-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	okay so.
2011-08-18T03:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	sudo is root authorization basically.
2011-08-18T03:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	or super user status.
2011-08-18T04:00:00.000Z	delac	urlin2u	bascialy, but what I ment is that the root privileges are not "on" on default.
2011-08-18T04:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	how long have you been using open source?
2011-08-18T04:01:00.000Z	delac	urlin2u	why is no one else worried about program suddenly starting to ask root password without any apparent reason? :(
2011-08-18T04:01:00.000Z	delac	urlin2u	a while (few years)
2011-08-18T04:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	you are on another planet is why basically ;-)
2011-08-18T04:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	delac	you needed sudo in 9.10 just like I do in natty.
