2009-11-24T03:45:00.000Z	Shwack		Can someobdy help me with compiling from source?
2009-11-24T03:46:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Be more specific.  What do you want to compile?  And why?
2009-11-24T03:46:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	I need to compile Waste Again 1.7.4 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wasteagain/files/  Because they only provide a windows.exe version and while it works with Wine it is unstable and i would like to run it natively
2009-11-24T03:48:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Unpack the source tarball and look for a script named `configure`.
2009-11-24T03:49:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	there are config.cpp and configparameters.cpp
2009-11-24T03:50:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	If the code is intended for win32, then you'll have to teach yourself how to build it.  It will be too involved to get help here.
2009-11-24T03:51:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Anything that doesn't have a 'Makefile' or a `configure` script is usually too hard for regular people to compile.
2009-11-24T03:53:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	there is a folder called makefiles
2009-11-24T03:54:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Let me download the tarball and look at it...
2009-11-24T03:56:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	I appreciate it.   compiling intimidates me still and it would be nice to know it's either not possible for this specific program or get it done and feel accomplished
2009-11-24T03:57:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	First, install the build-essential package.
2009-11-24T03:57:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Second, run `make -f Makefiles/gnu/Makefile` and see what happens.
2009-11-24T04:00:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	It won't compile on my 64-bit Ubuntu workstation.  If you have a 32-bit Ubuntu computer, then you may get lucky with it.
2009-11-24T04:01:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	give me one second - I will try
2009-11-24T04:04:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	I got make: *** [d_chat.o] Error 1
2009-11-24T04:04:00.000Z	Shwack		 amongst others.  It looks like this is maybe be a Wine only operation?
2009-11-24T04:05:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Code problem.  You need to ask the upstream project for help.  A quick look on my computer indicates that it isn't 64-bit clean for Ubuntu Linux.
2009-11-24T04:06:00.000Z	Shwack	dajhorn	Thank you. It is nice to know that there is nothing more I can do other than Wine
2009-11-24T04:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	Shwack	Welcome.
