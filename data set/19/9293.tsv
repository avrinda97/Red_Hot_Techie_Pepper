2007-05-17T16:16:00.000Z	Gothfunc		hi.  i am trying to compile my network card drivers, but i get the error "linux kernel source not found.  stop."  this is a fresh feisty server installation and i have apt-getted linux-source.  any ideas why i still get this error?
2007-05-17T16:17:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	yes, you need to tar -jxf it
2007-05-17T16:17:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	it's in /usr/src as a tar.bz2 file
2007-05-17T16:17:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	like a zip file, only better
2007-05-17T16:18:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	thought so, i did this but still got the error last time, but i'll try on the fresh install.  brb
2007-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	yup, unzipped the archived src, and it still gives the same error
2007-05-17T16:22:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	you need to have the kernel source in /usr/src/linux
2007-05-17T16:22:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	so make a softlink if you know how
2007-05-17T16:22:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	you mean /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.20?
2007-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	no I mean ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.20 /usr/src/linux
2007-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	ok, different error..  progress!  thanks :)
2007-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	I'd like to help you - what's the problem
2007-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	linux kernel source not configured - missing version.h.  stop.
2007-05-17T16:25:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	hmm what are you trying to compile?
2007-05-17T16:26:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	found this on google: Okay my suggestion would be to copy your kernel config file from /boot to
2007-05-17T16:27:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	i'm trying to compile drivers for my network card.  the card is brand new, and i assume newish technology because it's not detected outright.  sc92031
2007-05-17T16:28:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	ok, it's asking you to configure the kernel, you're gonna have to go read up because I haven't done that for aaaages, sorry.
2007-05-17T16:28:00.000Z	Gothfunc	voltagex	no prob, what a hassle.  i hate that the supplier didn't make a chipset that is universally recognisable
2007-05-17T16:29:00.000Z	voltagex	Gothfunc	send a message to the supplier - avoid buying from them if you can
