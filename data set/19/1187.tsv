2011-04-16T07:27:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	did you install the drivers?
2011-04-16T07:29:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	here is community documentation on it https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro8-3/Maverick
2011-04-16T07:30:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	it says right on the wiki that it seems to be stuck in the corner
2011-04-16T07:30:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: and it says exactly nothing :p I'Ve checked
2011-04-16T07:32:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	maybe this will help? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1457256
2011-04-16T07:32:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	its a bit old but it just might work
2011-04-16T07:36:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	Ok
2011-04-16T07:45:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: no effect. still same stupid watermark
2011-04-16T07:46:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	gay....Wonder if the beta version has this issue
2011-04-16T07:47:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: I'm about to try it
2011-04-16T07:49:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: it would be so bad if it went away after, say, a couple of seconds
2011-04-16T07:51:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	that would make sense if it did! haha. If there was a way to just kill the watermark off that would be nice but since I don't have a system to test it on I can't be of much help
2011-04-16T07:52:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: plus the "acceleration" is like VESA ...
2011-04-16T07:56:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	are you installing 11.04 yet?
2011-04-16T07:56:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: 11.04 seems to be supporting the wifi and the video correctly
2011-04-16T07:57:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	awesome
2011-04-16T07:59:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	the "Classic" gnome is able to be switched to easily
2011-04-16T08:01:00.000Z	Caboose885	DrMax	Sounds good to me. No sense in rushing perfection :)
2011-04-16T08:02:00.000Z	DrMax	Caboose885	: especially that RCs and Betas aren't perfection :p
