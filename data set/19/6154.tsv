2008-03-05T06:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	at the black screen can you hit ctrl-alt F2 and get a prompt
2008-03-05T06:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	at start or install hit F6   remove splash and quiet from the boot line, see if that lets you see where it is hanging up
2008-03-05T06:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	at start or install hit F6  and add before the --  noapic acpi=off        common command line modifiers.. there are many different ones you can try or just get the alternate insatll text cd..
2008-03-05T06:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	do you get to a screen that says start or install?
2008-03-05T06:37:00.000Z	apollo0117	Jack_Sparrow	if it helps i hear the disk spin still black sceen
2008-03-05T06:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	Cant do anything unless you get a screen that says start or install...  if not you have a bad dl or a bad burn.
2008-03-05T06:38:00.000Z	apollo0117	Jack_Sparrow	i get that screen but i tryed your f6 thing and it did not work
2008-03-05T06:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	what happened when you hit f6, does not work is not helpful
2008-03-05T06:41:00.000Z	apollo0117	Jack_Sparrow	i salw a line that red some thing like this file=/cdrom/preseed/ubunto.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.gx quiet splash --
2008-03-05T06:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	apollo0117	Did you try the first suggestion or the second
