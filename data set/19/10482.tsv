2006-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	Mesa comes standard.
2006-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	revilot	Desh	Im aware of that
2006-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	revilot	Desh	why would I want mesa when i can run fglrx
2006-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	On my laptop mesa never leaves, even with fglrx it says mesa is my openfl renderer
2006-07-13T09:38:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	I dunno, I wish I could kill mesa and force fglrx to work, but you need mesa as a backup.
2006-07-13T09:39:00.000Z	revilot	Desh	are you saying with fglrxinfo it still lists mesa?
2006-07-13T09:39:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	yup, and thus, glxgears runs slow as hella.
2006-07-13T09:40:00.000Z	revilot	Desh	what card do you have
2006-07-13T09:40:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	Mobility Radeon 9700
2006-07-13T09:41:00.000Z	revilot	Desh	i got fglrx to work on my ati200m using this method: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/hardware.html
2006-07-13T09:42:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	thanks, I'll book mark and try it, I'm so desperae man, tried for months, and I want to be able to play games!! :(!!! Hehehe.
2006-07-13T09:54:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	Leave them
2006-07-13T09:54:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	the other one is the open source driver, you can falback to it if fglrx gets hucked up.
2006-07-13T09:55:00.000Z	revilot	Desh	seems weird to have 2 drivers installed
2006-07-13T09:55:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	as long as both arn't being used.
2006-07-13T09:55:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	terminal: fglrxinfo
2006-07-13T09:55:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	if it says ATI blah blah, then you are fine.
2006-07-13T09:56:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	you probably have maybe 5-15 video drivers installed actually.
2006-07-13T09:56:00.000Z	Desh	revilot	Ubuntu will use the one it's specified to use for a specific screen.
