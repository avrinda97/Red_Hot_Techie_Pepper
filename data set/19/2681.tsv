2010-02-02T18:19:00.000Z	darkstar1		Hello again... I need help with two primary problems in with 9.10
2010-02-02T18:20:00.000Z	darkstar1		My first is my keyboard map I can't seem to locate my hash buttonn and I've typed everything ( I think)
2010-02-02T18:21:00.000Z	darkstar1		I've got it set to a mac UK keyboard, which is what I have
2010-02-02T18:21:00.000Z	darkstar1		I'm having to copy and paste the # symbol to access this channel
2010-02-02T18:22:00.000Z	darkstar1		Can anyone help me?
2010-02-02T18:23:00.000Z	darkstar1		nope
2010-02-02T18:23:00.000Z	darkstar1		Oh wait
2010-02-02T18:24:00.000Z	darkstar1		I was assuming the right and left alt both perform the same function
2010-02-02T18:25:00.000Z	darkstar1		Ok, second problem; Does anyone have a dual screen setup and have problems with the monitor setup?
2010-02-02T18:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darkstar1	 my nvidia dual screen setup works grreat
2010-02-02T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darkstar1	 im using 2 LCD's both are DVI. i just use the nvidia settings tool with no hassles.. so cant really suggest much else to try
2010-02-02T18:29:00.000Z	darkstar1	Dr_Willis	did you have to edit the nVidia config file?
2010-02-02T18:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darkstar1	 all i did was use the nvidia-settings tool a few clicks and i got twinview going on 2 monitors..
2010-02-02T18:35:00.000Z	darkstar1	Dr_Willis	I have twin view going just not perfect at the moment. I'm either getting the display spanned across the two screens (so my BG picture is stretched across both screens) in 75Hz mode or I'm getting access to only 2/3rds of the screen at 60Hz mode. Attempts to access the nVidia config tool says I need to run it Xconfig server as root which I don't know how to so far
2010-02-02T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darkstar1	 the background wallpaper image is  a gnome issue. KDE for example does  the wallpaper correctly. You can even have a different wqllpaper on each monitor.
2010-02-02T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darkstar1	 gksudo nvidia-settings   is the command to use
2010-02-02T18:39:00.000Z	darkstar1	Dr_Willis	 it's not just the wallpaper. Attempting to drag an application onto the other screen results in a limit, only 2/3rds of screen 2 can be accessed
2010-02-02T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	darkstar1	 sounds quirky. Ive never had such issues. Try the nvidia settings tool i guess and rearange the monitors.
2010-02-02T18:42:00.000Z	darkstar1	Dr_Willis	I'm trying all I get is window with tick boxes, doesn't give me any other options tells me to run the nvidia-xconfig as root to change some options. gksudo-ing that file results in warnings only
