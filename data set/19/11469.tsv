2006-01-18T16:22:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Hmm.
2006-01-18T16:24:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Konversation is an interesting little IRC client.
2006-01-18T16:24:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Not really... powerful, though, it seems. No actual way to script in it, or anything. heh
2006-01-18T16:25:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	irssi :)
2006-01-18T16:26:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	bobslaede	I like a more functional client, myself. :p If there were a KDE front-end for irssi, I might consider it.
2006-01-18T16:26:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	i have it set up on a server, i just ssh it
2006-01-18T16:27:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	bobslaede	Heh, on a server, eh? You IRC from a server? Now that's just silly. :)
2006-01-18T16:27:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	no no, its advanced
2006-01-18T16:27:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	i never have to log off
2006-01-18T16:28:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	bobslaede	Not that that's really always a good thing. :)
2006-01-18T16:28:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	sure it is ;)
2006-01-18T16:29:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	it rocks
2006-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	bobslaede	I used to always be on IRC. Wether here, or not. I got over it. :)
2006-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	me too, but now im back
2006-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Heh, cool. Konversation supports colored nicks. :D
2006-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	its easy, i can log on from home, or the office
2006-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	bobslaede	Heh, what do you do, use screen?
2006-01-18T16:32:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	yeah
2006-01-18T16:32:00.000Z	bobslaede	Psi-Jack	and a dummy user, no trouble
