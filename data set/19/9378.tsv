2006-11-16T16:45:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	You need to set the permissions at mount time, you can't chown/chmod on a Windows fielsystem, as those don't support unix style file mermissions.
2006-11-16T16:46:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	The easiest way is to add 'uid=XXX,umask=002' in the mount ioptions field in your fstab file. XXX should be your numeric user id.
2006-11-16T16:47:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	How did you mount it?
2006-11-16T16:50:00.000Z	TrolLlock	cafuego	the linuxhelp guy said i should mount it with sudo mount /mnt/windrive
2006-11-16T16:51:00.000Z	TrolLlock	cafuego	and that was what i did
2006-11-16T16:51:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	That emans you should have a line in the /etc/fstab file that mentions it.
2006-11-16T16:52:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	ok. Now on that line there is an entry in the <options> column
2006-11-16T16:57:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	Yup. Now unmount it and remount it.
2006-11-16T16:58:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	enjoy :-)
2006-11-16T16:59:00.000Z	cafuego	TrolLlock	install codecs!
