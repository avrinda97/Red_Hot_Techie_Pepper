2011-02-02T21:34:00.000Z	bibic682		Hello, anyone know why my cpu uses 100% resources to play back flash video online and only uses 38% to play a 720p xvid off of a dvd??
2011-02-02T21:35:00.000Z	bibic682		it is a amd athlon 64 754 socket 3200+
2011-02-02T21:36:00.000Z	bibic682		any known flash players for firefox that will be smoother and use less resources?
2011-02-02T21:37:00.000Z	bibic682		don't want to upgrade computer just for FLASH :(
2011-02-02T21:37:00.000Z	xangua	bibic682	none that plays all content
2011-02-02T21:37:00.000Z	bibic682		I hardly ever go to youtube
2011-02-02T21:38:00.000Z	bibic682		I watch streaming tv stations that use flash. I got it going pretty smooth at 100% resources
2011-02-02T21:39:00.000Z	xangua	bibic682	HaC|away if you use firefox you can try flahsvideoreplacer addon to play it with your native player

2011-02-02T22:21:00.000Z	bibic682		anyone know the easy way to install swfdec-0.8.4 tar.gz from desktop?
2011-02-02T22:22:00.000Z	xangua	bibic682	how about install it from software centre, you can't have more than 1 plugin for flash installed at once
2011-02-02T22:23:00.000Z	bibic682		I will try that   thanks
2011-02-02T22:25:00.000Z	bibic682	xangua	 Doesn't seem to be in software sources
2011-02-02T22:26:00.000Z	bibic682	xangua	I take that back....its in package manager...thanks
