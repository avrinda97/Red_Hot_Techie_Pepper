2008-11-06T07:03:00.000Z	mynous		but mv foo/ gets all sub-directories as well right?
2008-11-06T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	right
2008-10-29T07:31:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	getent group    ?
2008-10-29T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	no
2008-10-29T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	with the command I told you
2008-10-29T07:33:00.000Z	mynous	jrib	that lists the group:gid:members right?
2008-10-29T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	almost, sure
2008-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	almost.  * won't glob hidden files (anything starting with a .)
2008-11-06T07:02:00.000Z	mynous	jrib	how do you get the hidden files also?
2008-11-06T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	depends on your shell.  One way would be foo/{*,.*} which gets expanded to foo/* foo/.*
2008-11-06T07:03:00.000Z	mynous	jrib	ahh, its a bash shell
2008-11-06T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	sure that works on every (that I know) shell
2008-11-06T07:04:00.000Z	mynous	jrib	thanks, i accidentally did mv foo/* now i have to wait for it to finish :\
2008-11-06T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	right
2008-11-06T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	well you just check if you had any hidden stuff before and finish copying it
2008-11-06T07:05:00.000Z	mynous	jrib	with foo/* hidden files in sub-directories will still be moved correct? just not the ones in foo?
2008-11-06T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	man usermod (poke me if you can't find what you want there)
2008-11-06T07:56:00.000Z	mynous	jrib	you rock btw
2008-11-06T07:58:00.000Z	jrib	mynous	thanks :)
