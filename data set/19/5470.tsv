2008-07-01T04:17:00.000Z	Blaqlight		Im having an unusual problem : Ive mounted volumes in my dvd drive 100 times and never a problem, now I mount a new volume into it and its set with permissions 400 and I can't read it. how do I change the permissions so that I can read the disc?
2008-07-01T04:18:00.000Z	Blaqlight		thing is I didn't change the permissions in the first place.
2008-07-01T04:19:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	what is the output of the ls -la of the mount point?
2008-07-01T04:21:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	ls: cannot open directory /media/cdrom0: Permission denied
2008-07-01T04:21:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	when I sudo though it reads it fine. says 400
2008-07-01T04:21:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	the mount point is the directory name
2008-07-01T04:22:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	the mount point is /media/cdrom0
2008-07-01T04:22:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	use ls -lad
2008-07-01T04:23:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	drwx------ 2 400 401 2048 2006-03-30 13:44 /media/cdrom0
2008-07-01T04:23:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	Your ownership is wrong - change with the chown command
2008-07-01T04:24:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	to?
2008-07-01T04:31:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	I can't seem to change the permissions.
2008-07-01T04:38:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	Using SUDO - change the ownership to your user, your group
2008-07-01T05:46:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	Did you change the ownership, like I suggested a while ago?
2008-07-01T05:47:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	I did, but when I put a volume in the drive it just changes back.
2008-07-01T05:48:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	How are you mounting it?
2008-07-01T05:49:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	does not tell me how you did it - what command?
2008-07-01T05:51:00.000Z	Blaqlight	m-c	sudo chown --from root:root john:john /media/cdrom0 < is what I typed
2008-07-01T05:52:00.000Z	m-c	Blaqlight	Sounds like something in fuse needs to be reconfigured correctly.  Sorry, I am stuck when it comes to fuse.  Maybe someone else can help you
