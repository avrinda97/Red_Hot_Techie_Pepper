2005-07-07T14:38:00.000Z	jtan325		if i unmounted the partition that i'm currently running linux from, that would be bad huh? how would i go about expanding the current partition that linux is running on (ext3)?
2005-07-07T14:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	you'll need to boot with a live cd, or some other media
2005-07-07T14:40:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	why a live CD?
2005-07-07T14:41:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	would the ubuntu installer's paritioning program work?
2005-07-07T14:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	so that the partition in question isn't mounted
2005-07-07T14:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	i'm not sure what the install cd provides
2005-07-07T14:42:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	I also dual-boot with windows, do you think i could use partition magic?
2005-07-07T14:42:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	it says that partition magic supports ext2, but that's not ext3
2005-07-07T14:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	again, i don't know, sorry
2005-07-07T14:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	i defer to IIIEars on this -- I have never resized a partition
2005-07-08T05:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	isn't that maybe a codec thing? what are you trying to play?
2005-07-08T05:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	maybe run it from the command line, it might tell you what codec the avi file is
2005-07-08T05:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	i think mplayer says what kind of video stream the file has, and whether or not it can decode it
2005-07-08T05:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	afaik, avi is just a 'container' -- could be any of a multitude of encodings
2005-07-08T06:38:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	might you have any ideas on how to debug my situation?
2005-07-08T06:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	well, if mplayer works, why not just use that ?
2005-07-08T06:40:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	because mplayer doesn't allow resizing
2005-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	jtan325	HappyFool	comadreja: were you guys able to get the dvd working in xine?
2005-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	jtan325	i think comadreja compiled mplayer in the end
