2005-10-30T15:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	tx - I have another question.  I have a friend who's chkrootkit reported a problem with '/usr/bin/find'.  We compared md5sums and mine doesn't match his, yet we are both running Breezy.  Any idea how this can be?
2005-10-30T15:41:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	someone reported that the other day too (can't recall the nick)
2005-10-30T15:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	Do you think it is anything to be concerned about?
2005-10-30T15:42:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	i can't say no, but don't know for sure sorry
2005-10-30T15:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	tx for the feedback
2005-10-30T15:42:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	yw
2005-12-04T11:28:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	what was was wrong with !ops? (i think you meant forget homer)
2005-12-04T11:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	sorry if I deleted that by mistake
2005-12-04T11:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	I wanted to invoke ops as they do in #debian, but it didn't work
2005-12-04T11:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	instead it seemed to reset the factoid
2005-12-04T11:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	can you reset to the original?
2005-12-04T11:30:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	yep - from the logs :)
2005-12-04T11:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	yay :-)
2005-12-04T11:36:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	done (in /msg) :)
2005-12-04T11:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	thanks dude :-)
2006-10-19T09:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	bad advice to 'upgrade' to unstable
2006-10-19T09:46:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	yes, bad wording
2006-10-19T09:46:00.000Z	bimberi	Xenguy	but qualified in the answer
2006-10-19T09:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	bimberi	I just blew it a kiss :-)
