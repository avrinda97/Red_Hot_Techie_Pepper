2011-09-07T00:08:00.000Z	Antonjo		prism driver
2011-09-07T00:09:00.000Z	Antonjo		yes
2011-09-07T00:09:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	the p54 firmware is in linux-firmware-nonfree, the drivers are included by default
2011-09-07T00:13:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	we don't support custom kernels here, although there is no reason it shouldn't work assuming you have the firmware from linux-firmware-nonfree and properly enabled the drivers
2011-09-07T00:14:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	for the stock natty kernel, you need to make sure to update to 2.6.38-11 since there is a bug in versions less than 2.6.38-10 which will cause p54 to fail to connect
2011-09-07T00:27:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	correct, you shouldn't need ndiswrapper, but you will need linux-firmware-nonfree, because the p54 firmware was moved there and it is not installed by default
2011-09-07T00:29:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	prism54 chipsets used to require ndiswrapper
2011-09-07T00:31:00.000Z	Antonjo	trism	i used ndiswrapper, but it freezes everything, then i discovered that with puppy nothing hangs and this line (mac80211       99898  2 p54usb,p54common. ) suggests it is because of no ndis
2011-09-07T00:33:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	yes, you should use the p54 modules included with the kernel instead of ndiswrapper with recent kernels, download and install linux-firmware-nonfree and linux-image-2.6.38-11-generic from packages.ubuntu.com and it should work fine
2011-09-07T00:39:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	when you plug in your card the modules should be loaded automatically
2011-09-07T00:39:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	but yeah, you should reboot if ndiswrapper is already running
2011-09-07T00:40:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	shouldn't matter, you may want to hold off plugging in until after you reboot so you can watch /var/log/kern.log and see the detection messages
2011-09-07T00:52:00.000Z	Antonjo	trism	With live puppy, issuing lsmod |grep p54,  I saw this:
2011-09-07T00:53:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	can you pastebin the dmesg output when you plug in your card?
2011-09-07T00:59:00.000Z	Antonjo	trism	dmesg you required:    http://pastebin.com/A9h5Ggch
2011-09-07T01:01:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	odd, try: sudo modprobe p54usb; and then plugging it in again
2011-09-07T01:10:00.000Z	Antonjo	trism	it is working!!!!!
2011-09-07T01:10:00.000Z	Antonjo	trism	 usr13  Thanks (and some thanks to Puppy distro too)
2011-09-07T01:11:00.000Z	trism	Antonjo	excellent! you're welcome
