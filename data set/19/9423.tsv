2006-11-23T11:04:00.000Z	aios	dpt	that didn't work too well....
2006-11-23T11:05:00.000Z	dpt	aios	what happened
2006-11-23T11:05:00.000Z	aios	dpt	it did suspend/hibernate, but wouldn't wake up
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	dpt	aios	Did you upgrade the kernel, perhaps?
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	dpt	aios	If the low-level suspend isn't working, that's what I expect the problem to be
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	aios	dpt	hmm. thats possible. i probably wouldnt have upgraded on purpuse, but i do have two choices of kernel in grub
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	dpt	aios	Just to check: Suspend to ram was working before?
2006-11-23T11:09:00.000Z	aios	dpt	well, everything 'power management' allows for seemed to work fine
2006-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	dpt	aios	When you do the usual power management command, do you get the same symptoms as with what I suggested?
2006-11-23T11:13:00.000Z	dpt	aios	Another suggestion: try 'sudo pmi action suspend'
2006-11-23T11:13:00.000Z	aios	dpt	no. its hard to describe though. in essence nothing happens (the fan/cpu stay on), but i get a black screen and a prompt to relogin
2006-11-23T11:13:00.000Z	aios	dpt	i'll try that. (brb)
2006-11-23T11:33:00.000Z	aios	dpt	sorry, got a phone call. http://pastie.caboo.se/24147
2006-11-23T11:34:00.000Z	dpt	aios	Do you have acpi support in your kernel at all?  Can you do ls /proc/acpi?
2006-11-23T11:35:00.000Z	aios	dpt	what, that does exist
2006-11-23T11:36:00.000Z	aios	dpt	the kernel is 2.6.17-10-386
2006-11-23T11:38:00.000Z	dpt	aios	Weird.  On the log you posted, the key line is /etc/acpi/sleep.sh: line 39: echo: write error: Resource temporarily unavailable.  This line is the one I had you do manually before
2006-11-23T11:39:00.000Z	dpt	aios	I think I'm running out of ideas.
2006-11-23T11:39:00.000Z	aios	dpt	well, thank you very much for trying. you gave me a few keywords to play with, so i'll see what i can learn
