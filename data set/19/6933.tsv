2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		lol
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		im actually a girl.
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		i dont use linux though
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		at all.
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		im a windows girl.
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		i code in C#
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		but ive used ubuntu as i've said
2007-11-07T14:27:00.000Z	mmg0		for a very short time
2007-11-07T14:28:00.000Z	mmg0		i guess the "deltree /y c:" jokes dont work in these linux channels.
2007-11-07T14:28:00.000Z	mmg0		and i guess telling people to "alt-f4" out of their irc client is bound to completely do some crazy stuff on linux like open a portal into tty9 or something.
2007-11-07T14:28:00.000Z	Evanlec	mmg0	nope ;p, but other commands do
2007-11-07T14:29:00.000Z	Evanlec	mmg0	actually alt+f4 works the same way in linux as it does in windows, closes current window
2007-11-07T14:29:00.000Z	mmg0	Evanlec	 those copy cats.
2007-11-07T14:29:00.000Z	Evanlec	mmg0	yea, but atleast in linux u can change just about any keyboard shortcut/behavior
2007-11-07T14:30:00.000Z	mmg0	Evanlec	 you can in windows too, you just need to know where to go to change them :P
2007-11-07T14:31:00.000Z	Evanlec	mmg0	yea i agree there are way too many distros out there
2007-11-07T14:33:00.000Z	Evanlec	mmg0	well thats not necessarily true, there are many commanilties with linux, in fact distros are just different software pacakages really
2007-11-07T14:34:00.000Z	mmg0	Evanlec	 well there are major differences,  for example ubuntu and kubuntu are very identical, yet they both crash during completely different points during installation.
2007-11-07T14:34:00.000Z	Evanlec	mmg0	lol, if you're here to flame linux/ubuntu, you wont get very far
