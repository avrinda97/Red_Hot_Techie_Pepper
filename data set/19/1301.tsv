2011-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	Polah		How could I set up a script to bzip2 the contents of a directory individually. I have a directory of .bsp files and I'd like to compress them all to .bsp.bz2 individually.
2011-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	cd to the directory and do 'for file in *.bsp; do bzip2 $file; done;'
2011-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	Can I just enter that as a single command?
2011-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	do you understand what it's doing?
2011-08-07T23:04:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	For each file that ends in .bsp, runs the bzip2 command for it
2011-08-07T23:04:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	yep - so yes - you can cd into the directory where the files are and give it a go
2011-08-07T23:05:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	Thanks, I'll give it try once I've finished grabbing them
2011-08-07T23:05:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	sure ;-)
2011-08-07T23:21:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	would that command you gave me compress each file linearly or all at once?
2011-08-07T23:34:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	sorry - stepped away for a bit - the command steps through each file individually
2011-08-07T23:34:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	yeah found out thanks (:
2011-08-08T00:31:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	Are you still here?
2011-08-08T00:32:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	yep - well, I'm back anyway
2011-08-08T00:32:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	For the command you gave me earlier, could I make it recurse into subdirectories?
2011-08-08T00:37:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	you might want to investigate the 'find' command for that kind of thing - with that command, for each file that matches the parameters you give it, excecute a command
2011-08-08T00:38:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	Ah, thanks for the tip
2011-08-08T00:38:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	do a web search for "find exec"
2011-08-27T02:29:00.000Z	yeats	Polah	Medibuntu is a repo, not a distro ;-)
2011-08-27T02:30:00.000Z	Polah	yeats	My bad :/ GreekFreak: You'd have to add the repo and install the packages then
