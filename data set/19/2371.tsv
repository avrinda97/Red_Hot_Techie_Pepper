2010-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wise_crypt	i don't think the ATI proprietary driver supports a old 9600 video card. i think it has to be an x1200 or newer
2010-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	wise_crypt	onetinsoldier	any suggestion here
2010-05-30T21:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wise_crypt	nope. not really. i think people with cards older than radeon x1200 have to use the opensource driver
