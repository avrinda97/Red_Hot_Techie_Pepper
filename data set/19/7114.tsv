2007-10-24T09:57:00.000Z	LiMaO		how do i add a folder to my $PATH?
2007-10-24T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	add a line like    PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}" to .bash_profile , then type source .bash_profile
2007-10-24T09:59:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	gonna try that, thank you
2007-10-26T09:02:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	it's always worked
2007-10-26T09:03:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	it didn't work for me. wanna try it?! set your theme to "Crux", then open up OpenOffice Writer and try to 'Format > Page' --> it'll hang
2007-10-26T09:04:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	this channel is not indicative of percentages
2007-10-26T09:05:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	i don't care about statistics either.. i help people here and at the ubuntu forums.. but what i care most is about a system that works for me =P
2007-10-26T09:09:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	oowriter won't even open with crux set (I'd forgotten just how ugly crux was)
2007-10-26T09:12:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	i used to like crux window borders.. but i prefer them to be blue, or green =P
2007-10-26T09:12:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	but don't you think it's kind of strange? an application not working with a theme that comes by default with ubuntu??
2007-10-26T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	I use nodoka with spifcity as my borders
2007-10-26T09:13:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	nodoka.. it's the default for opensuse or fedora, isn't it?
2007-10-26T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	no, it's a defective theme. Probably hasn't been maintained and gtk is now exposing a bug
2007-10-26T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	fedora I beleive
2007-10-26T09:13:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	i just wish i could find some nice looking themes for ubuntu. gnome-look only has ugly stuff
2007-10-26T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	+1
2007-11-17T04:35:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	ooh, you still use that non free thing?
2007-11-17T04:35:00.000Z	LiMaO	nickrud	never knew it isn't free hehe
2007-11-17T04:36:00.000Z	nickrud	LiMaO	yeah, it was designed that way, even named for it
