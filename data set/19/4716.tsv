2008-11-18T08:56:00.000Z	kemalist		good morning
2008-11-18T08:57:00.000Z	kemalist		i did greenhog
2008-11-18T08:57:00.000Z	kemalist		using vmware
2008-11-18T08:59:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	how did u setup ethernet conf.. i want my virtual machine to be jus like any other physical machine on the network? when i try to used eth0, it says eth0 device cannot be found
2008-11-18T09:00:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	i used bridged mode
2008-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	me too... bridged mode. so in the interfaces configuration file it should still be eth0? or is it something else?
2008-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	check it
2008-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	i have checked.. when i do /etc/init.d/networking restart ... it says no such device as eth0
2008-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	it must have another name then
2008-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	well.. then how do i find the name of the network card? is it in the dmesg?
2008-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	it must be in "ipconfig" list
2008-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	u mean ifconfig?
2008-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	ifconfig shows only lo device... nothing else..
2008-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	that's weird
2008-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	but in the vmware server console it shows that network is connected... maybe my network card doesnt support bridged mode?
2008-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	impossible
2008-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	ok.. im out of ideas..
2008-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	kemalist	greenhog	i've never heard of such an issue, i'm sorry
2008-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	greenhog	kemalist	alrite..
