2006-12-20T08:09:00.000Z	lupine_85		especially when (note: when, not if) sudo breaks
2006-12-20T08:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		seriously. Change the date/time. change the hostname. Accidentally bork your permissions
2006-12-20T08:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		oh noes! sudo broke! I have to reboot to fix it!
2006-12-20T08:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		or load up your HD install in 'recovery mode'
2006-12-20T08:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		but are any of them here..? L
2006-12-20T08:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		another thing sudo can't do - really stupid, this - is cd
2006-12-20T08:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		you can't sudo cd $some_dir
2006-12-20T08:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		lol
2006-12-20T08:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		so what's the difference between sudo -i and su root ?
2006-12-20T08:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		aside that the former is more likely to use a less-secure password :p
2006-12-20T08:14:00.000Z	bimberi	lupine_85	why is a user password less secure than a root password?
2006-12-20T08:14:00.000Z	lupine_85	xenakis	xsane
2006-12-20T08:14:00.000Z	lupine_85		because it's going to be used in more places, that's why :p
2006-12-20T08:14:00.000Z	lupine_85		my root password is a stupidly large size
2006-12-20T08:15:00.000Z	lupine_85		my user password isn't
2006-12-20T08:15:00.000Z	lupine_85		!kernel
2006-12-20T08:16:00.000Z	lupine_85		what bits are removed?
2006-12-20T08:16:00.000Z	lupine_85		apart from the i386-specific bits :p
2006-12-20T08:16:00.000Z	bimberi	lupine_85	that just means _your_ user password is less secure than your root password
