2006-12-29T09:50:00.000Z	genius314		Can someone help me configure my resolution??
2006-12-29T09:50:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	I missed your question... could you repeat it please?
2006-12-29T09:51:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	I want a 1280x1024 resolution, (which my monitor and card support - I've done it in Windows), and I configured my Xorg.conf to be able to have that resolution, but all I can go up to is 1280x800.
2006-12-29T09:52:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg.  go through that command, choose 'advanced' at the end, and pick the 1280x1024 res.
2006-12-29T09:53:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	Ok, I'll try that.
2006-12-29T09:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	at the end, nothing will happen, it'll just exit.  restart gdm (ctrl-alt-backspace) and you should be good.
2006-12-29T09:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	if X fails to start, use that command again, and set it to something lower.  we'll get you fixed yet :)
2006-12-29T09:54:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	Ok
2006-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	What do I choose for the first option?
2006-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	"X server driver"
2006-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	it's been a while, what is it asking?
2006-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	what driver are you using?  binary blobs, or is this the first install you've done?
2006-12-29T09:56:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	first install.
2006-12-29T09:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	you're running the built in OSS driver then... you MIGHT wanna consider dropping in the binary blobs first, before you go through this.  hit ctrl-c to exit out.
2006-12-29T09:59:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	I don't have a Radeon card.
2006-12-29T10:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	what kind of card is it?
2006-12-29T10:01:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	3D Rage Pro (or 3D Rage I/II. I have two installed, each with a different monitor. I also need to get both monitors working.)
2006-12-29T10:02:00.000Z	SilentDis	genius314	i've not worked with the rage pro cards... not sure what the 'default' driver is on those.
2006-12-29T10:02:00.000Z	genius314	SilentDis	Ok.
