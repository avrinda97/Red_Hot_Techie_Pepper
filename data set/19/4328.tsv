2009-02-15T18:51:00.000Z	blizzle		Out of interest, I have a graphics card identified as NV5 [RIVA TNT2/TNT2 Pro].. can't seem to get proprietary drivers with 3d acceleration loaded at all.. any ideas?
2009-02-15T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	what type of card is it
2009-02-15T18:52:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	It's a Riva TNT2 I think (pci).
2009-02-15T18:52:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	isn't that a very very old card
2009-02-15T18:53:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	Yes, it's ancient! 16MB onboard ram.
2009-02-15T18:53:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	probably why no 3d - support was dropped for old cards
2009-02-15T18:54:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	Can't even get a proprietary driver installed.. even though the card is supposedly supported by the nvidia drivers. :/
2009-02-15T18:54:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	who said it's supported ?
2009-02-15T18:54:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	nvidia's site.
2009-02-15T18:54:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	old card support was dropped from a lot of the newer drivers
2009-02-15T18:54:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	really, can you show me the link
2009-02-15T18:55:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/README/appendix-a.html
2009-02-15T18:56:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	what version of the driver are you trying to use
2009-02-15T18:57:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	I've tried with the nvidia tools and whatever's in the repository.. can't seem to locate support for the card.
2009-02-15T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	it says your card is only supported in the 1.071 driver
2009-02-15T18:57:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	Yup, indeed. Is there a way to force that driver into Ubuntu?
2009-02-15T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	blizzle	download it manually if it's not in the repo
2009-02-15T19:01:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	Will see what I can locate, thanks for the insights.
2009-02-15T19:03:00.000Z	blizzle	ikonia	I'm hoping http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_x86_71.86.06.html might help.
