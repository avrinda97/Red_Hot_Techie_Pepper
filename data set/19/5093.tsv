2008-09-03T00:47:00.000Z	bugaloo	moccuo	install the libntfs9 package
2008-09-03T00:48:00.000Z	moccuo	bugaloo	so i should just boot off an ubuntu disk and do that?
2008-09-03T00:49:00.000Z	bugaloo	moccuo	the ntfs partition is on same disk than ubuntu?
2008-09-03T00:50:00.000Z	moccuo	bugaloo	no, i dont have ubuntu installed anywhere..
2008-09-03T00:50:00.000Z	bugaloo	moccuo	so I didnt get your problem, hehe
