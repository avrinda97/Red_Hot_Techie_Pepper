2005-09-09T16:55:00.000Z	dbzdeath		ahh gotta love gentoo users... so helpful
2005-09-09T05:10:00.000Z	dbzdeath		yeah i don't use sudo... i only find it a pain
2005-09-09T05:11:00.000Z	dbzdeath		i know what i'm doing not to fuck something up royally :P
2005-09-09T05:11:00.000Z	dbzdeath		sudo has some good uses
2005-09-09T05:11:00.000Z	dbzdeath		sudo = good for noobs
2005-09-09T05:11:00.000Z	dbzdeath		i much prefer su :)
2005-09-09T05:12:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	sudo is in every security book it was developed in or about 1980 and you know better :) I love it :)
2005-09-09T05:13:00.000Z	dbzdeath	ompaul	heh it has its disadvantages... like a user often won't put a complex password for their normal user account ... and if they are a sudoer ...
2005-09-09T05:15:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	they should have good passwords from one end of their access to the other
2005-09-09T05:15:00.000Z	dbzdeath	ompaul	ya they *SHOULD* but they don't
2005-09-09T05:18:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	now there is not that much work to do and sudo X works for 15 minutes after the first kick off unless you change the values
2005-09-09T05:20:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	that is really very close to trolling in here, you have told us that several times
2005-09-09T05:21:00.000Z	dbzdeath	ompaul	hmmm ... and you keep trying to fight me on my opinion...
2005-09-09T05:22:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	no I have told you in my opinion you are wrong, and that of most of the people who help in here, that is all, but I would suggest you are missing the point if you use a root account
2005-09-09T05:23:00.000Z	dbzdeath	ompaul	... you do realise i don't STAY logged in as root...
2005-09-09T05:25:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	not the point, I do not agree with using root except when installing that is it, not open to debate with me, I would need a thesis to convince me that I have the wrong opinion
2005-09-09T05:25:00.000Z	dbzdeath	ompaul	opinion can't be wrong... you should know that because opinion is NOT fact
2005-09-09T05:28:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	okay, take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
2005-09-29T10:29:00.000Z	ompaul	dbzdeath	usually the client knocks on 6667 and gets told the port to use usually 6667/8/9/70
