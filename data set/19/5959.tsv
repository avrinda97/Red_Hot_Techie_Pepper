2008-04-11T19:09:00.000Z	lewench		Having an issue with my newly installed ubuntu on my Inspiron E1705. I get an IP address from my network card. I can ping and accually connected to my PC at home through VNC. But when browsing the net it takes about a minute to load any page. I also cannot get updates on my add/remove packages. Anyone know what might be wrong??
2008-04-11T19:09:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	this is gutsy?
2008-04-11T19:09:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	Yes.
2008-04-11T19:09:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	you all the repos enabled?
2008-04-11T19:10:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	huh? I can't get updates it won't go through. take a minute to load a page. But everything else network wise is ok
2008-04-11T19:11:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	you are connected on that box now? could you pastebin your sources.list please?
2008-04-11T19:12:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	install pastebinit sudo apt-get install pastebinit then cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit
2008-04-11T19:19:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	how about cat /etc/apt/sources.list and see if there are a bunch of hashmarks in front of the various repos
2008-04-11T19:21:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	Yes there are # line commented out by installer because it failed to verify
2008-04-11T19:22:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	most of them? just the backports? how many roughly
2008-04-11T19:22:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	All of them accually
2008-04-11T19:23:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	then you need to uncomment (remove the hashmarks) from the key ones; /msg ubotu gutsysources for which ones to uncomment
2008-04-11T19:26:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	http://forgott3n.serveftp.net/http%20uploads/sources_list.txt
2008-04-11T19:29:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	you have no sources; that would be the reason that add/remove is greyed out; open up the sources list with an editor and remove the hashes and then sudo apt-get update and try again
2008-04-11T19:30:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	ok thanks.
2008-04-11T19:30:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	nano is a good one; unless you have another you like sudo nano etc etc
2008-04-11T19:32:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	is there a reason why this happend on install? Maybe I didn't have internet connection?
2008-04-11T19:34:00.000Z	bazhang	lewench	aye that would be the reason
2008-04-11T19:34:00.000Z	lewench	bazhang	Getting them thanks a bunch!!
