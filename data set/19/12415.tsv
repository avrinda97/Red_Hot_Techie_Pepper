2007-04-28T07:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	Did you try to force the re-install?
2007-04-28T07:19:00.000Z	jl	BlueEagle	yes i did but when i stop all mysql services and uninstall apparently it does, but when i try to install it again there is an postinstall error message
2007-04-28T07:20:00.000Z	jl		it seems like mysql never unistall complelty
2007-04-28T07:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	sudo aptitude reinstall mysql
2007-04-28T07:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	What is the post-install error you're recieving?
2007-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	Yeah, also purgeing is a good idea. Nice thought idefixx.
2007-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	jl		this is the postinstall error message: WARNING: /etc/mysql/my.cnf cannot be read. See README.Debian.
2007-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	mkdir /etc/mysql
2007-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	touch /etc/mysql/my.cnf
2007-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	Do those commands then re-try to purge the install and re-installing.
2007-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	jl		i created the directory but it reffers to the files that i removed in that directory
2007-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	Just touch it to create the entry.
2007-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	jl		i will try those right now
2007-04-28T07:24:00.000Z	jl		it seems that the purge argument doesn't exists
2007-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	jl		invalid operation: purge
2007-04-28T07:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jl	sudo aptitude purge mysql-server
