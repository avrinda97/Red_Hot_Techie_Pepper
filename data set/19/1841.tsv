2010-10-02T01:36:00.000Z	tigertv69		hey guys i have somewhat an easy qquestion.... Ok basically i have an ubuntu server and a windows machine... The ubuntu server uses a paid vpn provider so all the data being tunneled is secure... i want to setup chrome on my non server(my desktop gui) to tunnel through my server.. SO basically all the internet on my computer here is just through that computer
2010-10-02T01:37:00.000Z	tigertv69		is there a setting i can setup in chrome to do taht and what do i need to do on my ubutu server to get that to work??
2010-10-02T01:37:00.000Z	tigertv69		(just my chrome browser) all my other browsers will be my normal internet

2010-10-02T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	saying "anyone" won't get you far
2010-10-02T03:28:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	why are you root
2010-10-02T03:28:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	no it's not
2010-10-02T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	you should not be root, root does not have the display environment setup
2010-10-02T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	your display enviornment varible is not setup, which suggests you are not using ssh X11 forwarding
2010-10-02T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	your making it hard and you don't really know what your doing
2010-10-02T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	just use a command line client to ftp
2010-10-02T03:31:00.000Z	tigertv69	ikonia	i woudl love to do command line ftp..
2010-10-02T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	ok, do it
2010-10-02T03:32:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	why not just run filezilla on your windows client
2010-10-02T03:33:00.000Z	tigertv69	ikonia	long story..
2010-10-02T03:33:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	ok, then you need to setup ssh forwarding properly and get xming support (not here)
2010-10-02T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	tigertv69	no, X will die
