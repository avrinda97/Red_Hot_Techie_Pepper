2010-01-13T20:07:00.000Z	jacob_		hi i am trying to load a package and this is what i'm typing apt-get git://git.opencompositing.org/fusion/plugins/atlantis......am i doing something wrong?
2010-01-13T20:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jacob_	doesn't look like a valid apt-get command to me... you put in a url after the apt-get command, is that what you did? it's usually --> apt-get <package_name>
2010-01-13T20:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jacob_	what package are you wanting to install?
2010-01-13T20:10:00.000Z	jacob_	onetinsoldier	the atlantis package for compiz...and that was the link posted on the compiz fusion community
2010-01-13T20:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jacob_	ok, hang on a minute while i try and have a look
2010-01-13T20:11:00.000Z	jacob_	onetinsoldier	k...i would post a link to it..but its long and don't want to spam board

2010-01-13T20:19:00.000Z	jacob_	onetinsoldier	woops..typed that wrong
2010-01-13T20:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier		hehe
2010-01-13T20:20:00.000Z	jacob_		msg onetinsoldier http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/compiz-fusion-community-news-edition-9-for-july-23-2007-breaking-news-forums-posts-go-down-by-half-due-to-a-lack-of-posts-asking-for-aquariums/  thats better
2010-01-13T20:21:00.000Z	jacob_		Darth: lol sorry my keyboard is sticking
2010-01-13T20:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jacob_	have a look at 'git'. git is a versioning control system. i think this atlantis plugin is for people want to download and compile bleeding edge source code
2010-01-13T20:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier		people *who want to*
2010-01-13T20:22:00.000Z	jacob_	onetinsoldier	 ahhh that would make sense...guess i will go back to looking for a different link
2010-01-13T20:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jacob_	ok, good luck
