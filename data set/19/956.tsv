2011-09-13T03:28:00.000Z	djskidd		Hi
2011-09-13T03:29:00.000Z	djskidd		I need more help
2011-09-13T03:29:00.000Z	djskidd		I am installing Ubuntu 10.10 on my mom's computer
2011-09-13T03:29:00.000Z	djskidd		but she also wants to keep Windows XP
2011-09-13T03:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Why not 11.04?
2011-09-13T03:30:00.000Z	djskidd	Jordan_U	Cause I hate hate hate Unity
2011-09-13T03:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	No.
2011-09-13T03:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Important files should be backed up no matter what you're doing.
2011-09-13T03:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	You should install grub's boot sector to the mbr, not to a partition.
2012-05-30T02:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Just do a normal installation as you would to an internal drive.
2012-05-30T02:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Do not use Wubi.
2012-05-30T02:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Do you have a CD you can burn and boot from, or another USB drive that you can put Ubuntu's installer on then boot from?
2012-05-30T02:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Try following the instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-windows
2012-05-30T02:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Yes, all of the flavors of Ubuntu use the same core, and thus handle packages the same way.
2012-05-30T02:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	The only difference between Ubuntu and Kubuntu is the default packages which come installed.
2012-06-06T01:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Does your mom's computer only have Windows?
2012-06-06T02:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#ChRoot
2012-06-06T02:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	Follow the link I gave you, there are many other guides which are completely wrong.
2012-06-06T02:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	djskidd	No, it's wrong too unfortunately.
