2010-04-11T09:40:00.000Z	inglor_		how do I regain focus to ubuntu when using virtualbox
2010-04-11T09:41:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	The default for detaching focus is the right Control key, but that didn't work for me. You'll have to kill the Virtualbox process, then go into its preferences and change the key to something else if hitting right Control doesn't work.
2010-04-11T09:41:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	ty, didn't work for me, will try to set it to something different
2010-04-11T09:42:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Do you need help killing the process?
2010-04-11T09:42:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	had I needed help I wouldn't be talking to you over IRC would I
2010-04-11T09:43:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Okay, just checking.
2010-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	since you offered, is there a fast way to kill a process in CLI? (I mean faster than PS -A and then kill -9 based on its pid)
2010-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	You might try killall VirtualBox
2010-04-11T09:46:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Aye
2010-04-11T09:50:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	what runs on your desktop on startup but not on your laptop?
2010-04-11T09:51:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Looks like nothing.
2010-04-11T09:55:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	are the files identical?
2010-04-11T09:55:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	I'll check in a sec, I'm rebooting the laptop
2010-04-11T09:59:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	it's possible with apt, not sure about synaptic
2010-04-11T09:59:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Okay, that'd be alright
2010-04-11T10:01:00.000Z	inglor_	Andorin	the -d flag downloads the package only
2010-04-11T10:01:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Great, let me test
2010-04-11T10:02:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Would that be "sudo apt-get -d install packagename" instead"
2010-04-11T10:03:00.000Z	Andorin	inglor_	Then I get "E: Invalid operation pidgin"
