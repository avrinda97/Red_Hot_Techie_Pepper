2005-05-26T12:54:00.000Z	Funraiser	danko123456	it depends of your ISP, all of them give u access to "normal" NGs, but some ISPs don't give u access to the NGs where u can find binaries
2005-05-26T12:54:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 		i am not saying anything... i havent tried it yet
2005-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	Funraiser		[Phaedrus] , no, i like it free, is netscape free, seriously i don't know

2005-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 		i am just wondering how they managed to incorporate the rendering engine of Firefox and IE (without MS getting at them)
2005-05-26T12:56:00.000Z	Funraiser	danko123456	mine is the best in France called Free, best because it's the only one that allows connections to binary NGs...
2005-05-26T12:56:00.000Z	Funraiser		:-)
2005-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	Funraiser		for 30 euros a month, a 5 mega connection with access to binaries...how cool is that,
2005-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	Funraiser	i think its free... it seems people have tried it already
