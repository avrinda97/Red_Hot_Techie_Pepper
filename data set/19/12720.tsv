2005-12-13T10:21:00.000Z	gary_		I'll wait
2005-12-13T10:21:00.000Z	gary_		I am a newbee, and I need to find the kernel sources, i just cant find em
2005-12-13T10:22:00.000Z	gary_		I'm trtying tio install vpn client
2005-12-13T10:22:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	if you have downloaded them from synaptic they will be in /usr/src
2005-12-13T10:34:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	I looked and it is downladed, but does not show up, even as hidden
2005-12-13T10:37:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	for example, if you downloaded the kernel-source-2.6.10 from synaptic, there should be /usr/src/kernel-source-2.6.10.tar.gz there
2005-12-13T10:37:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	there is nothing in that directory. I checked synaptic, and it says installed
2005-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	which one did you install?
2005-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	let me check
2005-12-13T10:39:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	linux-inage-2.6.12-9.23
2005-12-13T10:40:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	it was installed when the whole system was installed
2005-12-13T10:40:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	linux-image does not include the sources.
2005-12-13T10:41:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	I'm new at this, how can I install the sources? I'm need it to install vpnclient from Cisco
2005-12-13T10:45:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	yes. start synaptic and click search. type in "kernel-source" and press ok. choose which source you want and install it.
2005-12-13T10:45:00.000Z	gary_	Jowi	it says it is already installed. Do I just do it again? Sorry for being so ignorant
2005-12-13T10:46:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	what is already installed? be precise
2005-12-13T10:47:00.000Z	Jowi	gary_	have a look here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelHowto?highlight=%28kernel%29
