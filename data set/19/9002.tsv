2008-03-18T04:38:00.000Z	Netham45		my "server" crashed opening vi... :(

2008-03-18T04:39:00.000Z	Netham45		meanie
2008-03-18T04:40:00.000Z	Netham45		well, this is annoying, vi crashed my server...
2008-03-18T04:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Netham45	How can vim crash a server?
2008-03-18T04:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Netham45	Sounds like opening /etc/networking/interfaces in vim and the server crashing was more a matter of correlation than causation
2008-03-18T04:53:00.000Z	Netham45	Jordan_U	those are some big words there.
2008-03-18T04:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Netham45	Just because it crashed after you started vi doesn't mean vi caused the crash, whatever caused the crash of the entire server is probably what caused vim to crash, not the other way around :)
2008-03-18T04:54:00.000Z	Netham45	Jordan_U	well, it is a brand new install, all I've done was install openssh-server.
2008-03-18T04:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Netham45	Can you pastebin your /etc/networking/interfaces ?
2008-03-18T04:55:00.000Z	Netham45	Jordan_U	why?
2008-03-18T04:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Netham45	To see if it was corrupted ( did I get the wrong nick ? )
