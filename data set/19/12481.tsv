2005-09-01T16:42:00.000Z	medamaybe		I'm trying to update using apt-get dist-upgrade, but I keep getting this:  "The following packages have been kept back:  gaim gimp mozilla-firefox mozilla-firefox-gnome-support smbclient" does anyone know wju?
2005-09-01T16:42:00.000Z	medamaybe		why*
2005-09-01T16:43:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	i would think that you have "backports" enabled that make it clash. try to comment it out before installing.
2005-09-01T16:43:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	backports? what's that?
2005-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	have you modified your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-09-01T16:45:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	something you put into sources.list also have the package you are trying to install. there are now conflicts in your repos. the same packages exist on several servers.
2005-09-01T16:46:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	I see...so how do I disable these backports?
2005-09-01T16:46:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	 first - try to put a # infront of the lines you added, then do a 'sudo apt-get update'
2005-09-01T16:52:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	are you still there?
2005-09-01T16:52:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	yeah. having a beer
2005-09-01T16:52:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	beer is good :)
2005-09-01T16:52:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	very. 4th Carlsberg down the drain.
2005-09-01T16:52:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	if I comment out the backports, the upgrades can't be found at all
2005-09-01T16:53:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	ahh sounds good, I wish I had some :)
2005-09-01T16:53:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	exactly what are you updating?
2005-09-01T16:54:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	well, I used the ubuntu updates. and it said "gaim, gimp, mozilla-firefox, mozilla-firefox-gnome-support and smbclient" were held back and I had to use apt0get dist-upgrade to update those
2005-09-01T16:57:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	do you have any suggestions?
2005-09-01T16:57:00.000Z	Jowi	medamaybe	if you really want those update, maybe you can force them with the -f option. not sure if thats advisable though since they are in conflict with other versions....
2005-09-01T16:58:00.000Z	medamaybe	Jowi	k, I don't want to risk that,  thanks
