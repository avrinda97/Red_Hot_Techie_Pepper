2009-07-14T08:07:00.000Z	m0r0n	Scunizi	I have no clue what you're talking
2009-07-14T08:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	m0r0n	what's the brand name of the printer/scanner?

2009-07-14T08:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	m0r0n	you can try starting xsane from terminal with sudo .. ie... sudo xsane .. this is a common theme with scanners and xsane for some reason..
2009-07-14T08:10:00.000Z	m0r0n	Scunizi	 Same thing when I click the icon
2009-07-14T08:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	m0r0n	Icon?  the xsane icon in the menu's?
2009-07-14T08:12:00.000Z	m0r0n	Scunizi	Applications>Graphics>XSane Image scanning program
2009-07-14T08:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	m0r0n	that's not what I asked you to test.. go to Applications>Accessories>Terminal and in the box that opens type .. sudo xsane
2009-07-14T08:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	m0r0n	ok.. just a thought.. I have to use my Brother all in one that way for some reason.. good luck
