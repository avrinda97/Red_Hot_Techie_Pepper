2011-06-29T11:03:00.000Z	degilnya		should i dpkg-reconfigure something?
2011-06-29T11:03:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	do as simple as possible script .php to test the installion
2011-06-29T11:05:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	i do not understand you, did you test the installation with a script or not?
2011-06-29T11:06:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	No idea. did you google for it? It might be output from the .php script?
2011-06-29T11:06:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	or where do you see that? I do not have even clue what is the real problem here
2011-06-29T11:08:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	oh google for the error
2011-06-29T11:09:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	you need to troubleshoot little more specific what gives that error
2011-06-29T11:09:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	if it is an php script printing that error, try to figure out what line
2011-06-29T11:09:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	if its the apache server, try to figure out with what .php file
2011-06-29T11:10:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	well then the server installation is not working with your webpage
2011-06-29T11:11:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	well maybe the server is then missing soma package that is required by your php script?
2011-06-29T11:12:00.000Z	susundberg	degilnya	I cant help without more info: what line causes the trouble, sorry
