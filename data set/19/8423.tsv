2008-11-21T16:24:00.000Z	cubex		When the disk gets inserted, it automounts and  on the desktop an icon gets displayed that their is a disk inside the dvdrw drive
2008-11-21T16:24:00.000Z	Ximal	cubex	... u r asking to make the icon of something mounted not appear on ur desktop ? correct ?
2008-11-21T16:25:00.000Z	cubex		i do not want it to appear after mounts

2008-11-21T16:25:00.000Z	cubex		look above, but what is the solution possibly?
2008-11-21T16:26:00.000Z	Ximal		hehe... i am not sure of the program but I believe there's a program like alltray that will put all icons in the system tray and change status/color when something is mounted
