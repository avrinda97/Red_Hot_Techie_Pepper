2005-10-24T07:42:00.000Z	Hoxzer_		how do I create new gnome user?
2005-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Hoxzer_		jowi: yeah, but if I just use "adduser" and then try to login it gives errors
2005-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Hoxzer_		yes
2005-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Hoxzer_		it gives error when I login
2005-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Hoxzer_		yes
2005-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Hoxzer_		it doesn't give right rights to new user
2005-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	that's correct. adduser does not create home directories and settings unless you tell it to. sudo users-admin will
2005-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	?
2005-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	what errors do you get?
2005-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	admin? have you enabled a root account?
2005-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	Jowi	how do I do that
2005-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	oh, so you didn't. phew! you do not need to enable a root account, that's the whole point :)
2005-10-24T07:53:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	Jowi	ok, do you know how should I shutdown x?
2005-10-24T07:53:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	ctrl-alt-backspace
2005-10-24T07:53:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	Jowi	doesn't that only restart X?
2005-10-24T07:54:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	it restarts it if you are lucky, haha. it's only a safety meassure
2005-10-24T07:55:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	take everything from the beginning. login with your normal account and run "sudo users-admin" to set up a new account. if the old account that you created is listed, delete it and add it again. you will get options for what the user is allowed to do. it's a good idea to enable audio support for the new user.
2005-10-24T07:56:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	Jowi	I already did that
2005-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	Jowi	Hoxzer_	so the new user still can't log in?
