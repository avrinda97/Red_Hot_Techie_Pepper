2007-02-21T17:12:00.000Z	davin		On radom occasions my monitor wont get any signal all of a sudden?
2007-02-21T17:13:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	How do you get it to come back?
2007-02-21T17:13:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	hard reboot
2007-02-21T17:14:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Did you try manhandling the monitor? ;P
2007-02-21T17:14:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	manhandling?
2007-02-21T17:15:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Yeah, whacking the front sides if it's a CRT, or gently twisting the top (or slightly more the sides) if it's a TFT or LCD ;)
2007-02-21T17:15:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	aha
2007-02-21T17:15:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Usually I'd suggest opening a console and typing xrandr commands blindly, but you'd need to know how to open a terminal without the mouse, and find out how to use xrandr
2007-02-21T17:16:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	well I just get no signal all of a sudden, cant boot up everything, though my PC is still running.
2007-02-21T17:17:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	OK, another thing to try if that happens is ctrl-alt-backspace, which kills X (and any programs in it) and (perhaps) restarts it.  Since that usually changes the resolution etc. that might get you a signal back
2007-02-21T17:17:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Also worth trying  is a slightly lower resolution/refresh rate for a few days to see if the monitor can't sustain the resolution you currently use
2007-02-21T17:18:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	OK.  In case you don't know already, if you're returned to a console you'll need to type 'startx' to get GUI running again.
2007-02-21T17:18:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Ahh, OK, that's good. :)
2007-02-21T17:20:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	also im running on 1024x768 now instead of 1152x864
2007-02-21T17:20:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	It's either that or the monitor, probably
2007-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	or this really stupid compaq pc (you just touch the back and it freezes, seriously)
2007-02-21T17:33:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Not having much luck today, mm? :/
2007-02-21T06:31:00.000Z	Ferret	davin	Don't jinx it ;P
2007-02-21T06:46:00.000Z	davin	Ferret	locked up but no screen loss
