2007-10-09T06:54:00.000Z	phpcurious		anybody has an idea what to do with this problem? "Error: C Compiler cannot create executables..."
2007-10-09T06:55:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	do you have write permissions in the directory you're trying to compile in?
2007-10-09T06:57:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	 i'm guessing you're trying to compile as an unpriviledged user in a directory only writable as root. that may not be the problem.  i don't know about the config.log
2007-10-09T06:58:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	hmm...how do i know then where the output files are located?
2007-10-09T06:58:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	in the current directory you're running the configure in
2007-10-09T06:59:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	thanks for the help...i m really a noob and ive been a windows user and now that I am developing web apps in linux, i really feel like an idiot.
2007-10-09T07:00:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	do what i do.  create a  src  directory in your home directory, and put your source code in there.
2007-10-09T07:10:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	i don't mean to bug you with this problem of mine , but even if I try to configure the source code in my /home directory it still say the same error...
2007-10-09T07:11:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	im not sure if it still has got to do with the permissions...
2007-10-09T07:11:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	did you install the build-essential package?
2007-10-09T07:12:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	don't know how...
2007-10-09T07:12:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	this is my first time to compile from source in linux
2007-10-09T07:13:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	wait, i will search the net for a tutorial about compiling a simple hello world ...
2007-10-09T07:20:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	when I was trying to compile a simple hello world it said that I don' t have g++ ... could it be that reason why I can't create c executables?
2007-10-09T07:20:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	 are you sure you installed the build-essential  package?  g++ should come with  build-essential
2007-10-09T07:21:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	apt-cache policy build-essential
2007-10-09T07:22:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	i tried sudo apt-get upgrade build-essential and it said there is nothing to install or upgrade ...
2007-10-09T07:22:00.000Z	wastrel	phpcurious	apt-get install build-essential
2007-10-09T07:30:00.000Z	phpcurious	wastrel	it works now ! you're a genius.
