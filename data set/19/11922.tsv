2008-06-05T05:31:00.000Z	mycroftiv		someguy: when does it stop? does something trigger it, or is it a random intermittent failure?
2008-06-05T05:32:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	random
2008-06-05T05:34:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	nope, how do I do that?
2008-06-05T05:36:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	to give you a little more background info, I used to run gutsy, but the AMD64 kernel, and I never had this problem there, I upgraded to hardy and switched to the 32 bit kernel because of the lack of java support in 32bit
2008-06-05T05:36:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	err, lack of java support in the 64 bit rather
2008-06-05T05:38:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	I have a USB WLAN adapter plugged in also, but I had this problem before I began using it
2008-06-05T05:38:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	I also occasionally plug in USB sticks/hard drives
2008-06-05T05:41:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	I piped two files from their output, but other than my system info I"m not really sure what I'm looking at here
2008-06-05T05:41:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	I mean I get that one's the hardware and the other is the module installed to support it, but what am I looking for exactly?
2008-06-05T05:42:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	aren't the modules more generic than the hardware typically?
2008-06-05T05:43:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	have you had any experience with virtualbox?
2008-06-05T05:44:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	because maybe that's related, now that I think about it, I think this has happened when I had virtualbox running
2008-06-05T05:44:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	and I'm not using the community release because I'm using it to pipe the USB devices over to the VMs
2008-06-05T05:45:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	could be, part of its installation process is installing kernel mods
2008-06-05T05:47:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	ok, lemme try that a second
2008-06-05T05:49:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	I'm going to try playing around with virtualbox to see if I can get the mouse to stop working
2008-06-05T05:50:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	yeah I've noticed that
2008-06-05T05:54:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	as a side note, do you know how to switch what applications use what network card when you have a USB wireless card and a wired network card installed and both are enabled at the same time?
2008-06-05T05:54:00.000Z	SomeGuy	mycroftiv	it seems like the preference goes to wireless, probably for laptops, is that configurable?
