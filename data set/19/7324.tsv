2007-09-11T10:24:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	and for your windows on the second disk, you'll need to do something like this http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/map.html
2007-09-11T10:27:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	so I should do map (hd0) (hd1) and the other way around? I don't really see what that does
2007-09-11T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	it fools windows into thinking it's booting from the first disk.
2007-09-11T10:27:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	that will make grub see it?
2007-09-11T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	but you still have to use hd1,<whateverpartition>
2007-09-11T10:28:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	I don't follow
2007-09-11T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	I know, it's weird ;)  Put your menu.lst on a pastebin, I'll point it out
2007-09-11T10:29:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	I did the map and map.. ok will do

2007-09-11T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	http://rafb.net/p/zL8GBh39.txt  add this stanza _after_ the END OF DEBIAN AUTOMAGIC line, edit to match your partition
2007-09-11T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	the root is possibly (hd1,0) for hdb1 I'd guess
2007-09-11T10:38:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	winxp is on 2,2 so it would be hd1,1 right
2007-09-11T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	disk 2, partition 2 is hd1,1
2007-09-11T10:44:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	ah ok well it works if I press esc i can choose windows. but how can I have a splash screen that comes up, and lets me pick automatically with no esc, and has a default value?
2007-09-11T10:44:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	a sec, I know, but must remember ;)
2007-09-11T10:44:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	actually when I try windows I get error 12: invalid device requested
2007-09-11T10:46:00.000Z	scythetleppo	nickrud	ok I figured out the right partition so ignore that part about windows not working
2007-09-11T10:48:00.000Z	nickrud	scythetleppo	look towards the top of the menu.lst, is hiddenmenu uncommented ? (no # at the beginning)
