2005-12-02T10:16:00.000Z	ZeroDni		hey i was wondering does it make any one mad that everybody that talks about secutiy in the news now is like buy a mac when you can use ubuntu or debain and get the same ease of use with out paying 1000 bucks for a slower machine
2005-12-02T10:17:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	ubuntu/debian aren't nearly as good on the workstation as osx is, no offense intended
2005-12-02T10:18:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	MS office, and no, openoffice isn't a substitute, you can't do sharing etc with it. photoshop (gimp? hah...) XSI (they might have a linux port now, not sure) - Logic Audio (mac only) - Cubase (mac/windows only)
2005-12-02T10:19:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	you can setup a collaborative editing session in office zero
2005-12-02T10:20:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	well in that case, could a normal user properly secure ubuntu?
2005-12-02T10:21:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	well, to each their own. :)
2005-12-02T10:28:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	well, i've not seen them say that, i do see them say it's an option :) i never saw "have to buy a mac" though :P they'd get sued
2005-12-02T10:31:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	it's freebsd + mach microkernel + freebsd 5 userland (in 10.4)
2005-12-02T10:31:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	you really don't seem to understand the work that went on with OSX
2005-12-02T10:31:00.000Z	ormandj	ZeroDni	i spent about 700 or 800 hours on OSX so :)
