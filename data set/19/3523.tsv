2012-05-23T11:44:00.000Z	ads_		i want to stop tomcat on my ubuntu how will i do that????
2012-05-23T11:45:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	try "sudo service tomcat stop"
2012-05-23T11:47:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	tried but its giving me error "tomcat: unrecognized service"
2012-05-23T11:47:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	ok, how did you *start* it?
2012-05-23T11:52:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	administrator installed tomcat and he is not available. so i dont know how did he started service
2012-05-23T11:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	do you have sudo?
2012-05-23T11:53:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	what exactly this will do?
2012-05-23T11:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	just print a list of all process with "omcat" in the name
2012-05-23T11:56:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	: http://pastie.org/3954314 this is output of previous command
2012-05-23T12:00:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	??
2012-05-23T12:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	ok, "sudo kill 26821". I don't know how easily you'll be able to re-start it though!
2012-05-23T12:03:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	b4 doing this i need to know exactly what it will do, as its risky for me to do on remote server
2012-05-23T12:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	it will kill the process numbered 26821, which by checking the output of the command you gave me should be the process ID of the tomcat server
2012-05-23T12:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	why do you need to close it anyways?
2012-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	actually i need to stop and then start it again
2012-05-23T12:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	oh, then don't run that, I can't guarantee it can be restarted easily
2012-05-23T12:08:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	so ne other solution, i just want to start it
2012-05-23T12:08:00.000Z	ads_	DarwinSurvivor	me too brb
2012-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ads_	you may be able to get some better advice in the #tomcat channel
