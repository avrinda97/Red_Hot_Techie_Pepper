2008-04-26T18:31:00.000Z	johnmike		Hi there! Anyone know of a good site to do Port Forwarding, learn all about it, set it up with Ubuntu, etc?
2008-04-26T18:31:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	www.portforward.com
2008-04-26T18:33:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	I've tried portforward.com and for whatever reason, it won't work when I follow all of my routers instructions
2008-04-26T18:36:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	some routers won't activate port forwarding until you disable DHCP. annoying, I know.
2008-04-26T18:38:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Ooooh....never tried that disabling that!
2008-04-26T18:39:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	unless you know how to set a static IP and have the DNS addresses, DON'T disable DHCP.
2008-04-26T18:40:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Ha ha, no. I would look it all up first. How would I learn how to setup static IPs, figure out DNSs, and all that on Ubuntu?
2008-04-26T18:40:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	are you using network-manager? (the network icon in the top right corner)
2008-04-26T18:41:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Yeah
2008-04-26T18:41:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	right click nm-applet, click connection information. copy down IP address, default route, subnet mask, and DNS addresses.
2008-04-26T18:44:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	lol, I hate it when the answers are so easy ;) Ok! Got it!
2008-04-26T18:45:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	after disabling DHCP you will no longer get any addresses from your network so you'd need to enter them manually into every machine on your network
2008-04-26T18:47:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Ok! How do I make sure than my Ubuntu box is listening on the ports I need it to?
2008-04-26T18:47:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	that all depends on the program you're running that needs the ports forwarded.
2008-04-26T18:48:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Yeah. I'm just trying to set it up mainly for transmission, but someone had told me that I had to be careful when selecting a port for use because specific ports are reserved for specific things.
2008-04-26T18:49:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	select any port you want above 30000 as a safe rule. they can go up to 65535.
2008-04-26T18:49:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Ah...ok!
2008-04-26T18:49:00.000Z	johnmike	mut80r	Thanks!
2008-04-26T18:49:00.000Z	mut80r	johnmike	no problem.
