2009-07-19T03:55:00.000Z	[R]	Samuel	dmesg or lspci
2009-07-19T04:07:00.000Z	[R]	Samuel	jockey
2009-07-19T04:07:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	Thanks.
2009-07-19T04:09:00.000Z	[R]	Samuel	what makes you think there is one?
2009-07-19T04:10:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	I'm just trying different things to try and fix my problem.
2009-07-19T04:10:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	Because this problem is getting right on my tits.
2009-07-19T04:13:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	linuxguy2009: Could upgrading from linux-image-generic from 2.6.28.13.17 to 2.6.28.14.18 fix the problem?
2009-07-19T04:14:00.000Z	[R]	Samuel	i have no idea what your "problem" is... but 2.6.28.13 to 2.6.28.14 isn't really gonna fix much

2009-07-19T04:17:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	dmesg log
2009-07-19T04:17:00.000Z	[R]	Samuel	whats the problem
2009-07-19T04:18:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	"My wireless in Jaunty will work incredibly fast for a while and then once it hits a certain amount of data transfered it just stops working altogether and I have to reboot to get it to work again. It still says I'm connected, it still shows networks, it just doesn't transfer an data. If i don't download anything big it will stay working indefinitely, but when the megabytes start flying it tanks... religiously."
2009-07-19T04:18:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	That's exactly my problem.
2009-07-19T04:18:00.000Z	[R]	Samuel	weird... you should file a bug report
2009-07-19T04:19:00.000Z	Samuel	[R]	A big report won't solve my problem tonight.
