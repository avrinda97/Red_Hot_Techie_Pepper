2008-01-12T16:52:00.000Z	Symmetria		find/ls will both take hours :)
2008-01-12T16:53:00.000Z	Symmetria		(got an ls-lR running at the moment, its 70 meg big so far and growing :p Im expecting at least a 500meg output)
2008-01-12T16:54:00.000Z	Symmetria		heh madmike damn, was hoping to get some file info outta em :) but no biggie, can wait for this ls-lR to finish
2008-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	Symmetria		heh so far its at 1.3 million files, probably about 5% of the way
2008-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	Symmetria		(this is a rather... large system Im doing this on)
2008-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	why do you do ls-rR anyway?
2008-01-12T16:50:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	jup
2008-01-12T16:50:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	Files and Folder or just files
2008-01-12T16:51:00.000Z	Symmetria	madmike	both preferably, just trying to figure out how long this ls-lR is going to take and how big it is going to be
2008-01-12T16:52:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	use this
2008-01-12T16:52:00.000Z	Symmetria	madmike	heh, was hoping to avoid using find, was looking for someone that looked at the disks allocation tables
2008-01-12T16:53:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	hmm
2008-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	Symmetria	madmike	for the root of the ftp directory :)
2008-01-12T16:56:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	seems to be THE ftp directory ;)
2008-01-12T16:57:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	this seems like a really big ftp-server no kidding
2008-01-12T16:57:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	I hope you will engrave the result of this somewhere... poor mirror doing all this work ;)
2008-01-12T16:58:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	are you the admin of this thing?
2008-01-12T16:58:00.000Z	Symmetria	madmike	*nod*
2008-01-12T16:59:00.000Z	madmike	Symmetria	a proud admin then ;)
