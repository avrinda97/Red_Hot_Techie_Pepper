2007-12-05T12:28:00.000Z	x_zeuss		what would be best for a server ubuntu 7.10 or debian?
2007-12-05T12:29:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	it's a matter of preference. I run a debian server and an ubuntu dapper server
2007-12-05T12:30:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	With ubuntu I prefer a LTS release for servers
2007-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	both will doe fine. Depending on the hardware and what you want the server to do
2007-12-05T12:32:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	In that case I would use 7.10 server and upgrade to 8.04 next april. Upgrades go smooth most of the time
2007-12-05T12:33:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	any current hardware will do for 50 clients. I used a P1-200 for mail and some other stuff for a 20 clients network for years
2007-12-05T12:35:00.000Z	x_zeuss	johns^	so your suggestion would be to go with ubuntu, not debian? i would prefer ubuntu because i can also find lots of tutorials for the server setup and because it is really up to date
2007-12-05T12:35:00.000Z	x_zeuss	johns^	what do u think about opensuse?
2007-12-05T12:36:00.000Z	x_zeuss	johns^	or what would you recomand for desktop use for a company with an ubuntu server?
2007-12-05T12:37:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	Windows XP :P
2007-12-05T12:38:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	no really, if you want Linux, use a beginner friendly distribution. I prefer ubuntu 7.10 atm, but Suse is allright, Xandros I have a soft spot for (been beta tester for the very first release) or Fedora
2007-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	or Mint, that's Ubuntu based btw
2007-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	x_zeuss	johns^	the idea is to use a free distro and also a good distro, i also thought about mint
2007-12-05T12:40:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	Free and good: it doesn't really matter. I think Ubuntu is very easy to install and and support for nvidia, ati, mp3, flash, java plugin, that kind of stuff
2007-12-05T12:48:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	you don't have to run the X-server even when it's installed. but apt-get install x/k/ubuntu-desktop will give you a GUI
2007-12-05T12:49:00.000Z	johns^	x_zeuss	I run windowmaker on my debian server, but it's not started at boot time.
2007-12-05T12:54:00.000Z	x_zeuss	johns^	would it be easier to maintain a server with a gui? i don't worry about the computers resources, that won't be a problem
2007-12-05T12:55:00.000Z	x_zeuss	johns^	?
