2005-03-11T08:19:00.000Z	DonL		I've killed systems so bad before so many times just playin around I guess I'm used to it now
2005-03-11T08:19:00.000Z	DonL		good on ya, b
2005-03-11T08:20:00.000Z	DonL		What video card are you running, b?
2005-03-11T08:21:00.000Z	DonL		Are you using hardware acceleration, and what drivers?
2005-03-11T08:23:00.000Z	DonL		The acceleration (reason for buying a nice card) seems to be a feature I would like to have enabled, but with Xorg, it seems to be a problem
2005-03-11T08:24:00.000Z	DonL		Yes, b.
2005-03-11T08:25:00.000Z	DonL		I know how, but every time you update the driver, or update the kernel, you have to go through this big thing

2005-03-11T08:28:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	and b, thanks. I've saved the page and I'll look into it later
2005-08-05T09:21:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	I put in a SB live card when I was having problems, and everything was fixed
2005-10-04T09:40:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	are you running Breezy?
2005-10-04T09:40:00.000Z	bob2	DonL	yes
2005-10-04T09:40:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	did you upgrade, and did you have any problems?
2005-10-04T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	DonL	yes, only that X didn't start, which was trivial to fix
2005-10-04T09:41:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	help! That's my problem. I don't know how to fix it
2005-10-04T09:42:00.000Z	bob2	DonL	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-10-04T09:56:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	it appears I don
2005-10-04T09:59:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	can I ask what you did again? Maybe I wrote it down wrong. Was it "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org?
2005-10-04T10:03:00.000Z	DonL	bob2	seems like you're needed tonight. I'll try a few other things and let you know. Thanks for your help. Night
