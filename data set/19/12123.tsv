2005-10-13T09:11:00.000Z	keb	joe_	what is the problem exactly, describe what you did and what is happening
2005-10-13T09:13:00.000Z	keb	joe_	there is probably an installer that has to be run in that realplayer folder on your desktop
2005-10-13T09:15:00.000Z	joe_	keb	when i run apt-get install realplayer it starts up an installer
2005-10-13T09:15:00.000Z	keb	joe_	thats great
2005-10-13T09:17:00.000Z	keb	joe_	it is likely in /home/joe_/Desktop/realplayer
2005-10-13T09:18:00.000Z	keb	joe_	or whatever the name of the folder is
2005-10-13T09:18:00.000Z	joe_	keb	ive tried pointing there and no luck
2005-10-13T09:19:00.000Z	keb	joe_	did you try /home/joe_/Desktop
2005-10-13T09:30:00.000Z	joe_	keb	what is an unmet dependency?
2005-10-13T09:30:00.000Z	keb	joe_	something is missing to run realplayer
