2008-12-28T12:51:00.000Z	Rakko		Is it possible to update from Hardy to Intrepid using the Intrepid CD (regular, not alternate)?
2008-12-28T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	Not upgrade, no.
2008-12-28T12:52:00.000Z	Rakko	Flannel	Ok. I thought I could just add the CD as cdrom: in sources.list, but it just went ahead and downloaded everything instead, so I wondered why.
2008-12-28T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	right, you need the alternate CD to be able to upgrade.
2008-12-28T12:57:00.000Z	Rakko	Flannel	I've upgraded all the packages that had updates, but lsb_release still says Hardy
2008-12-28T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	That link will walk you through the upgrade process.  You'll have to do it from the internet if you don't have an alternate CD
2008-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	Rakko	Flannel	I'd already read this page. Does it make a difference that I upgraded with Upgrade Manager instead of Synaptic?
2008-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	No, update-manager is the suggested method
2008-12-28T13:01:00.000Z	Rakko	Flannel	Oh... "click on the "Updates" tab and change "Show new distribution release" to "Normal releases"" -- I don't think I did that
2008-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	You don't manually change that stuff.
2008-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	the only setting you have to change is the non-LTS releases in software sources.  Or wait for 10.04 to roll around.
2008-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	Scheduled to be, yeah
2008-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	You don't need to edit your sources at all to ugprade, update-managert does it for you.
2008-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	they're YY.MM (Year.Month)
2008-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Rakko	Flannel	oh, I know... I'm thinking for more technical things.
2008-12-28T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	No, there's just two upgrade cycles.  Wehther you want to upgrade every few years, or every few months.
2008-12-28T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	obviously though, older, more mature software is more stable.
2008-12-28T13:08:00.000Z	Rakko	Flannel	I went to Intrepid because Hardy kept dropping me into busybox when I tried to boot
2008-12-28T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Rakko	XFCE
