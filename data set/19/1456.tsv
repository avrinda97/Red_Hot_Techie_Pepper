2011-01-20T02:25:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	so your saying of of over 1500 people, nobody can answer a simple boot question.
2011-01-20T02:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	Yes, nobody here currently can answer your question or they likely would have. Providing more details or asking again later when different people are here might help. Also note that just becuase a problem seems simple to you does not neccessarily mean it is so.
2011-01-20T02:27:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	so booting from an iso on a usb is complicated?
2011-01-20T02:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	Normally, no. Normally it should Just Workâ„¢. The fact that it is not working means that something has happened which the developers of the tools used did not anticipate, which means that it is likely a complicated problem that you in particular are having.
2011-01-20T02:30:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	k, sorry but im sick of this shit. ive been trying to get an answer for 3 days.
2011-01-20T02:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	Please watch your language, and while your frustration is understandable taking it out on a channel full of people volunteering their time to help others is not.
2011-01-20T02:32:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	ok.
2011-01-20T02:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	How did you make it into a bootable USB stick? What tool did you use?
2011-01-20T02:40:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	unetbootin
2011-01-20T02:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	Try using "Universal USB installer" as explained on the Ubuntu download page: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download If that fails the same way there are other options, but they require much more manual setup.
2011-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	The firmware?
2011-02-04T02:58:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	Yeah, like NTFS
2011-02-04T02:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	The word you want is "filesystem".
2011-02-04T02:59:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	ahh ok, it says firmware on the disk utility here. How can I change it from 3.AAE to NTFS?
2011-02-04T03:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	You can use GParted. But if you're going to just do a fresh install then let the installer format the drive.
2011-02-04T03:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yugnoswam	Screenshot?
2011-02-04T03:01:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	I tried a fresh install (Windows 7) but it just came up that the system has to be on NTFS and it wouldnt let me format it from there. GParted won't let me create a partition either
2011-02-04T03:01:00.000Z	Yugnoswam	Jordan_U	check private
