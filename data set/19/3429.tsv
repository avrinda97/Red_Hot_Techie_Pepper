The monitor is not dead because when im on windows the monitor is fine.  can any1 help me?
2011-05-14T21:53:00.000Z	ygor		rcmaeh1: no i tryed reinstalling with my usb drive, but everytime ubuntu starts, the monitor go black... and its only black when ubuntu starts...just after boot screen
2011-05-14T21:53:00.000Z	mathews	ygor	did u tried live session
2011-05-14T21:54:00.000Z	ygor	mathews	yes...i dont know if its a problem with this..because some configs are saved everyime i use the live session from the usb drive
2011-05-14T21:54:00.000Z	ygor		i mean, even with the cd, or with the usb drive, my screen go black when ubuntu starts to boot...
2011-05-14T21:55:00.000Z	mathews	ygor	how u created the USB
2011-05-14T21:56:00.000Z	ygor		but i can see, when i disconect HDMI that things are on screen, but too dark to see...
2011-05-14T21:57:00.000Z	ygor	mathews	i burn the ubuntu 11.04 image into a cd... then using the CD live i created the usb drive by the ubuntu tool itself
2011-05-14T21:57:00.000Z	mathews	ygor	good,the usb is fresh,right?
2011-05-14T21:57:00.000Z	ygor		rcmaeh1: yeah i tryed this..but its not a bright issue.. lokks too too dark to see.
2011-05-14T21:58:00.000Z	ygor		captainkrtek:  yeah but some how did not work.
2011-05-14T21:58:00.000Z	ygor	mathews	fresh yep.
2011-05-14T21:58:00.000Z	ygor	mathews	but weird becase when i boot from the usb drive, after leting my laptop off for a while, configurations like wifi network are still saved..
