2010-01-21T23:22:00.000Z	paulus68		when you connect to your server through putty for example you can trace this logon through the auth.log is there a way to trace how long a given user was active on my server remotely?
2010-01-21T23:22:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	look at "last"
2010-01-21T23:23:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	in the auth.log?
2010-01-21T23:23:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	no, start last in the terminal.
2010-01-21T23:23:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	ok
2010-01-21T23:24:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	do you know where this info is logged?
2010-01-21T23:25:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	in /var/log/wtmp (a binary file)
2010-01-21T23:26:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	if you're interested in failed login attempts, try "lastb"
2010-01-21T23:28:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	well I have that info already since I have a script that takes a look at succesful and failed logon attempts which is sent to me every hour from 7 am till 22 pm. after that the script holds all the info till the next morning
2010-01-21T23:28:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	in order to get the server to send me a mail I need to create a script that is going to collect this data and puts it in a file which I can use to send to my mailbox
2010-01-21T23:29:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	sounds like you have everything you need.
2010-01-21T23:31:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	well just need to find out the last part think I will do a script stating last>>/temp/last and then pick it up through mail then
2010-01-21T23:32:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	if your system is configured to send mail already, you can just invoke "mail" in the script directly.
2010-01-21T23:32:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	I know I do that already
2010-01-21T23:37:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	this is the script that I use actually for the logon attempts to my server http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m2fd194a7 would the hour part also help me to filter this info by day? if so any pointers would be helpfull
2010-01-21T23:46:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	this looks fine, but you might have a look at the logcheck package, which will handle this sort of thing for you easily.
2010-01-21T23:48:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	where can I find info concerning this?
2010-01-21T23:49:00.000Z	sipior	paulus68	http://logcheck.org/
2010-01-21T23:49:00.000Z	paulus68	sipior	thx
