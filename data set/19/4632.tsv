2008-12-25T12:50:00.000Z	Son_of_Demetrius		si I can't install software of any kind without an internet connection?
2008-12-25T12:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	you're on the internet now? right? other computer is not? where is the other computer?
2008-12-25T13:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	it means that there is something that is trying to install a package somewhere else, or a package installation got interrupted and the lock file got left behind(stale lock file)
2008-12-25T13:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	if your trying to use dpkg or apt-get/aptitude, make sure you don't have one of them running somewhere else too
2008-12-25T13:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	i don't know that anything's wrong. what are you trying to do? if it's just update your system, then do...  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-12-25T13:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	if you get the same response... '0 upgraded 0 installed etc...   then your system is fully up to date
2008-12-25T13:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	are you at the system with a package you want to install? a .deb package?
2008-12-25T13:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	go to the directory containing the .deb package you want to install. then do -->   sudo dpkg -i <package_name>
2008-12-25T13:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	what are you trying to do?
2008-12-25T13:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Son_of_Demetrius	yes
