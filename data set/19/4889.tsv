2008-10-17T07:22:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	what do you play them in
2008-10-17T07:23:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	try totem/mplayer and check if alsa is installed

2008-10-17T07:24:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	ps aw | grep alsa
2008-10-17T07:26:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	no you need to install alsa
2008-10-17T07:26:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	apt-cache search alsa
2008-10-17T07:29:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	search through it and find alsa audio server and install that package
2008-10-17T07:33:00.000Z	Pulpie	ZraS87	sudo apt-get install alsa-base
