2009-08-14T18:27:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	thanks a lot, ill have a look
2009-08-14T18:29:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	do you automount devices?
2009-08-14T18:30:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	oke...
2009-08-14T18:31:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	try "   sudo apt-get install gvfs-backends   "
2009-08-14T18:31:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	the desktop icons should actually come back when nautilus is restarted
2009-08-14T18:31:00.000Z	Jangal	masquerade	gvfs-backends is already the newest version.
2009-08-14T18:32:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	i am not sure, but i think reinstalling this backage should help. i will test it, one second
2009-08-14T18:32:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	no, this does not make sense, you would have to install nautilus.
2009-08-14T18:32:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	im sorry, i cant help you with this
2009-08-14T18:35:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	maybe theres something wrong with the computer:/// prefix
2009-08-14T18:36:00.000Z	Jangal	masquerade	ok thank you.
2009-08-14T18:37:00.000Z	masquerade	Jangal	no prob
