I have been using a live cd to use synaptic to generate download scripts to create my own repository CD with great results with using a multisession CD so i can add apps as i go and never have to download them more than once.Its great. My question is doing the same thing with the live session but going and creating a download script of all curren
2009-07-03T08:58:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		oy nevermind
2009-07-03T08:59:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Ive been using virtualbox it works great. You didnt let me finish.
2009-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		When i do the same with updates Ive been using multisession CD in Nero Linux 3, but I get tons of wasted space cause of file overwrites.Im thinking theres no workaround, its just a limitation of Nero Linux app?
2009-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Ill just burn disk at once for the updates if I have to no biggy,
2009-07-03T09:01:00.000Z	mase_work	linuxguy2009	out of curiousity why would you use the Nero Linux app when there are much better burning applications available which are provided as part of the distro ?
2009-07-03T09:01:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Well ever since 8.10 I always had trouble with brasero and also k3b with verifies failing every time.
2009-07-03T09:02:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Has braser improved on that? or maybe it was just the 8.10 release that was really buggy for me.

2009-07-03T09:02:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		The main pc has internet
2009-07-03T09:03:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Im making my own repository cd and its great I only have to ever install anything just once and I have all its deps in folders with a homeade install script to install them from CD.
2009-07-03T09:03:00.000Z	mase_work	linuxguy2009	can't say i've experienced that, however both brasario and k3b use the underlying cdrecord ( or forked version ) afaik so you may like to file a bug report and see if they can work out why its' failing. Are you sure thechecksums aren't actually different and nero is just ignoring this ?
2009-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	mase_work	Umm no it has an option to verify and it works. Maybe I will give brasero a second chance. Maybe it works better now than before.
2009-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Does brasero have a verify and also support multisession?
2009-07-03T09:05:00.000Z	mase_work	linuxguy2009	so you have verified it manually , ie not using brasereo or nero ?
2009-07-03T09:05:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Yes I verify with nero.
2009-07-03T09:05:00.000Z	mase_work	linuxguy2009	then no you haven't done it manually
2009-07-03T09:05:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Why would i need to verify a CD manually when Nero does it for me after every burn?
2009-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	mase_work	linuxguy2009	 because either Nero or brasereo is lying if they are using the same burner
