2009-11-04T02:47:00.000Z	cheater99		is there some way to emulate the mouse using, say, the numpad?
2009-11-04T02:48:00.000Z	cheater99		uh
2009-11-04T02:48:00.000Z	cheater99		no.
2009-11-04T02:50:00.000Z	cheater99		jesus why is ubuntu so broken
2009-11-04T02:50:00.000Z	cheater99		i can't get it to work in any way what so ever and all i did was update it
2009-11-04T02:51:00.000Z	cheater99		now i won't be able to work tomorrow because my laptop is broken, i should've stuck windows on it
2009-11-04T02:51:00.000Z	cheater99		that's just amazingly disappointing.
2009-11-04T02:51:00.000Z	cheater99		yes, but not when i try to update it
2009-11-04T02:52:00.000Z	cheater99		not for me in the last 8 years.
2009-11-04T02:52:00.000Z	gbear14275	cheater99	you're having mouse problems?
2009-11-04T02:52:00.000Z	gbear14275	cheater99	what are you running it on?
2009-11-04T02:55:00.000Z	gbear14275	cheater99	I'd try a usb mouse or ps2 mouse to see if that fizes it
2009-11-04T02:55:00.000Z	cheater99	gbear14275	it does, but i don't own one.
2009-11-04T02:56:00.000Z	gbear14275	cheater99	ask a neighbor... they are like the "cup o sugar" of the 21st century
2009-11-04T02:56:00.000Z	cheater99	gbear14275	there are no neighbors. i am in a hotel. in a foreign country. in the middle of nowhere
2009-11-04T02:57:00.000Z	gbear14275	cheater99	lol even better... take it from the business office ;)
2009-11-04T02:57:00.000Z	gbear14275	cheater99	sorry man... borrow it for a while then?  what about a reinstall with a more stable version?
2009-11-04T02:58:00.000Z	cheater99	gbear14275	i can't borrow anything here, that is not a solution. what sort of 'reinstall' do you suggest?
