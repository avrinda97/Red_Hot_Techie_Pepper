2009-12-29T04:55:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	eh, the google effect :)
2009-12-29T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	its just easy to remember
2009-12-29T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	otherwise I more than not use my own dns service
2009-12-29T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	makes webbrowsing faster
2009-12-29T04:56:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	indeed. weird that nobody thought about it before
2009-12-29T04:56:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	(I mean simple DNS addresses)
2009-12-29T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	there are many simple dns addresses
2009-12-29T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	2.2.2.2    2.2.2.3
2009-12-29T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	if you install and configure dnsmasq you will reduce dns resolves on the web and will use a locally stored cace, making web browsing faster
2009-12-29T04:59:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	yep I also went down that path once, I think I got fed up because it had unwanted package dependencies
2009-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	I have just checked that a touch T8282 can connect to wpa2-AES without issues
2009-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	i use wep, with other extra security measures built in
2009-12-29T05:02:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	I'd personally abandon WEP at all
2009-12-29T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	if you add extra security its fine
2009-12-29T05:02:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	like dynamic WEP?
2009-12-29T05:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	no like hidden ESSIDs, weird IP netmask, no dhcp, mac filtering, weird non-readable SSID, restricted ariel power
2009-12-29T05:04:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	yes but anybody can dump your WEP traffic and "decrypt" it
2009-12-29T05:04:00.000Z	eix	ActionParsnip	and it takes no time to detect IP addresses, netmasks and your other passwords
2009-12-29T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eix	sure, but its good enough for me.
