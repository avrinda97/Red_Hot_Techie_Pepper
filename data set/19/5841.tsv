2008-05-06T08:09:00.000Z	dmsuperman		how can I find the executable for VMWare workstation? for some reason my menu is pointing to "/usr/bin/vmwareesd" which doesn't exist, and "locate vmware" returns too many results to sift through
2008-05-06T08:11:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	Do you have /usr/bin/vmware?
2008-05-06T08:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	I guess it would make sense to try that wouldn't it...that's it :P
2008-05-06T08:11:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	*lol*
2008-05-06T08:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	in the future though, is there a good way to search for any executable file i might be looking for?
2008-05-06T08:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	for things like progs installed to non-standard locations
2008-05-06T08:12:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	"type". Try: type vmware
2008-05-06T08:12:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	On, but that won't handle non-standard locations, sorry.
2008-05-06T08:12:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	You really will have to use locate for that.
2008-05-06T08:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	darn. oh well, a new command is always useful though :D
2008-05-06T08:13:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	how about this: How can I edit my menu icon so it will launch vmware, and not vmwareesd?
2008-05-06T08:14:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	Try: locate vmware-workstation.desktop
2008-05-06T08:14:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	If you can find it, then chances are you can edit it with a text editor.
2008-05-06T08:14:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	Other alternative: right-click on it, then add it to panel. You can then right-click the icon in your panel to edit it.
2008-05-06T08:15:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	Edits to your panel item don't affect what's launched from the menu, however.
2008-05-06T08:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	yeah, then that wouldn't really help
2008-05-06T08:15:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	Then locate your vmware-workstation.desktop and edit it by hand.
2008-05-06T08:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	cky	but i edited it with a text editor, all is well :D
2008-05-06T08:16:00.000Z	cky	dmsuperman	Good stuff!
