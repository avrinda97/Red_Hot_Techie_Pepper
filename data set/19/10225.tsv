2006-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	newUbU		hi
2006-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	newUbU		Can I install Ubuntu on top of Win98SE ?
2006-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	yes
2006-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	you mean without a separate partition ?
2006-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	I mean ontop
2006-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	are they not the same ?
2006-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	I see, actually I did not intend to remove it, maybe share the same partition with win98 ?
2006-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	I suggest you try running ubuntu off the cd first for a while. If you want to run it in windows 98, look at vmware www.vmware.com
2006-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	you may also want to look at the colinux project for windows. Which runs the linux kernel under windows.
2006-07-10T05:44:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	seraphim I thought you could save sessions while running the Live CD on the windows partition, that way you save repeating many things ?
2006-07-10T05:44:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	I don't really mess with the live edition except for recovering systems.
2006-07-10T05:44:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	indeed I found myself rebooting the live-CD for recovering several times and it was boring
2006-07-10T05:46:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	yes
2006-07-10T05:57:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	if your P4 has 64bit extentions, yes.
2006-07-10T05:58:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	I happen to have a 64-bit ubuntu CD :)
2006-07-10T06:00:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	I think your PC will be much faster if you can access 64-bits in one go, rather than two calls of 32 bits each
2006-07-10T06:01:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2006-07-10T06:01:00.000Z	newUbU	Ash-Fox	from windows ?
2006-07-10T06:01:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	newUbU	if you got cygwin, sure.
