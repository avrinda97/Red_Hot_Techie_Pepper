2005-11-08T12:32:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	do you have the users option in your /etc/fstab/
2005-11-08T12:33:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	 what are users options?
2005-11-08T12:34:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	if you include users as an option then any user may mount and access the drive
2005-11-08T12:35:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	that's because you mounted the drive as root
2005-11-08T12:36:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	how i can login as root without reeboting?
2005-11-08T12:37:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	no need to login, simply do "sudo umount <mount>"
2005-11-08T12:44:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	could you post the contents of /etc/fstab somewhre for us?
2005-11-08T12:45:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	how i can do that?
2005-11-08T12:45:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	'sudo cat /etc/fstab' then post it to a pastebin
2005-11-08T12:46:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4004
2005-11-08T12:47:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	on the lines that begin /dev/hda1 5 and 6, change defaults to user. To do this run "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab"
2005-11-08T12:49:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	i cannot, i got this: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4005
2005-11-08T12:51:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	hrm, maybe "sudo gedit /etc/fstab"
2005-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	and then i just save and close ?
2005-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	yes, once you've made the changes
2005-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	ok i did
2005-11-08T12:53:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	now you should be able to mount/umount the partitions as your normal user
2005-11-08T12:53:00.000Z	farruinn	arthur	and read/write if applicable
2005-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	arthur	farruinn	i cant!
