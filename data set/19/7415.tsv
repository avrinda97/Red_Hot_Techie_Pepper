2008-02-08T16:28:00.000Z	Thurin1	daurnimator	You're leaving out critical information my man ;D
2008-02-08T16:28:00.000Z	daurnimator	Thurin1	vmware. local.
2008-02-08T16:29:00.000Z	Thurin1	daurnimator	Make sure that you have smbclient installed, no errors about hal/dbus (if you are in Gnome) - and double check your Vmware network settings - they do have some warnings/tricks in that section.
2008-02-08T16:29:00.000Z	Thurin1	daurnimator	Oh, also make sure that your actual box and the emulated system do not share the same address - that will block one of them out on some routers.
2008-02-08T16:30:00.000Z	daurnimator	Thurin1	vm is 192.168.146.128
2008-02-08T16:31:00.000Z	Thurin1	daurnimator	What is the OS you are using vmware on? XP?
2008-02-08T16:32:00.000Z	daurnimator	Thurin1	ubuntu
2008-02-08T16:33:00.000Z	Thurin1	daurnimator	Ok, So your running ubuntu.. to run Ubuntu in vmware?
