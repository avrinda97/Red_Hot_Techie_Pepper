2012-02-27T21:02:00.000Z	okum		hi, i have a pretty noobish question.. can you use any windows installer with wine?
2012-02-27T21:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	okum	yes but weather or not it will work is a different matter. Check appdb for compatibility
2012-02-27T21:03:00.000Z	okum	ActionParsnip	i just mean, could i go download any trial of a windows program and it shall work if known to work? :P
2012-02-27T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	okum	sure, as long as the appdb says its ok then you'll be ok
2012-02-27T21:04:00.000Z	okum	ActionParsnip	alright, that's all i wanted to know. thanks, and also thanks _Marcus for the link. (:
2012-02-27T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	okum	the appd also has little hints on settings too
