2007-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	which part?
2007-11-15T13:48:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	like?
2007-11-15T13:48:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	i no longer have a cube for desktop switching.  it now does something similar to macs spaces
2007-11-15T13:49:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	you can install compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-11-15T13:49:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	and in there choose your plugins
2007-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	this is not working for some reason
2007-11-15T13:52:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager says it's installed, latest version.  but there's no cli for it
2007-11-15T13:52:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	system settings custom desktop effects or something like that
2007-11-15T13:52:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	going to "System -> Preferences -> Compizconfig ... " doesn't work either
2007-11-15T13:53:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	try ccsm in a terminal and see if you get a error
2007-11-15T13:54:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	i click the menu item, it says "ok clicked.  great!" then nothing .
2007-11-15T13:54:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	as i said. runt it in terminal
2007-11-15T13:55:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	it fails with that message
2007-11-15T13:55:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	i have no idea. google that message! :)
2007-11-15T13:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	yeah, it's loading ...
2007-11-15T13:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	thanx for the command
2007-11-15T13:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	yaay pages
2007-11-15T14:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	larsemil	looks like the sol'n was to uninstall compizconfig-settings-manager because the one i had was from trevino's repo, then install but the new one is from ubuntu
2007-11-15T14:03:00.000Z	larsemil	ozzloy	thought it was something like that
