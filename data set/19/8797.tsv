2007-02-12T16:35:00.000Z	nexousNET		Hi, Whenever I visit http://localhost/, it brings me to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost...
2007-02-12T16:35:00.000Z	nexousNET		Anyone know why it isn't displaying /opt/htdocs/...
2007-02-12T16:36:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	hahah... that must be your DNS :-) does /etc/hosts and possibly /etc/resolv.conf list localhost?
2007-02-12T16:37:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	give me a minute and I'll check.
2007-02-12T16:39:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	'o127.0.0.1 localhost nexousCORE' is in hosts.
2007-02-12T16:40:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	is that "o" actually there or is it a typo?
2007-02-12T16:41:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	yes the o is in there.
2007-02-12T16:41:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	uhm, i have no clue why - did you ever edit that file manually? anyway, remove the "o", it has no place there
2007-02-12T16:42:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	no I never have, but okay.
2007-02-12T16:42:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	well, it's a trivial thing, and yet if you are very sure you never edited that file, it sounds suspicious somewhat...
2007-02-12T16:42:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	how do I change it from read-only?
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	wait, don't change it yet
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	okay.
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	do an  ls -l /etc/hosts  - when was it last modified?
2007-02-12T16:44:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 254 2007-02-09 17:53 /etc/hosts
2007-02-12T16:45:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	so it was modified two days ago at about 6pm, do you recall doing anything special at that time?
2007-02-12T16:45:00.000Z	nexousNET	LjL	I had previously tried compiling my own server by myself, But I'm now using Xampp for Linux because it wasn't working,.
2007-02-12T16:47:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	uhm, ok then i guess it's probably xampp that did it... ok, anyway, that /etc/hosts files is not "read-only", it's simply owned by root with write permissions for root only -- and it should stay that way
2007-02-12T16:47:00.000Z	LjL	nexousNET	just edit it with root privileges:  gksudo gedit /etc/hosts , or sudo nano /etc/hosts  if you're from a console
