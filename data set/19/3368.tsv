2009-08-28T14:33:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	don't you have to run it with enable plugins each time
2009-08-28T14:33:00.000Z	xtknight		apt-get install testdisk, boom, you dont need to first 512 bytes of the disk
2009-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	xtknight		or, partition
2009-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	takeshi-		i always run with --enable-plugins
2009-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	xtknight		there are about 10 backup MFTs on an ext4 partition.  did you know that?
2009-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	xtknight		lol
2009-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	xtknight		weasel words
2009-08-28T14:35:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	not sure, it works for me with many instances of chromium open
2009-08-28T14:36:00.000Z	takeshi-	xtknight	i always run chromium with --enable-plugins. Flash seems to work again if i reinstall chromium but again only the first boot
2009-08-28T14:36:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	but i have trouble with flash just totally stealing my audio, so i have to close them all anyway.  not sure if that's a chromium only problem
2009-08-28T14:36:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	try to do a diff of when you reinstall it and after you execute it once
2009-08-28T14:37:00.000Z	takeshi-		ok
2009-08-28T14:38:00.000Z	takeshi-		thanks xtknight ( takeshi- runs to find a howto to make a diff, XD)
2009-08-28T14:38:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	it looks like ~/.config/chromium is good place to diff
2009-08-28T14:38:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	oh dont worry about that, it's just "diff -Nru old_folder new_folder > mydiffoutput.diff"
2009-08-28T14:39:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	what you want to do is copy a clean reinstall of ~/.config/chromium to ~/Desktop/chromium-good and then diff that ~/Desktop/chromium-good with ~/.config/chromium (the latter folder should reflect AFTER two times have been executed and flash no longer works)
2009-08-28T14:39:00.000Z	xtknight	takeshi-	now i dont know if that's the problem folder, and when you say reinstall, it might even be the system files that are changing, not the ~/.config/chromium folder.  that's probably true if when you uninstall the package you don't use purge..
2009-08-28T14:39:00.000Z	takeshi-	xtknight	ok
