2008-11-11T14:21:00.000Z	jsurfer		how can I create a new alias for a script and have it receive the additinal parameters?
2008-11-11T14:22:00.000Z	jsurfer		i want to create an alias for php...
2008-11-11T14:22:00.000Z	jsurfer		when I run php, I woudl have php -c /path/to/new/php.ini
2008-11-11T14:24:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	edit your ~/.bashrc and add: alias php="php -c ...."
2008-11-11T14:33:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	prper use of quotes is important, alias php="php -c /home/group8/shortcuts "
2008-11-11T14:37:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	the alias is just a shell shothand notation; it only applies to things run directly from the shell
2008-11-11T14:37:00.000Z	jsurfer	[mbm]	ops... my bad... :(
2008-11-11T14:37:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	another trick would be to create a small shell script called "php" and set the $PATH variable so it finds your script before the real php
2008-11-11T14:39:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	yes, use $* for the arguments
2008-11-11T14:43:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	usually looks like: export PATH=/home/jsurfer/bin:$PATH
2008-11-11T14:44:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	make sure that when you run php from the script that you type the full path so you don't end up executing the script over and over
2008-11-11T14:44:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	the first directory in PATH has preference
2008-11-11T14:48:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	told you to use the full path so you didn't execute your script repeatedly
2008-11-11T14:49:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	your script is called php, your script then runs php, which according to $PATH is the same script ...
2008-11-11T15:05:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	keep in mind that when an executable file has a header like "#!/usr/bin/php" that's actually a command to execute /usr/bin/php
2008-11-11T15:07:00.000Z	jsurfer	[mbm]	that's what I'm tryign to overcome right nwo
2008-11-11T15:07:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	so it does have that header?
2008-11-11T15:09:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	ok, that is known as an interpreter; it tells the kernel how to execute the file, which in this case means "run /ur/bin/php and give it the filename" .. since you can't change the header, the only thing you can do is eecute php yourself and pass it in the filename of the executable
2008-11-11T15:09:00.000Z	[mbm]	jsurfer	(or make your own copy of the script with a different header)
