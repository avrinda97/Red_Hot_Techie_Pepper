2007-01-24T16:50:00.000Z	Ha1		I want it to be called linstore, EnsignRedShirt
2007-01-24T16:51:00.000Z	Ha1		EnsignRedShirt, do you suggest that?
2007-01-24T16:53:00.000Z	Ha1		EnsignRedShirt, I actually like the idea of /home/halhorn/linstore
2007-01-24T16:53:00.000Z	Ha1		[My username is halhorn, that being my name and all] 
2007-01-24T16:55:00.000Z	Ha1		yes
2007-01-24T16:55:00.000Z	Ha1		Thats affirmative, EnsignRedShirt, with regards to the Linux lingo comment
2007-01-24T16:56:00.000Z	Ha1		Done. In my file manager/nautilus window it has a big padlock on it, too, EnsignRedShirt
2007-01-24T16:57:00.000Z	Ha1		Wait a sec
2007-01-24T16:57:00.000Z	Ha1		The linstore folder, EnsignRedShirt. I typed sudo mkdir, not mkdir,, by mistake or instinct. Whats the opposite of mkdir?
2007-01-24T16:58:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	rmdir :D
2007-01-25T17:03:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	yes
2007-01-25T17:03:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	no worries...    umount /home/halhorn
2007-01-25T17:25:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	mounting?  give me the command you used
2007-01-25T17:26:00.000Z	Ha1	AWOSDev7360	I used sudo mount /dev/hdc3 /home/halhorn/linstore
2007-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	Ha1	AWOSDev7360	I wouldve done it sans the sudo, but if I I do it says Only root can do that
2007-01-25T17:29:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	try sudo mount /dev/hdc3 /home/halhorn/linstore
2007-01-25T17:29:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	sorry
2007-01-25T17:31:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	Ha1	try sudo mount /dev/hdc3 /home/halhorn/linstore -o umask=022
