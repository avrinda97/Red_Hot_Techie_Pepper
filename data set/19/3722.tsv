2010-11-07T08:30:00.000Z	R1cochet		i was thinking about getting a new wireless adapter and was wondering if there are restrictions on which ones will work with ubuntu
2010-11-07T08:31:00.000Z	R1cochet		where would i find this list of supported chipsets?
2010-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	R1cochet		is a pci/pcie card any better than a usb adapter?
2010-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	It's much easier to configure in Ubuntu.  It makes you look less like a noob.
2011-06-19T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	devede
2011-06-19T06:50:00.000Z	R1cochet	edbian	besides devede. i already have it but its not doing what i want
2011-06-19T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	It does exactly what you asked for?
2011-06-19T06:51:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	It produces an ISO that you can burn.
2011-06-19T06:51:00.000Z	R1cochet	edbian	the menu it makes is simply a background picture. i want a menu with episode listings
2011-06-19T06:52:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	It puts each title it's own menu itme
2011-06-19T06:52:00.000Z	R1cochet	edbian	not for me it didnt
2011-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	I'm using an older version (Debian) perhaps it's changed.  Sorry if I wasted your time! :(
2011-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	R1cochet	edbian	no you have not. i just realized i think i messed up when making the disc
2011-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	oh good :)
2011-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	Don't do that.
2011-06-19T06:57:00.000Z	R1cochet	edbian	you know if you can change position of the menu text. not the title text. that i can move but i want to change location of heading
2011-06-19T06:57:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	I don't think it lets you.  Sadly :(
2011-06-19T06:58:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	It is limited
2011-06-19T06:58:00.000Z	edbian	R1cochet	yeah
