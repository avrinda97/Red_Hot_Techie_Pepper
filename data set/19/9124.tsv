2008-04-30T04:55:00.000Z	Moc		Im very disapointed at 8.04 release, it been hell for me all the way (ok well not hell, but close to it)
2008-04-30T04:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	i think its awesome, no probs here... one on pc i just built, 1 on an old pc, and 1 on a fairly new laptop
2008-04-30T04:58:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	It was very anoying to get it running in dual head on my desktop (nvidia) new xorg screen res configurator is useless.  Language switch shortcut was remove/replaced . Now try to upgrade my Dell Desktop to get a blackscren at reboot, tryed to boot the install Cd and same result.  New VNC clients suck, can't access ubuntu 7.10 default vnc server, had to install console vnc clients...
2008-04-30T05:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	what nvidia card do you have? my dual screens work fine
2008-04-30T05:00:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	I finally got it to work, Nvidi 8600 GT.  Had to install nvidia drivers (from the repo)(first time I try to load it, it say it was already installed but not running)
2008-04-30T05:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	well, all you would have to do was enable in hardware driver manager, then install nvidia-settings, and thats it.
2008-04-30T05:02:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	normally yes, problem is on my first install, it show the drivers as already installed..
2008-04-30T05:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	but were they enabled?
2008-04-30T05:03:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	it was installed, Enable but `Not in Use`
2008-04-30T05:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	ok..
2008-04-30T05:04:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	It probably a bug that when the install has NOT sync with the repository atless one, it show bad informations
2008-04-30T05:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	its not a bug
2008-04-30T05:05:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	well, saying that it installed and enable when it not installed... I call that a BUG
2008-04-30T05:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	well, you would be misidentifying it.
2008-04-30T05:07:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	Im a linux fan, but I know when to admit when it suck... and 8.04 ain't great in my experience so far
2008-04-30T05:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	well, you can't blame the OS for user incompetence.. thats all i'll say on it.
2008-04-30T05:09:00.000Z	Moc	IndyGunFreak	hey kid, read back what I said before... OS tell USER it installed and enable. USER stupid to think the OS is right ?
2008-04-30T05:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	hey kid, read back what i said
2008-04-30T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Moc	if you don't like my answers, you're the one who's continued this conversation
