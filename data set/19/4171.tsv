2009-03-15T05:26:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	works in Ubuntu, unlike in Debian
2009-03-15T05:26:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	certainly not with the alternate images
2009-03-15T05:27:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	ah, that's why! there's a trick, you can mount the usb yourself and fiddle with things
2009-03-15T05:27:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	but it's because whoever wrote the Debian thing didn't really think that anyone would use alternate media
2009-03-15T05:28:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	fiddle with things in unetbootin or in the installer?
2009-03-15T05:28:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	well, in the installer or while installing. I just did it while installing
2009-03-15T05:29:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	I tried different things, but obviously not the right thing. How to I get the damn installer to believe there is a CDrom
2009-03-15T05:30:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	I recall there being a special bootinstall where you placed an ISO on the USB disk and used it that way
2009-03-15T05:31:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	Some script put all the files from my CD on the USB disk, and I have another USB pen, which holds the iso image. Just mounting it to /cdrom does not do the trick.

2009-03-15T05:32:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	but a debian installer will not help me much
2009-03-15T05:32:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	I thought the debian iso was pretty much equivalent to the Ubuntu extended installer iso
2009-03-15T05:33:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	still, it will use other repositories.
2009-03-15T05:33:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	you can choose repos can't you?
2009-03-15T05:34:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	yes, sure
2009-03-15T05:34:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	thats if you want a netinstall, if you don't, then it might be possible to swap out the ISO with a Ubuntu ISO
2009-03-15T05:40:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	do you know if the kernel really matters in the installer?
2009-03-15T05:41:00.000Z	humbolt	arkady	kernel does not matter
2009-03-15T05:42:00.000Z	arkady	humbolt	yeah. there's actually a trickier and less Linux dependent way of making flash LiveUSBs from LiveCDs
