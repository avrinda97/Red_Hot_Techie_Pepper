2007-02-18T17:35:00.000Z	jumbers		My swap partition is broken. It's listing it as filesystem "unknown". Is it safe to reformat it to linux-swap while I'm still in Gnome?
2007-02-18T17:36:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	what says unknown?
2007-02-18T17:36:00.000Z	jumbers	Muzik83	In Gparted, it says the filesystem is unknown
2007-02-18T17:37:00.000Z	jumbers	Muzik83	I also get boottime errors about my swap
2007-02-18T17:37:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	can you do a cat /proc/meminfo and put it on pastebin
2007-02-18T17:39:00.000Z	jumbers	Muzik83	Putting it in my pastebin, but I just looked and it says I have 0 swap and 0 swap free
2007-02-18T17:39:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	ok thats what i wanted to know, dont bother with the pastebin
2007-02-18T17:40:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	ok do the following: mkswap /dev/yourswappart
2007-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	then swapon /dev/yourswappart
2007-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	jumbers	Muzik83	Done
2007-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	both?  What does meminfo say now?
2007-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	jumbers		SwapTotal:     1622524 kB
2007-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	jumbers		SwapFree:      1602936 kB
2007-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	awesome, you have swap for now...now make sure it happens next time you restart
2007-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	look for the line like: /dev/sda2       none            swap    sw              0       0
2007-02-18T17:43:00.000Z	jumbers	Muzik83	Yeah, it's there. That's why I was getting boottime errors about swap issues
2007-02-18T17:43:00.000Z	Muzik83	jumbers	ok :)
2007-02-18T17:43:00.000Z	jumbers	Muzik83	Thank you :)
