2007-01-16T13:33:00.000Z	threeonefour	zammit	thats interesting considering that dvd movies are dvd +
2007-01-16T13:34:00.000Z	zammit	threeonefour	i've installed libdvdread3 and libdvdcss2 (if i remember the packages correctly)
2007-01-16T13:34:00.000Z	threeonefour	zammit	it just won't mount the drive
2007-01-16T13:35:00.000Z	zammit	threeonefour	it won't mount the drive when the dvd (super troopers) is in there, but when i place in some of my dvd backups and such, i have no problems
2007-01-16T13:36:00.000Z	threeonefour	zammit	what version of ubuntu

2007-01-16T13:42:00.000Z	zammit	threeonefour	hmm maybe i need to set my region? i haven't done that yet - never had to tho?
2007-01-16T13:44:00.000Z	threeonefour	zammit	you can try it   but just don't change it too mayn times  no more then 4 times  if you do the last regin u had it set to is permenant   until u get a new drive
2007-01-16T13:57:00.000Z	zammit	threeonefour	looks like my region code is set to 1 - north america, so that's okay.
2007-01-16T13:57:00.000Z	threeonefour	zammit	i thinks its the dvd it's self
2007-01-16T14:03:00.000Z	zammit	threeonefour	well %$## office space works - i'm sad, super troopers doesn't - what sense does that make?
