2007-03-15T08:05:00.000Z	billy	wtigerguy	 do you have the universe and multiverse repositories enabled in Synaptic Package Manager?
2007-03-15T08:06:00.000Z	billy	wtigerguy	 no worries.  In the top panel, click on System, then Administration, then Synaptic Package Manager.  Let me know when you have it opened.
2007-03-15T08:08:00.000Z	billy	wtigerguy	 be sure to prefix responses with my name, billy.  Click on "Settings", then "Repositories."
2007-03-15T08:09:00.000Z	billy	wtigerguy	 be sure that all of the repositories have a check mark beside them.
2007-03-15T08:11:00.000Z	billy	wtigerguy	 OK.  Close Synaptic and open a terminal.  Applications > Accessories > Terminal
2007-03-15T08:13:00.000Z	billy	wtigerguy	 copy/paste this into the terminal `sudo wget http://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss2.9-1_i386.deb`.
