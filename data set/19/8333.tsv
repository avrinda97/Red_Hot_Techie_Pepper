2007-04-13T12:08:00.000Z	Juanca		hi everyone. Can anybody help me, I want to know if can reinstall ubuntu without losing my files and the packages I've already installed?
2007-04-13T12:08:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	easily for the files
2007-04-13T12:08:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	harder for the packages.
2007-04-13T12:09:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	just copy the /home directory, and maybe /var and /etc to a disk
2007-04-13T12:10:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	/home probably would do it, but global configurations are in /etc, and some things (nethack) save stuff in /var
2007-04-13T12:10:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	That's good to know. I have /home in  a partition
2007-04-13T12:11:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	smart move. Just remember to not format /home during the reinstall
2007-04-13T12:12:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	Great, but could I be 100% sure I won't lose anything?
2007-04-13T12:14:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	 can I be 100% sure I won't lose anything?
2007-04-13T12:16:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	well, if you have disks, you could back up everything.
2007-04-13T12:17:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	that's what I don't want to do for a second time, and lose my configuration and installed programs too
2007-04-13T12:18:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	this is becoming a nigthmare, but I'm still in love with Ubuntu
2007-04-13T12:21:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	well, I'd think that the /home stuff, you don't need to back up if you're careful when reinstalling
2007-04-13T12:21:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	why are you reinstalling, if I might ask?
2007-04-13T12:24:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	because I'm having problems with the configuration of video, a couple of repositories with problems, and now I have problems trying to follow this HowTo (sorry it's in Spanish): http://elmodem.wordpress.com/2006/11/09/como-compilar-el-kernel-de-kubuntu/
2007-04-13T12:26:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Juanca	argh...I left Spanish in senior year...Well, the big problem is, it's your programs that are causing the problems, so saving all your programs would give you another system with the same problems
2007-04-13T12:27:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	how could I know
2007-04-13T12:28:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	I'm losing too much time trying to get help and solve the problems
2007-04-13T12:31:00.000Z	Juanca	kitsuneofdoom	thank you anyway, I'm leaving now
