2005-10-31T11:42:00.000Z	kevogod		bur[n] er, You're such a nonconformist.
2005-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	kevogod		I use ReiserFS on all of my partitions. Yea, that's right.

2005-10-31T11:46:00.000Z	kevogod		Anyone know where I can get gnatmake for Ubuntu?
2005-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	kevogod		bur[n] er, It plays Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.
2005-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	kevogod		bur[n] er, I bet it will play Warcraft 2.
2005-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	kevogod		bur[n] er, Wine runs it quite well.
2005-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	Bite_Me_Bill	kevogod	have you ran into many apps that won't work in wine?
2005-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	kevogod		bur[n] er, You must use the -opengl switch
2005-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	kevogod		bur[n] er, Or your 3D acceleration is not working
2005-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	kevogod	Bite_Me_Bill	Sure, there are a few apps that fail to work.
2005-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	kevogod		I have an ATI X300

2005-10-31T11:51:00.000Z	Bite_Me_Bill	kevogod	Ok just wanted to make sure it wasn't just me.  Almost got the township to change away from MS but one app that is needed I couldn't get to run in wine. :(
2005-10-31T11:51:00.000Z	kevogod	Bite_Me_Bill	Have you tried the 0.9 version?
