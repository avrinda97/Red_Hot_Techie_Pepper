2007-06-06T09:28:00.000Z	neverblue		ok, so anyone know the answer, teamwork seems to have left, do I have to shut X down to purge/reinstall ubuntu-desktop ?
2007-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue		ppl take the time to write up a tutorial on how to do what you want
2007-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue		its upto you to decide to check out the links to see

2007-06-06T09:30:00.000Z	stefg	neverblue	no... any way reinstalling ubuntu-desktop will only draw eventually missing apps. what do you expect it to do?
2007-06-21T12:09:00.000Z	stefg	neverblue	this could be related to the nwly adopted ubuntu habit of mounting by UUID
2007-06-21T12:09:00.000Z	neverblue	stefg	oh?
2007-06-21T12:11:00.000Z	neverblue	stefg	is it best to troubleshoot from my own system, or put the HD back in, boot with a Live CD?
2007-06-21T12:12:00.000Z	stefg	neverblue	best bet would be to leave it as it is, boot the Desktop CD and evaluate the situation from there.
