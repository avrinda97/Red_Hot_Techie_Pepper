2011-04-06T07:14:00.000Z	Bite		is there a specific reason as to why i can't do any administrator taskes?
2011-04-06T07:15:00.000Z	Bite		or why my login screen is glitched?
2011-04-06T07:15:00.000Z	Bite		not even sudo, just some error that's not letting me do any auth for GUI admin tasks, Logan_.
2011-04-06T07:17:00.000Z	Bite		Why is my administrative password wrong?
2011-04-06T07:17:00.000Z	Bite		Though I can login with it, i can't authorize tasks.
2011-04-06T07:18:00.000Z	Bite		Could there be an issue with linux itself?
2011-04-06T07:18:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	Unlikely
2011-04-06T07:18:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	How many users are there on your machine?
2011-04-06T07:18:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	sudo su
2011-04-06T07:19:00.000Z	Bite	askhader	What does it do and why? I don't think it'd change a think.
2011-04-06T07:20:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	The password for super user access would be the same as the password you use to authenticate
2011-04-06T07:20:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	Define broken.
2011-04-06T07:21:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	That matters little. What we want to do is get to the bottom of your issues.
2011-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	invoke it from an authenticated terminal?
2011-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	sudo su && name-of-manager
2011-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	Bite	askhader	that worked.
2011-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	No kidding
2011-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	I don't care much for GUI's anyway
2011-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	askhader	Bite	Consider yourself lucky.
