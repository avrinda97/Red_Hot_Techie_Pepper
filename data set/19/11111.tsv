2007-08-06T16:49:00.000Z	alesan		if I change the gnome settings with gconf-editor I only change for the current user
2007-08-06T16:49:00.000Z	alesan		how can I change globally?
2007-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	alesan		hi. normally there is an icon to enable/disable networking which is available to all users even to the ones that have no admini rights
2007-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	alesan		admin
2007-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	alesan		isn't it possible to show such network menu only to the ones that have admin rights?
2007-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	remove the user from the admin group, then they can't do anything to change the network settings.
2007-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	no, but a user without admin right can still disable networking
2007-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	how?
2007-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	clicking on the "enable networking"
2007-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	you cannot enable networking unless you have admin rights.
2007-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	come on try: login with a non admin user and there you can *disable* networking and/or wireless
2007-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	I'll take your word for it.
2007-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	you cannot change settings but enable/disable
2007-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	any idea how to disable that?
2007-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	I'm sure the ubuntu in the workplace wiki tells you these things.
2007-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	you mean wiki.ubuntu.com ?
2007-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	yes, there is something there talks about ubuntu in the workplace, and controlling settings, etc.
2007-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	alesan	I found it searching for something else.
2007-08-09T08:12:00.000Z	alesan	fyrestrtr	I am developing a kernel driver for my device :) still, I don't get a "build" directory after having installed the header files.
