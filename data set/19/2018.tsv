2010-07-28T10:14:00.000Z	alphagas		anybody up?
2010-07-28T10:16:00.000Z	alphagas		I am having trouble installing ubuntu :-/  I get a soft-lockup during install.  I've tried about a dozen workarounds and none have produced any results.  I'm using a toshiba A355-S6935
2010-07-28T10:16:00.000Z	alphagas		can someone please help, i've been trying to get this to work for about a week now
2010-07-28T10:17:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	check your hardware and make sure it's compatible, I had an old sony that had similiar issues and it tied back to some proprietary hardware that wasn't compatible
2010-07-28T10:20:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	does the system lock up after install or during?
2010-07-28T10:21:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	does it let you go through the process and lock while copying files or does it lock early on?
2010-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	can you give me the exact text of the error message?
2010-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	alphagas	illac	are you still here?
2010-07-28T10:29:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	yea
2010-07-28T10:31:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	hmmm
2010-07-28T10:32:00.000Z	alphagas	illac	I have seen many threads and posts about having this problem on toshiba laptops and some workarounds but none of them work for me
2010-07-28T10:32:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	give me a few minutes to dig around and see what I can turn up

2010-07-28T10:37:00.000Z	alphagas	illac	well, I'm not trying to install the netbook version :-/ and I'm installing off of a CD
2010-07-28T10:38:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	hmmm k, I shall keep digging
2010-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	illac	alphagas	I'm not sure man, that's a slippery one
