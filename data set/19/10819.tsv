2010-06-18T00:40:00.000Z	aj149		I am having a problem connecting to the internet in Ubuntu server 10.04 no matter what I do I can't even ping the router any suggestions
2010-06-18T00:41:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	first thing is check your get a valid IP address from your router
2010-06-18T00:42:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	ok - so is the ip address still valid with the routers network ?
2010-06-18T00:43:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	what's your IP, and what's the routers ?
2010-06-18T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	so how are you pinging it if you don't know what the routers IP address is
2010-06-18T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	why if you don't know if that's the ip address ?
2010-06-18T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	you need to find your routers IP address first of all, so you know there is a valid IP address to test with
2010-06-18T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	you also need to make sure there is no firewall running/blocking you on the router
2010-06-18T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	ok so you need to make sure the interface is up, as it's on the same network as your router the gateway won't matter
2010-06-18T00:54:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	forget the internet - ping the router
2010-06-18T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	ok - so either your network interface is not up, or your cable is broke, or your router is not responding
2010-06-18T01:07:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	what version of ubuntu is this ?
2010-06-18T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	how do you know eth0 is running
2010-06-18T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	that doesn't mean it's up
2010-06-18T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	what does ethtool eth0 show ?
2010-06-18T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	that doesn't mean anything
2010-06-18T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	what command did you run exactly
2010-06-18T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	sudo mii-tools eth0
2010-06-18T01:07:00.000Z	ikonia	aj149	there is something very wrong with your system
