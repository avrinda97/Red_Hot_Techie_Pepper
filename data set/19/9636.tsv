2006-11-01T10:18:00.000Z	ianmacgregor		I have some .mpeg's of a friends wedding. Is it possible to take these and make something that will play on a stand-alone DVD player? If so, which app(s) should I look into?
2006-11-01T10:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	some players will play that already...
2006-11-01T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	otherwise you can convert to DVD format
2006-11-01T10:20:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	Xenguy	Mine won't :(
2006-11-01T10:20:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	Xenguy	How would I do that?
2006-11-01T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	dvdauthor will convert from mpg to dvd
2006-11-01T10:20:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	Xenguy	Thank you
2006-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	I can give you some command-line if you want (that's all I have)
2006-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	Xenguy	Can you pastebin the cli stuff?
2006-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	ok, hang on
2006-11-01T10:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	/join flood
2006-11-01T10:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	talk to me
2006-11-01T10:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	if you weren't a macgregor, I wouldn't wait this long =)
2006-11-01T10:27:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	Xenguy	I"m looking into #flood. Sorry, but I have joined a channel before that auto-Klined me before and don't want to do that again. I'm a cautious person.
2006-11-01T10:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	flood is quite safe
2006-11-01T10:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	it's for flooding :-)
2006-11-01T10:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	besides, that's pretty tame behaviour for a scot, isn't it? :-)
2006-11-01T10:30:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	Xenguy	Well, she's changed her mind now. But, thank you for the willingness to help with this.
2006-11-01T10:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	ianmacgregor	anytime :p
