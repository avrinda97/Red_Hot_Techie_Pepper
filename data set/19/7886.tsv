2008-08-13T17:57:00.000Z	tonisius		what if my windows drive fails, how will I recover THAT data, it's more important
2008-08-13T17:58:00.000Z	tonisius		I'm trying to recreate the grub, and it's refusing to use the /boot/ in my /dev/sdc1 partition
2008-08-13T17:58:00.000Z	tonisius		saying the partition doesn't exist,
2008-08-13T17:58:00.000Z	tonisius		root (hd2,0)  then setup (hd0)
2008-08-13T17:59:00.000Z	tonisius		just says unable to mount partition error 17
2008-08-13T17:59:00.000Z	tonisius		urgh
2008-08-13T17:59:00.000Z	tonisius		and it doesn't show the parition type when I try and tab through the different partitions
2008-08-13T17:59:00.000Z	tonisius		it says type 0x6 where the ext3 type should be
2008-08-13T17:59:00.000Z	tonisius		any other ideas?
2008-08-13T18:01:00.000Z	tonisius		argh, I need to shoot my desktop
2008-08-13T18:03:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tonisius	how come? whats the matter with it?
2008-08-13T18:06:00.000Z	tonisius	Pirate_Hunter	issue with reinstalling grub today
2008-08-13T18:06:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tonisius	oh :(
2008-08-13T18:06:00.000Z	tonisius	Pirate_Hunter	I can mount the partition that I have my boot files in, but grub doesn't see it at all, it see;s an unknown partition type
2008-08-13T18:07:00.000Z	tonisius		using all the different tutorials, online don't help either
2008-08-13T18:08:00.000Z	tonisius		http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2007/06/27/restore-grub/ <-- this being the most universal one I've found
2008-08-13T18:08:00.000Z	tonisius		the find command doesn't find anything
2008-08-13T18:08:00.000Z	tonisius		even if I can find it in the /dev/sdc1 partition myself when I mount it to someplace
2008-08-13T18:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tonisius	what file format is the partition giving you trouble, try unounting it and adding it to fstab or you could recreate the file?
