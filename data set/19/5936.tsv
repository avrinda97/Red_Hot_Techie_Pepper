2008-04-14T01:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	You used automatix...  that is the start of your troubles
2008-04-14T01:07:00.000Z	draginxx	Jack_Sparrow	apt-get install automatix?
2008-04-14T01:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	No...  automatix is a bad bad thing you did
2008-04-14T01:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	we have been telling people not to use or try it fro way longer than that
2008-04-14T01:09:00.000Z	draginxx	Jack_Sparrow	I installed itlike..my frirst week :p
2008-04-14T01:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	If it was something easy to fix or that we could do for you we would not have been so dead set against it.  Once you add repos you screw up your revisions and everything gets messed up giving you the problem you have now trying to upgrade that file
2008-04-14T01:11:00.000Z	draginxx	Jack_Sparrow	....so reformat? :P
2008-04-14T01:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	wait two weeks and get hardy...  or setup hardy as dual boot
2008-04-14T01:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	you can remove the non-std repos, and apt-get update and try again.. but it seldom works
2008-06-11T00:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	unmount or just not show on the desktop
2008-06-11T00:10:00.000Z	draginxx	Jack_Sparrow	how do I unmount? :S
2008-06-11T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	draginxx	man umount
2008-06-11T00:11:00.000Z	draginxx	Jack_Sparrow	how do I see a list of everything that is mounted? :|
