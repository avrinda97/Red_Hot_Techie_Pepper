2005-01-13T09:19:00.000Z	jivera		And why don't you think you should need to be root to shut down?
2005-01-13T09:19:00.000Z	jivera		Also, it should only ask for it if you haven't entered it in the past 5 minutes.
2005-01-13T09:20:00.000Z	jivera		If you don't like it, use 'sudo -s' to get a root shell.
2005-01-13T09:22:00.000Z	jivera		You sudo-haters are all so winey.
2005-01-13T09:22:00.000Z	jivera		'alias su="sudo -s"'
2005-01-13T09:22:00.000Z	jivera		That's different, java really does suck. ;)
2005-01-13T09:23:00.000Z	jivera		Yeah, that's bogus.
2005-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	jivera		I would like to see Ubuntu with packages to more easily install java, flash, etc. (like I think I heard SuSE did once), but I'd still like emphasis to be put on F/OSS alternatives.
2005-01-13T09:26:00.000Z	drspin	jivera	the problem is not Ubuntu or Linux in general -- the views about software, from the Governement's perspective, suck ass --
2005-01-13T09:27:00.000Z	jivera	drspin	Huh?
2005-01-13T09:28:00.000Z	drspin	jivera	I'm referring to your interest in seeing ... java, mp3, divX... more easially installed..
2005-01-13T09:28:00.000Z	jivera	drspin	I didn't say anything about mp3 or divx.
2005-01-13T10:26:00.000Z	jivera	drspin	/usr/share/keymaps
2005-01-13T10:28:00.000Z	jivera	drspin	I told you.
2005-01-13T10:28:00.000Z	drspin	jivera	I see it now ;)
2005-01-13T10:53:00.000Z	jivera	drspin	What makes you think it's looking for a system wide file rather than a 'theguild' specific file?
2005-01-13T10:54:00.000Z	drspin	jivera	the make install script for this game sucks ;)
2005-01-13T10:54:00.000Z	jivera	drspin	That's not really something anyone here can help you with, unfortunately.
2005-01-13T10:55:00.000Z	drspin	jivera	yes, it is a guild specific file - and it's the 5th one I had to copy just to make it work :/
