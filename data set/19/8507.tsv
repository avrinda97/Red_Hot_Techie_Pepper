2007-03-23T10:33:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	hi
2007-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	what should I use to edit a simple asf file, I just need to trim ten minutes of the end off.
2007-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	both kino and avidemux should do it
2007-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	I'll just get cinerella if that doesn't work
2007-03-23T10:50:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	can't edit/import avi's in either app you mentioned
2007-03-23T10:50:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	sorry, meant to say asf's, not avi's
2007-03-23T10:50:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	really?? do you have the codecs for it....maybe I was mistaken
2007-03-23T10:51:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	sorry, my bad then
2007-03-23T10:51:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	I don't edit those files often. I always convert them anyway
2007-03-23T10:55:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	fine, how can I transcode them into an importable file?
2007-03-23T10:57:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	hang on I'll find something for you
2007-03-23T10:58:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	thanks, doing a project for school right now
2007-03-23T11:04:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11689/ that should convert it to mpeg
2007-03-23T11:24:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	didn't really work for me, found convert-video nautilus script
2007-03-23T11:25:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	works awesome, uses ffmpeg zenity mencoder and you can right click on files in nautilus and get a little convert menu item
2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	clearzen	ravi_master	Sorry I couldn't be more help. you should send me that script though
2007-03-23T11:30:00.000Z	ravi_master	clearzen	here it is: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=62625&highlight=video-convert
