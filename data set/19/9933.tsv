2006-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	Sembiance		Hi Ubuntu peopls!
2006-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	Sembiance		err peoples rofl
2006-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	Sembiance		I'm a developer, and I've been using Linux for years, but always as a server. I'm ready now to change my workstation to a Linux machine now and will be doing things like writing code, listening to music, watching videos, etc. I've tried Gentoo in the past but I hate how long it takes to compile things and how you have to work so hard to get your hardware to work.
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	Sembiance		So I'm looking at ubuntu to ease the 'make my hardware work' pain
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	Sembiance		However I'm worried that ubuntu might be too easy? By that I mean, will I be able to download the latest source code for things like PHP and what not and isntall them?
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	Sembiance		How do source installed packages conflict with ubuntu?
2006-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	ubuntu is fine.... it is easy yes. but unlike fedora and other projects ubuntu allows you to have real fun with the system ;)
2006-09-19T07:01:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	i run ubuntu... at my amtes place
2006-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	could uninstall using apt-get first if its a worry
2006-09-19T07:03:00.000Z	Sembiance	Deaigo	When I've done stuff like that in the past with redhat or gentoo the dependencies are usually a real pain
2006-09-19T07:03:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	tell me about it
2006-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	well it only had libtorrent 8.2 :/
2006-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	gentoo users have switched to ubuntu(and this was before the GUI installer)_
2006-09-19T07:06:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	use the alternative install disc
2006-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	hmmm not sure but it should... but there are toutorials in the forums on how to do nvidia drivers
2006-09-19T07:08:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	you could always just settle for debian ;)
2006-09-19T07:09:00.000Z	Sembiance	Deaigo	Flannel, kitche, chuckyp: Thank you all for your help, I really appreciate it :)
2006-09-19T07:10:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	ah well tell us what OS you end up with
2006-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	Deaigo	Sembiance	gnome
