2007-01-20T11:47:00.000Z	surgy		how do you set a program to be the defualt program associated with a particular extension, for example i want VLC player to be associated with every divx and avi file
2007-01-20T11:47:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	default from what program> firefos? file manager?
2007-01-20T11:48:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	well i want it so that instead of opening kafeine when i open a movie to open vlc
2007-01-20T11:49:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	open from what program?
2007-01-20T11:49:00.000Z	surgy		VLC
2007-01-20T11:50:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	not "to" what program, "from" what program
2007-01-20T11:50:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	curently the defualt program set is kafeine, i wish to change that to make VLC player my defualt application for opening divx and avi
2007-01-20T11:51:00.000Z	surgy		judicata that just opens it ounce with the selected application that does not set it as defualt
2007-01-20T11:51:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	is this from within firefox or from your desktop?
2007-01-20T11:51:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	has nothing to do with firefox
2007-01-20T11:51:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	or is this from within the filemanager?
2007-01-20T11:52:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	filemanager i supose or desktop,
2007-01-20T11:52:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	which one
2007-01-20T11:53:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	your not making sense to me, the file is in both my desktop and my filemanager sense my desktop is in my filemanager, i want my media player which happens to be vlc media player to be the defualt application that opens divx and avi
2007-01-20T11:54:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	the desktop is not always the file manager.
2007-01-20T11:54:00.000Z	bronze_0_1		so we will assume desktop
2007-01-20T11:54:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	nevermind thanks for trying, i figured it out
2007-01-20T11:55:00.000Z	surgy	bronze_0_1	its under file associations in settings
2007-01-20T11:55:00.000Z	bronze_0_1	surgy	find the settings menu for your desktop and then find the "file associations" setting in there. thats where you need to set the program which will open the designated extension.
