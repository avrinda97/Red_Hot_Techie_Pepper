2007-09-04T10:10:00.000Z	danielmarsom		help, i just bought a nvidia fx5200 128mb, it lags so badly with cedega, even while playing vice city
2007-09-04T10:11:00.000Z	danielmarsom		it should work with vice city
2007-09-04T10:11:00.000Z	danielmarsom		a 64mb plays vice city real smooth
2007-09-04T10:11:00.000Z	danielmarsom		and 1. im 13, and 2. im broke
2007-09-04T10:11:00.000Z	danielmarsom		so any help?
2007-09-04T10:12:00.000Z	danielmarsom		!nvidia
2007-09-04T10:13:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	yeah, you installed the nvidia proprietary drivers, right?
2007-09-04T10:13:00.000Z	danielmarsom	Daverocks	yep
2007-09-04T10:15:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	it's not a general slowness issue, like glxgears runs fine?
2007-09-04T10:15:00.000Z	danielmarsom	Daverocks	glxgears runs very nice
2007-09-04T10:16:00.000Z	danielmarsom	Daverocks	6658 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1331.532 FPS
2007-09-04T10:16:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	problem is the dodgy d3d-to-opengl translation of cedega and wine
2007-09-04T10:17:00.000Z	danielmarsom	Daverocks	so there's nothing i can do about it
2007-09-04T10:17:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	no, i'm not saying that is THE problem
2007-09-04T10:17:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	just it's an annoying thing that complicates matters :P
2007-09-04T10:17:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	not sure why changing cards caused that, there's probably a solution
2007-09-04T10:19:00.000Z	danielmarsom	Daverocks	yep, any idea what i could do? ive tried the nvidia-glx pkg, that did not work, and now im on nvidia's latest driver
2007-09-04T10:19:00.000Z	Daverocks	danielmarsom	have you tried using wine instead to run vice city?
2007-09-04T10:20:00.000Z	danielmarsom	Daverocks	no, will try that now
