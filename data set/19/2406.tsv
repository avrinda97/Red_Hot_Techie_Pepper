2010-05-03T18:37:00.000Z	kiwi4boy	gmatt	 Lucid works well on my lap - even when it was in beta...  The entire computer froze down when I "mistakenly" delete *everything* in my HD, including the recovery crap in it.
2010-05-03T18:37:00.000Z	gmatt	kiwi4boy	you are lucky then...i'd love to upgrade, but know it will freeze up so i won't waste my time...
2010-05-03T18:38:00.000Z	kiwi4boy	gmatt	 Did you know what made it freeze?  (i.e. anything tracing effort such as dtrace, etc.?)
2010-05-03T18:39:00.000Z	gmatt	kiwi4boy	i simply did an install, and a few moments later, after copying my files to the correct folders from my external, all of my windows froze.  mouse still moves, but nothing works...it's like everything is as a background wallpaper...but it's not
2010-05-03T18:40:00.000Z	kiwi4boy	gmatt	 I don't know...  Did you check with your video card drivers?  i.e. swapping between proprietary and open-source drivers, etc.
2010-05-03T18:41:00.000Z	gmatt	kiwi4boy	hadn't put any video drivers on, nothing extra added, just the install of 10.04
2010-05-03T18:41:00.000Z	kiwi4boy	gmatt	 Lucid *does*  screw around with their video drivers as their "new" "features", unfortunately.
2010-05-03T18:41:00.000Z	gmatt	kiwi4boy	are you running 10.04 now?
2010-05-03T18:42:00.000Z	kiwi4boy	gmatt	 My laptop can't even get past the CMOS right now, but the trigger wasn't Ubuntu-related.
2010-05-03T18:43:00.000Z	gmatt	kiwi4boy	keep me posted.  going to try a new install of it, see if i can't pinpoint something.  thinking the core i7 might be the issue...read some forum about that
2010-05-03T18:43:00.000Z	kiwi4boy	gmatt	 It might be, although we are having totally different laptop specs as well.
