2011-02-14T10:56:00.000Z	tripelb		I need help re NNTP: I have not used that since chi.general and chi.eats and rumour.politics and comp.os.apple.whatever .... I'm looking for the Daily Show. How do I find this given THIS following info:  It's available on the NNTP network still. Leechr and hellanzb are your friends. No need to 'bother' with torrents. It just shows up in your output directory.
2011-02-14T10:57:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	sqlite is a great way to start.  postgresql after that.
2011-02-14T10:59:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	can we talk about it. I have some past experience. What: I did some rbase programming in the wayback. took a (not good) dreamweaver class. student taught datastructures in not-that-far wayback to ICS majors.
2011-02-14T11:00:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	pick up a reasonable sql book. I like _SQL for Smarties_
2011-02-14T11:00:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	I'd like some more generalized background about datastructures and the way that they are handled, some problems to help me think it through or something to program. (I'm in a Ub10.04 environment
2011-02-14T11:01:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	relational database work is a bit of a differet way to think than say a CS 202 class on datastructures.
2011-02-14T11:04:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	sorry if I'm slow but I'm copying your responses. Tell me what you mean (and it was a class like 103 (first year of ICS 3rd quarter) not an upperdivision class.)
2011-02-14T11:05:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	you understand datastructures like linked lists and binary trees and such?
2011-02-14T11:06:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	yes
2011-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	a relational database like sqlite, mysql, postgres and the rest make use of low level datastructures to represent a collection of tables of data.
2011-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	datastructures and filestructures both.
2011-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	well yes
2011-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	yes "relational" rather than flat would have a structure of referring to specific files (trying to avoid the words linking and related)
2011-02-14T11:09:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	this is not realy the format for it but I can point you to a couple reasonable online tutorials on relational databases
2011-02-14T11:11:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	records, lists of records and related files.  --- Sure. re the pointer from you to tutorials. thumbs up on that --- but what I was asking is to understand the distinction you were making between -relational database work- and -a cs class-.  Oh were you thinking that the db standard is set and normal db work is done within a standard file structure while the class is teaching you to think about a variety of file structures?
2011-02-14T11:12:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	It seems you understand what I'm saying.
2011-02-14T11:13:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	a Datastructures and file structures class is part of a CS degree and ends up more of a math class than a vocational class.
2011-02-14T11:14:00.000Z	cfedde	tripelb	http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp http://www.sqlite.org/
2011-02-14T11:22:00.000Z	tripelb	cfedde	yes I see that. I only wanted you to know my level so, like we have, we could talk 'efficiently'. -- Thanks for the links. -- it's that and scripts I have in front of me to learn now.
