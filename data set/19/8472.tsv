2007-03-30T14:39:00.000Z	GekiBlue		Hey all... I'm having problems with installing fglrx, I've tried the troubleshooting things... I tried to install it from the repositories and from ATI's site, but both ways... Everything will freeze up a little while after I log in
2007-03-30T14:40:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	Do you have it installed from the repos atm?
2007-03-30T14:41:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	no, now it's installed from ATI's site, but both ways it's 8.28.8 because that's the last one that support my card
2007-03-30T14:43:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	Have you edited your xorg.conf to have 'Driver "fglrx"' rather than "ati" or "radeon"?
2007-03-30T14:44:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	yes... and then fglrxinfo will say the right thing, but it will freeze up after a few moments so I have to reboot and change it back to ati so I can look for something else to solve the problem
2007-03-30T14:44:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	http://mglad.homeip.net/linux/xorg.txt is my current working xorg
2007-03-30T14:45:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	what's the bit at the bottom about aiglx?
2007-03-30T14:46:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	Oh, it just turns it off because ATI's a bitch to us linux folks and doesn't support AIGLX and I just disable it to keep it from being mistaken and used
2007-03-30T14:46:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	would not having that bit cause my freezing up problem? :3
2007-03-30T14:47:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	Do you intend to use Beryl or Compiz?
2007-03-30T14:47:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	I thought I might if I got the drivers working.
2007-03-30T14:48:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	What card do you have?
2007-03-30T14:48:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	ATI AIW Radeon 8500DV
2007-03-30T14:49:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	But you don't have any of the packages for beryl or compiz installed at the moment, do you?
2007-03-30T14:49:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	nope
2007-03-30T14:50:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	For me, it was as simple as getting it from the repos and then changing my xorg to say fglrx
2007-03-30T14:51:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	I guess I would suggest doing that, but could you post your xorg.conf anyway?
2007-03-30T14:53:00.000Z	GekiBlue	michael117	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13013/ <- Pretty much this... but with fglrx instead of ATI, I guess.
2007-03-30T15:06:00.000Z	michael117	GekiBlue	Hmm... I'm reading https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI and I also clicked about the open source "Radeon" drivers and it seems your card has pretty good support for 2d and 3d acceleration with the "Radeon" drivers. I use the proprietary fglrx drivers because the radeon driver only offers "experimental" 3d support for my card
