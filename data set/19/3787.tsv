2010-05-06T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hdtdi	did you md5 test the iso you used?
2010-05-06T01:29:00.000Z	hdtdi	ActionParsnip	no... i dont even know what that is
2010-05-06T01:36:00.000Z	hdtdi	ActionParsnip	and what if this md5 is ok ? i mean.. why is this needed at first place?
2010-05-06T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hdtdi	so you know the data you are using is complete and consistant
2010-05-06T01:37:00.000Z	hdtdi	ActionParsnip	so.. basically .. there should be no logon screen when you run ubuntu "demonstration and install" ?
2010-05-06T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hdtdi	usually yes, If you restart the x server using the key shortcut, does it autologin
2010-05-06T01:39:00.000Z	hdtdi	ActionParsnip	what key swhortcut ?
2010-05-06T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hdtdi	alt+K+PrintScreen
2010-05-06T01:40:00.000Z	hdtdi	ActionParsnip	nothin happens with alt+k+printscreen
2010-05-06T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hdtdi	i believe the credentials are: username=ubuntu password=ubuntu

2010-05-06T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hdtdi	try username ubuntu with no password
