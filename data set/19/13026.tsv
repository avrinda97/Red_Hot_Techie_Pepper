2005-10-09T10:52:00.000Z	whyameye		when I click on .mp4 files I get a security warning asking me if I want to proceed? How can I get rid of this warning? It is messing up my ooimpress presentation.
2005-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	whyameye		you can just mount with captive-ntfs in Hoary.
2005-10-09T10:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	whyameye	I googled last time (and that was months ago, though), and found that you need to recompile
2005-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	whyameye		well, I've mounted an ntfs drive using captive...
2005-10-09T10:55:00.000Z	Razor-X		hmmm....
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	whyameye		the biggest pain about captive is that you need the windows NTFS driver...which you need to get from a Windows OS. I know XP SP1 works and XP SP2 doesn't.
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	Razor-X	whyameye	I never updated to SP2
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	whyameye		captive will look for the driver on your drive, I believe.
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	Razor-X		so, i'm done
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	whyameye		then you are in luck!
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	Razor-X	whyameye	if that's true, then, I'll set up captive on my own
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	Razor-X		is it in the repos?
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	whyameye		you might have to help it find the driver.
2005-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	whyameye		but there are pretty good directions on the web. Can't remember where.
2005-10-09T10:57:00.000Z	whyameye		captive is supposed to be slower reading than the ntfs reader built-in. I've never confirmed this.
2005-10-09T10:58:00.000Z	whyameye		I don't know if you can automate mounting to captive-ntfs. I'm sure there's a way....
2005-10-09T10:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	whyameye	hmmm, should I google, or can you point me there?
2005-10-09T10:58:00.000Z	Razor-X		and I can script automation, if it's simple enough
2005-10-09T10:59:00.000Z	whyameye	Razor-X	I can't remember exactly what I did. I just Googled myself out of curiousity and turned up this. http://www.kruyt.org/?sub_item=46
