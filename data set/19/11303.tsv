2007-09-25T05:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	also, you say "boot M$" not "boot Windows"
2007-09-25T05:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	and god, if you can't simplify down inodes, you don't understand what they are

2008-01-21T16:58:00.000Z	Agent_bob	kbrooks	am i just unable to read the page accurately then ?  http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationshi
2008-01-21T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	"Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process."
2008-01-21T16:59:00.000Z	Agent_bob	kbrooks	i'm not dealing with fact, i'm dealing with the official page, and what it does say.    maybe the page should be edited ?
2008-01-21T17:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	i have no idea, i am not canonical. ask them yourself
2008-02-19T16:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	lol
2008-02-19T16:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	umm, question quality check failed. a) you're asking to ask, and b) from a, it can be inferred that your question is vague
2008-02-19T16:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	please try asking an actual question
2008-02-19T16:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	Agent_bob	then we can give actual support
