2006-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	slavik		IMO, breezy badger should've come with the badger flash videos :D
2006-04-20T12:00:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	but flash is non-free :)
2006-04-20T12:00:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	the videos are ... and they are fun :D
2006-04-20T12:01:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	that doesnt mean it didnt come from red hat..
2006-04-20T12:01:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	I never said anything from that
2006-04-20T12:04:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	or 10MB?
2006-04-20T12:05:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	kernel doesnt fit in 400K
2006-04-20T12:05:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	original MINIX?
2006-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	the GPL doesnt mandate distribution in the first place, only the terms of the (optional) distribution.
2007-03-03T10:46:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	he already got it
2007-03-03T10:50:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	or from knoppix :P
2007-03-03T10:50:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	well of course, but then again, this is #ubuntu, not #knoppix, so...
2007-03-03T10:51:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	ubuntu is not exactly intended to be a livecd distro ...
2007-03-03T10:51:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	of course it is.
2007-03-03T10:51:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	then there are many things missing which is a discussion for another time/place
2007-03-03T10:52:00.000Z	eobanb	slavik	of course.  but i'm just saying that it'd work fine for installing grub.
2007-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	slavik	eobanb	beat you :P
