2007-12-17T01:11:00.000Z	karolos		hello. I have a program runned in background with & now i want to take it back in foreground. how is that possible?
2007-12-17T01:12:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	in the same terminal do >>       fg        << that is all
2007-12-17T01:12:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	-bash: fg: current: no such job that's what i get
2007-12-17T01:13:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	is the job finished?
2007-12-17T01:13:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	i see it in ps -A
2007-12-17T01:14:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	as i said seems it's still runnning as i see it in ps -A and it's Time is getting more and more each time
2007-12-17T01:15:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	what is the command you are using?
2007-12-17T01:15:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	"ps -A | grep name" and simple "fg"
2007-12-17T01:16:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	no what command are you chasing
2007-12-17T01:17:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	what do you mean?
2007-12-17T01:17:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	what command are you trying to find - the clue must be in there
2007-12-17T01:18:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	i'm trying to  find john that program
2007-12-17T01:19:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	I still have not got the answer I thought i was asking for, so what exactly is the command line you were running that you put an & after
2007-12-17T01:19:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	oh ok i did "./john --restore &"
2007-12-17T01:21:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	strange my thoughts are that it should have worked - as in come to the foreground  you are in the same terminal I take it
2007-12-17T01:21:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	hm? my mistake ... i exited the terminal and logged back again(through ssh)
2007-12-17T01:21:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	you need to run screen for that
2007-12-17T01:22:00.000Z	ompaul	karolos	screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
2007-12-17T01:24:00.000Z	karolos	ompaul	any easier way
