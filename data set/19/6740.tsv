2007-12-29T03:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	please read the topic for the channel do /topic if you can't see it in your client
2007-12-29T04:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	the message was in the channel: ubotu> Avt: envy is not needed or supported. Use the Resticted Manager to install binary drivers and see « /msg ubotu binarydriver »
2007-12-29T04:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	do this: /msg ubotu binarydriver and it will reply
2007-12-29T05:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	you can't really do that - what is it you want to achive with this terminal? we may have what you want a different way
2007-12-29T05:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	did you set a root password?
2007-12-29T05:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	so do this as your ordinary user;      sudo passwd -l root
2007-12-29T05:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	reboot after that and enjoy
2007-12-29T05:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	no
2007-12-29T05:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	  sudo passwd -l root
2007-12-29T05:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	 reboot - then you don't have a root password it is all back to normal
2007-12-29T05:16:00.000Z	Avt	ompaul	I want a root password lol
2007-12-29T05:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	then you can't have your cake and eat it, you can't get there from here
2007-12-29T05:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	if you insist on asking how to use root I will be remove
2007-12-29T05:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	 no you will be actually removed - minor typo there
2007-12-29T05:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Avt	you read that page and be enlightened
