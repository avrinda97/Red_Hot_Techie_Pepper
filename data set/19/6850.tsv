2007-11-28T10:01:00.000Z	bruenig	zhopoyeb	what?
2007-11-28T10:02:00.000Z	zhopoyeb		i tired putting /home/user in the command part but it wont work
2007-11-28T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig		what are you trying to do?
2007-11-28T10:03:00.000Z	zhopoyeb	bruenig	add a home folder icon to desktop
2007-11-28T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	zhopoyeb	I am reading into this, but I am going to assume you want to open a file manager?
2007-11-28T10:04:00.000Z	zhopoyeb	bruenig	well note that i am using kubuntu, Sorry, for the inconvenient
2007-11-28T10:04:00.000Z	bruenig	zhopoyeb	ok but am I right, are you wanting to do that?
2007-11-28T10:04:00.000Z	bruenig		deluge is very buggy
2007-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	zhopoyeb	bruenig	i want the a icon to open up in my home dir.
2007-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	zhopoyeb	with a file manager right?
2007-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	zhopoyeb	bruenig	yes
2007-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	bruenig	zhopoyeb	ok so I am going to guess here, you probably want the command to be "konqueror ~"
2007-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	zhopoyeb	bruenig	I think Dolphin replaced Konq
2007-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	bruenig	zhopoyeb	well then replace it with dolphin
2007-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	zhopoyeb		ill try
2007-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	bruenig		think a little bit
2007-11-28T10:09:00.000Z	bruenig		most tend to be pebkac oriented
2007-11-28T10:13:00.000Z	zhopoyeb	bruenig	that did the trick btw. thanks
