2005-10-22T14:12:00.000Z	ark_		Hey, I have a Senao Prism 2.5 SL2511 wireless PCMCIA card, but Breezy loads the orinoco modules. It would be much better if it loaded the hostap modules. Anyone know how I can make Breezy load the hostap modules instead?
2005-10-22T14:12:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	have you tried putting the module to load in /etc/modules?
2005-10-22T14:13:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	if it's in there, then yes, remove it
2005-10-22T14:14:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	you can always comment out lines in /etc/modules (so you don't forget what was in there to begin with)
2005-10-22T14:14:00.000Z	ark_	magnusthe	yeah I'll try it now :)
2005-10-22T14:15:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	good luck!
2005-10-22T14:20:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	it'd be worth trying anyway
2005-10-22T14:21:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	if it doesn
2005-10-22T14:21:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	if it doesn't work you'll probably need to "blacklist" the orinoco module
2005-10-22T14:23:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	I believe dependencies will be loaded automagically (like modprobe)
2005-10-22T14:25:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	depends, you only modified /etc/modules, right? then you need to reboot to try it... you can always remove the orinoco module
2005-10-22T14:30:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	any luck?
2005-10-22T14:31:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	then you need to look into blacklisting orinoco, hotplug is a good place to do it (I think)
2005-10-22T14:32:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	then add the other modules to /etc/modules as well
2005-10-22T14:32:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out
2005-10-22T14:32:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	good luck
2005-10-22T14:32:00.000Z	ark_	magnusthe	Do uo know where this hotplug file is located>
2005-10-22T14:33:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	/etc/hotplug is the place to look
2005-10-22T14:33:00.000Z	magnusthe	ark_	my please... good luck
