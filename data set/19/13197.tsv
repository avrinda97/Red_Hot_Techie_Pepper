2005-05-12T11:37:00.000Z	nate_	xfSx	first time i've heard of that
2005-05-12T11:37:00.000Z	xfSx	nate_	damn, i remember reading something about it in ubuntuforums, although no solution
2005-05-12T11:37:00.000Z	xfSx		it's the only major issue i got with ubu!
2005-05-12T11:37:00.000Z	xfSx		hrmpf
2005-05-12T11:38:00.000Z	nate_	xfSx	yeah, sounds rather rarem did you mess with anything so that you have a starting point?
2005-05-12T11:38:00.000Z	nate_	xfSx	any idea what caused it?
2005-05-12T11:38:00.000Z	xfSx	nate_	it's all possible, i may need to reinstall anyway
2005-05-12T11:38:00.000Z	xfSx		no i can't be sure what's done it, i've messed about enuff with my ubu
2005-05-12T11:38:00.000Z	nate_	xfSx	sometimes a test-install is a good idea
2005-05-12T11:39:00.000Z	xfSx		segos, /etc/resolv.conf holds dns info
2005-05-12T11:39:00.000Z	nate_	xfSx	sounds like something is messed, so i'd reinstall if you have no idea.  unless someone has a better idea
2005-05-12T11:39:00.000Z	xfSx		no i'm hoary
2005-05-12T11:40:00.000Z	xfSx	nate_	yeh ok.. reinstall may have to be it.. hrm
2005-05-12T11:40:00.000Z	nate_	xfSx	always put your home directory in a seperate partition, then most of your settings are saved
2005-05-12T11:41:00.000Z	xfSx	nate_	that's good advice for next time i repartition
2005-05-12T11:41:00.000Z	xfSx		thnx
