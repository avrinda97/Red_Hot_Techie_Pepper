2008-10-05T22:04:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	what kind of computer?
2008-10-05T22:05:00.000Z	en1gma	tilgovi	the motherboard is an asus a8n32-sli-deluxe with an alc850 sound chip using the optical out
2008-10-05T22:06:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	try running alsamixer from a terminal and see if the slider is muted (press M to toggle) or turned down for the optical out
2008-10-05T22:07:00.000Z	en1gma	tilgovi	its GREEN
2008-10-05T22:07:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	Are those the only ones you see? What does it say for Card: in th etop left?
2008-10-05T22:08:00.000Z	en1gma	tilgovi	it says CK804
2008-10-05T22:14:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	I'm a recent convert as well. I find that there's no substitute for k3b and amarok though. Mostly amarok. Brasero isn't awful.
2008-10-05T22:20:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	System sounds are enabled in the Sound preferences? You could also try changing the Sound Events playback from Autodetect to something else.
2008-10-05T22:22:00.000Z	en1gma	tilgovi	when i do the sound tests they play but i still dont hear anything when i do clicking
2008-10-05T22:22:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	strange.
2008-10-05T22:22:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	you have software mixing turned on?
2008-10-05T22:23:00.000Z	tilgovi	en1gma	heh..I dunno. I turn off system sounds because I don't like them.
