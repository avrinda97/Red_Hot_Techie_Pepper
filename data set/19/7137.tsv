2009-06-19T10:53:00.000Z	yowshi		anyone here know how to unjam a module jammed by a defunct process without rebooting?
2009-06-19T10:55:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	try "top" from the terminal?
2009-06-19T10:56:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	defunct processes are unkillable by any ,ethod. and apparently normally harmless. i have found though that when a process dies while using a usb device like a webcam or joystick it will jam said device and it's related modules making it unavailable to any other programme and the modules dont respond to a modprobe -r
2009-06-19T10:57:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	so kill the process?
2009-06-19T10:59:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	as i said the defunct process is unkillable. for example if i am using dosbox and dosbox crashes so i kill it manually the process never dissappears from the ps-A or top list it just becomes listed as <defunct> but still somehow retains control of the frigging joystick
2009-06-19T11:00:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	how are you trying to kill  it?
2009-06-19T11:00:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	with a kill-9
2009-06-19T11:00:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	from within top?
2009-06-19T11:01:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	i have tried console within top from a root login on alt ctrl f1
2009-06-19T11:01:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	ok, exit top and try "killall "process"
2009-06-19T11:02:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	none of the easy solutions work believe me i banged my head against this issue for 2 weeks when i still had faint hopes of using a webcam
2009-06-19T11:02:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	you might have to sudo killall?
2009-06-19T11:03:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	nope that dont work either
2009-06-19T11:03:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	processes listed as defunct are already considered dead by the system. technically they arent supposed to use any resources of the system
2009-06-19T11:03:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	i just hit on a very bad bug is all
2009-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	Congragulations! No, don't re-install, that is a Windows solution!
2009-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	LOL funny i been running ubuntu for a while now 2 or 3 years
2009-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	n2diy	yowshi	You found a bug, now work on fixing it.
2009-06-19T11:06:00.000Z	yowshi	n2diy	would if i could but i dont have the coding expertise heh
