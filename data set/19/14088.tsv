2004-11-14T09:13:00.000Z	JIMC		im looking for a SATA Raid Controller anyone has experiences with adaptech 1210sa under Ubuntu?
2004-11-14T09:15:00.000Z	JIMC		AAR-1210SA is a raid controller i think
2004-11-14T09:17:00.000Z	JIMC		which controller i should use?
2004-11-14T09:18:00.000Z	JIMC		whats about performancE?
2004-11-14T09:19:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	software raid has good preformance
2004-11-14T09:19:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	I run mirroring on an "old" dual athlon 1600+ system, don't notice any preformance hit
2004-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	for the most part
2004-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	3ware makes good cards
2004-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	but that's about it
2004-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	it also depends on if you are doing mirroring or different kinds of striping
2004-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	how many drives, and what are you planing to do
2004-11-14T09:26:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	yes, it does
2004-11-14T09:28:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	all
2004-11-14T09:28:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	as long as grub is on both disks, yes
2004-11-14T09:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	basicaly, with software raid, you partition a new drive to repalace the broken one
2004-11-14T09:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	then you run a raidhotadd command, and it will start rebuilding
2004-11-14T09:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	easy as that
2004-11-14T09:32:00.000Z	SuperQ	JIMC	anything in 2.6.8.1
