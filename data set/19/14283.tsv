2004-10-01T08:07:00.000Z	hornbeck		I need some help trying to fix my console issue
2004-10-01T08:07:00.000Z	hornbeck		got any takers?
2004-10-01T08:08:00.000Z	guest	hornbeck	I'm listening
2004-10-01T08:10:00.000Z	hornbeck	guest	I have no prompt on any console
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hornbeck		it just stopped working
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hornbeck		I have been through my logs
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hornbeck		nothing
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hornbeck		gnome-terminal will launch but no prompt, same with aterm
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	guest	hornbeck	so it's no longer a default install, can you execute commands? (i.e. is just the prompt text missing, or is the term not working)
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hornbeck		virtual consoles are fine
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hornbeck		cannot execute command
2004-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	hornbeck		it will let me type but it just sits there
2004-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	guest	hornbeck	so it's hung, interesting ... any changes to you .bashrc (and related) files?
2004-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	hornbeck		hmm
2004-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	hornbeck		not that I know of
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	hornbeck		it was my bashrc
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	hornbeck		thanks
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	hornbeck		man I hate stupid mistakes
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	guest	hornbeck	great ...
