2012-08-06T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	is the HDMI set as the output device?
2012-08-06T23:54:00.000Z	josh13	ActionParsnip	No, TBH I dont know how to even chaange that as nothing is listed under display options
2012-08-06T23:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	search dash for sound.
2012-08-06T23:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	what video chip do you use?
2012-08-06T23:57:00.000Z	josh13	ActionParsnip	its a nvidia 610
2012-08-06T23:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	did you install the nvidia driver?
2012-08-06T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	no need, this isn't windows
2012-08-06T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
2012-08-07T00:01:00.000Z	josh13	ActionParsnip	doing that now, can you explain the first sudo to me?
2012-08-07T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	its all one command, the first part adds a new source, you have quite a new nvidia gpu which will benefit from the newer drivers
2012-08-07T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	you need the driver first
2012-08-07T00:03:00.000Z	josh13	ActionParsnip	Ok i did everything u told me too
2012-08-07T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	did you see it build the kernel module?
2012-08-07T00:05:00.000Z	josh13	ActionParsnip	umm sure, it did a ton of stuff
2012-08-07T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	ok then reboot
2012-08-07T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	josh13	is the system a laptop?
