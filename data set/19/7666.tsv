2011-03-11T18:57:00.000Z	coraxx		Here is an odd question...  I have a problem with SSH.  When I connect to a remote computer through a VPN-connection, I can only run commands in the SSH session that has one-line responses ...except 'grep'.  i.e. and can write 'ls -all | grep r' and get a response, but no response when writing just 'ls' ...can't edit files with nano or view them with 'cat' ...what is the problem ?
2011-03-11T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	what happens when you type "ls"
2011-03-11T18:58:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	the cursor freezes after the command line after I hit 'Enter'
2011-03-11T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	sounds like the remote machine is having a problem
2011-03-11T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	does it ever "un freeze"
2011-03-11T18:59:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	probably ...but what kind ?
2011-03-11T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	what is the linux version you are sshing into
2011-03-11T18:59:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	no...it freezes completly ...can't even 'Ctrl-C' the session ...I have to close the whole Terminal window.
2011-03-11T19:00:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	Ubuntu lucid lynx 10.04.2
2011-03-11T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	and what linux version are you sshing from
2011-03-11T19:01:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	I have tried both Maverick and Lucid  (don't think its a client issue tho ...I just have multiple workstations here)
2011-03-11T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	look in the syslogs on the remote machines, it's also possible it's the vpn link
2011-03-11T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	routing also ?
2011-03-11T19:02:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	I have issues in viewing files remotely ...as I can't 'cat' them .... if I know what I'm looking for I can 'grep' it and get a response.
2011-03-11T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	obvious things, error, warning etc
2011-03-11T19:03:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	if it was a routing problem the VPN-connection wouldn't be stable and there would be other symptoms is remote controlling it ...however the issue is very consistent.
2011-03-11T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	coraxx	yes, routing is unlikly
2011-03-11T19:04:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	(oh...when I say specific things I meant...a specific search-string)
2011-03-11T19:09:00.000Z	coraxx	ikonia	the next best answer I'm looking for is a way of defining the problem, so I can go on a search.  It's just so weird to describe :-)
