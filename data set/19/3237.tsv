2009-11-05T04:45:00.000Z	Balsaq		is it ok to simply keep 9.04...and just do t he upgrades? or will at some pint to forced up to the next OS?
2009-11-05T04:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	you may do that
2009-11-05T04:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	however, 9.04's support ends in october 2010
2009-11-05T04:45:00.000Z	Balsaq	lstarnes	thank you
2009-11-05T04:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	it will not be supported then
2009-11-05T04:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	which means that canonical will no longer help with it, it won't get security updates, and this channel likely wouldn't support it
2009-11-05T04:47:00.000Z	Balsaq	lstarnes	sebsebseb bummer 904 is the best..better than xp and all of em
2009-11-05T04:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	wait until 9.10 gets more stable ot 10.04 is released
2009-11-05T04:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	it's a new file system
2009-11-05T04:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	it supposedly has better performance
2009-11-05T04:51:00.000Z	Balsaq	lstarnes	wow i just have never had a better OS than 904...
2009-11-05T04:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	but there are other differences
2009-11-05T04:52:00.000Z	Balsaq	lstarnes	any more info on the differences?
2009-11-05T04:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	no, sorry
2009-11-05T04:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	Balsaq	you'll have to look it up somewhere
2009-11-05T04:52:00.000Z	Balsaq	lstarnes	ok thanks
