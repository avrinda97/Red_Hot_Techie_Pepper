2010-04-10T11:58:00.000Z	keyvan		unfortunately, not many people return that good faith anymore. "what a sad" for society at large.
2010-04-10T11:59:00.000Z	keyvan		is there a way to create an alternate username that will actually login as root?
2010-04-10T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 ive seen it done.. but whats the point
2010-04-10T11:59:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	its so i can ssh to my server under my currently logged in name on macbook (keyvan)
2010-04-10T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 its best to ssh in as a user, then sudo -s
2010-04-10T12:00:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	trying to save keystrokes and commands… but i dont want to create an alias in my bashrc either
2010-04-10T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 thers Lazy, then theres and insecure. :)
2010-04-10T12:01:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	nobody will get a hold of this laptop lol :P
2010-04-10T12:01:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	lol do you have a solution?
2010-04-10T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 security is 40% 'practice'  where you do the proper methods to keep things secure.
2010-04-10T12:01:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	by practice you mean extra keys?
2010-04-10T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 you could just allow root to ssh in. thats one way.
2010-04-10T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 yes.
2010-04-10T12:02:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	i'm not root on my macbook… see when u do ssh host… it automatically does ssh local_user@host, but i dont want to login as keyvan, i want to login as root
2010-04-10T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 ssh takes an arument as what user to 'connect as'
2010-04-10T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 you can set up sshd to allow root logging in.
2010-04-10T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	  make an alias then.   or try the ssh configs -> http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/use-sshconfig-simplify-your-life
2010-04-10T12:04:00.000Z	keyvan	Dr_Willis	 cool thx, ssh configs sounds good
2010-04-10T12:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	keyvan	 link the users configs to /root/???configs??? is one way
