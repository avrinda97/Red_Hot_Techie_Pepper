2008-05-12T06:26:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Thank you. I'll read through this. I'll ask you if I still can't get it.
2008-05-12T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	sure
2008-05-12T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	what filesystem?
2008-05-12T06:25:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Ext3
2008-05-12T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	use chmod/chown as usual
2008-05-12T06:27:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Thank you. I understand permissions well, actually. It's the mounting that I'm getting tripped up on.
2008-05-12T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	mounting and setting permissions are independent
2008-05-12T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	yes
2008-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	change the permissions after you mount is what I mean
2008-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Ok,, so then, would I do this: 1) mount the partition, 2) change group/permissions?    Or would I 1) change permissions on the mount point, 2) mount the partition ?
2008-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Sorry, type at the same time!
2008-05-12T06:29:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Dr_willis: I'll give this a try.
2008-05-12T06:31:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Awesome. Thank you very much for your help.
2008-05-12T06:32:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	now, my mounted drive has permissions 770, and the group is set to a group that users are part of. Is this what you were thinking?
2008-05-12T06:32:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Also, any suggestions on which group to use?
2008-05-12T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	wabash	anything you want, I don't know of a typical one for you to use
2008-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	wabash	jrib	Ok, thank you. You have solved all of my problems, and I appreciate your help. Dr_willis, thank you too.
