2005-11-24T09:33:00.000Z	Eternalist		and then have any user access it
2005-11-24T09:33:00.000Z	Eternalist		because i dont want to run BMP as root everytime i want to listen to music
2005-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist		done
2005-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist		dammit
2005-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist		then of course i try to go in that directory as my user and it gives me a Permission Denied
2005-11-24T09:36:00.000Z	topyli	Eternalist	it won't work. sudo will ask for root password, but there is none
2005-11-24T09:36:00.000Z	Eternalist	topyli	it works for me
2005-11-24T09:36:00.000Z	topyli	Eternalist	bleh. forget what i said. i thought you said su
2005-11-24T09:37:00.000Z	topyli	Eternalist	you don't use sudo for every single thing :)
2005-11-24T09:37:00.000Z	Eternalist	topyli	well for instance
2005-11-24T09:37:00.000Z	Eternalist	topyli	to edit the /etc/fstab
2005-11-24T09:37:00.000Z	topyli	Eternalist	how often do you edit your fstab?
2005-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	Eternalist	topyli	theres an example, operation not permitted, because he isnt root
2005-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	topyli	Eternalist	i use my machine to work. sudo is rarely needed
2005-11-24T09:39:00.000Z	Eternalist	topyli	ic ic
2005-11-24T09:39:00.000Z	topyli	Eternalist	^
