2008-11-23T00:47:00.000Z	giuseppe_		Hi everyone... does anyone know how to set audacious as default mp3 player?
2008-11-23T00:48:00.000Z	_Zeus_	giuseppe_	preferred applications
2008-11-23T00:49:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	but it seems it does not work fine
2008-11-23T00:49:00.000Z	_Zeus_	giuseppe_	that's hard to do over irc
2008-11-23T00:50:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	for example I choosed Custom, then I wrote vlc to set vlc as default and when I do double click... movie player starts... strange
2008-11-23T00:51:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	so any idea?
2008-11-23T00:51:00.000Z	_Zeus_	giuseppe_	not really... are you sure you have vlc installed?
2008-11-23T00:51:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	sure
2008-11-23T00:52:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	sorry?
2008-11-23T00:52:00.000Z	_Zeus_	giuseppe_	did you try right clicking on the file?
2008-11-23T00:53:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	I try
2008-11-23T00:53:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	now
2008-11-23T00:54:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	but in this way if I fix for example audacious for a single mp3 file... all mp3 files will be opened using audacious or I have to set every file?
2008-11-23T00:55:00.000Z	_Zeus_	giuseppe_	it will apply to all mp3s
2008-11-23T00:55:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	great... thanks a lot
2008-11-23T00:57:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	now I want to solve another problem regarding my shutdown
2008-11-23T00:57:00.000Z	_Zeus_	giuseppe_	sure
2008-11-23T00:59:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	it's very boring
2008-11-23T01:01:00.000Z	giuseppe_	_Zeus_	did you understand my problem?
