2007-05-05T14:17:00.000Z	mrmonday		how do I write 5gb files to a fat32 partition?
2007-05-05T14:17:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	you can't, the limit is 4 GB
2007-05-05T14:17:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	Iknow
2007-05-05T14:17:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	use another filesystem, it is impossible
2007-05-05T14:18:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	I have to use fat32 to back up my files to, and some of my files are too big
2007-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	what can I do?
2007-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	you need to use another filesystem. you _cannot_ put them on fat32. you can use split to split up the files into smaller chunks, but it will be a pita
2007-05-05T14:20:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	whats a pita?
2007-05-05T14:20:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	google it ;-)
2007-05-05T14:28:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	split
2007-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	it should be installed by default
2007-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	how do I get to it?
2007-05-05T14:29:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	it is a terminal application
2007-05-05T14:30:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	how does it work?
2007-05-05T14:32:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	e.g. 'split -db 100000 foo.txt bar' this will create files bar00, bar01, bar02 and so forth from foo.txt that are each 100000 bytes
2007-05-05T14:32:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	you glue them back together with cat
2007-05-05T14:32:00.000Z	mrmonday	eck	can I specify 2 pieces?
2007-05-05T14:33:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	no, you specify the size you want
2007-05-05T14:34:00.000Z	eck	mrmonday	you can use the suffix m for megabytes
