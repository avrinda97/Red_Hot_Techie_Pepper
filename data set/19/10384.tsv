2008-06-26T21:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	Take it to offtopic
2008-07-01T22:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	get the specs for your monitor  specifically  vertrefresh and hsync.. not just the refersh rates.. and manually setup your xorg for the old crt
2008-07-01T22:57:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	i did find something on google, but then ubuntu says it doesnt understand my settings and will run in low graphics mode
2008-07-01T22:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	setting up the video card and setting up the monitor are two different processes
2008-07-01T22:58:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	can i get my old 'fglrxconfig' back?
2008-07-01T22:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	If you setup the video card and try a mode the generic montior cant understand.. you end up in failsafe mode
2008-07-01T22:59:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	i told ubuntu that it is not generic monitor, it is iiyama 410 pro
2008-07-01T23:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	It isnt seeing something right.. You can keep trying to do it your way or do as I suggested..
2008-07-01T23:00:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	it added extra Monitor section
2008-07-01T23:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	pastebin your xorg
2008-07-01T23:01:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	will try to delete all but last
2008-07-01T23:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	Provide link to pdf of specs, ((not some generic sales review)
2008-07-01T23:02:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	well ubuntu knows iiyama visonmaster 410 pro
2008-07-01T23:06:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	interesting mess, both aticonfig and ubuntu displayconfig-gtk just added devices :)
2008-07-01T23:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	Hold off on the enter key.. thanks
2008-07-01T23:50:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	please correct me if i'm wrong
2008-07-03T18:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	I think you answered your own question.. stupid flash things, turn it off or remove it
2008-07-03T19:00:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Jack_Sparrow	sure sure, but it's only since 3.0 or latest upgrade
2008-07-03T19:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wolfeySI	I knew there was a reason I didnt change over
