2007-12-19T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	never mind me, I just read back
2007-12-19T11:38:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 Sorry for my newbness, but I'm not seeing Nautilus.  How do I open it?
2007-12-19T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	places->home will start it up for you
2007-12-19T11:39:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 Just noticed the other guy pointed me there.  I'm in it now.  :D  Thanks
2007-12-19T11:40:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 I don't have anything in here like .wine
2007-12-19T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	the rest of the other guys post said how to see it, press ctl-H with the mouse over the window
2007-12-19T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	or, View->Hidden Files
2007-12-19T11:41:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 I did that.  I have like .gnome .gnome2, etc. but no .wine or .crossover
2007-12-19T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	that means you haven't run winecfg yet
2007-12-19T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	according to my very limited knowledge of wine, for more wine questions you'll need someone else :)
2007-12-19T11:41:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 I have a .nautilus but I went in there and there's nothing there.  And I run Crossover.  I've installed it and used it to install WoW
2007-12-19T11:42:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 Thanks for the help just the same.  :)
2007-12-19T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	wow runs fine on crossover?
2007-12-19T11:42:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	Yessir.
2007-12-23T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	take a look at the cdw package, it's used on in a console
2007-12-23T08:52:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 I don't know what that means.  :(
2007-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Old_Gregg	what part?
2007-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	Old_Gregg	nickrud	 Kind of all of it.  I know what a package is, but do I need to install something else?
