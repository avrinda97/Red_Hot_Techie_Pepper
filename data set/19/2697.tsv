2010-01-26T14:07:00.000Z	Firekraag		btw what's the difference between chromium and google chrome?
2010-01-26T14:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	no
2010-01-26T14:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	Chrome is  based on chromium.  Chromium is open source, and Chrome is not
2010-01-26T14:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	just like that Google Chrome OS that is coming out later this year,   it's based on Chromeium OS
2010-01-26T14:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	well they given source code to the open source community, and then they make their own one
2010-01-26T14:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	based on the open source
2010-01-26T14:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	and I guess it will only be mainly  Desktop Linux people that will know about Chromeium browser and Chromeium  OS,   Google will advertise Chrome browser and Chrome OS
2010-01-26T14:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	apparantly Chrome is better than Chromeium,  however I don't use either, since  I think it's better to support Firefox
2010-01-26T14:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	what's that?
2010-01-26T14:13:00.000Z	Firekraag	sebsebseb	dunno if it's international. it's a music streaming website
2010-01-26T14:13:00.000Z	Firekraag	sebsebseb	www.deezer.com
2010-01-26T14:13:00.000Z	Firekraag	sebsebseb	fully legal, you can't dl the musics but it's very useful
2010-01-26T14:14:00.000Z	Firekraag	sebsebseb	but no one is perfect: full flash and so on
2010-01-26T14:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	try Flash with  Epiphany  and Galeon   sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser not just epiphany on it's own or you get a game, (that's right  Desktop Linux is for gaming as well, despite what certain people think)
2010-01-26T14:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	If your using Arch, why are you here?
2010-01-26T14:20:00.000Z	Firekraag	sebsebseb	to help people under ubuntu ^^ (i used to use this distro for a long time)
2010-01-26T14:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	ok that's a bit like me,  I am on Mandriva right now, but here to help with Ubuntu,  since that's the distro that has most chance at gaining a more proper market share, at the moment
2010-01-26T14:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firekraag	plus it has a lot more users in the channel than say Mandriva,  more fun to help in big channels I think
2010-01-26T14:21:00.000Z	Firekraag	sebsebseb	yeah sure :D archlinux channel has 600 users not that bad
