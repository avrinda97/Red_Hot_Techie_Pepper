2009-11-01T08:23:00.000Z	sKyZ	wgrant	- it's a fresh install on a dedi server.
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	What if you 'wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/intrepid-security/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz' manually?
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	(and why on earth is there a fresh install of intrepid in existence?)
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	sKyZ	wgrant	- fresh install, wget isn't installed.
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	sKyZ		erm
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	sKyZ		nvm
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	sKyZ		wget = 404
2009-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	Um. ping security.ubuntu.com, and tell me what the given IP address is.
2009-11-01T08:25:00.000Z	sKyZ	wgrant	- (208.94.243.233
2009-11-01T08:25:00.000Z	sKyZ	wgrant	- 208.94.243.233
2009-11-01T08:25:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	Hm. That must be some localish mirror.
2009-11-01T08:26:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	It's certainly not the official Canonical host. But who knows what strange DNS tricks they are pulling.
2009-11-01T08:26:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	Where is this server?
2009-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	sKyZ	wgrant	- joesdatacenter
2009-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	Aha.
2009-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	Your DC is being evil.
2009-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	That is their local mirror; they are forging the DNS responses.
2009-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	wgrant	sKyZ	(see the whois for that security.ubuntu.com IP address that you gave)
2009-11-01T08:28:00.000Z	sKyZ	wgrant	- weird.
