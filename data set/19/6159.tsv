2008-03-04T14:16:00.000Z	Dangermike	TheOomph	any ubuntu download site should host the md5
2008-03-04T14:17:00.000Z	Dangermike	TheOomph	http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/MD5SUMS change the version number for yours if your not running gutsy
2008-03-04T14:27:00.000Z	Dangermike	TheOomph	compare your iso image to the md5
2008-03-04T14:27:00.000Z	Dangermike	TheOomph	burn it at a slow rate, not as fast as possible
