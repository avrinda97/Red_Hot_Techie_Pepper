2008-12-07T18:54:00.000Z	Xitruz		If I have an Intel Core 2 Duo on my laptop. Should I use the 64-bit version of ubuntu?
2008-12-07T18:54:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	you could
2008-12-07T18:54:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	but it wont be much difference i think
2008-12-07T18:55:00.000Z	Xitruz	marcelkoopman	is the 64:bit more "buggy" or is it just like the 32bit but i could  get a little extra from it?
2008-12-07T18:56:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	i'm using 64 bit right now, bought a new computer amd64
2008-12-07T18:56:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	its very fast
2008-12-07T18:56:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	but it could also be fast in 32bit mode
2008-12-07T18:57:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	however i have 4 gig of ram now, which is fully used, i could expand it more and 64 bit supports that, 32 bit not
2008-12-07T18:57:00.000Z	Xitruz	marcelkoopman	nice. :) ill try that live-cd then. another question. can u install directly from the livecd?
2008-12-07T18:57:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	yes
2008-12-07T18:57:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	you mean ubuntu then
2008-12-07T18:58:00.000Z	Xitruz	marcelkoopman	anything i shoudl do in Vista before I try this if I want to dual-boot?
2008-12-07T18:58:00.000Z	Xitruz	marcelkoopman	yes, ubuntu
2008-12-07T19:00:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	vista?
2008-12-07T19:00:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	you mean install vista first?
2008-12-07T19:01:00.000Z	Xitruz	marcelkoopman	I am using Windows Vista on the laptop right now. but I want to have both vista and ubuntu. so I want to have dualboot on it. and anything I need to do in vista to get this to work before I install ubuntu on it?
2008-12-07T19:02:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	it might not work because vista uses nfts and ubuntu cant resize it, but give it a try
2008-12-07T19:03:00.000Z	Xitruz	marcelkoopman	but I have 2 disks on this one, so if i just format it in ubuntu it shouldnt be a problem?
2008-12-07T19:04:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Xitruz	yes the first one for vista and the second for ubuntu is good, it will format the second one
