2007-09-02T15:15:00.000Z	KevinOman		is unrar-free still in the repositories?
2007-09-02T15:16:00.000Z	KevinOman		I can't find it
2007-09-02T15:16:00.000Z	KevinOman		ok thanks guys
2007-09-02T15:16:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	yes, but don't bother with it since it's kind of useless.  You are using a non-free like rar anyway so just use "unrar" from multiverse
2007-09-02T15:17:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	where can I get the links to multiuniverse
2007-09-02T15:17:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	system -> administration -> software sources, see ubotu for more details
2007-09-02T15:18:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	im on server 6.06
2007-09-02T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	still there :)
2007-09-02T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	oh, you need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list then
2007-09-02T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	yep, it mentions how to edit /etc/apt/sources.list on the command line
2007-09-02T15:24:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	it looks like multiunivers is already there, just commented out, under backports sound right?
2007-09-02T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	not "feisty-backports multiverse", make sure it is "feisty multiverse".  It isn't commented in the default sources.list I believe
2007-09-02T15:27:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	im on 6.06 does that make a difference
2007-09-02T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	ah, right replace "feisty" with "dapper"
2007-09-02T15:27:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	ok thanks
2007-09-02T15:29:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse is that what your talking about?
2007-09-03T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	you probably deleted the directory you are in (and its parent)
2007-09-03T16:51:00.000Z	KevinOman	jrib	that's sounds right, thanks
2007-09-05T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	KevinOman	#ubuntu+1
