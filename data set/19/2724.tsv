2010-01-21T23:19:00.000Z	relina		hello somebody to help me?
2010-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	relina		well i have this relysys TL795 monitor on DVI link and image is jumping
2010-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	relina		i am using proprietary drivers, jumping occurs nmostly on logon screen
2010-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	relina		sometimes screeen goes black and back on
2010-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	relina		could this be caused by refresh rate
2010-01-21T23:20:00.000Z	relina		?
2010-01-21T23:21:00.000Z	acicula	relina	crt/lcd ? does it just out of the blue switch on and off?
2010-01-21T23:23:00.000Z	acicula	relina	dont really understand what graphic issue you are having :/
2010-01-21T23:23:00.000Z	relina	acicula	on logon screen the image is jumping up down or goes black
2010-01-21T23:23:00.000Z	acicula	relina	like an improperly tuned anttenna tv ?
2010-01-21T23:24:00.000Z	relina	acicula	kinda, but this is DVI
2010-01-21T23:24:00.000Z	acicula	relina	yeah i understand that
2010-01-21T23:26:00.000Z	acicula	relina	none here :/
2010-01-21T23:27:00.000Z	acicula	relina	i doubt it, you'd have persistend problems, same for cable/screen
2010-01-21T23:27:00.000Z	acicula	relina	sounds more like its not detecting the resolution/refresh rates properly
2010-01-21T23:27:00.000Z	acicula	relina	odd that it does detect it properly once logged in though
2010-01-21T23:29:00.000Z	acicula	relina	card would mean the problems also persist after login?
2010-01-21T23:30:00.000Z	relina	acicula	 that is my reasoning too
2010-01-21T23:31:00.000Z	acicula	relina	all i know is that it defaults to the highest monitor settings it gets or whatever you have explicitly configured in the xorg.conf
