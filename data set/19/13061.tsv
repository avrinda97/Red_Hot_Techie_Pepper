2007-05-14T07:37:00.000Z	Srixon		Ok what would it be.. /usr/srixon
2007-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	Srixon		yes i get an error messege something like ./var  but i cannot remember i will check again and if this doesnt fix it i will write it down.
2007-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	Srixon		I changed the directory for the user files.
2007-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	Srixon		from /user/srixon or /usr/srixon i cant remember that
2007-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	Srixon		i dunno
2007-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	Srixon		its the base dir
2007-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	Srixon		Its whatever the basic directory is... Is it /user/srixon?  i just need to know if its /user or /usr or /home or what
2007-05-14T07:40:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	/home is the directory where all your personal config files are kept
2007-05-14T07:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	boot into single user mode then fix it and reboot
2007-05-14T07:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	choose recovery in the boot menu, or init 1 if you have a prompt
2007-05-14T07:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	also, do you get an error message?
2007-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	what exatly did you change?
2007-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	not /home/srixon?
2007-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	well you need to know what you changed to change it back
2007-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	i suggest you create a new user (adduser <username>) when you reach the recovery screen
2007-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Srixon	then go from there
