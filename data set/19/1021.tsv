2011-06-10T07:59:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	bigger concern is to make sure your partitions are aligned with the hard drives block size
2011-06-10T08:01:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	and how can I know that?
2011-06-10T08:03:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	the safest thing is to assume 4k block size and make sure that all partitions begin and end at multiples of 4096 bytes
2011-06-10T08:09:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	so... do I have problem with the partition sda3? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/623064/
2011-06-10T08:11:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	 23,841.75
2011-06-10T08:11:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	looks fine. thats a 500gb drive so it is probably 512byte blocks. i wouldn't worry
2011-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	thanks!
2011-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	parted and gparted are a bit smarter about warning about potential problems with newer disks
2011-06-10T08:16:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	does parted and gparted have a disk checker? I though that they only resize disks
2011-06-10T08:19:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	parted does everything fdisk does. people just use fdisk because they are more familiar with it because it is older, but that older heritage means it gives CHS warnings on LBA disks
2011-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	I didn't know that ;) I'll read more about parted
2011-06-10T08:27:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	can I ask you the last question?
2011-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	go ahead

2011-06-10T08:29:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	is it normal that partition 4 is not aligned?
2011-06-10T08:29:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	it's an extended
2011-06-10T08:30:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	in a optimal check... but in a minimal it say aligned
2011-06-10T08:30:00.000Z	escott	Kalvin	partition 4 is extended so there is no data in it. as long as the partitions inside it are aligned you should be fine, but since you have 500GB drive chances are that it is 512byte blocks and alignment doesn't matter
2011-06-10T08:32:00.000Z	Kalvin	escott	:) okey... thanks escott for your help
