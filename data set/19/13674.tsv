2005-02-12T14:19:00.000Z	paer		Anyone here knows where I should look for ways to get Firefox and Thunderbird in my local language (I choose swedish on installation of ubuntu, but my browser and thunderbird (which I installed later via apt-get) is in english.
2005-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	install mozilla-*-locale-se
2005-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	ah so I will need to do a apt-get remove firefox and remove mozilla-thunderbird first?
2005-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	no, they're just addons
2005-02-12T14:23:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	that will copy the bin-folder to /mnt/
2005-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	do you know where I should turn to offer my help to package it for ubuntu? is it a ubuntu-group that handles that, or is it the mozilla project?
2005-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	just use cp -a (as root): it will preserve times, symlinks, etc. and copy recursively
2005-02-12T14:25:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	ah, like cp -rp ?
2005-02-12T14:25:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	ubuntu-devel, I think
2005-02-12T14:25:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	ok thx i'll have a look
2005-02-12T14:25:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	yes. if you're copying a whole file system, cp -ax is the best way
2005-02-12T14:26:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	aha i've never seen either the -x or the -a options. nice to learn something :o)
2005-02-12T14:34:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	how did u get that entry in the menu?
2005-02-12T14:35:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	it's here in hoary... isn't in warty?
2005-02-12T14:35:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	not what I can see :o)
2005-02-12T14:35:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	but it sounds like a good idea. I can't wait for hoary to be stable.
2005-02-12T14:37:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	-a: include subdirs, etc. -x: skip other filesystems. -v: report progress
2005-02-12T14:37:00.000Z	danilo_	paer	just sudo nautilus in the meantime ;-)
2005-02-12T14:38:00.000Z	paer	danilo_	yep
