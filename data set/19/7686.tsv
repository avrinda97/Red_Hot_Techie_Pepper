2007-07-11T13:29:00.000Z	abhi		how do i convince my clients to use Ubuntu Server over RHEL?
2007-07-11T13:29:00.000Z	abhi		is Ubuntu server as capable?
2007-07-11T13:31:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	I've never really used RHEL, but depending on what sort of server you're building (web, svn, media, flash, combination) I've done most all of those with Ubuntu and NEVER had a box come down -- except when I forget to pay the power.
2007-07-11T13:32:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	Ugh, you mean the MS 'make money off of linux' scare scheme?
2007-07-11T13:32:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	yea
2007-07-11T13:32:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	they believe MS and Novell and RH
2007-07-11T13:32:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	not debian or ubuntu
2007-07-11T13:33:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	Well, power to the corporations, I suppose. :( You can pay for support from Canonical, if they need the corporate handholding.
2007-07-11T13:33:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	I would rather pay for support from Canonical than rent my server.
2007-07-11T13:35:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	I think DEVELOPMENT on Ubuntu or Debian (or even Fedora) is better because of the things like this IRC channel -- it's so much quicker to get help.
2007-07-11T13:35:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	But that doesn't necessarily convice a client, just developers.
2007-07-11T13:36:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	we use Ubuntu for development
2007-07-11T13:36:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	but during deployment
2007-07-11T13:37:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	they want SuSE or RHEL
2007-07-11T13:37:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	we do LAP not M :) we use O instead or PG
2007-07-11T13:38:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	it's such a pain to migrate to SuSE or RHEL
2007-07-11T13:38:00.000Z	abhi	josh_marshall	SuSE has to be the most painful
2007-07-11T13:39:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	Kay kay. Well, as long as you aren't doing WAP, I'll be okay. :) Windows + PHP +  Apache = Aneurysm
2007-07-11T13:40:00.000Z	josh_marshall	abhi	I've actually not done much with Suse -- once you go APT, you never go back.
