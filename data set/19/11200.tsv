2008-08-17T21:17:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	All vmware tools installed.
2008-08-17T21:17:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	have you got the vmware tools installed in the Ubuntu vm?
2008-08-17T21:19:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	you can then mount the host filesystem via hgfs -- much faster than network filesharing
2008-08-17T21:19:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	how?
2008-08-17T21:19:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	I'll need a minute to dig it out
2008-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	you need a line like ".host:/ /mnt/hgfs vmhgfs defaults,ttl=5 0 0' in /etc/fstab. VMware tools installation normally sets that up for you.
2008-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	when I use Places to browse Network Servers, the Mac shows up along with all other machines that are in my local network.
2008-08-17T21:22:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	you can mount those, too, but direct mounting is faster and more reliable
2008-08-17T21:22:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	I do have /mnt/hgfs, but nothing there.
2008-08-17T21:22:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	what about the line in /etc/fstab?
2008-08-17T21:23:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	not in /etc/fstab. I´ll add and see what happens.
2008-08-17T21:24:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	when you've added it, you should run 'sudo mount /mnt/hgfs'
2008-08-17T21:26:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	it should also be possible to drag and drop files from the Mac desktop to the Ubuntu desktop
2008-08-17T21:30:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	mount command didn´t work. ¨No such filesystem¨. And I can drag and drop files, but what I want is a link.
2008-08-17T21:31:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	you haven't fully set up vmware tools then. Mind, for hardy you need the beta version of the open-source vmware tools.
2008-08-17T21:32:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	the only vmware tools I have came with the ubuntu for the Mac.
2008-08-17T21:32:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	you need to download the opensource ones from the web
2008-08-17T21:33:00.000Z	jcarter	soundray	I went there some time ago, but got really confused as to what to download. I´ll look again.
2008-08-17T21:34:00.000Z	soundray	jcarter	a guy called Peter Cooper wrote a howto. You'll find it on Google
