2008-06-28T09:59:00.000Z	Tweaker		Hello
2008-06-28T09:59:00.000Z	Tweaker		I was wondering about something
2008-06-28T09:59:00.000Z	Tweaker		My camera seems to mess up with ubuntu. The pictures are all messed up
2008-06-28T09:59:00.000Z	Tweaker		like it slides the picture around
2008-06-28T09:59:00.000Z	Tweaker		like a puzzle
2008-06-28T10:00:00.000Z	Tweaker		Anyways, how would I fix this problem?
2008-06-28T10:01:00.000Z	Tweaker		Seriously
2008-06-28T10:01:00.000Z	Tweaker		I need help wtf...
2008-06-28T10:02:00.000Z	Tweaker		ok then...
2008-06-28T10:02:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	  you may want to give some more details like. What kind of camera, and perhapas post one of the images somewhere. so others can see exactly whats going on, and perhaps a screen shot.
2008-06-28T10:03:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 so you are refering to a 'photo' camera' not a web cam. :)
2008-06-28T10:03:00.000Z	Tweaker	dr_Willis	 That would be correct
2008-06-28T10:05:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 weird. - Not sure what would be causing that. The thing does work properly under other OS's ?
2008-06-28T10:05:00.000Z	Tweaker	dr_Willis	 Yes it works fine under windows, so I do not understand why it wouldn't work on Ubuntu
2008-06-28T10:07:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 try some other Live Linux cds see if it also goofs up under them. That way you can tell if its a Ubuntu Specific issue, or more of a Linux Specific issue.
2008-06-28T10:08:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 other then that - i got no idea as to a fix.  Trouble shooting is about the best help i can offer.
2008-06-28T12:35:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 install the other linux to different partitions, pick ONE os to controll grub. and edit the grub menu configs adding the other OS to it.
2008-06-28T12:38:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 You proberly should learn/read up on grub. befor doing the install of pclinux..  set up part of the hd as unallocated.  boot pclinux, let its installer install to the drives.. backup the pclinux grub menu.lst soemwhere you can find it.. and then compare the 2 from ubuntu and pclinux.  You will most likely have to do a bit of cut/pasteing from oneto the other to get both os's booting properly
2008-06-28T12:39:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Tweaker	 normally i install the other os;s first. then ubuntu last.  that way the other os's dont make it a pain to boot to ubuntu
