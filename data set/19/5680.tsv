2008-09-28T22:31:00.000Z	^paradox^		im trying to share the printer an hp psc 1110 over a network with two computers. the computer the printers hooked up to is a windows vista home pc. im trying to share it to this pc running ubuntu 8.04.
2008-09-28T22:31:00.000Z	^paradox^		ive installed samba, samba-common, smbfs. ive configured it and set the vista pc to share files and printers. the printer receives test pages sent to it but doesnt print them. they show up in the job list saying spooling and the printer physically tries to print them, but to no effect.

2008-10-02T21:38:00.000Z	jim_p	^paradox^	i dont know if you tried this, but can you give hplip a shot?
