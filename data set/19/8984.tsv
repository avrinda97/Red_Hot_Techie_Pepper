2007-03-31T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	nautilus will launch if you have it managing your desktop
2007-03-31T05:44:00.000Z	DesertEagle	jrib	but i don't like it, i want ROX instead
2007-03-31T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	do you want your desktop to have icons?
2007-03-31T05:44:00.000Z	DesertEagle	jrib	nope :D
2007-03-31T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	the go to gconf-editor and tell nautilus not to "show_desktop" in /apps/nautilus somewhere
2007-03-31T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	I just told you how
2007-03-31T05:46:00.000Z	DesertEagle	jrib	no i mean not having nautilus at all
2007-03-31T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	yeah, don't run it
2007-03-31T05:46:00.000Z	DesertEagle	jrib	but i'm not trying to :(
2007-03-31T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	so you mean a nautilus window opens up when you log in?
2007-03-31T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	is it in ~/.gnome2/session?
2007-03-31T05:48:00.000Z	DesertEagle	jrib	lemme check
2007-03-31T05:56:00.000Z	DesertEagle	jrib	nope, i don't even have a sessions file
2007-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	DesertEagle	look on the side of your desk
