2012-10-21T07:52:00.000Z	ahmad		anyone here familiar with distributed data services and openstack, hadoop, etc?
2012-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	ahmad		can anyone suggest the best utility for creating a ubuntu 12.10 amd64 start up disk from within ubuntu 12.04 ?
2012-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	ahmad		i tried usb start disk creator but it failed
2012-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	ahmad		oh i need it for dual boot with windows boot manager
2012-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	ahmad		i am going to try unebootin
2012-10-21T07:57:00.000Z	ahmad		i tried it within windows last time and it failed :| but
2012-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	doing the consistancy check is super important... I have wasted a lot of time trying to install off of a bad disk
2012-10-21T07:59:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	I dont know how to do it on the graphical install, but usually there is an option to just test it
2012-10-21T08:00:00.000Z	ahmad	bretolius	perhaps in gParted there is a way or fstab.. i will investigate :D
2012-10-21T08:01:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	i know in the text installer for 12.04 you can just test it right in the first menu you are shown, I would look around the live CD for 12.10 if thats the version you are using (since there is not text based installer for that version)
2012-10-21T08:06:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	I dont know anything about those programs, but given the fact that what they do is not trivially explained in their wikipedia page, I suspect they are quite complex.  I would look for a good tutorial and introductory resources via google
2012-10-21T08:09:00.000Z	ahmad	bretolius	thnx.. i have been doing that and gotten very good at it so far just wish i had someone to help me with my deployment.. np though google and i are lovers :P lol
2012-10-21T08:13:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	So much jargon, so little practical example of what it all means (Not what you are saying, but how those projects talk about themselves).
2012-10-21T08:16:00.000Z	ahmad	bretolius	yes thats why this research is hard.. the release of the openstack folsom confuses me even more :s
2012-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	have you tried over at the #openstack channel?
2012-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	ahmad	bretolius	no :D ty i will do that right now!
2012-10-21T08:40:00.000Z	ahmad	bretolius	lol it honestly did not occur to me.. ty (its a bit late here i have been up for a while)
2012-10-21T08:40:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	yeah, np I understand
2012-10-21T08:40:00.000Z	bretolius	ahmad	glhf :)
