2008-03-26T14:07:00.000Z	ai3gtmc		mp3 to wma
2008-03-26T14:07:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	ffmpeg ought to be able to do it
2008-03-26T14:08:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	unop	how do i use it?
2008-03-26T14:09:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	its a command line too --  ffmpeg -i file.mp3 file.wma
2008-07-26T08:25:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	you need to setup networking for the vmware guest - http://www.vmware.com/support/ws3/doc/ws32_network8.html
2008-07-26T08:26:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	that is the way to restart networking.
2008-07-26T08:29:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	dhclient ?
2008-07-26T08:29:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	unop	yeah something like that
2008-07-26T08:29:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	sudo dhclient eth0
2008-07-26T08:33:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	have you checked the vmware guest configuration -- you have to ensure that guest has the capability to get on the phycial network. something like this here. http://www.vmware.com/support/ws3/doc/ws32_network8.html
2008-07-31T16:52:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	make sure all processes that have files/directories open on that device are properly terminated first
2008-07-31T16:54:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	but you can't really dismount a device until all processes that are using files on it have been closed.
2008-07-31T16:54:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	to find out what process might have files open.  sudo lsof | grep -i $DEVICE_NAME
2008-07-31T16:55:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	it's ok to dismount it if it is done properly
2008-07-31T16:55:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	don't dismount it if files are still being accessed on it
2008-07-31T18:57:00.000Z	unop	ai3gtmc	how are you launching gparted there?
