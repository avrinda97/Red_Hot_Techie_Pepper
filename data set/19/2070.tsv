2010-07-20T03:38:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	15yrs here. =)
2010-07-20T03:39:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	everyone has different hardware and does things a bit different if they "know what they are doing". remember, alot of folks that come here are new to ubuntu
2010-07-20T03:40:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 i agree with that everyone that comes here is new to ubuntu  but what works works and whatdoes not  don't \
2010-07-20T03:41:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	so if it doesn't work for you it doesn't work for anyone?
2010-07-20T03:43:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 i  work on computers everyday and the rate of success for dual boot is about 19 percent
2010-07-20T03:44:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	I understand as I do to. but, you had an issue and I don't have that issue. I have 150 engineers dual booting centos, ubuntu, and some of our custom linux distros all without issue. so again, for 1 to say it doesn't work because they had an issue and it won't work for others just doesn't make any sense to me.
2010-07-20T03:47:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 i  agree some what but i would rather tell someone no instead of yes and have them lose there os and files
2010-07-20T03:48:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	agreed, I wouldn't want someone to lose anything. and not for dual booting. I would say run a local vm instead.
2010-07-20T03:49:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 yep vm or run live cd
2010-07-20T03:58:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	what's up?
2010-07-24T02:12:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	I did it from 9:10 to 10.04 64bit, and it all went just fine (for me that is). but I agreed, a clean install is much easier in the long run.
2010-07-24T02:13:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 yes some go ok but itis so much easier to just backup and do a fresh yes
2010-07-24T02:14:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	yea new installs are much nicer to support than upgrades with system settings and prefs setup by and end user. that's a headache.
2010-07-24T02:16:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 its a continuance thing probally before this line is over there will be one  > i upgradedfrom 9.10 to 10.04 and now i can not boot watch
2010-07-24T02:16:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	You so know it. =)
2010-07-24T02:56:00.000Z	hiexpo	^peanut^	 yea need build es
2010-07-24T02:57:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	cool, ty man.
2010-08-06T06:30:00.000Z	^peanut^	hiexpo	oh...hehe
