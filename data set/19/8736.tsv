2007-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	eck		the operative word there being 'usually' -- mplayer is the best :-)
2007-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	eck		mplayer has support for codecs not in vlc (or did over the summer)
2007-03-11T08:53:00.000Z	eck		specifically it had support for AMR before vlc
2007-03-11T08:54:00.000Z	lisapc	eck	how I install mplayer and all codecs?
2007-03-11T08:54:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	just get mplayer and vlc and try them both
2007-03-11T08:54:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	you can remove one of them later on
2007-03-11T08:54:00.000Z	lisapc	eck	ok
2007-03-11T08:58:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	it's called nautilus
2007-03-11T08:58:00.000Z	lisapc	eck	does it come preinstalled?
2007-03-11T08:58:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	yes, of course :-)
2007-03-11T08:58:00.000Z	lisapc	eck	 where? :)
2007-03-11T08:59:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	it's integrated with gnome -- if you click the places thign and open a place it will launch nautilus
2007-03-17T12:08:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	easiest way might be to apt-get build-dep something that depends on them, there are a lot
2007-03-17T12:08:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	they are mostly named libX*-dev
2007-03-17T12:08:00.000Z	lisapc	eck	when I try to ./configure ktorrent, it says: checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X libraries. Please check your installation and add the correct paths!    What can I do?
2007-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	is ktorrent in universe? if so try apt-get build-dep ktorrent
2007-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	lisapc	eck	i cant as its old.  i got the latest version from website
2007-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	that's ok, this is just for the libraries
2007-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	eck	lisapc	the X11 dependencies and so forth are probably the same
