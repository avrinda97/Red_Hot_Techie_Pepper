2004-12-04T07:58:00.000Z	WildCode		I'm having problems installing ubuntu 4.10, I get unmet dependencies when installing the base system in with the dependancy being modutils (which apparently isn't installed and isn't going to be)
2004-12-04T07:58:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	how are you installing it?
2004-12-04T08:00:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	dunno about md5, but the burning software I used said the cd was fine and matched the image it used
2004-12-04T08:01:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	the image and/or cd may be corrupted
2004-12-04T08:01:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	you should check the md5sum of the image, at the very least
2004-12-04T08:08:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	md5sum matches whats on the ubuntu site, so what do you suggest ... is there anyway to force it to install modutils ...
2004-12-04T08:11:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	if the cd is correct, then there shouldn't be any problems between the packages at all
2004-12-04T08:11:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	are you sure you got the warty cd? what steps are you going through?
2004-12-04T08:15:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	boot from the cd, setup the partition, letting it know I'm an aussie, choosing my keyboard, then let it do its thing, it then comes up with a message saying that the installation has failed during installing the base system, and to check console 3 for info .. trying to go
2004-12-04T08:17:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	confirmed: cd fine as well ... ripped image from cd, md5sum'd it, compared it to the image I have and to the md5sum listed on the ubuntu site. All match
2004-12-04T08:18:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	and yes, its the warty cd -> warty-release-install-i386.iso
2004-12-04T08:19:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	failure during base system. badness.
2004-12-04T08:19:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	what kinda machine?
2004-12-04T08:20:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	athlon xp 2400 ... 1gig ram, 120 gig total hdd space ... radeon 9600 xt (256megs) ...
2004-12-04T08:35:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	gigabyte mb .. network card (which the installer detected correctly)
2004-12-04T08:35:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	hrm. weird.
2004-12-04T08:35:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	I didn't do anything fancy, I just followed the steps the installer took ...
2004-12-04T08:35:00.000Z	WildCode	jdub	any suggestions?
2004-12-04T08:35:00.000Z	jdub	WildCode	no, perhaps when Kamion is around, he can help you (UK time)
