2009-12-26T20:26:00.000Z	sunil		my pc in not supporting ubuntu to install
2009-12-26T20:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 give the channel details about what it is and is not doing.
2009-12-26T20:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 yes tell the Channel *us*  the details of the problem
2009-12-26T20:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 just state the actual problem in detail
2009-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 you can start the installer for the new versions and tell them to format/repartition/delete the old filesystems
2009-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 or use some partioning tool and delete them befor starting the installer.
2009-12-26T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 you need to be carefull what partitions you delete.. Unless you used a WUBI type install.
2009-12-26T20:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 You should proberly go read up on how drive partitions are laid out and how to delete/change them. look for gparted tutorials, . Or  rerun the ubuntu installer and carefully tell it to delet  the linux partitions and not the windows ones.
2009-12-26T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 the partioning part iof the installer has a custome option that lets you do most anything. it will let you delete your windows system if you are not carfull.  assign / to the location of the old install and tell it to reformat. is one way to do it
2009-12-26T20:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 did you 'boot the cd' and install linux? or did you install linux from within windows?
2010-01-02T09:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 ive never seen much of a need for 'realplayer' every realplayer file ive ever found i could play in vlc or mplayer.
2010-01-02T09:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 and mplayer and vlc are in the repos.
2010-01-02T09:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 and the w32codecs pack from medibuntu may be needed as well
2010-02-13T18:53:00.000Z	sunil	Dr_Willis	I am new to irc
2010-02-13T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 So?
2010-02-13T18:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 in theory, right click,, use the shareing option. but i never do it that way
2010-02-13T18:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sunil	 fire up package manager.. look for and install 'samba'
2010-02-13T18:57:00.000Z	sunil	Dr_Willis	thanks
