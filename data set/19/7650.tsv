2007-10-30T12:06:00.000Z	shane		Hello, I rebooted - but the problem I see is that NTFS-config cant see all my NTFS drives. When I run the program it asks me do I want to add a list of NTFS disks for write support. However only one of my three internal NTFS IDE disks shows up?
2007-10-30T12:06:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	are you dual booting?
2007-10-30T12:07:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	Im not duel booting, but I do have a version of Vista installed on one of the disks, no duel booting though.
2007-10-30T12:07:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	Like its an old version I just havnt formatted.
2007-10-30T12:09:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	It produced no results, but it didnt ask for a password like sudo normally does? Just returned to the terminal.
2007-10-30T12:09:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	Is it possible that, NTFS-Config doesnt support Vista NTFS?
2007-10-30T12:10:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	would be news to me.
2007-10-30T12:10:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	where those drives hooked up when you installed linux?
2007-10-30T12:10:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	Doubtful
2007-10-30T12:10:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	you have to add them to fstab
2007-10-30T12:10:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	Well I can see them and read from them, just not write to them.
2007-10-30T12:11:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	How do I add them to fstab?
2007-10-30T12:11:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	ah.
2007-10-30T12:11:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	I'm not sure
2007-10-30T12:12:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	I will google it. It seems I have three IDE NTFS hard disks, and can see them all, but can only write to the one which was formatted in XP. The two others were formatted in Vista, perhaps NTFS-config doesnt quite recognise Vista partitiains. I will just search if others have the same trouble.
2007-10-30T12:16:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	Hey, sorry to bother you again, could you just tell me how to reinstalled the ntfs config tool?
2007-10-30T12:17:00.000Z	shane	MilitantPotato	sudo get-apt ntfs-config doesnt seem to work, but I know im close.
2007-10-30T12:17:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	through terminal it's sudo apt-get remove ntfs-config && install ntfs-config
2007-10-30T12:17:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	shane	or use synaptic and just right click it, do re-install.
