2008-02-18T09:52:00.000Z	n8tuser		jbinder--> typically runlevel 1 is no gui (X) , no network, level 3 has X
2008-02-18T09:53:00.000Z	n8tuser		jbinder--> on ubuntu 2-5 is same levels
2008-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	n8tuser		jbinder--> before you can get gui, X has to be installed..or framebuffer (i think)
2008-02-18T09:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		verma--> for which development tools?
2008-02-18T09:57:00.000Z	n8tuser		verma--> i assume if you install build-essential  will install man pages
2008-02-18T09:58:00.000Z	n8tuser		prettyricky--> umm this is not amsn support, tried reading their register page?
2008-02-18T10:00:00.000Z	n8tuser		prettyricky--> get on to their web site for registering and there should be instructions
2008-02-18T10:00:00.000Z	n8tuser		Tazbobu--> you either use /etc/hosts or the name server
2008-02-18T10:01:00.000Z	n8tuser		prettyricky--> sowee not too helpful
2008-02-18T10:02:00.000Z	n8tuser		bmeynell--> what about the existing data on it? okay to trash it?
2008-02-18T10:03:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	yeah, i can kill everything on it... i have all my important files from windows on my linux partition now
2008-02-18T10:04:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	if I merge is all my linux data trashed?
2008-02-18T10:06:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	so the question is how to turn the windows partition into linux... is there a simple command or ?
2008-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	ok cool... i want to keep my linux data and turn my windows partition into a linux partition so to do that I run 'fdisk'
2008-02-18T10:08:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	and how will the change affect GRUB?
2008-02-18T10:09:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	i don't  believe so.... but i don't know for sure... GRUB runs right after the BIOS runs and lists all my linux installations and my windows boot option at the bottom of the list
2008-02-18T10:12:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	it says windows xp is at "root     (hd0,1)"
2008-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	so I'm good to go? you agree?
2008-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	bmeynell	n8tuser	thanks
