2011-09-20T17:50:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	yes, but you have to extract it, and then repack it...
2011-09-20T17:51:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	if you just need install more apps, you can use uck tool, it uses to change liveCD
2011-09-20T17:52:00.000Z	nmvictor	Stanley00	i need to go to the /sys directory in the filesystem and change something
2011-09-20T17:53:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	then, you have to extract and repack it manually...
2011-09-20T17:54:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	you may need to install "squashfs-tools - Tool to create and append to squashfs filesystems" to do that

2011-09-20T17:59:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	ok, please wait, I'm reading it...
2011-09-20T18:02:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	hmm, /sys is not an usual directory, I'm confusing now...
2011-09-20T18:04:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	it's contain nothing until it is mount with type sysfs, so I doubt if you can modify it?
2011-09-20T18:04:00.000Z	nmvictor	Stanley00	Ouch, that hutrs
2011-09-20T18:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	Stanley00	How else can I ever change the default brightness value for my computer?
2011-09-20T18:06:00.000Z	nmvictor	Stanley00	actually, for ubuntu, as it boots. After I select the "Try Ubuntu" option, the screen deems to almost 0. So i was hoping to adjust the brightness from withing the file system.
2011-09-20T18:06:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	does your USB persistence?
2011-09-20T18:07:00.000Z	nmvictor	Stanley00	what?

2011-09-20T18:15:00.000Z	Stanley00	nmvictor	I think some tricks are needed here, like an init script, or so...
