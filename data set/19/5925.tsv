2009-04-04T08:33:00.000Z	mountainma1		installed system updates, system restart required. now cannot boot computer--setup and boot menu's stall--cannot access command prompt, any ideas?
2009-04-04T08:34:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	are you using ubuntu 9.04?
2009-04-04T08:35:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	- no, hardy heron i think...unless it was updating to 9.04
2009-04-04T08:35:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	well it doesn't by default, did you click to upgrade to a new release?
2009-04-04T08:36:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	no, just upgrades.  i usually do new distro's from scratch
2009-04-04T08:37:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	when you boot you are prompted with several kernel options, did you try "recovery console" ?
2009-04-04T08:38:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	no i get the DELL screen, and it shows progress bar and stalls at last little bit.  If I use F2, F12 for Setup or Boot Menu--it stalls further
2009-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	reboot it, and press "Esc" every second or so
2009-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	ok, at boot:
2009-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	it will show up the boot options, where you can choose the recovery option, at least to debug what went wrong :)
2009-04-04T08:41:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	- it takes me to "The default installation issuitable for....and a boot:  "
2009-04-04T08:42:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	is this hardy heron downloaded from ubuntu.com or is it a dell pre-installed image?
2009-04-04T08:43:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	I assume the dell pre-installed image that came with the Windows before I started using linux on it??
2009-04-04T08:44:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	ok, that's fine :) I'm out of ideas though, try filing a bug report at http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug
2009-04-04T08:45:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	sorry, http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug
2009-04-04T08:45:00.000Z	mountainma1	savvas	so you don't know how i can boot from the "boot:  " command line?
2009-04-04T08:47:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	nope, I don't know  your version of linux kernel nor where it is installed :\
2009-04-04T08:48:00.000Z	mountainma1		Linux updates have left me unable to load system --help anyone?
2009-04-04T08:48:00.000Z	savvas	mountainma1	if you are prompted with an option and it allows you to edit it, remove "ro quiet splash" and replace it with "ro single"
