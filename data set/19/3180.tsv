2009-10-10T20:16:00.000Z	Edo		Who knows how to setup a crossover cable between ubuntu and XP with out using network manager
2009-10-10T20:17:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	why would you want to do that?
2009-10-10T20:21:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	any ideas for getting the two communicating over the crossover?
2009-10-10T20:27:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	pastbin?
2009-10-10T20:28:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	not enuff you also need the gateway settings, pls use a pastebin to post your network layout,
2009-10-10T20:30:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	I'll give the gateway a shot
2009-10-10T20:38:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	http://pastebin.com/d123539b
2009-10-10T20:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	-> gateway for crossover should be the ip of the other end box
2009-10-10T20:47:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	changed the gateway, still nothing it seems
2009-10-10T20:47:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	-> whats the gateway?
2009-10-10T20:48:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	 ubuntu: gw:192.168.0.1;    xp: gw:192.168.0.2
2009-10-10T20:49:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	-> now try the ping to test
2009-10-10T20:51:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	nothing, but I jsut noticed something! it seems my xp can ping itself, but the ubuntu box can't
2009-10-10T20:52:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	->  i have been requesting a network layout drawing , can you do this and post it?
2009-10-10T20:55:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	network layout? like a ascii drawing or ..... sorry I' a little slow on that
2009-10-10T20:56:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	where its easier for us to distinguish which box is which and how they are interconnected,  a picture is worht a thousand words
2009-10-10T20:56:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	I'll do my best
2009-10-10T21:14:00.000Z	Edo	n8tuser	http://edo.bemaniso.ws/network.jpg
2009-10-10T21:34:00.000Z	n8tuser	Edo	okay dont try to have your host have two paths to get to same destinations,
