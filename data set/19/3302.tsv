2009-09-16T19:46:00.000Z	elad`		Never mind, new question - how do I check a HDD for defects? Bad sectors?
2009-09-16T19:47:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	apt-get install smartmontools
2009-09-16T19:49:00.000Z	elad`	johnT	That looks like it has something to do with mail.
2009-09-16T20:02:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	I suggest you this brief lecture http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_remanence
2009-09-16T19:54:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	why zero your hd? if your concern are bad sectors, simply do a complete format
2009-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	elad`	johnT	I'm taking it back to the store. I want to erase my data first.
2009-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	don't zero it then, it's highly unsafe
2009-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	elad`	johnT	Unsafe?!
2009-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	yeah, you need a WIPE, not a ZERo
2009-09-16T19:56:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	there is a 'wipe' packet
2009-09-16T19:58:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	try wipe btw
2009-09-16T19:59:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	it overwrites the data many times. takes a lot, but it is far more secure than a simple zero
2009-09-16T20:00:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	it depends on how much you are paranoid :)
2009-09-16T20:01:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	do you thing that 'multipass wiping' would exist if one single zero-pass would be sufficient? :)
2009-09-16T20:01:00.000Z	elad`	johnT	Yes. People are paranoid. Not all the facts make it all the way through to every person.
2009-09-16T20:03:00.000Z	elad`	johnT	Irrelevant. I didn't say deletion, I said overwriting with zeros.
2009-09-16T20:03:00.000Z	elad`	johnT	Meaning to say, once is quite enough.
2009-09-16T20:03:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	If you think so, then the /dev/zero suggestion you received is the quickest way
2009-09-16T20:04:00.000Z	johnT	elad`	let me suggest to use /dev/urandom at least
