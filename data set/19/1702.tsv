2010-12-31T04:34:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	thanks
2011-02-05T04:29:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	thanks, was going to ask howto do that
2011-02-11T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	its how the drivers/udev pickup the devices. You can mess with the OS to change it. afaik, network manager expects wlan0 but wicd is more flexible and allows you to specify the wireless interface name
2011-02-11T13:58:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	so the different hardware (Acer/HP) makes this difference? as far as i can tell, both netbooks are running almost exactly the same motherboard/cpu
2011-02-11T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	the interfaces file will always output the same thing as interfaces will only define the loopback device, the rest is managed (by default) by network manager
2011-02-11T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	the board and cpu are moot, its the wireless hardware which makes the difference, and the driver running it, thereof
2011-02-11T14:00:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	re /etc/network/interfaces => OK, ah the Acer runs an Atheros and the HP an Intel (I think)
2011-02-11T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	that's the difference then ;)
2011-02-11T14:00:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	thank you
2011-02-11T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	no worries dude
2011-02-11T14:01:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	interesting nick btw ... parsnip hahaha
2011-02-11T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	its a harry hill joke :)
2011-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	there is no one way, you can use:  apt-cache policy packagename
2011-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	k
2011-02-11T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	i call it left panel, not sure. If you mean this: http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/img/2010/05/ubuntu-unity.png then it's called unity afaik
2011-02-11T15:14:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	Unity => cool
2011-02-11T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokendatapoint	i find it clunky at first, it gets better with age. personally i prefer lxde
2011-02-11T15:15:00.000Z	brokendatapoint	ActionParsnip	not a bad call, this is on a friend's netbook, he asked for Win 7 to disappear and he now has Gnome Netbook on, I use Xfce4.4
