2008-11-30T19:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	ubuntunub	you should see two panels, one at the top and one at the bottom
2008-11-30T19:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	ubuntunub	along with your desktop wallpaper
2008-11-30T19:13:00.000Z	ubuntunub	ardchoille	when putting in username/password tehir is a button called settings, then a option which says something like log in session, then they have some options>>>>> like last seccsion, run xscript, gnome, failutere terminal and such
2008-11-30T19:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	ubuntunub	you usually don't need to even touch those things.
