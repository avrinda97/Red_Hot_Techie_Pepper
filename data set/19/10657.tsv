2006-05-29T06:42:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	Dunno, I just turned on my serverpc, which I use irssi on now
2006-05-29T06:42:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	I did that command, and it gave me an error, then told me to do this:
2006-05-29T06:43:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	So, is that good?
2006-05-29T06:43:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	well, we shall see
2006-05-29T06:44:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	 my dpkg manpage does not have either of the options you listed
2006-05-29T06:45:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	Anywho, I shall be up in ~20 mins. That's how long I had left of the upgrade, so I shall estimate that's what time it'll take. It was apt-get update that told me to do that manually, as it couldn't for some reason.
2006-05-29T06:46:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	ok
2006-05-29T07:08:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	Hey

2006-05-29T07:08:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	to upgrade follow it with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-05-29T07:09:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	I did it =)
2006-05-29T07:09:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	good luck :)
2006-05-29T07:10:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	Thanks =) Argh, stupid server room... My server is in my sisters 'closet room', and she just throws stuff all over the place. I just cut open my knee on a peice of metal on the floor whilst kneeling at my server.....
2006-05-29T07:12:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	ouch!  One must be careful when coming out of the closet.  ;)
2006-05-29T07:13:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	It's just a room, but she throws all her stuff in here. It seems it was a PC chassis side door, that she has moved from my stack of neatly packed stuff ;) Put that under a towel, and you have yourself a murderweapon 0_o
2006-05-29T07:18:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	I found my X problem
2006-05-29T07:19:00.000Z	another_lemur	nox-Hand	and is it all sorted out>
2006-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	nox-Hand	another_lemur	Now it is. Wow, I just entered GNOME. I heard they made it quicker somehow, but this much?! :o
