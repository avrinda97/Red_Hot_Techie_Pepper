2008-03-16T10:31:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Just checked the 7zip page... abosultely totally supports tbz files
2008-03-16T10:33:00.000Z	zcat[1]		and for .net coders, #c# ?
2008-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	meh, maybe ##mono
2008-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	or ##csharp apparently
2008-08-26T20:19:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	import from imagemagick
2008-09-02T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	stderr probably won't get caught that way though
2008-09-03T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	they would still be confused
2009-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	pastebin: echo $http_proxy $ftp_proxy
2009-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	duh!
2009-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	you probably installed some proxy and it set that in /etc/environment (or somewhere else)
2009-05-25T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	*where*?
2009-05-25T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	did you reboot since?
2009-05-25T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	did you reboot since?
2009-05-25T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	no problem
2009-06-16T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	probably because mozilla asks them to
2010-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	are you using a strange font?
2010-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	jrib	 I tried a whole bunch of different strange fonts, none of them seem to include those characters
2010-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	jrib	zcat[1]	you tried deja vu ?
2010-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	jrib	 I have a feeling I tried that font before...
