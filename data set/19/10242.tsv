2006-07-08T13:42:00.000Z	fats`		to check if it's running, if not, run it?
2006-07-08T13:44:00.000Z	fats`		I'm just more accustomed to VNC
2006-07-08T13:44:00.000Z	fats`		I don't know, it's a comfortability thing
2006-07-08T13:45:00.000Z	fats`		Is there a guide on how to forward x via ssh?
2006-07-08T13:45:00.000Z	fats`		on the wiki or something?
2006-07-08T13:45:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	happens automaticllay with ssh
2006-07-08T14:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	will run, just not with gnome
2006-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	DSL maybe?
2006-07-08T14:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	which card?
2006-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	Netgear 511 should be no problem
2006-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	fats`	frogzoo	- oh?
2006-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	seems it runs with the tulip driver - at the worst, you'll need to compile the kernel module
2006-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	fats`	frogzoo	- yeah, that's something I'm not familiar with
2006-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	but this card is like 4 years old, ordinarily anything that old is well supported by now
2006-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	fats`	frogzoo	- you might be able to help me with my other problem.. I want to keep my vnc server running after logging out of my gnome session(So I can log back in when I feel like it). Or atleast be able to start the vnc session via SSH
2006-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	I'm guessing try the man page
2006-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	fats`	frogzoo	- did you get that question?
2006-07-08T14:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	fats`	don't use vnc, so unless someone in chan knows, try the man page
