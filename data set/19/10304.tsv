2006-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	Trying to install X with Synaptic? What a great idea
2006-06-30T07:11:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	agreed.
2006-06-30T05:49:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	I have found an out of date one
2006-06-30T05:49:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	It screws up the networking if you use a new version of Qemu, so it is bad :(
2006-06-30T05:50:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	bah.. someone needs to write a new one
2006-06-30T05:50:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	I wrote a Bash script to select CD images and hard drives once
2006-06-30T05:51:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	With an accelerator maybe
2006-07-10T05:15:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	The Libre is important. If you think about it vista is Free at the moment
2006-07-10T05:16:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	but its not open source
2006-07-10T05:16:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	But surely "shared source" is even better? (joking, joking :) )
2006-07-10T05:16:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	I prefer FOSS.. but thats me :P
2006-07-10T08:34:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	doesn't wine stand for "WINE Is Not an Emulator" ?  ;)
2006-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	Yes, WINE is a reimplementation of the Windows APIs. Basically it makes Linux into a Windows compatible operating system
2006-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	I know, I was joking around ;)
2006-07-31T07:45:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	you need to get an access point :)
2006-07-31T07:46:00.000Z	Warbo	lophyte	I have a Wifi router, which I have lent to a mate (should be getting it back tomorrow, since I've found the book he lent me ages ago), but surely Linux can be set up as a server? That's where it's strength lies (and that would give me greater control for bandwidth limiting)
2006-07-31T07:46:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	you can't set up a Linux PC as an access point, as far as I know
2006-07-31T07:48:00.000Z	lophyte	Warbo	yup.
