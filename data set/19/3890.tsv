2010-04-09T21:15:00.000Z	Curly_Q	FallenSparrow	is your box a single partition or do you have separate logical partitions? That should answer your question.
2010-04-09T21:16:00.000Z	FallenSparrow		i only have pysical partitions
2010-04-09T21:16:00.000Z	Curly_Q		One?
2010-04-09T21:16:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Two?
2010-04-09T21:17:00.000Z	FallenSparrow	arand	filedoes nto exist
2010-04-09T21:17:00.000Z	Curly_Q	FallenSparrow	If you have a single partition for your box, that is your mistake. It is best to segregate the hard drive by dividing logically partitions for Windows and Linux.
2010-04-09T21:18:00.000Z	FallenSparrow		no i have a partition for linux and one for windows, as well as one for linux swap i am sorry
2010-04-09T21:18:00.000Z	Curly_Q		You told us something else earlier.
2010-04-09T21:18:00.000Z	Curly_Q		OK.
2010-04-09T21:19:00.000Z	Curly_Q		So now did you install Windows first on your DUAL boot system or Linux?
2010-04-09T21:19:00.000Z	FallenSparrow		windows first curly
2010-04-09T21:20:00.000Z	FallenSparrow		wow....i think that is it
2010-04-09T21:21:00.000Z	Curly_Q	FallenSparrow	I see. Windows has the propensity to take over the MBR, ie. Master Boot Record. Linux puts its own stuff where it wants.
