2009-03-12T06:44:00.000Z	Cotowar_		i dont have the IP's linked to mac addresses
2009-03-12T06:45:00.000Z	Cotowar_		it just assigns the first available address to whoever connects.
2009-03-12T06:45:00.000Z	Cotowar_		i know what i should be doing, but it is not doing that. that is my headache...lol
2009-03-12T06:46:00.000Z	Cotowar_		i have infinite leases, so i never get a new address if i leave and come back. the thing is, if i leave and someone gets on before i come back, they get my address.
2009-03-12T06:46:00.000Z	Cotowar_		my old address*
2009-03-12T06:47:00.000Z	Cotowar_		right now i am  192.168.2.2. if i leave, and my dad connects, he will get the .2 address, and i will get 192.168.2.3. does that make sense?
2009-03-12T06:48:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Cotowar_	use a large lease time like a year or so
2009-03-12T06:48:00.000Z	Cotowar_		its infinite. thats my point
2009-03-12T06:48:00.000Z	Cotowar_		i dont know why the hell its working like that
2009-03-12T06:49:00.000Z	Cotowar_		the lease never expires, or do i get a new lease if i leave and come back?
2009-03-12T06:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Cotowar_	you tell us, how is your dhcp server configured?
2009-03-12T06:50:00.000Z	Cotowar_	tritium	it is on topic. i can connect just fine in windows, its linux that has a problem
2009-03-12T06:50:00.000Z	Cotowar_		and i do have intrepid
2009-03-12T06:51:00.000Z	Cotowar_		im asking how i set myself a static IP in linux and still have it connect to the network
2009-03-12T06:51:00.000Z	Cotowar_		i dont want all my other boxes having static addresses though
2009-03-12T06:51:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Cotowar_	is ubuntu your router?
2009-03-12T06:51:00.000Z	Cotowar_		and if this is rally a problem, is there a better channel for me to be in?
2009-03-12T06:52:00.000Z	Cotowar_		no, but this is the admin computer
2009-03-12T06:52:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Cotowar_	try asking in #yourrouter
