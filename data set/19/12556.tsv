2005-08-23T10:02:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- msttcorefonts  includes the fonts themselves or just the tools to install them from another source (windows installation?)
2005-08-23T10:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	the fonts themselves
2005-08-23T10:03:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- Ah okay, thank you. - patents, patents, patents, - bah who needs 'em. - lol
2005-08-23T10:06:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- yeah sure.. NOW you tell me.... - lol
2005-08-23T10:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	actually, you've got a point, fonts themselves are hard/imposible to copyright - but you can still copyright the names and such...
2006-06-07T13:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	he's got 1Gb of real RAM, he shouldn't need swap
2006-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	XChat has spellcheck?
2006-06-09T10:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	no idea
2006-06-15T11:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	6.06 is supposed to enable DMA automatically on all supported hardware - it did for me, when I did a re-install
2006-06-15T12:00:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- How old does your machine have to be to NOT support DMA?
2006-06-15T12:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	pretty old, from what I've heard
2006-06-15T12:10:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	try to install Mplayer. It's dependency hell. synaptic makes you jump through a bunch of hoops like that one. "Will not be installed"
2006-06-15T12:44:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- Is there any way to reclaim a forgotten password?
2006-06-15T12:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	no idea
2006-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- The gnome taskbar crashed with a video resolution change in WINE.  All  of the icons moved to a small space on the right.  Including the "Applications" "Places" "System" . Can i edit a file to move them back?   Replacing them means their convenient labels disappear.
2006-06-15T13:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	iiiears	not sure - the standard three menus are in Add To Panel, though
2006-06-15T13:30:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- Okay. - Can i edit the gnome taskbar labels to say something like. "Great Apps" "My Empire" and "The inner Machinations"?  (Too Grandious? - NVM) - rofl
2006-06-15T13:33:00.000Z	iiiears	Madpilot	- I was joking. - seriously, Do you know where the gnome taskbar app. is located?
