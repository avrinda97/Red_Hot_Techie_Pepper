2012-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	ThothCastel		and I got the following error on the FOURTH command of the instructions :
2012-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	ThothCastel		Cannot open input file --unsupported
2012-10-19T19:46:00.000Z	ThothCastel		why is that happenning?
2012-10-19T19:47:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	paste the full command giving you the error
2012-10-19T19:48:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	the error indicates that it's trying to open a file named '--unsupported' i would check to make sure it has support for that particular flag
2012-10-19T19:49:00.000Z	ThothCastel	carlisle_	  right, appreciate your help, but being new to Linux I am not sure of what to do from here
2012-10-19T19:50:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	i am not familiar with this particular firmware, but what i mean by 'flag' are the options prefaced with either one or two hyphens
2012-10-19T19:50:00.000Z	ThothCastel	carlisle_	ok, thank you...
2012-10-19T19:55:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	what happened when you ran 'sudo b43-fwcutter -h'
2012-10-19T19:56:00.000Z	ThothCastel	carlisle_	it shows me the following options:  -l      -i    -w    -v    -h
2012-10-19T19:57:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	i would say to try without the '--unsupported' flag
2012-10-19T19:58:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	try without '--unsupported'
2012-10-19T20:00:00.000Z	ThothCastel	carlisle_	 it throuws me a different error:    Sorry, the input file is either wrong or not supported by b43-fwcutter. This file has an unknown MD5Sum asdfrsdajsaklclas2as156d4as5dsa123
2012-10-19T20:02:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	im not sure what to tell you here because this seems like a specific issue with that utility
2012-10-19T20:02:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	did you give me the full output of -h before FloodBot1 mentioned using paste.ubuntu.com
2012-10-19T20:03:00.000Z	ThothCastel	carlisle_	I understand, thanks anyway, I am just trying to use Ubuntu as my main OS on my laptop inspiron 1525 but it doesn't come with the wireless driver   which it will probably be an issue as I need internet to work
2012-10-19T20:03:00.000Z	carlisle_	ThothCastel	yeah broadcom is a huge pain in the ass on linux
