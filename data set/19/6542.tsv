2009-02-23T14:00:00.000Z	eepberries		does su not work in ubuntu for switching to another user? i know you can't use it switch to root, but does it not work at all for any account?
2009-02-23T14:02:00.000Z	eepberries		isn't the only point of sudo to do a command as root though?
2009-02-23T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	correct
2009-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	it promotes your access for a single command
2009-02-23T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	i've not seen -u but its intruiging.
2009-02-23T14:13:00.000Z	eepberries	ActionParsnip	yeah, it doesn't really make sense, but i guess they had to replace su somehow
2009-02-23T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	sudo -i   instead of sudo su
2009-02-23T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	sudo -i configures the environment correctly
2009-02-23T14:14:00.000Z	eepberries	ActionParsnip	right, that's what i'm doing
2009-02-23T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	good lad
2009-02-23T14:31:00.000Z	eepberries	ActionParsnip	yogi_'s using an intel graphics chip, they should already be installed by default
2009-02-23T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	but they wont be autoconfigured in xorg.conf
2009-02-23T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	the driver files are sat on the system but are not being used by the system
2009-02-23T14:33:00.000Z	eepberries	ActionParsnip	what is that command supposed to do anyway
2009-02-23T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	not quite
2009-02-23T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	chown -R some <username> /path/to/thing
2009-02-23T14:43:00.000Z	eepberries	ActionParsnip	ActionParsnip: well, shear was trying to add ownership to a group
2009-02-23T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	he could see what group owns the folder and add hiimself to that group
2009-02-23T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eepberries	then chmod the folder to allow the group full access
