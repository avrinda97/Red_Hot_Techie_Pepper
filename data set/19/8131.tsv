2007-08-18T16:30:00.000Z	Prestidigita		anyone ?
2007-08-18T16:30:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	do you see them listed in lsusb?
2007-08-18T16:33:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	Yes it is listed under lsusb
2007-08-18T16:33:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	did you set your application to use the device, rather than your soundcard?
2007-08-18T16:34:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	no not really. I don't know how to do that.
2007-08-18T16:34:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	How can I do that ?
2007-08-18T16:34:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	its obviously application specific
2007-08-18T16:34:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	say if I want to watch flash videos in browser
2007-08-18T16:35:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	the speaker just doesn't work.
2007-08-18T16:35:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	do yu hear the audio through your soundcard?
2007-08-18T16:35:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	Yes. I have a head phone pluged in which works just fine
2007-08-18T16:36:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	then the sound card is the device being used for sound, not your speakers
2007-08-18T16:36:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	Any way to change the settings ?
2007-08-18T16:36:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	if the application doesnt let you choose, then you have to look online for answers, namely google
2007-08-18T16:36:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	works just fine with windows!
2007-08-18T16:37:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	thats almost insulting to say
2007-08-18T16:37:00.000Z	neverblue2	Prestidigita	good luck
2007-08-18T16:52:00.000Z	Prestidigita	neverblue2	I searched in the forums. Many other users are complaining about the same thing but no solutions :(
