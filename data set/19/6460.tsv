2008-09-05T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	they're all ide, you mean pata (just nit picking)
2008-09-05T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	is the pata controller enabled??
2008-09-05T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	in bios
2008-09-05T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	yeah if its disabled in bios you wont see devices attatched to it
2008-09-05T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	you could also try loading bios defaults
2008-09-05T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	is iy a new motherboard?
2008-09-05T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	could be faulty
2008-09-05T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	DOA
2008-09-05T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	not a bad lil board

2008-09-05T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	then its the best ;)
2008-09-05T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	yes, pata is the ribbon cable, sata is a thinner one (usually orange)
2008-09-05T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	its what people call IDE, when all hard drives are IDE
2008-09-05T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	it varys wildly from bios to bios. It may be in integrated peripherals but it might be worded different
2008-09-05T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	there is not concrete answer, you may have to rtfm
2008-09-05T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dawson	anything about PATA or onboard IDE setup?
2008-09-05T17:25:00.000Z	Dawson	ActionParsnip	Thank you for your help also
