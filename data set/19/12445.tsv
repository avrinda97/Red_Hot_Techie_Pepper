2008-12-28T16:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	CaptainMorgan	I've dropped by #ubuntu-ops and left them a message.
2008-12-28T16:02:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Stormx2	thanks for leaving a message
2008-12-28T16:23:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Stormx2	you two are still having marital issues ? :)
2008-12-28T16:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	CaptainMorgan	the ops changed their tone. I'm feeling more than a little hard done by here. He's been totally impolite and outright incorrect, and some op has just validated the way he acted and told me to drop it.
2008-12-28T16:24:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Stormx2	pm?
2008-12-28T16:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	CaptainMorgan	Yeah, I only told him what I know from past experience. I was humble thoughout, and as soon as I was told otherwise by an op I didn't argue >.<
2008-12-28T16:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	CaptainMorgan	Personally I don't think he's got me on /ignore at all.
