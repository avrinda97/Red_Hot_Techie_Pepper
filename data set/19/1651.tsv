Example:         ./firefox

2011-09-20T16:08:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	sudo         means  "super user do this"     (Okay, I may be wrong but it helps me remember the purpose of the command).       sudo  makes your DO/run  programs under a superUser named root,    when you run sudo, it will immediately ask you for a password. So you'll know when to type it.       When your type, you WILL NOT see asterisks **** things. Because it's not suppose to. It's a security feature.
2011-09-20T16:09:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	that not what I mean, I'm gonna put it in a script , i was wondering when/how i will provide the password when the script runs
2011-09-20T16:12:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	I learned when I wanted to make a script that does that... You just really cant do it. It's a security feature.              As a typical linux user, it is /NOT/ not nOt a good idea to put a password in a script unless specifically told to do so from a TRUSTED source (Example being Apache, MySQL).                  I wanted to do this before but I read something that you would have to change the way to authencate yourself (or make it so you do not ne
2011-09-20T16:14:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	ok how about a script that would cd to the directory, run the program and open a terminal for me to input the credentials?
2011-09-20T16:15:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	This is what I meant http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1510272  "Edit the /etc/sudoers file so that you can run that script without providing a password. For example ..."
2011-09-20T16:15:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	that is what you CAN do.
2011-09-20T16:15:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	are you using gnome?
2011-09-20T16:16:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	yes
2011-09-20T16:16:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	hang on, I will make an example.
2011-09-20T16:17:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	thanks
2011-09-20T16:19:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	       http://pastebin.com/4F3wCvTV              <--- try that script.            BE SURe to give that file permission to execute. (just to the owner, IF applicable)
2011-09-20T16:20:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	thanks, i will try , can i get back to you later >
2011-09-20T16:20:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	What it does is cd to /etc/               and then opens up a GTK      sudo-password box      to run a program called   GEDIT     to edit a file named host      that's inside the /etc/ directory folder.
2011-09-20T16:20:00.000Z	Ibis	itai	longstroy short, it's to edit  host in      /etc/          (please DO NOT make any changes to that file. that's just an example).
2011-09-20T16:26:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	oh , i figured it out...never mind...thanks
2011-09-20T16:27:00.000Z	itai	Ibis	one last question , to run the VPN i need two parameters one is user name and another is password, is there a way for the script to at least reemeber the user name for me ?
