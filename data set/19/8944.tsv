2011-08-31T20:53:00.000Z	mod		I cannot figured out how to use update-alternaitves, could I get a hand please?
2011-08-31T20:53:00.000Z	Pici	mod	What seems to be the issue?
2011-08-31T20:54:00.000Z	mod		I cannot use openJDK and I want to have all app expecting it to use the Sun JDK I've installed.  I've changed all the PATHs I can think of, no help
2011-08-31T20:54:00.000Z	Pici	mod	All you need to do is run sudo update-java-alternatives
2011-08-31T20:55:00.000Z	Pici	mod	er, I think that requires an argument, so use the -l and -s
2011-08-31T20:55:00.000Z	mod		hmm
2011-08-31T20:55:00.000Z	mod	Pici	hmm seems i have to have openjdk installed to do this
2011-08-31T20:56:00.000Z	mod		aptitude install openjdk-6-jdk
2011-08-31T20:57:00.000Z	mod	Pici	so i have openjdk installed, and I took the Sun JDK, used alien to turn it into a deb, and then installed that
2011-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	mod	Why did you do that?
2011-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	mod		when I run  update-java-alternatives -l , i see openjdk
2011-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	mod		because its the Sun JDK that I need
2011-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	mod		and it doesnt come as a deb
2011-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	mod	alien is really really really not reccomended.
2011-08-31T20:59:00.000Z	mod		hmmm
2011-08-31T20:59:00.000Z	Pici	mod	enable the partner repository and then install the relevant sun-java-* package you want.
2011-08-31T21:00:00.000Z	Pici		!partner | mod
