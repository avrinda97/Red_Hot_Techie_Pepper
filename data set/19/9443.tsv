2010-07-25T11:00:00.000Z	dade		there
2010-07-25T11:00:00.000Z	dade		no matter if i try to install something that allready installed or if i just try to install lets say VLC it tries to remove that package
2010-07-25T11:00:00.000Z	dade		and i cannont continue without uninstalling it
2010-07-25T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dade	That's aptitude, apt-get doesn't actually remove that type of package automatically.
2010-07-25T11:01:00.000Z	dade		ooooo
2010-07-25T11:01:00.000Z	dade		so use apt-get instead?
2010-07-25T11:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dade	That will work, but are you sure you really need that package?
2010-07-25T11:02:00.000Z	dade		yes my Teamspeak 3 server wont connect to my mysql server without it
2010-07-25T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dade	Ok, then you should explicitly apt-get install it so that apt / aptitude know that you want it installed.
2010-07-25T11:03:00.000Z	dade		got it
2010-07-25T11:03:00.000Z	dade		so aptitude is more of a auto thing for less involved users?
2010-07-25T11:03:00.000Z	dade		versus apt-get?
2010-07-25T11:04:00.000Z	dade	ramesh	 if your cpu is below 60C while under load you are ok
2010-07-25T11:04:00.000Z	dade		Thanks for the help guys
2010-07-25T11:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dade	Yes, aptitude also has a pseudo GUI (ncurses) interface option and other features. Debian's official policy is to recommend aptitude, Ubuntu's general policy is to use apt-get, and in all honesty in most cases either will work just fine.
2010-07-25T11:05:00.000Z	dade		thanks for the help :)
2010-07-25T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dade	You're welcome :)
