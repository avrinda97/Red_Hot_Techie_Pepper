2006-08-11T06:17:00.000Z	zane		I am having a bit of trouble installing ubuntu at the moment, I have searched and searched all over the internet but have found no solutions so here is my problem: I try to install ubuntu but it says it can't detect devce, I have to either choose from a list of drivers or install from disk. I have tried multiple cd romm drives and made sure that the computer was seeing them in the BIOS. has anyone encountered this problem here?
2006-08-11T06:17:00.000Z	sethk	zane	try disabling dma
2006-08-11T06:18:00.000Z	zane	sethk	is that an option you specify when you go to hit ENTER at the first boot screen?
2006-08-11T06:19:00.000Z	sethk	zane	right.  hit f1, and find the info about diabling dma
2006-08-11T06:19:00.000Z	sethk	zane	it's in the help; I forget exactly where
2006-08-11T06:22:00.000Z	zane	sethk	this option is in brezzy badger5.10?
2006-08-11T06:22:00.000Z	sethk	zane	yes
2006-08-11T06:22:00.000Z	sethk	zane	it is a kernel command line flag, I believe   ide=nodma
2006-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	zane	look for "booting on unusual machines" or some such language
2006-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	zane	sethk	yep, I see what you mean... now I just have to test it
2006-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	zane	sorry I don't remember the real wording.  Hit f1 at the prompt; hopefully it won't be terribly painful to find.
2006-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	zane	it has a chance of working.  Does this box/cd run properly with windows?  that is, do we know the hardware is good?
2006-08-11T06:24:00.000Z	sethk	zane	you said you've tried more than one cd drive, but there is still a possibility of a hardware error, on the mobo for example.
2006-08-11T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	zane	also, check that the drive jumpering matches the ide cabling and interface.  I've seen a lot of people get into trouble that way.  Make sure that if the cable connecting to the cd drive is an EIDE cable, the drive is jumpered for cable select
2006-08-11T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	zane	an EIDE cable has a blue connector, black connector, and grey connector
2006-08-11T06:26:00.000Z	sethk	zane	an (not extended) IDE cable has three black connectors; in that case you jumper with master and slave.
2006-08-11T06:27:00.000Z	zane	sethk	damn! I think that is the problem... also I do know about ide cables and such as I am a pc tech... but I suppose I just wasn't using my head! lol
2006-08-11T06:27:00.000Z	sethk	zane	it's an easy thing to overlook.
2006-08-11T06:36:00.000Z	zane	sethk	I changed the jumpering to cable select and tried that without the dma option set and it still gave me problems, I now going through the option to the and find this dma thing (I am tryung to boot the live ubuntu first before installing)
