2005-04-17T15:06:00.000Z	francisco		I had a question, it is not possible to listen to MP3's stored on a remote SAMBA Windows Network?
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	francisco		without downloading the files
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	yes
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	either stream them, or use smbmount
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	francisco	Rebroad	mcrawfor ; why can't I? :(
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	francisco		smbmount?
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	francisco		Is that enabled by default?
2005-04-17T15:08:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	that mounts a samba share as a local drive
2005-04-17T15:08:00.000Z	francisco		ah ok Rebroad will try
2005-04-17T15:08:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	only problem with smbmount is that if you lose network connectivity, then it seems to freeze the commands that try to access the share, using the df command
2005-04-17T15:09:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	I meant "including the df command"
2005-04-17T15:09:00.000Z	francisco		oh, ok Rebroad
2005-04-17T15:09:00.000Z	francisco		E: Couldn't find package smbmoun :(
2005-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	smbmount
2005-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	francisco		E: Couldn't find package smbmount
2005-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	francisco		still
2005-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	francisco		heh
2005-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	francisco		:P
2005-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	Rebroad	francisco	maybe it's called smbfs
