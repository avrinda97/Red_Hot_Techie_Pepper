2012-09-28T22:48:00.000Z	Ironsight		Anyone ever setup a network scanner?
2012-09-28T22:49:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	What model HP printer is it? I have an Officejet 4620 and had to install the updated hplip from their website to get the scanner working
2012-09-28T22:50:00.000Z	Ironsight		it's a hp deskjet 3515

2012-09-28T22:52:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	Give me a minute, I'll just see which driver is needed for that printer, it could be that the one in the ubuntu repository isn't new enough for the printer
2012-09-28T22:52:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/models/deskjet_aio/deskjet_3510_series.html was all the info I could find.
2012-09-28T22:54:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	I've just got that page up, that suggests that it need a minimum HPlip version of 3.12.9 but the version in the ubuntu repo's is only 3.12.2
2012-09-28T22:55:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	is sane linked into hplip?
2012-09-28T22:55:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	Is it a wireless printer? That was the problem I had, the scanner wasn't recognised wirelessly with the default version
2012-09-28T22:56:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	guess I will look for a ppa then
2012-09-28T22:57:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	I didn't bother with a PPA, I just used the download from the hp website, that has worked fine for me
2012-09-28T22:58:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	I'll do that then :)
2012-09-28T23:04:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	did you use the automatic installer?
2012-09-28T23:06:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	Yes, I just accepted the defaults that the package offered
2012-09-28T23:18:00.000Z	Ironsight		djones did you have to uninstall stuff before installing hplip from the installer?
2012-09-28T23:19:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	Its a while since I installed it, I didn't uninstall anything myself, but I've got a feeling the installer offered to remove older versions
2012-09-28T23:19:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	k
2012-09-28T23:20:00.000Z	Ironsight	DJones	reason I ask is, it's spitting at me in purple in the terminal: warning: CUPSEXT could not be loaded. Please check HPLIP installation.
2012-09-28T23:21:00.000Z	DJones	Ironsight	I didn't have any errors like that, for me, it was a smooth installation
