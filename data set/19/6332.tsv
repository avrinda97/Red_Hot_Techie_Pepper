2008-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	maximilion		Oh God, how do I install a .run file?
2008-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	maximilion		You'd think that one could "run" a .run file ;)
2008-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maximilion	depends, what are you trying to install?
2008-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	maximilion	IndyGunFreak	Tremulous
2008-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maximilion	uh, tremulous is in the repositories
2008-02-16T19:05:00.000Z	maximilion	IndyGunFreak	hm, how current are the repos? As current as their website?
2008-02-16T19:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		!info tremulous | maximilion
2008-02-16T19:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maximilion	not sure how current it is, i play that one, and it works fine for me.. whats in the current version that may not be in that version that you need?
2008-02-16T19:06:00.000Z	maximilion		Oh well, problem solved, any update problem will be taken care of later :)
2008-02-16T19:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maximilion	how did you solve it?
2008-02-16T19:07:00.000Z	maximilion	IndyGunFreak	I have no idea, just make it a point to not install old stuff - because if I have a problem, everyone will ask me what version it is and berate me for it not being the latest / "have you tried upgrading"...
2008-02-16T19:07:00.000Z	maximilion		...if you know what I mean.
2008-02-16T19:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		!latest | maximilion actually thats windows thinking, its just the opposite here
2008-02-16T19:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		forgot a few characters there.
2008-02-16T19:09:00.000Z	maximilion	IndyGunFreak	I have always been of the the thinking: Don't upgrade if my version works and does what I need.
2008-02-16T19:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maximilion	well, that makes the most sense, always use the packaged version in the repos, unless there is some specific reason you need to download and compile from source
2008-02-16T19:10:00.000Z	maximilion		But when it comes to commercial drivers and software, they all want you to have the latest version, otherwise you don't get support
2008-02-16T19:10:00.000Z	maximilion	IndyGunFreak	yes, of course. :)
2008-02-16T19:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maximilion	most of the games in the repos, will run on the standard drivers, i don't even have intel drivers installed on my laptop, and it runs Tremulous and OpenArena perfectly
