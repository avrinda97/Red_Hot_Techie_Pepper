2008-08-14T07:41:00.000Z	dmsuperman		I'm trying to build transmission from source, but it keeps saying I need libcurl or that it's not in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
2008-08-14T07:41:00.000Z	dmsuperman		I want transmission-daemon
2008-08-14T07:42:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	you need to install libcurl-dev, I think
2008-08-14T07:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	I have libcurl-dev installed
2008-08-14T07:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	rather, libcurl4-dev
2008-08-14T07:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	there is no libcurl-dev
2008-08-14T07:44:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	what happens when you type "pkg-config --modversion libcurl"
2008-08-14T07:46:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	one user in the #transmission channel says he was able to compile on Ubuntu after installing: build-essential automake autoconf libtool pkg-config libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev intltool libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-dev
2008-08-14T07:46:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	wheeee
2008-08-14T07:47:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	and libssl-dev libnotify-dev
2008-08-14T07:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	I already have all of them up to date :(
2008-08-14T07:48:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	you might want to ask around in #transmission
2008-08-14T08:47:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	do you have the curl pc file installed anywhere on your system?
2008-08-14T08:48:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	locate curl | grep \.pc
2008-08-14T08:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	I saw it somewhere...
2008-08-14T08:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	/usr/lib/pkgconfig/
2008-08-14T08:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	libcurl.pc
2008-08-14T08:49:00.000Z	charles_	dmsuperman	and when you run "pkg-config --modversion libcurl" what do you get?
2008-08-14T08:49:00.000Z	dmsuperman	charles_	no package libcurl found
