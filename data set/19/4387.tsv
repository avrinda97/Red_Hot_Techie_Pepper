2009-01-25T00:50:00.000Z	ALEXJONES		Need help in mplayer: http://pastebin.com/d72904181 I don't know what this guy means. I'm not an mplayer expert. I'm the rocketguy in that conversation.
2009-01-25T00:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	he means to shut down any instance of the pulse, esd, arts, and jack sound deamons
2009-01-25T00:51:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	How? I couldn't figure that out
2009-01-25T00:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	kill them
2009-01-25T00:52:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	How? I'm a lunix noob and not familiar with mplayer
2009-01-25T00:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	man kill
2009-01-25T00:53:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	how
2009-01-25T00:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	see the manual page for kill
2009-01-25T00:53:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	how
2009-01-25T00:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	I told you already: man kill
2009-01-25T00:57:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	How do I kill those instances through mplayer? That MAN KILL explained nothing useful.
2009-01-25T00:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	it should explain how to kill a process
2009-01-25T00:58:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	so in mplayer its: mplayer -kill RIGHT
2009-01-25T00:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	no.
2009-01-25T00:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	pkill mplayer
2009-01-25T00:59:00.000Z	ALEXJONES	lstarnes	how do i shut down instances of pulse, esd, arts, and jack sound deamons
2009-01-25T00:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	check to see if they're running using ps aux | grep name-of-daemon
2009-01-25T00:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	where name-of-daemon is pulse, esd, arts, or jack
2009-01-25T01:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	ALEXJONES	alternative option: use system > administration > system monitor
