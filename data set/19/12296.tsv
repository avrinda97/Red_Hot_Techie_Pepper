2010-07-19T07:37:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	I'm on ssh to my Ubuntu machine as it is, no idea what packages you have installed.
2010-07-19T07:37:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	so, you want to view the desktop?
2010-07-19T07:39:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	first, install vinaigre using the software manager.
2010-07-19T07:39:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	then, look for a remote desktop client. I'll go look up what mine's called.
2010-07-19T07:41:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	I'm just logging in now.
2010-07-19T07:42:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	vino ... I've heard of that.
2010-07-19T07:47:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	those two lines were for you, by the way
2010-07-19T07:47:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	brb. it's in the menus, or perhaps hanging off as an application onthe panel if you add it.
2010-07-19T07:49:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	System, Preferences, Remote Desktop
2010-07-19T07:53:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	sounds good, and sounds like you at least know what you're doing.
2010-07-19T07:55:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	hm? weird.
2010-07-19T07:55:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	did you try    your-other-machine:0   L
2010-07-19T07:59:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	yeah, and if you click "Connect", what does that bring up?
2010-07-19T08:01:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	hm?
2010-07-19T08:02:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	cool, but it doesn't open, you say?
2010-07-19T08:03:00.000Z	Viking667	rosstaylor	okay. On the "server" machine, log out, log back in.
