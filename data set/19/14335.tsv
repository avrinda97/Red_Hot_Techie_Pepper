2011-05-01T02:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	notlistening	 I thought it was a 'per window' or 'entire desktop' setting.
2011-05-01T02:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	notlistening	 some compiz settings/plugins can break unity. so be carefull with them :)

2011-05-01T02:16:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	do you ever use the enhanced zoom feature?
2011-05-01T02:18:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	well unity doesn't play nicely with it now :(, can't access the menu when zooming
2011-05-01T02:20:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	I would like to adopt unity but it is giving more heaches that its worth with the features of compiz i use regularly

2011-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	notlistening		what is the difference between unity 2D & 3D?
2011-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	notlistening		is it all in the name ;) ?
2011-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	notlistening	 eyecandy and a few other looks.
2011-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	notlistening	 the keybindings will also be differnt so some of the things using compiz wont be there.
