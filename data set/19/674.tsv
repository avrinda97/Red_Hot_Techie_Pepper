2011-12-09T16:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	'~$ ps faux' shows me that there is no parent process of it.
2011-12-09T16:50:00.000Z	deej1976	bullgard4	What is the number ? 1?
2011-12-09T16:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	The PID is 4085.
2011-12-09T16:51:00.000Z	deej1976	bullgard4	ps -ef | grep 4085
2011-12-09T16:52:00.000Z	deej1976	bullgard4	or ps -p 4085
2011-12-09T16:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	This results in »/usr/lib/gvfs-cdda --spawner :1.1 /org/gtk/gvfs/exec_spaw/3« which I have already posted.
2011-12-09T16:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	'~$ ps -p 4085; CMD=gvfsd-cdda'.

2011-12-09T17:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	The article http://steveswinsburg.wordpress.com/2011/03/12/how-to-install-a-d-link-dwa-525-wireless-network-card-in-ubuntu-10-04/ does not even mention cdda.
2011-12-09T17:13:00.000Z	deej1976	bullgard4	Sorry cross threading
2011-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	I don't know what cross threading is.
2011-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	deej1976	bullgard4	I was talk to someone else, and sent you a link intended for them.
2011-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	Ah! I see.
2011-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	deej1976	bullgard4	Sorry I'm unable to help you any further.
2011-12-09T17:16:00.000Z	bullgard4	deej1976	Thank you.
