2008-05-10T10:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	babolat	it's a DNS issue
2008-05-10T10:45:00.000Z	babolat	Starnestommy	why weren't u in here when i was miserable??? lol.. how'd you do that?
2008-05-10T10:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	babolat	google's dns seems to resolve differently on different nameservers.  Your current DNS servers may be the problem
2008-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	babolat	Starnestommy	am i to ask my isp to change my DNS?
2008-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	babolat	you can change your DNS servers in your network settings.
2008-05-10T10:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	babolat	208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 usually work for me.  They're OpenDNS's servers
2008-05-10T10:48:00.000Z	babolat	Starnestommy	as far as i now, it's automatically resolved by my ISP. dynamic not static service package.. i can be able to do that?

2008-05-10T10:52:00.000Z	babolat	Starnestommy	i see where to change the DNSs.. do i delete the ones i have now, or just add the OpenDNS ones?
2008-05-10T10:52:00.000Z	Starnestommy	babolat	add the opendns ones before the ones you have not
2008-05-10T10:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	babolat	I think it's for the whole system
2008-05-10T10:58:00.000Z	babolat	Starnestommy	ok.. thank you. you have just alleviated my three-day misery
