2008-03-24T01:38:00.000Z	subsume		haha. i love how in Ubuntu there's a 30% chance windows you select just won't open, like FF or a terminal
2008-03-24T01:40:00.000Z	subsume		people can read, if anyone could help they'd jump in
2008-03-24T01:40:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	please do not blaspheme
2008-03-24T01:41:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	is your question how to install grub from Live CD?
2008-03-24T01:42:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	yes.
2008-03-24T01:44:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	this might help you: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 Just remember that it is now "find /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	there may be a better automatic way of doing it, but i am also very new to ubuntu
2008-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	I'm not an idiot. Ubuntu simply failed to give me a GRUB install
2008-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	I probably missed a checkbnox which said 'Make Ubuntu actually work'
2008-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	sorry i do not follow... you do cannot run grub from live cd?
2008-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	Fresh install of Ubuntu failed to give me GRUB
2008-03-24T01:47:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	you mean it did not make the /boot/grub directory?
2008-03-24T01:47:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	you got it buddy.
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	that it very strange. however, i believe you still can create the /boot/menu.lst file yourself - and install grub to the MBR of (hd0) from the live cd by running it from there.
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	yeah, I tried. then I ran into errors.
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	once you boot into your ubuntu installation, you might then (re)install grub
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	what errors?
2008-03-24T01:50:00.000Z	subsume	KalEl	errors. I'm sick of explaining everything a million times. I'll let you know how the reinstall goes. oh wait, it takes two hours.
2008-03-24T01:50:00.000Z	KalEl	subsume	strange again, for me it took around 14 minutes. however chances are good that reinstalling it from the same source won't help - unless u messed some configuration the first time.
