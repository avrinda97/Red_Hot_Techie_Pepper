2010-12-26T14:55:00.000Z	PerSeL		how can I fix this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/547670/ it comes up in terminal when I type sudo apt-get update
2010-12-26T14:55:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	can you paste your sources.list file?
2010-12-26T14:56:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	where can I find it?
2010-12-26T14:56:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	in /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-12-26T14:56:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	paste the contents in a pastebin like paste.ubuntu.com
2010-12-26T14:58:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	http://paste.ubuntu.com/547673/
2010-12-26T15:01:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	find the line 'sudo apt-get update' in the file you just pasted, delete that line, save, and then sudo apt-get update
2010-12-26T15:03:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	I cannot delete it looks like it's read only
2010-12-26T15:04:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	run gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list in a terminal
2010-12-26T15:05:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	thanks now everything is working
2010-12-26T15:05:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	:) sure thing
2011-01-01T21:42:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	trojan_spike you need to install the 'lsb' package for google earth to work
2011-01-01T21:42:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	how do I do that?
2011-01-01T21:43:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	trojan_spike yes... it is in synaptic... you can install from there (linux standard base/ packagename is lsb)
2011-01-01T21:44:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	lsb-base is installed on my ubuntu
2011-01-01T21:44:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	trojan_spike well, it didnt.. for me and 2 other guys.. installing it worked for all 3 of us
2011-01-01T21:45:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	what about lsb?
2011-01-01T21:46:00.000Z	PerSeL	rs0832	KM0201 ok Installing now
2011-01-01T21:46:00.000Z	rs0832	PerSeL	trojan_spike what KM0201 said exactly... lsb installs lsb-core as a dependancy
