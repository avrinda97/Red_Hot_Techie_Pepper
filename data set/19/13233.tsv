2005-05-02T09:13:00.000Z	ups		how does someone see a windows partition from a live cd?
2005-05-02T09:15:00.000Z	sp3tt	ups	sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows/ -t ntfs -o umask=0222
2005-05-02T09:15:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	/mnt/windows has to be created?
2005-05-02T09:15:00.000Z	sp3tt		Yes,
2005-05-02T09:16:00.000Z	sp3tt		sudo mkdir /mnt/windows
2005-05-02T09:16:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	well, the system has only windows on it, and it's a live cd
2005-05-02T09:16:00.000Z	ups		i know how to do that on a regular system ;)
2005-05-02T09:16:00.000Z	sp3tt	ups	I am running live cd too!
2005-05-02T09:16:00.000Z	sp3tt		And I have mounted my windows partition without trouble,
2005-05-02T09:17:00.000Z	sp3tt		Weird how the live cd can find and mount them... But not the installer,
2005-05-02T09:17:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	u mean the partitions are automounted?
2005-05-02T09:18:00.000Z	sp3tt		No.
2005-05-02T09:18:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	then what is the default mount point? (i'm helping a friend with this, dont have the live cd myself)
2005-05-02T09:19:00.000Z	sp3tt		I think it is /mnt/hda1
2005-05-02T09:19:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	so basically after the live cd has booted, what to do?
2005-05-02T09:20:00.000Z	sp3tt		sudo mkdir /mnt/windows
2005-05-02T09:20:00.000Z	sp3tt		sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows/ -t ntfs -o umask=0222
2005-05-02T09:20:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	err... if none of the partitions aren't mounted then where can i create that directory?
2005-05-02T09:21:00.000Z	ups	sp3tt	or am i missing something?
