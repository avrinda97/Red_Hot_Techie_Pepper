2006-07-01T05:30:00.000Z	atlantian		how do you mount the external again, I tried sudo mount sdc1 in console (yeah i am new to this sorry ) :)
2006-07-01T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	what filesystem?
2006-07-01T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	why would you want to do that?
2006-07-01T05:32:00.000Z	atlantian	jrib	easier than doing it via console
2006-07-01T05:33:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	have you seen system > administration > disks
2006-07-01T05:37:00.000Z	atlantian	jrib	this sounds very basic, but once  your in disks how do i open them?
2006-07-01T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	well that lets you mount them.  Then anyone with proper permissions can view them.  What filesystem do the disks use?
2006-07-01T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	they should get mounted in /media/*
2006-07-01T05:39:00.000Z	atlantian	jrib	status is inaccesible and when i click enable, nothing happens
2006-07-01T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	ok, with fat, it doesn't allow you to set unix style permissions.  So, you have to modify the permissions linux gives it when it gets mounted.  The easiest way to do this is to just setup a line in fstab with the proper permissions
2006-07-01T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	sure, it's not that straight forward though
2006-07-01T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	you have to run 'gconf-editor' and setup keybinding_commands and global_keybinds in the '/apps/metacity' keys.  To combine the window key with other stuff you have to set it up like '<mod4>d' or whatever the 'xmodmap' returns for the windows key instead of 'mod4'.  That's probably not all that clear, just ask :)
2006-07-03T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	atlantian	do you just want to open rar files?
