2005-11-16T08:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	www.kernel.org buddy :)
2005-11-16T08:53:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	no in ubuntu lol
2005-11-16T08:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	oh :)
2005-11-16T08:54:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	u mean synaptic lol
2005-11-16T08:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	errr, apt, synaptic, aptitude, same difference
2005-11-16T09:01:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	quick question in synaptic i searched for kernel ... and i see linux-image-2.6.12-9-686 and linux-image-2.6.12-9-686-smp (i want to try those 2) on the latest version says 2.6.12-9-.23 then i go down a lil more and it shows linux-image-686 and linux-image-686-smp (With no #'s ) but then where it says latest version says 2.6.12.16 .. im confused there
2005-11-16T09:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	the one with numbers isn't the default kernel, the one without numbers is
2005-11-16T09:02:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	but it shows linux-image-2.6.9-386 and linux-image-386 installed already
2005-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	get both then, just in case, but 686 is basically the i686 processor, P4's and later mobile Pentium processors fall under that
2005-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	SMP is multiple processor
2005-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	yea i know i have  prescott p4 w/ HT so thats why I use the SMP 1.. but I wanted to see how the 686 works w/o SMP...
2005-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	get both of which the one's with #'s or the others ?
2005-11-16T09:04:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	you can try it out, just change the booted kernel in GRUB
2005-11-16T09:04:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	or get them using apt-get/synaptic/aptitude, I suggest both
2005-11-16T09:04:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	get them both with and without the #'s ?
2005-11-16T09:04:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	yeah
2005-11-16T09:05:00.000Z	R0bNyc	Razor-X	alrightt hanks .. btw ubuntu updates grub for me i hope
2005-11-16T09:05:00.000Z	Razor-X	R0bNyc	if you get it from apt/aptitude/synaptic, then yes
