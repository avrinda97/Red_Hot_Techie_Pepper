2012-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	kdevelop das php and c++ pretty well.
2012-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	Ubuntu (XFCE) , will it blend ?
2012-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	"blend"?
2012-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	I mean will it work on XFCE ? It will pull the whole KDE stuff by itself? because I assume K stands for KDE
2012-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	yes, it uses "kde stuff"
2012-04-20T10:41:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	Gonna check it out.
2012-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	more lightweight, but only covering your C++ needs would be qt creator. that does not depend on "kde stuff"
2012-04-20T10:45:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	I would use QT only when I need the qt library, unfortunately QT doesn't have nor color themes nor php support (from which my job depends) :D
2012-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	That's the whole point, I don't quite seek for a project oriented IDE
2012-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	for that I use phpStorm and CDT for C++
2012-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	if you want to edit text files, vim and emacs is fine
2012-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	no they are not, I'm used with gui tools and I'm not comfortable with them. I'm trying to learn them , but nobody seems to have a clue where to start properly except the readme of vim :D
2012-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	I got to mention thou, Kdevelop seems preatty neat.
2012-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	I don't do heavy C++ projects, I'm on a simple learing curve, I don't do makefiles or heavy project handling
2012-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	I just need code completion a simple project managament, and the compiling I do by console.
2012-04-20T11:18:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	nobody who likes vim touches emacs, and vice versa....
2012-04-20T11:19:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	that rule must have been there before computers had been invented
2012-04-20T11:19:00.000Z	Zenger	Rud	I kind of suspected this trend :D
2012-04-20T11:21:00.000Z	Rud	Zenger	both vim's direct predecessor (vi) and emacs are from 1976 or so. vi followed ed which is even older
