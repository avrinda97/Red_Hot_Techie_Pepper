2012-06-20T07:33:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	i do
2012-06-20T07:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	I hope you have a live usb around
2012-06-20T06:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	can't hurt to try 3.4.3, just make sure you setup grub so you can boot the old kernel if it fails
2012-06-20T06:58:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	can you help me find a decent article on how to move /boot onto its own partition
2012-06-20T06:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	chroot?
2012-06-20T06:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	oh just create a partition copy the contents of boot into it and change /etc/fstab to point to it
2012-06-20T07:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CreateBootPartitionAfterInstall
2012-06-20T07:01:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	even more better. thank you.  sometimes i forget to search with older versions of ubuntu lol
2012-06-20T07:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	things don't normaly change much
2012-06-20T07:29:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	well that was painless.  just moved the the files onto boot...
2012-06-20T07:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	if you just moved the files does grub end up using them?
2012-06-20T07:32:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	i did a copy my bad.
2012-06-20T07:32:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	it uses them because you update grub to tell them to use them
2012-06-20T07:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	yes I should think it still running the originals
2012-06-20T07:36:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	yes its still running the originals
2012-06-20T07:36:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	it said i need to turn swap off
2012-06-20T07:53:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	okay i am stuck.  i did the fstab and grub-update but the /boot on my previous target is still being used rather than on the new partition /dev/sda6
2012-06-20T07:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	cccangel	I'm guessing you didn't fully read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CreateBootPartitionAfterInstall   at setting up grub2
2012-06-20T07:57:00.000Z	cccangel	sacarlson	actually i forgot the Final Cleanup part
