2009-06-16T20:06:00.000Z	wbc		When I installed Ubuntu on my external hard-drive it made the hard-drive non XP-compatible, how may I undo that
2009-06-16T20:07:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	you mean you formatted it as ext3?
2009-06-16T20:08:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	well.. windows is bit dumb when it comes to talking to anything not made by Microsoft.. so you can't.. not without removing ubuntu, that is
2009-06-16T20:08:00.000Z	wbc	Slart	that is not my problem
2009-06-16T20:09:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	the hard drive in itself is still the same.. it's just the partition that windows can't handle
2009-06-16T20:09:00.000Z	wbc	Slart	When I boot on Windows XP CD, and make a new partition table, it simply reject the hard-drive. Take a loot at this: http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y280/obinice/wininstall_img2.jpg?t=1245164820
2009-06-16T20:10:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	yes.. windows can't be installed to an ext3 partition.. just as it says
2009-06-16T20:11:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	you will have to go back and remove the partition with ubuntu on it.. then let windows create it's own partition
2009-06-16T20:12:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	in the screen before this one.. select the ext3 partition and press.. L .. I think
2009-06-16T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	might be some other key.. hard to remember
2009-06-16T20:14:00.000Z	wbc	Slart	and windows ran perfectly on it before Ubuntu got installed on it
2009-06-16T20:14:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	ok.. when you press enter you go back to a partition selector.. right?
2009-06-16T20:15:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	where you can somehow choose where to install windows
2009-06-16T20:16:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	something like this screen http://web.suffieldacademy.org/ils/netadmin/docs/howto/windows_xp_install/docs/images/setup_partition_select_empty.png
2009-06-16T20:18:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	did you remove all partitions first?
2009-06-16T20:18:00.000Z	wbc	Slart	Yes
2009-06-16T20:19:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	ask in ##windows .. they will be able to help you
2009-07-14T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	wbc	azureus probably has that.. as a plugin if nothing else
