2005-11-23T11:39:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lightbright	if he cant boot, how will he check?
2005-11-23T11:40:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lightbright	let's check some things first
2005-11-23T11:40:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	ok
2005-11-23T11:40:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lightbright	i have a solution, for KurtKraut
2005-11-23T11:41:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	sorry I didnt realise you had some ideas
2005-11-26T09:55:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lightbright	you did nothing to affect your box by doing that
2005-11-26T09:56:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	 and after that it stopped loading
2005-11-26T09:56:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	 so what broke it?
2005-11-26T09:56:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lightbright	your attempted update did not affect it
2005-11-26T09:57:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	it wouldnt load anymore after that!  I could use startx from safe mode, but when gnome loaded all my configuration was gone
2005-11-26T09:57:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	 so what else broke it?
2005-11-26T09:57:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lightbright	i have no idea
2005-11-26T09:57:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	ok bye
2005-11-26T09:57:00.000Z	lightbright	nalioth_zZz	 sleep well :)
