2011-01-21T21:32:00.000Z	abstrakt		it's saying...
2011-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	abstrakt		mount: mounting /dev/disk/by-uuid/SOMELONGHEXNUMBERHERE on /root failed: invalid argument
2011-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	abstrakt		also says
2011-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	abstrakt		Target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init
2011-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	abstrakt		Not init found. Try passing init= bootarg
2011-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	abstrakt		that happens regardless of what kernel I select in grub
2011-01-21T21:34:00.000Z	abstrakt		omfg, this is horrible - wtf did Ubuntu just do... seriously!?! did system update just fuck my disk!?
2011-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	abstrakt		given that this is my work machine - or rather, this is the work half of this machine, my windows half of this dual boot still boots fine, so ultimately my overall HD must be ok I guess
2011-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	abstrakt		but I only use that for games/netflix
2011-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	abstrakt		ok so I'm at the (initramfs) prompt... SA-Geoff what options do I have there? is this a normal bash type shell?
2011-01-21T21:36:00.000Z	rumpe1	abstrakt	i still wait for default btrfs-snapshots before each upgrade with integration in grub, so you can boot into the pre-upgrade system...
2011-01-21T21:36:00.000Z	rumpe1	abstrakt	how did you install ubuntu? maybe wubi?
2011-01-21T21:37:00.000Z	abstrakt	rumpe1	no, I installed from a USB stick
2011-01-21T21:37:00.000Z	abstrakt	rumpe1	roughly identical to install from CD, just faster is all
2011-01-21T21:37:00.000Z	abstrakt	rumpe1	this is 10.10 and it has been working for months
2011-01-21T21:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	abstrakt	hmm... ok. Never happened for me but it seems to happen sometimes. For these problems a separate /home-partition is recommended.
2011-01-21T21:38:00.000Z	abstrakt	rumpe1	I highly doubt that would fix anything
2011-01-21T21:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	abstrakt	no... but a reinstall is much simpler :)
2011-01-21T21:39:00.000Z	abstrakt	rumpe1	oh, sure cuz of not having to deal with backup
