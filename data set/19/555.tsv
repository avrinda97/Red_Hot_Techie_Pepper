2011-12-28T15:17:00.000Z	Duker		How can I manually scale down my display size in compiz?
2011-12-28T15:19:00.000Z	Duker		Meta, I only have one resolution option under display settings and it's too big, trying to scale it down a bit
2011-12-28T15:19:00.000Z	Duker		Like the actual edges of the screen
2011-12-28T15:21:00.000Z	Duker		where can I tweak it in ccsm, been looking but cant find it - I remember using something in the past there that foxed it
2011-12-28T15:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	what kind of video do you have?
2011-12-28T15:24:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	is that a hdmi connect?
2011-12-28T15:25:00.000Z	Duker	almoxarife	yes
2011-12-28T15:25:00.000Z	Duker	almoxarife	Integrated into i7 processor, hdmi is on mobo
2011-12-28T15:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	what you need to find for your video is the 'overscan' correction
2011-12-28T15:26:00.000Z	Duker	almoxarife	Thanks :D
2011-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	doubt it
2011-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	Duker	almoxarife	Any idea what I could use, usually I tihnk I have nvidia drivers, but nothing proprietary on this one
2011-12-28T15:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	that's right, on nvidia there is a nice simple slider to fix overscan, nevermind they put it at nears bottom where you can't see it if overscanned, but that's for another day, doesn't your card have a config gui ?
2011-12-28T15:34:00.000Z	Duker	almoxarife	It doesn't seem to have anything that shows in the 'addition drivers' section
2011-12-28T15:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	look at this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1728526

2011-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	yeah, use nautilus, right click on the folder and follow the instructions on the 'sharing' tab
2011-12-29T08:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	it will
2011-12-31T08:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	Duker	how did you install it?
