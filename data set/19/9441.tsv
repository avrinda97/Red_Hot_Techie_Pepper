2010-06-02T13:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	Could you try using an untainted upstream kernel from: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/  ?
2010-06-02T13:11:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	a 2.6.33 ? or daily ? or .34 ? :)
2010-06-02T13:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	2.6.34 is probabl most likely not to kernel panic, 2.6.32 will have the most relevance to Ubuntu 10.04's shipping kernel.
2010-06-02T13:20:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	booted, lets see if we can reproduce it now
2010-06-02T13:23:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	now it locked up, without stacktrace
2010-06-02T13:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	Can you file a bug report with "ubuntu-bug linux"? (if you're able to boot far enough to do so)
2010-06-02T13:26:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	on the .32 stock kernel or the 2.6.34 one ?
2010-06-02T13:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	I'd submit it against the untainted .32, because an untainted report is more usefull to upstream, but mention that you can reproduce it with Ubuntu's kernel and untainted 34-020634.

2012-08-22T21:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	All fileystems will work on "raw" disks, but I wouldn't recommend doing that with any filesystem. Why do you not want to have a partition table?
2012-08-22T21:41:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	because you then do not have problems with resizing the partition
2012-08-22T21:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	What problems?
2012-08-22T21:42:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	reboot .. :)
2012-08-22T21:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	I don't understand.
2012-08-22T21:45:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	If you have partitions, and you want to resize a disk, you needs to reboot (or at least umount it), with a partitionless disk, you can resize, and no need for reboot :)
2012-08-22T23:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	If you're putting the filesystem on the whole disk, how are you resizing the disk? Is this a virtual machine where you can dynamically increase the size of the "physical" disk?
2012-08-22T23:20:00.000Z	dupondje	Jordan_U	indeed a VM :) with a partition you can't resize, without you can live resize
2012-08-22T23:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	Then any filesystem will work on a "raw" disk (though not all support online resize). Just please don't try such a think with real hard drives or with virtual drives that might come into contact with Windows or other OSs which will think that the drive is "unformatted" and happlily trash the filesystem for you.
2012-08-22T23:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dupondje	ext4 can online grow, but not online shrink.
