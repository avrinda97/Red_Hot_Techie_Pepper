2006-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	Bassetts		anyone know how to send files to a virtual machine?
2006-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	Using Vmware?
2006-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	Bassetts	bensode	yes, server
2006-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	in the virtual machine, if it is windows, you can browse \\.host
2006-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	that is a link to your host share
2006-06-13T07:23:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	Yeah I just started playing with vmware this week.  Pretty handy
2006-06-13T07:24:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	I use it for visio and domain management wihtout having to remote desktop to manage the Windows domain
2006-06-13T07:24:00.000Z	Bassetts	bensode	\\.host does not work
2006-06-13T07:24:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	did you install the vmware tools on the guest OS?
2006-06-13T07:24:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	Yes or you could create a share on the host too
2006-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	I beleive it's under System -> Administration -> Shares
2006-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	I'm still a little new with Ubuntu myself ;)
2006-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	the browse to \\.hosts should work if you have vmware tools installed on the guest.  It's jus a little slow to initialize, at least for me
2006-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	Bassetts	bensode	vista says it cannot find it
2006-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	Oh Vista is "Experimental" still under VMware Workstation 5.5 I thought?
2006-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	Bassetts	bensode	yes it is
2006-06-13T07:28:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	That might be half the problem there ;)  Cherwin's solution might be better
2006-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	bensode	Bassetts	I tried vista a while back and a lot of it was still not functional.  Basicly just got a fancy desktop and IE to work, nothing else
2006-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	Bassetts	bensode	its pretty functional now
