2004-12-18T14:13:00.000Z	TankC		I can go "smbclient -L __host__" and it works fine
2004-12-18T14:13:00.000Z	TankC		but it dosent show up under the Computer -> Network
2004-12-18T14:14:00.000Z	TankC		Anyone have any possible solutions?
2004-12-18T14:14:00.000Z	TankC		Yes, "Windows Network" is empty
2004-12-18T14:14:00.000Z	TankC		there are no folders inside
2004-12-18T14:15:00.000Z	TankC		Nope.  Infact it was working fine earlier with the livecd from a laptop I have
2004-12-18T14:16:00.000Z	ctd	TankC	Running a straight warty install?
2004-12-18T14:16:00.000Z	TankC	ctd	yes, and all the securuty updates
2004-12-18T14:16:00.000Z	ctd		hrm.
2004-12-18T14:16:00.000Z	TankC		security*
2004-12-18T14:16:00.000Z	ctd		and 'warty-updates'?
2004-12-18T14:17:00.000Z	TankC	ctd	not sure, I clicked the "Mark All Upgrades" button
2004-12-18T14:18:00.000Z	TankC		and it downloaded and installed all of them
2004-12-18T14:19:00.000Z	TankC		I mean.. I can get around this.. but its kind of annoying not having it work
2004-12-18T14:20:00.000Z	TankC		smbclient can handle it fine
2004-12-18T14:20:00.000Z	TankC		I'll probably just do a smbmount
2004-12-18T14:21:00.000Z	ctd	TankC	Can't say I've seen it before.
