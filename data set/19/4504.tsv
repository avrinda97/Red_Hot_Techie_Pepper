2009-01-03T08:47:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	if you can definately ssh in from other machines on your LAN. the problem has to be with your router settings
2009-01-03T08:48:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: i am using ssh+screen+irssi now, so yes i am sshing over wlan. but the router should be configured correctly according to http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Dlink/DI-614+/SSH.htm. any thoughts?
2009-01-03T08:50:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	you could test out the route using the DMZ feature of your router
2009-01-03T08:51:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	DMZ simultaniously forwards all ports to your selected PC, it is therefore very insucure - however assuming your machine is not for production use and is not running any other services you should be safe to test it
2009-01-03T08:51:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: i have done that as well, i added my internal ip to the dmz, so everything should be forwarded to my box, but still it didn't work. :-/ (i have removed it now though)
2009-01-03T08:52:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: yes, what you said.
2009-01-03T08:52:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	very strange then.  I would be tempted to reset the router and run through the steps from scratch
2009-01-03T08:53:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: already done that. ;-) (been trying for a long time now :-/)
2009-01-03T08:53:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	port forwarding is usually very simple to do, it sounds like you know what you are doing and are hitting a router glicth here
2009-01-03T08:54:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	the only possibility i can think of is that your ISP blocks the port you are attempting to use - this is very rare though, only normally done with email
2009-01-03T08:55:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: meh! :-( will try to see if i can find something about the router being buggy or something, it's an old model, unsupported though. thanks for your time/help. :-)
2009-01-03T08:55:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: i have tryed using port 22, 2277, and the one im currently using.
2009-01-03T08:56:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	who is your ISP?
2009-01-03T08:56:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: nextgentel (norway)
2009-01-03T08:58:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	it is possible for an ISP to block all ports except for web traffic ones - ie 80 and 443
2009-01-03T08:59:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	so you could try connecting over those, and port forward port 80 to port 22 for example
2009-01-03T08:59:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: ok, i really don't think nextgentel is blocking anything, but im willing to try. :-)
2009-01-03T09:00:00.000Z	Skippy1981	kristian_	another thing you could try is to take the router out of the equation and connect your box directly to WAN, this would prove the problme is the router.  However you can only do this if your modem etc is seperate to the router of course
2009-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	kristian_	Skippy1981	: true, i should do that, but i dont have any cables lying around. :-P i should go and get one tommorow.
