2007-10-11T06:32:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	it was about fonts rendering, thanks for the attention :)
2007-10-11T06:32:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	i actually have a bunch of similar question which prevent me from using ubuntu as my OS on my ibook
2007-10-11T06:33:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	what ever i did, including rebuilding freetype (with byte-encoder stuff) it's ugly
2007-10-11T06:33:00.000Z	GTroy	bododo	did you do a source install?
2007-10-11T06:34:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	of freetype? yes, that's what i did
2007-10-11T06:34:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	and?
2007-10-11T06:35:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	i actually build it from sources, so ./configure --prefix=/usr make and make install
2007-10-11T06:36:00.000Z	GTroy	bododo	is there a package in synaptic for it?
2007-10-11T06:36:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	i'm actually on os x right now, for i don't have wifi with wpa yet :(
2007-10-11T06:37:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	do you own a ppc?
2007-10-11T06:39:00.000Z	bododo	GTroy	i'm a fedorian, see what i mean ;)
2007-10-11T06:39:00.000Z	GTroy	bododo	this is true
