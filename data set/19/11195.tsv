2006-09-17T08:38:00.000Z	Amaranth		So...does anyone know what script is run to handle resume from hibernation?
2006-09-17T08:38:00.000Z	Amaranth		It's not in /etc/rcS.d
2006-09-17T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	think that actually is a kernel thing but it should be suspend
2006-09-17T08:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	It's got to be a shell script, it spits a diff out at me instead of running the script. :) Something broke in an upgrade
2006-09-17T08:41:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	think it's suspend or resume the script is named
2006-09-17T08:41:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	I m not to famialar with suspend sicne I tend to stay away from it since it breaks a lot of times
2006-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	Actualy I'm pretty sure the geforce 2 cards are no longer supported as of 97xx
2006-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	no they are still supported my card works fine in regular nvidia card
2006-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	With the 97xx driver? I know it works with 9729
2006-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	but then again geforce 2 mx 440 is not really a geforce2 card
2006-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	err, 9629
2006-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	well considering that 97xx drivers are not out
2006-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	They probably will be soon
2006-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	They'll probably be in feisty too
2006-12-06T17:00:00.000Z	kitche	Amaranth	well geforce2 mx 440 are still being made my geforce 2 mx 440 is DirectX 9 compatible
2006-12-07T17:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	*shrug* Just repeating what I've heard, I've never owned a geforce 2 of any kind
2006-12-08T14:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	?
2007-07-14T07:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	kitche	?
