2005-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	how do I make sure that acx_pci is loaded?
2005-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	in a terminal type: lsmod|grep acx
2005-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	its not there
2005-01-23T06:22:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	try: sudo modprobe acx_pci
2005-01-23T06:22:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	if it complains your card isnt a acx100
2005-01-23T06:23:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	if it doesnt complain type: dmesg
2005-01-23T06:24:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	and look at the last lines of the output
2005-01-23T06:27:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	add the acx_pci module to /etc/modules (sudo gedit /etc/modules)
2005-01-23T06:31:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	acx_pci
2005-01-23T06:31:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	avoid typos ;)
2005-01-23T06:34:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	ok, will do:)
2005-01-23T06:35:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	should i reboot now? it isn't showing up as a wireless device when i try to add a network connection
2005-01-23T06:36:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	what did the lines of dmesg say ? they should have mentioned the device name (wlan0 or something)
2005-01-23T06:40:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	dev_info is: TI acx_pci
2005-01-23T06:41:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	acx100_init_module: TI acx_pci.o:Ver 0.2.0pre8 Driver initialized, waiting for cards to probe
2005-01-23T06:42:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	hmm, didnt show up a device ?
2005-01-23T06:42:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	i don't think so
2005-01-23T06:45:00.000Z	ogra	reijo01	i think rob0 can lead you through the config then... i have to sleep now
2005-01-23T06:45:00.000Z	reijo01	ogra	ok, thanks for your help, gnite
