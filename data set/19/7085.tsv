2007-10-12T13:00:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	you add your user with the NOPASSWD option to /etc/sudoers. see "man sudoers" for more info and correct syntax
2007-10-12T13:01:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	that is, if you want the user to execute apt-get without being asked for a password. all users in "admin" group should be able to use "sudo apt-get" and is then asked for password.
2007-10-12T13:02:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	that does not make sence to me. "sudo su" would give you a root prompt, in which case you don't need to use sudo at all.
2007-10-12T13:03:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	have you by any chance copied over old /etc/... files from the old ubuntu install?
2007-10-12T13:03:00.000Z	meek	Jowi	human error:
2007-10-12T13:04:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	"sudo apt-get install nvidiblabla && sudo dpkg-reconfigure..." the lock error usually means that apt is busy (you might have synaptic package manager or aptitude open already=
2007-10-12T13:05:00.000Z	meek	Jowi	on previous installation i could install multiple apt-get at same time in seperate terminal windows
2007-10-12T13:06:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	that is not possible nowadays due to that there can be corruption in the apt cache (or something similar. that's why there is a lock used now)
2007-10-12T13:21:00.000Z	Jowi	meek	bitmap, ddc, dri, extmod, freetype, glx, int10, vbe should be enough
