2008-05-25T15:58:00.000Z	orgthingy		k
2008-05-25T15:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	maybe you should try #debin
2008-05-25T15:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	there's not really a lot of difference between Ubuntu and Debian though
2008-05-25T15:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	you can't really remove *any* OS from a drive, you can just overwrite it
2008-05-25T16:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	but as I said, Debian is pretty much the same as Ubuntu, except most stuff doesn't work properly
2008-05-25T16:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	same as any other OS ;-)
2008-05-25T16:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	why do you want to switch to Debian?
2008-05-25T16:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	that would be Ubuntu, then
2008-05-25T16:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	hm
2008-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	Windows was garbage when I tried it
2008-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	you might want to take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	orgthingy	or take it away entirely
