2008-05-11T22:01:00.000Z	_urlwolf		how can you explain that the out put of whatsmyip.com is not the same as the ip shown in ifconfig?
2008-05-11T22:02:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	you have some device doing NAT? a router or most dsl modems for instance ?
2008-05-11T22:03:00.000Z	_urlwolf	astro76	Is there any way to know which IP is correct?
2008-05-11T22:03:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	most DSL modems are actually "routers" also, you can hook up a switch and multiple computers without  a separate router
2008-05-11T22:04:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	they are both correct, one is external and one is internal
2008-05-11T22:04:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	to ssh in from outside you use the external, but you also need to set a port forward in the modem
2008-05-11T22:05:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	pretty simple usually, go to http://192.168.1.1 which is most likely the modem's internal address, and configure it there, checkout portforward.com if you need help
2008-05-11T22:06:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	no, this is a common and desirable setup, so your internal computers are "firewalled" from the internet
2008-05-11T22:06:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	and you can hook up more than one
2008-05-11T22:08:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	what IP does ifconfig give?
2008-05-11T22:08:00.000Z	_urlwolf	astro76	inet addr:192.168.11.150
2008-05-11T22:08:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	then it's 192.168.11.1
2008-05-11T22:09:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	your ISP's website probably has documentation on this, as does portforward.com
2008-05-11T22:12:00.000Z	_urlwolf	astro76	what do I look for in portfoward?
2008-05-11T22:13:00.000Z	_urlwolf	astro76	window's ipconfig saying the default gateway is 192.168.2.1
2008-05-11T22:14:00.000Z	_urlwolf	astro76	alright! I'm in!
2008-05-11T22:15:00.000Z	_urlwolf	astro76	now, how do I do the port forward?
2008-05-11T22:21:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	do you have a router or just the modem?
2008-05-11T22:23:00.000Z	astro76	_urlwolf	yes then you need to go to the router config and forward port 22 to the linux machine
