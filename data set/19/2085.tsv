2010-07-10T07:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	first, try ''sudo update-grub''
2010-07-10T07:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	I meant into a terminal once you boot to ubuntu
2010-07-10T07:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	can you boot ubuntu?
2010-07-10T07:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	no, boot it normally (no CD)
2010-07-10T07:50:00.000Z	GuerreroPorVeni	prince_jammys	ok
2010-07-10T07:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	this is the most obvious thing to do, first.
2010-07-10T07:50:00.000Z	GuerreroPorVeni	prince_jammys	 after sudo update-grub what should i do next?
2010-07-10T07:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	in a moment, reboot. but while you're here, see if ''sudo fdisk -l'' shows your windows drive/partition.
2010-07-10T07:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	you should see 'NTFS' listed.
2010-07-10T07:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	it's -l as in the letter L, not 1.
2010-07-10T08:04:00.000Z	GuerreroPorVeni	prince_jammys	 sudo fdisk  says  /dev/sda1 Boot *  ID 7 System HPFS/NTFS  at then it lists the linux and the linux swap says Partition table entries are not inin disk order
2010-07-10T08:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	ok, so your windows partition is there. see if it appears in the grub menu when you reboot.
2010-07-10T08:07:00.000Z	GuerreroPorVeni	prince_jammys	 I rebooted now but it still doesnt show me the xp in the grub,
2010-07-10T08:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	ok. i don't know the solution. Re-ask the question, mentioning that you ran ''sudo update-grub'' and that ''sudo fdisk -l'' shows and NTFS partition.
2010-07-10T08:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	*an NTFS partition, I mean.
2010-07-10T08:09:00.000Z	GuerreroPorVeni	prince_jammys	 ok thanks for ur help man, i will do the question again after trying a tuto i found in ubuntu forums , thanks for trying!
2010-07-10T08:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuerreroPorVeni	welcome. I doubt your data is lost.
2010-07-10T08:10:00.000Z	GuerreroPorVeni	prince_jammys	hehe nah it isnt i had this problem in past plus i can see my windows files form ubuntu still so its there
