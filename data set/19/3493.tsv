2011-04-27T02:37:00.000Z	xguru		anyone know how to create a symbolic link so firefox can use the jre java plugin?
2011-04-27T02:37:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	you sure your problem isn't that you have icedtea
2011-04-27T02:38:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	you sure your problem isn't that you have icedtea installed?
2011-04-27T02:38:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	 i just installed JDK and i guess JRE is included but i have to set a symbolic link so firefox knows where to look for the plugin?
2011-04-27T02:39:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	ok, that isn't hard that either, but I have never needed symlinks for java.
2011-04-27T02:39:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	from where to where you need to symlink?
2011-04-27T02:40:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	 i know how to create the link.....but i'm trying to do in in /home/*/.mozilla/plugins  and link that to ~/jdk*/jre/plugin/i386
2011-04-27T02:42:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	 /i386 has ns7 and ns7-gcc29.  I actually created the link to both and neither works....  do i have to do it in the firefox plugin folder?
2011-04-27T02:44:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	but I can't understand why you would have to make the links yourself, I have never done that to use java plugins...
2011-04-27T02:45:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	i have to manually do it cause i pulled the tar file from oracle instad of installing with apt-get
2011-04-27T02:45:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	 thanks for the help....  I'll gOoGlE some more
2011-04-27T02:45:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	then it seems more logical.
2011-04-27T02:50:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	I might have found what you need, if you didn't already find it yourself.
2011-04-27T02:50:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	  i'm still looking....   what do you have?
2011-04-27T02:51:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	http://en.kioskea.net/faq/853-installation-of-firefox-2-0-java-flash
2011-04-27T02:51:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	search for java installation
2011-04-27T02:52:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	unless it was intentional that you wanted it in your $HOME
2011-04-27T02:53:00.000Z	cybrhuman	xguru	sry, my assumptions were wrong. :(
2011-04-27T02:55:00.000Z	xguru	cybrhuman	 actually it worked...the symbolic link still operates the same.  example:  ln -sfv /usr/local/jre1.6.0/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /home/corey/.mozilla/plugins
