2005-08-25T14:38:00.000Z	nEmiSH		where is the correct place to ask question about HAL?
2005-08-25T14:38:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	well, there's one person in #hal ;)
2005-08-25T14:39:00.000Z	nEmiSH	crispynix-v6	ChanServ?
2005-08-25T14:39:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	dunno. you could ask here, I guess.
2005-08-25T14:39:00.000Z	nEmiSH		well i'm having a problem with hal's auto mounting a device
2005-08-25T14:40:00.000Z	nEmiSH		i have tried to create a FDI to get around these problems
2005-08-25T14:40:00.000Z	nEmiSH		FDI mounts to correct mount point but doesn't mount with correct fstype and mounts RO instead of RW
2005-08-25T14:41:00.000Z	nEmiSH		i know it works because I can mount using fstab entry and it mounts fine
2005-08-25T14:41:00.000Z	nEmiSH		just when HAL auto mounts it  seems to be the problem
2005-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	hrm, I'm not sure whether or not hal uses per-user options, but you could check the stuff in /etc/hal/ and documentation
2005-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	hal automount at least uses pmount iirc, which can be called by an unpriv user
2005-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	actually, nevermind (it can't)
2005-08-25T14:45:00.000Z	nEmiSH	crispynix-v6	 hal is trying to mount my UDF (Iomega REV drive) as a cdrom   fs=cdfss and ro...
2005-08-25T14:46:00.000Z	nEmiSH		if i mount through fstab or manually it mounts fs=udf, rw
2005-08-25T14:47:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	well, you probably need to change something in /etc/hal/, I don't know. There should be documentation that covers the intricacies of hal.
2005-08-25T14:49:00.000Z	nEmiSH	crispynix-v6	problem is rev drive appears to systems.. including windows as a CDrom drive because its UDF
2005-08-25T14:49:00.000Z	nEmiSH		i need to have HAL override that default behavior and specify that this can mount RW as opposed to RO
2005-08-25T14:50:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/hal
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	crispynix-v6	nEmiSH	aha, #freedesktop might be a better place to ask. gl :)
