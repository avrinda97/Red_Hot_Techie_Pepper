2009-01-04T22:14:00.000Z	the_squircle	Maggie	looks like it's not mounting... is the light on the drive coming on?

2009-01-04T22:16:00.000Z	the_squircle	Maggie	Go to the terminal, and type "cd /media", then type "ls", and see if there is a usb entry

2009-01-04T22:18:00.000Z	the_squircle	Maggie	then I can't help you... I don't know why your USB drive isn't being recognised. Someone else may be able to help. Sorry!

2009-01-04T22:20:00.000Z	the_squircle	Maggie	I'm sorry.... I'm not intelligent enough to know how to troubleshoot beyond this point.
