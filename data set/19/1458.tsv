2011-01-17T19:55:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	i'll check the forums for you...
2011-01-17T19:37:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	.conf files can be empty or missing if it has not differed from the default, i think it's called xorg.conf.failsafe or xorg.conf.default
2011-01-17T19:41:00.000Z	kanhiya	diddle	help me editing my xorg.conf file
2011-01-17T19:42:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	i don't know what you're trying to do, have you found it? is it full?
2011-01-17T19:43:00.000Z	kanhiya	diddle	no i do not find it and i WANT TO increase my resolution up to 1280X???
2011-01-17T19:44:00.000Z	kanhiya	diddle	my laptop is able to provide resolution up to 1280x??

2011-01-17T19:47:00.000Z	kanhiya	diddle	yes i have followed that path using windows explorer and i did not find any file named xorg.conf
2011-01-17T19:48:00.000Z	kanhiya	diddle	i am using ubuntu10.10
2011-01-17T19:48:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	which operating system are you using?
2011-01-17T19:49:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	oh

2011-01-17T19:50:00.000Z	kanhiya	diddle	i am not a expert i linux
2011-01-17T19:50:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	yes i figured but was worth checking hehe, i havn't used that yet (trying to install it on a dell) so i wouldn't know the difference yet
2011-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	on 10.04 it's still there, and as i havn't changed anything it's still called xorg.conf.failsafe have you one called that?
2011-01-17T19:58:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	yah... hehe, it seems they've decided to split it up in a new folder
2011-01-17T19:59:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	http://askubuntu.com/questions/4662/where-is-the-x-org-config-file-how-do-i-configure-x-there
2011-01-17T20:02:00.000Z	diddle	kanhiya	is that clear? those two commands (written exactly) should give you the xorg.conf everyone knows and loves (except forevernoobs like ourselves!)
