2007-12-08T03:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	you should use the generic kernel
2007-12-08T03:54:00.000Z	jpolonia		the happend is , i have a laptop with amd64

2007-12-08T03:54:00.000Z	jpolonia		and ubuntu 7.10 is so slowly
2007-12-08T03:54:00.000Z	jpolonia		and ubuntu 7.10 is so slowly
2007-12-08T03:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	your lines appear twice for some reason
2007-12-08T03:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	anyway, getting a i686 kernel isn't going to fix the slowness
2007-12-08T03:55:00.000Z	Chousuke		an*
2007-12-08T03:56:00.000Z	jpolonia		I need a kernel i686
2007-12-08T03:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	again, why?
2007-12-08T03:57:00.000Z	jpolonia		your think the kernel, it'ns the problem?
2007-12-08T03:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	most likely it isn't.
2007-12-08T03:58:00.000Z	jpolonia		what could it be?
2007-12-08T03:58:00.000Z	jpolonia		64 bit version
2007-12-08T04:00:00.000Z	jpolonia	aBound	64 bit version
2007-12-08T04:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	if you have 64-bit ubuntu installed and it's slow, try installing the i386 version
2007-12-08T04:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	jpolonia	for most users, it's the safer choice.
