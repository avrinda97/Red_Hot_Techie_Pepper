2006-04-19T10:42:00.000Z	doubletwist		Well that sucked...
2006-04-19T10:42:00.000Z	doubletwist		My ubuntu desktop got hacked on my birthday :(
2006-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	doubletwist		I'm still trying to figure out what was running that allowed them to hack in.
2006-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	doubletwist	what happened?
2006-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	doubletwist	Concord_Dawn	Someone rooted my desktop
2006-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	doubletwist	Concord_Dawn	a script kiddie I'm sure.
2006-04-19T10:45:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	doubletwist	first, cover the basics.
2006-04-19T10:45:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		update everything.
2006-04-19T10:45:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		and install a firewall of some sort. firestarter is good.
2006-04-19T10:46:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		after that, netstat -a and see what's listening.
2006-04-19T10:46:00.000Z	doubletwist	Concord_Dawn	No, I can't even boot. They hosed some binaries trying to replace them with their rootkit copies.
2006-04-19T10:46:00.000Z	doubletwist		I  know part of why they got in.
2006-04-19T10:47:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	doubletwist	format and start over then.
2006-04-19T10:47:00.000Z	doubletwist		I had set my router to use my IP as a DMZ temporarily while I was hosting a game in windoze. I forgot to turn it back off when I was done...
2006-04-19T10:47:00.000Z	doubletwist	Concord_Dawn	Yeah that's the plan.
2006-04-19T10:47:00.000Z	doubletwist	Concord_Dawn	Although I'm going to try to figure out what daemon or whatever they got in on.
2006-04-19T10:47:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	doubletwist	this computer I'm sitting on is DMZed right now.
2006-04-19T10:48:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	doubletwist	don't worry yourself about it. You probably won't find it anyways.
2006-04-19T10:48:00.000Z	doubletwist	Concord_Dawn	Well I didn't have iptables running either
