2006-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	Hammad		 Wait for the icons to convert
2006-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	Hammad		 Wait for the tar.gz or tar.bz2 to build
2006-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	Hammad		 Install using kcontrol

2006-10-13T15:06:00.000Z	bluefox83	Hammad	help for what?
2006-10-13T15:08:00.000Z	Hammad	bluefox83	- its for icons
2006-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	bluefox83	Hammad	read the README file
2006-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	Hammad	bluefox83	- i did lol the first step is run the builscript
2006-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	Hammad	bluefox83	- i dont even know how to do that, when i dbl click it does nothing
2006-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	bluefox83	Hammad	read more of the files then... but chances are you need to do it in a terminal
2006-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	Hammad	bluefox83	- um k like Konsole? what do i type to get to that file from terminal
2006-10-13T15:12:00.000Z	bluefox83	Hammad	you need to go to the ubuntu beginners page and read up...you need to learn what you are doing before changing your system
2006-10-13T15:12:00.000Z	bluefox83	Hammad	but you really should not need to run any build scripts to install icons..
