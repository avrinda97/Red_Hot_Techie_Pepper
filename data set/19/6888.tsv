2007-11-26T08:52:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	Did you try dpkg-reconfigure postgres...?
2007-11-26T08:56:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	yes, and no apparent change
2007-11-26T08:56:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	I would try apt-get remove --purge postgre.... and then try reinstalling it again.  If not I don't know where to go from there.
2007-11-26T08:56:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	I didn't try purge, let me try that
2007-11-26T08:57:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	You did get all the dependencies like postgre-common and everything?
2007-11-26T08:57:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	No, it seems to just appear to install, but nothing changes.
2007-11-26T08:58:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	I just installed it earlier today and it had to get about 8 other files.  Maybe right click on the postgresql file and look at it's dependencies to make sure they're being selected.
2007-11-26T08:59:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	I"m on a server via ssh, so everything from the command line
2007-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't tell ya how to search for a program's dependencies via command line.
2007-11-26T09:03:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	weird -- I don't know if it was adding postgresql-common to the install command, but it installed.  strange
2007-11-26T09:03:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	Good deal, it should have added the client as well along with some other dependencies.
2007-11-26T09:04:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	it did.  In trying to install gforge, I removed 8.2, installed 8.1, and generally mucked up everything.
2007-11-26T09:05:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	I'm still trying to figure out how to start postgre as an unprivileged user so it will work with the program I want to run.  :)
2007-11-26T09:06:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	sudo -- I found some instructions on allowing a non-priviledged user to execute a single command
2007-11-26T09:07:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	I tried running it as the postgre user but that still didn't allow my application to install.
2007-11-26T09:07:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	I'll probably just post the question in their forum.
2007-11-26T09:07:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	1s, let me refer you to something
2007-11-26T09:08:00.000Z	drmikecrowe	Centaur5	http://www.kforgeproject.com/doc/install  --- scroll down to section 2.1.  It was for apache, but would be easy to adopt for postgres
2007-11-26T09:09:00.000Z	Centaur5	drmikecrowe	Perfect, I'll check it out.  thanks.
