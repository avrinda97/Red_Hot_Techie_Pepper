2008-04-01T10:51:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	its disabled
2008-04-01T10:51:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	ok because it took me about 2 mons to realize that it was still enabled for me... drove me batsh*t crazy
2008-04-01T10:53:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	I would try firing up wireshark and taking a peek
2008-04-01T10:53:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	wireshark?
2008-04-01T10:54:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	will that tell me what ports are open and all that?
2008-04-01T10:54:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	the IRCD works with localhost
2008-04-01T10:56:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	well what exactly happens
2008-04-01T10:57:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	i can connect using localhost as the server, but when i use my external ip, nothing works
2008-04-01T10:57:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	do you have a router?
2008-04-01T10:57:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	yes and all port forwarding has been set up
2008-04-01T10:59:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	Im not sure what your issue could be
2008-04-01T10:59:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	when i use nmapfe to scan my external IP, no ports are open
2008-04-01T10:59:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	I would just do an nmap scan andcheck out wireshark
2008-04-01T11:00:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	well those bad boys need tobe open... especailly 80
2008-04-01T11:00:00.000Z	Erickj92	symptom	they are open in my router
2008-04-01T11:02:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	sorry i gotta go, good luck
2008-04-02T06:16:00.000Z	symptom	Erickj92	did you figure out that apache issue?
