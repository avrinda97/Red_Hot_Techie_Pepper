2010-07-19T10:28:00.000Z	cablop		i like svn, never tried git, and thinking why must i need to change my cvs?
2010-07-19T10:29:00.000Z	cablop		no no, murder is not what we want
2010-07-19T10:29:00.000Z	cablop		maybe rsync? dunno how rsync works
2010-07-19T10:30:00.000Z	cablop		would rsync let me slect what changes to propagate?
2010-07-19T10:31:00.000Z	cablop		and i find WinSCP is not missing changes, what you miust care is the times you use when you do
2010-07-19T10:31:00.000Z	cablop		i deal with text, images and so on
2010-07-19T10:32:00.000Z	cablop		i use for example for the followinf scenario
2010-07-19T10:32:00.000Z	cablop		i had a wordpress on server, then it upgraded a plugin, changing files and deleting others, also adding a few more, then i bring here just what had changed, and then i subversion the local copy
2010-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	cablop		but sometimes, i don't want to bring here the log files or some other small files i was going to delete, for example 50 language modules i don't want or need to backup, not either transfer, then i want to select what to sync here before startint the transfer
2010-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	You can --exclude= folders and files.
2010-07-19T10:35:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	In fact, you can even give it a text file listing of the files you want with --files-from= .
2010-07-19T10:56:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	Use ie4linux.
2010-07-19T10:56:00.000Z	cablop	jpds	ie4linux is not a solution, i need to be able to test ie6 ie7 ie8 and ie9 , easy to do insalling ietester on windows
2010-07-20T18:25:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	Because it's not supported and Ubuntu isn't designed to be used that way.
2010-07-20T22:44:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	chmod 0700 them.
2010-07-20T22:44:00.000Z	cablop	jpds	yes i thought that, but if i do, then i can't access them too...
2010-07-20T22:45:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	Not if chown them to yourself.
2010-07-20T22:46:00.000Z	cablop	jpds	how to hide them?
2010-10-06T01:19:00.000Z	jpds	cablop	Righto.
