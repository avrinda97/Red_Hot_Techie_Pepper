2010-08-30T03:51:00.000Z	kisuke	owen1_	looks like you will have to get an adapter for bluetoth
2010-08-30T03:51:00.000Z	owen1_	kisuke	or buy keyboard with a dongle
2010-08-30T03:51:00.000Z	kisuke	owen1_	calafofnia, USA?
2010-08-30T03:51:00.000Z	owen1_	kisuke	yeah
2010-08-30T03:53:00.000Z	kisuke	owen1_	not nessacarly, not of those use a protocol that is not blue tooth, so its a single purpose USB port really, if you get a bluetooth adapter, you will have ythe ability to add to your system later, say keyboard now, and a bluetooth headset, etc
2010-08-30T03:54:00.000Z	owen1_	kisuke	true. microsoft arc keyboard comes with wireless usb. it's not bluetooth.
