2011-08-11T07:31:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	try #blender
2011-08-11T07:31:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	I come from there. I may ask again...
2011-08-11T07:35:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	what does blender player do?
2011-08-11T07:35:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	no. it's a game engine.
2011-08-11T07:35:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	play blender made game.
2011-08-11T07:36:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	did you install from source or from package
2011-08-11T07:38:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	not from source. not from package. I just run it after unpack. blender 2.5 is not in source. the source has a really old version.
2011-08-11T07:38:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	I download it directly from official website.
2011-08-11T07:42:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	im downloading it now
2011-08-11T07:45:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	hey it seems my system cant run blender
2011-08-11T07:45:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	I am asking in #blendercoders. one guy gave me the answer: blender uses bundled python3. blenderplayer by default use OS python installation. by default I think ubuntu don't install python3. that's the problem. he said he had a fix for this. I need to download it later from official website.
2011-08-11T07:46:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	then you must install python3
2011-08-11T08:24:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	yeah, it doesn't work. I did many test including using import script.
2011-08-11T08:07:00.000Z	sgo11	linuxuz3r	milamber, sorry about the late reply, I was busy to ask questions in blender channel. I knew the solution. it's because of the python version. blenderplayer don't use bundled python by default. thanks a lot for the help.
2011-08-11T08:14:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	ok cool
2011-08-11T08:23:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	i tried print screen on my keyboard but its not working
2011-08-11T08:28:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	sgo11	does not work with menus are open
