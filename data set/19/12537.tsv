2005-10-02T08:29:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		haha, cheaper indeed
2005-10-02T08:29:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		the steam account i use is my pal's
2005-10-02T08:30:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		i just started playing CSS last week, he played a lot but now he's on tour with his band, so i offered to keep it warm for him
2005-10-02T08:31:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		gxine is a pretty spiffy player
2005-10-02T08:31:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		does pretty much anything if you set it up right
2005-10-02T08:32:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		!RestrictedFormats
2005-10-02T08:32:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		^look at what ubotu said >.>
2005-10-02T08:33:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		if you have the right repository all you need to do is apt-get install realplayer
2005-10-02T08:33:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		simple as can be
2005-10-02T08:33:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	doesn't realplayer suck though?
2005-10-02T08:34:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel	dooglus	right you are
2005-10-02T08:38:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	you can resume torrents - no need to restart
2005-10-02T08:38:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel	dooglus	but it's a pain to get them to resume in linux
2005-10-02T08:38:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	it is?  why?  all you do is make sure the data is in place and it'll resume
2005-10-14T12:42:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	did you find the option yet?
2005-10-14T12:43:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	see the stripy thing just to the left of the window list?  right-click it and say 'properties'
2005-10-14T12:43:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	oops, I went over all windowsy there.  I means 'preferences'
2005-10-14T12:44:00.000Z	dooglus	Pickle_Weasel	found it?
