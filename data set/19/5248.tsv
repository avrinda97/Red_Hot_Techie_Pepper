2008-08-05T09:23:00.000Z	jsjones		when I upgraded to 8.04, I overwrite all my video card config files, so now I have no 3d support. is there anyway I can get them back?
2008-08-05T09:24:00.000Z	jsjones		mecha25: no. I'm screwed aren't I?
2008-08-05T09:24:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	you are human, so yes you are by default. no matter what
2008-08-05T09:26:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	what videocard?
2008-08-05T09:27:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	ati X1400
2008-08-05T09:28:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	I have all the restricted drivers and such, but I overwrote my xorg.conf and a bunch of other files when I updated
2008-08-05T09:31:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	do you have a GUI? e.g. is it using VESA or fglrx?
2008-08-05T09:31:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	or is X barfing when you try to start it?
2008-08-05T09:31:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	gnome is working fine, using fglrx
2008-08-05T09:32:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	glxinfo then .pastebin the result
2008-08-05T10:06:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	a while ago you told me to run glxinfo, and it says "Segmentation fault"
2008-08-05T10:06:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	bad fglrx install. how did you install the drivers exactly?
2008-08-05T10:07:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	I don't remember, it was over a year ago.
2008-08-05T10:07:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	dpkg -l |grep fglrx
2008-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	are you running feisty?
2008-08-05T10:09:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	hardy
2008-08-05T10:09:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	then install hardy fglrx drivers
2008-08-05T10:09:00.000Z	jsjones	wols	will they install if I install all the updates?
2008-08-05T10:10:00.000Z	wols	jsjones	no clue but you can install it explicitly right now
