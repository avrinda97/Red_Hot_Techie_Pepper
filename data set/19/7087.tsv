2007-10-12T09:22:00.000Z	^brandon^		I cant seem to get my install of ubuntu 7.04 to connect to the internet.  Neither my onboard ethernet port (marvel 88e8001) nor my pci ethernet card (Realtek rtl8139) will connect.  Anyone know why this is?  I have my ifconfig pasted here : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/40389/
2007-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	how did you try to connect? dhcp?
2007-10-12T09:24:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	yes, DHCP
2007-10-12T09:24:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	and what command did you use?
2007-10-12T09:24:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	command?  i dont follow
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	what steps did you take to try connecting the card
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	i have tried ifdown and ifup
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	try "dhclient eth0" and see what it says (or try with eth1 if that's the card you want)
2007-10-12T09:30:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	did that work for you?
2007-10-12T09:30:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	here is the result from dhclient that i did yesterday : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/40395/
2007-10-12T09:31:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	you sure there's a dhcp server listening?
2007-10-12T09:32:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	i take it this card is plugged into a cable modem or so?
2007-10-12T09:32:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	yeah its plugged into the cable modem, in that paste the modem was plugged into eth0, nothing was plugged into eth1
2007-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	might try looking at your cable modem logs, if you can get to them. does the link work under windows?
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	yeah, that's a good point. if you've switched cards, some modems get confused by the new MAC
2007-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	: as far as whether or not DHCP server is listening?  I have no idea as i dont know much about this stuff, i dont this its a prob with the modem as i am using the same cable right now, just switching it back and forth from computer to computer when needed
2007-10-12T09:35:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	ah, then try MasterShrek's suggestion. bet your modem is confused by the changed card
2007-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	^brandon^	sipior	: sorry I missed MasterShrek's suggestion and I cant seem to find it
2007-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	sipior	^brandon^	power cycle your cable modem
