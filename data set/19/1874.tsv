2010-11-02T19:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	install unp , it works best
2010-11-02T19:36:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	time you learned to use the cli type unp pathtofilename in the terminal , if the file is in your home folder , right click on the file choose properties/permissions , check the executable , copy the filename from the title box and paste it after unp in the terminal, the file will uncompress into a folder in your /home dir
2010-11-02T19:38:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	do u mean I should do that for 20 files just to have them unzipped in the same folder
2010-11-02T19:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	if it's a media file choose the first one with video content , it will then unzip/uncompress the rest of the files in order into one video / media file
2010-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	should it be like unp /home/Downloads/Symantec.Norton.Ghost.v15.0.Incl.Keymaker-CORE/cr-ngh1a.zip
2010-11-02T19:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	yes, but Norton ghost is a windows application , are you going to use wimne to run it ?
2010-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	just need to edit one file which my antivirus on Win machine removed it
2010-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	which command is the right one ?
2010-11-02T19:57:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	pls tell me which command is the right one
2010-11-02T19:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	why are trying to install norton ghost, it's not an antivirus , it's a disk manager -diskimaging application
2010-11-02T19:58:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	i know.....pls tell me which command is the right one
2010-11-02T19:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	norton ghost won't run on linux without wine , if at all
2010-11-02T19:59:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	i know...i will not run it....i wil look into one file in the zip only
2010-11-02T20:00:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	pls tell me which command to use
2010-11-02T20:02:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	did so...it did not unzip the file nor the serials
2010-11-02T20:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	tell me the name of the file ...I gave instructions earlier , but you didn't read them , I guess
2010-11-02T20:04:00.000Z	anygivenname	BluesKaj	i read & asked u which commands out of the 2 i pasted but u never answered
2010-11-02T20:07:00.000Z	BluesKaj	anygivenname	I'll say this only once . Windows applications may or may not have linux equivalents or couterparts , but windows apps , most of them anyway won't run in linux unless you try to run them in wine and even then they may not work
