2010-01-22T06:19:00.000Z	DasEi		k, but you can see graphically in gparted about partis location , or use sudo fdisk -l, ubuntuUserTom
2010-01-22T06:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	I've got a Dell that apparently won't play with lm_sensors...
2010-01-22T06:22:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	no sensors found ?
2010-01-22T06:22:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	correct
2010-01-22T06:23:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	so you got to find the correct modules youself then, Im sure for cpu temp least there are somes
2010-01-22T06:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	if this thing runs for an hour without shutting down, I'm going to call it good and blame it on dust in the fan/radiator assembly
2010-01-22T06:25:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	you could stress the cpu some time, then reboot in bios and look for temp, quick n dirty
2010-01-22T06:26:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	what's the best way to do that?
2011-01-07T07:43:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	sudo apt-get install pastebinit && pastebinit /etc/fstab
2011-01-07T07:43:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	what are those?
2011-01-07T07:43:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	spills an url of your fstab to look at here
2011-01-07T07:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	It's really only this: UUID=accc748f-6a4b-4fba-b40f-2c62406a692e that's throwing me for a loop.  Back when I was a wee lad, I used to just put in something that looked like /dev/sdc1
2011-01-07T07:46:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	both works , its a uuid
2011-01-07T07:47:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	sudo blkid for a list
2011-01-07T07:47:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	do I even want to know the rationale?  Is this something legit, or another one of those "buttons on the left" things.  ;)
2011-01-07T07:47:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	that strings nowadays stand for the old /dev/whatever
2011-01-07T07:48:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	it is, as a unique identifier is found, even if you swap drives,  a /dev/.. won't do it there
2011-01-07T07:49:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DasEi	so this: UUID="4A80FF4380FF3453" /bigdrive       ntfs    errors=remount-ro 0       1                 should work?
2011-01-07T07:50:00.000Z	DasEi	craigbass1976	yess, but don't forget the options (aka user,exe or desired)
