2010-02-01T03:49:00.000Z	smw		does anyone know what ubuntu uses for tab completion in bash? For example, if I write apt-get it knows my options are install, update, ect
2010-02-01T03:50:00.000Z	edbian	smw	What do you mean "what Ubuntu Uses"  tab completion is built into bash
2010-02-01T03:50:00.000Z	smw	edbian	then what does it use for tab completion? It is different from any other distro
2010-02-01T03:52:00.000Z	edbian	smw	I never noticed!  Thanks for teaching me something knew
2010-02-01T03:52:00.000Z	smw	edbian	I miss the ubuntu commandline when I use arch, debian, ect
2010-02-01T03:52:00.000Z	edbian	smw	Arch is nice isn't it? :)
2010-02-01T03:53:00.000Z	edbian	smw	My debian seems to be the same as ubuntu (at least with apt-get [tab][tab])
2010-02-01T03:53:00.000Z	smw	edbian	I just installed it a yesterday. I already have it working like ubuntu :-)
2010-02-01T03:53:00.000Z	smw	edbian	I guess I have been using older versions of debian
2010-02-01T03:53:00.000Z	edbian	smw	Possibly
2010-08-20T05:34:00.000Z	smw	edbian	if he is a self proclaimed n00b, why are you encouraging him to use arch?
2010-08-20T05:34:00.000Z	edbian	smw	Because a noob should learn?
2010-08-20T05:35:00.000Z	edbian	smw	Why does being a self-proclaimed noob forfeit the right to learn?
2010-08-20T05:35:00.000Z	smw	edbian	because I have a different option of what a n00b is than he does apparently :-)
2010-08-20T05:36:00.000Z	edbian	smw	 :)
2011-04-03T22:57:00.000Z	smw	edbian	no, in theory they are slow and stupid
2011-04-03T22:57:00.000Z	edbian	smw	In practice they are 'ERROR: UNDETERMINED TYPE'
2011-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	smw	LAMP is be definition not windows :)
2011-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	smw	edbian	exactly ;-)
