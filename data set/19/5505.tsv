2008-06-15T22:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	i agree, i think that card should work w/ the restricted driver mgr./hardware drivers.
2008-06-15T22:46:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	But what happened after I installed it is that the Hardware Drivers manager syas it's in use, but the Enabled column/checkbox is unchecked. And I'm stuck with really big letters and low resolution. Do you know how to fix this?
2008-06-15T22:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	do you have the restricted driver enabled right now?
2008-06-15T22:47:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	No. But it says it's "In use"
2008-06-15T22:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	check it and mark it enabled, you'll be triggered to restart, then come back here.
2008-06-15T22:48:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	If I enable it, what happends is that it asks to restart. I restart and upon bootup I am asked to choose which card and monitor I have. Then I do that, and I'm back to where I was before. I've been doing that four times already
2008-06-15T22:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	hmm.. ok.
2008-06-15T22:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	open a terminal, and type, "sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings" no quotes, and install it.
2008-06-15T22:51:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	nvidia-settings is installed. Then what :)
2008-06-15T22:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	opena  terminal and type gksudo nvidia-settings
2008-06-15T22:52:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	I got "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server"
2008-06-15T22:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	hmm, well i've never had to do that, but its as good an idea as any, try runnning sudo nvidia-xconfig
2008-06-15T22:54:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	Do I open a new terminal window or just close Nvidia X Server Settings?
2008-06-15T22:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	just close nvidia x server settings, and you should be able to use the same terminal window.
2008-06-15T22:55:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	that was odd. can you look at this ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/20428/
2008-06-15T22:56:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	Should I restart my computer now?
2008-06-15T22:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mich1	yes, i would restart, then go to nvidia-settings  and set your resolution there
2008-06-15T22:57:00.000Z	mich1	IndyGunFreak	Ok. Be right back thanks
