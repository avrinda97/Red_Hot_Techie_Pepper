2009-02-18T18:16:00.000Z	Arjuna		wtf, internet works only for pinging and nothing more. 8.04
2009-02-18T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	can you ping names and ip addresses
2009-02-18T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	can you telnet to: www.google.com 80
2009-02-18T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	have you configured a firewall?
2009-02-18T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	the port number needs a space not a /
2009-02-18T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	ok so to clarify, you can ping IPs and Ping names which resolve successfully, but http traffic via firefox is no good and apt-getting is no good
2009-02-18T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	are you connected to a router?
2009-02-18T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	can yo http to that ?
2009-02-18T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	then your router is funny as http traffic can flow in and out of your system freely
2009-02-18T18:23:00.000Z	Arjuna	ActionParsnip1	funny is that on my debian box witch is connected to lan1 everything works great, on lan2 with ubuntu 8.04 i have this problem
2009-02-18T18:23:00.000Z	Arjuna	ActionParsnip1	router is firmwared with OpenWrt
2009-02-18T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	whatever your system's gateway is is not giving the ubuntu system its requested html conent but will allow pings
2009-02-18T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	maybe if you use a public proxy (just to test) it may work
2009-02-18T18:24:00.000Z	Arjuna	ActionParsnip1	will tru
2009-02-18T18:24:00.000Z	Arjuna	ActionParsnip1	will try
2009-02-18T18:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	the fact you can http to an internal device means your browser is ok and traffic can get in and out of your system so is not an ubuntu issue
2009-02-18T18:40:00.000Z	Arjuna	ActionParsnip1	why would router not forward ubuntu box dont understand, maybe is dhcp issue
2009-02-18T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	possibly, check ifconfig on ubuntu and ipconfig on windows to check ips
2009-02-18T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Arjuna	maybe you have a conflicting mac address
