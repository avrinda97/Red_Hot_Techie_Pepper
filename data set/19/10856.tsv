2006-07-12T08:47:00.000Z	Crescendo		What's an equivalent to Dreamweaver on Linux?
2006-07-12T08:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Can't remember its name, let me check...
2006-07-12T08:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Might possibly be "august", but do a "apt-cache search wysiwyg"
2006-07-12T08:50:00.000Z	Crescendo	Stormx2	I'm not so interested in the wysiwyg functionality as I am the constant FTP version...
2006-07-12T08:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	FTP is a bit of a bummer in ubuntu, but I found a great client, actually a firefox extension, called FireFTP
2006-07-12T08:55:00.000Z	Crescendo	Stormx2	I like FireFTP... but more on the Dreamweaver thing, I love to be able to open a file, press CTRL-S, and it saves to the FTP, like the "coder" method in Dreamweaver.
2006-07-12T08:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Ah... Well you can use gnome to do that, I think.
2006-07-12T08:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	They improved the FTP support in dapper. If you go to Places > Connect to server, set it all up, then it will come up in your file open dialog.
2006-07-12T08:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	I can actually open them fine.
2006-07-12T09:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Ah, its read only tho!
2006-07-12T09:01:00.000Z	Crescendo	Stormx2	I'm opening a PHP file off my FTP now.
2006-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Its read only, so its pretty useless.
2006-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Possibly tho, you could make a small program which does it.
2006-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	I could even do one, in bash.
2006-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Asign it a keyboard shortcut.. and voila ;)
2006-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	Crescendo	Stormx2	I'm not a coder exactly, and I don't know how to do that, either.  Perhaps you can point me in the right direction?
2006-07-12T09:03:00.000Z	Crescendo	Stormx2	my workaround has been to wget the entire FTP site recursively and only updated files, and then modify locally, upload each one.
2006-07-12T09:05:00.000Z	Crescendo	Stormx2	what do you use over XMMS?
2006-07-12T09:05:00.000Z	Stormx2	Crescendo	Audacious. Very good media player. last.fm support in the box, some transparency support, very lightweight, etc...
