2009-03-28T23:11:00.000Z	user___	neo_	recheck step 4 from the howto. make sure your file runaptana.sh is identical to the guide. its not yet (judging from your channel paste, please do pastebin next time)
2009-03-28T23:14:00.000Z	user___	neo_	you need to point to an executable, not just a path
2009-03-29T00:47:00.000Z	user___	neo_	ok, great! :-)
