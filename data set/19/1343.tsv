2011-02-20T20:52:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	hi
2011-02-20T20:53:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	:D
2011-02-20T20:53:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	i have 3 folders under that directory.
2011-02-20T20:54:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	 i have no folders under /trash
2011-02-20T20:54:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	well, since its Trash i wouldn't worry about it
2011-02-20T20:56:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	There isn't a /folder subdir under /trash that the track can panel is located in?. IE the trash location is in '/trash'?
2011-02-20T20:57:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	trash panel?
2011-02-20T21:01:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	 what happens is if I delete something, it doesn't show up in the trashcan.  I tried deleting the trash can icon on the desktop panel and adding the trashcan again and it did the same thing...
2011-02-20T21:02:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	so when you delete stuff it doesn't get moved to TrasH?
2011-02-20T21:03:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	 and it doesnt seem to 'permanently delete' it either because it is saying my /home folders alloted space is full 100%
2011-02-20T21:03:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	hah nice
2011-02-20T21:05:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	 do you know why it seem to not be deleting the ifles permanently nor temporarily in the trash can?
2011-02-20T21:05:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	if your disk is still full, they're not being deleted. they're being moved somewhere. perhaps you're looking int he wrong place
2011-02-20T21:06:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	 ok
2011-02-20T21:06:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	do you have a big file you can delete, or have deleted?
2011-02-20T21:06:00.000Z	jack_	cjo232	^
2011-02-20T21:07:00.000Z	cjo232	jack_	^
