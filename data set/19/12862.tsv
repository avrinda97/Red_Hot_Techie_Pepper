2005-07-21T06:46:00.000Z	Cooner750		can I get a answer here?
2005-07-21T06:47:00.000Z	Cooner750		how dependable is GParted?
2005-07-21T06:47:00.000Z	Cooner750		i'm backing up stuff right now just in case. I'm resizing a FAT32 Partition and adding a EXT3 Partition in the empty space
2005-07-21T06:48:00.000Z	Cooner750		Will Ubuntu install on a EXT3 partition?
2005-07-21T06:48:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	I've done that very thing, after backing up, had no problems
2005-07-21T06:49:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	yes, Ubuntu likes ext3
2005-07-21T06:54:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	with an external / you might need to make a /boot on the internal drive
2005-07-21T07:09:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	I do believe the Ubuntu install cd promises it can resize windows partitions
2005-07-21T07:09:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	and you can definitely create your new partitions with it
2005-07-21T07:10:00.000Z	Cooner750	anto9us	ok
2005-07-21T07:11:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	the choice is yours
2005-07-21T07:12:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	that was your brain at fault, not your fingers ;)
2005-07-21T07:13:00.000Z	Cooner750	anto9us	true :P
2005-07-21T07:14:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	yes, the letter indicates the device and the number the partition on that device
2005-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	if that's the first partition you've created on your external usb driver, yes.
2005-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	I'm still betting you'll need a /boot on your internal drive
2005-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	that's big enough, yes
2005-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	about 1 and half times your memory and just select the swap mount point, the format should be automatic
2006-03-23T16:02:00.000Z	anto9us	Cooner750	try pressing ctrl+c and it may continue
