2007-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	the ubuntu iso is already compressed..
2007-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	right click the iso and write to cd
2007-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	most new cds have that..
2007-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	even if it says 701 meg free. it will still work
2007-07-31T16:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	You dont need nautilus to burn..
2007-07-31T16:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	You can get nautilus by typing it in a terminal/cli
2007-07-31T16:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	Insert a blank cd.. they usually say 700 meg on them anyhow...  next.. right click the *.iso and select write to dick.
2007-07-31T16:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	do they have any number on them like 650 or 700..
2007-07-31T16:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	Are you sure there is nothing already on those cd's
2007-07-31T16:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	I need to ask a dumb question, are you sure you have the shiny sude down.
2007-07-31T16:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	then there is no reason they will not work
2007-07-31T05:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hustlebird	yes
