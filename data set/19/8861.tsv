2007-01-24T08:14:00.000Z	bauer77		what is the command to see if my 3d rendering is working
2007-01-24T08:15:00.000Z	bauer77		ati radeon 9700
2007-01-24T08:15:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	glxinfo
2007-01-24T08:15:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	glxgears
2007-01-24T08:16:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	those two do the trick. Plus if you try out glxinfo |grep direct then you know if you have direct rendering enabled.
2007-01-24T08:18:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	have you installed the fglrx package?
2007-01-24T08:19:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	try to use my name, I'll spot your messages easier. :) up arrow gives you the previous message
2007-01-24T08:20:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	have you tinkered with xorg.conf yet?
2007-01-24T08:21:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	oh, now it says that you've got ati in there..
2007-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	I had this issue today; I had updated nvidia, and had multiple ones installed. it led into it not working correctly.
2007-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	can this be the case in here?
2007-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	I was able to track it down by using aptitude.
2007-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	You might also want to try envy script. (Although I think it's automation was part of my problem..)
2007-01-24T08:26:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	have you set the modules right? X server loads different modules at startup.
2007-01-24T08:26:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	It is pretty well described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2007-01-24T08:27:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	But I'll run you through it.
2007-01-24T08:27:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	Ok, sure. If you have questions about it, I'll be here.
2007-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	Did you get it to work?
2007-01-24T12:06:00.000Z	mustaukko	bauer77	great!
