2009-01-27T11:40:00.000Z	n8tuser		holyguyver-> type mk and press tab twice to see the commands
2009-01-27T11:40:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	thanks
2009-01-27T11:42:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	Which of those commands will make an ext3 file system?
2009-01-27T11:44:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	my hints are confusing.
2009-01-27T11:45:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	it is actually not there
2009-01-27T11:46:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	I did that
2009-01-27T11:46:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	I did that the first time you told me to
2009-01-27T11:48:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	I have read the list again & again & again mke3fs is not there. & I insist on mke3fs because that is what Baughn instructed me to use.
2009-01-27T11:48:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	then can you please help me?
2009-01-27T11:49:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	but if he was wrong about that, he might have given me the wrong commons all the way down making mk anything useless.
2009-01-27T11:50:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	I am trying to say that now with him being wrong about that I am lost I do not know what to do at all & I have no commands to use at all nor any instructions, only a problem that you do not know about.
2009-01-27T11:53:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	I have a external harddrive that I a year & a half ago dropped onto the floor from 4 feet, I need to remap the harddrive around the disk errors.
2009-01-27T11:55:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	So now you are saying that your hints are not good? :p
2009-01-27T11:56:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	but I do not want to make a ext3 filesystem
2009-01-27T11:57:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	Yes I know the commands are listed from that hint & as said I did it & read it the first time you gave it. But I do not want to make an ext3 filesystem. I was only asking about that because that is what Baughn told me to do. I actually want an ntfs filesystem, but he said I should not.
2009-01-27T12:09:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	see read what flannel said, I was right :p
2009-01-27T12:10:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	how so? Flannel justr said that mke3fs does not exist.
2009-01-27T12:11:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	No I did not insist on looking for it Flannel hust told me to use it.
2009-01-27T12:11:00.000Z	holyguyver	n8tuser	I am only doing what Baughn  & Flannel  tells me to do.
