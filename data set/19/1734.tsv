2010-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	mrk_		the problem is as i have stated it, my computer does not shut down when i enter 'shut down'
2010-10-31T21:07:00.000Z	alakhia	mrk_	does the screen turn black but the machine doesn't power down?
2010-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	mrk_	alakhia	more or less...the screen fades and is black but there is text on it saying that the order to kill was given
