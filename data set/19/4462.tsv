2010-07-26T13:39:00.000Z	mats990		Hi! When i click right click on panel i have only "help" and "about panels". Does anybody know how to add new panel?
2010-07-26T13:40:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	really? never seen that before. Any idea what happened?
2010-07-26T13:41:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	i could make screenshot if you want.. i tried google it but found nothing useful
2010-07-26T13:42:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	tried to reset the panels completely? gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/panel && killall gnome-panel
2010-07-26T13:43:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	i didnt know about this, but i did it right now and nothing changed :(
2010-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	too bad. Since that's the way to reset "to factory defaults".. Actually i have no clue what could cause this. Any recent changes?
2010-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	the problem is i dont know WHEN this happend... i didnt used it lately.. last things i installed is conky and i removed some old kernels, but this shuldnt have something with kernel...
2010-07-26T13:49:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	agreed. It must be something in the gnome (-panel) config. But with previous command you reset it w/out result. (btw Those settings are saved in your homedir in ~/.gconf/apps/panel)
2010-07-26T13:50:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	ok, thank you very much.. i'll try to do some googling and try to understand settings in my home to fix it
2010-07-26T13:52:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	Sure. Gnome has config options (somewhat similar to registry) You can see that yourself by starting "gconf-editor" (and in this case browse to apps > panel)
2010-07-26T13:52:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	hey i fixed it :D
2010-07-26T13:52:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	wow
2010-07-26T13:52:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	google is my god :D http://www.watchingthenet.com/restore-panels-in-ubuntu-back-to-their-default-settings.html
2010-07-26T13:53:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	there is one line different and it deletes settings folder, as i can see
2010-07-26T13:53:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	indeed
2010-07-26T13:53:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	that's what did the trick probably
2010-07-26T13:54:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	to tell you the truth im not happy that i have fixed it couse i dont know what couse probelm, i wish i had backuped that folder first :S
2010-07-26T13:55:00.000Z	oCean_	mats990	I see. Maybe next time :s
2010-07-26T13:55:00.000Z	mats990	oCean_	well i have to go, thanks once again for tring to help me. have a nice day, good bye
