2008-11-10T13:14:00.000Z	Kartagis		Package ttf-thryomanes is not available, but is referred to by another package. <--- how do i find that?
2008-11-10T13:15:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	please paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to paste.ubuntu.com, and say which package you were trying to install
2008-11-10T13:17:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	http://pastebin.com/f733ec859 and ttf-thryomanes
2008-11-10T13:20:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	as in, you were specifically trying to install ttf-thyromanes, not some other package that depends on it?
2008-11-10T13:21:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	If so, your problem is that that package was removed from Ubuntu after gutsy, because it was a universe package and was removed from Debian per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=407711
2008-11-10T13:22:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	According to that bug report, you could try ttf-dejavu (note that the bug report spells the package name incorrectly) instead
2008-11-10T13:24:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	what should I do for typing in IPA? I'd been trying to get ttf-thryomanes for that. and I have ttf-dejavu installed
2008-11-10T13:25:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	I think Deja Vu has the IPA symbols. Lemmie go check.
2008-11-10T13:28:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	mmm, the latest version of Deja Vu Sans definitely has them. Not sure about the version in hardy, but it probably does.
2008-11-10T13:28:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	how do I use them?
2008-11-10T13:28:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	I read I could use IPA with SCIM
2008-11-10T13:30:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	not sure, to be honest. I don't have much experience with SCIM. The SCIM IRC channel is #scim on this server, though; maybe ask there :)
2010-03-30T12:20:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	assuming that Lucid and the PPA use the same packagename, it'd continue using the PPA because the version number there is higher.
2010-03-30T12:21:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	good
2010-04-29T13:29:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	xorg.conf is no longer created by default; Xorg autodetects instead. If you create one, it will use settings in it instead of autodetecting them.
2010-04-29T13:29:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	what I want to do is change the resolution
2010-04-29T15:36:00.000Z	Kartagis	rww	thanks
2010-12-15T12:04:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	install the 'boinc-manager' package, then open Boinc Manager and attach to the SETI@home project. It'll download the app itself. Using the one in the repos is probably not the best idea.
2011-06-22T11:43:00.000Z	rww	Kartagis	notify-osd isn't a service.
