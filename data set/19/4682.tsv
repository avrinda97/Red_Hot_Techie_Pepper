2008-11-28T19:54:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	yes, I understand that. Do you know what kind of cable you are using for the connection from your laptop to you tv?
2008-11-28T19:57:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	ok, good.
2008-11-28T19:59:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	you need to enable s-video in you xorg.conf
2008-11-28T20:00:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	ption "TVOutFormat" "SVIDEO" -- in xorg.conf
2008-11-28T20:00:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	option "TVOutFormat" "SVIDEO" -- in xorg.conf
2008-11-28T20:02:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	xorg.conf is a file that handles your x11 display. You will need to change or add the entry
2008-11-28T20:04:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf back up the orginal
2008-11-28T20:11:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	It looks like you need to install the drivers for your card. Take a look here and see if it helps http://www.backports.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=843764&highlight=S3+ProSavage+DDR
2008-11-28T20:13:00.000Z	exodus_ms	heogen	unlike windoze sometimes in ubuntu you will need to install restricted drivers because of proprietary reasons
