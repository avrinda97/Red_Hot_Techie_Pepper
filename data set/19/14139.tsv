2004-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	enntee		Does Warty get regular software updates?
2004-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	enntee		seems like there are some older packages in it
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	enntee		damn.
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	for security and critical data loss only
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	the next regular update of warty will be in april.  it's called hoary.
2004-12-19T15:30:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	there is a compromise that must be struck between bleeding-edge-new and stability
2004-12-19T15:32:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	certainly outside of the support model
2004-12-19T15:32:00.000Z	enntee	lamont_r	yeah... but is it pretty do-able for someone familiar with debian?
2004-12-19T15:33:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	the preferred method (if you must grab newer versions), is to grab the source (apt-get source foo - after adding a deb-src line pointing to debian), and then dpkg-buildpackage
2004-12-19T15:34:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	the concern relates to library versions and such, mixed with the fact that apt/dpkg/whatever believe that all copies of foo_1.1_i386.deb are identical in the world.
2004-12-19T15:35:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	yeah
2004-12-19T15:38:00.000Z	enntee	lamont_r	would it be better to have a deb-src line pointed at hoary in order to get newer versions of packages?
2004-12-19T15:39:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	you could list both, and get the latest of the two...
2004-12-19T15:39:00.000Z	enntee	lamont_r	cool, thanks
2004-12-19T15:46:00.000Z	enntee	lamont_r	anything you can do when apt says it can't satisfy build-dep's?
2004-12-19T15:48:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	satisfy them. :-(
2004-12-19T15:48:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	I generally wind up dumping Build-Depends from debian-control, and installing them one at a time to figure out which one is the problem child.
2004-12-19T15:50:00.000Z	enntee	lamont_r	yeah, i'm considering just running hoary, but I'm not real wild about my workstation using experimental software.
2004-12-19T15:51:00.000Z	lamont_r	enntee	we call it "dogfood" :-)
