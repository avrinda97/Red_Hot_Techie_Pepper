2006-01-24T17:28:00.000Z	ulrik		this channel should have sub-channels
2006-01-24T17:28:00.000Z	ulrik		someone want to break out some?
2006-01-24T17:28:00.000Z	ompaul	ulrik	there are many sub channels for ubuntu/kubuntu and so on
2006-01-24T17:28:00.000Z	ulrik	ompaul	why aren't they in the topic
2006-01-24T17:29:00.000Z	ompaul	ulrik	there is no space
2006-01-24T17:29:00.000Z	ulrik	ompaul	these 600 people need to know where to go
2006-01-24T17:31:00.000Z	ompaul	ulrik	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InternetRelayChat

2006-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	ulrik	ompaul	hmm, well this didn't really explain what's holding the latest fglrx out of the dapper archives, though.. ;)
2006-02-26T07:07:00.000Z	ompaul	ulrik	no it did not but it might get you somewhere if your stuck #ubuntu-motu might be a better place to try and get to grips with the dev aspect of it
2006-02-26T07:08:00.000Z	ompaul	ulrik	or have a look at dapper objectives or some such on the wiki
2006-02-26T07:08:00.000Z	ulrik	ompaul	might be an idea, yes.. :)
2006-02-26T07:08:00.000Z	ulrik	ompaul	is there a way to find out who's maintaining a certain package?
2006-02-26T07:09:00.000Z	ompaul	ulrik	 apt-cache show foo
