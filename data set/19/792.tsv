2011-09-17T23:57:00.000Z	annecy		Hi,  I updated from the flexiondotorg ppa and now I have a black screen after logging out
2011-09-17T23:58:00.000Z	annecy		The packages were for libglib2.0 and libc-bin.  The ppa is for Shotwell backport
2011-09-18T00:00:00.000Z	annecy		I can't think what else it could be.  There is a large x instead of a pointer
2011-09-18T00:00:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	can you move the X?
2011-09-18T00:01:00.000Z	annecy	alkafoo	yes
2011-09-18T00:02:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	that means X is working, but that you might not have a window manager configured properly to actually load
2011-09-18T00:03:00.000Z	annecy	alkafoo	i have compiled and openbox, but how do I start them?
2011-09-18T00:04:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	openbox?
2011-09-18T00:04:00.000Z	annecy	alkafoo	sorry I meant compiz instead of compiled
2011-09-18T00:05:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	are you using a login manager, like GDM?
2011-09-18T00:05:00.000Z	annecy	alkafoo	yes gdm
2011-09-18T00:05:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	there should be a button somewhere where you can change what window manager/desktop environment to use
2011-09-18T00:05:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	if not read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Openbox
2011-09-18T00:06:00.000Z	annecy	alkafoo	nope only black screen
2011-09-18T00:10:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	/etc/init.d/gdm restart maybe
2011-09-18T00:10:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	might need to sudo it
2011-09-18T00:15:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	isn't GNOME 2 what 10.04 comes with by default?
2011-09-18T00:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	what is this PPA you used and why
2011-09-18T00:22:00.000Z	alkafoo	annecy	what input method are you using?
