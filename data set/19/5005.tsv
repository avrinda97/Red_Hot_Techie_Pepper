2008-09-19T01:07:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		stephenF it gives me this
2008-09-19T01:07:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		md5sum: ubuntu-8.04.1-desktop-i386.iso: No such file or directory
2008-09-19T01:08:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		lobsang@lobsang-desktop:~$ md5sum ubuntu-8.04.1-desktop-i386.iso
2008-09-19T01:09:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	you must go to the directory where you downloaded your iso to
2008-09-19T01:12:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	try it step by step: where did you download your iso to?
2008-09-19T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	I'd rather do it in the channel
2008-09-19T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	please write my nick, when you talk to me, its easier for me to see your response, use gun and then <TAB>
2008-09-19T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	now please type "ls -l ubuntu*"
2008-09-19T01:18:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	so you are in the wrong directory, no need for sudo in this case; please type "cd ~/Desktop"
2008-09-19T01:19:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	please write my nick, when you talk to me, its easier for me to see your response, use gun and then <TAB>
2008-09-19T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	ok that didn't work :(, so please type my nick, or else I might overlook your response :)
2008-09-19T01:21:00.000Z	ubuntutlups	guntbert	is the right one ? how do i check is the one
2008-09-19T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	now you look on the ubuntu-website and compare the checksum to that of your file
2008-09-19T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	did you see: the checksum for you file seems to be different from that on the page - so your file is damaged, download it again and check it BEFORE burning
2008-09-19T01:34:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	there is a torrent for the standard image too, just found it
2008-09-19T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	sorry, that was a mistake
2008-09-19T01:42:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	you can install from the desktop CD or from the alternate CD, but with the Desktop CD you can have a running ubuntu, even without installation - thats called "live CD"
2008-09-19T01:43:00.000Z	ubuntutlups	guntbert	so after i donwload this ill get a updatE ?
2008-09-19T01:44:00.000Z	guntbert	ubuntutlups	both CDs will give you the option to do a fresh install
