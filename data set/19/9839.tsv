2007-03-09T08:54:00.000Z	tehquickness		it would be like /music/artist/song   ---->>    /music/song
2007-03-09T08:54:00.000Z	tehquickness		hmm cose
2007-03-09T08:54:00.000Z	tehquickness		it is breaking the songs up because of the spaces in the names
2007-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	tehquickness		stupid song names
2007-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	tehquickness		yeah
2007-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	tehquickness		this is a tough one
2007-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	tehquickness		I have gotten close
2007-03-09T08:56:00.000Z	tehquickness		I will be amazed once we solve this.
2007-03-09T08:57:00.000Z	tehquickness		I have been trying the file manager but there are alot and so it would take a long time to click in and out of all the files
2007-03-09T08:57:00.000Z	tehquickness		It is like 300 is mp3s, and 40 or 50 folders
2007-03-09T08:58:00.000Z	rbil	tehquickness	what are u trying to do?
2007-03-09T09:00:00.000Z	tehquickness		Simply put, I have /music/artist/song and i am trying to get it to /music/songs
2007-03-09T09:02:00.000Z	tehquickness	kelsin	this giving things like this basename: extra operand `Massacre'
2007-03-09T09:02:00.000Z	tehquickness		Try `basename --help' for more information.
2007-03-09T09:02:00.000Z	tehquickness		cp "50 Cent/The Massacre (Edited)" ""
2007-03-09T09:02:00.000Z	tehquickness		basename: extra operand `Advisory)'
2007-03-09T09:02:00.000Z	tehquickness		Try `basename --help' for more information.
2007-03-09T09:03:00.000Z	tehquickness		I think I am just going to break down and do it by hand with the gui
2007-03-09T09:04:00.000Z	rbil	tehquickness	you could probably just do a search in Nautilus for the mp3s and it'll display them all. Then highlight them all and drag them to where u want them :-)
