2011-01-08T21:54:00.000Z	joentjuh		Okay, I may have a very simple problem but am not sure how to get rid of it (tried google but no success). I've just created an USB boot disk via the 'Startup Disk Creator' (with success) but am now stuck with an "729 MB File: Ubuntu 10.10 amd64" entry in both Disk Utility and Nautilus that I just can't seem to get rid of...(it _really_ annoys me) Any ideas?
2011-01-08T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2011-01-08T21:55:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	nope, I've had that image for a while now and used it before (burned to cd, not usb)
2011-01-08T21:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	I'd check it just to be sure, if you cant transfer the image you may want to fsck the usb storage too
2011-01-08T21:58:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	There's nothing wrong with the actual image, and the USB disk has been successfully created and is already removed from my system. It's just an annoying entry in Disk Utility telling me it knows of an image (but is not mounted) that points to /dev/loop0
2011-01-08T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	could try unetbootin then
2011-01-08T22:00:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	Not sure what you mean...?... The USB disk is already created
2011-01-08T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	boot to the USB and check it for consistency
2011-01-08T22:04:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	Does it matter if it is, or if it's not? I just want the entry pointing to /dev/loop0 gone from nautilus/disk utility...
2011-01-08T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	well yes, if the USB isn't consistent then the data is bad
2011-01-08T22:08:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	But again, what does this have to do with anything? Even if the iso were completely corrupt and the usb disk were to crash... I still want the pointless entry gone. The only thing 'Disk Utility' tells me is that it's a unmounted loop device named ubuntu-10.10-desktop-amd64 of type IS09660... Surely there must be some way to (forcebly) remove this.
2011-01-08T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	you may be able to use:  sudo umount -f /media/loop0    (or whatever the mountpoint is)
2011-01-08T22:15:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	As I've said before, it's not mounted and has no 'remove' action... Hence my predicament
2011-01-08T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	yes but you can use the -f (force) option in umount and it will remove it, will that not sort it
2011-01-08T22:18:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	'umount: /dev/loop0: not mounted'... Can't find any mount location either.
2011-01-08T22:24:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	This is what I'm talking about: http://thuis.joentjuh.nl/dump/screenshot8.png & http://thuis.joentjuh.nl/dump/screenshot9.png
2011-01-08T22:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	not sure then dude
2011-01-08T22:26:00.000Z	joentjuh	ActionParsnip	Bummer, thanks anyway
2011-01-08T22:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	joentjuh	others may be able to help though
