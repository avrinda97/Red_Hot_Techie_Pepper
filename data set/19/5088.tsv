2008-09-05T02:13:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic		hey, could someone help me out with this. i was here yesterday and tried what was suggested and no go. im trying to upgrade to ubuntu 8.04 from 7.10 and 2 pkgs wont download
2008-09-05T02:14:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	which two?
2008-09-05T02:16:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	1 minute its coming up
2008-09-05T02:18:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	alright
2008-09-05T02:20:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	would you know where the pkgs get downloaded to when upgrading?
2008-09-05T02:21:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	packages are downloaded to /var/cache/apt/archives/ but that isn't relelvant, you shouldn't need to do any manual package...stuff.
2008-09-05T02:22:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	yea i know but maybe thinking i can download those from somewhere else and put them there. cause the servers wont let me download them.
2008-09-05T02:23:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	What are the errors you get?
2008-09-05T02:23:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	i dont get errors, it hangs on those 2 packages. and downloading stops. i then cancel and it tells me they couldnt be fetched. i've left it on half the night and they didnt download. together they are like 700kb only
2008-09-05T02:24:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	Which packages? and do you have any third party repos enabled?
2008-09-05T02:25:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	yea under software sources i got 3rd party software both boxes checked
2008-09-05T02:26:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	alright, it's possible that those are the causes of this issue. Uncheck them and see if that helps.
2008-09-05T02:27:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	ok i'll try it now. im using the ca.ubuntu server
2008-09-05T02:33:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	hmm seems to have stopped again with 1165 of 1167 pkgs downloaded :-/
2008-09-05T02:33:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	i can cancel and tell you what they are
2008-09-05T02:35:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	those are the 2
2008-09-05T02:37:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	sure, you could try downloading them manually.
2008-09-05T02:37:00.000Z	k3rnelpanic	Flannel	when i go and try and download it from firefox, it doesnt download either with that address but says its there
2008-09-05T02:38:00.000Z	Flannel	k3rnelpanic	Try changing your mirror, from ca, although I can download them fine.  In your browser, take that URL and remove the ca. from it (so http://archive.ubuntu.com....)
