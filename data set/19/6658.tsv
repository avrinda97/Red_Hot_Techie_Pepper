2008-01-20T00:14:00.000Z	bkar		zenobius-> you just have to modify the /boot/grub/menu.lst and order the entries per your desires.. default off course can be set to any in the entries
2008-01-20T00:15:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	yeah i'd like the new kernels to be automatically put at the bottom instead of the top
2008-01-20T00:16:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	i was running a intro group to webdev, in a shared room...i was allowed to put ubuntu as dual boot, but i ended up having to come in on my days off to change the grub menu
2008-01-20T00:33:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	: so i ahve to either do no updates or come in on my day off?
2008-01-20T00:35:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	: updates arent a once off thing.
2008-01-20T00:35:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	meaning i will have to continually update that file after each upgrade
2008-01-20T00:36:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	: not possible to change the behavior to put the new ones last?
2008-01-20T00:36:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	: guest his is the wrong palce to ask
2008-01-20T00:38:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	picture this: a room with 15 computers....all dual boot. after kernel upgrades (which is proly each week) i would have to manually edit each file on each computer. not fun
2008-01-20T00:39:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	so i have to creat a sed script?
2008-01-20T00:41:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	what is handling the changes to the menu.lst file upon kernel upgrades?
2008-01-20T00:45:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	well when you update the kernel. it puts the new kernel at the top, so if i specified the grub to auto boot the entry for windows which might be no 6, after an upgrade it will be no 7 thus auto boot no 6 wont work
2008-01-20T00:46:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	btw i ve tried useing savedefault option, but it does not work
2008-01-20T00:46:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	i dont think you understand nor appreciate what im trying to do...thanks
2008-01-20T00:50:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	it not me who changes grub when you do a sudo apt-get update.
2008-01-20T00:50:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	sorry upgrade
2008-01-20T00:56:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	/usr/sbin/grub-update ... editing that will take some time i think
2008-01-20T01:10:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	no i am not
2008-01-20T01:11:00.000Z	zenobius	bkar	wish i could find an emplyer that doesnt keep trying to find the cheapest way out
