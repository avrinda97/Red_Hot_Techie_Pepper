2007-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	ZeroZiat		Hello my people!
2007-04-25T06:26:00.000Z	ZeroZiat		Got a set of questions.
2007-04-25T06:27:00.000Z	ZeroZiat		Uhh, when someone of you is available, I'll need help, but take your time, just beep me.
2007-04-25T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	just ask your question to the channel
2007-04-25T06:28:00.000Z	ZeroZiat	jrib	I don't want to bother these other busy men with some worthless lines, that's why I am waiting. :)
2007-04-25T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	no one will ever say, "ZeroZiat go ahead I'm read to help" because no one has any idea if the *can* help you without knowing the problem
2007-05-15T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	you create it in your HOME if it does not already exist
2007-05-15T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	but... what are you actually trying to do?
2007-05-15T06:46:00.000Z	ZeroZiat	jrib	I installed a program's Linux version that required me to add a line to it.
2011-03-02T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	that option exists in the installer, just choose it
2011-03-02T19:59:00.000Z	ZeroZiat	jrib	My problem is, installing alongside other OS I'm not sure what it wants to do, considering it wants to resize my windows partition.
2011-03-02T19:59:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	there's an option in the installer to just use unallocated space
2011-03-02T20:00:00.000Z	ZeroZiat	jrib	They removed it.
2011-03-02T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	well that's silly.
2011-03-02T20:04:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	so "install side by side" tells you it wants to resize windows?
2011-03-02T20:04:00.000Z	ZeroZiat	jrib	Yeah, I read you have to use the manual partition thing now.
2011-03-02T20:05:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	k, I would just do that then
2011-03-02T20:06:00.000Z	ZeroZiat	jrib	That's where the plot thickens, I've got no idea how to partition this.
2011-03-02T20:06:00.000Z	jrib	ZeroZiat	just create a swap and a / (ext4) in the free space.  If you want a separate /home, you can do that too
