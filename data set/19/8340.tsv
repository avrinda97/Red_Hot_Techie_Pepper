2007-04-10T10:28:00.000Z	Nubbie		th3infinit30n3: well is it an open source program?
2007-04-10T10:29:00.000Z	Nubbie		th3infinit30n3: then its safe to assume it will never work in linux, no?
2007-04-10T10:30:00.000Z	Nubbie		th3infini30n3: i know for a fact team speak works with linux though.
2007-04-10T10:30:00.000Z	Nubbie		Kevin____: do you use raid or LVM?
2007-04-10T10:31:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	no raid, whats LVM
2007-04-10T10:31:00.000Z	Nubbie	Kevin_____	its like extended partitions in the NTFS world.
2007-04-10T10:32:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	 i dont think so
2007-04-10T10:32:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	 i pretty much have a default ubuntu install
2007-04-10T10:33:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	im migrating to a partitio on a fresh vista install
2007-04-10T10:36:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	so If im installing vista, i should create 4 partitions? vista will be on the first and what should the order of the rest be?
2007-04-10T10:37:00.000Z	Nubbie	Kevin_____	yeah, and install windows first, because it likes to wipe out your grub boot manager, pretty much nuking linux.
2007-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	how big should i make the 3 partitions? I have 250 gb to use
2007-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	Nubbie	Kevin_____	how much do you plan on using it? / partition only needs to be around 6GB, swap should be equal you your RAM, and /home should be as much as you want left for storage.
2007-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	i want to use the whole 250 gb its a 500gb
2007-04-10T10:48:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	 i get it now:) is there any particular order i need to put them in?
2007-04-10T10:50:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	awesome, thats exactly what i wanted to know
2007-04-10T10:51:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	 i only have igb ram now, but will be getting more down the road, would it hurt to start off with 2gb swap?
2007-04-10T11:00:00.000Z	Kevin_____	Nubbie	jtholmes, I will eventually add the ram, i just dont want problems when i do so, im not so much worried about wasting the space, as I am doing the wrong thing at this point
