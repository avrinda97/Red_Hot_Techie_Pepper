2010-02-13T15:45:00.000Z	Pure		Hey
2010-02-13T15:46:00.000Z	Pure		Does server take less space than client?
2010-02-13T15:46:00.000Z	Pure		I don't think I'll need to install client
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	Pure		I'm planning on SSHing to it only
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	what server/what client
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	either can be as big/little as you make them
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	ok - the desktop and the server installs can be made as big or as little as you want
2010-02-13T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	you can put/remove as many packages as you want
2010-02-13T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	they are based on the same core OS, so you can put as much or as little on either asyou want
2010-02-13T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	just remove the desktop from the desktop install and it will be fine
2010-02-13T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	on differnt hardware yes
2010-02-13T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	if you are using home user kit - use the desktop
2010-02-13T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	my personal opion of wubi is very poor, that said other users find it a useful way to test using ubuntu
2010-02-13T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	alterntive is the smaller
2010-02-13T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	less pretty interface to install from though
2010-02-13T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	too long
2010-02-13T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	you may want to consider going to a public internet place, library/cafe/university etc
2010-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	they will change depending on what's online - they normally are active
2011-08-18T12:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Pure	it's not really a good usable solution though
