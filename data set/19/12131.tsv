2006-03-15T16:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		I know there's a command to blank the screen; what is it?
2006-03-15T16:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Okay, I'm having some issues with irssi, back in a flash for anyone about to answer my question...
2006-03-15T16:17:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	in X or console?
2006-03-15T16:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	Either.
2006-03-15T16:18:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	in a real console try setvesablank on
2006-03-15T16:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	Anything special to bring it back afterwards?
2006-03-15T16:19:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	setvesablank off :)
2006-03-15T16:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	setvesablank on didn't do anything...
2006-03-15T16:20:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	in X, xlock blank should do it
2006-03-15T16:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	My suspend script uses 'vbetool dpms off' to do it.  I discovered that 'vbetool dpms on' is a bad idea though.
2006-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	Although that's exactly what's in resume.sh
2006-03-15T16:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	Done manually on its own I got a screen that just cycled through colors and I had to hit the power button.
2006-04-18T12:10:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	your logins should be logged to /var/log/auth.log.  commands you run should go to .bash_history, but it only gets written when you exit the shell.
2006-04-18T12:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	Ah, that'll be it.  Not written until exit.  Got it.
2006-04-18T12:13:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	you won't notice a thing
2006-04-18T12:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	arrick: Sweet.  /me has another tinkering project for the summer then.
2006-04-18T12:14:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	even less if you use lighttpd instead of apache
2006-04-18T12:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	trappist	LostFrog, arrick: What's the difference, and how would I decide what I need?
2006-04-18T12:15:00.000Z	trappist	tonyyarusso	different lists of features.  if I were you I'd just go with apache, since there's no shortage of docs for it.
