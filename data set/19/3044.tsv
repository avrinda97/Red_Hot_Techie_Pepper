2009-11-04T08:33:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	 pleae could you answer? i want to know how to compile it, it's my first time compiling a os
2009-11-04T08:33:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	should i run make? or gcc? with any flagÂ¿ gcc -a or gcc-bclksjdlfkjs i duno please illustrate me
2009-11-04T08:36:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	hmm wow that's an interesting plan
2009-11-04T08:38:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	you realize that would probably take you like 2 weeks to compile?
2009-11-04T08:38:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	really?
2009-11-04T08:38:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	lool haha
2009-11-04T08:39:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	so karmic koala has been 2 weeks compiling before its release Grelmy ?
2009-11-04T08:40:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	Ah but I think they have more than 1 computer working on it.
2009-11-04T08:40:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	heh i can have 4 laptops for one morning, how would it take then?
2009-11-04T08:40:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	all of thema re core 2 duo with at least 1 gig, some of them 4 gigs
2009-11-04T08:41:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	If you want to compile your whole linux distribution, try Gentoo Linux... that's what it's for...
2009-11-04T08:41:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	but i heard to compile gentoo it's way too hard, there are 6 stages i think, and you have to run commands in between them
2009-11-04T08:42:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	i just  know to run 'make' or 'gcc makefile'
2009-11-04T08:43:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	however difficult Gentoo is to compile, Ubuntu is probably harder... since Gentoo is meant to be comiled, and the package manager does it for you... while Ubuntu was designed to be compiled by the porgrammers
2009-11-04T08:46:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	I think you would find this recent article interesting. They compared ubuntu with gentoo, and tried 3 different compiler settings on gentoo, and then tested how fast the programs were: http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7574/1/
2009-11-04T08:47:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	but did they compare a downloaded iso with a source compiled one?
2009-11-04T08:47:00.000Z	obiwan_	Grelmy	i'm not interested in gentoo vs ubuntu, but main release vs self compiled release
2009-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	Grelmy	obiwan_	in a way, yes, since the ubuntu was downloaded, and the gentoo was source compiled. But there was no scientific control really
