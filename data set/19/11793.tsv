2006-10-01T10:45:00.000Z	maquis		where did the option for a server install disappear to?
2006-10-01T10:46:00.000Z	maquis		i don't like >90% of the stuff ubuntu installs by default, but i really want to give ubuntu a fair try at least
2006-10-01T10:46:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	which stuff you don't like ? gnome ?
2006-10-01T10:47:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	gnome, openoffice, pretty much all the X-based software
2006-10-01T10:47:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	i don't know how to tell ya but ... you can install ubuntu as server ?
2006-10-01T10:47:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	is there still an option for a server install that only does the basics?
2006-10-01T10:47:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	i know the previous versions gave 2 options for installs...
2006-10-01T10:48:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	why not ? i been moving around fedora ... suse .. debian and ubuntu all the time
2006-10-01T10:50:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	i want something i can get up quickly
2006-10-01T10:50:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	and i really wanted to actually give ubuntu a chance
2006-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	try fedora ... minimum install and i showd ya the server install links .. if you still want the server
2006-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	i've tried fedora before...
2006-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	may i ask what you are looking for ??
2006-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	i'm looking for something that will get me up quickly, but won't install the stuff i don't want
2006-10-01T10:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	gentoo
2006-10-01T10:53:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	i said i wanted to be up quickly
2006-10-01T10:54:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	i think if you spend the time talking to us here on installing any of the distros you will find what you want
2006-10-01T10:54:00.000Z	maquis	wickedpuppy	i've tried a lot of distros
2006-10-01T10:55:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	maquis	you don't like them all ? then there is always windows
