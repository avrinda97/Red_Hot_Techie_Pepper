2010-09-08T00:31:00.000Z	xcyclist		I have a new laptop install with 10.10, and am looking at recommendations.  First:  IRC client?
2010-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	Konverastion :)
2010-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	that's Konversation
2010-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	xcyclist	sebsebseb	 Yes, well, I can go there, but it's just applications, nothing specific to 10.10 I am insterested in.
2010-09-08T00:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	yeah Konversation is  quite a lot better than Xchat :)
2010-09-08T00:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	well Empathy is the default in 10.04 and 10.10 for im
2010-09-08T00:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	however both programs are nice
2010-09-08T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	oh yeah Empathy was default in 9.10 as well
2010-09-08T00:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	persoanlly I prefer Friefox :)
2010-09-08T00:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	 Firefox :)
2010-09-08T00:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	Chrome and Chromeium have a user interface that remind me of Internet Explorer 7,  so yeah I don't like, the rendering enginge Webkit for loading up pages that they use is nice though, but  quite a few browsers that use that, just like quite a few use  the Mozilla Gecko renering enginge that are good
2010-09-08T00:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	Firefox is my primary browser, then I would use  stuff such as Konqueror  or Galeon or Empathy or even Arora
2010-09-08T00:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	uh that was meant to be  Epiphany above
2010-09-08T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	actsaully I am using an older version of Chromeium here and there recently, but  not that keen on it.
2010-09-08T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	Chrome has built in Flash, and is closed source,  Chromeium doesn't have built in Flash and is open source.  Chrome is based on Chromium, and so they are both quite similar to each other.  I think that answers your question
2010-09-08T00:46:00.000Z	xcyclist	sebsebseb	 Wow, nothing I do will get empathy to take my facebook credentials.
2010-09-08T00:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	theres a Plugin for Pidgin that you can try for that
2010-09-08T00:47:00.000Z	xcyclist	sebsebseb	 But empathy is TRYING to set me up and ALWAYS fails.  Pretty poor testimony.
2010-09-08T00:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xcyclist	yeah go to #ubuntu+1 for 10.10 issues
