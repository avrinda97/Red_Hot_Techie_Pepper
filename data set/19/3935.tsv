2009-06-19T19:43:00.000Z	tntc		man, it's pretty awesome that I didn't have to install anything to see those korean charachters.
2009-06-19T19:43:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	agreed.
2009-06-19T19:45:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	I think that would be an alsa bug.
2009-06-19T19:45:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	(request for improvement bug, that is)
2009-06-19T19:46:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	have you tried rebuilding the alsa modules first? I have an intel hda card, (which is a realtec chipset), and rebuilding the alsa modules using module-assistant fixed my issues.
2009-06-19T19:47:00.000Z	tntc	eurythmia	rebuilding them? got a doc on how to do that?  I built the modules by hand using the actual alsa sources (first) and then realtek's sources (second)
2009-06-19T19:48:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	hold on, I should be able to find a doc, it's pretty easy though :)
2009-06-19T19:48:00.000Z	tntc	eurythmia	heh. I'm not too worried.  I can make complicated things work too.
2009-06-19T19:49:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	use "Method A" from here : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Gutsy_Intel_HD_Audio_Controller
2009-06-19T19:49:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	so, you're like me then ... like the easy way, but the complicated stuff works too :)
2009-06-19T19:50:00.000Z	tntc	eurythmia	hehe. I actually already did method B.  If method B didn't work, doesn't that mean Method A won't as well?
2009-06-19T19:50:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	you should be able to get away with running "sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart" instead of "shutdown -r now"
2009-06-19T19:50:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	not necessarily.
2009-06-19T19:51:00.000Z	tntc	eurythmia	I'd just been doing sudo alsa force-reload.
2009-06-19T19:52:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	might have the same effect, I'm not 100% sure ... I think you'll have to unload/reload the alsa modules for everything to take effect (so, restarting is prolly easier)
2009-06-19T19:53:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	cool. I'll be around :)
2009-06-19T21:47:00.000Z	tntc	eurythmia	didn't work. I got no sound at all, and it only detected an OSS device.  I'm gonna stick with the realtek drivers.
2009-06-19T21:50:00.000Z	eurythmia	tntc	sorry it didn't work, thanks for sharing your experience though :)
2009-06-19T21:51:00.000Z	tntc	eurythmia	hehe. always happy to help
