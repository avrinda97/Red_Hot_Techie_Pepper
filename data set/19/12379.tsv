2006-06-13T11:38:00.000Z	Dirge		Am I supposed to go into terminal and use su in order to save a file I was editing in a GUI?
2006-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	Dirge		It will never allow me to save or edit files. The OS keeps altering the files into root access only.
2006-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	Dirge		And external HDD is root only as well.
2006-06-13T11:40:00.000Z	Dirge		So I can't transfer to or edit anything there.
2006-06-13T11:40:00.000Z	Dirge		NTFS
2006-06-13T11:40:00.000Z	Dirge		VLC
2006-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	Dirge		It'll write, but I need to go into terminal and su then copy.
2006-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	Dirge		Why can't the GUI have root access?
2006-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	Dirge		That's a temp fix.

2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	we haven't reverse engineered safe writing, so there are things that'll let you write to ntfs, but can't guarentee they wont hose the partition.
2006-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	right, that's by design
2006-06-13T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	no, it asks for YOUR sudo password
2006-06-13T11:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	Dirge what's the issue? just add them to the admin group.
2006-06-13T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	running as root is the stupidest thing you can do
2006-06-13T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	or, run one instance of a gksudod nautilus
2006-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	and then don't accidentally hit 'delete'
2006-06-13T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	you're enabling them? you don't need to go to settings, they're already visible
2006-06-13T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Dirge	you don't need to go to settings, they're already visible, skip down to the enabling/editing universe to includemultiverse
