2006-07-25T08:59:00.000Z	srikat		hello
2006-07-25T08:59:00.000Z	srikat		does ubuntu installer ask for GRUB location? if so, is it C: drive?
2006-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	sadly the graphical installer doesnt ask for a location for the grub
2006-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	and fyi: c: is no partition
2006-07-25T09:02:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	you dont see mbr on any partition tool. theres only one mbr on disk, and its in the first cylinder of the whole disk
2006-07-25T09:02:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	and your mbr is on the disk you said to be used as boot device in bios
2006-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	wh, *the windows boot loader
2006-07-25T09:05:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	i dont really know where the graphical installer install grub... on the disk you installed ubuntu, or on the first disk(master) on ide1,...
2006-07-27T05:38:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	install ubuntu as last, it should find all the other osses and make a boot option for them
2006-07-27T05:38:00.000Z	srikat	oskude	can I point it to the same swap as that of Mepis?
2006-07-27T05:38:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	yes, i do that all the time
2006-07-27T05:39:00.000Z	srikat	oskude	does the same apply to /home as well? Can Mepis and Ubuntu share the same /home?
2006-07-27T05:39:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	i wouldnt do that
2006-07-27T05:40:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	as some programs save their settings in /home, and if they dont have the same versions of that prog, you may get trouble
2006-07-27T05:40:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	but of course, technically, its of course doable
2006-07-27T05:41:00.000Z	srikat	oskude	if I point the ubuntu installer to an unallocated space, it's going to write /, swap and /home over there?
2006-07-27T05:42:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	dunno, never did that automatic installation
2006-07-27T05:42:00.000Z	oskude	srikat	and in dualboot (or more) you cant use any automatic
2006-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	srikat	oskude	ty...off I go to install Ubuntu
