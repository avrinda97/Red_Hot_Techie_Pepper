2009-01-03T11:49:00.000Z	B|ackPanther		I have not tinkered with any setting since installing it but its simply gone.
2009-01-03T11:50:00.000Z	B|ackPanther		What would be the possible cause for loss of wireless  ?
2009-01-03T11:50:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	what does iwconfig show?
2009-01-03T11:52:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	are you going to run "iwconfig"?
2009-01-03T11:53:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	you said it was atheros? modprobe | grep ath
2009-01-03T11:55:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	raylu	, modprobe | grep ath does not give anyging except the options
2009-01-03T11:55:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	what options?
2009-01-03T12:03:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	oops, sorry. "lsmod | grep ath"
2009-01-03T12:07:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	have you run "lsmod | grep ath"?
2009-01-03T12:16:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	raylu	 lsmod | grep  ath gives http://paste.ubuntu.com/98824/
2009-01-03T12:17:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	that's strange. it's a long shot, but try "sudo ifup ath0"
2009-01-03T12:18:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	raylu	i get Ignoring unknown interface ath0=ath0.
2009-01-03T12:19:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	ifconfig -a
2009-01-03T12:21:00.000Z	B|ackPanther	raylu	output here : http://paste.ubuntu.com/98825/
2009-01-03T12:24:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	hm. some people are mentioning that ath_pci doesn't work for aspire atheros wifi...
2009-01-03T12:26:00.000Z	raylu	B|ackPanther	oh. try system> administration> hardware drivers
