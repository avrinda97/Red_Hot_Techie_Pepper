2011-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	dzeremis		Hello to all! I need help with installation of Windows in a system with two versions of Ubuntu. I can't WINE programs effectively. VirtualBox is acting pathetically. I have two ext4 partitions, one with Ubuntu 10.XX. I simply want to erase this and install Windows without destroying my current Ubuntu 11.XX partition, which I use for non-Windows tasks. What are my steps to make sure Windows Vista 7 doesn't overwrite everything and leave me with
2011-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	dzeremis		out a boot mechanism?
2011-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	dzeremis		I'm talking about partitions and the boot loader which gives you an option of which operating system(s) to choose?
2011-09-01T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	when you install, tell windows to format the current ntfs partition and install to it. You WILL need to reinstate grub2 to the MBR as windows will blindly overwrite it with its own
2011-09-01T07:11:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	and Polah: Thank you very much. That is exactly what I suspected. I do not use Windows habitually on its own partition. So, Windows, in its arrogance, WILL let me select which partition to install on, and all I need to do is reinstall GRUB?
2011-09-01T07:11:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	and Polah: speaking of which, what is the easiest way for me to reinstall grub2?
2011-09-01T07:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	use liveCD and you can chroot to install it
2011-09-01T07:13:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	That's a good idea. chroot --> what to get to that point? what to do? That's a great idea, as I'd have access to a Terminal.
2011-09-01T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	there are guides online
2011-09-01T07:14:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	Would you please direct me to one? I'm a little bit like a deer in the headlights right now, a temporary condition. I'm just making a plan so that after I install Windows, I'll know what to do.
2011-09-01T07:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	trust me, they are all over the place. Just search for: reinstall grub2 ubuntu live cd            and take your pick
2011-09-01T07:16:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	Okay. I will go look.
2011-09-01T07:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	no, windows is too primitive to access advanced linux filesystems
2011-09-01T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	you can use an ubuntu liveCD and access the files just fine
2011-09-01T07:40:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	I mean, right now, while I am in Ubuntu 11.XX, can I access my other partition, containing solely Ubuntu 10.XX? I haven't started installing Windows yet. I just wanted to copy files over without logging into Ubuntu 10.XX if necessary. Seems a waste of time.
2011-09-01T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	yes both can access ext4 so you can access it just fine :)
2011-09-01T07:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dzeremis	does nautilus just mount it for you automagically?
2011-09-01T07:53:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	I'm checking. Just a moment.
2011-09-01T07:54:00.000Z	dzeremis	ActionParsnip	all I see is UBUNTU and FILE SYSTEM. They appear to be the same thing. Nothing changes between them.
