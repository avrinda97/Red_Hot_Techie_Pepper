2011-01-19T21:15:00.000Z	afeijo		ok thanks TheTinyToon
2011-01-19T21:17:00.000Z	afeijo		yes TheTinyToon, I will try it with apache as well :)
2011-01-19T21:19:00.000Z	afeijo		yep
2011-01-19T21:20:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	might even work with .htaccess.
2011-01-19T21:13:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	you can't in named. But you can tell your webserver to redirect any www.-domains to the non-www domains.
2011-01-19T21:14:00.000Z	afeijo	TheTinyToon	you mean the apache settings? like httpd.conf or .htaccess?
2011-01-19T21:14:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	httpd.conf, via the rewrite-module
2011-01-19T21:15:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	you're welcome
2011-01-19T21:16:00.000Z	afeijo	TheTinyToon	A friend of mine said that I could do that thru CNAME?
2011-01-19T21:17:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	you can bind several domains to one ip through CNAMEs, but from what I understood, you wanted to force your visitors to acknowledge your real domains instead of the www-ones.
2011-01-19T21:17:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	If you just want to have several domains to one ip, you can do that through CNAMEs, so e.g. example.com and www.example.com both give back the ip 1.2.3.4
2011-01-19T21:18:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	it's just a question on what you want to achieve.
2011-01-19T21:18:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	the apache-solution will redirect http://www.example.com/foo/bar visitors to http://example.com/foo/bar
2011-01-19T21:18:00.000Z	afeijo	TheTinyToon	I have wildcards to subdomains, and my site works today with www and without it.  So google see my site thru 2 address!! That is not good
2011-01-19T21:19:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	then go for the apache-solution.
2011-01-19T21:19:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	an example-config would be here http://paste.ubuntu.com/555833/
2011-01-19T21:20:00.000Z	afeijo	TheTinyToon	that examploe wont harm my subdomains, will it?
2011-01-19T21:20:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	no, not unless you have other rewrites in place. It's limited to www.example.com
2011-01-19T21:21:00.000Z	TheTinyToon	afeijo	(that's what line 2 says)
