2005-12-25T07:44:00.000Z	Stormx2		(Nautilus)
2005-12-25T07:46:00.000Z	alamba	Stormx2	tried gftp? works wonders for me!
2005-12-25T07:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	Not the problem at all.
2005-12-25T07:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	The default action is nautilus. i tried gFTP, don't like it. Nautilus handles FTP directories fine. I can't figure out how to change the default action
2005-12-25T07:47:00.000Z	Stormx2		*the default action is firefox
2005-12-25T07:47:00.000Z	Stormx2		This happened after I set firefox as the default browser
2005-12-25T07:48:00.000Z	Stormx2		Heres an idea. What does everyone have in System > preferences > preferred applications
2005-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	alamba		Storm: hmm..interesting...when I open ssh using places to my server it opens it in nautilus...will just check ftp
2005-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	Stormx2		Come on. 2 clicks and it could help a lot
2005-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	Stormx2		:(
2005-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	yeah
2005-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	After i set firefox as the default browser
2005-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	it said it wasn't so I foolish clicked "set as default browser"
2005-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	alamba		storm: interesting...lets see if there's a way to reverse that
2005-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	I fixed it, thanks to someone in gnome
2005-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	I checked the gconf for ftp links
2005-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	alamba		storm: cool...how did u do it?
2005-12-25T07:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	alamba	in gconf, /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ftp
