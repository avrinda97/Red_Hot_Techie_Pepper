2010-04-19T21:59:00.000Z	synack303	sab	 why don't you re-install grub?
2010-04-19T22:00:00.000Z	synack303	sab	that normally fixes things! ;)
2010-04-19T22:00:00.000Z	sab	synack303	i tried from live cd but i got back only ubnutu on boot loader
2010-04-19T22:00:00.000Z	synack303	sab	once you have that then  from within ubuntu run "sudo update-grub"
2010-04-19T22:01:00.000Z	synack303	sab	that will repopulate the grub list and windows should be back
2010-04-19T22:02:00.000Z	synack303	sab	have you tried that? as that should fix your issue
2010-04-19T22:02:00.000Z	sab	synack303	no i didnt but today i will try
2010-04-19T22:02:00.000Z	synack303	sab	seriously that should be all you need to do

2010-04-19T22:08:00.000Z	synack303	sab	you might need to delete the lock file -- it might be at either /var/cache/apt/lock or /var/lib/dpkg/lock.
2010-04-19T22:10:00.000Z	synack303	sab	did update-grub work?
2010-04-19T22:10:00.000Z	sab	synack303	i didnt try yet
