2009-09-08T10:39:00.000Z	zenxr		try mplayer/gxine
2009-09-08T10:40:00.000Z	hajmola	zenxr	"Cannot find codec for audio format 0x162."
2009-09-08T10:40:00.000Z	zenxr		Grl: conky is win

2009-09-08T10:41:00.000Z	hajmola	zenxr	mplayer
2009-09-08T10:42:00.000Z	zenxr		gxine has always been my video player of choice.. 10 bucks says it works with gxine :D
2009-09-08T10:44:00.000Z	hajmola	zenxr	you owe me $10
2009-09-08T10:44:00.000Z	zenxr		Oh wow lol
2009-09-08T10:44:00.000Z	zenxr		*hands $10*
2009-09-08T10:44:00.000Z	hajmola	zenxr	file uses unsupported codec, Audio codec: Windows Media Audio v3 (0x16)
2009-09-08T10:45:00.000Z	zenxr		gXine usually installs windows codecs by default, which is why I assumed it worked..
2009-09-08T10:45:00.000Z	zenxr	hajmola	try installing the mplayer/totem windows codecs?
2009-09-08T10:46:00.000Z	hajmola	zenxr	yeah i might give that a try, thanks
2009-09-08T10:46:00.000Z	zenxr	hajmola	sorry I was no help lol
2009-09-08T10:46:00.000Z	hajmola	zenxr	it's all good
