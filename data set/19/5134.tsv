2008-08-26T00:05:00.000Z	mrpockets		tight
2008-08-26T00:05:00.000Z	mrpockets		next question: How hard would it be to make the password for an account one uses as guest to expire a day after using it?
2008-08-26T00:07:00.000Z	KaMaMi	mrpockets	you just have to calculate the days from 01.01.1970 :P
2008-08-26T00:07:00.000Z	KaMaMi		no joke
2008-08-26T00:07:00.000Z	mrpockets		oh?
2008-08-26T00:08:00.000Z	mrpockets		havent heard of either
2008-08-26T00:08:00.000Z	mrpockets		Ideally i'd like a list of passwords I put in, say  5, all that expire after using them
2008-08-26T00:09:00.000Z	mrpockets		so If i'm out of town or away and someone needs to use my machine, i can have them log onto a super restricted guest environment, and they can only do so once.
2008-08-26T00:09:00.000Z	mrpockets		well WTF MAN!
2008-08-26T00:09:00.000Z	KaMaMi	mrpockets	-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
2008-08-26T00:09:00.000Z	KaMaMi		    The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
2008-08-26T00:09:00.000Z	mrpockets		:-p
2008-08-26T00:10:00.000Z	KaMaMi		man useradd
2008-08-26T00:10:00.000Z	mrpockets	KaMaMi	yeah, but can it be set to a day after logging on the first time?
2008-08-26T00:10:00.000Z	mrpockets		like expire +1 day after logon,  instead of a specific date in time?
2008-08-26T00:11:00.000Z	KaMaMi	mrpockets	hmm i would use a script for that
2008-08-26T00:11:00.000Z	mrpockets		aight
2008-08-26T00:11:00.000Z	mrpockets		thanks guys, I'll look into that s'more
2008-08-26T00:11:00.000Z	KaMaMi	mrpockets	you can use the "last" command maybe for it
