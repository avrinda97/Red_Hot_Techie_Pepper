2005-11-06T14:55:00.000Z	n0odl3		does anyone know how configure a second pointer device?
2005-11-06T14:55:00.000Z	Revellion	n0odl3	yes?
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion	n0odl3	just add a inputdevice section
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion		and add the InputDevice to your ServerLayout
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	how would i do that?
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	can i swith between the two freely?
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion	n0odl3	except with an addition in the InputDevice being Option "SendCoreEvents" "true"
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion	n0odl3	yes
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion	n0odl3	if you use one of the pointers
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion		it controls it
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion		if you use the other
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion		it automagically gets control
2005-11-06T14:56:00.000Z	Revellion		and same in reverse
2005-11-06T14:57:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	See i have a pen and mouse tablet
2005-11-06T14:57:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	the mouse part works fine but for some reason the pen cant move the cursor
2005-11-06T14:58:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	Therefore i have formed a hypotheses by creating a second pointer device this may allow me to use the pen
2005-11-06T14:58:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	How would i got about adding  an input device to my layout
2005-11-06T14:58:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	What information would i need
2005-11-06T15:00:00.000Z	n0odl3	Revellion	how would i add an input device and what information would i need?
