2008-04-14T05:17:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	are youusing a bridge modem or a router/modem ? with two comps connecetd to it ?
2008-04-14T05:17:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	put my nick in the same line as the rest
2008-04-14T05:18:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	basicaly the command I gave you was for a bridge modem , ei one that only does the connecting and can only have one comp on it.
2008-04-14T05:18:00.000Z	ds_	Pelo	It's a centurytel modem with a USB output as well as an ether port...this comp is using Ether, his is connected to the USB
2008-04-14T05:19:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	ah,  not sure how that works, I think it's a bridge modem and you can'T realy have two comps on it at once,  even if therer are technicaly two connectors,  you'll need a router
2008-04-14T05:20:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	try looking up the modem's model in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org
2008-04-14T05:21:00.000Z	ds_	Pelo	it shoudl work...This comp is dual boot Kubuntu/XP, his was XP...it worked well when I was either and his was XP...so if my comp can work - How can he install USB drivers if he has the CD
2008-04-14T05:21:00.000Z	ds_	Pelo	I forgot how to 'run' a CD for it's drivers
2008-04-14T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	does his cd have drivers for linux on it ?
2008-04-14T05:22:00.000Z	ds_	Pelo	yes
2008-04-14T05:23:00.000Z	Pelo	ds_	put the cd in , copy the linux driver over to the desktop ,  see if there is a Read me file in it to tell you how to install
