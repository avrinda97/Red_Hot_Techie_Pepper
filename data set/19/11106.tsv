2008-02-15T01:33:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	that's what i use
2008-02-15T01:36:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	hrm.. any recommendations? i'm running gnome, and would prefer not to have to reload the panel and all that
2008-02-15T01:36:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	i honestly forget which other WMs i have. it's been so long since i've used them
2008-02-15T01:43:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	oroborus doesn't have a replace feature
2008-02-15T01:43:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	seems a lot of WMs don't
2008-02-15T01:52:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	i have icewm, but it'll replace the panels with it's own
2008-02-15T01:53:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	oh, wait. icewm-lite.. apparently has no taskbar.. i can try that :)
2008-02-15T01:57:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	no, icewm-lite is good
2008-02-15T01:57:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	i've switched from metacity to ice without prob, and ice to compiz without prob, now about to try compiz to metacity again
2008-02-15T01:59:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	hmm... switching to metacity this time didn't crash it
2008-02-15T02:00:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	maybe it's because i went from compiz, to metacity, to icewm, to compiz, to metacity, lol
2008-02-15T02:02:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	i seem to be having a lot of stability issues with epiphany though :/
2008-02-15T02:02:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	oh, everything makes sense... it's just a matter of whether we understand it or not :P
2008-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	it's become my main browser, over firefox even
2008-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	largely because it's fast and leightweight, and does several of the things i liked about firefox
2008-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	hrm, indeed
2008-02-15T02:13:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	sounds good. perhaps they ought to do that then
2008-02-15T02:18:00.000Z	tanath	solar_george	lol
