2006-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	said it all right ;)
2006-05-11T13:44:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	wow, that's easier than I imagined...
2006-05-11T13:44:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	assuming it works ;)
2006-05-11T14:03:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	would you mind having a look at Eduardo-'s prob? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13516
2006-05-12T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	:D
2006-05-12T08:19:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	makes you wonder whether the authors actually believe that stuff. Apparently, some people still do...
2006-05-12T08:20:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	if you were makeing a song, could you resist?
2006-05-12T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	no, but I would encode angelic, or at least ubuntuic messages :)
2006-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	visudo is the only safe way with sudo anywhere
2006-07-16T16:46:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	thanks. Did you take note, dbe?
2006-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	mind you, he's on Debian...
2006-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	ah, that makes a difference
2006-07-16T05:01:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	debatable. remote root logins should be disabled anyway. And if you have physical access, you have everything
2006-07-16T05:02:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	enumeration attacks aren't hard
2006-07-16T05:03:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	it's just another barrier that will lock out some black hats, but not others.
2006-07-16T05:04:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	can you elaborate on the kernel boot args?
2006-07-16T05:05:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	init=/bin/sh
2006-07-16T05:05:00.000Z	soundray	bbrazil	I think I'd use the grub password feature to guard against unauthorized console users starting up in recovery mode
2006-07-16T05:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	soundray	and that's what a boot cd is for
