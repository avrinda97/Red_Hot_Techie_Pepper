2006-06-12T05:01:00.000Z	nny		ok so i have chrooted into my root dir mounted in /mnt/ but grub barfs for no reason (one harddisk laptop)
2006-06-12T05:02:00.000Z	nny		and when i reboot i still get win boot loader
2006-06-12T05:02:00.000Z	Warbo	nny	Doing grub-install? Try doing this before you chroot "sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev"
2006-06-12T05:03:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	sounds exaclty like the problem will try thx
2006-06-12T05:04:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	it used /boot/grub/device map... whats the juju to tell grub install to use the menu.lst file?
2006-06-12T05:04:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	er device.map
2006-06-12T05:05:00.000Z	Warbo	nny	Not that sure (and here I m writing guides to GRUB. Shame on me :))
2006-06-12T05:05:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	heh np... i'll just cp menu.lst to device.map for now
2006-06-12T05:05:00.000Z	Warbo	nny	Er... That doesn't sound right to me?
2006-06-12T05:06:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	yeah i broke it
2006-06-12T05:08:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	interestinbg

2006-06-12T05:09:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	just did a vista beta install (hey it beats using a hacked copy of pro) and vista doesn't install to mbr
2006-06-12T05:09:00.000Z	Warbo	nny	I've heard that when Vista is released it will need encryption in the boot process or something (for "security" reasons) which is a bad thing for dual-boot
2006-06-12T05:10:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	heh i hope they make a beta crack before then
2006-06-12T05:16:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	worked fine btw, misunderstood what grub wanted with device.map btw
2006-06-12T05:16:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	hmm... yeah it seems Vista Beta 2 installs bootloader to part hda1
2006-06-12T05:17:00.000Z	nny	Warbo	if they decide to go with some drm based encryption BS they can keep their damn koolaid
2006-06-12T05:17:00.000Z	Warbo	nny	You can install GRUB to a partition too. Vista beta probably does that to let you still access XP
