2010-04-12T22:21:00.000Z	d4rkn3ss	crucialhoax	i am using firefox %u (i click the icon^^) .... but when i rename the .mozilla-folder it works
2010-04-12T22:21:00.000Z	crucialhoax	d4rkn3ss	So what is the problem
2010-04-12T22:22:00.000Z	d4rkn3ss	crucialhoax	the problem is that i don't wanna install all the plugins, bookmarks, add-ons and passwords again.....
2010-04-12T22:24:00.000Z	crucialhoax	d4rkn3ss	If you backed it all up just restore it. Other than that you will have to install plugins / add-ons.
2010-04-12T22:24:00.000Z	d4rkn3ss	crucialhoax	can i also backup the plugins/passwords?
2010-04-12T22:25:00.000Z	d4rkn3ss	crucialhoax	cause i played a long time that flash works and i don't wanna do this again^^
