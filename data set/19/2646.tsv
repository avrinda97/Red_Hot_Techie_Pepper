2010-11-07T02:08:00.000Z	dht123		hey,,, I can't upgrade from lucid to maverick :( I'm not very good at ubuntu and I have not much computer skill. please help me fix this :(
2010-11-07T02:09:00.000Z	dht123		it says I have maverick but it still has the lucid software...
2010-11-07T02:09:00.000Z	dht123		none of the new maverick stuff
2010-11-07T02:09:00.000Z	dht123		sudo do-release-upgrade says no new update found
2010-11-07T02:10:00.000Z	dht123		how do I check that
2010-11-07T02:11:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	what software precisely?
2010-11-07T02:13:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	apt-get update && apt-get upgrade <-- first thing to do, but before check your repositories
2010-11-07T02:14:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	sudo...
2010-11-07T02:16:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	close all other apt, dpkg. soft center, or synaptic
2010-11-07T02:16:00.000Z	dht123	shcherbak	theres nothing else open except for firefox terminal and xchat
2010-11-07T02:18:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	you can remove lock manually or reboot (syslog have info of any broken installation)
2010-11-07T02:20:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	it is graphic driver, i recommend to: sudo killall dpkg and run Additional Hardware from menu
2010-11-07T02:21:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	it is not, just sometimes troublesome...
2010-11-07T02:22:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	uninstal them, and install agian
2010-11-07T02:22:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	or just reboot
2010-11-07T02:22:00.000Z	dht123	shcherbak	how?
2010-11-07T02:24:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	with the very same manager - Additional Hardware - there is option to remove driver
2010-11-07T02:24:00.000Z	dht123	shcherbak	no there isn't... thers no drivers listed under additional drivers
2010-11-07T02:24:00.000Z	shcherbak	dht123	yep, reboot
