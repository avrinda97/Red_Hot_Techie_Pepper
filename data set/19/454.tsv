2012-07-03T19:40:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline		Hi all. I'm currently running Mac OS X 10.6 and I want to switch to Ubuntu 12.04 as my primary OS. However, I'm going to keep OS X on another partition for when I need to sync some of my iOS devices (iPad 3 and iPod 4, which aren't compatible with libimobiledevice). I have a 1.5TB external hard drive that I need to be able to read and write to from both Mac and Ubuntu, so I'm wondering what filesystem to use. I'd rather not use FAT32 because of th
2012-07-03T19:40:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline		 limitations. What would you guys suggest?
2012-07-03T19:41:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	Shrink your MAC partition MacOSX has to tools for that and then install Ubuntu beside
2012-07-03T19:42:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	yes but I need read/write support on the external HD. What filesystem should I use for the external hard disk so I can read and write to it from both OSs?
2012-07-03T19:43:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	As far as I know osx uses hfs+ which should be at least readable under ubuntu
2012-07-03T19:44:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	I know but I need writable lol. =P Would HFS without journaling work?
2012-07-03T19:45:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	Apparently it works readwrite as well. sometimes disks are readonly because they where not unmounted correctly a fsck.hfsplus /dev/yourdisk you correct that

2012-07-03T19:47:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	is that new in 12.04? Because I always remember having to install packages like hfsprogs
2012-07-03T19:47:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	of course you need the hfsplus progs :)
2012-07-03T19:47:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline		lol =P
2012-07-03T19:48:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	so I just sudo apt-get install hfsprogs and then it should work as a plug and play drive like in OS X?
2012-07-03T19:49:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	I just need something that I can get up and running quickly so everything works in my work environment.
2012-07-03T19:49:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	I think so but haven't tried it
2012-07-03T19:50:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	ok. I have it partitioned as exFAT right now and I remember that it was only read only, soâ€¦ Well, I guess I'll give HFS+ a shot. Thanks!
2012-07-03T19:51:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	Good luck
2012-07-03T19:51:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	thanks. I might need it. =P
2012-07-03T19:52:00.000Z	schnuffle2	TorpedoSkyline	Can't you try if it works with a formatted USB stick?
2012-07-03T19:53:00.000Z	TorpedoSkyline	schnuffle2	I probably will but I haven't downloaded Ubuntu yet. I'm on a low-bandwidth connection so I'm going to have to go to the library to download it. XD
