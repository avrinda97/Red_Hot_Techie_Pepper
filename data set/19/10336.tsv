2008-01-18T01:48:00.000Z	QuickGold	Blaenk	- read the topic
2008-01-18T01:49:00.000Z	QuickGold		Bakkar: What kind of web pages are you going to be serving? And how many users will hit the server at anytime?
2008-01-18T01:50:00.000Z	BaKKaR	QuickGold	am thnkin about simple website may be a blog, basicly it will need PHP and MySQL, no CMS. how many useres?! depends on my luck!
