2009-09-24T10:02:00.000Z	Gracenotes		hm. true. it would need to be hooked into gnome somehow
2009-09-24T10:03:00.000Z	Gracenotes		particularly, the lid-close trigger
2009-09-24T10:04:00.000Z	Gracenotes		I should be clear, every in this computer is under my data jurisdiction (lol haruhi). no one else uses it. I'd like to diversify the passwords I use, i.e. use less sensitive ones in common public situations, like unlocking screens
2009-09-24T10:04:00.000Z	Gracenotes		everything
2009-09-24T10:05:00.000Z	Gracenotes		I do, with less frequency than the other
2009-09-24T10:05:00.000Z	Gracenotes		it would just be nice if it were easily possible, I would certainly do it.
2009-09-24T10:06:00.000Z	Gracenotes		I remember from Window 98 days, there was a separate screensaver password. I'm not sure if that feature is still around in windows... I think they just go straight to the login screen
2009-09-24T10:08:00.000Z	Gracenotes		from a technical point of view, it would work, but would go against the original motivation of doing it in the first place ;)
2009-09-24T10:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gracenotes	You might be able to do it by running gnome-screensaver as a different user
2009-09-24T10:10:00.000Z	Gracenotes	Jordan_U	hm, would that require typing in the other user's password first, in order to run gnome-screensaver?
2009-09-24T10:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gracenotes	Yes, but only once ( though I have never tried this myself and don't know if running gnome-screensaver as a different user would even work )
2011-07-12T05:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gracenotes	Can you do a terminal login, run "gnome-session 2>&1 | tee /tmp/gnome-session-log.txt" then pastebin /tmp/gnome-session-log.txt ?
2011-07-12T05:53:00.000Z	Gracenotes	Jordan_U	ah. I assume there is output, but once I do xinit gdm, or gnome-session I suppose, I can't see it. tee makes lots of sense >_> brb
2011-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	Gracenotes	Jordan_U	hm... I run xinit gnome-session... it says gnome-user-share can't be started as root, and additionally the login screen never shows up
2011-07-12T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gracenotes	You should not be running anything as root. Are you?
2011-07-12T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gracenotes	I thought you were using the failsafe terminal option from GDM (the Gnome login screen).
2011-07-12T06:05:00.000Z	Gracenotes	Jordan_U	no, that fails
2011-07-12T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gracenotes	Do you see the GDM screen at all?
2011-07-12T06:06:00.000Z	Gracenotes	Jordan_U	yes. and I type in my password. And there's a blank screen, and I'm back at the login screen.
