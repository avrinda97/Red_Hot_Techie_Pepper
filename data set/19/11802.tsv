2005-12-21T07:40:00.000Z	sowdog		heya, I need some help with ubuntu. I don't know if it's ubuntu specific. Networking in ubuntu doesn't seem to work. Booting into windows is fine(dhcp) is fine. Ubuntu static and dhcp doesn't work
2005-12-21T07:42:00.000Z	sowdog		pinging google.com works. nslookup google.com is correct. Trying to connect to googl.com doesn't work.Sticking in the ip address works

2005-12-21T07:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	sowdog	more likely it's nat on the router
2005-12-21T07:51:00.000Z	sowdog	frogzoo	looks that way otherwise they'd block of my ping right?
2005-12-21T07:51:00.000Z	frogzoo	sowdog	do you have access lists anywhere on the router? firewall?
