2012-09-17T16:32:00.000Z	WACOMalt		if so, apparantly following this guide, but replacing step 2 with steps 1-3 ftom this guide http://www.ozbotz.org/opencv-installation/ will make it work :D
2012-09-17T16:32:00.000Z	WACOMalt		according to a random comment about missing those packages in ubuntu
2012-09-17T16:32:00.000Z	WACOMalt		looks like you may not even need thsoe packages because the replacement steps dont show it at all
2012-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	WACOMalt		NZB is a usenet reference file
2012-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	WACOMalt		so yes, much like a .torrent file. referencing where to download files from for whatever package.
2012-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	like I said
2012-09-17T16:35:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	yes the program does work fine just like NNTPGrab wich is even better imo.. but I still cannot open an NZB file and the correct prog will start.
2012-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	 YES it is
2012-09-17T16:38:00.000Z	WACOMalt	sebas_	try right clicking file and choose open with, then try custom command
2012-09-17T16:39:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	to get custom command I need to reset it first?
2012-09-17T16:40:00.000Z	WACOMalt	sebas_	I'm not sure sorry, I only recently switched to ubuntu. Just search for how to change file associations in 12.04
2012-09-17T16:40:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	I do the whole day already
2012-09-17T16:42:00.000Z	WACOMalt	sebas_	ok do this, right click on the nzb file, go to PROPERTIES
2012-09-17T16:44:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	hehe yes and that too won;t work..
2012-09-17T16:44:00.000Z	WACOMalt	sebas_	this goes into detail on how to MANUALLY specify the command. it's kinda in depth
2012-09-17T16:45:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	I've never worked with Gnome.. I use KDE for years but want to switch to the new Ubuntu.
2012-09-17T16:46:00.000Z	WACOMalt	sebas_	I've been on gnome for years technically, but only recently came back to linux in general. Gnome has changed.. not for the better I'm afraid.
2012-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	First I thought that Unity was a replacement of Gnome.. seems not to be
2012-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	sebas_	WACOMalt	hehehe same here I'm confused by that.. but I must say that I like it till now
