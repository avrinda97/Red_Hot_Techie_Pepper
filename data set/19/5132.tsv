2008-08-26T09:24:00.000Z	murlidhar	[T]BludShoT	my personnel recommendation would be to use debian based systems
2008-08-26T09:30:00.000Z	murlidhar	[T]BludShoT	there is always an alternate install cd  . u can use that . even i use the alternate install cd . it is pretty easy too.
2008-08-26T09:33:00.000Z	murlidhar	[T]BludShoT	try alternate cd . i am sure you won't be disappointed
2008-08-26T09:33:00.000Z	[T]BludShoT	murlidhar	I have tried the alternate cd like 8 times
2008-08-26T09:34:00.000Z	murlidhar	[T]BludShoT	did u do a base installation . or a distro that is uses less resources.
2008-08-26T09:34:00.000Z	murlidhar	[T]BludShoT	use WattOS distro .
