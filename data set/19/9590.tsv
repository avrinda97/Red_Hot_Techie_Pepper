2008-03-06T08:16:00.000Z	SilentDis		quick question for everyone.  from your experiences, what is a decent size for a / partition (excluding /home, including /tmp) for a more 'average' user?
2008-03-06T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	10-15 gb would be spacious
2008-03-06T08:17:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	would i run into issue with 8gb?
2008-03-06T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	you might, , for example if you were building a dvd
2008-03-06T08:20:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	I keep several 12gb partitions around for different installs. I've maxed out at 7 when I had a _lot_ installed, several desktops, etc
2008-03-06T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	for most uses, yes. If mom isn't going to install a lot of stuff
2008-03-06T08:23:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	she likes to 'play' in the add/remove programs area i've found, which resulted in this problem in the first place lol
2008-03-06T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	pppconf , with pon/poff in terminal
2008-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	erm, pppconfig that is
2008-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	so i'll be doing a bit of mucking at first.  this HAS to be GUI for her to do it herself later.  can you recommend a GTK+ dialer app?  (i use EVDO myself, but i'm using kubuntu & kppp works well)
2008-03-06T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	 network manager applet has a ppp dialer, but I've never used it. My favorite for gnome disappeared
2008-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	gnome-ppp sounds usable
2008-03-06T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	when 8.04 is released, you can upgrade in place over the net, without having to reinstall
2008-03-06T08:46:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	right, but would you trust your mom to actually be patient enough as the download happens?  mine burns water in saucepans, and yells at the microwave to hurry up!
2008-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	tell her to do it before going to bed :)
2008-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	that is FARRR too many instructions.  she'd be likely to start it, then shut down the computer and go to bed lol
2008-03-06T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	SilentDis	sounds like it's a chance for you to have a few hours of quality time with mom ;)
2008-03-06T08:49:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	why don't i just hand you a gun so you can blow my brains out right now?  family functions, sure, then i can loose myself in meal prep lol
2008-03-06T08:50:00.000Z	SilentDis	nickrud	seriously, i love her dearly, but sometimes....  she's just... mom.  lol
