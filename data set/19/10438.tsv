2006-11-04T12:59:00.000Z	trelayne		hi all, just installed Dapper. ANyone know how to enable ssh from remote?
2006-11-04T12:59:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	install openssh-server
2007-06-08T12:09:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	32bit version will give you less headaches
2007-06-08T12:09:00.000Z	trelayne	jrib	thanks.. I needed to know since I've been hearing that support for some simple  apps is not there yet
2010-03-30T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	no it means "Long Term Support"
2010-03-30T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	you mean 10.04?
2010-03-30T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	the versions correspond to dates by the way.  10.04 == 2010 April
2010-03-30T03:11:00.000Z	trelayne	jrib	 yes sorry. Thanks, good to know!
2010-08-31T20:23:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	10.04.1 is just 10.04 with upgrades
2010-08-31T20:23:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	it's the same release
2010-09-02T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	* * * * *
2010-09-02T19:54:00.000Z	trelayne	jrib	aha, thanks!
2010-10-21T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	you want some text to tell you what is going on instead of just the pretty boot graphic?
2010-10-21T07:16:00.000Z	trelayne	jrib	yep
2010-10-21T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	do you happen to also not want gdm to start?
2010-10-21T07:17:00.000Z	trelayne	jrib	 it's mainly because something is dramatically slowing down the login window from showing earlier than a minute
2010-10-21T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	trelayne	ah, then bootchart is probably more helpful in that case.
2010-10-21T07:17:00.000Z	trelayne	jrib	 thanks none the less
