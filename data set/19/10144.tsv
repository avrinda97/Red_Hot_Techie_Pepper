2006-07-23T15:45:00.000Z	b33rnut1		Ok, I have a network question. After I used ndiswrapper with my network adapter, I cannot connect. It tells me that the drivers are working with the hardware, and when trying to set up the network, I get a "wlan0" option. I can even go in and set up my static IP and my WEP and everything, but it refuses to connect to the network. For comparison, I can get this adapter working in Windows (what I'm asking the question from, actually.) Any ideas?
2006-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	is the wifi light on ?
2006-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	i have had to ifconfig up/down my broadcom and load the module in "not scanning mode" to get it to work, this was evident by a fast blinking light from the adapter vs. steady blinking
2006-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	b33rnut1		Hmm...I didn't look, actually. It seems to be working though because it detects all the networks in the neighborhood around me (like 10-15 of them.) including the one I'm trying to connet to.
2006-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	yeah i had that issue, if you try an "iwconfig essid (your essid) mode managed key (if any)
2006-07-23T15:47:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	is this dappeR?
2006-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	b33rnut1	nny	Dapper, yeah.
2006-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	what does iwlist say?
2006-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	b33rnut1	nny	I can go check real quick, I'll ahve to restart into Ubuntu
2006-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	nny		(guess it would say "networks found: blah) if you see them in network neighboorhood..
2006-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	nny		oh so not working in windows either?
2006-07-23T15:48:00.000Z	nny		(i should read your q again)
2006-07-23T15:49:00.000Z	b33rnut1		It's working in Windows
2006-07-23T15:49:00.000Z	b33rnut1		Yeah, I guess I don't follow
2006-07-23T15:49:00.000Z	b33rnut1		I'm using it right now on my Windows partition
2006-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	my experience: iwconfig is your best bet, if it says "mac address: 000000" or such, than it is not truly connected... i wonder what card you have
2006-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	b33rnut1	nny	It's a DWL-G132 (D-Link) USB adapter
2006-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	nny		btw speaking of Xorg and notebooks, anyone have an inkling of knowledge as to why Xorg7 + nvidia drivers = black screen at ctrl/alt f* or when i hibernate?
2006-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	nny	b33rnut1	gotta run, coffee shop is closing, good luck
