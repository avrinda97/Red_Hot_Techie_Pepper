2009-05-10T12:35:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	I would recommend Ubuntu.
2009-05-10T12:37:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	Try Ubuntu. If you are new to linux, Ubuntu would be a good start.
2009-05-10T12:37:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	Are you new to linux?
2009-05-10T12:38:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	Then i would recommend going with Ubuntu. It is best for getting started.
2009-05-10T12:39:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	Are you thinking about changing to Ubuntu?
2009-05-10T12:40:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	If you are considering changing your operating system to Ubuntu, I would recommend going with the Ubuntu distrobution. It is a good starting point for people who are new to Ubuntu.
2009-05-10T12:41:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	You are welcome :). Enjoy Ubuntu if you decide to use it!
2009-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	KDE runs on Kubuntu. Its a Window Manager like Gnome.
2009-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	roadmap	qa321qa123	KDE4 can be slow on older computers. It may be better to use something like Gnome (which Ubuntu uses) or XFCE (which XUbuntu uses)
