2010-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	eryc		booted old kernel, followed that guide, success.
2010-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	eryc		any recommendations on upgrading Ubuntu 6.10?
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	If I recall correctly, you can't upgrade that version of Ubuntu without a full reinstall of the OS?
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	eryc	Sc00t3r	yea thats what i found out last time i tried..
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	So honestly, I'm pretty sure you can't do much without doing a reinstall to 10.04 or 9.11..
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	10.04 is a great distribution. Are you using a lower-end computer?
2010-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	just move the scripts onto a flash drive or a external.
2010-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	eryc	Sc00t3r	yep :)
2010-06-07T06:43:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	Don't make the same mistake as me and delete some partitions to extend others to fit space. I did that just a few hours ago and i f'd up my whole installation of Windows and Linux. I can tell you, that was a 'facepalm' moment.
2010-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	Ubuntu is one of the greatest distributions of Linux out there. As long as you pay attention to the upgrades, you'll never run into this situation again.
2010-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	They don't feel like taking the time to work on those packages, and besides, I'm pretty sure they don't need people taking up bandwidth with downloading it./
2010-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	eryc	Sc00t3r	thats ridiculous. no one is downloading them!
2010-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	Hence why they would remove them. Just taking up space, IMO.
2010-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	eryc	Sc00t3r	taking up space in this day!?!
2010-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	eryc	Meh, I wouldn't really care. If ya' don't like the fact they don't support it anymore, just remember to upgrade. =D
2010-06-07T06:47:00.000Z	eryc	Sc00t3r	indeed :)
