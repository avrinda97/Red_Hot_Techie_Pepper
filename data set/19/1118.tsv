2011-05-04T04:38:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	why do want to do that?
2011-05-04T04:40:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	if you installed it via apt, just go to Synaptic and uninstall it
2011-05-04T04:41:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	it does
2011-05-04T04:41:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	good deal, thanks man
2011-05-04T04:41:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	my pleasure
2011-05-04T04:42:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	actually I'm now seeing that I had not downloaded python, it's integral to ubuntu, well, unity...
2011-05-04T04:42:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	here's the command I put in terminal: $sudo apt-get install aptitude python-statgrab ttf-droid hddtemp curl lm-sensors conky-all
2011-05-04T04:43:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	unless you are crunched for disk space, don't worry a bout those. they're harmless
2011-05-04T04:43:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	any clue about what messed up my splash screens
2011-05-04T04:44:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	what splash scrren?
2011-05-04T04:45:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	well I'm referring to them as splash screens, the "Ubuntu" screen with the "....." when you are starting up and shutting down. They just kinda go black and do some crazy pixelation, thing. not really sure
2011-05-04T04:45:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	did this start after you installed that software?
2011-05-04T04:48:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	you can try autoclean. sudo apt-get autoclean
2011-05-04T04:48:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	says it's unable to find package "autoclean"
2011-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	it's part of apt-get. it should just be "sudo apt-get autoclean"
2011-05-04T04:51:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	ok, it ran... well, the command ran without errors.
2011-05-04T04:51:00.000Z	bull9408	zizban	is that all there is to it?
2011-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	zizban	bull9408	yup so it found nothing. That was a long shot. Try uninstalling everything you installed, what you listed
