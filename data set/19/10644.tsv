2006-06-18T07:50:00.000Z	jorvis_		I'm installing Dapper and have got to the "Prepare partitions" step (gui) ... I see the partition where I want to install it, but I don't see how to mark it as the "/" partition.  help?
2006-06-18T07:52:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	You are using the Desktop CD install, and not the alternate?
2006-06-18T07:53:00.000Z	jorvis_	cge	yes, the desktop ... I have winxp on another partition, and a fat32 partition with data I want to keep.  I see the previous /, /boot and swap areas from my last install, and I want it to re-use those
2006-06-18T07:54:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	I can't quite recall with the Desktop CD, since I never use it to install. The partitioner is really quite poor on the desktop cd.
2006-06-18T07:56:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	If you do want to use the partitions, if I recall correctly, you go to the next screen and can select the partition use there.
2006-06-18T07:56:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	But I would recommend the alternate cd for manual partitioning.
2006-06-18T07:57:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	It doesn't use one.
2006-06-18T07:58:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	You don't need one if you are using ext3.
2006-06-18T07:59:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	And if you tell the desktop installer to use something other than ext3, it generally ignores you.
2006-06-18T08:00:00.000Z	jorvis_	cge	it's going now.   it was pretty clear after I cleared the old partitions and clicked next, but a little more information on the "step 5" screen would have been useful, like "You will be able to assign mount points to any created partitions on the next screen"
2006-06-18T08:00:00.000Z	jorvis_	cge	crap.  "Failed to create a file system"
2006-06-18T08:00:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	The desktop install really seems to be geared toward people who don't understand what partitions or mount points are.
2006-06-18T08:02:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	Hmmm... I think there is an error log somewhere, maybe Ctrl-Alt-F{X} where {X} is some number between 8 and 12?
2006-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	jorvis_	cge	I had a terminal window open in the old mount point.  that was probably it
2006-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	Ouch
2006-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	You'll have to restart. I hate that part of linux.
2006-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	jorvis_	cge	restarting already
2006-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	jorvis_	cge	 either way, this is much easier than getting Vista installed.  : )
2006-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	cge	jorvis_	True.
