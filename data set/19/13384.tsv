2005-04-08T14:03:00.000Z	MaRk-I		anyone had problems running Live CD or Install CD from the freebies???
2005-04-08T14:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 "the freebies?"  i downloaded each here for free and they work well here if you mean that
2005-04-08T14:04:00.000Z	MaRk-I	eyequeue	the ones ubuntu ships
2005-04-08T14:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 okay, just aquick intro: warty is the current stable release, version 4.10.  hoary is the not-yet-released (but close) development release, version 5.04
2005-04-08T14:10:00.000Z	MaRk-I	eyequeue	oh thanks guess it's the warty release
2005-04-08T14:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 cool, wish i could help with the blank screen, but it's out of my league
2005-04-08T14:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 yeah, warty
2005-04-08T14:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 i somewhat suspect it's video related, are you perhaps on a video card that it doesn't like?
2005-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	MaRk-I	eyequeue	I guess so but there's no option to tweak it
2005-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 i'm no guru with it, just hoping to trigger someone else to help
2005-04-08T14:15:00.000Z	MaRk-I	eyequeue	thanks appreciated
2005-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 in console there, the output from "dmesg | less" might tell you something about your hardware, if that's any help, not sure
2005-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	MaRk-I	eyequeue	I dont get anything not even console
2005-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 i mean in mdk
2005-04-08T14:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	mdk sees and likes your hardwre, so it knows it all
2005-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 just a quick information point, do you get anything at all of potential interest just before the blanking?
2005-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	MaRk-I	eyequeue	just the UBUNTU splash... if I press ESC I see when its detecting hardware, etc. then same thing... blank
2005-04-08T14:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 i know you don't want to isntall right now, but ... does that cd get anywhere? (choose expert and abort before anything would write to the hard drive)
2005-04-08T14:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	MaRk-I	 then that cd can definitely cope with your video card, so we learned something
