2008-09-14T23:27:00.000Z	fo_x86		what is a good size of RAM for Ubuntu 2.6?
2008-09-14T23:27:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	ubuntu 2.6?
2008-09-14T23:27:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	I meant the latest version of Ubuntu
2008-09-14T23:28:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	in terms of ram, 512 will work for ubuntu
2008-09-14T23:28:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	recommended minimum says 384
2008-09-14T23:28:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	oh, use 1gb
2008-09-14T23:30:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	with virtualbox, if I give ubuntu 1 GB of RAM is XP always left with 2GBs or is it only when I'm running Ubuntu inside?
2008-09-14T23:30:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	only when you're running ubuntu
2008-09-14T23:30:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	it just means that the virtual machine will use 1gb of ram when it's running
2008-09-14T23:31:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	one more question, when I go see the system properties I have 2 GBs but virtualbox gives me upto 3.5GB of RAM to choose from why is that?
2008-09-14T23:31:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	not sure (maybe you do have 3.5), but just choose 1 to be safe
2008-09-14T23:32:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	thanks for your help
2008-09-14T23:35:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	sorry to bother but what is a good virtual harddrive size for the boot harddisk?
2008-09-14T23:35:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	for windows xp?
2008-09-14T23:35:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	how much hard disk space do you have?
2008-09-14T23:36:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	for windows I have 117 GB allocated
2008-09-14T23:36:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	depends, what are you going to be using the virtual machine for?
2008-09-14T23:36:00.000Z	keepsake	fo_x86	if it's not everyday use, then 10gb will more than suffice
2008-09-14T23:37:00.000Z	fo_x86	keepsake	ok thanks
