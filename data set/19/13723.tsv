2005-02-03T09:30:00.000Z	offbyone		g'morning.
2005-02-03T09:30:00.000Z	offbyone		I'm trying to grok how to determine what the prefix (as in ./configure --prefix=) for an apt package is so that I can upgrade it outside of the normal apt-method.
2005-02-03T09:30:00.000Z	offbyone		How would I do that?
2005-02-03T09:31:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	do you want to overwrite the files that are already there? or install it into a new location?
2005-02-03T09:39:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	depends on the package
2005-02-03T09:40:00.000Z	offbyone	Ng	I mean the Debian package of Subversion from Debian sid
2005-02-03T09:40:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	it might work :)
2005-02-03T09:40:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	it might want to remove half your packages and set the rest on fire ;)
2005-02-03T09:41:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	you could grab the debian package source and rebuild that
2005-02-03T09:42:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	it's unlikely warty would change enough for there to be a problem, but at some point you might find that apt doesn't want to upgrade because something is depending on the package you built, in which case you remove it, let apt upgrade and then build the package again
2005-02-03T09:45:00.000Z	offbyone	Ng	ogra: The problem is that Svn is notorious for ugly upgrades -- the repository format isn't rock-solid, especially the DB type. So it's a bit of a pain.
2005-02-03T09:46:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	might be an idea to stick with the subversion that's in warty maybe?
2005-02-03T09:47:00.000Z	offbyone	Ng	The problem is, the svn version in Warty is a bit fragile -- the repository format isn't too solid, and there are security issues that have been fixed in later versions.
2005-02-03T09:47:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	ah :)
2005-02-03T10:45:00.000Z	offbyone	Ng	Thanks for the help, the upgrade went seamlessly on both the laptop and the server.
2005-02-03T10:46:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	cool :)
2005-02-03T10:48:00.000Z	offbyone	Ng	One more question -- I'm not seeing how to lock a package in Synaptic. Is there a dpkg command or apt command I should use instead? I'm not a fan of the Synaptic app -- sluggish, and the command line is more powerful :)
2005-02-03T10:49:00.000Z	offbyone	Ng	never mind, it's just not in the right-click menu
2005-02-03T10:49:00.000Z	Ng	offbyone	found it in the Package menu?
