2009-03-23T06:01:00.000Z	Clone1		I tried my window's login / password and that was a no go.

2009-03-23T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	use adduser (if you can access a shell at all)
2009-03-23T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	just type "adduser username"
2009-03-23T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	well i have no idea why it hasn't
2009-03-23T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	i can try to fix it, though
2009-03-23T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	do you get a brief boot menu screen when you start your computer, just before the ubuntu logo shows up?
2009-03-23T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	ok, then in that menu, hit "e". it'll let you edit the Ubuntu booting options. select the longest line that you see, and hit "e" again. then add " init=/bin/bash" to the end of that line
2009-03-23T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	then finally hit "b" to boot. you should be dropped to a root terminal, where you can type "adduser username". then you can reboot (ctrl+alt+del or "exit"), and user that account
2009-03-23T06:05:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	oh actually, type also "adduser username admin" to make your new user an administrator, you'll need that
2009-03-23T06:05:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	ok, you might want to write it down too
2009-03-23T06:24:00.000Z	LjL	Clone1	wait, you shouldn't have done that *from the CD*, but from your installation
