2007-12-17T16:10:00.000Z	dmgubuntu		Does anyone know why wireless would work with a livecd and not work once gutsy is installed?
2007-12-17T16:10:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	What wireless do you have?
2007-12-17T16:11:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	I don't know. I am trying to install on my friends machine. How do I find out?
2007-12-17T16:12:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	I do it a simple way. Go up to the network icon and right click it, and then go to 'Connection Information'. Should be located under driver.
2007-12-17T16:12:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	THat option is greyed out for me.
2007-12-17T16:15:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	lspci -v
2007-12-17T16:15:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	Atheros AR2413...?
2007-12-17T16:15:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	Yes, that is the one.
2007-12-17T16:16:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	Yes, that is the one.
2007-12-17T16:16:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	what do I do with that info?
2007-12-17T16:17:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	Open up the 'Synaptic Package Manager' and install 'acer-acpi' and 'acerwificontroller'.
2007-12-17T16:19:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	I did a search for those packages and I didn't find them. Are they in another repo?
2007-12-17T16:20:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	Sorry, I was assuming it was a Acer Aspire 5040?
2007-12-17T16:21:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	it's an aspire 3500. But the packages aren't showing up... so is that because they are in a non-default repo?
2007-12-17T16:23:00.000Z	BB88	dmgubuntu	If they are not displaying now, then I assume so. Do you have the backup or recovery disk at hand?
2007-12-17T16:24:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	I have only just installed gutsy so if that's what you mean by the backup/recovery disk... the install disk... then yes.
2007-12-17T16:24:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	BTW... the machine I am working on is not connected at all. I am using another machine which is connected via wifi
2007-12-17T16:25:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	... to chat
2007-12-17T16:34:00.000Z	dmgubuntu	BB88	do you know what repo those packages are from?
