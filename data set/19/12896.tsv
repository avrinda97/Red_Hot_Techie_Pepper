2005-06-17T09:42:00.000Z	smoky_		i have problems with my brightness keys on my acer travelmate
2005-06-17T09:43:00.000Z	smoky_		anyone any idea how to solve succh problem?
2005-06-17T09:43:00.000Z	jind_	smoky_	works here. I have a travelmate 290
2005-06-17T09:43:00.000Z	smoky_		i searched the forums but didn't find an real answer
2005-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	smoky_	jind_	i have the problem that they only work some times...
2005-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	smoky_		i need 3 minutes or so to adjust my brightness
2005-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	jind_		Maybe you can add a acpi=off and see if that helps?
2005-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	smoky_		but i don't understand cause this should be a bios function
2005-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	smoky_		it works under windows and other linux distros
2005-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	smoky_		but not under linux
2005-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	jind_		You add that in the kernel line in the grub config
2005-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	smoky_		sorry ubuntu hoary
2005-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	smoky_		http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-26161.html - this guy has the same problem, but no solution
2005-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	jind_		Try acpi=off first. If the kernel controlles the acpi, it will block the bios control over it
2005-06-17T09:46:00.000Z	smoky_	jind_	but i need acpi for the rest!
2005-06-17T09:46:00.000Z	smoky_		anyone other here, with an acer travelmate?
2005-06-17T09:47:00.000Z	smoky_	jind_	any other hints?
2005-06-17T09:48:00.000Z	jind_	smoky_	sorry mate. I'm out of guesses
