2009-04-27T14:11:00.000Z	mwas		folks, my laptop gets hanged once I open any mpeg file. How to get around this problem? Any Idea? My Machine goes dumb stuck and I have to restart
2009-04-27T14:12:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	first, you can use ctrl+alt+backspace to kill your session so you don't have to reboot.
2009-04-27T14:12:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	second, which player are you using?
2009-04-27T14:14:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	try if a different player like VLC works
2009-04-27T14:14:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	I tried with all nothing work
2009-04-27T14:16:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	did you try VLC? I'm asking again because VLC uses different set of codecs. in case your codecs are corrupted, you'll know then
2009-04-27T14:16:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	I ran Hardware Testing and while it tests for display, my box goes stuck
2009-04-27T14:16:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	which display card do you have?
2009-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	How do I get that info
2009-04-27T14:19:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	go to terminal and typ sudo lshw
2009-04-27T14:20:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	and press enter
2009-04-27T14:21:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	82G33/G31 Express Integrated Graphics Controller by Intel
2009-04-27T14:22:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	ok. is compiz active?
2009-04-27T14:23:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	yes
2009-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	then use the command 'metacity --replace' without quotes and run the video
2009-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	that is if you're on gnome
2009-04-27T14:32:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	what does that do?
2009-04-27T14:33:00.000Z	wtv	mwas	that disables compiz. it happens at times that video doesn't work when compiz is active
2009-04-27T14:38:00.000Z	mwas	wtv	just curious, diff between compiz and X
