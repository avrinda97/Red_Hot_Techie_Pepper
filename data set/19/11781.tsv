2006-09-02T14:52:00.000Z	rev11		id rather just download an older version, this is real stupid,
2006-09-02T14:52:00.000Z	rev11		because xorg.conf doesnt even have the driver field like everyone says

2006-09-02T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	installing breezy (one version back) is not a bad idea
2006-09-02T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	when people ask you to post, they mean to a web site.  I'll give you the url in a second
2006-09-02T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-09-02T15:00:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	it isn't possible that the file exists, but is empty
2006-09-02T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	I gave you the url to the pastebin
2006-09-02T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	do you mean how do you paste it to the paste web site?
2006-09-02T15:02:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	you edit it with an editor, and copy and paste it.
2006-09-02T15:02:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	no, don't paste it here
2006-09-02T15:02:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	paste it to #flood
2006-09-02T15:23:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	on what site?  you pasted it?
2006-09-02T15:24:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	"doesn't work" isn't helpful.  what happens
2006-09-02T15:26:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	no, what is the error when you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-09-02T15:28:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	that's not an error
2006-09-02T15:29:00.000Z	sethk	rev11	you go completely through the entire procedure, it identifies your graphics card and monitor, and completes?
