2006-11-02T15:31:00.000Z	pan2		looking for some help: tried installing ubuntu this evening on my SATA drive and I get GRUB Error 22
2006-11-02T15:32:00.000Z	pan2		dual boot with XP, sorry meant to add that
2006-11-02T15:32:00.000Z	pan2		I have two IDE drives and GRUB was actually installed on the first of those, even though all the OSes are on the other SATA drive
2006-11-02T15:33:00.000Z	pan2		carinarr- do tell
2006-11-02T15:35:00.000Z	pan2		well let me ask this, what exactly does "hd0" mean-- that's where GRUB was installed and that's not the drive withthe OS nor the drive I normally boot from, but I took it because it was the default and no other options were listed
2006-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	defrysk	pan2	(hd0) means mbr of master disk
2006-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	pan2		 defrysk- and which is the master disk?
2006-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	defrysk		master hd not slabe
2006-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	defrysk		slave
2006-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	defrysk		yes
2006-11-02T15:37:00.000Z	defrysk		yes
2006-11-02T15:37:00.000Z	pan2	defrysk	ok, but in my case i'm running everything off of a SATA drive (which the ubuntu installer thinks is a SCSI drive, /sda)
2006-11-02T15:37:00.000Z	pan2		What should I enter instead of hd0 to have GRUB put on the MBR of that disk?
2006-11-02T15:37:00.000Z	defrysk	pan2	it gives an error off and on right ?
2006-11-02T15:38:00.000Z	defrysk	pan2	as in not always
2006-11-02T15:38:00.000Z	pan2		defrysk- no, the error is consistent.  i've never successfully booted, always error 22
2006-11-02T15:38:00.000Z	defrysk	pan2	and you simply installed it in the mbr
2006-11-02T15:39:00.000Z	pan2	defrysk	well, i just followed the ubuntu installer off of the live cd and clicked ok when it was time to install grub.  like i said, it put it on hd0 even though that's not the drive i normally use (i then changed the bios settings to boot off of that drive instead otherwise it wouldn't see grub at all)
