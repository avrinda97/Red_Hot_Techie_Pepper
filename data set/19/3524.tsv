2012-05-10T07:04:00.000Z	kevin		hi all. so i just upgraded to oneiric. in the process of going to precise... general question: so i chose lightdm over gdm. in gdm, to run an application it was alt+f2, and now it's coming up as a "search" or whatever... i don't need to search. i know what i want to run. what's the keyboard shortcut for that in lightdm?
2012-05-10T07:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	I think you have lightdm/gmd confused with gnome/unity
2012-05-10T07:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	lightdm and gdm are what you see when you are typing in your password to log in
2012-05-10T07:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	what you are describing is the unity search bar (after being logged in)
2012-05-10T07:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	if you just need it for launching applications, then just use it like you did the old F2. If you hint enter it will automatically launch the top-left-most application being displayed
2012-05-10T07:07:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	well, i did alt+f2, type in 'totem' and hit enter. nothing happens. but if i type 'totem' in a terminal window, it opens up. sooo i dont know why it's not working in this unity search thing.
2012-05-10T07:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	when you type in "totem" into the search, do you see the totem player's icon in the box below the search line?
2012-05-10T07:09:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	nope. there's totem-audio-preview, totem-video-indexer, totem-thumbnail-viewer
2012-05-10T07:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	could you post a screenshot?
2012-05-10T07:09:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	sure. sec.

2012-05-10T07:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	try the totem-video-indexer one, it may just have a weird name...
2012-05-10T07:13:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	no go.
2012-05-10T07:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	can you click the second icon at the very bottom? (ruler|pen|pencil icon)
2012-05-10T07:15:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	heh, okay. it's showing up as "movie player"
2012-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	so problem solved?
2012-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	so if i alt+f2 and type  'movie player' , it opens up.
2012-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	kevin	DarwinSurvivor	well, it seems unintuitive. i want to run 'totem' , not 'movie player' heh...
2012-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kevin	I guess the totem devs decided "totem" was descriptive enough :P
