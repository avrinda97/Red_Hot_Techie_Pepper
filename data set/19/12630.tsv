2005-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	R0bNyc		is ubuntu stable?
2005-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	R0bNyc		i wonder how can i be more up to date if possible
2005-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	there's not a correct yes or no answer to that
2005-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	how come
2005-11-15T16:13:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	how stable do you need?
2005-11-15T16:13:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	stable/up to date
2005-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	those two are trade-offs.  the more up to date a system is, the less stable it's likely to be.
2005-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	ubuntu is a pretty good balance.  not ancient like debian stable, but not so shiny-new that it's always broken.
2005-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	unfortunately some ppl think like that .. but most that know about it know is not true
2005-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	mkay.
2005-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	thanks but i can assure of u others not so many that are shiny new and 90% of the time are stable w/o any probs
2005-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	90% != stable dude
2005-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	hey 90 is a lot
2005-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	if 90% is good to you then I can say yes, ubuntu is hella stable.
2005-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	lol anyway i can go debian sid or something
2005-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	but if 90% is good enough for you, you don't need to worry about stability
2005-11-15T16:17:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	yeah newbies only know about vi and cat and echo
2005-11-15T16:18:00.000Z	trappist	R0bNyc	are you here to troll or do you have a sensible question?
2005-11-15T16:19:00.000Z	R0bNyc	trappist	no quesiton at the moment .. i'll be back going to take a nap
