2005-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	peritus		my wireless network is disconnecting often, but it keeps alive when im ping my router all the time
2005-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	what mode is it in
2005-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	mode?
2005-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	a/b/g
2005-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	how can i find out?
2005-10-30T12:02:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	umm you should know what your wireless card supports, 802.11a or b or g
2005-10-30T12:02:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	g
2005-10-30T12:03:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	what is your router?
2005-10-30T12:03:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	so your wireless card is g only?
2005-10-30T12:05:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	im not sure. the card is wg511t from netgear(http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WG511T.php) , and the AP is linksys WAP54G
2005-10-30T12:06:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	chek your settings on your router, make sure they do not read "super G mode " or "gaming mode" that makes the connection fast but unreliable
2005-10-30T12:07:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	my AP is in "mixed" mode
2005-10-30T12:07:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	put it in G only if no one else uses your router.
2005-10-30T12:08:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	now im in G-Only
2005-10-30T12:09:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	that MIGHT fix it.
2005-10-30T12:09:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	try it out for a bit
2005-10-30T12:10:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	similar thing was happening to my Girlfriends connection with my router. i had it in gaming mode, and it was very unstable, so since my wifi card supports a/b/g and hers is b, i put it in B mode, and i have NEVER had a disconnection since
2005-10-30T12:11:00.000Z	peritus	dmlinux	ahh i see
2005-10-30T12:12:00.000Z	dmlinux	peritus	could be as little as the router was working too hard translating modes
