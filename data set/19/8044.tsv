2007-05-13T16:42:00.000Z	stp2007b		Hi, I just managed to set up and connect with my wireless card. However I am experiencing some results which lead me to think things might not be perfect. Basically I can connect to reddit.com (which is very simple pretty much text only - so small as well). However when I try to connect to Mozilla Thunderbird site or CNN the pageload fails half way through. Finally, I can connect to cnn or thunderbird sites with my XP computer at the same time so I don'
2007-05-13T16:42:00.000Z	stp2007b		t think those pages/sites are down. Any thoughts?
2007-05-13T16:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	when you say the page load fails, what *exactly* happens?
2007-05-13T16:46:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	barbarella_me, I'm using firefox. I was attempting to download thunderbird and noticed the page load problem. What is happening is that when I try to access the thunderbird website (or cnn) the status bar just says "looking up www.mozilla.com" for a LONG LONG time.

2007-05-13T16:47:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	me? wrt signal strength? I'll see if I can figure that out?
2007-05-13T16:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	actually, you said it worked in XP
2007-05-13T16:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	is that with the same card on the same machine in the same place?
2007-05-13T16:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	oh, of course, you should try using a wired connection, just to make sure it *is* the wireless link that's the problem
2007-05-13T16:50:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	yes it worked with my XP computer. The card is not the same. My XP has a built in wireless "card". My Ubuntu installed laptop has an external wireless card. Finally when I hook up the Ubuntu physically to the net (wired connection) there isn't an issue.
2007-05-13T16:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	assuming you're fairly close to the wireless AP, you can probably rule out signal strength ;-)
2007-05-13T16:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	what kind of card?
2007-05-13T16:52:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	Yes I don't think it is signal strength. Wireless Assistant gives link quality 6 gold stars.
2007-05-13T16:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	I don't know, could be a problem with the card - some aren't well supported
2007-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	stp2007b	could be something daft like a bad DNS
2007-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	its a common chipset, I figured that out a while back, just trying to find my notes.
2007-05-13T16:54:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	its a RalinkRT2500 chipset. I've been using the following (among others) as reference during the setup:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/RalinkRT2500
2007-05-13T16:54:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	would bad DNS screw up my wireless but not wired connection?
2007-05-13T05:10:00.000Z	stp2007b	gordonjcp	thx for  your help hearlier
