2009-06-10T07:46:00.000Z	devi1		Can anybody help me change the display defaults to 1024x768?
2009-06-10T07:47:00.000Z	Blz	devi1	 have you tried the display manager?
2009-06-10T07:48:00.000Z	devi1	Blz	I'm not familiar with ubuntu, but I need to change it for all users even log in. the problem is the old dell monitor we have here will not show any other display modes... when i used display preferences as soon as i rebooted it went back to a different mode out of range for the monitor.
2009-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	Blz	devi1	 are you using proprietary drivers?
2009-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	devi1	Blz	None

2009-06-10T07:51:00.000Z	Blz	devi1	 sanity check:  are you an admin on the machine?
2009-06-10T07:51:00.000Z	devi1	Blz	No worries, any place I can find a text file in ubuntu to edit it there. Indeed I am, good question.
2009-06-10T07:52:00.000Z	Blz	devi1	 hmm... can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?

2009-06-10T08:00:00.000Z	devi1	Blz	well thanks for trying
2009-06-10T08:00:00.000Z	Blz	devi1	 yeah sorry... I can fix obvious problems, but this doesn't appear to be one.
2009-06-10T08:01:00.000Z	devi1	Blz	*nods* no worries I'm sure it's just a config problem somewhere that has to be over ridden with a display mode i can use...
