2008-12-02T06:05:00.000Z	zetheroo		anyone?
2008-12-02T06:05:00.000Z	zetheroo		please help ....  i just now rebooted form a kernel panic .... what do I do? ... where do I find the cause?
2008-12-02T06:05:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	run memtest
2008-12-02T06:06:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	what about logs
2008-12-02T06:06:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	memtest first
2008-12-02T06:08:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	what will a memtest do?
2008-12-02T06:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	and how will that help solve the issue?
2008-12-02T06:09:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	kernel panic happens because of a f'ed up kernel or ram issues... altho it depends on what the error was
2008-12-02T06:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	well even if it says something negative about my RAM I don't think I would replace my RAM to make Intrepid work ... ha ... I mean Hardy works fine as does Win XP Pro
2008-12-02T06:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	so I don't see why I should do a memtest ....
2008-12-02T06:11:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	it will f up sooner or later its better to know now than paying some mechanic 50 bucks for something you could have avoided sooner
2008-12-02T06:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	what do you mean? The RAM must be fine ... why would Hardy work fine and Intrepid cough up its spleen with the same RAM?
2008-12-02T06:12:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	then use an older kernel
2008-12-02T06:13:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	just run the test it wont hurt
2008-12-02T06:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	ha ... but it won't help either ...
2008-12-02T06:13:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	it will help if an error occurs if an error doesnt occur then the problem is buntu
2008-12-02T06:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	don't worry ... I have been told by a few ppl to do a memtest ... but the logic in that is somehow lost .... if there is an error I would still say it is an issue with Ubuntu Intrepid since Hardy works despite the RAM as does Win XP Pro ... see?
2008-12-02T06:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	Kumool	I have 3 GB of RAM ... how long would a memtest take?
2008-12-02T06:15:00.000Z	Kumool	zetheroo	about an hour i suppose
