2011-04-14T14:43:00.000Z	TorbenLars		so now i want install them. first my PC hardware: e5500 intel dualcore, 2 gb ram, wd green hdd, i only do this: openoffice, libreoffice pidgin, thunderbird
2011-04-14T14:43:00.000Z	TorbenLars		the problem is, not sure, if 10.10 is right for me, and if gnome or kde it is, is right for me
2011-04-14T14:44:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	= LarsTorben?
2011-04-14T14:48:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	If you don't know what you like, who buy your clothes?
2011-04-14T14:48:00.000Z	TorbenLars	red2kic	i really like gnome ubuntu 10.04 but 11.10 only unity
2011-04-14T14:49:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	That's more than six months. I fear you will be back asking us the very same questions.
2011-04-14T14:50:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	The point of linux (or freedom) is that you don't HAVE to use unity in 11.10.  Sure, it may be default but you can uninstall it and run old gnome 2.28
2011-04-14T14:52:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	It is not.
2011-04-14T14:54:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	April 28 is when Natty (11.04) comes out. However, if you wish to use solid stable, opt for Debian. You want to use latest Ubuntu? Go for 10.10 (or wait until 11.04 comes out).  10.04LTS (Long-Term Support) is nice too.
2011-04-14T14:55:00.000Z	TorbenLars	red2kic	normaly i want solid rock stable yes.
2011-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	You would want Debian (or Ubuntu 10.04 LTS).
2011-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	The choice is your.
2011-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	TorbenLars	red2kic	may i ask you, what do you use ?
2011-04-14T14:57:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	Either. I don't use Debian or Ubuntu -- but I have been meaning to give Debian a try sometimes in VM.
2011-04-14T14:58:00.000Z	red2kic	TorbenLars	Yes.
