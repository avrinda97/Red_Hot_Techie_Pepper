2010-07-28T18:43:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		how do i enable normal 'su'
2010-07-28T18:43:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		instead of sudo
2010-07-28T18:44:00.000Z	sipior	hrhrhr_	su comes installed by default, i believe.
2010-07-28T18:44:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		it doesn't seem to accept creds
2010-07-28T18:45:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		like it's disabled
2010-07-28T18:45:00.000Z	sipior	hrhrhr_	you can't use your own login's password with su, if that's what you're trying to do.
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		sudo is er
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		two extra chars to type
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		and im lazy
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		and also
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		sudo is gay
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		nm
2010-07-28T18:46:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		google :P
2010-07-28T18:49:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		i just dont agree with the whole 'all users are nubz so we need to keep them away from root shells'
2010-07-28T18:49:00.000Z	sipior	hrhrhr_	so do what you want. who cares?
2010-07-28T18:50:00.000Z	hrhrhr_	sipior	i thought for a moment i might not be the only person who came from slack
2010-07-28T18:50:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		and an answer would leap out at me
2010-07-28T18:50:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		clearly], this was foolish
2010-07-28T18:51:00.000Z	sipior	hrhrhr_	if you can't figure out how to enable su, do you *really* think you should have unmitigated access to a root shell?
