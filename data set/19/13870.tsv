2005-02-03T15:11:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	no
2005-02-03T15:12:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	and multiverse too :)
2005-02-04T17:15:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	in what way is it broken?
2005-02-04T17:18:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	what do you mean?
2005-02-04T17:19:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	did you install Marillat's realplayer package, or how did you install it?
2005-02-04T17:20:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	I'm not sure what the problem may be.  Can you tell me any more?
2005-02-04T17:22:00.000Z	carambol	tritium	it does not show up in synaptic
2005-02-04T17:23:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	"apt-cache policy realplayer" ?
2005-02-04T17:25:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	I guess that's the problem.  Looks like the dist-upgrade removed it.
2005-02-04T17:26:00.000Z	carambol	tritium	how to remve rp10?
2005-02-04T17:26:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	how did you install it?  It's not a .deb package, is it?
2005-02-04T17:27:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	I believe the realplayer .bin file saves a .log file somewhere of the actions it takes during installation.  you could try to undo what it did by checking it out
2005-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	first, try to locate the log file.  it may be a hidden file, so use ls -a when searching
2005-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	carambol	tritium	will try it
2005-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	that's about all I can suggest, since I don't have realplayer installed
2005-02-04T17:32:00.000Z	tritium	carambol	good luck - dinner time for me...see you later
