2007-10-21T06:30:00.000Z	KuJaX	Ahorner	 I have setup an account 6 months ago, and now it isnt there any more
2007-10-21T06:30:00.000Z	Ahorner		KujaX: yes it is probably gone by now. they send email confirmations every month
2007-10-21T06:30:00.000Z	KuJaX	Ahorner	 How do you keep them from deleting your account?  I want to set up an account that is going to be mission critial.

2007-10-21T06:32:00.000Z	KuJaX	Ahorner	 So that is the only stipulation, is that they send you an e-mail every month?  Do you have a link on their site where they talk about that?.
