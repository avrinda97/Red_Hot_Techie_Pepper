2006-10-05T08:18:00.000Z	lastnode		what is a .pb file and how can i open it in ubuntu>
2006-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	It could be anything.
2006-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	Traditionally, the "extension" is meaningless by itself on Linux and Unix systems.
2006-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	It does have semantic meaning to humans, though.
2006-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	of course. what i mean is, it generally denotes the file type
2006-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	Only by convention.
2006-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	yeah i know. is it a publisher file?
2006-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	Unix uses "Magic numbers" to denote file types, instead.
2006-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	im aware of all this. i just asked what a .pb file usually is.
2006-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	So, one uses "file", which looks at the first two bytes, which is hte magic number. (Shell scripts start with #!, which corresponds to the two-byte magic number)
2006-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	mate, you're preaching to the choir ;-)
2006-10-05T08:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	I'd suggest either google, or file, or just doubleclicking on it as a guest user, to see what the mime type is.
2006-10-05T08:23:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	i havent downloaded it yet, else id do 'file' on it. :-) im wondering if ill need any proprietary reader to read it, in which case i wont download it. ill google, thanks.
2006-10-05T08:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	Remember, if it's publisher, realise that even the specific _version_ matters. :(
2006-10-05T08:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	MS isn't even compatible with _themselves_. :(
2006-10-05T08:25:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	it's wordperfect, and im skipping the download. :-) thanks
2006-10-05T08:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	It's _possible_ that OOo can open such files.
2006-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	lastnode	Arafangion	id rather not use proprietary file extensions
2006-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	Arafangion	lastnode	Oooh! A fundamentalist! Cool :)
