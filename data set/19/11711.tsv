2006-01-17T16:27:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 That is true.  I wish Cedega wasn't such a annoying, subscription-based thing.
2006-01-17T16:41:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	lots of people
2006-01-18T17:37:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	it doesn't work with all cards though
2006-01-18T17:37:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 Maybe not, but it works on a lot.  It worked on mine.  Certainly it is worth a shot.
2006-01-18T17:38:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	right!
2006-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	you mean the codename like breezy?
2006-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	yeah
2006-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	is debian sarge better?
2006-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	a little, but not much
2006-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	or windows vista
2006-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 again, a little, but not much
2006-01-18T06:21:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 I like version numbers or year numbers to be honest.
2006-01-18T06:22:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	like ubuntu has?
2006-01-18T06:22:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 yeah, but no one ever uses them.  They just use breezy or hoary or something.  I can never remember which one I have.
2006-01-18T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	lsb_release will tell you what you have
2006-01-18T06:24:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 mine just says n/a
2006-01-18T06:24:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	lsb_release -a
2006-01-18T06:24:00.000Z	mitrovarr	mwe	 ah.  Still, the names are just kind of silly
2006-01-18T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	mitrovarr	maybe
