2007-10-20T15:29:00.000Z	nesoi		control-alt-backspace is dangerous... it should warn you before just killing your login session
2007-10-20T15:30:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	its an escape method
2007-10-20T15:30:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	if it warns you.. and your mouse doesnt move...
2007-10-20T15:33:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	ctrl+alt+backspace has been around a long time though....
2007-10-20T15:33:00.000Z	nesoi	chowmeined	that's nice, but if ubuntu is supposed to be a general replacement for consumer desktops, having that keystroke in it is Bad
2007-10-20T15:34:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	well... id rather have it.. when buggy gui apps decide to lock everything up
2007-10-20T15:34:00.000Z	nesoi	chowmeined	if it can be enabled specifically by those who want it, fine. if it's a default, Bad
2007-10-20T15:34:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	fine
2007-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	guess we should disable alt+sysctrl then...
2007-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	nesoi	chowmeined	what does that do?
2007-10-20T15:35:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	does special debug stuff by directly interfacing with the kernel
2007-10-20T15:36:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	for example.. alt+sysctrl+b instantly reboots your computer (unsafe shutdown)
2007-10-20T15:36:00.000Z	nesoi	chowmeined	yep, that should be enabled only when wanted, by developers and the like
2007-10-20T15:36:00.000Z	nesoi	chowmeined	just think about your grandmother using it... she hits the wrong keys and bang... all her work is gone
2007-10-20T15:38:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	windows should disable blue screens
2007-10-20T15:39:00.000Z	nesoi	chowmeined	blue screens are a fatal error, obviously not the same thing at all
2007-10-20T15:39:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	except, you can design a system that never crashes
2007-10-20T15:39:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	not the fatal kernel error kind at least
2007-10-20T15:39:00.000Z	chowmeined	nesoi	so why not just do it?
