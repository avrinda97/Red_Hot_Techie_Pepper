2006-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	logankoester		I'll assume he meant mysql
2006-10-18T06:24:00.000Z	logankoester		but that would probably explain my problem :-D
2006-10-18T06:26:00.000Z	logankoester		If I run an application with like "kate &" and the konsole I used freezes, is it safe to kill that konsole?
2006-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	TLE	logankoester	yes
2006-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	logankoester	TLE	that won't kill kate right?
2006-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	TLE	logankoester	yes
2006-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	logankoester		alright, if I suddenly quit you'll know you're wrong....:p
2006-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	TLE	logankoester	it will kill kate
2006-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	logankoester	TLE	too late! fortunately the only thing I had runnig from it was kopete
2006-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	logankoester	TLE	is there a solution to that problem?
2006-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	logankoester	TLE	It seems kinda lame to leave frozen terminals all over the place
2006-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	TLE	logankoester	threads in Linux are forked from where they are started, I thought you meant that Kate was crashing dreezing the terminal, my bad. But anyway it shure as he.. shouldnt freeze
2006-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	logankoester	TLE	Well, one did :-/
2006-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	TLE		shouldn't *
2006-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	logankoester	TLE	Is there a better way?
2006-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	TLE	logankoester	otherwise start it from the menu. It's just wierd
2006-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	logankoester		:( alright
2006-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	logankoester		I don't like the menu, using the mouse is slow
2006-10-18T06:32:00.000Z	TLE	logankoester	I think you should try and investigate because no applications should freeze the terminal if you trail it with a & but I don't know enough to help you troubleshoot it
