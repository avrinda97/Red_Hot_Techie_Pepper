2007-05-22T11:07:00.000Z	jburd		I have a problem with Ubuntu Feisty fawn freshly installed on a pentium 4 system.  I see the startup splash screen and for a split second the busy mouse pointer, but after that there is no display.  Any help is appreciated.  :-)
2007-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	jburd		It should alos be noted that display was visible earlier.
2007-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	flac	jburd	which video card ? no errors ? does it return to console or just crash ?
2007-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	jburd		it doesn't crash. it shows me a blank screen.
2007-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	jburd		the video card is an intel 845GV built in.
2007-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	jburd		no errors
2007-05-22T11:09:00.000Z	jburd		i should tell you i enabled "accessible login" in gdm-setup before this happened.
2007-05-22T11:09:00.000Z	jburd		and a different greeter that presents a user list.
2007-05-22T11:10:00.000Z	jburd	flac	What could be the problem?
2007-05-22T11:10:00.000Z	flac	jburd	I really don't know ...
2007-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	flac	jburd	try to look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	jburd		all right.
2007-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	jburd		just a second.
2007-05-22T11:12:00.000Z	jburd	flac	nothing suspicious.
2007-05-22T11:12:00.000Z	flac	jburd	really strange ... I don't know what could have happen
2007-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	jburd		can i somehow end the gdm process and restart it in safe mode or something?
2007-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	jburd		because i don't think X is the problem.
2007-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	jburd		the display goes blank after an initial flicker of the mouse pointer.
2007-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	flac	jburd	you can start in safemode ( = single-user mode) directly in console
