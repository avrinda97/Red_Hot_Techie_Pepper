2010-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	mostholy		or even a hint?
2010-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	mostholy		i was told one of the main advantages of linux is that the community is way more freindly
2010-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	mostholy		i just need to know how to access my other partition
2010-09-02T13:44:00.000Z	mostholy		well i have to be able to see it to mount it
2010-09-02T13:44:00.000Z	mostholy		i could do that from the live cd but couldnt access the files in my home folder
2010-09-02T13:44:00.000Z	mostholy		i gave this account privilege to access the other partition but can't find it anywhere
2010-09-02T13:45:00.000Z	mostholy		i am root
2010-09-02T13:45:00.000Z	mostholy		or i'm using the terminal as sudo root anyway
2010-09-02T13:45:00.000Z	mostholy		but i don't know enough to get in from the command line
2010-09-02T13:45:00.000Z	mostholy		sigh
2010-09-02T13:46:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	partitions are named /dev/hdxx
2010-09-02T13:48:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	I think you should just inspect the contents of /etc/fstab, it's probably there
2010-09-02T13:52:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	cat /etc/fstab
2010-09-02T13:57:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	what are you trying to do exactly?
2010-09-02T13:59:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	try this: mkdir /mnt/sdaX; mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/sdaX
2010-09-02T14:06:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	man, are you even listening? :(
2010-09-02T14:33:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	can you do: fdisk -l /dev/sda
2010-09-02T14:37:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	then, ls /mnt/sda1
2010-09-02T14:46:00.000Z	jb__	mostholy	your data is there, you just mounted it
