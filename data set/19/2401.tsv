2010-04-17T15:33:00.000Z	akssps011		I want to install a package at location other than /usr. How can I do this using make install ?
2010-04-17T15:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akssps011	 with  compilidn source theres options you tive to ./configure to tell it where to go to. the 'PREFIX=' option i recall
2010-04-17T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akssps011	 you are in the wrong dir.
2010-04-17T15:38:00.000Z	akssps011	Dr_Willis	there's no directory called configure in it. I was compilig marble
2010-04-17T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akssps011	 no idea what that is.. could be its not using the normal source/tools.
2010-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	akssps011	Dr_Willis	What I know is that we can change the installation path for it during make install. Any idea ?
2010-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akssps011	 'during install' is different then compiling and instlling from source. I dont know what/how that app works
2010-04-17T15:42:00.000Z	akssps011	Dr_Willis	OK. I was asking for the syntax of make install for specifying the destination path. I tried make DESTDIR=/usr/abc install. But the executable isn't detected.
2010-04-17T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akssps011	 make install - normally dosent take an alternative path to put things in.
2010-04-17T15:44:00.000Z	akssps011	Dr_Willis	then can we specify it with make ?
2010-04-17T15:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akssps011	 its normally done via ./configure options. If they are not uising a ./confgure script they may have other config scripts
2010-04-17T15:45:00.000Z	akssps011	Dr_Willis	OK thanks
