2011-08-14T13:59:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	type the command that you posted at the command line
2011-08-14T14:00:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	it'll ask you for your password, list  a bunch of dependencies.  You should answer Y and let it do its thing.

2011-08-14T14:09:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	maybe it was removed from 11.04.  I'm still on 10.04 LTS
2011-08-14T14:11:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	I just looks on pkgs.org and it seems to have been removed after 10.10
2011-08-14T14:14:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	maybe you can find a package somewhere else.  Or you could use free pascal
2011-08-14T14:14:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	that seems to be available on 11.04
2011-08-14T14:14:00.000Z	Sazhen86	fatih	sudo apt-get install fp-compiler
