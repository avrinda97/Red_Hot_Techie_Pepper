2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	Bits		why move to 8.04 at all? gutsy seems fine.....
2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	gutsy is awesome.
2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	how so, in a nutshell?
2008-05-04T23:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	mostly in the area of hardware detection..
2008-05-04T23:10:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	have it installed on vbox and not that impressed, all considering
2008-05-04T23:10:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	aha, that would explain it ;)
2008-05-04T23:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	if your hardware is detected well under Gutsy, you won't see much difference, just updated software.
2008-05-04T23:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	but people w/ broadcom wireless devices, several newer atheros devices, etc, will tell yhou hardy is better
2008-05-04T23:11:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	i'm a relatively new linux user, and 1 thing i've learned so far is: if it works, don't fix it.
2008-05-04T23:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	eh, thats just opinion, i like hosing thinsg and fixing it..lol
2008-05-04T23:11:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	i pity your wasted time ;)
2008-05-04T23:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	its not bad really, i rarely have issues, every so often, i had problems w/ gutsy.. wireless, and intel sound device, which all works perfect under hardy.
2008-05-04T23:13:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	only issue i've had so far is an unkillable flickering on nvidia when compiz is activated (remains even after uninstall of compiz)
2008-05-04T23:13:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	err not compiz but the settings manager
2008-05-04T23:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	i've heard that issue before.. ive never had it,.. but i've heard about it, i've never had a problem w/ my nvidia devices, since edgy
2008-05-04T23:14:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	that's the only (petty) reason i'd have to upgrade at the moment
2008-05-04T23:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bits	see, and thast another thing, i never upgrade, always clean install, i've read enough horror stories here about "Upgrades Gone Wild"
2008-05-04T23:15:00.000Z	Bits	IndyGunFreak	thanks for tip 8)
