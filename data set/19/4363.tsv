2009-05-29T07:12:00.000Z	aaditya		yep
2009-05-29T07:12:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	nice one...
2009-06-01T02:28:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	interesting philosophy. In my opinion, upgrading to 9.04 causes more problems than it solves
2009-06-01T02:29:00.000Z	aaditya	losher	didn't create problems for me. what problems anyways?
2009-06-01T02:29:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	sounds, flash, sluggishness, ext4 corruptions, intel incompatibilities, I may have missed a few...
2009-06-01T02:30:00.000Z	aaditya	losher	ext4 is optional. intel incompatibilities can be overridden, sound and flash worked for me without any issue
2009-06-01T02:32:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	not everyone has been so lucky. I've been watching the fallout on this channel since 9.04 came out.
2009-06-01T02:32:00.000Z	aaditya	losher	i agree
2009-06-01T02:40:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	why?
2009-06-01T02:41:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	oh, right...

2009-06-01T02:44:00.000Z	aaditya	losher	haha nice. the Ubuntu developers must be having a good time there
2009-06-01T02:45:00.000Z	losher	aaditya	not sure which is cause & which is effect....
2009-06-01T02:45:00.000Z	aaditya	losher	lol right
