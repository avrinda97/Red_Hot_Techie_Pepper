2011-04-15T19:27:00.000Z	fisix		why does eth0 get a different mac address when i unplug/replug the ethernet cord?
2011-04-15T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	huh? a different ip? MAC adresses are attached to the hardware and shouldn't change
2011-04-15T19:30:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	i know. but it does. from  aa:00:04:00:0a:04  to 00:16:d4:e1:bd:56
2011-04-15T19:31:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	trying to set up a static ip but i only have one of those forwarded
2011-04-15T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	maybe "dmesg" gives some hints on how and why it is happenning ?
2011-04-15T19:32:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	not to me.. haha
2011-04-15T19:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	do an unplug plug cycle  and do « dmesg | tail -n30 » paste that in a pastebin
2011-04-15T19:36:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	http://paste.ubuntu.com/594494/
2011-04-15T19:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	what about « tail -n30 /var/log/syslog » ?
2011-04-15T19:37:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	meganerd translating the mac addresses shows Vendor =  Digital Equipment Corporation, but  Compal Communications after unplug/replug

2011-04-15T19:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	what about /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules ? what does the file says?
2011-04-15T19:42:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	meganerd http://paste.ubuntu.com/594500/
2011-04-15T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	ATTR{address}=="00:16:d4:e1:bd:56" <<< that looks like the ral adress....
2011-04-15T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	appears in the syslog too
2011-04-15T19:43:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	right. that's the one ive assigned to the static ip
2011-04-15T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	dunno where the other comes from
2011-04-15T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	fisix	maybe is nteworkmanager? what is the eth0 conf in NM ?
2011-04-15T19:44:00.000Z	fisix	erUSUL	meganerd that's the ip that shows up in ifconfig after unplug/replug. but booting with ethernet cord in will give an ifconfig mac of aa:00:04:00:0a:04
