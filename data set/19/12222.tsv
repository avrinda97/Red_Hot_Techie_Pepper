2008-05-30T00:18:00.000Z	dan__		sweet it worked
2008-05-30T00:18:00.000Z	dan__		i need help wit doing this: http://redhatcat.blogspot.com/2007/09/beating-sandvine-with-linux-iptables.html
2008-05-30T00:19:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	have you created the file as they suggest?
2008-05-30T00:19:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	I know nothing about sandvine, but the instructions seem straightforward
2008-05-30T00:20:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	what exactly is the problem?
2008-05-30T00:21:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	when you do what exactly?
2008-05-30T00:22:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	did you notice that it says "place the following in a file"?
2008-05-30T00:23:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	no
2008-05-30T00:24:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	just copy the red stuff into a gedit window and save the file on your desktop under the name 'iptables-fix'
2008-05-30T00:24:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	gedit is Applications-Accessories-Text Editor
2008-05-30T00:25:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	then open a terminal and run 'sudo $HOME/Desktop/iptables-fix'
2008-05-30T00:30:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	then you haven't done what I said, which was to save the file to your Desktop under the name of iptables-fix
2008-05-30T00:31:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	once you've done that, it will say 'Permission denied' when you try to run it, so you will have to do a 'chmod +x /home/luke/Desktop/iptables-fix'
2008-05-30T00:34:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	did it report any errors?
2008-05-30T00:35:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	that means it has worked. You can 'sudo iptables -L' to get a list of your current rules
2008-05-30T00:36:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	do not paste stuff into the channel
2008-05-30T00:37:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	did you actually run 'sudo /home/luke/Desktop/iptables-fix'?
2008-05-30T00:39:00.000Z	soundray	dan__	now check your speed or whatever you were trying to fix.
