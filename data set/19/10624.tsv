2009-06-18T22:30:00.000Z	fuffalo		My firefox won't start because I "have another instance running already", and when i do sudo kill XXXXX, it accepts the command but doesn't actually kill firefox...any ideas?
2009-06-18T22:31:00.000Z	fuffalo		did that, it's still running =/
2009-06-18T22:33:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	firefox uses a lock file, which sometimes sticks around if the browser crashes. look for it in your .mozilla/firefox/<profileid> directory. remove it and try again.
2009-06-18T22:34:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	or have you verified that a firefox process is actually running? (the error message is not proof that another firefox process is actually running)
2009-06-18T22:34:00.000Z	fuffalo	sipior	i'm dong ps -efa | grep firefox, and it seems to be running with the id 27689
2009-06-18T22:35:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	what's the process status from ps?
2009-06-18T22:35:00.000Z	fuffalo	sipior	is that the column after the pid?
2009-06-18T22:36:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	no, just give the whole line, please.
2009-06-18T22:37:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	can you try "ps auxww | grep firefox"?
2009-06-18T22:38:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	hmm...uninterruptible. is there are a lot of hard drive activity at the moment?
2009-06-18T22:43:00.000Z	fuffalo	sipior	anything else I can try?  Or do I need to reboot?
2009-06-18T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	if you set the variable MOZ_NO_REMOTE via "export MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1", and then start firefox from the terminal, does it allow you to choose a profile?
2009-06-18T22:46:00.000Z	fuffalo	sipior	I typed "export MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1" then "firefox" and I'm getting the same existing firefox error as before
2009-06-18T22:47:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	and you said you had moved the profile directory under .mozilla?
2009-06-18T22:48:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	and if you move that file elsewhere?
2009-06-18T22:48:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	i hate to suggest a reboot, but that would probably be the quickest solution under the circumstances
2009-06-18T22:48:00.000Z	fuffalo	sipior	I appreciate all your help, I've got a lunch meeting I have to run to - I'll be back in an hour or so to try and get this...Thanks for your time though
2009-06-18T22:49:00.000Z	fuffalo	sipior	Thanks again :)
2009-06-18T22:49:00.000Z	sipior	fuffalo	yep, no worries
