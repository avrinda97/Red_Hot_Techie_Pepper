2011-05-05T21:13:00.000Z	multipass|2		Hi, does anyone know why for IPHONE, in 10.10 i can only view the photos, but in 11.04 i can mount as root and get full acess to everything including music?? What am i missing in 10.10 (im still using 10.10 for a few reasons)
2011-05-05T21:13:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	because they worked on support
2011-05-05T21:14:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	but are there any specific packages i can bring to 10.10 to make it work
2011-05-05T21:15:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	I dont know offhand, I looked into this because I noticed the same but I hate the bloat 11.04. Cant pin it down to a simple package myself yet though
2011-05-05T21:15:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	yeah for a few reaons, mainly compiz, i cannot use 11.04, its just too much of a pain :\
2011-05-05T21:16:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	i noticed that in 11.04 there is libimobiledevice2, and in 10.10 theres libimobiledevice1
2011-05-05T21:16:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	so i assumed thats the difference
2011-05-05T21:16:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	linux is filled with things that work and dont work, tempting you to resort back to windows. I have to for my ipodtouch.
2011-05-05T21:17:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	right, i use virtualbox xp for iphone, but now with 11.04 everything iphone was working great
2011-05-05T21:20:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	from the package page, it seems that libmobiledevice is the source, but can 10.10 repositories give you 2
2011-05-05T21:23:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	ive been trying to get libimobiledevice2 on 10.10 but no luck yet
2011-05-05T21:27:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	but what does dist upgrade do
2011-05-05T21:28:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, wont that make it 11.04
2011-05-05T21:29:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	apparently
2011-05-05T21:30:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	Hey, i think that worked actually.. waoh
2011-05-05T21:30:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	thanks!
2011-05-05T21:30:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	thank google ;)
2011-05-05T21:31:00.000Z	multipass|2	jamiewhite	actually i did see that distupgrade thing before, but it was scary :O
2011-05-05T21:32:00.000Z	jamiewhite	multipass|2	I could see why. Everytime I open the updat manager and see the upgrade button i cower
