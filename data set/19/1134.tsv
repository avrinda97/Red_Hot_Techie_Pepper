2011-04-29T20:52:00.000Z	areay		just upgraded to natty, but i have no unity -- my desktop hasn't changed at all
2011-04-29T20:52:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	try intalling it with sudo apt-get install unity
2011-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	another option is ckeck if unity is activated on compiz settings
2011-04-29T20:58:00.000Z	areay	elxordi	i don't appear to have a unity plugin in compiz. is there a package for that?
2011-04-29T20:59:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	yeah, but is dependency with unity package, so if it's installed, the option must be on compiz settings
2011-04-29T21:01:00.000Z	areay	elxordi	unity is installed, but searching for 'unity' in compizconfig returns no results
2011-04-29T21:02:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	wait, please, i'll check
2011-04-29T21:06:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	i couldn't find the package to fix that. If it can help, i have it under the Desktop section on compiz settings manager
2011-04-29T21:06:00.000Z	areay	elxordi	nope, it's not in there :(
2011-04-29T21:07:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	maybe some package is missing. i'll give you a list of unity packages that i have installed, wait please
2011-04-29T21:08:00.000Z	areay	elxordi	it seems that's not my only problem. my sources.list is for maverick even though i've never had maverick installed. i upgraded from lucid to natty
2011-04-29T21:10:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	:S people recommend to update to next inmediate version.... would you like my sources.list?
2011-04-29T21:10:00.000Z	areay	elxordi	yes please, ty
2011-04-29T21:10:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	wait ;)

2011-04-29T21:12:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	tell me if it works for you ;)
2011-04-29T21:13:00.000Z	elxordi	areay	also, try with "update-manager -d" on the terminal before. let's see if it offers you the possibility to update
2011-04-29T21:14:00.000Z	areay	elxordi	it seems that update-manager is working. i'm gonna let it finish. ty for your help:)
