2012-07-12T12:08:00.000Z	qubits		I think it was encrypted. There are commands to list volumes right
2012-07-12T12:08:00.000Z	qubits		dmadm?
2012-07-12T12:08:00.000Z	qubits		i dont see dmadm on my pc
2012-07-12T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	there is no such thing as dmadm
2012-07-12T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	have you installed mdadm ?
2012-07-12T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	sorry, you're not making sense
2012-07-12T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	did you setup the raid with dmraid or mdadm ?
2012-07-12T12:11:00.000Z	qubits	ikonia	just check it out, it should be obvious what was used
2012-07-12T12:12:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	no
2012-07-12T12:12:00.000Z	qubits	ikonia	try to be a little more intuitive than the rest of these blokes around here who are so self absorbed theyre unwilling to help or learn something new once in a while
2012-07-12T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	sorry, please don't tell me what to do, I'm actually quite intrusive and will probe for information
2012-07-12T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	and calling others self absorbed won't get you help from other people
2012-07-12T12:14:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	security has nothing to do with what you are saying
2012-07-12T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	sorry, I thought you where asking about recovering a raid array, I have no idea why you are referencing security
2012-07-12T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	no, you asked me to be intrusive, I said I am intrusive meaning when finding out issues to resolve a problem.
2012-07-12T12:16:00.000Z	qubits	ikonia	your reading confused us both, I didn't use that word, go re-read the message
2012-07-12T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	no
2012-07-12T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	I've explained why.
2012-07-12T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	qubits	I'm doing other things now
