2008-01-09T22:56:00.000Z	kurei		hi, i'm having troubles with my sounds... can someone help me out? :)
2008-01-09T22:58:00.000Z	kurei		can anyone please help me out fix my sound setup? :)
2008-01-09T22:58:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	whats the issue?
2008-01-09T22:59:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	i have a speaker icon on the upper side of my screen. it is enabled but i have no sound at all even during startup
2008-01-09T23:00:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	does your hardware work, your speakers or headset ?
2008-01-09T23:01:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	but i prefer using ubuntu and use vista only for gaming
2008-01-09T23:01:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	so your volume appears to be just fine ? (on both the speaker and in the software )
2008-01-09T23:01:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	yes the volume is set to max
2008-01-09T23:02:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	what application are you using to play sound ?
2008-01-09T23:02:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	i'm using vlc
2008-01-09T23:02:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	you will (possibly) need to setup which audio device VLC is using
2008-01-09T23:03:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	this only occured after receiving my notebook from the service center. they had the motherboard replaced
2008-01-09T23:04:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	what do you suggest i should do?
2008-01-09T23:04:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	setup the device to be used in VLC
2008-01-09T23:06:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	i dont think vlc is the issue... i do not even have sounds on startup
2008-01-09T23:06:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	well, based on the fact that you had a hardware change, you will want to update the drivers for those devices, if I am not mistaken
2008-01-09T23:07:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	how do i know my hardware and the right drivers for it?
2008-01-09T23:07:00.000Z	neverblue	kurei	thats something I cannot assist you with, good luck
2008-01-09T23:07:00.000Z	kurei	neverblue	thanks though :)
