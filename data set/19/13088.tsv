2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	r0bnyc	nalioth	enableing hoary universe and hoary-security universe lines?
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	once you are in the file, you can univers the world
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	recommend you multiverse it, too
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	r0bnyc	nalioth	universe the world ?
2005-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	add the universe and multiverse repos to your lines
2005-06-25T08:09:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	and enjoy many more toyz

2005-06-25T08:10:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	security lines need not be touched
2005-06-25T08:10:00.000Z	r0bnyc	nalioth	why not , hoary is released already
2005-06-25T08:10:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	ok, i meant, don't add universe and multiverse to the security lines
2005-06-25T08:11:00.000Z	r0bnyc	nalioth	i knw :)
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	breezy is broken
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	breezy is for "extreme OS enthusiasts"
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z	nalioth	r0bnyc	breezy is far from "ready for every day use"
