2004-11-15T15:38:00.000Z	aratdagnir		i've just compiled MPlayer,  but video doesnt show
2004-11-15T15:38:00.000Z	aratdagnir		any suggestions?
2004-11-15T15:38:00.000Z	aratdagnir		is there a problem with XFree drivers?
2004-11-15T15:39:00.000Z	aratdagnir		no video works, even with totem or gstreamer whatever
2004-11-15T15:40:00.000Z	aratdagnir		do you know any repositories i may add to apt?
2004-11-15T15:40:00.000Z	aratdagnir		where i can find a compiled mplayer
2004-11-15T15:40:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	what format are the videos which you are trying to play?
2004-11-15T15:41:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	ah yes it is better to install compiled packages
2004-11-15T15:41:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	for that you need the divx codecs
2004-11-15T15:41:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	you need to add a couple of hidden repositories
2004-11-15T15:42:00.000Z	aratdagnir	Matt|	can you please tell me those :)
2004-11-15T15:43:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	add this to the end of that file:
2004-11-15T15:43:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	the divx codecs are in the win32codecs package or something
2004-11-15T15:44:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	after changing the sources.list file you need to run "apt-get update"
2004-11-15T15:45:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	sorry mplayer-586
2004-11-15T15:47:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	what failed?
2004-11-15T15:48:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	works here
2004-11-15T15:54:00.000Z	Matt|	aratdagnir	it should be working
