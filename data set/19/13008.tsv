2005-06-29T14:52:00.000Z	fetman		playing ._Quack.wav
2005-06-29T14:52:00.000Z	fetman		sox: Failed reading ._Quack.wav: WAVE: RIFF header not found
2005-06-29T14:52:00.000Z	fetman		what up with that?
2005-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	files that begin with ._ are resource forks iirc
2005-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	ie. not the real file
2005-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	well, mhm
2005-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	well, I downloaded this: http://sagefire.org/C1009907506/E1311212715/ .. seems like it should be the real ting?
2005-06-29T15:00:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	hmm, doesn't that zipfile have sound files whose names don't begin with ._ ?
2005-06-29T15:00:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	hmm?? where?
2005-06-29T15:01:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	wav-files you mean?
2005-06-29T15:01:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	i didn't d/l the zip.. yes, wav files.
2005-06-29T15:01:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	well.. no.. not that I can see..
2005-06-29T15:04:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	i can see them (i dont understand why the author of that file chose to include the resource forks in the 1st place)
2005-06-29T15:05:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	everything under __MACOSX is basically b/s imo
2005-06-29T15:05:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	what's b/s?
2005-06-29T15:06:00.000Z	pfp	fetman	bullsh*t :)
2005-06-29T15:06:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	hehe
2005-06-29T15:07:00.000Z	fetman	pfp	author must be some cunt :(
