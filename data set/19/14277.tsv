2004-10-03T15:13:00.000Z	jmhodges		uh.. hunh
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	jmhodges		totem-gstreamer and totem-xine both are not working on mpeg files
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	jmhodges		t-g displays just a black vid scren
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	jmhodges		t-x just a blue one
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	jmhodges		im assuming this is something stupid done on my part?
2004-10-03T15:15:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	I have this problem with one SVCD too. Another one works without problems
2004-10-03T15:15:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	hmm.. same thing happens on all vid files so far
2004-10-03T15:16:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	SVCD is mpeg2. mpeg2 support should be included in totem-xine. for any other kind of codec you have to install these win32-codecs
2004-10-03T15:17:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	i assume i need to do some configuring outside of simply unpacking that w32codecs tarball in /usr/lib ?
2004-10-03T15:26:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	libdvdcss2 and w32codecs
2004-10-03T15:28:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	can you tell me if it works for you. I will try it again with that package, then.
2004-10-03T15:32:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	that did it, but you need totem-xine installed (i think, i havent tried totem-gstreamer)
2004-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	ok. i use t-xine, too. for gstreamer are bugs reports in bugzilla. so it might not work.
2004-10-03T15:43:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	do you know the full package name of these codecs?
2004-10-03T15:43:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	w32codecs and libdvdcss2 (iirc)
2004-10-03T15:44:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	yep, thats right
2004-10-03T15:44:00.000Z	Capri	jmhodges	which deb source have you used?
2004-10-03T15:44:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	oh, one sec
2004-10-03T15:44:00.000Z	jmhodges	Capri	ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main
