2008-06-24T01:20:00.000Z	abe3k		hi guys
2008-06-24T01:21:00.000Z	abe3k		how can I format a usb hard drive to make it ntfs under ubuntu ?
2008-06-24T01:21:00.000Z	abe3k		gparted you mean ?
2008-06-24T01:23:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	anything except fat?
2008-06-24T01:24:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	if you mean the size constraint, at least...
2008-06-24T01:24:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	thats cuz fat is stupid and old
2008-06-24T01:24:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	only supports 2g or so, why dont you use a real filesystem like ezt3?
2008-06-24T01:25:00.000Z	abe3k	giantmidget	. cuz its my friends hard drive and he has a windows os
2008-06-24T01:25:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	i see. then ntfs is the only way i guess
2008-06-24T01:25:00.000Z	abe3k	giantmidget	. problem is that ntfs is grayd out in gparted
2008-06-24T01:26:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	do you have the driver for it (ntfs-3g i think its called)?
2008-06-24T01:26:00.000Z	abe3k	giantmidget	. is there a specific package for that ?
2008-06-24T01:26:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	you should google up ubuntu ntfs support
2008-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	abe3k	giantmidget	. oh and one more question, can I partition a usb harddrive ?
2008-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	your machine can only handle filesystems it has the driver for...
2008-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	abe3k	giantmidget	. it handels ntfs well , I have hardy
2008-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	no idea, hope someone else knows
2008-06-24T01:28:00.000Z	giantmidget	abe3k	ntfs support under linux is not best though, can you use windows tools instead? i know theres one that even supports on-the-flt splitting and so...
2008-06-24T01:45:00.000Z	abe3k	giantmidget	I tried dosfsk but it found no errors
