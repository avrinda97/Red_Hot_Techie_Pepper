2007-09-04T13:43:00.000Z	Steve^		Any ideas why my ubuntu won't get assigned an IP until I run vista to get one and run ubuntu again?
2007-09-04T13:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	what type of connection?
2007-09-04T13:44:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	ethernet, to BT Homehub
2007-09-04T13:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	I have a homehub and it works perfectly
2007-09-04T13:44:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	it used to for me too, until 2 days ago
2007-09-04T13:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	are you using the network manager applet in the notification area?
2007-09-04T13:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	pastebin the output of "cat /etc/network/interfaces" please
2007-09-04T13:46:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	http://pastebin.com/m3232a1da
2007-09-04T13:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	copy lines 1 and 2, underneath, then replace "lo" in each of them with "eth0".
2007-09-04T13:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	finally, "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" or reboot etc. and it "should" work
2007-09-04T13:48:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	well, it works right now
2007-09-04T13:48:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	care to explain what the problem was?
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	well the default ethernet card interface (which i assume is the one you're using) isn't listed in the file that lists what is brought up on boot.
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	so why did it work before and why infact would it ever work?
2007-09-04T13:50:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	pebkac
2007-09-04T13:50:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	the things that could have broken it are the inclusion of an Xbox 360 to the network and my housemate doing some bt talk talk thing.    pebkac?
2007-09-04T13:50:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	"problem exists between keyboard and computer" - ie you must have broken it through your actions incuding sudo/gksudo.
2007-09-04T13:51:00.000Z	Steve^	PriceChild	hmm, ok. Oddly enough my dodgy wireless on my laptop has been fine the entire time
2007-09-04T13:51:00.000Z	PriceChild	Steve^	that's still listed in the interfaces file ;)
