2010-02-23T12:50:00.000Z	tiger_	theadmin	or where should i look at?
2010-02-23T12:51:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	Try to find in Synaptic, I can't remember all of that

2010-02-24T16:34:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	I know of one too, Netbeans (it's not only for C/CPP, but there is also Java, PHP, some other stuff)
2010-02-24T16:38:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	Well, only tried second one, I actually am not much of a developer, sorry
2010-02-24T16:54:00.000Z	tiger_	theadmin	I just use ubuntu for days. sometimes it just crashed when compiling or browsing web. do you know any reason?
2010-02-24T16:55:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	Who knows? Happens to me sometimes too.
2010-02-24T16:55:00.000Z	tiger_	theadmin	seems this is worse than Windows
2010-02-24T16:56:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	Well, if you'd know how much errors i had on that...
2010-02-24T16:57:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	Well, it's something like a BSoD, happens sometimes (rarely), and reason is heck knows what
2010-02-24T18:14:00.000Z	tiger_	theadmin	is there a way to turn off the animated window close-off?
2010-02-24T18:14:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	Uh, compiz settings
2010-02-24T18:15:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	System - Preferences - Appearance - Desktop Effects
2010-02-24T18:21:00.000Z	tiger_	theadmin	thanks. i turned effect off. but it is somewhat ugly slowly. not faster or smoother
2010-02-24T18:22:00.000Z	tiger_	theadmin	i felt ubuntu is bit slower than Windows, not that responsive. is something wrong with my setting?
2010-02-24T18:23:00.000Z	theadmin	tiger_	No idea.
