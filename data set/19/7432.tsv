2008-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	koolranch		Hi everyone, I could use some help downloading files to Ubuntu
2008-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	koolranch		would anyone be willing to help me out?
2008-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	what sort of files?
2008-07-10T06:45:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	to install Java, just run the command < sudo aptitude install sun-java6-plugin
2008-07-10T06:46:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	I've just answered the question "how do I install java" quite a lot :)
2008-07-10T06:46:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	no, the package manager will download the package and install it for you.
2008-07-10T06:46:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	the command aptitude is just another way of accessing the package manager, just like Synaptic or Add/Remove
2008-07-10T06:47:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	Well, it might, and if not, we'll have to enable something, and it will. Just try it :)
2008-07-10T06:47:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	Do you know how to get to the Terminal to enter commands?
2008-07-10T06:49:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	No problem.
2008-07-10T06:50:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	As for the eMusic download manager, it looks like I have to sign up first in order to see the client to download, so I can't really help you with that... you might want to try googling for it.
2008-07-10T06:50:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	where are you downloading them from?
2008-07-10T06:51:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	it seems like you might need some sort of plugin in that case... I'm really not familiar with eMusic, though.
2008-07-10T07:09:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	that command is only for installing packages from the Ubuntu software repositories. To install a file like a .bin file, run < sudo sh Desktop/whatever-it's-called.bin >
2008-07-10T07:13:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	can you paste the error to http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org and send me the URL?
2008-07-10T07:14:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	to copy text from the Terminal, use ctrl-shift-C
2008-07-10T07:16:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	hmm, that pastebin is gone, hold on a sec
2008-07-10T07:16:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	there, follow ubottu's link
2008-07-10T07:18:00.000Z	cdm10	koolranch	that's weird, it looks like there's a problem with the download... try this: sudo chmod +x Desktop/emusicdlm-linux-installer.bin && Desktopï»¿/emusicdlm-linux-installer.bin
