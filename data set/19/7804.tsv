2007-08-21T10:34:00.000Z	Dunas		Is 960MB of RAM and a 69.2GB Hard disk enough to dualboot Ubuntu and WinXP on this laptop? :x
2007-08-21T10:34:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	Plenty.
2007-08-22T07:14:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	What module are you trying to blacklist?
2007-08-22T08:46:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Was that a spaceballs reference or just wishful thinking on my part?
2007-08-22T08:46:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	It was indeed :)
2007-08-22T08:46:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Awesome. XD
2007-08-22T09:56:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	google for pastebin, there are alot.
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	Looks okay to me.  I'd check out the README and INSTALL files to make sure that you are doing it correctly.
2007-08-22T10:03:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Thanks, I will. I just got worried when I saw the string of WARNING's.
2007-08-22T11:45:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	Probably where you donwloaded the package
2007-08-22T11:45:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	Did you look on the ubuntu forums for someone who has done this before, perhaps theres a how-to
2007-08-22T11:45:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Following a how-to from http://rtl-wifi.sourceforge.net/wiki/Installing
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	ctrl-alt-backspace doesnt log you out.
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Oh. Well, then, I might as well just logout.
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	well, it does, but its much safer to actually logout.
2007-08-22T12:12:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Alright. I still, though, need to get it where it'll automatically load that module.
2007-08-22T12:13:00.000Z	Pici	Dunas	I personally think a reboot is needed to test that.
2007-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	I've been trying to have patience, but around 15 minutes with not so much as a "dunno" and watching everyone else getting helped on other things is straining. ><
2007-08-24T10:03:00.000Z	Dunas	Pici	Thanks.
