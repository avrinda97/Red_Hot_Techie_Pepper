2005-06-12T13:29:00.000Z	pepsi		how can i convert an .mp3 to a .wav?
2005-06-12T13:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	i would try mpg321
2005-10-10T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	make 'sudo MAKEDEV parport' ?
2005-10-10T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	that is, maybe 'sudo MAKEDEV parport'
2005-10-10T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	in /dev
2005-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	pepsi	HappyFool	will that survive a reboot?
2005-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	err, i don't know
2005-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	i haven't got my head around ubuntu's device creation
2005-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	if not, you can add 'MAKEDEV parport' in /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2005-10-10T13:13:00.000Z	pepsi	HappyFool	ok.. i might.. seems like every other time i update my system, the parport breaks
2005-10-10T13:14:00.000Z	pepsi	HappyFool	any idea how i can get my 4-port serial card to show up as ttyS2..ttyS5?.. right now it uses ttyS14, 15, 44, and 45
2005-10-10T13:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	um. you can use the 'mknod' command to make arbitrary filenames map to specific devices (devices are associated with major,minor number pairs)
2005-10-10T13:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	read 'man mknod' and maybe some of the linux kernel docs. i think the hotplug system might help you too ('man hotplug'), but i'm not sure
2005-10-10T13:17:00.000Z	pepsi	HappyFool	yeah, i have to figure something out.. every time i boot up i have to use setserial to setup the serial ports correctly and then make /dev/COM1..6 since the ttyS numbering is wierd
2005-10-10T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	youn can't you adapt your software to use the linux (or ubuntu) naming?
2005-10-10T13:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	yeah, fair enough
2005-10-10T13:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	why do you need so many com ports?
2005-10-10T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	cool. played with real-time linux at all?
2005-11-24T07:24:00.000Z	HappyFool	pepsi	packages.ubuntu.com
