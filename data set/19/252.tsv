2012-05-22T16:32:00.000Z	GNS3Talk		Gents, I upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04, and my Quad NIC cards don't work on the new version. From the drop down menu, I see 'Device Not Ready' message. Can anybody help why I'm receiving this message?
2012-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	did you try manual configuration instead of network manager?
2012-05-22T16:35:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	krababbel	I switched to Linux about two months ago. I know how to get things working, but not too sure what you mean. Could you please clarify?
2012-05-22T16:35:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	'ip' command is the current way to do it. save into /etc/network/interfaces for next boot.
2012-05-22T16:35:00.000Z	GNS3Talk		I will try that and get back to you.
2012-05-22T16:35:00.000Z	GNS3Talk		Thanks krababbel :)
2012-05-22T16:35:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	maybe network manager, which is in task bar, has problems. you can remove it in software center. then you need to configuer manually
2012-05-22T16:36:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	krababbel	 Possibly! But when I plug a network cable into the port, the OS doesn't identify it.
2012-05-22T16:37:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	you mean nm at the top doesn't see it?
2012-05-22T16:37:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	try it manually, maybe you don't even have to remove nm for a try, just don't use it. 'ip link' for instance should see all interfaces.
2012-05-22T16:38:00.000Z	krababbel		 GNS3Talk 'ip addr' shows adresses.
2012-05-22T16:38:00.000Z	krababbel		'ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0' adds an adress,
2012-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	GNS3Talk	krababbel	I will try that command to add the IP address setting manually via CLI.
2012-05-22T16:40:00.000Z	GNS3Talk		I'm back on 11.10 now, and I asked the question many times over the Ubuntu forum but no one bothered to reply :) Cheers krababbel
2012-05-22T16:40:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	also don't forget 'ip route' 'ip route add ...' and dns config then. for the next boot, you need interfaces file in /etc/network/ :)
2012-05-22T16:41:00.000Z	GNS3Talk		Yep thanks. I will study the 'ip' command and all the options it offers (DNS, Gateway, Subnet mask, etc)
2012-05-22T16:41:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	also dns entry is needed now in /etc/resolvconf/base, resolvconf package manages dns now
2012-05-22T16:41:00.000Z	krababbel		np
2012-05-22T16:41:00.000Z	krababbel	GNS3Talk	though in interfaces file there is a line for dns too, forgot that
