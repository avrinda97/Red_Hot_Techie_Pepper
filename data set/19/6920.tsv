2011-04-11T20:33:00.000Z	real_ate		hi all. is there any way to figure out what file was deleted from this dmesg output: EXT4-fs (sda9): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 1446701
2011-04-11T20:35:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	 Check the /lost+found folder at the root of this filesystem.
2011-04-11T20:35:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	empty
2011-04-11T20:36:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	Okay, then this probably isn't a problem unless you have obviously filesystem corruption elsewhere.
2011-04-11T20:37:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	well some files are defo missing... I have a svn folder that used to be fine before this but now "svn st" says that it is not a working copy
2011-04-11T20:37:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	umount the filesystem and force an offline check.
2011-04-11T20:37:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	but I was just trying to figure out what other files have been lost, there are 22 in total entries for  ext4_orphan_cleanup
2011-04-11T20:38:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	but it has already checked and fixed the "problem" by deleting the inodes... i just want to figure out what inodes it has deleted
2011-04-11T20:39:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	Did you write down the inode numbers?
2011-04-11T20:39:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	or more to the point, i want to know if it is possible to know what inodes have been deleted (i.e. what position in the file system ) from the id number
2011-04-11T20:39:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	yes i have them all in dmesg log
2011-04-11T20:40:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	Deep voodoo.  First, take the system offline and make a 1-to-1 copy of the disk.  Second, you'll need to read about the e2fs progs.
2011-04-11T20:42:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	do you mean e2fsck?
2011-04-11T20:42:00.000Z	real_ate		or are you talking about other tools ?
2011-04-11T20:42:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	After you have a raw copy of the broken filesystem,  poke some of the inodes using the debugfs program.
2011-04-11T20:42:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	This is not an easy fix.  Learning how to back out an inode problem will be hours of reading and learning.  Just restore from backup if you have a critical problem.
2011-04-11T20:43:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	you see that is the problem... everything is working fine! I have only noticed 2 problems with the file system, i.e. stuff missing, and i'm worried about *where* the other 22 missing inodes are from
2011-04-11T20:44:00.000Z	real_ate	dajhorn	i don't actually have a "critical probelm" i'm just "critically worried" ...
2011-04-11T20:44:00.000Z	dajhorn	real_ate	Then you answered your question...  Restore the system from backup.
