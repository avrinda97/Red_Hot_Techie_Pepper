2010-06-20T21:34:00.000Z	LucidGuy		I just noticed that my home directory had 755 for permissions.  Why would Ubuntu have that for default?  I changed to 750..  comments?
2010-06-20T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LucidGuy	maybe you or somone has been messing with chmod. I have mine as 600. Having some files in $HOME marked as executable may cause issues

2012-01-10T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LucidGuy	is the ram healthy?

2012-01-10T22:44:00.000Z	LucidGuy	ActionParsnip	I have a funny feeling its the CPU...
2012-01-10T22:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LucidGuy	what service(s) do(es) the server run?
2012-01-10T22:45:00.000Z	LucidGuy	ActionParsnip	I appreciate your interest in troubleshooting, but I simply need to know if there is a way to capture kernel panics
2012-01-10T22:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LucidGuy	try in /var/log/dmesg.0    I believe it is the dmesg from the previous boot
2012-01-10T22:46:00.000Z	LucidGuy	ActionParsnip	Looked around .. no luck.  I think I have to somehow mount a tty to a serial connection on another server.  This way I can scroll through the last kernel panic.
