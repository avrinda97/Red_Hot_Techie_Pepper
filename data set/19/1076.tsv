2011-05-20T21:21:00.000Z	twotenam		Make sure that where ever you're downloading that package from, make sure it still exsists on the remote server. also check to make sure the path name is correct
2011-05-20T21:21:00.000Z	twotenam		 actually
2011-05-20T21:22:00.000Z	twotenam		"libc6-amd64_2.13-0ubuntu13_i386.deb - Ubuntu 11.04 - Ubuntu Main" is that exactly what you're putting in your sources file?
2011-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	twotenam		it needs to just be "libc6-amd64_2.13-0ubuntu13_i386.deb" because "ubuntu 11.04" and "ubuntu main" aren't part of that file name, probably part of something else.
2011-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	newubuntist	twotenam	: i put the link in my sourceslist file
2011-05-20T21:24:00.000Z	newubuntist	twotenam	but in the source we are supposed to put the links? not the names of the librairies
2011-05-20T21:25:00.000Z	twotenam		newubuntists: i'm not sure about what sources.list is doing, but i know that if you're downloading a package from somewhere else besides your own computer, you need an absolute file name like "http://somelinuxplace.com/files/libc6-amd64_2.13-0ubuntu13_i386.deb"
2011-05-20T21:25:00.000Z	twotenam		an 'absolute link"
2011-05-20T21:27:00.000Z	newubuntist		<twotenam>: in this sources.list  file we find links this is why i don't knwo wht to put , coz when i added the corresponding mirror it didn't work
2011-05-20T21:29:00.000Z	twotenam	newubuntist	i assume that links are what you need. just based on what you typed in for the initial problem, that wasn't the right kind of link. not really sure from here.
2011-05-20T21:32:00.000Z	newubuntist		<twotenam>  here's the link  http://pkgs.org/package/libc6-amd64 , and i wanted to download the package corresponding to ubuntu .11.04 but it didn't work
2011-05-20T21:33:00.000Z	twotenam	newubuntist	so in your sources.list file, you should have put as an entry "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc6-amd64_2.13-0ubuntu13_i386.deb"
2011-05-20T21:34:00.000Z	twotenam	newubuntist	have you tried that? if not, try it.
2011-05-20T21:35:00.000Z	newubuntist		<twotenam> no ididn't try the same link tht u put, i tried an other one, let me try it and get back to you
2011-05-20T21:35:00.000Z	twotenam		what are these wierd user names joining?
2011-05-20T21:37:00.000Z	twotenam		wat
2011-05-20T21:46:00.000Z	newubuntist		<twotenam> it didn't work  here's the message i got : E: Type 'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc6-amd64_2.13-0ubuntu13_i386.deb' is not known on line 60 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list E: The list of sources could not be read.
2011-05-20T21:50:00.000Z	newubuntist		<twotenam> : this is the error message i had when i added the link you gave me to my souces.list  :      E: Type 'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc6-amd64_2.13-0ubuntu13_i386.deb' is not known on line 60 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list E: The list of sources could not be read.
