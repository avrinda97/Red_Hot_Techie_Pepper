2005-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	andy_		but why is it dropping?
2005-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	andy_		i've never experienced this before
2005-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	andy_		with any other operating system
2005-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	andy_		i dont understand why the connection link goes "down"
2005-09-17T14:41:00.000Z	andy_		and my ethernet just turns off completely
2005-09-17T14:41:00.000Z	andy_		and then turns back on again
2005-09-17T14:42:00.000Z	andy_		i'd love to know why mine does it.. its so annoying almost annoying as my mouse that isnt working.. (trackpad)
2005-09-17T14:43:00.000Z	andy_		would it make a difference if i changed it from DHCP to StaticIP?
2005-09-17T14:44:00.000Z	andy_		guys come on.. as if nobody has any idea why my network connection keeps dropping
2005-09-17T14:45:00.000Z	andy_		:S
2005-09-17T14:45:00.000Z	odd_	andy_	: it could be an IP conflict with the cable net, it would keep sending resets to your modem
2005-09-17T14:48:00.000Z	andy_	odd_	 if it does have something to do with the IPS and it keeps resetting do you have any idea how i can fix this?
2005-09-17T14:50:00.000Z	odd_	andy_	: can you run your cable direct to the pc bypassing the hub and see if the problem stops?
2005-09-17T14:50:00.000Z	andy_	odd_	ill try i tnow
2005-09-17T14:58:00.000Z	odd_	andy_	: good show
2005-09-17T15:07:00.000Z	odd_	andy_	: do a search for touchpad useing description+name there a several listed under that
2005-09-17T15:07:00.000Z	andy_	odd_	do you mean in the synaptics package manager?
2005-09-17T15:08:00.000Z	odd_	andy_	yes in synaptic
