2008-07-30T05:01:00.000Z	everton137		have someone here managed to install cinelerra? How do I know if I'm using a RT Kernel? I'm having problems when trying to install cinelerra...
2008-07-30T05:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	"uname -r" will tell yoy the current kernel you use, if it ends in -rt you're on a realtime kernel
2008-07-30T05:03:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	yes, I guessed that, thanks. Then I'm not using it
2008-07-30T05:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	look at akirad.cinelerra.org for a ubuntu repo , the rt kernel you can install via apt-get or synaptic
2008-07-30T05:08:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	yeap, I tried follow akirad instructions and repo, but I have problems installing cinelerra. Now I'm trying openmovieeditor, wich also downloaded some files from akirad repo
2008-07-30T05:09:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	i see, perhaps it's down .. any specific errors or warnings when trying to install it via apt-get ?

2008-07-30T05:12:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	My kernel 2.6.24-19-generic
2008-07-30T05:12:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	ok, checking
2008-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	have you tried removing package mpeg3-utils yet ? according to what the paste shows that might conflict with libmpeg3hv-generic from akirad ..
2008-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	 he cannot, let me see the error
2008-07-30T05:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	lines 15 & 16 of your paste
2008-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	let me try to install libmpeg3hv-generic before isntall cinelerra
2008-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	might work yes
2008-07-30T05:23:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	yeahh, this package is the problem http://paste.ubuntu.com/31953/ I tried to solve it before, but didn't  handle
2008-07-30T05:26:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	same error indeed .. perhaps removing mpeg3-utils will let you install it properly, can't tell if that package is a must for you .. looks like something to report at bugs.launchpad.net if it isn't already
2008-07-30T05:27:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	thanks for your help, I will try cinelerra later :) I'm off the computer for today. Ciao
2008-07-30T05:27:00.000Z	glitsj16	everton137	no problem, arrivederla
2008-07-30T05:28:00.000Z	everton137	glitsj16	I'll see if it's not reported and report it, if in case
