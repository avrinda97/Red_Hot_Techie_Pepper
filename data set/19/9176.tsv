2008-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	unb	Halitech	sorry forgot to mention is the build in cam. the error output is "(cheese:8565): GStreamer-WARNING **: pad source:src returned caps which are not a real subset of its template caps"
2008-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	Halitech	unb	it should still show up in lsusb

2008-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	unb	Halitech	nothing wrong though
2008-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	Halitech	unb	I'm thinking its the omnivision one but not sure, think I tried helping someone with it before and in 8.10 it doesn't seem to work
2008-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	unb	Halitech	so sad...
2008-12-11T20:07:00.000Z	Halitech	unb	looks like it might be something with the kernel as even gentoo and fedora folks are having issues with that cam
2008-12-11T20:08:00.000Z	unb	Halitech	ok, than nothing i can do... the pulseaudio also having problem.
2008-12-11T20:09:00.000Z	Halitech	unb	I don't use pulse so no ideas for you
2008-12-11T20:09:00.000Z	unb	Halitech	what you use than? maybe i should change too.
2008-12-11T20:10:00.000Z	Halitech	unb	I use alsa
2008-12-11T20:10:00.000Z	unb	Halitech	ok, i will that too.
