2008-05-26T21:58:00.000Z	Terabyte		Hey, I'm having problems with getting onto the internet (or even my network) in ubuntu 8.04. It worked fine in 7.04, but now it doesn't. The physical connections are all there (I can get online with vista), just in ubuntu it doesn't work. Any ideas?

2008-05-26T22:19:00.000Z	anirudh0	Terabyte	unlikely, unless you have done something after the install that might have caused it
2008-05-26T22:16:00.000Z	anirudh0	Terabyte	see this "....Exobyte dhclient: can't create /var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.leases: Permission denied"
2008-05-26T22:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	Terabyte	you have a permissions problem, but i'm not sure what will resolve it
2008-05-26T22:19:00.000Z	Terabyte	anirudh0	do you think reinstalling would help?
2008-05-26T22:19:00.000Z	anirudh0	Terabyte	wait for someone else to answer
2008-05-26T22:19:00.000Z	Terabyte	anirudh0	ok thanks
