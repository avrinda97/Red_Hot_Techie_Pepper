2012-08-22T17:00:00.000Z	Plumblum		i dont see why my ftp username would be different from the ssl one
2012-08-22T17:01:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	what's the problem?
2012-08-22T17:03:00.000Z	Plumblum	tehnef	yep i didnt uncomment it, just set it to NO
2012-08-22T17:04:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	btw you might want to revisit turning on FTP at all.
2012-08-22T17:05:00.000Z	Plumblum	tehnef	could you explain that :) ?
2012-08-22T17:06:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	FTP all by itself is pretty insecure, freaks out on firewall/NAT, and you can generally get what you need done via SFTP, which is really just SSH
2012-08-22T17:08:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	if ssh is enabled, SFTP is too
2012-08-22T17:08:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	meaning you don't have to do any more work
2012-08-22T17:10:00.000Z	Plumblum	tehnef	depends on who you are talking to ;) the ppl in here really differs in how they help ^^
2012-08-22T17:11:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	when you've seen how some people "ask" for help, not to mention the same problem again and again...sometimes the helpers can be testy
2012-08-22T17:11:00.000Z	Plumblum	tehnef	i totally agree :)
2012-08-22T17:11:00.000Z	tehnef	Plumblum	'apt-get purge vsftpd' will get rid of it
2012-08-22T17:29:00.000Z	Plumblum	tehnef	i got sftp working (yay) but i dont have write axcess to certain folders, permitrootlogin is set to yes, but i cant login as the user root from filezilla, should i figure out a way to do that or should i give my user the appropriate permissions for the folders im going to use ?
