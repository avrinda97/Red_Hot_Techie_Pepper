2007-10-04T10:22:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		I have two hard drives. One with Ubuntu, the slave drive, and the master drive with Windows. I used to be able to select which OS to run when I booted up my computer, but today I reinstalled Windows, and I can't access Ubuntu at all. It's like I've only got one hard drive.
2007-10-04T10:23:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		....GRUB?
2007-10-04T10:23:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		I don't have that.
2007-10-04T10:24:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		Wow. I hate Windows :P
2007-10-04T10:24:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		That guide tells me to enter commands. Where?
2007-10-04T10:24:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		Oh, I tried the first one. Hold on.
2007-10-04T10:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	An Ubuntu ( or any other Linux ) LiveCD
2007-10-04T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	No, that only gives you a menu if you have grub installed, which you do not
2007-10-04T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	Follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2007-10-04T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	Are you booted into the LiveCD?
2007-10-04T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	You probably just want to do the "quick start"
2007-10-04T11:03:00.000Z	Nauraushaun	Jordan_U	that confuses me too.
2007-10-04T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	Which step?
2007-10-04T11:04:00.000Z	Nauraushaun	Jordan_U	finding my boot partition. I'm not quite sure what a boot partition is.
2007-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	It's the partition Ubuntu is installed on
2007-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	Nauraushaun	Jordan_U	If it's on it's own hard drive, does that mean the drive is the partition?
2007-10-04T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	You have windows and Ubuntu installed on the same drive, correct?
2007-10-04T11:06:00.000Z	Nauraushaun	Jordan_U	No, seperate drives
2007-10-04T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nauraushaun	Then it is the first partition on whatever drive Ubuntu is installed on
