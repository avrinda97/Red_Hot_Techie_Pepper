2009-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	that's the best nick i have ever seen
2009-03-17T06:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	About 1.5x size of RAM *if* you want to hibernate and use the swap partition for it
2009-03-17T06:12:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	sounds good too.
2009-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	Is it a swap partition or a file?
2009-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	the partition.
2009-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	That depends on whether there's free disk space above before the next partition
2009-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	i wanna make it smaller
2009-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	That's unusual :) You've got the easy job then!
2009-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	okies. what?
2009-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	Do you want to reclaim the freed space for something else though?
2009-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	yeah, i want to make it part of the system partition
2009-03-17T06:16:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	OK, now you've made it difficult again!
2009-03-17T06:16:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	that's what linux is for, isn't it? :)
2009-03-17T06:17:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	it's probably easier to just reinstall, right?
2009-03-17T06:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	It means you have to 1) disable swap. 2) use cfdisk or fdisk to shrink the swap partition 3) recreate the swap with mkswap 4) the difficult bit - move the next partition down then expand it then grow the file-system inside it.
2009-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	yeah, it's easier just to install it again :)
2009-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	XtrHotMarSpy	Honestly  - if you've got no data/settings to loose, for a novice, yes it is
2009-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	yep
2009-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	XtrHotMarSpy	IntuitiveNipple	thanks
