2006-04-19T09:09:00.000Z	leprechaun		iam using a diffrent computer to talk here right now
2006-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	leprechaun		NIC?
2006-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	leprechaun		network interface card?
2006-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	leprechaun		it has the one wireless card that is built in and i think a ethernet card too
2006-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	leprechaun		i have the driver for the wireless card allready but i need to install ndiswrapper first
2006-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	leprechaun		i have the source for ndiswrapper allready extraced on the computer
2006-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	leprechaun		i used a usb drive to download it on this one and this transfer it onto the computer but it wont let me install it using 'sudo make install' because apparntly make isnt even a command
2006-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	leprechaun		wouldnt it give me a dependency error then?
2006-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	leprechaun		right where do i get that?
2006-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	leprechaun		why wouldnt it come with the defualt install
2006-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	i'd use checkinstall over make install
2006-04-19T09:15:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	makes deb files from source . makes for easier removal later if you wish to
2006-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	nope.  build-essential is on the cd
2006-04-19T09:17:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	just not installed by default is all
2006-04-19T09:17:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	sudo apt-get intsall build-essential
2006-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	nope. on the CD and DVD
2006-04-19T09:23:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	no-one's forcing you to stick with it
2006-04-19T09:24:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	you don't even have net access.  an xp box would be just as secure ;)
2006-04-19T09:26:00.000Z	orbin	leprechaun	pastebin the errors you're getting
