2009-12-05T22:24:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	sorry my network rebooted now my nickname is a "zombie"
2009-12-05T22:24:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	an installer bug; the partition phase doesnt see the HDD and just .. drops me to manual paritioner without any option other than to cancel the install
2009-12-05T22:24:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	running cd check now.. im on dualscreen so can diag this easily
2009-12-05T22:25:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	yes do that, it might be that your ISO is bad
2009-12-05T22:26:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	cd check finished without errors
2009-12-05T22:27:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	Sorry, i have little information to help you
2009-12-05T22:39:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	just for some feedback, the Ubuntu 8.04 ISO installs correctly without any issue. so this really is a bug with the installer on 9.10
2009-12-05T22:41:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	before you say so, do you "dd" of your disk and an "md5sum" of your resulting ISO and then check against the MD5SUMS on the ubuntu.com release web page
2009-12-05T22:42:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	i used dd on my /dev/sda while using the 9.10 livecd, both to read from it, and to write zeroes to it to wipe the partition table that existed
2009-12-05T22:42:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	the ubuntu md5sums web URL is: http://releases.ubuntu.com/karmic/MD5SUMS
2009-12-05T22:43:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	I dont think we talk about the same thing
2009-12-05T22:43:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	i already did a cd check, its not a cd read error. those are easy to detect the cdrom drive will spin up and down and it will take a long time.. none of that is the case here. its a software bug/regression in the ubuntu installer
2009-12-05T22:43:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	how did you do a CD check?
2009-12-05T22:43:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	using the menu option Check for CD defects
2009-12-05T22:44:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	that is not convincing
2009-12-05T22:44:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	yes you are right but it uses md5sums on files inside the cd, not the iso as a whole
2009-12-05T22:45:00.000Z	mka2	geomi	if your iso matches the ones in http://releases.ubuntu.com/karmic/MD5SUMS then you are 100% sure
2009-12-05T22:45:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	should be no difference.. if the files are intact with the checksum there should be no read errors or corruption issues. but ill do as you say if you really think it makes any difference
2009-12-05T22:46:00.000Z	geomi	mka2	also gonna try with alternate and server ISO, after that ill file a bug report
