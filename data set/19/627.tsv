2011-11-18T21:48:00.000Z	Emphy		Hi
2011-11-18T21:49:00.000Z	Emphy		I want to remove a BIOS password on my computer, how can help me ? Because I want to install windows/linux but I can't with the password
2011-11-18T21:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Emphy	you generally need to reset the BIOS CMOS, which is a physical process that requires access to the internals of the machine
2011-11-18T21:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding		or you just enter the password and go to the BIOS setup
2011-11-18T21:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the former assumes that you're trying to avoid the password because you don't know it
2011-11-18T21:51:00.000Z	Emphy		 I've removed the battery, wait 30 minutes, and replaced the battery but the BIOS password is always here
2011-11-18T21:51:00.000Z	Emphy	tensorpudding	I don't have the BIOS password. :/
2011-11-18T21:52:00.000Z	Emphy		How many ?
2011-11-18T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding		oh, laptops are different
2011-11-18T21:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding		you can presumably remove the CMOS battery and that would reset it
2011-11-18T21:52:00.000Z	Emphy		Because When I restart the computer, I didn't have date and time but there is always password.
2011-11-18T21:53:00.000Z	Emphy		Yes this is a laptop
2011-11-18T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the regular laptop battery can be removed without affecting the CMOS, because it has a dedicated power source in the form of a large watch-type battery
2011-11-18T21:54:00.000Z	tensorpudding		if that doesn't work your only recourse would be to open it up and look for the CMOS reset jumper
2011-11-18T21:54:00.000Z	Emphy		Okay I search
2011-11-18T21:57:00.000Z	Emphy		And What CMOS reset jumper look like on laptop ?
2011-11-18T21:58:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Emphy	surely that would depend on model
2011-11-18T21:58:00.000Z	Emphy		Okay
2011-11-18T22:00:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Emphy	you should probably ask the person who set the password
