2008-03-13T23:01:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	i am running the 64bit, with ati radeon 200m
2008-03-13T23:02:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	is it no possible to have the splash run with 64?
2008-03-13T23:02:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	well.. let's blame it on the 64-bit os then.. =).. I haven't been able to use the splash screen since I upgraded to gutsy.. I don't miss it that much
2008-03-13T23:03:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	lol, yea i guess ur right, i wasn't able to get it to work in 64bit gentoo either, but the link will hopefully fix the reall sllloooowwww boot
2008-03-13T23:03:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	thanks for the link bro
2008-03-13T23:04:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	not my link..  thank prince_jammys =)
2008-03-13T23:23:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	just rebooted, Holy **** what a difference, thanks man
2008-03-13T23:23:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	huh? ah.. the splash thingy..
2008-03-13T23:24:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	yea, but my boot time was in the minutes, now its down to seconds
2008-04-10T11:52:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	have you installed build-essential?
2008-04-10T11:52:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	let me check
2008-04-10T11:53:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	just run this "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2008-04-10T11:53:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	it's not a big thing.. and you'll need it to compile any software on ubuntu
2008-04-10T11:54:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	i'm installing it now, surprising it is not included normally...?
2008-04-10T11:54:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	yes.. there must be a pretty good reason not to include it in the default setup..
2008-04-10T11:56:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	your my savior man, installing essential did the trick...are there any other builds i should include, i will be doing some socket programming, or does this include the standard Unix C/C++ libraries?
2008-04-10T11:58:00.000Z	Slart	saladdin19	the build-essential thingy sets up the compiling basics.. you'll probably need some dev-packages later on.. but you'll notice when things don't work =)
2008-04-10T12:05:00.000Z	saladdin19	Slart	thanks for your help
