2006-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	m0dY		does apt-get records the currently installed pkgs in some registry file ?
2006-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	no. You should look into apt-history, but you have to install it.
2006-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	i think there should be some file or a db which it's writing the pkgs status into on my system..!
2006-09-24T12:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	I think you want apt-pinning.
2006-09-24T12:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	pinning allows you to hold a package at a specific version, source, revision, etc. It allows you to specify which package versions can and cannot be installed. I think it's what you want.
2006-09-24T12:22:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	EXACTLY :D
2006-09-24T12:23:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	there are several ways to approach this. Firstly, did you install apache from source or as a package?
2006-09-24T12:23:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	a source pkg
2006-09-24T12:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	look into the equivs package.
2006-09-24T12:25:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	reading now :)
2006-09-24T12:29:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	equivs is far from what i want.. unless it could let me just type a pkg name to be excluded and then it automatically exclude all pkgs related to it, dependencies and so on without stating *EACH* pkg
2006-09-24T12:29:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	I don't think so, no...
2006-09-24T12:55:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	do i need to do something to enable the /etc/apt/preferences file to be recognized by apt-get ?
2006-09-24T12:55:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	no.
2006-09-24T12:57:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	that's what i typed in..
2006-09-24T12:57:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	\n means a new line =)
2006-09-24T12:59:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	any idea !
2006-09-24T12:59:00.000Z	ArrenLex	m0dY	I'm googling it.
2006-09-24T13:34:00.000Z	m0dY	ArrenLex	still no idea about my pinning prob. :(
