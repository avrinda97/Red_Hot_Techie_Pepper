2008-03-17T23:55:00.000Z	Dfhaii		argh, updating to 7.10 was an epic failure
2008-03-17T23:55:00.000Z	Dfhaii		update-manager bombed out, and dpkg is now core dumping
2008-03-17T23:55:00.000Z	Dfhaii		anyone have a similar experience
2008-03-17T23:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	People having that problem have used automatix or added unsupported repos..
2008-03-17T23:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2008-03-17T23:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	Use that command.. universe and multiverse are not going to be the problem
2008-03-18T00:00:00.000Z	Dfhaii	Jack_Sparrow	E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2008-03-18T00:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	I know you are sure you have not added repos.. but if you run that command I can be sure as well
2008-03-18T00:02:00.000Z	Dfhaii	Jack_Sparrow	that command isn't running ;)
2008-03-18T00:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	What distro or release are you using
2008-03-18T00:04:00.000Z	Dfhaii	Jack_Sparrow	regular ubuntu, coming from 7.4? to 7.10
2008-03-18T00:06:00.000Z	Dfhaii	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/59961/ that's my /etc/apt/sources
2008-03-18T00:08:00.000Z	Dfhaii	Jack_Sparrow	did you see my pastebin?
2008-03-18T00:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	Yes.. looks like deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main         is going to end up being the source of your problems
2008-03-18T00:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	Using Debian - unstable is probably not the best of choices
2008-03-18T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	not really, especially as you probably dont know what you installed from there and probably dont have a backup prior to that installation
2008-03-18T00:11:00.000Z	Dfhaii	Jack_Sparrow	that line in sources is commented out
2008-03-18T00:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	it is now..  but something added it.. and was most likely installed from it or it would not be in there..  even if rem'd out
2008-03-18T00:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dfhaii	Virtually every time we see an upgrade fail. we find unsupported reops in the sources list
