2010-07-17T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	ok
2010-07-17T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	iptables -L to see your current rules
2010-07-17T20:02:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	grep out your own IP
2010-07-17T20:02:00.000Z	rayvtirx	ikonia	there are none after i use iptables -F
2010-07-17T20:02:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	are you using fail2ban
2010-07-17T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	what are you using then ?
2010-07-17T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	what tool are you using to log scape and add the firewall rules ?
2010-07-17T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	if you do an iptables -L what do you actually get
2010-07-17T20:08:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	stop iptables and do an iptables -X then restart it
2010-07-17T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	/etc/init.d/iptables stop
2010-07-17T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	ughh, I've not got an ubuntu box to hand to get the init script, look in /etc/init.d
2010-07-17T20:24:00.000Z	rayvtirx	ikonia	- DOH! it works after  a vsftpd restart - vsorry and thanks for tryin to help
2010-07-17T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	no problem, I wonder why the vsftpd session needed restarted
2010-07-17T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rayvtirx	the blocoking is with iptables, so that doesn't make sense, but I'm glad your working
