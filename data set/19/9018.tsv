2007-02-15T10:40:00.000Z	elyon225	bruenig	Heh, already tried that ;)
2007-02-15T10:41:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon225	it looks like it is part of kcontrol
2007-02-15T10:49:00.000Z	elyon225	bruenig	Hmm... installing flash from the repos never worked for me... pretty sure it always installed flash7
2007-02-15T10:50:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon225	you didn't have your backports
2007-02-15T10:50:00.000Z	elyon225	bruenig	Yeah, I did... well, I think I did.
2007-02-15T10:50:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon225	do apt-cache show flashplugin-nonfree | grep Version
2007-02-15T10:51:00.000Z	elyon225	bruenig	Nope... version 7 :)
2007-02-15T10:51:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon225	you must not have backports multiverse
2007-02-15T10:52:00.000Z	elyon225	bruenig	Hmm... I've reinstalled so many times (switching from gnome to kde and back)... can't remember if or how I enabled backports this time.
