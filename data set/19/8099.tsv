2009-09-27T04:00:00.000Z	reya276		something as basic as a microphone does not work out of the Box, weird
2009-09-27T04:01:00.000Z	delly	reya276	Well, open a terminal and write alsamixer
2009-09-27T04:01:00.000Z	delly	reya276	there something will say either "line" or "something with "mic", and set to 1
2009-09-27T04:04:00.000Z	reya276	delly	I don't see any line in on mic
2009-09-27T04:04:00.000Z	delly	reya276	what is set to 0 then?
2009-09-27T04:04:00.000Z	reya276	delly	there is nothing set to zero
2009-09-27T04:05:00.000Z	delly	reya276	what is set to 1 then?
2009-09-27T04:06:00.000Z	reya276	delly	I literally have a bunch of what it looks like a graph with master, headphone, pcm, front, surround, center, LFE, side
2009-09-27T04:07:00.000Z	reya276	delly	there are no text lines, when I typed in alsamixer I got literally a mixer
2009-09-27T04:08:00.000Z	delly	reya276	it is indeed a mizer :
2009-09-27T04:08:00.000Z	delly	reya276	try to go to the far right using the direction keys on the keyboard
2009-09-27T04:09:00.000Z	delly	reya276	i had to set IEC958 to 1 to get my plugged in Mic to behave like i wanted it to
2009-09-27T04:09:00.000Z	reya276	delly	ok how do I set that to one
2009-09-27T04:11:00.000Z	delly	reya276	you just use the direction keys on the keyboard and up and down is adjusting the volum. Set anything that got either some strange names or the word "in" or "mic" in them to high values
2009-09-27T04:12:00.000Z	reya276	delly	that is not working for IEC958, but it work for all others
2009-09-27T04:12:00.000Z	delly	reya276	so do the mic behave now or?
2009-09-27T04:14:00.000Z	reya276	delly	yes it seems like, thanks. But this should have been enabled by default. Not complaining I'm just saying is just common sense
2009-09-27T04:15:00.000Z	delly	reya276	well, welcome to the club
2009-09-27T04:16:00.000Z	reya276	delly	lol, I guess we can forget about mass adoption with issues like these. Thanks I appreciate it.
