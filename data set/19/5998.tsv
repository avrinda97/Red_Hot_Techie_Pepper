2010-01-13T02:57:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	my xfce uses thunar for a file manager
2010-01-13T02:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 i cant stand thunar either.
2010-01-14T06:51:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	My best guess is text menu = terminal
2010-01-19T05:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 i recall some 'default' option in samba for default shares to show. also.
2010-01-19T05:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 i just enable the home shares and type in the actual username at the end of the share line then bookmark it :)
2010-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	The default share kinda works. It still prompts for a user/pass, but regardless of what's entered it will now show my printer share after the login fails.
2010-01-19T06:05:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	Actually, when running through the gui to add a printer, it shows up now. I guess it attempted to log in as the windows user, failed, then opened anyway. Thanks you made my day :D
2010-01-31T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 i dont think so. You could use screen
2010-01-31T12:11:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	Ok, thanks
2010-01-31T12:13:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	FYI, shift + pg up works. Thanks for the input though :)
2010-05-18T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 i was thinking there was a special password setting for the printer.
2010-05-18T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 ive had guest ok to print setups befor. (but not right now on this box)
2010-05-18T06:52:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	I have guest ok = yes set, but the if I change from share to user mode the windows pc's can't see it anymore.
2010-05-18T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 thers also mey be a CUPS setting.  I got a new networked printer. so havent had to mess with those settings in ages.
2010-05-18T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 check out the using-samba book and other books in the 'samba-doc' package  - those books almost always have the info i need on samba issues
2010-05-18T06:55:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	Thanks, I was not aware of the -doc pkg.
2010-05-18T06:57:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	How do I open the documentation after I install the package?
2010-05-18T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	powertool08	 it all goes to /usr/share/doc under some sub dirs.
2010-05-18T06:58:00.000Z	powertool08	Dr_Willis	Thanks again
