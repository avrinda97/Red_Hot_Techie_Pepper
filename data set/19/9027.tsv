2007-01-12T11:30:00.000Z	k010		if i compile a 2.6.19 kernel and patch it with 2.6.20-rc4 would it be able to run kvm??
2007-01-12T11:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	you might ruin the kernel if you do that
2007-01-12T11:31:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	what do u mean?
2007-01-12T11:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	don't apply patches to applications they arent meant for .. in your case dont patch 2.6.19 with 2.6.20-rc4
2007-01-12T11:32:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	i thought thats how u patch judging from the guide im reading
2007-01-12T11:33:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	here it says u shud not patch kernel say 2.6.19.1 with 2.6.20-rc4
2007-01-12T11:33:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	but 2.6.19 its fine
2007-01-12T11:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	errrm, thats what i said too, no?
2007-01-12T11:34:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	im gonna patch 2.6.19 with 2.6.20-rc4
2007-01-12T11:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	errm, well, it might work but might not work either .. you  can try it out by all means but "you have been warned"
2007-01-12T11:34:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	 might as well hey. thx for the warning
2007-01-12T11:35:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	it might fix some of the acpi issues i been having
2007-01-12T11:36:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	well, the way i see it .. the changes of code are most radical within kernel development .. major changes happen even in the smallest revisions .. and given that patches change code at specific locations within the source, you might be breaking stuff
2007-01-12T11:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	in this instance it is almost like applying a patch written for application A  on application B
2007-01-12T11:38:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	isnt the other way around
2007-01-12T11:38:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	ur patching 2.6.19 with 2.6.20
2007-01-12T11:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	k010	bahh, you get the point ..
2007-01-12T11:39:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	 well its dled so i tell u how it goes
2007-01-12T11:49:00.000Z	k010	un_operateur	sry to touble u again but is there someway where i can find details on the setting with make menuconfig?
