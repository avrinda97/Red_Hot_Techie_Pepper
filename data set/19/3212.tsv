2011-09-25T19:38:00.000Z	a4		im trying to compile an application and it says it requires glib 2.6 or greater and that i dont have glib... How do i get it? sudo apt-get install glib was a no-go
2011-09-25T19:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 whats the program you are trying to compile?
2011-09-25T19:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 You need one thats newer then the version in the repos?
2011-09-25T19:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 use sudo apt-get builddeps irssi   command   to pull in all needed developer files for it.
2011-09-25T19:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 the DEV files are not installed by default.
2011-09-25T19:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 you will need to install several things to compile stuff besides just the 'build-essential' package.
2011-09-25T19:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 i said it may be build-deps. try tab completion :)
2011-09-25T19:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 is theres some reason you need a newer version of irssi then whats in the repos?
2011-09-25T19:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 i perfer weechat over irssi these days
2011-09-25T19:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 totally depends on what you are compilign
2011-09-25T20:50:00.000Z	a4	dr_willis	i installed weechat but it wont open via terminal and i dont see it in my applications list :\
2011-09-25T20:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 weechat(tab)   to get its name
2011-09-25T20:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 it dosent have a menu item. and you will want to check its docs/guides
2011-09-25T20:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 organize in what way?
2011-09-25T20:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 behind it? behind what?  the file manager icons auto -rearange for me as i delete things.. the desktop icons have settings for that  i recall.. i dont put icons on my desktop much any more. :)
2011-09-25T20:57:00.000Z	a4	dr_willis	^
2011-09-25T20:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 thats a feature... :)
2011-09-25T21:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 thers prob some way to make them auto arange. but its not somthign ive ever bothered with. or wanted.. and it will be a moot point when gnome-3 and unity replace gnome2 i imagine. You may want to check the gnome forums and askubuntu.com to see if theres a way to auto-arange icons
2011-09-25T21:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	a4	 it  has unity by default. and gnome-shell  in the repos... both run on top of gnome-3
