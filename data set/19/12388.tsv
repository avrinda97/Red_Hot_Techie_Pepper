2005-09-13T10:29:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	what card do you have?
2005-09-13T10:30:00.000Z	odat	msfrank	VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. VT8375 [ProSavage8 KM266/KL266] 
2005-09-13T10:31:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	: DRI requires support in the kernel, and i don't know if ubuntu ships with the savage kernel driver enabled..
2005-09-13T10:31:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	i'll check tho
2005-09-13T10:31:00.000Z	odat		i'm just assuming that is why my screen redraws are so slow
2005-09-13T10:32:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	DRI will not help (at the moment) with 2d acceleration
2005-09-13T10:33:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	do you mean monitor flickering, like your refresh rate is too low?
2005-09-13T10:33:00.000Z	odat	msfrank	when switching applications and / or anything that requires screen redraws its painful
2005-09-13T10:35:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	open up /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and tell me what video driver you are using
2005-09-13T10:39:00.000Z	odat	msfrank	savage  driver
2005-09-13T10:40:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	hrm..i thought maybe you were using the old VGA driver or something..
2005-09-13T10:42:00.000Z	odat	msfrank	yea i'm not sure what to do
2005-09-13T10:43:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	are your computers specs recent?  ubuntu/GNOME can be fairly resource intensive
2005-09-13T10:45:00.000Z	odat	msfrank	i'm running a 1.7 ghz celeron with 256 megs of ram
2005-09-13T10:45:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	that sounds reasonable.. i'm baffled :(
2005-09-13T10:49:00.000Z	odat	msfrank	would checking out the xorg.conf file help?
2005-09-13T10:52:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	try reading through /var/log/Xorg.0.log.  its a chore, but you might find something in there
2005-09-13T10:52:00.000Z	msfrank	odat	like a misconfiguration or something
