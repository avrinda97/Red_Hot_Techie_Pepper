2006-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	frans-th		i am a breezy user, want to know how to install openoffice 2.0 in my ubuntu
2006-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	frans-th		can help
2006-01-12T17:23:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	"Applications" -> "Add applications" ?
2006-01-12T17:24:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	or: " System" -> "Administration" -> "Synaptic Package Manager"
2006-01-12T17:26:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	i find still 1.9.x
2006-01-12T17:27:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	the openoffice 2.0 is not there
2006-01-12T17:27:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	you are probably right there.. openoffice2.0 was released after the release of breezy.. and therefore it has not been included..
2006-01-12T17:28:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	the 1.9.x works fine for me though.. i recommend using that and waiting untill Dapper comes in april..
2006-01-12T17:38:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	why should i wait, if i can install now? but how :P
2006-01-12T17:40:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	for stability purposes i would say.. but then again.. berkes tells me that its not that stable at the moment..
2006-01-12T17:41:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	so i would recommend that you tried 1.9.xxx and only upgrade to 2.0 if you find that it is really unstable/annoying..
2006-01-12T17:41:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	what is that mean?
2006-01-12T17:41:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	i use in windows, 2.0 is very stable, and i want it in my ubuntu,
2006-01-12T17:42:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	never mind.. do whatever you think you should do.. i think i said enough for now..
2006-01-12T17:43:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	when will the stabel 2.0 can be run in ubuntu? must wait druppe?
2006-01-12T17:53:00.000Z	wdh	frans-th	upgrade to dapper next april.. it will have OOo 2.0 by then :)
2006-01-12T17:54:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	in our experience here, in fedora, we never love to upgrade the OS, except bugs that annoyin gour work
2006-01-12T17:54:00.000Z	frans-th	wdh	but i am think of ugrade my breezy to dapper :P
