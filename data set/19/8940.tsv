2008-01-07T17:26:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	If its a graphical program, you can use xkill
2010-08-18T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	f-spot?
2011-08-05T21:50:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	glebihan: you shouldn't need the -s there
2011-08-16T16:54:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	10.10 was not an LTS release.
2011-08-16T16:55:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	You just said 10.10 though.
2011-08-16T16:56:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	I'd backup my settings and just go for it.
2011-08-16T16:57:00.000Z	kyle_	Pici	yeh thats because you know linux to fix isses :(
2011-08-16T16:58:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	A hard drive? There shouldn't be any compatiblitly problems at all there.
2011-08-16T17:01:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	It *should* work. If anything you'll just lose some usable diskspace.
2011-08-18T17:47:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	What release of Ubuntu are you running?
2011-08-18T17:49:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	Then you should already have the shutdown command. It is part of upstart which is installed by default.
2011-08-18T17:51:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	heh, we all have those days ;)
2011-08-18T17:52:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	Thats a good question.
2011-08-18T17:53:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	Really, I don't know the answer and it is a good question.
2011-08-22T16:33:00.000Z	Pici	kyle_	'eject'
