2012-09-29T03:28:00.000Z	chris92		obviously I want to use the 400gb hard drive to install xubuntu on
2012-09-29T03:28:00.000Z	blackshirt	chris92	you can choose them one
2012-09-29T03:29:00.000Z	chris92	blackshirt	when I install it on the 1tb (in the install manager /dev/sdb), can I still boot into win8? thats the main issue
2012-09-29T03:30:00.000Z	blackshirt	chris92	yes, i think grub2 can booted win8..but you should ensure them
2012-09-29T03:32:00.000Z	blackshirt	chris92	i don't have play bit a more with win8 before ....
2012-09-29T03:33:00.000Z	chris92	blackshirt	I just installed grub2 on the linux harddrive, guess I have to use my bios bootmanager more often in the future ^^
2012-09-29T03:33:00.000Z	chris92		sigis?
2012-09-29T03:33:00.000Z	chris92		!fr | sigis
2012-09-29T03:33:00.000Z	chris92		nah, german adult ;)
2012-09-29T03:34:00.000Z	blackshirt	chris92	i think grub2 was capable booting your windows :d
2012-09-29T03:34:00.000Z	chris92		well, if needed I can re-install again with grub on the right harddrive :)
2012-09-29T03:35:00.000Z	blackshirt		chris92,sure,exactly
2012-09-29T03:35:00.000Z	chris92	blackshirt	also 12.10 will be released soon, i'll probably do a clean install once thats out
2012-09-29T03:36:00.000Z	blackshirt	chris92	thats your free choices :d
2012-09-29T03:37:00.000Z	chris92	blackshirt	I know :P hmm. is it normal, that the install manager takes quite some time after I chose my username and pw? o.O
2012-09-29T03:38:00.000Z	blackshirt	chris92	yes, thats very common....they do some installation step and copying a lot of files to your hd
2012-09-29T03:38:00.000Z	chris92	blackshirt	ahh I worried a little there :D now it shows the "Congratulations!" screen =) seems good!
2012-09-29T03:40:00.000Z	chris92	blackshirt	is it possible to edit the grub entries once its installed?
