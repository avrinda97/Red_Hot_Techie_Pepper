2007-12-26T01:03:00.000Z	technel		I bought a 22" widescreen LCD (AL2216W). Ubuntu was stretched, so I ran dpkg-reconfigure on xorg. However, the refresh time is REALLY slow. I see a line come down the screen as it refreshes. Why? (PS: ATI video card, Windows works fine)
2007-12-26T01:03:00.000Z	wols_	technel	what drivers?
2007-12-26T01:03:00.000Z	technel	wols_	I am using default, I believe FGLRX -- that's ATI proprietary, isn't it?
2007-12-26T01:03:00.000Z	wols_	technel	that is not default but yes proprietary
2007-12-26T01:04:00.000Z	technel	wols_	So is there anything I can do?
2007-12-26T01:04:00.000Z	wols_	technel	maybe disable compiz and sxserver-xgl
2007-12-26T01:05:00.000Z	technel	wols_	Oh, they aren't working at all. I believe it auto turned off...
2007-12-26T01:06:00.000Z	technel	wols_	Is there anything I can do? :\
2007-12-26T01:06:00.000Z	wols_	technel	I just told you
2007-12-26T01:07:00.000Z	wols_	technel	dpkg -l |grep xserver-xgl
2007-12-26T01:07:00.000Z	technel	wols_	Oh, I missed that
2007-12-26T01:08:00.000Z	technel	wols_	-> ii  xserver-xgl                                1:1.1.99.1~git20070727-0ubuntu3 -- Should I do an apt-get remove ?
2007-12-26T01:08:00.000Z	wols_	technel	so it's installed and runs on X startup
2007-12-26T01:09:00.000Z	technel	wols_	So I should uninstall it?
2007-12-26T01:09:00.000Z	wols_	technel	yes
2007-12-26T01:09:00.000Z	technel	wols_	Restarting, BRB
2007-12-26T01:12:00.000Z	technel	wols_	So it looks fine now. Basically, no more XGL or Compiz-Fusion for me?
2007-12-26T01:13:00.000Z	wols_	technel	if it solved it: sorry, yes. until ati gets their acto together, if ever
2007-12-26T01:13:00.000Z	technel	wols_	:( ok, thanks.
