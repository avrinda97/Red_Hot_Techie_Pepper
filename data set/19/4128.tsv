2009-06-30T09:29:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	Post your help in the channel so we can correct you if you're wrong and make sure you're giving good advice. Also more than one person may need it.
2009-06-30T09:29:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	New to Open Source?
2009-06-30T09:30:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	That's not how the community works.
2009-06-30T09:30:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	You were asked rather politely to keep it to the channel so we all can benefit. That's the point of FOSS.
2009-06-30T09:31:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	No you aren't. If you're not going to contribute in FOSS style, your contributions aren't wanted.
2009-06-30T09:32:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	Installing Ubuntu last week doesn't make you a linuxguy.
2009-06-30T09:36:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	You can get 1 on 1 help in the channel too. Start prefacing your lines with the name of your target.
2009-06-30T09:36:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	Notice that's what we're all doing.
2009-06-30T09:37:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	We prefer our way, and our way works. Your way doesn't help the community.
2009-06-30T09:37:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	It's not difficult, really.
2009-06-30T09:38:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	Our way also helps individuals, but it helps more than one on many occasions. You're being wasteful
2009-06-30T09:39:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	We've helped more than that I'm sure. Right now, down the road, and so on.
2009-06-30T09:39:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	This model works for a reason.
2009-06-30T09:41:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	And start prefacing your lines with names... it makes it highlight, and it's really simple. Use the nick completer.
2009-06-30T09:42:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	Fail.
2009-06-30T09:42:00.000Z	mefached	linuxguy2009	In the meantime, we'll be helping much more people through archived help.
