2008-09-24T17:02:00.000Z	pppoooeee	DasE1	probably..., just some plain features as firestarter's configuration. Then tried to 'start' good old "wvdial --config=/home/.../internet1.conf" - and it had been simply disconnected or something like this. This time I have run wvdial at first, then i have installed firestarter from .deb

2008-09-24T17:05:00.000Z	pppoooeee		it probably finds no "carrier", which incomes, it's GPRS:
2008-09-24T17:05:00.000Z	pppoooeee		--> Modem initialized.
2008-09-24T17:05:00.000Z	pppoooeee		--> Sending: ATDT*99***1#

2008-09-24T17:06:00.000Z	pppoooeee		ok, sorry, it've created one-liners automatically
2008-09-24T17:07:00.000Z	DasE1		﻿pppoooeee: so you want firestarter to prevent it ?
2008-09-24T17:08:00.000Z	pppoooeee		Pastebin... well, ok... Have not thought about it due to rel. big price for limited traffic at current connection
2008-09-24T17:10:00.000Z	pppoooeee	DasE1	no, last time i had to uninstall firestarter to be able to use wvdial... This time will see what'll 've happened... Wanted to know if my question is really a bit strange. Thought something like "wvdial is relatively powerful but small console program and it do not "tell" to other apps what it try to do"

2008-09-24T17:14:00.000Z	DasE1		﻿pppoooeee: it depends on how iptables is configured, not on the ""POwer of an app
2008-09-24T17:14:00.000Z	pppoooeee		What is a way to install not proprietary drivers for ati radeon x1100? What packets could it be? What size to download? Probably, same 50 mb? And will it share RAM to give whole 256 mb of RAM to video chip?
2008-09-24T17:15:00.000Z	DasE1		﻿pppoooeee:ob-grafics ? can't specify share in bios ??!
2008-09-24T17:15:00.000Z	pppoooeee	DasE1	yeah, this time i will see what happens when i will use wvdial at second time, with already installed firestarter as i've described above.
