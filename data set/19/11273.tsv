2006-03-16T17:33:00.000Z	knoppix		Hey ...
2006-03-16T17:34:00.000Z	knoppix		Yeah ... /usr-partition down ..
2006-03-16T17:34:00.000Z	knoppix		;/
2006-03-16T17:36:00.000Z	knoppix		Is there a opinion to bring the files from my usr-partition, which were moved by the fsck.ext3 to the lost&found-directory, to their old place?
2006-03-16T17:37:00.000Z	Healot	knoppix	, "cp" or "mv"
2006-03-16T17:38:00.000Z	knoppix		Yeah Healot, but i don't know, what which file is, coz they r all renamed.
2006-03-16T17:38:00.000Z	Healot	knoppix	, there is no way to figure that out either, because the FS inode entries are changed...
2006-03-16T17:39:00.000Z	Healot		as well as renamed files...
2006-03-16T17:39:00.000Z	knoppix		Hmpf ... Okay ... Thx Healot ... Have to install Ubuntu new. :X
2006-03-16T17:40:00.000Z	Healot		you've done fsck, right, knoppix?
2006-03-16T17:40:00.000Z	Healot		!automatix
2006-03-16T17:40:00.000Z	knoppix		Yeah Healot
2006-03-16T17:40:00.000Z	Healot		dude try "easysource" instead
2006-03-16T17:41:00.000Z	knoppix		what is "easysource"?
2006-03-16T17:41:00.000Z	Healot		putrajohor:, install all the "gstreamer" plugins, or try another player like "vlc" or "gxine"
2006-03-16T17:45:00.000Z	Healot		mime-settings isn't easy, but if you're in KDE... look at the KDE control, under browser...
2006-03-16T17:48:00.000Z	Healot		putrajohor:, get "xmms"
2006-03-16T17:49:00.000Z	knoppix	Healot	i cant cp the "#"-directories from the lost+found directory.
2006-03-16T17:49:00.000Z	Healot	knoppix	, "su" yourself by using "sudo" :)
