2005-06-02T08:41:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	- do you have the make/model of both drives?
2005-06-02T08:43:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	- dmesg|less
2005-06-02T08:44:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	Hmm, I ran that and there seems to be a lot info.
2005-06-02T08:44:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	mostly dealing with BIOS and what not.
2005-06-02T08:45:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	this is a laptop so I see mostly BIOS and ACPI stuff and one DMA line along with other things.
2005-06-02T08:46:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	should I grep for IDE?
2005-06-02T08:47:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	- did you up/down arrow?
2005-06-02T08:47:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	yes
2005-06-02T08:47:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	/ide
2005-06-02T08:48:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	- you should find: hda: Maxtor 90871U2, ATA DISK drive
2005-06-02T08:48:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	hda: FUJITSU MHR2020AT, ATA DISK drive
2005-06-02T08:59:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	so, what do you think could be the problem
2005-06-02T08:59:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	or am I just imagingin that my system is running slow
2005-06-02T08:59:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	- I couldn't find your drive on http://www.fcpa.fujitsu.com/search/search.php
2005-06-02T09:00:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	Strange.
2005-06-02T09:00:00.000Z	CarlK	fazer	- my guess is the old one was "faster"
2005-06-02T09:00:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	that's odd, since I dual boot with this hard drive and while booting XP, the hard drive stays quiet.
2005-06-02T09:01:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	XP seems to run nicely but not Ubuntu though
2005-06-02T09:03:00.000Z	fazer	CarlK	what were you looking for in fujitsu's website?
