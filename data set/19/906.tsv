2011-09-03T14:12:00.000Z	ionite		how do i get to my LIB folder in terminal?
2011-09-03T14:13:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	cd /usr/lib ?
2011-09-03T14:13:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	assuming thats the folder you mean
2011-09-03T14:14:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	ure right but how do i open the rules.d folder?
2011-09-03T14:15:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	cd /usr/lib/udev/rules.d
2011-09-03T14:16:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	or it might be /etc/udev/rules.d - there are two folders
2011-09-03T14:16:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	why nothing displans in udev folder when i type LS?
2011-09-03T14:16:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	you generally dont want to meddle with anything in /usr/lib unless you know what you are doing
2011-09-03T14:17:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	i need to add a device line in my rules.d to make my scanner work
2011-09-03T14:17:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	then you probably want to add a new file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ and add the line to that file
2011-09-03T14:17:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	call it 20-scanner.rules or something
2011-09-03T14:18:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	thats right but i cant get to that file in my terminal
2011-09-03T14:18:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	cd /etc/udev/rules.d
2011-09-03T14:20:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	it's not that directory u mentioned
2011-09-03T14:26:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	/lib/udev/rules.d/ is for package provided udev rules. if you want to provide your own, or amend existing ones, it is advised you do it in /etc/udev/rules.d
2011-09-03T14:26:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	there is even a README explaining this in /etc/udev/rules.d
2011-09-03T14:28:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	thanks. http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_scn1c.html
2011-09-03T14:30:00.000Z	linxeh	ionite	ok, in that case you could edit the file it says i
2011-09-03T14:32:00.000Z	ionite	linxeh	but how do i use nano? cant i just open it with a text editor and edit it?
