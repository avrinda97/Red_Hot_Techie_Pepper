2009-03-22T04:56:00.000Z	kaski		What?
2009-03-22T04:56:00.000Z	kaski		I've never been here before..
2009-03-22T04:57:00.000Z	kaski		Whipper could you help me?
2009-03-22T04:57:00.000Z	kaski		Erm, maybe we just had the same one?
2009-03-22T04:57:00.000Z	kaski		My friend told me to come here for Ubuntu help and this is my first time using linux
2009-03-22T04:58:00.000Z	kaski		When I boot into Ubuntu, the loading screen progresses and then I get a wall of text in like a console type thing
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	kaski		Then this command prompt called BusyBox comes
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	kaski		In order to continue to boot, I have to type exit
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	kaski		This makes more text appear and the computer boots
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	kaski		Is this normal?
2009-03-22T05:00:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kaski	no. which version of ubuntu? any mods?
2009-03-22T05:01:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kaski	are you picking the top-most option from GRUB?
2009-03-22T05:05:00.000Z	kaski	sprinkmeier	Ah you mean the one where it says stuff like Ubuntu 8.10 generic
2009-03-22T05:06:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kaski	yes.
2009-03-22T05:06:00.000Z	kaski	sprinkmeier	in that case im pretty sure i choose the first option
2009-03-22T05:08:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kaski	not sure what's going on then. i'd need to see the box, i'm not familiar enough with the problem to remote diagnose...
2009-03-22T05:08:00.000Z	kaski	sprinkmeier	http://www.busybox.net/screenshot.html
2009-03-22T05:10:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kaski	sounds like grub is dumping into busybox. sorry,  out of ideas
2009-03-22T05:10:00.000Z	kaski	sprinkmeier	okay thanks anyway
