2012-01-03T20:58:00.000Z	luca	batlock	i followed a psychocats guide on how to create a partition and move the home folder in it and nearly had to format the hdd. plus now i have it full of odd partition stuff
2012-01-03T20:59:00.000Z	batlock	luca	got a link?

2012-01-03T21:00:00.000Z	batlock		actually that looks pretty straight forward
2012-01-03T21:02:00.000Z	batlock		all you do is shrink your partition, create one for home, then backup and move the home folder over, mark changes in fstab and reboot and pray
2012-01-03T21:02:00.000Z	luca	batlock	i was lucky that with a live boot i managed to reset the settings
2012-01-03T21:03:00.000Z	luca		when i restarted after fo..owing the guide it wouldn't boot
2012-01-03T21:03:00.000Z	luca		and now i dont know why i have my entire hdd full
2012-01-03T21:06:00.000Z	luca	batlock	do you have any ideas?
2012-01-03T21:08:00.000Z	batlock		172.29.x.x is a class B private address isn't it?
2012-01-03T21:08:00.000Z	luca		but i have installed too many services, and now finally i have file sharing set up
2012-01-03T21:08:00.000Z	luca		it took hours
2012-01-03T21:09:00.000Z	batlock	luca	i have no clue as to what happened besides possibly something that could have happened from not copy pasting the instructions he said not to type out
