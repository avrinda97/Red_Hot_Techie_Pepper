2011-08-15T04:57:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Guest47885	it can also be that it is muted... see if you can spot "MM" under the controlers
2011-08-15T04:58:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Guest47885	so there is no "MM" under the volumebars?`
2011-08-15T04:59:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Guest47885	if there is a "MM" then navigate to the volumebar with the left and right arrows and press m to toggle the "MM" away
