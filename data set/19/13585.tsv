2005-03-07T16:08:00.000Z	snarky		hey all, i can't seem to get hardware acceleration on hoary
2005-03-07T16:08:00.000Z	snarky		i'm using nvidia
2005-03-07T16:08:00.000Z	snarky		and when i do the nvidia-glx-config enable step i get errors
2005-03-07T16:08:00.000Z	snarky		(i've installed all the packages for nvidia)
2005-03-07T16:09:00.000Z	snarky		any ideas?
2005-03-07T16:11:00.000Z	snarky		is there anything else i need to do?
2005-03-07T16:12:00.000Z	hawke_	snarky	That's all you should have to do.
2005-03-07T16:12:00.000Z	snarky	hawke_	the X server crashes when i try to open it
2005-03-07T16:13:00.000Z	snarky		yeah it tells you to do nvidia-glx-config enable
2005-03-07T16:13:00.000Z	hawke_	snarky	do you have nvidia-glx installed?
2005-03-07T16:13:00.000Z	snarky		yep all the nvidia stuff
2005-03-07T16:13:00.000Z	hawke_	snarky	And linux-restricted-modules?
2005-03-07T16:14:00.000Z	snarky		yes i do
2005-03-07T16:14:00.000Z	snarky		it kinda cheesed me off cuz i'm on hoary and using the 2.6.8 kernel (sound doesnt work for me on 2.6.10 yet) and i had to carefully go back to the warty mirrors and get 2.6.8 stuff
2005-03-07T16:14:00.000Z	hawke_	snarky	What happens when you run "X" at a command line and then hit ctrl-alt-bksp to kill it?
2005-03-07T16:15:00.000Z	snarky		i had 3d working on hoary the last time i used it
2005-03-07T16:15:00.000Z	snarky	hawke_	that restarts my x server
2005-03-07T16:15:00.000Z	hawke_	snarky	well, I suppose it crashes anyway...but what's the output say
2005-03-07T16:15:00.000Z	hawke_	snarky	what's in /var/log/XFree86.0.log?
