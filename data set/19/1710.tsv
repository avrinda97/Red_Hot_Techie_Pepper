2011-09-16T04:59:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Keep on channel, please.
2011-09-16T05:02:00.000Z	qin	bekor	At this moment, thinking of neat script to prevent and punish someone PM me constantly.
2011-09-16T05:04:00.000Z	qin	bekor	You using Classic gnome not Unity. At login before typing password, at bottom bat choose Unity as your session, ans do not PM people, if not asked
2011-09-16T05:06:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Do not use /msg or /query, just "qin: message here"
2011-09-16T05:07:00.000Z	qin	bekor	See message from ubottu?
2011-09-16T05:07:00.000Z	bekor	qin	my problem is unity is not on my list
2011-09-16T05:08:00.000Z	qin	bekor	What: lsb_release -sc says?
2011-09-16T05:09:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Try to type in terminal: lsb_release -sc
2011-09-16T05:12:00.000Z	qin	bekor	You sure that you type it right?
2011-09-16T05:14:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Ok, in terminal: "sudo apt-get install unity unity-common" or use synaptic to install it.
2011-09-16T05:15:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Unity uses gnome.
2011-09-16T05:15:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Yes it should, have you upgraded from Maveric?
2011-09-16T05:16:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Welcome ;)
2011-09-16T05:19:00.000Z	bekor	qin	does unity need compiz to work?
2011-09-16T05:20:00.000Z	qin	bekor	Yes, but unity-2d does not, or i think so.
