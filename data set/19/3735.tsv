2010-08-02T02:39:00.000Z	fincan		is there any different way from to fstab and manualy to mount dvd's with unhide option?
2010-08-02T02:39:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	Nope, fstab is the way to handle those sort of things.
2010-08-02T02:41:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	Yeah, some gnome magic.  It looks at /etc/fstab and if there is no entry for whatever you're mounting it makes a bunch of assumptions.  In order to change what it does you edit /etc/fstab.  Either that or change the source code and re-compile it to your liking.
2010-08-02T02:42:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	I'm not sure what the unhide option is?  Could you explain that?
2010-08-02T02:44:00.000Z	fincan	edbian	well WoW dvd is mounted with hidden files because of its hybrid structure(PC and MAC). "unhide" option in fstab or mount command shows the hidden files but in this time these files are mounted with different permission option and thats why I can not execut installer
2010-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	So it he problem with the way they're mounted or with file permissions?
2010-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	fincan	edbian	well that s why I wanna learn how dvds are mounted automatically and maybe I can change mount option
2010-08-02T02:46:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	You just add the option to /etc/fstab.  That's the point of the file.  What is this about the permissions being wrong?
2010-08-02T02:47:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	You could look up the source code.  I'm not even sure what package that's in though.  And you'd probably be in waaaay over you're head unless you're a seasoned developer.
2010-08-02T02:47:00.000Z	fincan	edbian	when dvd is mounted with fstab entry, files are under strane permission as "user 501" :) and wine can not execut installer
2010-08-02T02:48:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	What folder is the dvd mounted into?  Check the permissions on that folder while the DVD is unmounted.
2010-08-02T02:49:00.000Z	fincan	edbian	I tried change permission the folder but files were mounted with the same permission
2010-08-02T02:49:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	What options are you using in your /etc/fstab
2010-08-02T02:50:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	I'm not sure then?  :(
2010-08-02T02:51:00.000Z	fincan	edbian	could u tell me how gnome mounts dvds cds automatically without fstab entry?
2010-08-02T02:51:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	I don't really know.  Like I said, I don't even know what package it is in.
2010-08-02T02:51:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	Sorry :(  This is as far as my expertise goes! :(
2010-08-02T02:52:00.000Z	fincan	edbian	thx anyway :)
2010-08-02T02:52:00.000Z	edbian	fincan	Good luck!
