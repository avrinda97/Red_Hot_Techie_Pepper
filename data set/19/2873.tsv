2010-01-12T06:06:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	edit the names and artists but it wont let me
2010-01-12T06:06:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	which program are you using?
2010-01-12T06:07:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	rhythmbox
2010-01-12T06:08:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	there are some formats that rhythmbox cant or wont change the details of. I can fully manipulate anything that is .ogg
2010-01-12T06:09:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	dang all of mine are m4a or mp3, but do you know another good program/
2010-01-12T06:11:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	when I dual booted I played with Songbird. It seems to have good community support and features. I got the children off itunes and onto Songbird and they like.
2010-01-12T06:12:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	k thanks
2010-01-12T06:12:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	do you also use windows?
2010-01-12T06:13:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	ya i have dual boot, but i dont get on windows that much
2010-01-12T06:14:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	If you check out Songbird, beware that you can't share the music library with both systems, you will need to maintain two libraries (one of the reasons I left).
2010-01-12T06:16:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	ya i did play with that and songbird doesn't work with anything else. Do you know anything about amarok?
2010-01-12T06:18:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	No. I have stopped searching for music programs as Rythymbox covers my personal needs. Have you read the forums?
2010-01-12T06:19:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	I'm reading them now.
2010-01-12T06:20:00.000Z	quietone	chasedawg1	happy reading. i'm off now
2010-01-12T06:21:00.000Z	chasedawg1	quietone	k thanks
