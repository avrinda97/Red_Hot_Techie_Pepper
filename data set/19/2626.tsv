2010-02-14T12:31:00.000Z	ghesquiere		Hey guys. Just want some help about my monitor. I just switched monitors and the right resolutions aren't showing up. I already ran sudo nvidia-xconfig and configured xorg.conf but the correct resolutions still aren't showing up in nVidia X-Server Settings. Anyone who can help me?
2010-02-14T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 gksudo nvidia-settings dosent show the proper res's ?
2010-02-14T12:36:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	if it helps here's my xorg.conf: http://pastebin.com/f7b4dc07e
2010-02-14T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 what was the actual problem?
2010-02-14T12:38:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	xorg.conf modes not showing up in nvidia settings.
2010-02-14T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 nvidia settings tool probes the monitors i think it dosent use the ones from xorg.conf
2010-02-14T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 you could try removing xorg.conf (rename it) and rerun nvidia-settings tool to let it remake it
2010-02-14T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 the nvidia-xconfig tool is a little old ane may be making a bad config
2010-02-14T12:39:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	Ok. Thanks. I'll try that.
2010-02-14T13:01:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	I was the one who was having monitor resolutions problems earlier. You told me to rename xorg.conf and run nvidia-settings. I did as you told me but the correct resolutions are still aren't showing up. I rebooted my pc and saw the nVidia driver was deactivated so I reinstalled and the right resolutions are still not there.
2010-02-14T13:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 the drivers are activated now?  if they keep getting deactivated on reboot.. thats going to be aproblem
2010-02-14T13:02:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	yeah I activated after I rebooted my pc. What should I do?
2010-02-14T13:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 not sure. I rarely have any issuesd with my 3 mvidia machines.
2010-02-14T13:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 what video card?
2010-02-14T13:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 if you activate after reboot.. you need to restart X or perhaps reboot.
2010-02-14T13:04:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	Yeah, I already rebooted after reactivating it. I'm using GEForce2 MX/Mx 400.
2010-02-14T13:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 thats an old card aint it. :(
2010-02-14T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ghesquiere	 i recall in ages past a lot of issues with 'MX' cards
2010-02-14T13:05:00.000Z	ghesquiere	Dr_Willis	Yeah, it is. :( But I used to use to this monitor in the same CPU but this is the first time I've encountered this problem.
