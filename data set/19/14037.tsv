2006-04-26T08:41:00.000Z	freakabcd		essentially an insterface to the available system tools
2006-04-26T08:42:00.000Z	freakabcd		anyway, yast is just an interface to the actual tools. there isn;t an equivalent on ubuntu from what i know. but you can run the separate utilities yourself
2006-04-26T08:42:00.000Z	freakabcd		for example, network config:: network-admin, etc.
2006-04-26T08:43:00.000Z	freakabcd		haha
2006-04-26T08:44:00.000Z	freakabcd		no..
2006-04-26T08:44:00.000Z	freakabcd		those windows admins in small companies who are used to clicking all the way won;t even give ubuntu a go!
2006-04-26T08:45:00.000Z	Xenguy	freakabcd	ridiculous
2006-04-26T08:45:00.000Z	Xenguy		!tell sharp about root
2006-04-26T08:45:00.000Z	freakabcd	Xenguy	really? how many windows-click admins you know want to edit config files by hand and no less on ubuntu?
2006-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	freakabcd	I really don't care if d0ze admins are so lame
2006-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	freakabcd	Xenguy	one of the reasons you will not advocate ubuntu to small folk.
2006-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	freakabcd	if you can't/won't edit a file, then what is there to say?
2006-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	freakabcd		well, not really.. more like you'll not be heard
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	freakabcd		no. i'm not saying _won't_ edit a file
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	freakabcd	such unwillingness to learn is absurd
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	freakabcd		i'm saying .. ''will be aggressively against change''
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	freakabcd	the whole system supports the status quo unfortunately
2006-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	freakabcd	Xenguy	provide me with an answer to this: "Why the hell is there a network-admin package provided?"
2006-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	freakabcd	what is the real question?
