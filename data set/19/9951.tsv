2006-08-27T08:21:00.000Z	lupine_85		it's huge
2006-08-27T08:23:00.000Z	lupine_85		something isn't matching up... according to df, you've got an 800MB hard drive. According to fdisk, it's 246GB
2006-08-27T08:24:00.000Z	lupine_85		(s/hard drive/partition/)
2006-08-27T08:24:00.000Z	lupine_85		kde is better ;) /flame
2006-08-27T08:25:00.000Z	lupine_85		 Madeye: TBH your best bet will be to burn your current files to a CD, and start from scratch
2006-08-27T08:26:00.000Z	lupine_85		something is seriously wrong with that partition scheme
2006-08-27T08:26:00.000Z	lupine_85		you could try e2fsresize
2006-08-27T08:26:00.000Z	lupine_85		but that could ust make it worse
2006-08-27T08:27:00.000Z	lupine_85		different features :)
2006-08-27T08:27:00.000Z	lupine_85		joe, vi, nano are all ok as well
2006-08-27T08:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	vi sucks, vim is significantly improved :)
2006-08-27T08:28:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	SBC?
2006-08-27T08:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	You'd probably prefer to use alternatives to vi.
2006-08-27T08:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	Ahh, well, that's the deal breaker :)
2006-09-08T15:06:00.000Z	lupine_85	Arafangion	#ubuntu+1
2006-09-08T15:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	That's what I thought, but it is evidently loaded, anyway, I'm in +1 now.
2006-09-08T15:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	Is #ubuntu+1 normally _very_ slow?
2006-09-08T15:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	lupine_85	At this stage, it's looking like it's a channel in which you wait for half-hour or so, then _maybe_ get a response.
2006-09-08T15:16:00.000Z	lupine_85	Arafangion	you could always submit a bug report
