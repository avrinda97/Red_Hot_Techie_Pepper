2006-01-26T16:37:00.000Z	turbofisk		howdi
2006-01-26T16:37:00.000Z	turbofisk		I installed windows and it fucked up my mbr... how do I get it back?
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	Gumby	turbofisk	are you booted into linux now?
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	turbofisk		no
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	turbofisk		I can on tops get the cd to boot
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	turbofisk		but I don't know what the kernel that's autoloaded is called
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	turbofisk		I need to run grub again I guess
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	turbofisk		tried vmlinuz, but that obviously didn't work
2006-01-26T16:39:00.000Z	turbofisk		bootline: vmlinuz /dev/sda1
2006-01-26T16:39:00.000Z	Gumby	turbofisk	indeed you do.  you'll need to boot from a linux cd and then chroot your / directory.  Probably /proc as well
2006-01-26T16:39:00.000Z	turbofisk		but how do I do that?
2006-01-26T16:41:00.000Z	turbofisk	Gumby	so how do I find out what the cd boots as it's kernel?
2006-01-26T16:42:00.000Z	Gumby	turbofisk	thats somewhat irrelivant.  google chroot howto and follow the instructions you see
2006-01-26T16:42:00.000Z	turbofisk		ok
2006-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	turbofisk	Gumby	I remember that in slack you could tell it that the root what something else
2006-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	turbofisk		so you get your own enviroment back and could run all your old stuff
2006-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	turbofisk		just not with the right kernel
2006-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	turbofisk		which would suit me fine
2006-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	Gumby	turbofisk	may I message you
