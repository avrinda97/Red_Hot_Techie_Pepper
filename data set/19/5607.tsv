2009-05-07T08:38:00.000Z	su		would you know by chance how to make panels reappear?
2009-05-07T08:38:00.000Z	su		i had 3, removed 1 and they all disappeared
2009-05-07T08:38:00.000Z	su		xfce
2009-05-07T08:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	su	xfce4-panel
2009-05-07T08:40:00.000Z	su		hmm..says failed to execute child process
2009-05-07T08:41:00.000Z	su	toddy	pidgin supports the M$ messenging
2009-05-07T08:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	su	might be something stuck, killall xfce4-panel and try starting it up again
2009-05-07T08:42:00.000Z	su		says no process killed
2009-05-07T08:42:00.000Z	su		are there any dashes or anything to type along with the command?

2009-05-07T08:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	su	is this a persistent issue ? i mean, do you get the panels back after a logout/login ?
2009-05-07T08:42:00.000Z	su		nope
2009-05-07T08:43:00.000Z	su		no panels after reboot
