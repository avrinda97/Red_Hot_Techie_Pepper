2009-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	brandon___	jamiejackson	i tryed editing it in /usr/local/ircd/ect/ircd.conf
2009-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	brandon___	jamiejackson	i tryed editing it in /usr/local/ircd/ect/
2009-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	brandon___		but i go that error
2009-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	jamiejackson		where are you trying to create it, brandon___ (and what are you going to do with this file, it's pretty odd to just want to create a blank file)
2009-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	brandon___	jamiejackson	i am basicly trying to put ircd.conf in that location
2009-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	brandon___	jamiejackson	in this location /usr/local/ircd/ect/ircd.conf
