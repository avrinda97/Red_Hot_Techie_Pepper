2007-10-21T06:53:00.000Z	Anick		Can any one help me with getting beryl install on ubuntu 7.10? I've install ubuntu about 5 time today.
2007-10-21T06:54:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	beryl no longer is relevant. beryl and compiz merged to become compiz-fusion
2007-10-21T06:55:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	ok im try to install the compiz thing but it will not let me enable the visual effects
2007-10-21T06:55:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	well, that has to do with your video card driver
2007-10-21T06:57:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	I have a ati 9800 and i've let ubuntu install the driver and it did not work plus i've downloaded the ones from ATI and i get the same thing
2007-10-21T06:58:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	have you checked this out...https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2007-10-21T06:59:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	any way you can private msg me
2007-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	no. I don't know much about getting fglrx working on ATI cards
2007-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	ok
2007-10-21T07:30:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	i've tried that and no luck with enable the visual effects
2007-10-21T07:50:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	doubtful
2007-10-21T07:50:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	im rdy to pull my hair out lol
2007-10-21T07:51:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	it's just eye candy? If you just want eye candy, get a caleidoscope :)
2007-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	I got sick of being unable to use my ATI card with compiz, so I went out and bought an nvidia
2007-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	yeah guess that is what i will do
2007-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	any suggest on VC that is easy to run it with
2007-10-21T07:57:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	I have an EVGA 8600 at work, and an EVGA 7600 at home - both worked with no tweaking
2007-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	Anick	Vlet	so after the install you could just enable the effects
2007-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	Vlet	Anick	I installed, the "restricted drivers are available" thing popped up, clicked it, enabled, restarted and compiz was working
