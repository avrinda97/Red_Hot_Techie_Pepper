2005-04-01T14:07:00.000Z	cusco		can you tell me how do I make the sshd server listen on 25 instead of 22 or both of them?
2005-04-01T14:08:00.000Z	Dillweed	cusco	i believe you can chagne the settings in the sshd_config file
2005-04-01T14:08:00.000Z	Dillweed	cusco	that file should be located in the /etc/sshd/ folder
2005-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	Dillweed	cusco	then restart the sshd server
2005-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	cusco	Dillweed	but I haven't install a sshd server yet... which one should I install?
2005-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	cusco		webmin-sshd
2005-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	cusco		ssh-krb5
2005-04-01T14:10:00.000Z	cusco		openssh-server
2005-04-01T14:10:00.000Z	cusco		ok
2005-04-01T14:10:00.000Z	Dillweed	cusco	you need the server.  The webmin-sshd is the frontend.  I'm not sure in ubuntu which to install.  but it looks like jdub has the answer
