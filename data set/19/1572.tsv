2011-01-12T00:55:00.000Z	Inphernal		Hi, my onboard USB stopped working suddenly =[ Can anyone help me troubleshoot?
2011-01-12T00:55:00.000Z	hi5	Inphernal	all of them?
2011-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	hi5	Inphernal	very strange
2011-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	They show up in windows device manager as working fine
2011-01-12T00:58:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	No, I checked, I thought it may have been a Win Update at first but none
2011-01-12T00:59:00.000Z	hi5	Inphernal	so usb ' es does NOT run from WIN7?
2011-01-12T01:00:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	It does not
2011-01-12T01:01:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	I updated the bios after it stopped working, thinking that might fix it
2011-01-12T01:03:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	The only USB setting in the bios is the legacy one, and that's been set to enabled always
2011-01-12T01:04:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Should I try disabling legacy?
2011-01-12T01:05:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Ok, I'm going to try that BRB
2011-01-12T01:07:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Didn't help
2011-01-12T01:08:00.000Z	hi5	Inphernal	can you assume for sure that key IS bootable?
2011-01-12T01:08:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	You mean can I boot from USB?
2011-01-12T01:10:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Hmm, I'll try that, I have a ubuntu live image somewhere
2011-01-12T01:10:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Yeah, if it won't boot I'm just gonna take it to BestBuy, the laptop should still be under warranty
2011-01-12T01:11:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Off to make that boot usb, we'll see
2011-01-12T01:11:00.000Z	hi5	Inphernal	i would have done the same
2011-01-12T01:11:00.000Z	Inphernal	hi5	Thank you for your help
