2006-08-03T10:52:00.000Z	matodo		I have a problem with Thunderbird
2006-08-03T10:52:00.000Z	matodo		(Tools->Options->Display->Fonts) I can't find The Arabic (Windows-1256) Encoding :(
2006-08-03T10:52:00.000Z	matodo		Please help
2006-08-03T10:53:00.000Z	maccam94	matodo	or install foreign language packs
2006-08-03T10:53:00.000Z	matodo		no.. the fonts are already installed
2006-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	matodo		no that isn't the problem
2006-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	matodo		The question is how to add an encoding
2006-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	matodo		to Thundrbird
2006-08-03T10:55:00.000Z	maccam94	matodo	i believe you can't just add an encoding to it, i think there are packages that specifically add foreign languages and encodings to the program
2006-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	maccam94	matodo	use Synaptic to search for Thunderbird, and look at all of the packages
2006-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	matodo		ok
2006-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	matodo		do you know a Thunderbird IRC channel ?
2006-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	maccam94	matodo	the closest thing i see on this server is #mozilla, but it looks unofficial and idle
2006-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	matodo	maccam94	yes
2006-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	matodo		what about other servers ?
2006-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	maccam94		i don't know. check the mozilla website, they may say under the "contact us" or "help" or some similar page
2006-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	matodo		ok
2006-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	matodo	maccam94	send to me a private message
