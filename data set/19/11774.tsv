2005-12-22T11:02:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		how come when I say "loadkeys us" it says "Couldnt get a file descriptor referring to the console" ?
2005-12-22T11:04:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	usually that means it is running in the background
2005-12-22T11:05:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	sethk	what should I do about it?  I'd like to change my keyboard layout at the low level SDL seems to care about
2005-12-22T11:06:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	did you try running it from a console logged in as root?  That is, control-alt-f1 to get to a console, log in as root, run it?
2005-12-22T11:06:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	sethk	it runs from console as a normal user, but not a console under X
2005-12-22T11:07:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	sethk	but I can't run the SDL program under console =P
2005-12-22T11:07:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	ah, you can get a terminal window that thinks it is a console.
2005-12-22T11:07:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	sethk	how do I do that?
2005-12-22T11:07:00.000Z	sethk		in KDE there is a menu item for that.  There must be one for gnome, also
2005-12-22T11:07:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	it's an argument to the command to start the terminal program.
2005-12-22T11:08:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	sethk	can you paste the command it calls?
2005-12-22T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	let me look on my machine running KDE, I'll see if I can find the command.
2005-12-22T11:09:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	sethk	thanks.  You can just pull the launcher out of its menu and check its properties for the command
2005-12-22T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	right, on the system that has the command.
2005-12-22T11:09:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		mmhmm
2005-12-22T11:10:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	the problem is, the command is off the session menu on konsole, not off a system menu
2005-12-22T11:10:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		oh
2005-12-22T11:10:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		maybe I'll just get konsole then
2005-12-22T11:10:00.000Z	sethk	tiglionabbit	that might be easier.
