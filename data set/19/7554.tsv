2008-08-04T11:29:00.000Z	evo		i downloaded ubuntu (cd installer), burned to cd, booted, and am greeted by grub>
2008-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	evo		and then, I figured it would be a little more str8forward
2008-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	what are the options given by the grub?
2008-08-04T11:32:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	are u sure it is a grub not installation menu where the first option is "load linux" or something like that
2008-08-04T11:32:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	does ur grub show any image ?
2008-08-04T11:33:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	starburn is  the best option in xp
2008-08-04T11:35:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	also after burning load it in xp and what is inside. most probably u will get wubi installer which is pretty easy
2008-08-04T11:36:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	no
2008-08-04T11:37:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	before burning it u can load the iso too from starburn
2008-08-04T11:38:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	if it is about bras then just change ur user mode to +E
2008-08-04T11:38:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	k
2008-08-04T11:40:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	type /quoto mode evo +E
2008-08-04T11:44:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	disc at once
2008-08-04T11:45:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	it is always better to burn distro disk at 4x if possible
2008-08-04T11:45:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	buy what?
2008-08-04T11:48:00.000Z	murlidhar	evo	i think i have to go now . u can always ask others
