2007-08-07T06:22:00.000Z	Andeh		How do I change my hostname on IRC?
2007-08-07T06:23:00.000Z	Andeh		i've seen some people have something like name@customhost
2007-08-07T06:23:00.000Z	Andeh		but mine is just andy@myisp
2007-08-07T06:23:00.000Z	Andeh		how can I change it?
2007-08-07T06:23:00.000Z	Andeh		p?
2007-08-07T06:23:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	not many, its usually a server thing.. can't remember whats the freenopde policy for it
2008-02-17T18:59:00.000Z	Andeh	faileas	maybe he means formatting?
2008-02-17T19:00:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	its a very important distinction
2008-02-17T19:04:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	mercury supports video for MSN i think
2008-02-17T19:05:00.000Z	Andeh	faileas	Great. Can YOU help get my cam working then?
2008-02-17T19:05:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	the cam itself, no experience. It has to play nice with windows too ;p
2008-02-17T19:06:00.000Z	Andeh	faileas	It works fine on windows. Not broken. Should work out of the box. Yet none of the programs can access the video device. Wtf?
2008-02-17T19:07:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	in which case... its probably the camera. tried googleing to see if anyone else got it to work in linux?
2008-02-17T19:08:00.000Z	Andeh	faileas	hmm..
2008-02-17T19:09:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	which meant switching to jabber for video wouldn't have done shoit ;p
2008-02-17T19:13:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	yup
2008-02-17T19:14:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	you can. how easy/powerful it is depends on what server you choose
2008-02-17T19:15:00.000Z	faileas	Andeh	if you choose to federate, its transparent
