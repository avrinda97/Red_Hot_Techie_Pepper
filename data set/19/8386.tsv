2007-04-15T11:58:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	true, but he has to figure out your username first (admitly easy)
2007-04-15T11:59:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	thats OK, I havent done it yet (new install) but i turn off password auth for SSH (public key only) and i try to keep all the other hatches buttoned down
2007-04-15T12:05:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	just as fast, yes. Safer? Not a whole lot, when you look at the whole picture
2007-04-15T12:05:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	sure, they have to find your username rather than just guess at root... but how hard is it to find that?
2007-04-15T12:06:00.000Z	Nubbie	draeath	when you're logged in as root, any script or virus for that matter can destroy your computer. when you run something as sudo, the virus or whatever will still need to login as root to do anything.
2007-04-15T12:07:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	provided you haven't sudo'd recently...
2007-04-15T12:07:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	I use sudo a LOT. but I'm careful what I type.
2007-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	Nubbie	draeath	um no we don't, because we have BANSHEE:)
2007-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	quark

2007-04-15T12:16:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	/ignore works good :)
2007-04-15T12:16:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	I'm just as irritated as him but I vote that he can stay untill he breaks rules
2007-04-15T12:17:00.000Z	Nubbie	draeath	offtopic ?
2007-04-15T12:26:00.000Z	Nubbie	draeath	master shake is king.
2007-04-15T12:30:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	well, he cant get in to find out, so he just went somewhere where he could find help :)
2007-04-15T12:30:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	all he needed was a proxy to ask for him :P
2007-04-15T13:06:00.000Z	draeath	Nubbie	fat16 and small, just enough to boot up to something else. think /boot for windows
2007-04-15T13:07:00.000Z	Nubbie	draeath	$5 says his vendor has been spying on him using that partition :)
