2004-11-06T14:19:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	what if he tries to mount the XP partition to verify that it is there
2004-11-06T14:19:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	smart thinking
2004-11-06T14:22:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	XP uses NTFS would this not be issue when mounting using VFAT ? should throw errors
2004-11-06T14:23:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	should throw error
2004-11-06T14:25:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	he should veirfy with df -k
2004-11-06T14:26:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	it's not yet mounted
2004-11-06T14:26:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	ah yes
2004-11-06T14:27:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	ls works as fine, because you can see the content
2004-11-06T14:27:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	sure..
2004-11-06T14:31:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	good call...
2004-11-06T14:33:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	or simply go inti gedit and do open file then navigate to file
2004-11-06T14:33:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	yeah should work as well
2004-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	but sudo is important though
2004-11-06T14:34:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	aah yes I forgot
2004-11-06T14:44:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	ubuntu compared to debian
2004-11-06T15:04:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	the worst it that XP is no longer bootable because of MBR being gone, this can be rebuilt using the XP CD and doing a rescue procedure on the XP installation... if this is XP Pro then its available else not
2004-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	aardvark	stvn	but won't this negate GRUB  ?
2004-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	nope, since it wasn't there in the first place
2004-11-06T15:14:00.000Z	stvn	aardvark	/dev/hda5 is ntfs, what is the other one?
