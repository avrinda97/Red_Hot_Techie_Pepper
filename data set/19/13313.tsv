2005-08-04T05:16:00.000Z	witless		does anyone know how to fix the slow networking problem?  i disabled ipv6, still takes 20 secs to get a web page to come up
2005-08-04T05:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	in firefox ?
2005-08-04T05:17:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	all network apps
2005-08-04T05:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	you sure ipv6 has been disabled ?? do lsmod | grep ip     to be sure
2005-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	i'm in debian-side ATM but i renamed ipv6.ko and rebooted
2005-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	that should do it
2005-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	didn't  :-(
2005-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	your debina box is working ok ?
2005-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	err debian
2005-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	yeah, fine
2005-08-04T06:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	sure there is
2005-08-04T06:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	there is no differnce :D
2005-08-04T06:06:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	sure there is.  Pause pauses in the middle of a song, Stop stops playing a song.
2005-08-04T06:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	the end result of the action is the music stops ....pause allows you to resume ....stop does not :)
2005-08-04T06:10:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	and what happens when i press play again?
2005-08-04T06:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	all you have to do is cleick the next song you want to play
2005-08-04T06:11:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	well, that's odd, because i expected it to Stop, therefore pressing play again should start from the beginning.
2005-08-04T06:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	witless	either drag the slider back to the start of the song or double click it
2005-08-04T06:11:00.000Z	witless	LinuxJones	it's possible, i'm simply pointing out that it's a stupid design decision
