2007-08-14T06:10:00.000Z	P_Kable		Anybody HELP please ... I have an external Sony DVD burner that does not mount automatically. I have to reboot the machine everytime I plug it in. It used to work well a few weeks ago ...
2007-08-14T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	first check is to run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' in a terminal, then plug it in. See if any errors are logged.
2007-08-14T06:13:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	did you read me?
2007-08-14T06:15:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	looks okay to me. What's the problem at this point?
2007-08-14T06:16:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	explain "does not mount". Is there a disk in the drive?
2007-08-14T06:17:00.000Z	P_Kable	soundray	in order to have to blank dvd icon on the desktop I have to reboot.
2007-08-14T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	look at the settings under System-Preferences-Removable Drives
2007-08-14T06:19:00.000Z	P_Kable	soundray	everything is OK I did not touch anything here, and it works with my 16gb usb stick
2007-08-14T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	does the icon appear if you open, then close the tray?
2007-08-14T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	have you tried with a data CD instead of a blank? Any messages in /var/log/syslog after the tray closes?
2007-08-14T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	syslog?
2007-08-14T06:22:00.000Z	P_Kable	soundray	nothing in syslog
2007-08-14T06:24:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	does anything happen when you do 'sudo eject /dev/sr0' while  the tray is closed?
2007-08-14T06:25:00.000Z	P_Kable	soundray	it ejects the tray

2007-09-28T16:02:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	no, there are various packages. apt-cache search festival
2008-10-18T01:22:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	it's also wrong. You should have either relattime or noatime, not both. noatime is in the wrong place.
2008-10-18T01:23:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	relatime
2008-10-18T01:24:00.000Z	soundray	P_Kable	you haven't told me what your problem is
