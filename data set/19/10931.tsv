2006-04-21T11:57:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	thaht doesn't help me.. :P
2006-07-05T14:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	".bin" just means binary. Usually it is an executable program but it could describe anything
2006-07-05T14:18:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	it's an image from a cd.. I want to emulate it.. how ?
2006-07-05T14:19:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	If you can convert it to an iso (aks someone else :) ) then you can mount it with the loopback device (mount -o loop) or you can emulate it with qemu
2006-07-05T14:19:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	ok but can I use wine to emulate it ?
2006-07-05T14:20:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	Probably, if you tell WINE the mountpoint of the image
2006-07-05T14:20:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	like --> wine /home/inazad/image.bin /mnt/virtual ??
2006-07-05T14:20:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	like --> wine /home/inazad/image.bin /mnt/virtual -o loop^ ?
2006-07-05T14:21:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	It would be something like "sudo mount /home/inazad/image.iso /mnt/virtual -o loop" (after converting it) then giving WINE the path "/mnt/virtual" as a CD drive
2006-07-05T14:22:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	ok... so I have ton convert my .bin file into an .iso, right ?
2006-07-05T14:22:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	Qemu is an emulator. If it a bootable CD then you can use it in Qemu, or if it isn't then install Windows in Qemu and run it like a regular CD in that (but it will still need to be an iso)
2006-07-05T14:23:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	answer my question please
2006-07-05T14:23:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	an "iso" is just a dump of the contents of a CD. Your "bin" will probably not be that, so it may need converting. If you know what type of program made it then that would help
2006-07-05T14:24:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	I don't know which program to use to convert my .bin to an .iso ... HELP!!!
2006-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	Neither do I :) (I will do a quick Synaptic search)
2006-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	ok thanks
2006-07-05T14:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Inazad	"bchunk" looks promising, but I have no .bin or .cue to test it with
2006-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	Inazad	Warbo	ok thanks
