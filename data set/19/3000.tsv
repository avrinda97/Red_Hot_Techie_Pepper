2009-11-17T01:30:00.000Z	fiberfolly		I am really frustrated right now.  I'm seriously thinking aobut redoing my computer with a dual boot so I can access the few programs I actually like that are writting for windose
2009-11-17T01:31:00.000Z	fiberfolly		Ubuntu is supposed to be linux for human beings, but you still have to know more than the average user to do everything that you want
2009-11-17T01:31:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	what if "everything you want" is confined to browsing the web, editing some documents, and sending/receiving email?
2009-11-17T01:32:00.000Z	fiberfolly	bradland	you can do that easily with ubuntu
2009-11-17T01:32:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	that's kind of my point.
2009-11-17T01:32:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	you said "but you still have to know more than the average user to do everything that you want"
2009-11-17T01:33:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	mint.com
2009-11-17T01:37:00.000Z	fiberfolly	bradland	 mint looks like it is all online
2009-11-17T01:37:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	it is, and it's the best personal finance software made ;)
2009-11-17T01:37:00.000Z	fiberfolly	bradland	don't feel safe giving a third party access to my account info
2009-11-17T01:38:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	too late. if you're doing online banking, you can be virtually guaranteed that "third-parties" have access to your account info
2009-11-17T01:39:00.000Z	fiberfolly	bradland	 How so?
2009-11-17T01:41:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	Cale: My point is that your bank isn't the only one involved in electronic transactions for your account. If you chose not to use Mint.com on the basis that they have access to you bank account, then you ought to re-evaluate using electonic banking at all. Many banks don't even handle their own authentication; they outsource it to the same firms that Mint.com uses.
2009-11-17T01:42:00.000Z	fiberfolly	bradland	 do you have a link fo rmore info on mint.com?
2009-11-17T01:43:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	not handy, but before i decided to use them, i looked in to how they handle authentication, where my credentials were stored, and what type of access they had.
2009-11-17T01:43:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	they outsource the authentication to another company that does pretty much just that: secure banking authentication
2009-11-17T01:44:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	your credentials aren't actually stored. just like ssh-keypairs, the authentication provider receives a key that is used to retrieve your account details. this key is revokable by your bank
2009-11-17T01:44:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	also, the information is read-only, so you can't issue payments, but you're also protected from fraud
2009-11-17T01:44:00.000Z	bradland	fiberfolly	np, and sry for off-topic to the rest of you :)
