2010-09-23T21:35:00.000Z	Aqaz	Dr_Willis	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal ... It gives basic commands, but not system commands or other useful commands like initramfs
2010-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	Aqaz	Dr_Willis	Can you help me on that?
2010-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Aqaz	 all i can say is use google to search for docs ont eh stuff you are interested in.. theres no 'all inclusive' doc  for everything.
2010-09-23T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Aqaz	 the same applies to just about any topic you would want to learn about really....
2010-09-23T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Aqaz	 theres dozens of books written about bash.. and doezn more books written on system admin stuff
2010-09-23T21:38:00.000Z	Aqaz	Dr_Willis	Yep.. agreed that commands as i said initramfs should have documentation
2010-09-23T21:39:00.000Z	Aqaz	Dr_Willis	kk.. then could you suggest one//
