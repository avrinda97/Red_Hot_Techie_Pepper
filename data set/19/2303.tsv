2011-09-17T04:07:00.000Z	shadows090		i know this isn't a server irc channel, but is anybody here *really* familiar with servers?
2011-09-17T04:07:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	That's an amazingly open question!
2011-09-17T04:08:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	yeah i know. i'm having to set up two rack servers, but i'm stuck on what hardware to get though
2011-09-17T04:08:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	I guess it's internal, and not through a provider?
2011-09-17T04:10:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	correct. i'm familiar with setting up servers (all of the os and software), but i don't know what sort of hardware would be required
2011-09-17T04:11:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	i'd be running about 4-5 vhosts on each one, magento installations (which are pretty demanding)
2011-09-17T04:13:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	See, normally I'd ask the people I was hosting the server with for advice... ;)
2011-09-17T04:14:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	lol yeah that's not a bad idea. we're moving our dev and staging servers away from hosting though, and moving to in house.
2011-09-17T04:27:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	I find having an under-powered dev and stage server with poor optimisation (like low key buffer and no query cache on your sql) is a good thing. It forces you to write better code, and only makes your live system work better in the end
2011-09-17T04:27:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	Infact, I've purposefully crippled my apache/mysql on my development servers
2011-09-17T04:28:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	i appreciate the advice. how did you cripple apache/mysql?
2011-09-17T04:29:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	As mentioned, low buffers and set query cache to on-demand only, kept the apache threads low etc
2011-09-17T04:30:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	I also turned PHP's magic quotes on, so I know my scripts will work around it
2011-09-17T04:30:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	ah ok. our (small) team just develops magento (a shopping cart platform if you're not familiar with it) so when we develop we turn caching off (for other reason). It does make it dirt slow though, even on powerful dedicated servers
2011-09-17T04:31:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	Ahh, I've developed my own shopping cart platform. Yes, I'm a masochist.
2011-09-17T04:32:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	lol i've considered making one in python, or extending a current framework into a shopping cart platform. I'm not really that good yet though
2011-09-17T04:33:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	I consider myself an expert PHP developer, and have a mental problem that I always use my own code...
2011-09-17T04:35:00.000Z	shadows090	computerx	well its great to know the internals of code though. Sometimes it's best to just write your own, instead of take the time to understand someone else's.  I'm still not that great with php, or programming in general. I really do enjoy working with magento though, and the zend framework
2011-09-17T04:37:00.000Z	computerx	shadows090	It's gotten to the point where I hate working with other people's code. I even wrote my own bbcode parser...
