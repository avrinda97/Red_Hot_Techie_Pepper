2011-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	jack123		whats the difference between fedora n ubuntu
2011-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	the majority are easy to install these days and easy to use so it doesent really matter check distro watch have a read see which one you fancy really, the only ones not for noobs is slackware and maybe arch
2011-05-03T09:55:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	the main diffs fedora is blleding edge they update packages without considering stability (as its red hats test platform) they use rpm instead of deb
2011-05-03T09:59:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	if you have got used to mandriva then fedora might be your best bet as like mandriva is based on red hat
2011-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	if you want to try ubuntu I suggest 10.04
2011-05-03T10:09:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	can your network adapters handle 4 gig?
2011-05-03T10:20:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	try the kernel ending -29
2011-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	use the one ending -29 theres been 2 relesed since
2011-05-03T10:23:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	if you want to troubleshoot properly use the older kernel and work from there
2011-05-03T11:08:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	reinstall you did soemething wrong last time getting to the bottom of what would take longer than a reinstall
2011-05-03T11:11:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	top and copy the main bit at the top if that makes any sense
2011-05-03T11:19:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	 2.6.38-8-generic  what install are you using?
2011-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	if you cant get ubuntu to work forget Linux
2011-05-03T13:48:00.000Z	Herbs	jack123	stick to what works for you then learn Linux more then decide
