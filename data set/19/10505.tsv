2007-02-25T17:52:00.000Z	bruenig		ah
2007-02-25T08:33:00.000Z	bruenig		!apt-get
2007-02-25T08:34:00.000Z	bruenig		it says adept
2007-02-25T08:34:00.000Z	bruenig		apt-get is easier
2007-02-25T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig		apt-get is better
2007-02-25T08:37:00.000Z	kevogod	bruenig	And why is apt-get better than aptitude?
2007-02-25T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	you initiated so I am going to say that you have the burden here
2007-02-25T08:37:00.000Z	kevogod	bruenig	Aptitude remembers dependencies while apt-get does not.
2007-02-25T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	apt-get does too, you ever seen apt-get autoremove
2007-02-25T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	but with autoremove, it gives you the option of removing dependencies, on aptitude it does not, more options = better, therefore
2007-02-25T08:38:00.000Z	kevogod	bruenig	Aptitude does not require you to remove the dependencies.
2007-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	when you do aptitude remove, it removes the dependencies automatically
2007-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	kevogod	bruenig	Yes, but you can make it not do that.
2007-02-25T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	ok well then they are equal, and you haven't met your burden
2007-02-25T08:40:00.000Z	kevogod	bruenig	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/75882
2007-02-25T08:41:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	that was one incident, not something widespread nor anything significant
2007-02-25T08:42:00.000Z	kevogod	bruenig	Aptitude provides a text interface while apt-get does not. If you concede they are equal in terms of functionality then aptitude is better because of this.
2007-02-25T08:42:00.000Z	bruenig	kevogod	the text interface is pointless and cluttered and not useful
