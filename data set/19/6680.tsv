2007-12-28T09:53:00.000Z	Blazer11		xorg does not scan past pci domain 0000, my graphics card is on 0001
2007-12-28T09:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	is the PCI ID set in the xorg.conf file?
2007-12-28T09:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	mkay, are you trying to do a dual-head display?
2007-12-28T09:58:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	you're still being vague - could you please pastebin the output of this command: lspci | grep VGA

2007-12-28T10:15:00.000Z	Blazer11	Gnea	do u see wht im talkin bout
2007-12-28T10:16:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	no not really - it looks like you have a single video card going to just one monitor, right?
2007-12-28T10:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	yeah so that's built-in or is it a separate card?
2007-12-28T10:18:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	if that's the case, then xorg shouldn't care - it should find it and deal with it at installation
2007-12-28T10:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	have you tried commenting-out the PCI ID line in the xorg.conf file and pressing ctrl-alt-backspace?
2007-12-28T10:20:00.000Z	Blazer11	Gnea	read up http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=458297

2007-12-28T10:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	this channel is pretty much x86-based
2007-12-28T10:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	have you just tried apt-get install xserver-xfree86?
2007-12-28T10:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Blazer11	silly question - are you using the ReferenceClock option?
