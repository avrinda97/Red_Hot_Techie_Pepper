2009-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	smr904		does anybody know how to make the screen resolution permanent? - each time I log in I have a 1025x768 res. then I have to set it to 1280x1024 next time i login I have to do the same all over again...
2009-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	smr904		any ideas?
2009-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	are you familiar with xrandr?
2009-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	heard of it.. but people say do it on your own risk..
2009-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	what shall I do with it?
2009-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	you can change your resolution in it from the command line. Now, with that said, you can make a script that'll do that every bootup
2009-05-10T11:15:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	like... "xrandr --output VGA --mode 1280x1024"
2009-05-10T11:16:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	I see.. what about edditing manually the xorg.org once and for good?
2009-05-10T11:16:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	Also a good idea. You may need to create something called a "modeline"
2009-05-10T11:17:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	I think I added one, but it doesn't seem to help
2009-05-10T11:17:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	run "xrandr" with no arguments. 1280x1024 should show up... does it?
2009-05-10T11:17:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	in terminal, btw.
2009-05-10T11:20:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	did it - that's what it says:
2009-05-10T11:21:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	that's good... that means Ubuntu detects that resolution
2009-05-10T11:21:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	weird how it doesn't select it.
2009-05-10T11:22:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	In my experience, adding the modeline only gets Ubuntu to detect the mode
2009-05-10T11:23:00.000Z	Kareeser	smr904	so I doubt that would work, but hey, worth a shot, right? Always backup your xorg.conf!
2009-05-10T11:23:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	right. thanks a lot for the idea.. I'll give that a try
2009-05-10T11:29:00.000Z	smr904	Kareeser	hey, I think it worked - loged out and back in and it is the good resolution..
