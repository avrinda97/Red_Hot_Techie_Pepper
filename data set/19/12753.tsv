2005-07-24T10:01:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	Novell FS is called something else, i forgot what
2005-07-24T10:02:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	who is suing any open source company other than SCO?
2005-07-24T10:20:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	it is all over the place....but if SCO gets $3billion dollars from IBM....there will be lots of lawsuits flying in every direction
2005-07-24T10:20:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	SCO will not get anything
2005-07-24T10:20:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	they have no case at all
2005-07-24T10:20:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	it will likely get a summary judgement once the preliminaries are done at the end of the year
2005-07-24T10:21:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	well lots of legal issues are still unsettled...and patience is required to sort out the facts
2005-07-24T10:21:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	with no cases what is there to sort?
2005-07-24T10:21:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	who knows i am not a judge..there is some Judge Kimball or someone looking into everything
2005-07-24T10:24:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	do you think that if there was a case IBM wouldn't have already bought SCO since they are only worth $70M? :)
2005-07-24T10:32:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	how long have you used that nick btw? it sounds vaguely familiar
2005-07-24T10:35:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	still here?
2005-07-24T10:36:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	yes...but anyway there are still quite a few lawsuits going on....just recently some law suit was levied against someone who hacked someone else's game server
2005-07-24T10:38:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	bnetd?
2005-07-24T10:38:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	but anyway the stuff is not settled so it is best to err on the safe side.
2005-07-24T10:38:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	i think it was called Battlenet or something like that
2005-07-24T10:38:00.000Z	calc	bojangles	that case is even older than the SCO one
2005-07-24T10:44:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	well what about the lawsuit where some people were rerouting other people's websites to get all their traffic
2005-07-24T10:45:00.000Z	bojangles	calc	anyway there are quite a few
