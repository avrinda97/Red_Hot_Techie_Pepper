2012-09-27T00:41:00.000Z	Monotoko2		so no-one can help me disable DHCP when connection sharing?
2012-09-27T00:42:00.000Z	Dantevios	Monotoko2	you just want to turn off dhcp in ubuntu?
2012-09-27T00:42:00.000Z	Dantevios	Monotoko2	and assign yourself a static IP?
2012-09-27T00:42:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	My laptop is connected to the ethernet... I'd like to connect my iPhone to the wifi, which I can do but it uses DHCP
2012-09-27T00:43:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	stupid university internet... I need the iPhone to have an IP from the actual DHCP server rather than my laptop
2012-09-27T00:44:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	nah... the laptop is assigning the iPhone a 169 address... when I need it to get the 10. address from the ethernet
2012-09-27T00:45:00.000Z	Dantevios	Monotoko2	why don't you just set yourself an IP on the school network in the 10. range statically on your iphone and use the schools DNS?
2012-09-27T00:45:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	I have.... it doesn't work
2012-09-27T00:46:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	correct, when I connect it to the laptop it wants to serve it a 169 address, even if I override it statically
2012-09-27T00:47:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	network sharing... I'm connected to the ethernet, then I tried to connect the iPhone to the wifi... can I connect it to the 'net via USB?
2012-09-27T00:49:00.000Z	Dantevios	Monotoko2	I'm just not understanding your setup Monotoko2. The school has wifi, your laptop is connected to the school network via ethernet. How are you trying to add your IPhone to the network, and what does it have to do with ubuntu specifically? I'm just confused at what you're trying to do here.
2012-09-27T00:50:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	the school only has ethernet... I've turned my laptop into a wifi point (using an ad-hoc network: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing) and Ubuntu is assigning me a 169 address
2012-09-27T00:53:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	no... can you take me through it? I litterally just enabled network sharing the GUI way
2012-09-27T00:54:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	12.04
2012-09-27T00:56:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	I'm sure, it just won't connect to it (: it recieves a 169 IP address from the access point
2012-09-27T00:56:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	it appears as "KatieLaptop"
2012-09-27T01:18:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	after running ifconfig I see that the wifi seems to be on it's own network (10.42.0.1)
2012-09-27T01:24:00.000Z	Dantevios	Monotoko2	this may be something you need to discuss with the #networking channel as well
2012-09-27T01:25:00.000Z	Monotoko2	Dantevios	will try, thank you
