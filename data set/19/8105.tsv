2007-06-04T15:15:00.000Z	helloRobot		anyone here use gmail and thunderbird
2007-06-04T15:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	just ask your question please
2007-06-04T15:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	no
2007-06-04T15:16:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	how do you have gmail / thunderbird configured
2007-06-04T15:16:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	When I remove a message in thunderbird and empty trash, if i login to my gmail it still shows up on gmail server
2007-06-04T15:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	depends what setting you want to know about
2007-06-04T15:17:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	I want to be able to move messages to trash, empty trash, and have them removed from server.
2007-06-04T15:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	in your gmail settings choose where you want the mail to go. should also be in tbird settings
2007-06-04T15:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	you should beable to set it to send it to trash
2007-06-04T15:18:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	I only have 3 options in gmail. keep in inbox, archive, or delete
2007-06-04T15:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	and the issue is?
2007-06-04T15:19:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	i don't want it to delete all messages that are accessed via pop. i just want it to delete the one's i delete using thunderbird.
2007-06-04T15:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	cant have both. one or other
2007-06-04T15:19:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	doesn't that seem silly?
2007-06-04T15:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	it doesnt matter to me TBH
2007-06-04T15:20:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	I mean, wouldn't it make sense that I would like to use my choice mail application but i'f im forced to use gmail, i would have the same messages there?
2007-06-04T15:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	tell the gmail devels and file a bug against thunderbird
2007-06-04T15:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	helloRobot	its unlikely either way but i will see if i can set it up in tbird
2007-06-04T15:22:00.000Z	helloRobot	gnomefreak	thanks for trying to help
