2008-04-03T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LGKeiz	vnc over www is not advised. Its unencrypted unless its done through an ssh tunnel
2008-04-03T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LGKeiz	does play work? does amarok work?
2008-04-03T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LGKeiz	is the volume up on evceything
2008-04-03T16:58:00.000Z	LGKeiz	ActionParsnip	probably.

2008-04-03T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LGKeiz	Pretty easy fix. Hardy uses the pulseaudio sound system by default and VLC is trying to use ALSA as the vlc pulseaudio plugin isn't installed by default. Install the package "vlc-plugin-pulse" and VLC will play nice with everything else.
2008-04-03T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LGKeiz	should be ok. restart VLC. I just googled it :)
