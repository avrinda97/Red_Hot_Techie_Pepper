2012-02-11T23:48:00.000Z	urlin2u		are*
2012-02-11T23:49:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	there are ways to attack tor yes, but there are plenty of guides on the tor website which explain how you can remain anonymous if you really need to
2012-02-11T23:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	to some extent but your are subject to the routing which you cannot control completely, read closely.
2012-02-11T23:50:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	that makes no sense, also you can pick your route through the tor network if you want
2012-02-11T23:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	the entrance and exits to the network if done in the same country if not bounced out leave you exposed if I remember correctly.
2012-02-11T23:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	not together but consecutivlt the exits
2012-02-11T23:52:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	i dont see why that would be the case, the whole tor system is designed to prevent you from correlating an input and output of the system
2012-02-11T23:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	they say this themslves in the tor info I believe, your also subject to going through servers that could be not safe.
2012-02-11T23:53:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	you can try and link consequtive connections by using information from one connection to discover the other syes
2012-02-11T23:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	my point is like saying linux is not hackable or free of badware is not correct nor is tor a private entity at all times, do you get that. :)
2012-02-11T23:55:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	again its designed to deal with that, i wont argue it's foolproof, the tor's disclaimer already says that, but attacking it is not trivial
2012-02-11T23:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	hmm and my preamble of PERSONALLY was not good enough for you. :)
2012-02-11T23:59:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	i dont follow
2012-02-12T00:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	I said personally I would not rely on this privacy, not that it wasn't possible to jave it.
2012-02-12T00:04:00.000Z	acicula	urlin2u	eh this is a channel where people come for advice, if you have personal idea's about something that you dont want to discuss, dont post them
2012-02-12T00:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	lol that is all you have done without saying it is your opinion.
2012-02-12T00:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	no links for confirmation no empirical evidence.
2012-02-12T00:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	acicula	it is channel poicy to say when it is a personal opinion so that the user is not confusd with fud
