2007-07-18T14:12:00.000Z	Solidays		So I'm resorting to running a live CD for a week
2007-07-18T14:12:00.000Z	Solidays		Tell me, is there any easy way to save settings to a USB stick?
2007-07-18T14:13:00.000Z	vox754	Solidays	what exactly do you want. I think the Knoppix live CD would more useful for that.
2007-07-18T14:14:00.000Z	Solidays		I just want to carry on using Ubuntu while my laptop's having it's LCD hinges repaired
2007-07-18T14:14:00.000Z	Solidays		I wanted to boot directly off my laptop HDD but apparently that isn't possible with a clean install
2007-07-18T14:15:00.000Z	Solidays		I only have a 1GB USB stick so it's not really up for running Ubuntu off of it
2007-07-18T14:16:00.000Z	Solidays		Nope
2007-07-18T14:16:00.000Z	vox754	Solidays	I'm confused. Did you take out the laptop hard drive?
2007-07-18T14:16:00.000Z	Solidays		Yep
2007-07-18T14:16:00.000Z	Solidays		It came with a 40gig HDD which I replaced with a 100gig HDD
2007-07-18T14:16:00.000Z	Solidays		Ubuntu's on the 100gig one and now it's going in for repair I switched the 40gig one back in
2007-07-18T14:17:00.000Z	Solidays		I know I can run Ubuntu off of the live CD
2007-07-18T14:17:00.000Z	Solidays		The thing about that is I'm stuck with the programs that are installed on the live CD, right?
2007-07-18T14:18:00.000Z	Solidays	Solidays	is a take off of Holidays >_>
2007-07-18T14:19:00.000Z	Solidays		Sol is the nick I use on another server. So the nick isn't as weird as it looks
2007-07-18T14:19:00.000Z	Solidays		The thing about using the live CD is I won't have programs like VLC, WINE, etc.
2007-07-18T14:20:00.000Z	vox754	Solidays	Knoppix was specially designed as a Live CD so it has numerous applications installed. Maybe you could try it.     And that about your nickname is off topic.
2007-07-18T14:21:00.000Z	Solidays		Alright vox754. I'll take a look, thanks.
2007-07-18T14:22:00.000Z	vox754	Solidays	I think wine is included, VLC not sure. But Knoppix is also based on Debian, like Ubuntu. So I suspect you'll find it familiar. It includes Gnome, KDE, and other desktop managers.
