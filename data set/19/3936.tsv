2009-05-04T02:42:00.000Z	asclepius		hello
2009-05-04T02:43:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	what computer what monitor?
2009-05-04T02:44:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	driver problems. ati or nvidia video card?
2009-05-04T02:45:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	first go to system>Administration>hardware drivers
2009-05-04T02:49:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	don't really have any experience with your card. I'm google it
2009-05-04T02:52:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	how about the driver fron nvidia?
2009-05-04T02:52:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	did you try that?
2009-05-04T02:54:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	first download the driver from http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us
2009-05-04T02:55:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	even better go in Applications > Add/remove
2009-05-04T02:56:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	write nvidia in the search. there are a few packages. see if one is for your card
2009-05-04T02:57:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	than just click in the chech box near the package that supports your card
2009-05-04T02:58:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	:) common sense is almost better than google
2009-05-04T03:00:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	you need to restart
2009-05-04T03:00:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	and... good luck ;)
2009-05-04T03:13:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	I read before... I was lost in the first place about this so...
2009-05-04T03:15:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	risky. better search the forums might fint something in the end
2009-05-04T03:16:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	ATI has something like a control panel for vga. don't you see something similar for nvidia?
2009-05-04T03:17:00.000Z	e1luca	asclepius	maybe it's just a setting now
