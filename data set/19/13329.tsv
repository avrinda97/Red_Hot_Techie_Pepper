2005-04-17T06:28:00.000Z	whiskey_2		sure is nice to have some consistency between linux and win98
2005-04-17T06:28:00.000Z	whiskey_2		now with gimpshop and oo2 it is easy to port documents, images between them
2005-04-17T06:28:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	?
2005-04-17T06:29:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	well, i am just pleased to have consistency between the two computers
2005-04-17T06:29:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	cool
2005-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	its only illegal if you end up in jail for it.
2005-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	well..not really because everyone has a conscience
2005-04-17T06:39:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	although the fear of jail does influence some
2005-04-17T06:39:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	I have a conscience... I also like that conscience to not effect my in a negative way...
2005-04-17T06:40:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	I love music... and require pr0n... if I don't have the codecs... I'd go insane, and start raping females... I think my choice is relative good...
2005-04-17T06:40:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	well i let people make their own decisions...but i try to stay aware of the environment
2005-04-17T06:40:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	plus I need Java too... but other than that... everything here is free... oh and Flash... bah
2005-04-17T06:40:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	well there is gnuflash that worked on gentoo
2005-04-17T06:41:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	there is flashplugin-nonfree in multiverse  :/
2005-04-17T06:41:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	yes some things are restricted to only paying customers so you have to respect the producer's decision
2005-04-17T06:41:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	or you should
2005-04-17T06:42:00.000Z	lunitik	whiskey_2	I use Linux because I didn't want to steal software anymore... but some things I just refuse to go without...
2005-04-17T06:42:00.000Z	whiskey_2	lunitik	it is simply a fundamental disagreement between the consumer who wants to save money and the producer who wants to make money
