2006-03-27T17:07:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	Milk skin in theme manager?
2006-03-27T17:08:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	I think I had to google for it
2006-03-27T17:08:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	ok, thanks
2006-03-27T17:08:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	it's not transparent or anything though - maybe you want to look at adesklets or gdesklets?
2006-03-27T17:08:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	whats the difference? gDesklets looked horrible to me..
2006-03-27T17:09:00.000Z	nlogax		ok, adesklets are lighter weight than gdesklets (based on Python I think)
2006-03-27T17:11:00.000Z	mzinz		Whats the difference between aDesklets and gDesklets?
2006-03-27T17:13:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	adesklets are not based on GTK and use less memory (also there are fewer adesklets available)...  they look much like each other though
2006-03-27T17:13:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	so if im going for looks i probably want gDesklets
2006-03-27T17:13:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	so if you don't like gdesklets you won't like adesklets
2006-03-27T17:13:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	any clue how this guy got the apple-style bar? Hes in ubuntu: http://adesklets.sourceforge.net/images/contrib/louis_0.jpg
2006-03-27T17:14:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	google for some screenshots of g & a Desklets
2006-03-27T17:14:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	yes, that's a standard aDesklet I think
2006-03-27T17:14:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	ah.
2006-03-27T17:14:00.000Z	nlogax	mzinz	I even set that up myself...  you have to hack the config file to make it all work
2006-03-27T17:15:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	i see
2006-03-27T17:16:00.000Z	mzinz	nlogax	i can't find milk theme anywhere, it seems to be down on the one site i found
