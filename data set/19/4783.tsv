2009-08-27T01:50:00.000Z	bluebaron		I need to refetch apache.  I'm running apt-get install apache2 and it says it's successful but it's not copying any files at all.  Anyone know what's wrong?
2009-08-27T01:52:00.000Z	bluebaron		Anyone know why apt-get install apache isn't actually copying any new files?
2009-08-27T01:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bluebaron	is there any output to that command?
2009-08-27T01:53:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bluebaron	 then it seems that the deb package may already be on your system
