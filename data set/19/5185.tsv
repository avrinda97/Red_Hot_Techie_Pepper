2008-08-17T01:33:00.000Z	dorothy		Hi all I've an IBM ThinkPad x24 running Hardy Heron 8.04. Every time I go to battery, the screen brightness lowers, and I have to use the function key combination to raise  the brightness. Then, every few minutes the brightness just goes down again. Any help would be appreciated.
2008-08-17T01:34:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea	dorothy	check the power settings... you can get there by right-clicking on the power status icon in the system tray
2008-08-17T01:35:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	yeah, I went to system >preferences > power management but this did not help
2008-08-17T01:36:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	I even scoured the net to find a solution to no avail
2008-08-17T01:36:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea	dorothy	did you uncheck the "reduce backlight brightness" on the "On Battery tab"?
2008-08-17T01:36:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	yes
2008-08-17T01:36:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea	dorothy	OK, you should probably see if this is set in your BIOS
2008-08-17T01:37:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	been ther, done that
2008-08-17T01:37:00.000Z	dorothy		there*
2008-08-17T01:37:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea	dorothy	hmmm.... thinking
2008-08-17T01:38:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	I'm thinking it's might be a setting I can change in the gconf editor but I've no idea how to get to it
2008-08-17T01:39:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea	dorothy	press Alt-F2 to get the the "Run Application" popup and type "gconf-editor" in the window and click run
2008-08-17T01:43:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	okay went there, but when I went to apps > gnome-power-manager I changed the battery brightness from 70 to 100 but when I took my charger out (just now) my screen brightness still dimmed :-(
2008-08-17T01:47:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea		doroth: hmmm... sounds like you are doing all the right things... this could be a compatibility issue with acpi (power managment service) and your particular laptop.  acpi support has come a long way in Ubuntu but it's still not perfect
2008-08-17T01:48:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	is there a way to remove all acpi support and let the bios run it?
2008-08-17T01:51:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea		you can turn off acpi and apmd support by going to System->Services and find them in the list and un-check them there.  The next time you bootup they will not run.  If you want to turn them off without rebooting you can (after you uncheck them in the services list) run the following from the command line: "/etc/init.d/acpi-support stop"  and then "/etc/init.d/acpid stop"
2008-08-17T01:54:00.000Z	dorothy	WhatsHisName_Sea	coola bulla I'm going down for reboot. thanks for your help
2008-08-17T01:54:00.000Z	dorothy		exit
2008-08-17T01:54:00.000Z	WhatsHisName_Sea	dorothy	You're welcome! ;)
