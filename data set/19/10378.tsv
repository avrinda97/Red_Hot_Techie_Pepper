2006-08-10T14:17:00.000Z	sith_man		anyone know what would cause my keyboard to repeatedly type a letter att the login screen? its irritating because i cant login to ubuntu..:(
2006-08-10T14:18:00.000Z	sith_man		idk, i type a key once and it lags up and shows thousands of the same letters
2006-08-10T14:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	are you on that keyboard now.. it may just have a stuck key..?
2006-08-10T14:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	it isnt anything funky like usb keyboard or ?
2006-08-10T14:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	sorry for the silly question
2006-08-10T14:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	Can you think of anything youwere doing or upgraded that might have caused it
2006-08-10T14:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	so you manually stopped the updates or the repos went down or it crashed.?

2006-08-10T14:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	there may have been sommthing in that list of 40 files you deselected...
2006-08-10T14:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	maybe someone can take you to a term and do a manual apt-get update
2006-08-10T14:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	that is about all I can think of..
2006-08-10T14:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	maybe someone can take you to a term and do a manual apt-get update
2006-08-10T14:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	start up to a terminal prompt as in recovery mode...
2006-08-10T14:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	redo the update (in full)
2006-08-10T14:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	You may get to the terminal and find that even that is hosed up with multiple keystrokes
2006-08-10T14:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sith_man	reinstall would seem the only option at that point
