2008-09-03T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	have you done sudo modprobe ndiswraper
2008-09-03T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	it loads the ndiswrapper kernel module
2008-09-03T13:16:00.000Z	nate_	ActionParsnip	what does it do?
2008-09-03T13:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	you can configure your wireless till you die but if you dont load it then it wont do anything
2008-09-03T13:17:00.000Z	nate_	ActionParsnip	modules not found
2008-09-03T13:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	then its not set up right
2008-09-03T13:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	no
2008-09-03T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	ok, have you added the ndiswrapper to the modules file so it gets autoloaded
2008-09-03T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	id rerad the walkthrough ubottu gave you, you seem to have missed a lot out
2012-06-14T08:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	that's offtopic here
2012-06-14T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	that's offtopic here, this is support only
2012-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	that's what the repos are for, they are all binaries..
2012-06-15T08:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	sudo apt-get install -d alsa-base alsa-utils
2012-06-15T08:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Driver_Compilation   all the tar's are source though
2012-06-15T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	apt-get install -d   will download the debs for you and put them in /var/cache/apt/archives
2012-06-15T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	you'd run the apt-get command in Ubuntu, then transfer the files...
2012-06-15T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nate_	doesn't centos have sound or something?
