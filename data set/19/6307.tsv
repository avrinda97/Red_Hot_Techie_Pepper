2009-01-03T04:07:00.000Z	groundup		When I go to watch a Flash video on Facebook, it says I need to upgrade Flash. When I download the deb, it tells me I already have a newer version installed. When I check my FF plugins, it tells me I am running v9. How do I get FF and Flash to jive?
2009-01-03T04:07:00.000Z	graingert	groundup	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-01-03T04:08:00.000Z	graingert	groundup	also it seems you have installed your flash from adobe.com and not a repository
2009-01-03T04:08:00.000Z	graingert	groundup	see if you can uninstall it
2009-01-03T04:08:00.000Z	groundup	graingert	I believe I installed it from a repo but I tried upgrading from the site
