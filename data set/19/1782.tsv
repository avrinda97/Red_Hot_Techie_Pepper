2011-02-10T11:20:00.000Z	Bsims		heh rigved nothing to be done but wait for the kernel devs to come up with a fix
2011-02-10T11:20:00.000Z	Bsims		minor but annoying
2011-02-10T11:20:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	well i guess ya...
2011-02-10T11:13:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	heh I may go back to Debian, every upgrade I have more features to hunt down and disable <g>
2011-02-10T11:13:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	you can try out the minimal install of ubuntu. then install what you need on top of that
2011-02-10T11:14:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	heh I know but I have been bitten by a niggling bug that is uber annoying but it exists on debian too
2011-02-10T11:15:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	can you tell us more about this bug?
2011-02-10T11:16:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	how exactly do you fix it?
2011-02-10T11:16:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	you can't fix it
2011-02-10T11:17:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	you just now said that you when you fix it, then you are unable to cap unicode characters
2011-02-10T11:18:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	no that is why its not fixed
2011-02-10T11:18:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	its a kernel bug
2011-02-10T11:19:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	hmmm. sorry i can't help you more, unless you can tell me what you would actually do to fix it
2011-02-10T11:22:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	have you tried to inform the kernel devs about this problem?
2011-02-10T11:22:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	its been there from 2009
2011-02-10T11:22:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	seems to be fixed in debian
2011-02-10T11:24:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	but if it's a fix that is to be implememnted in the kernel, then it should be there in ubuntu as well
2011-02-10T11:24:00.000Z	rigved	Bsims	as ubuntu uses a newer kernel than debian
2011-02-10T11:25:00.000Z	Bsims	rigved	dunno unless its a leftover old config
