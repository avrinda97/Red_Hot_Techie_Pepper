2006-11-30T06:29:00.000Z	cdcarter		hi, i just installed the postfix package, and i cannot access the smtp service from non localhost, on the server i can telnet to port 25, but not at my local machine
2006-11-30T06:30:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	the postfix package is configured that way on install to prevent open relays
2006-11-30T06:30:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	so how can i make my smtp server?
2006-11-30T06:31:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/email-services.html should help with initial config
2006-11-30T06:33:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	thanks
2006-11-30T06:33:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	np
2006-11-30T06:40:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	i ran that, and its still not available
2006-11-30T06:43:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	what's your goal with postfix? local delivery only, or your own general email server?
2006-11-30T06:44:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	being able to recieve email, and check it on the local machine
2006-11-30T06:45:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	is this going to be mail server for a domain? or are you just trying to receive email from another smtp server?
2006-11-30T06:45:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	for the domain
2006-11-30T06:46:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	are you getting any errors?
2006-11-30T06:47:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	tryign to telnet to port 25 from my home machine doesnt connect
2006-11-30T06:47:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	is postfix running?
2006-11-30T06:47:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	yea, i can telnet into it from localhost
2006-11-30T06:47:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	ah. ok. did you set up TLS?
2006-11-30T06:47:00.000Z	cdcarter		yea
2006-11-30T06:49:00.000Z	malakhi	cdcarter	when you telnet in from the localhost, do you see the STARTTLS string?
2006-11-30T06:49:00.000Z	cdcarter	malakhi	i got it now, it was a problem with the exim process floating around
