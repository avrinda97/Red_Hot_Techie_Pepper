2011-11-09T06:00:00.000Z	noomy_		you'd probably need a script that runs on keybind, to open t-bird
2011-11-09T06:00:00.000Z	noomy_		'cus you i doubt you can pump in a "new message" command to linux and have it just figure it out
2011-11-09T06:00:00.000Z	noomy_		although....i have a keyboard button that opens the mail client, maybe you can just have a cmd that opens it and makes a new msg?
2011-11-09T06:01:00.000Z	noomy_		i'm no coder, but couldnt you say "run tbid -> wait5 -> new msg"
2011-11-09T06:01:00.000Z	noomy_		and for more stability, have it check if tbird is open first
2011-11-09T06:01:00.000Z	noomy_		i'm guessing you can just make a sh script or something
2011-11-09T06:02:00.000Z	noomy_		thats beyond me
2011-11-09T06:02:00.000Z	noomy_		i could do it in java :p
2011-11-09T06:03:00.000Z	noomy_		i have a really simple straightforward question - whats the syntax to run a file (i'm trying to create my own launcher)
2011-11-09T06:03:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	there is no syntax, just the full path to the file, or the relative path to the file
2011-11-09T06:04:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	you have to chmod +x filename to make sure it is executable
2011-11-09T06:06:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	so if you download a file from the internet it is not assumed to be a runnable program (not like windows where anything ending in .exe gets run by double clicking). you have to use chmod to indicate it is a program
2011-11-09T06:07:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	well figure out how to do that. copy it into a file. make the first line #!/bin/bash and mark the file executable. thats a script
2011-11-09T06:08:00.000Z	noomy_	escott	appreciate the help, but i'm so lost right now lol, why cant i just do terminal "/etc/etc/etc/filename.jnlp"
2011-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	do ls -l /etc/etc/etc/filename.jnlp if you dont see rwx then its not marked as a program and you need to chmod +x it to turn it from rw- to rwx
2011-11-09T06:11:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	its also possible that java doesnt register how to execute java programs in which case you need to say java /etc/etc/etc/filename.jnlp
2011-11-09T06:13:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	there is a command line tool mimeopen which you can think of as double-click for the command line. its a bit of a crutch to use though
2011-11-09T06:32:00.000Z	escott	noomy_	it does nothing
