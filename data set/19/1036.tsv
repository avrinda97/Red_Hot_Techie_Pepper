2012-03-17T04:28:00.000Z	Edisto		I am trying to uninstall and reinstall a program. if its hanging on installation does that mean the file is corrupted?
2012-03-17T04:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	How did you install? From repository?
2012-03-17T04:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	Please be more precise about how you installed what folder you deleted .....
2012-03-17T04:32:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	Any reason for using xamp? I suggest that you just install apache2,mysql-server,php,phpmyadmin
2012-03-17T04:33:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	 paste a ls -l /opt
2012-03-17T04:37:00.000Z	Edisto	schnuffle	i was using everything because i for some reason when I install php... I still can't open local php files it just tries to save them or open with gedit
2012-03-17T04:38:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	you need to install the apche php module and activate it
2012-03-17T04:40:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	Yes and the module is libapache2-mod-php5
2012-03-17T04:41:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	When you install it it should be activated by default
2012-03-17T04:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	Just for you to know lampp may be nice for dev jobs but never use it on production server
2012-03-17T04:48:00.000Z	Edisto	schnuffle	still getting the same thing after I installed apache2,mysql-server,php,phpmyadmin
2012-03-17T04:49:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	You mean you call a php file and it gets downloaded?
2012-03-17T04:49:00.000Z	Edisto	schnuffle	i open it with firefox and it says open with gedit or save it won't view
2012-03-17T04:50:00.000Z	Edisto	schnuffle	did a2enmod php5 and says already enabled
2012-03-17T04:50:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	so you do a http://localhost/inho.php and it want to open it in Some editor?
2012-03-17T04:50:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	Did you restart your apaches server?
2012-03-17T04:51:00.000Z	Edisto	schnuffle	the localhost works its just opening php file
2012-03-17T04:51:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	No you need to enter the correct URL into the browser. Wordpress should be in /var/www
2012-03-17T04:52:00.000Z	schnuffle	Edisto	so if wordpress was extracted to /var/www/wp you need to type http://localhost/wp/install.php
