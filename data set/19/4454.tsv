2009-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	Umeaboy		And YES, I'm Swedish.
2009-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	Umeaboy		What do I set it to?
2009-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	Umeaboy		But this will affect Ubuntu to.
2009-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	Umeaboy		Since That's what I've got installed on sda5.
2009-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	Umeaboy		Nobody's awake to answer me on that channel.
2009-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	Umeaboy		I've tried.
2009-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	Umeaboy		So this is the last option.
2009-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	Umeaboy		Yes, but you see what's on the pic.
2009-09-27T07:29:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	ext3 is fine. what's the rest of the question?
2009-09-27T07:30:00.000Z	Umeaboy	scunizi	The question is.............what size do I choose if I want Ubuntu and Mandriva to have equal space to use?
2009-09-27T07:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	first you can share the swap partition.. no need to create two
2009-09-27T07:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	as for the rest of it.. do you have ubuntu already installed and are now installilng mandriva or the opposit?
2009-09-27T07:31:00.000Z	Umeaboy	scunizi	Yes to the first question.
2009-09-27T07:32:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	and when you installed did you only create 1 swap and 1 other partition to hold the OS?
2009-09-27T07:33:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	did you see my last question?
2009-09-27T07:34:00.000Z	Umeaboy	scunizi	I used the Ubuntu Live-CD so I had no options to choose.
2009-09-27T07:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	ah ok.. you let the partitioner do it's job by itself.. so if you do the same w/ Mandriva you might need to do manual partitioning.. name the existing swap partition to be used by mandriva and the remaining empty space for the os
2009-09-27T07:36:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	however I think Ubuntu probably took the entire drive so if you have to shrink it give Mandriva something like 100gigs.. that should be enough
2009-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	scunizi	Umeaboy	I'm here.. just got back in
