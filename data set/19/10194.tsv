2007-01-02T12:59:00.000Z	computer13137		Can someone tell me how to upgrade Ubuntu Breezy to Edgy using the install CD?  I read a few things on google that didn't work.
2007-01-02T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	you'll need to go breezy > dapper > edgy
2007-01-02T12:59:00.000Z	computer13137	Flannel	well how do I upgrade to Dapper using wget?
2007-01-02T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	but, with the Alternate CD, you can use apt-cdrom to add the CD, then upgrade from that
2007-01-02T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	wget? that's.... ugly.  apt-get you mean?
2007-01-02T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	there'll be instructions there, you'll want the "command line" instructions, obviously.
2007-01-02T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	read that link, the one ubotu gave you
2007-01-27T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	linux-generic
2007-01-27T12:48:00.000Z	computer13137	Flannel	And that will magically install i686?  OK, I'll take your word for it.
2007-01-27T12:49:00.000Z	computer13137	Flannel	Do I have to change anything in sources.list first?
2007-01-27T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	It won't install 686, as that doesn't exist anymore in edgy.  Edgy uses a -generic kernel, for all of them.  It also has a -386 specific kernel as well.
2007-01-27T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	nope
2007-01-27T12:49:00.000Z	computer13137	Flannel	OK thanks.  :)
2007-01-27T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	then you already have it.
2007-01-27T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	no worries.  You've already got the kernel you want
2007-03-07T08:02:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	ndiswrapper is in the repositories
2007-03-07T08:02:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	use apt-cdrom to add the repository on the CD, then install ndiswrapper from that
2007-03-07T08:03:00.000Z	Flannel	computer13137	There is a repository (with ndiswrapper) on the CD though, no need to sneakernet
