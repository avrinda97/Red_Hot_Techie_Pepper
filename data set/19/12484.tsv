2005-08-29T08:23:00.000Z	neo78		is Totem mediaplayer any good? if no, what should i get, if yes, how do i get codecs to play my movies (mostly avis)
2005-08-29T08:23:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	totem is ok, some people prefer totem-xine. generally you want everything listed on the RestrictedFormats wiki page :)
2005-08-29T08:28:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	install the things listed on the RestrictedFormats wiki page
2005-08-29T08:28:00.000Z	neo78	Ng	do you have a URL ?
2005-08-29T08:29:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	which is the same thing
2005-08-29T08:29:00.000Z	neo78	Ng	syntactically, they're definitely not... semantically, they mean two different things to me, but the same thing to you...
2005-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	less backchat, more installing :)
2005-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	neo78	Ng	 ditto!
2005-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	my system already plays everything :o
2005-08-29T08:33:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	please direct your anger to the DVD-CCA @
2005-08-29T08:33:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	they won't give out free licenses :(
2005-08-29T08:34:00.000Z	neo78	Ng	sheesh, that page is complicated
2005-08-29T08:34:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	yeah, it covers quite a range of stuff, but it's worth ploughing through :)
2005-08-29T08:36:00.000Z	neo78	Ng	cool. How do i install the stuff though? looks like i'm gonna want gstreamer0.8-mad, gstreamer0.8--ffmpeg, possibly gstreamer0.8-plugins, w32codecs etc (though i'm still confused about the totem-xine vs. totem-gstreamer thing)
2005-08-29T08:37:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	you need to add universe and multiverse repositories and use apt-get or synaptic to install those packages. the page should say. w32codecs I prefer to grab by hand from the marillat repository and personally I prefer totem-gstreamer, but if that gives you problems feel free to switch to totem-xine
2005-08-29T08:38:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	totem-gstreamer
2005-08-29T08:43:00.000Z	neo78	Ng	what's the deal with Ogg Vorbis ?
2005-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	it should work out of the box
2005-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	Ng	neo78	oh, ogg vorbis is just another encoding format, like mp3
