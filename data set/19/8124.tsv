2007-05-01T13:58:00.000Z	|ericsson|		Could anyone say how well one could trust chkrootkit for a medium-sized university server?
2007-05-01T13:58:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	you should run it off of a live cd or along with rootkit hunter
2007-05-01T13:59:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	rootkit hunter, is that an offical package to use?
2007-05-01T13:59:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	if you run it off of a live cd then it won't be corrupted by any malicious programs that target it
2007-05-01T13:59:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	good tips, gracefully noted
2007-05-01T14:00:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	get rootkit hunter from http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html
2007-05-01T14:00:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	make sure you run the updates before scanning
2007-05-01T14:02:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	Are there any other vital security checks for establishing if there has been intrusion/infection?
2007-05-01T14:03:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	Running bastille, wireshark and nessus at the moment
2007-05-01T14:04:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	wow...that's much better than me.  i wish my boss let me make the server more secure. you can start by checking your logs.
2007-05-01T14:05:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	You know of any good things as pre-cautions? Heard about AIDE or something like that..
2007-05-01T14:05:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	You slap your boss with a large trout and he'll come around..
2007-05-01T14:06:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	change ssh port or enable something like fail2ban for ssh brute force attempts. look into monit and munin.  good descriptions on howtoforge.com.  we have many trout in alaska.
2007-05-01T14:07:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	disable FTP and enforce SFTP. use SSH keys instead of passwords, and you can chroot non-vital ssh users
2007-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	Would it be advisable to encourage the use of SSH key's rather to ~70 SSH users?
2007-05-01T14:09:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	most importantly, keep a list of installed apps and update them regularly.  using keys for 70+ users won't be easy.  just make sure their passwords are good.
2007-05-01T14:15:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	iptables is another useful tool. again, howtoforge.com has many good security tutorials and an excellent message board for questions.
2007-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	|ericsson|	FakeOutdoorsman	brilliant info, thank's a million mate ;)
2007-05-01T14:17:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	|ericsson|	no problem.  good luck against the constant barrage of intrusion attempts.
