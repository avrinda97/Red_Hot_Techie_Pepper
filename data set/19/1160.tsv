2011-07-01T01:54:00.000Z	Danny__		Hello, I was here earlier and I was told to forward my ports on my router but now I am unable to connect to the internet
2011-07-01T01:55:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	what ports did you forward
2011-07-01T01:56:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	you were told to forward ports, but which ones there are 2^16 of them
2011-07-01T01:58:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	port 5009 is a high port >1024 and is unrelated to your trouble connecting to the internet
2011-07-01T02:00:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	its possible you did something wrong in your router while forwarding the port, but that port itself is not the cause. a few things to check. run "cat /etc/resolv.conf" and then there will be a number following nameserver. can you (a) ping that number "ping 123.123.123.123" (b) let us know what it is
2011-07-01T02:02:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	if you could also run "ping 8.8.8.8"
2011-07-01T02:02:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	hit "Ctrl-C" to stop the pings
2011-07-01T02:03:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	sure
2011-07-01T02:05:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	what ip address was that ping to (and thats a successful ping btw)
2011-07-01T02:07:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	what was the number
2011-07-01T02:10:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	ok you are connected to the internet. its possible that your dns is down. without a dns your computer cannot convert www.google.com into a number like 74.125.93.105 (its like looking up a phone number in the phone book). you could try switching dns to google dns 8.8.8.8, but its a little strange we can ping the 209 address because that is your road-runner provided dns, usually when dns is down its non-responsive to pings
2011-07-01T02:15:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	if you want to try a different dns you could go to the network manager config and change it from dhcp to dhcp addressess only, and in the nameserver line put in 8.8.8.8 and see if things start working
2011-07-01T02:18:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	we could try a quick telnet. telnet www.google.com 80 and then type very quickly "GET INDEX.HTML" and hit enter three times
2011-07-01T02:20:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	so your dns is not working
2011-07-01T02:23:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	like i said switch to 8.8.8.8 as your dns provider
2011-07-01T02:24:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	network icon in the top panel -> edit your connection -> ipv4 settings -> select dhcp addresses only -> put 8.8.8.8 in the dns servers section
2011-07-01T02:35:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	earlier you were able to ping the 209 address right
2011-07-01T02:38:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	if you have some kind of marginal connection (like your cable modem is going out every few minutes) that might be your problem
2011-07-01T02:38:00.000Z	escott	Danny__	but if ping 8.8.8.8 works (ie packets are not being lost) you are by definition online.
