2006-10-31T17:24:00.000Z	sentinel		hmm
2006-10-31T17:24:00.000Z	sentinel		is there some sort of problem with using the latest nvidia drivers on ubuntu 6.10? the "how to" doesn't appear to work for me
2006-10-31T17:26:00.000Z	sentinel		well, I noticed that nvidia-config enable didn't change the driver
2006-10-31T17:26:00.000Z	sentinel		hmm
2006-10-31T17:27:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	compare the backup xorg.conf with the one added by the nvidia driver installation.
2006-10-31T17:25:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	You have to edit the xorg.conf manually.
2006-10-31T17:25:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	it is totally screwed after installation and does not work any more.
2006-10-31T17:26:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	At least I had to manually change the PCI bus settings back to 1:0:0 and add the right resolution to the screen sections.
2006-10-31T17:26:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	It also changed my keyboard mapping. So pay attention to that, if you experience funny things when typing after enabling the nvidia driver.
2006-10-31T17:28:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	simply copy the backup back into place and just change the driver from "nv" to "nvidia". At least that did it for me :)
2006-10-31T17:28:00.000Z	sentinel	Kannix	I tried doing that but it still doesn't appear to work
2006-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	can you post your xorg.conf to some pastebin?
2006-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	oops.
2006-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	that is not good of course.
2006-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	What hardware are you running? GPU?
2006-10-31T17:30:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	did you download the nvidia-glx package?
2006-10-31T17:32:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	could well be, if there is some problem with the framebuffer device.
2006-10-31T17:32:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	However, starting the proper nvidia drivers under X should work.
2006-10-31T17:35:00.000Z	Kannix	sentinel	cu
