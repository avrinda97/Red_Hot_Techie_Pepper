2008-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	xomp		looks like I'm dropping my connection here everytime I disconnect / connect to/from VPN..
2008-01-27T06:34:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	some local resolution service thing that needs rectifying I guess?
2008-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	ping doesn't use a "port", it just sends an ICMP ping
2008-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	that's what I was thinking also, but I can ping my workstation by name & ip address in windows. Only in ubuntu do I see this problem.
2008-01-27T06:36:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	probably local resolution service on Ubuntu needs tweaking sec
2008-01-27T06:37:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	I noticed this issue when trying to RDP into my workstation in ubuntu. I tried by name like I usually do in windows only to get errors that it couldn't find the host heh.
2008-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	try editing /etc/nsswitch.conf and sticking I think wins to the end of the hosts line?
2008-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	but if you specify by IP address no problem?
2008-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	yeah, connecting to the ip works a treat
2008-01-27T06:38:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	so it's a resolution issue
2008-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	appears so :)
2008-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	googling gave me http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=88206

2008-01-27T06:39:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	the funny thing is, I can ping our exchange server by name and ip and get good responses.
2008-01-27T06:40:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	it appears to only be affecting my workstation. I can ping by name to any other server I admin over on our domain lol
2008-01-27T06:40:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	interesting
2008-01-27T06:40:00.000Z	scguy318	xomp	I probably can't answer your question to your satisfaction, but googling gave me that
2008-01-27T06:40:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	thanks, I'm reading over it now :)
2008-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	xomp	scguy318	that looks pretty straight forward. I'll give it a try and report back :) Thanks again!
