2009-07-12T11:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	if you're trying to map a keyboard there are other tools..
2009-07-12T11:19:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	please continue...what tools are you reffering to ?
2009-07-12T11:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	hang on and I'll look.. they are pretty typical when trying to map a keyboard espicially one with multimedia keys etc..
2009-07-12T11:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	keymapper is one (repo), keytouch, .. what kind of keyboard are you trying to use.. language difference? or what
2009-07-12T11:25:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	i have one which's in a different language yes
2009-07-12T11:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	which one..
2009-07-12T11:26:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	 but i have an english one too which i think i'll use most...but with excessive multimedia keys
2009-07-12T11:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	synaptic shows a special appelate to switch keyboard layouts on the fly.. if both keyboards work plugged in together and you only need to switch between the layouts that might be the answer.
2009-07-12T11:27:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	ah didn't know that..i'll check it out
2009-07-12T11:28:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	btw i am trying to compile thc-vlogger form source and i get the error of not having [/lib/modules/2.6.27-14-generic/build   which happens to be the linux source build directory
2009-07-12T11:28:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	how to rectify this ?
2009-07-12T11:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	sudo apt-get install build-essential might take care of it.
2009-07-12T11:29:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	already to its newest version
2009-07-12T11:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	sorry .. I'm stuck
2009-07-12T11:30:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	thanks for helping with the keymapping though
2009-07-12T11:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	pronoy	np.. I tried to map a logitec once and ran into a couple of tools to do it.. it's been over a year though. good luck
2009-07-12T11:31:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	thanks
2009-11-09T22:54:00.000Z	pronoy	Scunizi	ya
