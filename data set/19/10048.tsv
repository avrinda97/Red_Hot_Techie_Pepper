2006-10-23T07:07:00.000Z	dcordes	snikker	maybe i can help. what's your problem?
2006-10-23T07:09:00.000Z	dcordes	snikker	remove all existing vmware networks and recompile vmware-server
2006-10-23T07:10:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	now i've removed the vmware server, but i can use internet only with the firewall disabled...
2006-10-23T07:11:00.000Z	dcordes	snikker	did this also remove the vmware networks?
2006-10-23T07:12:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	if i've removed the vmware i shouldn't have any vmware network, right?
2006-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	if not, how can i remove them?
2006-10-23T07:14:00.000Z	dcordes	snikker	dunno. ifconfig and see if there are any
2006-10-23T07:15:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	with ifconfig i can see only my real network
2006-10-23T07:16:00.000Z	dcordes	snikker	then you see if it worked
2006-10-23T07:17:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	ok, itry to reinstall firestarter...
2006-10-23T07:19:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	then i'll let you to know if work or not... to later...
2006-10-23T07:21:00.000Z	snikker	dcordes	it work, thanks for support.
2006-10-23T07:22:00.000Z	dcordes	snikker	nice. i hope it will continue working after you reinstall the vmware
