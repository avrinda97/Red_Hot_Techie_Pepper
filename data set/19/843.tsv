2011-08-12T04:45:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	just / then
2011-08-12T04:46:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	 find / -iname 'resume.doc' -mtime -60  2> /dev/null
2011-08-12T04:49:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	 are you sure the name and the modified day? ~ extend the day to within 90 days may be .
2011-08-12T04:51:00.000Z	induz	wildbat_semi_afk	yes the name and modified dates are right
2011-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	find / -iname '*.doc' -mtime -90  2> /dev/null                     this will give you all the doc edited within 3 moths. if you can't find it ~ you must have somthing wrong, like you didn't mount the drive ~ it is in USB in your pocket etc.
2011-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	induz	wildbat_semi_afk	it gives me a list on command line but i dont know wht to do with that
2011-08-12T05:01:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	like i said the list is the file named *.doc which edited within past 3 months ~ .... the resume should be in the list
2011-08-12T05:02:00.000Z	induz	wildbat_semi_afk	I see a list of files after inserting the command but how can i locate the file
2011-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	induz	wildbat_semi_afk	YOUR COMMAND IS RIGHT BUT I LACK THE KNOWLEDGE OF INTERPRETING THE COMMAND LINE TO LOCATE THE FILE
2011-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	induz	wildbat_semi_afk	sorry for caps
2011-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	lol~ that's all we can help ~ as per your discription ~ the find didn't hit ~ . open the document editor and hope that it is in the recently opened list :>
2011-08-12T05:09:00.000Z	wildbat_semi_afk	induz	are you sure it is not in external drive etc? have you email it ,if so check your SENT box? unless you wanna let ppl ssh in you PC and help the search  (risking stealing your info , install virus maybe ;p j/k ) , that all i can help.
