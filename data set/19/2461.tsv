2010-03-29T05:48:00.000Z	magicianlord		i found that xfce isnt really all that much faster
2010-03-29T05:48:00.000Z	magicianlord		it seems like it would be, but its neglible
2010-03-29T05:50:00.000Z	magicianlord		hww: in startup apps, disable bluetooth, check for new drivers, print queue applet, update notifier, use folders update, and visual assistance (in karmic)

2010-03-29T05:53:00.000Z	Flannel	magicianlord	You mean Xubuntu? (pronounced 'zoobuntu' I suppose)
2010-03-29T05:54:00.000Z	magicianlord	Flannel	oh ok. didnt know it was pronounced like that
2010-07-25T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	magicianlord	du (Disk Used)
2010-07-25T08:55:00.000Z	magicianlord	Flannel	thanks
2010-07-25T08:56:00.000Z	magicianlord	Flannel	is that in megabytes?
2010-07-25T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	magicianlord	KB
2010-07-25T08:58:00.000Z	Flannel	magicianlord	And, possibly base 10 instead of base 2 (du -h will make it human readable, --si will force it to 1000 instead of 1024 for human readable)
2010-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	magicianlord	Flannel	thanks. the h parameter formats it by megabyte
2010-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	Flannel	magicianlord	It'll format it in whatever prefix is most sane
