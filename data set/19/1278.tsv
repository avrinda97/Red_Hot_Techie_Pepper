2011-03-14T04:21:00.000Z	kioku		hey ubuntu's, i need help installing distribution version 10.04 onto a Toshiba Sattelite and i am having a realy hard time.
2011-03-14T04:22:00.000Z	kioku		it currently runs windows xp, and i have tried 3 times to install it through the cd
2011-03-14T04:22:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	I have one of those, what's the issue?
2011-03-14T04:25:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	That's the options screen. It should automagically try to boot from that, but if it isn't that suggests there's some underlying issues.
2011-03-14T04:28:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	It's the value given to the CD image which proves it's correctly downloaded.
2011-03-14T04:36:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	That is actually what I asked. Hm.
2011-03-14T04:38:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	I am really not sure what to tell you.
2011-03-14T04:51:00.000Z	kioku	Rummage	i have some more information for my situation
2011-03-14T04:51:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	Shoot

2011-03-14T04:54:00.000Z	kioku	Rummage	on the permission denied window, it asked me to look at that file.
2011-03-14T04:56:00.000Z	kioku	Rummage	are you looking at it?
2011-03-14T04:56:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	Yeah. Do you have any idea where the important lines are?
2011-03-14T04:56:00.000Z	kioku	Rummage	not to this, not really.
2011-03-14T04:59:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	I'm reduced to google-is-my-friend territory.
2011-03-14T05:00:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	This looks VERY relevant to you: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1134058.html
2011-03-14T05:04:00.000Z	kioku	Rummage	so it looks like WUBI isn't good for this computer?
2011-03-14T05:07:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	I would think not, but it seems you can't boot from the CD directly, which eliminates the other option.
2011-03-14T05:18:00.000Z	Rummage	kioku	Sorry, things went to hell for a minute. You need anything?
