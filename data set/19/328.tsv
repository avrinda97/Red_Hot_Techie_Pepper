2012-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	Hickeroar		Hey all. I have a 640GB drive running windows 7. I'd like to dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu. If I resize my windows (C) partition, and run the liveCD and install 12.04, will the installer detect window 7 and set me up a bootloader so I can choose OSs?
2012-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	Hickeroar		or do I need to do that manually?
2012-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	it will but u have to do it manually
2012-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	just choose custom when you do partitioning on ubuntu
2012-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	then set it up
2012-05-03T07:17:00.000Z	vexaxv		can someone help me figure out why the drivers cause such a fps drop from windows to ubuntu?
2012-05-03T07:17:00.000Z	Hickeroar	vexaxv	So it is relatively straight forward as far as the bootloader goes?
2012-05-03T07:17:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	it used to give u an option to install the bootloader or not but i havent seen it latley just make sure you click anything u see advanced settings and try to find it
2012-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	vexaxv		does anyone know whats up with my fps issue?!
2012-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	Hickeroar	vexaxv	Thank you. I've done the whole thing manually a long time ago, but it's been several years, haha. I appreciate the help
2012-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	Hickeroar		vexaxv++
2012-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	Hickeroar	vexaxv	haha apparently they dont support ++ here
2012-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	np  lol
2012-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	:P
2012-05-03T07:19:00.000Z	vexaxv	Hickeroar	but yeah it is pretty straight forward its just like installing windows when you do the partitioning so..like i said keep an eye out for the grub bootloader option its a bitch to remove it atleast it was for me
2012-05-03T07:19:00.000Z	vexaxv		okay come on, you guys blind? anyone in here play games???
2012-05-03T07:20:00.000Z	Hickeroar	vexaxv	roger that. I'll keep my eyes peeled
