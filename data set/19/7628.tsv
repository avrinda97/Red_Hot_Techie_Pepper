2008-01-28T23:22:00.000Z	stealthy		Could someone please help me set up compiz-fusion? I've followed the AIGLX walkthrough because I have an Intel GMA950 adapter, and am using the intel i810 driver in xorg.
2008-01-28T23:22:00.000Z	stealthy		I have no direct acceleration, and running compiz --replace gives this error set: http://www.pastebin.ca/876227
2008-01-28T23:22:00.000Z	stealthy		I would appreciate any help with this issue.
2008-01-28T23:23:00.000Z	stealthy		Does anyone have any idea what my problem is?
2008-01-28T23:25:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	Checking for nVidia: not present. that's your problem. do you have hardware accelerated 3d card?
2008-01-28T23:26:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	gma950
2008-01-28T23:26:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	so yes.
2008-01-28T23:26:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	one sec, gonna look up that card...
2008-01-28T23:26:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	It's intel GMA950, aka i945g integrated
2008-01-28T23:26:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	I don't believe xubuntu came with the module for it, but I'm not sure how to check.
2008-01-28T23:27:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	compiz on xfce?
2008-01-28T23:27:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	yes
2008-01-28T23:27:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	as far as I know, you can not run compiz on xfce
2008-01-28T23:27:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	but I am sure someone will correct me momentarly if I am wrong
2008-01-28T23:27:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	why's that? I've seen videos of it, and it "works", I just have issues with horrible horrible fps, hence my debugging it
2008-01-28T23:28:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	is there a restricted river for that card?
2008-01-28T23:28:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	I don't believe so, pretty sure it's in-kernel
2008-01-28T23:29:00.000Z	adelie	stealthy	again, someone will likely correct me in just a sec, but I don't think there is a hardware 3d driver for the intel cards under linux
2008-01-28T23:29:00.000Z	stealthy	adelie	there is
