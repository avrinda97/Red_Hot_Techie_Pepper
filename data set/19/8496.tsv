2007-04-01T08:02:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	probably some apache configuration directive
2007-04-01T08:03:00.000Z	rob__	don_j	thats a good starting point cheers
2007-04-01T08:03:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	cheers
2007-04-01T08:03:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	wait a sec. I'm gonna look it up
2007-04-01T08:04:00.000Z	rob__	don_j	cheers
2007-04-01T08:04:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/en/howto/cgi.html
2007-04-01T08:05:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	did you consider using mod_perl ?
2007-04-01T08:05:00.000Z	rob__	don_j	will look in to it, is mod_perl a package?
2007-04-01T08:05:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	yes
2007-04-01T08:06:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	probably a2enmod cgi would work
2007-04-01T08:07:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	This module is already enabled!
2007-04-01T08:07:00.000Z	rob__	don_j	hmm
2007-04-01T08:08:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	 Options +ExecCGI would enable your cgi scripts in that directory
2007-04-01T08:09:00.000Z	rob__	don_j	obviously i would need to restart apache2?
2007-04-01T08:10:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	not if you put that directive in a .htaccess file
2007-04-01T08:22:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	I just got it workin: http://localhost/cgi/test.pl
2007-04-01T08:22:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	I just got it workin: http://80.198.52.129/cgi/test.pl
2007-04-01T08:29:00.000Z	don_j	rob__	though I had to say AllowOverride All instead of none to get it goin'
