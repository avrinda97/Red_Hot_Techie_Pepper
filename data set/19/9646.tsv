2007-01-31T11:28:00.000Z	dimeo		starz... skip vmware... virtualbox is better if u ask me
2007-01-31T11:28:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	would it allow me to install XP on linux remotely?
2007-01-31T11:29:00.000Z	dimeo	rpc	: what do you mean by remotely?
2007-01-31T11:29:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	i would need to run XP or w2k on my remote box that is running debian
2007-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	is that possible to install windows in virtual box like that? without physical access to the box?
2007-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	dimeo	rpc	the best I know for accessing remote pc's is by using freenx
2007-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	assuming that i will transfer windows iso to the box first of course
2007-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	hmm.
2007-01-31T11:31:00.000Z	dimeo	rpc	freenx beats the pants of RDP and VNC
2007-01-31T11:32:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	let me explain... there is a box running debian. i would like to add a virtual machine on that host running windows... can i do it without physical access to the box by using iso image of windows to install?
2007-01-31T11:33:00.000Z	dimeo	rpc	yea virtual box uses isos
2007-01-31T11:34:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	oh hm so it's doable most likely
2007-01-31T11:34:00.000Z	dimeo	rpc	and it's opensource and free
2007-01-31T11:34:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	is that vbox stable?
2007-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	i do
2007-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	rpc	dimeo	there is some software that won't run other way
