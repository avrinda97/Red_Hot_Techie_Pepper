2006-02-23T06:17:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	putty is for many o/s
2006-02-23T06:31:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	because SSH is basically a terminal emulation program

2006-02-23T06:37:00.000Z	phiber_optic	quacker	so how do I run on linux?
2006-02-23T06:39:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	 ~:$ sudo apt-get update; apt-get install putty putty-tools pterm

2006-02-23T06:43:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	do you have the multiverse and universe repositories enabled?
2006-02-23T07:03:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	please quit repeating.  Your question has been answered (several times)
2006-02-23T07:06:00.000Z	phiber_optic	quacker	but your way didnt work
2006-02-23T07:06:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	that's probably because you never enabled the multiverse repositories
2006-02-23T07:08:00.000Z	phiber_optic	quacker	I did install putty
2006-02-23T07:09:00.000Z	quacker	phiber_optic	you have to CONFIGURE putty -- surf around in the GUI and read the docs.  There are plenty
