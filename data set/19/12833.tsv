2009-08-30T19:06:00.000Z	jez		hi people
2009-08-30T19:06:00.000Z	jez		im having troubles with a new Ubuntu install (on a relatively old box)
2009-08-30T19:06:00.000Z	jez		Ubuntu seems to detect the NIC built into my motherboard, but not the PCI card one
2009-08-30T19:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	nor « ifconfig» or « lspci | grep -i net » show it either?
2009-08-30T19:08:00.000Z	jez	erUSUL	no, only shows the mobo one and lo
2009-08-30T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	and « lspci | grep -i net » ?
2009-08-30T19:09:00.000Z	jez	erUSUL	only gives me 1 entry
2009-08-30T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	are you sure the pci card is correctly plugged ? maybe it is just death ?
2009-08-30T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	lspci should show it even if no drivers for linux exist
2009-08-30T19:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	yes
2009-08-30T19:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	try another pci slot on the mobo
2009-08-30T19:27:00.000Z	jez	erUSUL	heh
2009-08-30T19:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	put it in the linux box in another pci slot. and make sure is well placed
2009-08-30T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	ahh ok
2009-08-30T19:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	to share an internet conection ?
2009-08-30T19:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	use firestarter if you want a gui
2009-08-30T19:31:00.000Z	jez	erUSUL	is it on apt-get?
2009-08-30T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	yep
2009-08-30T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	jez	you have to configure your internet connection first of course
