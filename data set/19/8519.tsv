2007-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	are you using Ubuntu?
2007-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	yah
2007-04-04T07:34:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	in gnome if you go to Applications -> Accessories -> Take screenshot.
2007-04-04T07:35:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	i understand you are using Beryl.  I'm not a fan of that eye candy crap, but there is something you can do called a screencast that is video of what you see on the screen.
2007-04-04T07:35:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	ookey ..:)
2007-04-04T07:37:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	I'm having trouble doing it because I'm a n00b.  But you may have Istanbul pre-installed.  It's a screen capture software.
2007-04-05T11:01:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	did you try any of that screencast stuff?
2007-04-05T11:02:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	yah ...working
2007-04-05T11:02:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	i did that through gimp ...!!!!
2007-04-05T11:03:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	you did it?  what exactly did you do?
2007-04-05T11:04:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	file ---->acquire ---->screenshot
2007-04-05T11:04:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	that's for screenshot.  I'm talking about screencast where you can have a video of screen.
2007-04-05T11:05:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	usually i did throuh XVID cap
2007-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	But the rotation of the cube is not showing clearly ... .due to the frame rate
2007-04-05T11:10:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	 You'd have to rotate it slower, i reckon.
2007-04-05T11:10:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	You're not running Gnome, are you?
2007-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	I dont know the shortcut to rotate the cube slower
2007-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	TooR4u	I'm not into that compiz or berykl stuff.
2007-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	TooR4u	PoofDaddy	okey ....
