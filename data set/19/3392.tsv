2009-08-23T03:50:00.000Z	suave		hi everyone!
2009-08-23T03:50:00.000Z	suave		does anyone feel like doing a poor girl a massive, massive favour?
2009-08-23T03:51:00.000Z	suave		ok, i'll just carry on and if anyone can help, please, please do!
2009-08-23T03:51:00.000Z	suave		i'm having some wireless issues on a HP desktop (not this one) that occurred after reinstalling ubuntu
2009-08-23T03:52:00.000Z	suave		basically, when running ifconfig wlan0 up (or down), it comes back saying error while getting interface flags: no such device
2009-08-23T03:53:00.000Z	suave		lspci -v | less shows the wireless device but it can't be enabled, basically
2009-08-23T03:53:00.000Z	suave		what should i do?
2009-08-23T03:54:00.000Z	suave		alternatively, does anyone know how to upgrade intrepid without an internet connection?
2009-08-23T03:54:00.000Z	suave		or am i safe to upgrade straight to jaunty using a disk without intrepid being fully updated?
2009-08-23T03:55:00.000Z	suave		anyone?
2009-08-23T03:55:00.000Z	dajhorn	suave	Look at the apt-zip package.
2009-08-23T03:56:00.000Z	suave	dajhorn	where would i get that from?
2009-08-23T03:56:00.000Z	suave		my own machine doesn't recognise it
2009-08-23T03:56:00.000Z	dajhorn	suave	An Ubuntu computer that has a working Internet connection.  It is in the universe repository.
2009-08-23T03:57:00.000Z	suave	dajhorn	the point is that the computer that's having issues does not have an internet connection
2009-08-23T03:58:00.000Z	dajhorn	suave	To upgrade such a computer, you'll need to get the software somewhere.  Ubuntu has some packages, like apt-zip, that let you download updates/upgrades on one computer and carry it to the disconnected computer.
2009-08-23T03:58:00.000Z	suave	dajhorn	sweet
2009-08-23T03:58:00.000Z	suave		i'll play around with it now
2009-08-23T03:59:00.000Z	suave	dajhorn	will it allow me to download all kernels and updates i'll require to get intrepid fully up to date?
