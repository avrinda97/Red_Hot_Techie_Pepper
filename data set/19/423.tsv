2012-03-02T14:50:00.000Z	Crat_OS		im so frustrated right now with ubuntu
2012-03-02T14:50:00.000Z	Crat_OS		Is there a way I can upgrade to 12.04 from 11.10
2012-03-02T14:51:00.000Z	Crat_OS		11.10 is so damn buggy for me.. Im using gnome-shell and for some reason ushare does not want to work to my 360, samba shares are completely broken and links are not showing up in any of my web browsers
2012-03-02T14:52:00.000Z	Crat_OS		hey guys
2012-03-02T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	wait until 12.04 is released.
2012-03-02T14:52:00.000Z	Crat_OS		if you hold the backspace key a cool sound happens
2012-03-02T14:53:00.000Z	Crat_OS		I should of just stuck to 10.04
2012-03-02T14:53:00.000Z	Crat_OS		nothing seems ot work on 11.10
2012-03-02T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	ok, install 10.04 then
2012-03-02T14:54:00.000Z	Crat_OS		^ everything seems to work better.. is 11.10 just a 'toy' for lack of better words?
2012-03-02T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	stop ranting
2012-03-02T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	if you feel 10.04 is better for you, I suggest using 10.04
2012-03-02T14:55:00.000Z	Crat_OS	ikonia	stop suggesting the obvious
2012-03-02T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	it's clearly not obvious or you would have done it
2012-03-02T14:55:00.000Z	Crat_OS		If you have nothing thats not informative then don
2012-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	you've not asked for information, just ranted, which is why I'm telling you to stop please.
2012-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	Crat_OS		don't say anything at all..
2012-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Crat_OS	if you want a solution, and you've found 10.04 is better for you, it genuinly may be better downgrading to 10.04, while waiting to see how 12.04 works out (in terms of your needs)
2012-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	Crat_OS	ikonia	and your just being a douche which is why im telling you politely to stfu
