2009-06-21T18:03:00.000Z	loof		wow, FINALLY, i figured out how to kill a fullscreen Wine app without logging in remotely
2009-06-21T18:04:00.000Z	loof		should be a default option/keypress in gnome imo'
2009-06-21T18:04:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	jump to tty2 and do wineserver -killall?
2009-06-21T18:04:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	in a fullscreen 3d app in wine you can't do that
2009-06-21T18:05:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	GNOME should steal the keypresses to take you to tty2 before they're passed to wine, then the app has lost focus so doesn't get the later ones...
2009-06-21T18:06:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	if you've not tried it, don't guess and say it'll work. because it doesn't =/
2009-06-21T18:07:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	I have tried it, with portal and HL2, both worked fine
2009-06-21T18:07:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	i mean specifcally in 3d apps in wine
2009-06-21T18:07:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	doesn't work in mass effect
2009-06-21T18:07:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	strange, I'll take your word for it, what was your solution?
2009-06-21T18:08:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts
2009-06-21T18:08:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	does mass effect use ctrl+alt+f* as a keyboard shortcut in-game?
2009-06-21T18:09:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	cos why would keyboard shortcuts work when switching tty (a lower level shortcut) doesn't...?
2009-06-21T18:09:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	makes no sense... but what works, works
2009-06-21T18:10:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	no clue why ctrl-alt-f1 doesn't work, but it doesn't
2009-06-21T18:12:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	nice, but rebooting isn't my idea of elegant, lol
2009-06-21T18:12:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	I wasn't suggesting it, I was explaining it
2009-06-21T18:42:00.000Z	loof	boss_mc	shockwave is old/dying, everyone's moving to flash. why do you need to open aam files?
2009-06-21T18:42:00.000Z	boss_mc	loof	some things havn't updated to modern technologies (isketch is what prompted this line of investigation but there are others)
