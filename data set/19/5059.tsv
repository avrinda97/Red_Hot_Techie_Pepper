2012-09-14T13:43:00.000Z	bekks		As long as there is a row containing the process, the process is running.
2012-09-14T13:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	so if the process is suspended it will not show up at all with the ps command?
2012-09-14T13:45:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	A suspended process is actually running, but doing nothing.
2012-09-14T13:47:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	Too less information to answer your question.
2012-09-14T13:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	you mean, too little information?
2012-09-14T13:48:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	Yes.
2012-09-14T13:48:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	so then how does one know whether a process is running in Linux?
2012-09-14T13:48:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	I was told that this command 'ps' would show the required info?
2012-09-14T13:48:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	It is running when ps returns at least one column.
2012-09-14T13:51:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	You have two processes of "rsync" running. No one can tell you what they are actually doing atm.
2012-09-14T13:52:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	I dunno why there would be two ... there should be one ... oh well .. :P
2012-09-14T13:52:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	ps -ef | grep rsync | wc -l
2012-09-14T13:52:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	There are two.
2012-09-14T13:53:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	that command outputs "4" ... what is that about?
2012-09-14T13:54:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	Then take a look at: ps -ef | grep rsync
2012-09-14T13:55:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	the output http://paste.ubuntu.com/1204437/
2012-09-14T13:56:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	That output is pretty clear :) Three processes were launched for your rsync... command, and one is the "grep" you issued :)
2012-09-14T13:56:00.000Z	bekks	zetheroo	And yes, thats normal.
2012-09-14T13:57:00.000Z	zetheroo	bekks	ok cool ... thanks!
