2007-11-19T15:15:00.000Z	kane77		where should the .conkyrc be? $home?
2007-11-19T15:16:00.000Z	nucco	kane77	perhaps you installed a bad extension?
2007-11-19T15:17:00.000Z	nucco	kane77	i think i've seen firefox crash when flashplayer was installed from adobe's website...
2007-11-19T15:18:00.000Z	kane77	nucco	it might be the cause.. last time I got this it was the flashgot extension... but I don't have that installed now...
2007-11-19T15:20:00.000Z	nucco	kane77	if you run firefox from the terminal, and it dumps core, run 'pwd' then go open the reported directory in your file manager and look for a file called 'core'

2007-11-19T15:25:00.000Z	nucco	kane77	i can't imagine using a text-mode browser in this century... kind of the same with 'text-only' email
