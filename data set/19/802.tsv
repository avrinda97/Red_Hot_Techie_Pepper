2011-08-19T23:51:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	sudo  (not SUDO)
2011-08-19T23:52:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	 "Command not found" is referint to the command, (not sudo).
2011-08-19T23:53:00.000Z	SeCuRe_	usr13	trying sudo
2011-08-19T23:54:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	Again, it is not sudo it is complaining about, it is the command you are using sudo to execute.  (Read what it says.)
2011-08-19T23:54:00.000Z	SeCuRe_	usr13	it does not matter \
2011-08-19T23:55:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	I'm sorry.  Waht is your question?
2011-08-19T23:55:00.000Z	SeCuRe_	usr13	i am just trying to run this simple sudo command
2011-08-19T23:57:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	What the error message is telling you that omap_usbload is not a command.  Now if it is a script or some sort of executable and you want to run it, you will more-than-likely need to set the executable bit on it.  i.e. chmood +x omap3_usbload
2011-08-19T23:59:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	But be sure it is going to do something you really want it to do before you set the executable bit and run it.
2011-08-20T00:03:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	Did you read and follow the instructions on the URL you posted above?
2011-08-20T00:06:00.000Z	SeCuRe_	usr13	i followed the steps over there and come to sudo step last
2011-08-20T00:16:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	Are you sure you did exactly as it said?
2011-08-20T00:18:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	See my pm
2011-08-20T00:53:00.000Z	SeCuRe_	usr13	we came to an end with no success again?
2011-08-20T00:54:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	you left
2011-08-20T00:54:00.000Z	SeCuRe_	usr13	i think ping time out
2011-08-20T00:55:00.000Z	usr13	SeCuRe_	See my pm
