2010-06-01T21:59:00.000Z	joa__		whats the command to install a 32bit curl on a 64bit ubuntu?
2010-06-01T22:00:00.000Z	joa__		so that means if i want to install 32bit curl i have to do it manually?
2010-06-01T22:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	one moment
2010-06-01T22:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	have you downloaded the .deb for it manually by chance?
2010-06-01T22:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	or see if it's in your cache... ls /var/cache/apt/archives/curl*
2010-06-01T22:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	download the .deb. you know where to get it?
2010-06-01T22:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	hello?
2010-06-01T22:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	ok, one moment
2010-06-01T22:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	go here and look down in the far lower left corner to download the package for specific architecture --> http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/curl
2010-06-01T22:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	i should ask of course, why are you wanting to install the 32-bit version on a 64-bit system?
2010-06-01T22:12:00.000Z	joa__	onetinsoldier	its a dependency for something
2010-06-01T22:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	can yo show me the message you get for this dependency problem?
2010-06-01T22:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	ok, i'll have a look. hang on
2010-06-01T22:15:00.000Z	joa__	onetinsoldier	thank you, dont waste your time :) its quite annoying to deal with this issue
2010-06-01T22:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	well, if i were you, i'd just try it first with the 64-bit version installed
2010-06-01T22:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	you can always remove it and install the 32-bit version, if you really have to
2010-06-01T22:17:00.000Z	joa__	onetinsoldier	guess what im doing ;)
2010-06-01T22:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	what?
2010-06-01T22:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	joa__	trying it with the 64-bit version i hope :)
