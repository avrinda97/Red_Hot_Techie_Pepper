2007-04-16T06:14:00.000Z	noesc		anyone here available to helping me with webcam grabbing?
2007-04-16T06:14:00.000Z	epod	noesc	what do you mean?
2007-04-16T06:15:00.000Z	noesc	epod	I try to use my Philips webcam together with aMSN. But aMSN returns: "no videograbber available"
2007-04-16T06:16:00.000Z	epod	noesc	then I'm guessing that you don't have it installed properly.  Unfortunately I can't help you with that for that webcam.  Maybe check ubuntuforums.org
2007-04-16T06:17:00.000Z	noesc	epod	thanks. But my v4l recognise the cam as Philips 740 (inside aMSN)
2007-04-16T06:18:00.000Z	epod	noesc	if you install camorama, does it capture the input?
2007-04-16T06:18:00.000Z	noesc	epod	So I guess that some kind of database of webcams and identifies somehow
2007-04-16T06:18:00.000Z	noesc	epod	will try.. brb
2007-04-16T06:22:00.000Z	noesc	epod	It shows that I have 10.00 fps -current and 10.14 fps -average. But only grey picture
2007-04-16T06:23:00.000Z	epod	noesc	odd.  so /dev/video is working, eh?  I don't know why aMSN won't see it, then
2007-04-16T06:23:00.000Z	epod	noesc	sorry
2007-04-16T06:23:00.000Z	noesc	epod	in camorama I just get a grey picture, but camorama says that I have fps (its changing a bit so it should be "ok" and not just a fix value)
2007-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	epod	noesc	ohh, just plain grey, no actual image?
2007-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	noesc	epod	np, I'll look somewhere else for help ;)
2007-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	noesc	epod	plain grey
2007-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	epod	noesc	yeah, thats not right.  lol
2007-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	noesc	epod	*not really ok* =)
2007-04-16T06:26:00.000Z	noesc	epod	I'll try to find info somewhere else. Everyone is just spamming questions here =) Not easy to help anyone. Thanks for trying at least
