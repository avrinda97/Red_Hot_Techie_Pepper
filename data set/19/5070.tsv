2012-11-19T22:32:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		For some reason, jockey-gtk isn't available to me
2012-11-19T22:32:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		it's installed, but it's not runable
2012-11-19T22:32:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		anyone any idea?
2012-11-19T22:33:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Ian_Corne	just type jockey in the run command
2012-11-19T22:33:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		nothing found
2012-11-19T22:33:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		$ jockey
2012-11-19T22:33:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		jockey: command not found
2012-11-19T22:33:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		aha
2012-11-19T22:34:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		nice
2012-11-19T22:34:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		it's weird to put it with software sources..
2012-11-19T22:35:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Ian_Corne	the run command is alt+f2 , not the terminal
2012-11-19T22:35:00.000Z	Ian_Corne		doesn't work, it proposes jockey-text
2012-11-19T22:36:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!who | Ian_Corne
2012-11-19T22:37:00.000Z	Ian_Corne	BluesKaj	I will ok :), as I said, it proposes jockey-txt, but the software-sources window has it now
2012-11-19T22:38:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Ian_Corne	strange things going on with gnome/unity ...  losing touch
2012-11-19T22:39:00.000Z	Ian_Corne	BluesKaj	yeah, they're just regrouping I guess, but it seems it would be beter suited to be in the software center
2012-11-19T22:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Ian_Corne	I've been on kde for several yrs , at least it's a bit more consistent
2012-11-19T22:42:00.000Z	Ian_Corne	BluesKaj	kde is not for me, tried it and didn't suit me well =)
2012-11-19T22:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Ian_Corne	I wasn't suggesting it was , merely pointing out there seem to be a lot of changes in ubuntu , that we don't see in kubuntu
