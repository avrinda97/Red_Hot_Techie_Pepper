2008-05-30T06:05:00.000Z	exerdigit	mungallo	i just thought there would be something simple... i cant imagine this can be that deep of a problem...i just havent a clue where to begin
2008-05-30T06:07:00.000Z	exerdigit	mungallo	hmm... the problem is definitely in gnome you think? or could it be just about anything at this point, i mean, based off what i told you??
