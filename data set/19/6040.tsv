2008-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	eric84		i've been unable to get my wireless running, i have the ssid, password, dhcp auto, etc set up correctly, sudo ifup wifi0 reports network is down... any suggestions please?
2008-04-08T11:20:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	what card
2008-04-08T11:21:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	it's a d-link, reported as intersil corporation prism 2.5 wavelan chipset
2008-04-08T11:21:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	does ifconfig show two entries or three
2008-04-08T11:23:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	any drivers installed for that card?
2008-04-08T11:24:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	according to device manager, hostap_pci is installed
2008-04-08T11:25:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	do you have the bus ID on that?
2008-04-08T11:25:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	as in info.bus? that's reported type: string and value: pci
2008-04-08T11:27:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	did you see my last reply?
2008-04-08T11:37:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	doin alright?
2008-04-08T11:42:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	it seems from the forums that ndiswrapper is the best for that card; can you get hold of the windows drivers?
2008-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	sorry to keep bothering you, do you have a minute or two?
2008-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	it seems that ndiswrapper is the best bet for that card; do you have the windows drivers
2008-04-08T12:00:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	probably in a dusty box somewhere, should i dl ndiswrapper and then copy it over to the ubuntu machine?
2008-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	that seems to be the best choice at this point; lots of bugs in launchpad and gutsy with that card--many of them closed unresolved
2008-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	thanks for your help... any recommendations on a cheap new card that would work well? ;)
2008-04-08T12:02:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	this is for a desktop or a laptop
2008-04-08T12:02:00.000Z	bazhang	eric84	atheros perhaps but avoid broadcom if at all possible
2008-04-08T12:03:00.000Z	eric84	bazhang	will do, thanks again
