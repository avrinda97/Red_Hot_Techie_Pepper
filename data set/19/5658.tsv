2008-08-25T00:44:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	I have that installed
2008-08-25T00:44:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	let me find the link to how to get it
2008-08-25T00:45:00.000Z	Kartagis	perillux	thanks :)
2008-08-25T00:47:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	you can try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Japanese_Input_and_Fonts_in_Ubuntu_8.04_using_SCIM
2008-08-25T00:47:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	but it looks like a lot more work then what I had to do.  I'm gonna keep looking
2008-08-25T00:49:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	actually I think the only thing you really have to do it go to System>Administration>Language Support
2008-08-25T00:50:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	then simply check Japanese and then make sure the default language is still English (if u want) then make sure to check "Enable support to enter complex characters." hit apply, restart X and that should be it.
2008-08-25T00:51:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	but then you might want to read that guide also in case they have some other things of interest.
2008-08-25T00:53:00.000Z	Kartagis	perillux	it's downloading some packages now
2008-08-25T00:54:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	cool, if you need help configuring it when your done let me know.
2008-08-25T01:07:00.000Z	Kartagis	perillux	are you there?
2008-08-25T01:07:00.000Z	perillux	Kartagis	yes
