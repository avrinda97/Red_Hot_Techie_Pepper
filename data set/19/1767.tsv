2010-10-14T21:20:00.000Z	Sven12345		hello how do i make my videos on my computer run more smothly and work better, basically what programs do i download to make videos run more smothly
2010-10-14T21:20:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	get a faster computer or run less programs
2010-10-14T21:21:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	haha i know the videos can run more smothly since i also have windows on this very same computer so i want to know which programs can make the videos run equally as smothly as in windows
2010-10-14T21:21:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	are they flash videos?
2010-10-14T21:22:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	no mkv videos
2010-10-14T21:22:00.000Z	Sven12345		kmo201 yes vlc will play them but i want a smother playing with less grainy picture and less hacking just as it works in windows
2010-10-14T21:23:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	then still the same applies, prob. windows has access to hardware decoding and linux doesn't, if you run the proper drivers already there is no program to fix that
2010-10-14T21:23:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	how do i check if i have the most update drivers and how do i update them and how do check which decoders are running
2010-10-14T21:27:00.000Z	Sven12345		how do i check if i have the latest nvidia drivers for ubuntu?
2010-10-14T21:29:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	what graphics card do you have? I don't think checking codecs will do anything, there are no better/worse ones
2010-10-14T21:29:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	i have nvidia 220 GT
2010-10-14T21:31:00.000Z	step21		run the assistant that allows you to install the 3rd party drivers
2010-10-14T21:32:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	what assistant?
2010-10-14T21:32:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	System->Administration->Hardware Drivers
2010-10-14T21:32:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	yes i did that but is that the latest drivers?
2010-10-14T21:32:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	there should be a box to check if they aren't installed
2010-10-14T21:33:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	it is allready installed but what i want to know if the latest drivers are installed
2010-10-14T21:33:00.000Z	step21	Sven12345	yes, update manager will tell you when new versionsa are available
2010-10-14T21:34:00.000Z	Sven12345	step21	i think you dont know what you are talking about
