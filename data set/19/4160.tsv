2011-04-08T00:13:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	ok
2011-04-08T00:00:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	grub-pc is nto compatible with version 1 of grub
2011-04-08T00:02:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	and ?
2011-04-08T00:03:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	you probably have version 1 of grub installed, which is why it insists on running that upgrade to grub2
2011-04-08T00:03:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	but it wasn't tha case before
2011-04-08T00:03:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	the description of grub-pc is pretty clear on it not being compatible with grub-legacy(version 1_
2011-04-08T00:04:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	I don't want to install grub2
2011-04-08T00:04:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	then you can not install the grub-pc package
2011-04-08T00:05:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	just look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 : it says that you can upgrade to grub2, but you don't have to
2011-04-08T00:05:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	correct
2011-04-08T00:05:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	but that's not what happens
2011-04-08T00:06:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	if you install grub-pc, you're upgraded automatically to grub2
2011-04-08T00:06:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	if you do not install grub-pc you will not have to upgrade right
2011-04-08T00:06:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	but with grub1, there is no entry for my Windows XP
2011-04-08T00:07:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	if you check the description, grub-pc is the package containing grub2
2011-04-08T00:09:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	of course it does
2011-04-08T00:10:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	i dont understand , off course it does what?
2011-04-08T00:10:00.000Z	gribouille	acicula	shutdown correctly
2011-04-08T00:10:00.000Z	acicula	gribouille	can you try anyway and then try running update-grub?
