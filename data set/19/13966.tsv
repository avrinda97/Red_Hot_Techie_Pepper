2004-11-30T17:02:00.000Z	mirak		damn, I don't have a home, and no browser want to run without home
2004-11-30T17:02:00.000Z	mirak		that's hallucinating
2004-11-30T17:02:00.000Z	mirak		lol, I must browse as root
2004-11-30T17:02:00.000Z	mirak		:p
2004-11-30T17:03:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	how on earth did your home disappear?!?
2004-11-30T17:03:00.000Z	mirak	paul_	it doesn't disapeared, I can't mount it
2004-11-30T17:03:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	oh, it was on another partition?
2004-11-30T17:04:00.000Z	mirak	paul_	yes
2004-11-30T17:04:00.000Z	mirak	paul_	but in fact I wanted to install 2.6.9 kernel, but I realised I installed unstable kernel
2004-11-30T17:05:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	maybe try using a LiveCD or something -- I guess the filesystem drivers in 2.6.9 are borked -- and try mounting /home from there.
2004-11-30T17:06:00.000Z	mirak	paul_	I am serching how to have a bigger resolution in the fb
2004-12-14T12:51:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	that happens to me every so often too... if you still have Nautilus running (i.e., you still have icons on your desktop) you can right-click on the desktop, choose 'Run terminal', then go 'killall gnome-panel' (without the quotation marks), and the panels will die... then GNOME will (should) automatically restart the panels.
2004-12-14T12:52:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	so your panels always disappear?
2004-12-14T12:52:00.000Z	mirak	paul_	fortunately I have a consol because it was savec in the last session
2004-12-14T12:52:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	dandy :)
2004-12-14T12:52:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	does this happen every time you start up your user session?
2004-12-14T12:53:00.000Z	mirak	paul_	the last two sessions yes
2004-12-14T12:54:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	weird. maybe delete your ~/.gnome2/session file.
2004-12-14T12:55:00.000Z	paul_	mirak	if you have any programs that you've set to start up automatically (e.g., gaim, Skype, or a wallpaper changer), you'll lose those settings, but hopefully that's no big loss if you can get your panels back...
