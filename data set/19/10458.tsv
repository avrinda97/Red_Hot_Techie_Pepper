2006-11-15T08:19:00.000Z	lwizardl		why is it when it comes to a ubuntu desktop everyone is able to help, but when it comes to a web server no one ever answers anything, what you guys automatically think its someone trying to break into a machine?
2006-11-15T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	it's more likely that no one knows the answer
2007-08-17T08:50:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	what filesystem?
2007-08-17T08:51:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	use chmod and/or chown on the directory you mounted the partition to to change the permissions to waht you want
2007-08-17T08:57:00.000Z	lwizardl	jrib	I have the folder where I mounted the drive to as 777 but now i just gotta figure out the chown command
2007-08-17T08:57:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	if you made it 777 then it doesn't really mayyer who is the owner
2007-08-17T08:58:00.000Z	lwizardl	jrib	still says "You do not have permissions to write to this folder."
2007-08-17T08:58:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	press "reload" in nautilus
2007-08-17T08:59:00.000Z	lwizardl	jrib	ok it works now thanks
2007-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	lwizardl	jrib	ok I was wrong I can drag and drop files into the drive but I can not create folders etc from  within the gui
2007-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	join me in #ubuntu-classroom
2008-06-25T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	use the 'split' command
2008-06-25T03:36:00.000Z	lwizardl	jrib	has to be usable on other systems such as windows or mac
2008-06-25T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	meh, don't know then
2008-06-25T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	there are commands to join the files on windows and macs (macs might even have split), but I don't know them
2008-08-28T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	system -> preferences -> removable drives and media  and  edit -> preferences -> media in nautilus
2008-08-28T03:07:00.000Z	lwizardl	jrib	how do i edit that for nautilus
2008-08-28T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	click on it?
2012-03-04T06:29:00.000Z	jrib	lwizardl	ctrl-shift-numlock
