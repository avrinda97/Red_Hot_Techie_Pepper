2009-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	bruce_		if I have a package, and it has tons of file, how can I find a particular function in that package?
2009-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	bruce_		grep or find? or something like that?
2009-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	bruce_		hold on
2009-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	bruce_		so I cd in the folder right
2009-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	bruce_		coz I have irssi source downlodae
2009-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	bruce_		I wanna know how to handle the command privmsg
2009-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	bruce_		that's what I want
2009-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	bruce_		grep "somefunction"
2009-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	bruce_		let me try
2009-01-23T10:50:00.000Z	bruce_		do I need the quote?
2009-01-23T10:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	try running this in irssi's source directory: grep -nHR "function-name" .
2009-01-23T10:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	no, but you will need them if what you are searching for contains spaces
2009-01-23T10:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	yes
2009-01-23T10:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	although you could use -inHR instead of -nHR to make it case-insensitive
2009-01-23T10:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	did you include the . at the end of the command?
2009-01-23T10:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	that was necessary.  Hit ctrl+C then do grep -nHR PRIVMSG .
2009-01-23T10:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	page up/page down
2009-01-23T10:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	also, if you want to know how the irc protocol works, you may want to look at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459
2009-01-23T10:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	bruce_	2812 has some elements which only apply to IRCnet and its ircd but not to other networks and ircds
