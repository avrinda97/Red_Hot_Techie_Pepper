2008-04-28T18:25:00.000Z	christophe		Hi all.
2008-04-28T18:25:00.000Z	christophe		did someone managed to tun 8.04 properly on a USB key?
2008-04-28T18:25:00.000Z	christophe		to run
2008-04-28T18:25:00.000Z	bazhang	christophe	sure people in #eeepc have
2008-04-28T18:26:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	mine hang after login
2008-04-28T18:26:00.000Z	bazhang	christophe	well it will be very very slow--hang is probably sop
2008-04-28T18:26:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	sop?
2008-04-28T18:28:00.000Z	bazhang	christophe	two possible problems--your bios does not allow it; or you did it improperly--does it boot on other computers fine
2008-04-28T18:29:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	I have tried different usb keys, on different laptops: same behaviour
2008-04-28T18:33:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	my BIOS allows it perfectly
2008-04-28T18:33:00.000Z	bazhang	christophe	well then try booting from it on another computer
2008-04-28T18:34:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	as I said, I did: same behaviour
2008-04-28T18:34:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	there is a issue somewhere
2008-04-28T18:34:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	but no error message
2008-04-28T18:34:00.000Z	bazhang	christophe	not sure what to tell you--may be done incorrectly
2008-04-28T18:35:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	done incorrectly? what?
2008-04-28T18:36:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	I have installed couple of Ubuntu on USB keys, never faced that
2008-04-28T18:36:00.000Z	bazhang	christophe	well you are more of an expert than I
2008-04-28T18:36:00.000Z	christophe	bazhang	not impossible ;)
