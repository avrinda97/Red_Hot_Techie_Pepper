2007-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	Andeh		Aaaeeekk!!!
2007-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	Andeh		GAIM still has a stupid BACKSPACE shortcut that messes everything up!!!
2007-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	Andeh		Even AFTER reinstalling it!!!
2007-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	Backspace shortcut?
2007-04-17T12:48:00.000Z	Andeh		When i press Backspace, it opens a dialog to join a conversation
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	Andeh		Somehow this got configured today
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	Really? I've never heard of that problem
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	Andeh		I just reinstalled gaim and its still there!
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	Andeh		I checked my Preferences.xml, it doesnt mention backspace
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	But the Gaim settings are in ~/.gaim, and they're not restored by reinstalling
2007-04-17T12:49:00.000Z	Andeh		i know
2007-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	If you really are desperate, I guess you could just erase that directory
2007-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	Andeh	AmyRose	What will happen to gaim if i do that?
2007-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	It will go back to the way it was when you first used it
2007-04-17T12:50:00.000Z	Andeh	AmyRose	i think ill delete everything except my contacts
2007-04-17T12:51:00.000Z	Andeh		Ok i have to go
2007-04-17T12:51:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	But for a less destructive fix...yeabh
2007-04-17T12:51:00.000Z	Andeh		be back in 15 min or so
2007-04-17T12:51:00.000Z	AmyRose	Andeh	that's what I was going to type
