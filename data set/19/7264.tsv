2007-09-27T15:46:00.000Z	dead_alive		Hi, I have a Audio Related Problem in Ubuntu 7.04.  Audio Device: Intel HDA. It was working fine until today. I don't know what exactly is the problem, I can hear no Sound on my HeadPhone not on the Front Speakers.  Can anyone help ? Or tell me how to re-install Sound Driver ?
