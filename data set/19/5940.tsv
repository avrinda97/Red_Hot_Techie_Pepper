2008-07-09T00:29:00.000Z	maek		man my computer is the heater in my room but not when I run ubuntu cause it manages the CPU efficiently and therefore less load and heat
2008-07-09T00:30:00.000Z	maek		maybe I should run Windows Vista temporarily to heat up the room ..lolz
2008-07-09T00:30:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	why not do something useful to heighten CPU load, like run a grid project?
2008-07-09T00:31:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	in particular I'd advise the climateprediction.net project. Gives your CPU a good workout and helps research into a serious problem to boot.
2008-07-09T00:32:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	I do that. :-/
2008-07-09T00:32:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	doesn't cause any particular increase in load.
2008-07-09T00:33:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	running 10 beta 2.
2008-07-09T00:34:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	fluctuates at about 50% for both cores when playing Amaranth on YouTube.
2008-07-09T00:34:00.000Z	maek	DanielRM	oh okay ... it made all the flash elements flickery and crashed Firefox 3 a lot on mine
2008-07-09T00:35:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	it stopped my Firefox crashes with Flash but I do have flicker.
2008-07-09T00:36:00.000Z	maek	DanielRM	so like you were getting crashes on Beta 1 and then Beta 2 fixed your crashes ??
2008-07-09T00:36:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	I got crashes using 9; I last used beta 1 a long time ago so I can't remember if that crashed.
2008-07-09T00:38:00.000Z	maek	DanielRM	oh okay yeah Beta 1 crashes a lot less than 9 did ... its good to see that those Adobe drongoes have a good stable Flash on the horizon
2008-07-09T00:38:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	it makes a change, certainly.
2008-07-09T00:40:00.000Z	maek	DanielRM	wasn't that drop down menus behind the flash element the most annoying bug ever in 9 ... they fixed it in Beta 2
2008-07-09T00:40:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	oh, definitely!
2008-07-09T00:41:00.000Z	maek	DanielRM	and I hope that Flash player 10 will be fully compatible with Compiz including YouTube full screen videos under Compiz
2008-07-09T00:42:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	why, was that buggy?
2008-07-09T00:45:00.000Z	DanielRM	maek	I don't remember that happening. :-/
