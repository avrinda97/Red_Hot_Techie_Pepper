2006-05-10T12:53:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	the same goes for you --  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2006-05-10T13:00:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	I installed the blackdown java package and firefox still says it's missing the plugin. anything more I need to do?
2006-05-10T13:01:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	did you read through that page completely? There was a section on "Java in firefox" or something

2006-05-18T15:07:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	you can use mencoder, but it probably doesn't qualify as easy.
2006-05-18T15:07:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	how not-easy is it?
2006-05-18T15:11:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	are you comfortable with using the command line?
2006-05-18T15:11:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	I have nothing against it.
2006-05-18T15:13:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	Read the mencoder section of this page: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/video-playback.html
2006-05-18T15:13:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	(or the transcode section for that matter)
2006-05-18T15:14:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	which do you recommend?
2006-05-18T15:17:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	"To convert input.avi to the MPEG4 codec with MPEG3 audio encoding" -- is this what you want?
2006-05-18T15:17:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	I think I need MPEG 1 or 2... I need this to make a video CD in K3b
2006-05-18T15:18:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	oh, then just use the GUIs, should be easier to figure out :)
2006-05-18T15:19:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	so what package do I need?
2006-05-18T15:19:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	the ones crazy_penguin said (gtranscode, avidemux)
2006-05-18T15:20:00.000Z	blasph	hastesaver	both or just whichever?
2006-05-18T15:20:00.000Z	hastesaver	blasph	granscode should be enough
