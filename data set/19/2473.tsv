2010-07-18T00:27:00.000Z	charles__		This channel is here as a community resource, correct? WTF is with your attitudes? If your not going to help STFU!
2010-07-18T00:28:00.000Z	charles__		Thank you. Now is there something I can do? Surely one of you has an ipod and you manage it from Ubuntu.
2010-07-18T00:29:00.000Z	charles__		besides telling him to buy a mac.
2010-07-18T00:29:00.000Z	charles__		screw mac
2010-07-18T00:29:00.000Z	charles__		and trend whores
2010-07-18T00:31:00.000Z	charles__		that used to work. until I "ejected" the device. Now it doesn't show up as an attached device...
2010-07-18T00:31:00.000Z	charles__		not even on an XP machine with itunes installed
2010-07-18T00:32:00.000Z	Oer	charles__	then reset the ipod
2010-07-18T00:32:00.000Z	charles__		i already "reset settings" on the ipod
2010-07-18T00:32:00.000Z	charles__		i ejected from nautilus
2010-07-18T00:32:00.000Z	charles__		the ipod itself works.
2010-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	charles__		as I explained earlier, there is noting in /dev/ for that device.
2010-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	charles__		no... it's not in /media/ or /mnt
2010-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	Oer		if the iPod won't connect in windows nor ubuntu, it;s a ipod issue, reset with cd should cure it.
2010-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	charles__		i explained all this already
2010-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	charles__		i know, valbaca
2010-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	charles__		yes, devhell i was talking to you
2010-07-18T00:35:00.000Z	charles__		i can't mount it because there is no /dev/sd*
2010-07-18T00:36:00.000Z	charles__	Oer	what do you mean "reset with cd"? i don't have the cd. Is this something that I can download
