2008-02-01T07:25:00.000Z	compy	nemilar	k thanks
2008-02-01T07:25:00.000Z	nemilar		yep
2008-02-01T07:25:00.000Z	nemilar	compy	won't necessarily work if the DVD is copy-protected
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	compy	nemilar	it fails on k9copy... but every other dvd has worked with k9copy
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	compy		coudl it be a wierd copy protection or are there other libs i should get
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	nemilar	compy	are these movies?
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	compy		i have libdvdcss2
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	compy		ye
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	nemilar	compy	might be copy protection, yeah
2008-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	compy		ok
2008-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar		there's lots of different copy protections, they changed after css was cracked
2008-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	compy		its wierd how i own my own movies but cant access them
2008-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	compy	nemilar	is there a list you know of that i should download
2008-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar	compy	you can find workaround on the web...a lot of them are basically "have mplayer play it, but dump the video into a file" kind of things
