2006-06-24T08:21:00.000Z	__mikem		The best emulation solution is vmware, case closed
2006-06-24T08:22:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	yeah, I never had much luck with Wine
2006-06-24T08:22:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	cedega is prety solid for gaming, but not much else, wine is only good for running certain programs like office.
2006-06-24T08:23:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	Yes. You need to buy one of those for sure for gaming. For office, I really like openoffice anyway so that's not a problem
2006-06-24T08:24:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	aggreed, I like open office so much, I don't even use ms office when I am in windows
2006-06-24T08:24:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	I have secretly installed it in a couple of computers at work (MS ones) and I don't think anyone realizes it!
2006-06-24T08:25:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	have you seen those users actually use it and not realize whats going on, or do they just not know its there
2006-06-24T08:26:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	Yeah. I've seen them open MS office files and they don't know. They don't know computers either
2006-06-24T08:27:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	thats scary, considering a lot of the options are under different menus and in different places on open office than they are on ms office
2006-06-24T08:45:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	I too like XFCE, but I don't know how to use it properly yet. Gnome does everything I want for now
2006-06-24T08:46:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	you should play around with xfce, you can get a live cd of xubuntu, and that should be plenty
2006-06-24T08:47:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	Done that. Play with it sometimes.
2006-06-24T08:50:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	I like the minimalist approach. Have you tried Slax? I like Debian too much to go there completely, but they have a nice small system like DSL that can fit on a business card cd
2006-06-24T08:50:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	I have another virtual machine with freebsd on it, so I do minimalist systems also, I sort of swing both ways
2006-06-24T08:51:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	Good for you. I never tire of trying new things. That's what brought me out of the singular system mind set
2006-06-24T08:56:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	Sometimes I feel that the maturity of some of the older GUI's wins. They may be hungrier resource wise, but it's easier to figure them out and use their file systems. I do like them to be pretty, and I do like them to be fast. The glitz I can do without.
2006-06-24T08:57:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	was that relating back to the desktop discussion we were having before?
2006-06-24T08:58:00.000Z	DonL	__mikem	Sorry. I just had a huge split and all I saw on screen was the old stuff.
2006-06-24T08:58:00.000Z	__mikem	DonL	its alright, it was an interesting point anyway
