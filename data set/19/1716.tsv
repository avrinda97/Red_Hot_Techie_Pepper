2010-10-22T05:59:00.000Z	Niaobu		Hi, i'm trying to install Ubuntu server 10.10 from a usb stick, and it refuses to load installer components from cd (since there is no cd in the drive). what am i doing wrong? (checked md5 checksums)
2010-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	how did you create the usb stick?
2010-10-22T06:01:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	followed the description on the ubuntu website
2010-10-22T06:02:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	That's odd you should not need a cd at all.
2010-10-22T06:04:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	nor am i using one. the installer refuses to complete though
2010-10-22T06:04:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	what is the exact error you are getting?
2010-10-22T06:05:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	give me 30 secs
2010-10-22T06:06:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	Loadd installer components from CD: There was a prmblem reading data from the CD-ROM. Please make sure it is in the drive. If retrying does not work, you should check the integrity of your CD-ROM.
2010-10-22T06:07:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	thats a generic error its not actually trying to read from the cdrom its having issues reading the data on the thumb drive.
2010-10-22T06:07:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	you said you performed a md5sum on the usb drive?
2010-10-22T06:07:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	yes
2010-10-22T06:08:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	Something is going on I would recreate the stick using unetbootin or usb creator.
2010-10-22T06:08:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	well not on the usb drive, but on the .iso i downloaded
2010-10-22T06:08:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	oh you need to perform a check on the usb drive in addition to the iso
2010-10-22T06:08:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	let me get you a link
2010-10-22T06:09:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	read it carefully you need to specify the size of the iso to the dd comand to get the appropriate amount of data
2010-10-22T06:09:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	i'm assuming you will find a mismatch due to your data errors
2010-10-22T06:09:00.000Z	Niaobu	histo	thanks, i'll be back if i cant figure it out :)
2010-10-22T06:10:00.000Z	histo	Niaobu	it's pretty straight forward other than they give you a bad example at first and explain why
