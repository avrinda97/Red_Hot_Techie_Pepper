2010-09-11T20:42:00.000Z	SubCool		hey- can someone help explain something to me? i am trying to sudo apt-get install xinerama, although the error  E: Couldn't find package xinerama
2010-09-11T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	there is no such package. xinerama is an old extension of xwindows
2010-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	SubCool	erUSUL	aww- ok. so what would be a good dual monitor software? my google keeps pulling me back to that. And the software is tring to make my second monitor the main monitor. Other than when i try to correct it- it combines them.. i think i have an xorg issue- but im not too good at diagnoising this- does the xorg have a log i can view to make sure it is running correctly?
2010-09-11T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	if you have nvidia with prop drivers use nvidia-settings/twinview
2010-09-11T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	for others use System>Preferences>display
2010-09-11T20:48:00.000Z	SubCool	erUSUL	nah i have ati. And i am trying to use display- thats whats messing me up. Its not properly idenitfying the monitors
2010-09-11T20:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	i do not have multiple monitors. can't help further. maybe ati propietary drivers have its own tool too
2010-09-11T20:50:00.000Z	SubCool	erUSUL	um- i have run across Xorg configs to work with.. but thats y im asking. I had a missing xorg to begin with.. so im not even sure what the computer is using as a default thanks alot.
2010-09-11T20:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	newer Xwindows do not need the file they just autoconfigure themselves at runtime, if xorg.conf is present is obeyed though
2010-09-11T20:53:00.000Z	SubCool	erUSUL	oh- ididnt know that. Well thanks you've been of great help.. imma get lunch now..
2010-09-24T02:06:00.000Z	SubCool	erUSUL	ok- any recommended?
2010-09-24T02:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	dunno; never done a screencast myself
2010-09-24T14:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	move the home folder and use the steps in the clone factoid
2010-09-24T15:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	SubCool	to move the home folder just tar it up « tar cvzpf /path/to/data/disk/home_backup.tar.gz $HOME »
2010-09-24T15:00:00.000Z	SubCool	erUSUL	Awesome- thanks!
