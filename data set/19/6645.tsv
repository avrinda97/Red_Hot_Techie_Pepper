2008-01-06T07:19:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	Then fiddle with the desktop settings.
2008-01-06T07:20:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	apps/nautilus/desktop is where the settings you want are stored
2008-01-06T07:21:00.000Z	Stwange		found it, thanks RyanPrior and iN00DLE
2008-01-06T07:22:00.000Z	Stwange		ok RyanPrior I enabled the icons but they still aren't there, do I have to reboot?
2008-01-06T07:22:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	restarting X should be enough.

2008-01-06T07:25:00.000Z	Stwange	RyanPrior	I restarted X with ctrl-alt-backspace, but still no icons. I guess it's not THAT important :)
2008-01-06T07:25:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	Hmm... maybe you disabled the icons somewhere else?
2008-01-06T07:26:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	Can you create new icons on the desktop?
2008-01-06T07:26:00.000Z	Stwange	RyanPrior	I can't even right click
2008-01-06T07:28:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	still here? I might have figured it out.
2008-01-06T07:29:00.000Z	Stwange		im here RyanPrior
2008-01-06T07:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Stwange	You'll also need to make sure that "show_desktop" is set to true in apps/nautilus/preferences

2008-01-06T07:30:00.000Z	Stwange		sweet thanks RyanPrior :) don't want to push it, but you don't know anything about external drives do you?
