2007-05-30T06:20:00.000Z	melon		anybody know some tips (or links) for setting up a belkin wireless router in ubuntu? i just get dead ends..
2007-05-30T06:20:00.000Z	ward_	melon	should just work standard, what's the problem?
2007-05-30T06:21:00.000Z	ward_	melon	i happen to have a belkin myself
2007-05-30T06:21:00.000Z	ward_	melon	wired / wireless?
2007-05-30T06:22:00.000Z	ward_	melon	if ubuntu finds your card there's a icon on the top right of your screen
2007-05-30T06:22:00.000Z	ward_	melon	if its there and u clock it u should see a list of the available networks
2007-05-30T06:23:00.000Z	ward_	melon	its also important u pick the right incription, and if its hex or not, etc
2007-05-30T06:25:00.000Z	ward_	melon	how do u mean hook it up? your wireless card?
2007-05-30T06:26:00.000Z	ward_	melon	i have no experience with USB adapters, its possible ubuntu doesnt detect it (not every card / usb card is suported)
2007-05-30T06:27:00.000Z	ward_	melon	what u could try first is boot your computer with the USB card allready plugged in
2007-05-30T06:27:00.000Z	ward_	melon	u can do that too, wired everything sohuld work out of the box
2007-05-30T06:28:00.000Z	ward_	melon	no problem
2007-05-30T07:24:00.000Z	melon	ward_	works.. slow.. but works
2007-05-30T07:32:00.000Z	ward_	melon	i was away
2007-05-30T07:32:00.000Z	ward_	melon	what works? the wifi?
2007-05-30T07:46:00.000Z	ward_	melon	u could try searching for your usb adapter on the internet, to see if there's a working driver for your model
2007-05-30T07:47:00.000Z	ward_	melon	to search use "modelname ubuntu" or something
2007-05-30T07:49:00.000Z	ward_	melon	can u give me the model, brand, etc of you usb card?
2007-05-30T07:52:00.000Z	ward_	melon	see, wols probably found it trough google :p
