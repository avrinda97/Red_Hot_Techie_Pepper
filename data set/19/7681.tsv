2007-07-18T10:52:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	asc	It may work fine, but I'm looking for fast, as well.
2007-07-18T10:52:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Well, if you open too many programs it will get slow. :p
2007-07-18T10:52:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	The system can take up to 400 MB of RAM if you have enough to spare, but it can get down to like 64 before it starts paging much.
2007-07-18T10:59:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Either works, but Xubuntu will use less disk space, if that's a concern.
2007-07-18T11:00:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	xfce4 uses a different settings daemon than GNOME. Your gnome settings should remain the same, but they won't be used.
2007-07-18T11:01:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	asc	So basically I lose the settings, etc?
2007-07-18T11:01:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	asc	I mean, they're still there, but none is used...that's about the same as not having them, yeah?
2007-07-18T11:02:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Yeah, pretty much.
2007-07-18T11:02:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Xfce has equivalent control panels for most things.
2007-07-18T11:02:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	asc	Will I have to reinstall things such as ntfs-3g, or Java Desktop Environment?
2007-07-18T11:02:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	No.
2007-07-18T11:03:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	asc	Can I choose which environment to boot into/
2007-07-18T11:03:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Yes. You can select at the login screen.
2007-07-18T11:04:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	You can do 'sudo apt-get install xfce4' in a terminal.
2007-07-18T11:20:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Use the 'logout' option in the shutdown screen-thing.
2007-07-18T11:24:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Did you login at any point?
2007-07-18T11:24:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	asc	Yes.
2007-07-18T11:25:00.000Z	asc	ThanatosDrive	Look for a 'sessions' menu on the login screen. Xfce will be an option there.
