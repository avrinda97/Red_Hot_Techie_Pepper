2010-04-22T02:44:00.000Z	Taz		Okay, thank you. I installed Karmic on my Macbook 5,1 recently and am now having a few issues related to Wine/gaming and my microphone. In short, my microphone originally seemed to work but after I applied an alsamixer patch to fix it, in the sound preferences there's now only a digital audio output, which seems to have disabled the microphone. Is there any way to force ubuntu to recognize my microphone again?
2010-04-22T02:45:00.000Z	Taz		Sorry to keep reposting this, if no one can help this time I'll leave but I really could use some help *c*
2010-04-22T02:45:00.000Z	Taz		yeah, and I lifted up the Microphone volume itself
2010-04-22T02:46:00.000Z	Taz		but that didn't work
2010-04-22T02:46:00.000Z	Taz		I kept hearing about setting Capture to on but I have no idea how to do that, through the command line or otherwise
2010-04-22T02:47:00.000Z	msim	Taz	did you try sudo alsaconf
2010-04-22T02:47:00.000Z	msim		?
2010-04-22T02:48:00.000Z	Taz		I didn't
2010-04-22T02:48:00.000Z	Taz		I will try that now and see if it works, thanks
2010-04-22T02:49:00.000Z	msim		@nik__ you can use dd if=/... of=/... but beware dd can destroy lots :-)
2010-04-22T02:49:00.000Z	Taz		the alsaconf command isn't recognized by the terminal O:
2010-04-22T02:49:00.000Z	msim		sudo... :-)
2010-04-22T02:50:00.000Z	msim		Have also a question - anyone there with bonding knowhow? - I have 802.3ad but still 1 Link wire speed.
2010-04-22T02:50:00.000Z	Taz	msim	absolutely nothing, even with sudo O:
2010-04-22T02:52:00.000Z	msim		taz, try asoundconf
2010-04-22T02:52:00.000Z	msim		(http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/asoundconf)
2010-04-22T02:53:00.000Z	Taz		thank you, msim, i'll try this now, though I don't suppose theres an english version of this? ;w;
2010-04-22T02:53:00.000Z	msim		try google translate ;-)
2010-04-22T02:55:00.000Z	Taz	msim	it would seem asoundconf has been removed from Karmic
