2009-02-02T05:21:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	ALT-CTRL F1 or F2
2009-02-02T05:22:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	then use ALT-CTRL F7  or maybe F6 to get your gnome display again.
2009-02-02T05:23:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	we trying to fix your X resolution problems?
2009-02-02T05:23:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	 try running nautilus.  I would type nau[Tab]  Not sure of the spelling.
2009-02-02T05:24:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	do it from the xterm.  That way you remain in the x and can see the error messages at the same time.
2009-02-02T05:25:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	from the other terminal I todlyou to run. DISPLAY=0.0 xterm &  that should have launched a xterm on your X.
2009-02-02T05:26:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	That should be DISPLAY=:0.0
2009-02-02T05:32:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	there was an error in that line I gave you.
2009-02-02T05:32:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	it is suppose to be DISPLAY=:0.0  See the : ?
2009-02-02T05:33:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	did it still give you an error?
2009-02-02T05:37:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	I'm going to do a test.  brb.
2009-02-02T05:39:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	I'm trying to detrmine how to discover your X display number.
2009-02-02T05:40:00.000Z	CyBurnett	uncmar	Ok Ill try that.
2009-02-02T05:42:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	if you reinstall, simply delete or rename most all folders but your /home/
2009-02-02T05:43:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	/home/ stores most everything.  Then again. I am by far not a linux expert
2009-02-02T05:49:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	 you will have to reinstall VirtualBox, but otherwise, they should.
2009-02-02T05:49:00.000Z	CyBurnett	uncmar	Thank you for your time and patience :)
2009-02-02T05:50:00.000Z	uncmar	CyBurnett	you're welcome
