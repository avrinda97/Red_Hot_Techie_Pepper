2007-06-24T07:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		hi people, ive got a major problem, ubuntu now boots in text mode as detects my cofiguration for the X server to be wrong
2007-06-24T08:00:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	try going into recovery mode, and typing "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup"  then do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-06-24T08:06:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	I repeat, try going into recovery mode, and typing "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup"  then do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-06-24T08:07:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	it sounds like it is a your xorg.conf is messed up, the directions I gave you will help get it working again.
2007-06-24T08:10:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	if you don't want to use the command line, there aren't to many options
2007-06-24T08:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	you can write the directions down
2007-06-24T08:15:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	bobbob1016	but i cant implement them as I need to boot to ubuntu and I was told to do is download soemthing that allows me to paste what is in my xorg.conf and paste it in paste bin thats all
2007-06-24T08:17:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	this you don't have to download anything for.  It does require knowing what settings are safe though, like what card you have, and the resolution.  I'm looking for directions now.
2007-06-24T08:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	what type of video card do you have, ATI, Nvidia, or Intel?
2007-06-24T08:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	bobbob1016	thanx from windows XP I cna find my graphics card etc so yeah i'll wait, if it is of any help when I changed resoltuion to X i86 which I know is what caused the problem it create a backup of my original resolution settings I just dont know how to make it read that
2007-06-24T08:21:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	I was asking what card you have.  Waiting won't fix your ubuntu, if you have an Nvidia card, I have a video that will show you how to fix it.  If you are 100% sure there is a backup, you can fix this with two or three simple commands.
2007-06-24T08:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	bobbob1016	Im a 100% sure there is a backup somewheer and I dont use Nvidia on this comp it is all default hardware from the manufaturer
2007-06-24T08:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	bobbob1016	are you there? have you found it
2007-06-24T08:26:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	some default setups have nvidia cards.  If you are sure there is a backup, go into the text mode and type "cd /etc/X11/" then type "ls"  it will list all the files there.  If you see something like "xorg.conf-backup" or "-old" or "-(daymonthyear)" type "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-broken" then "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf-(backup or old or daymonthyear, whichever) /etc/X11/xorg.conf"  then
2007-06-24T08:28:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	the only reason I was asking if you had an nvidia card was that was what the I found was for
2007-06-24T08:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	bobbob1016	I will tyr that but I dont know that name of the actual backup but I'll try that, what was the second way you were thinking off?
2007-06-24T08:29:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	the backup should be listed when you type "ls" it will show a list of files, the backup should be obvious
2007-06-24T08:32:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Pirate_Hunter	the other way is similar, except you are making a new xorg.conf.  Here is the video that shows how to do it for an nvidia, you just have to change it where ever it shows something with nvidia to match your card.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QsP8GDTpno  that is using Mephis, but the actual setup process is the same, just not where it says Mephis.
