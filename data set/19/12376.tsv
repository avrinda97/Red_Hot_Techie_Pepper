2006-05-22T09:41:00.000Z	rob138		why should files not have spaces?
2006-05-22T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	because unless youre tabcompleting, you have to escape the spaces.
2006-05-22T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	tab completion escapes for you.  but I suppose you still have to escape them.
2006-05-22T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	no it's not.  in windows you have to put quotes around thigns with spaces.
2006-05-22T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	don't even have the option of escaping them.
2006-05-22T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	well, there are some characters you cant use.
2006-05-22T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	make sure the ram works with the motherboard.
2006-05-22T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	no.  And if theyre old, you might have a hard time finding a motherboard for them anyway.  But no, you cant mix those RAMs.
2006-05-22T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	yeah, just make sure your motherboard supports both IDE and SATA.  most do.
2006-05-22T10:01:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	building yourself isn't that hard (there are guides online) and definately the cheapest.
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	what card do you have?
2006-05-27T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	ATI? or NV? or somethign eles?
2006-05-27T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	hmm, its rather easy in nvidia, I dont see anything about ATI though.
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	well, NV can do it with the video card, to get it to work with ATI (or anything else) you might need to use RANDR (Resize and Rotate, basically a screen utility) to get it to work.
2006-05-27T10:55:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	RANDR should work for an entire X, I dont know what sorts of config you'll need though
2006-05-27T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	actually, I think it's completely impossible.  actually.
2006-05-27T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	maybe for breezy, but as of 10-10 last year, the proprietary ATI driver didnt support rotation.
2006-05-27T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	erm, maybe in dapper you'll be able to.  might have a newer fgrlx (or whatever it) is driver
2006-06-01T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rob138	at the bottom half of that, talks about it.
