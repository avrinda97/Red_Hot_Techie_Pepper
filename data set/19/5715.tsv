2008-05-13T03:41:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	includes a partitioner?
2008-05-13T03:42:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 I think Gparted will use ntfsprogs to play nicely with ntfs file systems
2008-05-13T03:42:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 I don't know if gparted uses the ntfs-3g stuff
2008-05-13T03:42:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	will give it a try
2008-05-13T03:43:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	not in the repositories
2008-05-13T03:43:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 They're in mine....
2008-05-13T03:44:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 ntfsprogs is in main
2008-05-13T03:46:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	found it, bit of a nublet, been installing programs through the console and as "apt-get install ntfsprogs" wasnt running I presumed the worse
2008-05-13T03:47:00.000Z	jbuncher_		ah
2008-05-13T03:47:00.000Z	howapt		lol
2008-05-13T03:49:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	no change, still the keyrings
2008-05-13T03:50:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 unmount it
2008-05-13T03:50:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	genius
2008-05-13T03:51:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	well, thanks, I mean lol
2008-05-13T03:51:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 no problem
2008-05-13T03:51:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	if I can pick your brain one last time, how will I go about increasing the linux partition, surely unmounting linux will kill my session? (I say surely, I know nothing)
2008-05-13T03:53:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 As long as there is space available to the right of the partition (in the little picture in gparted), you can grow an ext3 partition.  You do need to unmount the file system though.  You can do this (for example) running from a live cd.  Just install gparted.
2008-05-13T03:53:00.000Z	howapt	jbuncher_	ok, thanks again
2008-05-13T03:53:00.000Z	jbuncher_	howapt	 no problem
