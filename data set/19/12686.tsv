2005-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	is it normal that it makes so much trouble?
2005-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	pho	i dont understand your question
2005-07-22T14:26:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	the problem is that when i install something by using the ubunut servers...mostly it doesnt connect to security.ubuntu.com server...
2005-07-22T14:26:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	this is really bullshit
2005-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	pho	what is?
2005-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	there is this installation programm for adding new software... it partly cant connect to the servers for downloading the packages
2005-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	pho	it maybe that the server is down
2005-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	i thought so... but this is crap!
2005-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	but much severe is that my internet connection sucks after rebooting the system... that means i have to reinstall the whole ubuntu to open webpages and use messengers and stuff...
2005-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	pho	this isnt windows
2005-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	i know :)
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	pho	hybrid_goth	so.. it have to work far better...
