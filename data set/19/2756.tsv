2011-12-18T01:40:00.000Z	n4dsp		Hello
2011-12-18T01:41:00.000Z	n4dsp		do i do that?
2011-12-18T01:43:00.000Z	n4dsp		I installed Thunderbird after having problems with evolution and now I want to uninstall Evolution totally and permanetly. I also want the top right menu bar that has the mail icon and all to disappear. How do i do that?
2011-12-18T01:43:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	First, uninstall Evolution via Software Center.
2011-12-18T01:44:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Then logout/login back and if icon is still there we will do something terrible to it. ;)
2011-12-18T01:49:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Yes?
2011-12-18T01:49:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Does it say 'Evolution'?
2011-12-18T01:50:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Simply, 'Mail'?
2011-12-18T01:50:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Or, does simply looks like a letter?
2011-12-18T01:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Select it as a default mail application and it will open it instead.
2011-12-18T01:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	It is the normal behavior for the messaging menu.
2011-12-18T01:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	But you want to kill it nevertheless? Why?
2011-12-18T01:53:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Uhmm. Does it say 'Set Up Mailâ€¦"?
2011-12-18T01:54:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Okay.
2011-12-18T01:54:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Take a look at this manual, it is pretty straightforward. http://lifehacker.com/5703681/remove-unwanted-entries-from-ubuntus-messaging-menu
2011-12-18T01:54:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	And if it still does not launch Thunderbird, try this. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/messaging-menu-integration/
2011-12-18T01:55:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	For your interest, these links can be found by simply googling. :)
2011-12-18T01:56:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	And chances of someone doing your googling for you on any support channel are lower than average, so you might want to try it out yourself. :)
2011-12-18T01:56:00.000Z	paulsomebody	n4dsp	Yes, the second link it is then.
