2012-01-12T00:32:00.000Z	Resistance		can i burn a livecd image to a USB stick from Windows?  my linux machine is explodified so i need to fix that from a livecd
2012-01-12T00:32:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	try unetbootin
2012-01-12T00:42:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	any way to do it without installing unetbootin?  kinda limited to non-admin access here atm
2012-01-12T00:44:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	as far as I remember you don't have to install it
2012-01-12T00:44:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	alrighty, i'll try that, i'll be back if it doesnt work :P
2012-01-12T00:44:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	yeah :)
2012-01-12T00:45:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	you can reset your windows password if it limits you :D
2012-01-12T00:45:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	cant do that either, but not a bad idea xD
2012-01-12T02:09:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	unetbootin requires admin privs to run on Windows
2012-01-12T02:10:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	then why don't you reset admin password? :)
2012-01-12T02:11:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	or you can burn a live cd and do it from there
2012-01-12T02:11:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	i cant, i dont own the system :p
2012-01-12T02:11:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	wish i had extra CDs or DVDs
2012-01-12T02:11:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	irrelevant now, i found my 10.04 LiveUSB
2012-01-12T02:11:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	:D
2012-01-12T02:14:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	but there are ways to do it without right
2012-01-12T02:15:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	lemme make this clear: i dont own the system so i dont have legal rights to screw with the settings and passcodes
2012-01-12T02:15:00.000Z	Resistance	Neosano	so drop the notion that I can, and leave it be
2012-01-12T02:15:00.000Z	Neosano	Resistance	okay, sorry :D
