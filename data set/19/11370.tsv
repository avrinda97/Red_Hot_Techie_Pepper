2006-06-13T10:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo		argh - 1 big partition is a pain
2006-06-13T10:15:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	for new users, it is fine. More advanced users can set up a partition scheme they are happy with
2006-06-13T10:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	until this new user needs to reinstall & clobbers their /home - methinks separate partition for /home should be mandatory
2006-06-13T10:16:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	and backups should be mandatory
2006-06-13T10:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	well aren't they? ;)
2006-06-13T10:17:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	we give you the rope, if you choose to hang yourself, so be it
2006-06-13T10:17:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	nope. well, not outside of business, and even then it's dodgy
2006-06-13T10:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	 and it's a crime - there's a class action against pc makers coming down the pike
2006-06-13T10:19:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	from yanks unwilling to take responsibility for the actions (or lack of as the case may be) ?
2006-06-13T10:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	no - from ill informed businesses ruined when their hd clags
2006-06-13T10:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	there really ought to be warning labels on pcs that hard drives cannot be relied on
2006-06-13T10:20:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	suing people because you choose not to pay attention to maintaining your tools should be tossed out of court
2006-06-13T10:21:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	there where (at least when I used to sell them)
2006-06-13T10:21:00.000Z	Yagisan		s/where/were
2006-06-13T10:21:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	the problem is pc sellers sell the pcs to people who have very little technical knowledge & regard the pc as just another whitegood
2006-06-13T10:22:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	that is a problem, as it isn't a "whitegood".
2006-06-13T10:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Yagisan	bingo
2006-06-13T10:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo		anyways, gotta head - night all
2006-06-13T10:22:00.000Z	Yagisan	Frogzoo	night
