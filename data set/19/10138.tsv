2006-07-27T14:47:00.000Z	Asc	move	never used it
2006-07-27T14:47:00.000Z	move	Asc	it's the only irc client I've ever used in linux, it was all the rage 8 years ago
2006-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	Asc	move	I usually just usr irc from the console
2006-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	move	Asc	it is console based
2006-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	Asc	move	but I use the console whenever possible because it's awesome with io
2006-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	Asc	move	good man
2006-07-27T14:51:00.000Z	Asc	move	screenshots OTW.  They don't really convey what's best about it though.
2006-07-27T14:53:00.000Z	move	Asc	i see. very minimalistic
2006-07-27T14:53:00.000Z	Asc	move	What's great about ion3 is that you learn to run everything without using menus (read: fast)... and you can switch between workspaces very quickly and there aren't overlapped windows
2006-07-27T14:54:00.000Z	move	Asc	it sounds nice, but I have a tendency to do 50-60 things at a time, and I need layers upon layers of desktop space
2006-07-27T14:54:00.000Z	Asc	move	*peer* what kind of things?
2006-07-27T14:56:00.000Z	move	Asc	running irc in console isn't speed for me, it's downtime. I don't start messing with things and multitasking like crazy
