2011-12-08T08:34:00.000Z	barby		hi to all
2011-12-08T08:35:00.000Z	barby		I need to add another path into the variable $PATH permanently
2011-12-08T08:36:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	barby	you can append it in one of your .files
2011-12-08T08:36:00.000Z	barby		mmmm
2011-12-08T08:36:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		like .bashrc or .bash_profile if you want it globally you can put it /etc/profile
2011-12-08T08:36:00.000Z	barby		ok
2011-12-08T08:38:00.000Z	barby		i need it for root
2011-12-08T08:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		you can put in the respecitve users home.. roots would be /.profile than i guess =)
2011-12-08T08:38:00.000Z	barby		my .bashrc
2011-12-08T08:38:00.000Z	barby		call "cat /etc/debian_chroot"
2011-12-08T08:38:00.000Z	barby		but this file is empty
2011-12-08T08:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	barby	?
2011-12-08T08:39:00.000Z	barby		.profile calls ~/.bashrc
2011-12-08T08:40:00.000Z	barby		.bashrc calls /etc/debian_chroot, and it's empty
2011-12-08T08:41:00.000Z	barby		I can not understand where is set :(
2011-12-08T08:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	barby	your looking to append so simply PATH=$PATH:/new/path is sufficient... i dont think it matters where its initially defined no?
2011-12-08T08:45:00.000Z	barby	SolarisBoy	yes with the export works, but if I go out and return the change is lost
2011-12-08T08:45:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	barby	as stated put it in the file.
2011-12-08T08:46:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	barby	whichever file you choose export it as that and that will make it persist, as stated ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc for you,, /etc/profile for all
