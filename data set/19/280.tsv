2012-09-28T22:46:00.000Z	julius_		how do you start a gnome-terminal from the 12.04.1 installer?
2012-09-28T22:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	ctrl-alt-t
2012-09-28T22:47:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	doest work
2012-09-28T22:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	This a live cd or the alternate?
2012-09-28T22:48:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	live cd i guess....you can choose to install or run live
2012-09-28T22:48:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	its the default download you get on the ubuntu site
2012-09-28T22:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	use the dash hit the top button in the left panel or hit the super key to open it and type terminal
2012-09-28T22:50:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	the dash?   if you mean the unity starter - it doesnt pop up
2012-09-28T22:50:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	also the windows keys do nothing
2012-09-28T22:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	Do you see a panel on the left of the desktop?
2012-09-28T22:51:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	no
2012-09-28T22:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	Then tell us exactly where you are.
2012-09-28T22:52:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	i will have to use the text termianl then....thought that this would be more user friendly
2012-09-28T22:52:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	just started the installer cd, i did choose the language
2012-09-28T22:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	Is the live cd not booting to the desktop?
2012-09-28T22:53:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	it looks like a ubuntu desktop but the unity launcher for example wont appear and pressing alt+tabs shows one application with the gnome termimal icon called "installer"
2012-09-28T22:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	julius_	You have to boot to the desktop not the instal to have these functions.
2012-09-28T22:54:00.000Z	julius_	wilee-nilee	ok thx
