2006-11-10T12:12:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-11-10T12:37:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 don't do /list
2006-11-10T13:13:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 you have multiple drives? or multiple partitions?
2006-11-10T13:14:00.000Z	Mantice	wastrel	one IDE which ubuntu boots off and I have 2 other "sata" hdd's
2006-11-10T13:15:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 i dunno from sata
2006-11-10T13:16:00.000Z	Mantice	wastrel	It use to work on the old distro's but now it dont :(
2006-11-10T13:16:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 do you know the drive numbers?
2006-11-10T13:17:00.000Z	Mantice	wastrel	I have them mounted in linux how do I get their names ?
2006-11-10T13:17:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 df
2006-11-10T13:19:00.000Z	Mantice	wastrel	/dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1
2006-11-10T13:20:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 ok halfway there
2006-11-10T13:20:00.000Z	Mantice	wastrel	by the way my hard drive is on sda1
2006-11-10T13:21:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 well i don't play around with grub too much so I always forget how to do the drive numbers.
2006-11-10T13:23:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 so sda1 would be (hd0,0)  and sdb1 would be (hd1,0)  i think.  what do you have in there for your linux drive?
2006-11-10T13:23:00.000Z	Mantice	wastrel	but my IDE HD is hd0
2006-11-10T13:24:00.000Z	wastrel	Mantice	 ah true, well i think you need to ask google :]   i just have IDE.  ...  or experiment, you'll reboot a lot but as long as you've got your linux booting it's easy to fix...
