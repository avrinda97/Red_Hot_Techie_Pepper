2010-05-30T15:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		gdm by default uses the /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png   it seems
2010-05-30T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Hmm. Adobe Air is a little special in how it installed i recall. it was sort of weird
2010-05-30T15:40:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	can I override it somehow?
2010-05-30T15:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 ive not had any issues with it. Most air programs use the air installer/uninstaller.
2010-05-30T15:41:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	grooveshark does too, but still this happens
2010-05-30T15:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 ive only used one AIR app. :) and ive never really tried to Uninstall it.
2010-07-03T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 compiz has so many features.. and so few docs about those features. :)
2010-07-03T21:57:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	something similar for KDE/Kwin?
2010-07-03T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 no idea. try #kubuntu
2010-07-03T22:01:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	if you move the window to one corner, and maximize, it will be resized to fit in that corner, within a given region
2010-07-03T22:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 kde has that to some degree. :) 1/2 size if the screen ive seen
2010-07-03T22:04:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	yes, but self controlled regions would be the ideal thing :)
2010-07-03T22:04:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	I have too many windows and maximizing everything confuses me
2010-07-03T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 sounds like you need to get organized. :)
2010-07-03T22:05:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	haha yea
2011-05-27T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 guake,  and a dozen other viarants.
2011-05-27T19:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 whatever one we feel like. :) depends on your needs and tasted
2011-05-27T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oal	 dont confuse xchat with xchat-gnome  they are very differnt
2011-05-27T19:11:00.000Z	oal	Dr_Willis	ah, ok
