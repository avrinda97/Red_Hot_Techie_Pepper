2009-08-13T05:13:00.000Z	nohup		good evening, all
2009-08-13T05:14:00.000Z	nohup		i remember awhile ago ubuntu 9.04 on the aspire one (acer) had quite a few problems with sluggish compiz..... i guess there have been updates since... so i was wondering: would it be 'safe' to upgrade to it now?
2009-08-13T05:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 i used the UNR release on my AAO. and foloowed a few tweaks in the UNR/AAO forum/thread  and its working great.
2009-08-13T05:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 there still might be an issue with it not seeing both SD slots unless  ya got a card  in each  slot at bootup. but i rarely use those.
2009-08-13T05:16:00.000Z	nohup	Dr_Willis	i hope this doesn't sound all to stupid, but i've never heard of UNR :)
2009-08-13T05:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 and I do recall upgrading the intel video.
2009-08-13T05:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 Ubuntu Netboot REmix -  a usb variant  with tweaks for the netbooks.
2009-08-13T05:16:00.000Z	nohup	Dr_Willis	i don't care about the sd cards.. never used them :)
2009-08-13T05:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 Im not sure if i upgraded the intel video or not.. wasent too hard to do. - i had to do it on my other laptop  to get compiz working.
2009-08-13T05:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 try it and see i guess..  Or just go get the UNR img file, and dd it to a flash drive and test drive it.
2009-08-13T05:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 thats whats unique about UNR. its an 'img' file you just 'dd' to a flash drive.. and  boot it. :)
2009-08-13T05:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 i hate the special UNR 'interface' i alwyas enable the normal gnome desktop
2009-08-13T05:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 seen 2gb on sale for $5 over the weekend. :P

2009-08-13T05:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 works good as a rescue tool also. got ones for several different disrtos/repair/recovery disrtos.
2009-11-02T23:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	 of course it is.
2009-11-02T23:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nohup	if you did a upgrade. try a clean install of 9.10 se eif it works better
