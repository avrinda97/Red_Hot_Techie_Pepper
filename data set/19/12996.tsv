2005-11-16T17:29:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	there'a a problem with running md5sum on the /dev/cdrom device...  even with a good burn it doesn't work, 'cos /dev/cdrom has a bunch of extra NUL characters tagged on the end
2005-11-16T17:31:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	press enter to exit, and type the "md5sums ubuntu-5-10-..." thing at the windows command prompt
2005-11-16T17:32:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	I don't think we care too much about the format of the output - let's just have him run it...
2006-01-25T08:59:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	what are you talking about?  "oct ascii"?
2006-01-25T09:00:00.000Z	poningru	dooglus	http://www.lookuptables.com/
2006-01-25T09:01:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	"man ascii" will show something similar
2006-01-25T09:02:00.000Z	poningru	dooglus	hmm ok
2006-01-25T09:02:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	I don't know what you mean by "hex is ctrl+shift+hex"
2006-01-25T09:02:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	maybe if I understood the question...
2006-01-25T09:03:00.000Z	poningru	dooglus	with the cursor somewhere
2006-01-25T09:05:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	oh, that's cool.  i never saw that before
2006-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	I wouldn't have thought there was an 'octal' mode for entering characters.  hex is enough, right?
2007-04-22T09:46:00.000Z	poningru	dooglus	what are you trying to do?
2007-04-22T09:46:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	I'm trying to tell Krige^ that ubuntu's default firewall configuration is 'everything allowed' and that he shouldn't need to add any special rules to get filesharing working.
2007-04-22T09:47:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	in fact I have managed to tell him that a couple of times, but he won't believe me.
2007-04-22T09:47:00.000Z	dooglus	poningru	maybe you could tell him too?  :)
2007-04-22T09:47:00.000Z	poningru	dooglus	Krige^ thats for outgoing not for incoming
2007-04-22T09:47:00.000Z	poningru	dooglus	Krige^ well the firewall there is none, just no programs that do incoming i.e no servers
