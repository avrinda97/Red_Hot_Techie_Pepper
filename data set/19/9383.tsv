2007-02-02T08:52:00.000Z	dromer		hi all, I had a dual-boot with XP and just reinstalled, now I lost grub. I remember something about restoring grub with the live-cd. how can I do this?
2007-02-02T08:53:00.000Z	variant	dromer	in the live cd open a terminal and type grub, you will get a grub shell
2007-02-02T08:53:00.000Z	variant	dromer	do it as root*
2007-02-02T08:53:00.000Z	dromer	variant	ok
2007-02-02T08:53:00.000Z	dromer	variant	thnx :)
2007-02-02T08:53:00.000Z	variant	dromer	where is your primary boot partition?
2007-02-02T08:54:00.000Z	variant	dromer	do you have more than one disk? what parttion is ubuntu installed on?
2007-02-02T08:55:00.000Z	variant	dromer	in the grub shellt type "root (hd0,0) to install grub on the mbr of the first hard disk, then do:
2007-02-02T08:55:00.000Z	variant	dromer	setup (hd0) if you have installed ubuntu to the first partiition of hte first disk
2007-02-02T08:57:00.000Z	dromer	variant	have to boot into the live-cd first ;)
2007-02-02T08:58:00.000Z	variant	dromer	ok, take note of the instructions and enter them. i am off :) later
2007-02-02T08:58:00.000Z	dromer	variant	that's all I need? many thnx :)
2007-02-02T08:58:00.000Z	variant	dromer	indeed
2007-02-02T08:59:00.000Z	variant	dromer	remember that /dev/hda1 is (hd0,0) in grub
2007-05-03T09:48:00.000Z	variant	dromer	that is not the reccomended way to run wine
2007-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	variant	dromer	as it won't set up files and paths correctly for some programs
2007-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	variant	dromer	either run it from the application directory or run it with a windows path like this wine C:\\path\\to\\prog.exe
2007-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	dromer	variant	ok, sorry, I'm not too experienced with wine, you explain it to aeonix ;)
2007-05-15T13:38:00.000Z	variant	dromer	ask whoever made it
