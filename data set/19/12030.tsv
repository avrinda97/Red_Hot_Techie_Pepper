(Pentium I to Pentium III maybe some 486 :-)) I think ubuntu should have a variant that is light and runs on these old PCs and support old hardware (The latest ubuntu variant is too heavy for old hardware) This is not only true for the Philiippines but other 3rd world counties as well (Check out the CNET news people from europe and the U.S.A are shipping
2005-10-21T06:35:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie		their old PC to 3rd world)
2005-10-21T06:36:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie		If ubuntu does this it will be very very popular in 3rd world countries most of the LINUX distros runs so sloooooowwww in old systems
2005-10-21T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	Try 'xubuntu', it uses xfce instead of Gnome.
2005-10-21T06:39:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	cafuego_	So this xbuntu thing still has a GUI but is much later than the latest distrubution ? (In our office alone we have 10 pcs that range from Pentium I to Pentium III the fastest being only 500 mhz)
2005-10-21T06:39:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	The base system is identical, it just runs xfce, which is ligher than Gnome.
2005-10-21T06:40:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	Still, hoary hedgehog (Ubuntu 5.04) works fine too.
2005-10-21T06:42:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	cafuego_	i installed hoary hedgehog (Not tried xubuntu though) on a pentium celeron 400 mhz yesterday. Works fine but user complained that it's much slower than win 98 (Maybe she is sitll not used to it) we were forced to change because of the government raids. Also did not detect an old CNET lan card. but so far it detected other other hardware whcih is good. I'm trying to find support for an LX 300 EPSON printer.
2005-10-21T06:43:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	yes, but that's not surprising. Win98 is _VERY_ old and _VERY_ crusty. It's not really a fair comparison. If you compare it tin win2k instead of win98, suddenly it's much more favourable.
2005-10-21T06:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	So, are microsoft paying the government for this?
2005-10-21T06:45:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	cafuego_	I agree maybe the user misses her old system where she is used to doing stuff. However she has not choose we have to switch
2005-10-21T06:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	Yes, those facists have an office here too.
2005-10-21T06:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	Anyway, not using Gnome will speed the desktop experience up a bit. Also sue abiword instead of openoffice, that sort of thing. I'm not sure about old network adapters... you should perhaps be able to pick up a few second hand realtek ones.
2005-10-21T06:56:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	Yes, we had a floor of phillipinos on the channel as well over the past month. I was wondering why thatw as, now I know .. :-) There *is* a tagalog channel as well, I think. #ubuntu-ph
2005-10-21T06:57:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	Ask why the government only threatened, as opposed to handing out copies of Linux and OpenOffice.org
2005-11-05T16:13:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	If you hink that makes you write better code, sure. I'd personally suggest picking a real langauage <heh>
2005-11-05T16:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	5.04 is Hoary.
2005-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	'man useradd'
2005-11-05T16:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	ubuntunewbie	See item #2 in the /topic :-)
