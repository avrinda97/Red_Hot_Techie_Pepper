2010-04-09T03:14:00.000Z	pranay_09		since by using sudo -i one becomes the root user so any user having an acc on the system can have root access?
2010-04-09T03:14:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	only users that are in the sudo group
2010-04-09T03:15:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	either in the sudo'ers file or within a group that is given the permission
2010-04-09T03:16:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	run this from the terminal `sudo visudo`
2010-04-09T03:20:00.000Z	pranay_09	subone	thanks , got it but i can't find my username there , is it that i am in a group?
2010-04-09T03:21:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	could be, try: Sys>Admin>Users/Groups
2010-04-09T03:22:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	select your user from the list and click manage groups
2010-04-09T03:22:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	note that any user that is allowed sudo priveledges is in the "admin" group
2010-04-09T03:23:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	but you can also add such admin priveledges and limit them to certain applications or paths in the /etc/sudoers file
2010-04-09T03:25:00.000Z	pranay_09	subone	ok, what's the diff between root and admin? is it to do only with diff in some permissions with admin having more?L
2010-04-09T03:26:00.000Z	pranay_09	subone	but i can find two separate group names for root and admin in group settings
2010-04-09T03:26:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	oh do you mean the 'root' group? the 'root' group is only used by the 'root' user
2010-04-09T03:26:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	there should be a pranay_09 group too, of which only you are a part of
2010-04-09T03:27:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	the admin group is what you want, only the actual root account should be given the root group afaik
2010-04-09T03:27:00.000Z	pranay_09	subone	ya it does exits
2010-04-09T03:29:00.000Z	pranay_09	subone	: ok , so adding users to this 'admin' group will allow them to do sudo -i , right?
2010-04-09T03:30:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	yes it should, be careful you dont remove everyone from the admin group though or you may lose your admin ability completely :p
2010-04-09T03:32:00.000Z	pranay_09	subone	ok , thanks a lot buddy you cleared lots of doubts :)
2010-04-09T03:33:00.000Z	subone	pranay_09	np
