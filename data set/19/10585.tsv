2008-07-23T18:27:00.000Z	Pelo		morning folks
2008-07-23T18:29:00.000Z	Pelo		working on my neibourg's computer , setup two account one for the mother one for the daughter,  daughter has no admin access , this is not so good as she's the most likely to play with the comp but mom wants more control,  is there a way to give the daughter access to install/remove apps , without giving her other admin priviledges ?
2008-07-23T18:29:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	not really.. installing programs need admin rights
2008-07-23T18:30:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	why give control to the person who is most inexperienced?
2008-07-23T18:31:00.000Z	Pelo	notwist	14 yr old daughter who got caught displaying herself on a porn site 2 years ago ,  mom wants control mom gets control , no mather wath
2008-07-23T18:32:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	um.. not giving her admin rights isn't going to stop her from displaying herself in a webcam.
2008-07-23T18:32:00.000Z	Pelo	notwist	the idea would be to give the daughter access to install games and app but not to access mom's account and to keep mom on top of things if mom needs to cut daughter off the internet
2008-07-23T18:33:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	she can cut her daughter off the internet even if her daughter is admin
2008-07-23T18:34:00.000Z	Pelo	notwist	but the daughter is wise and if she is admin she can figure out how to get internet back
2008-07-23T18:34:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	her mother could just delete her user. simple as that
2008-07-23T18:34:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	then she doesnt have access to the computer at all
2008-07-23T18:34:00.000Z	Pelo	notwist	homework ?
2008-07-23T18:35:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	I don't see how you think this is going to work. If she has access to the computer physically she CAN access the internet if shes "wise" as you say
2008-07-23T18:36:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	If she needs homework done she could write it on a goddamn paper or use her mothers account under her supervision. The problem isn't how to configure linux, the problem is how this child needs to be raised
2008-07-23T18:36:00.000Z	Pelo	notwist	we'Re getting off track I think
2008-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	what im trying to say is that there is NO way you can config the computer to let her use it to do homework or whatever and be sure she cant access the internet. Physical access means easy hack
2008-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	especially not if you want it to be flexible like she can have internet one week and one not
2008-07-23T18:39:00.000Z	Pelo	notwist	currently the daughter only has basic "user" access, with the mother as the admin,  I just wanted to see if there was a simple way to give the daughter a bit more rope so she can install games and apps herself without having to have her mother log into her account every 10 mintues to do it
2008-07-23T18:40:00.000Z	notwist	Pelo	what im trying to say is, what is stopping her right now from using the internet in a way that her mother doesnt want?
