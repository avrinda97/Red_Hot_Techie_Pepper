2011-08-12T23:06:00.000Z	pr0ton		hey guys i had question about ssh
2011-08-12T23:06:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	post question
2011-08-12T23:06:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	it would probably work over 56k, why do you ask
2011-08-12T23:07:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	so a 768kbps connection?
2011-08-12T23:08:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	what part of your ssh is slow?
2011-08-12T23:08:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	connecting, typing commands, or what
2011-08-12T23:08:00.000Z	pr0ton	thunsucker	when i'm editing files or typing commands, there is a lag
2011-08-12T23:08:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	are you inside a vbox VM that connections thru SSH to a remote machine?
2011-08-12T23:09:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	okay better question, what machine are you sshing from,your local machine or a vm?
2011-08-12T23:09:00.000Z	pr0ton	thunsucker	local machine
2011-08-12T23:10:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	sounds like a connection problem, what type of internet does the remote side have?
2011-08-12T23:10:00.000Z	pr0ton	thunsucker	it's webfaction... my ISP
2011-08-12T23:11:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	what ssh client are you using, terminal?
2011-08-12T23:11:00.000Z	pr0ton	thunsucker	yeah, terminal
2011-08-12T23:12:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	wait the remote side is a hosted server? like web hosting or something similar?
2011-08-12T23:12:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	sounds like they might be throttling your bandwidth, edit the files locally and then upload, problem goes away with that method
2011-08-12T23:12:00.000Z	pr0ton	thunsucker	that may not be a productive option soon :(
2011-08-12T23:13:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	it's the only option i have with my website, ftp access. i edit locally and then tell filezilla to sync
2011-08-12T23:14:00.000Z	thunsucker	pr0ton	call your isp to see if they are throttling your bandwidth or if qos is killing it
