2008-11-06T23:03:00.000Z	tallyn		I'm having an issue booting directly off of the Live CD for ubuntu 8.10. What is the best channel to get help?
2008-11-06T23:05:00.000Z	genii	tallyn	Here is the place. Any errors or symptons it is giving may be helpful in diagnosis
2008-11-06T23:07:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	I get a lot of errors when I try to run it
2008-11-06T23:07:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	They all look similar to this one: [112.143392] end_request: I/O error, dev sr1, sector 36856
2008-11-06T23:08:00.000Z	genii	tallyn	Did you check the CD when you burned it to make sure the MD5 checksum was correct? It may be a bad image or burn
2008-11-06T23:09:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	what's the best way to check the checksum?
2008-11-06T23:11:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	you still there?
2008-11-06T23:28:00.000Z	tallyn		I can't boot from the Live CD for 8.10, and my CD checks out!!! I'm very frustrated and confused!
2008-11-06T23:29:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	are you still there?
2008-11-06T23:30:00.000Z	genii	tallyn	Yes, but fairly busy. Did you find how to check the MD5 sums of the cd image you downloaded or burned to make sure it was not corrupt?
2008-11-06T23:30:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	I ran the CD's self-check and that ran fine
2008-11-06T23:33:00.000Z	genii	tallyn	Is this some Asus p5k   type motherboard?
2008-11-06T23:34:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	actually I'm running an iMac7,1
2008-11-06T23:35:00.000Z	genii	tallyn	You might find more Mac-specific help in #ubuntu-powerpc   The mac versions are not officially supported in this channel
2008-11-06T23:36:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	but I'm not running powerpc
2008-11-06T23:36:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	also no one is in that channel
2008-11-06T23:38:00.000Z	genii	tallyn	Thats just the channel name. Many there are running various mac platforms and are helpful with things like EFI booting, etc
2008-11-06T23:38:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	but there's no one there now
2008-11-06T23:39:00.000Z	tallyn	genii	n/m that was weird, they are there now
