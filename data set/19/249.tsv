2012-06-03T04:18:00.000Z	koud		hello I  need some help with virt-manager, seems I have found a bug with it
2012-06-03T04:19:00.000Z	koud		when I try and create a new virtual machine it says "Error: list.remove(x): x not in list"
2012-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	koud		seems I have managed to get it in some kind of deadlock with that error
2012-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	koud		how can I clear virt-manager settings??
2012-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	koud		i tried deleting .virt-manager but seems that is not where it stores preferences
2012-06-03T04:21:00.000Z	koud		I tried apt-get purge virt-manager but also no luck :(
2012-06-03T04:22:00.000Z	koud		oh
2012-06-03T04:22:00.000Z	koud		wrong network
2012-06-03T04:23:00.000Z	nulldev	koud	you delete anything in the same session?
2012-06-03T04:27:00.000Z	koud	nulldev	well I dont know what you mean by sesson. but earlier i deleted some stuff yes. I deleted connections and virtual machines to my server. then I reinstalled my server
2012-06-03T04:27:00.000Z	koud	nulldev	but I get this error even if I am not connected to any server
2012-06-03T04:29:00.000Z	nulldev	koud	I was just thinking something had crashed in the instance of virt-manager (not something Ive used) and that it was trying to delete it from a srting list stored in ram thats now pointing to non existant files/dirs
2012-06-03T04:30:00.000Z	koud	nulldev	good idea, maybe I should try reboot
2012-06-03T04:31:00.000Z	koud	nulldev	ah you where right
2012-06-03T04:31:00.000Z	koud		:))
2012-06-03T04:31:00.000Z	nulldev	koud	a reboot would rule out any zombies
2012-06-03T04:31:00.000Z	koud		now it works
2012-06-03T04:31:00.000Z	koud		just restart the program worked
2012-06-03T04:31:00.000Z	nulldev	koud	cool :)
