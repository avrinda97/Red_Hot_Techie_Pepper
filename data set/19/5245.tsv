2008-08-06T01:43:00.000Z	histo		Anyone have a clue how to do this. I have a numerous folders inside of ~/Music all containing mp3's i've copied from my ntfs drive.  Well the permissions are all borked for the mp3 files .  Is there a way to chmod them all back to nomral?
2008-08-06T01:43:00.000Z	histo		Some of the folders contain other folders
2008-08-06T01:44:00.000Z	thinkgnu	histo	chmod -R
2008-08-06T01:44:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	I get an error when I try chmod -R *.mp3
2008-08-06T01:44:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	sry chmod -R 644 *.mp3
2008-08-06T01:44:00.000Z	thinkgnu	histo	chmod -R 644 ./Music
2008-08-06T01:45:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	it gives an error about no such file or directory when trying that.
2008-08-06T01:45:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	of what?
2008-08-06T01:46:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	There are no mp3's in ~/Music they are all sorted like this ex: ~/Music/Artist/Album/whatever.mp3
2008-08-06T01:47:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	and i'm in ~/Music issuing the following command chmod -R 644 *.mp3  and it says that it can't find `*.mp3'
2008-08-06T01:47:00.000Z	thinkgnu	histo	goro Music folder and run this command chmod -R 644 Artist/
2008-08-06T01:48:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	I don't want to change the artist folder to 644
2008-08-06T01:48:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	it should be 755 no?
2008-08-06T01:49:00.000Z	thinkgnu	histo	goto music folder and then run this >> chmod 644 -R artist/  *.mp3
2008-08-06T01:50:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	heres an example in side of music is "drwxr-xr-x 3 histo histo 4096 2007-01-07 10:29 Weird Al Yankovic" And inside of that is "drwxr-xr-x 2 histo histo 4096 2007-01-07 10:29 Straight Outta Lynwood" containing the files "-rwxr-xr-x 1 histo histo 4087101 2006-12-25 18:48 01 - White and Nerdy.mp3"
2008-08-06T01:50:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	as you can see the directories are fine its mp3 that is messed up
2008-08-06T01:51:00.000Z	thinkgnu	histo	i don't know !
2008-08-06T01:52:00.000Z	thinkgnu	histo	give the output of this command > chmod 644 -R artist/  *.mp3
2008-08-06T01:52:00.000Z	histo	thinkgnu	that would only change one artists mp3's I have many i'm trying to do them all at once.
