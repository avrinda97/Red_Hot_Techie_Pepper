2011-02-22T19:06:00.000Z	theos		why do i get bash: ./configure: Permission denied when i use ./configure ?? i tried chmod +x too but doesnt work even as root :(
2011-02-22T19:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	what filesystem?
2011-02-22T19:07:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	filesystem is fat32
2011-02-22T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	probably is mounted noexec
2011-02-22T19:09:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	can you tell me how to mount it without noexec? or check if its mounted with that?
2011-02-22T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	check the apropiate line in « cat /proc/mounts  » output
2011-02-22T19:11:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	yes you were right. it has noexec. how to remove that? fstab?
2011-02-22T19:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	do not think so; probably it was mounted via udisks or something like that. try « sudo mount -o remount,exec  /mount/point/ » but i do not see the point of all this; just copy the sources to your home
2011-02-22T19:15:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	any idea what should be the umask for file and directory permisions in octal? so that i can exec on that partition?
2011-02-22T19:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	noexec has nothing to do with permissions. if a partition is noexec you can not execute anything in it no matter the permissions
2011-02-22T19:22:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	thanks a lot :)i now know the problem atleast
2011-02-22T19:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	no problem

2011-02-23T20:25:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	hi! i tried the way you suggested to convert m4b to ogg. but it didnt work for me. any other ways?
2011-04-21T16:50:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	mine too
2011-04-21T16:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	maybe reading my comments and tuhins helps you get some usefull info about what is happening
2011-04-21T16:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	theos	beggining with --> "cat /proc/cpuinfo" and "sudo cpufreq-info"  output may be of help
2011-04-21T16:55:00.000Z	theos	erUSUL	yeah i am trying that. i needed to get my subwoofer working :/ well lets do the cpu thingy :)
