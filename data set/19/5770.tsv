2008-05-03T13:32:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		is anyone else having problems with hardy playing videos? other than flash based?
2008-05-03T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 not really.
2008-05-03T14:00:00.000Z	DrinkBeer	Dr_willis	- any ideas on how to get streming mpeg or avis to play let alone ones that are already on the filesystem?
2008-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	  gmplayer and vlc can play most streams here. I guessit depends on whats doing the streaming.
2008-05-03T14:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 that sounds more like a video card/driver issue
2008-05-03T14:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 my x200m playes about anything i toss at it. using the ati, driver. fglrx works on it also now.
2008-05-03T14:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 very weird.  run the players from a terminal, look for error messages
2008-05-03T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 flash has nothing to do with the other video  players. :)
2008-05-03T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 that so sounds like a codec issue .
2008-05-03T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	DrinkBeer	 tried gmplayer yet?  compile a list of what players do what. i guess
