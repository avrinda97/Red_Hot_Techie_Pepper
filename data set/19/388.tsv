2012-04-14T04:39:00.000Z	marcm		I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 and I am trying to update it, but the sources list don't work
2012-04-14T04:41:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	did you check the source lists? are they set correctly?
2012-04-14T04:42:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	yep, they are set correctly. I get stuff like this: W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/InRelease
2012-04-14T04:44:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	did you set them manually? or did you change nothing at all?
2012-04-14T04:45:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	I did set them manually after they didn't work out of the box. Still nothing
2012-04-14T04:45:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/  try this. just select in the top section which repositories you wanna use. worked for me.
2012-04-14T04:46:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	thanks allot :) I am actually working on creating 12.04 Beta 2 Xen Templates :)
2012-04-14T04:46:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	 i assume that you are using no proxy / your proxy is correctly configured?
2012-04-14T04:47:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	I a 4 node cluster running Xen :)
2012-04-14T04:47:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	I got a 4 node cluster running Xen :)
2012-04-14T04:47:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	no proxy
2012-04-14T04:48:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	I am putting the beta out there for my customers for testing :)
2012-04-14T04:48:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	maybe i'm your customer. i have rented 2 ubuntu servers out there. one runs on xen, actually ^^
2012-04-14T04:49:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	which Ubuntu version?
2012-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	one runs on 11.04 the other one on 10.10
2012-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	nope, my customers stick to LTS releases. I have the whole 9 yards from 9.10 to 11.10... everyone's on 10.04 :)
2012-04-14T04:51:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	that's why I am throwing 12.04 Beta at them. They can just apt-get their way to the release
2012-04-14T04:52:00.000Z	i7c	marcm	LTS is nice indeed :)
2012-04-14T04:53:00.000Z	marcm	i7c	figured it out. networking isn't confugured right... damn you xen! I have a more streight forward approach to making templates: I first install the distro on Xen HVM, then convert it to Xen PV, and finally I apply the latest updates, do cleanup and reset the config files.
