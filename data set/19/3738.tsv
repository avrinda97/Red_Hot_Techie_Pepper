2009-10-17T06:41:00.000Z	mattgyver		how can i add an application to my path?
2009-10-17T06:42:00.000Z	edbian	mattgyver	What do you mean?  I don't think what you asked makes any sense.  Are you working in a terminal?
2009-10-17T06:43:00.000Z	mattgyver	edbian	i mean so that i can just run the app name as opposed to navigating to the directory and running the application
2009-10-17T06:43:00.000Z	edbian	mattgyver	The proper place to put that is in /usr/local/bin
2009-10-17T06:43:00.000Z	mattgyver	edbian	yeah i guess i could just do that, that works
2009-10-17T06:43:00.000Z	mattgyver		I thought there was a way to add it to like .bashrc or something to just set the path there
2009-10-17T06:43:00.000Z	edbian	mattgyver	That would be the "proper" way to do it :)
2009-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	mattgyver	I'm not aware of anything like that
2009-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	mattgyver	edbian	I had to do it once before, i just cant remember what i had to do
2009-10-17T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	mattgyver	Mmm, if you remember let me know.  I'm interested
2009-10-17T06:45:00.000Z	mattgyver	edbian	I got a giant ubuntu book here, i guess i should look in it ';) i read it in there
2009-10-17T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	mattgyver	There's an idea! lol
2009-10-17T06:45:00.000Z	mattgyver		actually i got several nix books, heh
2009-10-17T06:45:00.000Z	mattgyver		just a bum i guess
