2005-04-03T11:29:00.000Z	Jeezis	bob2	sure
2005-05-05T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	please paste stuf in #flood, not here
2005-05-05T08:21:00.000Z	Jeezis	bob2	ok
2005-05-27T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	chmod
2005-05-27T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	any file you create you can edit, though
2005-05-27T11:38:00.000Z	Jeezis	bob2	i'm trying to save /etc/pcmcia/config to save and it keeps telling me it fails
2005-05-27T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	sudo nano /etc/pcmcia/config
2005-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	you can't recreate those files
2005-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	but X will not fail to start just because it's log is missing
2005-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	Jeezis	bob2	that's what it's saying
2005-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	show us the exact wording in #flood
2005-09-30T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	type it out manually then
2005-09-30T09:27:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	that doesn't sound like X caring about the log being gone
2005-09-30T09:27:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	what else did you do?
2005-09-30T09:28:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	don't be silly
2005-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	Jeezis	bob2	could i just reinstall xserver-xorg?
2005-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	not unless you actually know what the problem is
2005-09-30T09:30:00.000Z	bob2	Jeezis	login to a terminal and run "X".  if it pops up a black and white screen, hit ctrl-alt-delete
