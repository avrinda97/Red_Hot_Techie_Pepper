2005-07-04T10:09:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	does he have a special drive setup?
2005-07-04T10:11:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	System Rescue CD comes with a nice bootmanager a little more compatible than GRUB
2005-07-04T10:12:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	good luck ;) but, always keep that in your toolbox henceforth
2005-07-04T10:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	if you install GRUB to MBR, all should work fine
2005-07-04T10:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	XD, note the capitalization
2005-07-11T10:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	C-a scrolls to the beginning of the line, you idiot ;)
2005-07-11T10:54:00.000Z	adwait	Razor-X	C-a = select all in winblows (new convert) :)
2005-07-11T10:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	ewwwwwwwwwwww!

2005-07-13T11:52:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	better support for smaller files, like an MP3 collection
2005-07-13T11:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	like I said... why?
2005-07-13T12:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	my policy is not to blindly make memorize, but to teach
2005-07-13T12:00:00.000Z	adwait	Razor-X	hmm.......<thumbs up>
2005-07-14T08:24:00.000Z	Razor-X	adwait	also has the most memory leaks, its bloated, and other flaws
