2008-07-07T11:12:00.000Z	ubuntu__		ok how do i find out my username so i can login lol
2008-07-07T11:12:00.000Z	ubuntu__		now i am
2008-07-07T11:13:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	now that you are on the live CD? have you chrooted into the system?
2008-07-07T11:15:00.000Z	ubuntu__	unop	no i have not chrooted
2008-07-07T11:18:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	mount your harddrive up and browse it
2008-07-07T11:19:00.000Z	ubuntu__	unop	mounted now look for what
2008-07-07T11:19:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	find the /home directory and look under it
2008-07-07T11:20:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	so you know your username but not your password? is that it?
2010-04-03T04:11:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	no. but you can backup /home before the install and then restore it afterwards.
2010-04-03T04:12:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	/home is a separate dir
2010-04-03T04:12:00.000Z	ubuntu__	unop	by default?
2010-04-03T04:13:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	Draglor - do you mean "separate partition" instead??
2010-04-03T04:13:00.000Z	ubuntu__	unop	yeah
2010-04-03T04:13:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	yes /home is always a separate dir then
2010-04-03T04:14:00.000Z	ubuntu__	unop	so i should be ablt to reinstall to the root dir and not touch home
2010-04-03T04:14:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	 well, is your /home on a different partition or not?  if not, then no
2010-04-03T04:15:00.000Z	ubuntu__	unop	right ansd ubuntu defaults to only 2 part. swao and everthing else
2010-04-03T04:17:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	perhaps, i'm not sure -- I always create a separate partition for /home -- the point is, if the installer formats / in the install process, then you lose /home -- you can stop the installer from formatting / but then that defeats the point of a 'clean install' or a 'reinstall' as you are left with all the cruft from the old install.
2010-04-03T04:18:00.000Z	unop	ubuntu__	 enter the maintenance shell and then try ..  sudo mount -a  # that should list the problem hopefully
