2011-12-23T21:25:00.000Z	zxiest		Hey guys ... E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/). How can I know which process is locking it?
2011-12-23T21:26:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	ps aux | egrep "(apt|dpkg)"   -- its also possible that nothing is locking it and apt crashed.
2011-12-23T21:28:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	I have a long list after issuing your command
2011-12-23T21:28:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	You typed this exactly?  ps aux | egrep "(apt|dpkg)"
2011-12-23T21:29:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	Can you pastebin the results?
2011-12-23T21:29:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	sure.. 1 sec

2011-12-23T21:31:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	Ah, looks like dpkg is running in the background.  Do you have another terminal open that is running something?
2011-12-23T21:31:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	the other terminal running has "top" running
2011-12-23T21:32:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	just closed it and got the same results
2011-12-23T21:32:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	Odd, it says its been running since december 11th.  Well. I guess you could kill the process and then run the fixapt instructions above.
2011-12-23T21:32:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	It's a server I have in the cloud. I think I updated to ubuntu 11.10 that day
2011-12-23T21:33:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	Are you sure it finished upgrading?  it says it is running in pts/2
2011-12-23T21:33:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	not sure it finished updating. Shouldn't be finished by now?
2011-12-23T21:34:00.000Z	Pici	zxiest	It could be looking for your input
2011-12-23T21:35:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	hold on... I saw a msg from it when I booted .. 1 sec
2011-12-23T21:48:00.000Z	zxiest	Pici	and auronandace thanks... working now :-)
