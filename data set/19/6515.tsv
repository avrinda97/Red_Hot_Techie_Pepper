2011-07-14T11:31:00.000Z	mikubuntu	ActionParsnip	thx for your help earlier in the day, i had to leave and come back to this printer prob.  i reinstalled hplip and now computer and printer are communicating (but printer not giving me good image for some reason)  is it possible i need to run several test pages to 'break in' the printheads?
2011-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikubuntu	afaik hp heads are in the cartridges
2012-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikubuntu	libreoffice can export to PDF and you can then send that
2012-11-02T05:29:00.000Z	mikubuntu	ActionParsnip	I know that, and I will -- but, still the question -- isn't microsoft SUPPOSED to be able to read .odt?
2012-11-02T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikubuntu	no idea, try asking in ##windows
2012-11-02T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikubuntu	and you mean MS OFFICE is able to read odt, Microsoft is a company, not a software
2012-11-02T05:30:00.000Z	mikubuntu	ActionParsnip	yes, OFFICE
2012-11-02T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikubuntu	there is a difference
2012-11-02T05:31:00.000Z	mikubuntu	ActionParsnip	I HATE MICROSOFT
2012-11-02T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikubuntu	ok......
