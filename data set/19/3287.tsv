2009-09-27T23:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	What emulator?
2009-09-27T23:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	It looks like that is available in the repos, is there a reason you are compiling from source?
2009-09-27T23:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	You can install it with apt-get or synaptic, the package is named gxemul
2009-09-27T23:07:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	working right now. how did you find out the name of the package tho, for future problems that could save me a lot of time
2009-09-27T23:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	Well "XE" is absolutely worthless for searching so to find out what XE was I googled "XE emulator" found the project page with a short description that it was a multi-system emulator and di apt-cache search multi emulator
2009-09-27T23:16:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	I installed the gxemul but it doesnt show in my menu
2009-09-27T23:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	Can you start it from the terminal?
2009-09-27T23:17:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	Ill pastebin the result hold on
2009-09-27T23:24:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	any idea?
2009-09-27T23:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	What are you trying to emulate?
2009-09-27T23:26:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	right now im not trying to emulate a game, i just want XE in the menu
2009-09-27T23:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	Have you used XE before?
2009-09-27T23:27:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	Never. just installed it
2009-09-27T23:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	If you are trying to emulate n64 or snes there are more user friendly emulators for that
2009-09-27T23:31:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	I have one for snes, but i want to also emulate nes, n64, sega saturn, and sega genesis but dont want my computer loaded with diff emulators
2009-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Casper1	I haven't used XE so I can't help you with using it, "man gxemul" might help, once you figure out the options you want you can add menu entries by right clicking on the Applications menu
2009-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	Casper1	Jordan_U	ok thx
