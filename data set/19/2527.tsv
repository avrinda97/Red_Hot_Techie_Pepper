2010-03-10T19:23:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar		alacarte saved my configuration, but it doesn't apply to the menu. Do I have to press revert? I don't think that would make sense. Any ideas?
2010-03-10T19:25:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar		how do I apply the changes in alacarte?
2010-03-10T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	tey apply on the fly as I recall, just click close after sorting your stuff, should be ok
2010-03-10T19:27:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	alacarte still shows them, and I rebooted just in case, but the global menu is not showing the edit
2010-03-10T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	thats all i know dude, i ditched gnome desktop a while back
2010-03-10T19:28:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	what are you using now?
2010-03-10T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	lxde baby :)
2010-03-10T19:28:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	why?
2010-03-10T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	i like its lightning quickness and no nonesense
2010-03-10T19:29:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	no nonsense? does that mean you have to edit configurations by file?
2010-03-10T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	some but there are many guis, i just dont like this who compiz by default, bloat that comes with ubuntu so i use minimal and then install lxde, works great and keeps the system small and punchy
2010-03-10T19:32:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	I hear that. I don't know why, but back in the day, compiz was snappier on my older laptop, now on my new one it's slower. I don't know why though.
2010-03-19T10:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	bleachbit can clean a little more, deborphan is awesome
2010-03-19T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	make sure you close as many apps as you can to maximise effectiveness and run it as both user and root
2010-03-19T10:36:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	bazhang , how is this compared to computer janitor? and if I don't use these crap cleaner tools, will it bog down my system?
2010-03-19T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	bleachbit does a lot more
2010-03-19T10:39:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	should I be using it? does it make a difference in speed? or is it primarily for security/privacy?
2010-03-19T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	paranoid_pedlar	it just keeps the data space used to a minimum by clearing out caches etc
2010-03-19T10:40:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	ActionParsnip	the site says it speeds up firefox, so that is pretty much a sale to me
