2006-01-09T07:36:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		hey, is it possible to specify a gateway while using DHCP?
2006-01-09T07:36:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	certainly
2006-01-09T07:36:00.000Z	thecoolestcow	Loevborg	ifconfig? network tools? with neither could i find an answer
2006-01-09T07:37:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	what are you trying to do?
2006-01-09T07:37:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	normally the dhcp server will transmit a default gateway address
2006-01-09T07:37:00.000Z	thecoolestcow	Loevborg	well i just set up a sonicwall with a linksys wireless router as a hub, and i don't think that it is using the right gateway
2006-01-09T07:38:00.000Z	thecoolestcow	Loevborg	yeah thats the thing, my DHCP server is different from my gateway
2006-01-09T07:38:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	you can manually use "route add default gw 12.34.56.78"
2006-01-09T07:38:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	or check out the "ip" command line utility
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	I'm unsure if you can do it through the gui
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		loevborg, ok cool, i'll try those.
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		i don't like the gui
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		i use debian normally, but my dad has ubuntu
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	Loevborg		it's just as well
2006-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		bobby your regular pw may do it, but there is no real root pw
2006-01-09T07:40:00.000Z	Loevborg	thecoolestcow	maybe you need to drop the other gateway first, btw
2006-01-09T07:41:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		loevborg, oh. how do i do that
2006-01-09T07:42:00.000Z	thecoolestcow		foot once you install kde, in the "session" button, select KDE at hte logon screen
2006-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	thecoolestcow	Loevborg	how do i remove the current default gateway
