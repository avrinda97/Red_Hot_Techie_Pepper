2008-05-02T02:43:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne		HELP!! can someone help me with this Please .... ERROR : " Unable to build the vmmon module. " Error I keep getting ? I think there is a problem with the compiler ??? I downloaded the essentials but same issue
2008-05-02T02:44:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	are you attempting to install vmware?
2008-05-02T02:46:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	YES
2008-05-02T02:47:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	watch the caps please. The problem with vmware at this time is that the vmmon module has a line in it which has to be changed. You can see which line as it also states the error.
2008-05-02T02:47:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	if you google for this error, you will also find some pages suggesting the any-any patch. This will not work. (i've had the error myself)
2008-05-02T02:49:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	I have tried the any any fix and the other fix that you have to adjust a file and that one doesn't work either..
2008-05-02T02:50:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	what file did you adjust? How did you adjust it? What have you tried so far? Can you pastebin your error?
2008-05-02T02:51:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	yeah I can pastebin it for you one sec

2008-05-02T02:58:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	2.6.24-16-generic
2008-05-02T02:59:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	this one i haven't seen. this one is from the any-any patch?
2008-05-02T03:00:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	no just doing it normal
2008-05-02T03:00:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	this is the other fix I tried : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=770716
2008-05-02T03:01:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	you have repacked vmmon.tar? If so, can you please untar it for me, and pastebin that entire file? or at least the section which contains the change?
2008-05-02T03:02:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	change #include “asm/bitops.h” to #include “linux/bitops.h”
2008-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	you have to change a line like that yes. Not exactly to that. The changed line should read  << #include "linux/bitops.h" >>  instead of   << #include "asm/bitops.h >>  and not the entire line. Note that i surround commands and other functions with << and >> which should _NOT_ be added on commands
2008-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	hischild	Ghostinthedarkne	i have to go for a bit. I'll be back later.
2008-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	Ghostinthedarkne	hischild	yeah thats what I did..
