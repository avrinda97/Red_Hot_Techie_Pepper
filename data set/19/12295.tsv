2006-03-15T12:04:00.000Z	Viking667		So, any answers to my previous question aside from downloading required packages manually?
2006-03-15T12:06:00.000Z	Viking667		They'll either help, or they won't.
2006-03-15T12:06:00.000Z	Viking667		I've asked a question, and am awaiting an answer.
2006-03-15T12:06:00.000Z	Viking667		Ih
2006-03-15T12:06:00.000Z	Viking667		Sorry, I had a question about Breezy update packages... I'm trying to upgrade to OpenOffice.org2-2.0.1, but the packages don't show up in thp Packages.gz of "breezy-updates"
2006-03-15T12:07:00.000Z	Viking667		Should I just download the packages and dpkg them into place along with the requirements?
2006-03-15T12:07:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 breezy is the current stable version - it only gets security updates, not version upgrades
2006-03-15T12:09:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 it would probably be better to install a tarball rather than a .deb
2006-03-15T12:10:00.000Z	Viking667	wastrel	hrmm? On a Ubuntu system? You're suggesting I actually *don't* use a deb? <grin> That must be a rare recommendation</grin>
2006-03-15T12:10:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 installing foreign .debs can mess up your package db's (or so i understand...)
2006-03-15T12:11:00.000Z	Viking667	wastrel	these are debs supplied in the pool of Ubuntu - the "main" pool. Hardly foreign, except perhaps to Breezy...
2006-03-15T12:12:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 are these dapper packages?
2006-03-15T12:14:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 they're dapper packages.  it's probably unwise to install them on breezy.  you can upgrade to dapper (due out on the 20th i believe) or go to the oo.org website and download a tarball
2006-03-15T12:25:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 you can upgrade to dapper by changing your sources.list entries to dapper, but you might want to wait until release - dapper is still in testing phase and isn't fully stable
2006-03-15T12:26:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 it'll still be a big download - but in small pieces, rather than as one iso...
2006-03-15T12:34:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 there's some windows versions of open sourcesoftware provided on the ubuntu installer disk
2006-03-15T12:34:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 er, on the livecd i mean...  not sure about the installer
2006-03-15T12:35:00.000Z	Viking667	wastrel	Windows versions aren't much good to a machine without Windows
2006-03-15T12:36:00.000Z	wastrel	Viking667	 yeah - on the livecd it's so you can "try before you buy"  - get used to some opensource apps before you install ubu... maybe the installer disk has some windows sw too... not sure :]
