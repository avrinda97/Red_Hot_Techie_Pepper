2008-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	wait a sec ill type a full way of trying sound...
2008-12-14T23:00:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	first you type on a terminal gksudo nautilus and go to /etc/x11/xsession.d and remove 70pulseaudio or anypulseaudio thing there, then close nautilus, then type on terminal sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio, then go to system-preferences-sound and select alsa
2008-12-14T23:01:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	select alsa for every single thing u have
2008-12-14T23:01:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	after that restart the desktop with ctrl alt backspace or just restart the comptuer
2008-12-14T23:03:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	try not removing 70pulseaudio just cut it and paste it in other place just in case it doesnt work
2008-12-14T23:05:00.000Z	racarter	berilio	i have two options for ALSA in sound preferences: 1. HDA Intel ALC85IVD Analog (ALSA) and just plain ALSA
2008-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	HDA Intel
2008-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	if it doesnt work, plain alsa...
2008-12-14T23:11:00.000Z	berilio	racarter	try alsaconf if u dont have that sudo apt-get install alsa*
