2010-10-16T12:48:00.000Z	Lanh		Hi, anyone well-versed in GnuPG and Psi at all? I need help, Psi isn't recognising my keys to allow me to select them
2010-10-16T12:49:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	you are or are not well versed in gnuPg and PSI ?
2010-10-16T12:51:00.000Z	Lanh	_Beast	I know enough to get it working in Thunderbird, and it worked in my previous install, but for some reason, this time around for some reason, my keys aren't showing up
2010-10-16T12:51:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	your private keys ?
2010-10-16T12:51:00.000Z	Lanh		I'm using 10.04 by the way...I tried meerkat but it kept freezing randomly, so I reverted to the LTS version
2010-10-16T12:52:00.000Z	Lanh	_Beast	yes
2010-10-16T12:52:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	I had the same issue with my private keys unfortunately I just made new ones
2010-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	Lanh	_Beast	They showed up in the PSI window after you did that?
2010-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	No I did not
2010-10-16T12:54:00.000Z	_Beast		lol
2010-10-16T12:55:00.000Z	_Beast		rofl serious inquiries only
2010-10-16T12:55:00.000Z	Lanh		Ah, they've just disappeared from Thunderbird too...looks like I'm going to have to create new ones after all
2010-10-16T12:56:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	I know the feeling
2010-10-16T12:57:00.000Z	Lanh	_Beast	Such is life I guess mate, lol
2010-10-16T12:57:00.000Z	Lanh	_Beast	At least most of my system was recoverable
2010-10-16T12:59:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	lol ;) , yes for some reason that is
2010-10-16T13:02:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	Can you even view the keys ? I am trying to think of a way possible to recover them
2010-10-16T13:03:00.000Z	Lanh	_Beast	Nah mate, I've just created a new one and sent it out
2010-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	_Beast	Lanh	10-4
