2011-11-09T00:55:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	i have a very diff..question about your server what w-psu have..
2011-11-09T00:57:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	its one of these http://www.ebuyer.com/281915-hp-proliant-turion-ii-n40l-microserver-100-cashback-658553-421 so it has 150watt
2011-11-09T00:59:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	can you elaborate on your question as i am quite concerned now :)
2011-11-09T01:01:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	i did see the configuration..150 w is only for 1 hdd not for 3-4
2011-11-09T01:02:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	hmm good point, i do have a larger psu should i upgrade it
2011-11-09T01:02:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	i assumed they would have given ample room for multiple drives
2011-11-09T01:03:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	if you put more that one you will destroy the cpu..so extend the psu to 500w don't worry ..about it.
2011-11-09T01:03:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	upgrading now :)
2011-11-09T01:04:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	can you tell me about my question about raid1, will only the OS files go in the 250gb drive and the rest i.e. /home go on the raid?
2011-11-09T01:05:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	raid of windows simply cannot do anything about it
2011-11-09T01:06:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	sorry i do not understand your answer? are you not on ubuntu?
2011-11-09T01:07:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	do you think that the problem..then ask the question in the community and wait ..till you are really assured in making decisions
2011-11-09T01:09:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	please do not be offended i am simply trying to understand my raid setup i am currently installing. I just want to know if the files i put on the computer that are non OS related will automaticcally be stored on the raid or do i need to set it up in a specific way
2011-11-09T01:10:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	i only asked about being on ubuntu because you mentioned windows
2011-11-09T01:13:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	do you have any idea of raid why do they use raid in servers..
2011-11-09T01:15:00.000Z	ceephax	maxx878	no but i am very keen in learning. hence building a server with raid
2011-11-09T01:16:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	for time sake read and understand; you look so much concern about the failure of hdd..
2011-11-09T01:19:00.000Z	maxx878	ceephax	we can help you in many ways to implement is up to you...:))
