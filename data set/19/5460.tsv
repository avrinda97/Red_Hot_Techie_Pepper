2008-06-30T20:44:00.000Z	SakuraKinomoto	Jack_Sparrow	it is just showing me some links to mount them, i don't want those links
2008-06-30T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SakuraKinomoto	look in /etc/fstab and see if they appear in there

2008-06-30T20:57:00.000Z	SakuraKinomoto	Jack_Sparrow	for any user, even root, cause this linux is inside a virtual machine, and it is showing me some real partitions, if host os and this virtual linux access the same partition at the same time....
