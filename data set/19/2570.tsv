2010-03-01T23:46:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-30709.html does not even mention the term "Secure Shell Key".
2010-03-01T23:47:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	what do you think ssh-key stands for?
2010-03-01T23:47:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	Let me see.
2010-03-01T23:48:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	little hint:ssh = secure shell
2010-03-01T23:50:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	The article http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-30709.html includes ssh-keygen but not ssh-key.
2010-03-01T23:51:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	what do you want to do, what do you need a tut for?
2010-03-01T23:53:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	For using the the Secure Shell Key having the Key ID=FC2C... but no Validity in my Seahorse program.
2010-03-01T23:53:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	seahorse? isn't that a gui to gnuPG?
2010-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	Yes, it is.
2010-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	bnupg != secure shell
2010-03-02T00:01:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	Synaptic: "Seahorse is a GNOME front end for the program »Gnu Privacy Guard« (GnuPG)." --  My question is still unanswered.
2010-03-02T00:01:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	nope you asked about secure shell keys, and that is something complete different from gnuüg
2010-03-02T00:03:00.000Z	bullgard	orson	Please note that my program Seahorse lists a Secure Shell Key having the Key ID=FC2C...
2010-03-02T00:06:00.000Z	orson	bullgard	since i never used that, i cannot answer it. but google needed about 0.1 sec to give http://debianadmin.com/ssh-key-authentication-using-seahorse-gui-html
