2007-06-15T10:40:00.000Z	Surkow_		when I install ubuntu feisty fawn there is no way I can boot from it
2007-06-15T10:41:00.000Z	Surkow_		grub returns me error 22
2007-06-15T10:42:00.000Z	Surkow_		windows is the only thing that currently boots :D
2007-06-15T10:42:00.000Z	Surkow_		with grub
2007-06-15T10:42:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	grub error 22 is "No such partition".  It is probably looking for hda1 or hdd2 or something that is not there.  you need to edit menu.lst to have the right partition
2007-06-15T10:43:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	from live cd, mount your harddrive, then you will be able to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-06-15T10:43:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	try "locate menu.lst"
2007-06-15T10:46:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	sry I read the wrong error message yours is "22 : "Must load Multiboot kernel before modules""
2007-06-15T10:46:00.000Z	Surkow_	hwilde	- actually you are correct
2007-06-15T10:46:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	"This error is returned if the module load command is used before loading a Multiboot kernel. It only makes sense in this case anyway, as GRUB has no idea how to communicate the presence of location of such modules to a non-Multiboot-aware kernel."
2007-06-15T10:47:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	sudo fdisk -l
2007-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	Surkow_	hwilde	- I posted a message in a personal dialog
2007-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	I didn't get anything send it again
2007-06-15T10:50:00.000Z	hwilde	Surkow_	/msg nickserv identify [password]
