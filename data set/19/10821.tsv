2009-04-04T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	that means the package is not available
2009-04-04T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	not "you can't download anything"
2009-04-04T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	ok - so why did you not sasy that if you know thats the problem, instead of saying I can't download anything
2009-04-04T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	control your language , we know what wtf means
2009-04-04T01:22:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	you'll get better responses if say what the problem is, you know you've modified your sources - yet you said the problem is you can't download anything
2009-04-04T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	if there is an update available ubuntu will offer one
2009-04-04T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	then there is not an update available from ubuntu
2009-04-04T01:44:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	current ubuntu stable is 1.2.5.2
2009-04-04T01:44:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	ubuntu has not packaged it yet
2009-04-04T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	thats right, you'll find anything thats available in the package manager
2009-04-04T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	casper_	if you open synaptic and browse
