2006-07-14T16:42:00.000Z	martii		I want to resize NTFS partition prior to install
2006-07-14T16:42:00.000Z	martii		why so big?
2006-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	stefg	martii	this is a box which came with XP preinstalled and only recovery-CDs, right?
2006-07-14T16:44:00.000Z	martii	stefg	yep Compaq
2006-07-14T16:44:00.000Z	martii	stefg	should I go for manual ?
2006-07-14T16:45:00.000Z	martii	stefg	this is compaq presario sr1000
2006-07-14T16:45:00.000Z	stefg		The problem is that these preinstalls are made by simply throwing an image on disk... the filesystem can't be shrunk properly, and watch out not to loose the compaq diagnostic partiton
2006-07-14T16:46:00.000Z	martii	stefg	so what can I do?
2006-07-14T16:46:00.000Z	martii	stefg	I want to resize sda2 partition that is XP sda1 is daignostic
2006-07-14T16:47:00.000Z	martii	stefg	utomated resizing wants to take 70GB that is far too much I want to give linux no more than 5-7
2006-07-14T16:47:00.000Z	stefg	martii	do have a backup application which can image the partition and resize it on restore like Ghost or Disk Director?
2006-07-14T16:47:00.000Z	martii	stefg	I can try partimage
2006-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	stefg		no partimage can only restore to original size
2006-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	martii	stefg	yep true
2006-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	martii	stefg	so I'm stuck wind windows :)
2006-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	martii	stefg	as I don't have anything like ghost
2006-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	stefg	martii	can you paste a fdisk -l listing  to pastebin?
2006-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	martii	stefg	nope as I install in alternate mode
2006-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	martii	stefg	livecd ends up with black screen
