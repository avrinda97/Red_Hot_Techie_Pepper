2007-10-10T13:05:00.000Z	musashi		my windows xp wont boot anymore, im getting an error that the boot location has changed
2007-10-10T13:05:00.000Z	musashi		i installed ubuntu before all this happened
2007-10-10T13:06:00.000Z	musashi		i dont even know how to phrase this.
2007-10-10T13:06:00.000Z	musashi		but then ubuntu wont be accesable
2007-10-10T13:06:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	how did the problem occur?
2007-10-10T13:07:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	does Vista still boot?
2007-10-10T13:08:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	did Ubuntu automatically create the Grub menu?
2007-10-10T13:08:00.000Z	musashi	Jimmey	yea
2007-10-10T13:09:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	and you didn't edit the menu.lst?
2007-10-10T13:11:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	can you select XP from the boot menu?
2007-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	musashi	Jimmey	yes i can, it give me an error : <windows root> \system32\hal.dll
2007-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	that's a Windows problem
2007-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	musashi	Jimmey	i googled it and it says that its from the position of XP changing from when it was installed
2007-10-10T13:12:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	did you re-size the XP partition during the installation of Ubuntu?
2007-10-10T13:14:00.000Z	Jimmey	musashi	that's probably why, then - Did you defrag XP before all of this?
2007-10-10T13:14:00.000Z	musashi	Jimmey	no..
