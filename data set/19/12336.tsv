2010-04-13T21:17:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		noob question, when compiling a new kernel is it possible to have the make config script search lspci and only select the modules it detects?  it such a pain in the posterior to have to make a new config for each kernel version
2010-04-13T21:17:00.000Z	sipior	PyroPhelia	you can use the previous kernel config file as a starting point for the new kernel.
2010-04-13T21:18:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		really? i'm surprized more people haven't asked that.
2010-04-13T21:18:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		it would seem to make the process a little more effecient.  but, maybe that's just me
2010-04-13T21:19:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		I wonder what the negative aspect of having the make script search for installed compents would be.
2010-04-13T21:19:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		there has to be some reason they haven't implemented it
2010-04-13T21:20:00.000Z	sipior	PyroPhelia	lots of folks like to throw in modules for devices they don't yet have. people who care enough to build their own kernels take the time to do it right.
2010-04-13T21:21:00.000Z	sipior	PyroPhelia	you can use the previous kernel config as a starting point for the new kernel config, so that you only need to review new/changed modules.
2010-04-13T21:23:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		I know this isn't the right place to ask, but has anybody ever experienced a bug with filezilla that only allows 100Mbps transfers over sftp?
2010-04-13T21:24:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		Maginot, no 100Mbit/s  not 100Mbyte.
2010-04-13T21:24:00.000Z	PyroPhelia	Exposure548	and no, I can hit a full 1Gbps over nfs/afp/scp
2010-04-13T21:24:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		100Mbit = ~12Mbytes
2010-04-13T21:25:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		yes it is
2010-04-13T21:25:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		it's sftp copy
2010-04-13T21:26:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		so if scp can transfer @ 1Gbps it's illogical to assume that the problem lies in cpu or protocol overhead
2010-04-13T21:26:00.000Z	PyroPhelia		motd, nfs, scp,afp all transfer at 100Mbyte+
2010-04-13T21:26:00.000Z	PyroPhelia	Exposure548	that's what I'm thinking but I can't find anything about it
2010-04-13T21:27:00.000Z	PyroPhelia	Exposure548	it's also a very curious bug.  If I open  10 conncurrent transfer then I can reach ~100MBps just like over scp or nfs.  but each individual connection through filezila never transfer at a higher rate than 100Mbit/s
2010-04-13T21:29:00.000Z	sipior	PyroPhelia	have you tried the filezilla forum? contacting the developers? filing a bug report?
