2005-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	wilow		Response is:
2005-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	wilow		"/dev/hda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive"
2005-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	wilow		Hmm.. only 1 and a half hours wasted on a trvial linux problem which is still not solved.
2005-07-23T15:53:00.000Z	wilow		I can almost assure you that I would read through half of it, get half and won't get half.  That will takes hours.  I can assure you, that idea is not even worth considering.  Just like most of the stupid linux man pages without any examples of the parameters in play in which can and can't be used together etc.
2005-07-23T15:55:00.000Z	reka	wilow	i understand your frustration and personally, i would just reinstall and get it over and done with.  did you have a seperate home partition?
2005-07-23T15:56:00.000Z	wilow		No, not in this install.  I usually do it with other Linux Distos but I'm new to Ubuntu and wanted to pretty much just Use linux not nessessary Learn linux.
2005-07-23T15:58:00.000Z	reka	wilow	ok then, you can use something like this: http://ext2fsd.sourceforge.net/ or this: http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm to get the files you need on your ubuntu partition.
2005-07-23T15:59:00.000Z	reka	wilow	...then just reinstall....take the experience with a grain of salt.  at least it will remind you next time to work out which is the boot partition before installing windows
2005-07-23T16:02:00.000Z	wilow	reka	Windows has stopped me booting Linux
2005-07-23T16:02:00.000Z	wilow		A very common occurrence. What happens is that Uncle Bill does not accept that any other operating system (O/S) apart from one created by Microsoft should be allowed to run on a PC. So, when you load / re-load any of Uncle Bill's O/Ss it will overwrite a part of your hard disk called the Master Boot Record (mbr). This is the bit that tells your PC, during boot up, where to find the operating system.  (Knew this already.... but AMEN)
2005-07-23T16:03:00.000Z	reka	wilow	i was actually thinking of that....didn't want to start the ms-hating. :)
