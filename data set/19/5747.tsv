2008-11-09T22:03:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	if your data is really important, you should have backups anyway
2008-11-09T22:05:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	and let me repeat, if you care about your data you should backup, there is a lot others things that can make you lose your data, besides formatting
2008-11-09T22:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	if you run all your apps with a regular user, the data is alls kept on their respective home dir
2008-11-09T22:15:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	it copies files from the current dir to /new
2008-11-09T22:16:00.000Z	knoppix	joaopinto	why no use cp * /new then?
2008-11-09T22:17:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	because cp * does not handle symbolic links
2008-11-09T22:19:00.000Z	knoppix	joaopinto	do you have any idea?
2008-11-09T22:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	no, I already told you a long time a go how to proceed, select your / partition to install, but just make sure the format option is disabled, /home will not be deleted
2008-11-09T22:26:00.000Z	knoppix	joaopinto	with that one very complicated command for copying into the new dir are all the links to your browserprefs and mailclientinboxes preserved?
2008-11-09T22:26:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	if you don't have a clear understand of the commands you are executing, you are endangering your copy
2008-11-09T22:27:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	if you already have an installation, why not just upgrade with the update-manager ?
2008-11-09T22:27:00.000Z	knoppix	joaopinto	I did that now I can't get into it anymore
2008-11-09T22:28:00.000Z	knoppix	joaopinto	many have adviced me to do a clean install
2008-11-09T22:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	what is your problem logging in ?
2008-11-09T22:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	you mean, it does not start the graphical login manager ?
2008-11-09T22:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	does it present any error ?
2008-11-09T22:29:00.000Z	knoppix	joaopinto	it just seems to hang
2008-11-09T22:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	knoppix	does the livecd works fine ?
