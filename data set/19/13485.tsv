2006-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	ych		i spose burning the files would be good anyway
2006-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	ych		that way i have a safe copy
2006-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	ych		no i want them to stay on the windows box, but make the windows box into a linux box
2006-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	ych		so one computer here
2006-08-10T05:18:00.000Z	ych		huh?
2006-08-10T05:18:00.000Z	ych		yeah but the problem is
2006-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	ych		i cant afford to get another 500GB of HDD to copy to
2006-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	ych		i'd like to stick to my current 3 drives
2006-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	ych		and just convert the FS on them somehow
2006-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	ych		i know
2006-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	thefish	ych	you will need to format those drives
2006-08-10T05:13:00.000Z	thefish	ych	you want to make a file server?
2006-08-10T05:14:00.000Z	thefish	ych	if you need stuff from a disk local to your new linux box, you can mount ntfs, and copy
2006-08-10T05:14:00.000Z	thefish	ych	otherwise you can just copy if off the same as you would from a windows system
2006-08-10T05:16:00.000Z	thefish	ych	for write access, its bad, for read only its fine
2006-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	thefish	ych	what exactly do you want to do? copy files from windows to the new linux box?
2006-08-10T05:18:00.000Z	thefish	ych	i would be careful of that. make a new box, copy all the files off via smb or whatever, then bring the new one up as a file server (samba does that)
2006-08-10T05:19:00.000Z	thefish	ych	making a file linux file server that uses ntfs storage is asking for trouble
2006-08-10T05:20:00.000Z	thefish	ych	if you dont have the space anywhere else, then you need to use DVDs
