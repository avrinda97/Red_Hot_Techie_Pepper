2012-11-13T00:33:00.000Z	jtee		i have a MAXTOR model 6Y060L0 (60G) hard drive that is recognized by BIOS (it's in the boot order map) and is recognized by the ubuntu after boot but not seen by grub.  The command "geometery (hd1)" returns with a no drive found error... Any clues?
2012-11-13T00:34:00.000Z	jtee		..after boot, I can even mount the (hd1,0) partition (hdb1) to a mount point, /mnt/test, and see all the windows files
2012-11-13T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	does grub load?
2012-11-13T00:34:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	I boot through grub
2012-11-13T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	so you do get the grub menu at boot (If you single boot, hold SHIFT at boot)
2012-11-13T00:35:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	the geometry command doesn't see the drive and the windows boot (chainloader) command doesn't find the drive
2012-11-13T00:35:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	so, I am able to look at thinks with the grub cli
2012-11-13T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	if you use a chroot from a liveCD, you can upgrade the OS and reinstall Grub to the MBR
2012-11-13T00:37:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	grub is working just dandy... It sits on (hd0) and runs the show fine.  Where would I reinstall grub to?
2012-11-13T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video
2012-11-13T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	you'd put it in the MBR, the chroot will allow you to run updates and the newer grub may fly better
2012-11-13T00:38:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	it's on the MBR of hd0 already
2012-11-13T00:41:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	It is a pretty ancient version of Grub... wish me luck as I upgrade
2012-11-13T00:42:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	.... says 0.97!
2012-11-13T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	what release did you install?
2012-11-13T01:18:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	yay.... I'm now running grub2... booo... it still can't see the Maxtor drive... (the drive is fine and seen AFTER boot however!)
2012-11-13T01:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jtee	is it a SATA HDD?
2012-11-13T01:34:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	no  it's an old ATA IDE drive
2012-11-13T01:35:00.000Z	jtee	ActionParsnip	I may just end up cloning the drive to a 'newer' one and seeing if grub can handle it better.
