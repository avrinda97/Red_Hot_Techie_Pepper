2012-10-21T00:47:00.000Z	tyrog	never	depends if you want stability or more recent packages. Although 12.10 is stable for me
2012-10-21T00:47:00.000Z	tyrog	never	do you like unity? If so, there are new features in 12.10. The rest is more or less the same with new versions

2012-10-21T00:53:00.000Z	never	tyrog	i use Elemantary OS and ubuntu right now ;)
2012-10-21T00:56:00.000Z	tyrog	never	if you want to upgrade boot the live cd first on your netbook to see if it runs flawlessly
2012-10-21T00:56:00.000Z	tyrog	never	live usb, of course :)
