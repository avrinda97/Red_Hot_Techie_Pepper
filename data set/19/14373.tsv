2005-08-03T15:21:00.000Z	desrt		that way it doesn't each up your entire partition table (which can only have 4 entries)
2005-08-03T15:22:00.000Z	desrt		extended partitions are an awful hack
2005-08-03T15:22:00.000Z	desrt		i never use them
2005-08-03T15:23:00.000Z	desrt		26, i guess?
2005-08-03T15:23:00.000Z	desrt		i'd believe 15 :)
2005-08-03T15:23:00.000Z	desrt		seb128; wb :P
2005-08-03T15:24:00.000Z	desrt		seb128; what's the deal with freezes?
2005-08-03T15:24:00.000Z	desrt		like, what's exempt and not?
2005-08-03T15:25:00.000Z	desrt		mebaran151; lean
2005-08-03T15:25:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	no solid rules
2005-08-03T15:25:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	if something is judged to bring something we want and stable we go for it
2005-08-03T15:26:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	pitti has uploaded 0.5.3 this morning ... is there any 0.5.4 atm? when is it due? what does it change? what does it bring?
2005-08-03T15:27:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	"mostly features" is not something which usually is a good candidate for freezy break
2005-08-03T15:27:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	good candidates are "mostly bug fixes"
2005-08-03T15:28:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	you can ask pitti if he has planned to go for 0.5.4, but I guess 0.5.3 is a good deal atm
2005-08-03T15:31:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	gnome-screensaver seems to be nice, I'll probably send a call to test it today now than gnome-settings-daemon knows about it and we will decide according to that
2005-08-03T15:32:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	you are for gnome-screensaver I guess ? :)
2005-08-03T15:35:00.000Z	seb128	desrt	k, later
