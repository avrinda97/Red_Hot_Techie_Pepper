2006-08-09T08:56:00.000Z	ubuntu___		i just installed ubuntu, but my root partition is full...
2006-08-09T08:57:00.000Z	ubuntu___		is there a way to clean it up a bit?
2006-08-09T08:57:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	sudo apt-get clean
2006-08-09T08:57:00.000Z	ubuntu___		huh?
2006-08-09T08:57:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	that cleans the downloaded stuff that apt-get downloaded
2006-08-09T08:57:00.000Z	ubuntu___		oh oke thanx
2006-08-09T08:58:00.000Z	ubuntu___		hmm still the same
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	ubuntu___		I've got a 680MB root partittion and its totally filled
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	omg
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	give it at least 2gb (the installation told you this)
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	ubuntu___	gfxstyler	I let the installation manager decide
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	ubuntu___		i didn't partition anything
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	do you have windows xp installed, too?
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	ubuntu___		no
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	maybe your free space was too small
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	ubuntu___		I gave ubuntu all my hd (6Gb)
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	how big is your hdd?
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ubuntu___	sounds more like you switched the root partition with the swap partition :D
