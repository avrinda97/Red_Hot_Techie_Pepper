2010-01-20T12:17:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	I believe you're looking for CCSM
2010-01-20T12:06:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	Try leaving out the single quotes
2010-01-20T12:07:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 Ill try that
2010-01-20T12:08:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 nope still nothing
2010-01-20T12:08:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	What's the error?
2010-01-20T12:08:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 brandon@brandon-desktop:~$ cat /home/brandon/Desktop/HB.png /home/brandon/Desktop/HB.rar > hb1.png
2010-01-20T12:09:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 just goes to a new line
2010-01-20T12:09:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	That means the file was created
2010-01-20T12:09:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	Except it went into your home folder, /home/brandon/
2010-01-20T12:09:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 let me check
2010-01-20T12:10:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 homigod thanks I thought it was supposed to show on my desktop since that where my files where.
2010-01-20T12:11:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	Exactly what geirha said, your directory was set to the home folder
2010-01-20T12:14:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 thanks again.
2010-01-20T12:15:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	No problem, have fun =)
2010-01-20T12:16:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	"Wizard plugin"?
2010-01-20T12:16:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 its for more effects.
2010-01-20T12:17:00.000Z	GG19	keepsake	 I have CCSM I just need a plugin that adds to CCSM for more features
2010-01-20T12:19:00.000Z	keepsake	GG19	Do you know what kind of features it gives?
