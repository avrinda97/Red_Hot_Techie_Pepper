2009-07-21T23:48:00.000Z	Alvinware		Urbanvampire, What's it about?
2009-07-21T23:49:00.000Z	Alvinware		Urbanvampire, Do you know any reasons that mozilla Firefox have to do it into two by fresh installation, instead upgrade it?
2009-07-21T23:50:00.000Z	Alvinware	urbanvampire	It make people confuse!
2009-07-21T23:51:00.000Z	urbanvampire	Alvinware	yes, there's at least a few reasons: Ubuntu has a release policy that once a new version has been released only security fixes may be applied. And firefox is in version 3.0.11 for the official release. Second, firefox 3.5 is known to not work with all plugins that worked under 3.0 so not everybody would want it

2009-07-21T23:53:00.000Z	Alvinware		Urbanvampire, To you knowledge. Do you think the latest release of Mozilla Firefox of version 3.5 in Ubuntu was a Beta version for Ubuntu?
2009-07-21T23:54:00.000Z	urbanvampire	Alvinware	no it's not a beta version it's just not the version ubuntu decided to deliver as the official browser for Ubuntug 9.04

2009-07-22T00:00:00.000Z	urbanvampire	Alvinware	it should work but I cannot say it for sure ... haven't tried it
2009-07-22T00:01:00.000Z	Alvinware		Urbanvampire, I have tried to remove it from the Add/Remove, but its said about dependencies, then i wonder should i remove it from the synaptic package manager or not. Any idea?
2009-07-22T00:03:00.000Z	urbanvampire	Alvinware	I'm sorry, haven't tried so I cannot tell you if it's save to remove and what depends on it. I don't want to tell you something I'm not sure of
