2005-08-31T14:24:00.000Z	mrdeath		how i can set
2005-08-31T14:25:00.000Z	Ng	mrdeath	the one on the panel? right click on it and choose preferences
2005-08-31T14:25:00.000Z	Ng	mrdeath	if you mean the full gnome mixer application in Applications->SoundandVideo then go into its file menu and use the Change Device submenu :)
2005-08-31T14:25:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	preferences window don't apear :(
2005-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	Ng	mrdeath	odd, it's not behind another window or something?
2005-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	oh, okay. thanks
2005-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	mrdeath		nope
2005-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	mrdeath		just no window
2005-08-31T14:26:00.000Z	Ng		bizarre :o
2005-08-31T14:27:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	when i try to load gnome-volume-control i get 'No volume control elements and/or devices found.'
2005-08-31T14:28:00.000Z	Ng	mrdeath	does sound work at all? I'm thinking maybe it's not configured properly
2005-08-31T14:28:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	it works with oss module
2005-08-31T14:28:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	my i855 don't work with alsa :(
2005-08-31T14:29:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	i'm listening music now
2005-08-31T14:29:00.000Z	mrdeath		aumix works fine
2005-08-31T14:29:00.000Z	Ng	mrdeath	that's a bit of a pain. I'm not sure how you can persuade the gnome volume things to use oss without them already being running and working :/
2005-08-31T14:30:00.000Z	Ng		you might be able to change the gconf keys directly, but I'm not sure I'm afraid
2005-08-31T14:30:00.000Z	mrdeath	Ng	okay. i will try to figure this situation our myself
