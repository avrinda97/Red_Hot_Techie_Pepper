2007-05-19T07:43:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	you're on an Ubuntu box?
2007-05-19T07:44:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	Yeah
2007-05-19T07:44:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	running Xterm and command line telnet?
2007-05-19T07:45:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	Yes
2007-05-19T07:45:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	have you tried backspace?
2007-05-19T07:46:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	Yes. That takes me to the mobo BIOS
2007-05-19T07:47:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	hrrm. Have you tried running telnet out of textmode, without starting an X session?
2007-05-19T07:47:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	Yes :(
2007-05-19T07:47:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	double-hrrm. :(
2007-05-19T07:48:00.000Z	RobHu		It may be the card checks for something happening that means its never going to work over the serial console
2007-05-19T07:48:00.000Z	RobHu		Like ctrl being depressed
2007-05-19T07:49:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	Maybe, I'm reaching for dusty brain cells here, hiding waaay in back. Heh. Are you sure the receiving terminal is plain VT100?
2007-05-19T07:50:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	I don't know how to check or answer you question.
2007-05-19T07:51:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome		robhu: it seems like if nothing else you should be able to hit the telnet escape sequence and then command telnet to transmit whatever sequences you need.
2007-05-19T07:51:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	How do I do that?
2007-05-19T07:51:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	just a sec.
2007-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	OK, here you go: http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_telnet.htm . The escape sequence should be CTL + ]  , then you can try the various SEND commands listed in the linked page and see if the controller responds.
2007-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	RobHu	InnatechAtHome	Thank you
2007-05-19T07:56:00.000Z	InnatechAtHome	RobHu	you probably want to try the send break and send ec commands first.
