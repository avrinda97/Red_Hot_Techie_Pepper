2010-04-30T01:52:00.000Z	chadi		are the google chrome bookmarks in /home?
2010-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	yes some where in home I guess is where chrome stores it's bookmarks
2010-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	chadi	sebsebseb	/home is already a partition on its own
2010-04-30T01:55:00.000Z	chadi	sebsebseb	Now I want to format the karmic partition and do a clean install of lucid, but I have to link my /home partition to it... hope i find out how to do it during the installation
2010-05-11T23:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	I was going through backlog/scrollback, why do you want to do Ext4?  Which version of Ubuntu?  Also for full Ext4 support  or at least to be sure you have it, you would need to do a clean install of Ubuntu (or if you like put some other distro on that has Ext4).
2010-05-11T23:47:00.000Z	chadi	sebsebseb	lucid, did a clean install
2010-05-11T23:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	ok if you arleady put Lucid on, then you should have got Ext4 by default, unless you told it not to use it of course
2010-05-11T23:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	clean install of Lucid that is
2010-05-11T23:48:00.000Z	chadi	sebsebseb	i have /home on its own aprtition, only / got ext4, /home is still ext3 from karmic
2010-05-11T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	oh right well that's ok
2010-05-11T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	main thing is to have  / in Ext4 if any
2010-05-11T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	altough when it wants to also do a automatic disk check of /home  it will be a bit slower, when it's in Ext3
2010-05-11T23:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	 if you converted from Ext3 to Ext4, you won't quite have the proper thing
2010-05-11T23:49:00.000Z	chadi	sebsebseb	actually i'm thinking of resizing /home, so I might resize and format to ext4 and resize the data
2010-05-11T23:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	for full Ext4 support, you need to start with a brand new partition,  that has only been Ext4
2010-05-11T23:50:00.000Z	chadi	sebsebseb	that's what I am going to do
2010-05-11T23:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	ok
2010-05-11T23:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	also give it a year or so, and things will be about btfs instead of Ext4
2010-05-11T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chadi	btrfs will basically be Ext5,  altough I think actsauly an Ext5 wil also be made
