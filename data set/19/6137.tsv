2008-09-22T08:13:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	first ctrl+alt+ F2.. log in .. then .. sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop.. install drivers... then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start.. ctrl+alt+F7 to get to the gui if it doesn't take you there automatically
2008-09-22T08:15:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	however.. it looks like you're trying to install the drivers from the MF site?  Have you tried the restricted drivers manager under System/admin/Hardware driver?
2008-09-22T08:16:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	what kind of card?
2008-09-22T08:19:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	the 6000 should have triggered the restricted drivers manager.. is this a fresh install? have you done any updates?  if not .. sudo apt-get update.. sudo apt-get upgrade.. sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.. and then it might pop up
2008-09-22T08:24:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	ok.. then maybe your xorg.conf is still being used.. check it out (with no editing privilidges) using gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	once there see what driver is listed if any.
2008-09-22T08:32:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	not sure exactly how to proceed from  here.. others will have an idea on how to verify what's currently loaded..  Is your resolution ok?
2008-09-22T08:34:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	nope.. try .. sudo -s xrandr <resolution>  ... like .. sudo -s xrandr 1280x1024.. or whatever you need
2008-09-22T08:35:00.000Z	darkbishop	izinucs	i try to install a driver that i download form the nvidia website.its said you appear to be running X.please exit before installing... so how do i exit my X???
2008-09-22T08:36:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	can you scroll up to one of my previous posts.. I mention it there.   I'll also  have the bot send you a link to a page that might help.. that is if the bot is working.
2008-09-22T08:41:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	sudo apt-get install build-essential for all that you'll need
2008-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	did any of what I suggested help?
2008-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	sounds  like it's working.. ?
2008-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	np.. glad it's fixed for you
2008-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	don't forget that for tweeking you can install nvidia-settings.. sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings.. after that you'll get an option on the System/Admin menu
2008-09-22T08:51:00.000Z	darkbishop	izinucs	its return E: Couldn't find package nvidia-settings and eveytime i install VLC its said packages broken....
2008-09-22T08:53:00.000Z	izinucs	darkbishop	you can use System/Admin/Synaptic Pack. Mgr to search for nvidia-settings.. its there.. I just checked..
