2005-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	toya__		hm ok
2005-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	toya__		someone wanna tell me why people prefer fvwm than metacity?
2005-12-30T06:11:00.000Z	toya__		and how about the theme feature does that come from metacity?
2005-12-30T06:11:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	metacity drives me NUTS, I cannot get windows to shade right, or even focus right.
2005-12-30T06:13:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	hmm oO?
2005-12-30T06:13:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	in the last week, I've tried at least 4 window managers, and I'm going back to what I've used for the last 4 years, KDE/Kwin
2005-12-30T06:14:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	want to help me install fvwm?
2005-12-30T06:14:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	lol
2005-12-30T06:14:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	i heard its very custumoziable
2005-12-30T06:15:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	there is a tutorial on ubuntuforums, I'll see if I can find it if you like.
2005-12-30T06:15:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	oh its ok then i ll find it on my own
2005-12-30T06:15:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	you have no swap?
2005-12-30T06:16:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	nope
2005-12-30T06:16:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	or you did not assign one.
2005-12-30T06:16:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	did not assign/make one when installing
2005-12-30T06:17:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	I though ubuntu made one by default, can someone confirm that?
2005-12-30T06:21:00.000Z	HeartBT	toya__	either way, if you don't have it, and all is running fine, then you prob. don't need it, If you do have it and don't realize it, no biggie, and it's real easy to turn a dir into swap.
2005-12-30T06:22:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	ok
2005-12-30T06:22:00.000Z	toya__	HeartBT	i might need it once i install huge amount of eye candies
