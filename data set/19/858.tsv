2011-09-02T10:13:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		So where is the FAQ?
2011-09-02T10:14:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		Thank you rww.  Unity sucks eggs.  Having tried it, I hate it because it makes it harder to do a lot of stuff.
2011-09-02T10:14:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		For end-users it is probably better though.
2011-09-02T10:16:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		They do for me.
2011-09-02T10:17:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		No Linux Mint? ^.^
2011-09-02T10:18:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		Uh... none of that stuff is really necessary.  At least not in an OS that will give you flash drives as external hard drives on install.
2011-09-02T10:18:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime		I'm just now trying out 11.04 though, so I don't know if it will install to a flash drive normally.
2011-09-02T10:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	it will instal to a thumb no problem.
2011-09-02T10:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	it is in the something else portion
2011-09-02T10:21:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime	urlin2u	If "something else" then you have to set up partitions manually...
2011-09-02T10:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	yes
2011-09-02T10:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	not really
2011-09-02T10:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	a different design, you have to adapt .
2011-09-02T10:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	you do the same in a different gui is all.
2011-09-02T10:24:00.000Z	Wolfwalker_Prime	urlin2u	but now you have to manually make partitions.
2011-09-02T10:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	yu would on a thumb before as well.
2011-09-02T10:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	what are you planning to run after Natty?
2011-09-02T11:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	Wolfwalker_Prime	don't let the door hit you on the way out,:D
