2010-04-15T02:19:00.000Z	digevol		hey #ubuntu, i am having trouble trying to get an Intel Corp 82801DB Pro/100 VE Ethernet Controller setup and online on an ubuntu 9.10 install anyone have any time to help a guy out?
2010-04-15T02:20:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	can you see the card in lspci?
2010-04-15T02:20:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	yes i can, thats actually how i found out what the thing was to begin with :)
2010-04-15T02:21:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	can you see it in ifconfig?
2010-04-15T02:21:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	any info under eth0?
2010-04-15T02:22:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	i see a HWaddr, inte6 addr, but they look like MAC's and not ip'
2010-04-15T02:23:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	try ifconfig eth0 up
2010-04-15T02:24:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	 should there be an output?
2010-04-15T02:24:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	yes it should say it is now active, or something along those lines..
2010-04-15T02:25:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	sudo ifconfig eth0 up gives no output, no response
2010-04-15T02:25:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	you don't want/need a static IP right?
2010-04-15T02:26:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	it may be nice, but i just want to get online to be honest
2010-04-15T02:26:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	short answer is no, it doesnt need to be static
2010-04-15T02:27:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	ok do:  sudo dhclient eth0
2010-04-15T02:28:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	then try to ping 127.0.0.1
2010-04-15T02:28:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	it responded with no DHCPOFFERS received, no working leases in persistant database
2010-04-15T02:29:00.000Z	switch10	digevol	is your gateway at 192.168.1.1 ?
2010-04-15T02:30:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	 pinging localhost is working. sadly i am no 100% sure of my gateway, if you giveme one minute i can try and find out.  i am on a network i do not have administrative access to
2010-04-15T02:32:00.000Z	digevol	switch10	it looks like my gateway should be 192.168.0.1, assuming the workstation next to me is on the same gateway
