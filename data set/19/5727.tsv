2008-05-13T01:42:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	why? any error messaged?
2008-05-13T01:44:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	it tells me it is going to make changes to the perrmissions and then fails saying it cant make the necesary changes
2008-05-13T01:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	how do you do that?
2008-05-13T01:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	do you use shares-admin? its the tool called when you select the share folder option in nautilus
2008-05-13T01:45:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	browsed the file system to the folder, right clicked properties and the share tab
2008-05-13T01:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	i see same here, it says it doesnt have permission in some path
2008-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	have some minutes? ill try to figure out how it works
2008-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	i have time at work
2008-05-13T01:51:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	you can start nautilus using gksu or you can edit your smb.conf and add/change the line "usershare owner only = False"
2008-05-13T01:53:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	so i can run gksu nautilus and that should let me do it?
2008-05-13T01:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	yeah
2008-05-13T01:53:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	yay it worked.
2008-05-13T01:53:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	thanks
2008-05-13T01:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	acording to the information on launchpad it should work when your user is part of the sambashare group, mine is but i still get that error, but using gksu it works
2008-05-13T01:55:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	hehe
2008-05-13T02:49:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	without passwd? in the share tab check the checkbox that reads something with guest access
2008-05-13T02:55:00.000Z	mgolisch	evil_tech	hm maybe just remove that usershare crap and create proper entries for the share in /etc/samba/smb.conf
2008-05-13T02:56:00.000Z	evil_tech	mgolisch	there a good how to on doing that anywhere?
