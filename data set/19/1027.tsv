2011-06-06T19:25:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		can anyone help me? last night i had formatted a external hdd to change its permissions. after i had formatted it, i restarted my computer, and it majically unformatted and went back to the ntfs filesystem and i can no longer change permissions
2011-06-06T19:27:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		sudo mke2fs -j /dev/sdg
2011-06-06T19:27:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		is this not the command to format my external drive?
2011-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	no you need to make the filesystem on a partition
2011-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	yeshellothere	how do i do this?
2011-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	type ls /dev/sdg?
2011-06-06T19:30:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	you need to do it as root
2011-06-06T19:30:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	yeshellothere	it appears to have no file system....
2011-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	no partitions? no sdg1 or similar?
2011-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	yeshellothere	correct
2011-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	ok so you can use the gui program 'gparted' to create a partition
2011-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	or use cfdisk or similar
2011-06-06T19:32:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	change your mirror to the archive
2011-06-06T19:32:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	sudo cfdisk /dev/sdg
2011-06-06T19:33:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	try http://old-releases.ubuntu.com
2011-06-06T19:34:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	primary
2011-06-06T19:34:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	if you're happy with that
2011-06-06T19:35:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	yeshellothere	and i should write the partition table correct?
2011-06-06T19:36:00.000Z	yeshellothere	[THC]AcidRain	indeed if you want to create those partitions :)
