2007-03-22T15:18:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		any possible problem with having both the ALSA and OSS mixers installed at the same time?
2007-03-22T15:20:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	Not installed, but you're better off with aoss (alsa oss emulation)
2007-03-22T15:21:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	Oss and Alsa don't mix. But Oss programs  can use aoss to play thru' the alsa system.
2007-03-22T15:23:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		sigh....I'm about ready to give up on this
2007-03-22T15:23:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	What is your problem?
2007-03-22T15:23:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	I've had some experience with audio.
2007-03-22T15:24:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Shelagh	the specific problem is getting audio out of mplayer
2007-03-22T15:24:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	mm, what have you done so far?
2007-03-22T15:25:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Shelagh	I can watch, oh, a .wmv on my computer and it all works....then I go to www.imdb.com, click on a trailer I want to watch...the Cingular ad is fine, but when the trailer itself starts playing, I get no sound at all
2007-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		doesn't matter if it's .wmv, Real, or quicktime....no sound
2007-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	So sound in general is fine, just the movie off the internet?
2007-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	What format is the vid?
2007-03-22T15:27:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	could be a codec issue?
2007-03-22T15:28:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Shelagh	I've tried .wmv, Real Video, and Quicktime.....no sound on any of it
2007-03-22T15:28:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	Have you tried other players? Xine based? VLC?
2007-03-22T15:29:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	I've found that sometimes other players do the job better with different formats.
2007-03-22T15:29:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	'though these days mostly they're all pretty good.
2007-03-22T15:31:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Shelagh	well, since I'm lacking a better idea at present, I'll install VLC and see what happens
2007-03-22T15:31:00.000Z	Shelagh	Geoffrey2	Another one to try is realplayer. it is available thru [just a sec] , mm looks like its disappeared from the repositories.
