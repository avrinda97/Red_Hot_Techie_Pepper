2008-12-20T21:38:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	in your http.conf or equivalent it's an add_handler tag i believe
2008-12-20T21:39:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	correct, sorry httpd.conf but i think its a different name in ubuntu
2008-12-20T21:40:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	There is "text/html", now i tried application/octet-stream and the problem persists
2008-12-20T21:40:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	eh, sorry, there is text/plain
2008-12-20T21:41:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	is php installed?
2008-12-20T21:43:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	yes, of course. ...
2008-12-20T21:43:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	if its installed its a httpd.conf fix, but the real conf file used to be /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default.
2008-12-20T21:44:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	you'll need to look for it
2008-12-20T21:46:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	there is the config file, i copied it to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and the problem persists
2008-12-20T21:48:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	try this page https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/php5.html
2008-12-20T21:53:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	That does not help, I do not understand what is going on ...
2008-12-20T21:54:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	Wow. .. http://myhostname/index.php works. ...
2008-12-20T21:55:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	Interesting, I do not have any idea why /var/www/filename.php does not work
2008-12-20T21:57:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	your .conf file is not correct
2008-12-20T21:58:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	there is a httpd.conf or used to be but the real stuff is in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default if i recall correctly.
2008-12-20T21:59:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	/var/www/ is doc root, server root is /etc/apache2, just a note.
2008-12-20T21:59:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	probably, but i do not want to think about it, anyway, i am going to reinstall my system after very long time.
2008-12-20T21:59:00.000Z	jirik-1	LtL	thanks for you help :)
2008-12-20T22:00:00.000Z	LtL	jirik-1	sorry i dont remember more, but ive been there.
