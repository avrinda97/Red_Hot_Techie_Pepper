2008-11-29T01:59:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Sounds like a video driver problem.
2008-11-29T02:01:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Do you know which drivers you're using?
2008-11-29T02:02:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Go to System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2008-11-29T02:03:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Ack. That's... bad. Well, did the liveCD work well for you?
2008-11-29T02:04:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	I mean the Ubuntu live CD that you install from.
2008-11-29T02:05:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Download a live CD image, burn it to a CD, and then give it a shot.
2008-11-29T02:07:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	I don't know. I've never installed Ubuntu to a USB drive.
2008-11-29T02:09:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	The "proper driver" is entirely dependent on your system. For some, it will be the open source driver. For some, it will be fglrx. The liveCD uses the open driver by default. So if the liveCD works, that's what you need to be using. If it doesn't work, then... Well, you'll have to install the proprietary drivers from the command line.
2008-11-29T02:14:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	really? From your USB drive, you get THAT menu? O_o
2008-11-29T02:20:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Move fast enough so that tooltips don't appear? :P
2008-11-29T02:23:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	I have no idea on that one. I'm sorry. :(
2008-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Chaylon	Good luck!
