2006-05-26T07:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	have you tried the Ubuntu LiveCD ?
2006-05-26T07:36:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	that's the best place to start looking at linux. The performance will be alot slower than an actual install and things like your video resolution may need some post install tweeking.
2006-05-26T07:37:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	I would avoid the 64 bit version of Ubuntu
2006-05-26T07:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	you probably won't notice any difference between the 64bit and 32bit version unless you do alot of things like compiling software or encoding videos etc..
2006-05-26T07:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	alot of stuff like flash don't really work out of the box on 64
2006-05-26T07:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	it is harder to get working on 64bit Ubuntu
2006-05-26T07:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	your first experience with Ubuntu should be easy, I would recommend you install the 386 version
2006-05-26T07:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	I don't know about iTunes you'll have to search google for that I guess
2006-05-26T07:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Mr_GTi	reliability, ease of installing applications and system/security upgrades
