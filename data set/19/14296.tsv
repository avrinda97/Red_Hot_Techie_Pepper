2005-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	iphopper		i have a question about the live cd for PPC
2005-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	iphopper		k
2005-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	iphopper		the live cd boots fine on my g3 rev a imac.
2005-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	iphopper		and ir ead that ubuntu supports my performa, though it won't boot on it.  it's just accessible through macos
2005-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	iphopper		does the live disc just not support the older macs and only the installations do?
2005-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	iphopper		i read that for yellowdog
2005-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	iphopper		is it true of ubuntu as well?
2005-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	lamont_r	iphopper	colored G3 and later
2005-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	iphopper		damn.

2005-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	iphopper		i'm stuck with os 8.1 for now then?  boo.
2005-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	iphopper		i tried putting some flavor of BSD on there earlier, and it doesn't wanna boot that as well
2005-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	iphopper	cafuego	 this box came to me with just a 1 gig HD
2005-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	lamont_r	iphopper	rom-based firmware doesn't like to boot much from CDrom
2005-06-11T07:28:00.000Z	iphopper		i have no other scsi drives to put in it.
2005-06-11T07:28:00.000Z	iphopper		macos only takes 60MB?
2005-06-11T07:28:00.000Z	iphopper		8.1 is a bit larger than that i think.
2005-06-11T07:28:00.000Z	lamont_r	iphopper	I think someone was working on adding support for oldworld mac's, but that's not in hoary
