2009-07-15T23:02:00.000Z	n0gear	JBauer	how is it damaged?
2009-07-15T23:03:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	i think i wrote som data on outer volume
2009-07-15T23:03:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	And now it won't mount on linux
2009-07-15T23:03:00.000Z	n0gear		so u overwrote the hidden volume a bit?
2009-07-15T23:04:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	it says  mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2009-07-15T23:04:00.000Z	n0gear	JBauer	is it on linux or on windows partition?
2009-07-15T23:05:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	it's on NTFS. but i'm using linux now
2009-07-15T23:06:00.000Z	n0gear		ok. mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/*** /home*
2009-07-15T23:09:00.000Z	n0gear	JBauer	any luck?
2009-07-15T23:10:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	not really
2009-07-15T23:10:00.000Z	JBauer		tell me please, step by step...
2009-07-15T23:12:00.000Z	n0gear	JBauer	do u know which partition u need to mount to get it working?
2009-07-15T23:14:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	so i've mounted my hidden volume now, checking at Filesystem -> Do not mount. It shows the capacity of volume, algorithms used but can't access it
2009-07-15T23:18:00.000Z	n0gear	JBauer	sorry couldnt reproduce your problem :( Just ask again, hopefully someone else can help
2009-07-15T23:20:00.000Z	JBauer	n0gear	thanks a lot anyway. hope i'll get it in the end
