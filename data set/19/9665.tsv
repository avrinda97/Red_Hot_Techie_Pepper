2006-10-06T11:29:00.000Z	Ransom1		can anyone tell me what I need to do when an instruction shows I need to use (#) in the console?
2006-10-06T11:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	Use sudo: sudo <command>
2006-10-06T11:32:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	so just type sudo before the command?
2006-10-06T11:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	Yes
2006-10-06T11:33:00.000Z	ardchoille		!sudo
2006-10-06T11:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	But, be aware that the command will be running with root privs.
2006-10-06T11:34:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	I'm trying unsuccessfully to get my wireless running (a step by step following of the instructions doesn't work unfortunently...)   On section 3 it mentions "automatic daemon leading via modprobe"
2006-10-06T11:34:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	any idea what that is?
2006-10-06T11:34:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	another step or another way of loading drivers?
2006-10-06T11:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	No, I've never messed with wireless or drivers much
2006-10-06T11:35:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	rats.  Hard to learn linux without being able to research online...lol
2006-10-06T11:36:00.000Z	ardchoille		!wireless
2006-10-06T11:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	You see that?
2006-10-06T11:37:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	yeah I'll check.  So far I've gone through 3 how to's with no luck.  They all don't refer correctly to the files you download, and I'm not smart enough to know what subtle changes I need to make to make it work
2006-10-06T11:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	Try a search at http://ubuntuforums.org
2006-10-06T11:40:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	yeah I've been there trying to follow the step by steps all day.  No luck so far.  Thanks for trying though :)
2006-10-06T11:40:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	eventually I'll either figure it out or run into somebody who knows what I'm screwing up
2006-10-06T11:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ransom1	Yeah, that's one of the great things about Ubuntu.. there's always someone who can help you with anything :)
2006-10-06T11:41:00.000Z	Ransom1	ardchoille	yeah imagine how much easier it'll be to find when I can get internet working though...lol
