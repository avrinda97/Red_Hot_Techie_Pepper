2011-10-27T03:33:00.000Z	froq		anyone have a recommended sql GUI program for ubuntu?
2011-10-27T03:34:00.000Z	stercor	froq	depends on the db.
2011-10-27T03:34:00.000Z	stercor	froq	PostgreSQL: pgadmin3; mysql: I dunno.
2011-10-27T03:34:00.000Z	froq	stercor	why? (newbie to sql)
2011-10-27T03:35:00.000Z	froq	stercor	mysql is a GUI in its self
2011-10-27T03:35:00.000Z	stercor	froq	Each SQL server has its own syntax for statements, and the server needs to communicate with the client with a specific protocol.
2011-10-27T03:36:00.000Z	stercor	froq	I've not done MySQL in years, preferring PostgreSQL.
2011-10-27T03:37:00.000Z	stercor	froq	Oh, there are dialects of SQL used by the various vendors: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, ...
2011-10-27T03:38:00.000Z	stercor	froq	But the byte stream between the server and and client is different for each database.
2011-10-27T03:38:00.000Z	froq	stercor	o!  so some servers are better for transferring data over internet, etc.
2011-10-27T03:39:00.000Z	stercor	froq	Actually, it's the results of an SQL query that go out.
2011-10-27T03:42:00.000Z	stercor	froq	A nice little play toy to learn rudimentary SQL is SQLite.  But it's good enough that Mozilla uses it in Firefox.  It's in many applications, including phones.
2011-10-27T03:42:00.000Z	froq	stercor	well then that is what I want to learn! :)  I just want to dabble in databases.
2011-10-27T03:43:00.000Z	stercor	froq	SQLite is easy to set up, as opposed to other DBs.
2011-10-27T03:44:00.000Z	stercor	froq	http://www.sqlite.org/
2011-10-27T03:46:00.000Z	stercor	froq	The only thing that SQLite doesn't do well is when there are multiple clients going after the data.
2011-10-27T03:47:00.000Z	stercor	froq	Depends on how you export it.  You can export it as INSERT statements and it'll run on most databases.
2011-10-27T03:47:00.000Z	froq	stercor	cool!!! I just don't want to get into one database and then realize I would be better off with another.
2011-10-27T03:48:00.000Z	stercor	froq	That's the reason for exporting as INSERT statements.  You can go from one database to another easily.
