2008-12-30T16:33:00.000Z	NET||abuse		hmm, my wine registry doesn't have the key HKCU->Software->Wine->Direct3D which should then contain OffscreenRenderingMode,, it has up to Wine, why is this not available? or how do i try to fix the rendering problems in games?
2008-12-30T16:33:00.000Z	NET||abuse		anyone know any other good guides for this stuff?
2008-12-30T16:34:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	or #winehq
2009-05-19T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	hmm.. looks like the actual glyphs are not transparent.. only the space between.. is it the same regardless of which font you use?
2009-05-19T17:59:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	on the terminal, i changes from system font to monospaced, size and all, wouldn't fix it.
2009-05-19T18:00:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	hang.. let me try this on my computer.. see if it's the same
2009-05-19T18:00:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	i've noticed it happening in web pages on javascript animations also.
2009-05-19T18:01:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	my terminal doesn't look like that.. what version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-05-19T18:02:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	just updated to Jaunty today
2009-05-19T18:02:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	and you're running compiz? ie desktop effects?
2009-05-19T18:02:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	yeup
2009-05-19T18:04:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	it would be kind of interesting to know if a live cd has the same effect
2009-05-19T18:07:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	tried updating that? I think 180.44 is the current binary driver
2009-05-19T18:07:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	i think they have issues with .44, .11 works
2009-05-19T18:07:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	oh.. ok
2009-05-19T18:07:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	oh wait, i'm on 180.55 :)
2009-05-19T18:08:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	oh wait, i'm on 180.51,, arrrg, stupid keyboard.
2009-05-19T18:08:00.000Z	Slart	NET||abuse	hehe.. I don't really think the nvidia driver is responsible for drawing glyphs on the screen.. but it might be worth checking
2009-05-19T18:08:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Slart	i think there is a more up to date one, but people were giving out saying an earlier one was safer, so i stuck on that one, so that must be 180.51,
