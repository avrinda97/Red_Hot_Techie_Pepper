2011-09-17T22:20:00.000Z	warfaren		because it wont let me delete them
2011-09-17T22:20:00.000Z	warfaren		so now i have about 6GB unallocated space
2011-09-17T22:20:00.000Z	warfaren		now i would like to resize my ext4 partition that i'm currently running from
2011-09-17T22:21:00.000Z	warfaren		do i need to fire up my live cd? or can i set it to do it after a reboot or something?
2011-09-17T22:21:00.000Z	warfaren		i'm sure it does yeah
2011-09-17T22:22:00.000Z	warfaren		what's "swapoff"?
2011-09-17T22:22:00.000Z	warfaren		is that unmount swap partition?
2011-09-17T22:23:00.000Z	warfaren		ok
2011-09-17T22:23:00.000Z	warfaren		so how do i best run gparted without my system partition mounted?
2011-09-17T22:23:00.000Z	warfaren		live cd?
2011-09-17T22:24:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	yes
2011-09-17T22:24:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	what are you trying to do?
2011-09-17T22:25:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	yea should work fine
2011-09-17T22:26:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	i think so. it can be slow if partitions are before the / partition
2011-09-17T22:27:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	if it doesnt youll have to chroot in and change the grub config / fstab
2011-09-17T22:27:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	never tried what your doing myself
2011-09-17T22:36:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	directly after it?
2011-09-17T22:39:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	ubuntu should just pick it up
2011-09-17T22:40:00.000Z	gentoo-intel	warfaren	when you create a new partition gparted should have a swap option
