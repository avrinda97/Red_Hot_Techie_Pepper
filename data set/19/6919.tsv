2010-11-25T00:31:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	Not easily.  Your packaging kung-fu would need to be very strong.
2010-11-25T00:33:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	what tool should I be using ?
2010-11-25T00:33:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	Why do you want to rebundle chromium?  Doing this could be a few hours of packaging work.
2010-11-25T00:34:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	actually i want to rebundle amarok
2010-11-25T00:37:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	Why do you want to rebundle Amarok?
2010-11-25T00:40:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	i want to have it in one package so that i can use my previous packages of amarok.
2010-11-25T00:41:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	You'll have dependency hell.  It won't work.  A better solution would be to compile the older Amarok for whatever libraries you have on the target computer.
2010-11-25T00:42:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	  Find the DSC file for the older version of Amarok that you want, use `dget` on it, and then do a `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc`.   YMMV.
2010-11-25T00:45:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	i will try
2010-11-25T00:45:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	Welcome.
2010-11-25T00:51:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	sorry to bother u again, should i dpkg.
2010-11-25T00:51:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	should i use dpkg
2010-11-25T00:52:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	No.  You need the development tools to build software packages.   Things like devscripts, build-essential, debhelper.
2010-11-25T00:53:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	You'll probably need to go through the Debian packaging tutorial to get a working result.
2010-11-25T00:53:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	ok.
2010-11-25T00:55:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	i was thinking it will easy but doesn't seems to be.
2010-11-25T00:55:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	An alternative is to put your old software into a virtual machine.
2010-11-25T00:59:00.000Z	ranjan	dajhorn	if you please tell me how i m suppose to do that.
2010-11-25T00:59:00.000Z	dajhorn	ranjan	Do what?
