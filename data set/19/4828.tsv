2008-10-30T16:37:00.000Z	Stacy8282		I just had to install ubuntu again cause it wouldnt load up. Is there a way I can get to files that were on my old install?
2008-10-30T16:38:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	you probably selected "Entire Disk" during partitioning and nuked your old data
2008-10-30T16:38:00.000Z	Stacy8282	outbackwifi	- it was the "Guided" one I picked
2008-10-30T16:39:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	did it not format your existing partitions? then you are in luck
2008-10-30T16:40:00.000Z	Stacy8282	outbackwifi	- No I dont think so. It just put stuff back to default so I cant see the folders I had made in the old install. How do I see my old folders?
2008-10-30T16:40:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	you mount your old partitions and then browse to the mount point
2008-10-30T16:41:00.000Z	Stacy8282	outbackwifi	- Um. How do I do all that?
2008-10-30T16:41:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	sudo fdisk -l
2008-10-30T16:43:00.000Z	Stacy8282	outbackwifi	OK I have three things under the "Device Boot" column. Now what?
2008-10-30T16:44:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	you could paste that in paste.ubuntu.com
2008-10-30T16:45:00.000Z	Stacy8282	outbackwifi	- http://paste.ubuntu.com/64593/
2008-10-30T16:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	looks like your old data is in sda2
2008-10-30T16:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	sudo mkdir /mnt/sda2
2008-10-30T16:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2
2008-10-30T16:48:00.000Z	Stacy8282	outbackwifi	for the "sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2" it says "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
2008-10-30T16:49:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	strike that sda2 is your swap!!
2008-10-30T16:50:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	you seem to have nuked old data
2008-10-30T16:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Stacy8282	yw
