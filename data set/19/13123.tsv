2006-03-27T10:14:00.000Z	dman		well ubuntu is detecting my scsi card fine, but not the raided hdds on it
2006-03-27T10:15:00.000Z	anto9us	dman	I think you may need to put your /boot somewhere off the raid
2006-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	dman	anto9us	this is during the install.
2006-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	dman		the installer wont see my hdd
2006-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	dman		hdd(s)
2006-03-27T10:17:00.000Z	anto9us	dman	I've set ubuntu up on a scsi raid before, maybe the kernel doesn't recognise your host card, it needs a boot option perhaps
2006-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	dman	anto9us	dmesg shows it IS loading my host card
2006-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	anto9us	dman	have you set up a container with your hosts bios?
2006-03-27T10:19:00.000Z	dman		there is one 'logical' disk created
2006-03-27T10:19:00.000Z	dman		with my scsi card
2006-03-27T10:20:00.000Z	anto9us	dman	did you set it to check the container, did it complete it?
2006-03-27T10:22:00.000Z	dman	anto9us	what do you mean
2006-03-27T10:23:00.000Z	anto9us	dman	well, maybe your host card doesn't have this feature but it may need to verify the logical drive you've created, it may have a status field to indicate it
2006-03-27T10:24:00.000Z	dman		yeah
2006-03-27T10:24:00.000Z	dman		the logical drive is fine
2006-03-27T10:24:00.000Z	dman		hell the gentoo install can see it, as i tested before
2006-03-27T10:24:00.000Z	dman		but i need to use ubuntu in this situation
2006-03-27T10:25:00.000Z	dman		at this point it seems theres nothing i can do
2006-03-27T10:27:00.000Z	anto9us	dman	maybe this will help https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Raid?
