2005-07-22T11:00:00.000Z	Tattoo		yes i did
2005-07-22T11:01:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	you need to ask a more specific question than "make a module or something"
2005-07-22T11:15:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	try "modinfo wavelan_cs"
2005-07-22T11:15:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	wait.  That just tells you info about the module.
2005-07-22T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	just so you know.  lsmod to load it
2005-07-22T11:17:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	I'm out of my mind ;)
2005-07-22T11:21:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	calm down, man.  No need to talk about your own mom that way.
2005-07-22T11:23:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	please tone down the language, and calm down a bit as we try to assist you
2005-07-22T11:27:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	we've been trying to help you.  No need to insult those who have helped you.
2005-07-22T11:27:00.000Z	tritium	Tattoo	yes, several have tried.
