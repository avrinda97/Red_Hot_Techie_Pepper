2006-11-07T17:20:00.000Z	eobanb_		lancetw_, just do gnome failsafe session
2006-11-07T17:20:00.000Z	eobanb_		er, landexem
2006-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	That didn't work.
2006-11-07T17:23:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	can you describe the problem in more detail
2006-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	So I want to know where the config file is located that stores applications auto-starting in GNOME so I can change it in the console
2006-11-07T17:25:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	does the problem happen before you even log in, or does it happen as gnome is loading
2006-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	It happens as GNOME is loading
2006-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	you know how to set gdm to run a gnome failsafe session instead of the default session?
2006-11-07T17:27:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	I just tried that, but it still executed my script and crashed X11.
2006-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	The one that is supposed to launch XGL/Compiz
2006-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	...and that would be a question for #ubuntu-xgl
2006-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	No, it's not.
2006-11-07T17:32:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	sigh.  yes, it is.  all xgl-related questions should go to #ubuntu-xgl.
2006-11-07T17:32:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	i'll be happy to help you over there.
2006-11-07T17:32:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	This isn't an XGL question because all I want is to disable a script I told to startup with GNOME.
2006-11-07T17:33:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	but it's the script to start Xgl, yes?
2006-11-07T17:33:00.000Z	landexem	eobanb_	But thanks for the offer on helping out with XGL after I disable this script
2006-11-07T17:43:00.000Z	eobanb_	landexem	the gnome failsafe session.  i know you're still talking about xgl and compiz, so please ask in #ubuntu-xgl about it
