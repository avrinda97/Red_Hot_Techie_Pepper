2012-08-19T12:09:00.000Z	stephans		hi everybody! I have a strange effect on ubuntu (on a 2009 mac mini with Nvidia): http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=J1OqqQ8hBXk&vq=medium      this video has a blueshift when played in firefox.
2012-08-19T12:09:00.000Z	stephans		wierd!
2012-08-19T12:10:00.000Z	stephans		now it plays with no blueshift in chrome, but then it sputters and stutters
2012-08-19T12:10:00.000Z	stephans		does anyone have an explanation for this?
2012-08-19T12:11:00.000Z	Fishscene	stephans	You have adobe flash and gstreamer plugins installed and up to date?
2012-08-19T12:12:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	yes. the restricted extras are installed and all updates applied
2012-08-19T12:13:00.000Z	Fishscene	stephans	It almost sounds like hardware accelleration for video playback isn't enabled or is too underpowered to handle the video. Are other videos played back successfully? Even HD videos?
2012-08-19T12:14:00.000Z	stephans		regular mkv files or avi files on the hard drive play fine... even plays ok in minitube
2012-08-19T12:14:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	regular mkv files or avi files on the hard drive play fine... even plays ok in minitube
2012-08-19T12:15:00.000Z	stephans		by the way everything played great on when booted in to OSX
2012-08-19T12:15:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	how do I enable hardware acceleration for the nvidia drivers?
2012-08-19T12:16:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	you may be right on the no acceleration for video... because the cpu does run high when flash video is played...
2012-08-19T12:19:00.000Z	Fishscene	stephans	I was trying to see if I could play the video with youtube's HTML5 video player, but I'm not having success.  Do you have proprietary drivers enabled/installed?
2012-08-19T12:19:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	tried with vlc and it plays fine... yes the nvidia drivers are installed.
2012-08-19T12:20:00.000Z	Fishscene		Sounds like a flash/browser issue then. I'm at a loss as to where to go from here. =\
2012-08-19T12:20:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	I tried to enable prefer html5 but could not figure out how...
2012-08-19T12:21:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	ok I will google some more..
2012-08-19T12:29:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	 I enabled "Override automatic cache management" on firefox. it worked
2012-08-19T12:29:00.000Z	stephans	Fishscene	 that was it
