2012-07-30T15:52:00.000Z	orf_		i'm having a weird issue with DNS lookups: i can nslookup an address and it comes back with the right IP but I can't ping it - it just says the host is not found
2012-07-30T15:52:00.000Z	orf_		tom@toms-ubuntu:~$ nslookup workflow.local
2012-07-30T15:52:00.000Z	orf_		Name: workflow.local
2012-07-30T15:52:00.000Z	orf_		Address: 172.16.10.250
2012-07-30T15:52:00.000Z	orf_		tom@toms-ubuntu:~$ ping workflow.local
2012-07-30T15:52:00.000Z	orf_		ping: unknown host workflow.local
2012-07-30T15:53:00.000Z	orf_		what the heck is going on - nslookup can resolve it but ping/traceroute cant?
2012-07-30T15:55:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	is there an entry for it in /etc/hosts?
2012-07-30T15:55:00.000Z	orf_	violinappren	workflow.local is the DNS server, so it should get resolved fine without needing to edit /etc/hosts?
2012-07-30T15:57:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	pastebin the output of: dig workflow.local
2012-07-30T15:57:00.000Z	orf_	violinappren	; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> workflow.local
2012-07-30T15:58:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	use paste.ubuntu.com
2012-07-30T15:59:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	whats the output of: host workflow.local
2012-07-30T16:00:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	and yet ping doesnt work?
2012-07-30T16:01:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	sounds like another case of the resolveconf daemon  screwing things up ..
2012-07-30T16:02:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	it wasnt break if you have your resolv.conf right (static or dhcp)
2012-07-30T16:04:00.000Z	orf_	violinappren	do you happen to know the package name of resolveconfd?
2012-07-30T16:04:00.000Z	violinappren	orf_	resolvconf
2012-07-30T16:10:00.000Z	orf_	violinappren	apt cant find that package it seems
