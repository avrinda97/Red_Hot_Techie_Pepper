2008-05-05T06:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]	xomp	fortunately I have two ther well supported wifi devices, so this was something I wasn't stressed over
2008-05-05T06:45:00.000Z	xomp	zcat[1]	was my problem out of box lol
2008-05-05T06:45:00.000Z	xomp	zcat[1]	i can see ever network known to man but can't get a ip addy
2008-05-09T00:48:00.000Z	zcat[1]	xomp	get something based on the rt2400 chipset, they work perfectly.
2008-05-09T00:49:00.000Z	xomp	zcat[1]	do you have a link to one of them? I will buy it right this moment lol
2008-05-09T00:51:00.000Z	xomp	zcat[1]	I need a wifi card that not only works 100% in linux, but one that will allow me to packet inject and the such. Do you know of any?
2008-05-09T00:51:00.000Z	zcat[1]	xomp	best thing to do is take your laptop in with you, plug in a few cards, buy the one that works. Or if you're shopping for a laptop, take the ubuntu live CD with you and make sure everything works..
2008-05-09T00:51:00.000Z	zcat[1]	xomp	for packet injection and stuff, take the backtrack2 live CD in to test them :)
2008-05-09T00:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	xomp	BTW; I have found cases where a wifi card with an IDENTICAL model number actually comes in two different versions.. my SMC is an example.. the one I got has the well supported rt2400 chip.. there's a different version with  the same model number which uses a completely different (unsupported) chipset.
2008-05-09T00:55:00.000Z	xomp	zcat[1]	yeah, I figured as much when i was researching myself lol. that's why I'm sticking with windows for wifi and linux for wired now heh
2008-05-09T00:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	xomp	I got lucky.. the first (cheapest) card I bought turned out to have excellent support. I got given a well supported USB adapter. And I got given a laptop with one of the better-supported broadcom chipsets.
