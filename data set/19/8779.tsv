2007-03-15T06:23:00.000Z	jfanaian		I'm having an issue with my laptop. I can't get internet. I can get in the network, I can ping other machines in the network, other people's and everything but I can't get internet. It worked fine yesterday, just not today. Could someone help me figure out why? :( I'm using nm-applet on a wireless network.
2007-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	what happened between yesterday and today?
2007-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	Nothing really, I didn't do anything last night other than play World of Warcraft on it
2007-03-15T06:25:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	I didn't mess with any of the configuration whatsoever last night.. yesterday I was messing with my sound configuration but thats a whole different problem
2007-03-15T06:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	are you on a static ip or dhcp?
2007-03-15T06:25:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	DHCP
2007-03-15T06:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	do you have the right gateway and dns information?
2007-03-15T06:25:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	Let me check
2007-03-15T06:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	check the applet for your network card's settings, or ifconfig from the cli
2007-03-15T06:26:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	Ah, I see the default gateway is 192.168.1.1 but its supposed to be .7
2007-03-15T06:26:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	How could I change that?
2007-03-15T06:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	try refreshing your connection (turn off the wifi adapter, then turn it back on, then renew your dhcp lease)
2007-03-15T06:27:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	Alrighty :)
2007-03-15T06:28:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	No it still has .1 :(
2007-03-15T06:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	set the ip information manually.
2007-03-15T06:31:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	I was trying to look if it could be done from ifconfig but I could only find how to change my IP address and how to change the broadcast address, not the default gateway
2007-03-15T06:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jfanaian	man interfaces ;)
2007-03-15T06:33:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	I can't change that file, it will break nm-applet
2007-03-15T06:38:00.000Z	jfanaian	fyrestrtr	Is there any other alterantive than modifying the interfaces file?
