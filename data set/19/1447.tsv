2012-01-28T10:45:00.000Z	agu10^		anyways, I can't boot into ubuntu
2012-01-28T10:45:00.000Z	agu10^		I'm on windows... yea windows always works
2012-01-28T10:47:00.000Z	agu10^		I added subsection display 1920x1938
2012-01-28T10:47:00.000Z	agu10^		or something like that... so that it would let me use the proper resolution
2012-01-28T10:47:00.000Z	agu10^		which for some reason (bug) it wouldn't let me
2012-01-28T10:48:00.000Z	agu10^		</sarcasm>
2012-01-28T10:49:00.000Z	agu10^		the only reason I need to edit xorg.conf is that ubuntu won't work properly out of the box
2012-01-28T10:50:00.000Z	agu10^		oh well it probably is
2012-01-28T10:50:00.000Z	agu10^		before i updated drivers (installed amd's), they were working at proper resolution
2012-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	agu10^		!info xrandr
2012-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	Blue1	agu10^	you didn't install the driver from the site, did you?
2012-01-28T10:51:00.000Z	agu10^	Blue1	no
2012-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	Blue1	agu10^	sometimes the way forward, it to go back and do it correctly. -- (my experience)
2012-01-28T10:57:00.000Z	agu10^	Blue1	because they only use gedit and i bet they don't even have the proper screen resolution
2012-01-28T10:58:00.000Z	Blue1	agu10^	everything works -- email, browsing, dvd playing, music --
2012-01-28T10:58:00.000Z	agu10^	Blue1	everything works // barely works
2012-01-28T10:59:00.000Z	agu10^	Blue1	okay... those stories are complete bullshit. Ubuntu does *NOT* run out of the box except maybe for a single computer or system configuration which happened to be the one somebody at canonical tested
2012-01-28T11:00:00.000Z	Blue1	agu10^	whatever
2012-01-28T11:01:00.000Z	agu10^	Blue1	there hasn't been any ubuntu installation where I didn't have to manually edit xorg.conf
