2012-06-09T19:43:00.000Z	Seveas	ForgeAus	well, that won't work as long as apt is wedged
2012-06-09T19:44:00.000Z	ForgeAus	Seveas	wedged?
2012-06-09T19:44:00.000Z	ForgeAus		yes xubuntu
2012-06-09T19:44:00.000Z	ForgeAus		but its not necessarily a good idea
2012-06-09T19:44:00.000Z	Seveas	ForgeAus	scroll up and read deitarion's problem :)
2012-06-09T19:44:00.000Z	ForgeAus		you can do that with a chroot environment for example
2012-06-09T19:44:00.000Z	Seveas		I call that wedged
2012-06-09T19:45:00.000Z	ForgeAus	Seveas	does he have broken packages?
2012-06-09T19:46:00.000Z	Seveas	ForgeAus	dunno, that's why I asked him to pastebin
2012-06-09T19:46:00.000Z	Seveas		Troubleshooting 101: the more info, the better. Don't guess
2012-06-09T19:47:00.000Z	ForgeAus		shouldn't he do a sudo dpkg --configure -a  (I think thats the line something like that ... )
2012-06-09T19:47:00.000Z	Seveas	ForgeAus	it all depends on what state apt is in.
2012-06-09T19:47:00.000Z	Seveas		(not a bad suggestion though)
2012-06-09T19:47:00.000Z	ForgeAus		ok you seem to have it in hand :)
2012-06-09T19:48:00.000Z	ForgeAus		I can see how its kinda frustrating coming from Gentoo though
2012-06-09T19:48:00.000Z	ForgeAus		not that I have much experience with gentoo beyond a prefix here or there
2012-06-09T19:48:00.000Z	ForgeAus		but I did get a taste of portage that way  :) ...
2012-06-09T19:49:00.000Z	Seveas		I have enough experience with gentoo to say "never again" :)
2012-06-09T19:49:00.000Z	ForgeAus	Seveas	my current kubuntu has a prefix :) so I can't go there with you I'm afraid :)
