2009-09-02T23:55:00.000Z	guntbert	lenswipe	Halitech: startx won't work via ssh
2009-09-02T23:56:00.000Z	lenswipe	guntbert	i used the command export DISPLAY=:0 to run the command on the local display..
2009-09-02T23:57:00.000Z	guntbert	lenswipe	still startx will not work AFAIK, try with simple apps for a starter (try xeyes)
2009-09-02T23:58:00.000Z	lenswipe	guntbert	huh? how can i try xeyes if x isnt running?
2009-09-02T23:59:00.000Z	guntbert	lenswipe	remotely you won't see anything that is displayed on the local display
2009-09-02T23:59:00.000Z	lenswipe	guntbert	right.
2009-09-03T00:01:00.000Z	guntbert	lenswipe	I didn't follow your discussion - that was just a "quick step in" - I think Halitech is on his way with you - so I shall not "take over" - feel free to ask me though
2009-11-12T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	lenswipe	please behave
