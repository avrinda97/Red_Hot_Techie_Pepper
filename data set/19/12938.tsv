2005-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	i think it's partitioning is easier than windows xp...
2005-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	I think so too, but partitioning can be scary to newbies :)
2005-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	especially since most do not know they have to create a swap partition :)
2005-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	yeah, but most people using windows just tell it to take over the drive, i don't think a windows xp user would be comfortable splitting a partition to have separate data/os drives, and it has an option to do a desktop install instead of manual...
2005-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	indeed :)
2005-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	please tell people about sudo before telling them to set a rootpassword
2005-06-14T11:29:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	sorry bout that, had never read that before, interesting...
2005-06-14T11:30:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	so should i refrain telling people to just sudo bash as well?
2005-06-14T11:31:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	sudo -i is the way to get a root login shell :)
2005-06-14T11:31:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	ah, i was reading that, never used it before, that works...
2005-06-14T11:33:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	maybe you can help me then, I have two locations i have joined with an ipsec vpn, it works fine, but the firewall kills it, you know what rules i need in my firewall script to allow ipsec?
2005-06-14T11:34:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	if your firewall does nat or alters your packages, you're screwed
2005-06-14T11:36:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	there is an x in the password field
2005-06-14T11:36:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	ok, thats cool
2005-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	they aren't :)
2005-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	your answers probly better than mine, i would've said vi /etc/apt/sources.list ;-)
2005-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	:)
2005-09-15T16:53:00.000Z	disasm	Seveas	whats sudo -i do differently than sudo bash?
2005-09-15T16:53:00.000Z	Seveas	disasm	read the manpage for sudoers :)
