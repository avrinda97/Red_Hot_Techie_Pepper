2010-06-30T20:33:00.000Z	DarkStar1		Quick question, does the c-shell still exist in ubuntu?
2010-06-30T20:35:00.000Z	DarkStar1		no one knows?
2010-06-30T20:35:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkStar1	csh? then yes it does
2010-06-30T20:36:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	Hhmm... the command "which bash" works but not "which csh"
2010-06-30T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkStar1	got it installed yet?
2010-06-30T20:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	Aaahh didn't know it'd become an optional package
2010-06-30T20:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	thanks
2010-06-30T20:38:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	lol, there's even a C# shell?? Ever tried it?
2010-06-30T20:39:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkStar1	no, didn't know about it
2010-06-30T20:39:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	showed up on my csh search in synaptic
2010-07-09T22:21:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkStar1	something like devede ?
2010-07-09T22:30:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	can't alt+F2
2010-07-09T22:22:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	Will that do something similar to ConvertXtoDVD?
2010-07-09T22:23:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkStar1	not familiar with that app, it takes various movie files and converts them so you can burn to dvd and watch on a conventional dvd player
2010-07-09T22:23:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	I need to convert a few AVI files to play on the DvD player
2010-07-09T22:24:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	Ok Thanks I'll look into it now
2010-07-09T22:28:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	 I just installed devede from the repos but can't see it anywhere on the system menus. Anyway of bringing it on?
2010-07-09T22:29:00.000Z	bazhang	DarkStar1	should be in sound and video folder try alt-f2 devede
2010-07-10T01:51:00.000Z	DarkStar1	bazhang	Hey.. Just out of curiosity have you used this devede program before?
