2011-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	riffautae		go8765: your router is the likely culpret
2011-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	riffautae		go8765: or even the modem
2011-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	what does mean "culpret" ?
2011-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	the thing that has the open port. its probably what is responsible for your issue
2011-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	also i spelled it wrong
2011-11-02T00:06:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	sorry... english not my native - can you simply explain - is this pors my or provider?
2011-11-02T00:07:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	you probably have a device at your house that directs internet from your provider into your computers, that is what may have open ports
2011-11-02T00:09:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	now I use dial-up internet - about what devise you said ? :)
2011-11-02T00:10:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	oh i see, then if you have iptables or some firewall set up then it is likely your provider causing the ports to be open
2011-11-02T00:13:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	so its possible - when I scan ports in online servese - in results see ports of some_device/provider_machine what I use to go in internet ?
2011-11-02T00:13:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	yes if your isp is a jerk that might happen
2011-11-02T00:16:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	I (and google translate) dont understand what does mean "jerk" :) can you explain plese?
2011-11-02T00:17:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	haha it was a joke, I just meant that they were mean to do that
2011-11-02T00:19:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	so... its to hard for me anyway undertand - is this my ports was open or not...
2011-11-02T00:19:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	yes that is why
2011-11-02T00:22:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	sorry... that is why - what? I cant translate it correct... what you mean? is this ports my or provider ? how I can understand this?
2011-11-02T00:22:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	I think it is your provider
2011-11-02T00:25:00.000Z	go8765	riffautae	thanks! спасибо :)
2011-11-02T00:26:00.000Z	riffautae	go8765	your welcome
