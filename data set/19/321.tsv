2012-05-20T17:53:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Hey! Is there any database for ubuntu users on getting the right nvidia drivers installed?
2012-05-20T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 i thought nvidia-current sort of scanned and installed what it thought was needed.
2012-05-20T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 detailas as to what happens exactly is more helpfull
2012-05-20T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 the x gui to nvidia is 'nvidia-settings'
2012-05-20T18:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	Yes, I get it open, but tells me  "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. "
2012-05-20T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 so... you are not using the nvidia drivers.
2012-05-20T18:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	 "Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server."
2012-05-20T18:05:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	Well, I haven't... as I asked in the beginning, I wondered if there is a sound database webpage for getting the right driver installed
2012-05-20T18:06:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	?
2012-05-20T18:06:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	Hmm, well I guess I'll try that:) Brb
2012-05-20T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 thats all ive ever needed to do for like all 10 of my nvidia machines.. ;)
2012-05-20T18:23:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	Still no change with the nvidia-settings installed..
2012-05-20T18:24:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	When I run it now it still tells me "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver."
2012-05-23T21:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 'turns a second' ? you mean the RPM?
2012-06-19T12:57:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	thanks willis:P

2012-06-19T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sirriffsalot	 rootkits exist.. not really seen any active/live viruses for ubuntu/linux
2012-06-19T13:55:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Dr_Willis	I know, but might as well get it don't you think?:D
