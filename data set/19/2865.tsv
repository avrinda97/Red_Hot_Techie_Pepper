2009-12-14T08:50:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	i will be starting it that way very often, whenever i boot my computer up so - that when when i'm not here i can ssh into the same irssi session
2009-12-14T08:57:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	i answered you; did you read it?
2009-12-14T08:57:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	yes, didn't you read my reply?
2009-12-14T08:57:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	i think you replied when my internet connection was down
2009-12-14T08:57:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	i will be starting it that way very often, whenever i boot my computer up so - that when when i'm not here i can ssh into the same irssi session
2009-12-14T08:58:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	also, so when i come home from work i can resume an irssi session i started on my home box remotely
2009-12-14T08:58:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	why not just leave your computer on all the time?
2009-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	there are probably commands you can add to .screenrc so it runs them automatically every time you start screen
2009-12-14T09:02:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	i don't want it run everytime, just the time that i use the command which is a launcher in my applications menu
2009-12-14T09:11:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	man screen
2009-12-14T09:11:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	it's not in the man, i've read it
2009-12-14T09:13:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	no you didn't.  -d -r will reattach your screen, which is presumably already running your application
2009-12-14T09:15:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	screen -c file (where file contains your commands to run)
2009-12-14T09:16:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	excuse me? are you telling me i don't know what -dR does? i have explained this to you twice now - it's to detach it if necessary and then re-attach - irssi may or may not be running in an invisible screen, the concept is not all that complicated.
2009-12-14T09:20:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	i am telling you how your application will get executed within the screen you create as opposed to in a new terminal.  if it's not what you want to do, you need to redefine what you want do to
2009-12-14T09:23:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	i want it created in the screen, not a new terminal.
2009-12-14T09:34:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	laeg	i told you how to do it.  educate yourself a little
2009-12-14T09:40:00.000Z	laeg	LizardK|ng	you should try understanding people's questions before you refer them away from the channel or try to fob them off saying their needs are unnessary before giving an answer which is not even what they asked in the first place.
