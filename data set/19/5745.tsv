2008-06-06T19:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	langleyo	open a terminal and run: sudo apt-get install -f
2008-06-06T19:23:00.000Z	langleyo		looks like it
2008-06-06T19:26:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	 ok i did that...
2008-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	 i get this: wammu' This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'wammu' the conflicting software must be removed first.
2008-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	langleyo		Switch to the 'synaptic' package manager to resolve this conflict.
2008-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	langleyo	the conflicting package name should be displayed also...
2008-06-06T19:29:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	but i dont know whats conflicting.....you see everything im seeing
2008-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	any clue please?
2008-06-06T19:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	langleyo	do you get that error when executing the apt-get install -f ?
2008-06-06T19:32:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	lemme try
2008-06-06T19:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	langleyo	you can use: apt-cache show ammu , it will display the package conflits
2008-06-06T19:33:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	thanks trying
2008-06-06T19:36:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	 ok i looked at cache option: only shows info, no conflicts
2008-06-06T19:36:00.000Z	joaopinto		it should show conflicts, near the Depends:
2008-06-06T19:37:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	 and install instruction shows zero results
2008-06-06T19:38:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	its showing no conflicts...thats what gets me ..
2008-06-06T19:38:00.000Z	joaopinto		ok, i am out of ideas
2008-06-06T19:38:00.000Z	langleyo	joaopinto	thanks anyway
