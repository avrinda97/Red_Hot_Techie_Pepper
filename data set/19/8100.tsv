2007-12-10T20:46:00.000Z	reya276		Is anyone having trouble with Rhythmbox? for some reason my keeps freezing when it changes to a different song on a playlist or when I listen to one song and then manually start to play another
2007-12-10T20:47:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	where are these songs located ? on your local disk ?
2007-12-10T20:47:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	on my music folder
2007-12-10T20:48:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	try reloading the library... sometimes it happened to me when i had songs from windows partition folder and it wasn't mounted... though im not sure that this is the case
2007-12-10T20:50:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	how do I reload the list?
2007-12-10T20:53:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	try music ---> import folder,   try importing your music folder again
2007-12-10T20:55:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	Ok thanks
2007-12-10T20:56:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	np, there is a good player called "listen" too, which is like rhythmbox style
2007-12-10T20:58:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	hye do you know if I can change the skin on rhythmbox, I don't mean through the theme manager
2007-12-10T20:59:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	you mean only for rhythmbox ?
2007-12-10T20:59:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	Yes
2007-12-10T21:01:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	have you searched the repos ?
2007-12-10T21:02:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	for rhythmbox skins ?
2007-12-10T21:02:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	seems there aren't in the repos
2007-12-10T21:06:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	No I don't it's helping, I even removed it completely and then re-installed it.
2007-12-10T21:06:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	your music folder doesn't load ?
2007-12-10T21:32:00.000Z	reya276	juano__	no it loads, but I meant that it is not working
2007-12-10T22:38:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	what plugins did you install ? what files are you trying to play ? mp3s ?
2007-12-10T22:43:00.000Z	juano__	reya276	mm this is weird, you wanna check out this for plugins though:
