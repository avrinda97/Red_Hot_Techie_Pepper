2005-07-24T06:17:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	well you are wrong by a long shot....they give the advice away for free so no one else can make any money.
2005-07-24T06:18:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	but the chip manufacturers like IBM, Intel, AMD, Sun, SGI, and a few others make billions of dollars off of linux
2005-07-24T06:18:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	it is just that you cannot.
2005-07-24T06:21:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	if you want to see who is making the money go look at all the chip manufacturers supported by Debian
2005-07-24T06:21:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	they support more than anybody
2005-07-24T06:21:00.000Z	poutine	bojangles	I have no doubt billion dollar companies are making billions more off of free software, it's more the "ordinary person" category I worry about
2005-07-24T06:22:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	well...the ordinary person can always start up a multibillion dollar fab and compete....nobody stops them
2005-07-24T06:22:00.000Z	poutine	bojangles	If you really think that, you're in fantasyland
2005-07-24T06:27:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	it is not fantasy land....recently a newcomer to linux is making some ARM chips for special purpose devices.
2005-07-24T06:27:00.000Z	poutine	bojangles	with no starting capital from proprietary designs?
2005-07-24T06:28:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	you are free to go get billions of dollars and then open your own fab and compete if you can.
2005-07-24T06:28:00.000Z	poutine	bojangles	market share + capital
2005-07-24T06:28:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	well the ARM chips don't have a big picture outlook they are focusing on a niche market
2005-07-24T06:29:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	but that is what they want to do.
2005-07-24T06:29:00.000Z	poutine	bojangles	how do you figure? Do you know how many embedded devices are powered by ARM chips?
2005-07-24T06:46:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	i don't want you to think the people are discriminating or anything.....but you cannot make a dime because you were not rich to begin with....but whose fault is that.
2005-07-24T06:47:00.000Z	poutine	bojangles	I have no problems making money, but I'm telling you, it wouldn't have been possible with the GPL
2005-07-24T06:54:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	you should have picked different parents when you were born...like Bill Gates did or Sam Walton....if you had picked Sam Walton as your father you could have $18billion dollars for nothing to open your own fab
2005-07-24T07:17:00.000Z	bojangles	poutine	and also another niche market player is the E12K processor which tries to be useful in the scientific markets....so you have proof this is not fantasy land
