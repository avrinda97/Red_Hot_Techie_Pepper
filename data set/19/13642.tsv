2005-12-03T17:18:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	l as in language
2005-12-03T17:19:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	How many users have you created?
2005-12-03T17:21:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	Is the current user you are logged in as the first user created during login process?
2005-12-03T17:22:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	What admin task do you want to accomplish?
2005-12-03T17:25:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	Which password are you typing?
2005-12-03T17:27:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	Ok. Just do this once. 'less /etc/sudoers |grep username' Insert current username in place of username.
2005-12-03T17:29:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	Please do as I said regarding that /etc/sudoers file
2005-12-03T17:30:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	Then first 'slocate sudoers' and then use that path. This is somewhat tidious, but I don't remember exact path to that file
2005-12-03T17:33:00.000Z	onkarshinde	JBBA	Most probably the user in which you have logged in doesn't have admin privileges. So log in to another user you have, assign admin privileges to this user and then delete another user. (kind of confused, isn't it;-))
