2006-05-27T10:04:00.000Z	tobmoox		does ubuntu have a second support channel?  it seems like this one is way too crowded right now for me to find help
2006-05-27T10:06:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	there's a support in a number of different languages, and there's #ubuntu+1 for dapper discussions.  That said, you're much more likely to get reasonable support if there's a crowd than if there's a dearth
2006-05-27T10:06:00.000Z	Managu		!sound
2006-05-27T10:07:00.000Z	tobmoox		so..does anyone have any ideas on how to solve this then?
2006-05-27T10:07:00.000Z	Managu		!patience
2006-05-27T10:08:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	is there some particular reason you feel like debootstrapping an install?
2006-05-27T10:08:00.000Z	tobmoox		im not sure what debootstrapping is, Managu
2006-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	you're installing from the install disk?
2006-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	tobmoox	Managu	it gave me that error during installation.  yes on the install disc
2006-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	rather, booting and installing from the install disk?
2006-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	tobmoox	Managu	it gave that error during base system installation
2006-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	tobmoox	Managu	which is booting and installing from the install disc, yes
2006-05-27T10:09:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	My first though would be to run a check to be sure your system is reading the CD properly (and that there aren't any burn errors)
2006-05-27T10:10:00.000Z	Managu		s/though/thought/
2006-05-27T10:10:00.000Z	Managu		!tell erick about es
2006-05-27T10:10:00.000Z	tobmoox	Managu	i burnt to an imation, but i'll try another cd brand.
2006-05-27T10:11:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	another burn might help, aye.  But what I was suggesting was to run the built in cd-check; there should be an option right as you're booting the install CD to check for errors
2006-05-27T10:12:00.000Z	tobmoox	Managu	how do you run the built in cd-check after booting?
2006-05-27T10:13:00.000Z	Managu	tobmoox	I can't hand-hold you through that, as it's been too long since I dealt with a 5.10 install disk.  I'd suggest reading everything, looking for "advanced" or "more options" at the very beginning
