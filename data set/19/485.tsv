2012-04-22T11:22:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	did you check the documentation for ddclient? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS
2012-04-22T11:24:00.000Z	JermBob	cwill747	yup no freedns protocol
2012-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	yeah i see what you mean
2012-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	no protocol
2012-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	check out http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Dynamic_DNS#freedns.afraid.org
2012-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	JermBob	cwill747	tempting to change my dns name just because most of the applications made are for other dns providers.
2012-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	they have an example at the bottom for config
2012-04-22T11:26:00.000Z	JermBob	cwill747	yeah i used that example and it just errors
2012-04-22T11:27:00.000Z	JermBob	cwill747	the latest apt-get gets ?
2012-04-22T11:29:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	3.8.1 fixes some freedns problems
2012-04-22T11:29:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	"* Fixing #28: FreeDNS.afraid.org changed api slightly"
2012-04-22T11:30:00.000Z	JermBob	cwill747	why isnt apt-get getting the latest version then
2012-04-22T11:30:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	apt repos aren't always up to the latest stable version
2012-04-22T11:30:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	You might want to grab the latest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddclient/
2012-04-22T11:31:00.000Z	JermBob	cwill747	just in the process now
2012-04-22T11:31:00.000Z	cwill747	JermBob	you might have to compile it yourself, i have no idea
