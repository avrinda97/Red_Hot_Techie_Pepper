2007-01-25T14:26:00.000Z	mrpurple		i'm getting an error wrong architecture i386
2007-01-25T14:26:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	what kinda computer are you installing to?
2007-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	did you install 32bit or 64bit OS?
2007-01-25T14:29:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 then you just need to enable the right repositories in your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2007-01-25T14:29:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 then become root by typing sudo -s
2007-01-25T14:30:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 and then you can aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
2007-01-25T14:31:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 there's graphical interface, but as long as you can type...it's better to learn the linux filesystem anyway
2007-01-25T14:33:00.000Z	mrpurple	grndslm	i did that command
2007-01-25T14:36:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 now you can delete everything in that file and copy this sources.list file by highlighting it and then pasting it by middle clicking into the text editor!!
2007-01-25T14:39:00.000Z	mrpurple	grndslm	i did it
2007-01-25T14:40:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 now type in:  aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
2007-01-25T14:40:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 and then aptitude skype when it's done
2007-01-25T14:42:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 no, you copy the sources.list file from here first ( http://pastebin.ca/328453 ) by highlighting the text and then paste it into the terminal with a middle click
2007-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	mrpurple	grndslm	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavail able)
2007-01-25T15:04:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 you have synaptic or the add/remove program open?
2007-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 either you have multiple packaging programs open or you're not root!!
2007-01-25T15:15:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 twinview or xinerama will get dual monitors working
2007-01-25T15:16:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 google twinview and see if you can edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file with nano
2007-01-25T15:17:00.000Z	grndslm	mrpurple	 then hit ctrl+alt+backspace to restart the graphical interface
