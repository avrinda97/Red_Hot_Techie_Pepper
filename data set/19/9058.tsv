2007-01-03T16:12:00.000Z	Toran		How can I make my many-buttoned mouse's extra buttons work in a game such as Enemey Territory?
2007-01-03T16:12:00.000Z	xtknight	Toran	you may have to map the mouse buttons to keys and then bind the keys under ET
2007-01-03T16:12:00.000Z	xtknight	Toran	as to how to map them to keys, i have no idea but theres a logitec hguide
2007-01-03T16:13:00.000Z	Toran		woops, sorry, didn't mean to PM, xtknight
2007-01-03T16:13:00.000Z	Toran		I don't know why it doesn't work
2007-01-03T16:13:00.000Z	Toran		I think the game gets its input differently than, say, my desktop
2007-01-03T16:13:00.000Z	xtknight	Toran	um so when you press one of the extra keys at the desktop in a text box what happens
2007-01-03T16:13:00.000Z	Toran	xtknight	It puts the text in
2007-01-03T16:13:00.000Z	xtknight	Toran	yet when u bind it in ET it doesn't work?
2007-01-03T16:14:00.000Z	Toran		That is correct
2007-01-03T16:14:00.000Z	Toran		it doesn't bind it to anything
2007-01-03T16:14:00.000Z	Toran		ET doesn't think any button's been pushed
2007-01-03T16:14:00.000Z	xtknight	Toran	odd.  what happens if you pull down the console in ET and then pres it
2007-01-03T16:14:00.000Z	Toran		Didn't try that
2007-01-03T16:15:00.000Z	Toran		At any rate, I don't want those mouse buttons bound to keys when I'm not in the gam
2007-01-03T16:15:00.000Z	Toran		e
2007-01-03T16:15:00.000Z	Toran		and ET won't sense modifier+key combinations
2007-01-03T16:15:00.000Z	Toran		much less single-letter ones
2007-01-03T16:15:00.000Z	xtknight	Toran	yeah, well i have no clue.  you could map the buttons to something beyond ASCII
