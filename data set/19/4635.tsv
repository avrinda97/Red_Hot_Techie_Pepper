2010-05-03T06:16:00.000Z	Surlent777	onetinsoldier	It works, but it's not perfect. You're gonna want to find rain20.zip on the internet and use it, and find Display Doctor to get a decent resolution
2010-05-03T06:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	oh... roger. thanks for the heads up!
2010-05-03T06:17:00.000Z	Surlent777	onetinsoldier	I did it recently so I could play Lego Island =P
2010-05-03T06:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	roger. i was kind of thinking of playing a little bit of an old, and would now be considered pretty simplistic, rts game called Dune 2000 by Westwood Studios ;-)

2010-05-03T06:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	hey. i tried installing Dune 2000 a few weeks ago with Wine in the 10.04 Beta. it bombed out. thought i'd try it again now. dang! it alsmot had me thinking it was going to work! it siad can't find necessary files and please run setup.exe from the CD, which is exactly what i was doing, lol. but the install screen came up no problem!
2010-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	what's that file you said i
2010-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	Surlent777	onetinsoldier	rain20.zip, also Display Doctor 7 Beta
2010-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	what's that file you said i'd need to get again? not the display doctor. but the other file?
2010-05-03T06:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	roger. thanks. Dune 2000 just installed, then i updated it to v1.06, then ran it and it ran and played the intro movie, then hung. damn, so close with wine, but no cigar. i now have a <defunct> process, lol
2010-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	Surlent777	onetinsoldier	did you try to tell it to run in Win98 mode, etc?
2010-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	Surlent777	onetinsoldier	also try googling/looking at the WineHQ wiki thing
2010-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	no.. i'll try that. but winecfg won't fireup just yet. trying to kill -9 the processes
2010-05-03T06:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	ok, set to Win98 mode. going to try again now. thanks for your help :)
2010-05-03T06:51:00.000Z	Surlent777	onetinsoldier	not a problem. I'm a big old-school gamer myself =D
2010-05-03T06:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Surlent777	roger :-) i'm not big on old games really. but once in a while their nice
