2009-08-26T18:30:00.000Z	tread		Hi all.  My external hdd worked fine until today, but now when I plug it in, nothing happens.  I can see it through GPartEd, but with a warning icon (exclamation point in yellow triangle) next to it.  Right-click>Properties, and the warning is: "Unable to read the contents of this file system! Because of this some operations may be unavailable."  Can anyone help me with the goal of recovering the data on this drive?
2009-08-26T18:30:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	what format is the drive in?
2009-08-26T18:30:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	ntfs
2009-08-26T18:31:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	was it unmounted properly?
2009-08-26T18:31:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	I'm running Ubuntu 9.04, which ships with ntfs3g, and it has never had a problem reading this drive before.
2009-08-26T18:31:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	it's possible that it was unmounted improperly once or twice.
2009-08-26T18:32:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	if its been unmounted improperly it will usually lock the file system so you can't damage it further
2009-08-26T18:33:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	even windows can't see it?
2009-08-26T18:33:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	It can see the drive, but can't mount it.
2009-08-26T18:33:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	sounds like the drive may be toast
2009-08-26T18:34:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	Mac OSX is based on Darwin which is a BSD fork
2009-08-26T18:35:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	you can try the freezer trick
2009-08-26T18:37:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	just plugged in the drive again to my Ubuntu box and it mounted it.. hmm.
2009-08-26T18:37:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	but sometimes Nautilus gives me an error when I try to list a directory.
2009-08-26T18:38:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	sounds like the drive is dying, UBCD has some tools to test drives
2009-08-26T18:40:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	well since it's mounting now, I'd like to try to backup as much data as it will let me immediately?  Is there a better app for me to use than dd at the cli?
2009-08-26T18:40:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	dd will copy everything including empty blocks, might be better off using clonezilla or just copying things with nautilu
2009-08-26T18:41:00.000Z	tread	Halitech	Ah, thanks.  Will clonezilla know how to deal with bad blocks (retry them, skip them?) or will the first one cause the whole backup to fail?
2009-08-26T18:42:00.000Z	Halitech	tread	not sure,  I havent used it
