2007-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	Vince_		I'm having problums installing UBUNTU.  I've tried installing Breazy, Dapper, and the current version.
2007-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	Vince_		If I try to install the newest version, I get an error that says "/bin/sh can't access tty; job control disabled"
2007-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	Vince_		If I try to install Dapper, it tells me that it cannot mount the CD.  Even though its already loaded and running.
2007-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	Vince_		If I try and install Breazy it installs to the point where it asks me to configure my user account and then all it does is ask me over and over agian and will not progress any further.
2007-03-11T12:37:00.000Z	Vince_		Can somebody help me get one of these versions installed?  I'd like to end up with Dapper if possible.  Also please read the whole issue as I keep having people only read part of it and then spend time trying to help me fix the wrong issue for the wrong install.
2007-03-11T12:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vince_	don't mess with breezy, out of date
2007-03-11T12:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vince_	 it has nothing tod o with helping/not helping.. but alot of breezy repos are closed, if you manage to get it installed, you'll be pissed off when you can't install anything.
