2005-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	_the_1_		a few months ago someone helpful here told me the command and I used it to enable the bytecode interpreter on my warthy
2005-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	_the_1_		however, I forgot it and I just installed hoary
2005-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	_the_1_		I might be wrong, but it was something like fontconfig-something

2005-03-06T17:21:00.000Z	_the_1_		people used to be more helpful last time I was around...hope #ubuntu doesn't become #debian in the near future...:(
2005-03-06T17:22:00.000Z	_the_1_		anyway...there could be that #ubuntu will become #debian, since ubuntu IS debian!
