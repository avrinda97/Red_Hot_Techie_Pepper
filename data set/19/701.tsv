2011-10-13T22:56:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	It retrieves the list of all running processes, and only prints lines starting with "dpkg"
2011-10-13T22:57:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	wow thanks, my ubuntu software center got stucked twice and I like a fool did a reboot but than read on internet about that command and killing the process
2011-10-13T22:58:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	No problem :)

2011-10-13T23:02:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ is good - hold on while I get a few more links
2011-10-13T23:04:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	thanks man I will check it out
2011-10-13T23:04:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	Here's a few more links: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html, and http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/ (the official reference manual, a bit dry though)
2011-10-13T23:05:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	thats a lot of link thanks :D :D :D
2011-10-13T23:05:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	You can find even more on Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)
2011-10-13T23:07:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	one quick question though can I ask?
2011-10-13T23:07:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	Sure :)
2011-10-13T23:08:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	many times when I use terminal for installing application with the apt-get command am somehow not able to write the exact name of the package and it returns Package not found, is there a way to use any wildcard? like ' sudo apt-get install *vlc*
2011-10-13T23:11:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	Yes - pressing Tab expands the package name. However, if what you've written is *not* the start of the name of the package you want to install, Tab won't work. In those cases, using "apt-cache search <query>" is a better option
2011-10-13T23:12:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	whooot :D
2011-10-13T23:13:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	Anytime :)
2011-10-13T23:22:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	one thing that I found weird on 11.10 is if I'm using nautilus with gksu whatever folder I copy paste it sticks with them root rights, :(
2011-10-13T23:24:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	suhel	That actually makes sense - Nautilus is running as the root user, so naturally when you move a file or folder around, Nautilus attempts to transfer the rights of whatever it's copying/moving to the user Nautilus is running as, in this case, root
2011-10-13T23:24:00.000Z	suhel	DangerOnTheRangr	I'll chew your head tomorrow :p thanks for all the help :)
