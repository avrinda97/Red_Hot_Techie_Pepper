2008-04-28T09:43:00.000Z	DanaG		Utter bull.
2008-04-28T09:44:00.000Z	DanaG		If it worked "perfectly" -- it'd do surround.
2008-04-28T09:44:00.000Z	DanaG		It doesn't give surround sound!
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		Hardware?
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		Or audio file?
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		I'm just looking in the volume control, and in the log output.
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		W: alsa-util.c: Device hw:1 doesn't support 6 channels, changed to 2.
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		W: alsa-util.c: Device hw:1 doesn't support sample format float32le, changed to s16le.
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		Audigy2 does not do 24-bit audio in Linux.  Ripoff.
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	DanaG		And PulseAudio refuses to do surround with it.
2008-04-28T09:46:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	Audigy2 doesn't do 24 bit anywhere
2008-04-28T09:46:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	It inter/extrapolates 24-bit streams to/from 16 bit, just like Audigy 1
2008-04-28T09:47:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	Linux is being honest with you, Windows isn't
2008-04-28T09:47:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	The DSP in Audigy 1 and 2 is only 16 bit. When you feed it a 24 bit stream it has to up/downconvert it in order to be able to work with it
2008-04-28T09:47:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	It is and Creative were successfully sued over it
2008-04-28T09:48:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	The case wasn't in the US, it was the UK as I recall
2008-04-28T09:50:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	you may as well just use your mobos onboard sound if you're going to do that
2008-05-09T08:25:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	It's not Flash's fault.
2008-05-09T08:27:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	DanaG	ALSA has had this problem for years and there's simply no excuse for it
