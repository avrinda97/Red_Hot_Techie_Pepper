2008-11-22T07:34:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	Intrepid
2008-11-22T07:35:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	nothing, dont know where to start
2008-11-22T07:36:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	ifdown: interface wlan0 not configured
2008-11-22T07:38:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	sudo ifdown wlan0?
2008-11-22T07:39:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	so can you help me trace whats happening?
2008-11-22T07:43:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	I think it does, but cant be sure
2008-11-22T07:44:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	there is a special application used to share things
2008-11-22T07:44:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	using dav protocoll and it tells me an IP
2008-11-22T07:46:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	yep, I tried to ping my Iphone from the laptop but I get no response
2008-11-22T07:47:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	thats very strange as im almost sure, they are connected
2008-11-22T07:47:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	I mean, I can see theconection in my Iphone, if I get away the strength diminishes and all that stuff
2008-11-22T07:51:00.000Z	n8tuser	yaser	thats why i asked you first if the ipod has an ip address..otherwise it will not be able to share an internet access
2008-11-22T07:53:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	well it has an IP address, assigned trough DHCP, I could, if I want, put on the wireless connection in the Iphone a static IP, but I dont know exactly what meaning it would have
2008-11-22T07:55:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	I create in my Ubuntu laptop a new wireless connection, then in the Iphone I see that connection and press the buton, connect to it
2008-11-22T07:55:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	the wireless connection in the ubuntu laptop is set to "sharing mode"
2008-11-22T07:56:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	ad-hoc connection, dont know what is AP
2008-11-22T07:56:00.000Z	n8tuser	yaser	where is the iphone getting its ip address from?
2008-11-22T07:57:00.000Z	yaser	n8tuser	I dont know exactly, I think I have a dhcp erver installed, may be from that
