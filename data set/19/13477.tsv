2005-05-09T08:50:00.000Z	snader	gub	have you edited your xorg.conf to load Composite, and do you run xcompmgr?
2005-05-09T08:51:00.000Z	gub	snader	yes but xcompmgr doesn't work : No damage extension
2005-05-09T08:51:00.000Z	snader	gub	you use hoary?

2005-05-09T08:52:00.000Z	snader		damage extension should be loaded automagically
2005-05-09T08:53:00.000Z	snader	gub	does your /var/log/Xorg.0.log have any (EE) lines?
2005-05-09T08:54:00.000Z	gub	snader	none but warnings : DRI initialization failed! ...
2005-05-09T08:55:00.000Z	gub		only when composite is enabled
2005-05-09T08:55:00.000Z	snader	gub	hm, i don't know if that has to do with it
2005-05-09T08:55:00.000Z	snader	gub	does it say "(II) Initializing built-in extension DAMAGE" ?
2005-05-09T08:56:00.000Z	gub	snader	ya : Extension "DAMAGE" is enabled ... Initializing built-in extension DAMAGE
