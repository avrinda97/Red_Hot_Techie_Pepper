2008-10-15T22:37:00.000Z	LuYu		is firefox 3.0 really faster?  or is it slower?
2008-10-15T22:37:00.000Z	LuYu		i have two users telling me it seems slower
2008-10-15T22:37:00.000Z	LuYu		i didnt really notice myself
2008-10-15T22:37:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	than Fx 2?
2008-10-15T22:40:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	I think you need some more specific complaints :)
2008-10-15T22:41:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	sounds like an add-on problem to me
2008-10-15T22:42:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	irc.mozilla.org/#firefox
2008-10-15T22:43:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	key word "might" but it's definately something work trying
2008-10-15T22:43:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	is that using gnome-system-monitor?
2008-10-15T22:44:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	try using top instead - I find that gnome-system-monitor uses a load of CPU (I think it's from drawing the graphs) or you can reduce the interval it updates the data at
2008-10-15T22:47:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	exit gnome-system-monitor, open a terminal and run top, then see how much cpu your computers uses when idle
2008-10-15T22:50:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	in the 3rd row it shows Cps(s) %us is used and %id is idle
2008-10-15T22:52:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	no I think linux just has lots of processes going on which aren't actually doing anything
2008-10-15T22:53:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	definately shouldn't be using that much - try uninstalling some add-ons
2008-10-15T22:56:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	I wouldn't have thought language packs would be a problem, but maybe.
2008-10-15T22:56:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	does your homepage use any plugins?
2008-10-15T22:56:00.000Z	Justcameron	LuYu	http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox+consumes+a+lot+of+CPU+resources
2008-10-15T23:01:00.000Z	LuYu	Justcameron	that page seems to suggest that all the plugins be up to date
2008-10-15T23:01:00.000Z	LuYu	Justcameron	i dont think that is an option
