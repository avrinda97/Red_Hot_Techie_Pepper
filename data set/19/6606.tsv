2008-04-04T02:31:00.000Z	nixnoob		why do any full screen games cause my machine to hard reboot?
2008-04-04T02:32:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	what gfx card / drvier
2008-04-04T02:33:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	geforce 9600GT the new proprietary driver 171.06
2008-04-04T02:34:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	perhaps launch the game from terminal and check you logs
2008-04-04T02:34:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	i check the logs in /var/log/ but theres nothing there the system just restarts as if i press the button on the case.
2008-04-04T02:35:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	weird to hard restart and not just restart X.  is it all games?
2008-04-04T02:35:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	so far any game under wine that uses 3d and nexuiz too
2008-04-04T02:36:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	not a native game then? might be a bug with wine and your card /driver. report it
2008-04-04T02:36:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	nexuiz is native
2008-04-04T02:36:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	I can _Never_ get NExuiz to work in linux! lol
2008-04-04T02:37:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	im going to try it with tremulous now and see if it happens, if it does then im pretty sure its a driver problem, it may be interesting to note that im using a dual display as well.
2008-04-04T02:38:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	compiz running i presume too?
2008-04-04T02:39:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	yes but it was never a problem on my lappy with a geforce 8600 i could run all games winie or otherwise fullscreen and compiz no problems
2008-04-04T02:39:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	this is what make's linux not for the faint-hearted.  hardware is always varying
2008-04-04T02:40:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	i kno ive found an archived thread which discusses the same problem it seems to be an issue with xorg and dual monitors with fullscreen games,
2008-04-04T02:41:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	there you go.. are you using xinerrama?
2008-04-04T02:41:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	no one reports hard reboots but i guess anything is possible
2008-04-04T02:41:00.000Z	nixnoob	keit1	twinview
2008-04-04T02:41:00.000Z	keit1	nixnoob	well i'm sure it will be addressed at some point ;)
