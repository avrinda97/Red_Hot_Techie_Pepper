2009-10-29T22:04:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	why in gods name are you trying to run an exe file?
2009-10-29T22:05:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	darthanubis	that is what it tries to update/download
2009-10-29T22:05:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	you want msffonts?
2009-10-29T22:06:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	darthanubis	well it seems that playonlinux needs them
2009-10-29T22:07:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	msffonts are in the repos. You will get them by installing the ubuntu-restricted-extras package
2009-10-29T22:08:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	never try to run .exes this aint windows
2009-10-29T22:08:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	darthanubis	i know :P but this it what the synaptic tries to download
2009-10-29T22:09:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	let synaptic do what it wants
2009-10-29T22:09:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	get back to me when you've followed the previous instructions I gave you?
2009-10-29T22:10:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	darthanubis	did a apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras trying it now, but it is slow because the old mscorefonts installer allways tries to download it.
2009-10-29T22:11:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	darthanubis	gonna remove it from the catch and try again
2009-10-29T22:37:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	darthanubis	fixed it wget http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/project/corefonts/the%20fonts/final/andale32.exe
2009-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	darthanubis	_CommandeR_	I don't even want to know why or how;)
