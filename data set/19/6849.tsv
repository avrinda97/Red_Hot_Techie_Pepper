2007-12-01T12:50:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	network-manager
2007-12-01T12:50:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	Its already installed in feisty you'd have to upgrade the package to the gutsy version.  I wouldn't really recomend that.
2007-12-01T12:51:00.000Z	[cd]	h1st0	the problem i am on 56k (modem) thats why i cant
2007-12-01T12:51:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	No I'm saying you would have to upgrade that package and a few others to the gutsy version is that what you are trying to accomplish?
2007-12-01T12:52:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	also you can order ubuntu cds for free on their site.  The Ship it program.
2007-12-01T12:52:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	So you need an app that will scan for APs and allow connetion easier.  hold up.
2007-12-01T12:52:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	wifi radar?
2007-12-01T12:53:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	http://wifi-radar.systemimager.org/
2007-12-01T12:53:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	sudo apt-get install wifi-radar
2007-12-01T12:53:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	it should be int he repos
2007-12-01T12:54:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	well maybe you should ask the gentoo people.
2007-12-01T12:57:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	its in the repos I don't know why you'd even bother messing with it.  Or why you'd even bother with allthe differenct package mangers.
2007-12-01T12:57:00.000Z	h1st0	[cd]	since you aren't really gaining anything from it.
