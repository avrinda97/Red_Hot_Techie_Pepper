2008-01-03T23:16:00.000Z	jakel1		or do i just type find?
2008-01-03T23:18:00.000Z	jakel1		that just tells me where grub is installed
2008-01-03T23:19:00.000Z	jakel1		not where windows is
2008-01-03T23:19:00.000Z	jakel1		i am trying to add windows to the boot loader
2008-01-03T23:20:00.000Z	jakel1		fdisk -l does not list anything
2008-01-03T23:20:00.000Z	jakel1		just returns a new command line
2008-01-03T23:20:00.000Z	jakel1		ah ok,,,
2008-01-03T23:21:00.000Z	jakel1		i see... but it doesn't distinguish whether it is hd0,0 or hd0,1
2008-01-03T23:21:00.000Z	jakel1		that's what i need to determine
2008-01-03T23:22:00.000Z	jakel1		i have windows and linux installed on the same drive, but i need to add windows to the bootloader
2008-01-03T23:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jakel1	 if windows is on hda1, theres a example entry in the menu.lst for it - you can just uncomment.
2008-01-03T23:22:00.000Z	jakel1		windows is on /dev/sda2
2008-01-03T23:23:00.000Z	jakel1		Dr_willis:
2008-01-03T23:23:00.000Z	jakel1		alsamixer in command line xamox
2008-01-03T23:24:00.000Z	jakel1		gnome-look.org
2008-01-03T23:24:00.000Z	jakel1		jason_ gnome-look.org
2008-01-03T23:24:00.000Z	jakel1	Dr_willis	windows is on /dev/sda2
2008-01-03T23:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jakel1	 so? :) you will need to change the example entry then I guess. with the right hd##
2008-01-03T23:25:00.000Z	jakel1	Dr_willis	yes but i dnt know what the correct hd#,# is that is what i need to know
