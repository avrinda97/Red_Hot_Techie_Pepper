2009-08-02T20:41:00.000Z	dare		why not install the debian from the adobe flash website?
2009-08-02T20:41:00.000Z	dare		package*
2009-08-02T20:42:00.000Z	dare		yes, binary packages to install
2009-08-02T20:44:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	regarding that link to adobe - they don't have a 64 bit installer, do I need to install from source?
2009-08-02T20:44:00.000Z	dare	d0s4gw	there is no 64bit flash
2009-08-02T20:45:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	So how would those of us with 64 bit machines run flash?
2009-08-02T20:45:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	btw, this is somewhat baffling, but youtube works and all others (hulu) do not

2009-08-02T20:49:00.000Z	dare	d0s4gw	do you see 'get adobe flash player' ?
2009-08-02T20:50:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	No, it appeared for a moment then disappeared and now it's just the black box where the video should be.  If I right click the video then it actually says that the flash video is playing.
2009-08-02T20:50:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	I think I have flash installed but not installed correctly.
2009-08-02T20:51:00.000Z	dare	d0s4gw	try this http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/install-flash-10-ubuntu-linux-64bit.html
2009-08-02T20:52:00.000Z	dare	d0s4gw	are you using firefox? which version does it show in tools->addons->plugins?
2009-08-02T20:54:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	I just ran that script from the link and it completely removed all flash packages... it didn't reinstall them properly so now no flash works
2009-08-02T20:54:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	however, now I get the "Install flash plugin" in the video box
2009-08-02T20:54:00.000Z	dare	d0s4gw	you are running 64-bit ?
2009-08-02T20:54:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	yes, using firefox
2009-08-02T20:54:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	yes
2009-08-02T20:58:00.000Z	d0s4gw	dare	Nicely done, fully functional flash now.  Thanks very much
