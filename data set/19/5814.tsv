2008-05-07T05:37:00.000Z	_2	fde	i guess that's an invitation to leave.        fair enough.
2008-12-21T14:48:00.000Z	_2	fde	when did ubuntu-restricted-extras appear in the repos ?
2008-12-21T14:48:00.000Z	fde	_2	umm, around breezy?
2008-12-21T14:49:00.000Z	_2	fde	breezy was 6.10 ?
2008-12-21T14:49:00.000Z	fde	_2	more like 5.04
2008-12-21T14:49:00.000Z	_2	fde	interesting i don't have that package in dapper 6.6
2008-12-21T14:49:00.000Z	fde	_2	isn't dapper EOL?
2008-12-21T14:50:00.000Z	_2	fde	no it's LTS
2008-12-21T14:50:00.000Z	fde	_2	oh, so there is no way to convince you to upgrade to at least hardy? Ubuntu has made a lot of strides since back then
2008-12-21T14:52:00.000Z	_2	fde	i was only wondering when the package appeared seeing that i don't have it.   i'm not having but the one issue, as i posted earlier  can't find message bus   but no one answered
2008-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	fde	_2	I'm just saying, dapper is OLD... you might as well be using Windows 98 compared to where Linux is 3 years later
2008-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	_2	fde	i think i might prefer to be
2008-12-21T14:56:00.000Z	_2	fde	i mean, i don't really like the dirrection it's moving, so why try to keep up?  i still use primarily the console and don't want any machine to do anything that i don't specificly tell it to.
2008-12-21T14:57:00.000Z	fde	_2	The direction its going? its open source... just start out with a server installer and don't install what you don't want?
2008-12-21T14:58:00.000Z	_2	fde	and hardy would be an improvement over dapper in what way if i do what you said ???
2008-12-21T14:58:00.000Z	_2	fde	see my point ?
2008-12-21T14:59:00.000Z	fde	_2	name it... performance, hardware support, etc etc
2008-12-21T15:02:00.000Z	_2	fde	heh, all my hardware is fully supported under dapper, or as fully as it is under any later version; to get one gfx card supported i would have to revert to something with a 2.4 kernel.   as per performance.   are you saying that the 2.6.18 kernel will outperforme the 2.6.15 ?   or was that a refferance to upstart -vs- sysV ?
