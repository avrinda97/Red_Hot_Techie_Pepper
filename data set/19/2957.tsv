2009-11-18T23:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 i use  apt-cacher-ng  to let my main machine cache the packages to the rest of the lan. but its not a complete repository.
2009-11-18T23:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 no idea. Ive never bothered to do that. :)
2009-11-18T23:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 vlc/mplayer can play dvd iso files , and 'directories' of the contents and .vob files - You still may need the decss stuff installed
2009-11-18T23:18:00.000Z	sahilsk_	Dr_Willis	: what basically apt-cacher-ng.  do? could you please elaborate it. i am googling too.
2009-11-18T23:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 one machine serves as the 'cache' all box's get their updates/packages from it first.. and if it dosent have it.. it gets it and adds it to the cache so the rest of the lan dont have to get it from the internet.
2009-11-18T23:22:00.000Z	sahilsk_	Dr_Willis	:  if i installed all the packages in one machine , then no mahcine on the intra net need to be connected to the internet to get it installed.  do you have more such possible solutions. apt-cacher-ng : make a cache of installed packages or of the downloaded pacakges?sorry, novice .here...
2009-11-18T23:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 you are not going to insall 'every single package thats in the repos' on one box :)
2009-11-18T23:24:00.000Z	sahilsk_	Dr_Willis	: i have too . Bcoz i need to make the lab totally isolated from the intranet, runnning on ubuntu. And ubuntu demands internet. so , cant i installed all the necessary pacakges all at once in the main machine ? what are its flaws?
2009-11-18T23:25:00.000Z	sahilsk_	Dr_Willis	:sorrry , itś  *internet. isolated from internet
2009-11-18T23:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 if you can figure out what exactly you will ever need to install. you can install what you need.. but for example theres several apternatives to java.. so what one are you going to use? you dont want/need to install the ones you dont need.
2009-11-18T23:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 theres proberly some guide out on mirroring  the repositories.
2009-11-18T23:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sahilsk_	 ubuntu dosent really demand internet. :) it just makes it so much easier. :)
2009-11-18T23:28:00.000Z	sahilsk_	Dr_Willis	: thanks a lot. last question . how to save this chat log with colored highlightings??
2009-11-19T00:23:00.000Z	sahilsk_	Dr_Willis	what is the command for entring PATH in the bashrc permanently. I use PATH=$PATH: path/to/my/directory/. but i need to type it everytime i boot in.
