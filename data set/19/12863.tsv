2007-02-28T15:43:00.000Z	SCanzt1		hi - amarok doesnt work, it claims that there is another program preventing it to work!!!
2007-02-28T15:43:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	are you in GNOME?
2007-02-28T15:44:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	this may sound terrible, but go to the control panel turn off 'software mixing'
2007-02-28T15:44:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	then run 'killall esd' in a terminal
2007-02-28T15:45:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	'esd', which should be going away soon, is famous for blocking the soundcard when it doesn't have a hardware mixer
2007-02-28T15:45:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	and Linux/ALSA does a better job of mixing in any case
2007-02-28T15:46:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	try it again
2007-02-28T15:47:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	oh? That's strange
2007-02-28T15:48:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	what do you have running right now?
2007-02-28T15:48:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	that's it?
2007-02-28T15:48:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	firefox?
2007-02-28T15:48:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	yeah, there is a tweak for that
2007-02-28T15:49:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	fiesty is supposed to fix alot of the sound retardation
2007-02-28T15:49:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	but as of now, pulse isn't integrated
2007-02-28T15:49:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	in any case, close firefox, restart amarok
2007-02-28T15:49:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	and tell me what's in /etc/firefox/firefoxrc
2007-02-28T15:52:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	sorry 'bout all this
2007-02-28T15:54:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	did you retry amarok?
2007-02-28T15:55:00.000Z	KrakensDen	SCanzt1	I doubt it. Amarok works pretty beautifully :P
