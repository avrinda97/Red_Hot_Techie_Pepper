2008-12-28T06:22:00.000Z	markus		yes please. i am a newbie on ubuntu. i think i installed the wrong flash player, the wrong drivers and everything.   all i can do great is surfing in the net...
2008-12-28T06:22:00.000Z	markus		i dont even know if i installed a 32 bit or a 64 bit version of ubuntu... :-(
2008-12-28T06:23:00.000Z	markus		next week i ll buy the windows xp and everything is ok
2008-12-28T06:24:00.000Z	markus		i have 4 gb ddr2 ram. but i cannot use it, coz i have no idea with the ubuntu drivers, flashplayers and stuff...
2008-12-28T06:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	markus	 most all that tuff has not been an issue for me under 64bit..
2008-12-28T06:25:00.000Z	markus		where did u get the 64  bit version dr_willis
2008-12-28T06:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	markus	 the ubuntu download pages have links to 64bit ubuntu
2008-12-28T06:26:00.000Z	markus	dr_willis	and you have no problems then to find the right drivers and stuff?
2008-12-28T06:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	markus	 thats what i just said... :)
2008-12-28T06:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	markus	 the only 'issue' ive seen with it - is that zsnes has no 64bit port. :)
2008-12-28T06:27:00.000Z	markus	dr_willis	can the 64bit version find the hardware automaticly?
2008-12-28T06:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	markus	 i cant tell the diff on my 64bit machines vs 32bit machines.. for the most part.. the drivers/stuff all works the same.
2008-12-28T06:28:00.000Z	markus	dr_willis	i ll try this. and if its ok, u are my god.
