2005-09-26T10:34:00.000Z	gregoria		maybe I cant you the SCSI as the primary drive. Maybe I must reinstall on the SATA and use that as my root filesystem. Could this be correct
2005-09-26T10:36:00.000Z	gregoria		apt-get install mplayer
2005-09-26T10:36:00.000Z	gregoria		sudo apt-get install mplayer
2005-09-26T10:37:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	there is no mplayer....i need something to add to sources.list
2005-09-26T10:37:00.000Z	gregoria		oh well then get the address of your nearest ftp server
2005-09-26T10:38:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	and how do i find the nearest ftp server that has mplayer packaged for breezy?
2005-09-26T10:38:00.000Z	gpm		no
2005-09-26T10:39:00.000Z	gpm		it doesn't show up when i apt-cache search for it
2005-09-26T10:40:00.000Z	gregoria		well most universitys here archive all the latest linux software and distros
2005-09-26T10:41:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	could you be a little more specific as to HOW i would find such a server?
2005-09-26T10:42:00.000Z	gregoria		gpm:try deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy -updates main restricted
2005-09-26T10:43:00.000Z	gregoria		and then the same line under that with deb-src
2005-09-26T10:44:00.000Z	gregoria	gpm	You should set up apt correctly and then it will be easy to get whatever stuff u want
2005-09-26T10:44:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	i am trying to set up apt
2005-09-26T10:45:00.000Z	gregoria	gpm	yes I know, i was just suggesting you put what I posted into sources.list rather than what boxerboy said (directing you to mplayer site)
2005-09-26T10:46:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	i already have an archive.ubuntu.org line in sources.list
2005-09-26T10:46:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	i don't think ubuntu packages mplayer officially. i need an external source
2005-09-26T10:47:00.000Z	gregoria		ok maybe, have you sucessfully downloaded stuff with apt b4
2005-09-26T10:50:00.000Z	gpm	gregoria	yeah
