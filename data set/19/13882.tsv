2004-12-24T11:52:00.000Z	khadyoung		Well, I can't boot FC3
2004-12-24T11:53:00.000Z	khadyoung		Does Ubuntu not support ext3?
2004-12-24T11:53:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	sure it does... im sure most people in here run ext3
2004-12-24T11:53:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	i have 5 or so partitions with ext3
2004-12-24T11:54:00.000Z	khadyoung		I can't boot into my FC3 install
2004-12-24T11:54:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	thats not an ubuntu problem... thats a grub problem
2004-12-24T11:54:00.000Z	khadyoung		I can't even mount the FC3 partition in Ubuntu, though?
2004-12-24T11:54:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	what happens when you try to mount it?
2004-12-24T11:55:00.000Z	khadyoung	GotD0t	something about filesystem error
2004-12-24T11:55:00.000Z	khadyoung	GotD0t	that's why I asked about ext3
2004-12-24T11:55:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	please supply the exact error
2004-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	khadyoung		mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb2,
2004-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	khadyoung		       or too many mounted file systems
2004-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	what mount options are you using
2004-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	khadyoung	GotD0t	mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb2 /mnt/fedora
2004-12-24T11:58:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	does /mnt/fedora exist?
2004-12-24T11:58:00.000Z	khadyoung	GotD0t	Yep
2004-12-24T11:59:00.000Z	GotD0t	khadyoung	are you sure of two things... is it located on /dev/hdb and is it actuallyn an ext3 fs?
2004-12-24T11:59:00.000Z	khadyoung	GotD0t	I am pretty sure I resized /dev/hdb2 to make room for hdb3 when I installed Ubuntu. Could the Ubuntu installer have messed up the partition when it resized it?
