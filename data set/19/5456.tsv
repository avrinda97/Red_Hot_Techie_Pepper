2009-03-20T21:38:00.000Z	skippycostin		I am running ubuntu 8.10 and cannot ping any local FQDN, I can ping any machine and I get back my IP and the FQDN in the ping output
2009-03-20T21:38:00.000Z	skippycostin		I cannot ping my FQDN it times out.  any clues?
2009-03-20T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	do you have other network connection problems, or just with icmp?
2009-03-20T21:41:00.000Z	skippycostin		just ping I haven't tested anything else
2009-03-20T21:43:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	a couple of possibilities: 1) the machines are configured to ignore pings, and drop them silently, leaving you with a timeout (not very likely) 2) you have a bad routing table (view it with "/sbin/route -n"), and you need to set a route to the network that you wish to reach.
2009-03-20T21:45:00.000Z	skippycostin		I can ping the machine just not the FQDN
2009-03-20T21:45:00.000Z	skippycostin		so it's not routing issues right?
2009-03-20T21:45:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	in that case, it's probably a dns issue
2009-03-20T21:46:00.000Z	skippycostin	sipior	any idea how one might fix it?
2009-03-20T21:46:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	if by "ping the machine", you mean "ping the ip address, instead of the name".
2009-03-20T21:46:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	yes, you can contact the guy who administers your local dns :-)
2009-03-20T21:47:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	an easy way to tell: try "dig <hostname>", and see what comes back.
2009-03-20T21:47:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	install "dnsutils" if you don't have dig.
2009-03-20T21:47:00.000Z	skippycostin	sipior	pinging the ip and hostname work, just not the fqdn..
2009-03-20T21:48:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	then what does dig say about the fqdn?
2009-03-20T21:48:00.000Z	skippycostin	sipior	where do you want me to paste the result?
2009-03-20T21:49:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	whichever pastebin you like, but i need to be gone in about three minutes, so you'll need to ask someone else to take a look :-)
2009-03-20T21:49:00.000Z	skippycostin		oh ok thanks for the help
2009-03-20T21:49:00.000Z	sipior	skippycostin	good luck sorting things out
