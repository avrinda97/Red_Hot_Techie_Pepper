2006-10-01T08:20:00.000Z	tk		soooo.... there isnt a control panel/display manager that lets me turn on my 2nd display in ubuntu?
2006-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	nvidia is twinview and ati is xineram i believe
2006-10-01T08:22:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	twinview not in the repos?
2006-10-01T08:23:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- give me a sec. did this a few days ago for nvidia
2006-10-01T08:23:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	thanks, I just reformated a kubuntu install that went bunk, and it was easy as pie... Ubuntu aint seeming as such :(
2006-10-01T08:27:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	so just changing the option to twinview should work? thanks :)
2006-10-01T08:27:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- Yes, just editing xorg.conf should be all you need.
2006-10-01T08:50:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	didnt quite work... manage to get X running with the modified config, but no display differences :(
2006-10-05T12:32:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- Did that help?
2006-10-05T12:33:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	thanks... ill check it out (mine stopped working after hooking up a new hub -- even the old hub wont work now)
2006-10-05T12:34:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- yes, too fragile. Maybe umounted the wrong way.
2006-10-05T12:39:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	worked, thanks :) will just setup my stuff command line the first time :)
2006-10-12T14:27:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- ntfs-3g driver? (just curious about nstalling it.)
2006-10-12T14:27:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	yah... I didnt have the problem on my external HD but I setup my internal with a shared partition and its like that...
2006-10-12T14:28:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- That is really wierd.
2006-10-12T14:29:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- If you ran ntfs check disk would the partition show up again?
2006-10-12T14:30:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	its visible... I can write to it right now... i just cant see like.... my web files I setup under linux....
2006-10-12T14:31:00.000Z	THX-1138	tk	- Gotta be some journaling record in the registry. - anyone for a conspiracy theory?
2006-10-13T14:01:00.000Z	tk	THX-1138	I figured out my NTFS problem
