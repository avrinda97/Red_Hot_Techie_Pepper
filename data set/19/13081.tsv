2005-07-13T13:39:00.000Z	marc		Is there anyway to get application menu bars to act like OSX in Gnome?
2005-07-13T13:40:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	use superkaramba
2005-07-13T13:45:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	the link you showed me is an image of a macintosh desktop
2005-07-13T13:45:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	superkaramba has a 'dock' widget (superkaramba is similar to gdesklets)
2005-07-13T13:46:00.000Z	marc	nalioth	 isnt the dock at the bottom though?
2005-07-13T13:47:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	if you browse around, further at gnome-look, you'll see the superkaramba 'dock' in action
2005-07-13T13:47:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	you can have a dock on any edge
2005-07-13T13:49:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	you can use kde stuff under gnome, and vice-versa
2005-07-13T15:12:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	ewww why would we do that?
2005-07-13T15:16:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	there are lots of mindless games available
2005-07-13T15:19:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	there is a really cool mindless run jump and kill game that uses the sdl libs
2005-07-13T15:20:00.000Z	marc	nalioth	Know the name by chance?
2005-07-13T15:21:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	you need 'abuse'
2005-07-13T15:21:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	it is mindless and enthralling
2005-07-13T15:21:00.000Z	marc	nalioth	cool, Is xpilot still popular?
2005-07-13T15:22:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	do YOU like xpilot?
2005-07-13T15:22:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	then popularity doesnt matter
2005-10-27T09:48:00.000Z	nalioth	marc	use sudo
