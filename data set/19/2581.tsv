2010-05-17T09:46:00.000Z	Blurpeace		Yeah, but I have my prior OS disc.
2010-05-17T09:46:00.000Z	Blurpeace		So I just need to insert that and I can install.
2010-05-17T09:47:00.000Z	Blurpeace		Should probably +b him. :\
2010-05-17T09:47:00.000Z	Blurpeace		Cogito, yeah, it's an upgrade disc, but if I can insert my prior OS disc, it'll install fine.
2010-05-17T09:48:00.000Z	Blurpeace		Works the same as a regular install.
2010-05-17T09:49:00.000Z	Blurpeace		how do you mean no swap?
2010-05-17T09:50:00.000Z	Blurpeace		id theoretically have to use two ISOs, regardless
2010-05-17T09:52:00.000Z	Blurpeace		Cogito, I am currently running Ubuntu 10.04. I have one CD drive. I have installed VirtualBox and am attempting to install Windows XP Professional. Because I own an upgrade disc, during installation, I must insert my prior OS disc (I own a Windows 98 full install disc) to continue. I cannot eject my CD drive to replace the XP disc with the 98 disc so I cannot continue with the installation.
2010-05-17T09:53:00.000Z	Blurpeace		How do I eject the drive so that I can swap the discs, Cogito?
2010-05-17T09:54:00.000Z	hmw	Blurpeace	did you try the "Devices" menu?

2010-05-17T09:54:00.000Z	Blurpeace	hmw	I have not. :\
2010-05-17T09:56:00.000Z	Blurpeace		Cogito, how would I go about converting my 98 disc into an ISO?
2010-05-17T09:56:00.000Z	hmw	Blurpeace	you should be able to unmount the disk in said menu
2010-05-17T09:57:00.000Z	Blurpeace	hmw	presumably not while the installation is running. Besides, I attempted that and it would not unmount.
2010-05-17T09:57:00.000Z	hmw	Blurpeace	i see... hmm...
2010-05-17T09:58:00.000Z	hmw	Blurpeace	you should be able to mount a second disk, perhaps you have 2 drives and windows accepts the disk on another drive. If that will not work, I doubt making ISOs will help
2010-05-17T09:58:00.000Z	hmw	Blurpeace	you should be able to unmount, as far as the drive is not in use, and since you are asked to insert another disk, it's quite weird
