2006-05-16T12:33:00.000Z	HIGH-FREQ		anyone got a wpc54g  wireless pcmcia card working without ndiswrapper?
2006-05-16T12:34:00.000Z	HIGH-FREQ		ya...it all seems everyone using ndiswrapper with it ;(
2006-05-16T12:34:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	I'm using one right now.
2006-05-16T12:34:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	wpc54gv2
2006-05-16T12:35:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	If you don't want ndiswrapper, you need Ubuntu dapper.
2006-05-16T12:36:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	Then you need the bcm43xx firmware package
2006-05-16T12:36:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/
2006-05-16T12:36:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	download bcm43xx-firmware_1.1, instal it.
2006-05-16T12:37:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	then reboot
2006-05-16T12:37:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	What builtin one do you have?
2006-05-16T12:39:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	there is no need to fetch newer kernels off kernel.org, the Ubuntu guys backport the latest 43xx driver stuff into the Ubuntu kernels.
2006-05-16T12:42:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	No, wifi-radar doesn't work with bcm43xx
2006-05-16T12:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	DIsab;e bcm43xx, use ndiswrapper. It will work just fine.
2006-05-16T12:48:00.000Z	HIGH-FREQ	cafuego_	: i just blacklisted the bcm43xx  so i should be good then.... is it still gonna be a problem with the rate speed
2006-05-16T12:48:00.000Z	HIGH-FREQ	cafuego_	or is that just on broadcom
2006-05-16T12:48:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	It'll "just work".
2006-05-16T12:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	HIGH-FREQ	To my knowledge, yes
2006-05-16T12:55:00.000Z	HIGH-FREQ	cafuego_	why o why does it have to be me ;(    lmao
2006-05-16T12:56:00.000Z	HIGH-FREQ	cafuego_	 ndiswrapper -i lsbcmnds.inf   from the wpc54gv2 windoz drivers....then i ran ndiswrapper -l  and says driver present..but doesn't say hardware present ;(
