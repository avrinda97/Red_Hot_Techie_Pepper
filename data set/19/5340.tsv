2008-09-17T13:10:00.000Z	chubs		amarok is still the best
2008-09-17T13:10:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	new banshee is amazing
2008-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	how new?
2008-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	running 1.3 from svn
2008-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	have you tried amarok 2 beta?
2008-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	no
2008-09-17T13:12:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	it is also amazing
2008-09-17T13:12:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	will have to take a look.  i hack plugs on gnome-do and we had a lot of problems with amarok.  banshee is working with us now :)
2008-09-17T13:12:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	they wrote a dbus interface with us in mind
2008-09-17T13:13:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	well that was kind of them. Yeah amarok and gnome don't always seem to go together as well as i'd like
2008-09-17T13:13:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	one of the reasons why i started playing with other players and ended up on banshee
2008-09-17T13:14:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	the one thing about banshee that i hated was its startup time, having to wait for all my music files to load in that one playlist. I really like the tree style of amarok
2008-09-17T13:15:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	one thing i miss from amarok was mysql integration
2008-09-17T13:15:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	^
2008-09-17T13:16:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	yeah, I use that on my music server. amarok 2 got rid of most of their support for other db's so it's mysql only now. hopefully that means even further optimizations
2008-09-17T13:17:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	will definately have to play.. though no do plugin love till its released :)
2008-09-17T13:17:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	oh well. I'm using kde 4.1.1 right now anyways :) don't tell ;)
2008-09-17T13:18:00.000Z	sacul	chubs	kde always felt bloated to me
2008-09-17T13:18:00.000Z	chubs	sacul	agreed. I heard kde4 was less so and I gave it a try. It's now less bloated than gnome i daresay, I'm loving it
