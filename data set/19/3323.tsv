2010-05-17T16:13:00.000Z	m0ar		Guys. I can select windows in my grub, but when I try to start it i get a fatal error: "BOOTMGR is missing"
2010-05-17T16:14:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	what version of windows
2010-05-17T16:14:00.000Z	m0ar	histo	Win7
2010-05-17T16:15:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	k let me check on something
2010-05-17T16:16:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	what is your drive/partitioning setup right now?
2010-05-17T16:17:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	sometimes windows puts its boot files in a c:\boot folder especially on upgrades.
2010-05-17T16:18:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	but its kind of difficult to help if you won't answer questions "fdisk is fine"...
2010-05-17T16:20:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	Mo0unt the windows partition in windows and see if you have a boot folder in the root of the drive.  You can try copying the files out of there to the root of the drive. Should fix your issues.
2010-05-17T16:20:00.000Z	m0ar	histo	will do
2010-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	sry meant mount the windows partition in ubuntu
2010-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	but you get the idea.
2010-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	m0ar	histo	I understood that :D
2010-05-17T16:22:00.000Z	m0ar	histo	Nope, no /boot
2010-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	basically it can't see the boot manager files for some reason. what version of ubuntu?
2010-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	m0ar	histo	lucid
2010-05-17T16:25:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	yeah you have to find where the boot manager is can you pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l
2010-05-17T16:26:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	if its a computer that came with windows 7 from the factory it could be on a seperate smaller partition.
2010-05-17T16:26:00.000Z	m0ar	histo	I've reinstalled diffrent windows versions and many linux distributions since then
2010-05-17T16:27:00.000Z	histo	m0ar	okay well if you could pastebin that and the grub.cfg I'll take a look
