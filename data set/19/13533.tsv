2010-02-09T19:11:00.000Z	bigcx2		does anybody know what happened to the displayconfig-gtk utility in hardy?
2010-02-09T19:11:00.000Z	bigcx2		s/hardy/karmic
2010-02-09T19:11:00.000Z	bigcx2		d'oh
2010-02-09T19:12:00.000Z	bigcx2		i have a graphics card that supports resolutions up to 4096x? according to xrandr
2010-02-09T19:12:00.000Z	bigcx2		but i can't get any resolutions to get set permanently
2010-02-09T19:12:00.000Z	bigcx2		and there's no Xorg.conf file in karmic??? like wtf
2010-02-09T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 thers  none needed in many cases
2010-02-09T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 and thats changes from the X updates.. not really a ubuntu specific feature
2010-02-09T19:13:00.000Z	bigcx2	Dr_Willis	yea but what about the users that do need it?!?!?!? Are they expected to type in xrandr commands every time they log in to GDM
2010-02-09T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 the nvidia settings tool made a xorg.conf for me
2010-02-09T19:14:00.000Z	bigcx2	Dr_Willis	I have an Intel Atom chipset and I have no xorg.conf
2010-02-09T19:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 on my netbook the display settings tool sets the default res for my users somewhere in their home dir.. so its not an iss to me
2010-02-09T19:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 my netbook AAO, has no xorg.conf - and i can set/change my res with the tools and it rembers.
2010-02-09T19:15:00.000Z	bigcx2	Dr_Willis	If I could simply set the correct resolution in Prefs -> Display then i would be happy
2010-02-09T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 iw as able to enable the 2nd monitor and have it running at a higher res and it rembers
2010-02-09T19:15:00.000Z	bigcx2		but it only has resolutions for 800x600
2010-02-09T19:15:00.000Z	bigcx2		and that's poop
2010-02-09T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 that tool rembers them for me. I DO recall i might of had to hit the fn-monitor button to enable the external monitor. then  used that tool.
2010-02-09T19:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bigcx2	 on my netbook the netbook has its res. then the external monitor has its own res.
