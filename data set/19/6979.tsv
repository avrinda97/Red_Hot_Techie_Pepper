2009-02-28T12:48:00.000Z	Laibsch		I wonder if somebody can help me with working around a problem I seem to be having with shared interrupts (until a proper fix for bug 334957 is found)
2009-02-28T12:49:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	sounds like bios tinkering maybe
2009-02-28T12:50:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	or switching pci card to different slot if thats applicable
2009-02-28T12:50:00.000Z	Laibsch	b1n42y	Actually, I tinkered with BIOS settings a bit after I understood it was a problem with shared IRQ
2009-02-28T12:50:00.000Z	Laibsch		Moved a couple of settings from explicit choosing IRQ 11 to "automatic" and rebooted
2009-02-28T12:50:00.000Z	Laibsch		Everything is still on IRQ 11 :-(
2009-02-28T12:51:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	tried os controlled?
2009-02-28T12:51:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	and what exaclty is the problem
2009-02-28T12:52:00.000Z	Laibsch	b1n42y	bug 334957 should have the details
2009-02-28T12:52:00.000Z	Laibsch		No bot for launchpad bugs here?
2009-02-28T12:53:00.000Z	Laibsch	b1n42y	Essentially, my mouse drifts when wifi load is high
2009-02-28T12:55:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	oh, dono mate, maybe get different type of mouse easiest solution
2009-02-28T12:55:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	usb or wireless
2009-02-28T12:55:00.000Z	Laibsch	b1n42y	will a different mouse likely get a different IRQ?
2009-02-28T12:55:00.000Z	Laibsch		I think this even happens with the built-in mouse
2009-02-28T12:56:00.000Z	Laibsch		In this case a Trackpoint
2009-02-28T12:56:00.000Z	Laibsch		or whatever this pointing IBM-thingie is called
2009-02-28T12:56:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	well i was thinking switching from ps2 to usb or something along those lines
2009-02-28T12:57:00.000Z	b1n42y	Laibsch	sorry dinner time, have you completely explored your bios optins
