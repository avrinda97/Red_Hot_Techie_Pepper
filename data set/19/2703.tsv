2010-01-26T02:33:00.000Z	rww	Skint	the "xchat" package is Xchat. the "xchat-gnome" package is Xchat Gnome.
2010-01-26T02:33:00.000Z	rww	Skint	sudo apt-get install xchat installs real xchat.
2010-01-26T02:41:00.000Z	rww	Skint	did you just install Ubuntu?
2010-01-26T02:42:00.000Z	Skint	rww	yeah
2010-01-26T02:43:00.000Z	rww	Skint	Have you done "sudo apt-get update" yet? If not, that would be a good start.
2010-01-26T02:43:00.000Z	rww	Skint	(and then "sudo apt-get install xchat" should work)
2010-01-26T02:43:00.000Z	Skint	rww	i had done it yeah thats how I got ubuntu xchat
2010-01-26T02:44:00.000Z	rww	Skint	do you have the universe repository enabled?
2010-01-26T02:44:00.000Z	Skint	rww	not sure it's my first time with any sort of linux
2010-01-26T02:45:00.000Z	rww	Skint	System -> Administration -> Software Sources, see if "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)" is checked.
2010-01-26T02:46:00.000Z	rww	Skint	check it, press close, press reload, try installing xchat again.
2010-01-26T02:47:00.000Z	Skint	rww	it's downloading stuff now
2010-01-26T02:47:00.000Z	rww	Skint	glad I could help :)
