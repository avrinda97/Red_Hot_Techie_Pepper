2008-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	billygalbreath		hello all! i am trying to get fluxbox to automatically open on boot without a login manager like gdm/kdm/xdm. I have searched for hours on google but everthing points to the 'easy' way out by using gdm/kdm's auto login feature. I _need_ to bypass the login manager's at all cost. I have figured out how to auto login to tty1 but my .bash_profile fails to let me startx from there giving me a "cannot start x from this shell" (
2008-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	billygalbreath		or something similar) error. I have tried other methods, all which have failed me. most things i try bring me to a dead tty1 (dead meaning i get no prompt. not even the text login will work there) any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated! :D
2008-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	billygalbreath		no file there
2008-11-02T08:16:00.000Z	billygalbreath		really
2008-11-02T08:16:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	can you paste the exact error message you got when trying to startx from bash_profile?
2008-11-02T08:18:00.000Z	billygalbreath	littlelambda	bash: no job control in this shell
2008-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	hmmmm. Does startx from the terminal?
2008-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	billygalbreath	littlelambda	startx from terminal works fine
2008-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	what is your bash_profile?
2008-11-02T08:25:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	that last post was for you, sorry
2008-11-02T08:38:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	did you have any luck with .bashrc?
2008-11-02T08:38:00.000Z	billygalbreath	littlelambda	to be honest, i didnt try it - i dont think that will do any different
2008-11-02T08:40:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	I was thinking if your playing with the ttys didnt help, perhaps it was something to do with bash being interactive or a logon shell or something.
2008-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	billygalbreath	littlelambda	i'll try the method you suggested as soon as this dist-upgrade finishes
2008-11-02T08:43:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	Aye. Its a long shot, but all I can think off atm.
2008-11-02T09:38:00.000Z	billygalbreath	littlelambda	Flannel, Brucee: since there is no /etc/inittab in Ubuntu - how would I respawn tty's on boot? see step # 3 -> http://xubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/07/13/automatically-log-into-xfce-without-a-login-manager/
2008-11-02T09:48:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	sorry, i got distracted
2008-11-02T09:49:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	it must be somewhere in /etc/event.d
2008-11-02T09:49:00.000Z	littlelambda	billygalbreath	im guessing anyhow. maybe tty1?
