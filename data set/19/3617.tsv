2009-11-01T09:04:00.000Z	Ollonk		absolutely nothing
2009-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	Ollonk		that IS installed wgrant
2009-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	Ollonk		I'm 100% sure of that
2009-11-01T09:07:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	I didn't see your problem initially. Your touchpad doesn't work at all? Which version of Ubuntu? Does it work in Windows? A previous Ubuntu release?
2009-11-01T09:07:00.000Z	Ollonk	wgrant	I'm in karmic. It worked in jaunty and 8.10 and windows xp
2009-11-01T09:07:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	ubuntu-bug xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
2009-11-01T09:09:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	What is the bug number?
2009-11-01T09:19:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	That's interesting. The kernel seems to only sort of know about your touchpad.
2009-11-01T09:20:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	Do you have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2009-11-01T09:21:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	Pastebin the contents, please.
2009-11-01T09:22:00.000Z	Ollonk	wgrant	http://paste.ubuntu.com/306395/ but I manually added the pointing device section trying to fix this problem, it didn't exist before
2009-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	Oh. Move that xorg.conf away (none of those display settings should be relevant any more), and refile the bug.
2009-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	that section will have been throwing all the logs off.
2009-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf{,.backup}
2009-11-01T09:26:00.000Z	Ollonk	wgrant	467905
2009-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	Um, I should have probably told you to log out and in again before refiling the bug.
2009-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	So, I'm telling you that now :P
2009-11-01T09:32:00.000Z	Ollonk	wgrant	467909
2009-11-01T09:34:00.000Z	wgrant	Ollonk	OK, that looks good. Someone will hopefully look at your bug soon.
