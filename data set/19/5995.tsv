2008-04-10T09:10:00.000Z	bidget		ok here's a question
2008-04-10T09:10:00.000Z	bidget		if I move the .wine folder
2008-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	bidget		will wine still work?
2008-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	bidget		crap
2008-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	bidget		so is that a yes or no hahaha
2008-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	Hmm, I'd have thought that some files to do with the wine registry would be stored there?
2008-04-10T09:20:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	Be quite sure that everything has been copied
2008-04-10T09:21:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	basically, "rm -rf foo" translates to "remove foo, all subdirectories in it, and don't prompt before deleting protected files among these files"
2008-04-10T09:23:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	No, because the command he told you to use was "cp -R ~/.wine/* /opt/windows" -- that means everything under .wine was copied over under /opt/windows.
2008-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	what's the command you use in terminal to start steam?
2008-04-10T09:32:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	you could probably add an ampersand to the end (&) and that'd background it
2008-04-10T09:33:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	Yes, and if you're launching it with a launcher icon instead of in a terminal, you wouldn't really need the &
2008-04-10T09:40:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	you made a script file, and then a launcher icon? you could look at the launcher icon's properties (right-click, then edit Properties) and click on the current icon in the dialog that appears.
2008-04-10T09:40:00.000Z	bidget	Fyda	I didnt make a launcher icon or anything I just made the .sh file
2008-04-10T09:40:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	Oh, well, .sh files don't have icons
2008-04-10T09:40:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	but launchers do :P
2008-04-10T09:40:00.000Z	bidget	Fyda	how do I make a launcher then haha
2008-04-10T09:41:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	well, you could make one on the desktop; right-click, add a launcher...
2008-04-10T09:43:00.000Z	Fyda	bidget	You'd be surprised how much Google knows  and how much it's willing to share ;)
