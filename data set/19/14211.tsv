2005-03-19T13:11:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	i think upgrading is a good idea; it's mostly stable IME
2005-03-19T13:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	worth a shot
2005-03-29T17:39:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	i don't think ohgood was talking to you. :P
2005-03-29T17:39:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	bah I was just trying to help...take it away ole master
2005-04-01T16:13:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	horribly buggy?
2005-04-01T16:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	horribly buggy yes
2005-04-01T16:13:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	which version are you using?
2005-04-01T16:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	it woudn't even 'reply' to emails right without giving a relay error and its crashed way too much
2005-04-01T16:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	latest that came with hoary
2005-04-01T16:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	2.2.1.1
2005-04-01T16:14:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	well, 2.2 is the latest stable version, maybe you should downgrade.  or, perhaps more stable would be going back to the 2.0 version.  using packages in hoary is hit-or-miss, and evo 2.1 was a development version, so i'm not sure what you expected. :P
2005-04-01T16:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	its also slow'ish I find to respond to things unlike sylpheed or say thunderbird..but it might be that what came with hoary is bleeding edge and to be expected I dont know
2005-04-01T16:15:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	well, it's larger.  you could try balsa: email only, but still GTK+2.
2005-04-01T16:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	I expect them to ship half way stable versions frankly even if its hoary ;-) ( considering hoary is stabalizing nicely now ) but hey that just me <wink>
2005-04-01T16:16:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	if evo releases it, it ends up in hoary.  until hoary is stable, you can't expect stable *upstream* software...
2005-04-01T16:16:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	yeah I know evo does quite a bit indeed and sadly thunderbird doesn't handle global filters making it rather pita to setup..can't win LOL
2005-04-01T16:16:00.000Z	andrewski	neighborlee	i'd suggest balsa... again.
2005-04-01T16:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	I might try just grabbing evo earlier and see or just go with thunderbird shrug....
2005-04-01T16:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	andrewski	hmmm yes I know of balsa..Ill take a look
