2005-11-03T15:58:00.000Z	dwt		Hi there!
2005-11-03T15:59:00.000Z	dwt		Hey, I'm a bit stumped by a ubuntu 5.10 installation
2005-11-03T15:59:00.000Z	dwt		as the first user is not able to to use sudo
2005-11-03T16:00:00.000Z	dwt		also there seems to be no group "admin" which is referenced all over the wiki
2005-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	dwt		I since "hacked" the sudoers file to include that user, but recon that there is something wrong which should be fixed.
2005-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	dwt		Can somebody give me a hint where to search for info on this?
2005-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	did you do an 'expert' install?
2005-11-04T17:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	boot in recovery mode and run 'passwd'
2005-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	dwt	HappyFool	recovery is always the root user?
2005-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	imo, if, after a normal install, your first user is not a member of the 'admin' group, then there was an error in the install, or you have uncovered a bug
2005-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	indeed, recovery runs as root
2005-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	dwt	HappyFool	thanks!
2005-11-04T17:05:00.000Z	dwt	HappyFool	I don't even have a group called admin on my system...
2005-11-04T17:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	it sounds like the install is broken
2005-11-04T17:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	this is ubuntu 5.10, 'normal' edition? (i.e., not 'server edition')
2005-11-04T17:06:00.000Z	dwt	HappyFool	yes normal
2005-11-04T17:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	dwt	i stick with a 'broken install' diagnosis
2005-11-04T17:08:00.000Z	dwt	HappyFool	Yeah I see it the same way
2005-11-04T17:09:00.000Z	dwt	HappyFool	anto9us: Well, I'm going to try a reinstall and come back here to report on the problem if it crops up again
