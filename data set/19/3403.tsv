2012-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	this april
2012-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	Thanks!
2012-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	think about the version numbers of past LTS releases ;)
2012-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	8.04, 10.04 ....
2012-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	I ionly started with LTS 18 months ago or so
2012-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	I see, well now you see the pattern. I assume you know how the version numbers are formed too
2012-03-29T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	sudo rfkill unblock all
2012-03-29T05:40:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	Trying that...
2012-03-29T05:40:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	But it is my wired NIC that si disabled
2012-03-29T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	is there a switch or shortcut key to enable / disable the interface
2012-03-29T05:43:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	The wired NIC?
2012-03-29T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	sure
2012-03-29T06:22:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	.. no.... It is weirder. I have a pccard bt interface, if I take that out and restart, the wired NIC is enabled and works as it should. If I then shove it in, the NIC keeps working and BT also starts up. But at boot time, the pccard must not be inserted or it disables the wired NIC.
2012-03-29T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	are there any bugs reported?
2012-03-29T06:23:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	Not that I know of
2012-03-29T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	I suggest you report one
2012-03-29T06:23:00.000Z	zruty	ActionParsnip	Okay. Launchpad was it? Bene a while since I done that...
2012-03-29T06:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zruty	ubuntu-bug bluetooth      maybe, if it's not appropriate it will be moved by the ops
