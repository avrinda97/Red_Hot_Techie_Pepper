2009-08-27T07:53:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	avantix	what does 'glxinfo |grep render' show?
2009-08-27T07:54:00.000Z	avantix	sub[t]rnl	direct rendering: yes -> openGL renderer string: Software Rasterizer
2009-08-27T07:55:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	avantix	it's falling back to software because DRI is disabled
2009-08-27T07:55:00.000Z	avantix		that's right
2009-08-27T07:55:00.000Z	avantix		dri is not enabled
2009-08-27T07:55:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	avantix	I believe your intel card has a freeze issue with jaunty
2009-08-27T07:55:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	avantix	so DRI was disabled intentionally. :/
2009-08-27T07:56:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl		!intel | avantix
