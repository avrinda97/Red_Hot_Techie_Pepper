2009-12-05T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	telnet to the server name and proxy port - see if you can get to it
2009-12-05T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	telnet to the proxy server you want to use on the port you think is open, eg: telnet proxyserver.network.com 8080
2009-12-05T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	that will tell you if you can reach the proxy server you want at a basic network level, which is a good place to start
2009-12-06T23:24:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	you where told what to do last time you where in here
2009-12-06T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	1.) you need to be authorized to use a proxy server 2.) you need to telnet to it on the port you want to use to test your connection to it
2009-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	are you allowed (have you asked the person who controls the proxy) if you are allowed to use it
2009-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	luis_	ikonia	masteryoda just give me a list of usa proxies
2009-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	you need to know / be allowed to use the proxy
2009-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	do not ask for proxy lists in this channel
2009-12-06T23:33:00.000Z	luis_	ikonia	if i cant ask in this channel for a proxie, how to be authorized, and all that things cause i am getting tired of this, where i can, i have stress alreayd =DDD
2009-12-06T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	this channel is for ubuntu operating system support - not to help you find proxies
2009-12-06T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	luis_	to use a proxy server you have to already know one - and be allowed to use it, don't use this channel to find one
