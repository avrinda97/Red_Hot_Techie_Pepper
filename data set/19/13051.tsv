2005-06-03T09:28:00.000Z	Echelon-H		hmmm what is the command for terminal (I want to make a shortcut)
2005-06-03T09:29:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	gnome-terminal?
2005-06-03T09:30:00.000Z	Echelon-H	dcraven	xfce?
2005-06-03T09:30:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	Depends on the terminal you use.
2005-06-03T09:31:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	Open a term, if it has a help menu, click "About" to see what it is.
2005-06-03T12:56:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	It does files too.
2005-06-03T12:56:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	Sure it does.
2005-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	Echelon-H	dcraven	the filename has spaces... so the command gets broken or something
2005-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	Echelon-H	dcraven	how can I fix it?
2005-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	Quotes or escape the space with a \.
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	mv "file with spaces" file_no_spaces
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	Or mv file\ with\ spaces file_no_spaces
2005-06-03T12:59:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	mkdir
2005-06-03T13:01:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	mv myfolder/* wherever
2005-06-03T13:16:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	You really should have a breeze through a small bash tutorial. It may be more useful than you give credit.
2005-06-03T13:17:00.000Z	Echelon-H	dcraven	Yeah, just after 15 years of windows, I need to get used to terminal.
2005-06-03T13:17:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	It's understandable, I'm just saying you maybe shouldn't brush off something as useful as becoming comfortable with bash as 'unimportant'.
2005-06-03T13:22:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	heh
2005-06-03T13:22:00.000Z	dcraven	Echelon-H	It's supposed to.
