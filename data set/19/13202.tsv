2005-05-01T11:28:00.000Z	JaGWiRE```		I have installed suse, and fedora core on my notebook which has a 2100 wireless chip (centrino, dothian I think). I've had no luck with either distrobutions, will ubuntu support this out of the box or will I have to go modding stuff?
2005-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	JaGWiRE```		Anyone here able to answer my question?
2005-05-01T11:30:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	I think intel 2xxx should work out of the box, but I don't have one.
2005-05-01T11:31:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	suse definitely doesn't.  HP includes a modification to their suse distros to get that working
2005-05-01T11:39:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	lol, I've never broken my arm even with my 7 pound amd64 notebook... viao's are pretty looking though.
2005-05-01T11:40:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	yeah, same with mine.  it was (afaik) the first amd64 laptop released.
2005-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	how long does it take you to boot to windows?
2005-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	JaGWiRE```	b2s	i'm at school so yeah.. only reason why i got a shit gfx card and lightweight.
2005-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	its easy anyway.  ubuntu will add it to fstab, you just have to tell it to actually mount it at boot.
2005-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	yeah, I wish ubuntu had captive-ntfs.  you might try making a small fat32 partition for shuffling data back and forth
2005-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	how many?  I haven't lost one yet...
2005-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	... how on earth do you do that?!  of course, I usually have hotswap bays anyway...
2005-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	irssi! wee!
2005-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	its pretty easy to write irssi scripts in perl
2005-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	eh?  I use "/connect freenode"
2005-05-01T11:56:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	I'm still using gnome until I can show it to a friend (who installed kde) but afterwards is xfce for me
2005-05-01T11:56:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	xfce is my favorite
2005-05-01T11:57:00.000Z	b2s	JaGWiRE```	mine actually looks just like BeOS actually :)
