2009-01-18T02:36:00.000Z	ExAstris		No, but I did try what it did for my particular situation.
2009-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	ExAstris		I assumed that randomly attempting to install somethingl ike a bootloader wasn't a good idea.
2009-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		The thing is that I'm on OS X
2009-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		and I don't want to accidentally overwrite EFI
2009-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		or rEFIt
2009-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		On a mac, not OS X, sorry.
2009-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	ExAstris		Not PowerPC.
2009-01-18T02:39:00.000Z	ExAstris		This is an Intel-based MAcbook Pro
2009-01-18T02:39:00.000Z	ExAstris		About a year and a half old.
2009-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	ExAstris		I'm going to try this "auto-grub-super-disk" thing on that fixing grub page.
2009-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	Grub issues?
2009-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	did you overwrite grub?
2009-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	it's easy to put GRUB back in place
2009-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	do you have a livecd?
2009-01-18T02:42:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	did you try doing what the wiki says?
2009-01-18T02:42:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	No go?
2009-01-18T02:43:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	There IS an EFI loader for linux
2009-01-18T02:44:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	GRUB isn't likely to work with EFI
2009-01-18T02:45:00.000Z	Drknezzz	ExAstris	Then just reinstall grub into the linux partition, not the MBR
