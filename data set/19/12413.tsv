2005-11-24T15:18:00.000Z	dr_willis		samba shares are fairly easy to set up manually.
2005-11-24T15:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	That is not the point, really. The point is that I am missing perl libraries.
2005-11-24T15:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 reinstall webmin perhaps. It works for me fine however.
2005-11-24T15:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 does any of the webmin modules work?
2005-11-24T15:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	yes, it is just the samba setup that does not work.
2005-11-24T15:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 Hmm.. -> /usr/share/webmin/web-lib-funcs.pl  and dor some ODD reason i also have a /usr/local/share/webmin/web-lib-funcs.pl

2005-11-24T15:23:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	Is there a command to run to make perl aware of newly installed libraries?
2005-11-24T15:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 Not that i know of. Hmm - i cant even get webminsamba stuff installed.. repo seems to be slow/down
2005-11-24T15:24:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	:(
2006-07-04T07:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	Really?
2008-10-14T02:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	Would you mind explaining how that would overwrite?
2008-10-14T02:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 i ment to append to a log once.. and did a typo once and removed my other log.. i forget if i ment to use > when i used >> or if i was the othe rway around.
2008-10-14T02:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 perhaps  i used > >  with a space..
2008-10-14T02:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	Ahh. Well if you use > or > > instead of >> you will overwrite, yes.
2008-10-14T02:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	BlueEagle	 that 'noclober' setting i think   is usefull for brain dead people like me.
2008-10-14T02:11:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	We've all been zombies at 4am and done stupid things. ;)
2008-10-18T18:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dr_willis	I may be thinking of KDE. What's the hot-key to start a run-dialog in gnome?
