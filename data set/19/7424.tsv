2007-10-23T02:09:00.000Z	stefg	yasper	then indeed the build needs the full kernel source... so you have to sudo apt-get install linux-source, then unpack the archive in /usr/src and adjust the symlink 'linux' to point on the unpacked kernel source
2007-10-23T02:24:00.000Z	yasper	stefg	- I have downloaded the linux source - can you help me link please
2007-10-23T02:25:00.000Z	stefg	yasper	you need to unpack the archive in /usr/src
2007-10-23T02:28:00.000Z	yasper	stefg	- I am unpacking and just loads of cannot open: no such file or directory
2007-10-23T02:31:00.000Z	yasper	stefg	- please have a look at this - what is going on?! http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41754/
2007-10-23T02:32:00.000Z	stefg	yasper	are you running out of memory or /tmp space ?
