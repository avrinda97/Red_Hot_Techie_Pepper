2008-12-12T21:13:00.000Z	Ultimus		does anyone know how to wipe files in ubuntu's nautilus
2008-12-12T21:14:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	define "wipe"
2008-12-12T21:15:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	that's not really possible on ext3
2008-12-12T21:16:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	hmm, so you have to wipe the whole partition?
2008-12-12T21:17:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	try looking at 'man wipe' and 'man shred'.  One of them discusses this
2008-12-12T21:18:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	no manual entry for wipe
2008-12-12T21:18:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	install it :)
2008-12-12T21:21:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	how do I install wipe, via add/remove?
2008-12-12T21:21:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	sure
2008-12-12T21:22:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	I cant find it
2008-12-12T21:22:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	sudo apt-get install wipe
2008-12-12T21:24:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	thanks. Do you know the command to enter the configuration in nautilus
2008-12-12T21:24:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	it's a terminal command.  It also doesn't do what you want.  Remember?  I said its man page has information you should read (along with the man page for shred)
2008-12-12T21:25:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	ok
2008-12-12T21:26:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	is there a esc function in ubuntu, for ex. when I want to exit the manual page, or do I have to close the terminal each time
2008-12-12T21:26:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	press q
2008-12-12T21:27:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	thanks maan, I'm new into this thing so you have to be patient with me
2008-12-12T21:27:00.000Z	jrib	Ultimus	sure
2008-12-12T21:31:00.000Z	Ultimus	jrib	sorry but what's difference between shred and wipe, which is to prefer, some say you cant wipe files in ext3 so what exactly is this wipe doing? Just wonder...
