2010-06-26T04:33:00.000Z	RickyWh		"No supported authentication methods avialable"
2010-06-26T04:35:00.000Z	peturi	RickyWh	Did you by any change manually change the /etc/passwd or the /etc/shadow file?
2010-06-26T04:35:00.000Z	RickyWh	peturi	nothing exists in that file
2010-06-26T04:35:00.000Z	RickyWh		Oh ya, tons of stuff in here

2010-06-26T04:37:00.000Z	RickyWh		no output
2010-06-26T04:37:00.000Z	RickyWh		oh wait
2010-06-26T04:37:00.000Z	RickyWh		ya big long string
2010-06-26T04:37:00.000Z	peturi	RickyWh	the error you gave: This error indicates that PuTTY has run out of ways to authenticate you to an SSH server. This may be because PuTTY has TIS or keyboard-interactive authentication disabled
2010-06-26T04:38:00.000Z	RickyWh		i think i just need to turn on password authentication for my server, how do I do that? i see in my sshd_config file RSA authentication is on
2010-06-26T04:38:00.000Z	RickyWh		in my sshd_config file i have RSAAuthentication yes     and PubkeyAuthentication yes
2010-06-26T04:39:00.000Z	RickyWh		how do i enable password authentication?
2010-06-26T04:39:00.000Z	RickyWh		oh ya, ok sweet
2010-06-26T04:41:00.000Z	RickyWh	peturi	IConrad01, sweet it works, thanks so much guys :)
2010-06-26T04:42:00.000Z	peturi	RickyWh	no prob
