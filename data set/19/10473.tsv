2006-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	you downloaded and extracted a file in order to install xmms?
2006-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	that is a method of last resort only
2006-06-11T08:53:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	that is the source code.  you want to install an ubuntu binary.  you can install xmms from a terminal with 'apt-get install xmms'  or use synaptic.
2006-06-11T08:53:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	sorry, 'sudo apt-get install xmms'
2006-06-11T08:55:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	enter your own password
2006-06-11T08:57:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	you need to try again.  you didn't make it clear what happened.  use your password.  if it doesn't work you have to say more---say the error message.
2006-06-11T08:59:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	gavagai	i did use my pass and exactly NOTHING happend . it just resumed to the state it was before (it was showing the present location I was in i.e. desktop/xmms ...... )
2006-06-11T09:00:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	'sudo apt-get install xmms', see if nothing happens again
2006-06-11T09:00:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	gavagai	denix@mrdenix:~/Desktop/xmms-1.2.10$ sudo su apt -get install xmms
2006-06-11T09:12:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	and you are entering denix' password?
2006-06-11T09:12:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	only if you kept the window open or your irc client kept a log
2006-06-11T09:20:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	is this the only user account on the system?
2006-06-12T13:26:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	shutdown -r now  = shutdown now
2006-06-12T13:26:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	gavagai	thank you
2006-06-12T13:26:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	you're welcome.  the -r is for restart actually.  -h is full shutdown.
2006-06-12T13:27:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	gavagai	instead of now how can write an atribute  for a specific time (i.e. shutdown in 60 s)
2006-06-12T13:28:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	in that exampple the [-t sec]  is where you can put the amount of time to WAIT before doing it, or you can put the exact actual time where it says time
2006-06-12T13:29:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	gavagai	thanks mate ! :)
2006-06-12T13:29:00.000Z	gavagai	_Mr_Denix_	you are welcome.  :)
