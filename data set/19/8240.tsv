2007-06-17T07:56:00.000Z	Toshibi		I have been using Ubuntu now for 9 months and I still can't get my SATA Optical Drive to work
2007-06-17T07:57:00.000Z	Toshibi		Dr_Willis, I know, but I've had one now for about 2 years
2007-06-17T07:57:00.000Z	Toshibi		MSI
2007-06-17T07:58:00.000Z	Toshibi		I got this one for $69
2007-06-17T07:58:00.000Z	Toshibi		It's SATA DVD/CD_RW
2007-06-17T07:59:00.000Z	Toshibi		It workd out of the box back when I was running Windows....
2007-06-17T08:00:00.000Z	Toshibi		It's my one gripe
2007-06-17T08:01:00.000Z	Toshibi		Spheard, I hear that...I would still love to have this drive working
2007-06-17T08:01:00.000Z	Toshibi		VLC is an excellent player
2007-06-17T08:02:00.000Z	Toshibi		Spheard, it's 7.04 and it's just the sata optical drive...all of my other SATA drives work
2007-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	wols_	Toshibi	what does dmesg say?
2007-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	wols_	Toshibi	if you don't want to solve your problem, suit yourself
2007-06-17T08:12:00.000Z	wols_	Toshibi	it's unlikely that this will enable sound across the network
2007-06-17T08:13:00.000Z	Toshibi	wols_	It's worth a shot
2007-06-17T08:13:00.000Z	wols_	Toshibi	no it's not since it won't do sound this way
2007-06-17T08:13:00.000Z	Toshibi	wols_	I know, but there are also remote access sound servers which I'm googling up for someone unwilling to google themselves.
2007-06-17T08:21:00.000Z	wols_	Toshibi	nmapping from inside his LAN won't help a bit
2007-06-17T08:22:00.000Z	Toshibi	wols_	That's why he should do an nmap of the WAN address....it's been a while since I have messed with any of that stuff though
2007-06-17T08:23:00.000Z	wols_	Toshibi	he cannot do a nmap of that cause no matter what he will reach the router throught he lAN interface
