2009-10-22T08:22:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	don't count on it.. however :).... you can run windows in virtualbox from inside of ubuntu for those "must have" apps..
2009-10-22T08:41:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	yes.. get virtual box from their site..
2009-10-22T08:56:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	you can't run an already install version of windows in a vm.. you have to install it in the vm
2009-10-22T08:59:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	carpediem *can't run two
2009-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	what do you do in office that absolutely needs ms office?
2009-10-22T09:02:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	graphics work and a little spreadsheets?
2009-10-22T09:02:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	what's a "sell sheet"?
2009-10-22T09:04:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	yea.. and office 2003 & 2000 also do the same thing.. how 'bout installing OpenOffice on the work machine and you'd be set in both worlds?
2009-10-22T09:08:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	having worked in both worlds I know what you're up against.. OOo draw is better for layout then the wordprocessor but won't translate.. scribus is a great desktop publishing program and works on both platforms .. but.. it's tough teaching something new and if there are others (didn't know that).. it makes it that much more difficult.
2009-10-22T09:11:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	it's a full desktop publishing program.. you can do magazines, newspapers, flyers menus, business cards etc.. with print ready PDF output in cmyk etc.. there's even a book on amazon for it.. it takes a while to get use to but is really fantastic.. also their irc at #scribus is very helpful.. most times I end up talking to the author.
2009-10-22T09:12:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	yep.. a good companion program for creating svg graphics etc is inkscape
2009-10-22T09:14:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	there's usually two versions in the repos.. one ending in -ng .. -ng is typically the more recent version
2009-10-22T09:14:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	they also have a repo for ubuntu to get the absolute latest.. sometimes it's worth it..
2009-10-22T09:16:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	no.. use synaptic or scribus' repos ... it is a mental shift to use scribus.. don't expect to do things like in a word processor or MS Publisher.. it's different..
2009-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	I think that after using it for a while you'll get hooked.. remember that when creating a text box you can right mouse click on it and "edit text" .. you can also F2 afterwards for more adjustment options.
2009-10-22T09:20:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	no you don't have to do that.. it's just an option.
2009-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	now you're getting the hang of it :)
2009-10-22T09:24:00.000Z	scunizi	crohakon	have fun and spread the joy :)
