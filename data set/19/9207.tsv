2007-01-07T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	what does that 40 mean?
2007-01-09T12:00:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	seems to be
2007-01-09T12:00:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	edgy specifically deleted it when I upgraded
2007-01-09T12:03:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	ah.. I see, they moved it to sys/prefs/menu layout, and removed it from applications altogether... I was right, dude :)
2007-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	heh sure :)
2007-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	you're telling me that you have alacarte as a separate application ? because seriously, you don't
2007-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	all I claim, is the alacarte package exists in edgy
2007-01-09T12:05:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	yeha, but that's hardly the whole solution....
2007-02-19T06:15:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	.xprofile ? never heard of that
2007-02-19T06:17:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	you'd better be verra sure :)
2007-02-19T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	sethk: heh it's what I use.  I found it getting sourced in one of the gdm files once
2007-02-19T06:18:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	ah, so gdm exclusive - bad, bad idea for an X global file...
2007-02-19T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	true, I always assumed it would get sourced otherwise but never verified that
2007-02-19T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	adaptr	sethk: fwiw .xinitrc only seems to get sourced for startx, not with gdm.  And I've also found that .xsession exists as another option....
2007-02-19T06:32:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	yes, xsession is what a user uses, xinitrc is for the whole server - nothing new there
2007-02-19T06:32:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	but i can count the number of people here who share their ubuntu with multiple users on the fingers of one finger
2007-02-19T06:33:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	so it hardly matters
2007-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	frontends to dpkg, rather
2009-02-22T06:06:00.000Z	adaptr	jrib	he asked a very astute meta-question
