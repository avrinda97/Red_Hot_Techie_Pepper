2005-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	Chiacomo		I've got some total noob questions... Anyone up for it?
2005-08-24T08:27:00.000Z	Chiacomo		A good friend of mine recomended kubuntu for a desktop/general computing machine at my home (rather than slackware)... I'd never considered linux as a desktop operating system (for home use)... Seems very cool... I'm having trouble with sound.
2005-08-24T08:27:00.000Z	Chiacomo		Now, I'm trying this out on a terribly old Dell GX1so I'm not surprised I have not sound... Any clues on drivers, etc? Where should I start?
2005-08-24T08:28:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 show me the output of: lsmod | grep snd
2005-08-24T08:29:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 also show me the output of: dmesg | grep -i audio
2005-08-24T08:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 have you seen anything i have said to you?
2005-08-24T08:30:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	Yeah...
2005-08-24T08:31:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	Nothing from either grep... Hrm... I suppose that's bad.
2005-08-24T08:31:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 means your onboard sound is disabled, try going into the bios and checking to see if it's not disabled there.
2005-08-24T08:31:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	So, should detect something if sound is turned on, right?
2005-08-24T08:44:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 any luck, m8?
2005-08-24T08:45:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	Okey... Sound is enabled... But when KDE starts, I get an error that says "Error when initializing sound driver: device /dev/dsp can't be opened (No such file or directory)"
2005-08-24T08:46:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base && sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa-utils
2005-08-24T08:48:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	It asked me to choose one of three options (always autosave, autosave once, and never save)... Then it ran for a second and returned me to a prompt.. What now?
2005-08-24T08:52:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	Sorry to be a bother, but what now? I'm returned to a prompt after choosing always autosave...
2005-08-25T09:56:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	Thanks for your help yesterday -- ended up getting my sound going... :D
2005-08-25T09:56:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Chiacomo	 anytime :)
2005-08-25T09:57:00.000Z	Chiacomo	PurpleMotion	Anytime? really? Sound is working but Audacity can't seem to handle it...
