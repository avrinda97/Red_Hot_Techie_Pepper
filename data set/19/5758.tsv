2009-04-20T17:16:00.000Z	zamba		i have a problem with storing files on a cifs mounted share.. problem is that the files are stored as nobody/nogroup with umask 0022.. openoffice is confused by this, since it then opens the file as read-only.. how can i fix this?
2009-04-20T17:18:00.000Z	zamba		ubuntu reports that i can download a new restricted driver for my graphics card.. problem is that i have no user that's able to log into X to get the prompt/info for this.. how can i figure out what drivers are available from CLI?
2009-04-20T17:19:00.000Z	zamba		so i can install the package on all systems?
