2009-01-22T00:36:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		Using a X86_64 system, I've tried to install SWFDec, GNash and even the more default Adobe Non-free Flash plugin, non of them works, and now after trying each one separately, I've got them all installed and no matter what I can't get flash to play in my F3 browser... any ideas?
2009-01-22T00:37:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	just deinstall all flash instead of flash-plugin-nonfree
2009-01-22T00:38:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	what do you mean exactly? uninstall all *except* non-free? please note, that I'm reiterating that I've each separately ...
2009-01-22T00:38:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	meaning, if one didn't work, then I uninstalled it and then tried the next one... repeating the process
2009-01-22T00:40:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	ok. i have only the flashplugin nonfree installed. look in ff about:plugins to see which flash plugin is installed
2009-01-22T00:43:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	I'm not familiar with that command listing... under Totem, it lists basic plugins, one of which is flash: video/flv after removing nonfree, I don't even see the GNash or SWFdec plugins that I installed via browser... weird
2009-01-22T00:44:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	i just tiped in the address location about:plugins in FF.
2009-01-22T00:45:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	I'm familiar with *how to type it in* :) I'm saying I'm not familiar with its listing or what it represents... for example, do you have a Totem section as a result of the command?
2009-01-22T00:48:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	sry ;) yes, i have a totem section with the following: http://paste.ubuntu.com/107926/
2009-01-22T00:48:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	ok... can you show me the section where you see it listing the nonfree plugin?
2009-01-22T00:49:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	because I had it installed and when performing that command, I didn't see it listed...
2009-01-22T00:50:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	http://paste.ubuntu.com/107928/ look there. ist it like in your browser?
2009-01-22T00:51:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	yea.. that's how mine looks... I don't understand this...
2009-01-22T00:51:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	after installing flash and deinstalling it, you quitted your browser?
2009-01-22T00:53:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	yep, cleared cache & cookies, the whole bit...
2009-01-22T00:54:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	sorry , so i have no idea. did you searched the web for your problem? surely yes i think
2009-01-22T00:54:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		 ortsvorsteher yep... I'll keep hunting I guess..
2009-01-22T00:54:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	ortsvorsteher	thank you for your time :)
2009-01-22T00:55:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	CaptainMorgan	youre welcome :)
