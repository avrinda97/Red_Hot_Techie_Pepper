2009-10-25T19:56:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	cd ?
2012-11-06T02:45:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	hmm, I thought byobu was a screen thing, not tmux :/
2012-11-06T02:46:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	actually it seems to work with both :P
2012-11-06T02:46:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	I was just about to write that it can run with both.
2012-11-06T02:49:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	you probably need to provide more details; I'm not even sure what exactly the issue is
2012-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	the issue is, that at somepoint I'm not allowed in my own home directory anymore, then I can cd out to / and then back, and then suddenly I can do things again. My script uses a module which mimicks the `mkdir -p` and that fails, it also shows when Im editing the script and cleanly exits vim then the .swp file is not deleted. I have no idea why or how it happened, no one else is using this machine right
2012-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	does this happen several times?  About how often?
2012-11-06T02:54:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	I started the script about at 14:00 and it crashed at 18:00, it has happened before, but in general it runs for quite a while and then fails.
2012-11-06T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	I was going to pursue that, yes.
2012-11-06T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	but if you're leaving screen running under your user, I don't see why the directory would get unmounted
2012-11-06T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	is it happening now so we can investigate?
2012-11-06T02:57:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	Unfortunately I already cd'ed out and back in.
2012-11-06T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	what ubuntu version by the way?
2012-11-06T03:00:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	Next time it happens(assuming it does), do you have any ides as to how to diagnose it? I'm running 12.04.1
2012-11-06T03:01:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	could it be as simple as checking whether the volume is mounted?
2012-11-06T03:01:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	honestly, I'd just check for interesting output from dmesg, mount, and ls.  I would also consider seeing if it happens on a part of your filesystem that isn't encrypted.  It seems very strange that "cd" just seems to fix things tbh
2012-11-06T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	nwillems	exactly
2012-11-06T03:15:00.000Z	nwillems	jrib	Well I'm starting it here over night and then I'll look at it in the morning, hopefully it will run without errors :-)
