2007-05-04T16:46:00.000Z	Adam314		I wrote it in perl.
2007-05-04T16:47:00.000Z	Adam314		I didn't like perl at first, but after a little usage - i really like it.
2007-05-04T16:48:00.000Z	Adam314		I wanted the backup to just sync one folder to another: copy any new/changed files, delete any deleted files.  No compression.  Not 1 big file
2007-05-04T16:48:00.000Z	Adam314		I didn't find one that does this, so i wrote it myself.
2007-05-04T16:50:00.000Z	Adam314		Yes.  Instead of comparing the dest files to the source files, it keeps a list of what it copied.  It then looks at the source (eg: /home) and compares that to it's file.  This makes for less traffic (the destination is on anohter computer across a network)
2007-05-04T16:51:00.000Z	Adam314		Unless i'm wrong, rsync compares the actual files... and since the backup dir is on anohter computer, it has to copy the file over before it can check if it's changed
2007-05-04T16:52:00.000Z	Adam314		if you have programming experience, perl is not that hard to learn.
2007-05-04T16:52:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	no, rsync compares chunk checksums
2007-05-04T16:53:00.000Z	Adam314	vorbote	how does it get the chunk checksum though?  eg: i'm backing up /home   to   /mnt/pc2/backup.
2007-05-04T16:54:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	Each rsync acts both as a client and a server, they exchange checksum lists over the network
2007-05-04T16:55:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	In fact it is a very clever algorithm that does finger printing. You can use pure checksum digests (md5, I think) but that's more CPU intensive.
2007-05-04T16:56:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	if you are copying files from the remote to the local, you are certainly copying the files first.
2007-05-04T16:57:00.000Z	Adam314	vorbote	the local computer is ubuntu, and I want to back it up to a windows 2000.  The backup script is running on the ubuntu computer.  Would rsync work for this?
2007-05-04T16:59:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	I'd set up the rsync server in ubuntu and run rsync under cygwin in the w2k box to bring the files over. That would be much efficient (and fast)
2007-05-04T05:00:00.000Z	Adam314	vorbote	so i start rsync server on ubuntu, then install a cygwin rsync on the windows computer.  Then i use windows computer to run the rsync program?
2007-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	correct
2007-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	Adam314	vorbote	thanks... i'll look into that.
2007-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	vorbote	Adam314	You can set up the rsync server in such a way that it only listens in the LAN behind your NAT, so it ican be sage.
2007-05-04T05:02:00.000Z	Adam314	vorbote	I tell it which IPs to listen to?  What do I need to do for that (or will it be obvious once i read the man pages)?
