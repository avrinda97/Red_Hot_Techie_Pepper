2007-11-05T02:04:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		well everybody, i got my laptop all setup with vista/ubuntu dual-boot.  glad i got it done!
2007-11-05T02:05:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		bogus84: what isn't working with your wep key?
2007-11-05T02:06:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		rodgo just ask
2007-11-05T02:07:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		bogus84: are you making sure your selection is on the right setting?  comes up default asking for passphrase
2007-11-05T02:09:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		bogus84: i'd say check your wep settings and see what the passphrase is and just use that.  finds the wep anyways and saves it for the keyring, should be golden
2007-11-05T02:11:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		sinsisterben: run into windows and run DISKEEPER
2007-11-05T02:11:00.000Z	sinisterben	fatcatmatt	did that
2007-11-05T02:11:00.000Z	sinisterben	fatcatmatt	I also used Perfect Disk
2007-11-05T02:11:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	sinisterben	ignore it then, nothing's perfect lol
2007-11-05T02:12:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		bradel: try unplugging it and plug it back in
2007-11-05T02:12:00.000Z	sinisterben	fatcatmatt	it won't allow me to create a new partition, or at least I think it won't
2007-11-05T02:12:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ditch windows then or do a clean install of it :)
2007-11-05T02:12:00.000Z	sinisterben	fatcatmatt	lol of course that would be the perfect world situation no? I however do need some of those programs still.
2007-11-05T02:13:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	sinisterben	hmm...maybe with diskeeper, do a boot-time defrag ?? used to have to do them all the time, but they take forever
2007-11-05T02:13:00.000Z	sinisterben	fatcatmatt	ok thank you.
2007-11-05T02:14:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	sinisterben	yeah...have u tried using wine for some of those programs?
2007-11-05T02:14:00.000Z	sinisterben		bigfuzzyjesus, that is what I am using
2007-11-05T02:14:00.000Z	sinisterben	fatcatmatt	when I say I need them they are games ;)
2007-11-05T02:15:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	sinisterben	ahh...most likely WOW then :)
