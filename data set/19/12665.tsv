2005-07-26T07:37:00.000Z	tritium	bina	it's always good to do a search so you know which packages to install.  You can search with synaptic, or apt-cache search <searchterm>
2006-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	tritium	bina	nope
2006-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	bina	tritium	phew :) thanks
2006-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	tritium	bina	you should have kubuntu-desktop instead
2006-06-20T07:46:00.000Z	bina	tritium	i do i think.  its just i tried to install gaim beta 3 though apt and apt got rid of ubuntu-desktop :S
2006-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	bina	from what repository?
2006-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	bina	tritium	oh actually it was dpkg i used first but then it failed due to a dep so i had to do apt-get -f install, which got rid of it
2006-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	bina	tritium	http://mighmos.org/packages.php thats where i got the file from
2006-06-20T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	bina	okay, that's not an official repo, as you're probably aware
2006-06-20T07:49:00.000Z	bina	tritium	yeah, i was going to build it myself but somethings up with my GTK, which causes some kind of syntax error when configure tries to build the test program
2006-06-20T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	bina	you have the proper -dev libraries instaleld?
2006-06-20T07:50:00.000Z	bina	tritium	yeah i think so, apt-get install libgtk-dev and such kept saying that its the newest version
2006-06-22T15:50:00.000Z	tritium	bina	yes, smartmontools
2006-06-22T15:51:00.000Z	bina	tritium	sweet thanks
2006-06-24T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	bina	apt-get install --reinstall <package>
2006-06-24T11:03:00.000Z	bina	tritium	thanks
2006-06-24T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	bina	you'll have to use sudo, of coursse
