2008-05-27T23:02:00.000Z	SliMM		hello
2008-05-27T23:04:00.000Z	SliMM		i have made a minor modification to the Romanian keyboard layout that is quite important in respect to ortographic norms
2008-05-27T23:04:00.000Z	SliMM		is there a way I can make this modification available for the future updates (or versions of ubuntu)
2008-05-27T23:04:00.000Z	SliMM		?
2008-05-27T23:06:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	keyboard layout important for ortographic norms??? just curious.. what does "ortographic norms" mean?
2008-05-27T23:07:00.000Z	SliMM	Slart	ortographic doesn't also mean the way you write letters?
2008-05-27T23:07:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	ahh.. nevermind..looked it up.. thought you were talking about 3d projections and such..
2008-05-27T23:07:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	it does indeed
2008-05-27T23:08:00.000Z	SliMM	Slart	not orthogonal or whatever >_<
2008-05-27T23:08:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	=)
2008-05-27T23:08:00.000Z	SliMM	Slart	so, any ideas?
2008-05-27T23:08:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	not unless you know which package the file is from..
2008-05-27T23:09:00.000Z	SliMM	Slart	it's just the "ro" keyboard layout file
2008-05-27T23:09:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	you could try using apt-file to see what package it's from.. then mail the developer
2008-05-27T23:09:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	there is a utility called apt-file that searches packages for filenames
2008-05-27T23:09:00.000Z	SliMM	Slart	thanks
2008-05-27T23:11:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	shutdown -r now? only way of booting from a cd that I know of.. unless you're talking about a vm
2008-05-27T23:12:00.000Z	SliMM	Slart	my BIOS is... broken, quite difficult to boot from a CD (actually I find it impossible)
2008-05-27T23:13:00.000Z	Slart	SliMM	hmm... I don't think there's a lot you can do from ubuntu to change that..
