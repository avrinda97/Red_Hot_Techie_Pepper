2004-12-02T12:56:00.000Z	FTTP		the truth about linux is that all the highly advanced stuff was developed by corporations like at&t or stuff like berkley
2004-12-02T12:56:00.000Z	FTTP		linux cant develop anything advanced
2004-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	maskie	FTTP	you right since Linux is only a kernel in any case so it is not suppose to develop :)
