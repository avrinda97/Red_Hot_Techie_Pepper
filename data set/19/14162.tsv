2004-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	Gmail		anyone one want to host a unoffical ubuntu-compatible responsory
2004-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	You're going to run a Ubuntu backports site?
2004-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	yea
2004-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	Heh I would but I can't afford the bandwidth... I assume it'd eat up over 20 gigs a month.
2004-11-04T09:54:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	well donations
2004-11-04T09:55:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	I'd be willing to help administer it and so on but I don't think I could front money for it at first. Plus it'd be hard to raise cash before it exists.
2004-11-04T11:05:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	no debian is the best and ubuntu is the best bread od debian
2004-11-04T11:08:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	Well the official release has been out for what, a week?

2004-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	I'd do it myself
2004-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	Those aren't particularly hard to port.
2004-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	And I'm sure they will turn up in Hoary
2004-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	i mean for now
2004-11-04T11:35:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	and they are the newer version of some apps i want
2004-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	Then go and compile and install them already
2004-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	No one is going to do it for you unless you wait for Hoary!
2004-11-04T11:39:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	i said i am doing them
2004-11-04T11:39:00.000Z	brettcar	Gmail	Set up a repository and post it to ubuntu-users@lists
2004-11-04T11:40:00.000Z	Gmail	brettcar	dont you understand, i am asking while i am port, if any one *here* want some other app to the one i am already porting, ported
