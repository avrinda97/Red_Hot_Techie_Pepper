2009-03-09T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	VLC?
2009-03-09T06:23:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	it's useful instructions revelant to what you've asked.
2009-03-09T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	but out of curiosity, what is this application that needs to be run with X?
2009-03-09T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	uhm, i'm sure there's a good few stream capturing possibilities without using a GUI... actually it's the last thing i'd think of using a GUI for.
2009-03-09T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	live streams you mean video, right?
2009-03-09T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	well VLC should be fine, no?
2009-03-09T06:31:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2009-03-09T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	(if you're using gdm as your login manager)
2009-03-09T06:37:00.000Z	LjL	BrandonB	actually, DOS has "md", not "mkdir"
