2011-11-11T02:49:00.000Z	Forage_		I'm playing around with the LiveCD and I'd like to disable the auto login and be presented with lightdm and the option to choose between unity 2d/3d. As suggested at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1219099 I removed  /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/15autologin and executed "sudo update-initramfs -u"  but this did not do the trick
2011-11-11T02:50:00.000Z	Forage_		how should I disable the auto login of the livecd?
2011-11-11T02:52:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	on the livecd you can't disable it
2011-11-11T02:52:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	:-(
2011-11-11T02:53:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	is there any other way to get a login screen after boot, or a different way to choose which shell it should use?
2011-11-11T02:54:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	once you get to the desktop, logout then you get back to the login screen
2011-11-11T02:54:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	there is no logout option in the menu?
2011-11-11T02:55:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	apparently I was wrong sorry, haven't used a livecd for some time
2011-11-11T03:01:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	already told you that's not possible
2011-11-11T03:05:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	only way I can think of (and I really don't think it's going to work) is to run "killall gnome-session" in a terminal
2011-11-11T03:11:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	the first solution suggested on the thread you mentioned cannot work, the second one maybe but that would mean rebuilding the live cd yourself, I don't think that's what you want to do
2011-11-11T03:12:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	indeed, rebuilding is beyond the purpose of testing
2011-11-11T03:47:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	that's it!
2011-11-11T03:48:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	nice :)
2011-11-11T03:48:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	I still get presented with a try/install dialog first, but ow well
2011-11-11T03:49:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	thanks again for helping. Off to continue testing now
2011-11-11T03:49:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage_	you're welcome. Have fun !
2011-11-11T04:17:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	there's still some more stuff fixed. Selecting an alternative shell at the login screen has no effect, the defaul unity will always be loaded
2011-11-11T04:17:00.000Z	Forage_	glebihan	any idea where that is being forced?
