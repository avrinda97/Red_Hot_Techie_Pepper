2011-11-06T13:51:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	you still there?
2011-11-06T13:53:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	first, boot to that "DOS like" screen
2011-11-06T13:54:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	then run three commands follow
2011-11-06T13:54:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	linux /vmlinuz
2011-11-06T13:55:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	initrd /initrd.img
2011-11-06T13:55:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	boot
2011-11-06T13:56:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	you installed ubuntu on Virtual machine?
2011-11-06T13:57:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	oh, I see. does it booting now?
2011-11-06T13:58:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	hmm, just a min, maybe I forgot the root option :))
2011-11-06T13:59:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	haha, you also need the root option too, my bad
2011-11-06T13:59:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	where did you install your ubuntu? sda1 or what else?
2011-11-06T14:00:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	now, you need reboot, retype the three commands before, just change thee first command to linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1
2011-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	not yet, after log in, you must run the following command to update grub, "sudo update-grub"
2011-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	that's all ;)
2011-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Stanley00	Taure	good luck! kk
