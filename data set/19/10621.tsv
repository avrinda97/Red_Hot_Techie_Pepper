2012-11-10T09:12:00.000Z	Dogget		Lonewulf: Thanks for the link but alas it's not for 12.10. I had no problems with the drivers on 12.04 by the way
2012-11-10T09:12:00.000Z	Dogget		I feel 12.10 is really laggy, taking seconds to open a window and all while on 12.04 it was straight.
2012-11-10T09:13:00.000Z	Dogget		I am currently running 12.10 but everything is so slow
2012-11-10T09:13:00.000Z	Dogget		I haven't done anything yet after the third reinstall
2012-11-10T09:14:00.000Z	Dogget		:-( damn
2012-11-10T09:14:00.000Z	Dogget		in 12.04 64 bits it was all fine as well
2012-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	Dogget		12.10 runs like a turtle!
2012-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	Dogget		Same for me in 12.04 I am talking about 12.10 Lone :-)
2012-11-10T09:16:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	what does "top" say?
2012-11-10T09:16:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	in the terminal
2012-11-10T09:17:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	"top" tells you what process uses how much CPU, memory etc.
2012-11-10T09:17:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	so you might find out where the entropy goes ....
2012-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	well, try to sort top either by CPU or mem, and you'll see
2012-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	oh! - I see
2012-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	are you on unity 3D?
2012-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	try to desactivate the effects
2012-11-10T09:19:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	Alt+F2 ccsm
2012-11-10T09:20:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	Sure. But your issue seems to be with the graphics....
2012-11-10T09:22:00.000Z	lix	Dogget	yes. - try Alt+F2 ccsm
