2007-11-04T22:15:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	chmod somethingelse
2007-11-04T22:16:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	got no idea what u said :P
2007-11-04T22:16:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	you have to chmod with different numbers than 666
2007-11-04T22:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	so what is the number to remove 666
2007-11-04T22:17:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	666 = owner, group and everyone read write.   (the numbers go UGO, eg 600 will be owner readwrite, group + everyone nothing)
2007-11-04T22:17:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	you can't "remove" it - you can only change it
2007-11-04T22:17:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	what permissions do you want the file to have ?
2007-11-04T22:18:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	actually there is a folder in ntfs drive that has lock on the folder.
2007-11-04T22:18:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	so i chmod 666 it so give read/write.
2007-11-04T22:18:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	666 will give EVERYONE on the machine readwrite
2007-11-04T22:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	but read/write is not happening
2007-11-04T22:19:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	what file is it ? did you check the file with ls -l ?
2007-11-04T22:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	and the lock is removed.
2007-11-04T22:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	music
2007-11-04T22:19:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	music?
2007-11-04T22:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	mp3 files are in the folder
2007-11-04T22:20:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	you need to make folders have execute permission too - try making music 755
2007-11-04T22:21:00.000Z	linxeh	murlidhar	chmod 755 music
2007-11-04T22:23:00.000Z	murlidhar	linxeh	the lock on the folder is back . and the owner is root
