2012-03-24T22:55:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	? do you mean what program is run when you select Applications/.../terminal??
2012-03-24T22:57:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	thanks i've been have this kind of problem with a lot on program with out gui's
2012-03-24T23:00:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	dpkg -L clamav
2012-03-24T23:01:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	so just list the files and find it that way?
2012-03-24T23:01:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	that's what I do
2012-03-24T23:02:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	so you do that everything you get a package without a gui?
2012-03-24T23:02:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	no, just when I want to see what got installed where.
2012-03-24T23:03:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	so do dpkg look for files with whatever name you give it?
2012-03-24T23:04:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	do a dpkg -l | grep clamav to see what's installed.
2012-03-24T23:04:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	then do a dpkg -L xxx where xxx is the name of the package you want to examin.
2012-03-24T23:05:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	No, most files are elsewhere but the executables are in /usr/bin/ nhormally
2012-03-24T23:05:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	 take paticular notice of the file in the .../man/... directory.
2012-03-24T23:06:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	that will tell you want man pages are there
2012-03-24T23:06:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	yeah i noticed that i'm about to check it out.
2012-03-24T23:07:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	if you see man/man1/clambc.1.gz then try man clambc
2012-03-24T23:08:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	yeah i see that. so "man" will open a file with the name after it?
2012-03-24T23:09:00.000Z	gvo	nujabes	 That's an over simplication, but yes.
2012-03-24T23:09:00.000Z	nujabes	gvo	well for here it save a lot of room the chat lol
