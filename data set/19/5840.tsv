2008-04-27T05:30:00.000Z	cg91		so i tried iwconfig wlan0 essid K6VA3 as SUDO and i didnt get an error but nothing happened.. no output
2008-04-27T05:30:00.000Z	cg91		and when i ran iwconfig again it still said : any/none
2008-04-27T05:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	cg91	is it password protected?
2008-04-27T05:31:00.000Z	cg91		yes by WEP 64 HEX
2008-04-27T05:31:00.000Z	cg91		ive done all this in network manager GUI if that counts...
2008-04-27T05:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	cg91	you should input that info into the iwconfig command too
2008-04-27T05:32:00.000Z	cg91	danbhfive	do u know the syntax?
2008-04-27T05:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	cg91	no, but iwconfig --help should tell it all to you
