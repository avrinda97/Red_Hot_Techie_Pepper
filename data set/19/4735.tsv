2009-07-10T04:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp1	 thats a meta-pacakge that installs a lot of things.. and most likely you do want a few of the things it installed.. java, flash, fonts.
2009-07-10T04:05:00.000Z	needhelp1	Dr_Willis	im conserned about security..
2009-07-10T04:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp1	 its not really a security issue..
2009-07-10T04:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	needhelp1	 unless you consider flash and java to be security issues.
