2009-02-01T16:21:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	If you are running a live CD you are not installing filesw permanently
2009-02-01T16:22:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	Your OS is running off of the CD.
2009-02-01T16:26:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	You use Debian and you are asking why your liveCD does not save settings?
2009-02-01T16:27:00.000Z	sxp	Mahalo	yes
2009-02-01T16:27:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	It is not saving settings because it is runningthe OS from the CD.
2009-02-01T16:28:00.000Z	sxp	Mahalo	i understand that
2009-02-01T16:29:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	Then...? You can find any soundfiles you need online...
2009-02-01T16:29:00.000Z	sxp	Mahalo	no, because i can not access to the X
2009-02-01T16:30:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	Take note of the file that is being used, then, when you get back into your Debian OS and online just search for it.
2009-02-01T16:31:00.000Z	sxp	Mahalo	i need only to play an audio file with the console in ubuntu
2009-02-01T16:32:00.000Z	Mahalo	sxp	You want to play a file from the CD... seriosusly?
