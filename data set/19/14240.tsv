2004-12-17T13:39:00.000Z	|trey|	supergear	"for a Debian based distro"? wtf does that mean?
2004-12-17T13:39:00.000Z	supergear	|trey|	i tend to not like debian :P
2004-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	|trey|	supergear	any reason? its package management is supperior to any distro I have used...
2004-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	|trey|	supergear	pacman stalled and complained too much  :/
2004-12-17T13:41:00.000Z	|trey|	supergear	slow servers, crap packages... nothing resembling order...
2004-12-17T13:42:00.000Z	supergear	|trey|	gotta edit /etc/pacman.d/current|extra|unstable for faster servers
2004-12-17T13:42:00.000Z	|trey|	supergear	packages are ok? umm, all pacman is is a package manager...
2004-12-17T13:48:00.000Z	|trey|	supergear	I have a free lisense for w2k, xp, and virtual pc if I ever get around to it  :)
