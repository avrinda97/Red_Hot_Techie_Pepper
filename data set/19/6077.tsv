2009-05-22T19:47:00.000Z	Mortuis		Anyone know how to fix sound in the web browser?
2009-05-22T19:47:00.000Z	Mortuis		Specifically I get no sound in firefox on sites like youtube.
2009-05-22T19:48:00.000Z	Mortuis		the video works if that's what you mean?
2009-05-22T19:48:00.000Z	Mortuis		I believe I installed a .deb off adobe.com
2009-05-22T19:49:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	version of the ubuntu
2009-05-22T19:49:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	you have installed the flash player and doesnt work ??
2009-05-22T19:50:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	It was working a few days ago. I'm not sure what changed to make it not work and I'm not sure where to start looking.
2009-05-22T19:51:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	hmm remove it and then reinstall it again cuz i think ubuntu still install the flash player 9 as default
2009-05-22T19:51:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	thanks, I'll give that a shot.
2009-05-22T19:51:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	you know how to remove it right??
2009-05-22T19:54:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	no just remove them
2009-05-22T19:54:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	Okay
2009-05-22T19:57:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	The .deb on adobe.com is for 32 bit, I'm running a 64 bit. I haven't done much installing from source, but if I download the tar.gz and install from that can I remove it with synaptic if that doesn't work? Or is it uglier than that?
2009-05-22T19:58:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	donwload the tar i always do that
2009-05-22T19:58:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	alright
2009-05-22T19:59:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	It's saying "Your architecture, \'x86_64\', is not supported by the Adobe Flash Player installer."
2009-05-22T20:00:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	thanks anway, I at least have an idea what I'm looking for now.
2009-05-22T20:00:00.000Z	Dillizar	Mortuis	if you donwload the deb file maybe it will download the 64
2009-05-22T20:01:00.000Z	Mortuis	Dillizar	I tried the .deb first and it warned me that I was using the wrong architecture
