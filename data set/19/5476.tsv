2008-11-19T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	plug it in, open network manager and select "mobile broadband services"
2008-11-19T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	then cofnigure it as per your network provider
2008-11-19T15:19:00.000Z	r2s	ikonia	 already did in the Mobile Broadband settings in the Network Manager
2008-11-19T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	great, you should be good to go
2008-11-19T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	click connect
2008-11-19T15:20:00.000Z	r2s	ikonia	no connect button
2008-11-19T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	you click on the network manager applet in the trop right of the gnome desktop
2008-11-19T15:22:00.000Z	r2s	ikonia	did that but the configure I made is not visible one Left-click...
2008-11-19T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	then you've not set it up properly in the mobile broad band, or you physical hardware device is not supported
2008-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	check the hardware support of it, also check your network providers settings in the mobile broadband setup as I suggested
2008-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	r2s	not all networks auto configure
