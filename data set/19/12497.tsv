2009-09-02T10:50:00.000Z	durt	mib	feisty has not been supported for a long time now.
2009-09-02T10:50:00.000Z	mib	durt	i am aware of it but i dont have much choice. at the moment.
2009-09-02T10:51:00.000Z	durt	mib	there is an old archive for deprecated releases, point your /etc/apt/sources.list file to it.
2009-09-02T10:52:00.000Z	mib	durt	whihc one? could you show me?
2009-09-02T10:52:00.000Z	durt	mib	one sec, let me find it.

2009-09-02T11:05:00.000Z	durt	mib	http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
2009-09-02T11:08:00.000Z	mib	durt	so i copy the link to my source list?
2009-09-02T11:09:00.000Z	durt	mib	no you have to edit your sources.list file so that all the entries point to it, if you don't know how better research it a bit before you mess it up.
2009-09-02T11:10:00.000Z	durt	mib	be aware that feisty and gutsy have a major security flaw, I believe in ssl.
2009-09-02T11:11:00.000Z	mib		er.

2009-09-02T11:23:00.000Z	durt	mib	ya, there's a python-scipy and python2.4-scipy check at packages.ubuntu.com
2009-09-02T11:23:00.000Z	mib	durt	so they only not supported i feisty? if so, what is the command to install them
2009-09-02T11:25:00.000Z	durt	mib	if your on dapper (server) just 'sudo apt-get install python-scipy' , or python2.4-scipy.
