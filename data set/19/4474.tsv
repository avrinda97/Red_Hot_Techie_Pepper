2009-05-02T07:46:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	I am lousy at servers, but stick around, I am certain it will be picked up. May I ask are you using an SSH or what?
2009-05-02T07:47:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	yep, sshing into a box from rapidxen
2009-05-02T07:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	I've asked in the django chanell, but it could be a problem with my server setup and not with the code
2009-05-02T07:48:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	You have all the code right on your end. oh ok, That is where I was heading.
2009-05-02T07:49:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	yeah,  it's the exact same code that we deployed successfully on our laptop
2009-05-02T07:50:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	Yours is server and the other is Host?
2009-05-02T07:50:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	huh?
2009-05-02T07:52:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	Your box is the server?
2009-05-02T07:53:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	no, we're renting servers from rapidxen
2009-05-02T07:53:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	but we did the exact same thing on our box as we did on the server
2009-05-02T07:55:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	Ok, did you have a DHCP configuration?
2009-05-02T07:57:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	don't  know.  I never tinkered with that

2009-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	and here: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.10/serverguide/C/index.html
2009-05-02T08:06:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	we have the server all set up, just we can't seem to get our application to deploy
2009-05-02T08:07:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	Are you certain that the LAMP,MySQL or whatever you are using is a 'good' package?
2009-05-02T08:10:00.000Z	vigo	hendrixski	as I stated, I do not know much about the server thing, so I posted the links that I thought may help or be of relevance.
2009-05-02T08:11:00.000Z	hendrixski	vigo	thank you :-D
