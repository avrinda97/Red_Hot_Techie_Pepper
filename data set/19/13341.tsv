2005-05-16T15:27:00.000Z	Chameleon22		does ubuntu have php5 package?
2005-05-16T15:28:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	Nope -- it may be possible (though probably not advisable) to use the packages from debian sid.
2005-05-16T15:29:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	bah!
2005-05-16T15:29:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	Why do you want to run ubuntu on a server (or a server on your desktop?)
2005-05-16T15:30:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	running ubuntu as a desktop and as a server on a different machine
2005-05-16T15:30:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	I'd recommend you run debian sarge on the server, personally
2005-05-16T15:31:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	i was thinking that since my server used to run Sid hehehehe, Home server so thats ok. Does sarge have all the latest and greatest or is it outdated as woody?
2005-05-16T15:32:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	Sarge was just frozen a few days ago
2005-05-16T15:32:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	frozen?
2005-05-16T15:32:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	It's entering it's "ready to replace woody" stage.
2005-05-16T15:33:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	does it have php5? postgresql 8? new mysql? etc
2005-05-16T15:35:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	It has mysql 4.1, though
2005-05-16T15:35:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	what about php?
2005-05-16T15:35:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	So "no, no, yes" are the answers
2005-05-16T15:36:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	 (no php5, no postgres8, yes mysql41)
2005-05-16T15:36:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	eh will run ub... for now. Its my home server so its ok. I dont think i would put ubuntu as a server into production though
2005-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	ye compiling it is one thing but that would mean i have to recompile on every patch etc so might as well wait for a pkg
2005-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	Chameleon22	Jimbob	in general i hate using source unless its absolutely the only choise, since it hurts consistensy of the system
2005-05-16T15:39:00.000Z	Jimbob	Chameleon22	Yeah, at work we usually end up hacking together packages for the stuff that's too new for debian.
