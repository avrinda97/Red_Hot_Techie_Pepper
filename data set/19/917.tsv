2011-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	Autodidactite	Northernen	How so?
2011-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	fglrx is not working at all.
2011-07-26T11:14:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	it's not here at all.
2011-07-26T11:15:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	graphics?
2011-07-26T11:16:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	ATI Mobility Radeon HD5650. It is supposed to be fully supported.
2011-07-26T11:20:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	did you use "Additional drivers" or download from amd.com and run in manually?
2011-07-26T11:21:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	heh, not the first one to do that.
2011-07-26T11:24:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	which GPU do you have?
2011-07-26T11:29:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	not sure why it would work with you, and not with me. You've got an older GPU than I have, and the entire Mobility series were supposed to have been supported from what I believe.
2011-07-26T11:31:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	Acer. Wouldn't have bought it if I had a second chance.
2011-07-26T11:33:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	11.04. I hate Acer.
2011-07-26T11:35:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	clean.
2011-07-26T11:36:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	can't even boot now. Not even with nomodeset.
2011-07-26T11:38:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	nope. It stalls when trying to enter recovery mode.
2011-07-26T11:39:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	I know it has something to do with the xorg.conf file.
2011-07-26T11:42:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	/salute :>, can I edit xorg.conf with live CD? I thought it was just data I was allowed to edit?
2011-07-26T11:42:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	aye, believe so.
2011-07-26T11:45:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	pardon my ignorane, didn't think it was possible to edit system settings. I suppose I'll have to resort to using open source drivers.
2011-07-26T11:52:00.000Z	Northernen	Autodidactite	already dual-booting W7. Been thinking I might set up a vmware Linux for testing.
