2009-03-05T02:48:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great		does any1 exactly where the Ubuntu distribution ID value is stored? Example, Ubuntu 8.10 - where is the value '8.10' actually stored? I have loo9ked at the lsb_release function but having read the code I can't work out exactly where the program is pulling the value from
2009-03-05T02:48:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	/etc/lsb-release
2009-03-05T02:49:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	thats the python script - I don't think the actual value is stored in it, is it?
2009-03-05T02:49:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	no, it's not a script, it's a configuration file.  all configuration files are stored, in /etc, since that is the purpose of /etc.  a script that performs any function would not reside in /etc.
2009-03-05T02:52:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	/etc/issue and /etc/issue.net do not do what you think they do.
2009-03-05T02:53:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	as I have told you, it gets the value from the /etc/lsb-release file
2009-03-05T02:53:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	if you open that file and read through it, can you tell me where you see the version number?
2009-03-05T02:54:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	it's self-explanatory. if you try editing the release id, save it, then run lsb_release -a, you will see that it changes. good luck.
2009-03-05T02:58:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	ZykoticK9 guntbert - OK. As I understand it, lsb-release is a script/program that, when executed, outputs the distribution data about the operating system. The values themselves are not hardcoded in that file - if you open it and look for the release ID of your OS, it is not in there. It calculates the value by running various functions.
2009-03-05T02:59:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	no, it does not calculate it. you've read it completely wrong.
2009-03-05T03:00:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	OK, so assuming you know where I am wrong, hopefully you can tell me where it is getting that value from?
2009-03-05T03:01:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	it's not massively apparent is it.
2009-03-05T03:02:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	I have already told you where it gets the value from. You have failed to follow those steps. But, I'll point it out to you again:  in the /etc/lsb-release file (which you can look at by opening a Terminal, and then typing the following command:  cat /etc/lsb-release) you can see the variables that are clearly defined (I'm not pasting them here, since pasting is against channel guidelines, plus you can read them for yourself, and everyone els
2009-03-05T03:03:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	and, again, you can simple change a variable in the /etc/lsb-release file to something else, saving the file, then running this command again:  lsb_release -a  (please note the difference between the - and the _ ) and you will see that there is no calculation taking place.
2009-03-05T03:04:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	I'm obviously not explaining what I am trying to do properly. I will keep looking. But what I am trying to say is that  cat /etc/lsb-release does not output something that is contained in lsb-release - it outputs something that it works out frm the OS.
2009-03-05T03:04:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	oh really?  please pastebin the output of your /etc/lsb-release file and a separate pastebin of the lsb_release -a command.
2009-03-05T03:09:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	It would seem someone here has to eat some humble pie. Sorry - you are totally right. I got muddle up between the lsb_release and lsb-release!
2009-03-05T03:09:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	Gnea	So I can now recode my app to look at /etc/lsb-release directly instead of lsb_release
2009-03-05T03:09:00.000Z	Gnea	gizmo_the_great	excellent :)
