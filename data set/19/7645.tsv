2007-07-19T15:03:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	how did you install the driver?
2007-07-19T15:04:00.000Z	cybrhuman	mc44	package manager, the one that gnome uses.
2007-07-19T15:04:00.000Z	cybrhuman	mc44	synaptic is it?
2007-07-19T15:04:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	yes, which driver did you install...?
2007-07-19T15:06:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	what error do you get on startup?
2007-07-19T15:07:00.000Z	cybrhuman	mc44	when the ubuntu loading screen displeys it goes blank afterwards...
2007-07-19T15:07:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	blank.? you get text? and error? a prompt...?
2007-07-19T15:07:00.000Z	cybrhuman	mc44	I am able to log on in text mode
2007-07-19T15:08:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	did you mess with your xorg when you installed the driveR?
2007-07-19T15:09:00.000Z	cybrhuman	mc44	i executed an instruction for enabling that driver (command came up after instaling the package), I got a error message there i think but I thought it didnt mean so much...
2007-07-19T15:10:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	ok do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and choose the "nv" driver and the defaults for everything else
2007-07-19T15:10:00.000Z	cybrhuman	mc44	thanks, i will try that
2007-07-19T15:11:00.000Z	mc44	cybrhuman	then run startx to get into the gui
