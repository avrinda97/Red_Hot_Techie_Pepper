2011-06-17T22:52:00.000Z	iNethack		During installation of Ubuntu 11.04, it doesn't detect Windows 7 x64 - is this a known issue? I'm using a SAMSUNG AHCI SATA hard drive
2011-06-17T22:53:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	iNethack	After installation, did you try, from a terminal, sudo update-grub?
2011-06-17T22:53:00.000Z	iNethack	Sidewinder1	No because it doesn't detect Windows 7, it only gives me the option to format the drive
2011-06-17T22:54:00.000Z	iNethack		And I don't want to format the entire drive
2011-06-17T22:54:00.000Z	iNethack		It doesn't give me the option of using the free space on the drive, and it also says that the drive is 320GB of free space

2011-06-17T22:55:00.000Z	iNethack	Sidewinder1	It doesn't give me the option of using the free space on the drive, and it also says that the drive is 320GB of free space
2011-06-17T22:57:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	iNethack	Once you boot to LiveCD, have you tried to use "Gparted" to check your partitions to make sure that you have at least one logical drive that is formatted to ext3/ext4 to install ubuntu, to?
2011-06-17T22:58:00.000Z	iNethack	Sidewinder1	it says my drive is 320GB of free space
2011-06-17T22:58:00.000Z	iNethack	Sidewinder1	which its clearly not, given that W7 x64 is installed and working on there
2011-06-17T23:02:00.000Z	iNethack		!tab
2011-06-17T23:02:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	iNethack	What you need to do is use the Win7, defrag function and defrag it at least twice; then shrink it to the final size that you need for the NTFS partition. Then using Gparted from LiveCD make a new logical partition and format it to ext3/ext4 and install ubuintu there. Make sure that you back-up all data from your NTFS partition prior to doing the above.
2011-06-17T23:03:00.000Z	iNethack	Sidewinder1	I can't do that! GParted says my drive is 320GB of free space
2011-06-17T23:03:00.000Z	iNethack	Sidewinder1	so if I try to format it, it will format the entire drive. I can't create partitions or anything
2011-06-17T23:04:00.000Z	iNethack		Just FYI my drive is 320GB in size
2011-06-17T23:05:00.000Z	iNethack		ill be back in a min, ill try it again
2011-06-17T23:05:00.000Z	iNethack		brb

Even though it's a little old I'm sure it'll point you in the right direction to totally solve most of your problems. Unfortunately IRC is not the best place to start with multiple problems; especially if you're just getting started with Ubuntu. There is a significant learning
