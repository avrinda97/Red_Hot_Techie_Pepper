2009-01-16T08:42:00.000Z	neil_d		when I list the file I get "-????????? ? ?    ?          ?                ? status" :( what do I do?
2009-01-16T08:42:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	is it on a network volume?
2009-01-16T08:43:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	no! local HDD
2009-01-16T08:43:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	have you allowed fsck to run?
2009-01-16T08:43:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	I haven't stoped it, is there a way to get it to run?
2009-01-16T08:44:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	do you know what disk device /var is on?
2009-01-16T08:44:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	yes
2009-01-16T08:46:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	the /var is part of / and that is on a raid 1->lvm
2009-01-16T08:48:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	you have to tell it to force a fsck next time you reboot
2009-01-16T08:48:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	shutdown -F -r should do it
2009-01-16T08:48:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	I figured it would be something like that, but how do you do it.
2009-01-16T08:49:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	trying to find out specifically.
2009-01-16T08:49:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	or, touch /forcefsck
2009-01-16T08:49:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	then reboot
2009-01-16T08:50:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	shutdown doesn't appear to have a -F option
2009-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	or, touch /forcefsck
2009-01-16T08:52:00.000Z	neil_d	runderwo	having a hard time find forcecheck file
2009-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	runderwo	neil_d	or, touch /forcefsck <--
