2006-09-26T10:20:00.000Z	txoof		I'm attempting to apt-get packages from the multiverse.  I've added the multiverse lines to /etc/apt/sources.list but the packages don't appear in dselect and apt-get can't find them.  Any ideas where I should start with this problem?
2006-09-26T10:21:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	"sudo apt-get update"
2006-09-26T10:21:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	it claimst that it is hitting backports/multiverse, but I still can't find the pacages.
2006-09-26T10:22:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	what package is that?

2006-09-26T10:22:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	it's supposed to be in dapper, but I can't find it.
2006-09-26T10:22:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	can you put your sources.list on the pastebin?
2006-09-26T10:23:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	sure can.  What's the link to the pastebin?
2006-09-26T10:25:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	I posted the relevant stuff.
2006-09-26T10:25:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	what's the link? (and hold on a moment, 'cause for some reason i can't connect to the pastebin)
2006-09-26T10:26:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	ok, nevermind, connected and found it
2006-09-26T10:26:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	here's a link to the entire file: http://txoof.ath.cx/sources.list
2006-09-26T10:27:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	can't load that one either, my connection is acting up... but i got to downlaod the pastebin one. is that your *entire* sources.list? it's a bit short, and it only lists backports, not multiverse?
2006-09-26T10:28:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	that's just the line that lists the multiverse section.
2006-09-26T10:28:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	you have to enable the multiverse part *of the dapper repository*, not of the dapper-backports repository
2006-09-26T10:28:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	I see that now.
2006-09-26T10:29:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	every repository (dapper, dapper-backports, dapper-etcetc) has the "main", "universe", "multiverse" etc sections
2006-09-26T10:29:00.000Z	txoof	LjL	where can I find a link to the proper multiverse entry?
2006-09-26T10:29:00.000Z	LjL	txoof	so if you only enable multiverse in dapper-backports, you only get the packages from multiverse *that have been backported* (which, i guess, is next to zero)
