2010-01-29T05:26:00.000Z	novato_br		first problem: webcam ( ID 5986:0241 ) from my notebook positivo premium, to solve this problem I've tried to install uvcdriver and patched it, but it didn't work. So they told me that I could try to use ndiswrapper to install the webcam. But I can't do that without internet no notebook
2010-01-29T05:26:00.000Z	novato_br		s/on in*
2010-01-29T05:27:00.000Z	novato_br		so, I tried to make a network between desktop ( win7 ) and notebook (ubuntu 9.10) => it didn't working too
2010-01-29T05:27:00.000Z	novato_br		so, I thought a lot things to solve this problem with local internet
2010-01-29T05:28:00.000Z	novato_br		and I didn't know to solve
2010-01-29T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 run a tempary cable -  is proberly the easiest way
2010-01-29T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 clarify what dosetn work exactly then.
2010-01-29T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 ive never heard of it being used for webcams
2010-01-29T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 then it may fall in the 'totally unsupported' catagory
2010-01-29T05:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 on ubuntu 9.10? or some other disrto?
2010-01-29T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 whats that from? dmesg output? thats just shows its detected the device.. dosent mean its supported.
2010-01-29T05:35:00.000Z	novato_br	Dr_Willis	when I make lsmod |grep uvcdriver => it shows nothing
2010-02-21T05:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 i notices some issues with vlc the other day and some video files - they were not playjng properly on the netbook. gnom-mplayer handled them fine however..
2010-02-21T05:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 not sure what format they are. They were HD. video i know.
2010-02-21T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 yep. testing vlc in 9.10 right now. lets see if its better
2010-02-21T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 vlc on 9.10 is not having the same issues.. so perhaps the next vlc will work better  :)
2010-02-21T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 there are vlc daily build ppa's i think
2010-02-21T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 it magically works :)
2010-02-21T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	novato_br	 wonder if somthing else was sucking down too much cpu?
