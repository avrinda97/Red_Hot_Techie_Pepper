2007-05-26T07:05:00.000Z	tobyr		Hey guys
2007-05-26T07:05:00.000Z	tobyr		Is there a way to Net Send in Linux?
2007-05-26T07:05:00.000Z	tobyr		Like you can in windows?
2007-05-26T07:05:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	what is net send?
2007-05-26T07:06:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	oh, yea
2007-05-26T07:06:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	smbclient supports that
2007-05-26T07:06:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	wait.. mabye it's not smbclient
2007-05-26T07:07:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	do you mean literally sending a message to windows machines, or you want a work-alike for linux machines
2007-05-26T07:08:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	linpopup - X Window System port of Winpopup, running over Samba
2007-05-26T07:09:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	smbclient allows you to send from a command line
2007-05-26T07:11:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	echo "message
2007-05-26T07:11:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	echo "message" | smbclient -M HOST
2007-05-26T07:12:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	the only dificulty is adding all the extra bits to authenticate as administrator
2007-05-26T07:13:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	ermm.. kinda
2007-05-26T07:13:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	normally I would just login to the AP and list associated links
2007-05-26T07:13:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	but you could tcpdump the wireless device and sniff for who's sending packets
2007-05-26T07:14:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	but that's not a "for sure who is connected" way of doing it
2007-05-26T07:14:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	heh
2007-05-26T07:14:00.000Z	SuperQ	tobyr	there are tools to try and guess the manufacture of the device based on the MAC address
