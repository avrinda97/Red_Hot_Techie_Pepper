2009-04-11T03:53:00.000Z	aboleth		is there something fundamentally wrong with my thinking or something, because i don't see why no one thought of anything like this.
2009-04-11T03:54:00.000Z	aboleth		any responses?\
2009-04-11T03:54:00.000Z	aboleth		does anyone think my idea for changing the package manager is good?

2009-04-11T03:55:00.000Z	aboleth		i really would like some help with this
2009-04-11T03:55:00.000Z	aboleth		people just don't seem to be giving me any attention
2009-04-11T03:55:00.000Z	aboleth		not just today
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	aboleth		i was trying to get help a few times on the irc channel a few times before
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	aboleth		i either talked to no one or someone who knew less than i did
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	aboleth		sometimes frustratingly so
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	proq	aboleth	some unix distros *do* just grab updates automatically from sources
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	aboleth		i bet that'll get answered before me
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	aboleth	proq	which ones?
2009-04-11T03:56:00.000Z	proq	aboleth	openbsd
2009-04-11T03:57:00.000Z	proq	aboleth	gentoo as well
2009-04-11T03:57:00.000Z	aboleth	proq	why is that not seen as superior?
2009-04-11T03:57:00.000Z	aboleth		i mean
2009-04-11T03:57:00.000Z	aboleth		besides the source thing, but you don't need to do that
2009-04-11T03:57:00.000Z	proq	aboleth	because building sources takes a lot of energy and that takes time and money
