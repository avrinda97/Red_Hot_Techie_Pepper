2006-09-05T11:59:00.000Z	MTecknology		I think I'm going to have to screw Linux for my needs... I'll see you all later :)

2006-09-05T12:01:00.000Z	MTecknology		I've been looking and looking, but not finding any way to solve my issues
2006-09-05T12:01:00.000Z	XxXBrAnDoNXxX		Linux is way better than windows
2006-09-05T12:01:00.000Z	XxXBrAnDoNXxX	MTecknology	what issues?
2006-09-05T12:02:00.000Z	MTecknology	XxXBrAnDoNXxX	Wireless at DSU and using two monitors
2006-09-05T12:02:00.000Z	MTecknology		I think I'll use Windows and play Winth Ubuntu in VMWare until I get the stuff working, then use my backup
2006-09-05T12:02:00.000Z	MTecknology		i have a FULL backup of where I am now
2006-09-05T12:03:00.000Z	XxXBrAnDoNXxX	MTecknology	lol, ya linux hardware compatiblity is a little behind...

2006-09-05T12:03:00.000Z	XxXBrAnDoNXxX	MTecknology	I use windows only for games, the rest is all linux.
2006-09-05T12:03:00.000Z	MTecknology		I love Linux, it's very highly productive, when it works.
2006-09-05T12:04:00.000Z	MTecknology		it's not working, i need to figure out how to make it work, but I need something working until I get there.
2006-09-05T12:04:00.000Z	XxXBrAnDoNXxX	MTecknology	I never used 2 moniters.
