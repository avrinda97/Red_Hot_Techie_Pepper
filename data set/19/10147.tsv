2006-08-05T05:52:00.000Z	urakaipa		yep sethk, but as far as i know could be that the filesystem header was different that the real one (0xfd for software raid) and i think that software like gpart canno scan for this
2006-08-05T05:53:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	that's possible.  It would be easy enough to change that byte, and also easy to look at it.
2006-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	urakaipa	sethk	the problem is that i don't have the partition listed no more
2006-08-05T06:00:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	yes, I know, but if you know where the partition was (the starting and ending sectors) the partition table is easy to fix
2006-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	urakaipa	sethk	how can i fix it? because gpart was not able to list me useful partitions (just old ones)
2006-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	you dump the mbr and use a hex editor
2006-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	the partitions are the last four groups of 16 bytes in the mbr
2006-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	you can also use fdisk to fix it
2006-08-05T06:02:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	you can use fdisk to create the partition.  you give it the starting and ending sector numbers.  fdisk does not touch the partition, only the partition table in the mbr.
2006-08-05T06:02:00.000Z	urakaipa	sethk	could you please tell me some of these commands?
2006-08-05T06:04:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	that's of course a problem.  if the rest of the partition table is intact, then you can figure out the starting and ending sectors
2006-08-05T06:04:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	say partition one ends at 1000, and partition three starts at 2000, then you would know that partition 2 starts at 1001 and ends at 1999.
2006-08-05T06:04:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	obviously I made those numbers up, but you get the idea, hopefully
2006-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	urakaipa	sethk	the problem is that more the one partition is missing, that's why i tried scanning the drive with gpart
2006-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	and gpart didn't find all the partitions except one?
2006-08-05T06:07:00.000Z	urakaipa	sethk	gpart did not find anything of the latest partitions, just old configuration
2006-08-05T06:07:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	too bad.  then you are down to scanning yourself.  I have some programs I wrote to scan, but to use them you would need to know the signatures used in the software raid file system.
2006-08-05T06:08:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	I'm a bit surprised that the partition doesn't appear to be a normal linux partition to software unaware of software raid
2006-08-05T06:08:00.000Z	sethk	urakaipa	but as I said I'm no expert on software raid
