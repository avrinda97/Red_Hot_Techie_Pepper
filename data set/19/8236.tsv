2007-10-16T12:02:00.000Z	underwatercow		ahahaha
2007-10-16T12:03:00.000Z	ToddEDM		so those programs will just copy it all... i dont need anything else?
2007-10-16T12:04:00.000Z	underwatercow	ToddEDM	I don't recall if I've tried dvdrip, but k9copy is very simple to use... it's my preferred
2007-10-16T12:04:00.000Z	ToddEDM	underwatercow	thanks man, i will give it a try, i have both on my system
2007-10-16T12:05:00.000Z	underwatercow	ToddEDM	k9copy will let you select what chapters and such you want, titles, subtitles, etc, then you can burn it directly, or to an iso... you can also change size in the settings... if you want to get it on a 4.7GiB DVD, then make sure the iso size is 4300
2007-10-16T12:05:00.000Z	ToddEDM	underwatercow	 thanks, thats good info
2007-10-16T12:05:00.000Z	underwatercow	ToddEDM	I learned that the hard way ;-D
