2012-06-21T15:53:00.000Z	lokai		yeah they do.
2012-06-21T15:53:00.000Z	lokai		they are just closed
2012-06-21T15:53:00.000Z	lokai		never had a problem with their drivers before.
2012-06-21T15:54:00.000Z	lokai		well, I should clarify: I tried with apt, and I tried running the latest linux drivers on nvidia.com
2012-06-21T15:55:00.000Z	lokai		and according to nivida.com, my card is supported on x86 linux...though doesnt have info about the kernel version, but I guess this shouldn't matter
2012-06-21T15:56:00.000Z	lokai		from what I understood nvidia drivers are somehow "semi-compiled" based on the kernel it detects -- its not just pure binary (except from the apt repos, of course)
2012-06-21T15:57:00.000Z	lokai		but anyways the 12.04 apt repos would have the right package, and this doesnt work -- what gives?
2012-06-21T15:59:00.000Z	lokai		modprobe -l nvidia returns kernel/drivers/video/nvidia.ko
2012-06-21T15:59:00.000Z	lokai		I don't know what "additional driver" software is
2012-06-21T16:00:00.000Z	lokai		right, so could it be that the on-chip GPU and discrete GPU conflict?
2012-06-21T16:01:00.000Z	DanielRM	lokai	possibly, although it would depend on the cards.
2012-06-21T16:01:00.000Z	lokai	DanielRM	yeah
2012-06-21T16:03:00.000Z	DanielRM	lokai	it reduces battery life drastically, but I'm looking for you anyway. :)
2012-06-21T16:05:00.000Z	DanielRM	lokai	can you get X up at all?
2012-06-21T16:07:00.000Z	lokai	DanielRM	Yes
2012-06-21T16:17:00.000Z	DanielRM	lokai	yep, Bumblebee or BIOS setting seems to be the way to go.
2012-06-21T16:18:00.000Z	DanielRM	lokai	Bumblebee won't run the Nvidia GPU for applications unless you run a specific program though.
2012-06-21T16:18:00.000Z	lokai	DanielRM	yeah, and apparently it doesnt like my hardware either...Get a failure connecting to my discrete GPU
2012-06-21T16:19:00.000Z	DanielRM	lokai	heh, sounds like fun times are ahead for you then.
