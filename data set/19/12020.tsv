2005-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	sudo apt-get install networkmanager
2005-10-22T09:16:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	Then go to 'System --> Preferences --> Sessions --> Startup' and add nm-applet
2005-10-22T09:16:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	network-manager, sorry
2005-10-22T09:17:00.000Z	batman	SEJeff	thanks
2005-10-22T09:18:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	You're welcome, network-manager one of those great things in Linux that "just works TM"
2005-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	That is what network-manager does
2005-10-22T09:20:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	As long as Wireless Network Discovery is on "Always Search" (Which is the default) it will do exactly what you want
2005-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	batman	SEJeff	i go to the network settings and it doesn't allow me to connect to my wlan
2005-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	Is your wireless network setup?
2005-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	And is your card detected / enabled?
2005-10-22T09:23:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	Under System --> Administration --> Networking, does it see your wireless card?
2005-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	batman	SEJeff	do i need to add a dns?
2005-10-22T09:27:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	Did you go to System --> Administration --> Networking and set up wlan0 or whatever the card is as DHCP?
2005-10-22T09:27:00.000Z	batman	SEJeff	yes i did
2005-10-22T09:27:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	It should work
2005-10-22T09:57:00.000Z	batman	SEJeff	i'm still having problems with my wifi
2005-10-22T09:57:00.000Z	SEJeff	batman	sorry, dont know what to tell you
2005-10-22T09:59:00.000Z	batman	SEJeff	i have the connection enabled, no esside, no wep key, and configured as dhcp
