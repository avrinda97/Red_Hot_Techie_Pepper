2005-07-25T11:58:00.000Z	Glendos		Can someone recommend a "WORKING" free dvd/cd recording program for gnome?? Nautilus has problems burning my data DVDs, Graveman sort of works except it gives growisofs errors, Gnomebaker 3.3 works fine except I can't Name my cds, Gnomebaker 0.4 Segfaults when I start burning.. and K3b needs crap load of QT libraries, and finally Nero Linux demo works but its not free and not opensource..
2005-07-25T12:00:00.000Z	Glendos		once it finishes it says some crap about growisofs
2005-07-25T12:00:00.000Z	Glendos		but it seems to burn correctly though... the files seem to be there and load
2005-07-25T12:01:00.000Z	Glendos		I was just hoping that all this grand opern source projects actually had one decent working burning program
2005-07-25T12:01:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	2 things that might  be relevant [1]  enabled DMA? [2]  tried a slower write speed?
2005-07-25T12:02:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	good point, I have DMA enabled , umask on, 32-bit IO
2005-07-25T12:02:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	I'm trying to burn 8x dvds at 4x to be safe
2005-07-25T12:07:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	hehe...pun
2005-07-25T12:08:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	:)
2005-07-25T12:09:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	i assume you've googled the heck out of 'gnomebaker segfault'?
2005-07-25T12:10:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	I have been trying to get a hold of the developers :(
2005-07-25T12:10:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	0.4 came out 2-3 days ago... so not much bug reports on it yet
2005-07-25T12:11:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	so you got the one that isn't in the repo?
2005-07-25T12:11:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	yes, I compiled the new release from source... the one in the repository is missing a VERY VERY important feature. It won't allow you to name the cds you burn
2005-07-25T12:12:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	:)
2005-07-25T12:12:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	does the repo version segfault too?
2005-07-25T12:12:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	I was shocked :) .. no the rep one doesn't segfault
2005-07-25T12:15:00.000Z	reka	Glendos	imho, i'd just use the repo version, and use a pen/texta to label the CD. :)  sounds like the latest one isn't up to scratch.
2005-07-25T12:16:00.000Z	Glendos	reka	yes but means I have made a compromise for a trivial feature !! I must find a solution instead of lowering my standards!
