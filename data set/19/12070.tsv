2005-10-15T15:06:00.000Z	aalih	SuseUX	i'll try that
2005-10-15T15:06:00.000Z	SuseUX	aalih	find your icon theme in there and just overwrite the mimetype icon
2005-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	aalih	SuseUX	i don't have that dir, what supposed to go in there?
2005-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	SuseUX	aalih	it's a hidden one in your /home/username directory
