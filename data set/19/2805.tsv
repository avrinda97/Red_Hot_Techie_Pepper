2009-12-30T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	then lxde will make a smaller system, you will need to install a DM too if you need graphical login
2009-12-30T18:27:00.000Z	Co0Ps	ActionParsnip	i took wlan0 down and up again and now it just has an ESSID (iwconfig) but is not associated to an AP. i have tried iwconfig essid and iwconfig key to sett essid and key, but it doesn't get associated. how can i see status of association etc?
2009-12-30T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	iwconfig    on its own. If you run: sudo iwlist scan    do you see SSIDs?
2009-12-30T18:29:00.000Z	Co0Ps	ActionParsnip	yes, i see the network as Cell 01
2009-12-30T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	thats a good start
2009-12-30T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	i think wicd has a cli interface, you could use that
2009-12-30T18:30:00.000Z	Co0Ps	ActionParsnip	ok, that would be perfect, brb
2009-12-30T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	http://wicd.sourceforge.net/moinmoin/VeryPluggableBackends
2009-12-30T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	wicd-curses is an interface
2009-12-30T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	will give you a curses based network manager
2009-12-30T18:33:00.000Z	Co0Ps	ActionParsnip	i get an exception when i run wicd-curses
2009-12-30T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Co0Ps	thats all i know
