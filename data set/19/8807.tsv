2008-01-22T09:12:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	well supposedly its using OSS and i need it to use alsa
2008-01-22T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	it can use either according to it's web page, but since I've never looked at it (don't play games on linux) I don't know enough to say anything
2008-01-22T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	but, you might try installing alsa-oss package, and invoking the game with aoss <gamename>
2008-01-22T09:15:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	already tried that and it still crackles
2008-01-22T09:16:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	then you've plumbed by shallow but narrow knowledge of sound :)
2008-01-22T09:17:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	well i think i found a way to config openAL to use alsa
2008-01-22T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	add it to my meager store, will you ?
2008-01-22T09:22:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	well apparently my openAL was already set to use ALSA it seems
2008-01-22T09:23:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	so it must be a problem with alsa?
2008-01-22T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	Does anything else sound bad?  Have you checked the support forums for the game?
2008-01-22T09:29:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	where might i find the module name for my sound card?
2008-01-22T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	 lsmod | grep snd, it will probably be the first module listed
2008-01-22T09:35:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	now how do i tell ubuntu to use my onboard sound instead of my audigy?
2008-01-22T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	you would create an ~/.asound.conf file and tell it there. The syntax, I don't know
2008-01-22T09:36:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	what does the ~/ in front of that path mean?
2008-01-22T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	~ is a shortcut for /home/<you>  , your home directory
2008-01-23T05:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	ping
2008-01-24T04:45:00.000Z	Ashnal	nickrud	so ive decided since i got my onboard sound working, ill try to use my sound card as it sound much better, however now it doesnt want to output any sound at all regardless of volume levels
2008-02-10T11:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Ashnal	dpkg -L <packagename> shows where all the files get installed
