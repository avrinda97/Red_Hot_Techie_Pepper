2006-02-22T13:19:00.000Z	tritium		!ati
2006-02-22T10:35:00.000Z	tritium		yes, wastrel
2006-02-22T10:35:00.000Z	tritium		hold down the shift key while dragging the window, and it will snap to edges
2006-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	tritium		you don't even need apt-src, adri
2006-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	tritium		deb-src repo, that is
2006-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	tritium		sure, wastrel
2006-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	good to know... but apt-get gets the dependencies as well?
2006-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	tritium	lemsx1	there is a build-dep option in apt-get ;)
2006-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	meaning if it needs to recompile newer versions
2006-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	that definitely makes apt-src redundant then... i just ilke the name: apt-src ;-)
2006-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	tritium	lemsx1	apt-src is a fine tool, also
2006-02-22T10:38:00.000Z	tritium	lemsx1	:)
2006-02-22T10:38:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	agree
2006-02-22T10:38:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	but if apt-get does the same and it's ALWAYS there, then there is no reason to use anything else
2006-02-22T10:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	that doesn't always apply to all other software of course... look at the gap that Fx feels even though IE is always there :-P
2006-02-22T10:39:00.000Z	tritium	lemsx1	:)
2006-02-22T10:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	s/feels/fills/ ... lack of tea today
2006-02-22T10:54:00.000Z	lemsx1	tritium	ROFL
