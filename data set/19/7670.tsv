2007-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	sensae		does anyone have any hint or clue how I could fix "FATAL: module raid1 not found" ? I got the system to mount my RAID1 array from a liveCD but I'm not sure what's keeping it from booting
2007-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	you have a chicken/egg problem
2007-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	How so?
2007-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	you are trying to load a RAID driver off a RAID array. see the problem?
2007-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	Yes, but the RAID driver is compiled into the kernel and it was working fine, all I did was install ubuntu-desktop
2007-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	so it boots completely but fails to load X?
2007-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	No, I installed ubuntu-desktop and restarted (trying to switch from xfce to gnome) and it won't boot anymore
2007-09-25T08:36:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	It goes to busybox after about 10 minutes
2007-09-25T08:36:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	so it *doesn't* boot.
2007-09-25T08:36:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	Yeah
2007-09-25T08:36:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	did your update include a new kernel and an initramfs rebuild?
2007-09-25T08:37:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	I don't believe so
2007-09-25T08:39:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	Assuming there was a new kernel / initramfs, with my array mounted on a liveCD is there a way I can recompile the driver into the kernel?
2007-09-25T08:40:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	there are some good tutorials on building your own kernel and initramfs
2007-09-25T08:41:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	So I can do it from a LiveCD? that was what I was meaning to ask.
2007-09-25T08:41:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	yup
2008-05-08T07:10:00.000Z	mneptok	sensae	sftp?
2008-05-08T07:10:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	Can I set that to mount on boot?
2008-05-08T07:12:00.000Z	sensae	mneptok	Can I automount SFTP in fstab?
