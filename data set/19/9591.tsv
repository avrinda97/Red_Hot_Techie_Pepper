2006-12-23T17:30:00.000Z	Life		silentdis: i would not know as i am not physically there
2006-12-23T17:32:00.000Z	Life		silentdis: i dont see that anywhere.
2006-12-23T17:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 eh?
2006-12-23T17:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 just these 2 servers you're having issue with?
2006-12-23T17:17:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 I'd say that that server has the issue.  either the route to it is rejecting the ping requests (very possible), or the route to host is disallowing it (some router is configured to do so), or the server is down.
2006-12-23T17:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 you're trying to ping your outside cloud IP and it's bouncing?
2006-12-23T17:20:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 if you're sitting AT the server, and you try pinging 127.0.0.1, it should always work.  That's the internal IP.  Then, depending on how you have that server configed, you can have it set to deny ping requests on it's public IP.
2006-12-23T17:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 ok, then i'm misunderstanding the problem lol
2006-12-23T17:22:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 ok, from external box > server doesn't work?
2006-12-23T17:23:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 just trying to tack down the network schema in my head here is all.  it goes Computer > router > Teh Interweb > router > server.  is that correct, or am I mucking it up.
2006-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 not having a desktop is fine.  I'm just trying to figure out the network schema, so I can better understand the problem, and help :)
2006-12-23T17:26:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 lets skip the whole KVM stuff for now.  if you're sshed into something, or have access to a machine in some way, shape or form, that's your starting point.  the computer.  what route would the ping request take, physically, is what I'm trying to understand :)
2006-12-23T17:29:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 i did support in the trenches in Tier1 and Tier2 roles for decent sized ISPs, as well as net admin for a while in my life.  Understanding the physcial layer is the FIRST part to diagnosing where net troubles are coming from.  So, what I'm asking is what cable/bits are the reqests going through?
2006-12-23T17:30:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 forget everything from traceroute, ping, etc.  I'm looking for info on the physical layer, first and foremost, so I can better help diagnose and troubleshoot where the trouble is.  without knowing what I'm up against, i'm virtually useless lol
2006-12-23T17:31:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 that's fine!  you don't have to be there.  What I'm trying to find out is what bits the requests are going through.  You have access to your computer, and to this server.  You're trying to send ping requests from your computer to the server.  Now, what bits of equip are those pings going through?  Does this look right:  computer > router > the internet > router > server?
2006-12-23T17:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 so it's computer > magic > server?  lol
2006-12-23T17:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 the problem, as I understand it, is you're having problems pinging a server from your computer.  is that correct?
2006-12-23T17:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 ok.  What are the PHYSICAL bits of kit that that request would go over?
2006-12-23T17:39:00.000Z	SilentDis	Life	 i'd love to help you, but i don't know enough about the network schema to provide good answers.  This problem could be related to a local router, a remote router, the remote config, etc.  I have no way of knowing where to start looking.  sorry :(
