2010-02-12T04:08:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	the ubuntu-desktop package is only a metapackage so will only uninstall itself, not the packages it installs
2010-02-12T04:08:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	thanks, I removed it
2010-02-12T04:34:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	gnomedo is something else, depends how much ram you have to burn
2010-02-12T04:35:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	I have it, its boring, you have to type.  It excellent, just not eye candy
2010-02-12T04:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	how much ram are you using right now?
2010-02-12T04:35:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	a third
2010-02-12T04:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	yowser
2010-02-12T04:37:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	so you are using half a gig of ram just for the desktop? is firefox running?
2010-02-12T04:37:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	yep, firefox is always on.  But sometimes, it does spiral out and max my cpu, even though it is idle
2010-02-12T04:37:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	thats because it sucks at ram
2010-02-12T04:38:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	i'm running lxde with no compiz and chromium and using 210Mb ish
2010-02-12T04:38:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	but it was ram it was cpu maxing
2010-02-12T04:39:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	I very cheap, I have to maximize usage.  Actually, it doesnt kill performance, like you would expect.  Its firefox that is heavy
2010-02-12T04:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	get a better browser, kazenchase or swiftfox are cutdown versions and use less resources
2010-02-12T04:55:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	what does: cat /proc/cpuinfo
2010-02-12T04:56:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	Only shows one cpu
2010-02-12T04:58:00.000Z	actionParsnip	tp43	weird, what is the output of: uname -a
2010-02-12T05:02:00.000Z	tp43	actionParsnip	it is smp kernel
