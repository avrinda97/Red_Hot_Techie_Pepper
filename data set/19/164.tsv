2012-10-25T22:26:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		i actually use iscsi && DLNA works like a charm
2012-10-25T22:26:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		yeps
2012-10-25T22:26:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		really easy especially with a fairly recent tv
2012-10-25T22:27:00.000Z	Kyle__	SolarisB1y	I always had problems with audio-syncing with pms. I'm using mediatomb.
2012-10-25T22:28:00.000Z	Kyle__	SolarisB1y	That said, I've got an insane mediatomb config that's grown organically for years now.
2012-10-25T22:28:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	Kyle__	hrmmm =)
2012-10-25T22:28:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	Kyle__	yea i know what you mean - i run into things here and there - more so i think from whats in the containers i play which are random
2012-10-25T22:28:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		but you interest me now with this mediatomb you speak of - and i reallly wanted to get away from running a java app..
2012-10-25T22:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	SolarisB1y	Yea, once I gave up crafting my own ripping/encoding lines by hand, and just used handbrake, everything has been much somoother.  Even on mediatomb.
2012-10-25T22:29:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		hahaha
2012-10-25T22:29:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	Kyle__	im ashamed of myself lols
2012-10-25T22:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	SolarisB1y	That said, I really don't want to re-encode all the crap I've got on the media server for my kids...
2012-10-25T22:29:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		sounds like me with a 10 line ffmpeg thingy that eventually may fail after it runs lolZ
2012-10-25T22:30:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	Kyle__	your making me sad =( i have the same issue
2012-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	SolarisB1y	I know, me too.  I _liked_ knowing each flag and tweaking things here and there to get an awesome quality, yet very small, video file.  But in the days of cheap 2TB hard drives... meh?
2012-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	SolarisB1y		kudos on the handbrake - i had it installed for a year but can't seem to rip myself away from archaic ffmpeg lines
2012-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	Kyle__	cheers to you =)
2012-10-25T22:33:00.000Z	Kyle__	SolarisB1y	When you borrow your in-laws only copy of an out of print movie to back up, that their autistic son MUST watch every 12 hours, handbreak.  She puts the dvd in the drive.  She clicks on handbrake.
