2007-07-31T12:34:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	can you repeat what the problem is for me?
2007-07-31T12:35:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	genii suggested I add sync to mount options. that had no effect.
2007-07-31T12:35:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	hm, interesting one. Do you get the message about data left to write when you run 'sync ; sync' before the eject?
2007-07-31T12:36:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	haven't tried manually syncing the disks. let me try that.
2007-07-31T12:37:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	genii's suggestion does essentially the same as sync, although it can work in situations where no shell is accessible.
2007-07-31T12:38:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	doing a manual sync, and then an eject - I still get the messages.
2007-07-31T12:39:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	is there a particular reason for you to use ext2 rather than ext3?
2007-07-31T12:40:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	i tried ext3 first. when I got the problem, i thought that the journalling was the issue, so i reformatted as ext2.
2007-07-31T12:41:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	ah, you can go from ext3 to ext2 and back without reformatting... but the issue is something else now, of course.
2007-07-31T12:43:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	have you tried running 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' during mount and eject?
2007-07-31T12:51:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	have you tried running 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' during mount and eject?
2007-07-31T12:52:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	yes, and there are no error messages in any of the log files.
2007-07-31T13:00:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	just fyi ... i reformatted the drive as fat32 and I still have the problems.
2007-07-31T13:01:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	wow, that's really weird. Did you do a full fsck at any stage when you still had ext2/3?
2007-07-31T13:01:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	nope. I used gpartd to create the partitions.
2007-07-31T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	did you reboot at any stage after the problem first occurred?
2007-07-31T13:02:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	no, i have not rebooted.
2007-07-31T13:03:00.000Z	soundray	_KP_	in that case I suspect you've had it mounted twice to different mountpoints at some point, then it didn't unmount cleanly. I'd do a reboot, then try to reproduce the problem.
2007-07-31T13:04:00.000Z	_KP_	soundray	I'll give it a try. thanks.
