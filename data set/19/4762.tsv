2010-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		The flash seems to be stuck in read-only mode
2010-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		So not only can I not delete/ad dmusic... but it can't PLAY music either because it needs scratch space
2010-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		at least I was able to get the music OFF of it though
2010-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I never understood the point of two moniters
2010-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Well, its true :P
2010-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Only reason I upgraded my monitor was becaue the old one got so bad I couldent tell the difference between n and m anymore
2010-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I meant for a desktop :P
2010-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Even then, this new monitor's size is kinda overwhelming
2010-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I can't imagine having two
2010-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		since its 16:9, my old one was 4:3
2010-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	i would enjoy having two 22" monitors, anything bigger, would be overkill
2010-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	i had the same issue with my vaio.
2010-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	last i tried on my vaio was 9.04 also, and i had gfx acceleration issues.
2010-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma	klown	was it also an ati card?
2010-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	no, an intel card.::disgust::
2010-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	nothing really.
2010-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	alot of people learned to use it first
2010-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	havent tried wpa.
2010-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	klown	Cyber_Akuma	its a good program, as been mentioned, but if you dont care for it, its your personal opinion.
