2007-12-21T06:34:00.000Z	keithclark		Hi everyone!  Glad to report that Ubuntu installed on my laptop with no issues.  Even the ATI and Broadcom work!
2007-12-21T06:35:00.000Z	keithclark		Now, I just have I last question.  How to enable Compiz?
2007-12-21T06:35:00.000Z	keithclark		Thanks Pelo.
2007-12-21T06:36:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	run  restricted-manager , enable ati restricted. Then   sudo modprobe fglrx  . Log out, log in.   fglrxinfo , be sure you are using ati driver 8.37.6 .   sudo aptitude install xserver-xgl emerald compizconfig-settings-manager , logout , login

2008-06-28T06:11:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	  run  top  , see what's eating the cpu
2008-06-28T06:12:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	Xorg is running 50%, not much else
2008-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	hm, have you tried restarting your desktop?
2008-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	yes, 4 times in the last two hours
2008-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	something is using the clock, so maybe gnome-system-monitor will tell you more
2008-06-28T06:14:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	I tried that, but it is almost impossible to use.  It just keeps greying out.
2008-06-28T06:14:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	possibly try installing htop, it's like top but shows stuff a little better
2008-06-28T06:15:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	in the repos?
2008-06-28T06:15:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	yep
2008-06-28T06:15:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	will try, thanks.
2008-06-28T06:33:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	hmm..my problem may lay in a failed upgrade.....
2008-12-05T10:22:00.000Z	nickrud	keithclark	welcome to the wonderful world of linux sound. Much better than the past, but still a problem
2008-12-05T10:22:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	not a problem.
2008-12-05T10:22:00.000Z	keithclark	nickrud	still dual booting
