2006-02-20T10:11:00.000Z	snooze_	Ocius	#!/bin/bash
2006-02-20T10:11:00.000Z	snooze_	Ocius	and after that the commands
2006-02-20T10:11:00.000Z	snooze_	Ocius	just save that shit to a file and chmod +x it

2006-02-20T10:12:00.000Z	snooze_	Ocius	it just indicates that the file starting with it is being executed by /bin/bash
