2006-12-10T09:58:00.000Z	drkm		i'm thinking about installing ubuntu.. last time i install linux i had to configure swap.. do you still have to do that with ubuntu during the install process?
2006-12-10T09:58:00.000Z	boink	drkm	I installed swap from apt-get

2006-12-10T10:06:00.000Z	drkm	boink	what does that mean
2006-12-10T10:07:00.000Z	drkm	boink	run windows applications like photoshop and some poker clients i use
2006-12-10T10:08:00.000Z	drkm	boink	what can't it out of that list?
2006-12-10T10:09:00.000Z	drkm	boink	well if i don't use photoshop.. could it cope with the poker clients?
2006-12-10T10:10:00.000Z	drkm	boink	well if it can't even cope with poker clients.. what is vmware designed to cope with?
2006-12-10T10:10:00.000Z	drkm	boink	can u give me some examples of things it can cope with so i can compare it with what i know
2006-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	drkm	boink	can u give me an example of a big application it can cope with so i can compare it to the poker clients
2006-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	drkm	boink	you don't know any or you don't want to give me an example?

2006-12-10T10:14:00.000Z	drkm	boink	you can install directly from a iso rather than burning it to cd? as that would suit me more
