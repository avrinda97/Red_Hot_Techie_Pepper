2007-02-19T11:41:00.000Z	Ruffles		how do i resize devshm to make it bigger?
2007-02-19T11:41:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	the real question is why you would need to
2007-02-19T11:43:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	/etc/default/tmpfs is the answer.
2007-02-19T11:43:00.000Z	Ruffles	macd	what size should i put there to make it 128mb ?
2007-02-19T11:44:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	did you read what it said in the file? ;)
2007-02-19T11:45:00.000Z	Ruffles	macd	yeah so what now? should i umount and mount it back again?
2007-02-19T11:46:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	"sudo mount -a"
2007-02-19T11:47:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	OR mount -o remount,size=129096k /dev/shm
2007-02-19T11:47:00.000Z	Ruffles	macd	and what's /dev/shm for?
2007-02-19T11:48:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	thats b/c /dev/shm is a virtual filesystem
2007-02-19T11:49:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	use the second command I posted.
2007-02-19T11:50:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	odd, just reboot and the changes you made in /etc/default/tmpfs will take effect.
2007-02-19T11:57:00.000Z	Ruffles	macd	devshm                124K     0  124K   0% /dev/shm
2007-02-19T11:57:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	yeah we established I gave you a bad number while you were gone ;)
2007-02-19T11:58:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	134217728
2007-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	Ruffles	macd	how much is 144mb in bytes?
2007-02-19T12:04:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	144 * 1024 * 1024
2007-02-19T12:06:00.000Z	macd	Ruffles	you need to sudo
