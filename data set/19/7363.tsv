2010-06-05T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 theres such a varity its  hard to Tell - I would stick to ones that have nvidia video. and then whatver wirless card you can find that has support.
2010-06-05T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 i would avoide toshiba.
2010-06-05T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 some Intel video chipsets have issues -  so watch out
2010-06-05T15:36:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	no toshiba then. nvidia is also ok but I don't want it to overheat. i'm not a gamer...
2010-06-05T15:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 check out the preintstalled linux machnes. and see what gpu/wireless they normally use. :) thats a start
2010-06-05T15:39:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	my problem was that I cannot find which ones has preinstalled linux... how can I get a list
2010-06-05T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 check google and see what the various linux hardware sites sell
2010-06-05T15:41:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	i actually already had hard time with the too much information... could you provide me some link to a site like this, please? :) i always find *too much* info to handle
2010-09-11T14:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 this is grub1 or grub2 ?
2010-09-11T14:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 its possible via chainloading  the bootloaders i recall. but ive never needed to do so
2010-09-11T14:29:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	well sda1 is grub1 and sdb5 is grub2
2011-06-02T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 updated for what? ive never seen any apps other thebn ntfs-config to work on the fstab
2011-06-02T17:29:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	nor did I, however I manually updated my partition table for sure :)
2011-06-02T17:29:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	and fstab was generated when i first installed ubuntu somehow, there must be a way to do it (i could do it manually but i don't want)
2011-06-02T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 never seen a 'regenerate fstab' tool. Never really needed one. If  i add a new HD. i add a proper line.  There might be some apps that can do it. but ive never noticed one mentioned in here.
2011-06-02T17:31:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	ok thanks for the info then :)
2011-06-02T17:31:00.000Z	naxa	Dr_Willis	how does the installer do it?
2011-06-02T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	naxa	 proberly some script makes it from your  input information
