2006-06-21T13:05:00.000Z	dakira		Any Opera users here?
2006-06-21T13:05:00.000Z	ffub	dakira	i use opera
2006-06-21T13:05:00.000Z	dakira	ffub	have you updated to 9, yet?
2006-06-21T13:05:00.000Z	ffub		yeah
2006-06-21T13:05:00.000Z	ffub		i've been using nine a while
2006-06-21T13:06:00.000Z	dakira	ffub	do you have the same problem that since 9 all the fonts are soo small?
2006-06-21T13:06:00.000Z	ffub		no
2006-06-21T13:06:00.000Z	ffub		i have nto had that probelm
2006-06-21T13:06:00.000Z	dakira	ffub	mhh.. that's bad.. on alot (not all) websites the fonts are extremely small
2006-06-21T13:06:00.000Z	ffub		in opera, you can edit the user style css
2006-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	ffub		try editing that to override the fonts on websites, that may do the trick dakira
2006-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	dakira	ffub	i know.. but the sites should look right out-of-the-box.. as they did in 8.5x and as they still do in 9 for windows
2006-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	ffub		that is true
2006-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	ffub		yeah they do look fine in windows as well
2006-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	ffub		for me
2006-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	ffub	dakira	perhaps there is a running bug about it, i would inquire with the opera people
2006-06-21T13:09:00.000Z	dakira	ffub	mhh.. i'll kill all my files and will do a complete reinstall.. maybe that will help
2006-06-21T13:09:00.000Z	ffub		Dakira: that sounds like a good idea
2006-06-21T13:09:00.000Z	dakira	ffub	if they above doesn't help I'll use my premium support to get some help ;)
