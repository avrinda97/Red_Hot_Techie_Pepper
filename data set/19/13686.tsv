2008-01-08T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 it could be bad in the middle of a file..  not where  its being looked at initially
2008-01-08T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 you were never around in the modem days. :) bad dloads were common then.
2008-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 they are usingtheir own verification. Ive downloaded exe's that when i ran.  windows would say they were bad..
2008-01-08T09:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 thers no real need to download the dvd either.. the cd will install the os just fine
2008-01-08T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 data can get messed up during transmission.
2008-01-08T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 you dont really need the dvd at all.. and you could try torrents.
2008-01-08T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 only you know your own skills with repairing pc's :)    You will want to learn how to do it all someday.
2008-01-08T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 given the limited info yuve given.. i doubt if we can tell.
2008-01-08T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bloodboy	 remove hd.. put it in 2nd machine.. backup imporntant data.
