2010-06-13T22:18:00.000Z	john__		Just says Linux
2010-06-13T22:19:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	are you looking for your local computer name?  or the name of your printer?
2010-06-13T22:20:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	it should be the name right after your user name in terminal.  for example User@computer name:-$
2010-06-13T22:21:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	if looking to connect your sys to a wireless printer you will probably need the printer hostname.  login to your router and use the printers ip address as the host
2010-06-13T22:22:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	login to your router, and check all connected clients.  one should be the printer.  mark down the IP assigned to the printer, and input that number when the configuration asks you for host
2010-06-13T22:30:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	ok but can you view all clients connected?
2010-06-13T22:30:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	ifconfig
2010-06-13T22:31:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	but ifconfig will give you local info not the printer info
2010-06-13T22:31:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	lynksys XXXXX version?
2010-06-13T22:34:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	that could be it.   What is the host name?
2010-06-13T22:36:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	SSID is your network name.  your looking for the name of your printer.
2010-06-13T22:38:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	im not sure.  you will probably need to use the printers ip, should be something like 192.168.0.xxx
2010-06-13T22:39:00.000Z	mfpockets	john__	try this and tell me what you see: Log into the router and go to the status tab > local network > click on the dhcp client tabl
