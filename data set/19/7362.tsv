2009-09-26T04:57:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	i use 800x600
2009-09-26T04:58:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	i used to use 800x600... don't you feel sometimes that just every window and menu is too big?
2009-09-26T04:59:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	everthing is just right any resolution higher then everything is too small
2009-09-26T04:59:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	i have an older monitor anyway
2009-09-26T05:00:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	i see :)
2009-09-26T05:00:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	with a brand new computer
2009-09-26T05:00:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	well, in my case, the problem is not with the monitor, but with the resolution
2009-09-26T05:00:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	graphics card has alot to do with it
2009-09-26T05:01:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	i used to have an old monitor with a new computer, when i realized i would better use a new monitor with an old computer
2009-09-26T05:01:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	well, yeah, but i am able to use bigger resolutions, it's just that i always feel that ubuntu somehow wastes my screen space
2009-09-26T05:02:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	which graphics card?
2009-09-26T05:05:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	well, i have ubuntu on a mobile hdd. on this computer there is a very old intel 82845/G graphics card. on the other i have a geforce 8xxx and on the third there is an ati radeon.
2009-09-26T05:06:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	i am pretty convinced that it's nothing to do with my graphics card but with ui design
2009-09-26T05:06:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	yea, i got a GeForce also
2009-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	maybe geforce is the best solution for gnome
2009-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	i used to use 800x600 in xp also when i had xp
2009-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	naxa	thiebaude	me too
2009-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	thiebaude	naxa	i agree with you,nvidia graphics and sound i have
