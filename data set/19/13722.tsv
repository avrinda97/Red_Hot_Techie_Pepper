2005-02-07T12:43:00.000Z	meskes		Thank god got the Unlimited VLM. ;)
2005-02-07T12:45:00.000Z	meskes		Man, I thought xmms would stream from my Samba server. Im glad I found out that Rythmbox does, and I think Im starting to like it better anyway.
2005-02-07T12:45:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	I had to install amaroK, myself.
2005-02-07T12:46:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	I really wanted to try and do without any KDE stuff, but amarok is just so wonderful.
2005-02-07T12:47:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	That's not the tragically hip.
2005-02-07T12:47:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	um, sounds like them to me
2005-02-07T12:47:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	That's Gord Downie's solo project, iirc.
2005-02-07T12:47:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	then that would explain it. heh
2005-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	Or am I getting it confused with "When are you thinking of disappearing"?
2005-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	You are.
2005-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	Well, colour me stupid.
2005-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	heh, no ones perfect.
2005-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	It can be hard to tell In this Violet Light.
2005-02-07T12:49:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	Heh, Ive Silver Jet playing now. speak of the devil.
2005-02-07T12:51:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	Was their last album worth getting? When the first single is called "Vaccination Scar" it's hard to get motivated.
2005-02-07T12:51:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	Its ok.
2005-02-07T12:52:00.000Z	meskes	pvh	I like the other shit, like 100th Meridian and whatnot.
2005-02-07T12:52:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	I think The Weakerthans deserve their throne now.
2005-02-07T12:52:00.000Z	pvh	meskes	Or rather, are good successors to the throne.
