2009-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	nimrod0		thanks Armageddon , just wanted a list of supported hardware
2009-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	nimrod0		as there are always trouble with ubuntu especially on laptops with drivers
2009-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	yar, I still cant get my wifi to work on 8.10 on AAO.
2009-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	have you considered upgrading ?
2009-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	very much so.  my bandwidth doesnt permit it at this time.
2009-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	what type of hardware for wifi
2009-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	request some free cd
2009-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	nimrod0		there was a way to do that
2009-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	the wifi nic is an atheros AR5007EG
2009-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	atheros should be fully supported
2009-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	I will just wait until march to get a steady cat5 connection.
2009-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	and I am stuck with windblows :(
2009-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	not with 8.10 it isnt supported.
2009-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	that sucks really , these hardware manufacturers need a kick
2009-10-30T14:15:00.000Z	h0ss		niimrod0: tell me about it.
2009-10-30T14:16:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	please email the manufacturers and ask them to release drivers, the more of us that do that the better chance we have of making these people release drivers, because otherwise they know they'll lose money
2009-10-30T14:17:00.000Z	nimrod0	h0ss	we need to put the pressure on these guys, after all we pay for the hardware
2009-10-30T14:17:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	from what I understand later releases of Ubuntu work fine with this hardware.
2009-10-30T14:17:00.000Z	h0ss	nimrod0	also there are some packages that might makeit work
