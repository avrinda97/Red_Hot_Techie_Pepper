2008-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	yes there is aplication livel protocol encryption ssl for http and so on but there is no program that encrypts all internet traffic
2008-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	for one something like that would have to be installed in alll internet connected devices
2008-10-24T18:59:00.000Z	darksifer	erUSUL	i download by xdcc. i got full download speed but lately i have noticed that when i download from xdcc my download speed is drastically low. i have to problem wen downloading by http or by torrent? can you tell me there is a solution for me to  be able to download by xdcc?
2008-10-24T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	never used dcc so dunno really and p2p speeds depends on so many factors that is not easy to diagnose what the problem may be
2010-05-01T17:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	i got NFS something problem. <<< tha's not very informative. give as the exact command you used to mount it and the exact output
2010-05-01T17:29:00.000Z	darksifer	erUSUL	when mounting it says "Error mounting: mount: Stale NFS file handle". so i ran e2fsk
2010-05-01T17:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	but did you ever used nfs on the machine partition ?
2010-05-01T17:32:00.000Z	darksifer	erUSUL	i see some progress. and it ask me to fix block. i have to type "Y" everytime. is there a way to do the fix automatically. http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/mVuGSdkH
2010-05-01T17:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	passing -p to fsck if i recall correctly
2010-05-01T17:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	-p     Automatically  repair  ("preen")  the  file system.
2010-05-01T17:33:00.000Z	darksifer	erUSUL	can i stop what e2fsk now with corrupting the partition. and apply the command?
2010-05-01T17:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	i would not interrupt fsck while working
2010-05-01T17:35:00.000Z	darksifer	erUSUL	any recommendation what can be done koz i cant keep typing Y. LOL
2010-05-01T17:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	darksifer	nope sorry; never been on such situation ... let me google a bit
