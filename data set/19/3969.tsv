2009-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	Madpeter		hello is there anyway to edit the gunb ("bootloader <_<") from within ubuntu?
2009-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	Do you mean grub?
2009-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	You can edit the file /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	But be careful and back up the original first
2009-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	Madpeter	RedSocrates	I receaved a permissions error when attempting to save, the permissions gui does not let me change this V_V
2009-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	Are you trying to edit it with a gui?  Which one?  gedit?
2009-05-03T10:27:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	You can try using "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst".  If that doesn't work, try "sudo" instead of "gksudo"
2009-05-03T10:28:00.000Z	Madpeter	RedSocrates	Thanks for your help. ^_^
2009-05-03T10:28:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	No prob :)
2009-05-03T10:29:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	Good luck :)
2009-05-03T11:08:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	"sudo fdisk -l" will show your partitions
2009-05-03T11:09:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	You should also know that the numbering in grub can (in fact, usually is) different from the numbering used by the kernel.  For example, the kernel begins numbering at 1 (/dev/sda1, etc.) and grub begins numbering at 0 (hd0, etc.)
2009-05-03T11:14:00.000Z	Madpeter	RedSocrates	thanks again ^_^ hopfully once I got my XP back and booting normaly I can then start work on getting ubuntu to use my sound card as right now its why I even want to load XP at all
2009-05-03T11:15:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	No problem.  Good luck with it
2009-05-03T11:22:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	I don't know exactly, but I do remember that when I used to dual boot with Windows, I also had to edit c:\boot.ini to get things working
2009-05-03T11:22:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	Can't really tell you much more than that, though
2009-05-03T11:24:00.000Z	Madpeter	RedSocrates	is there anyway to do a test load from within the OS so I can see if its working (so I dont have to restart)
2009-05-03T11:25:00.000Z	RedSocrates	Madpeter	Not that I know of, unfortunately.  Others may know of some way, but I don't
2009-05-03T11:26:00.000Z	Madpeter	RedSocrates	thanks
