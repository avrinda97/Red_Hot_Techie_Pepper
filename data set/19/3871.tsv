2009-05-20T03:37:00.000Z	Yanick_		how can I find out what device is my external usb hd is plugged into?
2009-05-20T03:37:00.000Z	Yanick_		it does not mount and there is no message
2009-05-20T03:37:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	look at dmesg
2009-05-20T03:46:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	I read the log of dmesg, and it says it's sdb1, but when I try to mount "sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/MEDIA" it doesn't mount
2009-05-20T03:47:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	 does it spit out another error in dmesg
2009-05-20T03:47:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	not that I can see
2009-05-20T03:49:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	it did mount two days ago, but now it won't anymore, how can I find why?
2009-05-20T03:50:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	look at /var/log/messages they are dated so you can probably guess at around what time it decided to alter its behaviour
2009-05-20T03:50:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	and those would be the ones I would bring up here
2009-05-20T03:52:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	there doesn't seem to be any error in the logs
2009-05-20T03:53:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	the reported bug iis if you dont shutdown windows cleanly your ntfs will refuse to mount
2009-05-20T03:53:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	so it won't show an eror message in Linux
2009-05-20T03:54:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	I have a windows xp machine right beside me, I connect the plug, it loads the drive. I disconnect (through the "safely disconnect the drive") and it disconnect. now I plug the thing on this computer... nothing
2009-05-20T03:54:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	i dont think it has to do with safely unplugging
2009-05-20T03:55:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	on Ubuntu 8.04, there was an error message about "dirty ntfs" and I used to force mount and it worked. but since I "safely disconnect" in windows XP, it always worked. but not anymore
2009-05-20T03:57:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	got a live CD somewhere? i'm running out of options
2009-05-20T03:57:00.000Z	Yanick_	she_dyed	how will that help?
2009-05-20T03:58:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	see if it works there
2009-05-20T03:58:00.000Z	she_dyed	Yanick_	then go back to normal
