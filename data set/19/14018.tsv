2005-01-03T13:06:00.000Z	Amaranth		you mean package compatibility?
2005-01-03T13:07:00.000Z	Amaranth		for some small things you can mix packages but don't do it full scale, you'll get package incompatibility nightmares
2005-01-03T13:09:00.000Z	Amaranth		it'll allow you to edit and create partitions
2005-01-03T13:09:00.000Z	Amaranth		kind of like fdisk
2005-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth		the tool?
2005-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth		it's a part of the installation
2005-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	Amaranth		it'll run
2005-01-03T13:11:00.000Z	Amaranth		it'll try to handle things for you but if you want to keep windows that might be a bad idea :P
2005-01-03T13:11:00.000Z	Amaranth		so you'll have to manually create partitions but if you know fdisk it shouldn't be hard
2005-01-03T13:12:00.000Z	Amaranth		now, if i keep helping people i'll never get you all iTunes Music Store support in GNOME :P
