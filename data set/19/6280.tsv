2008-02-14T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	Docfxit	you need to be more specific.  There is more than one way to search for a file.  Just tell me exactly what actions you take to search for the file
2008-02-14T20:15:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» In the default download of Ubuntu I select Places, Search for Files
2008-02-14T20:17:00.000Z	jrib	Docfxit	thanks.  It looks like the Usage section when you click on Help talks about wildcards.  Does the information there do what you want?
2008-02-14T20:21:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» Tx for finding that. It doesn't seem to work. Do you know of a better search engine? Or maybe I don't know how to start in the root?
2008-02-14T20:22:00.000Z	jrib	Docfxit	what do you want to search for and how did you try?
2008-02-14T20:24:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» I'd like to search for files in /etc/asterisk and I selected to look in folder (computer name)
2008-02-14T20:25:00.000Z	jrib	Docfxit	and what did you search for?  You don't just want to list all the files in /etc/asterisk right?
2008-02-14T20:25:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» no. I searched for manager.*
2008-02-14T20:26:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» I can see the file is there. It's called manager.conf
2008-02-14T20:27:00.000Z	jrib	Docfxit	that should work.  Does this work in a terminal:   find /etc/asterisk  -name 'manager.*'
2008-02-14T20:28:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» yes. It works great.
2008-02-14T20:29:00.000Z	jrib	Docfxit	strange that the gui did not work.  I tried a similar example here and it seemed to work okay
2008-02-14T20:30:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» Maybe when I select the computer name which is docfxit it isn't pointing to the root?
2008-02-14T20:43:00.000Z	Docfxit	jrib	» Tx for the help in find.
