2009-11-08T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Drule	 boot a live cd/flash drive and transfer stuff  if networking works from live cd/flash
2009-11-08T17:05:00.000Z	Drule	Dr_Willis	Already tried that. It won't let me access my files
2009-11-08T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Drule	 sudo -s on the live cd, to get root...
2009-11-08T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Drule	 and access them :)
2009-11-08T17:06:00.000Z	Drule	Dr_Willis	I tried sudo -su
2009-11-08T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Drule	 su ? dont do sudo su,  just use sudo -s, or use  the console to get root permissionss. i i guess...
2009-11-08T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Drule	 you are doing somting wrong then
2009-11-08T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Drule	 you can see the files just cant access them?
2009-11-08T17:07:00.000Z	Drule	Dr_Willis	I can't access the root folder of my filesystem, and that's where the files are located
