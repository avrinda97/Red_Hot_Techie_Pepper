2007-03-07T12:03:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	what's the problem? php pages aren't parsed, it just spits out the source?
2007-03-07T12:06:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	it looks like a permissions problem.  if you type "ls -lh /var/www/test.php" what does it show for the permissions/owners?
2007-03-07T12:08:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	what about the "rwx" stuff?  how many "r"s are there?
2007-03-07T12:08:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	that's the problem
2007-03-07T12:09:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	the web server runs as a different user, and it doesn't have read access to your file
2007-03-07T12:09:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	you can browse to the file in nautilus, right click on it, choose "permissions", and give all users read access
2007-03-07T12:09:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	or you can type "chmod a+r /var/www/test.php"
2007-03-07T12:12:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	cool, glad it helped.
2007-03-07T12:13:00.000Z	ledbettj	owner_	you can open a nautilus window by typing "nautilus" or choosing one of the options from the "places" menu
