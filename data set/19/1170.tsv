2011-09-09T03:50:00.000Z	BarkingFish		a quick search of aptitude doesn't reveal that we have madwifi
2011-09-09T03:50:00.000Z	BarkingFish		I can find aircrack-ng, but not a madwifi package
2011-09-09T03:50:00.000Z	BarkingFish		!info madwifi-ng maverick
2011-09-09T03:51:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	you aren't going to get much help on injection attacks here
2011-09-09T03:52:00.000Z	BarkingFish	escott	I'm not the one who wants the info. If I'm not supposed to be helping with it, I apologise - I'll leave it alone.
2011-09-09T03:53:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	its ok... and sorry about the confusion. its just better to keep that questionable stuff off the channel if possible
2012-07-10T02:25:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	any old versions could be removed, but its better to remove them with dpkg -r linux-image-VERSION
2012-07-10T02:26:00.000Z	BarkingFish	escott	that's been done, his 19 and 17 series generic-pae are off, but there are still loads of old files left, which there doesn't appear to be linux-image-version files for.
2012-07-10T02:27:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	then have him purge them as well. if they are still around he can check with apt-file to see if any package claims the files and if not manually remove them
2012-07-25T04:03:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	so do you need a udev rule?
2012-07-25T04:00:00.000Z	BarkingFish	escott	I don't suppose you would be able to help me and Demon|Ubuntu, would you?
2012-07-25T04:00:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	haven't been following it.
2012-07-25T04:04:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	i think a udev rule would be the best way. check /lib/udev/rules.d/* for templates and then add a custom rule to /etc/udev/rules.d
2012-07-25T04:07:00.000Z	BarkingFish	escott	which template would I need?  75-net-description.rules?
2012-07-25T04:07:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	maybe... its not something i've ever done.
2012-07-25T04:08:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	although it seems to be one line after being generated "SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="48:5b:39:8c:06:b8", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
2012-07-25T04:08:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	thats for my eth0
2012-07-25T04:08:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	other than ATTR{address} being the MAC i don't really know what the rest means
2012-07-25T04:17:00.000Z	escott	BarkingFish	why would a more specific regex work when the global regex didn't. I would think something else in Demon|Ubuntu's line is wrong.
