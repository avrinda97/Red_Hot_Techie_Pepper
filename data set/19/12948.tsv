2005-06-11T14:57:00.000Z	glill32		hello, I'm a 62 year old retired police dispatcher from alabama, and my grandson told me about your ubuntu system so I got it loaded up on my computer. I did it all myself, just about, now I just can't get my screens set up quite right. My grandson said there was some community on this chat that could help me get it fixed up.
2005-06-11T14:58:00.000Z	glill32		But this time I am using Gaim.
2005-06-11T14:58:00.000Z	glill32		this is the same place, okay. should I re-explain my problem?
2005-06-11T14:59:00.000Z	glill32		well yes, and here's the thing...
2005-06-11T15:00:00.000Z	glill32		the system seems to act like I have another monitor... except that the other monitor now shows up all fuzzy and distorted, and when I move the mouse over there it's just a big square.
2005-06-11T15:02:00.000Z	glill32		see, I tried to manually rewrite the xorg.conf file for myself, and I must have broken it up somewhere in there.
2005-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	move it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old for example and start 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2005-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	and try inserting the right specifications for your monitor in that..
2005-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	glill32	wdh	when I do that, it's going to put it back in "Clone" mode, isn't it?
2005-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	user manual or manufacturers website
2005-06-11T15:04:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	not sure what you mean with the 'clone mode'
2005-06-11T15:05:00.000Z	glill32	wdh	it displays the same thing on both screens, and puts both screens in 640x480. Maybe it's safe mode.
2005-06-11T15:07:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	there is physically one monitor in which two screens appear?
2005-06-11T15:07:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	physically one monitor? or two?
2005-06-11T15:08:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	well, for the quite common configurations it is.. xinerama however is less used and therefore less bug-free
2005-06-11T15:10:00.000Z	glill32	wdh	sorry what was the command you told me to run after moving my xorg.conf?
2005-06-11T15:11:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2005-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	have you seen http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/XineramaHowTo ??
2005-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	wdh	glill32	good luck then :)
