2010-08-07T22:26:00.000Z	hussain		hey man help me to get link of open jdk
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 it should be in synaptic
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 do you have the partner repos enabled?
2010-08-07T22:27:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 actually the partner repos arnt necessary  I believe
2010-08-07T22:29:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	  try  sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
2010-08-07T22:30:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 rather  that was for you   try  sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
2010-08-07T22:30:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 why do you want opne  jre?
2010-08-07T22:31:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 which applets because open jre  icedtea will not run regular  java applications...at least in my expertience
2010-08-07T22:31:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 example  opnebravo
2010-08-07T22:31:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 you definitly need sun java 6 for that
2010-08-07T22:34:00.000Z	hussain	coz_	jre not helping me, compile time errors.
2010-08-07T22:34:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	  mm  did you install it via synaptic???
2010-08-07T22:34:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 try sudo apt-get install -f
2010-08-07T22:34:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 then rerun the install
2010-08-07T22:36:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 no you need  sun-java6
2010-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 well hold on...
2010-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 if you are going to use sun java  i would open synaptic package manager and type in  icedtea  and everything that shows up right click and remove completely./...then
2010-08-07T22:39:00.000Z	coz_	hussain	 make sure the partner repositories are enabled... reload... search  sun java  and look for sun-java6-pugin which will pull down most of what you need then look for the jdk  for sun java in the same list and install that
