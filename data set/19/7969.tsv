2007-06-06T09:05:00.000Z	neverblue		my "mini., max., and close" buttons are not in the top right hand corner, they are about an inch from it, is it maybe a theme i have loaded, and reloading it may fix it, or does someone else have an idea of what it is?
2007-06-06T09:05:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	using emerald?
2007-06-06T09:05:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	nope
2007-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	well if you were using emerald (with beryl) then we could modify that easily.  not sure how to do that for metacity.
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	is it only that one theme that does that?
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	no idea
2007-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	what errors (exactly) are you getting?
2007-06-06T09:14:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	so is your desktop borked?
2007-06-06T09:14:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	not entirely
2007-06-06T09:14:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	but its not acting normal
2007-06-06T09:15:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	my backspace/space are not repeating when held down, my menu icons are missing, not able to adjust my themes, meatcity is installed
2007-06-06T09:15:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	i'd re-install the desktop.
2007-06-06T09:15:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	and the above stated issue, my min./max./close are in a strange spot
2007-06-06T09:17:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	i'd purge the ubuntu-desktop and then re-install it.  backup your data first though.
2007-06-06T09:17:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	use aptitude though, instead of apt-get.
2007-06-06T09:20:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	?
2007-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	i'm here.  yeah, i'd shut down X before I did all that.
2007-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue	teamwork	so just do it in a ttyl?
2007-06-06T09:30:00.000Z	teamwork	neverblue	and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
