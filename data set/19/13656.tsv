2005-02-19T11:58:00.000Z	eskilo		which is the "most secure", sha1 sha256 md5 ripemd160 ??
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	Skif	eskilo	what do you mean by "most secure"?
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	eskilo		most secure seems extremely straightforward to me..
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	eskilo		for a given key size, which one is hardest to crack..
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	eskilo		why do people make things like md5 if sha1 is better?
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	Skif		SHA-1 has a slightly lower collision rate than MD5, IIRC
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	eskilo		for a given algorithm it does
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	Skif	eskilo	'coz md5 is about 5 times faster
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	Skif		and sometimes you don't mind
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	eskilo		i guess i should ask, which algorithm has the best ratio of check time vs. crack time..
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	eskilo		that's silly
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	Skif	eskilo	computer security is all about how hard you want them to work for it
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	eskilo		you can encrypt things such that all the compuers on earth couldn't crack them in a million years.
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	eskilo		that's a reality.
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	Skif	eskilo	even if you could, it's still crackable.  It's all about tradeoffs-- time vs. space vs. recoverability
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	eskilo		you can encrypt things such that even if every atom in the universe was trying to crack them at the rate of atomic vibrations, it would take billions ofy ears.
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	Skif	eskilo	I'd ask how, but I'm afraid you will tell me.  The fact is, we're not there yet.
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	eskilo		is anyone here using off-the-record encryption on your im?
2005-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	eskilo	Skif	 make a key such that 10^the_number_of_digits_in_that_key is greater than the number of atomic vibrations that would occur in the universe in a few billion years.
