2012-03-31T20:39:00.000Z	FernandoCueva		anybody here knows how to make a shortcut link that will mount a harddrive while opening that folder, I have to mount my HD manually everytime I want to access that link
2012-03-31T20:40:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	umount the folder and put a script in the folder that calls to either mount (if it is in the fstab) or udisks if it is not and mounts the drive. that way if its empty is says "click_me.sh" and then mounts
2012-03-31T20:49:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	being in fstab doesn't mean it has to be mounted. there is nothing i know of that will mount the folder when it is accessed. the closest you can get to that behavior is to put a script "click_me_to_mount.sh" in the folder which will be visible when it is unmounted
2012-03-31T20:52:00.000Z	FernandoCueva	escott	so you were saying i should replace the desktop file for a script to mount the fs
2012-03-31T20:53:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	lets start with that current workflow. what does this desktop file do?
2012-03-31T20:55:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	so right now it just opens an empty folder?
2012-03-31T20:55:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	what command do you use to mount that folder?
2012-03-31T20:59:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	ok. so what happens is that nautilus knows that when you go to places it needs to mount the partition, but thats because you are going through nautilus (the places menu) and not the desktop file. you can mount with a udisks command "udisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/######" replacing #### with the correct uuid. put that command in a file start it with #!/bin/bash on the first line. save it and chmod +x it, unmount the parti
2012-03-31T21:53:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	sudo blkid will print out the uuid associated with each /dev/sdX# and you can match that up with what you see in disk utility if you dont know the device
2012-03-31T21:57:00.000Z	FernandoCueva	escott	but I dont know how to use it
2012-03-31T21:58:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	why don't you run "sudo blkid" and send that to use through paste.ubuntu.com, and then mount the partition through places and send the output of "mount"
2012-03-31T22:13:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	were you messaging me earlier? if you were please repeat with my nickname
2012-03-31T22:14:00.000Z	FernandoCueva	escott	how do I change the location display with what I see with control L but make it so it stays permante
2012-03-31T22:15:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	i don't think you can. you could ctrl-L and then ctrl-C to copy it
2012-03-31T23:50:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	if you want you can install the dconf-utils and use dconf-editor to browse the different flags
2012-04-01T17:42:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	they know who it goes to. they have to otherwise they couldn't route it
2012-04-01T18:50:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	atheros is usually well supported
2012-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	the folder needs **5 permissions
2012-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	escott	FernandoCueva	or chmod o+rx
