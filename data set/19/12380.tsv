2006-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	justin_		Can I uninstall the Ubuntu desktop pack with - apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop?
2006-08-17T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	no.  that only uninstalls the meta package itself
2006-08-17T16:53:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	Ok so how do I go back to pure Xubuntu?
2006-08-17T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	You have to uninstall it all manually.  Unless you installed u-d with aptitude, or you can use deborphan
2006-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	Ok so if I install Ubuntu Desktop with aptitude I can remove it?
2006-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	yeah, and it'll remove all the dependencies you added with it
2006-11-30T06:51:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	don't be assinine
2006-11-30T06:53:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	Assinine about?
2006-11-30T06:53:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	asinine about telling him to google for a package
2006-11-30T06:54:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	There is packages for Assembly compilers? - well then I stand corrected.
2006-12-19T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	kubuntu uses adept package manager, not synaptic.
2006-12-19T06:00:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	Wow, that's not cool.
2006-12-19T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	I don't see how it's uncool.  But, sure.
2010-04-28T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	What error/message/whatever does it give you?
2010-04-28T11:05:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	none. It simply hangs when loading the xserver.
2010-04-28T11:05:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	Xserver? screen?
2010-04-28T11:06:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	ctrl-alt-f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6 (that's ctrl-alt-f#) can all be used simultaneously
2010-04-28T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	justin_	As a stop gap, of course.  I wouldn't actually consider doing that for prolonged periods ;)
2010-04-28T11:07:00.000Z	justin_	Flannel	Thanks for the tip.
