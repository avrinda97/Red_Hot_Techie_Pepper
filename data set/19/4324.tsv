2009-02-06T21:14:00.000Z	fsufitch		hi. does anyone know how i can stream data to my printer for it to continuously print?
2009-02-06T21:15:00.000Z	fsufitch		as in, as one continuous job
2009-02-06T21:16:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	Don't think I understand - can you explain why you want that?
2009-02-06T21:17:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	just to test out whether i can get the same functionality from "someprogram | lpr" as from "someprogram | less"
2009-02-06T21:19:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	Well, that would work, but it would spool the data until the app closed, then print it.
2009-02-06T21:19:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	yes i know. i tried.
2009-02-06T21:19:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	but is there any way i can get it to print the stuff as my program prints it out?
2009-02-06T21:20:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	or do i have to manually process the page breaks and submit separate jobs?
2009-02-06T21:20:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	You want it to print one line on the printer as one line comes from the app? What kind of printer is it?
2009-02-06T21:20:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	it's a regular laser printer. i'm just trying to do new stuff with it
2009-02-06T21:21:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	*nix heritage goes all the way back to paper terminals, so such a thing is undoubtedly possible, but probably not with a lot of modern printers.
2009-02-06T21:21:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	i guess i'll have to write a software middleman to this
2009-02-06T21:21:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	thanks anyway :)
2009-02-06T21:21:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	Probably your best bet, anyway.
2009-02-06T21:22:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	Probablly not harder than a few lines of Perl.
2009-02-06T21:22:00.000Z	fsufitch	ramirand_	that's Python, to you
2009-02-06T21:23:00.000Z	fsufitch		aright, cya
2009-02-06T21:23:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	Heheh, sorry, it'd take 10 minutes to write in Perl (for me), but writing it in Python would probably take an hour..
2009-02-06T21:24:00.000Z	ramirand_	fsufitch	At least 45 minutes of language review, 5 minutes of searching for tab/space errors. ;)
