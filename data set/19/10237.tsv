2006-07-09T09:42:00.000Z	Blake_		just upgradded to dapper and now wireless wont work, using an acx111 card, no encryption, and none of the usual tricks work, ive read network-manager might work but cant install it without a connection, the hardware and driver (ndiswrapper) are recognized but cant find the accespoints
2006-07-09T09:42:00.000Z	Blake_		pleease, anyone?
2006-07-09T09:43:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	is your card turned on? make sure it is, then run 'sudo ifup <interfacename>' then run 'iwlist scanning' and tell me if u get anything
2006-07-09T09:45:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	iwlist scanning returns no accesspoints?
2006-07-09T09:49:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	run iwconfig... should give you specifics about wireless only
2006-07-09T09:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	do yo have removable media?
2006-07-09T09:55:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	just go to packages.ubuntu.com and download network-manager and all dependancies
2006-07-09T09:55:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	then move them to the other comp. and use dpkg to install
2006-07-09T09:57:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	they should all be on the repos there
2006-07-09T09:59:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	u have to install them in certain order
2006-07-09T10:01:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	on the list on packages.ubuntu.com
2006-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	one other way..
2006-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	do dpkg -i <package names> (for all the packages)
2006-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	then when you do this for all, apt-get -f install should fix the configurations
2006-07-09T10:14:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	the other deps can probably be resoved by apt-get and CD
2006-07-09T10:14:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	apt-get -f install like i said... do it between packages see if it works
2006-07-09T10:15:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	best way to do it is after you install everything you have
2006-07-09T10:29:00.000Z	Blake_	pppoe_dude	think i can get away with just network-monitor and its deps, and not the recomended gnome-network-monitor and all its deps too?
2006-07-09T10:30:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Blake_	you might... but some of the other deps are actually part of the interface
