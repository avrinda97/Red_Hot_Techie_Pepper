2010-06-23T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	just use the OS. It will teach you a lot more than any document or book can show you
2010-06-23T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	its like these admins who do a lot of courses but are rubbish when it comes to real life systems. Books only show you so much. Using the system will teach you more and will teach you better
2010-06-24T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	that's is a windows app so is no use to you. You are using ubuntu which isn't windows
2010-06-24T22:24:00.000Z	abhinav_singh	ActionParsnip	 is there any way to install that .exe file in ubuntu?
2010-06-24T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	there's wine but if its a driver file then its of no value to you whatsoever
2010-06-24T22:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	what is the exe for?
2010-06-24T22:27:00.000Z	abhinav_singh	ActionParsnip	it is for digital pen...
2010-06-24T22:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	yes but is it a software or a driver or what?
2010-06-24T22:28:00.000Z	abhinav_singh	ActionParsnip	it is a driver for digital pen
2010-06-24T22:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	then its no good to you. You need a linux driver. That is a windows driver. The cd is worthless to you
2010-06-24T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	websearch for the model of the pen in conjunction with linux. Also check the ubuntu hcl

2011-01-17T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	chmod +r filename   will give read access to a file (or folder)
2011-01-21T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	logging in as root isn't advised nor supported
2011-07-22T21:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	i686 = 32bit  x86_64 = 64bit
2011-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	abhinav_singh	dpkg -l | grep gnome | grep lib     should do it
