2007-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	ShortWave		to get this where I want it, I actually have to fucking install it.
2007-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	ShortWave		Arrrrghhhhh
2007-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	ShortWave		or
2007-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	ShortWave		I could make my own liveCD
2007-04-26T08:54:00.000Z	ShortWave		hrm
2007-04-26T08:55:00.000Z	ShortWave		what to do, what to do
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	ShortWave		RAID?
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	ShortWave		whatch00 wanna know 'bout raid?
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	ShortWave		in /etc/inittab that is
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	ShortWave		that would be your starting point, that being the thing that cranks the system up
2007-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	aMMgYrP	ShortWave	I have a hardware RAID 5 set up, but when i try to install server 7.04 64bit, it does not recognise the raid, it attempts to partition the drives as though there were no raid.
2007-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	ShortWave	aMMgYrP	 what kind of RAID controller?
2007-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	ShortWave	aMMgYrP	 SOME hardware RAID controllers don't need to be recognized (like say on a Dell 2850 server)
2007-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	aMMgYrP	ShortWave	It is a custom built box, with a PCI Silicon Integrated Systems, Sata CArd/Raid controller.
2007-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	aMMgYrP	ShortWave	Yes.
2007-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	aMMgYrP	ShortWave	I wiped the Suse install because it was having issues with the onboard ethernet card.
2007-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	ShortWave	aMMgYrP	 I run Fedora Core on my servers.
2007-04-26T09:08:00.000Z	ShortWave	aMMgYrP	 so like, does it do logical drives? if the RAId controller is showing up as one drive, then you're fine. It doesn't need a /dev/mdX device or anything, since it's hardware
2007-04-26T09:08:00.000Z	ShortWave	aMMgYrP	 /dev/mdX is for linux-controlled RAID. hardware RAID == different beast.
