2005-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	logikal_		How do i extract in the terminal? I dont know how..
2005-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	do you mean like a .bz2?
2005-10-16T13:32:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	tar xvjf standard-1.9.tar.bz2
2005-10-16T13:33:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	the "tar" is the decompressor
2005-10-16T13:33:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	the "j" is for .bz2
2005-10-16T13:34:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	the "v" was for verbose, to tell you what it extracted
2005-10-16T13:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	"man tar" for more info, but it should be extracted
2005-10-16T13:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	working directory
2005-10-16T13:36:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	if it didn't do it, try what foXgamer said
2005-10-16T13:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	you are in the directory where the file is, right?
2005-10-16T13:40:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	"ls"
2005-10-16T13:40:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	you should have a folder of the same name as the compressed file
2005-10-16T13:42:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	perhaps you should move it to the mplayer skin folder in your home directory
2005-10-16T13:43:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	it may be hidden, "ls -a"
2005-10-16T13:44:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	hidden files are designated with a "./"
2005-10-16T13:46:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	what doesn't work, the skins?
2005-10-16T13:47:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	then skins are pretty pointless at this stage, :P
2005-10-16T13:48:00.000Z	tristanmike	logikal_	ok, you did what it says
