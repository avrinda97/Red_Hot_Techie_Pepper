2008-08-16T22:15:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	home,root,parent,local/share/Trash? Sorry still new at this.
2008-08-16T22:15:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	~/.local/share/Trash
2008-08-16T22:16:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	in your home directory, go to View --> show hidden files. you will then see a folder called .local
2008-08-16T22:22:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	when I try to delete contents of trash it duplicates or reproduces itself??? virus?
2008-08-16T22:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	do shift+delete. to completely del.
2008-08-16T22:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	if you press del, it moves the file to trash
2008-08-16T22:25:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	do I delete the folders in trash called "files, info"? I was able to delete the contents
2008-08-16T22:25:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	everything in the trash is safe to delete.
2008-08-16T22:26:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	excellent Thank You again.
2008-08-16T22:27:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	would you believe they were deleted but have now reappeared??
2008-08-16T22:28:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	that is fine... those folders keep track of things...
2008-08-16T22:29:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	I meant the files I deleted in the Trash magically reappeared. Wierd
2008-08-16T22:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	candive	the files and info foldrs?
2008-08-16T22:31:00.000Z	candive	Odd-rationale	I think I understand now they are only .ini files ThankYou
