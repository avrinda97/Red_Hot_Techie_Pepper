2006-07-10T07:24:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	use good passwords
2006-07-10T07:26:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	i don't quite get you, what do you mean?
2006-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	you want to blacklist certain user-agents? or possible whitelist known browsers
2006-07-10T07:29:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	check the cgi variable HTTP_USER_AGENT
2006-07-10T07:29:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	note that it can be faked
2006-07-10T07:31:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	for starters, define your actual problem (not the solution you think you need)
2006-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	gioacchino	rixxon	 1) I had xmlspy 2006 rel 3 ( a xml testual editor for windows ) cracked
2006-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	are you using cracked software? or what do you mean?
2006-07-10T07:41:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	so you want to block xmlspy, but not the webserver itself?
2006-07-10T07:43:00.000Z	rixxon	gioacchino	the purpose of this channel is not to help with cracked software ....
