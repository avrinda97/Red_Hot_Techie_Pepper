2010-11-05T21:38:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		why did i get thrown into ubuntu-unregged
2010-11-05T21:39:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		that would be incorrect
2010-11-05T21:39:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		because i've been regged for months
2010-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		wrong password
2010-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		new install lmao
2010-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		anyway... my volume control does everything but control my volume
2010-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		it makes sammiches, but can't turn audio up
2010-11-05T21:42:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		anyone have any idea why my stock volume control applet in ubuntu 10.10 won't control my volume?
2010-11-05T21:42:00.000Z	xangua	rinku_kokiri	dod you uninstall pulseaudio¿
2010-11-05T21:44:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	xangua	no i unstalled gstreamer-pulseaudio[insertnumbershere[
2010-11-05T21:45:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	xangua	because of a disconnect issue i was having,  now the sound doesn't stop randomly (unless adobe crashes) but rather, my volume control will quit working (i have to manually adjust it from the sound preferences window) and when i turn my vol all the way down, it unfades my sound from the back, putting it full center, killing my eardrums
2010-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	xangua	rinku_kokiri	then reinstall what you removed
2010-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	xangua	that didn't cause the problem
2010-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	xangua	the problem was here before i uninstalled a problematic codec
2010-12-26T06:10:00.000Z	xangua	rinku_kokiri	stop expecting we guess, are you using hardy heron¿
2010-12-26T06:11:00.000Z	xangua	rinku_kokiri	then would you provide some useful information¿
2010-12-26T06:11:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	xangua	have.. flash does not let anything else play audio
2010-12-26T06:12:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	xangua	sorry if i seem short, i've been trying to figure this out all day
2010-12-31T07:51:00.000Z	xangua	rinku_kokiri	stop that
