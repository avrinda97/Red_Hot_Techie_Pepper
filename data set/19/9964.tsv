2006-08-24T07:23:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	I bellieve it is md5sum.exe?
2006-08-24T07:24:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	but Bill don't furnish it. You will have get download the execute binary and install it to run it.
2006-08-24T07:25:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	yeah, md5sum xxx.iso
2006-08-24T07:26:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	yeah Whatsisname VOYAGER says and compare numbers
2006-08-24T07:27:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	there is a text file at the sight of your iso that has the md5sum numbers in it that the md5sum.exe output generates
2006-08-24T07:28:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	an incorrectly downloaded file will generate different md5sums
2006-08-24T07:31:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	like files will generate like md5sums when you run md5sum and read the output
2006-08-24T07:31:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	think of the md5sum as the total and correct number of bites in the file
2006-08-24T07:33:00.000Z	w30	Don_jr	the other supposedly matching number will be posted on the internet at the same place that offered the iso file for downloading
