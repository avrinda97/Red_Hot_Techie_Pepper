2009-04-23T12:18:00.000Z	DaveWM		friend of mine just linked me to this "Ubuntu 8.10 "Intrepid Ibex" Minimal CD 9.9MB"
2009-04-23T12:19:00.000Z	DaveWM		that may be about what i need i suppose
2009-04-23T12:19:00.000Z	DaveWM		heh
2009-04-23T12:19:00.000Z	DaveWM		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2009-04-23T12:19:00.000Z	DaveWM		yeah,  which is pretty much what i wanted
2009-04-23T12:20:00.000Z	DaveWM		cause atm,  when i install debian,  i use the netinst,  and skip the install tasks at the end,  which leaves me with base system,  networking,  apt...
2009-04-23T12:22:00.000Z	DaveWM		sweet
2009-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	DaveWM		to be honest,  i'd been bad mouthing ubuntu along with others for a while... and really the only reason is that i find the standard install a bit bloated...  which isnt really a good reason,  cause most distributions fall under that category with a default installation
2009-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	DaveWM		and its apparent that ubuntu repo's rule,  and you can find information specifically reguarding ubuntu much easier than any other distribution
2009-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	DaveWM		heh
2009-04-23T12:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	i find the standard install bloated too, I have a script to wrench about half the installed apps
2009-04-23T12:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	most of the stuff is standard, like configuring apache will be identical in all linuxes
2009-04-23T12:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	and samba
2009-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	if you want minimal, try xpud
2009-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	boots in 4 seconds here
2009-04-23T12:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	true, its a bit young yet but keep an eye on it
2009-05-07T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	they will all give you flash
2009-05-07T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	i dont use any of those myself and keep myself updated with the tar.gz file. but its easier and quicker to use the packages
2009-05-07T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaveWM	as far as i've seen, they all do the same trick
