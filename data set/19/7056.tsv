2007-11-02T08:29:00.000Z	Kalumba		Just a quick question: Is the Intel 4965 driver in Ubuntu's repository so it is easy to install?
2007-11-02T08:30:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	it works in the default install.  no additional stuff necessary
2007-11-02T08:30:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	apparently not for me with the live CD of gutsy
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	the final release of Gutsy?
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	Kalumba		7.10
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	the driver is not listed in the Restricted Drivers Manager
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	well, yes, but are you sure it isnt a Beta or Release Candidate CD?
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	its not a Restricted Driver.  It's a kernal module
2007-11-02T08:32:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	a bit odd as the previous one, 3945, showed up as a restricted driver
2007-11-02T08:33:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	perhaps that was before Intel went open source.  all of their wifi drivers are open source and included in gutsy
2007-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	well in that case I need to check the version of gutsy, but I am pretty sure it is 7.10 final
2007-11-02T08:35:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	and it doesn't recognise the card at all?
2007-11-02T08:35:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	hang on
2007-11-02T08:38:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	ifconfig shows a wlan0. Could that be it?
2007-11-02T08:38:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	yep.  unless you have another wifi card in
2007-11-02T08:39:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	excellent! Then all is set and I can safely install Ubuntu on this computer. Thanks
2007-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	one more question: Is there a more graphic tool to connect to a ISP with PPPoE than pppoeconf ?
2007-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	nrp	Kalumba	sorry, don't know.  I haven't used PPPoE
2007-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	Kalumba	nrp	ok, thanks anyway.
