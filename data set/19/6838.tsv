2012-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	chris_33		is
2012-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	You can use ps or top. Also htop is nice (You'll have to install it)
2012-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Oh, wait.. bottom right :P
2012-11-17T05:11:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Sorry, mate. Hrmm!
2012-11-17T05:12:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Did you do this? gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist
2012-11-17T05:16:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Xubuntu uses XFCE instead of Unity. Lubuntu uses LXDE.
2012-11-17T05:16:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	They're lightweight alternatives to Unity, GNOME and KDE for machiens that do not have rippin' powerful GPUs and gigabytes of ram..
2012-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	I would say probably Lubuntu or Xubuntu.
2012-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	KDE is also great, however if you have sluggish performance with Ubuntu Kubuntu will be no improvement.
2012-11-17T05:18:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Lubuntu or Xubuntu, yup :p
2012-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Yea, Lubuntu is fully supported. It's the same system, only using Lxde instead of Gnome/Unity.
2012-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Wow that's dirty, I thought it was a full OS.. Just an upgrade whoa, who would pay for an upgrade disk? What if the system had problems down the road, wouldn't you need to install Win7, then upgrade all overagain?!
2012-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Honestly you can also just do sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
2012-11-17T05:30:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	He doesn't mean that Lubuntu crashed his hd. All the Ubuntu's use the same kernel, which is waht would be in control of your disk (Not lxde hehe)
2012-11-17T05:32:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Both are fine. With the disk image you're downloading, you'll lose your current Ubuntu system I think. From a terminal you can add lxde to your current system.
2012-11-17T05:56:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	It depends on the game in question. Check the appdb. Some games run amazingly fast in Wine, some run horribly sluggish in Wine (WINE is a compatibility layer that allows Windows games/programs to run natively on Linux.)
2012-11-17T05:56:00.000Z	michealPW	chris_33	Wine is a work in progress and not all games are engineered the same way, therefore there will be huge variations.. http://appdb.wine.org/ I believe.
