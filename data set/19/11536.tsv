2006-01-13T16:05:00.000Z	globe		can I use apt-get to get a c compiler ?
2006-01-13T16:05:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	you should already have gcc installed
2006-01-13T16:06:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	I dont....or at least its not in my PATH
2006-01-13T16:06:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	what version of gcc do you want? I wouldnt reccomend 4.0 if your doing anything *serious*
2006-01-13T16:08:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	honestly I dont have time to do any C programming on my own.  I am looking for something to complie expocity
2006-01-13T16:08:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	well, you'll be better with gcc 3.4
2006-01-13T16:08:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	okay, thanks.  apt-get install gcc 3.4?
2006-01-13T16:10:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	yup
2006-01-13T16:12:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	well, you have a compiler already
2006-01-13T16:15:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	 Thanks for your help.  When I try an do a ./configure for this install script it says that I dont have any compilers in my $PATH
2006-01-13T16:15:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	well, does it work now?
2006-01-13T16:16:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	nope...still same msg.  do  Ihave to add the g++ (4.0, turns out) compiler path to my $PATH manually?
2006-01-13T16:16:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	why using 4.0? it has number of problems :/
2006-01-13T16:16:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	have you apt-geted gcc?
2006-01-13T16:17:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	yep. it said "0 upgraded, "
2006-01-13T16:17:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	go to synaptic
2006-01-13T16:18:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	just go in synaptic
2006-01-13T16:20:00.000Z	globe	Pygi	okay.  is there a reason that gcc3.4 pkg cant be found in apt-get but it is listed in synaptic
2006-01-13T16:20:00.000Z	Pygi	globe	not sure :/
