2010-03-11T06:22:00.000Z	NotTooSmart		My power went out today, when I rebooted my ubuntu machine I cannot connect to my mpd server, my samba server, or open ssh, the Ip is the same and grabbed via dhcp, any ideas?
2010-03-11T06:23:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	try setting a static ip and rebooting it
2010-03-11T06:26:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	its got the correct ip...
2010-03-11T06:34:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	are all those servers separate machines? or where are they all running?
2010-03-11T06:34:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	one machine
2010-03-11T06:34:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	what os are you using to try to connect to it?
2010-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	um, im doing it locally
2010-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	and on winxp and its just not working
2010-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	I have one machine that runs mpd, samba and openssh, its ubuntu 9.10
2010-03-11T06:36:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	is this the first time you've had issues after rebooting? have you tried rebooting once?
2010-03-11T06:36:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	yea never had problems before today
2010-03-11T06:36:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	how are you verifying what IP ubuntu has?
2010-03-11T06:36:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	I can ping out from the server to google etc and ifconfig -a shows it as being the right ip
2010-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	idk whats going on
2010-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	have you tried restarting the server?
2010-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	twice
2010-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	do you have any other computers running ubuntu besides the server you can use?
2010-03-11T06:38:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	chelz	umm, nope...
2010-03-11T06:41:00.000Z	chelz	NotTooSmart	home servers should have static IPs set, for the record avoids issues down the line.
