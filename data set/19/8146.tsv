2009-01-15T09:47:00.000Z	Gnea	girlbuntu	okay then, well we can help you, but you need to, please, be patient. we have been trying to help you, but everytime someone tries to, the only thing i see you doing is freaking out with all of the punctuation. that doesn't solve problems, it only creates more problems. do you understand?
