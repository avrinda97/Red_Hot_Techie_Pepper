2011-08-20T22:19:00.000Z	uns0b1ll		greets, not going to be pessimist but im switching to ubuntu from freebsd
2011-08-20T22:19:00.000Z	uns0b1ll		for ffs why cant freebsd keep things simpler and have support for things
2011-08-20T22:19:00.000Z	uns0b1ll		where do i edit my networking - cant find /etc/rc.conf
2011-08-20T22:20:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	It's been awhile since I've used FBSD on a desktop, but it never seemed overly complicated to me.
2011-08-20T22:20:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	You can't compare it to ubuntu/debian/rhel/centos.  You can compare it to arch linux, or crux however.
2011-08-20T22:21:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	If you're using the desktop, use network manager, otherwise, /etc/network/interfaces
2011-08-20T22:22:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	networkmanager is a gnome thing that ubuntu is fond of using for gui config.  On the desktop, it's best to stick with that and not use the files, as it can get confused.
2011-08-20T22:23:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Seriously?  gedit isn't part of the fbsd gnome desktop packages?
2011-08-20T22:23:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	generally put a persons name followed by a colon, and the IRC client highlights it for that user.
2011-08-20T22:24:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Or for a private conversation, you use /msg, but generally that's frowned upon in help channels.  People like to hear what other people suggest, and add to it, suggest alternatives, correct the suggestions, etc.
2011-08-20T22:24:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Yup, that worked.
2011-08-20T22:26:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Probably xbuntu then.  XFCE based ubuntu desktop, and since XFCE uses gnome, it's got just enough gnome for everything to run.
2011-08-20T22:27:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Well, ubuntu has it's own frustrations using X, as it autoconfigures everything, leaving you no xorg.conf to peruse and edit if you don't like something.
2011-08-20T22:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Heh, have fun, I generally turn off eyecandy, so I never know where to turn it on.
2011-08-20T22:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	yes.  Unless you are the default gateway, of course.
2011-08-20T22:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	I think so.  I don't have an example infront of me.   Just "gateway"
2011-08-20T22:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Pretty sure there's a good manpage on it.
2011-08-20T22:32:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	Errr /etc/init.d/networking restart.
2011-08-20T22:32:00.000Z	Kyle__	uns0b1ll	I think.
