2007-03-26T08:11:00.000Z	sogen		someone here using teamspeak i need some help to configure it :/
2007-03-26T08:12:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	yes i do ... and it doesn't work well. it still uses oss. i have never got it working relaiably
2007-03-26T08:13:00.000Z	sogen	Spliffster	my problem is that i cant talk to ppl and i dont hear them
2007-03-26T08:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	or IIRC Teamspeak client accesses /dev/dsp directly which is a bad idea. only one programm can access it at a time. alsa or esd should take care of that. but TS Client bypasses al sound layers and opens the device directly. if teamspeak is open, other programs might not be able to access your sound card
2007-03-26T08:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	hold on a sec .. .booting the other computer where it is installed and configured
2007-03-26T08:16:00.000Z	sogen	Spliffster	i also cant make my green light om
2007-03-26T08:16:00.000Z	sogen		i tryed by button andnonthing
2007-03-26T08:17:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	when TS Client is open, go to "Settings > Options". the default way to access the sound system is "OSS", this should be selected. if you do not have OSS installed or OSS is not running ... you may choose Other = /dev/dsp. this, however, will render all other sound input/output useless (ie. if you are playing on this computer od listening to music ... this will make trouble).
2007-03-26T08:17:00.000Z	sogen	Spliffster	for example i set "push to talk" for ctrl then push and hold ctrl and my light dont turn on :(
2007-03-26T08:19:00.000Z	sogen	Spliffster	i have oss selected
2007-03-26T08:20:00.000Z	sogen		deafult (oss /dev/dsp)
2007-03-26T08:20:00.000Z	sogen	Spliffster	it still dont works :(
2007-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	it is also hardware dependent. you are better off asking in the TeamSpeak forum. i have a couple of friends ... all of them had strange problems with TS, none of them had the same problem though. so the problems are TS related ...
2007-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	sogen		btw it was working good on that system
2007-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	sogen		but i reinstaled team speak
2007-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	sogen		and now it dont works
2007-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	sogen		i have used uninstal script
2007-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	reboot and it might work again. it has to do how TS tries to access your audiocard
2007-03-26T08:23:00.000Z	Spliffster	sogen	have you checked that input/output devices are not muted/disabled in the mixer panel ... i know .. that's trivial ... but always good to check
