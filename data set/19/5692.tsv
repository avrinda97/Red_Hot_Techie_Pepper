2008-05-16T03:40:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm		Can anyone help me restore mp3 playback functionality to rhythmbox?
2008-05-16T03:42:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm		 PLEASE, someone! I've been here asking periodically since 2PM, can *anyone* help me fix mp3 playback in rhythmbox?
2008-05-16T03:43:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm		I haven't tried any others- I put ap ost in the forums with all the details here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=795534
2008-05-16T03:44:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm		Which program should I use?
2008-05-16T03:45:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm		installing vlc, will report shortly.
2008-05-16T03:45:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	I would try to completely remove ubuntu-restricted-extras, and installing it again
2008-05-16T03:46:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	I think so. I use synaptic for it all :P
2008-05-16T03:47:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	there's an option there for "complete removal"
2008-05-16T03:53:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	I would keep trying to reinstall the ubuntu-restricted-extras package for getting rhythmbox (gstreamer) to work. I can't help you with your synaptic problem though
2008-05-16T03:53:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	VLC uses different codecs
2008-05-16T03:55:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	aptitude remove ubuntu-restricted-extras
2008-05-16T03:55:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	then synaptic install
2008-05-16T04:11:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	have you installed the "ugly" plugins as well? and the "multiverse variant" of both bad and ugly?
2008-05-16T04:11:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	hyjal	what are those?
2008-05-16T04:11:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	hyjal	I saw those listed, but didn't know if I should get them or not...
2008-05-16T04:12:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	those are more codecs, maybe mp3 is in there. I would just install ubuntu-restricted-extras and have them all tbh
2008-05-16T04:12:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	aha, ok. then the "ugly" and "bad" codecs should already be installed, as restricted depend on those
2008-05-16T04:13:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	hyjal	hmm. I'll try reinstalling, then.
2008-05-16T04:13:00.000Z	hyjal	thisusernamewasm	alright
