2006-01-06T10:20:00.000Z	brasko_		Does the .xinitrc file get used when the system starts?
2006-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	brasko_		no, not VNC, I'm native on the linux box
2006-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	brasko_		The window manager doesn't start by default
2006-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	brasko_		I have to start it
2006-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	brasko_		I'm wondering if root starts the window manager, or my local user?
2006-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	brasko_		on a fresh boot
2006-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	brasko_		If I new which command it was, I could probalby keep starting it, until ti works
2006-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	brasko_		yeah, mutt
2006-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	brasko_		I've been using it for years. works nice.
2006-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	brasko_		so when I boot the machine, is there a log of the stuff that it does?
2006-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	timfrost	brasko_	.xinitrc is not installed by breezy.  It must be an artifact of another distribution.
2006-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	brasko_		Yeah, unfortunatly I had debian installed before
2006-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	brasko_		isn't that kernal startup? Does it have all the services too? like X?
2006-01-06T10:25:00.000Z	brasko_		right, X was started, but from where?
2006-01-06T10:25:00.000Z	timfrost	brasko_	evilghost, the startup is under /etc/X11/gdm, and logs in /var/log/Xorg.<display>.0
2006-01-06T10:26:00.000Z	brasko_	timfrost	Is there supposed to be a window manager line in gdm.conf?
2006-01-06T10:28:00.000Z	brasko_		I prefer pork
2006-01-06T10:28:00.000Z	brasko_		It's an ncurses client, that you can use over ssh, and acts like irc
2006-01-06T10:28:00.000Z	timfrost	brasko_	xorg is starrted by /etc/init.d/xorg-common, and uses scripts under /etx/X11/gdm/ (or /etc/gdm), and one of those starts the window manager
