2006-06-21T16:35:00.000Z	george_looney		can anyone tell me where I can give my feedback regarding a package in the Universe section?
2006-06-21T16:35:00.000Z	george_looney		sort of
2006-06-21T16:35:00.000Z	george_looney		an oversight
2006-06-21T16:37:00.000Z	george_looney		do bugs for all sections go to bugs.ubuntu.com
2006-06-21T07:00:00.000Z	george_looney		hello all
2006-06-21T07:01:00.000Z	george_looney		what is "ubuntu-minimal" ?
2006-06-21T07:02:00.000Z	george_looney		does removing it remove all its dependecies??
2006-06-21T07:02:00.000Z	DBO	george_looney	its a meta package
2006-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	so I can remove it?
2006-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	DBO	george_looney	the depends will only be removed if you use aptitude, and you should NOT remove it
2006-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	what if I use apt-get?
2006-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	or just dpkg?
2006-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	DBO	george_looney	thats fine, but why?
2006-06-21T07:04:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	I had come across this dilemma with Warty?
2006-06-21T07:05:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	the default MTA was postfix, whereas I wanted exim
2006-06-21T07:05:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	but when I did a simulated apt-get install, it would remove postfix and ubunt-base!!
2006-06-21T07:12:00.000Z	DBO	george_looney	no, but you can download the deb from multiverse manually
2006-06-21T07:13:00.000Z	george_looney	DBO	ohhhhhh
