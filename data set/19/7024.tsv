2011-01-31T23:38:00.000Z	bj0rn		am i not the only one who has had network-manager removed due to an "update"?
2011-01-31T23:39:00.000Z	bj0rn		ffs
2011-01-31T23:41:00.000Z	bj0rn		gah
2011-01-31T23:42:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	you could connect without it, no need for a live cd...
2011-01-31T23:42:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	and then just sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
2011-01-31T23:43:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	when i boot to the normal install, apt-get fails to find repositories. I booted to liveCD, and used "apt-get install --download-only --reinstall network-manager" ( as well as network-manager-gnome and, for some reason, gnome-bluetooth )
2011-01-31T23:44:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	you need to put the .deb thatss downloaded onto the hard disk then so you can get it when you go back to your system
2011-01-31T23:44:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	following that, i have a network-manager icon in my panel, but "Enable Network-manager" is faded, and "services --status-all" shows [?] network-manager
2011-01-31T23:44:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	done that
2011-01-31T23:45:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	if you have the icon, then its not uninstalled...
2011-01-31T23:45:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	check /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf
2011-01-31T23:45:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	are your devices managed or unmanaged according to that?
2011-01-31T23:45:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	it is re-installed.. after copying the .deb and using gdebi
2011-01-31T23:45:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	one sec, mounting the drive
2011-01-31T23:47:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	file says "ifdown / managed=false"
2011-01-31T23:47:00.000Z	maco	bj0rn	make it true
2011-01-31T23:47:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	where / is a linebreak
2011-01-31T23:48:00.000Z	bj0rn	maco	brb as [thor] if this works .. hehe thanks
