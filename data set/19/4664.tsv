2008-11-26T20:53:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	For some reason, Ubuntu refuses to take a WPA-PSK key which is lesser than 9 numbers or containing any letters
2008-11-26T20:55:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	x61s
2008-11-26T20:56:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	emocow	yes. lol
2008-11-26T21:00:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	emocow	there is. right click on the card in your notification bar and click "Connecetion Information"
2008-11-26T21:00:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	emocow	it will say it under driver
2008-11-26T21:01:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	No interface here, only fluxbox
2008-11-26T21:01:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	What do you want to see in ifconfig?
2008-11-26T21:04:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	emocow	run sudo lshw | less --chop
2008-11-26T21:04:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	Yeah, well, I see it
2008-11-26T21:06:00.000Z	osxdude|laptop	emocow	the driver being used is ath_pci. Which means you have a atheros card.
2008-11-26T21:07:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	: That still doesn't answer the issue of ubuntu rejecting keys because they're lesser than 9 characters
2008-11-26T21:09:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	Oh, that's awesome.
2008-11-26T21:11:00.000Z	emocow	osxdude|laptop	Is there a link around or something?
