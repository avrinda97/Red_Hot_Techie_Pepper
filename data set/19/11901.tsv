2006-06-09T09:11:00.000Z	intelikey		Caught signal 11.  Server aborting
2006-06-09T09:13:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-06-09T09:14:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	thats where the error message came from
2006-06-09T09:14:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	have you run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	no.  there is nothing wrong with X.
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	the Xserver was running fine.  starting gnome-session is what brought it down.
2006-06-09T09:18:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	was this after a dapper upgrade?
2006-06-09T09:18:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	fluxbox is now connected to the xserver  working fine.    any thought on what might be wrong with gnome ?
2006-06-09T09:18:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	no.   hoary.
2006-06-09T09:19:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	it seems some folks are having issues upon upgrade bug #20371
2006-06-09T09:20:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	yeah.  i've been there.  i couldn't find anything i liked about dapper, so i wiped it and installed hoary.
2006-06-09T09:21:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	so this is a fresh install of hoary? and did you keep your /home data?
2006-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	if you have kept your gnome config files (.gnome* .gconf*), you might want to move them aside and see if the problem persists
2006-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	no it's not a /home problem  either...   jighead don't worry about it this is the first "default" install i've ever tried to use.   i'll remove gnome and install twm and be just 'pickeled tink' about it....
2006-06-09T09:24:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	thanks for the fish just the same.
2006-06-09T09:24:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	try xfce
2006-06-09T09:25:00.000Z	jighead	intelikey	that is, if you are looking for something between kde/gnome and twm/fluxbox
2006-06-09T09:27:00.000Z	intelikey	jighead	i've used xfce4 fvwm icewm blackbox and more, thanks tho
