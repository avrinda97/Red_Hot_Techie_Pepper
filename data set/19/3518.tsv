2011-09-30T13:25:00.000Z	paulus68		is there a way to show a progress bar when moving large files from 1 place to another?
2011-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	doesnt the file manager show that in "file operations" ?
2011-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	I run it in terminal since it's on a server
2011-09-30T13:27:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	oh ok rsync has a --progress option that should print out hashes
2011-10-04T15:01:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	du -h filename will tell you size of the file in human readable form
2011-10-04T15:01:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	use that in a test condition
2011-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	problem is here that the name of the file may change it could be saterdays backup or a complete backup so the best way is in my opinion to check how much space there is available if less then x search for the largest file on that location and move it to a new one
2011-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	df -h /partition/
2011-10-04T15:09:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	brb
2011-10-04T15:20:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	what would the command be to check the filesize in a specific dir in my it's /media/backup1/backups
2011-10-04T15:21:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	you mean the size of the entire directory?
2011-10-04T15:22:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	no the filesize within that directory
2011-10-04T15:22:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	du -sh directory should return 2G directory (2G is an example)
2011-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	filesize within the directory? you mean the individual sizes of each file?
2011-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	yes
2011-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	remove the s; du -h directory gives you a list of all files with their sizes (can be used in a for loop)
2011-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	thanks for these commands
2011-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	phlak_user	paulus68	yw
2011-10-04T15:29:00.000Z	paulus68	phlak_user	how would I be able to determine the largest file within that directory?
