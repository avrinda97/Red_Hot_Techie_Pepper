2007-09-13T08:17:00.000Z	zetheroo		is it possible that my graphics are being driven from another file other than my xorg.conf file?

2007-09-13T08:19:00.000Z	zetheroo		is it possible that my graphics are being driven from another file other than my xorg.conf file?
2007-09-13T08:19:00.000Z	zetheroo		well my xorg file is completely blank
2007-09-13T08:19:00.000Z	zetheroo		and here I am in GDE
2007-09-13T08:20:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	you can do a X -config or Xorg -config  to generate one then move it to /etc/X11/ dir i forget which command it is
2007-11-29T03:43:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	what do you want to do?
2007-11-29T03:43:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	ok install xp to some freespace but then youll need to reinstall grub as xp will hose the mbr
2007-11-29T03:44:00.000Z	zetheroo	pike_	I can't edit the grub.conf file so I don't have to reinstll GRUB?
2007-11-29T03:45:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	did you install windows or ubuntu first?
2007-11-29T03:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	pike_	I have Ubuntu Gutsy using my whole HDD
2007-11-29T03:46:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	like juano__ said grub actually is installed to the first 512bytes of the hd now it loads stuff from the boot partition but the mbr is actually what needs to be fixed after you install windows as windows will install its own mbr
2007-11-29T03:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	pike_	so how do I recover the mbr that I need?
2007-11-29T03:47:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	well idealy you install windows first then let ubuntu install last and it handles everything but if you install xp last then you need to follow that fixmbr link that ubotu mentioned
2007-11-29T03:49:00.000Z	zetheroo	pike_	ok I went to those links... but I am not finding anything like fixmbr
2007-11-29T03:50:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	ignore that just do the grub install thing in the steps on that page
2007-11-29T03:51:00.000Z	zetheroo	pike_	should I be tuning into the section called: recovering GRUB automatically ?
2007-11-29T03:52:00.000Z	pike_	zetheroo	yes gotta go good luck
2007-11-29T03:52:00.000Z	zetheroo	pike_	thanks
