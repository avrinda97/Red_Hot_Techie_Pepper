2011-09-10T22:48:00.000Z	shaun413	urlin2u	ok what would you reccomend?
2011-09-10T22:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	we don't do that this is for support like problems, sorry
2011-09-11T03:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	application button in unity paen working?
2011-09-11T03:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	have you tweaked compiz?
2011-09-11T03:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	that is your problem, go to tty crtl-alt-f1 and reboot to the classic, and look for a compiz website if your trying to get the cube.
2011-09-11T03:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	compiz is tricky in natty, it is part of the unity shell.
2011-09-11T03:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	yipee :D
2011-09-11T03:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	this link should help read it all carefully before tweaking. http://reformedmusings.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/howto-get-the-compiz-desktop-cube-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-and-unity/
2011-09-11T04:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	shaun413	you might try try #compiz  trying to get a hand hold through compiz is not really gonna happen to be honest.
