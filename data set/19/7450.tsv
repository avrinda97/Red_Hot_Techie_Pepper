2008-01-16T03:51:00.000Z	Devourer		Is there a program that can convert ogg to mp3?
2008-01-16T03:51:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	because oggs are better than mp3s :)
2008-01-16T03:52:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	But some things aren't compatible with ogg... =\
2008-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	nohup command
2008-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	thanks.
2008-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	when using nohup, I can I still CTRL+C in the console, and the program will close. Also, I'd like to be able to use that same console.
2008-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	nohup command &  # to send it into the background
2008-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	or press CTRL+Z  to suspend the task currently in the foreground and type bg  to send it into the background
2008-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	I have to use #?
2008-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	 # marks the beginning of a comment .. so no, but it doesn't matter
2008-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	I think I've been using the & operator wrong. I would append it directly to the end of the line with no space. :o
2008-08-25T05:28:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	most shells don't mind extraneous white-space
2008-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	because they are bash builtins ... help fg, help bg, etc
2008-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	oh. Thanks.
2008-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	would you term it as a special character?
2008-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	it's a special file actually
2008-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	it's a file?
2008-08-25T05:35:00.000Z	unop	Devourer	yep .. technically directories are files
2008-08-25T05:35:00.000Z	Devourer	unop	oh, strange. I never knew that. =]
