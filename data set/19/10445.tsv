2007-06-12T16:15:00.000Z	foomanchew		in terms of search tools for the desktop, what are the top tools ??
2007-06-12T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	beagle and tracker
2007-06-12T16:16:00.000Z	foomanchew	jrib	tracker ?
2007-06-12T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	yep
2007-06-12T16:16:00.000Z	foomanchew		beagle is a tad 'irratable'
2007-06-12T16:17:00.000Z	foomanchew		I want search integration similar to OS X spotlight ?
2007-06-12T16:17:00.000Z	foomanchew		and I want my chocolate cake
2007-06-12T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	yes, use one of those tools along with the deskbar applet
2007-06-12T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	visit your nearest bakery?
2007-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	foomanchew	jrib	LOL thanks
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	foomanchew	jrib	which of the 2 do u use ?
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	I like tracker
2007-06-12T16:23:00.000Z	foomanchew	jrib	does Tracker integrate with Deskbar ?
2007-06-12T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	yes, there is a plugin.  But it was buggy (crashed when you login).  I'm not sure if they have fixed it.
2007-06-12T16:24:00.000Z	foomanchew		thanks all
2007-06-12T16:24:00.000Z	foomanchew		it is nice
2007-06-12T16:24:00.000Z	foomanchew		still busy indexing but it is quick
2007-06-12T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	foomanchew	libdeskbar-tracker if you want to try it.  I know the fix was committed somewhere but I'm not sure if it's gotten into ubuntu
