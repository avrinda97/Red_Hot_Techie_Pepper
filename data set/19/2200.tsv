2011-01-23T05:02:00.000Z	kv102t		E: Type ‘<html>’ is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list
2011-01-23T05:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	check the sources file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list
2011-01-23T05:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	it has syntax errors
2011-01-23T05:04:00.000Z	kv102t	erUSUL	hold it. what is this list for?
2011-01-23T05:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	it is what tells apt where to look for packages
2011-01-23T05:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	the one that is wrong seems to be for playonlinux judging by the filename
2011-01-23T05:05:00.000Z	kv102t	erUSUL	all packages or just playonlinux. i don't use it.
2011-01-23T05:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	the one that fails is the playonlinux one
2011-01-23T05:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	the error cearly states as much E: Type ‘<html>’ is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list
2011-01-23T05:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	remove the file if you do not use it
2011-01-23T05:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list
2011-01-23T05:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	kv102t	then run « sudo apt-get update »
2011-01-23T05:07:00.000Z	kv102t	erUSUL	i still get error
