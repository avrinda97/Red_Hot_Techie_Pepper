2008-01-08T23:48:00.000Z	neverblue		how can I force Nautilius to login on a network share ? (its logging in anonymously atm)
2008-01-08T23:48:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	places > connect to server
2008-01-08T23:50:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	yes, thats a quick fix, but can you answer my question directly ?
2008-01-09T00:32:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	would you like to expand you question? what are you trying to achieve? what sort of network share?
2008-01-09T00:33:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	thanks, that doesnt help me whatsoever
2008-01-09T00:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	also see   places > connect to server
2008-01-09T00:34:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	yes, I seen your previous reply, but thats not what I want, I want to change my current share to allow a login prompt, not to create a new share, from the beginning (if possible)
2008-01-09T00:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	oh you want to change the login name each time you use it?
2008-01-09T00:34:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	or even just initially
2008-01-09T00:35:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	places > connect to server  it has a box labelled 'user name'
2008-01-09T00:36:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	so I have to initialize a new share then, not just work with a currently set share ?
2008-01-09T00:43:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	did i lose you ?
2008-01-10T00:44:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	i am well aware of the triggers, I assist in the channel as well
2008-01-10T00:44:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	aaah ok
2008-02-08T21:56:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	webcams are not a simple setup
2008-04-01T20:19:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	might want to mention to not do it in the channel, as a password maybe exposed
2008-04-01T20:20:00.000Z	DRebellion	neverblue	only if he leaves out the slash, and then we can all laugh at his fail
2008-04-01T20:21:00.000Z	neverblue	DRebellion	he has been fighting with registering since yesterday, I wouldn't be suprised by anything s/he does
