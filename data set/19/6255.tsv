2008-11-18T02:07:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> could be in one line but could be in separate lines too
2008-11-18T02:07:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> thats why putting a ;   ends the command line in linux
2008-11-18T02:08:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> you can just look, you should see a file called  vmlinuz*  and initrd*
2008-11-18T02:09:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> now you can cd /mnt/boot/grub
2008-11-18T02:09:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> and pastebin the contents of  menu.lst
2008-11-18T02:10:00.000Z	n8tuser		buu-> how do you know it lost it?
2008-11-18T02:11:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> do an ls -la  to list the dir contents,  menu.lst should be listed
2008-11-18T02:12:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> pastebin the contents of  menu.lst
2008-11-18T02:12:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> cat menu.lst
2008-11-18T02:13:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	Sorry,  when I run startx as my regular user, I have two mirrored gnome desktops
2008-11-18T02:13:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	Moving the mouse moves it on both screens, etc.
2008-11-18T02:13:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	But  when I do 'sudo startx', I get my proper set up with just one gnome desktop and I can drag windows between screens and such
2008-11-18T02:14:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	I see the same problem when I log in as my user via gdm (the desktops are mirrored, etc)
2008-11-18T02:16:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	Sorry, am I supposed to compare the contents against those files after I've run startx as my regular user?
2008-11-18T02:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	buu	yes so you can see the difference?
2008-11-18T02:16:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	Let me check.
2008-11-18T02:19:00.000Z	buu	n8tuser	Thanks for all of your help.
2008-11-18T02:20:00.000Z	n8tuser	buu	you're welcome
