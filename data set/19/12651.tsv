2006-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	stuh84		Hey people, got a bit of a problem. Trying to get an extended desktop on Ubuntu and its just not playing nice. Its an ATI (Radeon 200M if you must know), I've installed the drivers for it, and done all the config stuff. It seems to work fine before the logon page, allowing to go between the two monitors, but once its loaded, I am constrained to one desktop only, the mouse will go to the left edge of the second screen and
2006-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	stuh84		will go no further. Anyone got any ideas?
2006-10-01T15:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Put the "other screen" onto the other side of the "normal" screen.  Does it fix anything?
2006-10-01T15:13:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Excuse the idiotic tone, but I think it's the best way to communicate: "Does it work if you put the mosue pointer all the way the other direction?"
2006-10-01T15:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Have you tried booting it while they are both plugged in?
2006-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	nvidia is a dream, indeed.
2006-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Are you using gnome?
2006-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Using hte proprietary drivers?
2006-10-01T15:18:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	I downloaded mine from the ATI website, I _knwo_ I am using the proprietary drivers. ARe you?
2006-10-01T15:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Just don't upgrade your kernel afterwards, ATI is finicky enough as it is.
2006-10-01T15:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	You should be able to do so without upgrading the kernel.
2006-10-01T15:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Or just backup your /home /etc and /var, and install edgy from scratch, then restore.
2006-10-01T15:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Forutnately, ati allows you to just click on the menu itself.
2006-10-01T15:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Indeed.
2006-10-01T15:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	We all love them :)
2006-10-01T15:53:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Is this a laptop?
2006-10-01T15:53:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Just so you know, some laptops don't support anything more than just cloning.
2006-10-01T15:53:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	But try changing the option using aticonfig, then restart X11.
2006-10-01T15:54:00.000Z	Arafangion	stuh84	Then you're stuffed. :(  I'm going to eat dinner now.
