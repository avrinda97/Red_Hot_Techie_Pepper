2007-11-24T16:16:00.000Z	snig		Can you help a newbie to choose between Wine/VirtualBox/KVM/Other software in order to run Windows under Ubuntu? I don't know which one is best...
2007-11-24T16:18:00.000Z	boyet	snig	use virtualbox
2007-11-24T16:19:00.000Z	snig	boyet	you are probably right, but why is virtualbox better?
2007-11-24T16:20:00.000Z	boyet	snig	virtualbox and other virtual machines have the same common ground but has pros and cons
2007-11-24T16:22:00.000Z	boyet	snig	yah keep learning new things EVERYDAY
2007-11-24T16:23:00.000Z	snig	boyet	sure I do, especially now since I installed Ubuntu yesterday (and haven't used Linux before)
2007-11-24T16:25:00.000Z	boyet	snig	hey your like me am a newbie too but this channel has given more knowledge by asking and asking the guys never wears-out in answering my sometimes nonsense newbie questions
2007-11-24T16:27:00.000Z	snig	boyet	sounds great that there are many nice people in here :)
2007-11-24T16:29:00.000Z	boyet	snig	they this why it excist to help the needy specialy us the newbies
2007-11-24T16:47:00.000Z	snig	boyet	sounds good. I've installed Ubuntu once, but don't think there was a step in the wizard where I could create a Ubuntu partition. Do I need to create it in advance of the installation?
2007-11-24T16:48:00.000Z	boyet	snig	try to check also your ram..if your gonna run the xp virtually well it eats a lot of resources
2007-11-24T16:49:00.000Z	snig	boyet	ok I will.
2007-11-24T16:53:00.000Z	boyet	snig	you can install virtualbox with the command line and everything but then the wierdest part is why have i going to run as root just to launch virtualbox. the answer is #vbox
2007-11-24T16:55:00.000Z	snig	boyet	What do you mean? "The answer is #vbox".
2007-11-24T16:55:00.000Z	boyet	snig	irc channel i mean
2007-11-24T16:56:00.000Z	boyet	snig	you can ask whatever in that station if you hav problems on virtualbox
2007-11-24T16:56:00.000Z	snig	boyet	ahh ok
2007-11-24T16:58:00.000Z	boyet	snig	well if ever you start installing the virtualbox read sharply every instructions and never miss a thing....
2007-11-24T16:59:00.000Z	snig	boyet	I will
