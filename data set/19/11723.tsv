2005-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	do you use any opengl apps on you're machine?
2005-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 Not too many.
2005-12-02T09:22:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	and do they all function ok or behave badly? oh, and are you on Breezy?
2005-12-02T09:22:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 Breezy.  Seems to work ok here...
2005-12-02T09:23:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	arr, would you mind making you're xorg.conf and glxinfo output available to me?
2005-12-02T09:24:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 No problem!  In the pastebin shortly...
2005-12-02T09:25:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	much appreciated :-)
2005-12-02T09:26:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 xorg.conf is --> paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5125
2005-12-02T09:26:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 glxinfo is  -->  paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5126
2005-12-02T09:28:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 Did that provide you the info you wanted?
2005-12-02T09:29:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	Yep, just read them and xorg is near identical, glxinfo is identical.. I don't suppose you use wine, cedega or Enemy Territory on that at all?
2005-12-02T09:29:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 No.  Sorry!
2005-12-02T09:30:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	oh well, if you do you will find some major problems
2005-12-02T09:30:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 I take it you have some problems with them.
2005-12-02T09:30:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 I see.
2005-12-02T09:30:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	I think Breezy has some opengl issues on i915's
2005-12-02T09:31:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 Hmm.  This is just my laptop so nothing too fancy here.  I haven't even tried any gaming with it yet.
2005-12-02T09:32:00.000Z	Burkey	rob_p	yeah, I have my athlon64 for that but since I travel a lot, really need to get it all going on my laptop too
2005-12-02T09:32:00.000Z	rob_p	Burkey	 Actually, I've never spent any real time gaming so I probably won't be affected by the issues you've experienced.
