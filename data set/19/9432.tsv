2006-11-07T13:27:00.000Z	neobonzi		I think its funny how i got beryl to work on edgy but my stupid wireless card doesnt work
2006-11-07T13:28:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	you trying to use ndiswrapper with bcmwl5a on edgy?
2006-11-07T13:30:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	from what I read (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286924) the ndiswrapper packaged with edgy is broken
2006-11-07T13:30:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	so everyone is having problems
2006-11-07T13:31:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	haha thats like a punch to the groin is what that is
2006-11-07T13:31:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	the solution seems to go to ndiswrapper.sf.net and make the source yourself. Very painful :'(
2006-11-07T13:32:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	im a noob, i dont think i can do that but if its not impossible i would ike to
2006-11-07T13:32:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	you can do it!
2006-11-07T13:33:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	okay Step 1: What does 'making source' mean
2006-11-07T13:33:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	1) download source from ndiswrapper.sf.net
2006-11-07T13:33:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	okay on it
2006-11-07T13:40:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper#head-c1ebf95637d110c5f01b9a1383d137f79d8cbddb is what you need to be looking at
2006-11-07T13:40:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	that should guide you through it better than I can
2006-11-07T13:41:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	you have workspaces, <ctrl><alt>Left/Right/Up/Down to change workspace
2006-11-07T13:44:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	how long does it take before i can start writing these guides instead of blindly typing them into my console
2006-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	not too long, you'll pick most of them up pretty quickly
2006-11-07T13:48:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	Okay i got stuck - im on part 4.4 that says building deb packages, its not letting me do it int he terminal
2006-11-07T13:49:00.000Z	GNeu	neobonzi	did you read the note, you shouldn't need to do that
2006-11-07T13:50:00.000Z	neobonzi	GNeu	im not too fond of reading
