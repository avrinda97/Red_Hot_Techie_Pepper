2007-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	Madnez		anyone knows how to get root access for another partitioned drive, that one using NTFS?
2007-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	be root, access the drive
2007-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	Madnez		i am root
2007-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	so you've got root access to it then
2007-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	Madnez	gordonjcp	there is a string command
2007-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	Madnez		what about transferring data?
2007-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	what exactly are you trying to do?
2007-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	Madnez		i can access it, i cant send in data
2007-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	Madnez		write data
2007-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	write data to an NTFS partition?
2007-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	Madnez		i both hate and love the protection protocols
2007-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	Madnez		yeah. a partition on the same disc
2007-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	that's not a good idea, but if you're prepared to risk it then what you need to do is remount the disk with the read-write option set
2007-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	Madnez		huh? dont need to do that
2007-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	Madnez		theres a command allowing write
2007-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	yes, you do
2007-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	Madnez		ntfs config?
2007-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Madnez	just remount the drive as read-write
