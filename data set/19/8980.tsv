2008-03-19T23:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Itaku	if you post the logs and stop complaining and we can explain them to you -- many people don't really grok what they are reading in logs

2008-03-19T23:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Itaku	then stop complaining - cos you are not correct until you post them
2008-03-19T23:33:00.000Z	Itaku	ompaul	i know about sudo and all of that but im just wondering if theres a way to block "sudo su""
