2011-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	disable ftp, then they can only use ssh
2011-03-02T04:05:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	what's the issue with it
2011-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	then you will need someone with physical access to the server to restart ssh or drop the firewall or what ever is blocking you
2011-03-02T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	then you won't be able to make any chances or debug ig
2011-03-02T04:08:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	what did you change to break it ?
2011-03-02T04:09:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	no, what did you do to change it
2011-03-02T04:10:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	why are you looking at the vsftpd config file, that has nothing to do with ssh
2011-03-02T04:11:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	forget ftp - fix your ssh problem
2011-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	has it ever worked ?

2011-03-02T04:13:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	ok, what did you change to break it ?
2011-03-02T04:14:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	it will be in your systems home directory under .bash_history
2011-03-02T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	then you can't tell your shell history
2011-03-02T04:17:00.000Z	ikonia	aazert	no, it needs the filel I said that you have said is not there
