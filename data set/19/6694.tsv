2009-04-07T17:56:00.000Z	sarmisak	gentubuntu	it should print running processes with the name 'dpkg'
2009-04-07T17:58:00.000Z	sarmisak	gentubuntu	maybe you are not root? are you trying to install like this right; sudo apt-get install ...
2009-04-07T18:00:00.000Z	sarmisak	gentubuntu	how did you delete it?
2009-04-07T18:01:00.000Z	sarmisak	gentubuntu	ok, have you tried this; sudo apt-get install -f
2009-04-07T18:02:00.000Z	sarmisak	gentubuntu	I don't think so, but there is a problem for sure
2009-04-07T18:04:00.000Z	sarmisak	gentubuntu	have you tried this; sudo rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/lock
