2008-11-01T06:59:00.000Z	KMan		i've restarted the comp at least 10 times
2008-11-01T07:00:00.000Z	KMan		_phil:ok...while it starts up, it goes 2 running local boot scripts nd it jus freezes
2008-11-01T07:00:00.000Z	_2	KMan	this is not M$ and contrarry to popular belief "reboot will fix anything" is just simply not true.
2008-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	_2	KMan	do you want to "fix" your startup issue ?
2008-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	KMan	_2	yes!
2008-11-01T07:04:00.000Z	_2	KMan	what is the last message you see when it hangs ?
2008-11-01T07:05:00.000Z	_2	KMan	ok, do you have any idea what is in /etc/rc.local ?
2008-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	_2	KMan	ok boot with kernel line option  "init=/bin/bash"  issue these command.   mount -no remount,rw / ;mv /etc/rc.local . ;mount -no remount,ro /
2008-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	_2	KMan	then reboot.
2008-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	_2	KMan	you have to hit [esc] at the grub menu.  select the boot option you want, hit [e] for edit that otpion, select the kernel line and hit [e] for edit that line,  and type in    init=/bin/bash     then hit [enter] and hit [b]
2008-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	_2	KMan	  ^
2008-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	_2	KMan	it is possable that it's not you rc.local that is hanging you out to dry.  but if it is, as it does appear to be, those instructions will circumvent the error.
2008-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	KMan	_2	i did the kernel thing
2008-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	_2	KMan	what do you mean not working ?
2008-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	_2	KMan	^
2008-11-01T07:14:00.000Z	_2	KMan	seems to be gone....
