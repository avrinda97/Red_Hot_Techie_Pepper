2006-01-03T08:06:00.000Z	maskd		im so happy, the version of vlc with dapper is much better than the one included with breezy
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	funny, it wasn't installing at all yesterday.
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	really?
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	down to dbus transition, yes. I should take a look into it actually.
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	maskd		vlc 0.8.4?
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	yup
2006-01-03T08:08:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	it installed without a hitch for me
2006-01-03T08:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	hm, vlc there seems to depend on libdbus-1-1 (but >0.5) for some reason
2006-01-03T08:12:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	does it work if you apt-get it?
2006-01-03T08:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	nope, depends on a much later version of libdbus-1-1
2006-01-03T08:12:00.000Z	maskd		woah, for some reason i have a lot of cdroms in my /media/ folder
2006-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	pretty strange then why mine worked, i've pretty much only let it auto update to the latest of everything
2006-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	and fresh installed with dapper flight 2 iso
2006-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	what version of libdbus-1-1 do you have?
2006-01-03T08:14:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	how do i check?
2006-01-03T08:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	ah, that's why. You're running on a different dapper then -- I presumed you were on today's
2006-01-03T08:15:00.000Z	maskd	apokryphos	do you have any idea on how to fix the prob?
2006-01-03T08:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	maskd	yup, it's not a problem to get around. Just was curious that it was smooth for you (but we're running different dapper).
