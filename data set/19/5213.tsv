2010-10-31T00:31:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 nvm. i'm trying to take it off a xubuntu system. guess i'm in the wrong channel
2010-10-31T00:32:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	well I don't know if that tool exists there, but try to run seahorse there
2010-10-31T00:46:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 well i have seahorse up and running now. what should i do?
2010-10-31T00:47:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	on the first page (passwords) there is a "folder" passwords:login
2010-10-31T00:47:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 ok got it
2010-10-31T00:47:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	right click on that, select "change password"
2010-10-31T00:48:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 ok ...
2010-10-31T00:49:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	enter your system password in the 1st field, let the other two empty, select ok, you get a warning, read it, confirm what you want to do
2010-10-31T00:50:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 thanks a million
2010-10-31T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	you're welcome :-) but keep in mind that in that folder may be more sensible data than just the wlan key, have a look what is actually stored there...
2010-10-31T00:51:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 this is not my main system. it's just a media centre PC that will be accessing files from my network
2010-10-31T00:52:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	thats ok with me, just have a look please
2010-10-31T00:53:00.000Z	evon	guntbert	 will do thanks
2010-10-31T00:53:00.000Z	guntbert	evon	no problem :) have fun!
