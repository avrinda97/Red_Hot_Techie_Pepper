2012-04-27T01:32:00.000Z	upset		I checked the iso before and after I wrote it to usb. The disk check error I have says there's a bad checksum for ./install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/i386/pxelinux.cfg/default    What can I do?
2012-04-27T01:33:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	redownload :-D
2012-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	what integrity check?
2012-04-27T01:36:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	The one on alternative iso.
2012-04-27T01:38:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	It's the only thing complaining. It says the ./install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/i386/pxelinux.cfg/default md5 checksum is bad, but everything else says it is corrected and I've exhausted most methods of writing and checking.
2012-04-27T01:41:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	Still there dude?
2012-04-27T01:41:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	 maybe there is somthing wrong with ur burner
2012-04-27T01:41:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	I don't have a burner.
2012-04-27T01:41:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	USB is my method
2012-04-27T01:42:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	can it install ubuntu without check it?
2012-04-27T01:42:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	Yeah, but that sounds like a really bad idea.
2012-04-27T01:43:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	I don't really think I can ignore a bad checksum on something in the ubuntu-installer folder.
2012-04-27T01:43:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	but the iso check md5 is same?
2012-04-27T01:44:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	It doesn't tell me what the bad value is. It just says it's wrong. Everything else gives me 'okay' or the correct overall checksum
2012-04-27T01:45:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	maybe u shld try it redownload again, dont rest ur pc during the download for safety
2012-04-27T01:45:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	I have done that ALL DAY
2012-04-27T01:47:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	yeah i know that it kind upset me too to hear that
2012-04-27T01:47:00.000Z	upset	Bennlucky7	What are you referring to?
2012-04-27T01:49:00.000Z	Bennlucky7	upset	i once install it from LinuxLive USB Creator
