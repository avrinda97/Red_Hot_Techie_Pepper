2010-05-20T03:29:00.000Z	K-19	bp0	: what man?
2010-05-20T03:30:00.000Z	bp0	K-19	in windows firefox, and most apps, the middle button enters a mode where moving the mouse scrolls the windows in any direction
2010-05-20T03:31:00.000Z	bp0		how can i set that up in linux?
2010-05-20T03:31:00.000Z	K-19	bp0	: Here also you can do the same things ; nothing different in scrolling activity.
2010-05-20T03:32:00.000Z	bp0	K-19	yes, in linux the middle button means paste url and go in firefox
2010-05-20T03:32:00.000Z	bp0		i would rather have the ability to scroll
2010-05-20T03:34:00.000Z	K-19	bp0	: Mouse (Hardware) !!!
2010-05-20T03:34:00.000Z	bp0		K-19? what? it is a generic scrollwheel mouse
2010-05-20T03:34:00.000Z	bp0		nothing special
2010-05-20T03:36:00.000Z	K-19	bp0	: System-Preferences-mouse
2010-05-20T03:38:00.000Z	bp0	K-19	... ok what option?
2010-05-20T03:41:00.000Z	bp0		K-19?
2010-05-20T03:41:00.000Z	K-19	bp0	: usually peripheral devices are auto configured..there not much can be done about it.
2010-05-20T03:41:00.000Z	bp0		the mouse is working fine... I just want the middle-button behaviour from windows
2010-05-20T03:41:00.000Z	bp0		for scrolling in any direction
2010-05-20T03:41:00.000Z	bp0		how do i set that?
2010-05-20T03:42:00.000Z	K-19	bp0	: If i were you; could have gone hunting for a new mouse.
2010-05-20T03:45:00.000Z	bp0	K-19	the mouse is fine... I don't need a new mouse... I want the behaviour from windows for using the middle button to enter a scroll-by-moving-the-mouse mode...
