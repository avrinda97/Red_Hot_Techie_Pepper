2007-03-10T09:50:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin		hehe, sorry, that makes sense
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin		I just installed 6.10 server.  But, I can't boot into it.  When I turn the machine on, I get a flashing cursor after the BIOS is done initializing itself
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin		Does anyone know whats goin on?
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	^^ please try turning off some of the daemons, and have a look maybe at installing rcconf
2007-03-10T09:54:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin	ompaul	I can't access the operating system at all..it won't boot
2007-03-10T09:55:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	well if you can't pass options I suggest a reinstall
2007-03-10T09:55:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin	ompaul	I tried that already.  The only strange thing is that I couldn't configure my networking options...otherwise both installs have gone very smoothly
2007-03-10T09:56:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	so how new is the hardware?
2007-03-10T09:56:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin	ompaul	two weeks.  Its got Win2k running on it, though, so all of it works properly
2007-03-10T09:57:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	then I have to question your install CD
2007-03-10T09:57:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	do an md5sum on the image before you use the CD again
2007-03-10T09:58:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin	ompaul	I verified it before I booted it.  You know, its not even getting to a GRUB menu....could the problem be with GRUB?
2007-03-10T09:59:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	if it is not installed then I wonder about the Disk being okay
2007-03-10T10:00:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	so here is what I suggest burn another disk - I have installed ubuntu server and desktop on a huge amount of boxes recently
2007-03-10T10:00:00.000Z	ompaul		!paste | incorperated
2007-03-10T10:01:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin	ompaul	thanks...I'll try burning it again.  The md5 for the ISO is correct
2007-03-10T10:02:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	try the desktop install it might show some other information
2007-03-10T10:02:00.000Z	ompaul	tings_b_buggin	if it works then there was a problem with the disk
2007-03-10T10:05:00.000Z	tings_b_buggin	ompaul	tnanks...I'll try that
