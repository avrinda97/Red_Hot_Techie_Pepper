2009-10-26T23:26:00.000Z	kaptainkranium		Hey guys, I'm new to linux, and I'm wondering what to do with .tar's, or .tar.gz's. I'm not familiar with them, from what I understand so far you download them to install programs? Not sure what to do after that
2009-10-26T23:27:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	you usually dont download .tar etc, you use the repositories to download software
2009-10-26T23:28:00.000Z	kaptainkranium	blueglasses	what exactly is a repository, and if there is a .deb, would that be easier to install?
2009-10-26T23:29:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	a repository is a collection of packets for one or more distributions
2009-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	a repository is a a central library for all the software
2009-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	you already have it
2009-10-26T23:31:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	look on system menu
2009-10-26T23:31:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	you have at least 4 or more methods to install software in ubuntu
2009-10-26T23:32:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	ok its Synaptic, but called Synaptic on the System menu
2009-10-26T23:33:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	ok its Synaptic, but NOT called Synaptic on the System menu
2009-10-26T23:36:00.000Z	kaptainkranium	blueglasses	so at this point, using synaptic is the probably the safest way for me to go about installing things. If I want to be able to install apps not available on synaptic, where should I go to learn that?
2009-10-26T23:42:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	when you download a tar.gz, etc, you will almoust allways have a file called "install" inside the tar.gz
2009-10-26T23:43:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	that file is a text file, it will open with a text editor, it will say how to install (with the commands) or you can try the wiki for that app
2009-10-26T23:44:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	but its allways beter to search the site of the apps for a repository, since if you install it from repository, you shall always have the most updated version
2009-10-26T23:45:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	usually you have the "central" ubuntu repositories for supported apps, and the application repository from the site of the app
2009-10-26T23:46:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	you must choose wich version you want installed on your system, i.e.: if for instance you want to use picasa, google has its own repositories
2009-10-26T23:47:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	or you can use the medibuntu repositorys
2009-10-26T23:47:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	or you can use the medibuntu repositories, (sorry for bad english, i'm portuguese)
2009-10-26T23:54:00.000Z	blueglasses	kaptainkranium	so download it and doubleclick it
