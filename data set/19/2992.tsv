2012-09-27T12:23:00.000Z	brophat		when is the next ubuntu version coming out?
2012-09-27T12:24:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/ubuntu-13-04-release-date-announced
2012-09-27T12:24:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	so, April 25th they think, but it may change
2012-09-27T12:25:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	haha, sorry, that was a mistake
2012-09-27T12:25:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	let me get the right article
2012-09-27T12:27:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	More then likely, Libre Office supports all functions of Microsoft Office you are using
2012-09-27T12:27:00.000Z	brophat	JamezQ	nah, I want to learn excel
2012-09-27T12:29:00.000Z	brophat	JamezQ	I heard when you do all that stuff micro office still runs like crap
2012-09-27T12:30:00.000Z	brophat	JamezQ	corpers want to hear you talk macro
2012-09-27T12:30:00.000Z	brophat	JamezQ	corpers want to hear you talkin VB macros
2012-09-27T12:33:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	Yes.
2012-09-27T12:36:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	Because most applications are still written for 32 bit in mind
2012-09-27T12:36:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	No, it's not.
2012-09-27T12:37:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	In fact, I suggest 64, I think they will change that text soon.
2012-09-27T12:37:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	Since they have finished all the muti-arch stuff,
2012-09-27T12:40:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	No, they are pretty much exactly the same. 64 is a big faster and in general applications for it are slightly larger
2012-09-27T12:40:00.000Z	brophat	JamezQ	and 64 bit can use all of my 6 gigs of ram
2012-09-27T12:41:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	32 can actually do that aswell
2012-09-27T12:41:00.000Z	JamezQ	brophat	Using something called a PAE kernel
