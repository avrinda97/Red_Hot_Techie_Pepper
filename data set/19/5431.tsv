2009-01-31T09:38:00.000Z	Shii		is anyone here familiar with 64bit flash?
2009-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	Shii		flash is making my firefox segfault, it makes me very sad
2009-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	technically, nspluginwrapper segfaults :)
2009-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	Shii	WebcamWonder	nah i am using the Adobe alpha
2009-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	Weird, I haven't had any problem what that
2009-01-31T09:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	with*
2009-01-31T09:46:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	memtest perhaps?
2009-01-31T09:46:00.000Z	Shii	WebcamWonder	how do i memtest?
2009-01-31T09:47:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	LiveCD has an option for it
2009-01-31T09:47:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	Just to make things clear, memtest checks your RAM for instability, etc.
2009-01-31T09:48:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	Have you considered switching to nspluginwrapper?
2009-01-31T09:48:00.000Z	Shii	WebcamWonder	i'd love to but the instructions are kind of confusing
2009-01-31T09:49:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	Google for scripts. They take care of everything
2009-01-31T09:52:00.000Z	Shii	WebcamWonder	i ran the nspluginwrapper GetFlash script and now it shows no plugins at all!
2009-01-31T09:52:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	That was fast, what script did you run?
2009-01-31T09:53:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	What?
2009-01-31T10:07:00.000Z	Shii	WebcamWonder	"http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz" is 404
2009-01-31T10:07:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	Get flash player 10 please. 9 is horrible at its best
2009-01-31T10:08:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Shii	Flash player 10 for 32 bit which you can run from nspluginwrapper :)
