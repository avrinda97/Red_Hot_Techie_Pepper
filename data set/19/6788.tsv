2007-12-08T04:07:00.000Z	aBound		I used Wubi before tried it once didn't boot my machine up after a successful install
2007-12-08T04:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	Were you at least still able to boot Windows or did it completely screw up ntldr?
2007-12-08T04:08:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	Wasn't able to boot Windows or Ubuntu
2007-12-08T04:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	You should file a bug if you havn't already, wubi is supposed to be the "safer" way because it does not require repartitioning, that it screwed up ntldr is unacceptable ( and should be easily avoidable )
2007-12-08T04:10:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	they probably fixed it though seeing as I did this a while back like a couple of months back
2007-12-08T04:10:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	also seeing as Wubi is in Beta that's most likely the cause of the issue hehe
2007-12-08T04:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	What exactly happened, did you see a boot menu at all when you started the computer?
2007-12-08T04:12:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	The grub menu came up and I hit enter on Ubuntu then it just went black and stayed there
2007-12-08T04:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	Did you use the wubi from the Ubuntu 7.10 install CD?
2007-12-08T04:13:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	never knew Wubi was on the Ubuntu 7.10 LiveCD/Install CD
2007-12-08T04:13:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	Was on Windows XP Home downloaded Wubi installed it from there rebooted tried to load Ubuntu screen went black
2007-12-08T04:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	It's not really full Wubi, it just let's you boot from the install CD without changing any BIOS settings
2007-12-08T04:14:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	I see
2012-01-15T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	There are 64 bit packages for zsnex in the default Ubuntu repositories.
2012-01-15T13:03:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	In the Software Center it doesn't exist it shows it but than tells me it isn't there.
2012-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	Looks like I was simply mistaken. Sorry.
2012-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	aBound	Jordan_U	No problem man.
2012-03-06T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	I assure you I have already read the channel topic. I'd rather not discuss at length what is offtopic for Ubuntu here, as it would be ironically somewhat offtopic. If you'd like to continue discussing this please join #ubuntu-ops.
2012-03-06T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	aBound	Both I and bazhang are ops in this channel. If you'd like to continue discussing this please join #ubuntu-ops.
