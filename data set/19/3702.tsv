2012-01-24T14:02:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	what are you actually looking for?
2012-01-24T14:06:00.000Z	Gaurang	fidel	help dude
2012-01-24T14:06:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	please talk to the channel - not a single person
2012-01-24T14:07:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	and search for unity alternatives
2012-01-24T14:07:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	in case both: unity & gnome-shell seems to slow for you - take a look on xfce or similar
2012-01-24T14:09:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	there is no general BETTER
2012-01-24T14:09:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	and in case of kde - it will most likely be not really faster - if both unity & gnome-shell are slow on your system
2012-01-24T14:11:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	tell us what is slow first ;)
2012-01-24T14:15:00.000Z	fidel	Gaurang	asking third time now: speed of what?
