2006-12-29T13:54:00.000Z	cens0red		Hi. Can someone help me? I can't get my new dvd drive to work. It's a liteON shm-165P6S . When I try to play DVDs, I get this error "read: Error cracking CSS key"
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	cens0red		Sometimes I get video output, but it's horribly garbled. And there's no audio.
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	that's a problem with libdvdread, not your dvd drive
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	hold on while i do some reading :)
2006-12-29T13:55:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	cheers.
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	have you installed libdvdread3?
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	if so, run /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	yeah  I did all the stuff on the wiki. Still the same problem.
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	otherwise, run apt-get install libdvdread3, then run /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	have you tried a different dvd? what player are you using?
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	are you sure you ran /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh?
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	it's the liteON shm-165P6S .
2006-12-29T13:59:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	I don't have another dvd. :/
2006-12-29T13:59:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	no, what software player are you using?
2006-12-29T13:59:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	like totem, mplayer, vlc?
2006-12-29T13:59:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	yes I'm sure I ran. I ran it again just then. I have tried  totem, mplayer, vlc, and ogle.
2006-12-29T14:02:00.000Z	Pie-rate	cens0red	not sure what else it could be
2006-12-29T14:03:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	well I've been searching all the forums. Heaps of people with the same problem, no solutions.
2006-12-29T14:15:00.000Z	cens0red	Pie-rate	hey I just went out and bought another dvd. It works!!
