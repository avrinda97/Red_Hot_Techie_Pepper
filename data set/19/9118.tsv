2007-08-01T16:16:00.000Z	Orange_Species		Hello everyone. I've got a few questions. I am debating between Ubuntu and Xubuntu. Could someone tell me why Xubuntu is inferior to Ubuntu?
2007-08-01T16:16:00.000Z	Orange_Species		I am a total Linux n00b.
2007-08-01T16:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	its not inferior.
2007-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	Xubuntu runs xfce, which is a much lighter GUI than GNome(Ubuntu)..
2007-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	generally... old, slow PC.. xubuntu.., newer PC, Ubuntu
2007-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	yes
2007-08-01T16:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	this is addressed on Xubuntu's site.
2007-08-01T16:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	if you have a new PC, use whichever one you want
2007-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	they are essentially the same, use whichever one you want.
2007-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	what works on one, works on the other.
2007-08-01T16:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	these are all things you can find with a very brief google search.
2007-08-01T16:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	are you a troll?
2007-08-01T16:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	wel, nobody could possibly be that dense..
2007-08-01T16:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	the only thing thats different, is the GUI, thats it, "under the hood", OS's are all the same
2007-08-01T16:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	only way you learn, is to read
2007-08-01T16:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	every single question you've asked, is answered on each page's download site
2007-08-01T16:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	but there's no reason to flood a support channel, with questions like this, when all the info is on the sites you downloaded the iso's from
2007-08-01T16:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	you can't answer a PM cuz your nick isn't registered
2007-08-01T16:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Orange_Species	the installer has a disk partitioner, you'lll need to set a partition of your disk for Linux(usually at least 10gigs).., that should leave windows untouched if done properly, but backup your data.
