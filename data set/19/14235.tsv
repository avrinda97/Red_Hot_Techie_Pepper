2011-05-23T01:58:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	its the user interface a user of 11.04 sees by default if they have a 3d capable video card
2011-05-23T02:01:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	there is a 2d version in the works
2011-05-23T02:02:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	the classic gnome desktop still exists in 11.04, you dont need to go back 10.10 for that
2011-05-23T02:02:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	there is a 2d version of Unity
2011-05-23T02:02:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	so at least two options in 11.04 even without 3d
2011-05-23T02:02:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	yeah, thats the one
2011-05-23T02:03:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	which model of macbook?
2011-05-23T02:03:00.000Z	popey	adwait_neo	the red led is optical out, you can turn that off
