2008-10-23T10:04:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	General drill is:  check NIC seating, link light, media (cable), configuration (ifconfig;drivers etc), gateway, route, forwarding on gateway, DNS resolution, local (LAN) and remote (forwarded) ping targets.
2008-10-23T10:04:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	Modem or NIC?

2008-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	... just brief.  Was acknowledging you, appreciate your mentioning it.
2008-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	mecha	karsten	i told you i don't understand the question and you responded with "Right."
2008-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	mecha	karsten	maybe you could have just re-phrased the question instead of shunning me
2008-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	Sorry, repeat.  Where were we at?
2008-10-23T10:08:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	Lose the 'tude.  I'm trying to help folks, not intentioanally doing anything, and it's a hell of a busy channel.  Also got my own stuff I'm up to.  What was your question.
2008-10-23T10:09:00.000Z	mecha	karsten	My question is simple. has anyone here gotten OS X to run in virtualbox?
2008-10-23T10:09:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	Probably.
2008-10-23T10:09:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	Google is your friend.
2008-10-23T10:10:00.000Z	mecha	karsten	like i said before, i've tried all the google links and found no useful information so i'm here
2008-10-23T10:10:00.000Z	karsten	mecha	And no, you're not going to browbeat an answer out of me because that's all I know.  HAND.
