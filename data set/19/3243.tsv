2009-09-23T23:56:00.000Z	razor_X		got a question
2009-09-23T23:57:00.000Z	razor_X		ok i have the resolution set to 1026X768 but i have to scroll is there a way to override the monitor detect of 800X600 and zoom out or am i stuck with scrolling on the desktop?
2009-09-23T23:58:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	huh?
2009-09-24T00:01:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	how did you the resolution to 1024x768?
2009-09-24T00:01:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	did you edit the monitor section as well?
2009-09-24T00:02:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	something went wrong
2009-09-24T00:03:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	I understand, had it happen in windows to me a few times when I tried to run higher then the monitor would go
2009-09-24T00:27:00.000Z	razor_X	Halitech	do i need to edit my monitor settings in order to overide the 800X600 default detection?
2009-09-24T00:28:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	I would hazard a guess that you will but I've never fooled around with it so not sure what to suggest for settings
2009-09-24T00:36:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	I doubt it will do much but you could try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg or reboot into single user mode and try the xfix option
2009-09-24T00:39:00.000Z	razor_X	Halitech	no go on the reconfigure
2009-09-25T02:21:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	did you install from the repo or from a download from their site?
2009-09-25T02:21:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	maybe it needs a newer version of java then is in the repo
2009-09-25T02:22:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	from the repo, correct?
2009-09-25T19:29:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	do you get any errors if you try and start it from the terminal?
2009-09-25T19:29:00.000Z	razor_X	Halitech	i will past the error
2009-09-25T19:33:00.000Z	Halitech	razor_X	are both installed from the main ubuntu repos?
2009-09-25T19:33:00.000Z	razor_X	Halitech	 yes
