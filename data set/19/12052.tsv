2006-05-13T14:42:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	what do you actually want to add?
2006-05-13T14:43:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	in the ubuntu+1 channel there are a lot of questions about installing cedega and that the package xlibs does not exist
2006-05-13T14:43:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	i've read a post on the forum about how to solve this
2006-05-13T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	whats the url - if you want me to add it
2006-05-13T14:45:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	wait, i'll search for it
2006-05-13T14:51:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	i found a solution here, in the reply from artificial_intelligence : http://transgaming.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5503
2006-05-13T14:52:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	maybe i can add it to the wiki or something?
2006-05-13T14:57:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	I would not be uncomfortable with it - as a cegeda problem the solution is theirs to make - I'll read it again when I get some work out of the way, but I don't really want to see it in its current form on the wiki or bot - one of the many reasons are that the person suggests being root - not good - I have some work to do I'll be back
2006-05-13T14:59:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	i can't see where he suggest doing things as root. The only thing he does is sudo apt-get install
2006-05-13T14:59:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	sorry, sudo dpkg -i
2006-05-13T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	okay I had input from several streams on that one - the page is too much data there is now a factiod in place
2006-07-01T15:00:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	i was thinking about saying that, but thank you for reading my mind
2006-07-01T15:00:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	tab is my friend ;-) yours too I take it
2006-08-16T08:13:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	he just joined the nl channel
2006-08-16T08:14:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	ahh good
2006-08-16T08:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	and he left it again :p
2006-08-16T08:14:00.000Z	ompaul	KenSentMe	well that works, on some level
2006-08-16T08:15:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ompaul	another satisfied customer
