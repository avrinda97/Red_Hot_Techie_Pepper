2011-05-21T18:37:00.000Z	a7i3n		cool
2011-05-21T18:37:00.000Z	a7i3n		dangerous... but cool
2011-05-21T18:38:00.000Z	a7i3n		ah yes... the important things... like a warm server with a fresh Linux install mmmmm
2011-05-21T18:39:00.000Z	a7i3n		Happy End on the World everybody!
2011-05-21T18:40:00.000Z	a7i3n		Just don't make ubottu mad....
2011-05-21T18:42:00.000Z	a7i3n		Any recomendations for a usb pendrive brand to use for booting ubuntu?
2011-05-21T18:43:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	I use a usb that some folks gave me as a souvenir at a conference, and it works great :)
2011-05-21T18:44:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	as far as booting, i dont think so. Whether the drive itself will last through the years its another story...
2011-05-21T18:47:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	lol, i seriously wonder if the toaster actually has a microprocessor
2011-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	hmmm... you have to figure out if it has something like a PIC or an AVR
2011-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	if it does, then you have to adapt the kernel code to compile on that architecture, which is not an easy task
2011-05-21T18:54:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	however, most PICs i have worked with go as fast as 20mhz... It would be easier to establish a serial connection to your toaster
2011-05-21T18:55:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	lol
2011-05-21T18:56:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	you could also get one of those small linux tiny computers and use a PIC micro to interface with the toaster I/O
2011-05-21T18:56:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	that would be a lot easier
2011-05-21T18:57:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	no problem :)
2011-05-21T18:58:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	arduino might do it, but i dont think they run linux
2011-05-21T19:00:00.000Z	submain	a7i3n	you may use the serial module of arduino to comunicate with linux; technically you will have a toaster that runs linux...
