2010-08-31T22:07:00.000Z	abys		hi , when i have a ssh client running , is it possible to connect for somebody to connect to my pc then ?
2010-08-31T22:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	connect to yourself from ssh yes
2012-06-20T13:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	maybe you can't mount from a partition that's already mounted?
2012-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	: what do you mean? is this partition mount in the background and you can't access it through the folders?
2012-06-20T13:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	it wouldn't boot if it didn't already mount
2012-06-20T13:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	am I wrong I think you see it at root /
2012-06-20T13:43:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	I don't think so because when I try to install stuff on the system, I'm running out of space, even If I created a bigger casper partition
2012-06-20T13:45:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	That's the reason why I want to use casper partition. But when I click on it i've got:  could not find /cow, please check the spelling and try again
2012-06-20T13:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	running out of mem space?  as I think it creates a ramdisk and puts casper stuf in that
2012-06-20T13:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	I must be wrong then,  I haven't played with it in too long
2012-06-20T13:46:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	I think the system is locked in a separated partition with fat32 limitation
2012-06-20T13:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	well they make dvd install iso and they must be the same format and can be like 4gig
2012-06-20T13:48:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	yes, but iso is not fat32
2012-06-20T13:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	you playing with the squashfs file?
2012-06-20T13:49:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	nop. The casper partition is just an ext2 partition created in the usb stick
2012-06-20T13:50:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	: I've created it with gparted and is empty, so there is no system in it.
2012-06-20T13:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	if your not playing with the squashfs file yet then you need to read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
2012-06-20T13:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	abys	most of the stuf that's in your live cd are in that squashfs
2012-06-20T13:52:00.000Z	abys	sacarlson	cool, looks interesting
