2006-05-15T14:13:00.000Z	rando1		evening all :)
2006-05-15T14:14:00.000Z	rando1		can someone please advise me how i can safely resize my partitons on a working ubuntu dapper install, without killing the existing install? i need to recover more space from my ntfs partitions
2006-05-15T14:15:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	dapper questions are in #ubuntu+1
2006-05-15T14:15:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	ta, but i think the same principal applies to breezy and hoary?
2006-05-15T14:15:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	are you installing from the live cd?
2006-05-15T14:16:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	i have had a working install for a long time and dont want to wreck it; i need more /home and / space and also a larger swap as i have installed more ram
2006-05-15T14:16:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	boot off the live cd and run gparted, it can resize partitions
2006-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	safely, without destroying data?
2006-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	yes
2006-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	you should always backup before doing a resize
2006-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	thanks for that- much appriecated
2006-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	but it should be safe
2006-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	hi again, sorry to bother you- is there any reason why i cant use gparted from within X on my install, rather than a live cd?
2006-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	its only that ive run out of cd's!
2006-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	are you installing from the live cd?
2006-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	no, i am already installed
2006-05-15T14:25:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	you can't resize a partition that is mounted
2006-05-15T14:25:00.000Z	rando1	NoUse	i thought as much :) thanks for clarifying
2006-05-15T14:25:00.000Z	NoUse	rando1	so if you can unmount the partition you want to resie, then its fine
