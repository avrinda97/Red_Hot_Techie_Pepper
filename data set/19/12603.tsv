2005-08-05T15:04:00.000Z	Steph	Xyc0	im just wondering
2005-08-05T15:05:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	it is, but you still lost what ever files were on the drive partition b4 you installed
2005-08-05T15:05:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	yea, then you format over and use your WinXP disk to fixmbr
2005-08-05T15:06:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	Google around to see how to fix your mbr through windows
2005-08-05T15:06:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	but try linux, youd be surprised how much easier it is then windows
2005-08-05T15:06:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	less then 2 gig
2005-08-05T15:07:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	give 10 gig to ubuntu
2005-08-05T15:07:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	then you have room to install everything youd want
2005-08-05T15:08:00.000Z	Steph	Xyc0	can i use my WLAN card on ubuntu
2005-08-05T15:08:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	what kind is it
2005-08-05T15:08:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	I can use mine, but it depends on the make/model

2005-08-05T15:11:00.000Z	Steph	Xyc0	what do i install
2005-08-05T15:11:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	first you need to findout exactly what wifi card you have
2005-08-05T15:12:00.000Z	Xyc0	Steph	you also need to set up your router to use wep, cause WPA is really hard to setup
