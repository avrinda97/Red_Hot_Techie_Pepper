2007-03-27T06:31:00.000Z	Oswy	LjL	Thanks.
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	Oswy	look also at smartmontools if you want to check the *physical* disk (i.e. you think it might be broken or going to break)
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	Oswy		Haha.
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	Oswy		Hmm, OK.
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	Oswy		I think it might have been corrupted when I ran ntfs-3g.
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	Oswy		I got the stable version; is that still a possibility?
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	Oswy	what, you *Ubuntu* ext3 filesystem, or the NTFS filesystem?
2007-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	LjL		check the NTFS filesystem from Windows
2007-03-27T06:33:00.000Z	Oswy		The NTFS.
2007-03-27T06:33:00.000Z	LjL	Oswy	then check it from Windows
2007-03-27T06:33:00.000Z	Oswy		I don't exactly have a dual boot now.
2007-03-27T06:33:00.000Z	Oswy		Argh, dammit.
2007-03-27T06:33:00.000Z	Oswy		Right.
2007-03-27T06:33:00.000Z	LjL	Oswy	then you're out of luck. Linux can barely (and dangerously, as you've seen) *write* to NTFS, it really cannot *fix* it if it's broken
2007-03-27T06:34:00.000Z	Oswy		Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.
2007-03-27T06:34:00.000Z	LjL	Oswy	why are you using NTFS if you're not dual booting anyway? just convert
