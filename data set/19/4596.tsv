2008-12-09T08:27:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		does ubuntu work well if i want to get desktop and use big screen tv for monitor using hdmi
2008-12-09T08:28:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		anyone use hdmi in linux
2008-12-09T08:28:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		its seems cheaper in long run to make big screen tv monitor
2008-12-09T08:29:00.000Z	Songwind	sabayonweb_68615	The resolution is much more limited.
2008-12-09T08:29:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		like how limited
2008-12-09T08:29:00.000Z	Songwind	sabayonweb_68615	The best TV resolution is 1900-something by 1080.
2008-12-09T08:29:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		i use computer to watch 98% of video
2008-12-09T08:30:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		and would get desktop with tv turner
2008-12-09T08:30:00.000Z	Songwind		My 24" widscreen LCD is already running at 1680x1050
2008-12-09T08:30:00.000Z	Songwind		So it would be the same effective screen real estate (or a bit more) on my 52" TV
2008-12-09T08:30:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615	Songwind	yeah i might get a 24" do tv turners work well?
2008-12-09T08:31:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		i was thinking of using mythtv
2008-12-09T08:31:00.000Z	Songwind	sabayonweb_68615	My experience has been that my nVidia cards work well, my Intel card has never quite worked right, and I haven't tried my ATI yet.
2008-12-09T08:31:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615	Songwind	what brand computer you get
2008-12-09T08:31:00.000Z	Songwind	sabayonweb_68615	Nevermind, I am thinking backwards.  TV-out, not TV-in.
2008-12-09T08:32:00.000Z	Songwind	sabayonweb_68615	Toshiba laptop has the Intel chipset.  The others are BYOPC.  Oh, and good TV out from nVidia on an HP laptop.
2008-12-09T08:33:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615	Songwind	so this would be cool? http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/productDetail.do?oid=204447
2008-12-09T08:33:00.000Z	sabayonweb_68615		thats what i could get in the dell package i want
2008-12-09T08:35:00.000Z	Songwind	sabayonweb_68615	TV tuners are outside by experience - but I know Hauppage makes some supported devices.
