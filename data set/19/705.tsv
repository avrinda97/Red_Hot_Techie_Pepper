2011-10-09T09:53:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	I've actually come to like Unity. Took a bit, but it's kind of nice.
2011-10-09T09:55:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	Well, it's pretty much replaced Gnome-Do for me. I very very very rarely actually click anything if I can avoid it
2011-10-09T09:55:00.000Z	virtuelv	JoeDulin	I never used Gnome-Do, because it was a toy
2011-10-09T09:57:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	Have you given 11.10 a try? I don't know if it would be any better
2011-10-09T09:58:00.000Z	virtuelv	JoeDulin	this _is_ 11.10
2011-10-09T09:58:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	My bad... :-P
2011-10-09T09:59:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	can you not install it? or maybe go with something like lxde and customize?
2011-10-09T10:01:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	that is one thing i miss about gnome-do. i liked being able to launch apps and run commands from the same box
2011-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	I still do most of my installing with apt-get. Software center usually just for searching for something I don't know of yet
2011-10-09T10:05:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	I'm sure someone will quickly build a gnome 2/3 package that gets you to a more traditional desktop
2011-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	I don't really know of any full fledged desktop environments other than those. But there are a ton of window managers
2011-10-09T10:17:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	You could try customizing an environment. LXDE is pretty easy
2011-10-09T10:17:00.000Z	virtuelv	JoeDulin	I like LXDE, but last time I tried, it didn't work too well with my regular plugging and unplugging of external monitors
2011-10-09T10:18:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	That makes sense. A lot. They're still a little behind
2011-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	It probably wouldn't be too terribly hard to replace unity with gnome. From what I understand Unity is actually just kind of sitting on top of gnome. I think. Not really sure
2011-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	virtuelv	JoeDulin	Yes, and for 11.04 that was sort of valid, because it was Gnome 2
2011-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	Have you given Linux Mint a try? I haven't heard much out of them recently, but if they're still around you might really like it
2011-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	They're built on Ubuntu last I knew, but use their own panels and stuff. You might hate it, you might love it.
2011-10-09T10:32:00.000Z	JoeDulin	virtuelv	good luck with that
