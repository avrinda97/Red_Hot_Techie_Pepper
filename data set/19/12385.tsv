2005-09-17T09:54:00.000Z	pitti	pl_ice	Ubuntu's kernels get security updates to 2.6.10, Hoary will not get a new upstream version
2005-09-17T09:55:00.000Z	pl_ice	pitti	, so do i wait for the new ubuntu release?...not sure
2005-09-17T09:55:00.000Z	pitti	pl_ice	I don't know either whether you wait :-)
2005-09-17T09:56:00.000Z	pitti	pl_ice	the Warty and Hoary kernels will continue to get security updates, but of course no new features
