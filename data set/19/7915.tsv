2009-05-29T07:14:00.000Z	seth		Hey, does anyone have any idea why when I burn a CD in Ubuntu, it won't play in my car. However, when I burn the same CD on a windows computer, it'll play fine?
2009-05-29T07:15:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	you're not converting the mp3's to wav
2009-05-29T07:16:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	kubuntu-restricted-extras and ubuntu-restricted-extras are the packages you may need
2009-05-29T07:17:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	Do I get those through synaptic?
2009-05-29T07:17:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	yes
2009-05-29T07:17:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	What do I do once I get those?
2009-05-29T07:18:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	when trying to burn the mp3s you'll notice it will convert the mp3s to wav then it'll burn the cd.
2009-05-29T07:19:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	Is this for k3b after I download the restricted packages?
2009-05-29T07:19:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	the kubuntu package is and ubuntu package is for brasero
2009-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	So once I download those, I should just use Brasero?
2009-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	you could use either one. it is a choice of preference.
2009-05-29T07:21:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	Oh. Ok. Well, I haven't had any luck trying to use k3b. So I'll give Brasero a try
2009-05-29T07:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	after you get those two packages installed goto k3b and the preferences>configure k3b> plugins .. see if all those are installed.
2009-05-29T07:22:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	Oh. Ok. So I do need to install Kubuntu too, even though I'm using Ubuntu?
2009-05-29T07:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	no
2009-05-29T07:23:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	Sorry. I'm struggling tonight. I feel bad that I'm struggling so badly.
2009-05-29T07:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	seth	you can use any program that kubuntu has in ubuntu.. no worries. everyone has to learn at some point :)
2009-05-29T07:24:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	Oh, alright. Yeah, I appreciate you sticking with me :). I have the configuration thing. What should I be looking for in the list?
2009-05-29T07:25:00.000Z	seth	bastid_raZor	I have the k3b external audio encoder. That seems like it'd be the right thing
