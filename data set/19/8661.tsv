2007-06-14T12:00:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	there is no r500 support in the radeon dirver
2007-06-14T12:00:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	okay, then ati
2007-06-14T12:00:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	ati = radeon
2007-06-14T12:00:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	there is no difference at all?
2007-10-21T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	envy is the breaking element
2007-10-21T09:48:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	yes I know :)
2007-10-21T09:48:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	I hate it more than I hate automatix
2007-10-21T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	;)
2007-11-25T00:48:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	some people with laptops have switches between intel and nvidia video (for battery life vs. performance), and other people want to use xinerama across two cards
2007-11-25T00:48:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	yes, he did explain his intentions
2008-01-21T06:53:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	in his case, he does
2008-01-21T06:53:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	no he doesn't :) he's not using fglrx, trust me
2008-01-21T06:54:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	he said he was
2008-01-21T06:54:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	he's mistaken, fglrx supports the 9500 and up
2008-01-21T06:55:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	ah
2008-01-21T06:55:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	well, compiz-fusions slows his machine down to its knees
2008-12-28T11:23:00.000Z	crdlb	tritium	technically, I think ubuntu imports from unstable, not that they're all that different most of the time
2008-12-28T11:25:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	you are correct
2009-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	tritium	crdlb	you were right
