2007-04-07T12:40:00.000Z	G^Deka		I have a gdm login problem, when i login it shows a shell then gdm pops up again, any ideas ????
2007-04-07T12:41:00.000Z	G^Deka	NBrepresent	sure thing, its still not all smooth, windows wont boot, but at least i fixed my partition table, it thought my NTFS was FAT16, thank god for xtknight
2007-04-07T12:41:00.000Z	NBrepresent	G^Deka	what's xtknight?
2007-04-07T12:43:00.000Z	G^Deka	NBrepresent	a user on here
2007-04-07T12:43:00.000Z	NBrepresent	G^Deka	can you give me a hand with my partition table then?
2007-04-07T12:43:00.000Z	NBrepresent		i already know how to right click and resize, i guess it's the mounting and boot flags and stuff that i don't know.
2007-04-07T12:44:00.000Z	NBrepresent		also, does it matter what order the partitions are in?
2007-04-07T12:44:00.000Z	G^Deka	NBrepresent	sure, what is the exact issue
2007-04-07T12:44:00.000Z	G^Deka		I have a gdm login problem, when i login it shows a shell then gdm pops up again, any ideas ???? Please, i need at least 1 working OS
2007-04-07T12:45:00.000Z	NBrepresent	G^Deka	i'm not sure i have an exact issue. i just need a few questions answered along the way.
2007-04-07T12:45:00.000Z	NBrepresent		like, does it matter what order the partitions are in?
2007-04-07T12:45:00.000Z	NBrepresent		and since i'm on a dell, with extra hidden partitions, will they screw stuff up? can i remove them, or ignore them?
2007-04-07T12:45:00.000Z	G^Deka	NBrepresent	any order, i usually leave my windows as the first, for most people it seems to be hda1
2007-04-07T12:46:00.000Z	G^Deka	NBrepresent	i would leave them if i was you
2007-04-07T12:46:00.000Z	NBrepresent	G^Deka	ok, will do. now how do i MOVE a partition? i can only get the resize dialog.
2007-04-07T12:47:00.000Z	G^Deka	NBrepresent	difficult in gparted, is it really nessasry they get moved
