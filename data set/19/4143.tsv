2009-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	duxbarak	tokeefe	i think i got it to work before on my 64-bit by using their generic linux package instead of the prebuilt .deb
2009-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	duxbarak	tokeefe	it's on their linux download page, i think it just says generic, or tar.gz, or something like that
2009-03-18T07:12:00.000Z	duxbarak	tokeefe	it was either the static or dynamic package, try one of those
2009-03-18T07:13:00.000Z	tokeefe		im on 64-bit
2009-03-18T07:13:00.000Z	tokeefe		tried installing it and it stopped me cuz i was on 64-bit
2009-03-18T07:13:00.000Z	tokeefe		got medibuntu one running
2009-03-18T07:14:00.000Z	tokeefe		but when i try to call I get a "Problem with Audio PLayback"
2009-03-18T07:14:00.000Z	tokeefe		forget video... i can't even get audio workin
2009-03-18T07:14:00.000Z	tokeefe		:-/
2009-03-18T07:15:00.000Z	duxbarak	tokeefe	the dynamic (or static) package, instead of the ubuntu package just unzips and contains the files, which you have to install manually, but it works, i just did it again to check
2009-03-18T07:18:00.000Z	tokeefe		still getting some "Problem with Audio Playback"
2009-03-18T07:19:00.000Z	tokeefe	duxbarak	got the dynamic package... still a problem w/ audio playback
