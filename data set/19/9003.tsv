2007-01-07T13:19:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		you can add something to fstab or something and it will show up there
2007-01-07T13:20:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		k
2007-01-07T13:21:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		ace_noone, what instructions did you follow?
2007-01-07T13:21:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		you shouldn't have altered the boot whatsoever
2007-01-07T13:21:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		the best guide to use is the beryl official one
2007-01-07T13:22:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		haha
2007-01-07T13:23:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		well then probably you should change your xorg.conf back to how it was so you can use your mouse
2007-01-07T13:24:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		alright, i've got an idea, lockdown
2007-01-07T13:25:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		n2diy-- it cycles through you different X sessions
2007-01-07T13:25:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks		hes trolling, and has been for a while now
2007-01-07T13:25:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	so  it cycles through the xorg.conf settings?
2007-01-07T13:26:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	Hello, can't we test our resolution settings that way?
2007-01-07T14:11:00.000Z	kiwinz_sucks	n2diy	i think that's how TOR plays...he doesn't connect to a real server
2007-01-07T14:12:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	ok, I'm lost, so good luck to you guys.
2007-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	and stay on the LOW side of the H. sync rate.
2007-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	I meant V. sync rate.
2007-01-07T14:16:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	yep, drive the V. sync rate to hard/fast, and poof, you'll let the magic smoke out of something.
2007-01-07T14:19:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	spend an afternoon googling monitor repair, it is enlightening.
2007-01-07T14:20:00.000Z	n2diy	kiwinz_sucks	and that is why you hang out here, no/
