2008-06-18T18:05:00.000Z	masterkiller		is the edgy repository not working?
2008-06-18T18:05:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	Edgy is obsolete.
2008-06-18T18:06:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	It was removed from archive.ubuntu.com some time ago. There are no security updates any more, so anybody using it really needs to upgrade.
2008-06-18T18:08:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	thanks for the response :) i have a pretty modified beryl desktop going, do you think the upgrade will break it?
2008-06-18T18:08:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	or rather, what can i do to prepare for it to boot to a normal gnome desktop (doesnt matter if it breaks i can fix just dont want ot get locked out and dead in the water)
2008-06-18T18:08:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	Beryl is horribly obsolete, but you can easily replace it with Compiz Fusion.
2008-06-18T18:09:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	Beryl is close enough to a normal GNOME desktop that it doesn't matter.
2008-06-18T18:09:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	hehe yea i guess its becoming obvious i set this up a long time ago =P
2008-06-18T18:09:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	ok thanks i'll embark on the upgrade adventure :)
2008-06-18T18:11:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	long ago i was often warned about upgrading major ubuntu versions, has that changed?
2008-06-18T18:11:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	People who warn about that have probably done stupid things with their systems.
2008-06-18T18:11:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	Like using dodgy third-party repositoriers.
2008-06-18T18:12:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	haha ok, so no pitfalls I should look out for? (sorry last question)
2008-06-18T18:12:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	Probably not.
2008-06-18T18:12:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	then hell i'll upgrade all my servers =P thanks bud have a good one
2008-06-18T18:12:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	One can go directly from Dapper to Hardy, but not from Edgy to Hardy.
2008-06-18T18:19:00.000Z	masterkiller	wgrant	i keep getting an error when upgrading using the gui. It is failing to find the edgy packages even though I'm trying to upgrade? ive turned off all 3rd party repositories =/
2008-06-18T18:19:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	Oh, you used third-party repositories at all? This is bad.
2008-06-18T18:19:00.000Z	wgrant	masterkiller	There were some particularly bad ones back then.
