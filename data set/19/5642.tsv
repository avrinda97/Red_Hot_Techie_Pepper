2008-08-18T21:22:00.000Z	Bodsda	threedee	call microsoft, they will care
2008-08-18T21:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	threedee	try this, copy a track onto the desktop, then open totem and try to play it
2008-08-18T21:28:00.000Z	Bodsda	threedee	checklist - :1.) does the cd drive work? 2) is the cd clean and non-scratched? 3.) is there music on it? 4.) what did you do to break it?
