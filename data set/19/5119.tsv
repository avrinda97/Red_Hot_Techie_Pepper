2008-08-30T20:37:00.000Z	amenado		Threethan-> can you describe again your network layout?  things went scrolling fast,
2008-08-30T20:38:00.000Z	amenado		Leefmc-> whats a zampp?
2008-08-30T20:39:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	Err... It goes from the DSL line to the modem to the router, to my computer (wired) my sister's computer (wired) and my wife's computer (wireless)
2008-08-30T20:40:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	How would I find out if it has a dmz option or if it allows nat and forwarding?
2008-08-30T20:41:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	I'm looking at that right now. I just don't know where in the manual it'd be. Under what topic.
2008-08-30T20:42:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	four ports.
2008-08-30T20:43:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	It has a dmz ip address configuration option. So, I assume it does have a dmz option.
2008-08-30T20:44:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	Yes, the windows host can access it. The ubuntu host, which is the same computer (dual booting) cannot.
2008-08-30T20:45:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	And, yes, it does allow forwarding.
2008-08-30T20:46:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	Tried that, it's going too fast for me to review it. ifconfig | more is the same way.
2008-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	Threethan	amenado	Everytime, it goes too fast for me to look at it. I try the pause|break key, but that doesn't help either.
