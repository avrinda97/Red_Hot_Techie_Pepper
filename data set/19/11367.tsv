2006-05-16T16:15:00.000Z	liquidindian		Where can I adjust my desktop to 16-bit color?
2006-05-16T16:16:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	edit the DefaultDepth option in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-05-16T16:16:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	okay :)
2006-05-16T16:21:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	tsk, it already is that.  Guess my laptop is just too rubbish to run it.  Pity, it worked fine in windows.
2006-05-16T16:22:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	have you set the maximum X resolution to the native resolution of your display?
2006-05-16T16:22:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	I'm not sure...
2006-05-16T16:22:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	what video driver are you using?
2006-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	how do I find that out?
2006-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	wacom?  Savage?
2006-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	do you know what video chipset your laptop uses?
2006-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	sorry, it's obvious
2006-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	I'll dive into the depths of history... "integrated Via ProSavage KN133 graphics chip with 16MB of SDRAM", if that makes sense.
2006-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	savage is supported fairly well
2006-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	try the wiki:
2006-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	obvious?
2006-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	you had savage in the grep Driver output.
2006-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	liquidindian	soundray	ahh.  I'm still learning.  I don't know much yet.
2006-05-16T16:28:00.000Z	soundray	liquidindian	1024x768 with 16 bpp should be no problem with your setup. Probably even 24bpp.
