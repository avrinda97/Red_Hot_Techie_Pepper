2010-09-05T02:24:00.000Z	JPeterson		I have mounted a dir to a share that is gone, and the timeout is so long that I can't unmount it
2010-09-05T02:24:00.000Z	JPeterson		I think even the unmount times out because the ip is gone
2010-09-05T02:24:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	umount has a -f flag :)
2010-09-05T02:25:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	using -f "sudo umount -f -t cifs /home/user/Network/M"
2010-09-05T02:26:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	how about -l ?
2010-09-05T02:27:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	"//192.168.0.100/N on /home/user/Network/N type cifs (rw,mand)" in the end
2010-09-05T02:28:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	you did mount -l, you need umount -l
2010-09-05T02:29:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	thanks
2011-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	anything with bluez in the name is for bluetooth
2011-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	the unattended-upgrades service surprisingly comes from the unattended-upgrades package :)
2011-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	thanks
2011-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	what about the "x11-common" service
2011-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	unless you don't want a GUI you should keep it :)
2011-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	it can go
2011-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	but what is the package that installs the x11-common service? I tried apt-get remove --purge x11-common*
2011-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	you can remove everything with x11 in the name x11 is the gui
2011-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	ok, how do I halt a apt-get that I started by mistake?
2012-07-25T21:23:00.000Z	Seveas	JPeterson	remove the swap line from /etc/fstab
2012-07-25T21:23:00.000Z	JPeterson	Seveas	thx
