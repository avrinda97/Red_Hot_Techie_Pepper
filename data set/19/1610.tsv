2011-03-12T09:27:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	Go read a guide on setting up an MTA like sendmail, postfix, exim, etc
2011-03-12T09:28:00.000Z	skullboy	[TK]D-Fender	can u send the link
2011-03-12T09:28:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	www.google.com <- they have THOUSANDS.
2011-03-12T09:31:00.000Z	skullboy	[TK]D-Fender	i want a pop3 and stmp server
2011-03-12T09:31:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	And I jsut gave you the precise names of several.
2011-03-12T09:32:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	The kind of names you could.. I dunno ... look for in the ubuntu software center or Synaptic.
2011-03-12T09:32:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	And then the kind of names you could .... maybe Google up a how-to for.
2011-03-18T01:57:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	Pick an MTA and install it.
2011-03-18T01:57:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	sendmail, postfix, exim, there are plenty of others
2011-03-18T01:59:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	MTA = mail server.
2011-03-18T01:59:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	what do you want to do exactly?
2011-03-18T02:00:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	all of the programs I mentioned are exactly that.  You run it on your server you point your domain to your box, you add your own users.
2011-03-18T02:03:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	Install a 20$ Linksys router and let somone connect to it
2011-03-18T02:03:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	And charge for service.  Instant ISP
2011-03-18T02:24:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	then set up a proxy on that machine
2011-03-18T02:18:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	You started from wanting to install a mail server, to becoming an ISP, from becoming independent of any upstream providers service, to spoofing (When is this NOT malicious?).  You seem to be trying to go from zero to "hacker god" in 0 steps and asking questions that you believe will be answered entirely in IRC in a GUI-happy distro channel.  You should re-evaluate your goals & methods
2011-03-18T02:23:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	skullboy	Again, how is this not "malicious"?
