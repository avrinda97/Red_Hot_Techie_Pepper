2012-07-06T09:47:00.000Z	_nedR	IPfreely	thanks for reply.. i just get confused over the whole mode numbers thing.. let me check it out
2012-07-06T09:51:00.000Z	IPfreely		flux so you want ugo User to read write execute , group read write Execute , other execute
2012-07-06T09:52:00.000Z	_nedR		ls
2012-07-06T09:54:00.000Z	_nedR	IPfreely	i think my file permissions are opposite.. the .ssh directory is rwx for user (so 700 i guess) and id_rsa is rw for user (so 600)..
2012-07-06T09:55:00.000Z	IPfreely		did you try chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=x
2012-07-06T09:55:00.000Z	_nedR		actually this makes more sense...
2012-07-06T09:55:00.000Z	IPfreely	_nedR	yes I PMed you that after I hit enter on that
2012-07-06T09:55:00.000Z	_nedR		oh sorry didn't see that
2012-07-06T09:55:00.000Z	IPfreely		NP
2012-07-06T09:55:00.000Z	IPfreely		glad you got it
2012-07-06T09:56:00.000Z	_nedR		another question is this id_rsa file encrypted?
2012-07-06T09:56:00.000Z	_nedR		cause it looks like anyone using my pc can just copy it off
2012-07-06T09:56:00.000Z	IPfreely		you can control who get ssh with the /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2012-07-06T09:57:00.000Z	IPfreely	_nedR	install firestarter firewall and portsentry on the portsentry set attempt to 2
2012-07-06T09:57:00.000Z	IPfreely		it will block failed attempts and auto add them to your deny list
2012-07-06T09:58:00.000Z	IPfreely		flux you try chmod 0771
2012-07-06T09:58:00.000Z	IPfreely		including the umask
2012-07-06T09:59:00.000Z	_nedR		ok thanks for reply.. am doing what you suggested...but i think what you are talking about is ssh-agent (not sure)... my question is id_rsa (which stores the private key, i think) encrypted.. because otherwise it is a bit like a password file stored in plain text
2012-07-06T10:00:00.000Z	IPfreely	_nedR	you can change your jey just generate a new one
