2006-08-13T16:05:00.000Z	Tamale		i have no sound with the flashplugin when watching youtube, but xmms works fine.  sound in flash file doesn't work even if i don't have anything else open.. any ideas?
2006-08-13T16:06:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	installed any codecs?
2006-08-13T16:06:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	nothing abnormal i don't think so
2006-08-13T16:07:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	you don't have w32codecs installed?
2006-08-13T16:07:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	is that the package name?
2006-08-13T16:08:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	what I am suggesting is that may be you have to have the correct codecs installed for whatever you are trying to listen to
2006-08-13T16:09:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	Well, I didn't have w32codecs, just got 'em.  i'll try this youtube vid again
2006-08-13T16:09:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	give me a url
2006-08-13T16:10:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKX0RN19zc0
2006-08-13T16:11:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	no problem for me, I use xine engine, libxine-extracodecs & w32codecs
2006-08-13T16:13:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	$ sudo update-flashplugin
2006-08-13T16:15:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	called flashplugin-nonfree but why are you doing that?
2006-08-13T16:15:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	I'm just tryin to get the audio to work
2006-08-13T16:16:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	if you have flash already installed you don't need to do anything more with that
2006-08-13T16:17:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	Well, what might be wrong with the audio?  it works on some sites
2006-08-13T16:18:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	don't have the correct codecs installed is the most likely cause I would say, but might be wrong
2006-08-13T16:18:00.000Z	Tamale	TheGateKeeper	How can i tell what codecs I have installed, and what this flash file is trying to use?
2006-08-13T16:19:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	not sure with adept but with synaptic search codecs and it will show you which ones you have installed
2006-08-13T16:20:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Tamale	I don't know what it is using, only that it works for me with the combination I gave you
