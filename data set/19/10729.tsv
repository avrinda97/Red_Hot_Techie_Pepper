2006-05-19T15:48:00.000Z	Akuma_		im trying to switch from windows to ubuntu, but im having a hard time finding all the drivers i need. is there any 'central' place where i could look that up? googling every device i have takes foreever
2006-05-19T15:49:00.000Z	Akuma_		right now im mostly concerned about my graphics card, SiS M760GX, and my wireless usb, Netgear WG111
2006-05-19T15:50:00.000Z	Akuma_		i read about ndiswrapper for my wireless device, but cant find any real answer for the graphics card
2006-05-19T15:51:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	do you have the windows drivers for your wireless card?
2006-05-19T15:52:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	install ndiswrapper and follow the steps of the tutorial
2006-05-19T15:52:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	no..i work with ndiswrapper and it works great
2006-05-19T15:53:00.000Z	Akuma_	frfx	i'll try it then. thanks
2006-05-19T15:54:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	here it works..just try..
2006-05-19T15:55:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	if you don't try it won't work ;)
2006-05-19T15:55:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	you said you have the windows drivers?
2006-05-19T15:55:00.000Z	Akuma_	frfx	true. but i also need a long time to format, install two operating systems, etc etc. so if i know something wont work at all, i'd rather wait till i get a new computer
2006-05-19T15:56:00.000Z	Akuma_	frfx	i do
2006-05-19T15:56:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	so you don't have ubuntu now?
2006-05-19T15:59:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	here the live cd also works but also no internet because the live cd doesnt include ndiswrapper
2006-05-19T16:01:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	older systems are better supported, but you want a new computer.. but you can google on "linux YourNewComputer"
2006-05-19T16:03:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	are you going to buy a laptop?
2006-05-19T16:05:00.000Z	Akuma_	frfx	im trying to. but its pretty complicated
2006-05-19T16:05:00.000Z	Akuma_	frfx	i wanna get it from US. much cheaper
2006-05-19T16:06:00.000Z	frfx	Akuma_	where do you live? if you want to buy a laptop: check http://www.linux-laptop.net/
