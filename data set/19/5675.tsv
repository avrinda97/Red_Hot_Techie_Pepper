2009-12-15T04:25:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	say your question all at once and see if someone replies...what kind of sound problem are you having?
2009-12-15T04:27:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	you can try looking in System --> Administration --> System Testing
2009-12-15T04:28:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	when you go to the terminal and type in 'alsa-mixer' are any of the outputs muted?
2009-12-15T04:30:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	did you run the System Testing in System --> Administration?
2009-12-15T04:32:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	ok
2009-12-15T04:41:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	what does the command  'lshw -c Multimedia' give you?
2009-12-15T04:42:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	what does the command  'lshw -c Multimedia' give you?
2009-12-15T04:44:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	at least it isnt an Intel device...what about this command 'sudo aplay -l' that is an L
2009-12-15T04:46:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	if you right click on the sound device in your taskbar and go to the hardware tab, what kind of device does it say in the dropdown box?
2009-12-15T04:47:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	if it is on analog change to digital and vice versa...then see if sound works
2009-12-15T04:49:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	did you go to sound preferences and see what the hardware is showing in the dropdown box?
2009-12-15T04:49:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	my profile setting is: Analog Stereo Duples
2009-12-15T04:52:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	you have no hardware in the hardware tab? then maybe the module isnt being loaded
2009-12-15T04:54:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	have you seen this post: v

2009-12-15T04:56:00.000Z	alinuxfan	mesutcimeken	oooh...so what changed between the time it was working and the time it wasnt? did you install any new programs or remove any?
