2008-04-08T19:36:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Does anyone know how to check which version of Java I have installed?
2008-04-08T19:37:00.000Z	spasticteapot		I need JRE5 for BlueJ, and I don't know if it's installed or not.
2008-04-08T19:38:00.000Z	spasticteapot		I have a file called jdk-1_5_0_15-nb-6_0_1-linux-ml.sh
2008-04-08T19:38:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	java -version
2008-04-08T19:38:00.000Z	spasticteapot	pajamian	Thanks.
2008-04-08T19:39:00.000Z	spasticteapot	pajamian	That just tells me my runtime environment.
2008-04-08T19:39:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	hrmmmmm, probably jdk -version, then
2008-04-08T19:40:00.000Z	spasticteapot	pajamian	Command not found.
2008-04-08T19:40:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	usually you run it
2008-04-08T19:40:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	but you'll be better off installign it from a package
2008-04-08T19:41:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	I recommend: sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
2008-04-08T19:42:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	it's nearly always better to install an ubuntu package than to download from a website and install yourself
2008-04-08T19:43:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
2008-04-08T19:43:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	there's also a package for java6 if you'd prefer.
2008-04-08T19:43:00.000Z	spasticteapot	pajamian	No good. It won't work with my assignments.
2008-04-08T19:43:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	ok, then there is java5, which is what I just told you.
2008-04-08T19:44:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	make sure you have multiverse enabled.
2008-04-08T19:44:00.000Z	spasticteapot	pajamian	I have it installing.
2008-04-08T19:44:00.000Z	pajamian	spasticteapot	ok, cool
