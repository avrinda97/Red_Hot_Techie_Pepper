2006-03-12T13:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Anyone used the voice capability of Gaim 2?  I'm looking for ways to reduce my phone bill.
2006-03-12T13:56:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	I heard -vv is not in gaim-2.0 yet, try skype first
2006-03-12T13:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	How's skype work?  I've never tried/seen it.
2006-03-12T13:58:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	I use skype to call my friends in taiwan, China, even better than most phonecards, and computer to computer is free
2006-03-12T13:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	Free is very much the goal.
2006-03-12T14:00:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	the only thing bad is, skype is not GPL
2006-03-12T14:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	I'm still willing to consider it at least.
2006-03-12T14:01:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	tell me whether skype is in ubuntu, it's not in debian, because of the GPL issue
2006-03-12T14:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	There's a Breezy deb available from Seveas.
2006-03-12T14:04:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	gnomemeeting can do it also, but kind of crap to me :( skype is easy to use, and universal, linux, windows, mac, bsd,...
2006-03-12T14:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	Will look into.  Thanks.
2006-03-12T14:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	Mac, BSD yes, Windows no.
2006-03-12T14:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	I couldn't get gnomemeeting to work with an IP, only sip something or other.
2006-03-12T14:08:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	I tested, gnomemeeting with a windows (netmeeting)
2006-03-12T14:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	Huh.
2006-03-12T14:09:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	amsn is nice but not international by design
2006-03-12T14:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	I don't much need international as far as language, etc.  Just Canada-USA.
2006-03-12T14:11:00.000Z	dli_	tonyyarusso	much easier then, but I speak Chinese
2006-03-12T14:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dli_	That would do it.
