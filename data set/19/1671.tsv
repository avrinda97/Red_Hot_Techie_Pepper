2012-08-27T11:58:00.000Z	Daghdha		Hi, several times an hour (7 to 10 times) my bouncer loses connection with the internet. I think it may be related to a network problem on ubuntu, is there anyway to see if my network driver is crashing?
2012-08-27T11:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	your network driver is *not* crashing
2012-08-27T12:00:00.000Z	Daghdha	gordonjcp	Then what is causing it?
2012-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	flaky internet connection, most likely
2012-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	where is it running?
2012-08-27T12:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	you can safely rule out "crashing network drivers"
2012-08-27T12:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	where is it running?
2012-08-27T12:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	what are you running your bouncer on?
2012-08-27T12:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	can you be more specific?
2012-08-27T12:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	okay, and you're connecting from outside your house?
2012-08-27T12:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	most likely a) your internet connection at home is flaky and dropping out, or b) your internet connection at home is picking up new DHCP leases more frequently than you'd like and dropping connections
2012-08-27T12:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	there is no way your network driver is crashing
2012-08-27T12:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	it's unlikely the bouncer is crashing
2012-08-27T12:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	have a look at the stats from your modem
2012-08-27T12:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	a home internet connection isn't going to be 100% solid for what you want
2012-08-27T12:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	you really need something with a static IP address, at least
2012-08-27T12:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	does it have anything that shows how long it's been connected?
2012-08-27T12:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	and has your bouncer dropped since then?
2012-08-27T12:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Daghdha	it really, really sounds like your internet connection is dropping
