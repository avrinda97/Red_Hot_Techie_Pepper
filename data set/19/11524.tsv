2006-01-06T13:22:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		so has anyone configured wpa_supplicant so that it runs with rcS scripts... so that the wireless card is associated before rc40networking runs?  The reason is that my laptop hands on "Configuring network interfaces..." during boot until I ctrl-c it... or it times out.
2006-01-06T13:23:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		oops... S40networking
2006-01-06T13:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Since it seems you have some knowledge in the area, do you know how to move gdm to a later start # in /etc/rc2.d/?
2006-01-06T13:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Someone suggested it and I have no idea what that means.
2006-01-06T13:27:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	tonyyarusso	that was directed to you... sorry
2006-01-06T13:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Something like instead of S13gdm, maybe S23gdm?  Does it much matter what to?
2006-01-06T13:30:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	tonyyarusso	the first directory that is evalutaed on boot is /etc/rcS.d/    it then goes through the appropriate /etc/rc#.d directory... according to the run level yer in... (default is 2 in Ubuntu)....
2006-01-06T13:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	What is the purpose in life for levels 3-5?
2006-01-06T13:32:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	tonyyarusso	well.. in Ubuntu.. they're all the same as level 2...  but you can choose to have yer system run certain things in one runlevel than you would in others....
2006-01-06T13:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	And then set up different grub options for each of them, so you could boot according to your needs for that session?
2006-01-06T13:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Cool.  Will have to try that some time.
2006-01-06T13:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	I don't think that's actually solving my issue there.
2006-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	tonyyarusso	wait... yer console switching is disabled with the invocation of gdm?  describe problem.
2006-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	See above messages to yuma.
2006-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	tonyyarusso	eh... thats the only one I know of... like that anyway....   :-P
2006-01-07T12:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Yep, did that one once.
2006-01-09T14:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Me, for some ridiculous reason.  (3am here)
2006-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	Last ditch attempts to figure out if I can fix some things.
2006-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Kr0ntab	You?
