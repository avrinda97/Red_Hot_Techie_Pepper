2006-01-02T10:07:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	what's your wireless adapter?
2006-01-02T10:07:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	are you using wpa_supplicant for wpa?
2006-01-02T10:10:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	to use wpa on linux you have to install wpasupplicant
2006-01-02T10:12:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	and your wireless adapter and its driver have to support wpa
2006-01-02T10:12:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	that's why i asked you about your wireless card/adapter
2006-01-02T10:13:00.000Z	dapimp53	tuv	how do I pull up that info
2006-01-02T10:13:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	lspci

2006-01-02T10:14:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	madwifi is your driver and it does support wpa
2006-01-02T10:17:00.000Z	dapimp53	tuv	cool. Where can I get some information about how to set it up and where to get it
2006-01-02T10:17:00.000Z	tuv	dapimp53	did you try google: ubuntu madwifi wpa supplicant
