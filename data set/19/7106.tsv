2007-12-10T10:11:00.000Z	balzac		hello
2007-12-10T10:11:00.000Z	balzac		I'm trying to figure out the Apache server that comes with Gutsy Gibbon
2007-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	balzac		Is there a place that documents how it is set up?
2007-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	balzac		thanks
2007-12-10T10:13:00.000Z	balzac		I've already got all of that installed, I'm just trying to figure out how it's configured so I can use it.
2007-12-10T10:14:00.000Z	balzac		Also, I don't see phpmyadmin anywhere...
2007-12-10T10:14:00.000Z	balzac		I'll do some reading, but it's not a very user-friendly installation for apache beginners
2007-12-10T10:15:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	apt-get install phpmyadmin
2007-12-10T10:17:00.000Z	balzac	earlmred	what's wrong with xxamp?
2007-12-10T10:18:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	you're only going to be updating the various components when xampp makes a new release.
2007-12-10T10:18:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	rather than being able to do them individually
2007-12-10T10:18:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	so apt-get install apache php mysql phpmyadmin
2007-12-10T10:19:00.000Z	balzac	earlmred	that's too much responsibility for me to keep up with, plus piecemeal updates will break your applications
2007-12-10T10:19:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	uh, if you write crappy code, then yes.
2007-12-10T10:19:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	and you can't keep up with run apt-get update; apt-get upgrade nightly?
2007-12-10T10:20:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	run a script to do it :)
2007-12-10T10:23:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	cd /; find . | grep phpmyadmin
2007-12-10T10:26:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	sites-available is the config for all of your sites.
2007-12-10T10:26:00.000Z	earlmred	balzac	making a symlink to one of those sites from sites-enabled, enables the site.
