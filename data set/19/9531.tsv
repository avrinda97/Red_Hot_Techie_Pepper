2007-08-16T14:28:00.000Z	MikeyMike		has anyone tried to install skype 1.4 in dapper drake? i can't get libasound to satisfy the version requirement needed for the deb package
2007-08-16T14:30:00.000Z	MikeyMike		is pidgin not in the repositories for 6.06LTS?

2007-08-16T14:33:00.000Z	MikeyMike		well i am pretty partial to gaim but apparently pidgin supports direct connections with windows
