2011-08-23T21:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	10.l0 is still fully supported, so is not out of date at all
2011-08-23T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	statistically you COULD download an infinite number of files and never get a good one
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	also did you burn as slowly as you could?
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	macfire	ActionParsnip	but de PORBABILITY is near 0
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	macfire	ActionParsnip	2,4
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	it can happen though, so checks NEED to be done
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	macfire	ActionParsnip	i chech md5
2011-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	good, burning slow helps
2011-08-23T21:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	could try Oneiric, just to test
2011-08-23T21:58:00.000Z	macfire	ActionParsnip	I install the system, but I can not boot, it just stands in the message "Stopping save kernel messages"
2011-08-23T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	when startx fails, run:  less /var/loc/xorg.0.log    see what is bad
2011-08-23T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	you could blacklist the radeon and ati driver using bootoptions, may help
2011-08-23T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	macfire	try adding:  radeon.blacklist=1 ati.blacklist=1
2012-11-06T06:59:00.000Z	macfire	ActionParsnip	 Do you have a Tutorial for install ATI drivers?
