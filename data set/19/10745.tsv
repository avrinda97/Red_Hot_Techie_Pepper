2006-07-15T13:07:00.000Z	deep_		Hello there.
2006-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	deep_		I'm getting kinda moody at my computer right now, since i cant do ANYTHING.. Can you please check out http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=216375.
2006-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	deep_		Noone seems to have a solution.
2006-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	removing kubuntu-desktop won't delete everything, if that's what you're worried about
2006-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	deep_	Flannel	What is deleted with that then?
2006-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	just the meta package
2006-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	deep_	Flannel	Sry. Forgot to write your name :P
2006-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	you don't need to reinstall it, but yeah.
2006-07-15T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	Yeah, you're using debian unstable, that's bad ;)
2006-07-15T13:16:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	same thing.  kubuntu is a flavor of ubuntu
2006-07-15T13:16:00.000Z	deep_	Flannel	I know, i know. :D
2006-07-15T13:19:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	yes, but you don't lose anything by having them on two lines
2006-07-15T13:20:00.000Z	deep_	Flannel	No, but its complaining about it, it sais "DUPLICATE OF..." blahblah. And its just getting a little annoying. :)
2006-07-15T13:20:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	that's something else then.
2006-07-15T15:41:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	there are better editors for PHP (and theyre all more lightweight)
2006-07-15T15:42:00.000Z	deep_	Flannel	Yeah, but now its allready started. I guess i could just "apt-get remove eclipse*" later on, and install something else :p
2006-07-15T15:42:00.000Z	deep_	Flannel	But its alot of javastuff there to, But... they can stay. :P
2008-11-12T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	sudo apt-get remove --purge package, or in synaptic, "Complete removal"
2008-11-12T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	deep_	What configuration?  When/where did you change the configs?
