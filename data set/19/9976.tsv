2008-12-19T09:36:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	do an "$md5sum filenam" it returns a number check that number with the number that came with the file
2008-12-19T09:37:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	I need to check the cd content, but I got it using windows xp...
2008-12-19T09:38:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	go to linux prompt and type that command witht the filename being the flie or image that you want to do an md5sum for.
2008-12-19T09:39:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	from a torrent file (p2p network)
2008-12-19T09:39:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	ok , then u must have also downloaded a text file with the image.. had you?
2008-12-19T09:40:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	yes but let me give you the hole picture
2008-12-19T09:40:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	ok
2008-12-19T09:40:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	after I have burned the image successfully, I restart my pc and my bios is set to start up from the CD Driver.
2008-12-19T09:41:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	but when running the system from the cd, I decided to check it before installing it's content...obviously
2008-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	yeah.. its  wise to do a checksum before
2008-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	and this is what I got: " CHECKING BATTERY STATE  493749465 END-REQUEST:I/0 ERROR, DEV SR 0, SECTOR 582820 BUFFER I/0 ERROR ON DEVICE SR 0, LOGICAL BLOCK 145705 "
2008-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	does this mean that the image is corrupted?
2008-12-19T09:44:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	no command. I've just run the CD check before initializing the system
2008-12-19T09:44:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	remember, there is no linux OS on my other machine. only windows
2008-12-19T09:46:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	what is the file u are dealing with and for what purpose is it intended for and where exactly are u doing the cd check?
2008-12-19T09:48:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	the file is the content of the OS. it's the image itself. once starting the machine from the cd, there is an option to check the cd for errors. I'm running the CD content analysis to make sure the OS installation will succeed
2008-12-19T09:49:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	all i want to say about your problem is that, when you download a file sometimes u get a file with the md5 checksum value.. to check the intigrity of the file you do a md5checksum.. the result will be a key value. compare those 2 keyvalues. if they match everthing is ok.. if dont then chances are something a wrong
2008-12-19T09:50:00.000Z	rodolfo	earthling	yes, I know. but how to run the md5checksum on windows platform?
2008-12-19T09:51:00.000Z	earthling	rodolfo	well on a cd checksum sometimes we do get a checksum aerror.. but most of the time even then the cd installation installs without faill. if you are not making a critical server installation and want a installation for your deskyop then you can start installation most of the time
