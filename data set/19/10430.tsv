2012-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	SilvereX		So I've been having trouble with my mouse pointer elastically returning to the middle of the screen
2012-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	SilvereX		When playing games
2012-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	SilvereX		I've been googling it for ages and haven't found a fix, but I've just read that an application that does not like
2012-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	SilvereX		forced mouse warping includes the mouse pointer elastically returning to the middle of the screen
2012-10-08T14:22:00.000Z	SilvereX		Is this true, and if so, is there any way to fix it so my mouse will hide when running some applications?
2012-10-08T14:23:00.000Z	jrib	SilvereX	unclutter will hide your mouse pointer but I don't understand what you said before that
2012-10-08T14:23:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	When running some applications (specifically Far Cry 2) my desktop cursor stays in the middle of the screen
2012-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	SilvereX		When I move the mouse the cursor moves for a little bit before returning to the center of the screen
2012-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	SilvereX		The in game cursor works fine
2012-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	SilvereX	in wine?
2012-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	Yeah. I've been asking about it in #wine and so far have no responses
2012-10-08T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	SilvereX	does it happen outside of wine?  Like watching a full screen movie for example?
2012-10-08T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	SilvereX	or even one of the native fps on linux
2012-10-08T14:25:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	Watching a fullscreen movie is fine. It only happens when running some games
2012-10-08T14:28:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	It only seems to happen in windowed mode. When I run it in fullscreen it's fine, but the game doesn't take up the whole screen
2012-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	And when I quit, there seems to be some invisible barriers preventing me from moving my mouse to the far right and bottom of my screen
2012-10-08T14:30:00.000Z	jrib	SilvereX	laptop by any chance?
2012-10-08T14:30:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	Desktop computer
2012-10-08T14:30:00.000Z	SilvereX	jrib	12.04
