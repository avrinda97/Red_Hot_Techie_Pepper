2009-06-20T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	I used that program once in Windows, to recover data from a deleted Ext3 partition
2009-06-20T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	once? or a few times, whatever untill I had my data :)
2009-06-20T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	helping with recovering a deleted Vista partition hum
2009-06-20T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	I expect the Windows fan boys in ##windows have ideas on how you can recover the data as well
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	you should start saving stuff on Ext3  I think,  make yourself a Ext3 partition for only data, and you can share with Windows as well
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	and I didn't mean you, I meant some of the people that will go to the channel I suggested you joined
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	they will know how to get hold of the deleted data
2009-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	the data from the deleted partition
2009-06-20T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	well I know it does in Windows, but  haven't done it on Linux,  just as most/all of the people that come here won't have either.   you could also try this one in ##linux  the general Linux channel
2009-06-20T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ntemis	ok good luck
