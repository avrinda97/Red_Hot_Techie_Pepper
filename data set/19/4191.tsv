2010-05-07T05:22:00.000Z	effigy		anyone have experience getting music off an ipod touch?  i can mount it... and i read the files are in ipod_control/music ... but can i just copy all these # name folders... then clear the ipod touch... and move the files back?
2010-05-07T05:22:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	are you using lucid lynx¿
2010-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	yeah, lucid... i tried gtkpod but it wouldn't work
2010-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	gtkpod used to work with my ipod though, but this is an ipod touch
2012-09-23T09:24:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	but not the latest ubuntu, with 12.04 you'll have better chances to work with latest iOS
2012-09-23T09:24:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	but again, everytime iOS updates, ubuntu support is broken, it's a never ending story
2012-09-23T09:26:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	the fastest way would be a fresh install
2012-09-23T09:49:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	because you are using an old ubuntu release as i told you already
2012-09-23T09:50:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	don't come at me with the old release stuff, people have been putting mp3s on apple products for a long time
2012-09-23T09:51:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	yeah, everytime there is a new ubuntu release it supports the current iOS, then a new iOS version is releases and the support is broken...is a never ending story
2012-09-23T09:52:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	so if i update to the latest ubuntu it'll just start working?
2012-09-23T09:52:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	maybe...iOS 6 was just released
2012-09-23T09:57:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	apples just don't like neither want to play with penguins, not the oposite :)
2012-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	how about you just sens yoursel an email with the mp3 atached to it¿ or neither can you save files that are sent to your mail on an ipad/iOS ¿
2012-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	i know but when i had an ipod years ago i figure dout. don't have the ipod anymore i'm about to drive 12 hours and i really need to figure this out osaidjadfhgadfhf sorry haha
2012-09-23T09:59:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	you can't "download" files like that... i already tried uploading them to a server
2012-09-23T10:02:00.000Z	xangua	effigy	there is also Ubuntu Music if you use ubuntu one, you can sync your mp3 and also play them offline; it's a pay service but it's free the first month
2012-09-23T10:03:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	that doesn't put the mp3 on my ipad, i am going to be in the desert and really want to listen to this audio book
2012-09-23T10:07:00.000Z	effigy	xangua	i don't really get what you said
