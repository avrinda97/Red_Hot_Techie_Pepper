2006-10-27T09:31:00.000Z	joeljkp		ok, why doesn't evolution depend on a spam filter? it doesn't even suggest or recommend one!

2006-10-27T09:34:00.000Z	kitche	joeljkp	well it has a spam filter built in if you want a spam filter you will have to either put one of the server or b use mutt or soemthing like that with procmail or spamassassin
2006-10-27T09:35:00.000Z	joeljkp		mtjb, kitche: well i know you can enable a spam filter from within evolution
2006-10-27T09:35:00.000Z	joeljkp		mtjb, kitche: but i was under the impression that it used an external one for the actual filtering... spamassin, bogofilter...
2006-10-27T09:36:00.000Z	joeljkp		mtjb: yes, but i'm talking locally
2006-10-27T09:36:00.000Z	kitche	joeljkp	not really since spamassassin will only work if you have something getting the mail and keeping it in your local mailserver
2006-10-27T09:36:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	no, i've used it before, with spamassassin
2006-10-27T09:36:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	look at the evolution help, it even says it
2006-10-27T09:37:00.000Z	joeljkp		mtjb, kitche: "Evolution uses SpamAssassin* with trainable Bayesian filters to perform the spam check."
2006-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	kitche	joeljkp	I have never used evolution before since I haven't really used gnome but install spamassassin and set the filters up then sicne it's recommending spamassassin
2006-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	i'm just wondering why it installs evolution automatically, but no spam filter
2006-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	and doesn't even mention that you need to install one
2006-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	kitche	joeljkp	because evolution doesn't have one built in
2006-10-27T09:39:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	exactly
2006-10-27T09:39:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	so it should install one along with evolution
2006-10-27T09:39:00.000Z	kitche	joeljkp	no it should not sicne it leaves it to the user to install one
2006-10-27T09:40:00.000Z	joeljkp	kitche	you're an idiot
2006-10-27T09:41:00.000Z	kitche	joeljkp	I don't use spamassassin myself but there is spamassassin, procmail, and two other one so that's why evolution doesn't install one since it lets the user decide which filtering system to use it's not liek thunderbird which has a built in filter
