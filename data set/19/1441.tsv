2011-01-23T20:14:00.000Z	gpc	SAM__	you have maverick and natty repos enabled
2011-01-23T20:15:00.000Z	gpc	SAM__	a clean install is what you need now.
2011-01-23T20:15:00.000Z	gpc	SAM__	lsb_release -a
2011-01-23T20:16:00.000Z	gpc	SAM__	#ubuntu+1 is where you should be seeking support but like I said you have 3 different versions of repos. Clean install.
2011-01-26T02:32:00.000Z	gpc	SAM__	misconfiguration of your site is not an Ubuntu issue
