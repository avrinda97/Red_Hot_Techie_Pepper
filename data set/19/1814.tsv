2012-02-14T21:36:00.000Z	Khas		Hello.  I just installed the samba package, and it's not created the config directory for it.  Is that supposed to happen?
2012-02-14T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	you should have /etc/samba by default
2012-02-14T21:37:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	I don't.
2012-02-14T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc   please
2012-02-14T21:40:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	maverick.  Sorry, forgot to highligh
2012-02-14T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	strange, maverick had it.
2012-02-14T21:41:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	I previous had samba, then I uninstalled it.
2012-02-14T21:41:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	I may have purged it, but I would have assumed that reinstalling would have provided even a default config
2012-02-14T21:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	my /etc/samba/ only has 2 files. I can give them if you want?
2012-02-14T21:42:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	In fact, I'm certain I purged it, as it was broken and I new there was a config issue somewhere.  It's just taken me this long to reinstall it.
2012-02-14T21:42:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	no thanks, I deliberatly want fresh configs given how fickle samba is.  Does beg the question of why it doesn't install default configs though.
2012-02-14T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	mine are default..
2012-02-14T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	if you reinstall the samba-common package you should get both
2012-02-14T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	both files come from the samba-common package
2012-02-14T21:45:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	what else relies on samba-common then?  It's still on my system, and autoremove didn't get rid of it, implying it's still in use.
2012-02-14T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	not sure, reinstalling it will put the package comtents in the system, including those 2 files
2012-02-14T21:47:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	yeah, doing that now, strange that purging samba removes the files that it shouldn't touch if those files are related to samba-common.
2012-02-14T21:52:00.000Z	Khas	ActionParsnip	for future reference, there seems to be no relation to ownership of files between samba and samba-common.  I just installed samba-common, and it didn't install samba with it, though it tried to copy the configs across.
2012-02-14T21:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Khas	I just ran:  dpkg -S smb.conf    and it showed
