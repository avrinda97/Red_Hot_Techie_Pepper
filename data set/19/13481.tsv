2005-03-30T16:37:00.000Z	dash		anybody know the name of the source package for ipw2200 drivers?
2005-03-30T16:38:00.000Z	phanter	dash	linux_wlan_ng
2005-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	dash	phanter	Hmm
2005-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	dash	phanter	I do not see anything in there that saws ipw2200
2005-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	phanter	dash	I think I downloaded the module from the Debian website. I think it is in unstable there, but you can search that site. And it works!
2005-03-30T16:41:00.000Z	dash	phanter	odd
2005-03-30T16:41:00.000Z	phanter	dash	maybe I am mistaking!!!! it is linux-wlan-ng (different lines) :)
2005-03-30T16:41:00.000Z	dash	phanter	oh. yes, i downloaded that
2005-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	dash	phanter	it is not in there
2005-03-30T16:43:00.000Z	phanter	dash	what is not in where? I did not add any reposities, but it is in my synaptic
2005-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	dash	phanter	"grep ipw2200 **/*" shows nothing
2005-03-30T16:46:00.000Z	phanter	dash	where did I mention it should. I am on this moment using that driver on my laptop (I am on wireless) and I installed it via linux-wlan-ng. And that command you gave me does not return anything in my bash...
2005-03-30T16:48:00.000Z	dash	phanter	well
2005-03-30T16:48:00.000Z	dash	phanter	my ubuntu kernel contains a ipw2200 module
2005-03-30T16:49:00.000Z	dash	phanter	but i want the source :)
2005-03-30T16:49:00.000Z	phanter	dash	go to the website and download it. What is difficult about htat
2005-03-30T16:50:00.000Z	dash	phanter	it is harder than typing apt-get ;)
2005-03-30T16:52:00.000Z	phanter	dash	I should not do this because it is easy to find but here you have it: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/linux-wlan-ng
2005-03-31T17:00:00.000Z	phanter	dash	found it?
