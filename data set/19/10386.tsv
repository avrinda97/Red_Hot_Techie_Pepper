2007-12-30T23:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	Try man dd and check the format...
2007-12-30T23:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	you can use a gui program or dd from command line
2007-12-30T23:46:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	gui program which one... I looked at synaptic... dident see one
2007-12-30T23:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/YourUserName/Desktop/file.iso bs=2k         from command line  is the easiest
2007-12-30T23:48:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	I get dd: reading `/dev/cdrom': Input/output error
2007-12-30T23:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	you can try sudo and see if it is a permissions prob
2007-12-30T23:49:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	that was a sudo
2007-12-30T23:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	Then you have another problem to deal with
2007-12-30T23:50:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	Odd... the CD plays fine
2007-12-30T23:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	dd is pretty failsafe program...  dont know why it would not work.
2007-12-30T23:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	format of the command, not the disk
2007-12-30T23:52:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	now this is an AUDIO cd, and from man dd it looks like it only works on files... or am I mistaken?
2007-12-30T23:53:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	the format of the command looks good
2007-12-30T23:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	I have not tried to iso an audio cd with dd.  It should... but then there may be some drm issue that is hanging it up
2007-12-30T23:55:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	ok... here is the problem... I need to email an audio CD... suggestions?
2007-12-30T23:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	todd__	no, sorry. no ideas...  good luck with it...
2007-12-30T23:56:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	:-( damn! ok thanks
2007-12-30T23:59:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	omfg!!! I am an iddiot!!!... Right click on the cd icon and select copy disk, then change from the CD to a file! lol
2007-12-31T00:00:00.000Z	todd__	Jack_Sparrow	sorry man!
