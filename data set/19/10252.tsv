2006-09-30T14:08:00.000Z	Woosta		How do I kick ubuntu in the guts enough that it notices I just put the SD card back in?
2006-09-30T14:09:00.000Z	Woosta		[1]  1234  <-- like that
2006-09-30T14:10:00.000Z	Woosta		the pid (process ID) is the 1234 bit
2006-09-30T14:10:00.000Z	Woosta		sudo kill 1234  <-- that will kill the process
2006-09-30T14:10:00.000Z	Woosta		open a new shell then and type "ps ax | grep locate"
2006-09-30T14:10:00.000Z	Woosta		the first number on the resulting line is the pid
2006-09-30T14:11:00.000Z	Woosta		kill as above
2006-09-30T14:11:00.000Z	Woosta		Anyone know anything about my question above?

2006-09-30T14:13:00.000Z	Woosta		Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't
2006-09-30T14:13:00.000Z	Woosta		if it were a standard card reader, I'd just unplug/plug it and it would be seed by hald
2006-09-30T14:14:00.000Z	Woosta		Is THX-1138 a bot spouting random tips or did I just miss the context?
2006-09-30T14:14:00.000Z	Woosta		guess I missed the context :)
2006-09-30T14:14:00.000Z	Woosta		lol
