2008-11-15T17:25:00.000Z	jmmg		could you help me with a problem with my ati GPU drivers?
2008-11-15T17:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	Not unless you tell us what the problem is.
2008-11-15T17:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	!pastebin your xorg.conf please
2008-11-15T17:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	Also the error log from the x-server will be helpful
2008-11-15T17:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	/var/log/X(something)
2008-11-15T17:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	atleast the last 40 lines
2008-11-15T17:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	as ubottu told you.
2008-11-15T17:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	No, no, no!
2008-11-15T17:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	It's ok. You're not the first. :)
2008-11-15T17:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	Also look in /var/log for your error log from the X-server and grab the last 30 lines from that file.
2008-11-15T17:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	That will help alot.
2008-11-15T17:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log|grep \(EE\)
2008-11-15T17:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	That will be more useful I think.
2008-11-15T17:37:00.000Z	jmmg	BlueEagle	http://paste.ubuntu.com/72333/plain/ Is this what you want?
2008-11-15T17:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=926530
2008-11-15T17:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	That's the most relevant link I found when googling for the last error message you got.
2008-11-15T17:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	jmmg	You're welcome. :)
2008-11-15T17:44:00.000Z	jmmg	BlueEagle	I do it, Have I to restart?
