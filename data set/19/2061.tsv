2010-08-02T19:05:00.000Z	hotstew		I managed to get through the graphical login after I deinstalled gdm
2010-08-02T19:06:00.000Z	hotstew		then I got into xterm, reinstalled gdm and opened gnome-manager
2010-08-02T19:06:00.000Z	hotstew		which is pretty basic though
2010-08-02T19:06:00.000Z	hotstew		what do I do from here?
2010-08-02T19:06:00.000Z	hotstew		I'm like an earthworm worming his way through XD
2010-08-02T19:07:00.000Z	hotstew		basically I need to get normal gnome system back so I can log into that
2010-08-02T19:09:00.000Z	hotstew		it says it's already active
2010-08-02T19:09:00.000Z	hotstew		which makes sense because I'm in gnome
2010-08-02T19:09:00.000Z	hotstew		only I got there through xterm
2010-08-02T19:09:00.000Z	hotstew		and I don't see my normal panels and stuff
2010-08-02T19:10:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	what happened that you doing this?
2010-08-02T19:10:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	you couldn't login, so how did you get an xterm?
2010-08-02T19:12:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	i am NOT an expert but what you MIGHT try is backing up your entire home directory, completely uninstall gnome and reinstall from scratch
2010-08-02T19:13:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	then when it works (if it works) you put your home dir back - and hopefully what's screwed up isn't in a config file there
2010-08-02T19:13:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	i would do that from a console
2010-08-02T19:14:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	and there is a lot of stuff to remove and put back - i don't know the names of the packages and you won't have synaptic there to tell you - it might be easier to reload ubuntu
2010-08-02T19:39:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	that solved your prob?
2010-08-02T19:41:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	do you make backups?
2010-08-02T19:41:00.000Z	blitzo	hotstew	i have been learning about these things lately
