2010-10-05T01:18:00.000Z	alaing		does vsftpd have a channel?
2010-10-05T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	#vsftpd (its small :-))
2010-10-05T01:21:00.000Z	alaing	guntbert	i see what you mean :)
2010-10-07T01:47:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	remember linux is case sensitive
2010-10-07T01:50:00.000Z	alaing	guntbert	Thanks that was the problem for some reason the extension was in caps. JPG rather than jpg. I renamed it and it works
2010-10-07T01:51:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	you're welcome :-) ("worked in windows" was the cue)
2011-01-12T02:41:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	please stop those off topic comments
2011-01-13T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	look into /var/log  (either boot...  or syslog...)
2011-01-13T02:31:00.000Z	alaing	guntbert	thanks let me have a look
2011-01-13T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	a hint for looking through those: a file manager for CLI is useful - I use mc
2011-01-13T02:34:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	(like terminal)
2011-01-13T02:34:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	sudo apt-get install mc
2011-01-13T02:36:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	in the CLI type:  mc (and look at the bottom for useful F keys)
2011-01-13T02:37:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	of course
2011-01-13T02:38:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	got you hooked ? :-)
2011-08-15T00:03:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	I have 10, so no need to worry
2011-08-15T00:08:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	no problem :)
2012-01-24T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	don't
2012-01-24T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	alaing	every attacker could make good use of that
