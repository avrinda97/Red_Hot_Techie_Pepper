2009-05-31T03:17:00.000Z	axisys		why is the proftpd xferlog timestamp 1 hour behind the OS time ? (asked in proftpd chnl as well)
2009-05-31T03:18:00.000Z	axisys		but proftpd xferlog shows 1 hr behind
2009-05-31T03:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	axisys	i had the same problem with proftpd a long time ago - don't remember if i even fixed it...  seem to remember it being something in proftpd's config file.  best of luck.
2009-05-31T03:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	axisys	i don't run proftpd anymore so i got nothing.  i was just letting you know that "your no alone".  good luck man.

2009-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	axisys	Magnesium if intel had 64 somewhere in there cpu name we'd know
2009-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	axisys	ZykoticK9	here is the cpuinfo -> http://pastebin.com/f116a8062
2009-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	axisys	ZykoticK9	does that tell you if the cpu is 64 bit ?
2009-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	axisys	yes - and if intel had "64" in there name we'd all see it in cpuinfo - but because they don't - we have to research the chips name...
2010-02-05T21:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	axisys	i couldn't find Swiftfox in PPA!  you added AWN didn't you?  which is unrelated to Swiftfox.  I could only find a DEB from their site, no repos.  best of luck.
2010-02-05T21:45:00.000Z	axisys	ZykoticK9	yep AWN .. that explains
