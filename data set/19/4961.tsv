2008-09-29T23:21:00.000Z	scampbell		for firefox issues, be sure you have 'security updates' and 'recommended updates' enabled.  There is a known issue where having only 'security updates' enabled will leave you with a problem.
2008-09-29T23:22:00.000Z	scampbell		firefox issues: synaptic -> settings -> repositories -> updates to check that you have 'security' and 'updates' enabled.
2008-09-29T23:24:00.000Z	cappslocke	scampbell	both hardy-security and hardy-updates are enabled =[
2008-09-29T23:24:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	ok, that was the one that I knew of that caused issues.
2008-09-29T23:24:00.000Z	cappslocke	scampbell	lets see what happens if i use the dev trun
2008-09-29T23:24:00.000Z	cappslocke		k
2008-09-29T23:25:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	you might just  mv .mozilla svmozilla   so you get new configs, in case it's just a config issue.
2008-09-29T23:26:00.000Z	cappslocke	scampbell	ive actually fully removed /etc/mozilla as well as ~/.mozilla, after having completely removed firefox. then tried reinstalling, and no luck
2008-09-29T23:27:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	did you try running from a command line to see if any usuable error message appears?
2008-09-29T23:27:00.000Z	cappslocke		AND, oddly enough, it works as root user ~_~
2008-09-29T23:28:00.000Z	cappslocke		yes, it just sits there, hold
2008-09-29T23:28:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	oh, big hint.  I hosed mine up once by doing a   sudo firefox   it created config files only readable by root under my home directory.  Try   find ~ -user 0  to find root owned files under you home directory.
2008-09-29T23:29:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	and the way out is to just chown the affected files of course.  I hope that's the issue.
2008-09-29T23:30:00.000Z	cappslocke	scampbell	hmm, thanks for the hint, ill try that
2008-09-29T23:30:00.000Z	cappslocke		right now my console decided to freeze ~_~
2008-09-29T23:30:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	that's odd.  do you have lots of odd issues like that?
2008-09-29T23:30:00.000Z	cappslocke	scampbell	sigh, no, this *just* happened.
2008-09-29T23:31:00.000Z	scampbell	cappslocke	ok, was just concerned there might be deeper issues.
2008-09-29T23:31:00.000Z	cappslocke	scampbell	heh, im actually now having to ssh into my own box from a windows box using putty in order to manage it via command line T_T
