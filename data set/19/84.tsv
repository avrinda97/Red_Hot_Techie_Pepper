2012-10-22T09:21:00.000Z	irinix		Is there a simple way to do a line by line character read from the terminal?
2012-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	irinix		trying to a get a line by line char output for Dwarf Fortress
2012-10-22T09:23:00.000Z	irinix		it does in a curses based one.
2012-10-22T09:23:00.000Z	irinix		we're trying to write an AI to play the game, but can't get past the interface.
2012-10-22T09:24:00.000Z	Mechdave_	irinix	what language are you using to develop this AI player?
2012-10-22T09:24:00.000Z	irinix		python
2012-10-22T09:25:00.000Z	irinix		copy copy.  They probably pulled from memory though, we're trying to avoid that.
2012-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	Mechdave_	irinix	have a look at http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html reading files is really similar to reading console pipe
2012-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	Mechdave_	irinix	then try #python :)
2012-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	irinix	Mechdave_	we can read stdout but its all control characters and very difficult to map.
2012-10-22T09:27:00.000Z	irinix		We've been unable to find a COMPLETE list of control codes, and the partial ones miss a lot of the term setup.
2012-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	Mechdave_	irinix	you should be able to intercept the stdout stream and it all be ascii. Also remember there is stderr streram as well :)
2012-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	irinix	Mechdave_	we've been doing that.
2012-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	irinix		Its all curses formatted
2012-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	irinix		and no one knows what they do.
2012-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	irinix		lots of control characters.
2012-10-22T09:30:00.000Z	Mechdave_	irinix	Oh dear :( Maybe this might help --> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3999114/linux-pipe-into-python-ncurses-script-stdin-and-termios
2012-10-22T09:30:00.000Z	irinix		I'll check that out.
2012-10-22T09:31:00.000Z	Mechdave_	irinix	I just googled read stdout curses with python
