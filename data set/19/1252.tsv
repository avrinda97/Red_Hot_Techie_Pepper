2011-11-28T07:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	why are you compiling rather than installing the package?
2011-11-28T07:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	why are you compiling rather than installing the package?

2011-11-28T07:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	what can't you find?
2011-11-28T07:26:00.000Z	ayrton_	almoxarife	i cant find the mesa 7.11 package like .deb
2011-11-28T07:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+package/libegl1-mesa <-- this help?
2011-11-28T07:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+package/libegl1-mesa
2011-11-28T07:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	no, you would pick a amd64
2011-11-28T07:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	alrighty then, compile away
2011-11-28T07:43:00.000Z	ayrton_	almoxarife	i got the .deb package from your link and when i try to install it wont let me press the install butten in the software center
2011-11-28T07:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	got the deb? you did what? dowload?
2011-11-28T07:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	I don't use software center, so I am useless as to why it would or would not allow something to happen, you might want to install gdebi, simpler and no overhead for local installs
2011-11-28T07:50:00.000Z	ayrton_	almoxarife	i get Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libegl1-mesa (= 7.11-0ubuntu3) when trying to install the package with gdebi
2011-11-28T07:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	ayrton_	I remember you telling me there was no 7.11 for natty, yet there you are with a 7.11, which came from? oneric?
