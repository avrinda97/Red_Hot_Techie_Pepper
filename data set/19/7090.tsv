2008-07-23T04:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	Odd-rationale	That's what I thought. His card is new enough where the ATI binary may be the only way to go. I don't know if we dare even go there though :p
2008-07-23T04:08:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	bobertdos	are you thinking envyng?
2008-07-23T04:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	Odd-rationale	either that or follwoing the dkms procedure, but again, I don't know if I'd have the stamina, if you catch my drift.
2008-07-23T04:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	bobertdos	me too. i'm too scared/tired to go there...
2008-07-24T22:49:00.000Z	bobertdos	Odd-rationale	Does Chad's Grub work yet?? :p
2008-07-24T22:49:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	bobertdos	nope.... :(

2008-07-25T00:51:00.000Z	bobertdos	Odd-rationale	Do you know if modprobe or some other terminal command can fully reprobe a system's hardware?
2008-07-25T00:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	bobertdos	umm... try this one "sudo reboot" ;)
2008-07-25T00:56:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	bobertdos	did that work?
2008-07-25T00:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	Odd-rationale	sigh, could you do me a favor and help me talk to boGGdy? I'm a little stumped.
2008-07-25T00:58:00.000Z	bobertdos	Odd-rationale	We're trying to figure out why the ethernet interface would be recognized in a live session, but not in a hard drive install.
