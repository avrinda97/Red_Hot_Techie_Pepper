2005-07-23T08:56:00.000Z	ksmurf		There is a couple of questions I have like how do I do it
2005-07-23T08:56:00.000Z	ksmurf		http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/315370
2005-07-23T08:57:00.000Z	ksmurf		tririum .... It's in the paste bin....
2005-07-23T08:57:00.000Z	ksmurf		it's about bash scripts and starting them at startup
2005-07-23T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	that seems pretty generic
2005-07-23T08:58:00.000Z	ksmurf	nickrud	that's what I thought
2005-07-23T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	but accurate
2005-07-23T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	for example, you could create a bash script that does  'hdparm -d1 /dev/cdrom', drop it into /etc/init.d, and use update-rc.d to add it to the /etc/rc2.d directory
2005-07-23T09:01:00.000Z	ksmurf	nickrud	That's what I want.....  how do I write the script
2005-07-23T09:03:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/315372
2005-07-23T09:04:00.000Z	ksmurf	nickrud	how do I make it exacutable
2005-07-23T09:04:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	sudo chmod u+x /etc/init.d/<whatever you named it>
2005-07-23T09:06:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	then, sudo update-rc.d <whatever you named it> defaults
2005-07-23T09:06:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	correction,  sudo update-rc.d <whatever you named it> defaults 99
2005-07-23T09:17:00.000Z	ksmurf	nickrud	.... that didn't like me either
2005-07-23T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	may I pm you?
2005-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	netstat?
2005-10-25T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	ksmurf	netstat will show everything, even the local unix sockets.
