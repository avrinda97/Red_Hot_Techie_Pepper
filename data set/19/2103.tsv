2010-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	Give me a minute, I'm having trouble understanding your problem.
2010-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	Just need to read it again a couple of times. :P
2010-07-03T06:26:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	Is your goal to be able to use this script as is?
2010-07-03T06:26:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	Or are you trying to make your own using it as a model?
2010-07-03T06:29:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	So you're trying to make the folders under /etc/apache2/sites-available/ symlink to folders in your home directory?
2010-07-03T06:29:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	If I'm understanding it properly, you have those links backwards.
2010-07-03T06:33:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	/etc/apache2/sites-available/VHOST should be a symlink to the VHOST in your home directory.
2010-07-03T06:34:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	You are not understanding what a symlink is.
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	daichi	maxwellian	the script creates the VHOST in teh home folder -- i want to link it to the /etc/apache2/sites-available folder
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	A symlink does not copy or move anything around.
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	It's like a shortcut in Windows.
2010-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	What you want to happen is that when you run that Apache setup utility, it will look in the /etc/.../sites-available/VHOST and will FOLLOW the symlink back to your home directory.
2010-07-03T06:41:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	ln -s /etc/apache2/sitesavailable/help ~/ABC/help
2010-07-03T06:41:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	Er, sites-available
2010-07-03T06:41:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	Those are not real filenames, obviously.
2010-07-03T06:41:00.000Z	daichi	maxwellian	^^ i know
2010-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	maxwellian	daichi	As you should. :)
