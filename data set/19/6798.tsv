2008-02-25T04:55:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		hi guys, i got a problem...
2008-02-25T04:57:00.000Z	DOOM_NX		I got a dual boot system, Ubuntu and WinVista. I got suddenly a BSOD in Vista and then after rebooting it fails to loard windows. I can succesfully load Ubuntu. My NTFS partitions though have disappeared... What can I do to enable them? i got important data from 6 years pc use...
2008-02-25T04:58:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Hmm. Try a livecd and see if the partitions are available there
2008-02-25T04:59:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Odd-rationale	i can see the drives through fdisk -l but i can't mount any partition
2008-02-25T04:59:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Have you tried the mount command?
2008-02-25T05:00:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Odd-rationale	it says something about NTFS being used or so
2008-02-25T05:00:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Have you tried to force mount?
2008-02-25T05:00:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Odd-rationale	no, i didn't take the risk
2008-02-25T05:01:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	As long as you don't blame me...
2008-02-25T05:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Can you boot windows into safe mode or command prompt and run a chdisk?
2008-02-25T05:07:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Sorry about that. Got disconnected.
2008-02-25T05:07:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Odd-rationale	it's ok
2008-02-25T05:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	The reason that usually happens is when Windows is not shutdown properly. NTFS cannot handle that very well.
2008-02-25T05:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Do you have another Windows machine, or one you have access to?
2008-02-25T05:14:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Odd-rationale	no, sorry
2008-02-25T05:15:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Any windows friends? You can try to attach your HDD to their machine and then simply safely remove it.
2008-02-25T05:16:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Other wise, your only option is to force mount it. I've done it before without loosing any data.
2008-02-25T05:16:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Did it work?
2008-02-25T05:19:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	DOOM_NX	Hurray! good for you.
