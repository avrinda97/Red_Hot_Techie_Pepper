2011-02-25T14:30:00.000Z	amarin		hello
2011-02-25T14:30:00.000Z	amarin		How Can I improve the security of ubuntu
2011-02-25T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	where do you feel it is weak ?
2011-02-25T14:30:00.000Z	amarin		not much at the moment actually I just wish to improve it, maybe a new firewall
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	what's wrong with the current firewall ?
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	amarin	ikonia	There is no tripwire
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	amarin		or is there
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	a firewall has nothing to do with tripwire
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	amarin		im not aware of one.
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	amarin		thanks
2011-02-25T14:31:00.000Z	amarin		love you
2011-02-25T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	be very aware of what tripwire will do before you install it
2011-02-25T14:32:00.000Z	amarin		what will it do
2011-02-25T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	I suggest you read up on what it is and what it does/how it works before you install it if you have to ask "what will it do"
2011-02-25T14:33:00.000Z	amarin		lol
2011-02-25T14:33:00.000Z	amarin		ok
2011-02-25T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	is this machine your home PC ?
2011-02-25T14:33:00.000Z	amarin		yeah
2011-02-25T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	amarin	the odds of you needing or wanting tripwire on your machine are very slim, more so if you don't know what it even does
