2005-04-03T11:22:00.000Z	kevman		Hey, when I try to make something, I get this error: "configure: error: Can't find X includes""
2005-04-03T11:22:00.000Z	kevman		I assume I need to get the x develop package, but I don't know what package to get
2005-04-03T11:23:00.000Z	akk	kevman	apt-get build-dep for a similar X package should get all the X headers and other development requirements.
2005-04-03T11:24:00.000Z	kevman	akk	what would the command be? I don't understand you.
2005-04-03T11:25:00.000Z	akk	kevman	What are you trying to build?
2005-04-03T11:25:00.000Z	kevman		Just a KDE theme
2005-04-03T11:25:00.000Z	akk	kevman	Do you have any other kde themes already installed?
2005-04-03T11:26:00.000Z	kevman		No, I just got KDE a few hours ago.
2005-04-03T11:26:00.000Z	kevman		I think I got it...
2005-04-03T11:26:00.000Z	akk	kevman	Try something like: apt-get build-dep kde-icons-crystal
2005-04-03T11:27:00.000Z	akk	kevman	using any kde theme package name.  That should get all the build requirements.
2005-04-03T11:27:00.000Z	kevman		Well, I'm fetching xlibs-dev now... We'll see of that works
2005-04-03T11:32:00.000Z	kevman		Well, now I need Qt, but of course can't figurew out the package name
2005-04-03T11:32:00.000Z	akk	kevman	You know about apt-cache search and aptitude search?
2005-04-03T11:33:00.000Z	kevman	akk	Yes, but they are aall like documentations and tools for developing.
2005-04-03T11:34:00.000Z	kevman		libqt3-dev?
2005-04-03T11:34:00.000Z	akk	kevman	Adding a "| grep dev" to the end of the search line is often appropriate when you're trying to find development headers.
2005-04-03T11:36:00.000Z	akk	kevman	Those qt and gtk packages do tend to proliferate, so anything like dev that you can give grep to make the list smaller can help in searching ...
2005-04-03T11:36:00.000Z	kevman	akk	I think I found the right package... libqt3-dev
