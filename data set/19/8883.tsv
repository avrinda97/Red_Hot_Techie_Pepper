2007-01-23T08:10:00.000Z	ring		I'm having some issues getting X to run.  When i startx or xinit the screen blanks.  I have an ATI x800xl, I've tried the ATI, vesa and fglrx drivers.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
2007-01-23T08:11:00.000Z	ring		i know how to start x
2007-01-23T08:11:00.000Z	ring		i can't ctrl+alt+backspace or ctrl+alt+plus
2007-01-23T08:11:00.000Z	ring		sorry for the snippy response just fed up with this :(
2007-01-23T08:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	ctrl alt f1 work?
2007-01-23T08:12:00.000Z	ring	frogzoo	none of it works -- Xorg.0.log shows no obvious errors either
2007-01-23T08:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	you did remove the stylus/wacom settings from xorg.conf ?
2007-01-23T08:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	x800 definitely works, so don't panic
2007-01-23T08:14:00.000Z	ring	frogzoo	xorg.conf is here: http://daemon.stanford.edu/~ring/xorg.old and the Xorg.0.log is here: http://daemon.stanford.edu/~ring/xorg.old
2007-01-23T08:14:00.000Z	ring	frogzoo	xorg.conf is here: http://daemon.stanford.edu/~ring/xorg.old and the Xorg.0.log is here: http://daemon.stanford.edu/~ring/Xorg.0.log
2007-01-23T08:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	get rid of #1 - all the wacom stuff, & 2# all the modes except bpp24
2007-01-23T08:23:00.000Z	ring	frogzoo	i removed all the modes but 24 adn all the wacom stuff -- still no luck
2007-01-23T08:23:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	not fair
2007-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	hmm....BusID"PCI:5:0:0"
2007-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	ring	frogzoo	lspci lists that as the proper busid for the card
2007-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	that's odd - 1:0:0 is normal
2007-01-23T08:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	nope, it's worth a shot
2007-01-23T08:25:00.000Z	ring	frogzoo	i've had it working in suse and that is the same busid used
2007-01-23T08:26:00.000Z	frogzoo	ring	also, what's with the usefbdev ?
