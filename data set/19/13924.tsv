2004-12-13T16:08:00.000Z	clee	mpt	well, I'm a sucker for a good Debian distro
2004-12-13T16:08:00.000Z	clee	mpt	and Ubuntu's basically a better Debian than Debian
2004-12-13T16:08:00.000Z	clee		timely updates, easy installer
2004-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	clee		free CDs in the mail
2004-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	clee		what's not to like? :)
2004-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	clee		well, ok, I'm not too crazy about GNOME, being a KDE dev and all.
2004-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	mpt		Fair enough
2004-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	clee		but I compile KDE from CVS anyway, so it's not like the lack of KDE hits me very hard
2004-12-13T16:11:00.000Z	mpt	clee	Apart from the KDElessness, anything you really don't like?
2004-12-13T16:11:00.000Z	clee	mpt	well, they employ some unsavory types, like daniels
2004-12-13T16:12:00.000Z	clee	mpt	seriously though... nope. And it keeps getting better.
2004-12-13T16:12:00.000Z	clee	mpt	like I said. being a KDE dev, and all... :)
