2012-04-14T19:59:00.000Z	ChrisWere		this hissing is constant, even without any media players, how do I change from XV vs GL vs VDPAU?
2012-04-14T20:00:00.000Z	ChrisWere		yes the hissing is through the headphones, I've had a play around with the outputs, but it doesn't change anything.
2012-04-14T20:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	does it sound like sssssssssssssssssssss.   ya I hate that
2012-04-14T20:02:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	yeah its a sssssssssssssssss, like it's a very cheap sound card. But I payed a fair bit for this.
2012-04-14T20:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	there are some cool filters in ladspa but not sure that will do for you
2012-04-14T20:07:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	is it worth a try?
2012-04-14T20:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	if your into sound you should play with ladspa and jackd
2012-04-14T20:08:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	I just wanted a decent one for my mic to work and nicer music.
2012-04-14T20:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	you might want to see what other people have said about your sound card chips,  sudo lshw ;  and google the sound chip in linux
2012-04-14T20:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	other posibility is your mixer settings are just open on mic even when you play music but not likely
2012-04-14T20:13:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	it says to update drivers, but I already have the most up-to-date ones
2012-04-14T20:14:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	do you think it might be broken, it is a refurbished model.
2012-04-14T20:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	uptodate does not mean it works,  in linux new does not mean better
2012-04-14T20:16:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	to be honest there's not much in good on it that I can find. I think I might return it.
2012-04-14T20:20:00.000Z	ChrisWere	sacarlson	is there anything else you can suggest?
2012-04-14T20:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	ChrisWere	no I'm out of idea'a
