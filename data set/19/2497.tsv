2010-04-07T22:31:00.000Z	jbwiv		guys, I'm experiencing pretty regular complete system freezes on Karmic. even the magic sysrq buttons will not work. I've run memtest for over 24 hours, and it found no errors. What should I look at next?
2010-04-07T22:31:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	oh i see
2010-04-07T22:32:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	try passing a few parametrs to kernel on boot like nolapic apic=off and failsafe see if it helps
2010-04-07T22:32:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	there's a glitch in kernel
2010-04-07T22:33:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	 a known glitch
2010-04-07T22:34:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	you can upgrade to a newer or older kernel version, it helped me (both newer and older worked)
2010-04-07T22:34:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	i'm on the latest
2010-04-07T22:34:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	33?
2010-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	no, Linux pdesk 2.6.31-20-generic #58-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 12 04:38:19 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2010-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	latest from Karmic apt though
2010-04-07T22:36:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	i see, i would recommend installing an older version then, the one of 9.04 works
2010-04-07T22:36:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	how did you install 9.10? did you do a distro upgrade or a clean install?
2010-04-07T22:37:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	clean install
2010-04-07T22:37:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	so you don't have an older kernel to choose from...
2010-04-07T22:37:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	actually re-installed a few days ago, because I was trying to solve this issue by upgrading to Lucid beta, but had issues
2010-04-07T22:38:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	no, but of course I could probably install an older version
2010-04-07T22:38:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	memtest86 doesn't find any issue with the ram
2010-04-07T22:38:00.000Z	QueenZ	jbwiv	if you don't know how to install an older version of kernel you can install 9.04 and do a distro upgrade, then choose an older kernel from the grub menu
2010-04-07T22:39:00.000Z	jbwiv	QueenZ	it happened in the older kernels, so that probably won't help
