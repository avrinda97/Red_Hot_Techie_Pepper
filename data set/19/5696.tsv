2008-05-15T12:10:00.000Z	Saint`Dia`		How can I get my laptop volume buttons to adjust the master sound rather than turn up and down the Mic????????
2008-05-15T12:10:00.000Z	mohamed_	Saint`Dia`	rightclick on volume then properties
2008-05-15T12:12:00.000Z	Saint`Dia`	mohamed_	Nope.
2008-05-15T12:13:00.000Z	Saint`Dia`	mohamed_	No matter what I change, the keyboard layout and whatnot. It is dead set on only changing the mic.
2008-05-15T12:14:00.000Z	mohamed_	Saint`Dia`	 volume > properties >  select the device that u want to control , at this window you choose master volume
