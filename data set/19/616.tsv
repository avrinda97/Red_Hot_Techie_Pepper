2012-05-11T19:40:00.000Z	nina666		hi... i have ubuntu 12.04. the temperature gets really high.. i've already installed proprietary driver AMD and also i've followed this instruction: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/linux-kernel-power-issue-fix.html but still my laptop get so hot.. what should i do??
2012-05-11T19:42:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	check the system monitor to see if there are processes that are using a lot of resources, dropbox can be one of them as an example
2012-05-11T19:43:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	ok i check using $htop... a process "compiz" is using 50%++ of my cpu... :( what is that>
2012-05-11T19:45:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	(in lay mans terms) compiz is what gives you your graphics animations
2012-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	you mentioned that you have an AMD graphics card. Install compizconfig-settings-manager then head to OpenGL and uncheck 'Sync to VBlank'
2012-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	yea i just read about it just now... apparently is unity's bug... in here:http://www.tuxtrix.com/2011/05/workaround-for-compiz-eating-too-much.html is saying the more pc is on, the more is goes.. although this post is really talking about memory consumption, but my issue is really cpu...
2012-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	ok let me try, thx
2012-05-11T19:47:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	np
2012-05-11T19:52:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	installed... how should i reach for the OpenGL and unchecking the thing...?
2012-05-11T19:52:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	OpenGL is under General
2012-05-11T19:53:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	if you're having a hard time finding it, try searching for OpenGL in the filter
2012-05-11T19:54:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	did that, it only gave me the cairo-dock-openGL...and btw i see no General also...
2012-05-11T19:56:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	in compiz config manager (ccsm) what options do you see then?
2012-05-11T19:58:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	oh... my bad.. thought openGL has to be in the main settings! sry for that, ok now that i've run the program, i see General tab, several options with openGL ticked... so now...?
2012-05-11T19:59:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	click on OpenGL. Under that you'll see an option called Sync to VBlank. Make sure that's unchecked.
2012-05-11T20:01:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	wow thanks!!! it instantly decreased from 75% to 12% !!! what just happened...? what does that sync to VBlank do??
2012-05-11T20:02:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	I had the same issue as well. From what I understand, there were two engines running in the background. Removing the VBlank, stops them from "fighting" with each other.
2012-05-11T20:07:00.000Z	nina666	jon__	thanks alot anyways... :) for both solving my issue and the info.. ;)
2012-05-11T20:08:00.000Z	jon__	nina666	no problem
