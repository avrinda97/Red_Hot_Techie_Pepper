2012-06-03T06:30:00.000Z	clausen		(I could obviously extract the whole thing... but that's not so efficient)
2012-06-03T06:32:00.000Z	clausen		(and the order they were added)
2012-06-03T06:33:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	if you don't want them to be in order of time, you can always `finger` them.
2012-06-03T06:33:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	?
2012-06-03T06:34:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	you can alter files like that with finger.
2012-06-03T06:34:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	you mean touch(1) ?
2012-06-03T06:34:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	finger(1) is a networking program
2012-06-03T06:35:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	oh.  yes, sorry.  finger ... touch ... iget them mixed up sometimes.
2012-06-03T06:36:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	you have to use finger on the filesystem, not on the archive
2012-06-03T06:42:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	you could probably do it with a for loop and the --add-file option.  then again, you may look into the -m option.
2012-06-03T06:42:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	--add-file appends to the end?
2012-06-03T06:42:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	yes.
2012-06-03T06:43:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	then that's no good... I won't the history of the archive to be destroyed
2012-06-03T06:44:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	sounds like you need more than just a tarball for all of these security concerns.  maybe you're trying to use a hammer when you need a screwdriver?
2012-06-03T06:44:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	well, the tar format is fine
2012-06-03T06:45:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	I think I can wip up a program to merge tarballs in an hour...
2012-06-03T06:45:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	doing it now :)
2012-06-03T06:45:00.000Z	bwayne	clausen	you can do a simple merge of tarballs with --concatenate.
2012-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	clausen	bwayne	but that has the same problem
