2011-02-01T21:00:00.000Z	multiplatinum		how can i join a hidden wifi?
2011-02-01T21:01:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	if your wifi device is working, right click the network applet, choose "connect to hidden network" then fill in the network credentials
2011-02-01T21:01:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	sorry, that should be "left click" not right click
2011-02-01T21:01:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 done that, it doesnt connect me
2011-02-01T21:02:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	then it's very likely your wireless device is not working.. can you see other networks?
2011-02-01T21:02:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 yeah, tons
2011-02-01T21:02:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	well, you're doin something wrong
2011-02-01T21:02:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 after trying to connect like 5x, it shows the network, even tho i made it hidden
2011-02-01T21:02:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 what then,
2011-02-01T21:02:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	well  i don't know what, i'm nt pounding on the keyboard.
2011-02-01T21:07:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 if i use wcid, will that work?
2011-02-01T21:07:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	it might... but there really should be no need for wicd.. you really should be able to connect w/ network manager
2011-02-01T21:08:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 wicd is better anyway right?
2011-02-01T21:08:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	define "better".. it does the exact same thing as nm-applet
2011-02-01T21:09:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	if you can't connect w/ one... it's unlikely you'll connect the other.
2011-02-01T21:10:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	well log into the router, and set it to broadcast, and see if you can log in while its broadcasting...
2011-02-01T21:11:00.000Z	multiplatinum	KM0201	 that works
2011-02-01T21:11:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	you mean you can connect to it when its broadcasting?
2011-02-01T21:11:00.000Z	KM0201	multiplatinum	well then you're doing something wrong.
