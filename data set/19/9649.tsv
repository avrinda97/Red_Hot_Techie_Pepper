2007-09-26T12:24:00.000Z	Agent_bob		yeah could be bad cd.
2007-09-26T12:25:00.000Z	Agent_bob		anyone on "Floating point exception" ???
2007-09-26T12:26:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	that means it expected an integer but wasn't given one which led to segmentation fault
2007-09-26T12:27:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	makes perfect sense.    so why would lilo spew that out ?
2007-09-26T12:27:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	first off ubuntu uses grub and second off lilo probably was given jibbery crap where it expected a number in its config file
2007-09-26T12:28:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	does it give you a line in any files to check?
2007-09-26T12:28:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	the only output is that i quoted.
2007-09-26T12:28:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	try using updatedb and locate to find its config file then nano file.txt or whatever
2007-09-26T12:28:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	it  was working prefect then it just started spewing that every time it's ran
2007-09-26T12:29:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	the config is /etc/lilo.conf   and i wrote it.
2007-09-26T12:29:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	I had bad experiences with lilo before, I stay with grub
2007-09-26T12:29:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	maybe good advice,  and i would use grub if it were possable.  but grub can't boot a partitionless hd
2007-09-26T12:33:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	that's not so odd   seen it bunches.   just means that the kernel was trying some code that the ide bus didn't like.      if it hasn't caused preformance loss i wouldn't pay it any mind.
2007-09-26T12:33:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	it was spammed like hundreds of times
2007-09-26T12:34:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	I think it might lead to serious file system problems later
2007-09-26T12:34:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ronnie	oh you mean the kernel continues to do that.... that's not so good.
2007-09-26T12:36:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	I'm using a W3115 gateway computer, besides that I noticed in lshw it has several memory devices marked as unknown or unclaimed.
2007-09-26T12:37:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	i also turned off cpu frequency scaling daemon seeing as on shutdown I notice it kept going in background unable to scale the cpu. Its got 1ghz but its like 2ghz or so
2007-09-26T12:39:00.000Z	ronnie	Agent_bob	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38616/ perhaps its related to the hard drive?..
