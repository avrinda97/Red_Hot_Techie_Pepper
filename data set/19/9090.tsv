2009-07-21T05:57:00.000Z	andrew__		error pasting the error message
2009-07-21T05:57:00.000Z	andrew__		apparently cannot copy from terminal window
2009-07-21T05:58:00.000Z	andrew__		ok...here goes
2009-07-21T06:00:00.000Z	andrew__		I pasted it...can you see it?
2009-07-21T06:01:00.000Z	andrew__		can I paste in here?
2009-07-21T06:02:00.000Z	andrew__		I pasted there...can you see?
2009-07-21T06:02:00.000Z	arand	andrew__	you need to paste the link here for people  ;)
2009-07-21T06:04:00.000Z	andrew__		ok...sorry
2009-07-21T06:05:00.000Z	andrew__		http://paste.ubuntu.com/223153/
2009-07-21T06:07:00.000Z	andrew__		can you read the error I pasted?
2009-07-21T06:07:00.000Z	arand	andrew__	that error seems to say that either you have the wrong apt string for the repository, or that the server is currently down.
2009-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	andrew__		I have a sneaking suspicion that ubuntu has removed all references to beryl files...could not open the "how to install" page last night...should I continue with installation attempt...or abandon?
2009-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	andrew__		it did, but I had not known that until slart told me last night in here...now when I ran the apt-get instructions from ubuntu help for medibuntu...the script wanted to connect to beryl-project and couldn't
2009-07-21T06:11:00.000Z	andrew__		the same error message went on to say that the missing index files have been ignored or old ones were used...at this point do I continue with the installation, or abort?
2009-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	arand	andrew__	if you look at http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ you can see that there is no "dists" subfolder there, so I'd say your apt string is incorrect. Btw isn't beryl lost and gone as of compiz fusion?
2009-07-21T06:17:00.000Z	andrew__		yes it is, but the instructions I was told to use, found here: arrgh!  page won't load now!
2009-07-21T06:18:00.000Z	arand	andrew__	The "best before"-date may have passed on those instructions ;)
2009-07-21T06:19:00.000Z	andrew__	arand	 thanks...I needed a laugh...LOL
