2010-10-02T11:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	what do you mean 'downloaded through terminal'
2010-10-06T01:43:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	actually it's becase you're asking a windows question in an ubuntu channel
2010-10-06T01:43:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	it wasnt a windows question i asked for a UBUNTU virus scan so i wouldnt infect a windows computer with dorment virus
2010-10-11T04:33:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	that's your password?
2010-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	F11 should make firefox fullscreen.. or maybe it was F10
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	none of my functions make it full screen
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	in firefox go to view -> fullscreen (and it might have a hotkey listed)
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	 maybe my firefox isnt up to date because i dont have full screen under view option
2010-10-25T01:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	hmm, not sure then. what version is it?
2010-10-25T01:27:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	how do i find out what version?
2010-10-25T01:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	help - > about firefox (i think, don't have access to linux version atm)
2010-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	3.6.11
2010-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	that's the newest
2010-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	 any idea why i dont have a fullscreen option? do i need a plug in or something?
2010-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	Chaos2358	no it should be there, i really don't know why. i don't use ubuntu, maybe they applied a patch to change the behavior? you can ask someone else who has firefox to check if they have it
2010-10-25T01:31:00.000Z	Chaos2358	blakkheim	yes thats my question f11 doesnt work neither do any of the other fkeys even when paired with function
