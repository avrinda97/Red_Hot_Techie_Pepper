2008-03-05T12:30:00.000Z	Laughed		hey: During Install the base system phase, I get this "Warning: file:///cdrom/pool/main/u/udev/udev_113-0Ubuntu16_amd64.deb was corrupt
2008-03-05T12:30:00.000Z	Laughed		should I continue or go back
2008-03-05T12:31:00.000Z	Laughed		this isnt, but it si, my first attempt at an install failed later on
2008-03-05T12:33:00.000Z	Laughed		is there an easier, alternate way to install Ubuntu outside of the alternate version on the website
2008-03-05T12:33:00.000Z	Laughed		for something that is supposed to be easy this is becoming very problematic
2008-03-05T12:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	what's going on?
2008-03-08T16:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	i was about to ask that myself, since he responded to archer, who i can't see
2008-03-08T17:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	what's the problem?
2008-03-08T17:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	yes. i have seen those directions. they work for most people
2008-03-08T17:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	if i remember right, they involve editing two files
2008-03-08T17:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	let me find the directions and see, i have the link
2008-03-08T17:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	ah ok i was looking at this:  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Gutsy#Fix_Slow_boot.2Ffaulty_splash_screen
2008-03-08T17:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	yes
2008-03-08T17:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	check my link, it's more detailed and i think it's for the same problem
2008-03-08T17:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	i keep it around since your problem is pretty common. you probably have a laptop right?
2008-03-08T17:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	well, check it anyway. i think it may be what you want
2008-03-08T17:12:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	i don't know. i recall someone else had this issue, but i don't remember the fix. you can try a lower supported res, since it will only affect the boot process
2008-03-08T17:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	it will only affect the resolution while booting, i mean
2008-03-08T18:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Laughed	yeah
