2006-12-05T16:50:00.000Z	goose		i upgraded from ubuntu dapper to edgy but the 'show updates' function doesn't work it does nothing. any ideas?
2006-12-05T16:51:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	What about the repositories / sources.list ?
2006-12-05T16:51:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	all other functions of the update-manager work fine. like install updates
2006-12-05T16:52:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	it's just that i can't use show updates to see the updates
2006-12-05T16:52:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	Does it gives an error message?
2006-12-05T16:53:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	nothing. it just asks for a password like any other gksudo program and then does nothing
2006-12-05T16:53:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	if you can give me the command line for 'show updates' i can see if it results in any errors
2006-12-05T16:54:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	And you are sure the sources.list is ok?
2006-12-05T16:54:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	i don't know i haven't checked :\ i've been downloading updates without problems though
2006-12-05T16:54:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	sudo apt-get update
2006-12-05T16:55:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	should check all the updates.
2006-12-05T16:55:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	it complains of duplicate entries in sources.list
2006-12-05T16:56:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	You can try. Backup sources.list first... :)
2006-12-05T16:57:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	ok apparently it was one automatix line that created the duplicate entries
2006-12-05T16:58:00.000Z	SGersho1	goose	It is working fine now?
2006-12-05T16:58:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	well now it thinks a package manager is working but nothing appears to be running let me check ps
2006-12-05T17:00:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	nope it still isn't working. hovering notifies that there are 4 available updates. but show updates still doesn't do anything
2006-12-05T17:01:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	there are no other running package managers.
2006-12-06T17:12:00.000Z	goose	SGersho1	btw it still doesn't work :\
