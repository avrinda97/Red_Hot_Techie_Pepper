2007-06-06T06:52:00.000Z	rob_p	anto_	Unfortunately I don't have time to help you right now.  Too much going on at the moment.  However, perhaps in an hour or so I could get back to you. For now, if you can get eth2 to come up with the network settings in your interfaces file, simply follow the guide I posted and you'll have a NAT router up and running.  Good luck.  Gotta go...
