2009-03-19T06:52:00.000Z	shippo		does anyone know if a servername like TEST will resolve in fstab versus having to use the IP address for TEST of 10.10.0.1?
2009-03-19T06:52:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	it will if "TEST" is in the /etc/hosts file
2009-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	that makes me think that it would be a manual entry in a different file, is that correct?
2009-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	manual entry in /etc/hosts
2009-03-19T06:54:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	 I am looking for any automatic way to do that b/c my network gets reset a lot.
2009-03-19T06:54:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	do the ip's change?
2009-03-19T06:55:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	yes
2009-03-19T06:55:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	then you're stuck.. there's no automagick way of doing it.. unless  .. you're running a server and want to get at it right?
2009-03-19T06:56:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	darn, I was hoping I could do something, but I guess not
2009-03-19T06:56:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	you running a server that you're trying to get at?
2009-03-19T06:57:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	it is just another windows system running xp, not specifically a xp server version
2009-03-19T06:58:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	I would imagine if I was running a server then I could have a DNS service running on it to resolve the name to the ip address?
2009-03-19T06:58:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	or take the easy way out and use something like dydns
2009-03-19T06:59:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	 is there somewhere I can read up on dydns?
2009-03-19T06:59:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	yep.. www.dydns.org
2009-03-19T06:59:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	thanks for your assistance!
2009-03-19T07:00:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	np.. r00tintheb0x gave you another link as well.. never used that one.. but would be worth looking at. :)
2009-03-19T07:01:00.000Z	shippo	scunizi	 I guess another way would be to assign static ip address to the xp windows machine, right?
2009-03-19T07:03:00.000Z	scunizi	shippo	mine is scunizi.isa-geek.com
