2007-12-19T00:41:00.000Z	Storrgie		and i have never run SSH or mysql
2007-12-19T00:42:00.000Z	Storrgie		well anyone can use google, i was asking if you know of any good sources that you have used
2007-12-19T00:43:00.000Z	Storrgie		no didnt think so, but i was wondering if there was a decent comprehensive one
2007-12-19T00:45:00.000Z	Storrgie		with server the only interface is through terminal correct? no gui?
2007-12-19T00:46:00.000Z	Storrgie		i have it installed in VMware here
2007-12-19T00:47:00.000Z	Storrgie		and im in the terminal
2007-12-19T00:47:00.000Z	Storrgie		i would like to configure the SSH and web server
2007-12-19T00:47:00.000Z	Storrgie		but this is my first time in server and I am unfamiliar with the user interface
2007-12-19T00:48:00.000Z	Storrgie		i want to know what is configurable, i have never set up SSH and only done web through IIS
2007-12-19T00:49:00.000Z	Storrgie		but what about changing ports and anything else
2007-12-19T00:49:00.000Z	Pici	Storrgie	You want to change the port?
2007-12-19T00:49:00.000Z	Storrgie		i want to know what is configurable
2007-12-19T00:50:00.000Z	Storrgie		right now I am in terminal, how can I change the screen resolution?
2007-12-19T00:50:00.000Z	Pici	Storrgie	/etc/ssh/sshd_config
2007-12-19T00:50:00.000Z	Pici	Storrgie	er, for the ssh config stuff.
2007-12-19T00:50:00.000Z	Storrgie		yes
2007-12-19T00:51:00.000Z	Storrgie		yes its the first time with server, I have ran ubunut desktop and I can manage myself there because it has a user interface... using terminal though is hard because I get lost
2007-12-19T00:52:00.000Z	Storrgie	Pici	it tells me permission denied
2007-12-19T00:52:00.000Z	Pici	Storrgie	you'll need to edit it with sudo access...
