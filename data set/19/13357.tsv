2005-04-12T14:48:00.000Z	bob2`		yes
2005-04-12T14:48:00.000Z	bob2`		of course it does
2005-04-12T14:49:00.000Z	bob2`		sudo works around it by setting XAUTHORITY or something
2005-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	bob2`		and the list
2005-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	bob2`		or the forums if you're sure of what the person is saying
2005-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	bob2`		the mailing list, on http://lists.ubuntu.com/
2005-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	bob2`		no
2005-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	bob2`		I don't work on ubuntu, I just work for the same company
2005-04-12T14:52:00.000Z	cowbud	bob2`	ahh doing what?
2005-04-12T14:53:00.000Z	bob2`	cowbud	bazaar.canonical.com, baaaaybe
2005-04-12T14:53:00.000Z	cowbud	bob2`	ahh another revision control system?
2005-04-12T15:02:00.000Z	cowbud	bob2`	I am interesting in working on say ubuntu security is there a possiblity in getting started with that if so how would I go about that (yah you might not be the one to ask but you at least work for the company)
2005-04-12T15:03:00.000Z	bob2`	cowbud	hrm. what sort of security?  you'd need to be working on a distro to help with security updates, in most cases, but other stuff you can ask about on the ubuntu=-security list.
2005-04-12T15:04:00.000Z	cowbud	bob2`	well isn't there a ubuntu security team that watches out for security issues and tests patches etc?
2005-04-12T15:04:00.000Z	bob2`	cowbud	sure, but they'd be doing most of their stuf before the issue is publically known
2005-04-12T15:05:00.000Z	bob2`	cowbud	and you'd need to be on vendor-sec to help with that, but that would require already working on security for another distro
2005-04-12T15:05:00.000Z	cowbud	bob2`	so how could I start to get in to that area?
2005-04-12T15:08:00.000Z	bob2`	cowbud	I'd guess helping with universe security would be a good start, but #ubuntu-motu would know more about that
2005-04-12T15:08:00.000Z	cowbud	bob2`	cool thanks
