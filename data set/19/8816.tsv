2007-02-02T16:32:00.000Z	sockmonk		what version of ruby comes with ubuntu edgy?
2007-02-02T16:34:00.000Z	sockmonk		any edgy users here that happen to have ruby installed?
2007-02-02T16:34:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	1.8.2-1
2007-02-02T16:34:00.000Z	mthaddon		"sudo aptitude show ruby" is your friend
2007-02-02T16:35:00.000Z	sockmonk	mthaddon	1.8.2??  ok, thanks.
2007-02-02T16:35:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	yeah, looks that way
2007-02-02T16:35:00.000Z	sockmonk		I don't have ubuntu installed yet, still evaluating
2007-02-02T16:35:00.000Z	mthaddon		gotcha
2007-02-02T16:36:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	not too long til feisty is ready - would most likely have a more up to date version (I don't use ruby personally)
2007-02-02T16:36:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	if you can hang on til April
2007-02-02T16:37:00.000Z	sockmonk	mthaddon	is there a web site that would tell me what package versions are included in feisty?
2007-02-02T16:37:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	not that I'm aware of - let me have a quick look...
2007-02-02T16:40:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	you know, thinking about it, there won't be a page that shows that currently, as it'll depend on how testing goes as to which specific version makes it in there
2007-02-02T16:41:00.000Z	sockmonk		so I'd have to download a CD and see what's there
2007-02-02T16:41:00.000Z	sockmonk		makes sense not to make any premature promises... but I guess that means the version could be downgraded between now and final release
2007-02-02T16:42:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	doing a search on launchpad, it looks like feisty is 1.8.2-1
2007-02-02T16:42:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/feisty/i386/ruby/1.8.2-1 - this may change though...
2007-02-02T16:44:00.000Z	sockmonk	mthaddon	thanks for checking on that.
2007-02-02T16:44:00.000Z	mthaddon	sockmonk	np
