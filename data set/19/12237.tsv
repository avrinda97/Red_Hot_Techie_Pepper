2005-10-01T10:37:00.000Z	Crys_Win		Ubuntu runs wicked slow on my ppc. Is there something better?
2005-10-01T10:37:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	What ppc is it?
2005-10-01T10:38:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	It runs fine on a 350MHz iMac (grape) with 192Mb ram here
2005-10-01T10:38:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	Ditto on a 1.4GHz Mac mini with 1Gb RAM
2005-10-01T10:38:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	How much ram does it have?
2005-10-01T10:39:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	No flap? Howso? (We're talking blueberry, right?)
2005-10-01T10:39:00.000Z	Crys_Win	cafuego_	I think it has something like 64 or 128
2005-10-01T10:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	64 is the default on those, I think.  yes, 64 or 128 is a tad on the low side for Ubuntu with Gnome. Give something like say fluxbox or openbox  try, they use FAR less ram and should be far more responsive.
2005-10-01T10:41:00.000Z	Crys_Win	cafuego_	can I install that from synaptic?
2005-10-01T10:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	Yep.
2005-10-01T10:42:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	Soemthing that needs a bit more ram, but is also a bit more integrated, would be xfce4.
2005-10-01T10:42:00.000Z	Crys_Win	cafuego_	will it just start up in blackbox next boot, or iwll it give me a chance to pick?
2005-10-01T10:43:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	It will come up with gdm (just log out, no reboot required). Then pick 'blackbox' from the Sessions menu.
2005-10-01T10:44:00.000Z	Crys_Win	cafuego_	Thanks. I really like my bblean. Thnk I'll like openbox or fluxbox too?
2005-10-01T10:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	I'm used to Gnome, can't make up your mind for you ;-)
2005-10-01T10:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	Ack, 32Mb is the default, actually.
2005-10-01T10:46:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	I'd have a search on google, see how to open it and add ram, if you can get your hands on some. (SDRAM is dirt cheap)
2005-10-01T10:47:00.000Z	Crys_Win	cafuego_	I did that. BTW, it's sodimm for imacs.
2005-10-01T10:48:00.000Z	cafuego_	Crys_Win	yeah, just saw. I've got a rev C I think,  that just eats whever the Pentium 3 here had.
