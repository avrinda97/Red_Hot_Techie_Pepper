2009-02-05T11:43:00.000Z	dimension128		I have a P4 Cedar Mill Single-Core Processor. It has hyper threading.  /proc/cpuinfo shows it as if it were 2 physical cpu's. (processor : 0 and processor : 1). The "System Monitor" shows one 'thread' at almost 100% always, and the other at almost zero. Sometimes they switch around, and the graph itself is interesting to watch, as one 'cpu' goes down, the other goes up almost at the exact same rate. "top" is showing th
2009-02-05T11:43:00.000Z	dimension128		My question is,  Is this normal? Should one 'cpu/thread' on a single-core cpu always appear to be at 100% usage?
2009-02-05T11:44:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	For single threaded applications that is normal load behavior
2009-02-05T11:44:00.000Z	dimension128		ok
2009-02-05T11:49:00.000Z	dimension128	Circs	So how do I know what kind of load a process is really imposing on my machine? When top says something is using 80%CPU, does that mean I have 20% unused or 120%?  Or better yet, do you know of any place I can read up on this kind of stuff? I tried googling phrases like "Ubuntu Hyperthreading, always at 100%" But the results are pretty much useless.
2009-02-05T11:50:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	Hyperthreading doesn't mean you actually have two cpus, it only shows up like that, so when it says 80 used, you only have 20% free

2009-02-05T11:51:00.000Z	dimension128	Circs	thank you
2009-02-05T11:51:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	That should give you a good groundwork for understanding, but basically HTT is a way to combat the excessively long pipeline of the Netburst processor arch.
2009-02-05T11:52:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	If you have any questions after reading that just ask me and I'll explain
2009-02-05T12:03:00.000Z	dimension128	Circs	Interesting. So would I gain anything by compiling the kernel with some kind of options for my cpu? Or is the standard Ubuntu precompiled kernel already doing the best job that can be done?
2009-02-05T12:04:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	There is almost always something to be gained by compiling on your specific machine, but unless you spend a lot of time with multithreaded apps of multi tasking with high IO waits your performance won't increase by any measurable amount

2009-02-05T12:06:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	Did that answer your question?
2009-02-05T12:07:00.000Z	dimension128	Circs	Aye, ok. Its so nice to have a place to ask questions like this. You have been very helpful thank you.
2009-02-05T12:08:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	Not a problem. I actually have a workstation with a 3.8 P4 and I turned off hyperthreading for my purposes.
2009-02-05T12:09:00.000Z	dimension128	Circs	Does it really work better to turn it off when your running non ht apps? Did you see a noticeable performance gain?
2009-02-05T12:10:00.000Z	Circs	dimension128	Not really, but I kept getting strange errors when the load would climb and I'd try to use something else at the same time.
2009-02-05T12:11:00.000Z	dimension128	Circs	Well gotta get to bed. Thanks again.
