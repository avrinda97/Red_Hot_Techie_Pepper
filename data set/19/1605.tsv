2010-12-14T11:32:00.000Z	learningC		what is . (dot) for a shell?
2010-12-14T11:32:00.000Z	maco	learningC	current directory
2010-12-14T11:32:00.000Z	maco	learningC	oh, or "source"
2010-12-14T11:40:00.000Z	learningC	maco	Jordan_U: for example what are the differences between: .afile ./afile /afile
2010-12-14T11:40:00.000Z	maco	learningC	ahh ok
2010-12-14T11:41:00.000Z	maco	learningC	.afile is a hidden file in the current directory whose name starts with a dot
2010-12-14T11:41:00.000Z	maco	learningC	./afile is a file in the current directory whose name is simply "afile"
2010-12-14T11:41:00.000Z	maco	learningC	/afile is a file in the root of the filesystem hierarchy. starting with a / makes it an explicit path, rather than a relative one.       ./afile was relative to the current directory
2010-12-14T11:44:00.000Z	learningC	maco	can we just run afile
2010-12-14T11:44:00.000Z	maco	learningC	if it's executable, either giving it a direct path (so either relative or explicit, but not just its name unless the path to it is defined in $PATH), yes
2010-12-14T11:46:00.000Z	learningC	maco	if I put an executable file in desktop and I'm in desktop directory, if I just put the file name, would it work?
2010-12-14T11:47:00.000Z	maco	learningC	no, like i just said it has to be either a relative or explicit path
2010-12-14T11:48:00.000Z	maco	learningC	unless the directory is in the $PATH variable, which ~/Desktop is not
2010-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	maco	learningC	type "echo $PATH" real quick
2010-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	maco	learningC	windows *also* uses a $PATH
2010-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	maco	learningC	if it is in any of the directories that are listed when you type "echo $PATH" then just typing the name works
2010-12-14T11:50:00.000Z	maco	learningC	otherwise you do what mark_ is saying and give the path... that is, since it's in ~/Desktop and so are you, either:   ./afile   OR  ~/Desktop/afile   OR  /home/you/Desktop/afile
2010-12-14T12:09:00.000Z	maco	learningC	if you add . to the $PATH you can do that
2010-12-14T12:09:00.000Z	maco	learningC	i believe it's considered a bad idea in the security department though
