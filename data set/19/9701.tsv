2007-10-08T05:52:00.000Z	gokhan_		i installed apache2 but all the important files are under /var/www/apache2-default/ not under /var/www/ so when i type "http://127.0.0.1/" from a browser it shows me the dir of "/var/www/" so how can i fix it?
2007-10-08T05:53:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	change the "sererroot" directive in apache config
2007-10-08T05:59:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	its not empty, it includes other files
2007-10-08T06:00:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	but when i double click it i looks empty
2007-10-08T06:24:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	do you have svn installed ?
2007-10-08T06:25:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	no but subversion and svn are the same things right?
2007-10-08T06:25:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	subversion is the product, svn is the command
2007-10-08T06:27:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	well how do i install svn?
2007-10-08T06:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	subvserion is the package
2007-10-08T06:27:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	so it will do it
2007-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	yes, but why do you want the svn version ov django ?
2007-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	because it is the latest version of django
2007-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	its also unstable and may be buggy
2007-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	I'll ask again, why do you want the latest version
2007-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	more so if you can't figure out the tools you need to get it
2007-10-08T06:30:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	what is in the 0.6 version you want thats not in the 0.95 ?
2007-10-08T06:32:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	good question :) i don't know because i never used 0.95 i also have gentoo and i use 0.96 there
2007-10-08T06:32:00.000Z	gokhan_	ikonia	so i can't compare them
2007-10-08T06:32:00.000Z	ikonia	gokhan_	if you don't know why - don't do it, so use the ubuntu packaged version
