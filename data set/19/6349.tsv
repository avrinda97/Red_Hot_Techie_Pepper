2008-02-07T02:08:00.000Z	pepperjack	Dimitree	if its the gui and taskbar and stuff like that rm -fr ~/.g* will delete all your config files. youll lose any shortcuts etc you created just logoff and backin after doing that
2008-02-07T02:09:00.000Z	Dimitree	pepperjack	will this remove xorg.conf files and so on ?
2008-02-07T02:09:00.000Z	pepperjack	Dimitree	no just your profile stuff like in windows stuff under documents and settings for example
2008-02-07T02:09:00.000Z	pepperjack	Dimitree	horrible example on my part btw
2008-02-07T02:12:00.000Z	pepperjack	Dimitree	perhaps a sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a  <-- disclaimer is i have never done this
2008-02-07T02:12:00.000Z	Dimitree	pepperjack	ok trying that one now
2008-02-07T02:21:00.000Z	Dimitree	pepperjack	i reach a screen with " Please choose the font face you would like to use on Linux console." there is a OK at the bottom but i can't activate it with Enter or clicking on it ?
