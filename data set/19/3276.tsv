2011-11-30T22:11:00.000Z	kantlivelong		can anyone here recommend a good vnc client w/o the stupid connection gui?
2011-11-30T22:11:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	vncviewer?
2011-11-30T22:12:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	anything better? vncviewer always seems slow
2011-11-30T22:12:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Hm well I'm not into vnc... I mostly just use TeamViewer
2012-01-12T23:20:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	No. Mate is gnome2.
2012-01-12T23:21:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Mate is a gnome2 fork started by the ArchLinux team. Basically identical to gnome2. Cinnamon is a GNOME3 fork by the LinuxMint team. Made to make gnome3 friendlier.
2012-08-10T20:37:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Appears to be impossible. Either use Chromium or Oracle Java.
2012-08-10T20:38:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	i meant chromium srry :)
2012-08-10T20:38:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Huh. Then it's supposed to work just fine, just do a "sudo apt-get install icedtea-{6,7}-plugin"
2012-08-10T20:39:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	yeah.. thats what i figured.. its a no go.. i see icedtea erros in chrome stdout/err. both 6 and 7 do the same
2012-08-10T20:41:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Hm... Java works in Firefox but not Chrome/Chromium for me :/
2012-08-10T20:41:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	chromium bug then maybe?
2012-08-10T20:42:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	I'd assume so.
2012-08-10T20:46:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	can u do me a fav and post the stdout/err u get from chromium? i cant access the PC having the issue at the moment and cant find the same err
2012-08-10T20:46:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Alright, give me a second
2012-08-10T20:46:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	appreciate it
2012-08-10T20:47:00.000Z	kantlivelong	theadmin	i think i found a report @ ubuntu.. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/icedtea-web/+bug/1031857
2012-08-10T20:49:00.000Z	theadmin	kantlivelong	Well, here's what I get: http://hastebin.com/jowelikuci.txt
