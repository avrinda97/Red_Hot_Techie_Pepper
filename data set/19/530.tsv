2012-01-12T10:28:00.000Z	wingless2434		I've Googled about GVFS, but haven't found much useful info.  In one sentence, can someone sum up why I, a normal desktop end-user, would want GVFS on my system?  as far as I can tell it only exists to frustrate commands that fail to read it
2012-01-12T10:30:00.000Z	wingless2434		case in point: the .gvfs file in my home directory: wtf is it and why should i want it?
2012-01-12T10:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	you would use gvfs if you kept a mirror of a remote drive locally, .gvfs would be the place where it sat
2012-01-12T10:30:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	nitinab, is it some kind of network file system protocol?
2012-01-12T10:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	long story short, you cant get rid of it, nautilus depends on it,
2012-01-12T10:32:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	nitinab: I suppose that's useful.  But why is it integral to GNOME?  Seems really weird to be integrated into the GUI layer...
2012-01-12T10:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	if you can pull nautilus from gnome you wont have gvfs anymore, you wont have nautilus either
2012-01-12T10:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	why the fixation on gvfs?
2012-01-12T10:33:00.000Z	wingless2434		can you use this GVFS stuff without using nautilus...? e.g. if i were to log into my machine remotely via ssh and didn't start up a windows session
2012-01-12T10:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	yes
2012-01-12T10:34:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	it's just puzzled me and i haven't been able to understand it from preliminary googling.  where can i find more info on the topic?
2012-01-12T10:35:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	I don't undersatnd why something like GVFS would be wanted if we already have NFS
2012-01-12T10:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	you are looking at gvfs with out a 'use' for it, you got a networked house? more than one pc ?
2012-01-12T10:40:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	sorry, important phone call came in.  I'm on a one PC home system, so I have no need to network stuff right now.
2012-01-12T10:41:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	I think that's probably teh issue - i don't have the problems it's trying to fix, but i'm still curious
2012-01-12T10:42:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	have a network outside the home you want to connect to?
2012-01-12T10:43:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	i don't, no
2012-01-12T10:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	wingless2434	stop fixating?
2012-01-12T10:44:00.000Z	wingless2434	almoxarife	probably the best solution for now.  i'll revisit it later if i need to.  thanks!
