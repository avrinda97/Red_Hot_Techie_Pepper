2009-11-02T05:45:00.000Z	Manifest1		How can I revert back to Jaunty?
2009-11-02T05:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	reinstall jaunty
2009-11-02T05:46:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	How?
2009-11-02T05:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	download a livecd or alternate cd for it and install from there
2009-11-02T05:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	exactly
2009-11-02T05:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	downgrades are not supported
2009-11-02T05:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	however, if you do stick with 9.10, it will gradually become more stable as bug fixes are sent to the repos
2009-11-02T05:47:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	Wonderful....this has got to be the shittiest OS ever. Karmic was in beta for a f****** month and it still has f****** bugs
2009-11-02T05:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	almost every ubuntu release was like that when it was first released
2009-11-02T05:48:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	The current bugs dont let me use the f******* thing
2009-11-02T05:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	were you using compiz?
2009-11-02T05:49:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	WAS, yes, not anymore
2009-11-02T05:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	do you still have that issue when using metacity instead of compiz?
2009-11-02T05:50:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	All issues are gone, just can't use compiz, which SUCKS, because I NEED compiz
2009-11-02T05:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	why do you need it?
2009-11-02T05:50:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	so AWN can run, and also so I can have the decent effects
2009-11-02T05:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	have you filed a bug report on launchpad about your issue with compiz?
2009-11-02T05:51:00.000Z	Manifest1	lstarnes	no i have not
2009-11-02T05:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	Manifest1	you might want to file one so that the developers know nthat you have a severe issue that needs fixing
