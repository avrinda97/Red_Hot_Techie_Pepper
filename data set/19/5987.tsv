2009-08-25T13:02:00.000Z	mikey		i need help
2009-08-25T13:03:00.000Z	mikey		i need help with  my wireless broadcom for ubuntu
2009-08-25T13:04:00.000Z	mikey		i had widows xp running
2009-08-25T13:04:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	if your wifi is broadcom as your lshw said (google said otherwise), you need to get the laptop on a WIRED connection... then go to a TERMINAL window and type -->  sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter  -  then go to system/administration/hardware drivers, select the new broadcom driver, and enable it, then reboot - done.
2009-08-25T13:17:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	HP Pavilion dv6000 has a SOFTWARE wifi manager... that software has the ability to turn the wifi HARDWARE on and off... IF that setting is turned to OFF before you installed ubuntu... you stand a 50/50 chance of being able to turn it back on without reinstalling windows and enabling it thru the manufacturer's software
2009-08-25T13:18:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	there is a program for linux that has the capability to turn that hardware on/off similar to the default windows software, but it only works on about half of the laptops out there... let me try and google the name of it
2009-08-25T13:21:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	listen to Parsnip first... you have to install the correct driver before you can worry about whether or not that windows software has it disabled on you
2009-08-25T13:23:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	rather than pastebinning it... you can just do "lshw -C network", then look for the one that's related to wifi... and you're looking for a line similar to this one --> description : Wireless Interface / product: AR2413 802.11bg NIC <-- then just type that line in here for us
2009-08-25T13:23:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	the product line is the one that has your exact model info that we need to determine correct driver
2009-08-25T13:25:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	please re-read my last line to you.
2009-08-25T13:26:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	applications, accessories, terminal, "lshw -C network", find line similar to --> description : Wireless Interface / product: AR2413 802.11bg NIC <-- and tell us the PRODUCT line
2009-08-25T13:29:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	all that's listed there is your wired ethernet port, nothing mentioned about wifi
2009-08-25T13:31:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	it's either a switch on/off, or it's a key combination like Fn+F2
2009-08-25T13:31:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	"not sure" and "i think" are not valid answers... find it.
2009-08-25T13:32:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	the built in wireless has a SWITCH to turn it on or off
2009-08-25T13:32:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	regrettably you must had your wifi disabled the last time you shut windows down... so that wifi is semi-permanately disabled by the windows software (that controls the hardware on/off status)... I'm having trouble locating the linux program that tries to do what the windows program does... wait a few more minutes while I keep googling for it.
2009-08-25T13:36:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	please paste the output of these 2 commands --> "sysctl dev.wifi0.ledpin" and "sysctl dev.wifi0.softled"
2009-08-25T13:41:00.000Z	SanitariuM	mikey	the wifi on your computer needs the b43-fwcutter package in order to work... you need to start with that as instructed earlier (ctrl+f and search for "fwcutter")... i'm going to bed
