2012-06-11T05:56:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	Sorry about taking forever; I'm multitasking. And yes.
2012-06-11T05:57:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	I botched a previous install, and need to delete the partition it created.
2012-06-11T05:58:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	ok, why do you need to manually remove it? You can re-organize/modify partitions inside the installer.
2012-06-11T05:59:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	The delete option inside the installer didn't work.
2012-06-11T06:00:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	ahh ok,  well was my guess abuot the partitions being an extended and swap correct. Also please tell me you backed up everything ;)(had to ask)
2012-06-11T06:01:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	Yeah, I used Macrium Reflect. I'm backed up :)
2012-06-11T06:01:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	So any ideas as to why I can't unmount it?
2012-06-11T06:02:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	am I correct in guessing those partitions are a logical and swap partition inside it?
2012-06-11T06:03:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	All I know is that they are inside(?) /dev/sda4
2012-06-11T06:03:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	Oh, yes, one is a swap file. The other says "ext4"
2012-06-11T06:04:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	ok if the swap partition is at leat approx. equal to your ram you can leave it, and tell the installer to use it as swap during setup.
2012-06-11T06:04:00.000Z	wylde_		least*
2012-06-11T06:05:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	I don't know how do do that :?
2012-06-11T06:08:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	ahh ok. I get a little squeemish about telling people to delete partitions and whatnot heh. Is this going to be a dual boot system? Or just Ubuntu.
2012-06-11T06:08:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	Dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 7.
2012-06-11T06:10:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	ok so you have (correct me if I am wrong) A windows (NTFS) partition and the ext4 and swap partition? You want to delete the ext4 and swappartitions.
2012-06-11T06:11:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	A failed Ubuntu install left me with a broken 50gig partition, sda4, which contains sda5(ext4), and sda6(swap). I want to delete ALL of it.
2012-06-11T06:13:00.000Z	wylde_	Coyote	ok you have to remove the partitions inside sda4 first before you can remove sda4(since I'm guessing that's the extended partition) then you should be able to remove sda4
2012-06-11T06:13:00.000Z	Coyote	wylde_	Elaborate, please.
