2005-07-03T14:28:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	turn off the computer and go to the pub and take many beers and than go sleeps
2005-07-03T14:28:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	its simple
2005-07-03T14:29:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	so you must take big hammer and destroy whole pc and than you can go to the pub...
2005-07-03T14:29:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	certain with clear mind
2005-07-03T14:30:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	ubuntu is new distro and have lot of bugs...
2005-07-03T14:30:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	because it composited from many other distros..
2005-07-03T15:01:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	you must have autocreated backup like menu.lst~
2005-07-03T15:01:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	have you typed update-grub?
2005-07-03T15:02:00.000Z	korCZiz	d4rksh4de	update-grub automatic prepares your /boot/grub/menu.lst and ALWAYS is working..
