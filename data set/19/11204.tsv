2006-08-12T08:02:00.000Z	sharms	Jessehk	you need to include more information, like your gdm.conf and your gnome script that sets up the xgl variables.

2006-08-12T08:06:00.000Z	sharms	Jessehk	if you followed the thread, it would be working.  Didn't that occur to you?
2006-08-12T08:07:00.000Z	sharms	Jessehk	In the time you wasted justifying why you shouldn't post what I asked, you could have just posted what I ask.  Good luck.
2006-08-12T08:18:00.000Z	sharms	Jessehk	how do you expect to get help, if I ask you to post some configuration files and scripts and you refuse, yet in your thread you say: "If any more information would be useful in solving this problem, please let me know. I would would be happy to provide it. "
2006-08-12T08:19:00.000Z	Jessehk	sharms	where should I post it?

2006-08-12T08:34:00.000Z	Jessehk	sharms	thanks for the help, and I apologise for earlier. I might have just found the solution. I'll let you know in a sec.
2006-08-12T08:34:00.000Z	sharms	Jessehk	also if you are on AMD64 then gset-compiz doesn't exist
2006-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	Jessehk	sharms	just fixed it, and I feel stupid. One has to manually add things to the list. I did, and it's working. Thanks again. :)
