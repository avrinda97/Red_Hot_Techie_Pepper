2009-04-27T18:38:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	no go :(
2009-04-27T18:39:00.000Z	scunizi	beeman_nl	did you "fresh install"? and did you manually partition?
2009-04-27T18:39:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	it is a 500GB USB disk, 1 ext3 partition
2009-04-27T18:39:00.000Z	scunizi	beeman_nl	what the output from sudo fdisk -l
2009-04-27T18:39:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	1 sec :)
2009-04-27T18:40:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	from that device it is this: /dev/sdb1               1       60801   488384001   83  Linux
2009-04-27T18:40:00.000Z	scunizi	beeman_nl	pastebin the whole output
2009-04-27T18:41:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	this is it: http://pastebin.com/dc45ca6a
2009-04-27T18:42:00.000Z	scunizi	beeman_nl	so both sda1 and sdb1 are pretty big.. which hold your /home?
2009-04-27T18:43:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	/home is not a seperate mount, just a dir in /dev/sda1  , the disk that is causing the problems is /dev/sdb1 , mounted on /media/disk/
2009-04-27T18:45:00.000Z	scunizi	beeman_nl	I'm going to have to defer to those more knowledgable.. at this point I'm stuck
2009-04-27T18:45:00.000Z	beeman_nl	scunizi	thanks for your help :)
2009-04-27T18:47:00.000Z	scunizi	beeman_nl	good luck with that..
