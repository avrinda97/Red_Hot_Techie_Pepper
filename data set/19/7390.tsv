2007-09-01T09:19:00.000Z	WinXpNewb		Can anyone help with ntsf-fix? Where is it located? Installed something that required restart while external hd and pen drive is inserted and restarted and now can't mount ntfs external hd. Something about using ntfs-fix error message came up
2007-09-01T09:19:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	it's in the ntfs-progs package
2007-09-01T09:20:00.000Z	WinXpNewb	astro76	how do I open it? I think I already have it installed but can't locate it anywhere
2007-09-01T09:21:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	it's run from the command line
2007-09-01T09:22:00.000Z	WinXpNewb	astro76	what's the command I have to type? Ntfsfix?
2007-09-01T09:22:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	it's ntfs-fix, but first you need to know what device is your ntfs partition and it needs to be unmounted
2007-09-01T09:24:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	is it mounted now?
2007-09-01T09:24:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	i.e. can you read files from it, see what's in it..
2007-09-01T09:25:00.000Z	WinXpNewb	astro76	don't think so. That's what's written on the error. Can't mount
2007-09-01T09:26:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	paste the whole error on pastebin
2007-09-01T09:27:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	doesn't matter
2007-09-01T09:28:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	where is it, in a terminal?
2007-09-01T09:30:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	should be able to select and ctrl+c copy it, or just select it and middle-click in a terminal... But this channel is for Ubuntu support
2007-09-01T09:37:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	it would be best to try to boot into windows and disk check there first
2007-09-01T09:38:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	if not, sudo ntfs-fix /dev/sdc1
2007-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	if you want your user to be able to write to the whole drive, then do: sudo chown -R <user>:<user> /media/<mountpoint>
2007-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	replace <user> with your user name...
2007-09-23T08:37:00.000Z	astro76	WinXpNewb	yeah
2007-09-23T08:38:00.000Z	WinXpNewb	astro76	I think it changed ownership because a string of commands pop out when i typed the command but it's still read only
