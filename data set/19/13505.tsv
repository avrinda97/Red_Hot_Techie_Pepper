2005-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jan_		I now have the nvidia driver.
2005-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jan_		First it asked for something called cc
2005-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jan_		so I said "apt=get install gcc" and it satisfied that
2005-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jan_		then it wanted "make"
2005-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jan_		So, I installed that.
2005-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jan_		NOw it wants kernel source tree. Which I can't find out how to satisfy.
2005-10-01T06:32:00.000Z	Jan_		Ideas?
2005-10-01T06:32:00.000Z	Jan_		I'm not, I'm running the .run file
2005-10-01T06:32:00.000Z	Jan_		It can't find a kernel interface, or something.
2005-10-01T06:32:00.000Z	Jan_		Because this laptop has nvidia graphics hardwarE?
2005-10-01T06:32:00.000Z	cafuego_	Jan_	Why don't you just use the prepackaged ubuntu driver?
2005-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	Jan_		cafuego: I have a prepackaged ubuntu driver?
2005-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	Jan_		How do I use it? Am I using it?
2005-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	cafuego_	Jan_	Yep, it's in 'linux-restricted-modules-KERNELVERSION'
2005-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	Jan_		And if I am using it, why is DVD playback sluggish in exactly the same way it was under red hat before we installed the nvidia driver?
2005-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	Jan_		It's in what?
2005-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	cafuego_	Jan_	because dvd playback is not a function of gfx card.
2005-10-01T06:34:00.000Z	Jan_	durt	What? What are you talking about, and in what context?
2005-10-01T06:35:00.000Z	cafuego_	Jan_	 if DVD playback is chpooy, the driver most likely has problems moving data fast enough. That cna nomally be tuned by enabling DMA on the drive with 'hdparm'.
