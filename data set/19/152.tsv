2012-08-08T11:56:00.000Z	canadians1ssy		Hello! I'm having trouble installing the Berg manager
2012-08-08T11:57:00.000Z	canadians1ssy		Burg Manager rather http://www.sourceslist.eu/blog/linux-blog/burg-manager-installing-and-configuring-burg-has-never-been-so-easy/
2012-08-08T11:57:00.000Z	canadians1ssy		Has anyone here successfully installed Burg on their PC?
2012-08-08T11:58:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	I did, no trouble
2012-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	canadians1ssy	elgaton	Will it work even though I'm already using grub to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu?
2012-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	if you install BURG, it will replace GRUB even on the MBR.
2012-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	canadians1ssy	elgaton	MBR? please speak simply I'm a n00b
2012-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	canadians1ssy		I just installed ubuntu a few hours ago
2012-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	BURG will replace GUB completely, in other terms.
2012-08-08T12:02:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	I just had to do a little tweak to use BURG though. What is the problem you're experiencing?
2012-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	canadians1ssy	elgaton	just trying to figure out how to install it...
2012-08-08T12:04:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	OK, open a terminal (it's among your applications)
2012-08-08T12:05:00.000Z	canadians1ssy	elgaton	wait, sorry, i'm installing updates so I'll just have to try again later. whoops sorry to waste your time
2012-08-08T12:06:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	OK, I'll wait
2012-08-08T12:06:00.000Z	canadians1ssy		I'm on a pretty slow connection so I might not be able to do it tonight :P
2012-08-08T12:08:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	OK, I'll write the instructions and give you a link
2012-08-08T12:09:00.000Z	canadians1ssy	elgaton	chuck sent me this: http://www.unixmen.com/how-to-install-burg-in-ubuntu/
2012-08-08T12:12:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	OK, right, there is just another tweak to make to let BURG update automatically when you install a new kernel
2012-08-08T12:12:00.000Z	elgaton	canadians1ssy	I'll send an e-mail to the BURG packager to take care of it
