2008-01-31T03:44:00.000Z	Talon		WoW! i really like this Ubuntu so far :D im glad i installed it.
2008-01-31T03:45:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	glad to hear it
2008-01-31T03:45:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	you will _inevidably_ run into some problems, though ;)
2008-01-31T05:34:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	that's compiz
2008-01-31T05:35:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	correct, read the links above
2008-01-31T07:31:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	you have to install the extras, h/o I'll find the package for you
2008-01-31T07:32:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	compiz-fusion-plugins-extra and compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-01-31T07:32:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	there's literally more options in there than I wish to count
2008-01-31T07:33:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	at some point you're gonna wind up mapping your mouse3 button to something, and your scroll wheel is going to stop working... just keep that in mind when you're wondering why you can't scroll in firefox, and then go back and unmap mouse3 ;)
2008-01-31T07:33:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	_everyone_ I know has done that
2008-01-31T07:35:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	you can map any button on your mouse to pretty much anything you want...might take some doing though
2008-01-31T07:43:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	no, what's up?
2008-01-31T07:44:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	you've got compiz running already?
2008-01-31T07:44:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	try prefs - appearances - visual effects - custom
2008-01-31T07:46:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	the Appearances control panel, visual effects tab
2008-01-31T07:46:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	enable Custom
2008-01-31T07:47:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	I had that same problem, I don't remember how I fixed it to be honest
2008-01-31T07:47:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	mess with it enough and it's bound to kick in
2008-01-31T07:54:00.000Z	nemilar	Talon	haha, you might consider installing some temperature sensors
