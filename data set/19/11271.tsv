2006-02-27T10:33:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	blasted usb more like ;)
2006-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	what do you mean, 'empty'? unpartitioned?
2006-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	I just erased it
2006-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	you can't mount it unless it has a filesystem on it
2006-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	can't I create one directly from the live cd?
2006-06-04T10:11:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	you should be - do you want to partition it, or use the entire device as one filesystem?
2006-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	I wanna use the entire device as a filesystem
2006-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	I wanna install Dapper on it but it won't work
2006-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	could I use the 5.10 live cd to install the 6.06 directly on the disk?
2006-06-04T10:13:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	doubt it - you could just install 5.10 and then dist-upgrade
2006-06-04T10:13:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	wanted to do a clean install
2006-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	why, is dist-upgrade b0rken?
2006-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	I haven't tried it yet, but I like clean installs better, I find it more reliable
2006-06-04T10:18:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	so how do I upgrade it?
2006-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	amphi	Bladedge	iinstall 5.10, change the sources.list, apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade (and hope for the best ;)
2006-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	I got the cd, I don't wanna redownload 700megs
2006-06-04T10:21:00.000Z	Bladedge	amphi	brb, I'll install Breezy :)
