2005-10-24T09:37:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 you wouldn't probably say that if you had a console-only machine
2005-10-24T09:33:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 why bother with X, there are like 400 console-based and ncurses apps that do that
2005-10-24T09:35:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	well the console has its charms but some stuff are made to be graphical. cd burners and rippers are but one example where i preffer the gui over command line...
2005-10-24T09:36:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 not the command line!  ncurses makes quite a capable frontend
2005-10-24T09:37:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	ncurses are fine for some stuff. but not all. i use ncurses for bt and most config stuff, but my fav burner is still graveman
2005-10-24T09:37:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	lol, THAT you are perfectly right about!
2005-10-24T09:38:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 my secondary machine (currently running gentoo) is a 166mhz P1 with 75MB of RAM... X will never run on that machine
2005-10-24T09:39:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 its saving grace is that it has no ATA devices but the CD-RW/DVD-ROM combo drive... I plan to make it a videolan server and networked CD burning machine
2005-10-24T09:39:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	X runs fine here on slow hardware, but gnome and kde is banned! i used to run DSL on a 64mb, 500mhz spare pc :)
2005-10-24T09:39:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	neat
2005-10-24T09:40:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 right now I'm second-guessing my decision to go gentoo on it though... ncurses takes FOREVER to emerge
2005-10-24T09:40:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	best distro for low performance pc i've ever tried is slackware
2005-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 You wouldn't say that if you'd ever tried to install it onto a software raid, and with some other filesystem than ext2/3 or reiser
2005-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	can't you install ncurses binaries instead in gentoo?
2005-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	ah, never tried software raid with slack
2005-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 sadly, gentoo is built as a source-based distro... it's somewhat crippled in that respect
2005-10-24T09:42:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	freebsd gives you option to either compile or install binaries. somehow i thought gentoo had that option as well. damn
2005-10-24T09:42:00.000Z	abydos	Jowi	 and there are a couple 2.6 features that I find I cannot live without...  ATAPI burning... XFS/JFS support...
2005-10-24T09:43:00.000Z	Jowi	abydos	2.6 work well on hardware that old otherwise?
