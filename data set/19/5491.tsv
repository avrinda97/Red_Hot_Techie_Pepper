2008-07-14T14:30:00.000Z	newb		my Intel 945G graphics chipset isn't working with Hardy. anyone know how to solve this? i was going through /var/Xorg.0.log.old and I found this message which was weird: (II) [drm] loaded kernel module for "i915" driver.
2008-07-14T14:30:00.000Z	newb		it should load a i945 driver if i'm not mistaken?
2008-07-14T14:32:00.000Z	newb		oh i checked there is only an i915 driver :(
2008-07-14T14:33:00.000Z	__ryan__	newb	the 915 driver is also for the 945, it's actually all under the '810' driver
2008-07-14T14:35:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	but it still crashes infact earlier a few days back this problem was solved after i removed the i810 package from my system. but now again the same problem resurfaced. it just hangs or gives PATHETIC performance which wasn't happening earlier under Gutsy
2008-07-14T14:35:00.000Z	__ryan__	newb	 which xorg package do you have installed?
2008-07-14T14:35:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	wait i'll tell u
2008-07-14T14:36:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	xserver-xorg-video-intel
2008-07-14T14:36:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	i had removed the i810 package a few days earlier and this entire issue was resolved
2008-07-14T14:38:00.000Z	__ryan__	newb	 want my xorg.conf ?
2008-07-14T14:38:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	ok... from where can i get it?
2008-07-14T14:40:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	any resolution to this problem? :)
2008-07-14T14:41:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	suggestions?
2008-07-14T14:41:00.000Z	__ryan__	newb	 hold up
2008-07-14T14:42:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	my xorg.conf doesn't even list the video device being used it just says "Configured Video Device" instead of the usual "Intel Inegrated Blah blah Accelerator"
2008-07-14T14:44:00.000Z	__ryan__	newb	 http://pastebin.ca/1071627
2008-07-14T14:46:00.000Z	__ryan__	newb	 so  xserver-xorg-video-i810 and xserver-xorg-video-intel both failed for you?
2008-07-14T14:46:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	minus the synaptics touch pad part... i think i'll just modify the file and see if it works
2008-07-14T14:47:00.000Z	newb	__ryan__	yes both have managed to crash.
