2006-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	dibblego		where do I start looking to remotely access my headless Ubuntu machine?
2006-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	ssh or vnc ?
2006-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	dibblego	slackern	I'm hoping for a display of some kind
2006-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	System->Preferences->Remote Desktop
2006-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	then use a vnc client like tightvnc to access it.
2006-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	you might want to uncheck "ask you for permission" since you can't click it when running headless.
2006-05-18T09:39:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	your welcome.
2006-05-18T09:51:00.000Z	dibblego	slackern	when I reboot the machine, the VNC server has not started - can it be started automatically?
2006-05-18T09:51:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	oh it isn't started? hmm i'll have to look into that.
2006-05-18T09:52:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	have only used it shortly myself.
2006-05-18T09:52:00.000Z	dibblego	slackern	any ideas of where to look?
2006-05-18T09:52:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	i'm heading for the forums to look :)
2006-05-18T09:53:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	here is another approach to it  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=122402&highlight=remote+desktop+reboot
2006-05-18T09:55:00.000Z	dibblego	slackern	cheers, I'll give it a go
2006-05-18T09:55:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=158206&highlight=remote+desktop+reboot someone with same problem as you
2006-05-18T09:58:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	aye it seems like the best idea i think, or otherwise there seems to be something called freenx which does about the same thing.
2006-05-18T09:59:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	did you use the livecd installer?
2006-05-18T09:59:00.000Z	dibblego	slackern	I believe I did
2006-05-18T10:00:00.000Z	slackern	dibblego	ahh nice, i had some problems when i tried it so haven't tried them in a while now.
