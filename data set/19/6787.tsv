2012-01-26T14:55:00.000Z	aBound		Is there anyway to view a list of commands inside the terminal?
2012-01-26T14:56:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	well...
2012-01-26T14:56:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	not really. ls -l /bin/, ls -l /usr/bin/ at least will give you something to play with. :-)
2012-01-26T14:57:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	Yeah I kinda figured that directory would only give me a few bits. Oh well.
2012-01-26T15:02:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	iceroot, [[thufir]] , zykotick9 edheldil, thankies. :P
2012-01-26T15:02:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	tab is handy, yes. completes all kinds of things. paths and filenames too
2012-01-26T15:03:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	tab completes if only one thing matches, tab tab gives a list of matches if there's more than one
2012-01-26T15:03:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	Indeed I been in the Linux world years ago but forgot all to use all the nifty stuff.
2012-01-26T15:05:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	Always good to have a list of commands available if you intend to write shell scripts. :)
2012-01-26T15:06:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	the list would be just too big..
2012-01-26T15:06:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	No kidding right but there are some treasures to be found.
2012-01-26T15:07:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	awk, sed, cut and grep will get you far. :-)
2012-01-26T15:13:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	there's a few bash shell scripting guides out there too. some are quite good.
2012-01-26T15:13:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	with lots of neat little tricks.
2012-01-26T15:14:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	it's nice to have a general idea of what's possible with the builtin commands. many things are. :)
2012-01-26T15:14:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	I looked at some tutorials but I just didn't like the way it was conformed.
2012-01-28T05:18:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	hey. :P
2012-01-28T05:19:00.000Z	_NiC	aBound	:)
2012-01-28T05:22:00.000Z	aBound	_NiC	Should be able to check from the terminal command: lspci
