2008-09-18T00:43:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	audio device problems. as for the call being dropped,i've noticed that it's not related to linux
2008-09-18T00:43:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	experiment with different audio devices for your sound out setting
2008-09-18T00:44:00.000Z	Cheeky	daklan_schl	i did .. but alli see is sometyhing new ..like hd0 w intel some wierd stuff like that
2008-09-18T00:44:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	try setting it as "default". then try each of the devices listed until you get it right
2008-09-18T00:52:00.000Z	Cheeky	daklan_schl	did you get my last message about the hdo interl device
2008-09-18T00:52:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	sorry, missed it

2008-09-18T00:54:00.000Z	Cheeky	daklan_schl	i have something call hda intel.. like 4 diffrent kinds in my input is that wat i have to  change ?

2008-09-18T00:54:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	you have onboard intel sound?
2008-09-18T00:55:00.000Z	Cheeky	daklan_schl	yeah i do .. you thinks thats the problem?
2008-09-18T00:55:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	that means you have to figure out which device out of those four belongs to input
2008-09-18T00:56:00.000Z	Cheeky	daklan_schl	is there a way i could do that ?
2008-09-18T00:57:00.000Z	daklan_schl	Cheeky	test one by one is probably the next best solution
2008-09-18T00:57:00.000Z	Cheeky	daklan_schl	cant i figure it outr ... by check my something in cpu info or somehing instead of doing it manually ?
