2009-05-15T13:17:00.000Z	v4us		I have a problem with laptop_mode. It doesn't rerun after sleep and prolly in boot state. I changesd /etc/default/acpi-support but it doens't helps. It seems like i should change acpid settings, but i cannot find it Any idea?
2009-05-15T13:19:00.000Z	mg_	v4us	sorry dude, i am trying...i love ubuntu
