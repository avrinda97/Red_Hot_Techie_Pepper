2006-03-18T08:45:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe		whats the location of the default ppp connect scripts?
2006-03-18T08:46:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe		im used to RH, with ifup/ifdown
2006-03-18T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	/etc/ppp & /etc/chatscripts
2006-03-18T08:46:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe	nickrud	k thanks...
2006-03-18T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	it's reall standard, pppconfig is the tool for setting up modems in ubuntu
2006-03-18T08:47:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe	nickrud	the problem i have is that pppconfig doesnt acquire DNS servers correctly when connecting, but "pon ppp0" does.
2006-03-18T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	pon/poff uses the configs that pppconfig makes
2006-03-18T08:48:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe	nickrud	I also need to permanently change default MTU for ppp0
2006-03-18T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	/etc/ppp/options option mtu I think
2006-03-18T08:50:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	ppp was the very first task I tackled in linux, years ago
2006-03-18T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	so does ubuntu, but the tools are different, sometimes radically so.
2006-03-18T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	or so I hear, I haven't used redhat in a while now
2006-03-18T08:55:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe	nickrud	alright, change is done, thanks... I still have that DNS problem though... it only happens when i connect through the GUI network admin interface...
2006-03-18T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	I was just sitting here, wondering about that gui thing, I have no clue on that
2006-03-18T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	you could do a cat /etc/resolv.conf when you have a working ppp0 , and put those dns servers in the gui. that should work
2006-03-18T08:57:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe	nickrud	except i would need to change them manually each time i drop the ppp connection, for my LAN...
2006-03-18T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	ok, we're getting past just ppp here and I run from networking questions :)
2006-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	UNiXWHoRe	the patches can be found in linux-patch-ubuntu-2.6.12
2006-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	UNiXWHoRe	nickrud	i dont want patched, i run on an old K6-2 450 and the stock kernel is sluggish
