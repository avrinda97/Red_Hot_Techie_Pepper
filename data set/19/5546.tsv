2008-06-09T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	in what way ?
2008-06-09T02:07:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	no particular way. just anything that i should no about the operating system
2008-06-09T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	read the docus on ubuntu.com to get an intro
2008-06-09T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	ubuntu ultimate is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	a 3rd party group that are nothing to do with ubuntu package and maintain it
2008-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	oh.... really?
2008-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	yes
2008-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	hence why there is no info on ubuntu.com
2008-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	it wasn't intentional clearly
2008-06-09T02:11:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	It's just that Ultimate Edition looks so good without having to do any of the customization myself. that's the main reason i got it.
2008-06-09T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	well, you woulnd't get any help/support from official ubuntu resources
2008-06-09T02:13:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	you do have a good point. then again there is google...hm. what are the advatages besides help/support in using regular Ubuntu?
2008-06-09T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	errrr its supported and maintained
2008-06-09T02:14:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	and is continuously updated right?
2008-06-09T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	it certainly is
2008-06-09T02:15:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	does Ubuntu have compiz fusion? (i believe thats what it is)
2008-06-09T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Cybergasm	yes it does
2008-06-09T02:15:00.000Z	Cybergasm	ikonia	my friend told me to make sure i have it...what exactly is it?
