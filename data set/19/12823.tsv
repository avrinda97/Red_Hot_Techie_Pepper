2005-07-08T08:50:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	Oh I see. Thanks
2005-07-08T08:50:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	no worries, man! anytime!
2005-07-08T08:51:00.000Z	absinthe		So I've been thinking of trying a more "hands-on" or nitty-gritty linux distro. Any reccomendations?
2005-07-08T08:51:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	if you want a hands on distro, go with arch linux
2005-07-08T08:51:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	if you would like to compile EVERYTHING you install, go with gentoo.  But if you would like modest optimizated binaries, go with arch
2005-07-08T08:52:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	I've been reading up on arch. I don't want to compile everything from source like gentoo. But I like the i686 optimization
2005-07-08T08:52:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	yes, i've used arch for a long time.  it's quite speedy, and very customizable
2005-07-08T08:53:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	i've learned a lot from using arch.. but now that i don't have time to fiddle, i've gone to ubuntu.  everything "just works", but it's still hackable
2005-07-08T08:53:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	I like to "fiddle" so I'll probably try it. Pacman looks pretty sweet
2005-07-08T08:53:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	How about Slackware?
2005-07-08T08:54:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	pacman is really nice.  it compares with apt.  apt is more mature and has more features, but pacman does everything you need it to do, and is very simple
2005-07-08T08:54:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	never tried it myself, but I hear it's nice.  poor package manager though
2005-07-08T08:54:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	Thanks. Well I'll try Arch.
2005-07-08T08:55:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	good choice :)
2005-07-08T08:55:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	you can learn a lot from the documentation, and the forums and IRC are very friendly and helpful
2005-07-08T08:55:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	Installing it looks like a crazy time =)
2005-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	actually, the installer is pretty straightforward.  but an installed arch box is simply the barebones you need for a linux system.  you have to install everything else.  but, that's a blessing because you get no crap you don't want on your system
2005-07-08T08:57:00.000Z	absinthe	punkrockguy318	Thanks for helping me.
2005-07-08T08:57:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	absinthe	anytime :)
