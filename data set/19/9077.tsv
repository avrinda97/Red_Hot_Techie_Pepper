2007-05-31T14:44:00.000Z	ward_		i need to install gettext-devel for some application i want to compile
2007-05-31T14:44:00.000Z	ward_		wwhere should i get it from?
2007-05-31T14:44:00.000Z	ward_		google gives me nothing but RPM links
2007-05-31T14:44:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	then install it
2007-05-31T14:44:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	from the repos
2007-05-31T14:45:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	its not in the repos
2007-05-31T14:45:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	ubuntu is not a rpm disotr. there are no -devel packages
2007-05-31T14:45:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	what should i do then when i need the devel package? is the normal gettext and gettext-base enough?
2007-05-31T14:47:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	, then how should i install gettext-devel ?
2007-05-31T14:47:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	you don't since it doesn't exist. I told you what to do
2007-05-31T14:48:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	what file (header) do you need exactly?
2007-05-31T14:48:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	ahaaaa, so it IS enough to have gettext and gettext-base :-)
2007-05-31T14:48:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	thanx for the help
2007-05-31T14:48:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	in the future: all dev packages end with -dev
2007-05-31T14:49:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	but there is no -dev package from gettext !
2007-05-31T14:49:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	yes, mea culpa. just saw that
2007-05-31T14:49:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	ok so its not needed if there is no -dev package?
2007-05-31T14:50:00.000Z	wols_	ward_	probably not. I actually don't know. I asked you something you didn't answer
2007-05-31T15:03:00.000Z	ward_	wols_	i think he didn't mean it that way, his english doesn't sound native to me
