2010-02-14T01:44:00.000Z	jacky		hey guys, is it possible for me to auto-connect to my wireless network after i restart my pc?
2010-02-14T01:45:00.000Z	jacky		do i need to install anything?
2010-02-14T01:46:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	Nope - it ought to just happen as soon as you log in, once you've connected once.
2010-02-14T01:47:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	Yup, pretty much
2010-02-14T01:49:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	Do you have compiz turned on?  If so, alt+f2 then "compiz --replace" (no quotes), otherwise use "metacity" instead of "compiz"
2010-02-14T01:50:00.000Z	jacky	Darael	Thanks alot. It works "compiz --replace". Anyway, is there a place where they have a list of command for us to study? Guess I need to memorise quite a number of them.
2010-02-14T01:51:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	You might consider adding a launcher to your panel if it happens to you a lot.
2010-02-14T01:52:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	There's a few places, hang on while I dig up some links if you're interested.
2010-02-14T01:52:00.000Z	jacky	Darael	Yes, I'm interested. Thanks a lot. :)
2010-02-14T01:53:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal is as good a place as any to start, and has links to a good few other pages at the bottom.
2010-02-14T01:54:00.000Z	jacky	Darael	thanks bookmarked. anyway, you mentioned a launcher, how do i go about doing it?
2010-02-14T01:55:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	Assuming you're in Ubuntu as opposed to Kubuntu, right-click the panel and go "add to panel...", then choose "custom application launcher and enter your chosen command.  You might want to give it a nice custom icon too ;)
2010-02-14T01:56:00.000Z	jacky	Darael	ahhh, alright i got it. Thanks mate. :)
2010-02-14T01:57:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	no probs, happy to help.
2010-02-14T02:00:00.000Z	jacky	Darael	quick question for you. i noticed my internet speed increases a lot compared to the time when i'm using windows xp.
2010-02-14T02:01:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	Interesting.  If it's better, I'd just assume it's fine.  XP ought really to be working at the same speed though.
2010-02-14T02:02:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	Hmm, sounds like there's something running in the background in XP that's either throttling your network or eating up your bandwidth.
2010-02-14T02:12:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	To show hidden files in Nautilus (that's the GNOME file manager) you can press ctrl+h - but we warned, in your home folder there's LOADS.
2010-02-14T02:13:00.000Z	Darael	jacky	The navigation panel is that bit with buttons for the folder you're in and those above it across the top - press the one at the left-hand end to get a text box, sorta like an address bar.
