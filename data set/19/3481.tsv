2010-01-10T08:14:00.000Z	mithridates		hey guys
2010-01-10T08:14:00.000Z	mithridates		what do you recommend like yakuake but for gnome ?
2010-01-10T08:16:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	guake works, but it's not as good as yakuake
2010-01-10T08:16:00.000Z	mithridates	nick_h	exactly , I don't like that, what else?
2010-01-10T08:21:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	tilda is another one, but it's even worse than Gake
2010-01-10T08:21:00.000Z	nick_h		s/Gake/Guake/
2010-01-10T08:22:00.000Z	mithridates	nick_h	looool , definitely you had a situation like me and you tried all of them :)))
2010-01-10T08:23:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	yep. after using KDE for ~6 years, i decided to try Gnome. 2-3 months later, i switched back to KDE. i really dislike most of Gnome's apps
2010-01-10T08:25:00.000Z	mithridates	nick_h	I hate too but I don't like kde environment
2010-01-10T08:25:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	KDE 3.5 is fantastic. 4 isn't great, but it's slowly improving
2010-01-10T08:25:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	just install yakuake in Gnome
2010-01-10T08:25:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	it'll work
2010-01-10T08:26:00.000Z	mithridates		but it wants to install about 128 mg KDE stuffs
2010-01-10T08:27:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	meh. i assume your HD is fairly large. what's 128MB going to do?
2010-01-10T08:28:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	besides, if you install all of those KDE libraries, you'll be able to run other useful KDE apps  =P
2010-01-10T08:28:00.000Z	mithridates	nick_h	:D ok man I'm gonna install it, I guess you are a yakuake developer =)) :P
2010-01-10T08:29:00.000Z	mithridates		who can help me about this error ? /usr/lib/libschroedinger-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: oil_function_class_ptr_avg2_32xn_u8
2010-01-10T08:29:00.000Z	mithridates	nick_h	can you help me about it? /usr/lib/libschroedinger-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: oil_function_class_ptr_avg2_32xn_u8
2010-01-10T08:30:00.000Z	nick_h	mithridates	heh, i'm not a yakuake dev. i just use it 1000 times each day
