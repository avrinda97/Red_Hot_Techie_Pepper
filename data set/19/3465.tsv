2009-08-03T19:31:00.000Z	Coin_		Hi everybody. I am leaving tomorrow to Africa to teach programmation, in a place where there is no internet connection. I would like to bring a entire ubuntu distribution with me. I downloaded a complete mirror, which is approx. 250Go, but I have only a 120Go disk. So I need to remove files. I deleted the *{amd64,powerpc,sparc}.{deb,udeb}, which are not necessary for my case, and it remains 180Go of files. So I need to remove 60Go more. I would like to
2009-08-03T19:31:00.000Z	Coin_		 know if the orig.tar.gz files are necessary for the installation of ubuntu in a desktop pc. And, what else can I delete ?
2009-08-03T19:32:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	no, you can get rid of that stuff, that's from deb-src, you don't need it
2009-08-03T19:32:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	actually, you do need it if you want the source code for your class...
2009-08-03T19:33:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	Does what you say mean that I can do a rm on all *orig.tar.gz files ?
2009-08-03T19:33:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	if you don't need the source code, yes
2009-08-03T19:34:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	that is what I wanted to know. Thanks a lot !
2009-08-03T20:16:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	I removed all the orig.tar.gz files, and I need to free a little more space. Are the .diff.gz and .dsc also necessary or can I safely remove them ?
2009-08-03T20:18:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	should be ok to remove, they're all source package related
2009-08-03T20:22:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	how much space do you still need?
2009-08-03T20:23:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	remove is still in progress. I tell you as soon as it is finished.
2009-08-03T20:23:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	but I think (hope) it will be ok now
2009-08-03T20:24:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	I'd create my own custom live dvd with the main software I really needed as a backup
2009-08-03T20:28:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	I do not know precisely what softwares they need where I am going... And as there are no internet connection there, I will go with an entire mirror on a hard drive. A dvd has not enough filesystem space.
2009-08-03T20:29:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	I see.  Still I'd be scared to go without backups
2009-08-03T20:30:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	you're right ! I will also backup very important packages in my laptop
2009-08-03T20:35:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	113 Go ! It now fits on my 120Go hard drive ! Yes ! Thanks a lot for your help !
2009-08-03T20:36:00.000Z	jrib	Coin_	cool, good luck
2009-08-03T20:36:00.000Z	Coin_	jrib	thanks
