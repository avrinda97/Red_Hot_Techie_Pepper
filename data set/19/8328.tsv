2007-04-22T07:24:00.000Z	Ax4		hey guys, how do i find the path to open ssl?
2007-04-22T07:24:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	what component of openssl?
2007-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	im trying to configure ezbounce, ./configure --with-ssl[=PATH] 
2007-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	just --with-ssl should work
2007-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	just not sure what path they want, i've tried a couple
2007-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	if you have the dev libraries of course
2007-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	ok i'll try sec
2007-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	i'm not sure why configure does that, but i always just leave it blank and it works
2007-04-22T07:27:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	http://rafb.net/p/9pFspp21.html <---- if you have a sec :)
2007-04-22T07:29:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	you haven't installed build-essentail
2007-04-22T07:29:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	oh silly me, lmao
2007-04-22T07:30:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	you'll probably need a ton of dev libraries too
2007-04-22T07:31:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	yea leaving the path blanked prevented completion of the configure script
2007-04-22T07:31:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	it doesn't see openssl unfortunately :\
2007-04-22T07:32:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	did you install the openssl development libraries?
2007-04-22T07:34:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	libssl-dev ?
2007-04-22T07:34:00.000Z	eck	Ax4	i believe so
2007-04-22T07:34:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	god i love prebuilt binaries at a time like this heh
2007-04-22T07:36:00.000Z	Ax4	eck	Fujitsu , libssl-dev did the trick! :)
