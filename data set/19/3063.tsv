2011-11-08T06:21:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	thanks, i'll try that,
2011-11-08T06:25:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	the unity plug in is enabled. how do i get ubuntu to default to unity 2d? you used to be able to do it just by logging out, and then logging back in the d.e. you desired...
2011-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	thought you still could
2011-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	no, this has been a problem since 11.10. I was hoping with the last update they would have fixed it. i haven't found a decent solution either.
2011-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	its on the gear symbol when you log in
2011-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	i know that, but "ubuntu 2d" doesn't stay the default. i log out, and then i'm defaulted back to regualr unity.
2011-11-08T06:33:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	if you use dconf you can tick the box to save session
2011-11-08T06:33:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	thanks, i'll take a look at that.
2011-11-08T06:38:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	actually, dconf refuses to run, even when i sudo it, and ccsm screwed up regular unity bad. fixing ccsm problem currently. lol. new systems, new bugs. I love ubuntu, definetly a challennge. :)
2011-11-08T06:39:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	was this an upgrade?
2011-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	no, fresh install. it's been a real learning grade with unity, but i'm getting the hang of things.
2011-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	i have to log out to repair ccsm damage.
2011-11-08T06:41:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	think you can just set ccsm back to its unity defaults
2011-11-08T06:50:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	yeah, lightdm stores your default for your current session, but as soon as you reboot, unity "3d" is the default./
2011-11-08T06:54:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	dconf org/gnome/gnome-session
2011-11-08T06:57:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	dconf refuses to launch, whether in the menu, or in the terminal... i installed via apt...
2011-11-08T07:00:00.000Z	hylian	robin0800	thanks for helping me, i'm gonna log out now, (messing with settings, who knows...)
2011-11-08T07:02:00.000Z	robin0800	hylian	did you install the right one
