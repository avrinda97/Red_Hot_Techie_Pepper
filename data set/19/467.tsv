2012-05-30T08:22:00.000Z	EtgarDizz		hi all!
2012-05-30T08:22:00.000Z	EtgarDizz		I'd like to consult: I have ubuntu 11.04 installed, with some applications/modifications. from your experience, how much incompatibility should I expect if I try to upgrade to 12.04? meaning - should I even do it?
2012-05-30T08:23:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	you probably won't have any with apps not to do with the GUI/Unity/GNOME
2012-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	can't speak to your mysterious Javaâ„¢ configs, but the rest should be fine
2012-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	and even if it isn't, it shouldn't take you more than a few hours here to sort any issues out
2012-05-30T08:29:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	rsync from a livecd is pretty simple
2012-05-30T08:39:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	from a live OS, if you have your root (/) mounted to say /mnt/oldubuntu, and a drive with sufficient space mounted to /mnt/oldbackup, you'd run: rsync -av /mnt/oldubuntu/ /mnt/oldbackup/
2012-05-30T08:40:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	hrmm?
2012-05-30T08:43:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	reisio	I thought you meant I can do this from my normal OS and not only from a live CD. also, how would I replace the new relase with the backup if needed? what command in rsync?
2012-05-30T08:43:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	you can, but it's more complicated as there are parts of the OS you wouldn't want to attempt to copy
2012-05-30T08:43:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	like /proc/
2012-05-30T08:44:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	you can just rm the new files and rsync -av back the old ones
2012-05-30T08:44:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	reisio	what's the diff? if / is mounted to somewhere, wouldn't /proc/ be there with it (eg /mnt/old/proc/)?
2012-05-30T08:44:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	proc itself would be, but not the dynamic files inside it
2012-05-30T08:45:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	reisio	I think I need to try this for myself to get a better undestanding... one problem: the live CD option isn't available cos I'm planning on an upgrade not a fresh install
2012-05-30T08:46:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	it's only not an option if you don't have a live OS image and/or don't have a CD/DVD/USB stick
2012-05-30T08:48:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	reisio	also the steps needed to restore the backup
2012-05-30T08:49:00.000Z	reisio	EtgarDizz	obtain live OS image and burn/image to CD or DVD or USB stick, reboot system to this live OS, mount the local root filesystem as well as someplace to put a copy of it (you can copy it to /home/foo/ if you want, but exclusions would come into play), rsync -av /path/to/original/ /path/to/newcopy/
2012-05-30T08:52:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	reisio	understood. now how would you restore if needed? from live CD again, or something else?
