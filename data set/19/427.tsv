2012-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	Zaitzev		can anyone recommend a good irc bouncer?
2012-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	znc works well
2012-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	it's easy to install and stuff?
2012-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	apt-get install znc
2012-03-04T22:01:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	easy to install and simple to configure, just answer the questions and you should be up and running in about 10-15 minutes
2012-03-04T22:02:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	how about setting it up with a domain that I own? how would I go about that?
2012-03-04T22:03:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	not sure what you mean by domain you own.
2012-03-04T22:04:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	I own a domain
2012-03-04T22:04:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	if you mean will it use @zaitzev.com, yes provided the server you install znc is configured to use that domain.
2012-03-04T22:06:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	the domain I own is administered on a remote location, but I have added a dns record to my ip
2012-03-04T22:06:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	ok, so you install znc to that server and it will work. check out http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC for more info.
2012-03-27T01:38:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	ps aux | grep program , then kill PID,  start over
2012-03-27T01:39:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	I've done that 3 times now.
2012-03-27T01:39:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	perhaps seek help from the developers of the program?
2012-03-27T01:40:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	I ask because I wonder if there's a way to "restore" a running program, ie. open it up
2012-03-27T01:40:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	I don't know :/
2012-03-27T01:42:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	I hate having to register on the application forum just for one banale question that they might not even be able to answer, since it seems more like a system-problem than an application-problem. This has happened to other programs as well.
2012-03-27T01:43:00.000Z	pangolin	Zaitzev	but it may be due to some lib update and they are better suited to ask you which lib versions you have and then help fix it or update the app.
2012-03-27T01:44:00.000Z	Zaitzev	pangolin	The weird thing is that it worked just fine earlier today, and there has been no updates or even usage of this computer since then.
