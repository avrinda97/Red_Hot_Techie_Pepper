2007-04-26T13:07:00.000Z	ElCid		what if the C compiler cannot create executables?
2007-04-26T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	you need the 'build-essential' package
2007-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	ElCid		ok, I imagined that, yigal...
2007-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	ElCid		...Flannel, they gave me the sudo-apt command about the build-essential package, but if I can't connect to internet, I can't get it directly...
2007-04-26T13:08:00.000Z	ElCid		...so I'll have to take it from this one and then transfer to the linux one...
2007-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	you have a CD, correct?
2007-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	ElCid		...yup
2007-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	an ubuntu CD, that is.  DEsktop or alternate?
2007-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	ElCid		last ubuntu
2007-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	ElCid		desktop
2007-04-26T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	Last? or the one you currently have installed?
2007-04-26T13:10:00.000Z	ElCid		the one installed is the last one, downloaded last sunday...I'm quite a total newbie...:)
2007-04-26T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	alright.  We're going to add the CD to your sources, and then install build-essential from there.
2007-04-26T13:10:00.000Z	ElCid		the modem drivers
2007-04-26T13:10:00.000Z	ElCid		ok, Flannel, thanks...
2007-04-26T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	`sudo apt-cdrom add` should add the CD (well, first put the CD in your drive), then `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential`
2007-04-26T13:12:00.000Z	ElCid		I know it, yigal...:)
2007-04-26T13:12:00.000Z	ElCid	Flannel	done the first command and now it asks if start the package manager
2007-04-26T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	ElCid	uh, go ahead and say yes
