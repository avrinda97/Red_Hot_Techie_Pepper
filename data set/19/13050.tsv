2005-07-18T16:43:00.000Z	othernoob	nalioth	are you familiar with printing problems?
2005-07-18T16:43:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	sorry, i am not. i dont own printers nor encourage others to own them either
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	however i know cups will drive most printers
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	and "man cups" will lead you to the magical URL that will allow you to configure cups
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	othernoob	nalioth	my prob is that i have a pdf with a tiny little bit of colour in it and a b/w laser printer. and it won't print it.
2005-07-18T16:45:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	get a hammer, wave it at the printer
2005-07-18T05:08:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	i know how to do it, i just cant say it right now
2005-07-18T05:08:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	search synaptic for 'pdf'
2005-07-18T05:09:00.000Z	othernoob	nalioth	i searched. didn't find anything
2005-07-18T05:09:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	search "pkg names and contents"
2005-07-18T05:16:00.000Z	nalioth	othernoob	open a terminal and type "apt-cache search pdf" and see all the pdf tools available
2005-07-18T05:19:00.000Z	othernoob	nalioth	i already did, doctools might sound like the only prog.
2005-07-26T15:33:00.000Z	othernoob	nalioth	only in the annoying repos ;)
