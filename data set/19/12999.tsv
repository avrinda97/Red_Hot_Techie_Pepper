2005-10-13T14:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	'su' works fine for any account with a password set
2005-10-13T14:02:00.000Z	Licker	dooglus	i know this but it wouldnt work in breezy, only worked as sudo
2005-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	that's probably because root doesn't have a password by default
2005-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	Licker	dooglus	my root has a pass...  other than that. i dont know . hehe
2005-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	I just tried "su". typed my root password and got a root shell
2005-10-13T14:09:00.000Z	Licker	dooglus	humm.. weird.
2005-10-13T14:10:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	you sure you set a root password?
2005-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	Licker	dooglus	how do I check?
2005-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	if 'su' doesn't work...
2005-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	you can set a root password by doing "sudo passwd"
2005-10-13T14:12:00.000Z	Licker	dooglus	ooohhh.h..  good eye. It wasnt set.  :/
2005-10-18T10:39:00.000Z	dooglus	Licker	it means that the script which runs after installing the package exited with an exit status of 1, which is an error status.  non-error is 0.
2005-10-18T10:41:00.000Z	Licker	dooglus	whats that mean though is it fixable?
