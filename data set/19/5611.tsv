2009-08-18T09:20:00.000Z	Dacvak		Gah, my grub file just randomly stopped working. I can't get into Ubuntu. I don't know how to edit it from LiveCD. Gah, I don't know what to do...
2009-08-18T09:20:00.000Z	Dacvak		Could someone here help me?
2009-08-18T09:21:00.000Z	Dacvak		I'm in the live cd mode now
2009-08-18T09:21:00.000Z	Dacvak		That's what I'm typing with.
2009-08-18T09:21:00.000Z	Dacvak		Hey. Trying to get grub to work.
2009-08-18T09:21:00.000Z	Dacvak		How can I edit it from livecd?
2009-08-18T09:22:00.000Z	Dacvak		For some reason grub decided to completely stop working. I literally have no idea why.
2009-08-18T09:22:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	Hmm. Can you burn a supergrub CD?
2009-08-18T09:22:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	It would be the easiest way to fix it.
2009-08-18T09:24:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	DO you have any old copies of menu-list?
2009-08-18T09:25:00.000Z	Dacvak	canthus13	I believe i do.
2009-08-18T09:25:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	Try one of the old copies.
2009-08-18T09:25:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	just mv menu-list menu-list.backup1
2009-08-18T09:25:00.000Z	Dacvak	canthus13	I don't know how to get to those backups
2009-08-18T09:25:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	then cp <oldmenu-list> menu-list
2009-08-18T09:26:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	Mount the drive, then they should be in /boot/grub, I think.
2009-08-18T09:26:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	Oh. menu.lst, not menu-list. :)
2009-08-18T09:26:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	What C-S-B said.
2009-08-18T09:34:00.000Z	canthus13	Dacvak	That's wierd.
