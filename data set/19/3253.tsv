2009-09-22T13:35:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu		how do i list the content of a directory in terminal?
2009-09-22T13:35:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu		dir
2009-09-22T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	ls
2009-09-22T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	you can make an alias of ls to be dir, but i'd stick to whats default for now til you get comfortable with the OS
2009-09-22T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	can you expand on "create a network" if you have more than 1 system connected to an interconnection device you already have a network
2009-09-22T13:44:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu	ActionParsnip	 I want to get both systems on the network so that I can mount the drives from either system.
2009-09-22T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	ok so you want to file share, thats slightly more than a "network" ;)
2009-09-22T13:49:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu	ActionParsnip	Great!  thanks.  Now for a the big one.   I need to connect two linux networks through a linksys router.  I was looking at openswan.  any ideas on that.  open swan looks very complex to set up with a router.
2009-09-22T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	are the 2 netowrks on a different address range?
2009-09-22T13:52:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu	ActionParsnip	they are at two diff locations.  if that is what you mean.  we going over the net so I wanted a vpn.  there will be at least one windows system on my network.  and I will have the server.
2009-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	you could have 2 seperate subnets of your network, alternatively you could use a dumbswitch and just use one big address range
2009-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	ive never implemented a vpn server in linux, only as client
2009-09-22T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	have a dig around, see what else you can find
2009-09-22T13:56:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu	ActionParsnip	I looked at openvpn.  That looks really good, but it uses a proprietary connection.  So you have to have the  openvpn client. and my business partner does not want to use that.  but it is supposed to be very good and very easyl
2009-09-22T14:05:00.000Z	IWantToLearnLinu	ActionParsnip	another question for you, I know i can xwindow to another linux box and run apps remotely, but is there a way to run windows aps on a windows system from a remote linux box?
2009-09-22T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	you can use rdesktop
2009-09-22T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	windows dos not allow remote running of apps as it is very rigid and frankly stagnant
2009-09-22T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	you can RDP over to the server using rdesktop
2009-09-22T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IWantToLearnLinu	make sure your account has a strong password and your firewall only allows RDP from your IP address
