2008-03-29T07:53:00.000Z	prettyricky		nope
2008-03-29T07:55:00.000Z	prettyricky		well I just restarted x, maybe I will just shut it all the way and see what happens.
2008-03-29T07:55:00.000Z	prettyricky		Thank you@
2008-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	prettyricky		yeah that works
2008-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	prettyricky		but that would get annoying after a while
2008-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	prettyricky		?
2008-03-29T07:58:00.000Z	prettyricky		sorry not sure what you mean
2008-03-29T07:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	at the top of each window there are typically a list of menu items like File/Edit etc.. are those visable or missing?
2008-03-29T07:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	have you tried using alt
2008-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	do you have window decorations? as in the menu's at the top of a window?
2008-03-29T07:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	so what you're saying is you can't just use the mouse and click and drag a window?
2008-03-29T08:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	ah. sounds like you're missing the window decorations.. you're running compiz right?
2008-03-29T08:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	have you installed CCSM (compiz configuration settings manager)?
2008-03-29T08:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	if you can open it look in there for the option called Window Decorations and make sure that it has a check mark next to it.
2008-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	hang on
2008-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	it's under Effects
2008-03-29T08:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	now go to system/preferances/Appearance/Visual Effects and change the setting to "None".. wait for the screen to blink once and change it back to normal. Does that make a difference?
2008-03-29T08:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	no problem.. compiz is cool but has it's issues.. now you know something new to pass on to someone else :)
2008-04-02T10:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	prettyricky	the new beta does
