2005-07-31T07:10:00.000Z	snickkers		I'm trying to install MythTV... should I download precompiled debian sources, or compiile myself using sources (keeping in mind I'm a noob)?
2005-07-31T07:11:00.000Z	snickkers		asked differently - do debain precompiled packages work in ubuntu?
2005-07-31T07:12:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	what's wrong with using the ubuntu mythtv packags?
2005-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	I installed the ubuntu mythtv packages, and had no problems
2005-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	didnt realise there were mythtv unbuntu packages... will have to look around, thanks for the pointer
2005-07-31T07:15:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	they're all in multiverse.  There are several packages.
2005-07-31T07:15:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	do I just use the Synaptic Package Manager to install it?
2005-07-31T07:15:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	yeah, you can.
2005-07-31T07:15:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	sounds like there's a 'but...' (is there some better way to install it?)
2005-07-31T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	synaptic is just fine.  :)
2005-07-31T07:16:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	cool, thx. Esxcept, I can't find mythtv in the list (I'm look in ALL)
2005-07-31T07:17:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	you need to make sure you have multiverse enabled
2005-07-31T07:18:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	if you don't have it enabled, see here; http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingRepositoriesHowto
2005-07-31T07:20:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	no problem :)
2005-07-31T07:23:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	here's the best explanation: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components/document_view
2005-07-31T07:31:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	Followed instructions on that website, and now i have a bunch of (Universe) packages, but I couldnt find anything for Multiverse
2005-07-31T07:32:00.000Z	tritium	snickkers	we need to add "multiverse" then too
2005-07-31T07:33:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	There wasn't a multiverse checkbox option in the repositry list (even when I changed the setting to display hidden repositories)
2005-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	snickkers	tritium	I'll check it out
