2011-03-14T21:46:00.000Z	newby115		Have lost grub boot-up menu. System boots straight into low res (720x400) screen. Surely there must be an easy way to change the resolution to at least workable???
2011-03-14T21:48:00.000Z	newby115		is it a case of reinstall?
2011-03-14T21:48:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	system > preferences > monitors?
2011-03-14T21:50:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	can't you use tab?
2011-03-14T21:51:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	i mean
2011-03-14T21:51:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	click on the panel and use arrow keys to navigate to monitors?
2011-03-14T21:51:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	lol
2011-03-14T21:51:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	i'll try
2011-03-14T21:52:00.000Z	newby115	ruan	- the only usuable thing and with difficulty is the terminal
2011-03-14T21:53:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	i can still access the panel in 720x450
2011-03-14T21:53:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	hmm
2011-03-14T21:54:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	are you on nvidia, ati, or intel graphics?
2011-03-14T21:55:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	run nvidia-settings from terminal
2011-03-14T21:56:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	just run nvidia-settings from terminal and change display settings
2011-03-14T21:57:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	you said you could access a terminal, so just type nvidia-settings in there
2011-03-14T21:57:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	if the tool is installed
2011-03-14T21:58:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	display settings > change resolution
2011-03-14T22:00:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	it's a gui
2011-03-14T22:00:00.000Z	ruan	newby115	that's launched from a terminal
