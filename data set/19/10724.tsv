2007-05-21T07:27:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		ironcladlou; it the bios settings for the hard drive on auto or user?
2007-05-21T07:29:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		ironcladlou;ask him/her to try to user settings
2007-05-21T07:30:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		ironcladlou- the bios hard drive settings, change from auto to user, basically tell the system the specs of the hard drive so it won't auto-detect it. worth a shot
2007-05-21T07:32:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		ironcladlou-is this an upgrade or fresh install of feisty?
2007-05-21T07:33:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		ironcladlou- i had issues with using 2 western digital drives, the installation couldn't find them!! I had to use different manufacture
2007-05-21T07:33:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	hmm... he HAS been trying to use 2 identical drives which led us here
2007-05-21T07:27:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	unknown, let me ask him to check
2007-05-21T07:28:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	the settings are configured to 'auto'
2007-05-21T07:29:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	what settings?
2007-05-21T07:31:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	having him give it a shot now
2007-05-21T07:32:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	fresh
2007-05-21T07:34:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	we absolutely couldnt get the dual drive setup to work, so we're starting over using just 1 drive with defaults to get moving
2007-05-21T07:34:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	let me find out what kind of drives they are
2007-05-21T07:35:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	the installer, gparted, fdisk all see them just fine
2007-05-21T07:35:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	but grub refuses to boot them
2007-05-21T07:36:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	they are both sata
2007-05-21T07:37:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	i can't really check the menu.lst since he can't get in and can't seem to locate the mounted disk from the live cd
2007-05-21T07:39:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	doubtful. he just rebooted to screw with the hdd settings, he'll be back soon and we'll go from there
2007-05-21T07:39:00.000Z	ironcladlou	ubuntu-rocks	messing with nix without a 2nd computer to surf the web is definitely risky business :)
