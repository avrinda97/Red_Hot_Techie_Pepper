2008-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	stryd_one_		I hope someone can lend me some advice regarding the bash vs dash shell situation?
2008-08-03T10:55:00.000Z	stryd_one_		gnea i'm aware of the general situation, i've read the 'dashasbinsh page and a few thousand posts from people arguing the thing
2008-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	stryd_one_		gnea: sorry i'm ust getting used to the traffic in here ;)
2008-08-03T10:57:00.000Z	stryd_one_		gnea: I suspect that other devs involved will prefer me to change the default shell to bash
2008-08-03T10:57:00.000Z	stryd_one_		but i'm wondering if any of the OS scripts will be broken by my doing so?
2008-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	stryd_one_		wel, i have ascript going wonky
2008-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	stryd_one_		it's the typical "the dev assume bin/sh was bash" situation
2008-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	stryd_one_		problem is - if we 'fix' the script for ubuntu, we break it for MSYS (DOS/windoze posix)
2008-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	stryd_one_		gnea: all the n00bs using our software
2008-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	stryd_one_		aso it has been pointed out - using the /bin/bash shabang, assumes the location of bash, so it's really breaking it for solaris etc also
2008-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	crdlb	stryd_one_	then use /usr/bin/env bash
2008-08-03T11:02:00.000Z	crdlb	stryd_one_	or don't use bashisms; it's not that hard
2008-08-03T11:05:00.000Z	stryd_one_	crdlb	said: /usr/bin/env bash ... is that going to work on other linux flavours, unix, and mac?
2008-08-03T11:06:00.000Z	crdlb	stryd_one_	that'll work anywhere that has bash in the PATH
2008-08-03T11:07:00.000Z	stryd_one_	crdlb	thanks for the hint, i'll try it
2008-08-03T11:10:00.000Z	stryd_one_	crdlb	assuming htat this works.... may i suggest that the wiki page be updated to include it?
2008-08-03T11:10:00.000Z	crdlb	stryd_one_	I wasn't even aware that any systems would be silly enough to not put bash in /bin/bash :)
2008-08-03T11:11:00.000Z	stryd_one_	crdlb	nor was I until i spent a few hours reading the flamewars today :D
2008-08-03T11:12:00.000Z	stryd_one_	crdlb	yeh just general cross-platform functionality... i read that solaris and sun unix put bash elsewhere
