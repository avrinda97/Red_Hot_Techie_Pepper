2006-08-24T16:25:00.000Z	amee2k		after login something keeps filling up my RAM and swap space, however the system monitor doesn't show anything anormal. how can i find out which process is going wild?
2006-08-24T16:26:00.000Z	synic	amee2k	how do you know?
2006-08-24T16:27:00.000Z	amee2k		because of the system monitor in my panel
2006-08-24T16:28:00.000Z	synic	amee2k	what does it say?
2006-08-24T16:28:00.000Z	amee2k		user memory: 1.7G of 2G, used swap 850M of 3.8G
2006-08-24T16:28:00.000Z	amee2k		and counting...
2006-08-24T16:29:00.000Z	amee2k		and that is definitely NOT normal, considering a normal RAM usage of <500M
2006-08-24T16:29:00.000Z	amee2k		any ideas?
2006-08-24T16:30:00.000Z	amee2k		i'm trying to post a screenshot but that takes time atm
2006-08-24T16:30:00.000Z	synic	amee2k	you running 64bit?
2006-08-24T16:30:00.000Z	amee2k		yep, 64 bit, AMD64
2006-08-24T16:30:00.000Z	synic	amee2k	sounds normal to me.
2006-08-24T16:31:00.000Z	amee2k		NORMAL?!
2006-08-24T16:31:00.000Z	amee2k		that it spontaneously uses 3 gigs when idle?
2006-08-24T16:32:00.000Z	synic	amee2k	view the processes and sort by resident memory
2006-08-24T16:32:00.000Z	amee2k		well, now 4 gigs
2006-08-24T16:32:00.000Z	amee2k		already tried, even with "all processes", it doesn't show something wrong
2006-08-24T16:33:00.000Z	amee2k	JoseStefan	that's NOT caching. cache memory is shown separately
2006-08-24T16:34:00.000Z	synic	amee2k	what does the top item in that list show for "resident memory" ?
