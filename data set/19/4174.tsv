2009-03-16T04:27:00.000Z	gRunt		how do I adjust write permissions to folder /media/ipod to read and write all please?
2009-03-16T04:28:00.000Z	dayo	gRunt	sudo chmod -R 666 /media/ipod
2009-03-16T04:28:00.000Z	dayo		!permissions | gRunt
2009-03-16T04:28:00.000Z	gRunt		rt dayo
2009-03-16T04:28:00.000Z	gRunt		ty rather
2009-03-16T04:29:00.000Z	dayo	gRunt	u're welcome :-)
2009-03-16T04:30:00.000Z	gRunt	dayo	I still have the same issue....says permission is denied..
2009-03-16T04:30:00.000Z	dayo	gRunt	i'm sorry, i don't really know anything about ipods :-(
2009-03-16T04:31:00.000Z	gRunt		nah this is to do with the file system in linux
2009-03-16T04:31:00.000Z	gRunt		when I went to properties then in the media section it says I am not the owner so I can not change the permissions, is this odd?
2009-03-16T04:32:00.000Z	dayo	gRunt	try chown -R <username>:<group> /media/ipod
2009-03-16T04:32:00.000Z	dayo	gRunt	or try chown -R root:root /media/ipod
2009-03-16T04:32:00.000Z	gRunt		okay
2009-03-16T04:33:00.000Z	dayo	gRunt	then sudo chmod -R 666 /media/ipod
2009-03-16T04:33:00.000Z	gRunt		Hrmm says operation not permitted with root root ill have to try and work out the user and group.
2009-03-16T04:35:00.000Z	gRunt		ooooo dayo I think I missed a step lol im gonna uninstall and start again 2 secs :)
2009-03-16T04:37:00.000Z	gRunt		ARGH
2009-03-16T04:39:00.000Z	gRunt		ok to create a folder is it just mk /folder thingy here
2009-03-16T04:44:00.000Z	gRunt	dayo	I worked out the problem how do I add myself to the group, in this case fuse?
