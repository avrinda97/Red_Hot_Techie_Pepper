2011-06-22T05:45:00.000Z	mrapple		just started up UFW, and trying to block an ip. ufw status http://pastebin.com/89P1bsq4
2011-06-22T05:45:00.000Z	mrapple		68.237.205.4 can still connect to my server
2011-06-22T05:47:00.000Z	mrapple		and someone told me they use 'block ip reason'?
2011-06-22T05:47:00.000Z	mrapple		im using the command line
2011-06-22T05:48:00.000Z	mrapple		like typing 'block <ip> <reason>' into the command line
2011-06-22T05:48:00.000Z	mrapple		probably a custom thing eh
2011-06-22T05:48:00.000Z	mrapple		so should i disable ufw?
2011-06-22T05:48:00.000Z	qin	mrapple	What service is it?
2011-06-22T05:48:00.000Z	mrapple		and lets say i want to delete that rule...
2011-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	mrapple	qin	they can still ping/ssh
2011-06-22T05:49:00.000Z	qin	mrapple	install fail2ban
2011-06-22T05:50:00.000Z	mrapple	qin	ok, why?
2011-06-22T05:50:00.000Z	mrapple		and at first i thought that was an insult, but apt-get tells me its not
2011-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	qin	mrapple	That will ban host after number of failed attempts, neat way to reduce junk-traffic.
2011-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	qin	mrapple	even better, change ssh listening port.
2011-06-22T05:51:00.000Z	mrapple	qin	ok, cool, but thats not what im worried about
2011-06-22T05:52:00.000Z	qin	mrapple	Then what?
2011-06-22T05:52:00.000Z	mrapple	qin	im curious how i would remove the rule 'iptables -A INPUT -s 68.237.205.4 -p tcp -j DROP'
2011-06-22T05:53:00.000Z	qin	mrapple	Overwrite it with ACCEPT
