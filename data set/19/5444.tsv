2008-10-07T20:24:00.000Z	kushalsejwal		Greeting everybody, Whenever I create any file in GEdit, like for e.g Hello.c then another hidden file named hello.c~ is created automatically in the same folder. what is it and what happens if I delete it.
2008-10-07T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	it's normally an "edit" file thats held on disk until you exit the editor committing it to the real file
2008-10-07T20:26:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	ikonia	: So I should leave it as it is? Its sometimes irritates when my folder is full of such hidden files :(
2008-10-07T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	then should dissapear when you close the editor
2008-10-07T20:27:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	ikonia	: No they do not get dissapear
2008-10-07T20:27:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	in that case I can't comment on it
2008-10-10T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	they are environment variables that point tot he c and c++ compilers
2008-10-10T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	most just use CC
2008-10-10T14:52:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	ikonia	larryone : thanks guys I would use CC only :)
2008-10-12T17:56:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	your choice
2008-10-12T17:56:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	what does it matter what I prefer, it's what you prefer
2008-10-12T17:57:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	ikonia	okay sir.
2008-10-12T17:59:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	ikonia	One question, I have friends who use VIM to do programming, I find it really difficult as one has to learn all those VI commands and all. But I have read in several places that real programing geeks prefer VIM or Emacs?
2008-10-12T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	does it matter what other people like/don't like or what "geeks" use, use what YOU want
2008-12-07T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	I'm told only the alternative cd can be used for an upgrade, but I'm not %100 on that
2008-12-07T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	I believe it's because the packages are held in squash FS on the livecd, where as not on the altnernative
2008-12-07T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	eg: you do'nt have to uncompress them to use them
2008-12-07T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	depends on your ubuntu system
2008-12-07T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kushalsejwal	if you have 1GB of packages installed you can take a rough guess that it will take 1GB to upgade
