2010-08-16T22:06:00.000Z	kn100		are there any screen recorders that don't leave artifacts on the video
2010-08-16T22:07:00.000Z	kn100		I have tried using gtk-recordmydesktop but the resulting video is full of artifacts even though the quality is set at 100^
2010-08-16T22:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	I am just curious; which artifacts are you experiencing?
2010-08-16T22:08:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	I am recording snes9x
2010-08-16T22:08:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	and..i'll take a screenshot to show you
2010-08-16T22:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	I am on a text-based console so unless it looks good with AALIB you'll need to describe it to me.
2010-08-16T22:09:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	uhh, well, lets say I go past a coin
2010-08-16T22:11:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	Well, given that you're running an emulator I would most likely blame it or more accurately the blitting in the original game. Ie. the coin is still there it is just painted over. However the screen recorder captures the screen without or before the covering tile is drawn.
2010-08-16T22:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	I would suspect that the coins in question are animated, are they not?
2010-08-16T22:12:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	thats the thing
2010-08-16T22:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	If the coins are animated, does the animation complete in the video before the coin disappear?
2010-08-16T22:13:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	it's not just the coins
2010-08-16T22:13:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	this would be much easier if I could show you a screenshot
2010-08-16T22:14:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	How does the walls stay in place?
2010-08-16T22:14:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	the walls move to the left, but the thick lines surrounding them remain in the same place for a a few seconds sometimes
2010-08-16T22:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	Have you tried this with and without eye candy? (Read: Compiz and friends)
2010-08-16T22:19:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	I don't have anything other than xfce compositing
2010-08-16T22:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kn100	Since it affects the rendering of the desktop I would try that.
2010-08-16T22:21:00.000Z	kn100	BlueEagle	thanks :)
