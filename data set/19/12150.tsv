2005-10-27T10:13:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	foolishness
2005-10-27T10:16:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	when you add it to the fstab, it mounts at start up
2005-10-27T10:16:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	and you can umount anytime you want
2005-10-27T10:17:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	not that I know off
2005-10-27T10:17:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	ask dooglus
2005-10-27T10:21:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	 did you use df -l to discover disk space?
2005-10-27T10:38:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	its just a file your looking at.,
2005-10-27T10:57:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	you can use ifconfig
2005-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	to set an ip address for  your inet
2005-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	 but you will have to ask dooglus how to set it there permanently, as I do not remember
2005-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	 your ip address
2005-10-27T10:59:00.000Z	pupil	vlad	then go nuts
