2009-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	boringpackets		yeah i have heard good things about the arch wiki, and that 72 page beginners guide lol
2009-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	boringpackets		i have some bleeding edge hardware, that kinda sucks for learning on
2009-05-09T14:11:00.000Z	boringpackets		configurate lol, just say configure
2009-05-09T14:13:00.000Z	boringpackets		diwas ntfs-3g /dev/foo /foo
2009-05-09T14:14:00.000Z	boringpackets		or just "add to panel" a disk mounter diwas
2009-05-09T14:14:00.000Z	boringpackets		right click on gnome taskbar hit add to panel, disk mounter
2009-05-09T14:14:00.000Z	boringpackets		hmm then whats the problem diwas
2009-05-09T14:15:00.000Z	boringpackets		diwas thats probably some port forwarding issue, did you try a high seed low leech torrent just to make sure?
2009-05-09T14:16:00.000Z	boringpackets		diwas that is odd, i used transmission earlier today and it worked great in 9.04.
2009-05-09T14:18:00.000Z	boringpackets		is ubuntu 64bit really that much faster than 32?
2009-05-09T14:19:00.000Z	elky	boringpackets	dunno, but you need 64bit to have more than 3gb memory, and somethings use more memory under 64bit because it allows larger numbers, etc.
2009-05-09T14:19:00.000Z	boringpackets		does ANYONE have tssoft.acm?
2009-05-09T14:19:00.000Z	boringpackets	elky	ah, i do have more ram than 3, so i guess i ought to use it
2009-05-09T14:20:00.000Z	boringpackets		i would pay a dollar for tssoft.acm
2009-05-09T14:20:00.000Z	elky	boringpackets	i am using it now, and i have had no 64bit specific issues with it.
2009-05-09T14:20:00.000Z	boringpackets	elky	im using it now too, seems pretty fast, except x64 kills my wireless (in both windows and any linux distro)
2009-05-09T14:20:00.000Z	boringpackets		i need to get that replaced
2009-05-09T14:20:00.000Z	elky	boringpackets	sounds like a problem with your wifi, not the OS ;)
2009-05-09T14:21:00.000Z	boringpackets	elky	tis why i mentioned both windows and any linux distro
