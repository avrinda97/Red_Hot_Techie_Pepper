2008-08-05T11:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Oldrie^Jimmy	best to do it here; did you read the grub factoid carefully, and what exact errors are you getting
2008-08-05T11:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Oldrie^Jimmy	which was installed first windows or ubuntu
2008-08-05T11:35:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	ubuntu then xp then i reinstalled grub after xp.
2008-08-05T11:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Oldrie^Jimmy	how did you reinstall grub
2008-08-05T11:37:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	I booted a live CD and used the [code] sudo grub | find /boot/grub/stage1 | root (hd0,0) | setup grub [/code]
2008-08-05T11:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Oldrie^Jimmy	how about pastebinning for us to look at
2008-08-05T11:39:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	I'm on my windows desktop... Not on laptop. All i have is dial up or i would get on laptop too.
2008-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Oldrie^Jimmy	okay, well with out being able to see what may have gone wrong tis a bit difficult to troubleshoot; might suggest going through the !grub link again and trying to set it right
2008-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	In my boot/grub/device.map It recognizes both partitions there.. (hd0) and (hd1) just the list isn't loading.
2008-08-05T11:44:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	I downloaded SuperGrub-USB so can i reinstall my grub from that?
2008-08-05T11:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Oldrie^Jimmy	never used that so cannot say; the recommended procedure here is at the !grub link
2008-08-05T11:47:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	I'm sorry what is that? the !grub link?
2008-08-05T11:48:00.000Z	Oldrie^Jimmy	bazhang	THaNK You
