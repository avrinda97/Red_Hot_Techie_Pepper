2008-11-03T17:13:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	you mean ia64 and amd64?
2008-11-03T17:14:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	normaly you are using x64 or x86_64 (amd64), you are not using ia64
2008-11-03T17:14:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	amd64 is also for intel 64bit like core2duo
2008-11-03T17:15:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	x86 or x86_64
2008-11-03T17:15:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	depends on your ram-size
2008-11-03T17:15:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	then use x86
2008-11-03T17:16:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	yes
2008-11-03T17:16:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	i386 == x86 and amd64= x86_64
2008-11-03T17:18:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Petester	dont know what your friend did
