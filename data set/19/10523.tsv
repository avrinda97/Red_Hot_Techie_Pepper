2006-06-08T10:28:00.000Z	makko		USPLASH has NOTHING to do with my question!
2006-06-08T10:28:00.000Z	makko		USPLASH doesn't deal with the boot MENU!

2006-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	thank you. now any idea why a splash grub menu image is not default in dapper (although it was in breezy)? why this step back? (it's strange to me! many newbyes are prejudiced against text menus, especially after they use suse or mandriva, and will think ubuntu is inferior.)
2006-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	what are you talking about?
2006-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	what do you mean no grub splash in dapper?
2006-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	i am talking about a grub menu splash image
2006-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	i have no splash image by default in dapper!
2006-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	there's no grub menu displayed in dapper, it's hidden by default.
2006-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	tritium: i am talking about the MENU splash image, not about the booting splash image
2006-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	it is not hidden when one has more partitions
2006-06-08T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	did you upgrade?
2006-06-08T10:45:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	yes, and nothing has changed
2006-06-08T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	Breezy didn't have a grub splash default either.
2006-06-08T10:48:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	really??
2006-06-08T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	really.
2006-06-08T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	makko	take the conversation to #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to continue to discuss it please.
2006-06-08T10:51:00.000Z	makko	Flannel	i just said the last things that i had to say about this.
