2011-02-25T20:36:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	which version of ubuntu are you running? i have biblatex on my 9.10 box.
2011-02-25T20:36:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	You know, I don't actually know. how do I find out?
2011-02-25T20:37:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	"lb_release -a"
2011-02-25T20:37:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	"lsb_release -a"
2011-02-25T20:37:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	10.04.2 LTS
2011-02-25T20:38:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	and i assume "apt-cache search biblatex" turned up nothing?
2011-02-25T20:38:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	only two packages which don't do the trick, one seems to contain the latex package but no executable
2011-02-25T20:39:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	what are their names?
2011-02-25T20:39:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	biblatex and biblatex-dw
2011-02-25T20:42:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	You said you where uisng biblatex? Then you can confirm there should be an executable too?
2011-02-25T20:42:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	no, that's not how i use biblatex. are you sure you're not invoking a script when using it in os x?
2011-02-25T20:43:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	on your mac, try "less $(which biblatex)"
2011-02-25T20:43:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	actually first time I used it I was doing it manually calling it on each generated auc file manually, (it was a pain) then I found latexmk which now calls it for me
2011-02-25T20:44:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	that wasn't what i asked...
2011-02-25T20:45:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	uhm or have I missed soemthing? Was I in fact running bibtex on them?
2011-02-25T20:46:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	for comparison, my os x box doesn't have a biblatex command either, and i'm running TeXLive 2009.
2011-02-25T20:47:00.000Z	sipior	jonalv	sorry, TeXLive 2010, in fact.
2011-02-25T20:47:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	yea I just realised that too, jonalv takes a step back. He was wrong. But then, why does his bibliography turn up on his mac and not on his Ubuntu machine?
2011-02-25T20:54:00.000Z	jonalv	sipior	thanks for your help, I ran bibtex manually and now it works, I wonder if there was some sort of bug in latexmk that bit me...
