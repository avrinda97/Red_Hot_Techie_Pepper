2007-06-28T12:02:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	check http://www.linux-laptop.net/  http://tuxmobil.org/
2007-06-28T12:02:00.000Z	SurfnKid	wols_	thanks my friend
2008-09-03T21:06:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	couldn't resolve a host via DNS
2008-09-03T21:07:00.000Z	SurfnKid	wols_	so... for example... this system has been off for a year, now its back up and on, and i get this message
2008-09-03T21:07:00.000Z	SurfnKid	wols_	what is the difference between a new system that resolves the host without a network interface up
2008-09-03T21:07:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	a working or non working resolver
2008-09-03T21:08:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	no
2008-09-03T21:09:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	do you have a prompt now?
2008-09-03T21:10:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	nslookup google.com
2008-09-03T21:10:00.000Z	SurfnKid	wols_	there is no network
2008-09-03T21:10:00.000Z	SurfnKid	wols_	and actually
2008-09-03T21:10:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	DNS with no network is kinda useless
2008-09-03T21:10:00.000Z	wols_	SurfnKid	add acien to /etc/hosts
2008-09-03T21:33:00.000Z	SurfnKid	wols_	it worked, i added 127.0.1.1 with the computer name and it worked, however i restarte it and it didnt work again, so i added it to the hosts list
