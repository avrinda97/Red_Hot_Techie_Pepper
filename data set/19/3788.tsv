2009-09-05T13:55:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	what exactly do you want me to do?
2009-09-05T13:57:00.000Z	vigo	Loafers	I am thinking an sudo update may refresh the package list, am still looking to see if those are or were included as supported
2009-09-05T13:57:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	Just did a sudo apt-get update and still nothin shows up
2009-09-05T13:58:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	I noticed this problem in the past but never really cared, but now i'd like to play a game and i think it needs a 3d acceleration

2009-09-05T13:59:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	before jaunty i never had thisi problem. when i used intrepid when i did the system update after doing a fresh install, it would always ask me to enable proprietary hardware, but ever since jaunty it never has asked :(
2009-09-05T14:00:00.000Z	vigo	Loafers	Yes, I am still looking to see if those were or are in the repos for Jaunty.
2009-09-05T14:01:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	 thanks for the links, but i am already semi familiar with everything you have linked me
2009-09-05T14:04:00.000Z	vigo	Loafers	This one looks like the one for 9.04: https://help.ubuntu.com/9.04/hardware/C/restricted-manager.html  maybe is as simple as a restart as mentioned.
2009-09-05T14:06:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	i've had repositories enabled for a long time now, so restarting isn't the problem.  I can't enable my ATI driver because it won't show up :(
2009-09-05T14:07:00.000Z	vigo	Loafers	Is it enabled like that last page says?
2009-09-05T14:08:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	It isn't enabled at all.  Like i've said previously, it does not show up on Hardware Drivers so I can't even enable it.
2009-09-05T14:09:00.000Z	vigo	Loafers	Ok, is it installed from wget or the website that makes it?
2009-09-05T14:09:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	thanks 4 helping, i give up
2009-09-05T14:09:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	I don't know
2009-09-05T14:11:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	hmm maybe thats why :D
2009-09-05T14:11:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	I guess ubuntu no longer supported the driver
2009-09-05T14:11:00.000Z	vigo	Loafers	Yeah, sounds like a lsmod thing,,https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Loadable_Modules
2009-09-05T14:16:00.000Z	Loafers	vigo	Thank your for your help.  Appreciate it.
