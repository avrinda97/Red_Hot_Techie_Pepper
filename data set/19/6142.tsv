2009-03-17T03:44:00.000Z	evilbug		what's a 192kbps mp3 equivalent of an ogg?
2009-03-17T03:45:00.000Z	evilbug		ActionParsnip- quality.
2009-03-17T03:45:00.000Z	evilbug		ActionParsnip- i usually don't work with ogg.
2009-03-17T03:46:00.000Z	evilbug		ActionParsnip- :| in my converter it's from 1(lowest)-10(highest).
2009-03-17T03:48:00.000Z	evilbug		ActionParsnip- i'd convert from a master 16-bit/44.1kHz wav into mp3 and ogg.
2009-03-17T03:48:00.000Z	evilbug		ghindo- yes.
2009-03-17T03:48:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	Okay, what's the source of this audio?  Are you trying to rip tracks from a CD?  Or are you trying to convert one file to another?
2009-03-17T03:49:00.000Z	evilbug		ghindo- i want to release some music in both mp3 and ogg but my converter's ogg encoding prefs are from 1-10 instead of conventional units in kbps.
2009-03-17T03:50:00.000Z	evilbug		ghindo- and since i've never worked with ogg i'm curious what the equivalent of a 192kbps mp3 would be.
2009-03-17T03:51:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	Okay.  I'm not quite sure what the equivilant of 192 mp3 would be, but I did find a site that gives a bit of a rough guide to what settings on the encoder equate to what bitrate:
2009-03-17T03:51:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Recommended_Ogg_Vorbis#Recommended_Encoder_Settings
2009-03-17T03:52:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	Does that help at all?
2009-03-17T03:52:00.000Z	evilbug		ghindo- that's exactly what i was looking for, thank you.
2009-03-17T03:53:00.000Z	evilbug		ghindo- should i go ogg or flac?
2009-03-17T03:53:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	No problem.  The HydrogenAudio wiki has a lot of audio-related knowledge that might help you out.  I don't know offhand how good their ogg knowledge base is, but it should be fine
2009-03-17T03:53:00.000Z	evilbug		Frijolie- thank you.
2009-03-17T03:53:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	Well, FLAC would be a completely lossless rip, with huge file sizes.  Ogg vorbis would probably be preferable
2009-03-17T03:54:00.000Z	evilbug	ActionParsnip	Frijolie, ghindo - thank you for your help!
2009-03-17T03:54:00.000Z	ghindo	evilbug	No problem!  Let us know if you have any more questions :)
