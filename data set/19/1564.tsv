2010-12-23T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2010-12-23T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	it only asks for passwords when you modify system settings.  What sort of things are you doing so often that the password prompt is becoming annoying?
2010-12-23T05:35:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	it asks for system settings, and also when I wake the pc up from sleeping. I don't like that. Cna this feature be removed?
2010-12-23T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	what do you mean by "it asks for system settings"?  For the password prompt when returning from sleeping, you can change that either in screensaver preferences or power management preferences (don't know offhand)
2010-12-23T05:36:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	I mean I don't want it to ask for a password for anything. Not even system settings. Is this possible?
2010-12-23T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	possible but not recommended
2010-12-23T05:37:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	I'm the only one that uses this machine, and I have heavy defences on my live. How do I do it?
2010-12-23T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	can you answer my original question?
2010-12-23T05:38:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	that was a typo. I meant to say that is asks for the password during changing system setting or installing/removing passwords, and also during waking up.
2010-12-23T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	right so make it not ask you for a password when waking up and changing system settings should not be something that you do so often that it's annoying.  The password is remembered for 15 minutes anyway.  It's a really really bad idea to have it not ask for passwords at all.
2010-12-23T05:40:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	what's the theoretical bad thing about it?
2010-12-23T05:41:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	I'm just trying to understand because Windows claims having a password makes it more secure also, yet I've never used one and never had problems.
2010-12-23T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	when you run software, you want it to have as little rights as possible.  So that if it is compromised, it does not brick your whole system
2010-12-23T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	Yeah, ideally ubuntu wouldn't remember your password at all.  And nowadays, with polkit you give rights to do *specific* things, not "anything it wants"
2010-12-23T05:44:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	Ok well how do I do it anyway? I'll deal with the consequences if and when they come. I want the knowledge of this.
2010-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	it's stupid to do.
2010-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	psionicsin	you would run everything as root, very stupid
2010-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	psionicsin	jrib	noted. how do I do it?
