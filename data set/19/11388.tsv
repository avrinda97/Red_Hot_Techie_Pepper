2006-04-24T10:02:00.000Z	newbuntie		you guys know what I'm talking about, right, the kingston usb memory thing...after putting that into the usb port, how do I access it?
2006-04-24T10:03:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	it should just appear on your desktop
2006-04-24T10:04:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	is hotplug running?
2006-04-24T10:04:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	didn't appear on my desktop, I'd like to check it with the file browser, where would it be in the file dir
2006-04-24T10:04:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	how do I enable or check hotplug? :)
2006-04-24T10:05:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	/media assuming hotplug found/installed it
2006-04-24T10:05:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	ps -auwx | grep hotplug in a console
2006-04-24T10:08:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	I get bad ps syntax warning and this and the only process I get back is grep hotplug
2006-04-24T10:08:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	try sudo /etc/init.d/hotplug restart
2006-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	i restarted it but still don't see anything on my desktop
2006-04-24T10:18:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	there is stuff that runs when I plug the memory in, like hald-addon-storage and [usb-storage]  and [scsi_eh_5]  some of those processes belong to user hal
2006-04-24T10:19:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	can you pastebin the output of dmesg after you plug it in?
2006-04-24T10:28:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	ok posted
2006-04-24T10:29:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	what's the url for your post?
2006-04-24T10:31:00.000Z	polpak	newbuntie	hrm well it's clearly seeing the drive.. ls -al /media pls
2006-04-24T10:33:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	that's all, nothing else
2006-04-24T10:36:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	I'm asking because I don't have a scsi directory under /dev
2006-04-24T10:38:00.000Z	newbuntie	polpak	and I don't have /dev/sdf1 either, just sda and sda1
