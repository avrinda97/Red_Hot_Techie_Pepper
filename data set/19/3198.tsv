2011-05-14T17:12:00.000Z	BlouBlou	bazhang	then, it's there any other kernel I can install?
2011-05-14T17:12:00.000Z	bazhang	BlouBlou	you could check the latest PPA for mainline kernel I suppose, be aware its completely unsupported
2011-05-14T17:13:00.000Z	BlouBlou	bazhang	anyways, if kernel fails, just select another one and unistall it, right? there isn't a problem with it
