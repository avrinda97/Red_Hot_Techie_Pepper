2008-04-25T11:00:00.000Z	h00k		I am having a problem getting an external NTFS drive to automount in Hardy.  Gutsy automounted, but Hardy will not.
2008-04-25T11:00:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	what have you done so far to figure out what is happening?
2008-04-25T11:01:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	it's not showing up in /dev
2008-04-25T11:02:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	dmesg reports 'sdb' when i plug it in, but I cant manually mount because I don't see it in /dev/
2008-04-25T11:02:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	sdb is just the device, not the partition, you cannot mount just the device
2008-04-25T11:03:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	there is no sdb1, sdb2 to mount either
2008-04-25T11:04:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	are there any errors in dmesg?
2008-04-25T11:05:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	I know the drive is okay, and ->http://pastebin.com/m3e728ab
2008-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	it looks like you are getting io errors
2008-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	did you try any other usb ports to confirm that it is not a problem with the port?
2008-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	let me try...
2008-04-25T11:09:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	no errors, but it does keep saying [  920.986234] usb 7-3: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 7
2008-04-25T11:10:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	now I disconnected the drive and got I/O errors again, unable to read partition table.  This isn't cool, I'll see what I can do
2008-04-25T11:11:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	any ideas off the top of your head?
2008-04-25T11:12:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	I have no idea, it seems like a hardware issue. do you have another computer to test with? even a 7.10 live cd if that worked before
2008-04-25T11:13:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	I'll try a live CD, I have some other utils I can try.  It /just/ worked today, newer drive, backed up all my info to it before my upgrade
2008-04-25T11:16:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	Well, I turned the drive off for a bit, moved the usb cables a little, and it works now, automount and all.
2008-04-25T11:16:00.000Z	h00k	harriseldon	that scared me.  thanks for letting me think out loud about it ;)
2008-04-25T11:17:00.000Z	harriseldon	h00k	anytime, I am glad that it worked
