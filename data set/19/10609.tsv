2007-08-24T14:36:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrObvious	Oh be quiet. Damn is the last of peoples' worries, mostly that factoid is used for worse words.
2007-08-24T14:36:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrObvious	?
2007-08-24T14:36:00.000Z	MrObvious	Stormx2	said the d word.
2007-08-24T14:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	Stormx2	It's against the rules for a reason.
2007-08-24T14:38:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrObvious	Same factoid.
2007-08-24T14:38:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrObvious	Check it out in /msg ubotu, and also don't try and bug me about "damn" when I meant no offense.
2007-08-24T14:39:00.000Z	MrObvious	Stormx2	It's against the rules. I'm only saying it to warn ya.
2007-08-24T14:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrObvious	Guess what? I know. I've used that factoid hundreds of times, but I'm a firm believer in the spirit of the law.
2008-07-09T02:57:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrObvious	Please /msg ubotu if it's for yourself.
