2006-10-08T16:35:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	there is no builtin mail in Firefox. You can set an external mail handler with the network.protocol-handler.app.mailto config.
2006-10-08T16:36:00.000Z	andreasdk	eracc	How do i find that little cousin???
2006-10-08T16:37:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	in Firefox's location bar type 'about:config', press enter and then use the search bar shown to lookup 'mail'.
2006-10-08T16:40:00.000Z	andreasdk	eracc	Hate to tell you this but i cannot find a "mail" anywhere
2006-10-08T16:41:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	did you type - about:config - in the lookup bar?
2006-10-08T16:41:00.000Z	andreasdk	eracc	yes i did
2006-10-08T16:41:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	then did you see the "Filter:" bar?
2006-10-08T16:42:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	when you type 'mail' in the filter it pulls up nothing?
2006-10-08T16:43:00.000Z	andreasdk	eracc	Something about GTDGMAIL, which is to be removed next time i strat firefox but nothin else.
2006-10-08T16:44:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	hmmm, I guess I added that by hand here. Let me get the details for you.
2006-10-08T16:47:00.000Z	andreasdk	eracc	Any luck with those strings?
2006-10-08T16:48:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	ok, what I did was create a new file in my Firefox settings folder (~/.mozilla/firefox/<junkstring>.default/) called 'user.js'.
2006-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	then I put this line in that file: user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mailto","/usr/bin/kmail");
2006-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	of course you will want to change "/usr/bin/kmail" to YOUR mail handler.
2006-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	andreasdk	eracc	Thanks a lot!
2006-10-08T16:50:00.000Z	eracc	andreasdk	you're welcome. IIRC I found out how to do that using an AltaVista web search.
