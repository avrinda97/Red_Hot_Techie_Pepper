2008-05-04T22:38:00.000Z	sini		i was wondering, can you guys close those overlay ads, which show up on certain websites in firefox3 (ubuntu hardy)??
2008-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	sini		i can't for some reason
2008-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	sini		nothing happens when i klick them
2008-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	most of them though if they are flash sometimes they end up on the wrong layer and become unclickable, in which case something like adblock or flashblock helps
2008-05-04T22:41:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	got an example, private message is fine
2008-05-04T22:45:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	http://lib.aldebaran.ru/
2008-05-04T22:46:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	could you close an ad on that site?
2008-05-04T22:47:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	testing
2008-05-04T22:47:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	thx mate!
2008-05-04T22:51:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	the only one i can close is the cars one, that has a little close button
2008-05-04T22:51:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	so any idea, if this is worth a bug report?
2008-05-04T22:51:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	bocause with firefox2 i can close all of them
2008-05-04T22:51:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	checking firefox 2 atm
2008-05-04T22:57:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	any idea?
2008-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	Firefox 2 does not work for me, took me a little while to fix my flash plugin
2008-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	strange...
2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	sini	kbrosnan	is adblock able to block those ads?
2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	kbrosnan	sini	i would think so, i don't use it
