2010-11-04T22:37:00.000Z	meowsus		Hey. How would i rename all files in a directory via command line using back references and regex? It seems like "rename" isn't the right command for me...
2010-11-04T22:37:00.000Z	meowsus		mv takes regex?
2010-11-04T22:39:00.000Z	meowsus		Hmm... I'll play around with it
2010-11-04T22:40:00.000Z	meowsus		Like, heres a file for example: "01 Hulk Smash __ Pillow Angel.mp3" i want to get it into the format: "01-Hulk_Smash-Pillow_Angel.mp3"
2010-11-04T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	i'd ask in #bash   too
2010-11-04T22:42:00.000Z	meowsus	ActionParsnip	right on. I'll go there.
2011-02-28T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	which device gives the errors and when?
2011-02-28T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	you may need to put it in a windows system and convent it to a non-dynamic partition
2011-02-28T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	why is there no data backup by the user?
2011-02-28T11:49:00.000Z	meowsus	ActionParsnip	why ask that? Some people just don't use their computers right
2011-02-28T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	well they have learned the value of backups
2011-02-28T11:51:00.000Z	meowsus	ActionParsnip	too true
2011-02-28T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	make sure the partitions aren't dynamic
2011-02-28T11:52:00.000Z	meowsus	ActionParsnip	the Windows parition? I'll check it out, but i'm pretty sure they're non expanding.
2011-02-28T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	the more standard the partition is the better
2011-02-28T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	datarecovery pro works well to
2011-02-28T11:55:00.000Z	meowsus	ActionParsnip	the Windows application?
2011-02-28T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	we use it at work :-)
2011-10-25T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meowsus	grab 64bit and you'll be ok
