2009-08-12T18:53:00.000Z	jason__		 im creating a backup script to rsync from one machine to another across the net, trouble is I can't backup because even though both have ssh open they block ROOT and i really want to rsync a copy of the entire machine....any thoughts
2009-08-12T18:54:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	have you attempted starting rsync with sudo
2009-08-12T18:55:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	how do you mean? since starting "sudo rsync -avz user@hostname:/ /backupmachine" would result in not logging in as root permissions
2009-08-12T18:55:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	remember root is blocked on both sides
2009-08-12T18:55:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	you do not need to log into the remote machine as root to backup everything from the source
2009-08-12T18:56:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	ok please explain
2009-08-12T18:57:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	the destination of your backup will not need root, since you can store the entire contents in a non protected dir, you only need to start rsync with sudo, and log into the SSH server as a normal user
2009-08-12T18:58:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	but that user who i login as can't read some of the files that dont allow other then root into certain directories?
2009-08-12T18:59:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	im confused, you are just backing up the entire source (say, server A) and putting it in a dir on destincation (say, server B) correct?
2009-08-12T18:59:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	yes sir
2009-08-12T19:00:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	if that is the case, then only root access is needed on server A to read the files. Since you can place them anywhere on server B, you do not need root access on server B
2009-08-12T19:00:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	is there a way without opening root access?
2009-08-12T19:00:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	if you need to backup EVERYTHING, root access is needed on server A
2009-08-12T19:01:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	like is it possible to allow a user to be root like without sudo
2009-08-12T19:04:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	just use sudo, i dont reccomend allowing a user root access without having to use sudo
2009-08-12T19:05:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	i understand the risks i was hoping to allow ssh only by ip or something that would actually prevent anyone from trying root attempts
2009-08-12T19:05:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	look into allowing SSH access with SSL certs
2009-08-12T19:06:00.000Z	jason__	petllama	ok will do
2009-08-12T19:06:00.000Z	petllama	jason__	but for your original question, just start rsync with sudo, and log into server B as normal user. good luck, i gotta get to work ^_^
