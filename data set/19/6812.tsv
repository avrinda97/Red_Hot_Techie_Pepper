2009-11-15T18:56:00.000Z	Kheops		I have some problems with symlinks.
2009-11-15T18:56:00.000Z	Kheops		can someone help me ?
2009-11-15T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2009-11-15T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	are you sure www-data has permission to read the file you pointed your symlink to?
2009-11-15T19:00:00.000Z	Kheops	jrib	: yes
2009-11-15T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	make a symlink like: ln -s /var/www/somefile.html /var/www/somesymlink.html     and see if that works
2009-11-15T19:06:00.000Z	Kheops	jrib	: It's working.
2009-11-15T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	then it's a permissions issue, no?
2009-11-15T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	why else would apache follow one symlink but not another
2009-11-15T19:07:00.000Z	Kheops	jrib	: mabey because It's directly in the www folder
2009-11-15T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	that's true.  Is that what the documentation on FollowSymlinks says it does?
2009-11-15T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	did you see my question?
2009-11-15T19:12:00.000Z	Kheops	jrib	: I know, that's not empty
2009-11-15T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	do you have a .htaccess in /var/www?
2009-11-15T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	or did you specify FollowSymlinks on a particular directory (/var/www)?
2009-11-15T19:14:00.000Z	Kheops	jrib	: yes
2009-11-15T19:15:00.000Z	Kheops	jrib	: Yeah..the problem It's for the subfolders in www
2009-11-15T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	Kheops	Wallace_ likes to keep you in suspense :)
