2006-06-15T05:43:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	cat /proc/meminfo
2007-06-03T13:28:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	ln -s TARGET NAME
2007-06-03T13:28:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	sudo ls -s /var/www /media/disk ?
2007-06-03T13:29:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	"ln", not "ls" and yes, if you want /media/disk to point to whatever is in /var/www
2007-06-03T13:29:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	i want /media/disk to be shared via apache
2007-06-03T13:30:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	ln -s /media/disk /var/www/somewhere_in_here
2007-06-03T13:30:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	thank you i will try that
2007-06-03T13:32:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	works, now i need to make the files accessible to web users. which chmod would you recommend? read only and for everyone visible, what would that be? and how can i make certain files invisible?
2007-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	you can use letters in chmod, it's easy.  Let me know if it isn't clear after reading:
2007-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	alright
2007-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	I don't know about making files invisible.  Maybe try #apache
2007-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	so i would have to set the files to 744 to make me able to do anything with them and to make others only able to read them?
2007-06-03T13:37:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	so i would have to set the files to 744 to make me able to do anything with them and to make others only able to read them?
2007-06-03T13:38:00.000Z	jrib	gerhard	well you don't want *all* files to be executable.  For instance, images or text files shouldn't be executable, but you're right that the 4 will only give read permissions
2007-06-03T13:40:00.000Z	gerhard	jrib	but for me they might be or not? i would not anyway know how to execute an image so it does not matter
