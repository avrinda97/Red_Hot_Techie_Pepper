2006-02-26T08:10:00.000Z	allan		Does anyone know how to get the ATI drivers working correctly?
2006-02-26T08:11:00.000Z	allan		i have the 2.6.15 kernel... and the latest drivers... but OpenGL STILL won't work right
2006-02-26T08:11:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	i do. what do you need to know?
2006-02-26T08:12:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	i wrote a little something about that: http://lems.kiskeyix.org/puntoyaparte/article.php?story_id=57
2006-02-26T08:13:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	i'm using Xgl now ;-)
2006-02-26T08:13:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	same thing... just put "breezy" where it says "dapper"
2006-02-26T08:15:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	i'd say so... did you have to dpkg-divert something?
2006-02-26T08:16:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	you used the installer to create the .deb's ? that's what i say in my little howto
2006-02-26T08:17:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	make sure that /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2 is the right file -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 620K 2006-02-18 15:36 /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2*
2006-02-26T08:17:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	the other stuff doesn't matter... the only problem you might have is to get the module for your kernel to compile ;-)
2006-02-26T08:19:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	cd /usr/src; tar xjf fglrx.tar.bz2; cd modules/fglrx; KSRC=/usr/src/linux KVERS=`uname -r` debian/rules build_modules
2006-02-26T08:19:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	that's assuming that /usr/src/linux is a symlink to your kernel sources
2006-02-26T08:19:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	in my case i have 2.6.15.3 here
2006-02-26T08:23:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	i have 2.6.15.3 kernel and fglrx drivers already in a .deb... if you want them, let me know. else, you can use my make-kpkg.sh script (interactive) to create .deb's packages for the latest kernel source
2006-02-26T08:25:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	http://www.kiskeyix.org/downloads/debian <-- go to pool and look for the kernel and fglrx packages under "restricted"
2006-02-26T08:25:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	the script i use to build debian kernels is: http://lems.kiskeyix.org/toolbox/?f=make-kpkg.sh
2006-02-26T08:25:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	allan	i'm leaving for a few hours... bbl
