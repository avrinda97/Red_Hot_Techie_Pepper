2007-10-05T07:30:00.000Z	grjemo		Thanks /sarcasm
2007-10-05T07:31:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	sorry, it seems your question got missed
2007-10-05T07:31:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	have you confirmed that there's something on the CD when you open it in windows?
2007-10-05T07:32:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	yes, I know, but it may not have burnt properly. So I'm asking you to check the CD from within windows.
2007-10-05T07:33:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	put the CD in while running windows and open it from My Computer
2007-10-05T07:37:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	lol. Probably. :)
2007-10-05T07:40:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	so there are no files showing at all when you open the CD?
2007-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	if that's the case, it sounds like you've burnt a coaster :(
2007-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	I'd suggest trying again
2007-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	what software are you using to burn it?
2007-10-05T07:42:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	and if it's hassle, it might be an idea to order a CD from canonical for the low, low cost of $0
2007-10-05T07:45:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	lol. Good luck with this attempt then.
2007-10-05T07:45:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	also, please prefix your message with the nick of the person to whom it's addressed. This channel moves very quickly, and it's easy to miss responses.
2007-10-05T07:48:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	hehe. nice one. By the way, I'm called Mortice. :P
2007-10-05T07:48:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	good luck! Sorry it's been hassle for you.
2007-10-05T07:49:00.000Z	grjemo	Mortice	Okay. lol. Thanks. I'll stay on the channel incase it screws up
2007-10-05T07:55:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	sorry to hear that. Still, at least when you order one it comes in a pretty cardboard sleeve :)
2007-10-05T07:56:00.000Z	grjemo	Mortice	Thanks for the help.
2007-10-05T07:56:00.000Z	Mortice	grjemo	no problem. Sorry we couldn't find a fix. Good luck with ubuntu when you get it installed, and you know where to come for help. :)
