2010-06-01T18:39:00.000Z	Dantevios	hhuti	what kind of wireless card do you have?
2010-06-01T18:39:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 broadcom bcm4312...tried the link on ubuntu website...the guide did not helped
2010-06-01T18:40:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx tried this but no luck
2010-06-01T18:48:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 when you finish if you have any suggestions I'm listening.
2010-06-01T18:49:00.000Z	Dantevios	hhuti	your problem is that you need to get your broadcom card to work. I don't know what to tell you on that one. Did it work before? Or is this just a wireless card you are trying to get to work?
2010-06-01T18:51:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 It worked in version 9.10:(
2010-06-01T18:51:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 yes, it's the last line, 4312
2010-06-01T18:52:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 Me?:)
2010-06-01T18:53:00.000Z	hhuti	Dantevios	 yes, it was not working there neither...
2010-06-01T18:54:00.000Z	Dantevios	hhuti	that's strange. The only thing I could think of is that your wireless drivers got upgraded and the new ones are not working for your card. For example my atheros card used to use the madwifi drivers, but now in 9.10 and on they use teh ath5k and in 10.04 the ath9k driver.
