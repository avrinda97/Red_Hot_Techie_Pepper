2006-10-16T13:38:00.000Z	mnepton	AWOSDev	he said Ubuntu. i doubt he wants all the KDE libs just for a torrent solution.
2006-10-16T13:47:00.000Z	mnepton	AWOSDev	please stop recommending KDE solutions as a first solution on #ubuntu. most users here are GNOME users, and have no need for all the KDE libs just to run an app that probably has a GNOME counterpart.
