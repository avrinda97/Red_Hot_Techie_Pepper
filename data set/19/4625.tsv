2010-10-13T14:21:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 some people prefer free software
2010-10-13T14:22:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	no?
2010-10-13T14:23:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 sun java 6 is proprietary software
2010-10-13T14:24:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	ok seem to remember wrong, I actually thought that java was opensourced, my bad
2010-10-13T14:24:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	either that or oracle made sure to hide the source as good as possible
2010-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 java *was* opensourced, as openjdk. openjdk is the codebase that will eventually turn into sun/oracle jdk 7 (mostly), but for now java 6 is stable and is not free
2010-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	ok, I'm confused then, because why doesn't openjdk then support all the stuff oracle java does?
2010-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 it mostly does, but there are some tiny things (snmp most notably) that sun couldn't open source
2010-10-13T14:27:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 and a big reason for preferring sun jdk in important places is that it has been much better tested than openjdk
2010-10-13T14:27:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	snmp is that commonly used for homebanking and security related stuff?
2010-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 it's used for network diagnosis afaik
2010-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 but banking systems often check the specific jdk versjon and doesn't understand "openjdk"
2010-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	ah then it makes sense
2010-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	home banking + java = almost all banks in DK
2010-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 same here, luckily my bank gives me a choice
2010-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	lucky bastard  :)
2010-10-13T14:31:00.000Z	rohdef	haakonn	but well might as well try if my homebanking works in openjdk, but as long as most banks don't work in openjdk I can't see it as nothing but a cute toy
2010-10-13T14:32:00.000Z	haakonn	rohdef	 i use java for many things, and openjdk always works, but i can see your point :)
