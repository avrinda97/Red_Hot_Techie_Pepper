2008-11-03T01:55:00.000Z	diffred		anyone know any bittorrent different than bittorrent download client and transmission bittorrent client?
2008-11-03T01:55:00.000Z	diffred		yep ubuntu 8.10
2008-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	diffred		because those programs don't verify local data properly
2008-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	diffred		I mean I was donwloading in windows bittorrent some files about 12GB and had like 6GB done
2008-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	diffred		so in Ubuntu
2008-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	diffred		wanted to continue the download from 6GB upwards
2008-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	diffred		but fails in verifying local data :(
2008-11-03T01:57:00.000Z	ljuwaidah	diffred	what client are you using?
2008-11-03T01:57:00.000Z	diffred		I have transmission and bittorrent download client
2008-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	ljuwaidah	diffred	and none of them verified the data even when you set it to install in the same place?
2008-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	diffred		yep transmission started veryfing data
2008-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	diffred		but then suddenly the torrent became Paused
2008-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	diffred		I clicked on veryfy local data again
2008-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	diffred		and after a while veryfing...again paused automatically
2008-11-03T01:59:00.000Z	diffred		maybe because it's a big file and in an external USB harddrive
2008-11-03T01:59:00.000Z	ljuwaidah	diffred	have you tried resuming it? I don't think that's got to do with your already-downloaded data
2008-11-03T02:00:00.000Z	diffred	ljuwaidah	but in windows XP the bittorrent works fine :(
2008-11-03T02:00:00.000Z	ljuwaidah		how can I set an ad hoc wireless network that uses wep encryption?
2008-11-03T02:00:00.000Z	ljuwaidah	diffred	I don't know, it worked fine here too :/
