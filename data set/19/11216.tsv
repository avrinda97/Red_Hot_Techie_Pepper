2006-03-09T15:51:00.000Z	Sigs		has anyone had problems compiling stuff in ubuntu ?
2006-03-09T15:51:00.000Z	Sigs		I am having lots of problems compiling OpenSSL
2006-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	Sigs		that is what it said in the install for linux
2006-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	Sigs		the version that came with iglooftp is old
2006-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	Sigs		is it .98.a
2006-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	Sigs		I know .97 has a security flaw so I wanted to install it
2006-03-09T15:53:00.000Z	Sigs		yeah, there is serious security flaw in that version
2006-03-09T15:53:00.000Z	Sigs		I want to apply the latest
2006-03-09T15:53:00.000Z	Sigs		ahhh, ok
2006-03-09T15:55:00.000Z	Sigs		does it rely on the system or is it like windows where the ssl is dependent of the program itself
2006-03-09T15:55:00.000Z	oskude	Sigs	and you think when you compile something new (with 0 knowledge) would be more secure ?!
2006-03-09T15:55:00.000Z	Sigs	oskude	i have learned everything in life by trying, and researching..
2006-03-09T15:55:00.000Z	Sigs		I have been googling for 2 hours and thought of getting some help
2006-03-09T15:55:00.000Z	Sigs		is that too much ??
2006-03-09T15:56:00.000Z	Sigs		this is a test system.. not in production
2006-03-09T15:56:00.000Z	oskude	Sigs	so you could (should?) have found that it was fixed in ubuntu as Seveas  said...
2006-03-09T15:57:00.000Z	oskude	Sigs	ok for testing you can do what ever you like :)
2006-03-09T15:57:00.000Z	Sigs	oskude	: I went strictly by what OpenSSl said on their webpage.. that there was a serious security flaw and that .98a was the fix
2006-03-09T15:58:00.000Z	oskude	Sigs	yup
