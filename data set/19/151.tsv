2012-09-16T23:55:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle		I have a few questions about getting grub to work.
2012-09-16T23:55:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Just ask the questions
2012-09-16T23:56:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Hm... Which OS' GRUB are you using?
2012-09-16T23:57:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	If Ubuntu's, running "sudo update-grub" should detect any other operating systems (detects even my Gentoo installs and gives them weird names :/)
2012-09-16T23:57:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Ah, not working... Hm... What configs have you modified?
2012-09-16T23:58:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Ah, thought you said you did... What's a "partial update" anyway?
2012-09-16T23:58:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	Sorry, I ment I did the most recent ' partial upgrade ' from ubuntu
2012-09-16T23:59:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	(I'm a Gentoo person and the only way I understand "update" is "update all the packages" so I have no idea the heck that means)
2012-09-16T23:59:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	It was explained to me as a partial kernel upgrade, not a package upgrade
2012-09-16T23:59:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	That sounds... weird...
2012-09-17T00:00:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Can you just upgrade everything to make sure we're on the same wavelength? "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2012-09-17T00:01:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	- totally updated, no actions performed durring updates, nothing deleted
2012-09-17T00:04:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	It doesn't say anything about having archlinux installed
2012-09-17T00:04:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	That kinda... meh. Sorry, not sure about anything... I'm not familiar with GRUB2 since it autoconfigs too much and that confuses me
2012-09-17T00:05:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	 Thanks alot for the help anyways.  I'll just putz arround with it for a while until I can get it to work.
2012-09-17T00:06:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Sure. Um, you sure your Arch has a kernel? Cause if not that may be a problem. Sounds silly but just making sure
2012-09-17T00:12:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	Well I had arch up and running before I installed ubuntu, so I'd better have a kernel avaliable for arch.
2012-09-17T00:13:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	theadmin	 Is there anyway I can manually check?  ( sorry had to get my son from a nap )
2012-09-17T00:14:00.000Z	theadmin	TheMadDrizzle	Well, find your arch's boot directory and search for the kernel, it normally has a name like "vmlinuz-linux" in Arch
