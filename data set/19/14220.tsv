2004-11-06T12:11:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	Why do you want to?
2004-11-06T12:12:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	One particular domain or all of them?
2004-11-06T12:13:00.000Z	pupilzeng	Lathiat	it's all right, just as Windows
2004-11-06T12:13:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	oh you want to disable ipv6 in windows?
2004-11-06T12:14:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	like i said, whats in /etc/resolv.conf
2004-11-06T12:18:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	id get there if you just told me what i wanted to know first...
2004-11-06T12:21:00.000Z	pupilzeng	Lathiat	Sorry for my broken English. Which program loads the module ipv6?
2004-11-06T12:21:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	Your english hasn't been broken, I just wanted to know what was in /etc/resolv.conf (I'm an ipv6 developer see, and i was interested to see if there was a problem I can look at)
2004-11-06T12:21:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	add ipv6 to /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2004-11-06T12:21:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	and it shouldnt load anymore
2004-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	ok well then yeh, IPv6 should have no effect on your domain resolution
2004-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	pupilzeng	Lathiat	You mean ipv6 is loaded by hotplug?
2004-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	but none the less, if you add ipv6 to a line in /etc/hotplug/blacklist then it shouldnt load
2004-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	i think so
2004-11-06T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	Not sure, your name servers might be broken
2004-11-06T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	could have network issues
2004-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	Lathiat	pupilzeng	I have to head off, if you want drop me a line on ubuntu@lathiat-spam.bur.st if you find that ipv6 fixes it
2004-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	pupilzeng	Lathiat	Ok, thanks
