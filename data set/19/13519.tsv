2005-03-18T09:34:00.000Z	tsume		is ubuntu good for developers?
2005-03-18T09:34:00.000Z	tsume		I'm wanting a linux that "just works", but also want to make sure its easy
2005-03-18T09:35:00.000Z	tsume		I haven't been in the linux community in a _long_ time

2005-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	tsume		why should I choose ubuntu over a different distro?
2005-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	tsume		like ie redhat, mandrake, commercial.
2005-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	fr500	tsume	it's too damn cool
2005-03-18T09:38:00.000Z	fr500	tsume	it's free, has great support (here) a great community, great repositories, is very stable and it's fast for me
2005-03-18T09:40:00.000Z	fr500	tsume	i think ubuntu is focused as a desktop distro (or at least i  hope that so)
2005-03-18T09:41:00.000Z	tsume	fr500	I've a centrino notebook coming in.. and the bsd support isn't exactly there if you know what I mean
2005-03-18T09:41:00.000Z	tsume	fr500	bsd is missing the automatic power throttling for the centrino arch.
2005-03-18T09:41:00.000Z	fr500	tsume	centrinos are cool

2005-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	tsume	fr500	in the past yes. It was 3 years ago when I just started using BSD only because I had time(tm) to play
2005-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	tsume	fr500	times have changed I realise, so I must rediscover _again_
