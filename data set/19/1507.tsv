2011-01-06T10:20:00.000Z	StolenWhisper		I seem to be having a problem with my installation of Ubuntu 10.10. When I boot into the operating system I am prompted with a gui login screen. Upon clicking my username and typing in the correct password the windows disappear but the background stays... shortly after the screen goes black and then flashes me back to the login screen. Safe mode works, ctrl+alt+f1 works as well for login. The recovery console works too. Is ther
2011-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	from tty: sudo services gdm stop, then startx (or xinit -- :1 vt8)
2011-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	do you have any log (/var/log) there?
2011-01-06T10:25:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	i sucessfully stopped gdm and used startx, however now the system has locked up after showing the ubuntu desktop background with a single X crusor in the middle of the screen with nothing else.
2011-01-06T10:26:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	try xinit -- :1 vt8 (check from tty for errors)
2011-01-06T10:29:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	how do I "check from tty for errors"?
2011-01-06T10:29:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	swith to tty from where you run xinit
2011-01-06T10:31:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	after booting into the repair console from the tty1, I went back into the tty1 and there are no errors posted.
2011-01-06T10:33:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	have you run xinit -- :1 vt8?
2011-01-06T10:34:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	yes
2011-01-06T10:34:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	did you get xterm?
2011-01-06T10:35:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	good, so Xserver is apparently ok, from this new console run gedit (or whatever)
2011-01-06T10:36:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	gedit is working. I can't seem to login normally with my user account. I also checked to make sure the home directory is working properly. I am able to login through the Unbuntu-Desktop Safemode, Repair Console, and through tty1. However by simply clicking my name and typing in the correct password I get thrown back to the login screen.
2011-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	what graphic driver do you use?
2011-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	jockey-text
2011-01-06T10:40:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	jockey-text responded with searching for available drivers..... and then returns me back to a prompt. I am logged in as sudo su root.
2011-01-06T10:45:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	you do not need root to run it.
2011-01-06T10:45:00.000Z	StolenWhisper	shcherbak	is there something that was supposed to be returned there?
2011-01-06T10:47:00.000Z	shcherbak	StolenWhisper	yes list of driver to use, just stop it.
