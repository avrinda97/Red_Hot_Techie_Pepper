2010-11-07T06:31:00.000Z	ethras		does anybody know what the equivalent to 'rpm -qf' is for apt-get?
2010-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	ethras		i've checked that of course, but I'm not seeing it... any ideas?
2010-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	smw	ethras	is q silent and f is what?
2010-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	ethras		its query file
2010-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	ethras		it shows what package a program comes from
2010-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	smw	ethras	what is query file?
2010-11-07T06:34:00.000Z	ethras		if you have a red hat based distro you can "rpm -qf ls"
2010-11-07T06:34:00.000Z	ethras		to show display what package the 'ls' command is distributed in
2010-11-07T06:35:00.000Z	smw	ethras	look into dpkg. not apt get
2010-11-07T06:35:00.000Z	ethras		yup tried that too...]
2010-11-07T06:36:00.000Z	smw	ethras	dpkg-query
2010-11-07T06:40:00.000Z	ethras	smw	I'm having trouble with the syntax of dpkg-query, it definitely is the right road though, Thanks!
2010-11-07T06:41:00.000Z	ethras		i'm reading through the man
2010-11-07T06:41:00.000Z	smw	ethras	 dpkg-query -S /usr/bin/ls
2010-11-07T06:41:00.000Z	smw	ethras	http://fosswire.com/post/2009/05/dpkg-query-find-package-file/
2010-11-07T06:42:00.000Z	ethras		wow! so I have to start off with a 'which' to get the path? that's no good,
2010-11-07T06:43:00.000Z	ethras		well it's fine, but not as nice as 'rpm -qf', to get the same functionality i'll have to write up a script and alias it
2010-11-07T06:44:00.000Z	ethras		but thanks! that was exactly what I was looking for!
2010-11-07T06:44:00.000Z	smw	ethras	np
