2005-02-11T12:56:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	just change default to the number of your windows boot
2005-02-11T12:56:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	boot number is then the partition number or?
2005-02-11T12:56:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	nope. Just count down the number of entries
2005-02-11T12:57:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	okay, let me try that one. But why doesnt it work when I put the entry one or more entries upwards in menu.lst?
2005-02-11T12:59:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	sorry don't really understand your question
2005-02-11T13:00:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	the only thing I was after is that when booting the grub menu does boot into windows as default and not Ubuntu as first. Thats why I was first trying to move the Windows entry upwards in menu.lst
2005-02-11T13:00:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	but that didn't work out
2005-02-11T13:01:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	when you boot up, which option was highlighted?
2005-02-11T13:01:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.8.1-3-386
2005-02-11T13:02:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	and your default now reads?
2005-02-11T13:02:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	dault is zero
2005-02-11T13:03:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	let me try that and then reboot
2005-02-11T13:03:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	I tried it the other way round by moving the windows entry upwards, being zero ;-)
2005-02-11T13:04:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	heh - make minimal modifications
2005-02-11T13:04:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	hehe, I got the point of linux..... :-)
2005-02-11T13:07:00.000Z	fonz55	snowblink	thanks in advance
2005-02-11T13:07:00.000Z	snowblink	fonz55	good luck
