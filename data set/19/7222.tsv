2007-09-27T06:56:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	i have that card also and it works here, im running Gutsy 7.10  though
2007-09-27T06:58:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	mine worked out of the box but the volume was wrong, i had to go into system->prefs->sound and change the mixer to CA0106 and then have analog front chosen to be able to adjust my volume
2007-09-27T07:01:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	you might need to open your volume control also and edit preferences there to show 'analog front' also
2007-09-27T07:03:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	i only have headphones but they are in the green jack
2007-09-27T07:06:00.000Z	vixyfox	slackern	Tried every port and such, still not working :/
2007-09-27T07:07:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	if you rightclick the little volume control icon in the panel and select preferences, is it set to the correct mixer and analog front also?
2007-09-27T07:08:00.000Z	vixyfox	slackern	Yes, I just made sure -_-
2007-09-27T07:09:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	hmm then im not sure at all, but then again i am not running feisty right now so with some luck it will work for you in gutsy
2007-09-27T07:10:00.000Z	vixyfox	slackern	Alright... bah... and I was so excited to... hoped to finally be rid of windows... but now... GAH
2007-09-27T07:10:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	i have 3 soundcards here and i just tossed this one in the other day to try it out, and it is the only one that ever had problems with the mixer, not showing the right as mastervolume and such
2007-09-27T07:11:00.000Z	vixyfox	slackern	Yeah, I just hope they fix it soon, I'd really rather stay with Ubuntu and not windows
2007-09-27T07:13:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	btw just for reference this is what the lspci output is for the card im using."01:08.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Audigy LS"
2007-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	vixyfox	slackern	Mine was just a little bit different, let me get the right values of mine
2007-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	slackern	vixyfox	those numbers at the start is nothing to think about, it's just positions on the Bus
2007-09-27T07:15:00.000Z	vixyfox	slackern	Ah okay, yeah that's what mine says
