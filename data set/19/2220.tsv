2010-05-26T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	chromium has proxy settings in the under the hood section
2010-05-26T18:14:00.000Z	hora	ActionParsnip	what do you mean by hood section?, when i open the proxy settings in chrome it refers to a page saying its set in the os, a thing that doesn't come up when im not using linux
2010-05-26T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	click the spanner on the right -> options -> under the hood tab
2010-05-26T18:16:00.000Z	hora	ActionParsnip	yes, and then i as i click change proxysettings i get refered to about:linux-proxy-configuration
2010-05-26T18:16:00.000Z	hora	ActionParsnip	yes, and then i as i click change proxysettings i get refered to about:linux-proxy-config *
2010-05-26T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	i'm using the daily build and can manually set proxies in there
2010-05-26T18:20:00.000Z	hora	ActionParsnip	how do i apt-get the daily build of chrome?
2010-05-26T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily/ppa; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-05-26T18:23:00.000Z	hora	ActionParsnip	add-apt-repository is not a valid command
2010-05-26T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	are you not on karmic / lucid?
2010-05-26T18:29:00.000Z	hora	ActionParsnip	crunchbang
2010-05-26T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	crunchbang isnt supported here
2010-05-26T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	crunchbang support is in #crunchbang
2010-05-26T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	irrelevant, your distro is not supported here
2010-05-26T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hora	if you expect support from the official channel you need to have an official release from canonical
