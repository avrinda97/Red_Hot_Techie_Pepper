2007-10-19T04:30:00.000Z	sisseck	bmk789	but shouldnt most of the programs in the add/remove window work then?
2007-10-19T04:31:00.000Z	bmk789	sisseck	yes, why?

2007-10-19T04:34:00.000Z	sisseck	bmk789	ok the problem is that i cant install any programs from the add/remove windows. they all say something like this: TuxMath cannot be installed on your computer type (i386)
