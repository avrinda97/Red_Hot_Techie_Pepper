2004-11-17T13:06:00.000Z	ben_		how do i get my mouse to work?
2004-11-17T13:06:00.000Z	ben_		i plugged in a mouse to my laptop, but it doesn't do anything
2004-11-17T13:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	what kind of mouse usb ?
2004-11-17T13:08:00.000Z	ben_	LinuxJones	it's a usb mouse with a little converter that converts it to a ps/2 plug
2004-11-17T13:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	probably :)
2004-11-17T13:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	someone else had the same problem a week or so ago
2004-11-17T13:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	heh
2004-11-17T13:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	you gotta love hotplug :D
2004-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	you have to edit your /etc/X``/XF86Config-4 file
2004-11-18T08:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	I don't think you would notice a difference
2004-11-18T08:30:00.000Z	ben_	LinuxJones	ok, thanks
2004-11-18T08:31:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	They are small you just install both :)
2004-11-18T08:32:00.000Z	ben_	LinuxJones	well i was thinking about icewm because it actually looked a bit nicer than xfce
2004-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	I like xfce over icewm personally.
2004-11-18T08:37:00.000Z	ben_	LinuxJones	what's the command to untar a file?
2004-11-18T08:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	tar xfv
2004-11-18T08:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ben_	you can also jsut dbl click it and open with fileroller
2004-11-22T06:13:00.000Z	ben_	LinuxJones	and that can crash the whole system?
