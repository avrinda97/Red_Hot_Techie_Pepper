2007-01-03T14:36:00.000Z	PriceChild		[lynx] _: pinging me :P
2007-01-03T14:37:00.000Z	PriceChild		[lynx] _: adaptr please use the main mirror instead of me... it will mean if we pull my mirror down from bandwidth errors you don't lose beryl packages :)
2007-01-03T14:37:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	is that a SVN repo you run ?
2007-01-03T14:37:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	no, I host official beryl ubuntu packages
2007-01-03T14:37:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	what I thought.... [lynx] _ I use http://download.tuxfamily.org/3v1deb edgy beryl-svn
2007-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	okease don't
2007-10-17T23:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	did you mess about with uuid's/ "/dev/{s,h}da" ?
2007-10-17T23:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	pastebing fdisk -l and /etc/fstab
2007-10-17T23:11:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	no, the fstab has the normal dev nodes in it - I disabled uuid a long time ago (from 6.06 to 6.10) when they failed to boot at all
2007-10-17T23:12:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	I suspect something with the device-mapper, as the node for my home partition is the only one created when the bootup fails
2007-10-17T23:13:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	also, the weird thing is that this only happens when I boot the new Gutsy kernel (2.6.22), and not with the old one
2007-10-17T23:14:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	but alas, when I boot the old one it doesn't recognise my nvidia-restricted (obviously)
2007-10-17T23:17:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	I asked for information earlier.
2007-10-17T23:17:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	true, one sec
2007-10-17T23:21:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	http://apache.pastebin.ca/740090
2007-10-17T23:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	hmm wierd... not sure sorry.
2007-10-17T23:23:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	you don't really have anything missing.
2007-10-17T23:24:00.000Z	adaptr	PriceChild	no ? how about the shm mounts ? aren't they supposed to be in fstab too ?
2007-10-17T23:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	adaptr	none in mine ;)
