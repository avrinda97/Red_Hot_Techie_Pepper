2006-01-17T16:20:00.000Z	JDigital	soundray	I think manufacturers are reluctant to support Linux because it's a very small fraction of the desktop market
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	that is precisely the opposite of the point I'm arguing.
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	JDigital	soundray	you think Microsoft or someone is paying people not to support Linux?
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	I think if you take a balanced look at the market, you will find plenty of commercial potential for Linux products.
2006-01-17T16:22:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	no, I don't think they are as obvious at this point.
2006-01-17T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	may be so. But the kind of person who chooses Linux is on average someone well worth selling stuff to.
2006-01-17T16:23:00.000Z	JDigital	soundray	I agree
2006-01-17T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	the potential of this market is being underestimated in a serious way.
2006-01-17T16:25:00.000Z	JDigital	soundray	Linux desktop is still maybe only 1% of the desktop market.
2006-01-17T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	that's only if you count dual-boot machines as Windows PCs.
2006-01-17T16:27:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	s/Linux/Windows and your statement is still true.
2006-01-17T16:28:00.000Z	JDigital	soundray	haha, it's true
2006-01-17T16:30:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	you've been lucky with your Windows problems then. The thing is, if you're stuck in Windows, you're really stuck.
2006-01-17T16:31:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	the big advantage in Linux is discoverability. That 'obscure' command you read on IRC will be second-nature for you tomorrow.
2006-01-17T16:32:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	mitrovarr, I tried to configure dual-monitor on a windows laptop. The results were and still are absolutely unpredictable.
2006-01-17T16:41:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	yes, you can.
2006-01-17T16:41:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	not really.
2006-01-17T16:42:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	depending on your chipset, your disk device could be /dev/sda instead of /dev/hda.
2006-01-17T16:43:00.000Z	soundray	JDigital	of course it will.
