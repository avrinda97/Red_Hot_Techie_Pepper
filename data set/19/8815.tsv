2007-02-04T16:23:00.000Z	Gunrun		Hello? can anyone explain what has happened here: http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/8308/p1010507lz1.jpg
2007-02-04T16:23:00.000Z	Gunrun		it isn't good
2007-02-04T16:23:00.000Z	Gunrun		:(
2007-02-04T16:24:00.000Z	unop	Gunrun	 it could be that the configuration files for your desktop's applets have been corrupted -- you can always delete these applets and add them in at a later time
2007-02-04T16:25:00.000Z	Gunrun	unop	I would
2007-02-04T16:25:00.000Z	Gunrun		but its on a CD
2007-02-04T16:25:00.000Z	Gunrun		thats what happens when I liveCD

2007-02-04T16:26:00.000Z	Gunrun		more there
2007-02-04T16:27:00.000Z	unop	Gunrun	 hmm, well, you dont really need those applets to continue using the desktop or liveCD -- so you can continue what you were doing -- i think this might be because the image you downloaded wasnt written to CD properly or the CD is indeed faulty/corrupt
2007-02-04T16:27:00.000Z	Gunrun		hmm
2007-02-04T16:27:00.000Z	Gunrun		well, I can't run the install
2007-02-04T16:27:00.000Z	Gunrun		so... it makes it rather hard to continue what I was doing
2007-02-04T16:27:00.000Z	Gunrun		sorry about the lines :(
2007-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	unop	Gunrun	 what happens when you try and log off (not shutdown/restart)
2007-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	unop		?
2007-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	Gunrun	unop	it goes to the login screen
2007-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	Gunrun		with the box in the middle
2007-02-04T16:29:00.000Z	unop	Gunrun	 errm, so something is working alright then -- can you log back in (the username is user, i think) ?
