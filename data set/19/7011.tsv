2007-11-02T07:56:00.000Z	Pancakes		Could someone help me install XChat? I've never installed anything while in Ubuntu before
2007-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Open the synaptic package manager located under system>administration
2007-11-02T07:58:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Or you can do what secion said.
2007-11-02T07:58:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Try what I said.
2007-11-02T07:59:00.000Z	Pancakes	Ebiggs	then what?
2007-11-02T07:59:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Click in that right frame, then begin typing Xchat.
2007-11-02T08:00:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	When you see it, check the box next to it and then click apply at the top.
2007-11-02T08:00:00.000Z	Pancakes	Ebiggs	I see "xchat-common"
2007-11-02T08:00:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	xchat is right above it.
2007-11-02T08:01:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Unless you don't have all of your sources enabled.
2007-11-02T08:01:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	I would assume that you wouldn't see -common without xchat though...
2007-11-02T08:01:00.000Z	Pancakes	Ebiggs	I'm only able to check mark it for removal
2007-11-02T08:02:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Well, try going to System>Administration>Software Sources, then.
2007-11-02T08:04:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Are the four first boxes checked on the first tab?
2007-11-02T08:04:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Check 'em!
2007-11-02T08:04:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Then hit close and return to the Synaptic Package Manager.
2007-11-02T08:06:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Back in Synaptic, click reload and then look for xchat again.
2007-11-02T08:08:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	If it asks to install other stuff with it click ok/yes
2007-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Pancakes	Another satisfied customer. =P
