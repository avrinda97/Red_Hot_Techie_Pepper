2009-09-15T00:47:00.000Z	Guest21216		??
2009-09-15T00:47:00.000Z	Guest21216		Yeah I tried that but it's too complicated Im new
2009-09-15T00:48:00.000Z	Guest21216		can anyone help me pls
2009-09-15T00:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	I see hmm
2009-09-15T00:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	yep it can be a bit tricky to configure hardware, espessially when new
2009-09-15T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	Touch can be a bit of a problem in  Ubuntu,  I think standard Ipod is probably easier to get working
2009-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	hmm
2009-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	did you connect the device with USB?
2009-09-15T01:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	I don't know, because fortunatly I don't tend to buy  hardware  that   does not have  offical Linux  support from the manufactures that made them
2009-09-15T01:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	I could look at the page though, to see if I know what your meant to do or not
2009-09-15T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	Apple do not like Linux,  Touch's can be a bit tricky to configure
2009-09-15T01:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	I have been trying to help you a bit
2009-09-15T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	I suggested a virtual machine if you coudn't get it working in Banshee, that's helping
2009-09-15T01:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	hmm
2009-09-15T01:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	how much RAM do you have?
2009-09-15T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	http://www.virtualbox.org  and for Linux hosts,   which is the closed source  version with USB support,   hmmm  that needs setting up in 9.04 the USB support though,  #vbox for help and   you can have Windows  for your Ipod touch inside Ubuntu probably with that
2009-09-15T01:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	a work around is the virtual machine by the way
2009-09-15T01:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest21216	You have to learn to help yourself a bit when it comes to stuff like Ubuntu,   not many people will want to hold your hand all the way,  like they might do with Windows, if you paid them heh
