2004-12-22T09:45:00.000Z	moquist		k, i'm lost here.  how am I supposed to burn a CD?  i'm running hoary.  i could just use cdrecord, but I want to do it the noob way...
2004-12-22T09:45:00.000Z	moquist		i don't see anything in the menu that will burn a cd.  :-o
2004-12-22T09:46:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	right click on the file
2004-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	I didn't find anything in the context menu, either.
2004-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	are you on hoary?
2004-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	Open with "Archive Manager", "Open with Other Application", Cut, Copy, Make Link, Rename, Move to Trash, Properties.
2004-12-22T09:48:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	I think it might be.  ;)
2004-12-22T09:48:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	or use gnomebaker
2004-12-22T09:49:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	appears not to be installed.
2004-12-22T09:49:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	it is a sep prog not in ubu sorry should have told you that
2004-12-22T09:49:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	but it is very good and if you don't want to d/l kdelibs and such
2004-12-22T09:50:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	oh, ok.  np.  i'm actually happier using cdrecord, myself.  I just want to know what Ubuntu offers to the newbies - but I'm running Hoary, so of course things will be b0rken once in a while.
2004-12-22T09:51:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	without a doubt.. just bite the sour apple eh
2004-12-22T10:00:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	duh? :P
2004-12-22T10:02:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	i'm rather shocked that the necessary package wasn't already installed.  if I was new to linux, I would've had no idea what to do.  :(
2004-12-22T10:02:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	I had it installed though .. funky
2004-12-22T10:03:00.000Z	moquist	Tsjoklat	furthermore, I'm still flummoxed.  I don't have a clue how this thing is supposed to work.  If I drag an ISO into the window, am I going to get a CD with an ISO image, or an ISO containing another ISO?  Also, I don't even see how to tell it to burn the disc.  I don't *think* I'm being dense, here...
2004-12-22T10:04:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	there is another thing you have to get... libburn0? something?
2004-12-22T10:09:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	moquist	happy happy joy joy and all that rot
