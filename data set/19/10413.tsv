2006-07-19T13:21:00.000Z	kdingo		i resized my root partition and now it doesn't seem to recognize the extra space
2006-07-19T13:21:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	maybe you didn't resize the file system as well
2006-07-19T13:22:00.000Z	kdingo	mwe	i don't understand
2006-07-19T13:22:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	you need to tell the file system about the extra space
2006-07-19T13:22:00.000Z	kdingo	mwe	how would i do that?
2006-07-19T13:23:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	sudo tune2f -j /dev/whatever I think
2006-07-19T13:24:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	tune2fs that is
2006-07-19T13:25:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	um it is resize2fs. sorry
2006-07-19T13:26:00.000Z	kdingo	mwe	ah ok i was just about to say it said there was already a journal
2006-07-19T13:26:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	you need sth like sudo resize2fs /dev/whatever <size>
2006-07-19T13:27:00.000Z	kdingo	mwe	ok thanks, i will try that now
2006-07-19T13:27:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	is it the root partition?
2006-07-19T13:28:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	careful with the size
2006-07-19T13:28:00.000Z	kdingo	mwe	yes it is. will i have to boot from a cd to resize the root filesysteM?
2006-07-19T13:28:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	yes!
2006-07-19T13:29:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	and careful with the size as well
2006-07-19T13:29:00.000Z	kdingo	mwe	thanks
2006-07-19T13:29:00.000Z	mwe	kdingo	it might break if you make it larger than the actual partition
