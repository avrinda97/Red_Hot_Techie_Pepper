2011-05-03T10:48:00.000Z	marenostrum		Interesting. When did I say Firefox to remember my pass for Launchpad? I don't like this. Maybe by an accident but I don't like this!
2011-05-03T10:48:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	So tell it not to.
2011-05-03T10:49:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	I will do so but first I want to see if it remembered it against my will. I want to check (I don't know how to test :) )
2011-05-03T10:50:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	Delete all form data and current logins, then try to replicate it.
2011-05-03T10:51:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	Yea. Thanks.
2011-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	You can also use Gnome3
2011-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	You mean from ppa. First I want to experience Unity. Then, I'll give it a try.
2011-05-03T14:30:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	Well, Gnome3 breaks Unity so you can't exactly "revert"
2011-05-03T14:30:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	But yeah, in 11.04 it's available in a PPA. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/gnome-3-released-to-be-available-for-ubuntu-11-04-via-ppa/ You can try it on a LiveCD from the Fedora 15 Alpha or something sfrom the folks at SUSE
2011-05-03T14:30:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	And I'm not sure Gnome3 from ppa will give a good result with Natty, especialy for a production machine as I use. Maybe I need an experimantal machine.
2011-05-03T14:33:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	I have very bad feelings for SUSE because of some non-technical reasons. I may try from Feddora live. Or I may install from ppa on Natty these days and then make a fresh Natty install again before I set up everything on Natty.
2011-05-03T14:34:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	Well, I don't know Fedora very well,but Fedora with Gnome3 LiveCD was quite nice.  http://www.gnome3.org/
2011-05-03T14:35:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	Nowadays to try Gnome3 the best way seems to be Fedora -from live CD or install.
2011-05-03T14:36:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	But I'll just try. My main OS is Ubuntu. ubuntu Natty.
2011-05-03T14:37:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	Trying is something else but I made my mind that Natty Narwhal is OK for me for the next 6 months.
2011-05-03T14:37:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	I'd try it from a LiveCD. Again, I hear that there isn't really a "reversal process" so just keepin mind that you've been warned. I've not tried it myself so it could be easy, I don't know. I could be over-reacting. Just be aware. :)
2011-05-03T14:37:00.000Z	Starminn	marenostrum	Alright.
2011-05-03T14:39:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	I noted the reversal process issue. Natty instal is very new now. I may try PPAs Gnome3 today and tomorrow and then make a fresh Natty install. :)
2011-05-03T14:40:00.000Z	marenostrum	Starminn	I don't advice anybody to try Gnome 3 from PPA on a production machine. That will be a Russian roulette. :)
