2006-06-17T15:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	complete dumps all the config files & such too
2006-06-17T15:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	you want to have the security repos enabled, btw
2006-06-17T15:42:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Madpilot	now i have all repos activated possible.. still no unrar
2006-06-17T15:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	it's in Multiverse
2006-06-17T15:43:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Madpilot	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Backports Non-free (multiverse) right?
2006-06-17T15:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	not backports, the main repos
2006-06-17T15:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	yes, you need to edit your sources again
2006-06-17T15:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	no, you need all three types of repos (the main one, updates & security) and main/restricted/universe/multiverse enabled for all three
2006-06-17T15:48:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Madpilot	that's a very complicated system
2006-06-17T15:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	not really. Just go thru the repo window and check everything :)
2006-06-17T15:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	which search plugins? You shouldn't ever have to 'login as root', btw
2006-06-17T15:52:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Madpilot	firefox searchplugins
2006-06-17T15:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	I don't run FF - what's the trouble with your plugins?
2006-06-17T15:53:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Madpilot	how do I copy files using GUI file manager using sudo?
2006-06-17T15:53:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Madpilot	I just need to delete them
2006-06-17T15:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	FF's options should be in .mozilla
2006-06-17T15:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Scorpmoon	it's getting closer
