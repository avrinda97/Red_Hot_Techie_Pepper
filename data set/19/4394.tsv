2009-03-19T14:48:00.000Z	ocol		I tried to install ubuntu, but when it got to the installing logo, it shut down.
2009-03-19T14:48:00.000Z	ocol		And i restarted the computer like five times, and it always shut down.
2009-03-19T14:49:00.000Z	ocol		I waited like 10 minutes and my computer worked alright with vista.
2009-03-19T14:49:00.000Z	ocol		What's going on? o.O
2009-03-19T14:50:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	are you on amd athlon hardware?
2009-03-19T14:51:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	your hitting a thermal barrier, its a hardware issue, my laptops shutdown "randomly" when there too hot, i see it all the time
2009-03-19T14:51:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	the only way to "fix" it is to swap the offending procs out with new ones
2009-03-19T14:53:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	again, you have a semi-defective proc, if its new, contact amd or your OEM and explain the situation, they might send you a new proc, they did once for me after said issue destroyed a hardrive
2009-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	but as far as running ubuntu, it will word just fine
2009-03-19T14:55:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	like i said, the proc issue wont hurt ubuntu, but i recomend you stay far away from compize until you get a good proc, compize eats mine alive
2009-03-19T14:59:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	yea, dont let the proc aproach 90 degrees celcius, thats the magic number of doom
2009-03-19T15:00:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	technically it is defective though, they might replace it
2009-03-19T15:02:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	oh boy, double wami...
2009-03-19T15:03:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	i hate saying this, but windows 7 solved many thermal issues with the beta...
2009-03-19T15:04:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	i found it... pleasent, actually, other than it wouldnt run anything unless you gave it admin privledges...
2009-03-19T15:06:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	a nice cooling tray works, go by your local InkStop and ask them the their three fan tray, they'll set you up
2009-03-19T15:08:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	yea intel hardware is alot more stable
2009-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	gartral	ocol	your best bet, is to try an older ubuntu 8.04 (skip 7.10)....
