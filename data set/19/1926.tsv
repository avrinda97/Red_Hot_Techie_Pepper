2010-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	uh.....which?
2010-11-01T07:42:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	use sudo -i          or gksudo        it's safe
2010-11-01T07:42:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	"su" itself isnt actively dangerous. particularly since it *wont work* by default ;-)
2010-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	out os scope discussion?
2010-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	yeah..
2011-02-05T08:50:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	its a matter of what cpu instructions intel added at what point in history. cmov was added in i686, so UnderSampled probably has a i586 (which would be quite old) or a Via or some brand of thin client (which simply stuck with the old architecture very long)
2011-02-05T08:50:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	is there something special with the naming/
2011-02-05T08:53:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	um... 586 is newer than 386 nd 686 is newer than both?  i mean...i think this corresponds to pre-pentium days
2011-02-05T08:53:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	then why the numbering is in the reverse order? any ideas?
2011-02-11T23:47:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	lowercase when using the info command
2011-02-11T23:49:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	bother lower and upper works
2011-02-11T23:50:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	it seems doesn't
2011-02-11T23:50:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	bash isnt a package, but anyway.... it said GParted doesnt exist, but if you ask it about "gparted" (all lowercase, because package names are *always* lowercase) it gives info on it
2011-02-11T23:51:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	does all packages is to be named as lower case?
2011-02-11T23:51:00.000Z	maco	pksadiq	yes, always
2011-02-11T23:52:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	ok, I'll try, thanks for a nice tip

2011-02-12T00:12:00.000Z	pksadiq	maco	I think Dr_Willis is first, then might be you ;)
