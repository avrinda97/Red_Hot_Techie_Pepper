2007-12-17T11:17:00.000Z	JohnRobert		heh
2007-12-17T11:17:00.000Z	JohnRobert		it does tbh, it just doesn't suck as much as windows
2007-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	JohnRobert		I've been using linux as my only OS for about 6 years now
2007-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	JohnRobert		and there's a shi* load wrong with it...but it's still far better than windows
2007-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	JohnRobert		solaris isn't free
2007-12-17T11:19:00.000Z	JohnRobert		therefore I use it all the time
2007-12-17T11:19:00.000Z	JohnRobert		therefore I notice the bugs :p
2007-12-17T11:20:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	I just started a new job which is 100% linux, so I'm free of windows, even for email.  To me that's great.
2007-12-17T11:20:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	true, but there are other distros that are more oriented to being light weight.
2007-12-17T11:21:00.000Z	JohnRobert	sethk	I like ubuntu though, and it seems like my poor old laptop can't keep up any more :/
2007-12-17T11:21:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	you can do a stripped down install and be selective in the packages you run.
2007-12-17T11:21:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	and run windowmaker.
2007-12-17T11:22:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	on one box, kde comes up in 26 seconds, and windowmaker comes up in three seconds.
2007-12-17T11:22:00.000Z	JohnRobert	sethk	you reckon it's metacity at fault?
2007-12-17T11:23:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	well, I'm really just guessing, of course, but it's certainly a possibility and it's pretty easy to find out.
2007-12-17T11:24:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	certainly possible.  Running window maker would let you decide that (1) it's not really the window manager, it's X or (2) it's not really X, it's the window manager or (3) both contribute.
2007-12-17T11:24:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	that's an issue with linux, yes.
2007-12-17T11:25:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	OSX is as much better than windows, as windows is better than X
2007-12-17T11:25:00.000Z	sethk	JohnRobert	it's a trade off.  Effects consume significant resources.
