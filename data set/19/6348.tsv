2008-02-08T21:31:00.000Z	amenado		fred90-> are you in same directory where your source code is?  do a pwd to check
2008-02-08T21:31:00.000Z	amenado		!who
2008-02-08T21:32:00.000Z	amenado		uuser-> i am not 100% sure, but since you have the mobo, try and install ubuntu to test it?
2008-02-08T21:34:00.000Z	amenado		uuser-> oh well, sounds been a difficult bug to fix in linux, no straight answers
2008-02-08T21:36:00.000Z	amenado		_Oz_-> ummm damn small linux works with 50meg hd and 64meg of ram
2008-02-08T21:37:00.000Z	amenado		fred90-> then cd to your Documents directory and do the compiling there
2008-02-08T21:38:00.000Z	amenado		ashok-> some are made in china, some are from india? same instructions you think?

2008-02-08T21:42:00.000Z	amenado		Lettuc3-> what is the problem? did it boot or not? if it booted, congrats
2008-02-08T21:43:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	it booted, im just wondering why the kernel time counter just changed in the middle of booting up.
2008-02-08T21:44:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	i do.
2008-02-08T21:45:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	i asked a question, if you can answer, fine, if not, what concern of yours is it why i asked the question?
2008-02-08T21:46:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	i know it's irrelevant, i want to understand _why_ it's behaving like that.
2008-02-08T21:52:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	apologies for earlier. i admit i was getting a little worked for nothing.
2008-02-18T21:17:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	i did have a look there, and there are no files that hold that information.
2008-02-18T21:18:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	wait a minute. i think there is, wasn't checking as root.
2008-02-18T21:20:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	ok, i have found the files in /var/spool/cups. i had previously been looking under cups-pdf instead, that's why i hadnt found them. i could manually delete those, each time, as root, but that's not terribly nice. is there another way to delete _completed_ print jobs as the user that did them, or will those files get rotated and eventually disappear, say after... x number of days, a week or something?
2008-02-18T21:22:00.000Z	Lettuc3	amenado	hmm. ah well, i guess i could make a bootup script that would take care of that... thanks anyway. at least now i know where they are (had somewhat assumed they would be listed under the cups-pdf printer, which is what i'd used). laters.
