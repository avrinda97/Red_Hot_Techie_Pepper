2010-05-22T22:15:00.000Z	awaad		What is the Ubuntu runlevel which doesn't use GUI, Is it run level 3 ??
2010-05-22T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	no, ubuntu runs at default 2, you have to disable gdm to not use the gui
2010-05-22T22:17:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	How can I get to runlevel 3 ?
2010-05-22T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	you don't want to / need to
2010-05-22T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	upstart uses runlevels different than sysv init
2010-05-22T22:18:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	so ?
2010-05-22T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	so you don't want to go to run level 3
2010-05-22T22:19:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	What is the run level which I sould go to to have multiple users, networking and no GUI ?
2010-05-22T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	as I've told you - it doesn't work like that anymore with upstart, ubuntu runs at level 2 by default, if you want to disable the gui, you have to disable the gdm script, not change runlevels
2010-05-22T22:22:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	So, How can I disable the gdm script ?
2010-05-22T22:22:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	update-rc.d
2010-05-22T22:24:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	update-rc.d Didn't do any thing
2010-05-22T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	look at the synatx of how to use it
2010-05-22T22:25:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	I tried update-rc.d gdm disable
2010-05-22T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	awaad	that doesn't look like the right syntax
2010-05-22T22:27:00.000Z	awaad	ikonia	Dr_willis: I used to run init 3, and I am not good in Ubuntu or even in English, Can any one give me the complete and clear way to use Ubuntu without GUI, please ????
