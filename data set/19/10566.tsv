2007-09-18T05:23:00.000Z	jetsaredim		can someone explain to me why I can have an active network connection on a device that networkmanager knows about, but yet have networkmanager think there's no active device?
2007-09-18T05:24:00.000Z	jetsaredim		if i click on the network manager icon it brings up the summary window which says No active connection
2007-09-18T05:24:00.000Z	jetsaredim		err no active device
2007-09-18T05:26:00.000Z	stefg	jetsaredim	if you do not need several network profiles (i.e. you alway connect to the same router) i would uninstall network manager altogether. Does more bad than good in such a case
2007-09-18T05:27:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	i'
2007-09-18T05:29:00.000Z	stefg	jetsaredim	#kubuntu will know about that, speaking of ubuntu (gnome ) there's no problem in uninstalling network-manger. There might be a naming confusion: knetwork manger is different from the nm-applet used for managing multiple network profiles
2007-09-18T05:30:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	o?
2007-09-18T05:31:00.000Z	stefg	jetsaredim	haven't used KDE for years, but i know that KDE had some app named knetwork manager for years, that is different from the lately introduced nm-applet
2007-09-18T05:31:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	i c
2007-09-18T05:45:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	i checked nm-tool and even that is reporting that there's no devices
2007-09-18T05:46:00.000Z	stefg	jetsaredim	what does ifconfig -a tell you?
2007-09-18T05:46:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	that I'm connected
2007-09-18T05:47:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	this is a laptop and its got a wired and wireless - of which the wireless is connected
2007-09-18T06:02:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	any thoughts about my networkmanager issues?
2007-09-18T06:03:00.000Z	stefg	jetsaredim	i did not completly understand your problem yet. So you have a box where the wireless worked out of the box, but the wired ethernaet does not?
2007-09-18T06:04:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	I have a box where both wired and wireless work, but i'm connected via wireless
2007-09-18T06:05:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	I have openvpn setup, but network manager keeps resetting my connection
2007-09-18T06:05:00.000Z	stefg	jetsaredim	try disabling ipv6 first. some routers don't like it
2007-09-18T06:05:00.000Z	jetsaredim	stefg	routers?
