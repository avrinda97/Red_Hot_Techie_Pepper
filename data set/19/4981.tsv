2008-09-22T12:43:00.000Z	bluemind		does anyone have experience in configuring alsa with intel hda-audio to work?
2008-09-22T12:43:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	in ubuntu it works out of the box.
2008-09-22T12:46:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	i installed hardy and it didn't work, now i have read the troubleshooting guide, compiled alsa drivers myself, used the alsa 18rc[something] sh script and no luck so far
2008-09-22T12:47:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	 you need hda_intel enabled i think. in kernel
2008-09-22T12:47:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	how do i go on doing that?
2008-09-22T12:49:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	oh, man, it was a loong time ago when i edited kernel... you should recompile, unless there is a good gui tool for enabling module nowadays. like one in sidux
2008-09-22T12:51:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	i think i installed the kernel modules with the rest of alsa drivers
2008-09-22T12:53:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	sorry, really don't know then. it really should work out of the box. i never had a problem with ubuntu. (now i installed freebsd7 on another slice of disk> noo sound there)
2008-09-22T12:54:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	ok, maybe i just have to wait for some updates or something, i tried intrepid live-cd and the sound didn't work there either
2008-09-22T12:55:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	what is the configuration of that computer? motherboard, chipset, soundcard..
2008-09-22T12:57:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	motherboard is asrock wolfdale1333-glan/m2, soundcard is Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01), uses realtek alc662 codek i think
2008-09-22T12:57:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	and sudo /etc/init.d/alsasound status shows that snd-hda-intel is loaded, alsamixer fails to load though
2008-09-22T12:58:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	i have ich6 family sound card. perhaps, that hardware is too new for linux :)
2008-09-22T12:58:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	aplay -l says that it can't find any soundcards
2008-09-22T12:59:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	i really have no clue what should you do...
2008-09-22T12:59:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	maybe, seems like i have to wait for intrepid and hope that it has better support for my soundcard
2008-09-22T13:11:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	irssi?
2008-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	radovich	bluemind	that was the one! i could not remmember the name. thanx, man
2008-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	bluemind	radovich	np :)
