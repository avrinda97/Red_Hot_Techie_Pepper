2008-08-16T00:34:00.000Z	bewst1		I got some packages from hardy-backports or hardy-proposed that messed up my system, so I removed those repositories from sources.list.  How do I get the versions of those packages that are provided by my currently-selected repos?
2008-08-16T00:35:00.000Z	bewst1		more importantly, how do I get rid of packages from those old repos?
2008-08-16T00:37:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	If you go into synaptic, you can manually downgrade the versions, you can do it through apt-get too.  Or you could remove them, then reinstall them (and the new versions you install will be in your current repos)
2008-08-16T00:38:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	The problem is finding the packages to downgrade.  But on my 10th try googling I found http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-224348.html which is the answer.
2008-08-16T00:38:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	I'm not sure I understand.  the packages aren't in the repos currently?
2008-08-16T00:39:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	I removed some repos from my sources.list.  Those repos had resulted in "upgrades" to (apparently broken versions of) some packages
2008-08-16T00:40:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	the trick is finding out what needs to be downgraded
2008-08-16T00:40:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	What packages do you want to install instead?
2008-08-16T00:40:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	the old versions of the same packages that are supplied by my currently selected repos.  If you really want to understand, read the link I quoted you because that guy had the same problem.
2008-08-16T00:40:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	If you remove those repos, go into synaptic, and view by... section,... I think.  You'll see "local or obsolete" packages, those are ones that aren't in current repos
2008-08-16T00:41:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	let me look at that
2008-08-16T00:43:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	I can't find "Local" or "Obsolete" in sections.
2008-08-16T00:43:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	or anywhere else in synaptic for that matter.  Did I overlook something?
2008-08-16T00:44:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	It's Local and obsolete.  But... it might not be "sections" I haven't used synaptic in ages.  It'll be in the left column, you'll see "installed" "not installed" etc.  Its one of those, whatever "view by" that is.
2008-08-16T00:44:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	Also, you'll need to reload your package list, after removign the offending repositories.
2008-08-16T00:45:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	OK found it under  "Status" (not sections)
2008-08-16T00:45:00.000Z	Flannel	bewst1	ah, status would make sense, yes.
2008-08-16T00:46:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	Yep, there they all are.  Nice; I had pretty much given up on Synaptic; it's good to know that it's still useful for something
2008-08-16T00:46:00.000Z	bewst1	Flannel	thanks a lot!
