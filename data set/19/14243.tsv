2004-10-11T08:18:00.000Z	Kamion		it does
2004-10-11T08:18:00.000Z	Kamion		boot from the CD, run up to partitioning, switch to tty2, chroot, fix whatever you want
2004-10-11T08:19:00.000Z	Kamion		something more automatic will happen at some point
2004-10-11T08:19:00.000Z	Atticus	Kamion	i have no idea what tty2, chroot, or really anything else means.. ive always used windows until i installed ubuntu linux
2004-10-11T08:20:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	tty2 = the console you get from alt-f2
2004-10-11T08:24:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	so, you booted Windows from grub, and then when you rebooted grub was gone? or something else?
2004-10-11T08:25:00.000Z	Atticus	Kamion	yes i chose to boot windows xp from grub, then grub dissapeared
2004-10-11T08:25:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	listen to rburton, sounds like he knows more :)
2004-10-11T11:24:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	yep
2004-10-11T11:26:00.000Z	Atticus	Kamion	where is the synaptic browser located in the desktop, i cant find it
2004-10-11T12:06:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	did you 'chmod +x /home/<whatever>/j2re-blah.bin
2004-10-11T12:07:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	makes the file executable
2004-10-11T13:26:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	we'll probably be putting something into the installer before release to do that automatically, if I have time; Hoary will I think have a graphical interface to mounting partitions
2004-10-11T13:27:00.000Z	Atticus	Kamion	that is good to hear, awesome work by the way im really liking ubuntu
2004-10-11T13:32:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	there is a known bug about that, I think, it's something to do with the drive order in grub
2004-10-11T13:32:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	I believe it's assigned to me (cjwatson@canonical.com) if you want to search for it
2004-10-13T09:59:00.000Z	Atticus	Kamion	what is the lowest end computer that ubuntu has run stabaly on?
2004-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	Kamion	Atticus	don't actually know for i386; people have run it on blue-and-white G3s, which are at the very bottom end of the supported powerpc spectrum
2004-10-13T10:01:00.000Z	Atticus	Kamion	Ubuntu runs as smooth as it does on my 3.2ghz 1gb ram box as this 500mhz box, i commend you for that!
