2007-06-28T16:41:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		it was at that site i read this command: "deb http://download.skype.com/linux/repos/debian/ stable non-free"
2007-06-28T16:41:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i've also tried to replace "deb" to "dpkg"
2007-06-28T16:42:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		am i pathetic?
2007-06-28T16:42:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	its not a command its a setting to put in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-06-28T16:43:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		am i supposed to know how to add a command to that list?
2007-06-28T16:44:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	varka	do you know how that is performed?
2007-06-28T16:45:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	"gksudo /etc/apt/sources.list" then copy&paste it at the end of the file, save the file and run the command "sudo apt-get update"
2007-06-28T16:46:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	varka	"sudo: /etc/apt/sources.list: command not found"
2007-06-28T16:47:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	sry, forgot something "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
2007-06-28T16:48:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	varka	i'm currently installing gedit
2007-06-28T16:48:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	do you have kde?
2007-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	varka	i think it is ubuntu destop
2007-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	if it were, you shouldnt have to install gedit as it is part of the standardinstallation
2007-06-28T16:50:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	varka	my problem might be that the gui i'm using now is installed on a server version of ubuntu
2007-06-28T16:51:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	then its ubuntu server, not ubuntu desktop....., alter the command to "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"
2007-06-28T16:55:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	varka	may i show you the output?
2007-06-28T16:56:00.000Z	varka	Bo^Dick	here is everything you should do
