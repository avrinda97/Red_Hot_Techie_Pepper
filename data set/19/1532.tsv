2011-01-08T07:40:00.000Z	em		I have this key on my laptop that's like the wireless key or something, if i click it, the wireless connection disconnects and if i click it again it connecgts. Anyway it has a little light on it, and it keeps flashing red and white.
2011-01-08T07:41:00.000Z	em		i wonder if it's noral to flash or if it's supposed to be always white.
2011-01-08T07:41:00.000Z	Sriram	em	It's normal
2011-01-08T07:41:00.000Z	em	Sriram	oh okay.
2011-01-08T07:41:00.000Z	Sriram	em	Same thing happens to me, except it's bule and red
2011-01-08T07:41:00.000Z	em	Sriram	is it like white is down and red is up or something?
2011-01-08T07:41:00.000Z	Sriram	em	Don't think so
2011-01-08T07:42:00.000Z	em	Sriram	it's not like a steady thing it sort of is a blink that seems to mean it's doing something.
2011-01-08T07:42:00.000Z	em	Sriram	sometimes it's steady and sometimes it's blinking ike it looks like it's really working, if you get me.
2011-01-08T07:42:00.000Z	Sriram	em	What laptop do you have?
2011-01-08T07:43:00.000Z	Sriram	em	One sec will do some research on that and ping you

2011-01-08T07:47:00.000Z	Sriram	em	It's normal, just that when data is bieng transferred, like when you're loading a page it blinks
2011-01-08T07:47:00.000Z	Sriram	em	No clue why, but
2011-01-08T07:47:00.000Z	Sriram	em	I know it is a little annoying

2011-01-08T07:48:00.000Z	em	Sriram	it's not too bad, annoying wise, i just got curious. Yeah it's mildly annoying if i think about it :) but i usually do not.
