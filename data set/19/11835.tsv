2005-11-18T06:28:00.000Z	krogoth64		firstly, I'm accessing it from windows :)
2005-11-18T06:29:00.000Z	krogoth64		I want to have the full desktop displayed on another computer
2005-11-18T06:29:00.000Z	krogoth64		yes
2005-11-18T06:29:00.000Z	krogoth64		I want to be able to leave azureus running overnight while my desktop is shut down, and then be able to reconnect to it
2005-11-18T06:29:00.000Z	krogoth64		on windows, the desktop
2005-11-18T06:29:00.000Z	krogoth64		I have the cygwin x server
2005-11-18T06:30:00.000Z	krogoth64		does ubuntu have good support for vnc?
2005-11-18T06:31:00.000Z	krogoth64		what do I need to get it up?
2005-11-18T06:31:00.000Z	krogoth64		as long as they run on linux and I see them on windows I don't care what it does
2005-11-18T06:32:00.000Z	krogoth64		and it runs the vnc server?
2005-11-18T06:32:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	i tried VNC (system -> preferences -> remote desktop) and it worked like a charm from another ubuntu machine
2005-11-18T06:39:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	i opened my pc1 with System->Preferences->Remote Desktop, [x]  allow other users... then on PC2 type "vncviewer <ip of pc2>:"
2005-11-18T06:40:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	you dont need to reboot !
2005-11-18T06:41:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	sorry, i got it know. dunno how to automate vnc-server to be run when boot-up, sry
2005-11-18T06:43:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	do you mean the pc that you want to use through vnc has no monitor ?
2005-11-18T06:43:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	and you want vnc-server to start on boot ?
2005-11-18T06:43:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	sry, never done that :)
2005-11-18T06:44:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	hmm, i think so, cause vnc shows u a xwindows session...
2005-11-18T06:45:00.000Z	oskude	krogoth64	you mean connect to a xserver and log in as a user... dunno, sry
