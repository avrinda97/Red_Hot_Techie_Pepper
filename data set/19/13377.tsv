2005-04-18T10:26:00.000Z	closure		or just use root terminal
2005-04-18T10:27:00.000Z	closure		you can screw yourself up real nice
2005-04-18T10:27:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	you couldn't do that with sudo?
2005-04-18T10:27:00.000Z	closure	andrewski	yeah but it seems harder to me when you have to type sudo and think aobut it
2005-04-18T10:28:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	well, a good lesson is to think about every command you type as root. :)
2005-04-18T10:28:00.000Z	closure	andrewski	yeah
2005-04-18T10:28:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	but typing five characters doesn't really help that AND is a nuisance. :P
2005-04-18T10:29:00.000Z	closure	andrewski	yeah i just figure the nuisance of it will teach you to stay out of root unless you damn well need to do something
2005-04-18T10:29:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	well, if you need to do many somethings, it's downright counterproductive.
2005-04-18T10:30:00.000Z	closure	andrewski	yeah it most certainly is. but if you don't know what you're doing you're better off taking your time to begin with
2005-04-18T10:30:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	"taking your time" to think about what you do as root. :P
2005-04-18T10:30:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	sorry, i'm not trying to troll; sudo's use just seems limited.
2005-04-18T10:30:00.000Z	closure	andrewski	i'm agreeing with you i was just letting him know being logged in as root it's not safe
2005-04-18T10:31:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	*potentially* not safe, but there are simple precautions.
2005-04-18T10:40:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	are you installing kde apps?
2005-04-18T10:40:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	well, perhaps the menu needs to be regenerated?  dunno how....
2005-04-18T10:40:00.000Z	closure	andrewski	yeah i'd imagine maybe a reboot would do it
2005-04-18T10:41:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	a logout should suffice.
2005-04-18T10:41:00.000Z	andrewski	closure	don't reboot if you don't have to... and you usually don't unless you upgrade your kernel. :)
