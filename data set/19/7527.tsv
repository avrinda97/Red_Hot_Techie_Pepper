2008-01-29T08:10:00.000Z	groven1021		while trying to configure x server and get kicked out for overwriting possible-customised configuration file.  not sure what this means but it happens when I get to the monitor color information
2008-01-29T08:11:00.000Z	groven1021		I have no idea
2008-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	If i understand you correctly, you got the notice you were overriding a possibly customized file?
2008-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	groven1021		yes
2008-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	groven1021		requinb5, yes I think so
2008-01-29T08:12:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	That's what happens when you use dpkg-reconfigure to GUI re-do the X server when you have previously manually edited xorg.conf
2008-01-29T08:13:00.000Z	groven1021		how do I do that requin
2008-01-29T08:13:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	Shouldn't have affected anything
2008-01-29T08:14:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	i assume you used 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' ?
2008-01-29T08:14:00.000Z	groven1021		requin, yes
2008-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	and it kicks you out with that error when you get to the moniter section?
2008-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	groven1021		requin, yes
2008-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	groven1021		requin, it's an ati card
2008-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	Um, are you sure it isn't just finished?
2008-01-29T08:16:00.000Z	groven1021		requin, no, it says ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ at the bottom after the warning
2008-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	 Try restarting X and see if that fixes the problem you were trying to fix
2008-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	groven1021	bazhang	yes
2008-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	groven1021		ok, how do I restart x?
2008-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	RequinB5	groven1021	oh, liveCD
