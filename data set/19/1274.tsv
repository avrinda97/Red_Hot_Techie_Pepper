2011-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	bromium		can sill anybody help me with privoxy? my comp is connected to a wi-fi network (i'm using a wifi router). i wnat to set up on my kids' comp privoxy and dansguardian. but no success so far
2011-05-02T14:01:00.000Z	bromium		well, i've read articles and manuals accroding to them squid is slower than privoxy
2011-05-02T14:01:00.000Z	bromium		the problem i doesn't work
2011-05-02T14:01:00.000Z	bromium		looks like i've got to set up iptables, too. done as in manuals - no connection, no internet or no proxibiting bad sites
2011-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	bromium		i need privoxy only for a local machine to make it work with dansquardian
2011-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	maxillusionist	bromium	could you tell me why u need privoxy
2011-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	bromium	kellnola	privoxy is also simple in settings, but nothing works. i even tried tinyproxy. looks like i'm doing something wrong. i suspect i can't setup iptables correctly
2011-05-02T14:04:00.000Z	bromium		ok, any suggestions? i know that privoxy works as an adblock, too. what i need is a lightweight simple solution for parental control
2011-05-02T14:04:00.000Z	bromium		but this seems to be a pain in the ass on ubuntu
2011-05-02T14:04:00.000Z	bromium		tried several things, though
2011-05-02T14:05:00.000Z	bromium		firewall? what firewall i'm not using any unless there's a preinstalled one in lubuntu
2011-05-02T14:06:00.000Z	maxillusionist		firewall is already installed with it
2011-05-02T14:06:00.000Z	maxillusionist		with all linux
2011-05-02T14:07:00.000Z	maxillusionist		wat is that called throttle in linux
2011-05-02T14:08:00.000Z	maxillusionist		fahmida it is in temp i guess
2011-05-02T14:08:00.000Z	maxillusionist		go to file manager then to temp
2011-05-02T14:09:00.000Z	bromium		so in order to run a browser through proxy just changing browser settings doesn't work
2011-05-02T14:09:00.000Z	maxillusionist		fahmida u doewnloaded those with firefox ??
2011-05-02T14:10:00.000Z	maxillusionist	bromium	have u tried foxyproxy
