2009-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	Intel sucks for graphics by the way
2009-04-26T09:02:00.000Z	buptlpf	sebsebseb	Do you know any fix to solve it?
2009-04-26T09:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	8.10  wireless was a rather common issue,  now it seems Intel is for 9.04 hum
2009-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	i'll have a look at link hold on
2009-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	buptlpf	sebsebseb	I have not  met wireless issue in 8.10...I am considering if i need go back to 810
2009-04-26T09:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	well  I expect you didn't even do 9.04 on Ext4?
2009-04-26T09:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	 I gave the link a brief look, looks like there aren't really any fixes yet
2009-04-26T09:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	that are available in the Ubuntu repo
2009-04-26T09:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	going back to 8.10  would be alright,   not that much in 9.04 anyway,  nothing worth it as such,   except Ext4 for those that have that set up
2009-04-26T09:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	8.10 has another year of suppourt.  and 9.10 is out end of October
2009-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	buptlpf	sebsebseb	Ok,thanks for your kindly help
2009-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	this computer I will clean install and  do  9.04 with  Ext4 soonish.  I been trying when in development.   the other computer is either staying 8.04  or going 8.10,  probably going 8.10,  but 9.04 nah
2009-04-26T09:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	unless it's going 9.10 in the future without a clean isntall, meaning I would have to upgrade through 9.04
2009-04-26T09:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	just want to point out,  with  Ubuntu it's not about what is new, it's about what is suppourted
2009-04-26T09:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	buptlpf	you can always  go  back to 8.10 and  try 9.04 again when there is  a proper fix for the Intel graphics issues
