2008-07-27T05:07:00.000Z	alraune	zyrorl	have an answer already ?
2008-07-27T05:07:00.000Z	zyrorl		no
2008-07-27T05:07:00.000Z	zyrorl		:(
2008-07-27T05:08:00.000Z	zyrorl		still hoping someone will help me, its pretty messed up:(, i dont want to lose all my files on the ubuntu file system, i can copy most of the ntfs by forcing to mount and then copying over smb or ftp back to my other pc
2008-07-27T05:08:00.000Z	alraune	zyrorl	if you can force-mount via ubunru cd, you need an extra medium, e.g. usb-hd to backup your files
2008-07-27T05:09:00.000Z	zyrorl	alraune	- i could do that, but then how do i back up my ubuntu install...
2008-07-27T05:09:00.000Z	alraune	zyrorl	if you got a second pc, you could attach the hd from it to ypour messed machine for backup, much faster
2008-07-27T05:10:00.000Z	zyrorl	alraune	- its a notebook.. so not easily
2008-07-27T05:11:00.000Z	alraune	zyrorl	I see, did you simply power off machine (cold shutdown) before problem occured ?
2008-07-27T05:11:00.000Z	zyrorl		no
2008-07-27T05:11:00.000Z	zyrorl		it was a normal reboot, clicked on power button, reboot... it rebooted and never game back
2008-07-27T05:14:00.000Z	alraune	zyrorl	just a moment, checking something..
2008-07-27T05:17:00.000Z	alraune	zyrorl	I just googeld ntfscheck, seems there is a poss. to check an ntfs system from live cd, want to giv it a try ?
2008-07-27T05:19:00.000Z	zyrorl		i'll test that
2008-07-27T05:21:00.000Z	alraune		﻿zyrorl : ?
2008-07-27T05:28:00.000Z	zyrorl	alraune	- i managed to mount the ubuntu image as a loopdisk so i'm going to just copy the fs over to my other pc and reformat, and a few other vista folders from the ntfs partition
2008-07-27T05:28:00.000Z	zyrorl		guess nuking it will just be easier
2008-07-27T05:28:00.000Z	alraune		﻿SergeantPony: did you install neccessary codecs ?
