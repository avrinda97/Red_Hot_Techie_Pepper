2007-01-17T06:38:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	does this just record screen shots?
2007-01-17T06:38:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	no
2007-01-17T06:38:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	I have it installed
2007-01-17T06:39:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	it looks like a "fraps" program like on windows...
2007-01-17T06:40:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	i don't want to see what i clicked, i want it to click it again for me
2007-01-17T06:40:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	oh, like a macro recorder. I don't know any of those.
2007-01-17T06:40:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	yeah...
2007-01-17T07:00:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	what's that task you want to automate?
2007-01-17T07:01:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	repeated mouse clicks
2007-01-17T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	I don't know xmacro, but I'd look at the list of files in the package (dpkg -L xmacro) and at the docs in /usr/share/doc/xmacro
2007-01-17T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	there must be a better way to solve your problem than recording mouseclicks.
2007-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	sry, I don't know what you mean by runescape
2007-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	good
2007-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	all i need is something that will record my mouse clicks (1 or 2) so i don't need to be at my computer
2007-01-17T07:16:00.000Z	soundray	Tux	what is that going to accomplish, though?
2007-01-17T07:17:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	fun?
2007-01-17T07:17:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	wealth?
2007-01-17T07:17:00.000Z	Tux	soundray	haha who cares, I need help with it
