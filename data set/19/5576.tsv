2008-06-03T22:41:00.000Z	vscott		no it is not listed in Tools > Addon's > pluggin tab
2008-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	vscott		I installed sun-java-jre-6 from synaptic
2008-06-03T22:43:00.000Z	vscott		yeah that
2008-06-03T22:43:00.000Z	vscott		:)
2008-06-03T22:43:00.000Z	vscott		and the openjdk one
2008-06-03T22:43:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	Did you install sun-java6-plugin?
2008-06-03T22:37:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	That sounds like a serverside error
2008-06-03T22:38:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	is java in about:plugins?
2008-06-03T22:39:00.000Z	vscott	Flannel	i don't understand your question
2008-06-03T22:39:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	in firefox, browse to `about:plugins` and see if java is listed
2008-06-03T22:42:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	Have you installed the plugin?
2008-06-03T22:43:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	you mean sun-java6-jre?
2008-06-03T22:49:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	Did you install that package?
2008-06-03T22:50:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	and have you restarted firefox?
2008-06-03T22:53:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	Make sure you've selected the sun java as your choice, not the openjdk (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java on how to do this if you don't know).
2008-06-03T22:54:00.000Z	vscott	Flannel	I have done that, but what I am about to do is remove all traces of java and start over
2008-06-03T22:54:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	that's a good idea as well.  Remove to "completely remove" them, not just remove
2008-06-03T22:54:00.000Z	Flannel	vscott	But, I've gotta run.  If you still have problems, someone else can help
2008-06-03T22:55:00.000Z	vscott	Flannel	k
