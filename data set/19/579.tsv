2012-02-16T05:40:00.000Z	Canadian1296	altin	Run "sudo apt-get clean" then "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get upgrade" then "sudo apt-get autoremove"
2012-02-16T05:41:00.000Z	Canadian1296	altin	Then let me know if it works
2012-02-16T05:42:00.000Z	altin	Canadian1296	still the same error, im trying to install gimp here
2012-02-16T05:42:00.000Z	altin	Canadian1296	gimp was installed but then removed from an update :/
2012-02-16T05:43:00.000Z	Canadian1296	altin	I know. I'm trying to fix the dependancies. Did you run the 4 commands i gave you in order?
2012-02-16T05:43:00.000Z	altin	Canadian1296	yes I did
2012-02-16T05:45:00.000Z	Canadian1296	altin	then try "sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-0" ( zykotick9 It might fix his dependancy issue)
2012-02-16T05:45:00.000Z	altin	Canadian1296	libglib2.0-0 is already the newest version.
2012-02-16T05:54:00.000Z	altin	Canadian1296	I just posted what you asked in pastebin...
2012-02-16T06:05:00.000Z	altin	Canadian1296	_Marcus fixed the problem
2012-02-16T06:06:00.000Z	Canadian1296	altin	Well I didn't really do much, but glad to hear you got it :)
