2012-06-18T23:03:00.000Z	matthewlawson3		Anyone? My Windows Pcs are on the same network as my Ubuntu machine and they can access the Linux machine as long as the host name stays Ubuntu. When I change the hostname, however, then the Windows machine does not recognize the name change and does not access the machine, even after I restart it. Any ideas?
2012-06-18T23:05:00.000Z	matthewlawson3		How can I get Windows to resolve my new Ubuntu host name?
2012-06-18T23:06:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	what version on windows?
2012-06-18T23:07:00.000Z	matthewlawson3	Meridious	Windows 7
2012-06-18T23:08:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file should contain those resolutions

2012-06-18T23:08:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	you could add an entry to that
2012-06-18T23:09:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	adding a hostname resolution to a windows host file is pretty similar to adding one in ubuntu
2012-06-18T23:11:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	tell me if that works. If not, try entering ipconfig /flushdns into a cmd prompt
2012-06-18T23:12:00.000Z	matthewlawson3	Meridious	this is the first time I have edited hosts file in Windows. Where do I need to put the new line?
2012-06-18T23:14:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	the format is exactly the same. just put a new line with  <IP> <HOSTNAME>
2012-06-18T23:15:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	doubt it
2012-06-18T23:15:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	couldnt hurt though
2012-06-18T23:15:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	win or *nix
2012-06-18T23:18:00.000Z	matthewlawson3	Meridious	going to restart brb
2012-06-18T23:29:00.000Z	matthewlawson3	Meridious	I flushed DNS as well and still it is not changing the name. I cannot access the Linux machine on the Windows side however
2012-06-18T23:31:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	hmmm
2012-06-18T23:31:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	I am running out of ideas :P
2012-06-18T23:33:00.000Z	Meridious	matthewlawson3	sorry I could not be of more help
