2008-05-01T23:45:00.000Z	ramkumar	Hasone	what's the problem again?
2008-05-01T23:47:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	when I open a window in nautilus, it opens visibly enough for me to see the window opening, and then immediately closes.
2008-05-01T23:49:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-1.0/libgnome-mount-so: undefined symbol: nautilus_file_info_get_drive.
2008-05-01T23:50:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	I have to admit, that doesn't sound very encouraging to me ><
2008-05-01T23:51:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	how would I do that?
2008-05-01T23:52:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	on it
2008-05-01T23:53:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	nautilus an related things have a star next to them. does that mean anything?
2008-05-01T23:54:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	it seems to be doing a bunch of installing off of the hardy heron cd i burned earlier successfully.
2008-05-01T23:57:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	I can't. no internet. wifi isn't working and my ethernet port got fried a few fears ago.
2008-05-01T23:57:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	nope, sorry.
2008-05-01T23:58:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	if you or anyone else can fix my interwebs, I shall be eternally grateful.
2008-05-02T00:07:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	thefish, kousotu, it's going faster than I expected.
2008-05-02T00:13:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	kousotu, I respect the philosophy of debian. even if ubuntu no share it. btw, thefish, I'm up to 26%
2008-05-02T00:37:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	should i use something besides sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
2008-05-02T00:44:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	i could burn another one.
2008-05-02T00:48:00.000Z	Hasone	ramkumar	when I run update manager, I have a bunch of packages that are grayed out. might that make some sort of difference?
