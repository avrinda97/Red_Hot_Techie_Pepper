2011-05-07T15:58:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	what was your problem?
2011-05-07T15:59:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	what device was it supposed to find?
2011-05-07T16:00:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	two usb soundcards and one onboard soundcard.  all are showing up under alsa
2011-05-07T16:01:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	do you recall seeing any error messages upon boot? Check /var/log/boot.log
2011-05-07T16:01:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	in fact i can use ultramixer through alsa but it instantly becomes so slow that it's unusable, so i need to find a way back to the setup i had before
2011-05-07T16:01:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	i'll look
2011-05-07T16:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	nope, no errors
2011-05-07T16:03:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	and what sort of approval notifiers is there?
2011-05-07T16:04:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	approval notifiers?
2011-05-07T16:04:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	well, as in "Starting OSS... [OK] ?"
2011-05-07T16:06:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	/var/log/boot.log is pretty empty actually, 4 lines
2011-05-07T16:07:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	ok then, just go to /etc/init.d/ and see which file is associated with initiating the sound and whatever
2011-05-07T16:08:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	alsa-mixer-save and pulseaudio look relevant
2011-05-07T16:10:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	I don't think that you previously modified pulseaudio. then it must be alsa-mixer-saver
2011-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	not sure, ubuntu studio has pulseaudio by default
2011-05-07T16:12:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	well then, see the manual for pulseaudio and it should tell ou where it reads its configurations from
2011-05-07T16:14:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	thanks :)
2011-05-07T16:16:00.000Z	Chepoll	Gothfunc	I don't really know the solution. You asked for where to start, and this could be a starting point for the debugging.
2011-05-07T16:17:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Chepoll	it's a good plan, i was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to start.  thanks
