2010-09-06T04:14:00.000Z	BlaDe^		can I reinstall ssh without being kicked off?
2010-09-06T04:14:00.000Z	BlaDe^		if my friend can get on, he's better with linux than me
2010-09-06T04:15:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	Looks like you are trying to use credential "Blade" accourding to postie, is that the right user per sshd on xxxx?
2010-09-06T04:15:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	 definitely
2010-09-06T04:36:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	 yeah /etc/postfix/sasl exists but there's no smtpd.conf there
2010-09-06T04:19:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	 http://pastie.org/1140470
2010-09-06T04:21:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	note syslog and daemon.log ore top two. What's in say daemon.log (of the two)?
2010-09-06T04:22:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	 the entire file (if I cat it ) is about Sep  5 19:22:49 spooshi dhclient: No DHCPOFFERS received. --- and DHCPDISCOVER
2010-09-06T04:24:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	is your box trying to fetch a dhcp address? Could it be that the machine no longer knows who it is? If so, that might explain why your inbound connect requests aren't actually going to spooni (xxxx?)
2010-09-06T04:25:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	 i think that's correct yes
2010-09-06T04:29:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	usually you have to have a static (or at least, not changing, ip address to be able to ssh into and for mail to be able to figure out "who I am". You need to sort out why all of the dhcp requests. Why did dhcp lease expire? Why aren't you getting a renewal? That sort of thing...
2010-09-06T04:30:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	Sep  5 17:24:45 spooshi postfix/smtpd[30611]: fatal: no SASL authentication mechanisms  -- for mail
2010-09-06T04:33:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	SASL authentication is a different problem. Has to do with In postfix, this might be the mech-list in /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
2010-09-06T04:35:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	 the sasl folder is empty
2010-09-06T04:35:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	postfix? if not, I run out ofexperience quick... sri
2010-09-06T04:40:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	following the johnny.chadda.se article on mail-server-howto-? Good level of detail, helped me...
2010-09-06T04:41:00.000Z	BlaDe^	cagordon	nope, but a lot of services are playing up I don't think it's specifically a mail issue
2010-09-06T04:42:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	got to get the ip-address thing settled down. Can't be trashing about looking for a dhcp lease...
2010-09-06T04:44:00.000Z	cagordon	BlaDe^	np & lots of luck |patience :)
