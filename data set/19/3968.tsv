2009-05-06T10:34:00.000Z	woody_		installed catalyst on my hp laptop with ubuntu 9.04 and now it crashes after ubuntu boot logo is done. I have ati 200m
2009-05-06T10:36:00.000Z	woody_		is there any way to reset ati driver back to default ? im running off the live disk on the laptop now
2009-05-06T10:37:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	How did you install catalyst?
2009-05-06T10:38:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Can you remove catalyst via Add/Remove as well?
2009-05-06T10:40:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Can you open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see if there is a line in the Section called "Devices" that says "Driver"?
2009-05-06T10:40:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Oh, wait, you're on a LiveCD, that won't work.  You first will have to mount your original hard disk.
2009-05-06T10:40:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Do you know how to mount the drive?
2009-05-06T10:41:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Show me the output, in a pastebin, of: sudo fdisk -l
2009-05-06T10:47:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Almost, but not quite.  I don't want the output of "fdisk", I want the output of "sudo fdisk -l"
2009-05-06T10:48:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Okay, that's right.  But I've now forgotten: what was the issue you were having?
2009-05-06T10:49:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Nevermind, I remember now
2009-05-06T10:51:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Type this command: sudo mkdir -p /media/disk; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/disk
2009-05-06T10:51:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Let me know when you've done that.  Tell me if there are any errors.
2009-05-06T10:52:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Okay you've done it?
2009-05-06T10:53:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	That's okay.  What's the output of this command: ls /media/disk/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-05-06T10:57:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Okay, do you remember the name of the package you installed?
2009-05-06T10:57:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	Okay, one second.
2009-05-06T10:59:00.000Z	RedSocrates	woody_	I'm going to private message you, okay?
