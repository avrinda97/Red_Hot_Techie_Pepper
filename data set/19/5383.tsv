2008-07-18T17:36:00.000Z	shah		hi guys, i hav installed bittorrent using apt-get install bittorrent, but i could'nt find bittorrent application anywhere, plz help
2008-07-18T17:37:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	you need to install a bittorrent client application with a gui
2008-07-18T17:39:00.000Z	shah	MeniShevitz	azureus is 146 MB of size :(
2008-07-18T17:46:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	are you downloading to a local disk?
2008-07-18T17:47:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	actually it sounds like a bad connection/bad qe on your router.
2008-07-18T17:47:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	try a different torrent client and tell us if it still happens.
2008-07-18T17:48:00.000Z	shah	MeniShevitz	ok which one to try?
2008-07-18T17:48:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	azureus is good.
2008-07-18T17:49:00.000Z	shah	MeniShevitz	im downloading  on a windows partition, which is automounted everytime i restart my system, is that a problem??
2008-07-18T17:50:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	yes!!!!!!
2008-07-18T17:50:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	you're better off downloading to an ext3 partition, or to a remote share.
2008-07-18T17:51:00.000Z	shah	MeniShevitz	so what to do now, how to increase my partition size of ext3??
2008-07-18T17:51:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	first boot into windows and in the computer manager (under administrative tools either in accessories or control panel) shrink the windows partition.
2008-07-18T17:52:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	afterwards i can't quite help other then to offer using paragon partition manager :)
2008-07-18T17:52:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	use gparted after shrinking the windows partition.
2008-07-18T17:52:00.000Z	shah	MeniShevitz	i hav got enough free space to expand ext3 partition but donno how to do it
2008-07-18T17:53:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	gparted is your friend.
2008-07-18T17:53:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	np, good luck
2008-07-18T17:58:00.000Z	MeniShevitz	shah	i use gnome and am reintroducing myself to ubuntu, sorry man. try to sudo it.
