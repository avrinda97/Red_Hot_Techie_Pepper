2009-10-26T07:14:00.000Z	fabian_		anyone have a clue as to what mys issue is with automounting a 1TB usb drive in 9.04?
2009-10-26T07:15:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	did it automount before?
2009-10-26T07:17:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	so when you plug it in, do you see it in dmesg?
2009-10-26T07:20:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	yes. http://pastie.org/669577
2009-10-26T07:24:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	you can mount it manually?
2009-10-26T07:24:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	yes.
2009-10-26T07:27:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	I am seeing weird stuff in the File Browser under "Computer" the "/" partition is showing up twice as "75.5 GB Media" and I also see it again as "File System"
2009-10-26T07:28:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	it should show up under /media
2009-10-26T07:29:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	I know. But it does not
2009-10-26T07:30:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	do you have any other usb mass storage devices you have tested?
2009-10-26T07:30:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	yes, 2 500GB. They mount fine. Same filesystem. NTFS.
2009-10-26T07:31:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	so if it's the size of the volume, you might try to see that by creating a smaller partition, but my guess is you already have data on the drive
2009-10-26T07:34:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	were any of the other disks GPT?
2009-10-26T07:34:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	no
2009-10-26T07:38:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	I am sooooo sorry. I just figured it out. There is no partition on /dev/sdb . Just data. I did it wrong.  :o(
2009-10-26T07:40:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	nevermind. I was checking the wrong drive. I do have a correct partition. The device is /dev/sdc1
2009-10-26T07:41:00.000Z	thedude42	fabian_	well my guess is that gpt is the issue, but i can't really be sure
2009-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	I agree. Well thank you for the help. I will just mount the damn thing in /etc/fstab .
2009-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	fabian_	thedude42	have a good night.
