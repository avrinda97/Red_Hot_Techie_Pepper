2006-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	dave_cb		is there a default text editor for kde?
2006-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	dave_cb		like gedit?
2006-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	I'm sure there is, but try asking in #kubuntu
2006-04-16T13:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	"sudo gedit /etc/atp/sources.list" in a terminal
2006-04-16T13:26:00.000Z	dave_cb	Madpilot	 already did it :P
2006-04-16T13:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	have you created a root pw/user?
2006-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	yeah, that's what vim does
2006-04-16T13:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	are you running Kubuntu?
2006-04-16T13:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	Oh. No wonder gedit didn't work, it's Gnome's default text editor. Sorry.
2006-04-16T14:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	lay off the Enter key, please...
2006-04-16T15:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	dave_cb	Very Insane - it's a complex text editor - try nano
