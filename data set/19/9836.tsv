2006-10-24T08:53:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	check this out ... http://customdesign.homelinux.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=39
2006-10-24T08:55:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	with that, Will I be able to adit a pdf file?
2006-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	no just print to a pdf file
2006-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	I didn't mean that, I mean, I have a pdf file and I need to write on it. Do you know what software do I need?
2006-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	sorry I misunderstood your needs. No, I dont know of an app that does that.
2006-10-24T09:09:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	works perfectly! Thanks very much! I never thought that was editable with it because when I had Windows (6 months ago more or less) I couldn't edit well a .pdf with photoshop
2006-10-24T09:12:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	I just have other question. The pdf file has more than one page, how do I go to 2nd one? Sorry for this, I'm noob user with thegimp
2006-10-24T09:13:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	never tried editing a PDF file that way, so you're teaching me something. :-) no idea how to get to a second page. sorry
2006-10-24T09:21:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	if you can asnwer me a question I know how to open more pages of a pdf files. You response will make us find the solution or keep searching (me)
2006-10-24T09:23:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	I suppose so, if you insert a page break between each image
2006-10-24T09:24:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	and how I do that?
2006-10-24T09:24:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	depends on what you're using to make the document that will hold the images I guess?
2006-10-24T09:26:00.000Z	feryana	rbil	(for your records) when you open a pdf file with the gimp, a dialog box popups, then if you want multi pages you will se "Pages" and 1 as default, if the document has 5 pages you should write 1-5 (if you type 5 it will open just the 5th page)
2006-10-24T09:27:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	thanks. nice tip. I've never tried to work with pdf files that way
2006-10-24T09:29:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	very cool indeed
2006-10-24T09:30:00.000Z	rbil	feryana	try something like Open Office Word Processor. Place image on each page then print the doc.
