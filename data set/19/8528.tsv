2007-03-17T13:21:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Yeah, do that.
2007-03-17T13:21:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	That's why we're here. :P
2007-03-17T13:22:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	*Do* make sure you back up your hard drive if you are installing besides Windows.
2007-03-17T13:23:00.000Z	jaycie	Aeolien	nope no windows
2007-03-17T13:23:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Wonderful. It's a lot easier then.
2007-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Indeed.
2007-03-17T13:25:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	What networking do you have? Modem? LAN? PPPOE?
2007-03-17T13:28:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	How old is that computer?
2007-03-17T13:30:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Have you told it to boot from CD?
2007-03-17T13:30:00.000Z	jaycie	Aeolien	i hit install at the boot up screen
2007-03-17T13:31:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	OK, good.
2007-03-17T13:31:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Have you seen any text since then?
2007-03-17T13:31:00.000Z	jaycie	Aeolien	so still need to hit the INSTALL icon?
2007-03-17T13:31:00.000Z	jaycie	Aeolien	i hit the install desktop icon but hav not seen anything since.. just hear cd working
2007-03-17T13:32:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Make sure you double-click. The mouse cursor will turn to a spinning pinwheel while the "Install" window loads.
2007-03-17T13:33:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	I don't see why not.
2007-03-17T13:33:00.000Z	Aeolien	jaycie	Well, it's doing something :P
