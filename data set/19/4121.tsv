2009-04-05T14:10:00.000Z	k0pp		i'm trying to get my second monitor to work.. my main card is an onboard card using the intel driver, the second is a Matrox Millennium PCI.  when i boot my machine, my box freezes up right when GDM is about to start up, it completely freezes.
2009-04-05T14:10:00.000Z	k0pp		any ideas? :/
2009-04-05T14:12:00.000Z	Raulin	k0pp	tried vesa drivers for you ATI card?
2009-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	k0pp	Raulin	are you suggesting the onboard card is ATI?
2009-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	k0pp		either way, yes i've tried using vesa drivers for both the cards
2009-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	Raulin	k0pp	I just read it wrong, thaught for a second that matrox = radeon.
2009-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	k0pp		hehe
2009-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	Raulin		Have you tried using just the matrox card?
2009-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	k0pp		yeah /k?ubuntu/ is the only distro that screws me over on that
2009-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	k0pp	Raulin	yeah, fails.
2009-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	k0pp		it wont boot whenever the matrox card is plugged in
2009-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	k0pp		it ahs to be out of my box for my machine to boot
2009-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	Raulin	k0pp	are you installing the matrox card when the computer is booted?
2009-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	k0pp	Raulin	'installing'?  im not sure what exactly you mean by that
2009-04-05T14:16:00.000Z	Raulin	k0pp	inserting the card into the PCI slot while the computer is running...
2009-04-05T14:16:00.000Z	k0pp	Raulin	uhh.. are you sure hot-plugging a video card like that wont screw me over hard?
2009-04-05T14:16:00.000Z	k0pp		lol..
2009-04-05T14:17:00.000Z	Raulin	k0pp	you said that the computer wouldn't boot if the card was in so I was wondering how you got into GDM then.
2009-04-05T14:17:00.000Z	k0pp	Raulin	i power down, unplug the card, and boot back up only using the onboard card
