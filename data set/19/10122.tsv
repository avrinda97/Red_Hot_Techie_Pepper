2010-05-16T02:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	Grub 2 issue I guess
2010-05-16T02:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	or a boot up issue
2010-05-16T02:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	you can check your ISO, if you still have it
2010-05-16T02:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	right ok,  it could be simpally that  10.04, does not like your computer hardware
2010-05-16T02:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	also ATI is a bit,  well it doesn't always work properly with Ubuntu, let's put it that way
2010-05-16T02:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	maybe
2010-05-16T02:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	yep
2010-05-16T02:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	and still supported untill end of October
2010-05-16T02:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	you mean 10.10?  that's actsaully going to be released early, 10/10/10 and yes a Sunday, instead of the 28th
2010-05-16T02:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	well it's ok to put 9.10 back on, and use that, whilst waiting for 10.10
2010-05-16T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	yeah I guess you could install the properitary ATI driver like that, using chroot or something
2010-05-16T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	if you re install 9.10 you can do a seperate /home :)
2010-05-16T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	makes re insalling Ubuntu easier in the future
2010-05-16T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	I am about to help Visualante1  set one up in manual install now
2010-05-16T02:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_OskaR_	ah ok
