2009-12-21T22:23:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	would this help, not sure if this is what you are talking about --> http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Writer_Guide/Print_labels_from_db
2009-12-21T22:24:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	can you not create a csv file from the doc, import that file into calc for use as a db, then generate the lables from there?
2009-12-21T22:30:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	are you trying to install openoffice, I have to ask why you need java becuase I thought you were trying to generate mailing labels from a Writer file
2009-12-21T22:32:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-12-21T22:34:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	do you still need help dude?
2009-12-21T22:34:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	what version of Ubuntu?
2009-12-21T22:34:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	your intsall should already have some OpenOffice apps
2009-12-21T22:36:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	are you trying to install the new version of OpenOffice?
2009-12-21T22:37:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	ok, well I'm confused then, what did you try in Open Office that prompted a dialog box telling you to install java, jre ?
2009-12-21T22:38:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	openoffice.org-writer,sun-java6-jre  openoffice.org-officebean,sun-java6-jre  openoffice.org-java-common,sun-java6-jre  openoffice.org-filter-mobiledev,sun-java6-jre  openoffice.org-base,sun-java6-jre  openoffice.org,sun-java6-jre
2009-12-21T22:40:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	or use synaptic and search for jre, or open office and install from there
2009-12-21T22:41:00.000Z	exodus_ms	haresh_	at command line do   apt-cache search jre
