2011-08-08T19:02:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker		Hey, how comes i can't change the stupid label of the usb stick i installed ubuntu on ? - The name doesn't quite fit the content >.<
2011-08-08T19:03:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker		It's FAT32
2011-08-08T19:04:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	its often a label in the usb stick partition, or a file in the usb that includes the name. repartition and relabel, or add the uuid to your fstab with a different name
2011-08-08T19:14:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	in unity? they are gone. hit the windows key and start typing keywords like "keyboard" or "monitor" and you should get access to what you need
2011-08-08T19:18:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	thats common you have to tell the kernel to rescan for partitions
2011-08-08T19:18:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	partprobe
2011-08-08T19:22:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	have you verified drivers are installed and that you aren't blocked with rfkill
2011-08-08T19:26:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	nothing is blocked except a bluetooth adapter (No need for me to use it at the moment)
2011-08-08T20:38:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	can you connect to an unprotected network. it could be a problem with wpa_supplicatnt
2011-08-08T20:41:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	Attempt to connect to my neighbors wifi (No encryption) resulted in same problem as on my own wifi
2011-08-08T20:45:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	Attempt to connect to my neighbors wifi (No encryption) resulted in same problem as on my own wifi
2011-08-08T20:45:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	usually the atheros is well supported. im not sure what the problem could be. something about the frequencies legally allowed in your country? maybe?
2011-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	the channel should be fine, it works with a Win9x/FreeBSD pc, a media center and some other things that is usually very cranky about the channels
2011-08-08T20:55:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	Any idea? :/
2011-08-08T21:00:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	not really. the things i know to check are that the driver is correct and loaded, that rfkill is off, and that nothing in /etc is preventing network manager from managing the device (if you put stuff in some network related files network manager will yield to manual control) you could try and connect manually to see if that last bit is the problem
2011-08-08T21:02:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	the driver should be ok, it's loaded rfkill is off and about /etc i dunno
2011-08-08T21:03:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	perhaps someone else can help you manually attempt to connect. all i know is iwconfig, but i dont know the wpa_supplicant part of things
2011-08-08T21:04:00.000Z	[HzF]Rocker	escott	ok
2011-08-08T21:45:00.000Z	escott	[HzF]Rocker	see if there is a file in the root of the filesystem that sets the label. i think macs do it that way
