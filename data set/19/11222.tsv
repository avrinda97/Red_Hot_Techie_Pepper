2006-03-13T07:32:00.000Z	Kanalal		can i ask, has anyone been able to get skype to work on breezy?
2006-03-13T07:32:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	sure, no problem :)
2006-03-13T07:32:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	how? ive tried 3 or 4 differnt guides, none of them seem to work
2006-03-13T07:33:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	lemme try to remember what I did to install it..
2006-03-13T07:36:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	if I recall you'll get an error if trying to install the debian package because of a broken dependency, right?
2006-03-13T07:37:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	i think theres a lib version breezy uses thats newer than the one skype does
2006-03-13T07:37:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	if I'm not way off I think I actually opened the .deb and made a new one with the correct dependency..
2006-03-13T07:38:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	hmmn i think thats a bit complicated for me, im a bit of a no0b :S
2006-03-13T07:38:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	I'll remember exactly what I did...just give me a few minutes =)
2006-03-13T07:39:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	ok thanks
2006-03-13T07:54:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	check out http://forum.skype.com/viewtopic.php?t=48295&sid=c797e40679f8c2424171f25bf13e7da6
2006-03-13T07:54:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	thanks
2006-03-13T07:55:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	if you copy the contents of that script to a file, place it in the folder where you have downloaded the .deb and run it using the .deb as a parameter you should be all set :)
2006-03-13T08:23:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	hm...weird...I can't seem to find libqt3c102-mt in my repositories..
2006-03-13T08:24:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	so that error wasn't with seveas' packages?
2006-03-13T08:24:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	i know, it looks as if its been removed
2006-03-13T08:27:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	like i said im new to this, im having trouble adding the repository
2006-03-13T08:30:00.000Z	weedar	Kanalal	what you want to do is just add one of the mirrors to /etc/apt/sources.list  - You can use whatever editor you want as long as you're root :)
2006-03-13T08:54:00.000Z	Kanalal	weedar	i got it working, seems to be through a combination of your post and Seveas's repos, not quite sure how, but it seems ok \o/
