2007-02-03T12:50:00.000Z	flubs		can anyone help me with some problems I'm having installing xml::parser?
2007-02-03T12:50:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 is that the perl package?
2007-02-03T12:50:00.000Z	flubs	unop	yeah, the one from cpan
2007-02-03T12:52:00.000Z	unop	flubs	right ok, are you using cpan/cpanplus to install the package?
2007-02-03T12:53:00.000Z	flubs	unop	no, I'm trying to compile from the tar.gz
2007-02-03T12:54:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 it's better you use cpan/cpanplus to install these packages .. as these package managers will resolve dependencies and whatnot better than if you do it manually
2007-02-03T12:54:00.000Z	flubs	unop	is cpan/cpanplus available from cpan's website?
2007-02-03T12:54:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 yes, off course
2007-02-03T12:58:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 2 seconds
2007-02-03T12:59:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AN/ANDK/CPAN-1.8802.tar.gz
2007-02-03T12:59:00.000Z	flubs	unop	thanks
2007-02-03T13:02:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 :)
2007-02-03T13:03:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 cpan install XML::Parser should do then
2007-02-03T13:04:00.000Z	flubs	unop	I tried cpan xml::parser....I'll try cpan install xml::parser
2007-02-03T13:04:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 beware that CASE is important when it comes to perl packages
2007-02-03T13:06:00.000Z	flubs	unop	right...i should have remembered that...i was trying to install it with webmin the other day and it gave me all kinds of trouble because of the case
2007-02-03T13:06:00.000Z	unop	flubs	 the exact name is XML::Parser
2007-02-04T06:04:00.000Z	flubs	unop	are you still available to answer questions about cpan?
