2009-03-21T06:40:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	that should be more reason to tinker with linux vs. windows.  Linux isn't as intolerant.
2009-03-21T06:42:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	I'd just grab some o'reilly books and learn as you go.  Bazhang has a great link.
2009-03-21T06:43:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	you poor dude...like I said learn as you go, no secrets in ubuntu :)
2009-03-21T06:44:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	whatever you prefer really.  I use a IDE myself.
2009-03-21T06:48:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	I use komodo
2009-03-21T06:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	i'd use crimson editor if I had to suffer thru windows, but I'm ot again...sorry.
2009-03-21T06:58:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	its equivilent to apt-get
2009-03-21T06:58:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	not the same... but similar.
2009-03-21T06:59:00.000Z	Jeruvy	justin__	don't let us distract you,  stick to nano or gedit.
