2006-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	what's the problem
2006-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	I've gone through all the steps to get encrypted dvd playback to work in totem and it still says that libdvdcss doesn't exist or something.
2006-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	It asks "are you sure you've installed libdvdcss?"
2006-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	maybe the disk's knackered. It said that to me when I had a dodgey disk :)
2006-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	if you've followed the appropriate links in..
2006-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	I personally think its a conflicting package.
2006-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	if you've followed what's in there, then you might want to try another DVD
2006-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	The weird part is the same steps were done on my two other boxes and they're working.
2006-07-03T08:36:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	try "sudo apt-get install totem-xine; sudo apt-get --purge remove totem-gstreamer"
2006-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	let me know how that goes
2006-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	says that totem-xine installed and that totem-gstreamer doesn't exist
2006-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	did you "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh"
2006-07-03T08:40:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	Yes of course.
2006-07-03T08:41:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	pfff.
2006-07-03T08:41:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	have you tried another DVD?
2006-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	no I have not
2006-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	Thats not the problem.
2006-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	Jimmey	Const	it works just fine with Mplayer, on the same system?
2006-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	Const	Jimmey	Correct
