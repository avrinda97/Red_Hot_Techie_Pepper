2011-04-09T02:50:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		Wow.
2011-04-09T02:51:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		Irssi just went through the whole channel listing
2011-04-09T02:51:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		Over 1500 people. o_o
2011-04-09T02:51:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		Anyways
2011-04-09T02:52:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		I'm looking for a lightweight desktop environment, kinda like GNOME.
2011-04-09T02:52:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		I need to to run in a way like GNOME, but using as little resource as possible. XFCE isn't an option.
2011-04-09T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	lxde is light
2011-04-09T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	openbox without lxde (lxde uses openbox by default) on its own is even lighter
2011-04-09T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	lxde is used in Lubuntu and is targetted at systems with very low resources
2011-04-09T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	if that is too much I'd try something like puppy or xpud for lightness
2011-06-14T08:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	run:  startopenbox
2011-06-14T08:58:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	ActionParsnip	Command not found.
2011-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	should have: /usr/bin/startopenbox
2011-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	ActionParsnip	Nope.
2011-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	then you should reinstall openbox
2011-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	ActionParsnip	I'll do that now.
2011-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	do you use lxde?
2011-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	ActionParsnip	Nope, I used the minimal ISO
2011-06-14T09:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheLifelessOne	then try just running openbox
