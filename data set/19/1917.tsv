2010-09-01T08:52:00.000Z	heizmann		another question :) Anybody knows a script which install all git component for the Compiz Fusion system??? :) an example of a such script can be downloaded from http://phatandfresh.free.fr/cfinstall.sh (it is in french, very interesting but non maintaining)
2010-09-01T08:54:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	It's just called compiz now, the 'fusion' part has been dropped. This is how to use the compiz build script for git:  sudo apt-get install git-core && git clone git://anongit.compiz.org/users/soreau/scripts && ./scripts/build_compiz++
2010-09-01T08:55:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	:) good news !!! :D !! All is in 1 script???
2010-09-01T08:55:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	That repo has a set of scripts to do different things
2010-09-01T08:55:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	but yes, it builds all compiz components from git with that sscript
2010-09-01T08:56:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	:p hum, good!!! Very good! No problem with this script??? (updating, locales (e.g. french locales), special configurations of x11... ?
2010-09-01T08:57:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	If it fails in any way, it should guide you to the compiz forums or the compiz channels here on irc
2010-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	:) thanks!... but before to exec the command ./scripts/build_compiz++ may I uninstall my actual (git)compiz? :)
2010-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	But there is no special configuration.. if compiz 0.8 is already working for you, this should install compiz 0.9 into a nonstandard prefix, leaving your 0.8 install in tact
2010-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	:) ok... my actual compiz is installed on /usr/local
2010-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	You can do whatever you want but the script should be able to install and run regardless what ever else you have installed
2010-09-01T09:00:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	The script default it /opt/compiz++ but you can change the PREFIX in the script if you like
2010-09-01T09:00:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	:) but if is intalled on /usr/local ??? no problem wih that? Actually, I'm using the smo-script
2010-09-01T09:00:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	(if you know what is it, of course ^^)
2010-09-01T09:00:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	you shouldn't have a problem other than having to setup ccsm after everything is installed
2010-09-01T09:01:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	:) I backup my datas, and let's go =)
2010-09-01T09:01:00.000Z	soreau	heizmann	Great, let me know if you have any trouble with it, in #compiz
2010-09-01T09:02:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	;) okay... bitchx is my friend in a tty, if all crash lol
2010-09-01T09:04:00.000Z	heizmann	soreau	so... it's time to go (continue my encoding with x264 ^^)... and test your script
