2005-03-06T17:30:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Anyone know an FTP command that'll let me GET everything in a directory?
2005-03-06T17:31:00.000Z	WeirdAl		While I'm here
2005-03-06T17:31:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	mget *
2005-03-06T17:35:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	okay stop the transfer and type prompt - this toggles that effect
2005-03-06T12:50:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	why not give us a clue with a full name and path of this file
2005-03-06T12:51:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	okay
2005-03-06T12:51:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	context is always good :)
2005-03-06T12:53:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	you are looking at library files - common resources that might just be used by the program
2005-03-06T12:54:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	type which anjunta
2005-03-06T12:55:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	that will tell you where it lives on the machine before it calls to the /usr/lib/ajunta directory for resources that it wants
2005-03-06T12:56:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	or you could just type /usr/bin/ajunta or because that path (/usr/bin/) is available to you typing ajunta should make it work
2005-03-06T12:59:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	don't be scared, be curious :)
2005-03-06T13:04:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	maybe having a look at this information on file system layout might be useful
2005-03-06T13:04:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	 http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_02.html
2005-03-06T13:04:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	read it and be at one with the file system
2005-05-10T11:42:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	you could try - sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-05-10T11:43:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	that will put you back to the starting point
2005-06-13T14:27:00.000Z	WeirdAl	ompaul	System > Preferences > Removable Drives and Media
2005-08-30T12:23:00.000Z	ompaul	WeirdAl	you can get Warty and install that
