2011-02-03T06:31:00.000Z	K3rmit		is ubuntu 10.10 the best download?
2011-02-03T06:32:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	best can mean different things, but it's the most current, and typically is very stable.
2011-02-03T06:32:00.000Z	K3rmit		ok
2011-02-03T06:32:00.000Z	K3rmit		holy crap ubuntu is only 700MB? the other distros the downloads are 4GB+
2011-02-03T06:33:00.000Z	K3rmit		huh?
2011-02-03T06:34:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	thats because ubuntu just comes w/ a base of packages, and others are easily iinstalled via the ubuntu repositories
2011-02-03T06:34:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	best thing to do, is download the live CD, adn give it a run,, and see what you think.. if you encounter problems, come here, and we'll discuss them.
2011-02-03T06:35:00.000Z	K3rmit		ok thanks guys
2011-02-03T06:35:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	ubuntu live cd's can be used before you install, so there's really no risk in just burning the cd and booting it.
2011-02-03T06:36:00.000Z	KM0201		lol
2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	K3rmit	KM0201	ok but what about a distro for my hosted web server?
2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	just about every linux distro can do that... ubuntu is no exception
2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	KM0201		that was quick
2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	K3rmit		ok
2011-02-03T06:38:00.000Z	K3rmit		what about be the most popular webserver distro KM0201 ? Best to learn for that?
2011-02-03T06:39:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	again, most popular, best.. etc... is irrelevant its all about what meets your needs.
2011-02-03T06:39:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	running a server, is probably gong to require that you do some serious reading...
2011-02-03T06:40:00.000Z	K3rmit	KM0201	I don't know what meets my needs. I just need to chose a linux distro for my host
2011-02-03T06:40:00.000Z	KM0201	K3rmit	i would do some reading.. there are a gazillion options....
