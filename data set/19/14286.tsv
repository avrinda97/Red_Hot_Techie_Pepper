2004-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	jdub		pretty much everything else works though
2004-09-30T08:12:00.000Z	jdub		but it's not really worth the cost/hassle
2004-09-30T08:12:00.000Z	jdub		bur[n] er: best not to use ubuntu packages with debian and vice versa
2004-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	jdub		bur[n] er: we delayed the live cd a bit
2004-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	jdub		but there are earlier versions that don't have full autoconfig support here:
2004-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	jdub		people.no-name-yet.com/~mdz/ubuntu-live/
2004-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	jdub		it's quite old compared to current ubuntu
2004-09-30T08:15:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	gnome 2.8?  and one last question... is centrino support built in to ubuntu?
2004-09-30T08:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	thanks for the answers :)  and the link
2004-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	no worries, i just wanted to test out gnome 2.8 with the live cd... and if it's worth it, i'll go for the whole ubuntu install
2004-10-26T11:20:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	will do
2005-02-05T09:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	kinda what i was thinking ;)
2005-02-07T13:40:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	no menu.lst editing or anythign else right?
2005-09-10T09:50:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	colorado anywhere?
2005-09-10T09:52:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	i am not... i know there's one here in Boulder, but I only went to their irc channel once, seems they're fedora people :\
2005-09-10T09:54:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	very true... i might actually have to go to one if they're interested
2005-09-10T09:59:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	 since you're in UI stuff and gnome... know anything about gaim's away window and getting it to minimize... it won't because metacity doesn't allow child windows to minimize and gaim wont' make it a non-child window
2006-06-01T08:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	nice to see yer nick on irc again :)
2006-06-01T08:03:00.000Z	bur[n] er	jdub	of course, dapper's great!
