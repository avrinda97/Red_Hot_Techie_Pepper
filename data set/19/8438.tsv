2008-01-03T19:13:00.000Z	chef_		could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong/missing? In terminal I type: cd ~/install_flash_player_9_linux so I can install the program but terminal keeps telling me the file and/or directory doesn't exist even though I can see it sitting there on my desktop. What gives?
2008-01-03T19:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 it is a directory? and yoy  are tryign to cd to the HOME DIR with ~ not the Desktop dir
2008-01-03T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 just use cd  /home/USERNAME/Desktop/inst<tab>
2008-01-03T19:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 learning to use the shell.. would show you what you are doing wrong.. you dont cd to ~/whjatever  ~ is the HOME DIR. not the Desktop directory
2008-01-03T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 if you see a thing on the desktop its in ~/Desktop/whatever
2008-01-03T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 ~ is a shortcut for /home/YOURUSERNAME/
2008-01-03T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 bash basics. :)   Its very worth while to spend an hr or so reading a few bash starter guides.    Get a good foundation of knowledge to build on. Thats the linux way.
2008-01-03T19:23:00.000Z	chef_	Dr_willis	good idea I agree if I had any documentation... where do I find
2008-01-03T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 theres litallery 10000's of bash guides/docs out. the 'advanced bash scriptng guide' is in the repos and at tldp.org   its worth checking out.. TLDP.org is also worth bookmarking. :)
2008-01-03T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 check the bookstores/bargin bin tables at the bookstores for Oriealy's 'using bash' book. its the de-facto book on it. :)  its may be online also at places.
2008-01-03T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 and the url's  the bot just posted.
2008-01-03T19:32:00.000Z	chef_	Dr_willis	Following your advice I sucessfully navigated to the file on my desktop and started the installer but I'm told I'm running installer as a non-root user... should I have typed sudo before the ./<filename> ?
2008-01-03T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 yes.
2008-01-03T19:45:00.000Z	chef_	Dr_willis	sorry 2 keep bothering you but you seem quite knowledgable... installer is asking for the installation path of my browser giving this ex. (i.e., /usr/lib/mozilla)... that file doesn't exist but there is a /usr/firefox file... I'm guessing that's the correct one but would like confirmation so I not sticking files any old place & wondering why the app doesn't work
2008-01-03T19:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 you do realize theres an updated .deb package that can install the new flash player? :) you wouldent have to mess with this stuff.
2008-01-03T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 i have  /usr/lib/mozilla/ here
2008-01-03T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 that 2nd url the bot posted - has info/links to the 'testing' flash installer package. Use at your own risk. :) but i imagine its safer then using the flash installer.
2008-01-03T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 http://launchpadlibrarian.net/10761023/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.115.0ubuntu2_i386.deb is the pakcage ive been testing onmy machines. Again. use at your own risk. I dont expect anyproblems from it however
2008-01-03T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	chef_	 personally i would  'wget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/10761023/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.115.0ubuntu2_i386.deb ' then 'sudo dpkg -i flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.115.0ubuntu2_i386.deb ' and dump the manual installer.
