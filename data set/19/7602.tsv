2007-08-19T10:03:00.000Z	keen101		is the VESA driver used by default on Live-CD's?
2007-08-19T10:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	only if there is no other driver
2007-08-19T10:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	no it doesn't
2007-08-19T10:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	it doesn't use vesa by default
2007-08-19T10:05:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	then what does it use by default?
2007-08-19T10:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	whatever driver your card takes
2007-08-19T10:06:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	so it detects what card you have, and then picks a driver?
2007-08-19T10:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	that's right
2007-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	so is it possible to select the VESA driver on an external HDD Ubuntu install, so that it works with most random computers?
2007-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	you can set the vesa driver after you install
2007-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	yeah i know.
2007-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	or you should be able to get the same init script the livecd uses to select a driver
2007-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	so that you can boot on any pc and it'll pick an appropriate driver
2007-08-19T10:08:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	that would be very neat.
2007-08-19T10:08:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	do you know where/how to get that script?
2007-08-19T10:08:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	no, sorry
2007-08-19T10:08:00.000Z	keen101	dystopianray	thanks. you were very helpful anyway.
2007-08-19T10:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	keen101	that sounds right
