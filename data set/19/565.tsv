2012-05-19T18:21:00.000Z	Zentaur		hi everybody
2012-05-19T18:22:00.000Z	Zentaur		i'm installing 12.04 right now in a raid1
2012-05-19T18:23:00.000Z	Zentaur		when i get to the partitioning screen in the 12.04 installation i think it's quite strange
2012-05-19T18:23:00.000Z	Zentaur		it recognizes two disks
2012-05-19T18:23:00.000Z	Zentaur		yesit's dual boot too
2012-05-19T18:24:00.000Z	Zentaur		could anybody help me with the installation?
2012-05-19T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	what's the issue ?
2012-05-19T18:26:00.000Z	Zentaur	ikonia	 i have two disks as raid1
2012-05-19T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	so what's the problem
2012-05-19T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	what type of raid is it
2012-05-19T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	is it hardware/software/fakeraid ?
2012-05-19T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	is it hardware on a motherboard, or a seperate command
2012-05-19T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	ok, so that's most likley not hardware raid but a technology called "fake raid"
2012-05-19T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	do you have any other OS on this machine at this time ?
2012-05-19T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	eg: do you have windows installed using raid1
2012-05-19T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	this could be a problem I'm sorry to say
2012-05-19T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	fake raid on Linux is a very poor supported technology
2012-05-19T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	a lot of the fake raid controllers just don't work
2012-05-19T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Zentaur	that's interesting, so you've had it working wiht 11.10, that's a good sign
