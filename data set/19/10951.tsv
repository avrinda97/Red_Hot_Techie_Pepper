2006-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	learnerr	intelikey	and what does ti do exactly
2006-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	intelikey	learnerr	writes a script called myscript.sh   makes it executable     the script can then be used to number files.      ./myscript.sh *.mp3       or   ./myscript.sh *     or the like.
2006-04-28T06:00:00.000Z	learnerr	intelikey	it add numbers in front of the already existing files ?
2006-04-28T06:00:00.000Z	intelikey	learnerr	yep
2006-04-28T06:00:00.000Z	learnerr	intelikey	: thank you :D
2006-04-28T06:02:00.000Z	intelikey	learnerr	you can add a _ between   \$num and \$this    thus   \$num_\$this     if you want to pretty up the thing a little.
2006-04-28T06:03:00.000Z	learnerr	intelikey	its fine ill study the script then adjust if theres need to
2006-04-28T06:04:00.000Z	intelikey	learnerr	 --->      echo -e "#!/bin/bash \n\nNUM=0 \n\nfor this in \$* \n  do mv \$this \$NUM_\$this \n  NUM=\$((\$NUM + 1 )) \ndone " > myscript.sh ;chmod 755 myscript.sh
2006-04-28T06:04:00.000Z	learnerr	intelikey	my mp3 player screw up the sorting of files so i just put numbers to get some order
2006-04-28T06:07:00.000Z	intelikey	learnerr	 --->      echo -e "#\!/bin/bash \n\nNUM=0 \n\nfor this in \$* \n  do mv \$this \$NUM_\$this \n  NUM=\$((\$NUM + 1 )) \ndone " > myscript.sh ;chmod 755 myscript.sh
