2007-09-09T09:11:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux		sorry, can somebody actually SEE me?
2007-09-09T09:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbie-in-linux	nope
2007-09-09T09:13:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	i get a weird message
2007-09-09T09:13:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	 says: learn about another OS BEFORE install it asshole!
2007-09-09T09:14:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbie-in-linux	ah, that message is not a standard ubuntu message :)
2007-09-09T09:15:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	, i am REALLY fucked up
2007-09-09T09:15:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	 i NEED the damned JAVA to work
2007-09-09T09:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbie-in-linux	what actually is your issue?
2007-09-09T09:16:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	my email only works with java, 'cos its' encrypted, without it, can't even read my mails
2007-09-09T09:16:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	i got Java from Sun, but apparently i did not install it correctly
2007-09-09T09:17:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	and it's the first time i ever install anything into Linux
2007-09-09T09:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbie-in-linux	maybe you need to do: "sudo update-alternatives --config java"
2007-09-09T09:18:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	how the Hell am i supposed to do that and WHERE, exactly?
2007-09-09T09:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbie-in-linux	lose the attitude, do it in a terminal
2007-09-09T09:21:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	i got this message "there's only one program providing java. nothing to configure"
2007-09-09T09:21:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbie-in-linux	sounds like java's correctly installed
2007-09-09T09:22:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	ok then why doesn't it work?
2007-09-09T09:22:00.000Z	newbie-in-linux	Frogzoo	'cos i thought i had done it right too
