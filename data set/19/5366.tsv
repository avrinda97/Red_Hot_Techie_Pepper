2009-01-30T09:49:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		I installed updates last night but it fails when trying to configure the kernel (intrepid), can anyone please take a look and help?? http://paste.ubuntu.com/111158/
2009-01-30T09:51:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	try sudo dpkg --configure -a
2009-01-30T09:51:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	thanks, I will try that as soon as the new updates finish
2009-01-30T09:56:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	where are the packages? /var/cache? something like that?
2009-01-30T09:59:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	if you installed through apt-get, using auto-complete (tab) with "sudo apt-get remove nvidia" should list all the packages you might need to uninstall
2009-01-30T10:00:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	i think maybe wrong person
2009-01-30T10:00:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	sorry, you're right, wrong person
2009-01-30T10:00:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	try just typing in a console, anywhere sudo dpkg --configure -a
2009-01-30T10:01:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	yea.. its a no go, also tried, "sudo dpkg --configure --pending" "sudo apt-get -f install"
2009-01-30T10:02:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	sorry, not sure then
2009-01-30T10:28:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/297167 seems related
2009-01-30T10:30:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	sudo DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer sh -x /usr/sbin/update-grub ; echo $?
2009-01-30T10:30:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	pastebin that
2009-01-30T10:33:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	_2: http://paste.ubuntu.com/111559/ (the dpkg --configure didnt work again, so i went with foxwoods)
2009-01-30T10:34:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	try reinstalling grub
2009-01-30T10:35:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	im using gfxboot
2009-01-30T10:35:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	that's your problem
2009-01-30T10:35:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	foxwoods	I knew it... sorry for neglecting that info
2009-01-30T10:36:00.000Z	foxwoods	WIGGMPk	unfortunately.....you'll probably have to roll your own kernel....if _2 can't help
