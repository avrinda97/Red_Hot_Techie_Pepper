2005-12-25T08:32:00.000Z	Aquarion		I'd say it's probably something to do with the Java setup, but as I say, I wasn't able to debug it
2005-12-25T08:32:00.000Z	duke	Aquarion	what have you done so? Other Ide
2005-12-25T08:32:00.000Z	Aquarion	duke	I ended up using Kate
2005-12-25T08:33:00.000Z	Aquarion		and vim
2005-12-25T08:33:00.000Z	duke	Aquarion	hmm that cant be a solution!
2005-12-25T08:36:00.000Z	duke		Topyli, yes thats true but i have to lean for an Algorithm and Datastructures exam! I need it!! ;-)
2005-12-25T08:37:00.000Z	duke	Aquarion	yeah yeah yeah, i ve solved the prob!!!!
2005-12-25T08:37:00.000Z	Aquarion	duke	Oh?
2005-12-25T08:39:00.000Z	duke	Aquarion	yeah , You have to insert in /etc/eclipse/java_home the path to a self-downloadet Version of SDK , it works!
