2008-04-30T03:57:00.000Z	MrObvious		Where can I download the BCM firmware for an offline install?
2008-04-30T03:58:00.000Z	RequinB4	MrObvious	- normally, packages.ubuntu.com ... I'm probably trying to get the same file as you
2008-04-30T03:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	I don't need the deb file, just bcmwl5.sys or whatever.
2008-04-30T03:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	Nevermind I found it.
2008-04-30T04:00:00.000Z	RequinB4	MrObvious	- try http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4547
2008-04-30T04:06:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	I found it.
2008-04-30T04:07:00.000Z	RequinB4	MrObvious	 This is for me
2008-04-30T04:07:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	http://wiki.debian.org/bcm43xx Go to download the drivers try 1.
2008-04-30T04:07:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	It's for debian but it will have the .sys file you need.
2008-04-30T04:08:00.000Z	RequinB4	MrObvious	- I'm not sure what to do with the sys file at this point, all i can gleam is i need the firmware
2008-04-30T04:09:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	Do that and you WILL have the firmware. After that you should be able to get ndiswrapper to work. Download it first then get back to me.
2008-04-30T04:12:00.000Z	RequinB4	MrObvious	- i'm downloading the exe
2008-04-30T04:16:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	Ok once you get it unzipped lemme know.
2008-04-30T04:17:00.000Z	RequinB4	MrObvious	 Am i just following the tut there?
2008-04-30T04:17:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	Basically open a terminal, go to your home folder, and it has you make a tmp directory then download it.
2008-04-30T04:18:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	What was the exact URL I gave you?
2008-04-30T04:19:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	Nevermind, found it.
2008-04-30T04:30:00.000Z	MrObvious	RequinB4	Still downloading?
