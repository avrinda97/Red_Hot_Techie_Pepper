2005-06-04T16:58:00.000Z	newbie		thx
2005-06-04T05:01:00.000Z	newbie		can anyone give me some nice wallpaper they like ?
2005-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	try apt-get install ubuntu-calendar -- i quite like april's wallpaper
2005-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	newbie	HappyFool	when I downloaded it, where can I run it ?
2005-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	it should install the wallpaper automatically
2005-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	err, or what thoreauputic said
2005-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	try it -- i think it ought to work
2005-07-14T15:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	you might consider using apache or ftp or something instead
2005-08-26T16:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	why did you put your ip in resolv.conf?
2005-08-26T16:45:00.000Z	newbie	HappyFool	thats my dns address .
2005-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	newbie	HappyFool	: the address i have in resolve.conf is my dns not my ip address
2005-08-26T16:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	the entries in resolv.conf should be 'nameserver 61.1.96.69' and 'nameserver 61.1.96.71', as far as i know
2005-08-26T16:47:00.000Z	newbie	HappyFool	: yes. man i shld have known it.. did that once in redhat. thanks
2005-08-26T16:48:00.000Z	newbie	HappyFool	: how can we be sure that the node is connected to isp ?
2005-08-26T16:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	i thought the dialup/ifup scripts would do that automatically for you, though
2005-08-26T16:49:00.000Z	newbie	HappyFool	the  dns ip u are seein in the log isnt the right one. we have only one dns server
2005-08-26T16:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	newbie	i'm not sure; try 'ping' i, guess (e.g., ping the nameserver)
