2006-03-11T13:38:00.000Z	lingerance		I can't get apt-get to work, neither does synaptic
2006-03-11T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	that's not safe or sound.
2006-03-11T13:48:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	are you in the admin group?
2006-03-11T13:49:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	How do I find out, I'm the only other user other than root
2006-03-11T13:50:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	enter "groups" in a terminal.
2006-03-11T13:51:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	doesn't look like it, how can I join the group?
2006-03-11T13:51:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	you will have to boot in recovery mode and run 'adduser lingerance admin'
2006-03-11T13:51:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	thanks, brb
2006-03-11T13:59:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	No admin group, should I create it?  I added myself to root, but I still get the same message
2006-03-11T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	if you haven't got an admin group, something is seriously wrong. It's difficult to decide the best strategy from here :(
2006-03-11T14:02:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	reinstall?
2006-03-11T14:02:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	I would try a reinstall, unless I had invested a lot into setting up the system already.
2006-03-11T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	you could of course try 'addgroup admin', but it whatever deleted your admin group might have wrought more havoc.
2006-03-11T14:08:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	I actually just installed ubuntu 5.10 i386
2006-03-11T14:09:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	in that case, I suggest you do it again.
2006-03-11T14:09:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	Meaning reinstall?  Or try adding myself to the admin group again?
2006-03-11T14:09:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	it may be worth saving your downloaded packages (/var/cache/apt/archives), so you don't have to do it again.
2006-03-11T14:10:00.000Z	lingerance	soundray	alright, thanks
2006-03-11T14:11:00.000Z	soundray	lingerance	I meant reinstall. But it's really up to you. Fixing it could be a learning opportunity. On the other hand, if you need to do some work on ubuntu, you may be quicker reinstalling it.
