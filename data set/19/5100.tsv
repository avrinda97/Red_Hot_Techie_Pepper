2009-02-02T06:21:00.000Z	root__		Hello, i get GRUB error 17 and I dont know what to do
2009-02-02T06:22:00.000Z	root__		yes!
2009-02-02T06:22:00.000Z	root__		How did you solved it Wunderbar?
2009-02-02T06:23:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	"Invalid device requested" check your menu.1st file
2009-02-02T06:27:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	which prolly relabeled sda1 to ada2 ect, you will likely just need to run fdisk -l and use the info to update the menu.1st file
2009-02-02T06:27:00.000Z	root__	koshar2	I did a few times!
2009-02-02T06:28:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	also check the devices file, that maps the sd** format of drive partition to the hd0 style grub prefers
2009-02-02T06:30:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	devices.list i think
2009-02-02T06:30:00.000Z	root__	koshar2	do u know the name of the devices? Ah okay thank you koshar2
2009-02-02T06:30:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	located in /boot/grub
2009-02-02T06:34:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	pastebook fdisk -l and your boot entry of menu.1st, and your devices.map file
2009-02-02T06:35:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	you may even find a changed uuid if you used a new parttiion
2009-02-02T06:36:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	ok just checking
2009-02-02T06:39:00.000Z	root__	koshar2	> http://fr.pastebin.com/d76592a4d
2009-02-02T06:42:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	does it boot to windows ok?
2009-02-02T06:42:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	does the first stage of grub load , ie pressing escape and viewing the boot options?
2009-02-02T06:43:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	ahh then i think as otherpointed out you may need to reinstall the grub loader.
2009-02-02T06:43:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	 its not ahrd
2009-02-02T06:44:00.000Z	koshar2	root__	you basicall boot of a live disc, locate the config file and run grub from the live cd
