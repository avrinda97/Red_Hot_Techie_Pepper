2011-05-09T19:38:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	yeah permission issue
2011-05-09T19:39:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	 well the drive in question you have to change permission for
2011-05-09T19:40:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	you should be able to just right clich on it, hit properties, and clic read/write
2011-05-09T19:40:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	theres a shell command too i think its chmod but i forget the syntax
2011-05-09T19:41:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	you cant see it or its greyed out
2011-05-09T19:41:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	 yeah you will have to use sudo chmod but im not sure on the syntax
2011-05-09T19:42:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	one sec ill see if i can find the command
2011-05-09T19:44:00.000Z	Tweaky	hemangpatel	in terminal: sudo chmod +777 <location of directory>
