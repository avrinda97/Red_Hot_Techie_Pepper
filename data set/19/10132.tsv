2009-12-14T03:09:00.000Z	ubunewbu		Hi! I tried googling but didn't find anything on the subject. So where do all files get installed in Ubuntu/Linux? I want to ask this because when I uninstall an application with Ubuntu Software Center, I want the application's traces to be deleted too (no empty folders ANYWHERE! Not even a marking in any text file of its existence)
2009-12-14T03:10:00.000Z	ubunewbu		For example in Windows I always have to run regedit and delete it from LOCAL and USER directories and delete empty folders from My Documents and Program Files. And perhaps Temp and Windows folders. How do you do this in Linux?
2009-12-14T03:11:00.000Z	ubunewbu		Thank you =)
2009-12-14T03:12:00.000Z	ubunewbu		For example if it's a long program name... How do I know what to type in the terminal instead of empathy
2009-12-14T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	installing and removing programs using the terminal is rather easy
2009-12-14T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	no certain things in Windows can only be done in the command prompt
2009-12-14T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	it's also much easier and faster to use the commands when installing programs from the repo.
2009-12-14T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	well yes you can, as long as the hardware you want to use, works with the distro you gone for which is Ubuntu, and you don't want to do anything slightly more advanced
2009-12-14T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	however sudo apt-get  install program  or  program 1 prgraom 2 etc isn't hard
2009-12-14T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	and much quicker than first having to open up the software centre (assuming your on 9.10 if not add/remove)  or synaptic
2009-12-14T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	you can install more than one program like this. sudo apt-get install program1  program2 program3 program4  where than select each one individualley in a graphical program and tell it you want to install the program
2009-12-14T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	silly tpeos or typing in wrong words by mistake even,  above where,  I put where, I meant to put rather
2009-12-14T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	no
2009-12-14T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	sudo apt-get purge  packagename
2009-12-14T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	purge removes the config files as well, not just the program which is what happens when you do remove
2009-12-14T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	also programs have hidden folders in home with their program user data,  for example .mozilla is the Firefox profile, if you then remove that or move it some where else, and re open Firefox, it's like your using it for your first time in Ubuntu
2009-12-14T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	ah right yeah, well there's even a bot factoid for that kind of thing
2009-12-14T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	hmm I just messaged the bot hmm, interesting way to mess up my auto complete there.  anyway I was just showing you that, there is a factoid
2009-12-14T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubunewbu	ubottu is the bot a computer program, that gets used in  the channel, for info
