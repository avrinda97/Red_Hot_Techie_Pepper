2007-08-11T13:44:00.000Z	chalcedony		does anyone use some kind of flow-charting software?
2007-08-11T13:45:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	try the open office suite?
2007-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	chalcedony	m0u5e	i have OO i was looking for something maybe lighter, it's for reminders, guides for a help channel
2007-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	sorry then, im as in the dark as you :D
2007-08-11T13:47:00.000Z	chalcedony	m0u5e	ive got something called 'sticky notes" that are cute.. but you can only have so many and still find what you want..
2007-08-11T13:49:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	hmm then dunno :D if you want something like sticky notes, i would've recommended tomboy sticky notes (in ubuntu) but seems like you've already tried that
2007-08-11T13:50:00.000Z	chalcedony	m0u5e	maybe.. can tomboy notes be wider than 17 or so characters?
2007-08-11T13:50:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	yeah, they can be as long as they want :D
2007-08-11T13:51:00.000Z	chalcedony	m0u5e	umm mine get too long for the screen and you can't scroll down on them/
2007-08-11T13:51:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	definitely try tomboy notes then, it comes with ubuntu
2007-08-11T13:52:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	just type sudo apt-get install tomboy
2007-08-11T13:53:00.000Z	chalcedony	m0u5e	i typed tomboy notes and i've got it, it imported 15 of my other notes as it opened, whatever that means?
2007-08-11T13:54:00.000Z	chalcedony	m0u5e	is there a how-to ?
2007-08-11T13:54:00.000Z	m0u5e	chalcedony	the very first note that pops up should be a how to guide :D
