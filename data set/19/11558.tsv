2006-01-15T12:41:00.000Z	kkathman		good day - just did an adept update, rebooted and have no connectivity to my network (system is up and running).. dhclient eth0 shows no discovery, no leases - sleeping
2006-01-15T12:41:00.000Z	kkathman		could someone offer some ideas on how to possibly rectify this>
2006-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	kkathman		btw pinging my gateway gives Network is unreachable
2006-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	does eth0 get recognized by your kernel?
2006-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	kkathman	graft	 is there something else you had in mind?
2006-01-15T12:46:00.000Z	kkathman	graft	  what I mean by that those processes were ok...was that they return [ok] 
2006-01-15T12:46:00.000Z	kkathman	graft	 I now have 3 entries there:  eth0, lo, and sit0  (dont remember the sit0 before)
2006-01-15T12:46:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	is the eth0 address the same as the one for your card in lspci?
2006-01-15T12:50:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	yeah, that's just the bus line... you're right, lspci doesn't tell you the mac address.. my memory was bad
2006-01-15T12:52:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	does it do DHCPREQUESTs?
2006-01-15T12:59:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	what modules have oyu got loaded?
2006-01-15T13:00:00.000Z	kkathman	graft	 well quite a few Im sure
2006-01-15T13:00:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	you oughta find whatever module inserts sit0 and kill it
2006-01-15T13:00:00.000Z	kkathman	graft	 interesting that network-admin was able to setup that eth0 for static
2006-01-15T13:01:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	you have to get it out of the kernel
2006-01-15T13:05:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	err first do lsmod and see if you have an ipv6 module loading
2006-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	rmmod that shit
2006-01-15T13:08:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	well, you have to get that ipv6 out of there somehow
2006-01-15T13:12:00.000Z	graft	kkathman	what kernel do you have installed anyway?
