2011-12-17T09:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	What does here mean the colon? <-- is that english?
2011-12-17T09:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	or universal translator?
2011-12-17T09:57:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	My question "What does here mean the colon?" is meant to be English.
2011-12-17T09:58:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	my bad, I was thinking you mean, 'what does the colon mean here?'
2011-12-29T13:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	Your information is not new to me.
2011-12-29T13:24:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	neither is your question
2011-12-29T13:25:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	Your message has an impertinent tone. Try to obey a family-friendly tone here in this channel.
2011-12-29T13:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	as was your initial response
2011-12-29T15:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	perhaps 'streamtuner2' (front end) for streamripper can? it plays while ripper records?
2011-12-29T15:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	Yes, streamtuner2 can. I have tested und proved that. I consider that a workaround.
2011-12-29T15:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	you question did not include a 'blacklisted.apps' subsection, would adding one be of help?
2011-12-29T15:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	I fear you may continue to get the same response :)
2012-02-01T10:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	http://identi.ca/conversation/89569647#notice-89757060 <-- that help?
2012-02-01T11:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	How does http://identi.ca/conversation/89569647#notice-89757060 answer my question?
2012-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	should have answered the 'who' wrote it
2012-02-01T11:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	You said: "{It} should." But did it?
2012-02-01T11:12:00.000Z	almoxarife	bullgard4	yes it did, google is a power tool, may i help you in its use? i would recommend 'googlizer' for gnome, i have a script that would do same for kde
2012-02-01T11:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	almoxarife	i asked at the outset: "Who is the user of »User ID 324821 « in http://www.identi.ca/ubuntudev?" Now you are telling me "google is a power tool." Is that all you are able to answer this question? I know Goggle well, and this does not answer my question at the outset.
