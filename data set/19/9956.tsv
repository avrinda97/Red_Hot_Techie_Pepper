2006-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	Hazarath		Ok, need help installing _any_ MUCK clients... preferably with a GUI.
2006-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	Hazarath		Lemme re-enstate my problem... need help installing a .gz type package.
2006-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	carthik	Hazarath	I guess no one understands what "MUCK" is, or no one knows the answer
2006-08-23T12:18:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	I need help installing a .gz package.
2006-08-23T12:18:00.000Z	carthik	Hazarath	what does that have to with MUCK ? anyways, so what is the problem you are facing?
2006-08-23T12:19:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	I just need ti install the said app, but it doesn't come in .deb, only .gz
2006-08-23T12:20:00.000Z	carthik	Hazarath	you might have to compile it from source, then, tar -zxvf whatever.tar.gz will untar-gz it, and then there should be a README or INSTALL file that tell you what to do from there on
2006-08-23T12:22:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	Lemme try a few things, sorry... *ish a Windows convert*
2006-08-23T12:23:00.000Z	carthik	Hazarath	not a problem - often you just have to try rephrasing the question in imaginative ways :) good luck.
2006-08-23T12:25:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	Think I'm just gonna use Wine, and run the Windows client like I'm used to. XD
2006-08-23T12:25:00.000Z	carthik	Hazarath	what did the INSTALL or README say?
2006-08-23T12:25:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	I'm just gonna try to use the client I know how to work... dirrent MUCK clients can be... annying.
2006-08-23T12:27:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	I'm gonna try my own... unless ya wanna look at the page... I'm pretty much annoyed at the prosses right now.
2006-08-23T12:33:00.000Z	Hazarath	carthik	Can I PM you?
2006-08-23T12:33:00.000Z	carthik	Hazarath	sure
