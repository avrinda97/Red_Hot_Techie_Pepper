2008-08-23T17:18:00.000Z	ksbalaji	arvind_khadri	I installed restricted drivers. now what is envyng?
2008-08-23T17:19:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ksbalaji	disable restricted drivers... read the links the bot gave you... and install envy
2008-08-23T17:19:00.000Z	ksbalaji	arvind_khadri	does envyng replace compiz?
2008-08-23T17:20:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ksbalaji	no...compiz is composite manager and envy is a app which handles drivers for ATI and Nvidia
2008-08-23T17:20:00.000Z	ksbalaji	arvind_khadri	thanks - now do I uninstall compiz and install envy?
2008-08-23T17:20:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ksbalaji	if you dont want to have effects you can remove compiz..
2008-08-23T17:22:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ksbalaji	compiz works when your card works :) so in turn you will need envy ...
