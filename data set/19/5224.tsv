2008-08-10T05:04:00.000Z	goat_		ok since neofax has abandoned me now
2008-08-10T05:04:00.000Z	goat_		can anyone tell me if use can lose data with fsck?
2008-08-10T05:04:00.000Z	goat_		if you tell it to fix stuff, will fsck delete your data?
2008-08-10T05:04:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 its possible.. its also possible the data is allready lost and its not fsck's fault.
2008-08-10T05:05:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	fsck wants to fix a sh*tload of stuff, if i let it clone, delete, move, etc blocks of stuff, is it safe to do that or can i lose data?
2008-08-10T05:06:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 its always possible to lose data.    If you want to be uberparanoid. you can 'dd' the bad filesystem to a new hard drive/file and fsck that file..  to see what it recovers.
2008-08-10T05:08:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	i was trying to sort out my graphics settings with neofax's help, then my file system got "somehow" corrupted and now i need to fix it, what is the chance of losing data with fsck? there isnt much data on the hdd
2008-08-10T05:08:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 i would way rather low in that case.
2008-08-10T05:08:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	:/
2008-08-10T05:09:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	how can the whole os die from changing a line in xorg.conf?
2008-08-10T05:09:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	that file is just ascii now
2008-08-10T05:09:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 no idea.   its possible its the hard drive dieing.
2008-08-10T05:09:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	even booting into recovery mode is screwed
2008-08-10T05:10:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 sounds more and more like a hardware  flakyness issue to me.  But it can be hard to twll these days
2008-08-10T05:10:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 live cd;s are handy to have around.
2008-08-10T05:11:00.000Z	goat_	dr_Willis	i have one, but where do you suggest i copy the data to? :/
2008-08-10T05:11:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	  theres online sevices. :) but it depends on the details.
2008-08-10T05:11:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	 i have 3+ fileservers here.. so i never worry about 'where' :)
2008-08-10T05:13:00.000Z	dr_Willis	goat_	  You dont want to know the blowups ive had with windows.. you ahve not 'proven' it was a ubuntu  failure.
