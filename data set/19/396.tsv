2012-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	blendedbychris		local
2012-03-11T12:23:00.000Z	blendedbychris		php5-fpm
2012-03-11T12:23:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	what about it
2012-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	it doesn't seem to be in php itself it's an external package
2012-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	who is not on topic ?
2012-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	it would also be a large problem on your machine
2012-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	drop the attitude
2012-03-11T12:28:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	a lot of things depend on the php packages on your machine (if you are running a web environment) so putting a "from source" or not well thought through package may cause a lot of problems on your machine
2012-03-11T12:29:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	you'll need to learn about the debian packaging process
2012-03-11T12:30:00.000Z	blendedbychris	ikonia	ppa for what?
2012-03-11T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	php-fpm
2012-03-11T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	yes, but as I see it there are patches needed for pre-5.5.3 branches which is what you are using
2012-03-11T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	that's why I checked if there was a PPA hosting this for you already so you didn't have to do it
2012-03-11T12:32:00.000Z	blendedbychris	ikonia	for all i care i can go straight to 5.3.5
2012-03-11T12:33:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	ok - good luck then, you clearly don't need my help
2012-03-11T12:33:00.000Z	blendedbychris	ikonia	i'm not being rude in that last sentenceâ€¦ i just was saying ;)
2012-03-11T12:34:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	yeah, I was just saying too, you don't need my help if you are smart enough to understand making the jump to php 5.3.5 on an older system
2012-03-11T12:34:00.000Z	ikonia	blendedbychris	good luck with it then
