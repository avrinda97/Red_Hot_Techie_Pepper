2009-03-03T06:35:00.000Z	Brando753		hey can you dual boot ubuntu server?
2009-03-03T06:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	yes
2009-03-03T06:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	you can dual boot anything that works with grub (basically everything)
2009-03-03T06:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	grub boots after the BIOS has loaded
2009-03-03T06:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	so no
2009-03-03T06:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	then you can use lilo but I am not sure how it works with dual and tri booting
2009-03-03T06:40:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	use grub....
2009-03-03T06:40:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	grub more or less boots everything
2009-03-03T06:41:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	the same way.... do you realize that linux servers don't have GUIs?
2009-03-03T06:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	and should not have one at any time
2009-03-03T07:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	depends on the wifi card
2009-03-03T07:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	it uses a linux kernel just like every other ubuntu distro
2009-03-03T07:01:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	that doesn't really help me to determine if its linux compatible
2009-03-03T07:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	support more than 4GB or RAM
2009-03-03T07:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	and support more clients because ALL of its resources will be devouted to server applications
2009-03-03T07:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	other than that, nothing really
2009-03-03T07:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	if your hardware supports virtualization
2009-03-03T07:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	I think that you don't quite understand how virtualization works
2009-03-03T07:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brando753	no, you will have to restore the windows MBR
