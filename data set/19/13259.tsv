2008-04-23T09:42:00.000Z	crweb		how do i install all of gnome from kubuntu  (i want all gnome not just ubuntu-desktop)
2008-04-23T09:44:00.000Z	crweb		So, i tried to install it and it said can't install cause gnome-keyring-manager isn't installable.
2008-04-23T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	gnome-desktop-environment is a debianism, you should be installing ubuntu-desktop instead
2008-04-23T09:45:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	i don't want ubuntu-desktop. I want all of gnome
2008-04-23T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	ubuntu desktop gives you all of 'gnome' , you can add apps as you need otherwise
2008-04-23T09:46:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	so ubuntu-desktop installs every gnome distributed package?
2008-04-23T09:47:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	whatever you do decide to do, don't use gnome-desktop-environment package. That's all I wanted to be clear about since it has some dependencies that ubuntu doesn't track properly.
2008-04-23T09:48:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	i'm not looking for ubuntu-desktop.  I want all of gnome. like installing kde, and kde4
2008-04-23T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	by 'gnome', what are you thinking of?  try   apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop, what's not there that you want?
2008-04-23T09:52:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	ubuntu-desktop is only the gnome apps ubuntu sees fit to be default installed.
2008-04-23T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	no, only the default ones (the ones that will fit on a cd) . All others are available from the repos
2008-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	which is exactly what i'm saying
2008-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	 i want ALL of gnome not just the default
2008-04-23T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	neither does gnome-desktop-environment. There's many apps that are not included in that also
2008-04-23T09:54:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	who said anything about gnome-deskto-environment
2008-04-23T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	so do I. And, again I suggest you not try to install debian metapackages.
2008-04-23T10:03:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	you can file a wishlist bug for an ubuntu metapackage that would pull in a larger subset of gnome apps, or better yet put it on brainstorm.com
2008-04-23T10:03:00.000Z	crweb	nickrud	isn't it kind of dangerous to have packages in a repo you are not suppose to install?
2008-04-23T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	crweb	yup
