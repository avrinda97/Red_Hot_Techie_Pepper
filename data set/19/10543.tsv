2006-06-05T06:49:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	unfortunately Gnome is _still_ cutting options down in order for it to be "easier" on users
2006-06-05T06:51:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	it has made it harder now for me to get what i want. There was never anything hard about having options and having more choice of screensavers. Thats hardly streamlining
2006-06-05T06:54:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	basically Gnome is oversimplifying and irritating power users while KDE has every option under the sun and irritates normal users who don't need to customize every little detail of their config and have to wade through all these obscure settings to do stuff
2006-06-05T06:58:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	well i might have to go over to kde then. While i accept the distinction in principle, screensaver is a small thing and was not too complex as it was in breezy . Therefore to have simplified it even further, is strange. The time it took them to do that could have been spent elsewhere making real worhwile changes. Just my thoughts
2006-06-05T06:59:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	nooooo! Not the dark side!
2006-06-05T06:59:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	dark side? what are you talking about?
2006-06-05T07:00:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	I have unfounded prejudices against KDE, don't ask
2006-06-05T07:01:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	dont take me wrong- i like gnome but it is small things like having a favourite screensaver in breezy not showing up in Dapper and then seeing that customization has been stripped to basically nil that annoys Common Mark Shuttleworth! youll be hearing from me
2006-06-05T07:03:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	yes
2006-06-05T07:03:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	if you see Mark before i do, you tell him, ok?
2006-06-05T07:03:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	however, if you are happy with Gnome I would spend the few minutes crawling the web/wiki to figure out doing it in Gnome and save the effort of installing KDE
2006-06-05T07:03:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	which one is Mark?
2006-06-05T07:04:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	Mr Shuttleworth
2006-06-05T07:05:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	are  you saying then that it is possible in gnome too? I thought you were sayuing gnome is for simpletons and is therefore stripped down and streamlined for simpicity?
2006-06-05T07:05:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	I was saying that the most visible ways of configuring Gnome are stripped down
2006-06-05T07:06:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	oh, so it is actually more difficult then kde, i see
2006-06-05T07:06:00.000Z	poje	grasshopper	depends on the situation ;)
2006-06-05T07:07:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	so things are easier to do in kde, hmmm... i see  :(
2006-06-05T07:07:00.000Z	grasshopper	poje	well, this situation!
