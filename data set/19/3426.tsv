2009-09-11T17:01:00.000Z	abhifx		hi there. how can i update python, i installed 3.1.1 but it still shows 2.6.1
2009-09-11T17:01:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	run python3 if you want to run python3
2010-05-09T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	what software and why?
2010-05-09T16:32:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	blender both version 2.5 and 2.49
2010-05-09T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	well, I would install 2.49 from the repositories and then install 2.5 yourself to a different location, e.g. /usr/local
2010-05-09T16:33:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	i have a deb file of both...
2010-05-09T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	don't use the debfile for 2.5
2010-05-09T16:34:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	so there is no solution then?
2010-05-09T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	I just told you the solution...
2010-05-09T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	blender.org doesn't even have deb files for lucid that I can see.  Use the tarball
2010-05-09T16:35:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	i know that solution... i should have been more clearer... but cant i install both the deb file somehow?
2010-05-09T16:35:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	i used a ppa
2010-05-09T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	well you can modify the deb file if you want, get the source package and change where it installs to.  A completely different approach, by the way, would be to use virtualbox with another ubuntu install
2010-05-09T16:36:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	how can i modify the deb file?
2010-05-09T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	you probably need to rename the package, etc. too
2010-05-09T16:38:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	are you suggesting i should copile from the source?
2010-05-09T16:38:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	hmm.... simply renaming wont do.. thats for sure
2010-05-09T16:38:00.000Z	jrib	abhifx	when I say "source" I refer to the "source package" not the tarball from blender.  i.e. it comes with the debian/ stuff and is used to produce a deb
2010-05-09T16:39:00.000Z	abhifx	jrib	aha... i get it. thanks
