2010-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	Ghosty		i am having authentication failure with su root, but i have the password set correctly, and can even login as root
2010-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 perhaps 'sudo -s' ?
2010-08-08T05:21:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	i was using root as an example, i cannot su to any user
2010-08-08T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 you are using the password of the User you are suing TO?
2010-08-08T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 so if you 'sudo adduser billgates' and 'su billgates'  it also fails eh?
2010-08-08T05:24:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	yes it fails
2010-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 odd. makes me wonder what changes you did to the system
2010-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	im thinking, a mistake i made a while back, might be causing it
2010-08-08T05:26:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	but i dont know how to fix su
2010-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	can you help?
2010-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 untill we kniow what you changed.. i cant really help.
2010-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	i just said it
2010-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 sounds like you got some perms wrong from your chown.. that may be very very veyr hard to fix
2010-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	<Ghosty> Dr_Willis, im thinking, a mistake i made a while back, might be causing it
2010-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	<Ghosty> i ran chown incorrectly, and accidentaily changed all perms from root dir on.. i fixed it, and fixed sudo
2010-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 so you chowned  EVERYTHING by mistake..  souinds liek it may be time for a reinstall..
2010-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Ghosty	Dr_Willis	darn...:(
2010-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 thats the only sure fix - i can think of.
2010-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ghosty	 or reinstall every package.. (which may take even longer)
