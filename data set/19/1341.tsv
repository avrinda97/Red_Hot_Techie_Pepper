2011-02-26T15:22:00.000Z	alisalaah		Ubuntu 10.10 - I have a laptop with 2 DisplayLink adapters to Monitors, I am currently using both DisplayLinks now, working, but the laptop Screen is blank!  I have been playing with xorg.conf for about 30 minutes
2011-02-26T15:22:00.000Z	alisalaah		anyone can help with xorg.conf, and getting my laptop display back
2011-02-26T15:22:00.000Z	coraxx	alisalaah	yes...just delete it
2011-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	coraxx	alisalaah	....the default settings comes in to place
2011-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	alisalaah	coraxx	then i lose my 2x24" monitors and have only my laptop.  i would prefer a real answer
2011-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	alisalaah		i didnt come here after screwing with xorg.comf all night for sarcasm
2011-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	alisalaah		ty
2011-02-26T15:25:00.000Z	coraxx	alisalaah	it was not sarcasm at all.  After I've spent much time with xorg.conf myself ... I found out that if I loose a vital monitor during my setup ...I delete the xorg.conf (or rename it so I preserve some of the configuration)
2011-02-26T15:25:00.000Z	alisalaah		yes but i can get just laptop screen, or just display links
2011-02-26T15:25:00.000Z	alisalaah		i had all 3 but the alignment was wrong "righof vs leftof"
2011-02-26T15:25:00.000Z	alisalaah		rebooted with only chnaging that
2011-02-26T15:25:00.000Z	alisalaah		and it was broke after that
2011-02-26T15:26:00.000Z	coraxx	alisalaah	then I sometime use the vendor linux driver to make the config changes in the xorg.conf file
2011-02-26T15:26:00.000Z	alisalaah		but then i found out 5 mins later than my displaylinks were getting different /devf/fb0 vs fb1 vs fb2 etc
2011-02-26T15:26:00.000Z	alisalaah		i started with that
2011-02-26T15:26:00.000Z	alisalaah		then read 2 blogs on people who got it working
2011-02-26T15:26:00.000Z	alisalaah		and i just cant seem to get all 3 up at once
2011-02-26T15:27:00.000Z	alisalaah		and as said one time i did i had to reboot and it went away
2011-02-26T15:27:00.000Z	coraxx	alisalaah	sry, can't help
