2008-01-12T07:54:00.000Z	cal_mac		can anyone tell me how to install an i386 program on an amd64 build of ubuntu?
2008-01-12T07:55:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	install 32bit libs
2008-01-12T07:56:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	will that change my system to 32bit, or will it just allow me to run 32bit programs?
2008-01-12T07:56:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	 the latter
2008-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	sometimes you can edit a few lines of source code and compile for 64bit
2008-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	may I ask what program you want to run?
2008-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	wing-101
2008-01-12T07:58:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	haven't heard of that program
2008-01-12T07:58:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	its a free python interpreter/editor
2008-01-12T07:59:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	i use 32bit libs and runs fine.  in fact you can run 32bit and 64 bit firefox together to test the speed
2008-01-12T07:59:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	i am reading that there is more than one way of getting 32bit libs..
2008-01-12T08:00:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	probably easiest to use synaptic.. but silly me forgot what the package names are
2008-01-12T08:00:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	alright i'll have a look.  thank you
2008-01-12T08:10:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	i'm totally at a loss as to which package it might be.. is it in libraries (old)?
2008-01-12T08:10:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	let me see what I can find... give me a few
2008-01-12T08:10:00.000Z	cal_mac	ablyss	sure thing
2008-01-12T08:13:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	sudo apt-get install ia32-libs  also have a look at http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/libs/ia32-libs
2008-01-12T08:14:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	that should get you rolling.. the link was just for reference
2008-01-12T08:15:00.000Z	ablyss	cal_mac	you can also search synaptic with "ia32" for all available programs and utilities or shell command sudo apt-cache search ia32
