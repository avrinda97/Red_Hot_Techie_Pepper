2010-07-22T15:16:00.000Z	anodesni		Hi, I'm playing snes games with ZSNES, but the picture is stretched to fit the widescreen. Can I prevent this? I have the 10.6 ati proprietary driver installed.
2010-07-22T15:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	maybe it has an option to play in a window rether than fullscreen
2010-07-22T15:18:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	it is, but I prefer fullscreen
2010-07-22T15:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	well you can't have your cake and eat it too
2010-07-22T15:19:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	windows does it too
2010-07-22T15:19:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	I mean keeping the 4:3 ratio
2010-07-23T18:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	make sure all mesa packages are installed
2010-07-23T18:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	this three --> libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-swx11 libgl1-mesa-glx
2010-07-23T18:48:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	if I try to install -swx11 it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop and libgl1-mesa-glx
2010-07-23T18:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	pk then do not install that last one ...
2010-07-23T18:48:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	the rest I already have
2010-07-23T18:51:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	well fglrx works, but performance is not as smoot (for compiz) with it
2010-07-23T18:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	dunno maybe znes look for it as different name? what is the exact message of znes?
2010-07-23T18:52:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	I also think it's a linker problem
2010-07-23T18:52:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	I now have fglrx installed so I cannot reproduce the error
2010-07-23T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	well libgl1-mesa-glx should porvide libGL for the opensource driver afaics
2010-07-23T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	no problem
2010-07-23T18:56:00.000Z	anodesni	erUSUL	I think this is my solution-> "After the link is manually created by issuing `ln -s /usr/lib/opengl/ati/lib/libGL.so.1.2 /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2' everything works asexpected."
2010-07-23T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	anodesni	could be
