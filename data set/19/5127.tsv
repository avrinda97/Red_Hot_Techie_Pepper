2008-08-27T07:50:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor		Hello, I need help with setting up wireless.

2008-08-27T07:51:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor		Thats the wireless card I want to run with Hardy.
2008-08-27T07:51:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor		How do I do it easily? I have little to no experience with wireless in Ubuntu, nor installing things except with sudo apt get, which I obviously can't use.
2008-08-27T07:52:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor		Is there someone I can message with my wireless problem?
2008-08-27T07:52:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	just ask in the channel
2008-08-27T07:53:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	check linuxwirless.org and find your device there
2008-08-27T07:55:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	good, now see what it says about support and how to set it up
2008-08-27T07:57:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	interesting.  Guess that ones isn't complerted yet.  Does it show when you run "ifconfig -a" ?
2008-08-27T07:58:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	paste the output of ifconfig -a at http://rafb.net/paste
2008-08-27T07:58:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor	cn28h	what happens when I past it there?
2008-08-27T07:59:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	then we can look and see
2008-08-27T08:10:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor	cn28h	I just booted into Ubuntu and ran the command, and also ran LSPCI. Are those both fine to paste for that code thing?
2008-08-27T08:10:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	sure
2008-08-27T08:12:00.000Z	Guitarrassdeamor	cn28h	http://rafb.net/p/rmBLcm49.html
2008-08-27T08:14:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	ok, looks like it's not having a network device.. but I'm not familiar with this card.. let me see
2008-08-27T08:16:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	good news is your chipset is supported.  Try "sudo moprobe rtl8187" and then check ifconfig -a again
2008-08-27T08:17:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	yes we're using a native driver, which is a much better solution when available.  This will try to lad the kernel module for your card
2008-08-27T08:18:00.000Z	cn28h	Guitarrassdeamor	reboot? why?
