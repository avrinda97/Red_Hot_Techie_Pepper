2008-04-04T23:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		you should put, "to be continud"
2008-04-04T23:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		Yowshi: give it time
2008-04-04T23:29:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	i dont have anvy any more. cant get it after the install. but it was the best way for installing nvidia drivers at the time
2008-04-04T23:29:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	the restricted manager didnt work
2008-04-04T23:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	well, thats where you're wrong, it wasn't the best way
2008-04-04T23:29:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	was the best way for me
2008-04-04T23:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	well, no it wasn't, it was just the way you figured out, it most certainly wasn't the best way, even if it worked
2008-04-04T23:30:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	it worked. automatically whats so bad about envy anyway
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	use google, you'll see.
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	it isnt like automatix is it where it can frag your stuff
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	automatix and envy have a LOT of similarities in the problems they cause
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	neither automatix nor envy have ever caused me problems
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	lol, you are one lucky fella..
2008-04-04T23:32:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	and i used envy almost weekyl cause i had to reset xorg due to flash problems
2008-04-04T23:33:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	in the opast my atempts to reset my screen buggered my driver settings. so i had to reset it. now i killall npviewer
2008-04-04T23:34:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	well my personal experience says envy works. i dont know the code inside of it i have never looked
2008-04-04T23:41:00.000Z	Yowshi	IndyGunFreak	i am having a hard time finding an overwhelming response on google that would indicate bad crap about envy. i do see a fair number of pages touting this as a good and useful tool though
2008-04-04T23:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	ok.., well, i'm not gonna show you the forest for the trees.
2008-04-04T23:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Yowshi	googling for porn isn't gonna come up w/ pics for envy.. :)
