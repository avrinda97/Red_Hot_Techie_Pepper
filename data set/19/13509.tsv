2005-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	That wasn't my question. Does that put stuff all over the filesystem without 'dpkg' knowing about it?
2005-10-13T05:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	Then running it on ubuntu is NOT a good idea.
2005-10-13T05:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	Imagine it writing to a file that was also in a Ubuntu package. That's "broken packages".
2005-10-13T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	If it just puts files under a dir of its own, that's fine. If it extracts to all over the filesystem, it badness.
2005-10-13T06:02:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	Ok, so it created a compressed FS where it dumps its own stuff.
2005-10-13T06:03:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	Icky.
2005-10-13T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	cramfs app packages
2005-10-13T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	werto	Well, icky for me, perhaps sueful for others.
