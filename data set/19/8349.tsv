2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	d00d		only update i did was update to 28 kernel
2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	d00d		thats before i installd nvidi
2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	d00d		nvida*
2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	d00d		the lastest 9755
2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	d00d		I need it for my 8800
2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	wynd_	d00d	you use the nvidia binaries, through automatix, or what?
2007-04-14T07:30:00.000Z	d00d		I installed somthing from automatrix
2007-04-14T07:30:00.000Z	d00d		it wasnt nvidia maybe thats why ?
2007-04-14T07:30:00.000Z	wynd_	d00d	hmm doubt it
2007-04-14T07:30:00.000Z	d00d		i installed gesktop or smtg
2007-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	wynd_	d00d	if you used the regular Nvidia binaries from Nvidia themselves, you need to just find it and run it
2007-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	wynd_	d00d	if you used automatix to install it, I believe the command is automatix-reinstall-nvidia <-- or something of that nature
2007-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	d00d		but automatrix
2007-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	d00d		can u pick your verisons u want to install ?
2007-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	d00d		i need the lastest
2007-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	wynd_		well I believe the automatix installs the latest, but the best method is to grab it right from nvidia
2007-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	wynd_		and follow the directions very carefully
2007-04-14T07:33:00.000Z	d00d	wynd_	but i install the driver and then i type startx it works fine intill i reboot
2007-04-14T07:33:00.000Z	wynd_	d00d	very odd...
