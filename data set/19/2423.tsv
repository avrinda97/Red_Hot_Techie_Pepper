2010-04-17T06:25:00.000Z	radar3d		How do I get my webcam to work in ubuntu?  It is installed in my laptop.
2010-04-17T06:26:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	tryin to make it work with Flash?
2010-04-17T06:27:00.000Z	radar3d		I don't think so trying to use it with anything right now i have installed cheese and it says no camera, but specifically i want to use it with teamviewer CaptainTrek
2010-04-17T06:27:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	okay.  do me a favor: pastebin me the output of the commands (in terminal) of: lspci and lsusb
2010-04-17T06:28:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	type the command: lspci; lsusb

2010-04-17T06:32:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	the issue is that your system isn't even recognizing that the camera is there
2010-04-17T06:32:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	it would have been listed under one of those commands
2010-04-17T06:33:00.000Z	radar3d	CaptainTrek	ok so now what it lookslike it is there in the devicemanager
2010-04-17T06:34:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	in windows?
2010-04-17T06:34:00.000Z	radar3d	CaptainTrek	no ubuntu
2010-04-17T06:34:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	interesting
2010-04-17T06:35:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	it might just be a weird bug, I know that the webcam on my system isn't recognized in ubuntu even though the system says its there
2010-04-17T06:35:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	not sure what to do then

2010-04-17T06:37:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	interesting that the command line cant see the camera, considering everything GUI is just a front-end for terminal commands :P
2010-04-17T06:37:00.000Z	CaptainTrek		usually at least
2010-04-17T06:38:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	radar3d	i'm not sure exactly how to fix it unfortunately
