2009-06-08T08:07:00.000Z	mib_sctaruw9		could some one tell me how to install all the drivers for an asus m2npv-vm mother board?
2009-06-08T08:07:00.000Z	mib_sctaruw9		please...
2009-06-08T08:08:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	what on your board can't you use?
2009-06-08T08:10:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	is there anything specifially on your board you *can't* use without the closed source drivers? if not, you should *really* leave your drivers alone, or you can permenatly screw your computer up
2009-06-08T08:11:00.000Z	mib_sctaruw9	gartral	Yes, there are a couple of things, like special hardware firewall, and the chipset driver....
2009-06-08T08:12:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	the Linux firewall is probably faster, and lighter, and the chipset, that shouldn't need any special drivers, devices attached to the chipset need drivers, does your bluetooth/lan/wan all work?
2009-06-08T08:14:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	what comp do you have? I'll do some research on it and see what specifically these drivers do that core drivers can't
2009-06-08T08:24:00.000Z	mib_sctaruw9	gartral	My computer is an asus m2npv-vm

2009-06-08T08:30:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	i said it once, PLEASE bare with my, my system is SLOW
2009-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	and i just found it, those drivers are nothing more than repackaged Nvidia GFX drivers, which Ubuntu has better working ones, installing THAT *WILL* break your computer
2009-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	you dont want to... trust me
2009-06-08T08:34:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	Ubuntu is nothing liike windows, the latest drivers are almost *never* the best, don't trust what manufactuers want you to believe
2009-06-08T08:36:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	you're not listening... you dont want too, I can almost gaurentee these drivers will BREAK your computer!
2009-06-08T08:40:00.000Z	gartral	mib_sctaruw9	if you dont *need* and I MEAN *NEED* SLI... dont even attempt to install those drivers, if for whatever reason you *DO* think you need SLI, then please don't come here when your drivers break you nice new MoBo
