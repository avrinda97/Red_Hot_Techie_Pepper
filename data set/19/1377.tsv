2011-02-12T10:36:00.000Z	tsolox		what's a good ubuntu10.04 harddisk space, granting i'll install most of the goodies that comes with it via the internet..???
2011-02-12T10:36:00.000Z	tsolox		i'm setting up this box for my nephew..
2011-02-12T10:38:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	Can you use the entire hard drive or only part of it?
2011-02-12T10:38:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	i have all
2011-02-12T10:39:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	Do the simple method then, set it all as a single partition mounted on /, but leave however much RAM you have to set as swap
2011-02-12T10:39:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	It's not necessary to set Ubuntu up with different partitions for /usr/ /tmp/ and so on
2011-02-12T10:40:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	i know. My question is ,how much is a decent ubuntu hd size, granting i'll fetch some good software in synaptics...
2011-02-12T10:43:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	Like I said, just set it as the entire space and leave some for swap. Any software you get will go into the Ubuntu partition...
2011-02-12T10:43:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	i'm gonna partition this box...with dual windows..
2011-02-12T10:44:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	well, you said you could use the entire hard drive. How big is the drive?
2011-02-12T10:45:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	500G
2011-02-12T10:45:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	and i'm about to partition now
2011-02-12T10:45:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	Ah, I'd recommend ubuntu, windows and data
2011-02-12T10:46:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	I imagine about 40GB for Ubuntu, 60GB for Windows and 400GB for data
2011-02-12T10:46:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	And of course, swap for ubuntu
2011-02-12T10:47:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	i'll take 30GB...
2011-02-12T10:47:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	That's also fine
2011-02-12T10:48:00.000Z	BiPolah	tsolox	If he won't be adding any more stuff to it, 20Gb is probably fine
2011-02-12T10:48:00.000Z	tsolox	BiPolah	that's it!!20G...thanks
