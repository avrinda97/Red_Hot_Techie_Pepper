2009-04-08T10:41:00.000Z	raylu	botux	leoXsys: there's no need for ntfs support
2009-04-08T10:41:00.000Z	raylu	botux	but samba is basically a pain. try "smbclient -L"
2009-04-08T10:43:00.000Z	botux	raylu	its asking for parameters
2009-04-08T10:44:00.000Z	raylu	botux	do you know the hostname/ip of the machine that has the files shared?
2009-04-08T10:44:00.000Z	botux	raylu	its my ubuntu machine which im on
2009-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	raylu	botux	oh. then why do you need samba? smbclient -L localhost
2009-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	botux	raylu	because i wanna see my ubuntu shares on my vvista box
2009-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	raylu	botux	who uses the vista box? to avoid pain, i'd recommend getting an sftp/scp client on the vista box
2009-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	botux	raylu	i just got Connection to localhost failed (Error NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME)
2009-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	botux	raylu	when i used the command you sent me
2009-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	raylu	botux	i have no idea, sorry. can you answer my earlier question?
2009-04-08T10:48:00.000Z	botux	raylu	which one lol
2009-04-08T10:48:00.000Z	raylu	botux	 1:46:56       raylu> botux: who uses the vista box? to avoid pain, i'd recommend getting an sftp/scp client on the vista box
2009-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	botux	raylu	lol oh i do and i want to be able to share my music and video files between the 2
2009-04-08T10:50:00.000Z	raylu	botux	then, to avoid pain, i'd recommend getting an sftp/scp client for vista. filezilla and winscp are good choices
2009-04-08T10:50:00.000Z	raylu	botux	then, simply set up openssh-server (read: install and you're done)
2009-04-08T11:03:00.000Z	raylu	botux	inet addr:192.168.1.103
2009-04-08T11:03:00.000Z	botux	raylu	i tried i cant see samba at that address
2009-04-08T11:04:00.000Z	raylu	botux	m, no idea. talk to Sir_Brizz :P
