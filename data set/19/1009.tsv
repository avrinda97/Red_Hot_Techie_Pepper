2012-01-07T13:54:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	have you already tried enabling 3d acceleration, and installing guest additions?
2012-01-07T13:55:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	dude, first off COOL NAME. I've enabled 3d and 2d accel (that helps a bit), I don't really know what the guest addtions are, can you explain to me what they are and how to install them?
2012-01-07T13:57:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	googling the guest additons
2012-01-07T13:59:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	hostkey + d should download and mount guest additions on a running guest os
2012-01-07T14:00:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	guest additions are optimized drivers for virtualbox guests
2012-01-07T14:00:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	Trying it
2012-01-07T14:01:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	Dude will this install an nvidia driver? Because I apprently can't install an nvidia driver in windows because my card isn't detected (I know it's emulated in the guest OS)
2012-01-07T14:02:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	okay dude, I installed it what do I do now?
2012-01-07T14:04:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	Okay dude I installed the guest addons and restarted and now the silverlight plugin keeps crashing!
2012-01-07T14:04:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	since it's a virtual machine, the guest os won't be able to see your physical hardware, the best you can do is install drivers in the guest that work well with the virtualized hardware.
2012-01-07T14:05:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	Does that mean I can't get real 3d/2d acceration? is that whats casuing the sliverlight plugin to keep crashing?
2012-01-07T14:09:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	there do seem to be a lot of people experiennceing this same problem with silverlight and the 3d experimental drivers
2012-01-07T14:10:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	dude I tried installing the drivers and enabling accelration and it crashed the plugin
2012-01-07T14:10:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	netflix is still choppy , but it works without accelaraton enabled
2012-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	dude, I enabled 2d accel but not 3d accel and it works WONDERFULLY
2012-01-07T14:29:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	take a look at gnome fallback
2012-01-07T14:31:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	Is that the "classic" version of gnome in ubuntu 11.10? If so, I tried it and hated it, there was no point in me using it because I hated the interface, and it didn't have the sticky windows on the side pannels things
2012-01-07T14:32:00.000Z	codemonkey1337	overclucker	so dude, is it possible to install gnome2 on 11.10 and have it work if I force the package to install or not
2012-01-07T14:33:00.000Z	overclucker	codemonkey1337	it's not the samee as classic
