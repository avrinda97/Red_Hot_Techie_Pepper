2008-09-14T18:38:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	the official installer has probably messed up your xorg.conf

2008-09-14T18:39:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	if you want the official fglrx badly you'll have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf manually
2008-09-14T18:39:00.000Z	uffo	paper_cc	do you have some edited xorg.conf
2008-09-14T18:40:00.000Z	uffo	paper_cc	i do not know what to write there

2008-09-14T18:40:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	if you just want to repair there should be an uninstaller somewhere
2008-09-14T18:41:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	if there isn't, pastebin your xorg.conf
2008-09-14T18:41:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	and the X log
2008-09-14T18:41:00.000Z	uffo	paper_cc	i repaired it was simple gui assisted, but i want put driver back in working condition
2008-09-14T18:42:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	do you really hate the Ubuntu proprietary drivers manager so much?
2008-09-14T18:42:00.000Z	uffo	paper_cc	it showed enabled if i installed driver
2008-09-14T18:43:00.000Z	paper_cc	uffo	you should uninstall the driver via its installer and have it installed with the driver manager if you want to work that way
2008-09-14T18:44:00.000Z	uffo	paper_cc	ok i boot to ubuntu and try this too
