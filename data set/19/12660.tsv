2006-03-01T12:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	Canada of course !!
2006-03-01T12:39:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	yea, looks like they have gold won already, finland doesnt stand much of a chance with a 3-10 score with this end almost over
2006-03-01T12:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	aye
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	Sweet I'm from Nova Scotia.
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	awesome, my brother in law works over there
2006-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	I am also 1/2 Newfie, the good half :)
2006-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	haha
2006-03-01T12:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	might be faster/easier to backup your /home/ directory and do a fresh install which you can re-partition your drive during install.
2006-03-01T12:46:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	yea thats the thing. dialup here for about another month-month and a half. and i have a hell of a lot of stuff installed in ubuntu
2006-03-01T12:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	do a de-frag on your hard drive first in windows if you want to re-size the windows partition.
2006-03-01T12:48:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	yea i know the process for resizing, at least with Partition Magic 8, did it on my laptop thrice times.. but PM8 doesnt want to touch this drive, some error
2006-03-01T12:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	ahh I see, it should be ok backing everything up but you'll have to edit the /etc/fstab to reflect the changes in your filesystem as soon as the files get finished copying back to your harddrive.
2006-03-01T12:48:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	do you know a good, EASY, gui partiion manager i could load on a livecd that will resize ntfs?
2006-03-01T12:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	try doing a scandisk on the drive. Maybe your disk is getting ready to die :(
2006-03-01T12:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chris_Tucker	gparted
2006-03-01T12:52:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	LinuxJones	well i dont think that the drive is close to dieing, fairly new, smart enabled (that saved my data on a drive once, alerting me just before it went) i think its the windows flags MS has stamped on the partitions
