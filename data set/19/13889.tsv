2004-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	defunkt		hey ribs can you help me out in a pm?
2004-12-23T14:08:00.000Z	defunkt		well
2004-12-23T14:08:00.000Z	defunkt		i am going to go back to windows
2004-12-23T14:08:00.000Z	defunkt		too much stuff that won't work in linux
2004-12-23T14:09:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	if you tell us what you're finding isn't working, we'd love to try and fix/help you
2004-12-23T14:10:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	you still haven't mentioned what you think the problem is...
2004-12-23T14:12:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	1st.  Can you get any other program to play sound?
2004-12-23T14:15:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	what errors does Quake 3 give when you load it up?  Does it mention sound.
2004-12-23T14:15:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	try running:   esddsp q3demo
2004-12-23T14:16:00.000Z	defunkt	sladen	command not found
2004-12-23T14:17:00.000Z	defunkt	sladen	it mentions no errors
2004-12-23T14:18:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	sudo apt-get install esound-clients
2004-12-23T14:18:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	befor that can you do a quick  sudo ps aux | grep [e] sd  and check that the problem is ESD holding the sound device open
2004-12-23T14:18:00.000Z	defunkt	sladen	still nothing
2004-12-23T14:20:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	esd is a program that shares the 1 sound card between the many programs that want to use the sound card at once
2004-12-23T14:21:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	most GNOME applications know how to talk to esd directly
2004-12-23T14:22:00.000Z	defunkt	sladen	this is an onboard nvmax card
2004-12-23T14:22:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	Quake3 doesn't.  Either you need to give it full control of the sound card by stopping esd (killall esd), or you need to teach Quake3 to use ESD by running it with  esddsp
2004-12-23T14:23:00.000Z	sladen	defunkt	esddsp  can be found in  esound-clients  which you can install with 'sudo apt-get install esound-clients'
