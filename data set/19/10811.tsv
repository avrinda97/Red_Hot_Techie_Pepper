2012-02-24T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	do you have a question about it, or do you just want to know if people are using it ?
2012-02-24T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	do you want to know if people are using it, or do you have a question about netcut ?
2012-02-24T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	what does it matter if anyones used it - but if you have a question about it, just ask what you want to know
2012-02-24T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	that's nothing to do with ubuntu - that depends on your hot spot software
2012-02-24T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	it depends on the hot spot you are running
2012-02-24T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	what is your hotspot device ?
2012-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	what is the device ?
2012-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	what is your hotspot device (as in physical device)
2012-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	no
2012-02-24T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	what device (is it a netgear for example) is your wireless hot spot device
2012-02-24T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	I'll ask one more time
2012-02-24T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	what is the physical device make/model/brand
2012-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	this won't end well,
2012-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	lets try a a different approach
2012-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	is the wireless hot spot YOUR device, do you own it ?
2012-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	then this conversation is over
2012-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	talk to the person who owns the device
2012-02-24T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	expertarun	I get the impression you are trying to miss-use someome elses hotspot
