2007-09-23T14:27:00.000Z	bjwebb		hmm, what package do i want for java plugin?
2007-09-23T14:27:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	you can use "apt-cache search java"
2007-09-23T14:28:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	hmm is it in multiverse?
2007-09-23T14:28:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	do it in the terminal
2007-09-23T14:30:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	i don't want to install from multiverse
2007-09-23T14:31:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	what do you mean? you want to install it from the package you got from the official site?
2007-09-23T14:32:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	well i thought java was open source now, so why's it in multiverse
2007-09-23T14:33:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	the java plugin, that is. it's in multiverse just like flash player.
2007-09-23T14:33:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	hmm, i want to avoid propeitary stuff
2007-09-23T14:34:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	okay. but how would you be able to run and read files that pertain to java?
2007-09-23T14:34:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	i dunno, but like i say why is java dev kit open source, but plugin isn't?
2007-09-23T14:36:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	I don't know. Maybe Sun wants a centralized, working plugin. Otherwise, users would get confused as to what plugin to use.
2007-09-23T14:36:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	i dunno
2007-09-23T14:37:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	thanks anyway
2007-09-23T14:37:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	because if there are many versions of the java plugin, people would get confused. Like if there are different flash players...
2007-09-23T14:38:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	lol, i use gnash
2007-09-23T14:38:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	is gnash a java plugin? I didn't know that.
2007-09-23T14:38:00.000Z	bjwebb	curious101	nah im refering to your comment bout flash
2007-09-23T14:39:00.000Z	curious101	bjwebb	oh I see. I use the official flash plugin.
