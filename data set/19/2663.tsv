2010-02-05T18:04:00.000Z	obiwan_		guys quick question
2010-02-05T18:04:00.000Z	obiwan_		were are source programs installed in ubuntu, /usr or /usr/local ?
2010-02-05T18:05:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	you mean programs you compile yourself ?
2010-02-05T18:06:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	have you tried finding them with the locate command yet ?
2010-02-05T18:06:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	but locate is for local files
2010-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	i didn an apt-cache search program and couldn't find it
2010-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	yes this is true, it will find any file on your filesystem
2010-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	i know where the file is, i just want to know where to compile the source i got
2010-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	that is because apt-cache search does not involve self compiled programs
2010-02-05T18:08:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	sure, that's why i'm trying to compile it, cause it isn't in repos, so i'm wondering if should i make install it at /usr or /usr/local
2010-02-05T18:08:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	mmm i think you're askign a different question here. is it really this : how do i find the dependancies of a program im compiling by binary name ?
2010-02-05T18:09:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	have you checked on ubuntu forums about the software (maybe someone already tried and documented something like this )
2010-02-05T18:09:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	hmm maybe , what i want to know is, self compiled programs should be installed at /usr or /usr/local , but maybe that question is under the one you said
2010-02-05T18:10:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	no you're right my assumption of your question was not right... and to add more to your confusion i have heard of people saying /var/opt is a place to install self compiled programs (but why?)
2010-02-05T18:10:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	nope i didn't, but this isn't a question about the software, it's a generic question. whenever you download a tarball to install a program, where do you install it? /usr or /usr/local?
2010-02-05T18:10:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	in any case, any time i configure, make , make install, i just let it go where it wants
2010-02-05T18:11:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	actually it's supposed to be installed there
2010-02-05T18:11:00.000Z	_skywalker	obiwan_	i think there is a good reason for it but i can't remember why
2010-02-05T18:11:00.000Z	obiwan_	_skywalker	but everybody installs it at /usr or /usr/local but i'm not sure where, some distros use /usr and others use /usr/local
