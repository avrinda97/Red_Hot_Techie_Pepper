2010-02-28T08:19:00.000Z	pw-toxic_		it works with wine
2010-02-28T08:20:00.000Z	pw-toxic_		i didnt get my original CS4 working until today
2010-02-28T08:20:00.000Z	blakkheim	pw-toxic_	wine is not an emulator
2010-02-28T08:20:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	what then?
2010-02-28T08:20:00.000Z	blakkheim	pw-toxic_	windows api layer
2010-02-28T08:21:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	yes and therfore it emulates windows?!
2010-02-28T08:21:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	it makes the program feel beeing windows
2010-02-28T08:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	pw-toxic_	rsync?
2010-02-28T08:23:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	rsync is a command line tool - i'm talking of a gui
2010-02-28T08:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	pw-toxic_	you don't really need a gui for that, but there are rsync guis available..
2010-02-28T08:24:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	i guess the tool uses rsync
2010-02-28T08:24:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	rsync is just too complicated to manage a bigger amount of backups
2010-02-28T08:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	pw-toxic_	i use it for fairly large backups on multiple systems and don't find it complicated
2010-02-28T08:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	pw-toxic_	is there something you prefer over it?
2010-02-28T08:25:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	its not about the size of the backup, but the amount of several different backups and how to manage them
2010-02-28T08:25:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	blakkheim	i just cant remember simple commands that i only use  times a year
