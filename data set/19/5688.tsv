2010-09-03T01:02:00.000Z	Stale		Anybody knows how to still get the best wine release package for an unsupported Ubuntu 7.04 (RAM size matters to me)?
2010-09-03T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	use a supported release
2010-09-03T01:04:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	I would if its requirement was not so demanding. Nowadays, most Linux distributions just go for the 'latest' (yet also unstable) things.
2010-09-03T01:04:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	8.04 is supported still
2010-09-03T01:06:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	I understand the 8.04 requires 198 RAM?
2010-09-03T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	if that's too much then don't use gnome and use lighter alternatives for your programs.  If that's too much of a hassle, then ubuntu is not the right distro for you
2010-09-03T01:27:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	yes
2010-09-03T01:27:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	in general
2010-09-03T01:28:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
2010-09-03T01:28:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	how much by the way? I intend to follow up with alternate releases (as they work with my 7.04 and 8.04 experience).
2010-09-03T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	here's 8.04: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/installation-guide/i386/minimum-hardware-reqts.html
2010-09-03T01:30:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	but no way will a desktop be even semi-usable with 64mb despite what that document says...
2010-09-03T01:31:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	thank you for your help, jrib. I think I am not sure what RAM really means, but I was just following the CD instructions...
2010-09-03T01:31:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	how much ram do you have?
2010-09-03T01:33:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	for my laptop, I have 3.00 GB of RAM. It's those new computers. What I was aiming for are those older computers.
2010-09-03T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	Stale	how much on the older ones?
2010-09-03T01:34:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	I'll be right back (am checking on the most oldest system I have).
2010-09-03T01:34:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	and then will make an estimate.
2010-09-03T01:48:00.000Z	Stale	jrib	dope, he's gone.
