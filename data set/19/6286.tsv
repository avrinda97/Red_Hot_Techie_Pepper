2008-02-18T22:13:00.000Z	vinay		is xubuntu worth trying out?
2008-02-18T22:13:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	it is if you have a rather slow machine
2008-02-18T22:17:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	i think its more for school computers, like in a lab or something
2008-02-18T22:26:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	x86 is 32bit x86_64 (as the link you pasted says) is for 64 bit
2008-02-18T22:33:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	please dont link to sites like that here, also poweriso has a linux version
2008-02-18T22:33:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	also, you dont need it to mount isos
2008-02-18T22:35:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	source code of what?
2008-02-18T22:35:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	i doubt you would want to look at the source code, it would take lifetimes to read and go through it all
2008-02-18T22:36:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	instead you can view the source code of specific packages, as Pici suggested, or the kernel sources are always interesting :)
2008-02-18T22:40:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	dont link people to things that they can get from the repositories
2008-02-18T22:42:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	sorry, i dont mean to be a big meanie, its just that almost anything that you install in ubuntu can be done from the repositories, no need to go looking for programs ;)
2008-02-18T22:51:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	its hard to answer such a question, there are so many different things that you could help improve, and to do all of them would be simply impossible, if i were you i would just use it for awhile, become familiar with the environment then start recognizing things that interest you and go from there
2008-02-18T23:02:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	the biggest threat to your linux machine is you :)
2008-02-18T23:08:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	you are being asked for your user password, to run commands using sudo
2008-02-18T23:09:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	like i told you before, you are the biggest threat to your linux machine, sudo is a security measure to make sure that YOU know what you are doing before somethign that could potentially compromise your machine happens
2008-02-18T23:17:00.000Z	vinay	MasterShrak	ROCKSSSSS!! thx for ur excellent answers. since how many years have u been using linux??
2008-02-18T23:17:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	about 4 or so, i started when ubuntu was first released 4.10 (oct 2004) :)
2008-02-18T23:21:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	im a bit older, but thats as far as my experience goes back, ive used different distros though, havent been on ubuntu this whole time :)
2008-02-18T23:32:00.000Z	MasterShrak	vinay	its just generally not a good idea to link to torrent trackers here, the ops may not like it
