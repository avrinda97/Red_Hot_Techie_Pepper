2009-12-09T08:32:00.000Z	Johnn		okay. Thanks for the help.
2009-12-09T08:32:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	are you trying to install prop driver for x 1400 ?
2009-12-09T08:37:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	ic, go ahead, the ati-manufacturer's often don't work for the lower models
2009-12-09T08:39:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	fglrx is open source, that could work, to generate an xorg, log off to cmd-line, do : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-12-09T08:41:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	did you check the hardware-drivers section ?
2009-12-09T08:42:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	you ran dpkg..  and have no /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
2009-12-09T08:47:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	I just looked it up, the open radeon driver will do the job
2009-12-09T08:49:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	no, thatsthe os'es radeon
2009-12-09T08:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	sudo synaptic, search for radeon
2009-12-09T08:57:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	you're done for that model then
2009-12-09T08:57:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	what is the goal ?
2009-12-09T08:59:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	an xorg should be there already, can try if catalyst-center (synaptic) runs on that , else that might be a problem on that btw I'm overasked
2009-12-09T09:01:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	fglrx-amdcccle
2009-12-09T09:08:00.000Z	DasEi	Johnn	possibly fulfilled or forgot sudo
