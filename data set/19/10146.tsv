2006-07-26T13:54:00.000Z	m3talc0re		oh come on, this is rediculous

2006-07-26T13:56:00.000Z	m3talc0re		system>administration>login window
2006-07-26T13:56:00.000Z	m3talc0re		i forgot what to type in the terminal, but i did last night and it told me it couldn't access it or something
2006-07-26T13:57:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	what's the problem?
2006-07-26T14:14:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	run this command - what does it say?    echo /etc/rc2.d/????dm
2006-07-26T14:16:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	run this command - what does it say?    echo /etc/rc2.d/????dm
2006-07-26T14:17:00.000Z	m3talc0re	dooglus	/etc/rc2.d/S13gdm /etc/rc2.d/S99kdm
2006-07-26T14:17:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	if you stop or kill kdm, all your windows will vanish
2006-07-26T14:17:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	those 'S's stand for 'start' - it's starting both gdm and kdm
2006-07-26T14:18:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	do a "sudo mv /etc/rc2.d/{S,K}99kdm" to disable kdm
2006-07-26T14:19:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	no, any terminal will do.  that will just affect the next time(s) you boot
2006-07-26T14:20:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	you can go to ctrl-alt-f1 and "sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop" then "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start" to stop kdm and start gdm.  but the 'mv' command I told you will fix it for future boots
2006-07-26T14:24:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	y/w y/w
2006-07-27T16:11:00.000Z	dooglus	m3talc0re	try control-l
