2005-06-27T07:38:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	are you using mplayer?
2005-06-27T07:40:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	sudo apt-get install totem-xine
2005-06-27T07:41:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	set your vo to SDL, uses less CPU
2005-06-27T07:42:00.000Z	kong0	zyth	where?
2005-06-27T07:42:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	man you lost me.  What media player are you using? Totem or Mplayer?
2005-06-27T07:45:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	if you are using totem, install totem-xine.  If you want to use mplayer, you will need to read the mplayer manpage ('man mplayer') and read about how to edit your config file to specify video and audio output
2005-06-27T07:46:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	do you have the win32codecs installed?
2005-06-27T08:16:00.000Z	zyth	kong0	man, if you'd read the documentation, it'd be easier for you.
