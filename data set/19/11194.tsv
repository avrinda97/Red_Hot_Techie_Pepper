2007-06-26T13:24:00.000Z	administrator		@ timfrost thanks again thats some crazy stuff
2007-06-26T11:23:00.000Z	administrator		I have a problem with my second HDD, theres a lost+found folder in it (with an x on the folder) that I can't delete nor can I add stuff to this drive its under media
2007-06-26T11:24:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	sudo and lost+found needs to be on the drive for journaling to work right on it
2007-06-26T11:25:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	yes but fi yuo want users to be allowed to put files there might want to look at umask or dmask or fmask
2007-06-26T11:27:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	you want the Filepermissions one then go to the volume permission on that page
2007-06-26T11:28:00.000Z	administrator	kitche	it says owner is root (root)
2007-06-26T11:29:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	sure you can use sudo
2007-06-26T11:32:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	umm well if it's a seperate drive you can sudo cp files over to it or start programs with gksu if you are using the gui that needs access to that drive
2007-06-26T11:32:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	but if you want you can chown the mount point which is not really recommended if you want to make it easier
2007-06-26T11:33:00.000Z	kitche	administrator	then the filepermission url I gave you eariler will work if you look at the volume permissions link on it
2007-06-26T11:38:00.000Z	administrator	kitche	sudo chmod = media/disk  doesn't work
