2007-07-03T10:40:00.000Z	lgc		Hi! How can I mount an USB disk (actually, my former fixed HDD usb-ized) that doesn't seem to get recognized?
2007-07-03T10:42:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	are you sure the hardware is working?
2007-07-03T10:43:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	yep.
2007-07-03T10:43:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	does it show up in 'sudo fdisk -l' ?
2007-07-03T10:45:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	'fdisk -l' gives no output. Strange, eh?
2007-07-03T10:45:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	/sudo/
2007-07-03T10:45:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	Ah, ok...
2007-07-03T10:46:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	but it doesn't recognize /dev/sdb.
2007-07-03T10:46:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	check cabling and connectors. it's a hardware problem, i'm 99% sure
2007-07-03T10:47:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	and check bios for disabled usb-ports
2007-07-03T10:48:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	Hey, it worked! I just plugged the disk's 2nd USB connector in and bingo!
2007-07-03T10:48:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	I KNW THAT :-)
2007-07-03T10:48:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	you were right! Thanks!
2007-07-03T10:48:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	I knew that
2007-07-03T10:49:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	but isn't the second one just power?
2007-07-03T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	that depends
2007-07-03T10:49:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	on what?
2007-07-03T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	lgc	on the hardware design... obviuosly it's not in your case
2007-07-03T10:50:00.000Z	lgc	stefg	OK. Thanks again.
