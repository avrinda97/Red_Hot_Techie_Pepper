2007-03-21T05:31:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	how do you know it isn't using it?
2007-03-21T05:31:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	it's not listed when i run 'mount'.  don't swap partitions need to be mounted?
2007-03-21T05:31:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	not really
2007-03-21T05:31:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	alos, kde memory monitor thing (kinfocenter) says swap is not avliable, and arrenlex's method
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	what does  grep swap /etc/fstab  say?
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	any idea?
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	type  blkd | grep swap 
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	command not found - what package is that from?
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	sorry, that's  blkid | grep swap , i missed an i
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	oh.  that returns nothing
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	hm, just type  blkid  and pastebin the output
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	pastbin both things
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	doh =) then i wonder why /etc/fstab is listing one...
2007-03-21T05:36:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	no clue...i thought i had a swap partition!
2007-03-21T05:37:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	well, do you have some unused (unpartitioned) space on the drive, at least, that you could use for such a partition?
2007-03-21T05:37:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	i believe so, i'll go and make the partition
2007-03-21T05:38:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	i don't think i want tot do that
2007-03-21T05:38:00.000Z	bkudria	LJL	in any case, i need it for suspending, so i don't think a file will work
2007-03-21T05:39:00.000Z	LJL	bkudria	there you're quite possibly right
