2008-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	Don		where can I get /etc/resolv.conf, so I can get kppp working in 8.04?
2008-10-20T07:52:00.000Z	Don		orbix, yes dialup in kde on ununtu 8.04
2008-10-20T07:53:00.000Z	Don		orbixx, because that error i get when trying to dial
2008-10-20T07:53:00.000Z	Don		it telling me it missing
2008-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	Don		Dunno why you ask about dns servers
2008-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	Don		nothing to do with dial up on kppp
2008-10-20T07:56:00.000Z	Don		orbixx, I use kppp on many distros, this 8.04 has /etc/resolv.conf missing
2008-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	the_lost_one	Don	if you miss that file, then just create it
2008-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	Don		the lost one, tried many times
2008-10-20T07:58:00.000Z	Don		tried many times
2008-10-20T07:58:00.000Z	the_lost_one	Don	and what happens? is there some aplication removing it all times or?
2008-10-20T07:58:00.000Z	Don		the lost one it not there and I cannot create
2008-10-20T07:59:00.000Z	the_lost_one	Don	what happens when you open a terminal and tipe sudo touch /etc/resolv.cof ?
2008-10-20T07:59:00.000Z	Don	zigzags	kde
2008-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	Don		the lost one, nothing
2008-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	the_lost_one	Don	that≈õ good
2008-10-20T08:04:00.000Z	the_lost_one	Don	so, you have now created a resolv.conf empty file, maybe you must add some dns servers, or maybe kppp should complete the work
2008-10-20T08:04:00.000Z	Don		the lost one, I give up, sticking with Vista thanks
2008-10-20T08:05:00.000Z	the_lost_one	Don	cool mate :-)
