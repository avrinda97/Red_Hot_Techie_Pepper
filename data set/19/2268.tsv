2010-05-29T03:13:00.000Z	blue_anna		when I type shift+space I don't get a space, but it looks like a space. "lsmod |â€‰grep v4" won't run on my machine, for example
2010-05-29T03:13:00.000Z	Random832	blue_anna	your shift-space is probably a nbsp
2010-05-29T03:13:00.000Z	blue_anna	Random832	not according to the xkb/symbols file it isn't
2010-05-29T03:14:00.000Z	Random832		no, it's a 'thin space'
2010-05-29T03:14:00.000Z	blue_anna	Random832	key <SPCE>  { [  space,         space,    thinspace,      emspace ] };
2010-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	Random832		and you're sure you're using shift and not altgr?
2010-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	Random832		what is your keyboard layout?
2010-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	blue_anna		it's es
2010-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	Random832		do you have | on a key, or do you have to press alt to get it?
2010-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	Random832		altgr-space is more reasonable than shit-space
2010-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	Random832		crap, i mean shift-space
2010-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	blue_anna	Random832	I modified the es symbols file to have that space line in there so I wouldn't have that problem, it still keeps it.
2010-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	Random832		i swear that wasn't on purpose
2010-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	blue_anna	Random832	yeah that's what I thought :)
2010-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	Random832		i don't know - i on't know much about xkb
2010-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	blue_anna	Random832	I don't think it is xkb, but it isn't in my compose files or anything so I'm not sure ..
2010-05-29T03:17:00.000Z	Random832		well that symbol stuff is xkb stuff
2010-05-29T03:17:00.000Z	Random832		i don't know enough to know how to help you, sry
2010-05-29T03:17:00.000Z	blue_anna	Random832	nps
