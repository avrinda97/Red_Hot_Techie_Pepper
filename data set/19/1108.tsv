2011-12-22T07:01:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	it has an IGP, an i810 based GPU that has no working driver aside from Vesa, I added an old PCI Geforce 6200 I had collecting dust, as before the BIOS doesn't have an option to disable the IGP, is there a way to make it be completely ignored in linux?
2011-12-22T07:01:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	Ah got it,, you cant disable the interrupts
2011-12-22T07:02:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	what you might be able to do is, you will still need to rely on the internal when your booting, but if you configure X to use your other video card (by configuring the device section), you should be able to use the other gfx card once your booted into the OS
2011-12-22T07:04:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	ok, so how do I do that?
2011-12-22T07:05:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	you need to reconfigure the device section. basically its a matter of putting the PCI id of the better video card in the Device section and specifying the driver module to load
2011-12-22T07:18:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	you mean my xorg.conf? Cause all I see is the 6200 http://pastebin.com/MW7EhuzL But in LSHW it's still listed as 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE http://pastebin.com/tyrx2N1T
2011-12-22T07:19:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	thats your intel card, not your nvidia card.. does the system not see it? try lspci | grep VGA, you should get 2 entries
2011-12-22T07:20:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	all I got was:  01:06.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV44A [GeForce 6200] (rev a1)
2011-12-22T07:21:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	.. It doesnt even see your other car
2011-12-22T07:21:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	some BIOS automatically redirect interrupts
2011-12-22T07:23:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	yet if I hit ctrl+alt+f1 or run a game like Braid I get a black screen, at startup the bios posts to the 6200, but once Linux starts booting it goes blank till I hit the Nvidia driver splash pre login prompt
2011-12-22T07:23:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	its only using the one nvidia card
2011-12-22T07:24:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	other full screen games like Osmos, NAEV or Aquaria all display on the 6200 though
2011-12-22T07:24:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	dude, ONLY your 6200 is working
2011-12-22T07:24:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	your other card isnt getting an IRQ, it CANT run
2011-12-22T07:26:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	so any ideas on why I can't drop to the shell when crap hits the fan?
2011-12-22T07:26:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	probably because something isnt configured right..
2011-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	intok	DrPenguin	well I've set nothing out of the ordinary, and let the Nvidia driver GUI set the xorg.conf
2011-12-22T07:29:00.000Z	DrPenguin	intok	thats not enough.. you usally have to edit things both inside and outside the xorg.conf
