2008-03-11T23:25:00.000Z	Mikey	amenado	Will this work form the live cd?
2008-03-11T23:25:00.000Z	amenado	Mikey	I believe it does, you may have to chroot  to /  not sure..
2008-03-11T23:26:00.000Z	Mikey	amenado	Thats my problem I can't figure out how to get chroot to work on ubuntu
2008-03-11T23:26:00.000Z	Mikey	amenado	I know how to do it on gentoo linux
2008-03-11T23:30:00.000Z	amenado	Mikey	you dont have a good initrd on the drive?
2008-03-11T23:31:00.000Z	Mikey	amenado	I do not believe so.  I get ramdisk erros
2008-03-11T23:31:00.000Z	amenado	Mikey	you have mounted the correct partition where /boot/grub normally resides?
2008-03-11T23:33:00.000Z	amenado	Mikey	then you can  without chrooting    grub-install --root-directory=/boot  /dev/sdax  where x is the partition where you know /boot should reside
