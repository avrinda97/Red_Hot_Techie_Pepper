2009-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	what's better, what can you tell me?
2009-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	linux	n-iCe	it supports bigger file systems and a new writing algorithm for better defrag on the fly
2009-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	linux	n-iCe	there maybe more features...anyone else know anymore
2009-08-31T07:27:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	ok, but in a home pc, will be there differences?
2010-08-09T20:47:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	use sudo
2010-08-09T20:48:00.000Z	linux	n-iCe	im using it the problem is that drive is mounted and i can access some files on it but most of them is denied
2010-08-09T20:48:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	chmod?
2010-08-09T20:49:00.000Z	linux	n-iCe	will try now
2010-08-09T20:49:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	use -R
2010-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	linux	n-iCe	hah thats it thx but i still cant understand if i was able to open some files there why others was still denied ?
2010-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	was the drive being used in Windows?
2010-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	sure, but -R is to include all files and folders
2010-08-09T20:51:00.000Z	linux	n-iCe	nope i erase it fully mbr to zero atc . . and then create ext2 filesystem
2010-08-09T20:52:00.000Z	n-iCe	linux	weirdo, fixed now anyway correct?
