2012-04-01T17:57:00.000Z	atomicity		why does ctrl + alt + backspace not work anymore!!! noooo!!!
2012-04-01T17:57:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	nozap has been set by default for a few years now
2012-04-01T17:58:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	yeah, I also know that. It was a cry of desperation. My X suddenly decided it should turn the screen off.
2012-04-01T18:07:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	what do you know, it worked :)
2012-04-01T19:24:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	yes but you cannot jump releases except for lts -> lts
2012-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	what do you mean?
2012-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	oh, you can't skip one
2012-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	if you want to go 10.10-> 11.10 you have to go through 11.04 first, but you can jump 10.04->12.04
2012-04-01T19:26:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	but that only means an extra time investment right?
2012-04-01T19:26:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	no other hassle
2012-04-01T19:28:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	at some point it makes more sense to just reinstall, but theoretically it should work. given how well the user data vs system data is encapsulated and the ability to do things like !clone all the installed apps, i usually end up reinstalling every couple of years anyways
2012-04-01T19:29:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	I'm used to rolling-release distros
2012-04-01T19:29:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	this concept of an os version number is new to me
2012-04-01T19:29:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	in principle its not different. its just rolling once every 6 months instead of everyday
2012-04-01T19:31:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	will apt warn me when I need to upgrade (or I just run dist-upgrade) or what? I unpinned ubuntu software center, it seems unnecesarry
2012-04-01T19:33:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	so there are some confusing terms with this. apt-get --upgrade upgrades packages with new security releases/bug fixes but not feature improvements. sometimes there are conflicts within bug fixes (ie fix A must be applied before B, or A and B must be applied simulataneously) and that gets you an apt-get --dist-upgrade, but that is NOT an upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10. those come with another script do-release-upgrade (and a gui f
2012-04-01T19:35:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	thats not really true. ms update pushes "kernel" updates relatively frequently
2012-04-01T19:38:00.000Z	escott	atomicity	they also have a different market. their primary retail market is not their consumers but their oems. why bother making it easier for a retail user to update their os when you can just push a brand new pc on them
2012-04-01T19:40:00.000Z	atomicity	escott	Yeah, I agree. the 'retarded' was meant 'for the end user', not for ms. FOr them, the scheme is obviously profitable, and if you don't have a subscription model the only way you can make long term support work is by major versions.
