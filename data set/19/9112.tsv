2008-01-12T04:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	thats an interesting prob, never heard of that one.
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	would 64-bit thing have anything to do there..i've never heard of it either
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	i'm not really familiar w/ 64bit, but i wouldn't think so.
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	 and I've never heard of Windows touching grub unless one reinstalls windows..so this kind of confuses me
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	very true.... so how ar eyou here right now?... are yo on the live CD?
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	no a different machine :)
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	oh ok.
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	the pc thats messed up, is it running XP?
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	yep
2008-01-12T04:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	well, if you can get an XP boot disk, and get to DOS, you can run fixmbr and fixboot   that will erase the masterboot record, and the 1st boot sector, which should clear out grub, and allow you to boot straight to Windows
2008-01-12T04:49:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	thanks..that way I'll have at least one OS up :)
2008-01-12T04:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	yeah,t hats what i'm thinking, then once you do that, you can either 1.  reinstall 32bit ubuntu(if you think thats the prob), or attempt to use the Live CD to reinstall Grub*(which i can't really help w/, sorry)
2008-01-12T04:51:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	would you think installing ubuntu on a different physical hard drive would help ?
2008-01-12T04:52:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	and I've already tried the Live CD grub thing..not very successful :)
2008-01-12T04:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	ok, so thats no joy.
2008-01-12T04:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	well, you'll have a bunch of space that Windows won't be able to see on your primaryd rive(however big your ubuntu partition is).. so you'd have to partition/reformat it also.
2008-01-12T04:54:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	yea that too :)..should'nt be a problem once I get ubuntu working
2008-01-12T04:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arag0rn	good luck.. never heard that one, doesn't make any sense, i guess worst comes to worst(assuming you have a reasonably current backup), you could completely reinstall both OS's
2008-01-12T04:55:00.000Z	arag0rn	IndyGunFreak	agreed :)..just poped the cd back in
