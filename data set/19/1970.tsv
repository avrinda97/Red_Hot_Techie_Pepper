2010-12-14T06:19:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Have you tried marking VLC for re-installation?
2010-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	you mean uninstall and reinstall vlc?
2010-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Yes effectively speaking
2010-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	IF that doesn't work delete ~/.vlc
2010-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	no, but i didnt think that would help since i tried movie player and gnome mplayer and its the same problem
2010-12-14T06:23:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	WHat is in place of no video? blue screen? Black screen?
2010-12-14T06:23:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	black screen
2010-12-14T06:23:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	I wonder if the "xv" output (xvideo) is working...
2010-12-14T06:24:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	idk about that. how do i check?
2010-12-14T06:24:00.000Z	Diamondcite		I'm too use to using "mplayer" the command line..
2010-12-14T06:25:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Assuming it's installed.. try "mplayer -vo x11 /path/to/video.here"
2010-12-14T06:28:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	that worked! do you know what the problem is now and what i should do to fix this?
2010-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Your xvideo extension seems to be broken, unfortunately I don't know how to fix that at the moment.
2010-12-14T06:30:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Are you on an ATI graphic card?
2010-12-14T06:30:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	damn. no, its nvidia. its an old acer laptop
2010-12-14T06:31:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Did you recently do anything with cairo-dock?
2010-12-14T06:32:00.000Z	hblount	Diamondcite	i dont think so because i dont know what that is...
2010-12-14T06:34:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hblount	Not sure what is causing xvideo to not work with the nvidia driver at the moment.. please try another person.
