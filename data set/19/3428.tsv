2009-08-14T04:30:00.000Z	emil111		Hello, I'm new to ubuntu and I have a question about running from a live CD
2009-08-14T04:30:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	go ahead
2009-08-14T04:31:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	look to see what's mounted, using command "mount"
2009-08-14T04:31:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	^
2009-08-14T04:32:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	then you better umount anything that looks like a harddrive. :)
2009-08-14T04:33:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	pastebin your output
2009-08-14T04:33:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	but question - is there a really good reason why you don't just shut down, take out the hd, then boot again? that would be... easier :)
2009-08-14T04:36:00.000Z	emil111	nanotube	the reason is it would be quicker,  and I want to know if I can do it without destroying anything.... for curiosity, for learning :)
2009-08-14T04:37:00.000Z	emil111	nanotube	more specifically, I'm chatting to peopel about hd's and want to check what mine is so I can google it, that's why I'd like to take it out without rebooting, if possible
2009-08-14T04:40:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	from your output, looks like you'd just have to umount the 4 items that start with /dev/sda
2009-08-14T04:41:00.000Z	emil111	nanotube	thanks for this advice, I'm gonna try it
2009-08-14T04:41:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	be careful not to get electrocuted by any live wires. :)
2009-08-14T04:41:00.000Z	emil111	nanotube	not on this one though, Ill do a similar experiment with another HD
2009-08-14T04:41:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	ok... same idea applies.
2009-08-14T04:42:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	if it is completely unmounted, then it should be fine.
2009-08-14T04:42:00.000Z	emil111	nanotube	what about the other way around? If I start my laptop without a HD inside, boot Live,  run for a while and then decide to plug in a hard drive, would that be dangerous in any way for the drive ?
2009-08-14T04:43:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	also should be ok, theoretically. but generally, mykola is right, if it can be avoided, it's better to avoid.
2009-08-14T04:47:00.000Z	nanotube	emil111	ok, good luck :) in general if it is unmounted it should be pretty safe - but if you value your drive and data, better to avoid, as mykola suggests.
2009-08-14T04:47:00.000Z	emil111	nanotube	thanks again.
