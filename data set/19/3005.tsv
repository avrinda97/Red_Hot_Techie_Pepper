2009-12-27T02:06:00.000Z	rvalles		any way to disable network manager for good?
2009-12-27T02:06:00.000Z	rvalles		family member's wireless network just broke, again
2009-12-27T02:06:00.000Z	rvalles		because of the damned thing
2009-12-27T02:07:00.000Z	mka	rvalles	how sure are you it's network manager?
2009-12-27T02:08:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	it's always nm
2009-12-27T02:10:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	it works... until user logs in
2009-12-27T02:10:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	and then nm applet is launched by gnome
2009-12-27T02:10:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	and everything f-s over
2009-12-27T02:11:00.000Z	mka	rvalles	how sure that nm is the one breaking your wireless?
2009-12-27T02:11:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	100%
2009-12-27T02:12:00.000Z	mka	rvalles	then what if you uninstall it?
2009-12-27T02:12:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	...
2009-12-27T02:12:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	ubuntu depends on it in many ways than one

2009-12-27T02:13:00.000Z	rvalles	mka	it's a major pita... it happens once in a while, and does happen now that they've upgraded their ubuntu to current
