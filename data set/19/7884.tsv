2007-06-08T14:34:00.000Z	beardbar	r00tintheb0x	Via Tech, Sg3 something or other, Crhome9. so i was looking on the forums and found a post that said to: sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg-video-unichrome
2007-06-08T14:34:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	do you know the model # of your mobo?
2007-06-08T14:37:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	the problem i believe is the driver section for display in your xorg.conf file.
2007-06-08T14:45:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	look for a section that has information about your video card.
2007-06-08T14:47:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	you got it?
2007-06-08T14:52:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	howabout that paste.
2007-06-08T14:56:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change "vesa" to "i810"
2007-06-08T15:06:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	you have i810 as your driver?
2007-06-08T15:07:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	beardbar	i  need to know what the errors say
