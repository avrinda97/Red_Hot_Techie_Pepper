2008-12-24T03:21:00.000Z	hatter243		If I've got a USB external drive that Ubuntu tells me it cannot mount, is it toast?
2008-12-24T03:23:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	or you can install ntfsprogs and fix it from ubuntu
2008-12-24T03:33:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	are you plugging into a usb hub or straight into a usb port on the computer?
2008-12-24T03:34:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	two USB jacks into the computer
2008-12-24T03:34:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	hrmm... got a different usb cord to try with?
2008-12-24T03:35:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	that would require a different external enclosure. I'm not certain I have anymore of those around
2008-12-24T03:35:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	o.O oh my... i'm used to the kind where the usb cable is detachable
2008-12-24T03:36:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	do you have another system you could test it on?
2008-12-24T03:36:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	errors seem about the same in Fedora Core 3 and Windows completely fails to recognize it past "Your device is ready to use"
2008-12-24T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	what about the internal connection to the drive itself? tried reseating the cable?
2008-12-24T03:37:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	Yessir
2008-12-24T03:38:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	i have also discovered that blank portions of a wall make a good place to insert nails in order to hang the carcasses of dead hard drives on, with their top plates removed to expose the disks themselves in a shiny manner :)
2008-12-24T03:39:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	I like using them as spinner art. 7200rpms make some might pretty pictures
2008-12-24T03:39:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	haven't tried that one yet
2008-12-24T03:40:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	take off the top plate, provide power so the drives start spinning and color away with your favorite dry erase markers
2008-12-24T03:40:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	careful of your fingers though, it'll do quite a bit of damage if they get caught too close to the business end of that platter
2008-12-24T03:40:00.000Z	Gnea	hatter243	oh... i was thinking more along the lines of wearing skin and face protection while letting paint drip from a brush
2008-12-24T03:41:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	I did not even think of that
2008-12-24T03:41:00.000Z	hatter243	Gnea	brilliant! I'm going home to decorate the house
