2007-10-31T00:05:00.000Z	hExDj		would 8GB be enough for installing Ubuntu?
2007-10-31T00:06:00.000Z	hExDj		I just got a new laptop with vista and it comes with a recovery partition but its only 8gb and I don't want to start from 0
2007-10-31T00:07:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Let me guess, HP?
2007-10-31T00:08:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	yup!
2007-10-31T00:08:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	If you burn the recovery DVD's, you can nuke that partition
2007-10-31T00:08:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Also, you can resize your Vista partition from within Vista if you need more than 8gb
2007-10-31T00:08:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	I know, I don't need the crap that's in it, but I wonder if it'd be enough
2007-10-31T00:08:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	really?
2007-10-31T00:09:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Start->Computer->Manage...->Disk Management
2007-10-31T00:09:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Right click the partition, Shrink
2007-10-31T00:10:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	and that shinking gives the rest of the space to my ubuntu partition?
2007-10-31T00:15:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	& graft: will back up, thanks
2007-10-31T00:11:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Sadly, no, it just marks it as free space, so you would have to either reinstall Ubuntu deleting the existing Ubuntu partition and making a new one filling up the old and new space or create a new partition in the new space and mount it somewhere on the existing ubuntu install
2007-10-31T00:11:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	I don't have installed ubuntu yet
2007-10-31T00:12:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Perfect, if you resize the partition then nuke the recovery one after burning the recovery discs, you can set Ubuntu up to use all the space
2007-10-31T00:13:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	how do I make a new partition with the space that I fred up?
2007-10-31T00:13:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	I reccomend in the installer clicking manual, then selecting free space, creating a new 1gb partition as swap, then clicking the rest of the free space, creating a new partition of the full size (it will default to the new size) as ext3, mount point as /
2007-10-31T00:14:00.000Z	hExDj	andycr	is there any risk I might mess up my Vista partition?
2007-10-31T00:15:00.000Z	andycr	hExDj	Only if you do so yourself, barring a strange bug I've not seen in hundreds of installs
