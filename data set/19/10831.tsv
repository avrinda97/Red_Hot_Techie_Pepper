2006-06-10T06:45:00.000Z	nixuser		running a laptop with 512 ddr2 memory and sata hdd, experiencing lock ups, any known problems with dapper on this type of hardware?
2006-06-10T06:45:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	if you're on a laptop, try adding 'noapic nolapic acpi=off' to the boot options
2006-06-10T06:47:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	 you can add it to the defoptions= line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-06-10T06:47:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	then run 'sudo update-grub'
2006-06-10T06:47:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	np's, that fixes common problems with lockups/slowdown on laptops
2006-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	at the end of the defoptions= line
2006-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	well, search for defoptions then
2006-06-10T06:59:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	yes, it's a line in that file.  add 'noapic nolapic acpi=off' to the end of it, then save and run 'sudo update-grub'
2006-06-10T07:01:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	you don't need to add any lines
2006-06-10T07:02:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	defoptions= is commented already, and should remain commented.  just type the things I said at the end of it
2006-06-10T07:03:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	run 'sudo update-grub' first
2006-06-10T07:03:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	np's
2006-06-10T07:07:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	so long as acpi=off, it should be honouring it
2006-06-10T07:07:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	any improvement? :) and nps
2006-06-10T07:08:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	ah, okay
2006-06-10T07:09:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	ahh, okay - if it's a poor little laptop, maybe the fans/thermal don't like being on 24-hours? :/
2006-06-10T07:10:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	erk :/ guess you'll just have to hope, my toshiba laptop's been running for 4 years w/o trouble now
2006-06-10T07:11:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	nixuser	ahh, UK here :P factory reconditioned, probably ex-rental or ex-show
