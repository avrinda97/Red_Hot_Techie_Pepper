2009-06-03T21:00:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	you just specify the second hard drive and the install area, probably need grub on the first hd
2009-06-03T21:01:00.000Z	luke_c	djdavis75	and it won't stop me from accesing Vista, when i boot would i get the option to boot into either one?
2009-06-03T21:01:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	grub should see vista and add a entry to boot it, you will choose when u turn your computer on
2009-06-03T21:02:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	I have XP on my first HD, and Ubuntu on my second, then 3rd HD is my /home
2009-06-03T21:02:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	no, just install ubuntu
2009-06-03T21:02:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	grub is in ubuntu
2009-06-03T21:06:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	install vista first
2009-06-03T21:06:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	then install ubuntu, put grub on hd0
2009-06-03T21:07:00.000Z	luke_c	djdavis75	How would i put grub on hd0?
2009-06-03T21:08:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	check out the links above, somewhere during the install there is an advanced button or something, it asks where to install grub, it should be hd0, i think it will default to that anyway, but might check it
2009-06-03T21:12:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	if you are going to use the entire second HD for Ubuntu I would make a / /home and swap partition
2009-06-03T21:12:00.000Z	luke_c	djdavis75	im not gonna use the whole hdd
2009-06-03T21:13:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	my / is only using 13 gig
2009-06-03T21:13:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	but I have it sized to 150 gig
2009-06-03T21:15:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	I have my /home on a 160 gig drive, and I filled it up, but that depends a lot on what kind of data u have, I had lots of videos on there from my Tivo
2009-06-03T21:16:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	yes
2009-06-03T21:19:00.000Z	djdavis75	luke_c	there is a program called startup manager that lets u easily change grub colors and such, you can install it from in ubuntu, it's in the repos
