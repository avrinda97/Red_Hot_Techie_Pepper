2007-03-30T10:21:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : Is your CD listed at teh top of /etc/apt/sources.list?
2007-03-30T10:21:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : yes
2007-03-30T10:21:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2007-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	Agrajag		ok, just a moment
2007-03-30T10:23:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : there's a program called apt-cdrom that you should be able to use to add the CD to your sources.list
2007-03-30T10:24:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : try sudo apt-cdrom add -d /media/cdrom
2007-03-30T10:24:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : yes.
2007-03-30T10:24:00.000Z	Agrajag		Ind[y] : I only have a 6.06 server disc with me, but I'm certain it's there on the 6.10 desktop disc.
2007-03-30T10:25:00.000Z	Agrajag		Indlet me know what that command does, I've never added a CD to my sources that way.
2007-03-30T10:26:00.000Z	Agrajag		And he left before anyone else could tell him that.
2007-03-30T10:26:00.000Z	daedra	Agrajag	that is useless
2007-03-30T10:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	daedra	what is useless?
2007-03-30T10:26:00.000Z	daedra		Whats the point in telling someone why you can't help them?
2007-03-30T10:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	daedra	what, I did help him.
2007-03-30T10:27:00.000Z	Agrajag	daedra	I told him to use apt-cdrom add
2007-03-30T10:27:00.000Z	daedra		"coldpack: I don't know, I don't use a gui"
2007-03-30T10:27:00.000Z	Agrajag		Which should solve his problem, which is an inability to install a compiler due to a lack of internet access.
2007-03-30T10:27:00.000Z	Agrajag	daedra	coldpack is not the one who asked, Ind[y]  was.
2007-03-30T10:28:00.000Z	Agrajag	daedra	coldpack merely suggested an alternate solution.
