2007-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	hexidigital		elyon::  did you say you ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver.xorg ?
2007-01-04T10:21:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 yes, I ran that.
2007-01-04T10:21:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 As for the patience thing... I've been asking for help with this for over a week and you're only the second person to even respond ;)
2007-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 I was.  The problem isn't that the resolution is too low, its that its too high, and my mouse doesn't work right at that resolution for some reason.
2007-01-04T10:24:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 I've done that before, but I'll give it another go.
2007-01-04T10:33:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 Sorry, I'm here.  Yes, I'm on the same system.
2007-01-04T10:35:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 I appreciate it.
2007-01-04T10:35:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 I've checked all the forums, googled, etc., and can find a thousand solutions but none work for me.
2007-01-04T10:36:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 it wouldn't be such a bad thing for it to be a higher resolution, but the mouse is screwed up so I can't click any of the buttons...
2007-01-04T10:37:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 Okay, that didn't install anything - says I don't need anything.
2007-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 Yes.
2007-01-04T10:40:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 "Xsession unable to launch - restart not found
2007-01-04T10:41:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 I'm in Gnome with a terminal window open.
2007-01-04T10:42:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 How do I restart the x server?  I've rebooted my system a few times lately.
2007-01-04T10:44:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 Looks like it works now for some reason.
2007-01-04T10:45:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 AH!  You know what??  After all the changes I made that I thought didn't work... I was never told to restart X :)
2007-01-04T10:45:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 I just kept logging out and not seeing a difference.
2007-01-04T10:45:00.000Z	elyon	hexidigital	 Thanks for you help :P
