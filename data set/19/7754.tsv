2007-06-29T09:44:00.000Z	colin_clark		I have an interesting one i think; I've got an Acer laptop with built in wifi. the drivers are there, but it is disabled. The button on the front that enables it doesnt seem to work
2007-06-29T09:45:00.000Z	colin_clark		nope
2007-06-29T09:45:00.000Z	colin_clark		where can I find it?
2007-06-29T09:46:00.000Z	colin_clark		yeah bcm something
2007-06-29T09:46:00.000Z	colin_clark		where can it be obtained?
2007-06-29T09:47:00.000Z	colin_clark		okay I've downloaded it. Now I'll see if i can figure out how to install it
2007-06-29T09:48:00.000Z	colin_clark		I'm still rough on the whole installing without an exe thing
2007-06-29T09:49:00.000Z	xsist	colin_clark	use the package manager or if you use source just remember ./configure make && make install
2007-06-29T09:50:00.000Z	xsist		format
2007-06-29T09:51:00.000Z	xsist		insert the install cd is a good place to start
2007-06-29T09:53:00.000Z	colin_clark		<sepero> where do you find a package manager?
2007-06-29T10:06:00.000Z	colin_clark		I'm trying, but i cant figure out how to use the package manager to open any of the files an this acer_acpi directory i extracted
2007-06-29T10:08:00.000Z	colin_clark		the acer_acpi i downloaded so I can turn on my wifi device
2007-06-29T10:08:00.000Z	colin_clark		but when i extracted everything, it has a pretty opaque set of install instructions
2007-06-29T10:10:00.000Z	colin_clark		,tar,gz
2007-06-29T10:10:00.000Z	colin_clark	xsist	- its a .tar.gz
2007-06-29T10:10:00.000Z	colin_clark		oh. well crap
2007-06-29T10:11:00.000Z	colin_clark		just type that into a terminal while in the directory i extracted?
2007-06-29T10:13:00.000Z	colin_clark	xsist	- i will read that faq. but for now, it says bash: ./configure: no such file or directory
