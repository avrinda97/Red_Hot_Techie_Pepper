2010-02-17T02:16:00.000Z	sulle	erUSUL	 yes i know but the lines i am writing in there is not the wright ones. these ends on hardy main and i think i got jaunty.
2010-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	sulle	you should not mix repositories entries. look for a repositorie for your ubuntu version
2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	sulle	erUSUL	i have no idea where to get these from. its from a tutorial and it only says the deb-src that ends on hardy main
2010-02-17T02:18:00.000Z	sulle	erUSUL	 should i post the deb-src here?
2010-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	sulle	you can not use hardy sources in jaunty. search for a repo with the same things for jaunty
2010-02-17T02:20:00.000Z	sulle	erUSUL	u dont know how to do that or what that is :(
2010-02-17T02:20:00.000Z	sulle	erUSUL	 i mean I dont know:P
