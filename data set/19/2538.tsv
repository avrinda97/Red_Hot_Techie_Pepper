2010-11-27T16:29:00.000Z	Aeronius		just for what you need it to do
2010-11-27T16:31:00.000Z	Aeronius		If you have 256 MB, use Puppy
2010-11-27T16:31:00.000Z	Aeronius		or DSL
2010-11-27T16:32:00.000Z	Aeronius		I preferred puppy
2010-11-27T16:32:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	thanks!
2010-11-27T16:21:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	I do this, it's easy, install ubuntu, install VB OSE, The GUI is a piece of cake to use
2010-11-27T16:23:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	can't figure it out
2010-11-27T16:23:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	what can't you figure, where are you at?
2010-11-27T16:23:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	I have VBox, but can't figure out how to start WinXP (which is already installed).
2010-11-27T16:24:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	you have two choices, 1) easy, long, but probably best: install a fresh version of windows on a virtual drive
2010-11-27T16:25:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	they just told me at the #vbox channel that it's not advised to do that, http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows I guess I'll just reboot <_<
2010-11-27T16:26:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	it's a bad idea to use an existing partition
2010-11-27T16:27:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	ghosting sounds nice.
2010-11-27T16:27:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	they advised me against using an existing partition
2010-11-27T16:28:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	so you get a fresh install, you use linux primarily, so you aren't as exposed to malware
2010-11-27T16:29:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	and you use Windows in high performance mode without needing antiviruses and stuff like that clogging up your resources
2010-11-27T16:30:00.000Z	Tuplad	Aeronius	good thinking... guess I'll have to reinstall it again then ;(
2010-11-27T16:30:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	good luck, it's for the best really
2010-11-27T16:33:00.000Z	Aeronius	Tuplad	you're welcome, glad to be of service
