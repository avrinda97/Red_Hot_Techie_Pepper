2012-07-09T05:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Why are you using Ubuntu 11.10 rather than 12.04? Can you pastebin the output of "ifconfig"? (using a flash drive if needed).
2012-07-09T05:30:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	give me a sec
2012-07-09T05:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Does the same configuration work in another OS? (Also, you still haven't answered why you're using Ubuntu 11.10 rather than 12.04).
2012-07-09T05:40:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	i haven't tried it on another OS ubuntu is the only OS installed on this machine, and I tried before on 12.04 with the same problem and had the stupid idea that going back one version might improve things somehow...like i said, first computer build, first foray into ubuntu, i still have a 12.04 installer if that will make the difference
2012-07-09T05:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	It probably won't make a difference, but once things are working you'll want to be using the latest release of Ubuntu, which also happens to be a release with long term support.
2012-07-09T05:42:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	okay noted...i can upgrade once i sort everything out right?
2012-07-09T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Yes, but I would recommend saving time and simply installing 12.04 instead.
2012-07-09T05:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Since ethernet in GNU/Linux is very reliable, and almost always Just Worksâ„¢, my first guess is that your network / cable is simply not connected / configured properly (i.e. it's not a problem on Ubuntu's side of things, nor something that you can fix by changing Ubuntu's configuration).
2012-07-09T05:47:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	the ethernet cable is definitely plugged in
2012-07-09T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	What type of ethernet cable are you using to connect to your computer, and what is the other end of the cable connected to?
2012-07-09T05:48:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	I think it's a Cat 5e that up until a few days ago was running from my router to a mac mini and working fine, now its running from my router (Asus RT-n12) to the ethernet port on my motherboard
2012-07-09T05:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Crossover or straighthrough? Apple hardware had automatically switching ports before a lot of other PCs and routers got them, so a crossover cable might have worked with the mac mini while not working with the current PC (for connecting a computer to a router/switch you generally want straighthrough).
2012-07-09T05:51:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	good question, would it say it on the cable?
2012-07-09T05:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	No, I'm looking for a good guide explaining how to tell the difference but you'll need to look at the colors of the pins at both ends of the cable.
2012-07-09T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Look at the diagrams at the right on this page (the ones actually showing the plug are the easiest to use for when you yourself have to look at the ends of the plug): http://www.cablesplususa.com/rj45-utp-guide.php with a straight through cable the colors of the pins are in the same order at both ends of the cable.
2012-07-09T06:04:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	the cable i'm using is a straight-through
2012-07-09T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ctm54	Ok. Are you seeing green lights on both ports (the computer and the router)?
2012-07-09T06:07:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	my router doesn't have lights on the actual ethernet ports but the LAN LED for that port is blinking; on my machine i've got blinking red only
2012-07-09T06:16:00.000Z	Ctm54	Jordan_U	goddard - additional weirdness, when i look at my routers logs, I see that it gave a DHCP lease to the mac address of my linux box for 4 seconds and then the lease expired
