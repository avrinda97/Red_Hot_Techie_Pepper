2006-06-05T06:50:00.000Z	avis	ompaul	i have a very peculiar bug related to the removal and installation of xchat-gnome.  could i show you a pastebin.com for diagnosis ?
2006-06-05T06:51:00.000Z	ompaul	avis	show it to the world, if I read it and know it I pitch in, otherwise you have an audience of 1 not a great thing

2006-06-05T08:01:00.000Z	avis	ompaul	could you please tell me what apt-get install bum does to a gdm session does it help configure grub ?
2006-06-05T08:02:00.000Z	ompaul	avis	bum is boot up manager - is can be used in the GUI to turn off the gui - it does nothing to grub
