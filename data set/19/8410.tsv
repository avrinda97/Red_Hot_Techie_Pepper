2007-04-18T11:06:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	vncserver does start when you use the command line, though?
2007-04-18T11:12:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	it could have a command line arg to pull in a different environment, like having a different .xinitrc
2007-04-18T11:15:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	any ideas what that command line might be? If it as Nubbie says and it is the same program, starting it from gui works just fine but starting it from cmd line doesn't work at all
2007-04-18T11:16:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	what do you get when you try to connect from the other machine?
2007-04-18T11:17:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	failed to connect
2007-04-18T11:19:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	it could be on a different display. if you don't have X started already, it could be on <serverip>:0 instead of <serverip>:1, if you do it remotely
2007-04-18T11:20:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	no session works if I start the server via cmd line, neither ip:0 or ip:1 or whatever I start it on, however starting it from gui works fine everytime
2007-04-18T11:28:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	try a netstat -an when you have vnc started from the console
2007-04-18T11:29:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	should I see 127.0.0.1:5900?
2007-04-18T11:31:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	what is ubuntu pastebin?
2007-04-18T11:32:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16196/
2007-04-18T11:34:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	what do you mean?
2007-04-18T11:35:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	my problem, trying to upgrade my laptop. it was a chicken-and-egg issue where it needed to remove an x file and the upgrade program was an x application, but it does console ui too.
2007-04-18T11:36:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	ohh, thought you were referring to my netstat output
2007-04-18T11:38:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	when you start vncserver, what syntax are you using
2007-04-18T11:39:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	you should have a line with -interface <ip address of interface> or perhaps even -interface 0.0.0.0 will work
2007-04-18T11:43:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	when I start it from console, I do a vncserver :1
2007-04-18T11:43:00.000Z	r4v5	squiggie	so then vncserver -interface 0.0.0.0 :1 or something like that should work
2007-04-18T11:45:00.000Z	squiggie	r4v5	the session started, however it still won't let me connect
