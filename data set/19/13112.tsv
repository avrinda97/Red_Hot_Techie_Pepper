2005-05-21T08:16:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- plan B - hit escape, then selelect (rescue mode) but don't hit enter, hit E for edit
2005-05-21T08:17:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- and give me a sec to figure out exactly what to do next...
2005-05-21T08:17:00.000Z	cappe	CarlK	ok, cool :)
2005-05-21T08:27:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- almost there....
2005-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	cappe	CarlK	k:)
2005-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- select the kernel line, hit E again, a the end of the line, add (space) init=/bin/bash
2005-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- then enter, then B for boot
2005-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- I am able to run passwd, but it gives me errors... I think something is missing
2005-05-21T08:33:00.000Z	CarlK	cappe	- / is mounted rw, but touch x says "Read Only File system"
