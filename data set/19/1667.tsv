2011-05-12T05:16:00.000Z	FreezingCold		Sorry to be annoying and ask again, but how well does Ubuntu run on ARM?
2011-05-12T05:18:00.000Z	FreezingCold		So I'd be picking the specs
2011-05-12T05:19:00.000Z	FreezingCold		lol
2011-05-12T05:19:00.000Z	FreezingCold		Linux is great, but beating Windows is going to take awhile
2011-05-12T05:19:00.000Z	FreezingCold		Nope
2011-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	FreezingCold		I mean by market share
2011-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	your wrong, the majority of people want a browser, office, that's it. For the majority of people Ubuntu is better for 2 reasons, 1 it's faster at achieving those goals, 2 it's virus free.
2011-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	FreezingCold	Azelphur	You're totally right, but people are still not changing over
2011-05-12T05:21:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	yea, they don't need to, just like the netbook replaced the laptop, the phone will replace the netbook.
2011-05-12T05:22:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	no they arn't, Ubuntu is free? o.O
2011-05-12T05:22:00.000Z	FreezingCold	Azelphur	If you're going to sell a device with Ubuntu pre-installed, you gotta pay
2011-05-12T05:22:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	incorrect. If your going to sell a device, modify Ubuntu, and then still use the Ubuntu brand name, you have to pay.
2011-05-12T05:23:00.000Z	FreezingCold	Azelphur	really?  I thought Dell had to pay for Ubuntu...
2011-05-12T05:23:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	if you sell a device with unmodified  Ubuntu installed, there are no licensing fees.
2011-05-12T05:23:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	yes, that's because they heavily modify it.
2011-05-12T05:23:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	if they just used a Ubuntu OEM install there would be no licensing fee required
2011-05-12T05:24:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	they wanted to use their own repositories and ship with preinstalled uglyness like flash player
2011-05-12T05:25:00.000Z	FreezingCold	Azelphur	Why don't they name it CrapDellu?
2011-05-12T05:25:00.000Z	Azelphur	FreezingCold	because they wanted it to be Ubuntu so people would buy it xD
