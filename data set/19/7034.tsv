2008-08-24T23:20:00.000Z	Doonz		hey guys, im having trouble installing Ubuntu 8.04.1. What is happening is i have a raid card with pm support. I have 5 hard drives connected to one of the 4 esata ports. I have 1 hard drive running of the ide channel on the motherbord wich i want to be the OS drive. Now i can do the install onto the IDE drive. But when i goto reboot it comes up with an error saying to insert bootable media. any ideas?
2008-08-24T23:22:00.000Z	TwoD	Doonz	have you set your bios to boot from the correct disk? If it doesn't it won't find the Master Boot Record and proceed to loading GRUB.
2008-08-24T23:22:00.000Z	Doonz	TwoD	yes it is set to the proper IDE hard disk
2008-08-24T23:23:00.000Z	TwoD	Doonz	do you use the whole IDE disk for Ubuntu? And is it set as the Master?
2008-08-24T23:23:00.000Z	Doonz	TwoD	AWWWE CRAP
2008-08-24T23:23:00.000Z	TwoD	Doonz	?
2008-08-24T23:24:00.000Z	Doonz		i got so used to SATA that i forgot to check to see what the ide drive was set to
2008-08-24T23:24:00.000Z	Doonz		i beleive its set as slave
2008-08-24T23:24:00.000Z	Doonz		would that cause it not to boot?
2008-08-24T23:24:00.000Z	TwoD	Doonz	that might be a problem, if it's on the master position at the end of the cable, but set as slave, but I'm not sure.
2008-08-24T23:24:00.000Z	Doonz		hmm
2008-08-24T23:25:00.000Z	Doonz		brb
2008-08-24T23:27:00.000Z	Doonz		Damn
2008-08-24T23:27:00.000Z	Doonz	TwoD	it was all set as the master already. and i tried with it being the only device on the ide cable and still same error
2008-08-24T23:30:00.000Z	TwoD	Doonz	hmm... tried disconnecting the other drives as well and recheck the bios settings, just to be super sure it's the only disk being searched for an MBR?
2008-08-24T23:30:00.000Z	Doonz		yeah that was one of the first things it trie
2008-08-24T23:30:00.000Z	Doonz		tried*
2008-08-24T23:32:00.000Z	TwoD	Doonz	I just remembered I had a problem with an earlier version of Ubuntu which might be related. I have 1 IDE and 4 SATA drives. I installed Ubuntu to the 1st SATA drive, which also had Windows, but the MBR was written to the IDE disk, causing it to not be found at boot. If I set it to boot from the IDE, boot would fail as there wasn't actually any OS on that disk. Had to reinstall GRUB/Ubuntu with only the SATA disk and put the others back in later.
2008-08-24T23:32:00.000Z	Doonz	TwoD	ok ill give that a go
