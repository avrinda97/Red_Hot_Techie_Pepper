2011-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	Maybe you are referring to sourcing a file, like a script. example:  . /path/to/script
2011-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	You could also do, "source /path/to/script" and it would accomplish the same.
2011-05-04T11:03:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	would that make it run in the same process as the shell itself, rather than a sub process?
2011-05-04T11:03:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	and i thought i would work on the commands too. is it that it only works on scripts? like ". ./script"
2011-05-04T11:03:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	I think so, yes.
2011-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	No.  It's equivalent to sourcing.  You can't source a binary in that way.
2011-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	ok. i know this might be a stupid question to ask. but why not
2011-05-04T11:06:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	Because it doesn't make sense!
2011-05-04T11:06:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	I'm not sure why you want to attempt to source a binary file.
2011-05-04T11:06:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	lol. clearly i need to read more and figure out what sourcing is. but thanks.
2011-05-04T11:07:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	Think of it like a method of importing the code in some other file, into the currently executing script.
2011-05-04T11:07:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	It's commonly done in other scripting languages like perl, php, etc.
2011-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	aah! ok. now it makes sense.
2011-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	so its like sharing the environment.
2011-05-04T11:09:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	thus sharing scope. Am I right?
2011-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	Sort of, yes. Think of multiple scripts utilizing a common data source or library.  Sourcing is perfect for that.
2011-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	pindropper	rob_p	got it. thanks for clearing that up.
2011-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	But yes, it's also commonly used to source a common environment file.
2011-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	rob_p	pindropper	welcome :)
