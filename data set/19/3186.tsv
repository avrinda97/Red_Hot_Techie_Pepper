2009-10-07T13:25:00.000Z	lerster		why does Jaunty suck?
2009-10-07T13:26:00.000Z	lerster		b/c it doesn't run QUake1 =)
2009-10-07T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	try quake live :)
2009-10-07T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	have you installed video drivers?
2009-10-07T13:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	quakelive uses quake1 gfx afaik
2009-10-07T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	you havent said why it is bad, you havent said what it does / doesnt do or why you are having issue
2009-10-07T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	all we know is "it doesnt work" which is pointless
2009-10-07T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	have you logged bugs?
2009-10-07T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	can you tab complete my name at the start of text so I get highlights
2009-10-07T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	my text to you being highlighted is not an accident
2009-10-07T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	if you log a bug it may get addressed

2009-10-07T13:51:00.000Z	lerster	ActionParsnip1	 i pasted the wrong url it starts at page 3
2009-10-07T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	lerster	are bugs logged?
2009-10-07T13:54:00.000Z	lerster	ActionParsnip1	 it posts the recompilation on jaunty upgraded from 8.10 for the glproquake client that ran fine on 8.10 ubuntu release and on page 4 shows the starting info that the terminal provides for why it doesn't load... as it ran on 8.10 ubunto i feel it should run on jaunty but it does not, prior to recompile or after recompile it gives that same loading error (which is that of the game loading in console yet.. not loading).
2009-10-07T13:55:00.000Z	lerster	ActionParsnip1	 so i don't know if its a graphic issue, i don't know what jaunty removed but it removed a lot when i upgraded from 8.10 said something about 30-50 removals of unrelevant softwares...
2009-10-07T13:55:00.000Z	lerster	ActionParsnip1	 sadly i did not keep a record aside from quake1 not working anymore after the upgrade from ubuntu 8.10 to jaunty... everything worked fine....
2009-10-07T13:55:00.000Z	lerster	ActionParsnip1	 but that did upset me that quake 1 no longer ran.
