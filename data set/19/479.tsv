2012-02-02T06:13:00.000Z	barakisbrown		If my live usb is 11.04 and my installed linux is 11.10, will that be a problem?
2012-02-02T06:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	its fine, as long as the distro has the chroot command, any linux distro is fine :)

2012-02-02T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	you can reinstall grub to the MBR using a chroot from the liveCD
2012-02-02T06:05:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	Is there a gui that can do this without me typing all the commands at the video you linked?
2012-02-02T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	not that I know of. It's not hard, it's like 4 commands....
2012-02-02T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	windows can reinstate its own bootloader too using CD, it has no gui either
2012-02-02T06:07:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	I like the bootscreen that Grub2 had prevoius..
2012-02-02T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	the commands will reinstate the loader to the MBR, the config is untouched
2012-02-02T06:08:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	the commands in the video?
2012-02-02T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	yes, it will put the bootloader on the MBR then reread the config which is untouched :)
2012-02-02T06:11:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	thanks.
2012-02-07T06:52:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	how do I setup my linux machine so that I can connect from my window machine via rdp?
2012-02-07T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	what are you connecting to the ubuntu desktop to achieve?
2012-02-07T06:55:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	So I do not have to walk into the other room to use it?? I want to access from my window machine which is in another room??
2012-02-07T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	yes but what would yuo walk through to do?
2012-02-07T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	what is the purpose of connecting
2012-02-07T06:57:00.000Z	barakisbrown	ActionParsnip	to learn about linux and abiltiy to use another os without using a VM or dualbooting..:)
2012-02-07T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barakisbrown	I guess, could use SSH and CLI or X forwarding ;)
