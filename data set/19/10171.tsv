2006-07-19T11:33:00.000Z	Pandora82		hi
2006-07-19T11:34:00.000Z	Pandora82		I have terrible problems with playing DVDs... well, I can't watch DVDs on my ubuntu (got all codecs)
2006-07-19T11:35:00.000Z	Pandora82		I can't evenmount them
2006-07-19T11:35:00.000Z	Pandora82		original DVDs from the shop, it's .vob or something? movies
2006-07-19T11:37:00.000Z	Pandora82		Alex but it must be possible to watch ordinary DVDs (rent or bought) on ubuntu...
2006-07-19T11:37:00.000Z	Pandora82		alex no way. I bought them and only want to watch em
2006-07-19T11:39:00.000Z	Pandora82		Alex the prob is: since I can't mount the DVD, it seems to be impossible to open them with any player
2006-07-19T11:40:00.000Z	Pandora82		ok... nice that somebody tells me... ;-) so how do I open them with e.g. VLC
2006-07-19T11:41:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 do you have libdvdcss2 and libdvdread ?
2006-07-19T11:41:00.000Z	Pandora82	sponix	yes
2006-07-19T11:41:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 ok, what exactly was your issue, again /
2006-07-19T11:42:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 oh, well a DVD should mount, no matter what, even if you can't play the movie files off of it
2006-07-19T11:43:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 to watch with mplayer, its normally mplayer dvd://1 or for vlc you can go to open disc and tell it dvd://1 (if title1 is the movie)
2006-07-19T11:43:00.000Z	Pandora82	sponix	that doesn't work
2006-07-19T11:43:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 some players (kaffeine) are smart enough to just play the movie by finding the main title though
2006-07-19T11:44:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 any errors ?
2006-07-19T11:44:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 mplayer -v -d /dev/dvd might show the layout of the dvd, and you can play guess and test on what title you need to play etc
2006-07-19T11:49:00.000Z	sponix	Pandora82	 have you tried just mount /dev/dvd /mnt to see if you can browse the files on it ?
2006-07-19T11:50:00.000Z	Pandora82	sponix	it says: mount: you must specify the filesystem type
