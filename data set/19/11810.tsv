2005-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	McJerry		how can i restart networking after dist-upgrade?
2005-12-15T09:26:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	/etc/init.d/networking restart
2005-12-15T09:27:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	didn't help ifup: interface lo already configured
2005-12-15T09:29:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	lo is for loopback...you shouldn't need to restart that but if you want try ifdown lo
2005-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	ping localhost work, ping yahoo.com fail......restart networking ok, but dhcp noy getting address assigned i think...??
2005-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	hrmm...not sure i just restart the pc after a dist-upgrade to be safe....another suggestion is to restart networking once more after bringing down eth0 or whatever your network interface is
2005-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	did restart pc after upgrade how restart eth0?
2005-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	i usually do ifdown eth0 then /etc/init.d/networking restart
2005-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	but it sounds like you may have a problem with your networking setup....verify your settings and such..should be easy if you have gnome installed
2005-12-15T09:36:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	ifdown eth0 Module eth0 not found
2005-12-15T09:36:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	do you have a wireless card or wired ethernet?
2005-12-15T09:38:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	run ifconfig and see how many interfaces you have listed
2005-12-15T09:38:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	lspci shows nvidia ethernet controller, ifconfig shows loopback only
2005-12-15T09:39:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	dmesg | grep eth
2005-12-15T09:41:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	eth0:  forcedeth.c: subsystem: 01462:0300: bound to 0000:00:05.0
2005-12-15T09:43:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	check your /etc/networking/interfaces file or try configuring eth0 via gnome panel
2005-12-15T09:44:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	ah yes, remember now had to activate eth0 in gnome panel last time did upgrade
2005-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	McJerry	optish	thank you, am up now
2005-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	optish	McJerry	np :)
