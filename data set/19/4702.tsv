2010-02-16T00:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	neither
2010-02-23T05:13:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	/join #fedora - this is an ubuntu support channel
2010-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	what cpu do you have
2010-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	grep name /proc/cpuinfo | head -n 1
2010-03-14T06:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	run it in a terminal, not here
2010-03-14T06:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	that should be good enough to play flash, are you trying fullscreen or anything?
2010-03-14T06:58:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	i can watch youtube (not hd) on a 900mhz celeron m so it must be  something else
2010-03-14T07:01:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	check if anything else is eating your cpu cycles
2010-03-14T07:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	my last guess is your  gpu, which do you have?
2010-03-14T07:05:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	lspci
2010-03-14T07:06:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	ati has horrible linux support, that could be the  problem
2010-03-14T07:52:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	/join #freebsd
2010-03-14T07:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	karan	please take this to the offtopic channel
