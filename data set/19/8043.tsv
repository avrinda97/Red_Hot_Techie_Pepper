2007-05-14T07:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arro	is that to make a wireless device work, just curious?
2007-05-14T07:20:00.000Z	arro	IndyGunFreak	yeah,

2007-05-14T07:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arro	from the looks of it, the bcm driver you need is on the install CD, do you still have it?
2007-05-14T07:24:00.000Z	arro	IndyGunFreak	yes, but when I put the install cd into my notebook, the "cd inserted appears to have programs on it, run synaptic?" doesn't appear any more
2007-05-14T07:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arro	open synaptic, search for the bcm driver you need, highlight and start to install it.
2007-05-14T07:26:00.000Z	arro	IndyGunFreak	it can't find it
2007-05-14T07:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arro	open synaptic, click Settings/repos/third party tab.. ake sure the two CD ROm boxes are checked.
2007-05-14T07:28:00.000Z	arro	IndyGunFreak	ah ha

2007-05-14T07:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arro	but did the driver install, or are you still requiring a connection?
2007-05-14T07:34:00.000Z	arro	IndyGunFreak	still trying to get the driver off of the cd
2007-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	arro	IndyGunFreak	I'm just going to go play some wesnoth, maybe it'll fix itself :(
