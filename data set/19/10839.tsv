2006-06-11T15:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		does anyone know how I can change my locale on 6.06 ?  it is set to Tagalog and I want to set the default to English/Canadian
2006-06-11T15:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		or English/GB or something
2006-06-11T15:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		the things I googled up only showed me how to change the timezone
2006-06-11T15:28:00.000Z	frying_fish	Samus_Aran	in system->preferences->language support
2006-06-11T15:31:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	I am using icewm at the moment, what is the name of the command that that menu entry would launch ?

2006-06-11T15:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	thanks for the help, that gnome one said it has reset everything .. will just wait and see now if it worked.  it had pages of errors on the console about file not found, after it downloaded a package
2006-06-11T15:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	but it now shows English as default in the selector
2006-06-11T15:37:00.000Z	frying_fish	Samus_Aran	well thats useful then.
2006-06-11T15:42:00.000Z	frying_fish	Samus_Aran	yeah, its the same, it doesn't make a huge difference.
2006-06-12T11:59:00.000Z	frying_fish	Samus_Aran	mplayer can only play the stuff once you have codecs for it
2006-06-12T12:00:00.000Z	frying_fish	Samus_Aran	maybe, but they don't use patented codecs
2006-06-12T12:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	that isn't actually true.  there are tons of codecs out there which are used widely, even though it is not actually legal to do so.  and then there are all the codecs which *are* currently allowed, but are patented and they can change their licensing at any time (as UniSys did with its LZW compression used in GIF files)
2006-06-12T12:03:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	VLC would be able to play almost nothing if it used no patented codecs
2006-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	does VLC play MP3 streams (in just about every XviD/DivX file out there) ?  AAC/AVC ?  MPEG-4 ?  etc.  if it plays any of them, it is using patented formats
2006-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	MPlayer can use nearly every codec in existence
2006-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	proprietary or otherwise
2006-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	frying_fish	they have full support for codecs like Snow and Ogg/Theora
2006-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	frying_fish	Samus_Aran	only in US i think.
