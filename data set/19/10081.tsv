2008-01-09T11:38:00.000Z	Onyx		every time i start a gtk app from terminal, i get this error... Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "aurora", --anyone know how to fix that?
2008-01-09T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	try a different theme
2008-01-09T11:38:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	To see if the error replicates?  I like the theme I'm using...
2008-01-09T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	sounds like the theme wants a particular engine, I see it at http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438 . It's not in ubuntu and I'm not familiar with it. You could compile it ...
2008-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	Yeah, I've got that -- compiled it, which is how it got on my system...
2008-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	so it seems to be saying it can't find it
2008-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	where did you install it to?
2008-01-14T10:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	I don't have kde installed, but locate kio-whatever , then dpkg -S /path/to/whatever will tell you the package
2008-01-14T10:12:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	I wanted to get rid of the package, but it was required for amarok, which I cannot live without :)
2008-01-14T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	heh. Kde is what it is, I guess
2008-01-14T10:12:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	Yeah, KDE is crap IMO but there's a couple of K apps that are definitely nice.
2008-01-17T07:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	or you both can join #onyx , it's faster than registration
2008-01-17T07:30:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	good cal
2008-01-19T22:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	if you used the ones from their sites, yes
2008-01-19T22:31:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	Cool, thanks :) -- just caught me off guard for a sec.
2008-01-19T22:31:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	I'm using the ones from the nvidia site because I've got a custom kernel, so I figured that had something to do with it
2008-01-19T22:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	I've got to do that myself for the new kernel upgrade, but I decided to wait a couple weeks with the xorg fiasco
2008-01-19T22:32:00.000Z	Onyx	nickrud	Ahh, it wasn't too bad with xorg -- it just kept repeatedly crashing... i just had to stop gdm, wget the drivers, and install them again.
2008-01-19T22:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Onyx	yeah, I helped someone do that last night. I'm lazy, so I'll just procrastinate a little more :)
