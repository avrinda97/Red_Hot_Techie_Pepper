2009-10-13T12:33:00.000Z	Screwyluie		I wonder if someone could help me out, total linux noob, fair warning
2009-10-13T12:34:00.000Z	Screwyluie		I tried installing ubuntu, it boots, I see the loading screen, but after the loading screen the screen goes black... after about 5 mins or so the computer shutsdown... any idea?
2009-10-13T12:35:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	can you boot into the recovery system and see the o/p of dmesg | tail
2009-10-13T12:35:00.000Z	Screwyluie		I don't know what that means, I can get teh menu, and although I haven't tried it does have the option to drop to the shell, I would assume it works
2009-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	yes,drop to the shell and run : dmesg | tail : and look out for errors
2009-10-13T12:37:00.000Z	Screwyluie		shadesleyer: I will do that and then comback, is there something in particular I'm looking for? just errors? I'll see what I can find
2009-10-13T12:38:00.000Z	Screwyluie		actionparsnip: I used Wubi to install, it does an md5 check if I read right
2009-10-13T12:38:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	thats a wubi install?
2009-10-13T12:39:00.000Z	Screwyluie		yes it is
2009-10-13T12:39:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	then there could be a more sinister problem...
2009-10-13T12:40:00.000Z	Screwyluie		the wubi.exe doesn't come with an md5 hash, nor do I think an exe would run at all if it were missing bits
2009-10-13T12:40:00.000Z	Screwyluie	shadeslayer	any ideas?
2009-10-13T12:40:00.000Z	Screwyluie		or should I do what you said first
2009-10-13T12:41:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
2009-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	Screwyluie	shadeslayer	i read through that before installing and did what it said to do, although the install is pretty straight forward, I don't know that I could've gotten anything wrong... is there something in particular you're thinking?
2009-10-13T12:44:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	some h/w is not supported
2009-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	Screwyluie	shadeslayer	yeah I'm aware of linux's hardware limitations.... I think all my stuff is ok, I checked what I could searching around on google and what not... I'll go check for errors see what I come up with
2009-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	ok,but we can never be sure of whats causing this
2009-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Screwyluie	ive gtg as of now.... cya later
