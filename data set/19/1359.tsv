2011-02-16T14:37:00.000Z	Blorg28		Is there a way to tell ubuntu to mount my usb drive to a fixed folder ?
2011-02-16T14:37:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	udev rules
2011-02-16T14:40:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	no other way ?
2011-02-16T14:40:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	don't know that's the low level way  :)
2011-02-16T14:41:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	yeah I know but it would be easier for me to tell the person to click here and here and choose a folder, than edit an undev rules (find the hdd serial with lsusb etc lol) :) thanks anyway
2011-02-16T14:43:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	don't know then.. would be useful as you said
2011-02-16T14:43:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	for what I know the disk is always mounted in /media/"partitio label" right?
2011-02-16T14:44:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	I think so
2011-02-16T14:44:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	the thing is : I need the person to plug the drive, and then I want it to click on a bash script I made that will rsync his home
2011-02-16T14:45:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	problem is : if the drive is not mounted in the same directory each time, it will fail
2011-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	I see
2011-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	you could make some tests looking at the mount output command..
2011-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	right. I have to find a way to list the mounted device, find the serial, and rsync on it
2011-02-16T14:50:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	if the disk is always the same you can check the UUID
2011-02-16T14:51:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	yes the disk is the same. What's the UUID ? how can I get it ? fdisk ?
2011-02-16T14:51:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	the UUID is the partitio id which is always the same..
2011-02-16T14:52:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	ok. I'll take a look at it, thx
2011-02-16T14:54:00.000Z	lucagiove	Blorg28	just google uuid
2011-02-16T14:55:00.000Z	Blorg28	lucagiove	yep already done, thank you
