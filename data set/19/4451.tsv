2009-01-11T07:41:00.000Z	VideoSmith		Guys I've got a bit of a problem that I tried to have answered before but didn't get too much of an answer.  I am working on downloading this program.  I got a .tar.gz file and when I extracted, it gave me a folder.  Where do I go from here?
2009-01-11T07:42:00.000Z	VideoSmith		Alright.
2009-01-11T07:42:00.000Z	kelbizzle	VideoSmith	or look for and install.txt inside the folder
2009-01-11T07:42:00.000Z	VideoSmith	kelbizzle	 Ah I've got something there.
2009-01-11T07:42:00.000Z	kelbizzle	VideoSmith	or a readme.txt
2009-01-11T07:43:00.000Z	VideoSmith	kelbizzle	 it gave me this:  cmake . (If you want to install in a different path, use instead: cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path) make  To install, become root:  sudo make install (enter root password at prompt)
2009-01-11T07:44:00.000Z	kelbizzle	VideoSmith	ok just type in a terminal window cd /home/kelbizzle/path-to-folder
2009-01-11T07:44:00.000Z	kelbizzle	VideoSmith	then type sudo make then sudo make install
