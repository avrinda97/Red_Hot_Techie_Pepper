2012-09-13T05:41:00.000Z	codemonkey	aristidesfl	still checking http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Faq
2012-09-13T05:45:00.000Z	codemonkey	aristidesfl	perhaps this will help. https://bhsingh.googlecode.com/svn-history/r444/trunk/bin/squeeze
2012-09-13T05:46:00.000Z	aristidesfl	codemonkey	how so?
2012-09-13T05:47:00.000Z	codemonkey	aristidesfl	have you been playing with this block in the config?

2012-09-13T05:50:00.000Z	codemonkey	aristidesfl	perhaps I dont understand your question, what is it you are trying to do?

2012-09-13T06:19:00.000Z	codemonkey	aristidesfl	does it happen to all torrents or just magnet links?
2012-09-13T06:19:00.000Z	aristidesfl	codemonkey	never tried with magnets
2012-09-13T06:20:00.000Z	aristidesfl	codemonkey	it happens with .torrents files
2012-09-13T06:20:00.000Z	aristidesfl	codemonkey	which have non-ascii characters
2012-09-13T06:20:00.000Z	aristidesfl	codemonkey	my env http://paste.ubuntu.com/1201728/
2012-09-13T06:21:00.000Z	codemonkey	aristidesfl	try just using magnet links. make sure you are connecting to the trackers via a ssh socks proxy like https://www.torproject.org/ and for the love of pete, (or wendy) use magnet links. .torrent files are a sure bet to get you put on a list, then just wait for tpp
2012-09-13T06:22:00.000Z	aristidesfl	codemonkey	thanks for the advise, but that doesn't solve my problem
