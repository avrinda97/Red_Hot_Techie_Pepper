2007-09-09T15:04:00.000Z	sasa		hello. Can anyone tell me how can I expand ntfs partitions using gparted off of live cd?
2007-09-09T15:05:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 just unmout it ,  then select the  resize /move from the right click menu ,  but you can only resize to the "right"   if the free space is on the left you need to move it first
2007-09-09T15:06:00.000Z	sasa	Pelo	that is exactly my predicament: there is no space to drag to the right. I do have over 7 gigs of unallocated space. How can I move it so I can expand my nfgs partition?
2007-09-09T15:06:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	take a screenshot of the gparted windows and uplaod it to imageshack so I can have a look

2007-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 hold on
2007-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 thank you
2007-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 which partition do you want to extend ?
2007-09-09T15:15:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 I'm not sure you can expand a  ntfs aprtition with gparted ( because gparted does not support formating ntfs' I know you don't want to format it but I think part of the expanding process might involve formating the new part) ,
2007-09-09T15:17:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 in any case ,  this would be the sequence of step you would have to do , 1st , resize the ext3 partition to add an extra 3.6 gig on it , 2nd,  move the ext3 partiton to the end of the hdd ( in the dialog lave the same totatl space and select 0 space after , or whatever it is ) ,  what is left of the free space will be between the ntfs and ext3 partiton,  then you resize the ntfs partition
2007-09-09T15:17:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 just one quesiton ? what happened to your /swap ?
2007-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 you can't do that
2007-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	hold on ,  try lame
2007-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	sasa	Pelo	what do you mean?
2007-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 nevemind my firs tcommand install lame,
2007-10-05T08:29:00.000Z	Pelo	sasa	 try google for those files descritpions,  get a deb if they have it or the source if they don'T
2007-10-05T08:30:00.000Z	sasa	Pelo	thank you...darn it, I can't remember the package name, I would know it if I saw it
2007-10-05T08:35:00.000Z	sasa	Pelo	what was the "lame" package you mentioned....could that be what I'm missing?
