2011-01-25T11:43:00.000Z	asfjio		hello, guys! i istalled xubuntu-desktop and now i want to remove it. is just "sudo apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop" enough?
2011-01-25T11:44:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	no....
2011-01-25T11:44:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	its just a metapackage...you have to remove all packages that came with it!
2011-01-25T11:45:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	how to do it?
2011-01-25T11:45:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	its more complicated than it sounds!..
2011-01-25T11:47:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	isn't there some dependencies rules to catch all the packages and don't hurt gnome?
2011-01-25T11:48:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	you have to pin-point the part in the logs where you started the xfce install...you have synaptic?
2011-01-25T11:49:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	"Synaptic Package Manager", yes i do.
2011-01-25T11:50:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	ok..then in synaptic theres a history section...use that to find all packages that were installed along with  xubuntu-desktop
2011-01-25T11:51:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	[http://www.linuxine.com/2008/07/howto-install-remove-gnome-kdexfc-in-ubuntu.html] they said "sudo apt-get autoremove xubuntu-desktop xfce" is it wrong?
2011-01-25T11:53:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	the way i suggested will ensure you removed all packages...that will be in history all under one timestamp
2011-01-25T11:58:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	http://pastebin.com/xNeF9tDS is that i'm looking for? its actually 5 lines and the "Install:" section is probably i want to remove every single package, right?
2011-01-25T11:59:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	looks like it....but also confirm in synaptic
2011-01-25T11:59:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	it seems that the history in synaptic is empty.
2011-01-25T12:00:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	looks like this was a command line before?
2011-01-25T12:00:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	actually yes, sorry if i mislead you.
2011-01-25T12:01:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	and yeah..if you installed via command line...synaptic wont have the history..my bad
2011-01-25T12:02:00.000Z	asfjio	bonjoyee	okay thank you for your time! i hope don't broke something.
2011-01-25T12:02:00.000Z	bonjoyee	asfjio	i honestly feel a reinstall will be the best/fastest way to get rid of the DE,,,if thats feasible!
