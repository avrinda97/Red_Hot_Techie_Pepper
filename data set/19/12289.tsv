2006-01-13T14:54:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	that's assuming you have an old dos boot disk with dos fdisk on it...
2006-01-13T14:54:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	every dos bootdisk has fdisk
2006-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	right... which is why i said assuming you have a dos boot disk... most people don't these days... especially if they got a computer that came with XP
2006-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	i'm assuming that guy has one, because he mentioned it
2006-01-13T14:56:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	i don't know how people get by without floppies. boot disks, bios flashes, emergencies.. it's so handy, and they sell for less than $10, how can you afford not to?
2006-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	they are 20 year old obsolete piles of crap... I wrote a disk driver for them once and man that hardware sucks... what do you need it for when you have cds?
2006-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	i like them :D
2006-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	can you do a bios flash from cdrom?
2006-01-13T14:58:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	sure
2006-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	just burn a bootable cd using the floppy disk image
2006-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	what about on older machines that don't boot to cds?
2006-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	older than what?  6 years?  throw them away ;)
2006-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	what about.. umm.. yeah. it's frickin $10, and it comes in handy! that's more than i can say about other computer peripherals and devices.
2006-01-13T15:00:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	I'll stick with me cds ;)
2006-01-13T15:00:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	i have 2 floppy drives, no cds, i LOVE floppies
2006-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	brand new computer too
2006-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	you're crazy ;)
2006-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	kameron	psusi	kidding :P i have 1 and use it once a month or so
2006-01-13T15:02:00.000Z	psusi	kameron	of course... any actual msdos image you download is an illegal pirated copy ;)
