2007-02-23T13:10:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	, have you tried to change your hostname?
2007-02-23T13:11:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	, yes I understand that, but have you tried to change your computer name?
2007-02-23T13:11:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	, do less /etc/hostname
2007-02-23T13:12:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	, at a console, type:     less /etc/hostname
2007-02-23T13:13:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	what does it say?  I don't care if it hasn't changed, I was asking what it said :)
2007-02-23T13:14:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- ok, instead type      cat /etc/hostname
2007-02-23T13:15:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- then tell us what it says
2007-02-23T13:16:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- now we're getting somewhere!
2007-02-23T13:17:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	that's OK, your system has lost it's hostname
2007-02-23T13:18:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- I'm working on it
2007-02-23T13:20:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- ok, please type:     cat /etc/hosts and tell me what it says.  Just the top few lines
2007-02-23T13:20:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- or do what gOLdenHaW3D said!
2007-02-23T13:21:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- beware of spaces and other strange characters
2007-02-23T13:23:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	ok, do what was said above
2007-02-23T13:25:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	did you enter your password?
2007-02-23T13:27:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	- don't do that
2007-02-23T13:28:00.000Z	morrolan	prem	-I told you not to do that...
