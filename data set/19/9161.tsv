2006-12-18T11:35:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi		hello everybody, I'm new with this uBuntu and Linux thing.
2006-12-18T11:36:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi		does anyone know if Netgear WG311v2 have atheros chipset?  If so, can you guys provide me with the URL to download the driver?
2006-12-18T11:36:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	No, they don't.
2006-12-18T11:36:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	Only netgear card with a T after their model number use the atheros chipset.
2006-12-18T11:37:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	What does 'lspci | grep Network' say about it?
2006-12-18T11:38:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	No.
2006-12-18T11:38:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	I'm fairly sure that's an ACX111
2006-12-18T11:40:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	the 'acx' driver may work, provided you give it the correct firmware version.
2006-12-18T11:40:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	not windows drivers, Linux drivers.
2006-12-18T11:42:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	I found some airodump for windows.  that's why I want to run it from windows
2006-12-18T11:42:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)'
2006-12-18T11:42:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	However, I'm 99.9% sure that card is not an atheros card, so the atheros driver is useless.
2006-12-18T11:43:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	correct
2006-12-18T11:43:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	I have tried auditor collection on both card...but they can't do anything
2006-12-18T11:44:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	I ran the kismet, but very poor
2006-12-18T11:44:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	they can't detect any boxes
2006-12-18T11:44:00.000Z	cafuego	MossimO_Boi	Yeah, kismet is fairly useless on badly supported cards.
2006-12-18T11:45:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	thanks for clearing everything up...if not I'm gonna spend couple more days trying to find the driver
2006-12-18T11:45:00.000Z	MossimO_Boi	cafuego	haha lame huh?
