2009-12-07T03:50:00.000Z	Oilut		how do i activate root user?
2009-12-07T03:50:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	you should use sudo
2009-12-07T03:51:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	i need to install a program from the internet with adobe air. Isnt it better to login with root and then go back to my user?
2009-12-07T03:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	if you are unfamiliar with using root it's highly recommended that you use sudo... you can do the exact same stuff as root
2009-12-07T03:54:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	So i type sudo and then run the .air file? but it is not saved on my computer i cant type sudo blabla.air
2009-12-07T03:54:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	i'm not sure i understand correctly, where is this file and what is it?
2009-12-07T03:56:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	adobe air is a `plataform` that runs softwares on windows and linux
2009-12-07T03:56:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	the files are .air (like .exe)
2009-12-07T03:57:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	well if it's binary you would run something like "sudo ./blabla.air" but in the path your file is located
2009-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	help-me out
2009-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	just tell me how to activate the root user haha
2009-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	you are looking for sudo -i but don't come back whining when you break your computer
2009-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	haha thanks
2009-12-07T04:00:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	everything i do with the MOUSE will be ass root also>?
2009-12-07T04:01:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	no. just what is in terminal. there is a lot of workarounds and security issues to enable logging in as root
2009-12-07T04:01:00.000Z	Oilut	Out_Cold	i cant open the file with the terminal, i dont know how
2009-12-07T04:02:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	well then you should read the README or help file that usually comes with EVERY file and app you get for linux
2009-12-07T04:02:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Oilut	in terminal type exit
