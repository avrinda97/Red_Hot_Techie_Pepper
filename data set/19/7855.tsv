2009-03-03T13:29:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
2009-03-03T13:29:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	then sudo nvidia-settings and see whats up
2009-03-03T13:30:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	I see nvidia setings it gives me modes to choose from but not the one i need
2009-03-03T13:33:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	is there a line in xorg.conf i can edit.. specifically.. i need some help with it as it doesnt seem to be changing
2009-03-03T13:34:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	im using AvidAV 19 inch 4:3 monitor.
2009-03-03T13:34:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	 sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.bak && gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-03-03T13:35:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	when trying to save config for higher res from nvidia settings it says something like "failed to parse to xorg.conf"
2009-03-03T13:35:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	ok, i see my xorg.conf file in gedit.
2009-03-03T13:36:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	pastebin?
2009-03-03T13:36:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	so you need to find the screen section and modify it acordingly... admitidly this isn't my forte however its relatively simple
2009-03-03T13:36:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	find the screen, copy an existing resolution and add it in there
2009-03-03T13:38:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	dpkg -reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-03-03T13:38:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	then try again
2009-03-03T13:39:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	dpkg-reconfigure gives me options but not for gfx only keyboard
2009-03-03T13:40:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	thanks for the tips..
2009-03-03T13:40:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	I was just going to say remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-03-03T13:40:00.000Z	tyler_d	suzao	but np... gl
2009-03-03T13:41:00.000Z	suzao	tyler_d	im not sure if ubuntu would run without xorg
