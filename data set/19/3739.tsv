2011-05-20T19:48:00.000Z	rahul_		Description: Ubuntu 11.04
2011-05-20T19:48:00.000Z	rahul_		but i don't get that new interface.. the look
2011-05-20T19:49:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	log out, click your name, look at the bar on the bottom and change it to 'ubuntu'
2011-05-20T19:55:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	sure.  use imageshack.com
2011-05-20T20:00:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	log out, click your name, look at the panel at the bottom and change it to 'ubuntu'
2011-05-20T20:00:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	Then type your password and log in
2011-05-20T20:01:00.000Z	rahul_	edbian	I checked.. it's "Ubuntu"
2011-05-20T20:01:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	Try some of the other ones.  Is there one called 'unity'??
2011-05-20T20:02:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	what else?
2011-05-20T20:04:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	then do that.  Try each of the options it lists
2011-05-20T20:11:00.000Z	rahul_	edbian	i got "Recovery Console, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Classic, Ubuntu Classic(No Effects), Ubuntu(safe mode), User defined session" these many options by default it's "Ubuntu"
2011-05-20T20:12:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	'ubuntu' should be the new unity interface.  I'm thinking your computer does not support compiz and therefore falls to ubuntu without effects everytime
2011-05-20T20:14:00.000Z	rahul_	edbian	I have installed Ubuntu on VMware.. updated from 10.11 to 11.04
2011-05-20T20:14:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	Did you turn on hardware acceleration in the vm??
2011-05-20T20:19:00.000Z	rahul_	edbian	can i use APTonCD to image Ubuntu & install the same on some other PC.. will it work..?
2011-05-20T20:19:00.000Z	edbian	rahul_	ummm.... yeah?   I think you can do that
2011-05-20T20:20:00.000Z	rahul_	edbian	so on VMware i can't get the new interface of ubuntu ?
