2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	sybariten		i want it to throw 6 different options to me when it discovers duplicate files in my queue
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	sybariten		i want those options preferrably to be defined per-server
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	sybariten		i want to be able to fiddle with the secure options onto the tiniest detail
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	sybariten		i want to be able to change between active and passive at the blink of an eye, and store that per-server
2006-05-30T08:02:00.000Z	sybariten		well i think you see what i mean. i did _not_ come here without any ideas of what i'm looking for
2006-05-30T08:04:00.000Z	sybariten		what i essentially am looking for is something that comes close to flashfxp but i dont think that exists
2006-05-30T08:05:00.000Z	sybariten		if you ask me, filezilla is not very stable or advanced but i may have had exceptionally bad experiences
2006-05-30T08:06:00.000Z	sybariten		ng: i will, thanks
2006-05-30T08:08:00.000Z	sybariten		(its just that this is a very common *nix thing - you come asking if theres a tool that does this or that, maybe like the XP equivalent xyz. then instead of saying "there is no tool like that" or "we dont know a *nix tool like that", some people can just go on forever with "why would you want to do THAT? nautilus handles image viewing just perfectly, and thats all _i_ need" .... or something
2006-05-30T08:08:00.000Z	sybariten		)
2006-05-30T08:08:00.000Z	CokeNCode	sybariten	let it go
2006-05-30T08:11:00.000Z	sybariten	CokeNCode	search the forums for build-essential
2006-05-30T08:11:00.000Z	sybariten	CokeNCode	hells yeah
2006-05-30T08:12:00.000Z	sybariten	CokeNCode	didnt quite understand that last one
2006-05-30T08:17:00.000Z	sybariten	CokeNCode	if youo havent programmed antyhing at all under *nix before, it may be an idea to install the build-essential and then do some classic tool-installation, compile-stylee. In other words, just installing stuff and removing, without tinkering
2006-05-31T14:31:00.000Z	CokeNCode	sybariten	try running them remotely :)
2006-05-31T14:31:00.000Z	sybariten	CokeNCode	you mean as in getting down or up the hardon?
2006-05-31T14:32:00.000Z	CokeNCode	sybariten	up
2006-05-31T14:32:00.000Z	sybariten	CokeNCode	yeah, i agree ...  the ability to run them remotely is really one of the reasons why i like console stuff that still can have some gui-feeling (with curses)
