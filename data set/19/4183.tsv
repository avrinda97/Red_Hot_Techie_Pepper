2009-07-30T17:27:00.000Z	juxta		I'm seeing lines in my syslog for a failed modprobe of 'xen_blkfront' - how can I track down what's causing these?
2009-07-30T17:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	what lines ?
2009-07-30T17:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	are they posted anywhere (a pastebin)
2009-07-30T17:29:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	sure, just a sec
2009-07-30T17:29:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	http://pastebin.com/d36f2ca54
2009-07-30T17:30:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	that's just a grep of them for today
2009-07-30T17:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	maybe you need to be running on a xen kernel for the modules to work ? is that the case ?
2009-07-30T17:34:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	I don't have anything to do with xen... I'm just trying to work out why the module is trying to load in the first place
2009-07-30T17:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	ah ok...
2009-07-30T17:36:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	seems to trigger when some crontabs run.. but I dont see it listed anywhere in my crons
2009-07-30T17:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	every hour or so...
2009-07-30T17:37:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	pretty much, yeah
2009-07-30T17:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	/etc/cron.hourly/ empty ?
2009-07-30T17:38:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	yeah, nothing in there
2009-07-30T17:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	dpkg -l | grep xen | grep '^ii'
2009-07-30T17:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	what does this returns ?
2009-07-30T17:41:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	nothing
2009-07-30T17:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	juxta	i dunno what may be happening... you can ask in #ubuntu-server maybe there is someone there who knows
2009-07-30T17:43:00.000Z	juxta	erUSUL	no problems - thanks :)
