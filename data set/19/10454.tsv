2010-09-06T07:02:00.000Z	mcc		okay, here is a problem.
2010-09-06T07:02:00.000Z	mcc		i have a .tgz here. i would like to extract it.
2010-09-06T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	right click -> extract
2010-09-06T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	well you can uncompress in place with gunzip... not sure about untarring...
2010-09-06T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	why don't you just do it on another machine?
2010-09-06T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	or put a usb stick in it or something
2010-09-06T07:07:00.000Z	mcc	jrib	the exact thing i'm trying to do here is transfer from another machine, and i don't have physical access (it's a xen host)
2010-09-06T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	I don't understand the issue.  Why would transferring involve untarring at all?
2010-09-06T07:08:00.000Z	mcc	jrib	in order to transfer the files from machine a to machine b, i tgz'd them on machine a and then ftpd them over to machine b
2010-09-06T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	so why don't you not do it that way :P  Do you have ssh access?
2010-09-06T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	scp -r, yeah
2010-09-06T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	though even if you couldn't for some reason you could achieve what you asked with a series of pipes
2010-09-06T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	just use "scp -r" though
2010-09-06T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	basically you'd have tar output to stdout, pipe to ssh then have tar read from stdin on the server
2010-09-06T07:13:00.000Z	mcc	jrib	Yikes. Out of curiosity, what would I use to "read" ssh at the other end? This is something I've seen done with netcat but I didn't know you could do it with the ssh tools.
2010-09-06T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	something like this should work I think:  tar czvf - foo/ | ssh example.com 'tar xzvf -'
2010-09-06T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	basically you can think of ssh letting you have the pipe go to another machine, but it would work the same as if you strung together two tar commands with no ssh involved
2010-09-06T07:16:00.000Z	mcc	jrib	oh, that is interesting. thank you
2010-09-06T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	mcc	but I would use scp
