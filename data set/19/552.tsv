2012-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	Malsasa		Hello, i wanna compile a program from source in Maverick. Anybody can give me suggestion? What application I should compile?
2012-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	Malsasa		I wanna learn compiling from source.
2012-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	Malsasa		GNU Hello is a program?
2012-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	#friendly-coders
2012-05-28T06:18:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	why maverick?
2012-05-28T06:19:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	I use maverick so i can use old gnome.
2012-05-28T06:19:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	a less head-in-the-sand approach would be to try GNOME 3 with Cinnamon, or try Xfce
2012-05-28T06:19:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	i want to get old ubuntu so i can update it little by little
2012-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	you'll have trouble with that
2012-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	i don't want to use gnome 3 or cinnamon, i just want old gnome
2012-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	trouble on what?
2012-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	mmm, but that's going to open you up to a lot of trouble
2012-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	maintenance and security will become tedious
2012-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	can you give me an example of trouble?
2012-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	you want a specific package but getting it would mean upgrading things that GNOME 2 needs at old versions
2012-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	or some kind of privilege escalation exploit is discovered in old GNOME 2 code and you can't update it
2012-05-28T06:22:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	haha, i just want to learn compiling, i dont care, really dont care with security. I plan no internet connection will be connected to Maverick :D
2012-05-28T06:23:00.000Z	reisio	Malsasa	I don't see what old GNOME has to do with compiling, but whatever
2012-05-28T06:24:00.000Z	Malsasa	reisio	yes, i wanna instal Mac4Lin in Maverick.
