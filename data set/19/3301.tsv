2009-09-15T23:21:00.000Z	speedxxxcore		Hi, I'm remotly logged into a server, I need to determain if it has 2threads running or 2 real cores. How can I check this?

2009-09-15T23:22:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	I dunno
2009-09-15T23:22:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	I wonder if there is some command to check it ... inside the os
2009-09-15T23:23:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	what values in there?
2009-09-15T23:24:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> how many "processor" value do you have ?
2009-09-15T23:24:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> or try uname -a
2009-09-15T23:24:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	I got processor 0 and processor 1
2009-09-15T23:25:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> Your server is dual core
2009-09-15T23:25:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> So you have two threads
2009-09-15T23:25:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	so, is it two.. hyperthreading threads or 2 real cores?
2009-09-15T23:26:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> I don't know, it can either be hyperthreading or dual core, but i don't know
2009-09-15T23:27:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> cat /proc/cpuinfo in model name, what is it ?
2009-09-15T23:27:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> and in model name ?
2009-09-15T23:28:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	intel xeon 2.4
2009-09-15T23:28:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> You have a real dual cpre processor
2009-09-15T23:29:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> hope i resolved your problem
2009-09-15T23:29:00.000Z	speedxxxcore	lichi-san	you sure it's real dual? =)
2009-09-15T23:30:00.000Z	lichi-san	speedxxxcore	> All processors since Core 2 Duo are dual core, so, yeah, i'm sure
