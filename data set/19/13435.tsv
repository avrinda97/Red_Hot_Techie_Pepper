2005-04-02T13:02:00.000Z	justin`		anyone else drink shitloads of alkaline water daily? :)
2005-04-02T13:02:00.000Z	nis	justin`	heh.
2005-04-02T13:02:00.000Z	justin`	nis	do you?
2005-04-02T13:03:00.000Z	nis	justin`	I don't know the PH but damn water does bother me.  I let the chlorinated tap water sit a few days before drinking it.
2005-04-02T13:03:00.000Z	justin`	nis	interesting
2005-04-02T13:05:00.000Z	nis	justin`	A friend in Australia who deals with the public water supply said: "if fish can't live in the water, do not drink it."  so: raise fish and test your water with /them/. ;)
2005-04-02T13:06:00.000Z	justin`	nis	problem with that, I HATE FISH. I've started drinking alkaline water bottled elsewhere
2005-04-02T13:07:00.000Z	justin`	nis	and I have seen some pretty mucky water with 9 eye'd fish =8^)
2005-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	nis	justin`	ubuntu is basically Debian unstable.
2005-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	justin`	nis	that's what I hear
2005-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	justin`	nis	if that is true, then why use it over debian unstable? :)
2005-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	nis	justin`	I had no problem pointing /etc/apt/sources.list to ubuntu, running (U)pdate in dselect, to migrate from Debian Woody to Ubuntu warty.
2005-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	justin`	nis	wow
2005-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	nis	justin`	the basic idea is that you get security updates like you would have from security.debian.org .. but for /unstable/ which Debian does not support in this way.
2005-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	justin`	nis	I see
2005-04-02T13:15:00.000Z	nis	justin`	the last time Debian had a serious upgrade problem was (iirc) from potato -> woody, one summer.  There were two competing perl versions that did not coexist, and some apps depended on one or the other and couldn't coexist with both.  Since then Debian's done a better job of lockstepping everything; so upgrades are generally painless with zero downtime.  Ubuntu follows this trend -- the upgrade caused no downtime and no real reason to reboot either.  I
2005-04-02T13:15:00.000Z	nis	justin`	firewall up from the Debian legacy .. the whole time.
2005-04-02T13:16:00.000Z	nis	justin`	only real complaint is ubuntu 'desktop' target (dummy package) selects way too much crap such as openoffice.org.
2005-04-02T13:18:00.000Z	justin`	nis	hmmm, don't want no bloatware :)
