2007-01-25T12:01:00.000Z	SecrethX		hmm.. are there other emulators then wine?
2007-01-25T12:01:00.000Z	Bobsworth	SecrethX	Wine Is Not an Emulator
2007-01-25T12:02:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	then how is it called? :s
2007-01-25T12:02:00.000Z	Bobsworth		Wine is an implementation of the windows API on Linux
2007-01-25T12:02:00.000Z	Bobsworth		if you want an emulator you can use QEmu or vmware
2007-01-25T12:03:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	okay will try that :)
2007-01-25T12:03:00.000Z	Bobsworth		for games there is Cedega
2007-01-25T12:03:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	yes, cedega, for some reason I cant compile it via CVS
2007-01-25T12:05:00.000Z	Bobsworth	SecrethX	there is a guide for Cedega installation here: http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=749
2007-01-25T12:05:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	tried those guides found on google more then once.. it just keeps failing
2007-01-25T12:06:00.000Z	Bobsworth	SecrethX	did you install all the dependencies?
2007-01-25T12:06:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	afaik, yes
2007-01-25T12:08:00.000Z	Bobsworth	SecrethX	you need these packages: sudo apt-get install cvs build-essential bison flex-old libasound2-dev  libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6-dev libxrender-dev libttf2 libttf-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev msttcorefonts libfontconfig1-dev
2007-01-25T12:08:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	okay I will redo them
2007-01-25T12:09:00.000Z	Bobsworth	SecrethX	then run the script from http://winecvs.linux-gamers.net/WineCVS.sh
2007-01-25T12:10:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	is wget fine?
2007-01-25T12:10:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	hell.. now it works :S thanks!
2007-01-25T12:17:00.000Z	SecrethX	Bobsworth	is it bad that I still have wine installed and running?
2007-01-25T12:18:00.000Z	Bobsworth	SecrethX	wine and cedega can coexist, but it might be best to close it while installing
