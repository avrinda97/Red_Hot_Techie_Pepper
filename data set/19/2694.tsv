2010-07-03T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	whoaaa calm down
2010-07-03T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	what do you want to do
2010-07-03T14:00:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	I'm a new triager resaerching on touchpads ..
2010-07-03T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	ok - so if you are part of the simar then you should know that this channel is for ubuntu support only, not generic linux questions
2010-07-03T14:01:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	ya thats why i ask question about the general information about packages that i mentioned..
2010-07-03T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	improper internet connection ???
2010-07-03T14:04:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	I mean not a working connection. I get such errors when the internet connection is down..
2010-07-03T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	what about DNS - could it not just be a dns issue ?
2010-07-03T14:06:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	whats the right channel to ask the question about the driver packages ..
2010-07-03T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	ask with the driver maintainers
2010-07-03T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	sorry, the package maintainers
2010-07-03T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	if you look on launchpad.net you'll find out who  maintains the package and you can contact them
2010-07-03T14:07:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	ok but i think synaptics is not on launchpad? Does in your knowledge they have a channel on irc?
2010-07-03T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	synaptics is the package manager, not the package, you want to ask the maintainers of the packages gdm, etc
2010-07-03T14:08:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	i'm talking about xserver-xorg-input-synaptics this is the touchpad drivers and not a part of x.
2010-07-03T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	simar	ok - so talk to the person who maintains xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
2010-07-03T14:09:00.000Z	simar	ikonia	ok thanks
