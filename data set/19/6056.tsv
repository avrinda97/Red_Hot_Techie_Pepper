2008-09-01T21:13:00.000Z	d0c5i5		i can't seem to get my wireless working right in ubuntu... i was switch to the ndiswrapper from the kernel module because I was getting a strange wmaster0 interface
2008-09-01T21:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	wmaster0 is harmless is a virtual interface to manage te main one(s). you should be using the kernel driver
2008-09-01T21:14:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	I can't seem to get ubutu to work with it correctly... i have to do alot of random stuff to get it to work :-/
2008-09-01T21:15:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	For instance I have to (Every time i login) set the adapter to roaming, then go back into "Network settings" and manually resettup my WPA each time... if i don't do things in that specific order, then it just fails to work
2008-09-01T21:16:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	and the profiles don't seem to work to change the settings reliably
2008-09-01T21:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	if you ca not use sudo you can not set a root password so any solution implies booting into rcovery mode
2008-09-01T21:17:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	it's an intel nic, iwl4965 module
2008-09-01T21:17:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	i can use sudo fine, but the adapter seems to require kicking the card around a bit before it responds
2008-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	i just saying that the wmaster0 iface is harmless if you have other problems that's a different issue
2008-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	maybe this is a hit, but the Wireless Networks tool never populates with anything
2008-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	sorry that msg was for Mrono but he is gone
2008-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	ok, got it
2008-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	the real interface to use is wlan0
2008-09-01T21:19:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	I was trying the ndiswrapper off of a recommendation from in here a couple days ago
2008-09-01T21:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	you should have both wmaster0 (virtual) and thr real one wlan0
2008-09-01T21:19:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	yes, i can use wlan0... but I get both, and if I, for instance, hit "Configure"
2008-09-01T21:20:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	I get "That adapater does not exist"... same with wlan0... even though I can set an IP/etc
2008-09-01T21:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	d0c5i5	:| mine works fine with NM (i have both interaces with my ralink) ...
2008-09-01T21:21:00.000Z	d0c5i5	erUSUL	hmm... somethings a tad off, can't  figure out what it is.
