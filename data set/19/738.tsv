2011-09-23T04:07:00.000Z	minnillo		what's your problem
2011-09-23T04:07:00.000Z	minnillo		hello guys how are you all today
2011-09-23T04:09:00.000Z	minnillo		hi guys, may i ask what header files are for? or just basically what they are?
2011-09-23T04:09:00.000Z	Praet0rian	minnillo	generally they define portions of programs
2011-09-23T04:09:00.000Z	minnillo		uhm ok
2011-09-23T04:10:00.000Z	minnillo		not really sure what that means hehe
2011-09-23T04:10:00.000Z	Praet0rian	minnillo	well in programming you have waht are called functions, in C language you can define your function definitions in a header file
2011-09-23T04:12:00.000Z	minnillo		praetorian: hmm i see. but in linux are they the same as in programming?
2011-09-23T04:13:00.000Z	minnillo		praetorian: cause i've been hearing about them lately a lot on linux whenever intalling some programs
2011-09-23T04:13:00.000Z	minnillo		Praetorian: i just got curious what header files are
2011-09-23T04:13:00.000Z	minnillo		in linux
2011-09-23T04:13:00.000Z	Praet0rian	minnillo	no prob
2011-09-23T04:13:00.000Z	minnillo		alright thanks Praet0rian
2011-09-23T04:14:00.000Z	Praet0rian	minnillo	best way to understand them would be to take a programming tutorial
2011-09-23T04:14:00.000Z	minnillo		are they present in Java too?
2011-09-23T04:14:00.000Z	Praet0rian	minnillo	java uses class files
2011-09-23T04:14:00.000Z	Praet0rian	minnillo	little different
2011-09-23T04:14:00.000Z	minnillo		ahhh i see
2011-09-23T04:15:00.000Z	minnillo	Praet0rian	yeah ok i think i kinda get header files now. thanks for your help :)
