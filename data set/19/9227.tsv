2007-10-13T06:28:00.000Z	firebird619		I just switched to Ubuntu from another distro. I backed up the Firefox and Thunderbird folders to a CD so I could keep the addons, e-mails, etc. to be able to transfer them to ubuntu. When I tried to transfer them from the CD to Ubuntu, I get an Input/Output error. What is causing this, and how can I fix it?
2007-10-13T06:29:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	Sounds like a bad CD
2007-10-13T06:30:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	Other files I backed up on the CD transfered fine though. It is just Firefox and Thunderbird. Would it be bad if only those couple folders won't transfer over?
2007-10-13T06:31:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	It *could* be.  There could be a problem with the blocks containing those files.  You're right to be suspicicious, though.  Can you restore into some neutral location like /tmp?
2007-10-13T06:32:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	I hadn't tried /tmp yet. I will try right now.
2007-10-13T06:34:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	No, that didn't work either. The cd shows the owner as being root, even though I wasn't root when I put the files to CD. I tried copying the files to ubuntu through nautilus as root (gksudo nautilus) but that didn't work. Could it be something with permissions or something?
2007-10-13T06:35:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	I'd expect permissions problems to give "permission denied"; "input/output error" usually means hardware.
2007-10-13T06:35:00.000Z	Anarch		I usually work from the CLUI, not the GUI, so I don't know gksudo etc.
2007-10-13T06:36:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	Perhaps <untested>hdparm -E 0 /dev/$cd </untested> would help.
2007-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	Ok, I thought it would give permission denied to if that was the problem, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.
2007-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	But you'll need to know the CLUI to understand what I mean; and you need to know what /dev/foo is your CD-ROM drive.
2007-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	see `man hdparm`.
2007-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	Ok, Thanks.
2007-10-13T06:38:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	If that doesn't work, you might try reading the CD on some other box.  Different drives can be very picky, especially if the CD was written fast.
2007-10-13T06:38:00.000Z	Anarch	firebird619	After that, I'd give up, learn from the experience (CDs are unreliable), and rebuild the Firefox configuration by hand.
2007-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	It was Thunderbird I was more worried about thank Firefox. Should have backed up to two different discs to be safe. I used a DVD because I backed up other files as well. I remember having this problem one other time, but for some reason it corrected itself and finally let me transfer files. With any luck, the same will happen this time.
2007-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	firebird619		than*
2007-10-13T06:58:00.000Z	firebird619		On my monitor, in various places, there are pixels that are flashing, white, red, etc. I see them when there are dark colors on the screen, whether it is the wallpaper, or a dark colored section on a Web site, etc. I have an idea this is a sign my monitor is going out or something, but thought I would ask to see what someone else had to say or suggest for a solution.
2007-10-13T07:11:00.000Z	firebird619	Anarch	I used the hdparm command, it returned Input/Output error. I assume it is a bad CD then? I tried that command with another CD and it did not return any errors.
