2010-10-17T19:58:00.000Z	what_thef_ever		I downloaded the source code, compiled and installd it and now by Ubuntu is smashed to peices

2010-10-17T20:01:00.000Z	what_thef_ever		icarus do you know how I can find out what version of Glib Ubuntu 10.04 LTS shipped with?

2010-10-17T20:02:00.000Z	what_thef_ever		icarus yes I use 10.04 LTS.
2010-10-17T20:03:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	how did you go about updating Glib?
2010-10-17T20:04:00.000Z	what_thef_ever	ubuntulxdeaa	I never intended on updating it. I was compiling an application call Audacious and it said I needed the Glib library, so I downloaded the source of Glib 2.26 and ./configure, make, make install, and then my system was stuffed.
2010-10-17T20:04:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	I see. The old problem of breaking one's own system due to not abiding exclusively to apt-get install usage
2010-10-17T20:05:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	you may avoid several headaches if you reinstall your system and abide by "sudo apt-get install"
2010-10-17T20:06:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	yeah, most people have broken their system either by that or dpkg -i
2010-10-17T20:06:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	the moment you don't "limit" yourself to your distro's repositories, you have to accept the risk of breaking your system, which is fine, but one has to accept it as inevitable
2010-10-17T20:11:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	I'd follow the "sudo apt-get install glib" route, but I cannot guarantee this would work. Also, consider invoking "sudo apt-get remove glib" (or libglib2 or whatever) before. There's also the option --fix-missing (to apt-get) but again I have barely tried all this
2010-10-17T20:14:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	ubuntu is not a good distro in order to compile things, from my viewpoint (and this point is to some extent supported by the fact that build-essential and the C compilers don't come with the standard installation). My advice, if you want to try things other than the repositories would be to download static binaries: these are .tgz as well, but they don't need compilation, they work out of the box once unta
2010-10-17T20:16:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	libglib2.0-0
2010-10-17T20:16:00.000Z	ubuntulxdeaa	what_thef_ever	libglib2.0-dev
