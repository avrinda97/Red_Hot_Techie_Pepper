2011-10-25T14:08:00.000Z	moose-machine		hi. i'm getting the following error: 'E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.' Can someone help me?
2011-10-25T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	what happens if you do as it says?
2011-10-25T14:11:00.000Z	moose-machine	ActionParsnip	i will be happy to uninstall vidalia to make it work again.
2011-10-25T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	if you need to navigate that you can use TAB and ENTER to select stuff
2011-10-25T14:14:00.000Z	moose-machine	ActionParsnip	yes. that worked. what a relief! thank u sooo much. :) cheers.
2011-10-25T14:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	np man
2011-11-12T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	do you use compiz (desktop effects)
2011-11-12T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	then run:  ccsm   and you can set it up there
2011-11-12T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	np man
2012-04-25T08:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	then your software will be backed up
2012-04-25T08:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	I suggest you delete Maverick and install Precise in it's place
2012-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	how did you install it?
2012-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	ok so Ubuntu is in it's own partition?
2012-04-25T08:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	then run a final backup of the stuff you need from Maverick and boot to Windows. Delete the Linux partitions and then boot to Precise liveCD and install to the new free space
2012-04-25T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	if you want, sure
2012-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	not sure about the humblebundle dude. You will need to redownload all your software and such
2012-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	I'd contact the humble guys
2012-04-25T08:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	obviously the packages will need reinstalling as not only will they be at different versions, they will be compiled for a much later released
2012-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moose-machine	yes it will all need reinstalling after the clean install
