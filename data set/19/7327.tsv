2007-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	Moniker42		hey, what plugin do i need to play kvcd files in Movie Player?
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	i don't think that you need a plugin for kvcd seeing that kvcd movies are essentially mpeg files.  Can you play kvcd files in movie player (totem btw) at the moment?
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	nope
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	i'd just use VLC but it's not letting me go fullscreen...
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	do you know how to get into full screen using VLC?
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	yes
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	i used it for months, now when i double-click or go to view>>fullscreen it just maximises the window
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	it says i need a VCD plugin for totem to play the kvcd file
2007-09-11T12:37:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	the version in the feisty repos
2007-09-11T12:37:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	googling...
2007-09-11T12:39:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	um, look at http://www.videohelp.com/forum/archive/mvcd-kvcd-t286448.html.  that might help
2007-09-11T12:40:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	apparently kvcd files will play fine in VLC.  I really don't know
2007-09-11T12:40:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	i already know they do - it just won't fullscreen
2007-09-11T12:41:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	eh, try the forums.  it could be because that kvcd is a non standard video (just chucking in a random guess)
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	just about to look at ur forum post
2007-09-11T12:47:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	seeing that ur sata drive works in ubuntu, it's a software issue, but what it is i dunno...
2007-09-11T12:48:00.000Z	Moniker42	penguincentral	no
2007-09-11T12:53:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	how's the hdd problem?
2007-09-11T12:53:00.000Z	penguincentral	Moniker42	bad bios maybe?
