2007-09-04T12:31:00.000Z	robert_		it cant acquire anything via dhcp

2007-09-04T12:31:00.000Z	robert_		I have a realtek 8185
2007-09-04T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	What happens when you connect with network-manager?
2007-09-04T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	The applet at the top left of the screen ( in your gnome-panel )
2007-09-04T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	"Roaming mode" means let network-manager deal with it :)
2007-09-04T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	Again, what happens when you connect with the network manager applet?
2007-09-04T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	No
2007-09-04T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	They are two different apps
2007-09-04T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	"Roaming mode" means let network-manager deal with it :)
2007-09-04T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	So if you don't have it installed roaming mode won't do anything but disable your card :)
2007-09-04T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	sorry
2007-09-04T12:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	Why not just set it back to manual?
2007-09-04T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	switching to roaming mode isn't permanent
2007-09-04T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	robert_	Just switch back
