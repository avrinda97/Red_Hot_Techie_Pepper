2009-01-21T12:28:00.000Z	tv7497		guys anyone ?
2009-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	I'd recommend you go with wpa, it's a good compromise of security and compatibility
2009-01-21T12:31:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	thank you sir
2009-01-21T12:52:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	UT2004, in my opinion
2009-01-21T12:53:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	what kinda game is it sir
2009-01-21T12:53:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	it's a commercial game, an FPS
2009-01-21T12:53:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	yeah, what syockit said
2009-01-21T12:54:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	the original unreal tournament is already very good if you don't mind the outdated graphics
2009-01-21T12:55:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	roughly the same genre but completely different feel
2009-01-21T12:57:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	what about fifa sir could it be played n ibex ?
2009-01-21T12:57:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	maybe, check the wine application database
2009-01-21T12:58:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	UT and UT2004 run natively though, without a compatibility layer
2009-01-21T13:20:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	sir well along with 177 driver we need to install many more application  to make nvidia card work the add/remove program took care for me sir you know what are required ?
2009-01-21T13:21:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	the package's post install script should take care of that, and apt should handle any dependencies
2009-01-21T13:21:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	oh!
2009-01-21T14:33:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	well sir i use vbox for open source reasons :D is vmware good ?
2009-01-21T14:33:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	if you can stick with open source it's probably better :) but yeah, I've found vmware fairly good
2009-01-21T14:35:00.000Z	tv7497	IchiFish	the main question thats haunting me sir why dont vbox or vmware provide graphics support so that games can be easily played is it to though sir ?
2009-01-21T14:35:00.000Z	IchiFish	tv7497	because direct3d is complicated enough as it is without proving it in another operating system
