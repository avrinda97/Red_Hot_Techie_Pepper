2007-05-20T09:54:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	gutsy is not released - it's alpha, whereas feisty is released & stable
2007-05-20T09:54:00.000Z	digital_k	Frogzoo	I know, I wanted to see for myself ...I decided to wait a while after reinstalling Feisty.. ;)

2007-05-21T07:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	disable the scripts in /etc/acpi/*bright*
2007-05-21T07:23:00.000Z	digital_k	Frogzoo	i have that opened in gedit, exactly what do i comment out?
2007-05-21T07:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	sudo chmod ugo-w /etc/acpi/*bright*
2007-05-21T07:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	sudo chmod ugo-x /etc/acpi/*bright*
2007-05-21T07:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	oh, that would disable all dimming controls - no you should check power manager settings
2007-05-21T07:26:00.000Z	digital_k	Frogzoo	when you open synaptic, its asks for a password, and the screen dims behind the password box, thats what I am trying to disable, the dimming of the screen.
2007-05-21T07:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	oh, no idea sorry
2007-05-21T07:27:00.000Z	digital_k	Frogzoo	thanks anyway :)
2007-05-21T07:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	you might find something in the gnome control - maybe
2007-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	digital_k	beryl is a point of difference with windows, it's totally superficial, but can impress your boss, who is clueless about linux
2007-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	digital_k	Frogzoo	beryl is quite impressive, no doubt.
