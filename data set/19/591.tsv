2012-01-22T13:44:00.000Z	sx_usr__		anyone?
2012-01-22T13:44:00.000Z	Emanon	sx_usr__	 You have the prop drivers (or noveau) installed?
2012-01-22T13:45:00.000Z	sx_usr__		yeah
2012-01-22T13:45:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	i have
2012-01-22T13:45:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	but from the drop down list for Resolution, it's up to 1600x900
2012-01-22T13:45:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	before 11.10, i can get up to 1920x1080
2012-01-22T13:45:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	now im using 11.10 and i only get max resolution of 1600x900
2012-01-22T13:45:00.000Z	Emanon		That IS odd. Have you checked the NVidia settings rather than the ubuntu display settings?
2012-01-22T13:46:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	yes, that's where i set it
2012-01-22T13:46:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	where is ubuntu display settings?
2012-01-22T13:46:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	i never use ubuntu display settings and i didn't know there is one....
2012-01-22T13:47:00.000Z	Emanon		hit the meta (windows) key and search for "Display" or "Monitors"
2012-01-22T13:47:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	oic, i can see that, but the optiosn in there is still up to 1600x900
2012-01-22T13:47:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	how can i "force" to use 1920x1080?
2012-01-22T13:48:00.000Z	Emanon		No idea was just checking the usual places.
2012-01-22T13:48:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	okay, thanks for the help.
2012-01-22T13:48:00.000Z	Emanon		Seeing if one allowed what you wanted.
2012-01-22T13:48:00.000Z	Emanon		Good luck, maybe someone else will know.
2012-01-22T13:48:00.000Z	sx_usr__	Emanon	yeah, hopefully
