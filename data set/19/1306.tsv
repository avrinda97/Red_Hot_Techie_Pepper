2011-05-16T01:47:00.000Z	jnlsnl_		All of a sudden i get: "ll: command not found" ? :-/
2011-05-16T01:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	sudo nano ~/.bashrc and uncomment #alias ll='ls -l'
2011-05-16T01:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	uncomment means remove the # from the start of the line. save the file and then run: source ~/.bashrc
2011-05-16T01:51:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	IdleOne	Strange!! the alias is there, but as another command
2011-05-16T01:51:00.000Z	jnlsnl_		and it worked yesterday :P
2011-05-16T01:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	there must of been some update that changed it perhaps. I don't know.
2011-05-16T01:52:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	IdleOne	it says: alias ll='ls -alF'
2011-05-16T01:52:00.000Z	jnlsnl_		But thanks! :)
2011-05-16T01:52:00.000Z	jnlsnl_		ill change it
2011-05-16T01:53:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	IdleOne	should it take effect right away or do i need to restart/reload something ?
2011-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	either restart the terminal or run: source ~/.bashrc
2011-05-16T01:58:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	IdleOne	it removes the alias from the files when i disconnect and reconnect to my server, strange
2011-05-16T01:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	you editing the file with sudo?
2011-05-16T01:59:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	IdleOne	if i disconnect, reconnect and run source ~/.bashrc it works
2011-05-16T02:00:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	IdleOne	but then i have to do source ~/.bashrc on every connect :S
2011-05-16T02:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	hmm that shouldn't need to be done every time.
2011-05-16T02:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	not sure what else to tell you now
2011-05-16T02:01:00.000Z	jnlsnl_		maybe i should try to reboot the server!
2011-05-16T02:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	jnlsnl_	no, follow iceroot first
