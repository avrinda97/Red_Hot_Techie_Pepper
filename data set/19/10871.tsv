2006-07-14T09:21:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	i915 =)
2006-07-14T09:24:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	thanks man
2006-07-14T09:25:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	Only thing not working in AIGLX right now, as far as I know, is that the Water plugin doesn't work
2006-07-14T09:33:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	How's ReactOS coming along? I've heard a bit about it, but never really checked it out
2006-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	It's come VERY fary in the past year.  : )  I think it will be "stable" and usable within the next 1-2 years
2006-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	then again, I consider most "unstable" packages and releases good enough for me
2006-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	Hrm...I'll have to try it out then...Time to add another CD to the stack of linux disks I need to try =P
2006-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	it's still safer to use an unstable linux install vs. windoze
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	I run my web/smb/time/tor/UT2004 server on Debian unstable...I live for the bleeding edge =)
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	hahhaaha (well it's not linux, it's a full re-write of the windows OS)
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	very nice  :)
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	Well, open source reverse engineer of Windows done from shoddy developer docs, but yeah, still open source
2006-07-14T09:35:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	heck yes  : )
2006-07-14T09:38:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	Isn't there an ubuntu-minimal package?
2006-07-14T09:38:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	DarkElf109	I didn't know if there was/wasn't.  And if there is I'm not sure what it iinstalls
2006-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	DarkElf109	FunnyLookinHat	Ubuntu, of course =)
