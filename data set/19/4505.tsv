2009-01-03T04:49:00.000Z	ehmck		someon please help-- i'm super desperate-- been spending last8hrs on this, and keep making things worse-- I'm on Hardy and upgraded to newer vim version by adding this to my sources: http://packages.debian.org/sid/vim, and then did an apt-get install vim-full, but the upgrade apparently broke my pidgin (and probably other things)-- how do i go back to the previous state?
2009-01-03T04:51:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	There is a dpkg log
2009-01-03T04:57:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	Did you fix your sources.list first already?
2009-01-03T04:57:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	yeah
2009-01-03T04:58:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	It's a tricky business due to the underlying dependencies
2009-01-03T05:57:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	I'm pretty sure I told you earlier it was a risky business to downgrade, due to dependencies
2009-01-03T05:59:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	i know, but what other options do i have?
2009-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	Reinstall is probably less time consuming for this in the end of it all.
2009-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	i was afraid of that
2009-01-03T06:02:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	Flannel: so what is best way to reinstall?  reinstall ubuntu?
2009-01-03T06:02:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	Backup whatevers in your /home/yourname          and /etc
2009-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	/home and /etc-- is that all I should worry about?
2009-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	Those are the most important
2009-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	Since flash and other previously problemmatic apps are now available for 64 bit I'd say go for it
2009-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	You have 4Gb or more of ram, or less?
2009-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	i've got 3Gb of ram
2009-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	genii	ehmck	32 bit will run more apps and still see all your ram.
2009-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	ah-- maybe i'll stick with 32 then... thanks!!
2009-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	ehmck	genii	wj32: ok-- see you on the other side with my 32bit intrepid
