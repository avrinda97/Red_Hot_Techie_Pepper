2006-10-22T12:47:00.000Z	marc_		Can't
2006-10-22T12:47:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	have you tried network-manager-gnome?
2006-10-22T12:48:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	or -kde if you use kubuntu
2006-10-22T12:48:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	'sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome'
2006-10-22T12:49:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	gives you a notification area applet that has a drop-down list of wlan's it can find, yo click on one and it prompts for any necessary security credentials
2006-10-22T12:49:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	or you can 'connect to other network' and manually type in the SSID and encryption settings
2006-10-22T12:52:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	i should have specified it helps you configure the usage of an already recognized wifi chipset
2006-10-22T12:52:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	it doesn't help you get an unrecognized chipset working
2006-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	intel ipw2200 works great
2006-10-22T14:02:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	Answer ....
2006-10-22T14:04:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	i'ver never seen that, can you copy/paste just the available to root part/
2006-10-22T14:05:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	possibly
2006-10-22T14:05:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	ah, run 'sudo lspci -v' and enter your login password when prompted
2006-10-22T14:08:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	have you searched ubuntuforums for your chipset?
2006-10-22T14:14:00.000Z	fangorious	marc_	sorry i couldn't get you up and running
