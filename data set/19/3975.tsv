2010-06-25T19:33:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	Is it connected via DVI or RGB?
2010-06-25T19:33:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	RGB
2010-06-25T19:34:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	But there is a DVI to RGB adapter between the PC and the cable going to the KVM
2010-06-25T19:34:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	Normally when you connect via DVI the computer can get information about your monitors capabilities EDID.
2010-06-25T19:35:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	seems like I should be able to force Ubuntu to just understand that my monitor can do 1280x1024
2010-06-25T19:35:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	Because you're using a converter your monitor is not able to get this data.  You can export it though whilst connected to it via DVI and then manually specify it in your Xorg using the "CustomEDID" option.
2010-06-25T19:36:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	that sounds like a great idea.
2010-06-25T19:36:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	would that be done with the *gasp* CLI?
2010-06-25T19:37:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	Do you have an nvidia graphics card?
2010-06-25T19:38:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	intel
2010-06-25T19:38:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	onboard
2010-06-25T19:40:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	I've only ever acquired it from an nvidia card using their proprietary nvidia-settings tool.  But theres something in the repos that might help read-edid
2010-06-25T19:41:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	I just had another idea.  My monitor has both a DVI and a RGB port on it.  I may just use the RGB for my windows box, and the DVI for my Ubuntu box.  That way I can bypass the KVM for video altogether.
2010-06-25T19:42:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	Yeah that works I do a similar thing the only down side is it can be a little slow to switch between the two.
2010-06-25T19:43:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	I think I may even have to press a button on the monitor to get it to do so.  Oh well.  It will still allow me to have both at one desk.  Space is precious where I have them.
2010-06-25T19:46:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	I'm using the smallest of these 4, to give you an idea.  If it wasn't so small I'd have a cheap nVidia card in it. http://www.itreviews.co.uk/graphics/normal/hardware/h809.jpg
2010-06-25T19:47:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	I still think you'll be able to do it I've just never done it on an intel card to give you exact steps.
2010-06-25T19:47:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	eoke	well you've pointed me in the right direction.  I appreciate the help.
2010-06-25T19:48:00.000Z	eoke	Cajun_Lan_Man	No worries best of luck
