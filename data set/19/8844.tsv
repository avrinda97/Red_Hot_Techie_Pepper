2008-02-08T13:30:00.000Z	fragged		mhm anybody know if Ubuntu has NTFS-Read support in kernel?
2008-02-08T13:31:00.000Z	Yancho	fragged	its empty .. never used
2008-02-08T13:34:00.000Z	Yancho	fragged	i tried to load it on windows .. it loaded .. but i tried to format it on windows it was saying its not working :\
2008-02-08T13:35:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	provided you are trying to format it 'mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1' but that is VERY DANGEORUS YOU WILL LOSE ALL DATA (And anybody else who blindly types YOU COULD LOSE YOUR ROOT)
2008-02-08T13:36:00.000Z	Yancho	fragged	well it is empty .. i just want to format it so i can start use it :) is it safe if i type it ?
2008-02-08T13:36:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	I'd rather somebody else give an opinion as well
2008-02-08T13:38:00.000Z	Yancho	fragged	: http://yancho.no-ip.org/~yancho/dmesg.txt
2008-02-08T13:40:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	Ok I'm confident that your flash disk is /dev/sda1, go ahead and format it... just in some cases sda can be a SATA disk, or in an inpropper kernel such as mine, a IDE disk, so if you have no other SATA or USB disks type 'mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1'
2008-02-08T13:40:00.000Z	Yancho	fragged	my disk is just ide .. so i am safe?
2008-02-08T13:41:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	yes, I checked your dmesg :)
2008-02-08T13:42:00.000Z	Yancho	fragged	^^
2008-02-08T13:43:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	once done, pulling the USB out and putting it back in should bring up the folder provided you have a stock install of ubuntu :)
2008-02-08T13:47:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	great, sorry I was a bit unsure at times, I didnt want to ruin somebodys linux experience :)
2008-02-08T13:50:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	no problem, and from experience I know theres not a worse feeling than telling somebody they've lost everything, even when its not your fault (and I tend to be the one to tell people this at work :()
2008-02-08T13:53:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	why would you want to? that would mean you would require the USB to be plugged all the time, instead try offloading non-essentual files to the USB (IE MP3s etc)
2008-02-08T13:54:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	I dont actually know how to 'bridge' hard drives, it can be done afaik but I've just never done it ;)
2008-02-08T13:55:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	I'd still recommend just throwing documents there manually,
2008-02-08T13:57:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	or even just cleaning out non-essentual files, if there are other directories on the same partition have a look in them, especially wherever ubuntu keeps its downloaded files
2008-02-08T13:57:00.000Z	fragged	Yancho	yes
