2012-03-04T12:12:00.000Z	needhelp1		Im looking to install ubuntu next to another linux distro on my pc, im having issues determing where i should install grub to. I dont want to mess up my existing grub menu and i want to be able to boot to both distros
2012-03-04T12:13:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	in the mbr generally what is the other distro?
2012-03-04T12:14:00.000Z	needhelp1	CFHowlett	how do i tell what bootloader i currently have?
2012-03-04T12:14:00.000Z	needhelp1	CFHowlett	loads directly from hdd, no grub menu as this is the only OS on the pc currently
2012-03-04T12:15:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	what is that distro?
2012-03-04T12:15:00.000Z	needhelp1		another ubuntu version
2012-03-04T12:15:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	both grub 2 if past 9.10, put the grub in the mbr and this install will have grub controll.
2012-03-04T12:16:00.000Z	needhelp1		do i need to check where my grub is currently installed to?
2012-03-04T12:16:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	no
2012-03-04T12:16:00.000Z	needhelp1		so choose mbr correct?
2012-03-04T12:17:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	yes as CFHowlett described.
2012-03-04T12:17:00.000Z	needhelp1	CFHowlett	no bootloader would mean  i still have grub just not splash correct.
2012-03-04T12:18:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	if you tapped shift at powering on with just the original ubuntu you would se ethe grub menu.
2012-03-04T12:18:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		or esc depending on the actual ubuntu release.
2012-03-04T12:18:00.000Z	needhelp1		asuming there is one, i would still install to mbr correct?
2012-03-04T12:19:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	yes, just note that when you want top update grub it will be from this install.
2012-03-04T12:19:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		to*
2012-03-04T12:20:00.000Z	needhelp1		thanks.
2012-03-04T12:22:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	needhelp1	you will see a grub menu now if you want either OS to be at the top as default, you would just give that Ubuntu grub control, by running a grub install to the mbr from the terminal in that version.
