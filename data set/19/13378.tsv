2005-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	Xira		XMMS locks up when I try to play music
2005-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	Xira		:(
2005-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	Xira		and it wont run as nicholas
2005-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	Xira		only as root
2005-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	: that means you are probably using the wrong sound server under options
2005-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	codemac		Listen to niran
2005-04-09T11:34:00.000Z	Xira		Well how do I get it to run as nicholas?
2005-04-09T11:34:00.000Z	Xira		its only running as root'
2005-04-09T11:34:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	you can't even run it?
2005-04-09T11:35:00.000Z	Xira		not as nicholas
2005-04-09T11:35:00.000Z	Xira		only as root
2005-04-09T11:35:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	so it doesn't lock up then?
2005-04-09T11:36:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	it just doesn't start?
2005-04-09T11:36:00.000Z	Xira	codemac	when im as root and i can open xmms.. it locks up when i play a song
2005-04-09T11:36:00.000Z	Xira		but i cant even get it to run as my regular user
2005-04-09T11:37:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	it is the esd setting in xmms that is making it lock up in root
2005-04-09T11:37:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	but as your user.... permissions is my best guess
2005-04-09T11:37:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	try running sudo usermod -G audio [username] 
2005-04-09T11:38:00.000Z	codemac	Xira	then check and see what the permissions are on xmms itself... after that I'm not sure
