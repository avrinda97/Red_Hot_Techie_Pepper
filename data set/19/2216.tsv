2010-05-31T21:53:00.000Z	mek8630		Does anybody know why the program "DeVeDe" won't convert the entire movie for me so I can burn it?
2010-05-31T21:54:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	what do you mean? do you get an error message at some point?
2010-05-31T21:55:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	No it just only converts about 2 min. of the movie but also when I watch the movie it says I need to download some other video player to watch it. It doesn't make any sense.
2010-05-31T21:55:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	sounds like you didn't install all the extras that sprung just linked to
2010-05-31T21:57:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	sprung: thank you hope I can get it figured out. I wish Ubuntu and other Linux op. systems were as easy to figure stuff out as it is for Windows but everything else stayed the same.
2010-05-31T21:57:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	its not harder, just different :)
2010-05-31T21:57:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	I know I feel like I am lost all the time haha
2010-05-31T21:58:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	welcome to the club, we all felt that way when we started
2010-05-31T21:58:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	everything I go to use something it needs 3 or 4 other programs or something to go with it
2010-05-31T21:58:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	if you are installing things with synaptic it should pull all the dependencies with it
2010-05-31T21:59:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	is the the Ubuntu software center?
2010-05-31T21:59:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	Ubuntu software center is another front end but it should work the same, just not list all the individual packages
2010-05-31T22:00:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	where do I find synaptics
2010-05-31T22:01:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	not totally sure but under the admin menu I believe
2010-05-31T22:03:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	thank you I found it, so should I just start installing my programs/apps with this synaptics?
2010-05-31T22:04:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	there or the software center, both are good
2010-05-31T22:05:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	oh wow I don't know if I could ever get this synaptic figured out, sometimes I feel like giving up and going back to the crap os windows just because at least I know what I am doing.
2010-05-31T22:06:00.000Z	Halitech	mek8630	I use the search function alot but the software center is just as good
2010-05-31T22:08:00.000Z	mek8630	Halitech	sprung: thank you for your help I am checking out that link now that you sent me sprung.
