2005-07-21T07:57:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	re your earlier question, you can use ANY truetype fonts.  they go on ~/.fonts
2005-07-21T08:00:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	if you put them in ~/.fonts, only YOU will have access, in /usr/share/fonts, everyone who uses the puter has access
2005-07-21T08:02:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	there are many types of fonts, type1 are adobe style, i believe
2005-07-21T08:03:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	i see.
2005-07-21T08:05:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	linukso was suggesting some order to your font collection, you can have fonts directly under /truetype/ or in folders of descriptive names
2005-07-21T08:06:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	should one care about organizing their new fonts? is there a mess if we just put all new fonts into one folder?
2005-07-21T08:08:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	some users like to keep the fonts they collect in some type of order (by d/l site, by style of font, etc) it is all up to you
2005-07-21T08:08:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	i understand. 8-)
2005-07-21T08:09:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	any time you are not in your ~/  folder, you need root permission to write things
2005-07-21T08:09:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	how do i give myself permission?
2005-07-21T08:10:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	you can name it what you like, just use "sudo"
2005-07-21T08:11:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	it is NOT advised you let nautilus have root priveleges (it can really mess up your user space)
2005-07-21T08:12:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	can it? in that case, i'll do the "sudo mkdir" method ,then.
2005-07-21T08:12:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	learning the terminal is a good investment in time
2005-07-21T08:16:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	use the "cp" command with sudo  (in a terminal, type "man cp" for basic usage)
2005-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	is there a way to give my new subfolder write/copy permission? and is it safe?
2005-07-21T08:18:00.000Z	naliothatwrk	bigfoot1	the permissions are the filesystem the way they are for security reasons (malicious code, malicious people, etc)
2005-07-21T08:21:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	thank you/ arigato
2005-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	bigfoot1	naliothatwrk	linukso: a website offers a font in three formats: mac ttf; mac ps1; pc ttf. Which one should i get?
