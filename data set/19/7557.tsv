2007-08-04T08:44:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	Yeah
2007-08-04T08:45:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	Do they come out with new versions for new DVD protection algorithms?
2007-08-04T08:45:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	wine and dvdshrink works too. I just try to avoid using wine
2007-08-04T08:45:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	Will AnyDVD+CloneDVD work?
2007-08-04T08:45:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	I've only run into one or two dvd's it won't work on
2007-08-04T08:45:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	Yeah, anydvd should work for hddvd as well
2007-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	So those 2 apps should work under wine?
2007-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	if you want a 20gig file lol
2007-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	Just for DVDs.
2007-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	I don't know about anydvd but dvdshrink will for sure
2007-08-04T08:47:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	So does dvdshrink let you preview the files in the DVD?
2007-08-04T08:47:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	ye
2007-08-04T08:48:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	yes*
2007-08-04T08:48:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	How about newer versions? I'm used to AnyDVD coming out every other day.
2007-08-04T08:49:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	I really don't know. I use acidrip
2007-08-04T08:49:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	Is acidrip good? (compression/preview/versions)
2007-08-04T08:50:00.000Z	Clearze4	kazol	It has every option you need.
2007-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	kazol	Clearze4	Ok, thanks, I'll try it. I was always looking for an app since k9copy or xdvdshrink does not work.
