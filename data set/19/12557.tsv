2005-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	iiiears		Hi thoreauputic!
2005-08-25T07:12:00.000Z	iiiears		Hi brenner
2005-08-25T07:13:00.000Z	iiiears		Having trouble with my irc client being overflowed. - would like to find a client that won't accept private messages.
2005-08-25T07:14:00.000Z	iiiears		spent the morning reading about snort inline and packet queues - just seems too drastic for now
2005-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	iiiears		X-chat
2005-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	can't you use the ignore list and filter *@* with private enabled?
2005-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	can you try and msg me?  i'll test it now
2005-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	iiiears	brenner	nice tip
2005-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	did you try and msg me?
2005-08-25T07:23:00.000Z	iiiears	brenner	adding ignore "*@*"  seems to work  Thank You  -   spent 2 hours reading about packet mangling. roflmao
2005-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	glad to hear......i actually thought of that myself \0/
2005-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	although a little bloated, xchat is pretty nice i'd say
2005-11-01T08:13:00.000Z	iiiears	brenner	- variable bit rate adapts to keep as much song data in each song file as possible. on lossless encoding is better.
2005-11-01T08:13:00.000Z	iiiears	brenner	- erm "only
2005-11-01T08:14:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	thanks for the info.  i'm guessing FLAC gives 192kpbs?
2005-11-01T08:15:00.000Z	iiiears	brenner	- i like flac best
2005-11-01T08:16:00.000Z	brenner	iiiears	what sort of rip rate do you get?  i'm getting ~4 using OGG, and a CD takes roughly 10 minutes....i'm guessing flac takes longer?
2005-11-01T08:16:00.000Z	iiiears	brenner	- yeah - pretty darn slow about 3X
