2009-07-26T10:31:00.000Z	losher	rvn	might as well downgrade to 8.04.3 LTS...
2009-07-26T10:31:00.000Z	rvn	losher	i like 8.10 :/
2009-07-26T10:31:00.000Z	rvn	losher	it works for me
2009-07-26T10:32:00.000Z	losher	rvn	that's fine. It's just not supported as long...
2009-07-26T10:33:00.000Z	rvn	losher	well since the currently supported versions' support is blatantly failing to resolve my issue, does it matter?
2009-07-26T10:33:00.000Z	losher	rvn	it doesn't matter to me. I tried 9.04 and got tired of it's little failures, and went back to 8.04
2009-07-26T10:34:00.000Z	rvn		problem tho is im out of cds
2009-07-26T10:34:00.000Z	rvn		i used my last one to burn 9.04 :(
