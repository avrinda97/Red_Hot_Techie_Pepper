2010-12-24T02:11:00.000Z	artos		I have Windows7 installed on a partition on disk 'hdc'. This is partition /dev/sdc1. I tried to install Ubuntu from the LiveCD to /dev/sdc3. I cannot get my boot loader to work: after booting it goes straight to loading Windows 7.
2010-12-24T02:12:00.000Z	artos		Here is my 'fdisk -l' output: http://pastebin.com/E2Q6xGJt
2010-12-24T02:12:00.000Z	artos		that's what I did
2010-12-24T02:13:00.000Z	artos		I created an extended partition /dev/sdc3, then pointed it there. For the bootloader I chose the location /dev/sdc (which was wrong, I think).
2010-12-24T02:14:00.000Z	artos		yeah..
2010-12-24T02:14:00.000Z	artos		so now I have /dev/sdc1 with Win7, /dev/sdc3 with Ubuntu, and I'm not getting the bootloader menu
2010-12-24T02:14:00.000Z	artos		I just boot straight into Win7
2010-12-24T02:14:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	hold down F8 when booting - does that give you options?
2010-12-24T02:15:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	windows will let you load ubuntu, AND ubuntu will let you load windows, you have to pick which way you want it to work before you install the bootloader for either OS.
2010-12-24T02:15:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	another thing you can do, if you give me one second
2010-12-24T02:16:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	which terminal?
2010-12-24T02:17:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	in windows, go to my computer and right click and select properties, in there on the left select advanced system settings, in there go to the advanced tab, in there click the startup and recovery settings button
2010-12-24T02:18:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	in that window you can select how long the boot prompt shows up in the windows bootloader.
2010-12-24T02:18:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	thus making it so you don't have to press F8.
2010-12-24T02:21:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	the windows vista/7 bootloader is a lot more feature rich than it used to be. pastebin your grub.conf
2010-12-24T02:22:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	what keldrum said.
2010-12-24T02:22:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	it does ask you.
2010-12-24T02:30:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	MBR
2010-12-24T02:30:00.000Z	genewitch	artos	master boot record
