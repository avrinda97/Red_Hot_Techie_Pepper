2010-04-30T18:11:00.000Z	tarzeau		i don't want to fuckup 3000 users
2010-04-30T18:13:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	you can use bitorrent to
2010-04-30T18:13:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	no we're not allowed to, we've got gbit internet, and should not use p2p software
2010-04-30T18:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	no, i don't think so
2010-04-30T18:14:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	is that an ISP restriction ?
2010-04-30T18:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	no, it's the managers of the border firewalls of www.ethz.ch that setup this rule
2010-04-30T18:15:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	arf, fu!ker :D
2010-04-30T18:15:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	it's fine for single laptop users, but ethernet gets a problem when overloading, and that happens with skype/p2p software supernodes
2010-04-30T18:15:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	I guess, at work we just have a maximum upload + download of 120 Kbytes... so
2010-04-30T18:16:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	we don't unlimited both ways, just no p2p
2010-04-30T18:16:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	just saying that if you want to avoid overload, limit "load", not protocols :D
2010-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	for each and every p2p program? that's beyond
2010-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	no, for each mac address
2010-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	i have no idea how
2010-04-30T18:17:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	i'm not managing any of these managed routers
2010-04-30T18:18:00.000Z	Galerien	tarzeau	ok, sorry
2010-04-30T18:18:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	i'm only automating workstation installations, and fixing software issues on them
2010-04-30T18:43:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	that only works for stuff in /etc/fstab
2010-04-30T19:23:00.000Z	tarzeau	Galerien	i hope he's got a backup
