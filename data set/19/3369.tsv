2012-08-30T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	a quick visit to http://ppa.launchpad.net/kernel-ppa/ppa/ubuntu/dists/   will show it doesn't support precise
2012-08-30T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	try not spamming and do some research, helps a lot
2012-08-30T21:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	hammering paste doesn't make anyone want to help you any more and gets you kicked
2012-08-30T21:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	remove the PPA, clearly
2012-08-30T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	yes, because the PPA you added doesn't support Precise, which you are using
2012-08-30T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	you can use software centre, or delete the relevant files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d
2012-08-30T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	have some patience, I'm not that fast
2012-08-30T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	give people time to think, and to type
2012-08-30T21:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	are you always this impatient, its particularly annoying
2012-08-30T21:28:00.000Z	acer	ActionParsnip	i'm not impatient as not allowing you to type, but in as not bothering waiting for a message board reply, sometimes people skip the text after, dont worry, no need to feel im beeing impatient at all
2012-08-30T21:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	acer	well when you reply so quickly to prompt for responce within only a few seconds, you come across as such
