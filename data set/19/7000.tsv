2007-11-02T05:22:00.000Z	sharpie		um, how can I backup all my programs and settings (let's say, if i'm gonna install on another drive)?
2007-11-02T05:23:00.000Z	sharpie		um, LjL, what exactly does that backup?
2007-11-02T05:23:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	1) you can get a list of the packages you have installed using the method above  2) to back up your data and personal program settings, you will need to back up your /home  3) if you manually changed anything in /etc, you may want to back it up
2007-11-02T05:23:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	it doesn't backup anything, it merely creates a list of the programs you have installed, and you can easily re-install them from that list later
2007-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	and how about if i wanna backup stuff like, um, my compiz settings?
2007-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	they will be in your /home.
2007-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	if i backup my entire /home dir and overwrite the other installation...well, will it work?
2007-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	what do you mean "overwrite the other installation"?
2007-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	overwrite the /home dir on the new installation
2007-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	yes, that's the idea. only one caveat: if you have more than one user, you might have to make sure the user ID's match. if you only have one user, it will be UID 1000, so that won't be a problem.
2007-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	ok, thanks
2007-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	will that backup my programs as well?
2007-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	no, as i told you... backing up /home will back up your *settings*. you *should not* back up your programs - that would result in a mess. just generate a *list* of the programs you have installed, and then reinstall them (which, as the bot said, can be done quite automatically)
2007-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	reinstall using the dpkg thing?
2007-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	if your internet connection isn't too fast for that to be comfortable, you can possibly back up /var/cache/apt/archives (which contains the .deb files of everything you downloaded)
2007-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	LjL		!cloning
2007-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	LjL	sharpie	reinstall using the command above, yes
2007-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	alright
2007-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	sharpie	LjL	i'm gonna just install win and linux on separate drives
