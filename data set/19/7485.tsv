2007-08-24T08:30:00.000Z	MBR666	byonix	it's a waste of system resources as far as im concerned. heh
2007-08-24T08:31:00.000Z	byonix		wastrel : i mean like, you don't have vista to enjoyed it
2007-08-24T08:31:00.000Z	MBR666	byonix	besides microsoft copied it from apple who in turned copied it from the linux community. but microhell calls it wigets i think
