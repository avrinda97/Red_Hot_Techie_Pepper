2007-12-04T01:57:00.000Z	seicherl_bob		hi there! i'm trying to set up a small simple access point. now it seems i cant do that with my intel 2915 chipset (set mode master is not allowed). has anybody any expierences with setting up an access point?
2007-12-04T01:59:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	wireshark is all you need to listen on a wire
2007-12-04T01:59:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	yes, but i need the AP installed on the laptop
2007-12-04T02:01:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	I missed the first part of your problem. Are you trying to pull a MITM attack by posing as the AP?
2007-12-04T02:01:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	something like that...
2007-12-04T02:01:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	it's for my studies
2007-12-04T02:01:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	Ettercap is a program that would solve a lot of your problems
2007-12-04T02:02:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	right now, i dont need the sniffer, but the accesspoint. its part of the assignment. i need to set up an accesspoint on my laptop
2007-12-04T02:03:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	Oh, so you need arp and routing tables stored to your laptop from the local network?
2007-12-04T02:04:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	i need to set up the wifi as access point... which wont work cause iwconfig keeps telling me, that that mode is not allowed
2007-12-04T02:04:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	you may need to patch the wifi drivers to allow passive mode. What kind of card is it?
2007-12-04T02:05:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	intel ipw2915
2007-12-04T02:06:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	i found ipw2200 AP on sourceforge, but it wont work. i cant install it and there is no documentation and nothing.... sucks...
2007-12-04T02:07:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	hang on I'm at work one sec
2007-12-04T02:07:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	sure.
2007-12-04T02:09:00.000Z	taoist	seicherl_bob	what errors does it give you when you try to run the program? Have you built the binaries already?
2007-12-04T02:09:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	it crashed doing make install.... it couldnt copy the files and nothing...
2007-12-04T02:11:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	some other guy reportet the same bug on sourceforge
2007-12-04T02:12:00.000Z	seicherl_bob	taoist	this guy reportet quite the same problem: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1600249&forum_id=499616
