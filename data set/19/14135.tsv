2004-11-14T06:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	eruditus	how is it not detected?
2004-11-14T06:10:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	it _is_ detected by the hardware manager, but not by any of the pilot programs.
2004-11-14T06:10:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	I can't figure out, from this, what /dev/ it's on...
2004-11-14T06:11:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	eruditus	are you following any sort of guide or how to?
2004-11-14T06:11:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	I wouldn't know where to find one...
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	I can give you the info from the device manager...
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	(not all of it, obviously... just tell me what you need.)
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	eruditus	there should be some doco for how to use gnome-ilot etc
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	I've been following the instructions, but they don't speak of anything similar... the help file is also fairly useless...
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	eruditus	what palm is it?
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	Tungsten E - seen as Tungsten T by the Device Manager
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	it is a usb interface. What's dmesg?
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	eruditus	run 'dmesg' on a terminal and it gives you kernel messages
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	may I msg you a section of the results?
2004-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	eruditus	HrdwrBoB	ok.
