2010-01-19T16:36:00.000Z	myzonez		Is there any particular advantage in using KDE over GNOME?
2010-01-19T16:36:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	Not really. Altough some like it more.
2010-01-19T16:38:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	oh thanks. And I want to upgrade my 9.04 to karmic koala.....and I want to use KDE. but I think I read somewhere that its recommended to update everything using the update manager and then go for the system upgrade. is it true?
2010-01-19T16:38:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	Well, yes, it is
2010-01-19T16:41:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	oh. So I guess i'll install KDE after the upgrade. But the peculiar thing is, I can't find 'KDE' in my synaptic manager...though I can use the apt-get stuff, I notice that a lot of things are missing...I was using ubuntu before and I had to format my computer....I installed this again from the very same cd. Any idea what's wrong? I think canonical withdrew the support for jaunty
2010-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	and Kubuntu is an entirely different thing? I mean I can'
2010-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	can I have gnome and Kde together? (although its not very useful to do so.)
2010-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	It's not different, it's the same except the fact that it uses KDE over GNOME. And yes, you can.
2010-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	and its better if u use either kde or gnome?
2010-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	and not both?
2010-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	Well, if you wanna save space, otherwise no
2010-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	And KDE stands for K development environment. And there's no way to run amarok on gnome?
2010-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	Why there is, just install it, it will also get some KDE libraries but it will run on GNOME just fine
2010-01-19T16:46:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	Thanks.....does KDE look better? :)
2010-01-19T16:47:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	Well, yes, it does a bit... altough GNOME+Compiz+Those awesome desktop effects is better then KDE
2010-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	well, compiz won't work on mine....no graphics card, and a really problematic VIA onboard
2010-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	Don't go with KDE then, it's quite... hungry on video cards
2010-01-19T16:49:00.000Z	myzonez	theadmin	Thank god u said that. My system would have crashed or something!!! Even the display goes crappy on Gnome sometimes...and the worst part is, there's no official drivers for my chipset....so its either Vesa or the openchrom drivers....and both doesn't support 3-d drawing
2010-01-19T16:52:00.000Z	theadmin	myzonez	KDE is way hungry actually... If you wanna something productive go with XFCE it's really fast. Altough, GNOME is medium and if it works fine, keep that
