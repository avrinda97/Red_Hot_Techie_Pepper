2009-03-21T16:16:00.000Z	Guest95427	dr_willis	i use NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver 177 [recommended]
2009-03-21T16:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	  if the driver works then you are 1/2 way there..  I would suggest backing  Up your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and trying that nvidia-settings tool
2009-03-21T16:19:00.000Z	Guest95427	dr_willis	backup done! still dont know how to run that tool
2009-03-21T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 type its name in a terminal
2009-03-21T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 if its installed..
2009-03-21T16:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 or it may have a menu item somewhere.. if its installed
2009-03-21T16:21:00.000Z	Guest95427	dr_willis	if that is not automatically installed with the driver, then its not...
2009-03-21T16:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 no idea.. check and see.. if its not installed then install it.
2009-03-21T16:23:00.000Z	Guest95427	dr_willis	NVIDIA X Server Settings?
2009-03-21T16:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 no idea.. TRY IT and see.
2009-03-21T16:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 im not in ubuntu so i cant hold your hand.. try the stuff.. you backed up the xorg.conf so you can easially undo anything that changes it.
2009-03-21T16:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest95427	 with the nvidia-settings tool You can easially enable the other monitors and twinview and confiogure/tweak things.. HOWEVER you may need to restart the X server. for all the changes to work properly with all programs.
