2005-07-25T05:47:00.000Z	desrt		vladuz976; you know, you can always just type "cd" on its own :)
2005-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	desrt		Burgundavia; that's extremely unlikely to actually happen
2005-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	desrt		vladuz976; :)
2005-07-25T05:49:00.000Z	desrt		Wahyudi; are you trying to compile a KDE program?
2005-07-25T05:50:00.000Z	desrt		is it not in apt?
2005-07-25T05:50:00.000Z	desrt		Wahyudi; you'll probably need a lot more than qt
2005-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	desrt		Wahyudi; a good place to start would probably be the kdelibs
2005-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	desrt		Wahyudi; try installing kdelibs4-dev
2005-07-25T05:53:00.000Z	desrt		Wahyudi; qt/kde are huge
2005-07-25T05:54:00.000Z	desrt		ColonelKernel; sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
2005-07-25T05:54:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	thanks
2005-07-25T05:55:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	theres a bunch of the english ones checked
2005-07-25T05:56:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	thank you
2005-07-25T05:57:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	thanks again :D
2005-07-26T16:00:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	im sorry but this just isnt true in my case. I force 100hz on 1024x768 all the time, im other distros and even in winXP
2005-07-26T16:00:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	ok - what can I use to get the thing to run @ 100hz
2005-07-26T16:02:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	I know if I increase hsync past 105 it goes insane
2005-07-26T16:04:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	I do not want to do it everytime though, this SHOULD be working with a Modeline
2005-07-26T16:05:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	desrt	will try, brb
