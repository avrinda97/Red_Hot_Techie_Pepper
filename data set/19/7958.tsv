2008-09-27T23:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	I suppose whatever the executable name is. You could also do it graphically if you wanted: File Browser->Edit->Preferences->Removable Media
2008-09-27T23:28:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	from the file browser?
2008-09-27T23:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	Just open your home directory or filesystem from the Places menu. That is the file browser (nautilus)
2008-09-27T23:30:00.000Z	hardcore	bobertdos	all i see is folders
2008-09-27T23:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	There should be an Edit menu at the top.
2008-09-27T23:32:00.000Z	hardcore	bobertdos	the only one i see is open movie player
2008-09-27T23:34:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	You don't see File, Edit, and so on?
2008-09-28T00:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	It's possible, but since no one's responding, I don't think any of us know for certain.
2008-09-28T01:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	You need to know your processor in order to know whether it's 32 or 64-bit. Most of the P4's are 32-bit, I believe.
2008-09-28T01:34:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	In fact, I can't think of a P4 that is 64-bit.
2008-09-28T01:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	danbh_intrepid is right. The only time 64-bit is necessary (right now) is if you have 4 gigs of RAM or greater.
2008-09-28T01:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	Evolution is kind of like Ubuntu's equivalent of OE, because it's so tightly integrated to the OS.
2008-09-28T01:42:00.000Z	hardcore	bobertdos	whats OE?
2008-09-28T01:43:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	Outlook Express :p
2008-09-28T01:44:00.000Z	hardcore	bobertdos	but doesn't that kind of lessen the value of linux when it comes to choice?
2008-09-28T01:44:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	Not really, there are always alternative to choose ;)
2008-10-02T02:03:00.000Z	bobertdos	hardcore	Installing from Sun's bin is kind of messy. They really don't give you thorough enough instructions for setting the appropriate environment variables, so we just recommend people stick to the repos.
