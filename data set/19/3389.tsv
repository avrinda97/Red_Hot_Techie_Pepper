2010-02-20T21:25:00.000Z	adalal		what does this mean: SIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot assign requested address
2010-02-20T21:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	malformed/invalid ip ?
2010-02-20T21:28:00.000Z	adalal	erUSUL	i just changed the interfaces file, and restarted the networking service, when those flags showed up
2010-02-20T21:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	post the interfaces file
2010-02-20T21:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	yes; i do not see anything too wrong with it ... i would use eth0 and eth0:1 as the two interfaces but other than that it looks sane
2010-02-20T21:33:00.000Z	adalal	erUSUL	i shall try that... other than that, i just have dhcp, dns server running, and one small change in the ip tables
2010-02-20T21:34:00.000Z	adalal	erUSUL	that did it, changing the eth0:0 to eth0 :D thanks!
2010-02-20T21:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	no problem
2010-07-01T22:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	what kernel ? compiled it yourself ?
2010-07-01T22:30:00.000Z	adalal	erUSUL	the repo one
2010-07-01T22:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	how did you installed fglrx ?
2010-07-01T22:31:00.000Z	adalal	erUSUL	can't remember, i think from the website or the repo.. but the broadcom wireless isn't working either
2010-07-01T22:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	you may have to reinstall fglrx... broadcom may be a regression. try installing linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic
2010-07-01T22:34:00.000Z	adalal	erUSUL	do you know where the change log is?
2010-07-01T22:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	what changelog ?
2010-07-01T22:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	not from the top of my head
2010-09-17T22:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	adalal	go to packages.ubuntu.com dwonload from there
