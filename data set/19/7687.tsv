2007-11-07T07:08:00.000Z	arang2		please guys help , i dont wanna reinstall ubuntu
2007-11-07T07:08:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	you changed your hardware configuration underneath an existing install, which now freezes?
2007-11-07T07:09:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	yes
2007-11-07T07:10:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	there is a solution other than reinstalling everything?
2007-11-07T07:10:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	have you tried booting into safe mode?
2007-11-07T07:10:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	yes once in safe mode it works
2007-11-07T07:11:00.000Z	arang2		mycroftiv:but i end having just a prompt
2007-11-07T07:12:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	so it sounds like it might just be your xorg settings when trying to start the xserver crashing the machine? did you change video cards?
2007-11-07T07:13:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	it should work though cos it's using the same video card from before and the same kernel
2007-11-07T07:14:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	i'm not sure how changing your motherboard might affect everything that your startup scripts do, but if you can boot in single user mode to a command prompt your system should be fixable
2007-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	i know what should i do_ please tell me
2007-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	from a boot into single user mode you can try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start    and see if that is where the system has trouble, because that should start your xserver from the command prompt
2007-11-07T07:17:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	ok i will try what if it freezes what do i do
2007-11-07T07:18:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	well, you might be able to get the terminal back with ctrl-alt-f2 which would tell you if its a hard lockup or just the xserver freezing.
2007-11-07T07:18:00.000Z	mycroftiv	arang2	and if it DOES freeze then we know that it IS the video startup taht is causing your issue
2007-11-07T07:18:00.000Z	arang2	mycroftiv	i'll give it a try
