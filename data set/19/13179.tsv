2005-05-06T05:58:00.000Z	qumran_		One problem i have in Ubuntu is permission based. I used expert installation mode, and now all the programs which need root access, ask for root password, says wrong password or just simply not even loading the program
2005-05-06T05:58:00.000Z	qumran_		i have to start those programs from a terminal in su
2005-05-06T05:59:00.000Z	qumran_		well, i have the correct root password, but the program doesn't get it
2005-05-06T05:59:00.000Z	qumran_		i already set a root pass
2005-05-06T05:59:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	what program?
2005-05-06T06:02:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	System -> Administration -> Users and groups, select your username and under properties make sure it has Executing System Administration Tasks checked
2005-05-06T06:04:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	i can't find it. It not under 'User privileges' :(
2005-05-06T06:05:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	in users and groups, click your username, then on the right there's Properties that will light up, when you open properites, it's the third tab
2005-05-06T06:06:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	it should be a list of check boxes such as access to cdrom drives, setup printers and more
2005-05-06T06:07:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	Yes, i found tthat ..... but the is not any Executing System Administration Tasks :(
2005-05-06T06:07:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	uh oh....
2005-05-06T06:07:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	uh oh ? that doesn't sound promising
2005-05-06T06:08:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	the 6th one down should be "Executing system administration tasks" and if it's not on the list, then you'll have problems using sudo to do things...
2005-05-06T06:08:00.000Z	thegreedyturtle	qumran_	and to actually get it there is a little beyond me atm, but I'll look into it real quick
2005-05-06T06:08:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	darn, is there a way to get it there?
2005-05-06T06:08:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	thanks man ;)
2005-05-06T06:10:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	i found it!
2005-05-06T06:11:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	"Under 'User priviledges' make sure 'Executing system administration tasks' is checked. If you don't have that option listed, add the admin group using the 'Users and Groups' tool and then trying adding your username to the group"
2005-05-06T06:11:00.000Z	qumran_	thegreedyturtle	thanks for the help ... i really appreciate it
