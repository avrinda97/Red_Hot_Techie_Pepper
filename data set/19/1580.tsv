2011-01-11T14:11:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	By the way, if I add it to .bashrc, wouldn't it run everytime I open bash?
2011-01-11T14:06:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	Whenever you download a package, it gets stored in /var/cache/apt. You can copy that page from there, and install it on the machine you want to.
2011-01-11T14:07:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	but will it download the arm-version on an x86 machine?
2011-01-11T14:09:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	as for your compiz - you could add a line to start compiz to .bashrc in your home/user/ folder - it will get executed after login...
2011-01-11T14:09:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	Sorry, I don't know about that. But, if you're using Synaptic, or aptitude to install packages, it will install those versions which are compatible with the current running machine i.e. if you're downloading from 64-bit, it will download 64-bit packages, and so wouldn't run on 32-bit. however, vice-versa is applicable very well.
2011-01-11T14:09:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	Thanks, I'll give that a shot.
2011-01-11T14:11:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	try this 'sudo iwconfig <interface_name> essid "ACCESSPOINT" key PASSWORD'
2011-01-11T14:12:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	erm... good question... i always add things i want done at login to .bashrc...
2011-01-11T14:13:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	I did added as a startup in init.d, but it don't work everytime (most of the time to be accurate)
2011-01-11T14:15:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	just make an experiment: add some trivial application to .bashrc and then open some terminals and see how often that app gets started... ;-)
2011-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	Okay! I'm always open to experiments. That's how I corrupted my last Ubuntu installation. LOL!
2011-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	that's why i said "trivial" application^^
2011-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	Sure thing!
2011-01-11T14:17:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	i tend to reinstall my OS after 6 months max - because by then i have usually wrecked it
2011-01-11T14:18:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	Well, that's how we learn things...BY MAKING MISTAKES.
2011-01-11T14:19:00.000Z	nicofs	h-dee	everytime i wreck my system, i laugh - and then reach out for the boot-cd...
2011-01-11T14:20:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	I'm actually new to Linux, so I'ven't wrecked it more than once, but yeah I was champ in corrupting Windows. LOL!
2011-01-11T14:22:00.000Z	h-dee	nicofs	GTG! ciao!
