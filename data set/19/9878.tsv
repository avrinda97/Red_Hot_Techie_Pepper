2006-11-29T14:19:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	Probably use the windows uninstaller that came with the program. If it doesn't have one, then I guess you just gotta delete it.
2006-11-29T14:19:00.000Z	natrix		sepero: if I delete it, is it stay on the bar of applications programs?
2006-11-29T14:20:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	I don't know. I've never used crossover. You installed the program with a MSwindows installer, right?
2006-11-29T14:21:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	(an exe program)
2006-11-29T14:21:00.000Z	natrix	Sepero	Yes, but when I am trying to use the unistall option of the program it crashes
2006-11-29T14:22:00.000Z	natrix		sepero: I also tried the same procedure from crossover but it gives me the same ...
2006-11-29T14:23:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	If it won't uninstall with it's uninstaller, then your only other option is deleting it.
2006-11-29T14:23:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	Basically, you'd have to do the same thing if you were actually running MSwindows
2006-11-29T14:24:00.000Z	natrix		sepero: I suppose I can delete it but I don't know if it has created any depedencies in the system, and if it remains as a dead link on the bar
2006-11-29T14:24:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	I'm certain it has no dependancies in your Ubuntu system. What bar do you refer to? The Gnome bar?
2006-11-29T14:25:00.000Z	natrix		sepero: I tried to find the application from the add/remove application from the Applications bar but I couldn't find it
2006-11-29T14:25:00.000Z	natrix		sepero: yes gnome
2006-11-29T14:26:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	You can also be able to delete it from your bar manually, but I don't use Gnome, so I'm not sure how.
2006-11-29T14:26:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	You can also  delete it from your bar manually, but I don't use Gnome, so I'm not sure how.
2006-11-29T14:27:00.000Z	natrix		sepero: I'll try it anyway as the last option, I just asked if there is a proper way to do this
2006-11-29T14:28:00.000Z	Sepero	natrix	no prob
