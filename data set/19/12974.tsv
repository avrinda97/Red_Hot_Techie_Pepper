2005-06-05T06:20:00.000Z	sebastian		I don't get sound when I play .avi movies in totem or VLC  can anyone help?
2005-06-05T06:21:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Check your mixer levels.. Are they all okay?
2005-06-05T06:22:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Right click on your volume control and Open Volume Control.
2005-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Are all the levels at 100%..?
2005-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Do you sound when you login to Ubuntu?
2005-06-05T06:25:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	So MP3 etc works?
2005-06-05T06:26:00.000Z	sebastian	podge	well I haven't tried mp3 yet, I just installed ubuntu for the first time yesterday =)
2005-06-05T06:27:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Can you listen to CDs? Give it a go..
2005-06-05T06:29:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Totem has a volume control.. Is that at 100%
2005-06-05T06:31:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	maybe.. Do you have a mp3 lying around.. ? Try playing mp3 on totem..
2005-06-05T06:32:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	or an ogg or wav...
2005-06-05T06:35:00.000Z	sebastian	podge	mp3s also work
2005-06-05T06:36:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Download the rest of the codecs by following the instructions that dankoposted earlier..
2005-06-05T06:37:00.000Z	podge	sebastian	Sound is working.. So you are halfway there..
