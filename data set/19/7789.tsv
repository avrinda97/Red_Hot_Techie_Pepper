2007-08-18T16:21:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	I'm assuming you want to hide all traces of your pr0n habits, so i'll start by suggesting you keep all your media files on an encrypted partition with an accompanied encrypted swap, you could easily add a kernel module to mount these encrypted filsystems on the fly for transparancy. Second, I suggest you edit your fstab so you can disable inode access times so the cops don't know your viewing habits, and then for fir
2007-08-18T16:22:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	I'm just kidding around. D:
2007-08-18T16:23:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	thats integrated graphics and will steal that memory from your system ram
2007-08-18T16:33:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	disable desktop effects
2007-08-18T16:33:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	desktop effects are mostly superfluous and not needed
2007-08-18T16:34:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	uhh, I'm not in ubuntu right now so I don't know click sequence off the top of my head, but I'm sure somone else does
2007-08-18T16:44:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	well
2007-08-18T16:45:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	if all else fails, then restart :<
2007-08-18T16:47:00.000Z	Olgem	richardjc	there were others ways we could have gone about it but lol restart
