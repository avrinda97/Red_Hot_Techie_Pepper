2005-04-25T16:51:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	my favourite :) yeah it'll work, done it personally many years ago!
2005-04-25T16:51:00.000Z	Reblended	whiteknight	what are the steps! =D
2005-04-25T16:51:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	gonna need ndiswrapper as suggested already by dazed
2005-04-25T16:52:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	gonna struggle on a live cd though
2005-04-25T16:52:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	i'm not even sure that the live cd has ndiswrapper included
2005-04-25T16:53:00.000Z	Reblended	whiteknight	I'd like to use the hoary install cd to partition this XP machine... I've been told to use partition magic, et al... is it possible with just the install cd?
2005-04-25T16:55:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	yeah like dazed says, though i wouldn't have a clue cause i use a ppc
2005-04-25T16:57:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	the files you are going to need are here
2005-04-25T16:57:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hoary/misc/ndiswrapper-utils
2005-04-25T16:58:00.000Z	Reblended	whiteknight	I'm gonna put it on my thumbdrive and give it a whirl =D
2005-04-25T16:58:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	also you are going to need your windows driver
2005-04-25T05:01:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	yeah, dpkg -i package
2005-04-25T05:02:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	as in package being ndiswrapper....
2005-04-25T05:02:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	yup, should be easy...
2005-04-25T05:03:00.000Z	whiteknight	Reblended	still trying to find a guide, no there is one
