2006-04-30T09:36:00.000Z	Plitskin		you guys have any idea about what I should be doing regarding my previous message?
2006-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	the text in caps refers to what the options are called when using the old config-way of doing it. you need to find these two items, and enable them
2006-04-30T09:38:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	eh, how have you planned on doing this, exactly?
2006-04-30T09:39:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	I'm still a little lost here... but thanks... @_@
2006-04-30T09:40:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	I'm just following an INSTALL text with the driver I downloaded...
2006-04-30T09:40:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	does it say the you need to recompile your kernel?
2006-04-30T09:41:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	yes, according to what you pasted, it does. that means downloading the kernel source code, building a new one, and booting off that
2006-04-30T09:41:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	I've never done anything like that before...
2006-04-30T09:42:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	I think this sets my limit with linux... If I could somehow accomplish this then I'm in a whole new level, I guess :D
2006-04-30T09:43:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	it can be quite strenous, yes. are you sure that the kernel you are using now doesnt support this? it its stock ubuntu, its got loads of stuff in it
2006-04-30T09:44:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	All I know is that I have a 2.6 kernel...
2006-04-30T09:44:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	try follow the rest of the text
2006-04-30T09:44:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	and we'll see the results
2006-04-30T09:45:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	Ok sir, I'll try to compile the source again...
2006-05-03T15:21:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	apt-get install openssh-server
2006-05-03T15:21:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	i guess you are after the server
2006-05-03T15:22:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	yes, then the server is your thing. you could also install an ftp server for easier access, but the ftp protocol is somewhat shaky
2006-05-03T15:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	Plitskin	ssh
2006-05-03T15:26:00.000Z	Plitskin	kingspawn	uhmmm.. thanks
