2006-11-28T08:42:00.000Z	kleinlappies		I just wanted to say that i have been running windows on top of ubuntu via vmware and it rocks. windows bit slow but more stable now. Hey i need windows for our filemaker db that is no windows. Just though i'd let everyone know that there is no need for a dual boot system.
2006-11-28T08:44:00.000Z	kleinlappies		how can i make Linneighbourhood start when ubuntu starts up. at the moment i have to boot linux and open Linneigh.
2006-11-28T08:46:00.000Z	kleinlappies		how to put a program in startup?
2006-11-28T08:46:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	system > preferences > session > startup
2006-11-28T08:47:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	thanks -- feel so stupid now
2006-11-28T08:47:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	np , every one was a beginner
2006-11-28T08:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	what exactly do you want ?
2006-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	i just want to up the performance
2006-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	are you using vmware now ?
2006-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	 yes, my windows is running on it. vmware is instaled on ubuntu
2006-11-28T09:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	doh,
2006-11-28T09:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	have you installed vmware tools ?
2006-11-28T09:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	you may also consider increasing memory usage of the relevant vm in the config
2006-11-28T09:06:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	yes did all that. i suppose im going to get myself another gig of ram (that will help) i have like 1 and a half gigs of ram.
2006-11-28T09:07:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	with 256 mb ram, windows looks fine on my vm
2006-11-28T09:08:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	i have given 400mb to my windows. there is nothing wrong with it just want it faster.
2006-11-28T09:09:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	do you maybe know why the win machine on vm will drop my network connection every now and again? taking a chance here
2006-11-28T09:09:00.000Z	reverseblade	kleinlappies	I have not much experience with vmware, all I can say, I am content with the default configuration
2006-11-28T09:10:00.000Z	kleinlappies	reverseblade	oh OK. I will look around a bit more and come back to post my findings. thaks agian
