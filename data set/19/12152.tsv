2006-01-15T16:15:00.000Z	iKernel		This better work this time, I have done CC=gcc3
2006-01-15T16:15:00.000Z	iKernel		AWW WHAT?!!?
2006-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	iKernel		oh wait... here's the problem
2006-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	iKernel		Unable to find the compiler specified in the CC environnment variable: "gcc3".
2006-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	iKernel		hmm
2006-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	iKernel		I'll try CC=gcc-3.4.5
2006-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	iKernel		hmm k
2006-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	iKernel		only gcc 4 there :(
2006-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	iKernel		this is gay, I've waited ages for this to compile
2006-01-15T16:18:00.000Z	Ng	iKernel	there's no need to be homophobic
2006-01-15T16:18:00.000Z	iKernel	Ng	What's homophobic?
2006-01-15T16:18:00.000Z	Ng	iKernel	"this is gay" - that's a really stupid insult
2006-01-15T16:19:00.000Z	iKernel	Ng	It wasn't an insult :)
2006-01-15T16:20:00.000Z	iKernel	Ng	ok
2006-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	Ng	iKernel	there's a package called linux-source-2.6.12
2006-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	iKernel	Ng	Ah k
2006-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	Ng	iKernel	or there's linux-tree-2.6.12 which also grabs the ubuntu patches
2006-01-15T16:32:00.000Z	iKernel	Ng	ok, which one is recommended?
2006-01-15T16:32:00.000Z	Ng	iKernel	probably linux-tree-2.6.12
