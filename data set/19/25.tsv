2004-11-05T13:09:00.000Z	Zotnix		I think (this might be wrong to do) I set a root password by sudo passwd
2004-11-05T13:09:00.000Z	Zotnix		I can now su into root just fine.
2004-11-05T13:10:00.000Z	Zotnix		I still do sudo now.
2004-11-05T13:10:00.000Z	Zotnix		I'm getting accustomed to sudo.
2004-11-05T13:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		Anyone know any good repositories that contain very current packages (namely gaim/firefox/blam type things)
2004-11-05T13:11:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	no, and we'd discourage them
2004-11-05T13:12:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	what you have is a fully supported distro with a rapid release process
2004-11-05T13:12:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	when hoary (the devel branch) opens up, you'll get all of those kinds of things, though you'll be running the devel release
2004-11-05T13:13:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	then you don't get the new packages :)
2004-11-05T13:14:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	you have a choice - supported or rapid response development. it's better to make the choice along those lines.
2005-02-14T11:41:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	lugradio? listen to the one with mark the week before mine
2005-02-14T11:43:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	listen to the one the week before
2005-02-14T11:43:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	so you came here because of those interviews?
2005-02-14T11:46:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	did you like the interviews?
2005-02-14T11:46:00.000Z	Zotnix	jdub	yep. It was interesting to hear them.
2005-02-14T11:50:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	(i probably didn't make it clear - that's me)
2005-02-14T11:51:00.000Z	Zotnix	jdub	Ah.. hehe. Wouldn't expect you here. :-p.
2005-02-14T11:51:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	why so? :)
2005-02-14T12:03:00.000Z	jdub	Zotnix	on its way
