2008-08-14T15:20:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	any idea why Intrepid doesn't have OOo3.0?
2008-08-14T15:21:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	You'd have to ask in #ubuntu+1
2008-08-14T15:22:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	thanks. Can you answer an xchat question?
2008-08-14T15:22:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	Just because it doesn't have it now doesn't mean it wont, although import deadline has passed.
2008-08-14T15:22:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	but they'll be able to tell you all about it in +1
2008-08-14T15:22:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	You'd have to ask the question :)
2008-08-14T15:27:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	I have mentioned it in #ubuntu+1 - it was one of Mark's planned features if I remember right. And it runs find for me on Hardy.
2008-08-14T15:27:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	I meant re: xchat
2008-08-14T15:28:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	do you know if there is a setting in xchat to stop all channels from recording join/part messages?
2008-08-14T15:28:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	I'm not sure about "recording" but if you mean displaying, yeah.
2008-08-14T15:28:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	I can only do it one channel at a time and the setting is reset when I restart xchat.
2008-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	I don't want any of those messages in the chat window, for all channels, ever.
2008-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	/set irc_conf_mode 1
2008-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	I believe that should persist, but I can't tell you for sure.
2008-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	is that a preference I'm telling the server directly?
2008-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	No, thats an xchat setting
2008-08-14T15:30:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	i'll try it and let you know. thanks
2008-08-14T15:33:00.000Z	duncan_busy	Flannel	that didn't work. I'm still seeing the notifications...
2008-08-14T15:34:00.000Z	Flannel	duncan_busy	http://t0x.in/xchathidejoinpart.html  might be able to give you other options.  Ive never actually used Xchat
