2008-03-21T01:02:00.000Z	corinne_		I'm having the same problem as ricko12345, but with w32codecs
2008-03-21T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	did you read what ubotu sent you?
2008-03-21T01:03:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	A-HA!  I will try that, thank you! :D
2008-03-21T01:05:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	wow, this is complicated...
2008-03-21T01:06:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	really?  What are you reading exactly?
2008-03-21T01:07:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	wait, I think I've got it.  http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl/dists/gutsy-seveas/
2008-03-21T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	yes, that is one way
2008-03-21T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	but the wiki page has the instructions for actually using it
2008-03-21T01:10:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	I'm not sure what to do on this page.
2008-03-21T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	link me to the page you are reading (ubotu made 2 different suggestions)
2008-03-21T01:11:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
2008-03-21T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	use medibuntu, the instructions are probably easier to follow: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2008-03-21T01:13:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	"Resolving www.medibuntu.org... failed: Name or service not known."
2008-03-21T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	you need to give me context.  What did you do to receive that error?
2008-03-21T01:13:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	I wrote "sudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/gutsy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list"
2008-03-21T01:14:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	is your comuter connected to the internet?  Can you visit http://www.medibuntu.org in a browser on that computer?
2008-03-21T01:15:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	yes, which is why I'm a bit confused
2008-03-21T01:22:00.000Z	corinne_	jrib	WHOA.  I just tried the exact same thing again and it worked this tim e
2008-03-21T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	corinne_	good
