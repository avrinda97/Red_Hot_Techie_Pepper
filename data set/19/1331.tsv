2011-12-25T17:30:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	were you at one point attempting to solve this with xinput?
2011-12-25T17:30:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	i was but left it midway as it seemed complicated
2011-12-25T17:36:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	have you had any promising results with other avenues?
2011-12-25T17:39:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	what other avenues?
2011-12-25T17:40:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	well you're obviously trying to solve it with other options yes?
2011-12-25T17:40:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	i've tried installing a bunch of apps, none had scrolling option and tried chnging values in imwheel, that didnt help too
2011-12-25T17:42:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	are you using touchpad or mouse?
2011-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	usb optical mouse
2011-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	i think all your efforts will be in vain since it's hardcoded in gnome : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/124440/comments/26
2011-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	even my friends are bummed by this scrolling issue... how come it's not been fixed till now...
2011-12-25T17:47:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	it's a gnome problem. for example if you used kde instead, you'd find an option in the settings to edit this property easily.
2011-12-25T17:48:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	do i ned shift to kubuntu for this :P
2011-12-25T17:48:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	it's up to you, but I wouldn't just for this.
2011-12-25T17:48:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	are you using gnome-shell ?
2011-12-25T17:49:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	this is irritating... but i cant switch the OS for this
2011-12-25T17:49:00.000Z	airtonix	ssk_the_gr8	it's not about switching operating systems...
2011-12-25T17:49:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	i know it's just the DE
2011-12-25T17:53:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	airtonix	it's 9 year old bug.. OMG!
