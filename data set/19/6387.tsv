2008-03-29T12:32:00.000Z	maxownz		is there a quick fix for my 'sudo' to have stopped working?
2008-03-29T12:32:00.000Z	maxownz		permission denied across the board
2008-03-29T12:33:00.000Z	tritium	maxownz	you're using your user's password?
2008-03-29T12:33:00.000Z	maxownz	tritium	the dialog box to ask for the password doesn't even come up
2008-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	tritium	maxownz	what about for cli stuff?
2008-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	maxownz		it does

2008-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	maxownz		on the command line it's permission denied
2008-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	tritium	maxownz	you're sure your user is in the admin group?
2008-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	maxownz		yep, tritium
2008-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	maxownz		more /etc/group right?

2008-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	tritium	maxownz	if it's the first user you created, it has sudo priveleges (admin group) by default
