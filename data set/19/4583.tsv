2009-01-02T00:00:00.000Z	dmole		anyone want to tray and make ubuntu mount a hard drive?  just like this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/302960
2009-01-02T00:02:00.000Z	dmole		ubuntu 2.6.24-22-generic works fine but 2.6.27-11-generic will not mount the drive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2009-01-02T00:04:00.000Z	dmole		please someone must know what is stopping the new ubuntu from mounting drives
2009-01-02T00:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	Are those ntfs or fat32 partitions you are trying to mount
2009-01-02T00:08:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	I shreded and tried all kinds of partition tables
2009-01-02T00:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	People using ubuntu seldom have issues mounting partitions
2009-01-02T00:10:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	I know and like i said it works fine on one box but not on the other
2009-01-02T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	I assume it is an external and ubuntu is the os on both systems
2009-01-02T00:11:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	yes
2009-01-02T00:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	what does sudo fdisk -l show
2009-01-02T00:12:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	only sda* not sdb* on the new box
2009-01-02T00:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	I assume this is a usb external
2009-01-02T00:13:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	yes usb external
2009-01-02T00:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	If it's a USB device, run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' to see what the system does when you plug the device in
2009-01-02T00:15:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	same as the dmesg
2009-01-02T00:15:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	same as the link
2009-01-02T00:24:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	any thoughts on mounting problems?
2009-01-02T00:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dmole	nope, still trying to get some work done
2009-01-02T00:29:00.000Z	dmole	Jack_Sparrow	ok thanks for the time I'll downgrade for now :(
