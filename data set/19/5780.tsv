2008-05-02T11:40:00.000Z	TooFly		Hello! I'm very new and have a question regarding installing Ubuntu. I have both an on-board graphics card, as well as a PCI-express card, and I am having trouble beginning the installation from CD.
2008-05-02T11:41:00.000Z	TooFly		Anyone know what I'm supposed to do?
2008-05-02T11:41:00.000Z	TooFly		I begin the install, and the computer reboots and goes black.
2008-05-02T11:41:00.000Z	TooFly		It looks like my monitor is cycling between analog and digital trying to get a signal.
2008-05-02T11:42:00.000Z	TooFly		Yes, it does. I select install from the menu.
2008-05-02T11:43:00.000Z	TooFly		I tried "install in safe graphics mode" as well, and it does the same thing.
2008-05-02T11:43:00.000Z	TooFly		It loads the kernel, and the screen goes black
2008-05-02T11:43:00.000Z	TooFly		And stays black :(
2008-05-02T11:43:00.000Z	TooFly		yes
2008-05-02T11:43:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	do u figure it finished loading?
2008-05-02T11:44:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	is this a live cd.....or a hdd install?
2008-05-02T11:45:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	hmm
2008-05-02T11:47:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	disable onboard video
2008-05-02T11:47:00.000Z	TooFly	Rabiddog	is this done in BIOS?
2008-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	TooFly	Rabiddog	it was a cpu/mobo deal from Fry's on black friday!
2008-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	just because its cheap don't mean its a great deal :P
2008-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	TooFly	Rabiddog	I am starting to agree.
2008-05-02T12:15:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	gigabyte has a key combo that enables advanced features, although I doubt ECS does that
2008-05-02T12:17:00.000Z	Rabiddog	TooFly	not a issue nowadays really
