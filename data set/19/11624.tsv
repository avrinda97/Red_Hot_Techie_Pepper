2005-12-19T13:37:00.000Z	hawk`		ok i just want to add my user to the admin group again, where do i do this?
2005-12-19T13:37:00.000Z	hawk`		:P
2005-12-19T13:38:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	system->administration->users and groups
2005-12-19T13:39:00.000Z	hawk`	psusi	can't i just edit some textfile?
2005-12-19T13:39:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	sure... you can edit /etc/groups if you want
2005-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	why don't you just use the gui like I sugested first?  easiest way
2005-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	hawk`	psusi	becuase it still doesn't work from my livecd
2005-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	why are you booting from a livecd?
2005-12-19T13:48:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	boot from the hard drive in rescue mode isntead of the livecd... that will give you a root shell... then use usermod to add your user to the various groups
2005-12-19T13:48:00.000Z	hawk`	psusi	already tried that
2005-12-19T13:49:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	why is root disabled?  you disabled it?
2005-12-19T13:49:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	so when you boot into rescue mode, what happens?
2005-12-19T13:50:00.000Z	hawk`	psusi	it wont work, trust me
2005-12-19T13:50:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	unless you did something weird, it will
2005-12-19T13:50:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	and if not... then add init=/bin/bash to the kernel command line and you'll boot to a root shell
2005-12-19T13:51:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	rescue mode has nothing to do with sudo... it doesn't start the gui but just drops you to a root shell
2005-12-19T13:56:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	it's the gid of the group
2005-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	hawk`	psusi	that's what i thought, where can i find the gid of admin?
2005-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	psusi	hawk`	my admin group is gid: 106
