2008-09-09T21:49:00.000Z	mrthraz		lilo tries to boot but the text gets as far as lil_
2008-09-09T21:49:00.000Z	shey	mrthraz	you sure you are using Ubuntu?
2008-09-09T21:49:00.000Z	mrthraz		yes
2008-09-09T21:49:00.000Z	mrthraz		 i am
2008-09-09T21:50:00.000Z	shey		UbuntuStudio uses Lilo?
2008-09-09T21:51:00.000Z	mrthraz		if you use xfs you have no choose
2008-09-09T21:51:00.000Z	shey		hrmmm
2008-09-09T21:51:00.000Z	shey	mrthraz	the secondary hdd has anything on it?
2008-09-09T21:51:00.000Z	shey		ie: another OS?
2008-09-09T21:52:00.000Z	mrthraz		used g parted to strip it , i put ntfs as the file sys
2008-09-09T21:53:00.000Z	mrthraz		no other os on it
2008-09-09T21:53:00.000Z	shey	mrthraz	I had issues with my secondary at one time, although removing it and putting it as USB, then stripping it solved that issu for me, then I added it back into my laptop, but then again am using Grub.
2008-09-09T21:54:00.000Z	shey	mrthraz	Although I dont see why that would hang Lilo. Let me do some research on this. Hang tight.
2008-09-09T21:57:00.000Z	shey	mrthraz	this page might give you some ideas as to whats wrong ... http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LILO_fails:_Error_messages_and_their_interpretation
2008-09-09T21:57:00.000Z	mrthraz		i guess i should mention that my bios sees both drives but does not alow me to set one or the other as master , boot options only ask if i want net work, hdd, or or cd to boot and in what order
2008-09-09T21:58:00.000Z	mrthraz		thanks shey :)
2008-09-09T22:00:00.000Z	shey	mrthraz	also, see if the hdd's themselves can be set master/slave via jumper
2008-09-09T22:14:00.000Z	mrthraz	shey	there does appear to be a jumper on the drive, on to of the first four prongs, though no markings on what would be the slave position. i'll just fool around with it and see if i get it right. man i feel stupid. thanks for pointing me in the right direction
