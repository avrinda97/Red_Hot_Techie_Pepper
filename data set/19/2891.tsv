2010-02-04T22:26:00.000Z	howlymowly		my brain works like a snail
2010-02-04T22:26:00.000Z	howlymowly		thx IdleOne anyway :)
2010-02-04T22:26:00.000Z	IdleOne		sure thing
2010-02-04T22:32:00.000Z	howlymowly		ok.. IdleOne that worked... thx...  do you know whether there is a "generic" way to get a new ".profile" file in my home dirctory, since I accidentally deleted mine doesn't seem to be replaced by ubuntu though (I wonder if I need it then, anyway, because my .bashrc is still working...) its just that my ~/bin directory stopped working since then..  the path directory usually gets updated by the .profile i guess...
2010-02-04T22:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	howlymowly	no idea
