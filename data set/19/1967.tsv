2010-12-28T04:56:00.000Z	plundra		Any one experienced a HP Proliant DL320G5 having problem with the network?
2010-12-28T04:56:00.000Z	plundra		eth0 just died a few hours ago, reboot wont fix it.
2010-12-28T04:56:00.000Z	plundra		The traffic-counter just keeps growing about 4GB per second...
2010-12-28T04:56:00.000Z	Diamondcite	plundra	is the network card still detected?
2010-12-28T04:56:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	Yes.
2010-12-28T04:57:00.000Z	Diamondcite	plundra	ifconfig -a    (does this show it?)
2010-12-28T04:57:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	YEs, both of them.
2010-12-28T04:58:00.000Z	Diamondcite	plundra	So how is it dead?
2010-12-28T04:58:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	No traffic going in or out.
2010-12-28T04:58:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	No routes.
2010-12-28T04:58:00.000Z	Diamondcite	plundra	You have 2 network cards?
2010-12-28T04:58:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	Yes it has, it's a DL320G5
2010-12-28T04:59:00.000Z	Diamondcite	plundra	There is a chance that eth0 and eth1 physically changed places, please swap the cable and check ^_^
2010-12-28T05:00:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	No, it's nothing like that. I did try the other interace aswell.
2010-12-28T05:00:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	I get errors from tg3 when rebooting, for exampl.e
2010-12-28T05:01:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	Something seems to be very broken :-) I'll move the pbx to another machine for now, and look at this later on.
2010-12-28T05:02:00.000Z	Diamondcite	plundra	Well I'm clueless for now.. Since you claim the cards didn't swap ids with each other ^_^
2010-12-28T05:03:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	This must be a hardware problem, either from the nic it self or some other part of the hardware.
2010-12-28T05:03:00.000Z	plundra	Diamondcite	Thanks for your interest though!
