2005-12-13T08:29:00.000Z	flodine		whats the command for kubutnu to be installed
2005-12-13T08:29:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
2005-12-27T17:24:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	on my box "locate xinitrc" gives /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
2005-12-27T17:26:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	can i edit it to start a program on boot
2005-12-27T17:27:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	on boot?  you could add it to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh - i guess xinitrc is for when X starts up
2005-12-27T17:29:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	that bootmisc looks crazy where do i put it top or bottom
2005-12-27T17:29:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	at the bottom
2005-12-27T17:30:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	but above ": exit 0" :)
2005-12-27T17:30:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	i just want to add xset fp to start my font
2005-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	in ~/.bashrc there is a section that begins with a comment like "# If this is an xterm ...", you could try adding your xset command in there
2005-12-27T17:35:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	aterm
2005-12-27T17:35:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	what does "echo $TERM" output when you're in your terminal?
2005-12-27T17:38:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	not sure how do i find out
2005-12-27T17:38:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	open a terminal and type   echo $TERM
2005-12-27T17:39:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	rxvt
2005-12-27T17:40:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	then that should be OK because the code in .bashrc says "case "$TERM" in xterm*|rxvt*)"
2005-12-27T17:42:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	i think this will work, there might be better ways but i don't know them sorry
2005-12-27T17:44:00.000Z	flodine	bimberi	thxs  for the help
2005-12-27T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	flodine	np :)
