2007-08-03T09:10:00.000Z	DWSR		I'm following the documentation and I've run intoa problem.

2007-08-03T09:13:00.000Z	DWSR		Can someone help me install ndiswrapper? I've run into a problem and I'm following the documentation located at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper.
2007-08-03T09:14:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	 what problem did you run into ?
2007-08-03T09:14:00.000Z	DWSR	Pelo	When I load the module (sudo depmod -a && sudo modprobe ndiswrapper), it doesn't load.
2007-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	DWSR	Pelo	my tail /var/log/messages is here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32312/
2007-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	 I assume you have installed ndiswrapper ? and the other file that comes with it ?
2007-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	DWSR	Pelo	I've been following the documentation in the wiki.
2007-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	 I'm just doing some general trouble shooting here, I'm nto familiar enough with ndiswrapper to get into specifics
2007-08-03T09:16:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	did you at any point install either a ndiswrapper***.deb file or compile one from source ?
2007-08-03T09:17:00.000Z	DWSR	Pelo	installed them out of the repos.
2007-08-03T09:18:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	 ok , then the only thing i (personnaly) can suggest at thispoint it to check your spelling in that command,  or ask again periodicaly for someone else to helpyou , it would help you to state the specific problem when you ask , ie the modprobe issue
2007-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	look it up in synaptic, always the best place,  but it might not be in the repos, you might hve to dl it
2007-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	DWSR	Pelo	Even Synaptic can't help with spelling mistakes. :-)
2007-08-03T10:43:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	yes it does
2007-08-03T10:53:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	 maybe you should ask in #xubuntu
2007-08-03T10:53:00.000Z	DWSR	Pelo	Heh, I could, but I'm here already, and I don't think it's THAT big of a deal.
2007-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	Pelo	DWSR	 I was just thinking that ppl who use xubuntu might be more likely to know
