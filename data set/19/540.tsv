2012-01-04T02:38:00.000Z	LupusSLE		As far as I'm aware, the RAID itself is fine. It's a software RAID_1, it's just grub having issues with it it would seem...
2012-01-04T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	Try changing the boot order in your BIOS. That error means that the grub mbr+core.img loaded by the BIOS doesn't match the modules in /boot/grub/, which means that one (/boot/grub/) was updated without updating the other. Hopefully your other drive's mbr+emdedded area was updated and you will then be able to boot.
2012-01-04T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	Once booted, run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" and make sure that *both* drives are selected as install devices so that this doesn't happen again.
2012-01-04T02:41:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Theoretically... could this be a problem if I'm using an older version of grub on the livecd than is on natty?
2012-01-04T02:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	No.
2012-01-04T02:43:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Thanks... I *think* I know how to do that... I'll get back to you in a moment
2012-01-04T02:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	The difference is between the mbr+embedded area and the modules in /boot/grub/. A command like "grub-install /dev/sda" will ensure that the modules in /boot/grub/ match the mbr and embedded area of /dev/sda, but might leave an outdated mbr+embedded area in /dev/sdb for instance.
2012-01-04T02:47:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Booting into recovery mode from CD, do I want to activate RAID during recovery?
2012-01-04T02:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	If you want to try to recover that way, yes. But I told you to try changing the boot order in the BIOS first. Either way should work as long as you get to where you can run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" from your installed system. So whichever is easiest for you.
2012-01-04T03:00:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Odd... can't seem to mount /dev/sdb1 in recovery...
2012-01-04T03:00:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Reckon that's normal or is my disk buggered?#
2012-01-04T03:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	If /dev/sdb1 is only one member of your raid array then you shouldn't be trying to mount it.
2012-01-04T03:01:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Of course... I'm being silly
2012-01-04T03:04:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Ack... I tried changing the HDD boot order but I'm running into the exact same error.
2012-01-04T03:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	What was the output from grub-install each time (if it's more than one line use http://pastebin.ubuntu.com ).
2012-01-04T03:06:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Just said it was succesful... no errors returned.
2012-01-04T03:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LupusSLE	Do you have any other drives in this computer? (SD cards and other things *do* count)
2012-01-04T03:08:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Other than the optical disc drive I'm running the recovery from... not a thing.
2012-01-04T03:19:00.000Z	LupusSLE	Jordan_U	Cheers for the help... not managed to solve it but I've lost the will to try
