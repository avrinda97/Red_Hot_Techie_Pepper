2010-04-03T03:50:00.000Z	Lomi		Anyone else having issues with esound suddenly deciding to chomp the fuck out of all your CPU
2010-04-03T03:51:00.000Z	Lomi		 Yeah sorry, blubbtec, my bad - it _is_ pulse
2010-04-03T03:51:00.000Z	Lomi		I just read esound of the titlebar of something else
2010-04-03T03:53:00.000Z	Lomi		So let me rephrase. Does anyone have issues with >>pulseaudio<< suddenly deciding to eat all your CPU. And the only way to settle things down is to kill pid
2010-04-03T03:55:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	if you get ubuntu 9.10 karmic i have a solution for you
2010-04-03T03:57:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	installing a fixed version of alsa-plugins should fix your problem
2010-04-03T03:58:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	that is, either a backport from lucid, or i give you the one i used to fix my problem
2010-04-03T03:58:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	hm pulse is dependant on alsa in that regard?
2010-04-03T03:58:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	well if you wouldn't mind, sure.
2010-04-03T03:58:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	yeah i'll see if i can get you the bugreport link
2010-04-03T03:59:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-plugins/+bug/485488
2010-04-03T03:59:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	cheers I'll check it out
2010-04-03T04:00:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	https://launchpad.net/~diwic/+archive/ppa this is the alsa-plugins posted in the bugreport, which i'm using
2010-04-03T04:01:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	so it's a buffer issue resulting from the change?
2010-04-03T04:02:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	uff, i'm actually not sure what causes the bug internally, but it's some miscommunication between alsa and pulse caused by some bugs in the karmic-alsa version
2010-04-03T04:02:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	so just get update?
2010-04-03T04:02:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	or go change the aperture aswell?
2010-04-03T04:03:00.000Z	BlubbTec	Lomi	all I did was downloading the alsa-plugins in that ppa
2010-04-03T04:03:00.000Z	Lomi	BlubbTec	alright man, I'll have a look.
