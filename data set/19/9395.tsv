2007-03-09T15:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	nautilus
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	Do you have desktop icons now that nautilus is running?
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	ardchoille	i have no icons on my desktop, except for the two panels
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	nautilus manages the desktop (icons, wallpaper, etc) if it doesn't run, then your desktop will be blank.
2007-03-09T15:18:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	ardchoille	it still didn't do anything
2007-03-09T15:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	you're going to have to figure out why nautilus won't run.
2007-03-09T15:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	ALT+F2, type: gnome-terminal   and run nautilus from the term and see if there is any error output
2007-03-09T15:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	that's not gonna help then, I was hoping it would,
2007-03-09T15:21:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	ardchoille	 wait, it says "couldn't get a file descriptor referrring to the console
2007-04-09T12:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	abasinisvacant	April 19th
2007-04-09T12:43:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	ardchoille	ok thanks
