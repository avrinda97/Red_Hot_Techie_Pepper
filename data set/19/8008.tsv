2007-06-23T11:46:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	hi
2007-06-23T11:47:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	can you help me?
2007-06-23T11:47:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	what's up
2007-06-23T11:47:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	My wireless craps out while downloading via bittorrent
2007-06-23T11:48:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	I posted some dmesg stuff on the thread
2007-06-23T11:48:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	how about other than bittorent.
2007-06-23T11:48:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	It works pretty well besides that, but I really need bittorrent for some things
2007-06-23T11:49:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	It's pretty much the only reason I dual boot...
2007-06-23T11:49:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	sorry.  sounds like u got a reliable wireless wich is GREAT.  problem is with bittorent
2007-06-23T11:50:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	No, not the problem, works fine in windows
2007-06-23T11:50:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	wirelss works in ubuntu?
2007-06-23T11:50:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	Pretty much
2007-06-23T11:50:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	also, there a couple fo torrent options for ubuntu.  I'd try the alternatives
2007-06-23T11:51:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	search on synatpic
2007-06-23T11:51:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	I don't think it's the client, I've tried Deluge, BitComet, Azerus, and the official client
2007-06-23T11:52:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	cactusbin	sorry.  u've done the things i would try.  over my head
2007-06-23T11:52:00.000Z	cactusbin	MISTERTibbs	OK, thanks anyway man
