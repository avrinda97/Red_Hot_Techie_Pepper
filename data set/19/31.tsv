2012-11-29T21:42:00.000Z	aMERICA		when i boot to ubuntu i get a blank screen with just a flashing cursor, then the computer becomes unresponsive
2012-11-29T21:44:00.000Z	aMERICA		i assume it was a video driver issue, but after removing and installing 3 diff driver versions, i still get the same blank screen and flashing cursor
2012-11-29T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	what GPU do you use
2012-11-29T21:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	add the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
2012-11-29T21:52:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	just did that, same result
2012-11-29T21:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	do you use a switchable video chip?
2012-11-29T21:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	sweet, try:  nomodeset
2012-11-29T21:59:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	same result
2012-11-29T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	if you hold SHIFT at boot, can you select recovery mode, then selet root. You can remove the driver there etc
2012-11-29T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	also run:  sudo apt-get clean
2012-11-29T22:06:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	i can get to the recovery console
2012-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	run:  dpkg -l | grep nvidia | grep -v nvidia-common       remove the packages listed :)
2012-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	shutdown and hibernate are different
2012-11-29T22:08:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	shutting down win8 and rebooting to ubuntu, ubuntu can't mount the partition
2012-11-29T22:13:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	i just apt-get removed all the nvidia driver packages, i still have cuda installed though, rebooted and i can login now, screen resolution is jacked,
2012-11-29T22:13:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	which drivers should i reinstall? current, current-updates, or experimental
2012-11-29T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aMERICA	current should do it
2012-11-29T22:21:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	just reinstalled nvidia-current, and back to the same issue
2012-11-29T22:33:00.000Z	aMERICA	ActionParsnip	i got it working, thanks for the help, i wound up uninstalling all distribution packages relating to nvidia, and running the nvidia installer
