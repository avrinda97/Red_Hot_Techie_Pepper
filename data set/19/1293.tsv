2011-03-08T17:26:00.000Z	jdenholm		Hey guys. I think I might have accidentally blanked my $PATH variable: Full console dump and explanation here for readability's sake: http://paste.ubuntu.com/577436/
2011-03-08T17:27:00.000Z	jdenholm		Any help would not only be appreciated, but may also prevent heart attack.
2011-03-08T17:27:00.000Z	jdenholm		You're kidding me...
2011-03-08T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	get rid of the . in /etc/profile too
2011-03-08T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	yeah, unless that's really what you want...?
2011-03-08T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	no it wasn't
2011-03-08T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	yeah, that's likely not what you want.
2011-03-08T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	standard place to do this is /etc/environment, not /etc/profile
2011-03-08T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	yes
2011-03-08T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	on ubuntu, that's where the PATH is set.  What you have done will work, but just use /etc/environment
2011-03-08T17:31:00.000Z	jdenholm	jrib	Ah, I see. Thanks - I was wondering why there was no PATH in profile. Is this a recent change?
2011-03-08T17:31:00.000Z	jdenholm	jrib	Or a change at all?
2011-03-08T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	yeah, it was introduced at some point.  Can't remember exactly when, but probably around 8.04
2011-03-08T17:32:00.000Z	jdenholm	jrib	Yeah, that'd be it. Lookin' at old posts and stuff.
2011-03-08T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	you should figure out what's putting that ./usr/local/bin in your path
2011-03-08T17:34:00.000Z	jdenholm	jrib	Yeah, I'll check it in a few days and Whoooooah.
2011-03-08T17:51:00.000Z	jdenholm	jrib	Found the problem. It was actually Nautilus Elementary not inheriting the $PATH variable. Of course, I now learn that the project is dead and that they've moved on to greater things.
2011-03-08T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	jdenholm	hmm
2011-03-08T17:52:00.000Z	jdenholm	jrib	I guess that's a good bit of trivia if someone else as silly as myself comes running this way.
