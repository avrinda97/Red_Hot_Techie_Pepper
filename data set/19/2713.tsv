2010-02-23T05:20:00.000Z	magn3ts		Anyone using the Nvidia 195 driver?
2010-02-23T05:20:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	yes
2010-02-23T05:21:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	do you manually have to do a CTRL+ALT+F7 every time you boot?
2010-02-23T05:21:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	no
2010-02-23T05:21:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	:[
2010-02-23T05:22:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	however, it does seem to have issues
2010-02-23T05:22:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	can you elaborate... I am as well
2010-02-23T05:22:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	ubuntu doesn't boot up clean every time, and I'm not sure if it's the nvidia opengl driver or not
2010-02-23T05:22:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	i suspect it's probably the driver
2010-02-23T05:22:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	grrr, exact problem I'm having
2010-02-23T05:23:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	gah, I even meant 190 too and its supposed to be stable. 195 only booted properly 1/5 times maybe :[
2010-02-23T05:23:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	i.e. sometimes it boots up with a black screen, and I go to Alt-F8(?...memory's sketchy), and I get a garbled screen that looks like ascii graphics
2010-02-23T05:23:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	it works for me about 4 out of every 5 times
2010-02-23T05:23:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	weird. weird weird
2010-02-23T05:24:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	however, I'm trying 183 now
2010-02-23T05:24:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	or 187(?)
2010-02-23T05:24:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	I just started using ubuntu last week (got thrown into it with a new job i started)
2010-02-23T05:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	dlynes	190 is *okay* (I think my other problem is with awn-trunk) but sometimes the TTY/Virtual consoles aren't working and I always have to switch to tty7 manually to get to X.
2010-02-23T05:25:00.000Z	dlynes	magn3ts	but whatever it does, the machine's so comopletely locked up, I can't even ctrl-alt-del it
