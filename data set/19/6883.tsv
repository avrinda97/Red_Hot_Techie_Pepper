2008-06-14T22:31:00.000Z	puccio		hello,I'm using Hardy and I have problem with the dreaded iw3945 driver
2008-06-14T22:32:00.000Z	bazhang_	puccio	what is the issue
2008-06-14T22:32:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	I was using the ipw3945 of the 2.6.22 kernel up to now, but it seems that recently network-manager don't not make me connect anymore.
2008-06-14T22:32:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	because indeed with the 2.6.24 series my wifi interface was not working at all in network manager
2008-06-14T22:33:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	so my basic question is which configuration do I have to use to re-make it work, it would not be an issue to use an older kernel just that network manager does not work anymore....
2008-06-14T22:33:00.000Z	bazhang_	puccio	what about from the terminal what does ifconfig show two entries or three

2008-06-14T22:34:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	iwconfing lists my network interface
2008-06-14T22:34:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	the network-manager lists it too, but it does not list any essid in it
2008-06-14T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang_	puccio	let me get you a link
2008-06-14T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang_		http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=571188 puccio try this
2008-06-14T22:35:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	if I do iwlist eth1 scan on the terminal, it lists me the networks it find..
2008-06-14T22:36:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	thanks. so back to 90's with no graphical network manager, that's it? :-)
2008-06-14T22:37:00.000Z	bazhang_	puccio	well if its not working with network manager; just a suggestion :)
2008-06-14T22:37:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	ok... :-)
2008-06-14T22:38:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	so can we say that if my iwlist eth1 scan shows networks around me, I can be confident to manually configure it properly or are there technical issues which could prevent it?
2008-06-14T22:38:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	like wap/wep whatever support
2008-06-14T22:39:00.000Z	bazhang_	puccio	well the network manager *should* work; but if it does not that is a nice workaround
2008-06-14T22:39:00.000Z	puccio	bazhang_	ok thanks
