2010-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	eryc		any recommendations on upgrading Ubuntu 6.10?
2010-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	6.10 is from october of 2006... ?
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	eryc	edbian	most likely
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	most likely?  It def is.  That's how the version numbers work.  If you really are running 6.10 you need to clean install 8.04 or newer
2010-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	No offense but how the heck did you end up in this situation?  Have you not used this computer in 4 years?
2010-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	eryc	edbian	yep
2010-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	Well yeah, windows 98 isn't supported anymore either.  Maybe you should abandon all of windows.
2010-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	Is it really that hard to upgrade your system once every 3 years?
2010-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	There ya go!  Debian :)
2010-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	eryc	edbian	:)
2010-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	eryc	hey hey, ubuntu contributes upstream
