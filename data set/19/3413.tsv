2012-02-08T07:10:00.000Z	javier_		Hi, my laptop (ubuntu 11.10) is making problems: booting windows 7 or ubuntu takes 20-30 minutes and it's slow and unstable when working. Now I booted from ubuntu live USB, and it works well. Does it tell someone something about where can be the problem. I think is hardware problem, but don't know where... any ideas?
2012-02-08T07:11:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	i'd guess hard drive, pastebin the result of this - "sudo fdisk -l"
2012-02-08T07:13:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	if you pasted anything, i didn't see it
2012-02-08T07:13:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	http://pastebin.com/Gse2FhKe I'm afraid it's in spanish... don't know if you will guess what means, but I can tell you if you ask. Thanks
2012-02-08T07:14:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	or, how to get it in spanish
2012-02-08T07:15:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	what is the 16GB drive?
2012-02-08T07:16:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	now pastebin this - "sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sdb"
2012-02-08T07:16:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	ah... I see. I'm in ubuntu live cd, and that's my usb information. So, it's not useful for us
2012-02-08T07:16:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	I mean, ubuntu live usb+
2012-02-08T07:17:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	it will be useful
2012-02-08T07:18:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	but, as I said, here on ubuntu live usb it works well, but if I boot from my hard drive ubuntu or windows, is when I find the problem. So, we would need to test hard drive to detect the prblem
2012-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	but if you pastebin this - "sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sdb" it will show the hard drive speed, which i'm thinking the problem is

2012-02-08T07:22:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	yep, you need a new hard drive
2012-02-08T07:22:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	Ops... where do you see it?
2012-02-08T07:24:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	compare your speed to mine, http://pastebin.com/QBRAc0ZA
2012-02-08T07:26:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	yes, I see. But I repeated the command in terminal and it changes all the time the speed. For example, now it reported: http://pastebin.com/cQz89gHw
2012-02-08T07:27:00.000Z	Ben64	javier_	it should be consistent. that first time with the KB/s speed is very bad. hard drive needs to be replaced
2012-02-08T07:28:00.000Z	javier_	Ben64	ok. Actually, I believe that is the problem. With that speed it will be a hard work to save all the data I have there...
