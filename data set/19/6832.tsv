2008-02-24T22:15:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		I use gmplayer and Totem to play DVDs. The thing is that when playing a DVD with gmplayer, it reaches a moment that freezes and the DVD unit seems to be reading something (the light blinks), but nothing happens. And with Totem with one DVD (Pink Floyd The Wall) it wouldn't even start playing.
2008-02-24T22:15:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		It happens with another DVD that Totem freezes within the firts 20 minutes of playing, blinking the DVD unit led.
2008-02-24T22:15:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		I don't know what is happening.
2008-02-24T22:15:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		Any idea?
2008-02-24T22:15:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	have you tried using mplayer or vlc?
2008-02-24T22:15:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	I use mplayer
2008-02-24T22:16:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	you just said you were using totem, invoke the dvd from the terminal
2008-02-24T22:16:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	how?
2008-02-24T22:17:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	mplayer <file location/name>
2008-02-24T22:18:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	and sudobash, since it plays for a while and then freezes, keeps reading from dvd unit and then after a while (almost a minute) it keeps on playing I was thinking in something related with buffering. may it be?
2008-02-24T22:19:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	weird, but i've given up using mplayer with the totem crap over it, i invoke everything from the terminal now
2008-02-24T22:21:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	and it does it with both? have you installed all the proper codec's ect (i'm assuming since you can play it for the most part but hey)
2008-02-24T22:21:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	yes I have
2008-02-24T22:21:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	and it happens with both
2008-02-24T22:21:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	welp, have you tried VLC, everyone else seems to love it
2008-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	sudobash, It seems to work fine with vlc
2008-02-24T22:36:00.000Z	lex	Dex-Freudii	suppose that's why everyone likes it
2008-02-24T22:43:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	sudobash, It didn't work correctly either
2008-02-24T22:43:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	lex	sudobash, It keeps on freezing
