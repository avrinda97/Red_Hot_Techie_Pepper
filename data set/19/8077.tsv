2011-04-28T15:57:00.000Z	curt		What do I have to do to transfer files from an ext3 files system to an ext4 file system - my 9.04 installation tells me that it does not support ext4
2011-04-28T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	curt	upgrade your ubuntu version, 9.04 isn't supported anymore
2011-04-28T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	curt	did you see what I told you?
2011-04-28T16:02:00.000Z	curt	jrib	yes but I'm planning on wiping that drive for Natty, right now I just want to back up the files on the Meerkat install - I have never upgraded since Warty, always a clean install -
2011-04-28T16:03:00.000Z	curt	jrib	are you saying there is no way to back up to ext4 file system
2011-04-28T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	curt	use a live cd, that's probably the easiest way for you.  You could even do it with your desktop install cd
2011-04-28T16:04:00.000Z	curt	jrib	are you talking about an upgrade?
2011-04-28T16:05:00.000Z	jrib	curt	no
2011-04-28T16:05:00.000Z	jrib	curt	you can access and copy your data when you boot from the desktop cd (it's a live cd so you run the OS right from the cd)
2011-04-28T16:06:00.000Z	curt	jrib	ok... I was thinking maybe something like tune2fs (or whatever it;s called might help out... no?
2011-04-28T16:06:00.000Z	curt	jrib	OK ... I was thinking maybe something like tune2fs might help... no?
2011-04-28T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	curt	well if you're saying 9.04 can't access ext4 (which is weird because you should just be able to mount it as ext2), then the easiest thing for you to do is just use the desktop cd
2011-04-28T16:07:00.000Z	curt	jrib	thanks, I'll give it a shot... unless... if I boot to the new Meerkat, might I be able to move those files from the 9.04, rather than the other way ;round (which didn't work)
2011-04-28T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	curt	yes, if you already have meerkat installed on a separate partition, that would work too.
2011-04-28T16:12:00.000Z	jrib	curt	should be fine.  Upgrades have always worked well for me.  But you should have backups just in case
2011-04-28T16:13:00.000Z	curt	jrib	always makes me a bit too nervous to attempt - I'll have to get another 2TB drive and make an exact copy before trying it... just to be safe
2011-04-28T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	curt	lots of unofficial repositories will decrease your likelihood of a smooth experience
2011-04-28T16:16:00.000Z	curt	jrib	ahh.. obvious but I hadn't thought of that
2011-04-28T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	curt	yeah, really it will only matter if you use repositories that affect core packages.   Otherwise, everything should be okay (check release notes of course)
