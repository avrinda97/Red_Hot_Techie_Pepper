2009-01-22T15:42:00.000Z	dubi		hello can anyone help me with IceWm? I need to start icewmbg before i start icewm. but i don't know how to make this happen. thanks
2009-01-22T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	try icewmbg; icewm
2009-01-22T15:43:00.000Z	dubi	ActionParsnip	i usually login and see the ubuntu log in sign - so i type my username then password then it's already inside icewm.
2009-01-22T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	is icewm not an option in gdm / kdm?
2009-01-22T15:45:00.000Z	dubi	ActionParsnip	sorry for noob question
2009-01-22T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	you need to ad the line in startsimple.sh before the icewm line

2009-01-22T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	its how i give back for a free OS
2009-01-22T17:23:00.000Z	dubi	ActionParsnip	I wish I could contribute something too, but I am no good at these stuff
2009-01-22T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	you'll learn and youmay even help me one day
2009-01-22T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	no one user knows everything but together all the users can solve any issue
2009-01-22T17:24:00.000Z	dubi	ActionParsnip	 i like this ubuntu community thing, pretty awesome
2009-01-22T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	windows has it a little bit too but not so much
2009-01-22T17:26:00.000Z	dubi	ActionParsnip	i beg to differ - in windows you have to PAY for these things
2009-01-22T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	ask in ##windows, its free
2009-01-22T17:27:00.000Z	dubi	ActionParsnip	but i dont use windows anymore ;) ubuntu rocks!
2009-01-22T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dubi	i dont use my system much so i just chat and browse which ubuntu can do just fine
