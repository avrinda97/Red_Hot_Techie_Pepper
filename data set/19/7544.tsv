2008-05-07T20:46:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	when u paste, include the line u typed as well
2008-05-07T20:50:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	correct command would be 'sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/disk'
2008-05-07T20:51:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	that returned mount: mount point /mnt/disk does not exist
2008-05-07T20:51:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	i am sorry,use the path you were previously using, or else create that directory
2008-05-07T22:31:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	you there?
2008-05-07T22:31:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	hey remember my issue earlier? I read somewhere to try to use gnome partition manager to get it going... any ideas?
2008-05-07T22:32:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	i never really knew your full issue
2008-05-07T22:32:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	I could not get my drive to mount
2008-05-07T22:33:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	give me some details, what type of drive, what error, how did it come about etc
2008-05-07T22:33:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	internal ide, approx 30GB, ext3 filesys.
2008-05-07T22:34:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	have you tried to use the gnome disk mounter to do it
2008-05-07T22:35:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	error, http://pastebin.com/m19ba65b5
2008-05-07T22:36:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	looks like a serious filesystem error, you could try an fsck, but... if it is feasible, I would suggest a reinstall perhaps
2008-05-07T22:37:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	could we check/repair from partition manager?
2008-05-07T22:37:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	you can from livecd, or try UBCD
2008-05-07T22:39:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	I want to avoid reformating as best as possible. I got somebody to assist me in getting it set JUST RIGHT, with a compiled kernel and programs that have been finely tweaked, lotta hours put into this box that I know VERY VERY little about compared to ya'll guru's
2008-05-07T22:39:00.000Z	ejer	Travo	get your expert back
2008-05-07T22:45:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	IT MOUNTED (sorry for caps)
2008-05-07T22:48:00.000Z	Travo	ejer	hd just needed to be repaired in gnome partitioner. All is well i'm booted into OS
