2007-04-08T08:32:00.000Z	Zenerek		so any ideas what i should look for in the dmesg output as being the reason my serial modem can connect in the live cd but not my install?
2007-04-08T08:33:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	compare the two files and look for differences in the "ttySX" lines
2007-04-08T08:33:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	X stands for a port number
2007-04-08T08:40:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	i checked and the ports match, i forgot to say that there are two modems on this pc, i am using the winmodem right now, i think maybe it might have somthing to do with that?
2007-04-08T08:41:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	so your hardware is recognized in exactly the same way in your hdd install and from the livecd?
2007-04-08T08:44:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	what do you mean? for the serial modem i did not have to do much just do mome minor stuff, the winmodem needed i got to work with a driver install
2007-04-08T08:46:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	maybe i don't understand your problem right. i was under the impression that your modem works right from your hdd install and does not work from the live cd. or the other way around. and that you suspected it is not properly detected
2007-04-08T08:49:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	 it works from the live cd but will not work from the install
2007-04-08T08:50:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	and the hardware (both modems) are recognized in exactly the same way?
2007-04-08T08:51:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	 could you expalin what you mean?
2007-04-08T08:53:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	in the files someone suggested you to look at you can see which hardware gets recognized by the kernel. ttyS0, ttyS1 are the names linux uses for serial ports. my question is if both times they get recognized in the same way
2007-04-08T08:54:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	i still can't understand what the problem is and what you do differently in both cases
2007-04-08T08:57:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	 yes they have the exact info, and diffrence is that i had already installed the driver for the winmodem
2007-04-08T08:59:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	and after installing this driver the other modem stopped working?
2007-04-08T09:00:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	i did not have the serial modem when i installed the driver, and that is why i wonder if it has something to do with that
2007-04-08T09:04:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	another thing is that the live cd uses kernel 2.6.15-23, the install uses kernel 2.6.15-28, i thiught this could be a prob but changed kernel's at boot to try the serial and it still did not work, so i don't think it's the kernel
2007-04-08T09:06:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	sorry. i'm out of ideas
2007-04-08T09:11:00.000Z	Zenerek	velko	that's ok man, i've learned that modems are pain to work with, i spent two weeks getting my winmodem to work, which i am running under the older kernel because the driver won't work with the new kernel, even though i compiled a new one
2007-04-08T09:12:00.000Z	velko	Zenerek	i'm happy that it works now for you (anyhow) :-)
