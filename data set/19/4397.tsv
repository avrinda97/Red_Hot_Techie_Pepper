2009-07-22T07:57:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	legend2440	I did check out that site but dual-head seemed to completely screw me up. I didn't have any panels but both screens were working. I couldn't do anything. I'm thinking it was a resolution problem but I don't know what happened
2009-07-22T07:59:00.000Z	legend2440	RocketLauncher	yes i remember ati dual monitor being tricky to get right. i now have nvidia so its been a while since i had dual monitors with ati
2009-07-22T08:00:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	legend2440	Damn so you dont really remember what to do? :(
