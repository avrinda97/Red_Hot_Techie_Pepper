2007-05-22T10:17:00.000Z	newbie001		Ok, nothing on gconf-editor
2007-05-22T10:17:00.000Z	newbie001		Any other idea?
2007-05-22T10:18:00.000Z	newbie001		Anyone knows how to edit the application that opens a file?
2007-05-22T10:19:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	right-click, select Properties, select the Open with... tab
2007-05-22T10:20:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	that allows me to add or remove aplications. But I want to edit a personalized application I have already set.
2007-05-22T10:21:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	I'm not sure what you mean -- can you rephrase?
2007-05-22T10:22:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	 Ok, I have set mplayer with some custom parameters as the application that opens avi files...
2007-05-22T10:23:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	 I want to change some parameters now.
2007-05-22T10:24:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	so you go to the Open With tab as described and select "Custom command".
2007-05-22T10:27:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	that allows me to add a new command, but I want to edit an existing command.
2007-05-22T10:29:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	so add the correct command and remove the old one afterwards.
2007-05-22T10:30:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	yes, the problem is I don't remember the old parameters, I want to keep them. I was looking for a way to at least read what the old command was. I only know it is mplayer, but I don't know the parameters
2007-05-22T10:32:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	perhaps you'll find it if you search with this command in terminal (cd ~ first if you aren't already there): 'for i in .g* ; do grep -r $i mplayer ; done'
2007-05-22T10:33:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	sorry, got it the wrong way round
2007-05-22T10:34:00.000Z	soundray	newbie001	for i in .g* ; do grep -r mplayer $i ; done
2007-05-22T10:35:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	that's a good one. I tried it but didn't work
2007-05-22T10:37:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	found something now... seraching everything
2007-05-22T10:39:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	thank you!
2007-05-22T10:40:00.000Z	newbie001	soundray	good bye!
