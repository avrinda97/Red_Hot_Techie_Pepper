2007-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	yeah, we've been trying to housetrain ubotu for a while now, but he's a resiliant little creature
2007-07-27T06:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	, lietu: let's just calm down and start thinking of kittens and mountain tops, please :)
2007-07-27T07:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	?.. i'm calm. mind your own biz
2007-08-01T16:25:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	well maybe he prefers having conversations to learn something than reading. i know i do
2007-08-01T16:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	maybe, but the channel topic is fairly clear.. SUPPORT
2007-08-01T16:26:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	yeah, you're right there. and the speed the screen sometimes scrolls by is pretty ridiculous anyway
2007-08-01T16:57:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	i use it but only because i like trying out different distributions and i don't have a second hard drive
2007-08-01T16:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	i guess in that sense, it makes sense
2007-08-01T05:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	lol, he wasn't using enter, he was using paste..lol
2007-08-01T05:07:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	oh, okay :)
2007-08-01T05:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	i didn't know he'd stopped and went to gparted.
2007-08-01T05:22:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	oh, he's using the gparted live cd or something?
2007-08-01T05:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	he installed gparted, and i think he was on it, now he's going back to the installer.. i think
2007-08-01T05:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	IndyGunFreak	well, as long as he backed up his important files before hand...
2007-08-01T05:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	i told him twice...lol
2007-08-01T05:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	howlingmadhowi1	i agree, except i don't think it will be subtle..lol
