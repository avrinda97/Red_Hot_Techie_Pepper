2008-04-07T16:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	What problem are you having?
2008-04-07T16:07:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	I can't hear any sound.
2008-04-07T16:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	Could you do a uname -r ?
2008-04-07T16:08:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	What is an uname -r?
2008-04-07T16:10:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	Yes.
2008-04-07T16:10:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	It started suddenly.
2008-04-07T16:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	did it start while you had ubuntu loaded up, or did you reboot and it stopped working?
2008-04-07T16:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	if you open up a terminal, then use aplay to try and play a file, it should give you an error message.
2008-04-07T16:15:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	How do I play an audio file using aplay?
2008-04-07T16:17:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	It seems to work. No error message. It seems silly. It seems I left the audio mute, but I didn't.
2008-04-07T16:17:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	Yes.
2008-04-07T16:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	launch gnome-volume-control, either from terminal or Alt + F2
2008-04-07T16:18:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	Ok.
2008-04-07T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	Then go to edit > preferences. Select anything that you think might have to do with audio output, including PCM
2008-04-07T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	have you ruled out a hardware problem, yeah? Your speakers are powered up, and all the cables are properly in?
2008-04-07T16:20:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	Of course. I told you that from the Live CD it works.
2008-04-07T16:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	okay, good point
2008-04-07T16:22:00.000Z	francesco_	Stormx2	What are the 30 subdevices that I see when I type aplay -l?
2008-04-07T16:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	francesco_	I've no idea. I only have two.
