2006-11-25T16:04:00.000Z	we2by		I have this smb mount issue
2006-11-25T16:04:00.000Z	we2by		it works fine the first time mounting a smb
2006-11-25T16:04:00.000Z	we2by		but if I leave my pc on for a few hours and come back, it can't connect any more
2006-11-25T16:04:00.000Z	we2by		or I have to restart nautilus
2006-11-25T16:05:00.000Z	maxxism	we2by	are the smb mounts on a windows system?
2006-11-25T16:05:00.000Z	we2by		maxkelley, nope. Ubuntu
2006-11-25T16:05:00.000Z	we2by		it is samba
2006-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	maxxism	we2by	use NFS then.  much better
2006-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	we2by		both systems are running Ubuntu
2006-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	we2by	maxxism	?? what is nfs? how do I set it up?
2006-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	maxxism		NFS is the unix varitant of SMB.  but waaaaay better
2006-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	we2by		!nfs
2006-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	we2by	maxxism	but sometimes I have to use windows xp.
2006-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	maxxism	we2by	 ok then.
2006-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	maxxism		so nautilus crashes with your smb mounts?
2006-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	we2by		yea
2006-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	we2by		maxkelley, can I run samba and NFS on the same machine?
2006-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	maxxism	we2by	can you read your logs on the problem?
2006-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	maxxism	we2by	yes I run both on mine.
