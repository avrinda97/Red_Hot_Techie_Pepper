2009-07-30T19:08:00.000Z	Viliny	BFevola	mainly because if you don't get any answers it's most likely because nobody active at that moment knows the answer. If you wait a bit the people might have changed and you have better luck in getting an answe. My 2 cents
2009-07-30T19:08:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	thank you. English is not my native language and I have never been present upon this IRC network before.
2009-07-30T19:09:00.000Z	Viliny	BFevola	your English is interesting though :)
2009-07-30T19:10:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	I use a combination of a translator I have written myself and rapid Googling of words I have not included in my program.
2009-07-30T19:10:00.000Z	Viliny	BFevola	could have fooled me to be honest.
2009-07-30T19:19:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	you probably wouldn't like it. But you could go the route of using something like fluxbox in lieu of gnome or KDE
2009-07-30T19:19:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	fluxbox is very light weight
2009-07-30T19:21:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	no, you just choose a window manager
2009-07-30T19:21:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	gnome IS a window manager
2009-07-30T19:25:00.000Z	Viliny	BFevola	i keep an open mind when it comes to different OS'es, i dislike both windows and mac but i don't bash them or act like an elitist either. Most of my experience with software comes from the windows side and im only recently taking up linux by the means of ubuntu and quite frankly loving it.
2009-07-30T19:26:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	there is nothing wrong with either operating system you have mentioned. In fact, Mac OSX on Intel hardware is official UNIX and a very good OS. My comment was disparaging of gnome and KDE, not Windows.
2009-07-30T19:27:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	your Linux experience would be greatly enhanced by using fluxbox over gnome or KDE> The learning curve would be higher at first, but the rewards would eventually be much greater.
2009-07-30T19:28:00.000Z	Viliny	BFevola	ill stick to the fixing what is broken. Gnome will suffice as it is now. Thanks for taking the interest to try and introduce new things but im fine for now.
2009-07-30T19:28:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	then let it be on your own head
2009-07-30T19:35:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	not permanent. And easy to try out
2009-07-30T19:35:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2009-07-30T19:35:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	then you can choose with gdm (or *dm) which wm loads
2009-07-30T19:42:00.000Z	Viliny	BFevola	would you be able to have a quick private chat about setting up fluxbox?
2009-07-30T19:42:00.000Z	BFevola	Viliny	just after I try to help theregoesmyeye
