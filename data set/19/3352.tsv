2009-09-04T12:45:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	try going to windows
2009-09-04T12:45:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	then windows key + r
2009-09-04T12:45:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	type in msconfig
2009-09-04T12:46:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	then check to see the boot order. Move Ubuntu Up... if its not there, then u mustve wiped your ubuntu drive
2009-09-04T12:48:00.000Z	Win	RichiV	k i;m looking under msconfig's boot.ini tab in XP..im not seeing anthing regarding ubuntu. also I couldnt have wiped the drive because I reinstalled Ubuntu...and  still cant see it in boot up options lol
2009-09-04T12:51:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	Then there is most likely a problem with your grub
2009-09-04T12:57:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	Try not to use external boot managers
2009-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	best thing to use is the one already implemented cause its best used for that certain OS service package and such
2009-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	Win	RichiV	ya I thought so.
2009-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	just a tip, but b4 getting deeper into Ubuntu, learn a bit about command prompt, and regedit
2009-09-04T13:04:00.000Z	RichiV	Win	u figured your problem out?
2009-09-04T13:07:00.000Z	Win	RichiV	I think HoN has linux client
2009-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	Win	RichiV	check this out...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Newerth ...definitly linux client :D
