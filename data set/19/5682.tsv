2009-07-09T23:03:00.000Z	sportman1280		hello:  subversion will not install from the ubuntu servers.  i was wondering if this was a known problem, or more isolated
2009-07-09T23:05:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	What error are you getting?
2009-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	Package subversion is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2009-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	Alright, please pastebin the output of `sudo apt-get update`
2009-07-09T23:08:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	pastebin wont accept it. labels it spam
2009-07-09T23:08:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	Meh.  paste.ubuntu.com will work, that factoid got long
2009-07-09T23:09:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu.com/213801/
2009-07-09T23:10:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	alright, this all looks good.  Please pastebin the output of apt-cache policy subversion
2009-07-09T23:11:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	theres a hardy line in there for some reason? "Hardy/main"
2009-07-09T23:12:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	Yeah, there is.  You should probably clean up your sources.list, but that line won't cause a problem
2009-07-09T23:12:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	its not in my sources.list?
2009-07-09T23:12:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	lol
2009-07-09T23:12:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	check in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
2009-07-09T23:13:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	but again, won't cause problems now.  What about that apt-cache policy subversion?
2009-07-09T23:14:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/213807/
2009-07-09T23:14:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	alright, that says that it should be available.  Does sudo apt-get install subversion still give you an erro?
2009-07-09T23:16:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/213808/
2009-07-09T23:16:00.000Z	Flannel	sportman1280	Odd indeed.  Unfortunately I have to run now.  Someone else should be able to help.  I've never seen that before.  Try cleaning up your sources.list (including .d) and see if that helps?
2009-07-09T23:18:00.000Z	sportman1280	Flannel	 thank you :)
