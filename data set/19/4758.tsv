2009-01-22T05:00:00.000Z	uzair		Hey all, I was trying to install Windows AFTER installing Linux, but was having problems. Can anyone help out?
2009-01-22T05:01:00.000Z	uzair		unfortunately, i've been using linux for a while and backing up all files, clearing the drive then reinstalling is a real pain :(
2009-01-22T05:01:00.000Z	uzair		is there no way otherwise?
2009-01-22T05:02:00.000Z	uzair		not too worried about the mbr, i've already replaced that once. problem is that windows keeps thinking logical partitions are primaries and doesn't want to install otherwise
2009-01-22T05:03:00.000Z	uzair		is there anyway to hide those partitions from windows? or perhaps just format an empty partition to ntfs and then let windows installer go from there
2009-01-22T05:04:00.000Z	step21	uzair	hiding works with some commercial software at least, not sure if parted supports it
2009-01-22T05:05:00.000Z	uzair	step21	what if i format through parted before i go to install anything? can we just "skip" the partitioning step w/ windows?
2009-01-22T05:05:00.000Z	uzair	step21	format empty space to ntfs
2009-01-22T05:05:00.000Z	step21	uzair	no, you have to tell windows at least where to install
2009-01-22T05:05:00.000Z	uzair	step21	yeah, that's fine, but it shouldn't complain then should it since it has a ntfs partition to work with?
2009-01-22T05:06:00.000Z	uzair	step21	i just don't get why windows doesn't see the partitions as extended/logical
2009-01-22T05:06:00.000Z	step21	uzair	what does it say again?
2009-01-22T05:07:00.000Z	step21	uzair	dreamweaver is epic fail btw ... just saying
2009-01-22T05:07:00.000Z	uzair	step21	says there are too many partitions and then won't format
2009-01-22T05:10:00.000Z	step21	uzair	then maybe all are primary and the parition utility fucked up? or some corruption? any way to check / fix part tables?
2009-01-22T05:11:00.000Z	uzair	step21	i did that once already with a utility called testdisk
2009-01-22T05:13:00.000Z	step21	uzair	back up everything, next time make sure your partition utility works nicer?
2009-01-22T05:13:00.000Z	step21	uzair	what do you want to do with DW?
2009-01-22T05:14:00.000Z	step21	uzair	srsly?
