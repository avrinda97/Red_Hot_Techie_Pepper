2011-03-10T10:45:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	right
2011-03-10T10:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	I'd specifically like the output of parted -l as it uses the same libraries as used by the Ubuntu installer. But looking again it's not actually following the symptoms of a problem with the partition table. For the entire disk not being listed the problem is often with left over raid metadata.
2011-03-10T10:51:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	I've done it
2011-03-10T10:52:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	http://digilander.libero.it/maxath/diocane.txt
2011-03-10T10:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	I see no problems there. Was this drive ever part of an array?
2011-03-10T10:56:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	what you mean for "array", in this specific case? I've only one hard disk, subdivided in four partitions
2011-03-10T10:59:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	what you mean for "array", in this specific case? I've only one hard disk, subdivided in five partitions
2011-03-10T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	The only reason that I know of for Ubuntu's installer to ignore a drive is when that drive appears to be part of an array whose type the installer does not understand.
2011-03-10T11:04:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	if you mean array of partitions, well I just have three ntfs, one ext4, one swap, and the Windows 7's installation manager too doesn't see the hard disk
2011-03-10T11:04:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	but GpartEd does, that's what I can't explain.
2011-03-10T11:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	No, you don't currently have an array, but this disk may have previously been part of one, or there may be some other reason that something that looks like raid metadata might be on the drive.
2011-03-10T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	Try booting with the "nodmraid" kernel parameter. To do that press any key within the first 5 seconds of boot and press F6 to get a menu of options, check the nodmraid option.
2011-03-10T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	No, not serious at all (if this is what's happening).
2011-03-10T11:06:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	I just have the live cd
2011-03-10T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	I am referring to the LiveCD boot.
2011-03-10T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	If that is what was causing the problem then the installer should now show the disk.
2011-03-10T11:19:00.000Z	mechanist	Jordan_U	no way, same issue than before: in the partition dialog of the installation manager nothing comes out
2011-03-10T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mechanist	Very odd. Could you submit a bug report?
