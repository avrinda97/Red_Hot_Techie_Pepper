2009-07-14T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	do you see ssid's if you run: sudo iwconfig scan
2009-07-14T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	just because no one replys does not give you warrant to start bugging with "hello"
2009-07-14T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	we help or free here so we do our best, simply ask then wait a while, then re-ask
2009-07-14T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	ok can you use pastebin to provide the output of:
2009-07-14T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	sudo lshw -C network
2009-07-14T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	then run:  sudo lshw -C neywork > ~/output.txt
2009-07-14T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	and copy the file to usb
2009-07-14T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	i don't need that line, i want what the chip is
2009-07-14T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	use a wired connection until you get on your feet
2009-07-14T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	its way easier
2009-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	ok great now you have something to search for
2009-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	It's a RTL8101E chip
2009-07-14T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zomation	something like a websearch of     RTL8101E ubuntu     should give good results
