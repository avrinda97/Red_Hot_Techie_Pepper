2008-08-14T02:45:00.000Z	katakaio		What's the problem Storrgie?
2008-08-14T02:46:00.000Z	Storrgie	katakaio	I did a fresh install of 8.08, I have a Abit ip35pro XW board with intel HDA sound, but I had my plantronics headset plugged in during the install... I changed the default audio over to asla, so it would play out of my Intel HDA, but it kept playing through the headset...
2008-08-14T02:47:00.000Z	Storrgie	katakaio	so i unplugged the headset, and now i get system sounds, but none of my programs are playing through Intel HDA
2008-08-14T02:47:00.000Z	Storrgie	katakaio	like vlc
2008-08-14T02:47:00.000Z	katakaio		Hmm, I've had this problem myself
2008-08-14T02:47:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	I spent days trying to find fixes, but I had no sound
2008-08-14T02:48:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	What eventually did it for me was installing the GNOME Alsa Mixer
2008-08-14T02:48:00.000Z	Storrgie	katakaio	what did u end up doing?
2008-08-14T02:48:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	just by installing it (not even tweaking settings) I got my sound to work
2008-08-14T02:48:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	the Intel HDA cards are a little funny like that
2008-08-14T02:49:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	try installing the gnome-alsamixer package and see if it works
2008-08-14T02:49:00.000Z	Storrgie		just nabbed it with synapt
2008-08-14T02:51:00.000Z	Storrgie	katakaio	still no sound after running it... vlc seems to be the only program that is stuck
2008-08-14T02:51:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	Hmm, so you get sounds with other programs (rhythmbox, etc.) but just not VLC?
2008-08-14T02:52:00.000Z	Storrgie		with gstreamer yes
2008-08-14T02:52:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	Well, I don't know what to do from here . . . sorry
2008-08-14T02:52:00.000Z	Storrgie		rythmbox also
2008-08-14T02:52:00.000Z	Storrgie	katakaio	think a restart? lol
2008-08-14T02:52:00.000Z	katakaio	Storrgie	Haha - it never hurt!
