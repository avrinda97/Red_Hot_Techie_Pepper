2011-04-04T01:53:00.000Z	Space_Cadet		Hello room :) I am running an update on a new Ubtunu 10.10 install and it keeps hanging at configuring linux-image-2.6.35-22-generic. In the update box it says Generating grub.cfg..............it has been that way for 30 minutes. Suggestions please?
2011-04-04T01:55:00.000Z	Space_Cadet		prag: how long could it take? My laptop install was super fast.....and it is way slower than the pc I am installing it on. Dual Core 3gb ram.
2011-04-04T01:55:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	generating grub.cfg should take a few seconds
2011-04-04T02:28:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	do you really need to boot to CLI or just access it?
2011-04-04T02:30:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	Ihachre typo'd mean to respond to you. :)
2011-04-04T02:31:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	you can add that option manually each time while booting grub
2011-04-04T02:31:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	to get into a useable system where you can edit it
2011-04-04T02:32:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	when grub shows up counting down, hit e and add nomodeset at the end ofthe line
2011-04-04T02:32:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	do I still hold shift to get to that part?
2011-04-04T02:32:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	then enter once or twice to start booting
2011-04-04T02:32:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	and it will have the kernel parameter set for that one boot
2011-04-04T02:32:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	ahh ok many thanks
2011-04-04T02:33:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	np :)
2011-04-04T03:11:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	I did a reinstall of the OS and ran updates from cli instead of wubi, finished without error! :)
2011-04-04T03:11:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	grats! ;)
2011-04-04T03:12:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	lol ty :P
2011-04-04T03:20:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	whats the syntax to install any updates? sudo apt-get ?
2011-04-04T03:21:00.000Z	hachre	Space_Cadet	sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-04-04T03:22:00.000Z	Space_Cadet	hachre	ty.......turns out it didn't upgrade kernal on last upgrade. hoping this isn't the part that hangs.
