2011-07-15T09:05:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		have an Ubuntu server, copied it's id_rsa.pub to my Debian server's authorized_keys, I can ping the box from Ubuntu --> Debian box but I can't ssh, it times out.
2011-07-15T09:06:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		yup
2011-07-15T09:06:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		it can ping, access it via http, etc.
2011-07-15T09:06:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		just timesout on ssh
2011-07-15T09:07:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		happen to know where the block list is by chance?
2011-07-15T09:07:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		k
2011-07-15T09:07:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		ill try that, thanks
2011-07-15T09:07:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	ssh is port22
2011-07-15T09:14:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	port 22 needs to be opened in the firewall.. ssh uses port 22
2011-07-15T09:14:00.000Z	Captainkrtek	yagoo	im using a different port, trust me that is not the issue
2011-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	Captainkrtek	yagoo	Im using ssh -p portnumber
2011-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	so..?
2011-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	what number u using?
2011-07-15T09:16:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	probably a NAT issue
2011-07-15T09:17:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	is this client not ssh'ing properly in the same 192.x.x.x network?
2011-07-15T09:17:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	so it's probably ur NAT box not allowing that port forwarding in
2011-07-15T09:18:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	that's more complicating to fix
2011-07-15T09:18:00.000Z	yagoo	Captainkrtek	ur ssh server needs to be on a fixed internal address
