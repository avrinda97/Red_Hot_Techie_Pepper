2011-04-10T09:04:00.000Z	hylian		I am trying to seperate the truth from the hype and am having a hard time at it. Is unity going to replace gnome on Ubuntu? and If it is, can someone point me to another OS, because Unity sucks?
2011-04-10T09:04:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	heh hey so what makes unity suck so much
2011-04-10T09:05:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	a) I cannot change the theme b) buttons forced to left side, where they don't belong c) exceptionally buggy d) I am a gnome fan..:)
2011-04-10T09:05:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	you mean you can't move that thing to the right side??
2011-04-10T09:06:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	correct, buttons should be on the right unless there is a cute picture of an apple on my computer, and my mouse only has one button :)
2011-04-10T09:06:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	where did you hear that
2011-04-10T09:06:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	ohhh i thought you meant the big menu bar buttons on the left side of the screen
2011-04-10T09:07:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	you can force those window buttons to the right with a little gconf magic
2011-04-10T09:07:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	i heard it through google, reading ubuntu posts... I would love unity if it was a second choice, and if it allowed me to put things where I want like gnome.
2011-04-10T09:07:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	not on unity. they are stuck to the left side, because gconf controls gnome, not unity.
2011-04-10T09:08:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	orly
2011-04-10T09:09:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	so has anyone else heard this "gossip" because i would love to belive it aint so. personally, if i could wish one peice of software out of existence, it would be unity.
2011-04-10T09:09:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	yeah but is unity really all that different from gnome 3 when you look at it
2011-04-10T09:10:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	yes. gnome is configurable, and unity is not. and unity doesn't give me a desktop. i like to make things work and look my way, and unity, atleast for now, is unchangeable.
2011-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	i didnt know unity was so unconfigurable. you'd think it would be if not now then later on.. you sure there isn't some  hidden 'gconf' style thing in there somewhere
2011-04-10T09:12:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	well, as of 5 months ago the was not.
2011-04-10T09:12:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	oh hm
2011-04-10T09:13:00.000Z	hylian	policyq	it's ok man, not your fault, I was actually hoping you would tell me it's all just gossip, and not based on reality :(
2011-04-10T09:13:00.000Z	policyq	hylian	well im gonna be in ubuntu-offtopic i got a theory on al this
