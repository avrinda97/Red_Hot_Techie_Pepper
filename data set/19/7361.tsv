2010-03-10T16:17:00.000Z	naxa		hi! I have a general terminology question. Does "path" (of a file), by meaning, include the filename itself, or just the way "towards" it? eg. the "path" of /etc/hosts is "/etc/" or "/etc/hosts"?
2010-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	path is /etc/
2010-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	path is /etc/nameoffile (damn keyboard!)
2010-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	I see! great, thanks. How do you call "/path/file", has it a name? like "full path" or something...
2010-03-10T16:20:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	nope, same thing, sorry I cause a confusion with my 'not awake and need more coffee' issue
2010-03-10T16:21:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	right
2010-03-10T16:21:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	no problem about coffee
2010-03-10T16:22:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	ardchoille: now I want to say "path or filename or infix_of_filename". is it enough to say "path or infix_of_filename" or I should add filename to the list?
2010-03-10T16:23:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	ardchoille : i mean i want to name a variable to be human readable and I'm not affraid of using mile_long_variable_names
2010-03-10T16:26:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	sorry cannot help, dont program myself
2010-03-10T16:27:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	OK thanks for the previous help! :)
2010-03-10T16:27:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	however I am only trying to ask if the two thing has the same meaning or not
2010-03-10T16:27:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	unknown again I know nothing about programing/scripting
2010-03-10T16:27:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	I mean if the have the same meaning outside programming, than it's ok :)
2010-03-10T16:27:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	but never mind
2010-03-10T16:28:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	just chatting :)
2010-03-10T16:31:00.000Z	TxPitou	naxa	tell me path or filename is 2 things, /this-is-the-path/so-is-this/filename get it ?
2010-03-10T16:32:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	I think I'll be okay. thank you! :) i was wondernig if the term "path" includes both e.g. /path/filename and filename (meaning ./filename)
2010-03-10T16:34:00.000Z	naxa	TxPitou	I should go now. thank you again, sorry for the numerous dumb questions. :)
