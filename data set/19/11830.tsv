2006-03-08T16:16:00.000Z	Bad-Wolf		i have 1 question what space i need to install Ubuntu?
2006-03-08T16:16:00.000Z	Bad-Wolf		1gb
2006-03-08T16:16:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	i got 2.2gb and its pretty fresh standard ubuntu breezy
2006-03-08T16:17:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	with 4gb your should be done for a long time
2006-03-08T16:18:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	cant remember even having / over 3gb
2006-03-08T16:18:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	you could install ubuntu with the server option (should be ~200mb) and then install some lightweight WM, browser, and so on
2006-03-08T16:19:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	yup, xubuntu is a good start
2006-03-08T16:23:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	i got a 200mhz latpot with xfce4, works but is pretty slow...
2006-03-08T16:25:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	my desktop is 1.2g duron, and i dont have needs to have faster, all works fast enough (except 3d games;)
2006-03-08T16:25:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	with 120mhz you should forget gnome or kde...
2006-03-08T16:26:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	or if you have enogh time, it should work (but need more space than 1gb)
2006-03-08T16:28:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	yes,
2006-03-08T16:28:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	you just cant use gnome or kde (propably)
2006-03-08T16:29:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	as you need a pretty big swap file (when you have only 32mb ram)
2006-03-08T16:31:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	you could try that xubuntu-desktop
2006-03-08T16:33:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	as i said you gonna have VERY hard times with 32mb ram
2006-03-08T16:33:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	how about just installing an finding out if the space is enogh ?
2006-03-08T16:34:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	then you need floppies or netboot
2006-03-08T16:34:00.000Z	oskude	Bad-Wolf	debian has good netinstall floppies
