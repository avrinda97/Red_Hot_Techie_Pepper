2005-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	bryan		not at all... i tried grub, but it destroyed my mrb and i had to wipe my entire winxp system and hd; someone suggested running it through lilo.  any suggestion on a better dual-boot way; im open to anything right now.
2005-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	you dont have to erase winxp to repair the MBR

2005-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	thanks, but it's already been done... :-(
2005-07-07T05:14:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	are you going to reinstall ubuntu?
2005-07-07T05:15:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	ive been @#$% with it for a while now.  i really want it to work, but it doesn't seem to want to...
2005-07-07T05:17:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	are you going to reinstall Ubuntu?
2005-07-07T05:17:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	i've reinstalled >dozen times in 3 days... what would another install do?
2005-07-07T05:17:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	I was simply asking because I was going to say reinstall windows first, and then ubuntu
2005-07-07T05:18:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	thanks... i read somewhere else winxp should go on first to stop things from going sour... i really want ubuntu to work so badly... :-|
2005-07-07T05:19:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	whats wrong with ubuntu?
2005-07-07T05:19:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	it won't load at all
2005-07-07T05:21:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	good excuse to reinstall and use GRUB instead
2005-07-07T05:21:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	again?  like i said, it totally killed my system last time...
2005-07-07T05:23:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	are you on that system right now?
2005-07-07T05:24:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	yeah.  i wiped hda and reinstalled winxp
2005-07-07T05:24:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	if you reinstall Ubuntu on that box, make sure GRUB recognizes the windows partition before you rewrite the MBR
2005-07-07T05:26:00.000Z	concept10	bryan	if GRUB doesnt automagically recognize the winxp partition, that means the MBR is screwed
2005-07-07T05:27:00.000Z	bryan	concept10	grub did recognize, but when i restarted the system, it just kept restarting itself; wouldnt let me into anything.  i tried to save w/ knoppix, but no luck...
