2007-06-25T09:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Samba is one of those things thats worth learning :) I reread 'using samba' last night. and learned a few new things..
2007-06-25T09:08:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	Your smart; I'll ask you.  If a group (var-wwww) owns a directory, how do I make it so that any files created in that folder (by users in the group) are owned by the user and group var-www?
2007-06-25T09:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 groups and masks like that are somthing ive rarely used.  Like you mentioned - i did see that option for samba shares.. Not sure how it is done for normal dirs.
2007-06-25T09:10:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	Bah, I'll just copy it up to my home dir and copy it over again.  It's what I've been doing.
2007-06-25T09:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 heh. Ive rarely had users creating web content. so never looked into that stuff.
2007-06-25T09:11:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	I am the user, and was just hoping to avoid another cp
2007-06-25T09:11:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	I shut down root ssh, or I'd just sudo it from here
2007-12-14T10:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 try Vo<tab key>
2007-12-14T10:12:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	I hadn't checked if he was the only one in here like that...
2007-12-14T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 dolphin is the new file manager for kde4.
2008-01-09T08:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	you here?
2008-04-19T18:05:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient15-dev for isntance gives me:   libmysqlclient15-dev: Depends: zlib1g-dev but it is not installable and then mysql-client and mysql-server won't go.  Is this common for gutsy installs on onlder hardware?
2008-04-19T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 i would have to suggest 'sudo apt-get update'  'sudo apt-get upgrade' and try installing the packages again. first. Harware dosent matter for this stuff
2008-04-19T19:14:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	remember me?  I did updates, upgrades, and sitll can't sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client.  Says there are unmet dependencies
2008-04-19T19:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 Its possible that file it watns is missing form the servers or some other oddity. Im using hardy here. so cant test for you. You might want to try changing the apt sources to another server.
2008-07-30T08:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	I did try that (read on some forums) but it won't play.  Are there extra packages I need besides audacious?
2008-07-30T08:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	craigbass1976	 no idea. proberly depends on what site you are doing.
2012-04-04T05:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	no, never,  I'm ashamed
2012-04-04T05:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Dr_willis	I came off fedora, so I was used to being root.  It must always get mentioned after I leave.
