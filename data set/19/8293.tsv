2007-10-29T03:23:00.000Z	Broccoly		is there some sort of image browser in ubuntu that will create thumbnails of a directory of large images?
2007-10-29T03:23:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	I thought the built in nautilus/whatever does that
2007-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	but you can run 'gphoto' and many other tools... depends what you want
2007-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	i don't think it stores thumbnails
2007-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	?it?
2007-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	nautilius
2007-10-29T03:25:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	well.. you can use  gphoto
2007-10-29T03:25:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	or theres many other tools... experiment... backup files first just in case etc. ;-)
2007-10-29T03:26:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	i don't see it the repo, thers gphoto2?
2007-10-29T03:26:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	i think thats it
2007-10-29T03:26:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	maybe im triking of the wrong tool but I think thats it
2007-10-29T03:26:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	maybe that doesnt do what you want... i dont know!
2007-10-29T03:27:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	from the description it seems for downloading imgs from cameras ;-)
2007-10-29T03:27:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	experiment... i could be wrong thing.. i cant remember...
2007-10-29T03:28:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	that's the whole point of asking is not to experiment with a bunch of programs ;-) all i want is to browse a folder with images heh
2007-10-29T03:29:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	browsing is easy... use nautilus
2007-10-29T03:29:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	nautilus does not store thumbnails like windows does
2007-10-29T03:29:00.000Z	enyc	Broccoly	and...  you can still browse
2007-10-29T03:30:00.000Z	Broccoly	enyc	except it will take about half an hour to generate thumbnails for a lot of large images ;)
