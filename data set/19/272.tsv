2012-05-05T03:41:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	it says to press shift on boot after the bios to get to the grub boot loader but doesnt seem to do anything on this 12.04 install
2012-05-05T03:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	is this a live cd boot?
2012-05-05T03:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	netinstall you mean like pxe boot?  or maybe live cd
2012-05-05T03:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	or it could be like minimal boot from usb to install from net I guess
2012-05-05T03:44:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/precise/
2012-05-05T03:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	ok minimal,  I did play with that a bit before precise was released,  it's the text install so don't know why it would go black unless this is after installed
2012-05-05T03:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	oh I have a thought maybe you use a usb keyboard that won't respond to grub,  if so try enable something like legacy in bios to get the usb keyboard to work
2012-05-05T03:48:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	after the install process has been completed and it asks for you to remove the install media and reboot right after bios posts to a blackscreen no cursor or anything
2012-05-05T03:51:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	legacy usb support was on
2012-05-05T03:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	ok now I'm out of idea's,  I guess you might try a live boot from your minimal and modify grub settings to add nomodeset
2012-05-05T04:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	oh I wonder if it's grafics if you could try after boot (some time like 3 minits of black) try <ctrl><alt>f2  to get into console
2012-05-05T04:04:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	I will try that
2012-05-05T04:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	well back to live boot and modify grub for nomodeset,  I'll look for details
2012-05-05T04:07:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	it just finished downloading the full thing will check that out now
2012-05-05T04:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	this has the details you need but you might need to mount the file system from minimal boot to modify the file needed http://www.tuxgarage.com/2011/01/ubuntumaverick-blank-screen-problem.html
2012-05-05T04:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	Wessley	also I would take out quiet splash so you can see where it might crash at some point
2012-05-05T04:15:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	/ IntuitiveNipple extracting to usb now...
2012-05-05T04:35:00.000Z	Wessley	sacarlson	/ IntuitiveNipple with the usb install I get a grub window not the one shown in the picture and there are 3 options on Try Ubuntu without installing, Install Ubuntu, Check disc for defects
