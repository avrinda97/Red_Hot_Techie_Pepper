2007-04-29T09:58:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	that's plenty
2007-04-29T09:59:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	256 MB is enough for gnome at least
2007-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	soyporti	eck	if a have 750 on ram an a NVIDIA 128 video card  6200 is normal that the system is slowing?
2007-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	you can also have slownes if you have i/o issues
2007-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	no, that's much faster than my system
2007-04-29T10:01:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	check your logs to see if something really awry is going on
2007-04-29T10:01:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	also, you can check your memory usage with free -m (count the -/+ buffers/cache line as your memory usage)
2007-04-29T10:02:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	high i/o would be e.g. if something is constantly accessing the disk, which causes other applications that need to use the disk to slow down
2007-04-29T10:15:00.000Z	soyporti	eck	i have windows XP(because of my sister) and today the power went off  when she was working there.
2007-04-29T10:15:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	check the output of dmesg and the logs in /var/log, sometiems the kernel will complain if it detects hardware issues
2007-04-29T10:17:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	look at dmesg first
2007-04-29T10:18:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	run "dmesg | less"
2007-04-29T10:21:00.000Z	soyporti	eck	I'm sorry to bother i know it can be annoying but i'm learning a lot thanks
2007-04-29T10:21:00.000Z	eck	soyporti	check to see if there are any errors (probably near the end)
