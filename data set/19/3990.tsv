2009-04-22T15:07:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	What's the error message?
2009-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	There is no error message, the desktop just fails to load after I've logged inn
2009-04-22T16:11:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	Select it at the boot menu.
2009-04-22T16:12:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	I have the same problem as pragad7
2009-04-22T16:12:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	When you reboot, it should display it. If not, it'll tell you to hit Esc to show the menu, with a three-second countdown.
2009-04-22T16:12:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	Can you get to a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F1?
2009-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	I can
2009-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	I get to the login screen, but once I've logged in, the desktop won't show
2009-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	OK, try 'sudo apt-get remove compiz'
2009-04-22T16:16:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	Deleting it now
2009-04-22T16:19:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	No go. Still no desktop even after removing compiz.
2009-04-22T16:19:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	It worked just fine last night, stopped working this morning
2009-04-22T16:20:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	What type of graphics card? Any recent updates?
2009-04-22T16:21:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	NVidia something-something, 7600 GO I think, used the built in Ubuntu function to get the drive for it.
2009-04-22T16:21:00.000Z	wgrant	Mr_Kaizer	Ah... the proprietary NVIDIA driver. I probably can't help you with that.
2009-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	Dang...I just don't get why it worked perfectly last night, but not now? I even rebooted it two-three times before I went to bed to check if it booted properly. Then when I turned it on this morning, no desktop.
2009-04-22T16:24:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	The reboot after installing the driver was normal.
2009-04-22T16:38:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	wgrant	Is there a way I can dissable the NVIDIA driver with terminal?
