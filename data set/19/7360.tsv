2007-12-14T01:55:00.000Z	wols	naxa	rc.local
2007-12-14T01:56:00.000Z	naxa	wols	thanks!
2007-12-26T19:17:00.000Z	wols	naxa	acpi
2007-12-26T19:18:00.000Z	naxa	wols	i used to use "noacpi" kernel option but it still freezes i think...
2007-12-26T19:18:00.000Z	wols	naxa	think or know?
2007-12-26T19:19:00.000Z	naxa	wols	think.. should i try? :D
2007-12-26T19:19:00.000Z	naxa	wols	there were a case when it freezed why noacpi
2007-12-26T19:20:00.000Z	naxa	wols	so now i restart with noacpi and see if it works ok?
2007-12-26T19:23:00.000Z	wols	naxa	another thing to test is to NOT start X, make the notebook work heavily so cooling is active and check if it happens then
2007-12-26T19:24:00.000Z	wols	naxa	if it still happens, all your X programs are off the hook
2007-12-26T19:24:00.000Z	naxa	wols	good idea
2007-12-26T20:31:00.000Z	wols	naxa	have you tried with nv yet?
2007-12-26T20:31:00.000Z	naxa	wols	nv never works for me, as i said
2007-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	naxa	wols	i tried it and no help
2007-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	naxa	wols	i've just tried in a couple of hours ago. blank screen
2007-12-26T20:34:00.000Z	naxa	wols	can you suggest me some applications what are killing cpu for sure? i mean i want to overload my system to see if it breaks or nnot
2007-12-28T06:30:00.000Z	naxa	wols	i checked my ubuntu, no noacpi and anything helped. i didn't check yet what if i don't start X
2007-12-28T06:30:00.000Z	naxa	wols	it's freezing with or without noacpi
