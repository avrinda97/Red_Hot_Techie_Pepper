2009-08-29T22:28:00.000Z	xok		I thought ubuntu had good community... :-(
2009-08-29T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	IT DOES
2009-08-29T22:28:00.000Z	xok	ikonia	am asking same question half an hour... no response, no attention... :-(
2009-08-29T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	if someone knows they will answer, what's the problem
2009-08-29T22:29:00.000Z	xok	ikonia	 I've got some problems installing jabberd14 from source... actually, it configures and installs without problem, but can't find mysql header files... though mysql-devel, mysql and mysql-server are properly installed on the system...
2009-08-29T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	how can it install without a problem if it can't find the headers ?
2009-08-29T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	if it can't find the headers it won't make
2009-08-29T22:32:00.000Z	xok	ikonia	it configures and compiles without problem... but woning appears saying that jabberd will run without mysql or posgresql support...
2009-08-29T22:32:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	it can't compile correctly if the header files are missing
2009-08-29T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	ok so you have warnings, you'll need to use the correct configure options to point at the headers
2009-08-29T22:33:00.000Z	xok	ikonia	I've told triple times already "it does compile without problems".. what to do now?.... I can't sing here... :-D
2009-08-29T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	rebuild it with the correct configure options
2009-08-29T22:34:00.000Z	xok	ikonia	I've already done that, still the same... --with-extra-include-path=/usr/include/mysql
2009-08-29T22:34:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	then speak to the softrware maintainers then, it may not have support for it yet, could be a bug in the source
2009-08-29T22:35:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	also worth doing a make clean removing your config.cache file and re-configuring
2009-08-29T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	check your config.log to see what it does to test for the headers, then see if it detects/finds them in the log and if not why not
2009-08-29T22:37:00.000Z	xok	ikonia	thank you, I'll try to find out in logs...
2009-08-29T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	config.log is the core one, also, make sure you remove config.cache before your re-configure
2009-08-29T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	xok	maybe config.status too
