2007-06-29T11:02:00.000Z	ahmed		how can i
2007-06-29T11:03:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	what exactly do you want to learn ?
2007-06-29T11:05:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	i would recommend buying a good book about managing linux machines. I recommend Running Linux by O'Reilly to get you started.
2007-06-29T11:06:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	it really depends on what aspects of Linux you want to learn
2007-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	it does not matter about the distribution, but you need sometjhing to calculate time used
2007-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	and you can find some software options for that on freshmeat
2007-06-29T11:09:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	you will have to search for cybercafe software to manage the machines and calculate time+billing. We cannot help you with that here
2007-06-29T11:09:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	you need to buy a book on Linux to learn linux faster.
2007-06-29T11:10:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	you might be able to find torrents on it, but I don't really recommend copyright violations of any sort
2007-06-29T11:11:00.000Z	pramz	ahmed	since it is something which will benefit you, its wise to buy it :)
