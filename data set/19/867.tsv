2011-08-04T14:20:00.000Z	elv		any ideas how to set/check that i am using really 802.11n on wifi?
2011-08-04T14:22:00.000Z	elv		only 802.11n get this speed
2011-08-04T14:23:00.000Z	allandee	elv	N seems to be better at instability too
2011-08-04T14:23:00.000Z	elv	allandee	no problem here
2011-08-04T14:24:00.000Z	allandee	elv	yea, I might just have crappy hardware
2011-08-04T14:25:00.000Z	allandee	elv	in Ubuntu?
2011-08-04T14:26:00.000Z	elv	allandee	yep
2011-08-04T14:27:00.000Z	elv	allandee	is not that problem, "sudo iwconfig wlan0 modu 11g" --> "SET failed on device wlan0"
2011-08-04T14:28:00.000Z	elv	allandee	btw -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 26904 2011-05-07 10:22 /sbin/iwconfig
2011-08-04T14:29:00.000Z	elv	allandee	only messages of authentication on the network
2011-08-04T14:32:00.000Z	elv	allandee	http://paste.ubuntu.com/658566/
2011-08-04T14:32:00.000Z	elv	allandee	maybe more interesting is iwconfig...
2011-08-04T14:34:00.000Z	allandee	elv	I doubt that it's something lost in translation, but I've never seen ifconfig report an ip address as "192.168.x.x"    what does netstat -rn say?
2011-08-04T14:35:00.000Z	elv	allandee	i put X on my ip address
2011-08-04T14:35:00.000Z	allandee	elv	aaaah, I thought I was going crazy.  ok, netstat -rn?
2011-08-04T14:37:00.000Z	elv	allandee	http://paste.ubuntu.com/658570/
2011-08-04T14:38:00.000Z	allandee	elv	"ping 192.168.1.1" ?
2011-08-04T14:42:00.000Z	elv	allandee	i have an internet connection i want to know if i am usig 802.11n on the lan!
2011-08-04T14:47:00.000Z	allandee	elv	good, just wanted to get an impression that you were on a hub close to the hub of your lan.  I don't know of any gui utilities that monitors the state of wifi-cards specifically, but checking the output of "dmesg" often is a good indication
