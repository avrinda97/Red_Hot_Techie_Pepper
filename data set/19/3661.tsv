2010-01-11T05:16:00.000Z	LinuX2half		how do I resize my partition
2010-01-11T05:16:00.000Z	LinuX2half		I want to have two partition
2010-01-11T05:16:00.000Z	LinuX2half		I am using gparted
2010-01-11T05:16:00.000Z	LinuX2half		But whenever I create another partition it gave me an error
2010-01-11T05:17:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	did you run gparted as root?
2010-01-11T05:18:00.000Z	LinuX2half	luks_	then?
2010-01-11T05:22:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	it does ;)
2010-01-11T05:22:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	but i think you have to accept changes or something in gparted
2010-01-11T05:22:00.000Z	LinuX2half	luks_	okay then all i had to do now is to apply the changes, running sudo power
2010-01-11T05:23:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	hopefully, yes :)
2010-01-11T05:29:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	yes
2010-01-11T05:30:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	do you want to install windows on your ntfs partition?
2010-01-11T05:30:00.000Z	LinuX2half	luks_	Yes planning to
2010-01-11T05:31:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	ok, remember to reinstall grub because windows overwrites the master boot record
2010-01-11T05:31:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	otherwise you are only able to boot into windows
2010-01-11T05:32:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	is the ntfs partition created before are after your linux partition? in the hard disk layout (sorry for my english)
2010-01-11T05:33:00.000Z	LinuX2half	luks_	I think its after the linux partition
2010-01-11T05:38:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	thats ok, but primary is a type of partition, it doesnt mean its the first partition on your hard disk
2010-01-11T05:46:00.000Z	luks_	LinuX2half	thats nothing to worry about
