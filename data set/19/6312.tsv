2008-02-17T08:26:00.000Z	rhineheart_m		is there a way to restore ubuntu server into its newly installed state? just like in windows..they have system restore...thanks
2008-02-17T08:26:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	what do you mean newly installed?
2008-02-17T08:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	do you have a gui?  or is this gui-less?
2008-02-17T08:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	if you are talking to me, please use my name, it highlights the message.  the tab key can help with this
2008-02-17T08:36:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	sorry..this is my first time here
2008-02-17T08:37:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	what web based control panel can you recommend for ubuntu server?
2008-02-17T08:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	no big deal, I might accidentally ignore you.  deborphan will identify which packages are orphaned.  A base install is simple the package ubuntu-server.   So, anything that is orphaned other than ubuntu-server can go, to get back to a vanilla install
2008-02-17T08:39:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	so you mean..when I will deoprhaned the system...it will go back to its OS state?
2008-02-17T08:39:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	I don't know about webbase control thingies
2008-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	yeah, the original state is when you only have ubuntu-server installed, and all the packages it depends on
2008-02-17T08:41:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	that's great! at least I will not be spending most of my time formatting the disk
2008-02-17T08:41:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	and you should make sure to have a kernel installed to, like the linux-generic meta package, though there may be a server one
2008-02-17T08:42:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	so how to do i
2008-02-17T08:42:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	well, play with deborphan, the gtkorphan package is easy, im afraid the cli version is more difficult to use, and I can't help ya, since I've never done it
2008-02-17T08:43:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	is that something with GUI?
2008-02-17T08:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	gtkorphan is the gui front end to deborphan
2008-02-17T08:43:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	but how about if I will not be using GUI... i just want the server be accessed through ssh
2008-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	rhineheart_m	you are going to have to use google, or ask someone else, because I don't know.  Sorry
2008-02-17T08:45:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	danbhfive	thanks for the advice...I appreciate it.. I will try FourX4Luvn
