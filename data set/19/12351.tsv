2006-02-19T07:51:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	figured out how to mount the ntfs part
2006-02-19T07:56:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Knowerrors	what are you trying to do?
2006-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	Ive got a second harddrive attached, it shows as hdb, hdb1,2,3, in /dev, but it has no fstab enty and won't mount
2006-02-19T07:57:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Knowerrors	try this from a terminal
2006-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	no output from that
2006-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Knowerrors	then i'm afraid linux can't see your hdb.
2006-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	maybe my pins on the drive are set wrong?
2006-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	weird that fstab shows it though
2006-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Knowerrors	/dev or fstab?
2006-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	/dev
2006-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Knowerrors	doesn't matter that it's in there
2006-02-19T08:00:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	would having jumper set wrong cause the drive to not moung?  Even though I can see it with a live cd?
2006-02-19T08:01:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	yeah, I just ran Kanotix live cd and I could read hdb fine, and hda
2006-02-19T08:03:00.000Z	Knowerrors	hyperactivecrond	what do I do with the output?
