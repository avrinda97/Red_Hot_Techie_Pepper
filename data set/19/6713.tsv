2008-12-24T04:16:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	Sure. Where can I send that?

2008-12-24T04:17:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	If it helps, I can set up for serial capture too.
2008-12-24T04:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	great, we'll take that route, too, if we need to

2008-12-24T04:23:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	awesome, thanks
2008-12-24T04:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	sec, cross-referencing something
2008-12-24T04:25:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	Great. Getting a sip of water myself.
2008-12-24T04:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	please try booting with noreplace-paravirt appended to the kernel command line
2008-12-24T04:33:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	oooh. OK. Will take a bit.
2008-12-24T04:33:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	Starting...
2008-12-24T04:34:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	MUCH better so far!
2008-12-24T04:36:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	Still going, so that was very helpful. Googling that param shows lots of people having similar-ish issue. Do you have a link for an explanation of what that option does, please?

2008-12-24T04:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	there's also discussion from 2008-08-22, also bug 246067
2008-12-24T04:42:00.000Z	Torgoton	crimsun	hehe thanks. Very precise, but still not helpful to me. Again, thank you for getting me going. My efforts will be logged here: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_on_a_ThinkPad_750P
2008-12-24T04:42:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	ok, thanks
2008-12-24T04:44:00.000Z	crimsun	Torgoton	essentially, using that boot option disables on-the-fly patching enabling paravirt support
