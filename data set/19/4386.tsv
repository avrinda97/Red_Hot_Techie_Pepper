2009-01-25T03:04:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	I didn't follow: are there data on any of your partitions, you want to keep?
2009-01-25T03:04:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	yes windows ut it had 66 gigs of free space left
2009-01-25T03:05:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	so you deleted your windows partition?
2009-01-25T03:06:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	no it's there i just use gparted to free up that remaining harddrive space and move it over to my linux side
2009-01-25T03:07:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	ut according to genrich the partition has to be next to the ext to move and resize it
2009-01-25T03:07:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	careful - in the screenshot you posted there is no windows partition at all
2009-01-25T03:08:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	it's the top one it's called /dev/sda1 ext3 with a darker blue
2009-01-25T03:09:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	a windows on ext3???
2009-01-25T03:10:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	 that's what it is
2009-01-25T03:10:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	i used gparted and those are the files it gives me besides that is the exact amount of harddrive space that my windows side used
2009-01-25T03:11:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	 i left 6 gigs for additional space and used 66 gigs for the transfer
2009-01-25T03:12:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	 if you look carefully you will see that the first ext 3 still sys it has 72.91 gigs of free space unused which is not true
2009-01-25T03:13:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	it adds up the same because i used 66 and left 6 which is 72 gigs
2009-01-25T03:13:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	I'm still dubious, but anyway: you should be able to resize the ext. part. , and *then* sda5, if thats what you want, but ...
2009-01-25T03:14:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	 i tried to do this in livecd and it only gave me the option with the unallocated space to make it a new file
2009-01-25T03:16:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	 what is the but???
2009-01-25T03:16:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	I'm afraid, there is something wrong with your partition table, but right now I'm too tired to look it thoroughly over, maybe somebody else will have a look at it
2009-01-25T03:17:00.000Z	Guest770	guntbert	alright thanks is there anyone else tat can help me
2009-01-25T03:19:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest770	you will have to ask the channel again (no nick in the beginning), it might help if you restated your problem on *one* line - good luck
