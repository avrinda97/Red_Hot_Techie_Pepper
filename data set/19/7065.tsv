2011-09-21T23:11:00.000Z	cvance		Hello, I was working with a company that had a really nice vnc access portal. Each workstation was running a little daemon. When the machine was on, it would connect to a central management server, and when IT wanted to remotely control a workstation, they would log into a web portal on the lan, and it would have a listing of all active computers on the network.
2011-09-21T23:11:00.000Z	cvance		Does anyone know of a open source software which kinda does the same thing?
2011-09-21T23:12:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	Well, you could just have launchers for each system  on your network.
2011-09-21T23:12:00.000Z	cvance	usr13	can you elaborate a little bit more please?
2011-09-21T23:14:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	Well, there are a number of ways you can do it, but if you have everyone on static IPs it would be easy to have launchers for each system, just hame them appropriately and click on the one you want and a VNC window just pops up.
2011-09-21T23:15:00.000Z	cvance	usr13	yeah, I have static ip's assigned, I just being lazy and seeing if anyone knows of some neatly prepared package that does what i'm looking for.
2011-09-21T23:15:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	I just use tightvnc  and   x11vnc
2011-09-21T23:15:00.000Z	cvance		If not, no sweat, I can just run the servers and connect because I assigned static ips
2011-09-21T23:16:00.000Z	cvance		I forgot what my last employer used, but it was kinda neat but very expensive.
2011-09-21T23:16:00.000Z	cvance		tightvnc or realvnc or ultravnc?
2011-09-21T23:16:00.000Z	cvance		what do you guys like?
2011-09-21T23:17:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	I prefer just using IP addresses.  When I do Ctrl-F2 the run box comes up and when I type vn it autocompeltes to vncviewer 192.168.1.   and I just type in the last number or two and I'm there.
2011-09-21T23:17:00.000Z	cvance		ah, i forgot to mention that I am running windows on the workstations
2011-09-21T23:18:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	But if you like names instead of numbers, just fill in the hosts file with them and they can be c1, c2, c3, c4   etc.
2011-09-21T23:18:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	Doesn't matter.
2011-09-21T23:18:00.000Z	cvance		I have the machines on my dns server, resolution is not a problem.
2011-09-21T23:18:00.000Z	cvance		more like, I'm looking for suggestions. They would all work fine I think, but wanted a little opinion or two.
2011-09-21T23:18:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	So just create launchers for each.
2011-09-21T23:19:00.000Z	usr13	cvance	Again, there are a number of ways to make it convenient and easy, just depends on how you like to do it, (and if you will always access them from the same PC or not).
