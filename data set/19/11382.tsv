2006-05-18T16:59:00.000Z	nny		wow
2006-05-18T05:00:00.000Z	nny		asus aj6c... not loving alot of stuff for me right now
2006-05-18T05:00:00.000Z	nny		even pcmcia/wireless is acting up
2006-05-18T05:00:00.000Z	nny		so yeah, speaking of fat32, is that the best way for sharing storage for a dual boot right now?
2006-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	paradizelost	nny	you could get the ext2 driver for windows
2006-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	nny	paradizelost	hows that work?
2006-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	nny		is it better?
2006-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	paradizelost	nny	i haven't set it up myself, but a buddy had it working nicely
2006-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	nny		rock on i'll do that for sotrage
2006-05-18T05:02:00.000Z	nny		now i just need to figure out why this install is fighting me on networking
2006-05-18T05:02:00.000Z	paradizelost		i think i's caled e2fs
2006-05-18T05:03:00.000Z	nny		why would this dapper install have wifi0/wlan0 listed as interfaces, but on my other laptop (breezy) it shows as eth0?
2006-05-18T05:03:00.000Z	nny		er eth1
2006-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	paradizelost	nny	the way the driver makes it show
2006-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	nny		these ornioco cards work fine on my laptop, but are acting trippy on the other one
2006-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	paradizelost	nny	mine shows as eth0
2006-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	nny		hermes chipsetr
2006-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	nny		hmm
2006-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	paradizelost	nny	but for the dapper issues, i'd ask in #ubuntu+1
