2008-04-02T01:10:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- see http://forum.compiz-fusion.org
2008-04-02T01:10:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- install compiz settings manager (CCSM) and set 4 virtual desktops and then check "desktop cube"
2008-04-02T01:12:00.000Z	soulreaper	MountainX	can you give me a link to where i can down load it?
2008-04-02T01:13:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- use Synaptics Package Manager under System Admin menu in Ubuntu
2008-04-02T01:21:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- it is under system preferences menu
2008-04-02T01:21:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- it is called advanced desktop effects settings
2008-04-02T01:23:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	then turn on the desktop cube under "desktop" section on main page
2008-04-02T01:38:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- did you set horiz virtual size to 4?
2008-04-02T01:44:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- no restart required
2008-04-02T01:45:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- but you need 4 desktops, not 2
2008-04-02T01:48:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- are you on ubuntu or kubuntu? If in ubuntu, you must see 4 desks in lower right before you can use cube
2008-04-02T01:50:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- there is no need to "apply" - the settings become effective
2008-04-02T01:52:00.000Z	soulreaper	MountainX	well i set the horizontal virtual size to 4 and vertical virtual is set to one and number of deck tops are set to 4
2008-04-02T01:54:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- check out the compiz links I and others posted above
2008-04-02T01:57:00.000Z	soulreaper	MountainX	can you post the link agen
2008-04-02T01:57:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- several people posted compiz links for you. The one I posted was http://forum.compiz-fusion.org
2008-04-02T02:00:00.000Z	MountainX	soulreaper	- I have not had to restart when I set up the desktop cube.
