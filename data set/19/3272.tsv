2009-11-03T13:49:00.000Z	theadmin	napster	Using the alternate CD, you will keep them. Just put it in the drive after booting. And it will suggest to upgrade

2010-11-02T16:20:00.000Z	theadmin	napster	Yeah %) It's a system-wide app... for one user, I think there should be some other way, but no idea. Except maybe trough Gnome's settings
