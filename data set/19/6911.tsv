2007-11-18T13:06:00.000Z	mandh		i have strange problem , the cpu idle about 80% , but when try to execute command like ps -aux , it take long time  ?
2007-11-18T13:07:00.000Z	ere4si	mandh	try using top instead
2007-11-18T13:08:00.000Z	mandh	ere4si	top dont work at all , coz it take long time , i dont know why , i only can use vmstate 1 16 for example
2007-11-18T13:11:00.000Z	ere4si	mandh	try at boot selecting rescue kernel and then top or ps -aux
2007-11-18T13:12:00.000Z	mandh	ere4si	it is running server , i cant stop it
2007-11-18T13:14:00.000Z	ere4si	mandh	you might have to - worst case scenario would be someone else is controlling it...
2007-11-18T13:15:00.000Z	ere4si	mandh	are there log files to read?
2007-11-18T13:15:00.000Z	mandh	ere4si	the server is mail server
2007-11-18T13:16:00.000Z	mandh	ere4si	and running mta-courier i can read the log file easily but when try to exectue some commands like ls or ps , top it take long time, using vmstate appear that cpu idle 80 %
2007-11-18T13:18:00.000Z	ere4si	mandh	don't know how else to help - thought the logs would let you know the processes that are using the cpu - 80% idle isn't right
2007-11-18T13:19:00.000Z	ere4si		!patcience | kaddy
2007-11-18T13:19:00.000Z	mandh	ere4si	yeah may vmstate not accurate in that !!!!
2007-11-18T13:20:00.000Z	ere4si	mandh	if the cpu is going at 80% then that will make progs slow to load
2007-11-18T13:21:00.000Z	mandh	ere4si	yeah sure but  0  0 107300  32572 261896 377848    0    0     0     0 1043    86  0  0 100  0
