2011-05-14T02:19:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	I thought the 3518 was supported via wl?
2011-05-14T02:22:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	is the wireless switch on maybe?
2011-05-14T02:23:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- In the bios is says enabled, however the switch doesn't currently toggle when I push it.
2011-05-14T02:24:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	does 'sudo iwconfig'  show any info about the card?
2011-05-14T02:24:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- yes, I'm currently rebooting so can't get the exact message, but it shows wlan0 with a good deal of detail about it.
2011-05-14T02:25:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	ok, that's fine. Let me know when the system is back up.
2011-05-14T02:27:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- I'm back up
2011-05-14T02:28:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	do this: lsmod | grep wl
2011-05-14T02:29:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- just one min.  I actually don't have wlan0 now.  I think it's from switching to sta.  swtiching back to b43
2011-05-14T02:30:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	ok!
2011-05-14T02:30:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	I'm not sure where to get it from: firmware-b43-installer I think
2011-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- I'm not sure exactly what I did different this time, but after uninstalling STA, re-installing b43 and rebooting the wifi light came on and everything is working now.
2011-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	Haha! MAGIC!
2011-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- I guess so.  Now I must never re-install. :-)  Thanks for the help!
2011-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	I bet the b43 install pulled in an important package that was missing
2011-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	you can check in the software manager logs to see what got pulled in
2011-05-14T02:35:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	well, it is Linux. You probably will never have to! :)
2011-05-14T02:35:00.000Z	Guest56851	tntc	- I'm not sure.  I had re-installed b43 a half dozen times before.  the only change was installing/removing sta for the first time
2011-05-14T02:36:00.000Z	tntc	Guest56851	check for the b43-firmware package. Also, something just occured to me: b43 might've been blacklisted or something weird like that
