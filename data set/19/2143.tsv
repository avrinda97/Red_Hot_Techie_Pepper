2010-09-09T06:13:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	nope...I live on a boat...read everything I need onscreen
2010-09-09T06:06:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	how is your server connected to the net...wifi?
2010-09-09T06:07:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	is the router set to forward the proper port(s) to the server?
2010-09-09T06:08:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	is sshd running on the server?
2010-09-09T06:09:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	yes
2010-09-09T06:09:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	what happens when you try 'ssh <domainname>?
2010-09-09T06:10:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	keep it here
2010-09-09T06:11:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	That works for me.  SSH works but connecting the the we server doesn't
2010-09-09T06:11:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	you need to forward port 80 for a webserver
2010-09-09T06:11:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	I knew that, crap i feel stupid
2010-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	your the best by the way. Can you help me with a printer for the server?
2010-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	doubt it...haven't had a printer in years
2010-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	you don't print anything?
2010-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	have you attached the printer to the server?
2010-09-09T06:14:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	thats awesome.
2010-09-09T06:15:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	if I remember correctly, you need to install samba to share a printer....but it has been a long time <smile>
2010-09-09T06:18:00.000Z	th0r	blsmith	but remember to forward port 631 to the server if you are trying that from outside <smile>
2010-09-09T06:19:00.000Z	blsmith	th0r	thanks
