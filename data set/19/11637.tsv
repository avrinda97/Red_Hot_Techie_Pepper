2005-12-16T15:04:00.000Z	CorrosionX		Hey anyone here knows a way to run Ubuntu from within Windows (like as an emulator, my linux is on another partition)
2005-12-16T15:04:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	I don't think that's possible
2005-12-16T15:05:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	i had a knoppix live cd boot from within windows once, i think with QEMU
2005-12-16T15:05:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	rlly?
2005-12-16T15:06:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	it's the only frickin PC I got <_<
2005-12-16T15:07:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	amd64?
2005-12-16T15:07:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	yeh
2005-12-16T15:07:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	yeah i got that too but i finally decided to use i386 because i couldn't get anything working in amd64
2005-12-16T15:08:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	how you do it then?
2005-12-16T15:08:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	reinstall ubutun i386 and forget you have a 64bit processor :)
2005-12-16T15:08:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	nvm..... don't feel like losing all I've set up already <_<
2005-12-16T15:09:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	yeah that's what i thought... then I spent more time trying to make everything work... i lost even more time there
2005-12-16T15:09:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	I've got a lot set up already
2005-12-16T15:10:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	we got played man
2005-12-16T15:10:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	I can tell....
2005-12-16T15:11:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	but just backup your home dir, you'll keep most crucial prefs and documents
2005-12-16T15:11:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	<_<......
2005-12-16T15:12:00.000Z	CorrosionX	zandaa	then it's really easy to install everything you need with just a couple of commands with i386 files, cause nothing is missing and everything is compatible
2005-12-16T15:25:00.000Z	zandaa	CorrosionX	exactly
