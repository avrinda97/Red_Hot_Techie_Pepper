2008-10-25T10:22:00.000Z	Xavura		I'm guessing all these programs beginning with k aren't really needed

2008-10-25T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Xavura	 its very likely those are Kernel processes...
2008-10-25T10:25:00.000Z	Xavura		how likely is very likely?
2008-10-25T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Xavura	 i would say most all of them are.. they seem familer to me - google the specific names and see to be 100% sure.
2008-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Xavura	 i rember looking up some of them ages ago when i noticed them in the process tree.
2008-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	Xavura		ok also dr_willis when I run top it says 2 users, but I am the only user???
2008-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	Xavura		or anyone
2008-10-25T10:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Xavura	  You could be logged in several different times/processes so its counting each one as a user
2008-10-25T10:27:00.000Z	Xavura	dr_willis	How can I check, looks funky to me
2008-10-25T10:27:00.000Z	Xavura	dr_willis	I just logged in like 10 minutes ago.. no one else is logged in
2008-10-25T10:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Xavura	 try the 'who' command.
2008-10-25T10:28:00.000Z	Xavura		I see tty and pts/0
2008-10-25T10:28:00.000Z	Xavura		Both on my name
2008-10-25T10:28:00.000Z	Xavura		That ok then?
2008-10-25T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Xavura	 now go to a consle and log in again.. then check who again. :) and see if its now 3
2008-10-25T10:29:00.000Z	Xavura	dr_willis	Ah I see, ok
