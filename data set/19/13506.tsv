2007-03-16T08:54:00.000Z	Scorched		Hello.
2007-03-16T08:55:00.000Z	Scorched		I have a kind of stupid question.  Is kernel version dependant on Ubuntu version?  I mean if I wanted to update to newest kernerl version, would it cause compatibility problems with Dapper?
2007-03-16T08:55:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	yes
2007-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Utilities use for module loading and various other things would require updating too.
2007-03-16T08:56:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Yup
2007-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Feisty (out soon) will have ekrnel 2.6.20
2007-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	You cna always *try* and see... turns out 2.6.20.3 runs OK on my Debian Sarge machine.
2007-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Do use `kernel-package' though.
2007-03-16T08:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Howso?
2007-03-16T08:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	*after* feisty
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Case in point: it runs fine on my iBook g4 :-)
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Yes, kernel 2.6.20-9 is not the PPCs friend.
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	The latest update fixed the problem, though.
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	that said, just wait until feisty is stable <heh>
2007-03-16T09:00:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	I ran a debian 2.6.18 kernel for a while coz the feisty one was broken. 2.6.20-10 seems to be fine, though.
2007-03-16T09:01:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	I've made pretty bcm43xx-firmware ubuntu packages.
2007-03-16T09:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	Nope.. but then I don't ever have ethernet plugged in when I sue wifi.
2007-03-16T09:05:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	You're on Dapper, right?
2007-03-16T09:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	Scorched	I have compiz running, but it's still a bit buggy.
