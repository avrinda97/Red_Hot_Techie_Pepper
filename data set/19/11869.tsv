2006-09-18T15:11:00.000Z	Alucard		I'm wanting to know how to install a .gz file?
2006-09-18T15:11:00.000Z	Alucard		I downloaded avi player and like most things I download it's just sitting on my desktop.
2006-09-18T15:11:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	you need to unarchive it
2006-09-18T15:11:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	it's like a .zip file
2006-09-18T15:12:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	under gnome, right click the files and hit "extract here"
2006-09-18T15:12:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	you might have to compile from source
2006-09-18T15:13:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	 in the directory you just made, is there a file called "configure"?
2006-09-18T15:17:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	ok, now cd to the directory you just made by extracting those files
2006-09-18T15:18:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	you in the directory yet?
2006-09-18T15:20:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	no, type into the terminal "cd (the directory)" with no sudo, no quotes, and no parentheses
2006-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	how are you doing?
2006-09-18T15:22:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	and...?
2006-09-18T15:25:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	so you exrtracted the files to a new folder on your desktop?
2006-09-18T15:29:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	"cd ~/Desktop/avi/avi-xmms-1.2.3"
2006-09-18T15:30:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	a buncha text should go past
2006-09-18T15:31:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	tell me when it's done, and if there are any errors
2006-09-18T15:31:00.000Z	briguyd	Alucard	it says what isnt installed?
