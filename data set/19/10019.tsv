2006-08-19T15:58:00.000Z	digital__		how do I umount /var?
2006-08-19T15:58:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	haha, that should do it
2006-08-19T15:59:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	It doesn't work!
2006-08-19T15:59:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	be more specific please
2006-08-19T15:59:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	as in, are there errors? what happens...is /var mounted?
2006-08-19T15:59:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	I'm in single user mode. I tried "umount /var" and it says the device is busy.
2006-08-19T16:00:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	use lsof to see what files are open in /var
2006-08-19T16:00:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	then kill all processes that are using those files
2006-08-19T16:00:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	OK
2006-08-20T16:03:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	lsof doesn't show anything open for /var
2006-08-20T16:04:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	how about fuser -cuk /var ?
2006-08-20T16:05:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	nothing!
2006-08-20T16:05:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	cd / then try to umount it
2006-08-20T16:06:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	and make sure you are only logged in on one terminal
2006-08-20T16:07:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	"device is busy"
2006-08-20T16:12:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	yes
2006-08-20T16:12:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	OK, so if I comment out /var in fstab and boot single user I should have no /var?
2006-08-20T16:12:00.000Z	verbose	digital__	you will have a /var, it will just be on the same partition as /
2006-08-20T16:13:00.000Z	digital__	verbose	I'll try it out on my laptop
