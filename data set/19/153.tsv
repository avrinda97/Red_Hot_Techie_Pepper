2012-08-07T08:07:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	still there?
2012-08-07T07:52:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	can u elaborate on that?
2012-08-07T07:55:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	well, i must that if u can't open www.faceshit.com you're a lucky person
2012-08-07T07:55:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	now, what error message do you see?
2012-08-07T07:55:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	which browser do you use?
2012-08-07T07:57:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	from where are you trying to access those sites? sometimes net administrators puts a proxy to filter people access to internet and to block such sites
2012-08-07T07:57:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	some examples could be a school, an institute and so on
2012-08-07T07:57:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	not a firewall, a proxy
2012-08-07T07:58:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	ok, so you're browsing the net with a notebook
2012-08-07T08:08:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	hey, let's see, are you connected wired to the net?
2012-08-07T08:09:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	please open a console and do: $ cat /etc/hosts and tell me if you see facebook.com there
2012-08-07T08:11:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	no wat, /etc/hosts must be there, try again
2012-08-07T08:13:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	well, you have a fairly default hosts file so facebook isn't blocked thru it
2012-08-07T08:14:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	moving next: can it be your ISP is blocking those sites? when was the last time you could succefully access those sites?
2012-08-07T08:15:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	there are multiple vector to take care when debugging such issues, but in this very case we can basically narrow them to a few:
2012-08-07T08:16:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	1. proxy or firewall (you already said that's not the problem), 2. host file (we just saw it's clean), 3. browser: may be a recent update broke something?
2012-08-07T08:17:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	did you try accessing with another browser? are you using any plugin that _potentially_ could block your web access?
2012-08-07T08:18:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	ok, let's go dirty, first things first: please switch to a console and write: $ ping www.facebook.com
2012-08-07T08:18:00.000Z	Guest84917	reasearcher123	let' be sure that we can actually access the site
