2009-05-20T02:21:00.000Z	Stargazer		I'm using an nVidia driver for my graphics card and for some reason i can't pull a window from one LCD to another. any ideas?
2009-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	Stargazer	What view type did you choose when you ran `sudo nvidia-settings` , did you choose Twin-View?
2009-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	yes.
2009-05-20T02:25:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	you were saying before raylu chirped in ?
2009-05-20T02:26:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	i can.
2009-05-20T02:26:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	i can navigate my pointer to either screen except when dragging a window.
2009-05-20T02:29:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	any ideas?
2009-05-20T02:30:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	Stargazer	so when draggin the window it just stop's you at the screen border? .. I'm trying to get one of my test systems to replicate this .. botch monitor's are same resolution right ?
2009-05-20T02:30:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	both monitors are not the same resolution but i do resize the window before dragging it.
2009-05-20T02:32:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	Stargazer	pastebin your xorg.conf please ?
2009-05-20T02:33:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	it's been a while since i've used ubuntu deeply, where is x.org located?

2009-05-20T02:42:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	anything yet ?
2009-05-20T02:44:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	?
2009-05-20T02:44:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	Stargazer	Sorry , I was doing a bit of reading touching up on xorg.conf config's... had to dust off a book ~ I don't see anything that should be stopping you from doing this.. just out of pure pure pure curiosity, drag the window the opposite direction from where the LCD is , see if your #0 #1 are wrong ~
2009-05-20T02:45:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	nope. I know my other monitor is digitally positioned correctly because i can move my mouse in that direction and it appears in the next monitor.
2009-05-20T02:46:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	Stargazer	K, I'm kind of at a loss atm, nothing I can find or think of should be stopping you .
2009-05-20T02:47:00.000Z	Stargazer	Trojaneyez	out curiosity... should my pointer be left behind on one monitor while another pointer is on the other?
2009-05-20T02:47:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	Stargazer	no
