2009-11-12T17:22:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	hey dude what up
2009-11-12T17:23:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	I have some problem with compiz as well, When i shut down the ubuntu, it says "The screen is not composited"
2009-11-12T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	not sure, ask in #compiz
2009-11-18T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	that is the windows decorator, are you using desktop effects?
2009-11-18T16:43:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	yes
2009-11-18T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	gues how i knew ;), try turning them off: alt+f2     then type:  metacity --replace
2009-11-18T16:44:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	You are the man dude, that worked like magic, do u know what i must have done?
2009-11-18T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	you need to run ccsm and maybe add the windows decorators there, you have disabled desktop effects right now, you can try: compiz --replace    see if they are back, but ccsm has a mention of window decorators
2009-11-18T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	i'd ask in #compiz tbh
2009-11-18T16:48:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	but thats crazy dude, all my desktop effects are gone as well!! (the compiz room is silent and no replys), is this a virus or something?
2009-11-18T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	no, just bad settings. If you run: compiz --replace    you will get the effects back but maybe no window decorators
2009-11-25T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	diferent rendering engine
2009-11-25T17:34:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	do u know how i can solve it?
2009-11-25T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	it will be different in webkit based browsers too
2009-11-25T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	you can't really, its how IE reads and interprets then displays the data unless you can find reg / config hacks
2009-11-25T17:35:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	lol, i cant do that
2009-11-25T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	then you are stuck
2009-11-25T17:37:00.000Z	mrXX	ActionParsnip	is there no simple trick to make the image work in both IE and Firefox : background: #000 url("logo.png")no-repeat;
2009-11-25T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrXX	not sure, try in #html
