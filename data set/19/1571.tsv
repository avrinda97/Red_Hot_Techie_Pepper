2010-12-20T08:42:00.000Z	Inphernal		Hi, I'm trying to install Morrowind with Wine 1.3.9 from a .iso image. If I mount the .iso I get an error before setup even launches, if I burn it and try from there I get error "please insert disc 0 that contains the file data3.cab" about halfway through installation. There is no data3.cab

2010-12-20T08:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	did you check the appdb?
2010-12-20T10:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	does the appdb say anything about it?
2010-12-20T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	did you read the text blow the bit it saying gold, it does occasionally have little hints on how to make it nice
2010-12-20T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	have you also asked i 'winehq
2010-12-20T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	#winehq
2010-12-20T10:30:00.000Z	Inphernal	ActionParsnip	the extra text solves problems post installation, I saw nothing similar to my problem. I will ask in that channel, didn't know how to bring up a channel list haha, thank you
2010-12-20T10:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	np bro

2011-03-13T01:39:00.000Z	Inphernal	ActionParsnip	I have an external HD with about 50-100gb of backup data, but the disk is messing up. I'm trying to copy the contents to my XP computer, and it keeps stopping a little into it complaining it cannot copy the files cause the file names are too long. Any recommendations as to what I could do to save my data before I send the disk in?
2011-03-13T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	what file system is the external storage using?
2011-03-13T01:41:00.000Z	Inphernal	ActionParsnip	NTFS
2011-03-13T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	should be ok, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntfs
2011-03-13T01:42:00.000Z	Inphernal	ActionParsnip	Will Ubuntu not complain about the file name lengths?
2011-03-13T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Inphernal	ntfs has limits, listed on that page
2011-03-13T01:43:00.000Z	Inphernal	ActionParsnip	Ok, I'll give it a try. Thank you
