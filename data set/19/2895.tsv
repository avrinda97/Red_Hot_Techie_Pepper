2012-04-28T13:03:00.000Z	RyanB		Ok. Nothing actually but it needs a log on to a website. Each time you try to download the file, it gives a new ID number. I am connecting to another server using PuTTY. I don't have
2012-04-28T13:03:00.000Z	RyanB		VNC access to otherwise access it.
2012-04-28T13:04:00.000Z	RyanB		So, is it possible to download files with variable download IDs using putty when SSHing to another server without VNC access?
2012-04-28T13:04:00.000Z	RyanB		It's http, not ftp by the way.
2012-04-28T13:05:00.000Z	RyanB		Ok in putty, you have a command called wget. I am trying to use that std0s
2012-04-28T13:05:00.000Z	RyanB		I am trying to use wget to download a file onto the server.
2012-04-28T13:06:00.000Z	RyanB		Ok. Let me give you an example. Filename.avi?id=12456. That number changes each time I try to download via a regular browser _xan_ .
2012-04-28T13:07:00.000Z	RyanB		So, it's possible in putty to specify login and then download the file?
2012-04-28T13:07:00.000Z	RyanB		but I don't want to get it through my browser
2012-04-28T13:07:00.000Z	RyanB		I want to download it on my server.
2012-04-28T13:07:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	in general a scheme like that is because the website wants you to use a browser...and won't let you get it without one
2012-04-28T13:08:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	why not download the file on our own system and then copy it to the destination?
2012-04-28T13:08:00.000Z	RyanB	ssta	my upload speed is really slow
2012-04-28T13:08:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	it's not trivial...(almost) everything is possible
2012-04-28T13:09:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	try it in links2 (a text based web browser)
2012-04-28T13:10:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	if it's alerady installed, yes.  Umm, if it's "your" server then why not?
2012-04-28T13:12:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	yeah, that's to make sure you only download it from a web broswer that you've signed in on.  I doubt you'll be able to get the file with wget
2012-04-28T13:14:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	put the url in "", it will give you the file (in this one particular case)
2012-04-28T13:21:00.000Z	ssta	RyanB	not on a server install no...a GUI browser would be unusual
