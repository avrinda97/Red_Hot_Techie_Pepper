2008-08-01T22:07:00.000Z	mbrigdan		is there a way I can use apt to force a program to give me its configuration screen again?
2008-08-01T22:08:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	dpkg-reconfigure package
2008-08-01T22:10:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	inactive?
2008-08-01T22:11:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	uswsusp thinks my swap is "inactive" and not valid. But I barely ever get into swap memory unless I'm doing something rather intensive, so I think this might be causing it?
2008-08-01T22:12:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	inactive means not mounted for use I think
2008-08-01T22:12:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	doesn't swap mount by default?
2008-08-01T22:13:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	in theory it should. Type free and see if you have as much swap space as you think
2008-08-01T22:15:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	What unit does free display its memory in?
2008-08-01T22:16:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	kilobytes iirc
2008-08-01T22:18:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	hmm, seems that I do have as much swap as I know I have. But it also seems that free disagrees about the amount of memory in use when compared to the system monitor.
2008-08-01T22:20:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	alsactl names
2008-08-01T22:20:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	that needs sudo right?
2008-08-01T22:21:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	sorry that wsnt meant for you
2008-08-01T22:39:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	swapon -s
2008-08-01T22:43:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	I went ahead with installing uswsusp even with the "your swap is inactive" and it seems that bad things happened.
2008-08-01T22:43:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	swapon -a
2008-08-01T22:43:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	that should mount all available swap
2008-08-01T22:46:00.000Z	mbrigdan	MikeSeth	Did that, i'm going to try the -r option to force it to use the correct swap partition, see if that works, although I think I might have booted ubuntu with noacpi, so I don't know if this will work
2008-08-01T22:46:00.000Z	MikeSeth	mbrigdan	noacpi shouldnt influence swap in any way
