2011-08-23T19:27:00.000Z	Xaiphan		Hey guy's, is it ok to ask Ubuntu related questions here or should i pop over to the beginner chat?
2011-08-23T19:29:00.000Z	Xaiphan		I installed Ubuntu 11.04 to a 8GB Flash drive, i used 4GB(the max) for reserved space? so that i could have room to treat it like a side OS, well after updates and nothing else i am getting "Not enough Space" warnings
2011-08-23T19:31:00.000Z	Xaiphan		There wasn't an option to go larger than 4028MB
2011-08-23T19:32:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	maybe you need to clean package cache (/var/cache/apt/archives/) via sudo apt-get clean
2011-08-23T19:33:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	but have a look how much space you have left after cleaning that, guess not much then :P
2011-08-23T19:45:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	persistent file size for storing changes sounds confusing, more like reserved space as separate partition?
2011-08-23T19:47:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	as this is optional i guess it's just that, you have 8gig and the option says keep 4g for something else?
2011-08-23T19:51:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	hmm so you have enough space there? what does df -h say?
2011-08-23T19:53:00.000Z	Xaiphan	dc5ala	- it breaks it down further, /dev/loop0 size is 665M, and 100%, i have alto of info here if you wanted soemthing specific
2011-08-23T19:54:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	you can put that in http://paste.ubuntu.com
2011-08-23T19:59:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	so i guess that program you used just reserved 4GB on the stick, have a look at the partitions there
2011-08-23T20:00:00.000Z	Xaiphan	dc5ala	Is that not what i want? i notice it's using 80%, and i did select for it to use the maximum partition space
2011-08-23T20:02:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	at the moment it looks like it's just unused space, have a look at it with gparted or fdisk/cfdisk
2011-08-23T20:04:00.000Z	Xaiphan	dc5ala	it does not show up in Gparted
2011-08-23T20:06:00.000Z	Xaiphan	dc5ala	ok it says Size: 7.47GiB | Used 4.70GiB (63%) | Unused 2.77 GiB (37%) - that is a tone of usage for only having installed recommended updates.
2011-08-23T20:08:00.000Z	Xaiphan	dc5ala	Is there a more proper way to install Ubuntu 11.04 to a USB and make it act as a HDD? That utility is causing mroe problems than anything, this is just disk usage, i haven't even started about the error's i keep recieveing
2011-08-23T20:09:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	Ubuntu also has it's own tool similar to the one you used, you may want to reduce the reserved space for storing changes then, 4G for system is not that much
2011-08-23T20:11:00.000Z	dc5ala	Xaiphan	with that size you need to clean up often, remove old kernels etc. or remove software you won't use
2011-08-23T20:12:00.000Z	Xaiphan	dc5ala	is it possible for me to 1:1 with you? I would feel much better about sharing my uses and what i wish to occomplish using linux 1:1
