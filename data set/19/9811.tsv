2006-09-11T10:50:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	Legacy driver
2006-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	Yes you do need nvidia-glx. My bad I thought those had been pushed to legacy.
2006-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	thats why last install froze "wrong driver"
2006-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	Your motheroard has onboard graphics?
2006-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	The GF is a card you have added?
2006-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	unfortunately
2006-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	yes, a old 400 64 meg card i have
2006-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	You have disabled the onboard adaptor how?
2006-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	onboard is active in bio's, can only disable it there
2006-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	but even disabled "ubuntu" will boot to the onboard and not see the card
2006-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	here i get lost installed the glx driver, but what kernel module do i get
2006-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	Is there a jumper on the motherboard to diable the onboard adptor?
2006-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	no jumper
2006-09-11T11:01:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	You need to have nvidia-common and nvidia-glx installed
2006-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	They are the modules required. All other kernel modules are handled by other packaged and should be already installed.
2006-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	Non-free Linux 2.6.15 modules on 386 that module then ?
2006-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	philwyett	iceman	Yes
2006-09-11T11:08:00.000Z	iceman	philwyett	well time to try a reboot "again"
