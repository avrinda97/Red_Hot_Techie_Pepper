2008-11-28T22:00:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	no, i want to mount partition so that only one specified user has access to it
2008-11-28T22:00:00.000Z	sipior	apastinen	set permissions accordingly
2008-11-28T22:00:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	without any other stages
2008-11-28T22:01:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	i must happend in mount
2008-11-28T22:01:00.000Z	sipior	apastinen	well, it's not going to :-)
2008-11-28T22:01:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	sad..
2008-11-28T22:02:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	i have parition in LVM to reserved for backups, and if i need to restart the server, i want permission to set up automatically
2008-11-28T22:03:00.000Z	sipior	apastinen	why does that need to have the permissions of a specific user?
2008-11-28T22:04:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	i want that only my backup daemon has RW access to it
2008-11-28T22:04:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	.. and because there is no need for other users to read it
2008-11-28T22:05:00.000Z	sipior	apastinen	and why doesn't that work if you set the ownership of the mount point correctly?
2008-11-28T22:05:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	well.. wait a second..
2008-11-28T22:05:00.000Z	sipior	apastinen	or better, simply create a directory below the mount point, owned by your backup daemon
2008-11-28T22:06:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	http://pastebin.com/m46b8fab
2008-11-28T22:07:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	ok, that should do it..
2008-11-28T22:07:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	thnx
2008-11-28T22:08:00.000Z	sipior	apastinen	did that work?
2008-11-28T22:08:00.000Z	apastinen	sipior	i will make different directory after mount point, it should do it.. it not the solution which i was searching but i can live with it :)
