2010-05-09T00:23:00.000Z	steelbox		sorry for my low english level
2010-05-09T00:23:00.000Z	steelbox		I got some noise in my speakers
2010-05-09T00:23:00.000Z	steelbox		it's periodic
2010-05-09T00:24:00.000Z	steelbox		and it happens even without playing any audio/video files
2010-05-09T00:25:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	steelbox	go to system>preferences>sound , click on the hardware tab, and change the device profile to one  until you find one that works
2010-05-09T00:25:00.000Z	steelbox	cabbrick1243	hum okay I can try
2010-05-09T00:26:00.000Z	steelbox	cabbrick1243	okay but hardware tab is empty
2010-05-09T00:28:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	steelbox	wow... don't know much to help with that.. you may need a better driver... your running lucid right? go on the forums and search for pulse audio drivers.. i remember reading about that when my sound card was giving me trouble
2010-05-09T00:33:00.000Z	steelbox	cabbrick1243	so my hardware tab is empty
2010-05-09T00:35:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	steelbox	yea, i'm probably not the right person for this, but you do need to find your pulse audio driver for the device if it is registered there
2010-05-09T00:36:00.000Z	steelbox	cabbrick1243	okay and how can I find it?
2010-05-09T00:37:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	steelbox	err, (embarrasement) i did find an article in the forums once on it. Try searching them for sound drivers
2010-05-09T00:39:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	steelbox	so sorry i'm not much help, as i have not to much with Ubuntu either
2010-05-09T00:40:00.000Z	steelbox	cabbrick1243	okay
