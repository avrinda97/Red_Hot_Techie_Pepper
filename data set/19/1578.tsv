2010-12-17T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	Mary-Jane	you're making very little sense.  You need to take a few minutes and collect your thoughts.  Then summarize exactly what your issue is on exactly ONE line.  If you have logs or errors that you want to share include them in a pastebin

2010-12-17T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	Mary-Jane	you need to answer my question before we can help you.
2010-12-17T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	Mary-Jane	you said all videos.  Surely that includes one that's not porn.
2010-12-17T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	Mary-Jane	stop.  If you can't provide a sfw example, then we can't help you.
