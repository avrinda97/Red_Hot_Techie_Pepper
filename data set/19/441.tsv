2012-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	L3top		I didn't expect that was your issue, I just don't understand your issue savask
2012-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	L3top		lol...
2012-05-01T14:12:00.000Z	savask	L3top	Thanks, still.
2012-05-01T14:12:00.000Z	L3top		ok... then just open chrome several times and view the end of the dmesg log.
2012-05-01T14:13:00.000Z	L3top		oh... savask...
2012-05-01T14:14:00.000Z	L3top	savask	dpkg -r big-long*.deb;
2012-05-01T14:15:00.000Z	L3top	savask	sudo dpkg -r big-long*.deb; sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-current; sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau would be my next attempt
2012-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	savask	L3top	Okay. Btw, big-long*, not big-long*.deb
2012-05-01T14:17:00.000Z	L3top		I always surround globs with patterns... just cause.
2012-05-01T14:19:00.000Z	L3top		ok I need a little sleep... what happened to padhu?
2012-05-01T14:20:00.000Z	L3top		I will just wait.

2012-05-01T14:20:00.000Z	L3top		should be around 80% yes?
2012-05-01T14:22:00.000Z	savask	L3top	Nah, doesn't work.
2012-05-01T14:24:00.000Z	L3top		so... about 80% :P
2012-05-01T14:25:00.000Z	L3top		savask... I really hate letting the machine win.
2012-05-01T14:25:00.000Z	savask	L3top	Yeah. But you're not a machine ;-P
