2008-01-24T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	danny	look into R, it's a free S
2008-01-24T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	danny	http://www.r-project.org/ is the website and 'r-base' is the relevant package to install
2008-03-22T20:32:00.000Z	danny	jrib	 thanks :]
2008-03-22T20:34:00.000Z	jrib	danny	did you install the package the wiki said to install?
2008-03-22T20:40:00.000Z	jrib	danny	why aren't you using the gui like the wiki says?
2008-03-22T20:41:00.000Z	jrib	danny	never mind, I misread
2008-03-22T20:42:00.000Z	danny	jrib	yeah, you have to do it through terminal ://
2008-05-04T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	danny	did you install epiphany-browser?
2008-05-04T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	danny	restart your panel?
2008-05-04T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	danny	does 'epiphany' in cli open it?
2008-05-04T01:39:00.000Z	danny	jrib	crl alt backspace and epiphany is in its place now. :) thanks
