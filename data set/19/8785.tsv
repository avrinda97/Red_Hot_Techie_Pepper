2007-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	Dimensions		Hiya which one of *buntu is lighter version but stable ?
2007-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	6.06 dapper
2007-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	Dimensions	m_billybob	 thats heavy ... i guess
2007-02-21T06:07:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	elaborate, base install is ~400MB
2007-02-21T06:07:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	as far as stability, its pretty dahmed stable
2007-02-21T06:08:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	from what I recal, of what I read, you neeed a LiveCD version, thats abotu al i know about that
2007-02-21T06:09:00.000Z	Dimensions	m_billybob	 i need persistent one ...
2007-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	i would suggest googling to find a howto perhaps, I know its possible (i think for what you'redoing) but i couldnt tell you how exactly
2007-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	Dimensions	m_billybob	 i have installed slax and puppy linux ... but they are not of what i want ... i need all libraries of C++ and mobile etc ... but they are far smaller ...
2007-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	also, now that I do remember more, from what i remember, a lto of people use knoppix, even for a persistant install
2007-02-21T06:12:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	knoppix is debian based, so . . .
2007-02-21T06:13:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	that would be hdxx or sdxx
2007-02-21T06:15:00.000Z	Dimensions	m_billybob	 yeah ... my usb by default has sda 2.1 GB and sdb 1mb (sdb has MBR ?)
2007-02-21T06:16:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	hmm perhaps grub has issues instal the botloader on the USB device ?
2007-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	what file system is on the USB drive ? some BIOSes wil have issue booting a USB device (thrumb) if its anything other than FAT
2007-02-21T06:23:00.000Z	Dimensions	m_billybob	 for trying out *buntu i tried ext3 but for puppy linux and Slax i had FAT ...
2007-02-21T06:23:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	either way, I would reccomend you research it further using google -> USB <distro> install ,-- or somethign similar
2007-02-21T06:24:00.000Z	m_billybob	Dimensions	its not exactly an easy thing to do, this coming fro ma person, such as myself, that has been mucking aroudn with computers since 81-82 . . .
2007-02-21T06:35:00.000Z	Dimensions	m_billybob	 and verbose: http://www.pastebin.ca/365508 .... i have pasted sda and sdb ...
