2006-11-01T12:01:00.000Z	dnite	alakazamz0r	did u add the other resolutions u want to use to the right section? Maybe try the gnome preferences -> resolution setting
2006-11-01T12:07:00.000Z	alakazamz0r		ok
2006-11-01T12:07:00.000Z	alakazamz0r		that drivers absolutely trash
2006-11-01T12:07:00.000Z	alakazamz0r		nesides putting NVidia in the driver line, and having my V and H sync correct... what else could cause the problem?!
2006-11-01T12:08:00.000Z	dnite	alakazamz0r	nvidia, not NVidia
2006-11-01T12:08:00.000Z	alakazamz0r	dnite	thats what it is...
2006-11-01T12:08:00.000Z	alakazamz0r		i'll put it in a pastebin
2006-11-01T12:08:00.000Z	dnite	alakazamz0r	 case matters

2006-11-01T12:11:00.000Z	dnite	alakazamz0r	looks fine to me, maybe try and remove the BusID line.. what error are you getting? or is it just not setting the resolution right for u?
2006-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	alakazamz0r	dnite	yes
2006-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	alakazamz0r		not setting the resolution right
2006-11-01T12:13:00.000Z	dnite	alakazamz0r	paste your /var/log/Xorg.log
