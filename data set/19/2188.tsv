2010-06-07T07:09:00.000Z	thune3	Zeu5	your mountpoint is wrong, when you mount normally, what is the mountpoint?
2010-06-07T07:10:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: i think i know where i usually mount it in
2010-06-07T07:11:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: i nticed when i try to unmount from the desktop, it says /media/32D4C784D4C748B5
2010-06-07T07:11:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: so the mount point is /media/ correct?
2010-06-07T07:11:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: so the mount point is /media/ or just /media ?
2010-06-07T07:12:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: i see. thanks . sorry if i messaged all 3 of u.
2010-06-07T07:14:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: when i typed cat * /media/32D4C784D4C748B5 is not in there
2010-06-07T07:14:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: so final advice is to create new folder called /mnt/datadrive
2010-06-07T07:15:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: and use that as mount point yes?
2010-06-07T07:15:00.000Z	thune3	Zeu5	that would work, then use that for fstab and point transmission there (though the resume on tranmission would probably be broken again initially)
2010-06-07T07:16:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: but where do i create the folder? inside /home?
2010-06-07T07:18:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: yes i understand i need to create /mnt/datadrive. my question is where is this /mnt/datadrive should be? its a d drive in my windows
2010-06-07T07:18:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: sorry i dont quite understand the term partition, but if you are saying that it is a logical drive created when i installed windows, then yes
2010-06-07T07:19:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: oh absolutepath. okie i got it
2010-06-07T07:21:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: do i have to restart my computer? because right now the d drive is mounted and i think its using the wrong mount point. and i cannot unmount it.. saying something abt me not being root
2010-06-07T07:22:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: yes its correct. i used sudo blkdisk as indicated by the documentation
2010-06-07T07:22:00.000Z	Zeu5	thune3	R3cur51v3 , edbian: do i have to restart my computer? because right now the d drive is mounted and i think its using the wrong mount point. and i cannot unmount it.. saying something abt me not being root
