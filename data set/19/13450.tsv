2005-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	wireless?
2005-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	No, wired.
2005-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	what card?
2005-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	using DNS?
2005-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	that module loaded?
2005-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	I have a dhcp server available, though I'd rather set a static address.
2005-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	lsmod | grep 3c59x
2005-04-26T16:48:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	ahh, ok... /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/network/interfaces are correct?
2005-04-26T16:48:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	can you ping localhost?
2005-04-26T16:49:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	There is no /etc/resolv.conf, though oddly there's a directory called /etc/resolvconf
2005-04-26T16:49:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	"Network unreachable" pinging even localhost.
2005-04-26T16:49:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	/etc/network/interfaces has no entries, not even for localhost.
2005-04-26T16:49:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	ahh... I don't have a resolv.conf either... breezy? working prior to breezy?
2005-04-26T16:52:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	I could just edit resolv.conf on my own and probably get it working.  But I was hoping that a normal user could get ubuntu up on one of these laptops without being an ubergeek.
2005-04-26T16:52:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	are you running breezy currently though?
2005-04-26T16:53:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	Sorry, I didn't understand that question.  Is breezy the next after hoary?  This is the hoary release CD.
2005-04-26T16:56:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	what was the last thing you said to me?
2005-04-26T16:57:00.000Z	akk	lunitik	That I'm running the hoary release cd.  I don't know what breezy is -- is it next after hoary?
2005-04-26T16:57:00.000Z	lunitik	akk	yeah... I though I had a /etc/resolv.conf prior to upgrade... guess not
