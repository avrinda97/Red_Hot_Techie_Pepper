2010-09-26T23:53:00.000Z	martez89		hey, my acer 5542 shuts down on heavy cpu, i googled and it probably has something to do with overheating
2010-09-26T23:54:00.000Z	martez89		how can i make sure it doesnt overheat because of the fans not turning on
2010-09-26T23:55:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	update to the newest bios, acer had an issue with a bunch of laptops where the fans weren't running correctly, they issued bios updates to fix the problem, had the same type of problem with my netbook
2010-09-26T23:56:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	i will try that
2010-09-26T23:56:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	what video card driver do you use?
2010-09-26T23:59:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	the default intel driver ubuntu autodetects, not had any issues with video that made me look at it
2010-09-27T00:01:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	ok because i read somewhere it only happened with open source drivers. do you have any problems after BIOS update?
2010-09-27T00:01:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	nope, updated the bios and my netbook runs cooler now
2010-09-27T00:03:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	did you update the BIOS from ubuntu?
2010-09-27T00:04:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	no I booted freedos, I have a freedos setup in my grub menu for running dos stuff
2010-09-27T00:05:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	like this? http://macles.blogspot.com/2008/07/flashing-bios.html
2010-09-27T00:06:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	sort of, that one is for the acer linux, not ubuntu
2010-09-27T00:08:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	I will google how to update BIOS on a acer 5542 from ubuntu, because thats my only OS
2010-09-27T00:09:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	you can't, the flash program won't run in ubuntu, you have to boot a windows or dos OS
2010-09-27T00:12:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	i can make a freedos flash drive right?
2010-09-27T00:13:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	it's a floppy image file, easier to just set grub to boot the floppy image you can download, but I think you can make a usb drive boot freedos too, not sure since I used the floppy image

2010-09-27T00:14:00.000Z	Dulak	martez89	that's almost exactly what I did
2010-09-27T00:16:00.000Z	martez89	Dulak	thanks ill try that
