2008-11-07T05:47:00.000Z	sysdoc		?
2008-11-07T05:49:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	I had to download vmware-server.
2008-11-07T05:49:00.000Z	sysdoc	modpauper	from the vmware site??
2008-11-07T05:49:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	Yeah, because the download required a serial number and registration.
2008-11-07T05:50:00.000Z	sysdoc	modpauper	U used ver 2?
2008-11-07T05:50:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	Also, if you're using Ibex, I believe you need to update to the latest vmware-server release
2008-11-07T05:50:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	Yeah, 2.
2008-11-07T05:51:00.000Z	sysdoc	modpauper	using this tut http://www.squidoo.com/use-existing-windows-installation-and-apps-in-ubuntu
2008-11-07T05:53:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	Are you trying to boot an existing windows partition with vmware from within ubuntu, or create a new windows virtual machine from within ubuntu?
2008-11-07T05:53:00.000Z	sysdoc	modpauper	yea existing Xp
2008-11-07T05:56:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	In beta, vm server 2 didn't support booting from an existing partition, if my memory is right.  So you'll find that older tutorials mention that ability when in server 2 (beta -- I haven't tried the latest release -- notes are online at: http://www.vmware.com/support/server2/doc/releasenotes_vmserver2.html)
2008-11-07T05:57:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	What I meant was, the tutorials show the option to boot from an existing partition, but in server 2 beta the option didn't exist.  I'd check the release notes, download 2 from vmware's site, install it and find out for yourself
2008-11-07T05:57:00.000Z	sysdoc	modpauper	u rock dewd!! thanks
2008-11-07T05:57:00.000Z	modpauper	sysdoc	No problem.  Good luck. :)
