2011-07-11T13:25:00.000Z	Jake556778		how can i do it on ubuntu
2011-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	Jake556778		ok np just tell me
2011-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	Jake556778		let say i want it as a FTP server
2011-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	Jake556778		nothing els should connect to it
2011-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	Jake556778		or HTTP server
2011-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	Jake556778		for security i want only 1 port open
2011-07-11T13:27:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	1st you want to read about "ports" and how to configure services
2011-07-11T13:27:00.000Z	Jake556778	llutz	i've been using windows for more than 15 yrs
2011-07-11T13:28:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	i had a cat for 12 yrs. so what?
2011-07-11T13:28:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	 <Chipzzz> Jake556778: ports are closed by default... if you don't install a server to listen to a port, it won't be open
2011-07-11T13:28:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	this is linux
2011-07-11T13:31:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	its btter to read about "ports" and how to configure services _before_ using stuff to "close ports".
2011-07-11T13:32:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	wrong order :)
2011-07-11T13:32:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	you don't want a "firewall" as a 1st step at all
2011-07-11T13:33:00.000Z	llutz	Jake556778	you want to learn to configure your system to gain security.
