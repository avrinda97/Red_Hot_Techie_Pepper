2008-04-25T22:43:00.000Z	StevenX	mut80r	I don't see the gutsy backports there in 8.04 anymore.

2008-04-26T00:07:00.000Z	mut80r	StevenX	do you have access to the GUI?
2008-04-26T00:07:00.000Z	StevenX	mut80r	yes
2008-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	mut80r	StevenX	System -> Prererences -> Power management
2008-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	StevenX	mut80r	I went there. The option is not there.
2008-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	mut80r	StevenX	laptop I assume ?
2008-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	StevenX	mut80r	yes
2008-04-26T00:09:00.000Z	mut80r	StevenX	"On Battery Power" tab, Reduce display brightness checkbox.
2008-04-26T00:21:00.000Z	StevenX	mut80r	interesting. all i had to do was hold the alt button. but i don't have the brightness option in the normal dialog.

2008-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	StevenX	mut80r	but you see how I don't have a GUI option for increasing brightness?
2008-04-26T00:27:00.000Z	mut80r	StevenX	neither do I. but with that set by default it kept turning mine down.
2008-04-26T00:27:00.000Z	mut80r	StevenX	that's why I suggested disabling it.
