2005-11-20T14:53:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	Have you tried gdesklets? May be you will find something useful in it.
2005-11-20T14:54:00.000Z	Steinbeck1	onkarshinde	no i havent but ill look it up
2005-11-20T14:55:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	AFAIK. gDesklets is something similar to dashbord widgets on MAC OS X. There are plenty of them avialable in repos. You can also install additional.
2005-11-20T14:55:00.000Z	Steinbeck1	onkarshinde	are they buggy?
2005-11-20T14:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	Actually gdesklets run in their own environment so even if they crash they won't harm any of your open applications.
2005-11-20T14:58:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	I just discovered gdesklets yesterday and I liked them very much. You can keep running more than one on your desktop in a floating layer. You press Shift+F12 and they come forward of all apps.
2005-11-20T15:00:00.000Z	Steinbeck1	onkarshinde	im sorry im pretty new to linux
2005-11-20T15:00:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	Instead of download use synaptic
2005-11-20T15:22:00.000Z	Steinbeck1	onkarshinde	I have it installed but everytime i try to run a gdisklet it tells me it cant find a sensor
2005-11-20T06:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	How are you trying to install it?
2005-11-20T06:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	which ati card?
2005-11-20T06:42:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Steinbeck1	Did you try fglrx driver that can be installed from repos?
