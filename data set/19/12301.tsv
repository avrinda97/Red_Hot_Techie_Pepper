2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	blank	holycow	yes, thanks, but I mean the...oh...I thought gdesklets was only the toolbar at the bottom
2005-11-15T08:55:00.000Z	holycow	blank	not really, there is no reason you shouldn't run debian tho, it will shed some perspective on the situation for you
2005-11-15T08:58:00.000Z	holycow	blank	ubuntu is just debian with gnome and some patches
2005-11-15T09:00:00.000Z	holycow	blank	there are no such thing as 'easy transition' distros
2005-11-15T09:01:00.000Z	blank	holycow	I ment things like, the ones where they make it look like windows
2005-11-15T09:04:00.000Z	holycow	blank	ubuntus chief differentiation is that they freeze debian every 6 months and then polish it up with pure muscle and marks money
2005-11-15T09:07:00.000Z	holycow	blank	well you are copying files from one users dir to another
2005-11-15T09:08:00.000Z	holycow	blank	give it time, it's fine to use win, or mac or whatever
