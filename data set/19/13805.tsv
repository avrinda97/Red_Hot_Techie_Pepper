2005-02-19T09:42:00.000Z	lavigj		hey guys, quick question. What's the best way to share files between *nix boxes over a network? I found out how to setup SFTP folders in gnome, but I know there has to be a way for mounting a remote filesystem as if it were your own.
2005-02-19T09:42:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	nfs is probably your best bet, its what i use for the computers on my network
2005-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	ok. I will have to look at that
2005-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	does ubuntu have support built in?
2005-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	mmmm you may have to install nfs-utils, but otehr than that it should have it
2005-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	cool.
2005-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	just do "cat /proc/filesystems" and look for nfs
2005-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	thanks man, it is much easier to get a push in the right direction from someone who is already there :)
2005-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	no problem :) might join me in #lfd, lots of friendly people that know stuff like that ;)
2005-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	lfd? linux for dummies? :)
2005-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	you got it ;)
2005-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	will do. and crap, looks like a kernel recompile for me
2005-02-19T09:46:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	hmmm not so quicik
2005-02-19T09:46:00.000Z	|rufius|	lavigj	you need to install "nfs-common"
2005-02-19T09:47:00.000Z	lavigj	|rufius|	gotcha
