2008-12-20T10:17:00.000Z	MHz128		how do I start the SSH server?
2008-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	did you install ssh via apt-get?
2008-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	MHz128	firefly2442	ya, openssh-server
2008-12-20T10:18:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	it should already be running as a daemon, can you connect?
2008-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	MHz128	firefly2442	i have both machines connected via UTP cable.... network manager says theyre connected, but ssh 192.x.x.x says no route to host
2008-12-20T10:20:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	can you ping from each machine?
2008-12-20T10:20:00.000Z	MHz128	firefly2442	no, ping is unreachable... :P
2008-12-20T10:20:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	I would try fixing that first... um, any more details?
2008-12-20T10:23:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	you have a crossover ethernet cable or something else?
2008-12-20T10:24:00.000Z	MHz128	firefly2442	crossover
2008-12-20T10:24:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	you should be able to just give a local IP to each machine (static, e.g. 192.168.1.100....)
2008-12-20T10:25:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	go into the network manager
2008-12-20T10:25:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	ok, static right? not DHCP?
2008-12-20T10:25:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	yep
2008-12-20T10:26:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	I would say try running "ifconfig" on each machine and make sure the IP address took
2008-12-20T10:26:00.000Z	MHz128	firefly2442	can i set the IP manually using ifconfig
2008-12-20T10:27:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	it's possible yes
2008-12-20T10:28:00.000Z	MHz128	firefly2442	yes, both I{
2008-12-20T10:30:00.000Z	firefly2442	MHz128	did you see my PM?
