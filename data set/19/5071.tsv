2008-09-07T21:24:00.000Z	Denesh		i have a problem with my internet... i get network timeouts for certain websites... some work some don't any ideas on how to fix ?
2008-09-07T21:25:00.000Z	redvamp128	Denesh	just an idea
2008-09-07T21:26:00.000Z	redvamp128		check your proxy settings
2008-09-07T21:26:00.000Z	Denesh	redvamp128	i have no proxy
2008-09-07T21:26:00.000Z	redvamp128		in firefox- tools- advanced -
2008-09-07T21:26:00.000Z	redvamp128		network
2008-09-07T21:26:00.000Z	redvamp128		connection- then settings tab
2008-09-07T21:27:00.000Z	redvamp128		It could be set for auto-detect-
2008-09-07T21:27:00.000Z	redvamp128		Or try switching it to no proxy
2008-09-07T21:27:00.000Z	redvamp128		mine is set for use system proxy sttings
2008-09-07T21:27:00.000Z	redvamp128		but worth a shot
2008-09-07T21:28:00.000Z	redvamp128		I ran into that issue - with puppy linux before- and firefox
2008-09-07T21:29:00.000Z	Denesh	redvamp128	no difference... i dont think its a firefox issue...
2008-09-07T21:30:00.000Z	Denesh	redvamp128	i tried other browsers and same issue... netstat shows a lot of syn_sent
2008-09-07T21:33:00.000Z	redvamp128	Denesh	- I found a similar issue on launchpad... any issues with synaptic?
2008-09-07T21:35:00.000Z	Denesh	redvamp128	synaptic is having trouble updating... i have been having this issue for a while... a reboot fixes the issue... but its very annoying to reboot the machine every other day
2008-09-07T21:37:00.000Z	redvamp128		Denesh- check this site- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/59331
2008-09-07T21:37:00.000Z	Denesh	redvamp128	i'll try that fix
