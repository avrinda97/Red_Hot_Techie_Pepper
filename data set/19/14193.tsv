2005-10-26T12:32:00.000Z	moquist		I'm scripting an apt-get install command, and instead of being asked interactively about configuration of the specified packages, I want to specify that stuff in the script.  Where should I be looking to figure out how to do that?
2005-10-26T12:32:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	preseed it to debconf....
2005-10-26T12:39:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	I'm including an apt-get comnmand in a script that configures a bunch of other stuff after it installs the required packages.  The problem is that I'd really just prefer that the preinst and postinst scripts don't run.
2005-10-26T12:40:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	then you need to hack up the debs
2005-10-26T12:40:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	ewww. :(
2005-10-26T12:41:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	thx for your help.
2005-10-26T13:42:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	I over-spoke earlier when I said I didn't want preinst and postinst to _run_.  What I really don't want is the interactivity.  I'm poking around in debconf but if this is possible no solution is obvious yet...  Surely it must be possible to specify answers to anticipated debconf questions in a conf file or on the command line, or something.  ?
2005-10-26T13:45:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	what you are looking for is preseeding
2005-10-26T13:46:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	have a look at the debconf documentation
2005-10-26T13:46:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	k; I'll see ... yep.
2005-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	that sounds perfect.  thx again for your help.
2005-10-27T16:11:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	Am I on the right track with this: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3417 ?  After reading a bunch of code I just slapped that together to try it out...
2005-10-27T16:12:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	I never really did such a thing myself before, but it looks ok
2005-10-27T16:13:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	ok; thx for looking at it.  I just wanted to be sure I was doing what you had in mind.
2005-10-27T16:13:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	you would need conf_module.sh btw
2005-10-27T16:14:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	line 5 of confmodule.sh says it's obsolete and I shouldn't use it. ?
2005-10-27T16:15:00.000Z	Seveas	moquist	hint: apt-get install debconf-doc && man 7 debconf
2005-10-27T16:17:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	gee, that's a good hint.
2005-10-27T16:19:00.000Z	moquist	Seveas	I wonder if setting DEBIAN_PRIORITY=critical won't be enough for what I need to do...
