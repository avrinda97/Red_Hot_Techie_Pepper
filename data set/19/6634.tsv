2008-01-15T12:07:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	Well ive been recently using Wubi installs because of 12 unsuccessfull partions from live cd imagine 2hours per reinstall of windows...x12... So ok i get everything working in a wubi install then suddenly i reboot and WHoah error 17 file not foud so i go into fourms defrag i login for 5mins and then i go out computer auto shok so i go through shuts down as i set it to come back erro 17 file not found
2008-01-15T12:08:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	so i go and reinstall wubi loosing documents ect for the 3rd time... so i reinstall and then the power goes out really fast guess what our favorite error so i defrag but this time nothing happens so... i boot up live cd and search fourms
2008-01-15T12:09:00.000Z	nibsa1242	Darkmystere__	I have a battery backup to avoid those sorts of things.
2008-01-15T12:09:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	 guess what NOTHING changes so... i mess around and then i notice there are 2 files that Windows doesnt see they where left over by chkdsk /f
2008-01-15T12:10:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	 i go into windows and get a program so itl see them nothing so i call up a good friend he comes over we work for hours guess wat no luck... then i get to the point im really annoyed
2008-01-15T12:11:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	i get on the live cd about to break my labtop with drowning lol and i try the first thing came to mind guess what i found in those files windows didnt see the disk file that was missing so i drag it into the ubuntu file from the live cd (i mounted windows) and then reboot and try and go into ubuntu Guess what IT WORKS!!.... i was soo flustrated that it was that easy..
2008-01-15T12:13:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	 u should understand my flustrosity by now... and now im having defragmenting problems... Soo annoying im begining to think Windows is Jealious..
2008-01-15T12:16:00.000Z	nibsa1242	Darkmystere__	Windows is annoying, thats why I sacrificed a whole hd to it. Just to keep it separate.
2008-01-15T12:17:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	well i was gunna make it so Ubuntu has 30GB and windows have 40GB
2008-01-15T12:20:00.000Z	nibsa1242	Darkmystere__	I have 2 hds, a 250GB and a 320GB. Ubuntu boots from the 250, Win from the 320. Each has a swap partition on the other's hd, and there is a Ubuntu storage partition on Win's hd, however, for the most part they are separate.
2008-01-15T12:21:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	 im trying to work with what i got because im getting a Macbook Pro Probally this summer and gunna make this 1 almost entirely windows maybe like 10GB left for windows just in case for gaming ect
2008-01-15T12:21:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	* entirely ubuntu lol
2008-01-15T12:22:00.000Z	nibsa1242	Darkmystere__	I have windows mainly for compatibility/ business reasons. However, I occasionally game in it.
2008-01-15T12:23:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	 root.disk has serious fragmentation lol the entire defrag  step has been on c:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk
2008-01-15T12:28:00.000Z	Darkmystere__	nibsa1242	 have u tried su? sudo su then type ur password and the terminal will be Super User until exited i.e Root
