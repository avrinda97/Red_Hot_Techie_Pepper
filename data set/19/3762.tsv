2009-06-02T04:57:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	that doesn't do the trick. unison can't sync with folders via smb://
2009-06-02T04:58:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	i think what i'd need to do is to somehow mount the smb share to an actual folder, like /mnt/blah for example in oder for unison to be able to sync it

2009-06-06T05:03:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	services doesn't disable the bluetooth adapter completely though, i guess?
2009-06-06T05:04:00.000Z	cabrey	sjlkg	it disables it from the OS perspective and you said it is not in your BIOS, so this is all you can do
2009-06-06T05:05:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	what are the advantages of blacklisting the btusb kernel module with modprobe blacklist.conf then?
2009-06-06T05:06:00.000Z	cabrey	sjlkg	not much different, the hardware will still be idling
2009-06-06T05:08:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	my problem is, the runtime on my netbook is quite ridiculous.. 4 hours with wifi compared to up to 7 hours under windows
2009-06-06T05:08:00.000Z	cabrey	sjlkg	what netbook do you have?
2009-06-06T05:08:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	a samsung n110, which is quite similar to the nc10
2009-06-06T05:10:00.000Z	cabrey	sjlkg	you can try the array.org netbook kernel
2009-06-06T05:21:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	is it possible to test the array.org kernel and then revert back to the default intrepid kernel?
2009-06-06T05:21:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	never tinkered much with the kernels
2009-06-06T05:21:00.000Z	cabrey	sjlkg	yes. btw, your on intrepid?
2009-06-06T05:22:00.000Z	sjlkg	cabrey	yes, intrepid
2009-06-06T05:22:00.000Z	cabrey	sjlkg	as boss_mc said, it will add a new entry to your bootloader (grub)
