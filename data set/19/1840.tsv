2010-10-31T12:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 you proberly want to boot a live cd,. and follow the guides given to 'reinstall grub'
2010-10-31T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 wubi? well - No idea on that then. I definaltly do NOT recommend Wubi. I just see to many people with Too many issues with Wubi.
2010-10-31T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 basically in the grub 'terminal'  you would ahve to enter the proper commands that are normally in the grub menu/config to boot the proper entry. Figuring out those commands is the harder part.
2010-10-31T12:37:00.000Z	has564	Dr_Willis	hmm, but its not really a dead end though right..?
2010-10-31T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 you Could boot a live cd. I think and access the files from your 'wubi' install with a few  commands also.. You May want to backup them up to some other location.
2010-10-31T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 not really a dead end.  You lost the 'key' to the house.. but theres other ways in. :) and the stuff in the closet is still there...
2010-10-31T12:38:00.000Z	has564	Dr_Willis	that explained very nicely. So the house hasnt been burned down I see.
2010-10-31T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 theres some mention of this issue in the forums it seems.. (i just googled for it) --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9932369&postcount=5

2010-10-31T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 it seems the problem can reappear after EVERY kernel update... Eww.
2010-10-31T12:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	has564	 that url tells how to access the files in your wubi install also i see. :) Handy to know.
