2008-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	gralexey		I am using Ubuntu 7.04. I want to compile programm and every time i get "your C compiler can create executables". help please to solve it
2008-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	that could be any type of issue, first thing to check is you have the build-essential package installed
2008-05-01T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2008-05-01T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	put the package on a CD and install them from the cd ?
2008-05-02T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	same as every other disk "mount" is the command
2008-05-02T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	which ever one you want to mount eg: sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /mnt"
2008-05-02T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	ok, what device file is your disk ?
2008-05-02T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	use fdisk or gparted on teh device to see the partitions
2008-05-02T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	then mount the correct device
2008-05-02T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	how many hard disks do you have ?
2008-05-02T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	how many disks sata/ide/flash do youhave in the system
2008-05-02T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	thats 1 disk, - 2 partitions
2008-05-02T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	how many physical disks do you have in your system
2008-05-02T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	ok, and is /dev/sda your ide disk ?
2008-05-02T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	I'm not sure whats going on, I'm asking you questions and your responding with random answer
2008-05-02T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	is /dev/sda your ide disk ?
2008-05-02T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	ok, so you know that /dev/sda is your sata disk then, so /dev/sda$ is all the partitions on your sata disk
2008-05-02T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	gralexey	so in answer to your first question /dev/sda is your sata disk, and then /dev/sda$number is your partitions
2008-05-02T15:31:00.000Z	gralexey	ikonia	ok thanks, will try again
