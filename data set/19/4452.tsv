2009-01-12T03:51:00.000Z	timebomb	Flannel	are you familiar with netboot preseeding?
2009-01-12T03:54:00.000Z	timebomb	Flannel	well it won't download the release file even though it does the dhcp. also checked routes and gateway and pinging archive.ubuntu and www.google.com works too, so i dont see why downloading the release file should make it hang
2009-01-12T03:57:00.000Z	timebomb	Flannel	works when i do it manually
2009-01-12T03:57:00.000Z	timebomb		ie not going through autoconfiguration
