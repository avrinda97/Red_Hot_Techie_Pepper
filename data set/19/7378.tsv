2007-10-28T23:17:00.000Z	PoMMiE`		is there a website with base terminal commands and helpfile?
2007-10-28T23:18:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- cd /bin   man each one individually.  ;)
2007-10-28T23:20:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- "net active"?  Not sure what that means.. mainly linux has fewer viruses because to do a lot of damage you need to run the virus as the root user.  By default more and more linux distros lock down the root account.  Additionally, Linux isn't as widespread on the desktop as Windows so fewer virus writers are presently targeting it </my two cents>
2007-10-28T23:39:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- CLI > GUI.  The sooner the world realizes that the better.  ;P
2007-10-28T23:40:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- CLI = Command Line Interface  GUI = Graphical User Interface.
2007-10-28T23:41:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- both...
2007-10-28T23:41:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- A+... ;)
2007-10-28T23:44:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- everything should be great except the wireless... wireless has always been a trouble spot for me, especially with onboard wifi.  My Cisco wireless Aironet card works like a champ though...
2007-10-28T23:45:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- yes... I have had no problem detecting them.  Getting the right driver to work is another issue.
2007-10-28T23:45:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- at the command line you can type   lspci to see what it detected or     dmesg    to see a lot more info about what was discovered at boot in general.
2007-10-28T23:57:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- I'm hoping to one day get a desktop environment like on the movie Minority Report...
2007-10-28T23:58:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- I want to be able to wear a "power glove" and move things around in the air while playing some overly dramatic classical music though...
2007-10-29T00:03:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- probably so... if you want to discuss further lets head over to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-10-29T00:05:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- yes.
2007-10-29T00:17:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- age is not of importance here... we are here to talk about Linux.  A 13 yr old could have just as much knowledge as a 52 yr old as far as I've seen...
2007-10-29T00:23:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- time for you to head over to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-10-29T00:23:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- you are asking about warez... hardly on topic.
2007-10-29T00:24:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- Linux also comes with gimp, a web browser, and video software.  IM NOT ASKING ABOUT PORN IN HERE THOUGH.
2007-10-29T00:25:00.000Z	mindrape	PoMMiE`	- in any event you are on my list of people to no longer help and I would recommend others do the same with you.... /ignore'd
