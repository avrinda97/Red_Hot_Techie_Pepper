2007-12-03T13:40:00.000Z	wenja		anybody's intel prowireless 2200 working on gutsy?
2007-12-03T13:41:00.000Z	wenja		hi all, my wireless card isn't working. its an ipw 2200
2007-12-03T13:42:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	should work, if driver isnt loaded automatically just sudo modprobe sudo modprobe ipw2200  , http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/  for additional information
2007-12-03T13:49:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	didn't work after that sudo
2007-12-03T13:50:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	it says module ipw2200 not found, what do i need to install?
2007-12-03T13:53:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	what ubuntu do you run? gutsy?
2007-12-03T13:53:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	yes
2007-12-03T13:53:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	k, wait a minute, ill have a look
2007-12-03T13:54:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	ok
2007-12-03T13:59:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	im sry, but this is strange, as the ipw2200 should be in the list of modules for the gutsy kernel by default. what does sudo modinfo ipw2200 say?
2007-12-03T14:00:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	modinfo: could not open /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/modules.dep
2007-12-03T14:01:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	this seems as you have quite bigger problems than setting up you wlan connection :/
2007-12-03T14:01:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	it is a clean install. did something go wrong then?
2007-12-03T14:02:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	sry, cant tell
2007-12-03T14:02:00.000Z	Varka	wenja	this is above my knowledge im afraid
2007-12-03T14:02:00.000Z	wenja	Varka	thanks alot
