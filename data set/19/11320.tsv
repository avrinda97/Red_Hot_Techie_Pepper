2006-06-26T15:57:00.000Z	roostishaw		anyone, how would i use mailx to send a message to myemail@gmail.com?
2006-06-26T15:57:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	what's wrong with regular mail?
2006-06-26T15:58:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	i need to do it within a bash script
2006-06-26T15:58:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	you could use mail -s "subject" emailaddress < content
2006-06-26T15:58:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	where content is a file
2006-06-26T15:59:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	ok, ill try it out, thx
2006-06-26T16:00:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	hmm... after i run that command (with all the right info of corse), it just prints a new line. then when i go to my gmail inbox, there are no new messages...
2006-06-27T16:03:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	any ideas?
2006-06-27T16:04:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	ahh, your mail system needs to be set up correctly before it can send messages. i'm trying to  figure out how to do that now...
2006-06-27T16:04:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	ok...
2006-06-27T16:06:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
2006-06-27T16:07:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	ok, what do i choose for the first question?
2006-06-27T16:07:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	you should probably try to configure postfix to send mail through your ISP
2006-06-27T16:09:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	what about the smtp relay host?
2006-06-27T16:10:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	that would be your isp's mail server
2006-06-27T16:10:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	:D  and how do i get that? (btw, im trying to send it to a gmail account... if thast matters)
2006-06-27T16:13:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	depends on your isp, for example mine is mail.iinet.net.au for my isp iinet
2006-06-27T16:13:00.000Z	ndazza	roostishaw	you can get the details from your isp's web page, it's the same as you would set up for sending email from thunderbird etc
2006-06-27T16:13:00.000Z	roostishaw	ndazza	ok, i got it... now For what network blocks should this machine relay mail?  The default is
