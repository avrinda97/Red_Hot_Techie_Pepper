2010-10-25T17:54:00.000Z	servis_pz		My friend is asking if he need to install Okular . Because he is worried about evince to do not open some file types properly. For example doc files can not open from OpenOffice properly bu can open them. Can someone please answer me ? Thank you!
2010-10-25T17:54:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	  I believe okular is kde  pdf reader   yes??
2010-10-25T17:55:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	yes it is kde reader but we can install it also.
2010-10-25T17:55:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	  yes you can install it   ... it will also install many kde libraries and dependencies as well
2010-10-25T17:57:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	we can install i know. but we are asking if there is a possibility that evince to do not open a filetype and okular will ?
2010-10-25T17:57:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	 that is our question...
2010-10-25T17:57:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	  oh  I see.... well let me check in okular hold on
2010-10-25T17:58:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	ok tahnks for your interest!
2010-10-25T17:59:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	 which file types are you hoping okular opens?
2010-10-25T18:00:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	    http://okular.kde.org/formats.php
2010-10-25T18:01:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	my friend is using many filetypes because of his job. But i told him some filetypes (which i look from help files of evince and okular) . they can open the same filetypes. but don't forget openoffice supports doc files too but it can never open properly %100 like ms office. so that is why i am asking you if evince and okular is on the same level to open their filetypes.
2010-10-25T18:03:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	 did you look here ?  yes?  http://okular.kde.org/formats.php  also ms office files open generally 100%  in abiword
2010-10-25T18:06:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	first sorry for my english. i think i can not explain you the problem. i knwo which filetypes can open okular and evince. they are same filetypes (at least many of them). but the questions is not that. the questiosn is : they both supports the same filetypes at the same level ?
2010-10-25T18:07:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	because every program says that we upport bla bla bla formats but they can not support them propely ...
2010-10-25T18:07:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	   I am not sure   ...what is your native language?
2010-10-25T18:07:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	turkish
2010-10-25T18:08:00.000Z	coz_	servis_pz	  ooo darn I dont speak that at all :(  but all I can suggest is to install okular and test  or abiword  etc  you can always uninstall them cleanly
2010-10-25T18:08:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	 they are nÄ±t unistalling cleanly :D anyway :)
2010-10-25T18:08:00.000Z	servis_pz	coz_	 thank for your interest...
