2011-11-07T03:02:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	Nope, that's a different error :) This time you don't have GST installed - line 102 in your pastie. It wants the packages listed in lines 109 through 114. To get them, I'd: aptitude search <PACKAGENAME> then apt-get install <PACKAGE> until you meet all dependancies.
2011-11-07T02:53:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	You don't have GTK installed. Try 'sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
2011-11-07T02:54:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	thanks, trying.

2011-11-07T03:00:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	same error, looks like.  I installed like you said :(
2011-11-07T03:08:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	can I do step 3 on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo to batch-add all dependencies?
2011-11-07T03:09:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	I've not used that method. It would probably work.
2011-11-07T03:09:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	I'll read into it.
2011-11-07T03:10:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	it says to use auto apt, but I don't get how to work it into my source install. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoApt
2011-11-07T03:13:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	Like I said, I havn't used it. I would search for pacakges needed and install using apt, then copy my history into a file (history | grep apt >> file.txt), then turn it into a script to run on other computers (like this one: http://pastebin.com/xNZGqKwy)
2011-11-07T03:17:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	You're installing banshee, correct?
2011-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	yes, I am.  banshee 2.3.1 isn't supported by ubuntu yet in the repos
2011-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	You could just use the ubuntu repos to install it :) apt-get install banshee.
2011-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	Ah, right.
2011-11-07T03:19:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	open a file called something.sh, then basically copy the script I linked you except change the package names. Needs to start with #!/bin/bash. Then just run 'sh something.sh' to run it.
2011-11-07T03:19:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	oops. 'sudo sh something.sh' because it's got apt- in it, and you'd want to run that as admin.
2011-11-07T03:19:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	^
2011-11-07T03:20:00.000Z	Thelmaria	hughissuper_	I have to run, I have a class - if you've got problems I'll be around in a few hours, if nobody else here can help. Good luck.
2011-11-07T03:21:00.000Z	hughissuper_	Thelmaria	real quick, what parts do i replace again?
