2008-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	dingle88		i have the livecd that will not install properly, so i am downloading the image again
2008-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	dingle88		i want to mount it and then install it from that source
2008-12-28T10:44:00.000Z	dingle88		well, i want to just mount this image and do it
2008-12-28T10:44:00.000Z	dingle88		i asked how to do it a seperate way

2008-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	my first question proved looks to be a bitch to do, so i asked a second way to do it
2008-12-28T10:48:00.000Z	sfer21	dingle88	it still doesn't justify your manners (or lack of)
2008-12-28T10:48:00.000Z	dingle88		i apologize
2008-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	dingle88		because of my job i am used to dealing with people a certain way

2008-12-28T10:50:00.000Z	sfer21	dingle88	nevertheless, it doesn't justify how you dealt with this.
