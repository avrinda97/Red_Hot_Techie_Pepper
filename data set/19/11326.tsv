2006-02-22T15:57:00.000Z	wickers	YaST	you gave your on board graphics controller 128megs?
2006-02-22T15:57:00.000Z	wickers	YaST	you are nuts
2006-02-22T15:58:00.000Z	YaST	wickers	shared yeh
2006-02-22T15:59:00.000Z	wickers	YaST	you should tone that mem down a bit, it's shared memory so you are just using up memory that could be used for applicaions or cache.
2006-02-22T16:00:00.000Z	YaST	wickers	but still.. there is a way of putting it to work
2006-02-22T16:00:00.000Z	YaST		cause ubuntu only recognizes 8mb's
2006-02-22T16:00:00.000Z	YaST		of the 128mb

2006-02-22T16:00:00.000Z	wickers		yast, look at the driver's docs, there should be a section on memory
2006-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	YaST	wickers	the problem is that I get 1080 fps on glxgears and glxinfo show direct rendering enable
