2007-07-07T14:58:00.000Z	fisherhome		i'm having a bit of trouble finding information about memory inside this machine i'm booting from LiveCD with.. i'm inside Device Manager but can't figure out which one shows installed memory amount.. can anyone offer a tip?
2007-07-07T14:59:00.000Z	fisherhome		i'm speaking of RAM not HDD space
2007-07-07T15:00:00.000Z	fisherhome		thank you
2007-07-07T15:02:00.000Z	fisherhome		so if it says 483480KB under MemTotal, that means I have almost 512MB installed usable memory right?
2007-07-07T15:02:00.000Z	fisherhome		i could just open the box but that's too easy
2007-07-07T15:03:00.000Z	fisherhome		hehe exactly, intel P4 2.00
2007-07-07T15:03:00.000Z	fisherhome		thanks bro
2007-07-07T15:03:00.000Z	fisherhome		it was a freebee machine at one of my clients so i'm throwing 7.04 on it
2007-07-07T15:03:00.000Z	fisherhome		512MB is plenty enough for an extra desktop w/ ubuntu
2007-07-07T15:03:00.000Z	fisherhome		i810? i don't follow, sorry
2007-07-07T15:04:00.000Z	Thuenor	fisherhome	archiecture
2007-07-07T15:04:00.000Z	fisherhome	adamonline45	use an md5 checksum
2007-07-07T15:05:00.000Z	fisherhome		ah thanks.. i've been working on socket 939 for so long, i forgot what intel's like
2007-07-07T15:05:00.000Z	Thuenor	fisherhome	same here -- my replacement under warranty came back Intel :(
2007-07-07T15:05:00.000Z	fisherhome	adamonline45	sure, just google "ubuntu 7.04 i386 checksum"
2007-07-07T15:05:00.000Z	fisherhome		you'll find one right away
2007-07-07T15:05:00.000Z	fisherhome		Theunor: are you serious?!  they must have changed out the mobo too
2007-07-07T15:05:00.000Z	fisherhome		that to me seems a bit over the line
2007-07-07T15:06:00.000Z	Thuenor	fisherhome	yeah, turned out both mobo and processor were busted
