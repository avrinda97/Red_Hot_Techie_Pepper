2006-03-28T14:15:00.000Z	zF		Does the Pentium M support the i686 linux-image?
2006-03-28T14:16:00.000Z	zF		Why is my system by defualt using the i386 linux-image?
2006-03-28T14:17:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	all ubuntu users start with i386
2006-03-28T14:17:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	except amd64 and such
2006-03-28T14:18:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	I see.
2006-03-28T14:18:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	as far a performance goes... the only reason i see to use an i686 kernel is for if you have over a gig of ram...
2006-03-28T14:19:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	it should
2006-03-28T14:19:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	thanks.
2006-03-28T14:19:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	I have a question - kind of a weird one.
2006-03-28T14:19:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	ok
2006-03-28T14:20:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	why do "advanced" gun/linux users use Ubuntu?
2006-03-28T14:20:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	no idea.... i use gentoo myself but help out around here when i can
2006-03-28T14:22:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	that's pretty cool of you.
2006-03-28T14:22:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	thank you
2006-03-28T14:22:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	but it's very humorous to me that I asked that, and you use gentoo :x
2006-03-28T14:22:00.000Z	zF	Kovecses	I tried installing gentoo after using Ubuntu for 5 or so months, but I got my ass kicked. :(
2006-03-28T14:23:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	but i think Ubuntu is a great OS
2006-03-28T14:24:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	the gui install sucks ...... it isnt meant for first time users
2006-03-28T14:25:00.000Z	Kovecses	zF	if you follow the gentoo handbook it is fairly easy
