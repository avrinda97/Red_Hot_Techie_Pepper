2008-11-08T01:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mc__	Ahh, you have to either hold down the option key at boot ( and choose windows, because Apple refuses to acknowledged that any other Operating system besides OSX and windows exists ) or install rEFIt which will give you a boot menu
2008-11-08T01:48:00.000Z	mc__	Jordan_U	there is no windows option at boot up
2008-11-08T01:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U		 mc__: Did you hold down the option key?

2008-11-08T01:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mc__	Do you see the Ubuntu partition in disk utility or from the Ubuntu LiveCD ?
2008-11-08T01:56:00.000Z	mc__	Jordan_U	yes it does see it
2008-11-08T01:59:00.000Z	mc__	Jordan_U	do you think it was a mistake that I created a new partition table?
