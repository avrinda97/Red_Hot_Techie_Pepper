2010-10-21T02:33:00.000Z	Dephenom		Seriously, what is the point of adding something to a default install if it is buggy?
2010-10-21T02:34:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	it's not the apps fault, twitter has made some controversial changes and it's breaking a lot of apps
2010-10-21T02:36:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	you mean by requiring you to use OAuth? How does that impact a client from sending tweets? I can receive them, just not send via Gwibber
2010-10-21T02:39:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	clients need to authenticate themselves before sending tweets (and us oauth for doing so.) clients are not required to do some sort of registration with twitter. these and other changes are giving devs headaches because it has been made clear to twitter that these changes are not optimal and will lead to trouble
2010-10-21T02:39:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	correction: clients are NOW required ..
2010-10-21T02:41:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	you might want to re read my first post, I have done that, It was working yesterday, and now today it is back at stage 1
2010-10-21T02:42:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	apt-cache policy gwibber
2010-10-21T02:43:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	also note that -daily are development repositories, updated very frequently, not stable versions
2010-10-21T02:44:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	NOTHING has been updated since yesterday, so how can the EXACT SAME version of a client work yesterday, but NOT today
2010-10-21T02:45:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	because it interacts with remote API on twitters servers that may change and break clients
2010-10-21T02:46:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	the API has also, NOT CHANGED
2010-10-21T02:48:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	If you say so. Use a debugger and find what out what's wrong.
2010-10-21T02:50:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	so much for Ubuntu "just working"
2010-10-21T02:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	Work is mostly done by volunteers. If you don't like what you see, fix it yourself or hire someone who knows to fix it.
2010-10-21T02:52:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	why do you think I am in here? this is the Ubuntu support channel is it not? I need support and you are telling me to live with it or fix it myself, come off it
2010-10-21T02:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	demand a refund
2010-10-21T02:55:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	oh, your so witty, do not give up the day job for one as a comedian
2010-10-21T03:26:00.000Z	Dephenom	ilovefairuz	I owe you an apology, I have just checked the twitter config in Gwibber and the "Send Messages" check box was not ticked
2010-10-21T03:30:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Dephenom	thank you
