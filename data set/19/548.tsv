2011-12-30T19:45:00.000Z	Humbedooh		that would depend on the size of the file
2011-12-30T19:45:00.000Z	Humbedooh		some partition chunks might be reused for other files
2011-12-30T19:46:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0	Humbedooh	hmmm according to theadmin it wipes the whole file
2011-12-30T19:48:00.000Z	Humbedooh		I wouldn't think it writes all zeros in the whole file
2011-12-30T19:48:00.000Z	Humbedooh		but it might just reallocate the file somewhere else when overriding it
2011-12-30T19:48:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		I'm assuming it doesn't write over that data though since the resulting file is a 0 byte file...of course it could just hit the first 0 and eof which it prob does anyways
2011-12-30T19:48:00.000Z	Humbedooh		the data should be somewhere on the disk yes
2011-12-30T19:48:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		the data would be in its same physical location
2011-12-30T19:49:00.000Z	Humbedooh		yes but filename might not be
2011-12-30T19:49:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		I'm assuming that the cat /dev/null > filename also doesn't actually free that space
2011-12-30T19:49:00.000Z	Humbedooh		it would depend on how many clusters the file covered
2011-12-30T19:50:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		well I guess I'll just have to test it
2011-12-30T19:50:00.000Z	Humbedooh		you won't get your files back unless you get down to some basic low-level manipulation :>
2011-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		yea, I'm not worried, didn't lose any data...just curious
2011-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	Humbedooh		if you write 1 byte to the file, it would still only be 1 byte long
2011-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		right...but the question is
2011-12-30T19:53:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		lets say I had a eh I dunno...50 byte file..and I > filename so it makes it a 0 byte file...does that put one 0 where the data is effectively telling the os hey..eof is reached immediately so it's a 0 byte file and essentially only one byte of 50 is actually erased on the disk...so 49 would be theoretically recoverable if that zero were changed?
2011-12-30T19:54:00.000Z	Negat1ve-Zer0		slackcphil: ah, good thinkin
2011-12-30T19:55:00.000Z	Humbedooh	Negat1ve-Zer0	try reopening the file, seeking to byte 50 and write one byte :)
