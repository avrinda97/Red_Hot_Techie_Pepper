2008-02-19T05:26:00.000Z	Waffle		how would i go about editing gimps programming so it would automatically do that?
2008-02-19T05:26:00.000Z	Waffle		go to /usr/bin perhaps?
2008-02-19T05:26:00.000Z	Cyr4x	Waffle	it's just imposibble to have one-window gimp at this time
2008-02-19T05:27:00.000Z	Waffle		crud
2008-02-19T05:27:00.000Z	Cyr4x		this feature will be included in the future
2008-02-19T05:27:00.000Z	Waffle		hopefully the near future
2008-02-19T05:28:00.000Z	Cyr4x		krita is nothing comparing to gimp
2008-02-19T05:28:00.000Z	Cyr4x		just see pixel image editor
2008-02-19T05:28:00.000Z	Cyr4x		that's probably what did you want
2008-02-19T05:28:00.000Z	Cyr4x		(veeeeeeeeery similar to photoshop)
2008-02-19T05:29:00.000Z	Waffle		i need free
2008-02-19T05:29:00.000Z	Waffle		everything im running right now is free
2008-02-19T05:30:00.000Z	Waffle		even my hardware is free
2008-02-19T05:30:00.000Z	Cyr4x		if you would develop an aplication quite like the professional one which costs a lot
2008-02-19T05:30:00.000Z	Cyr4x		would you share for free?
2008-02-19T05:30:00.000Z	Cyr4x		or sell for a small fee?
2008-02-19T05:31:00.000Z	Waffle	Cyr4x	if i make a program that can do that i will make it open source
2008-02-19T05:32:00.000Z	Waffle		open source = ftw
2008-02-19T05:37:00.000Z	Waffle	Cyr4x	pixel looks ridiculously good, but im not willing to pay that much (i know, im cheap)
