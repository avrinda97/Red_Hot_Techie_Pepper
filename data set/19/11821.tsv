2005-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	bnD		can anyone help me out? i cant access the web, so this is the only place i have to turn to ;P
2005-12-15T06:27:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	have you done anything on your personal machine that would affect the web?
2005-12-15T06:27:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	yes i was messing with iptables ;x, however ive removed it at this point
2005-12-15T06:28:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	when you do sudo iptables -L, does it look reasonable
2005-12-15T06:28:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	ive removed iptables at this point
2005-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	you've removed the package?
2005-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	yes
2005-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	and the kernel bits
2005-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	doubt it
2005-12-15T06:30:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	I don't think removing iptables was your solution
2005-12-15T06:31:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	i just was trying to get to google to fix the rest ;D
2005-12-15T06:31:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	the package contains administration tools for the packet filter, but as far as I know, not the filter itself (which is part of the kernel)
2005-12-15T06:31:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	ahh
2005-12-15T06:33:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	reinstall iptables....and work from there
2005-12-15T06:34:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	k, one sec
2005-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	have you reinstalled iptables? if so, get a list
2005-12-15T06:49:00.000Z	djm62	bnD	sudo iptables -L ?
2005-12-15T06:50:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	one sec
2005-12-15T06:52:00.000Z	bnD	djm62	looks standard
