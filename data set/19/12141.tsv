2006-05-03T14:53:00.000Z	r0xoR		should i use SMP for an AMD64 system?
2006-05-03T14:53:00.000Z	r0xoR		or do they not need it?
2006-05-03T14:53:00.000Z	r0xoR		or was that intel/hyperthreading i'm thinking of that needs SMP even on single proc systems
2006-05-03T14:55:00.000Z	r0xoR		anyone?
2006-05-03T14:55:00.000Z	r0xoR		oh well, whatever
2006-05-03T14:55:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	you have a point but I don't know
2006-05-11T14:50:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	unless you have a few years of linux behind you don't do expert :-)
2006-05-11T14:50:00.000Z	r0xoR	ompaul	got more than a few years
2006-05-11T14:52:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	then its like a typical install before RH and SuSE got the gui
2006-05-11T14:52:00.000Z	r0xoR	ompaul	or more like slack/debian/gentoo?
2006-05-11T14:52:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	play with it if you must
2006-05-11T14:53:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	frankly I see no need for it unless you got some "mad stuff" going on - typical server or whatever should not need it
2006-05-11T14:54:00.000Z	r0xoR	ompaul	mmmm... mad stuff... i need to custom compile three outside kernel modules and reconfigure scripts inside /etc/rc*.d
2006-05-11T14:54:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	not in my book
2006-05-28T11:26:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	at 800 people its a tad busy >>/etc/init.d/gdm start<<
2006-05-28T11:26:00.000Z	r0xoR	ompaul	no i understand
2006-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	check out help.ubuntu.com which is more aligned to the devs
2006-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	ompaul	r0xoR	or post on the forums ;-)
2006-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	r0xoR	ompaul	? help.ubuntu.com has the worst documentation i've seen yet :)
