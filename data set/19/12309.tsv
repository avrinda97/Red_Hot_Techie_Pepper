2006-05-30T12:34:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	somehow i doubt it..
2006-05-30T12:34:00.000Z	glick	eobanb	doubt what?
2006-05-30T12:35:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	that you really did find a bug in xorg
2006-05-30T12:35:00.000Z	glick	eobanb	there is a bug somewhere that allows me to overwrite another process's address space
2006-05-30T12:40:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	mind sending me the programme? i'd sure like to see that for myself
2006-05-30T12:41:00.000Z	glick	eobanb	yeah i cant send it to you
2006-05-30T12:42:00.000Z	glick	eobanb	what are you the guy we have to prove things to or something?
2006-05-30T12:43:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	no, but i just want to point out that i encounter people all the time that claim or think they've found an exploit or bug when really haven't, that's all
2006-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	glick	eobanb	well id say being able to randomly write into video memory is pretty bad
2006-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	so is an asteroid about to crash into earth
2006-05-30T12:45:00.000Z	glick	eobanb	ima do some detective work before i post code/sploits to make sure
2006-05-30T12:45:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	are you running breezy or dapper
2006-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	eobanb	glick	and there never will be as long as sun keeps up their CDDL BS, but that's a subject for -offtopic
