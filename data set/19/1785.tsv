2010-10-14T15:15:00.000Z	noob-tux		okies
2010-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	both virtualbox versions are free as in price, but the open source one is as in freedom as well :)
2010-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	noob-tux	sebsebseb	im having problem installing bt4 on vbox....that's why i might try vmware on it might works fine
2010-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	bt4 is a security pentration distro, so quite pointless to virtual machine it, and you probably shoudn't really be using it in the first place
2010-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	noob-tux	sebsebseb	in vbox mostly i override all the repos i've used in bt4....doin update in my main ubuntu gives lots of problems....
2010-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	bt4 is not meant to be used as a desktop OS
2010-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	noob-tux	sebsebseb	i aint using it for my own interest or any lame h4x0r thingy....i'm doin this for my college presentation....part of my thesis works....if i have the right to say no and get diploma i wouldnt give time on doing bt in the first place
2010-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	right well a lot of these courses teach stupid stuff, but sure use it some how then
2010-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	noob-tux	sebsebseb	that's why i'm installing bt on a virtual machine and after that i'll delete it all...
2010-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	noob-tux	sebsebseb	if only i could punch my instructor and free from an assault charges i'll do it without hesitations
2010-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	well its good  your doing something with a LInux distro
2010-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	but the problem with backtrack
2010-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	is that a lot of the newbies,  think its ok to use it as a desktop OS, when it is not
2010-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	since its based on Ubuntu, that also means sometimes they come in here asking about it
2010-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	also there are better distros, you could learn security stuff from
2010-10-14T15:25:00.000Z	noob-tux	sebsebseb	the only thing i loved about #bt4 is that they don't tolerate noobs! if u want to learn bt read stuffs rather asking basic things..... :) and they're so strict! so probably newbies got pissed and admins got the right to Kick or Ban them hehehehe
2010-10-14T15:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	well their fault for basing it on Ubuntu
2010-10-14T15:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	noob-tux	you get noobs, if you base such a distro, on a noob distro
