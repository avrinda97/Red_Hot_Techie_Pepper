2008-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	pen	Depending on what all you've done, it may be faster to backup and reinstall.
2008-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	pen	Flannel	reinstall???
2008-02-21T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	pen	envy and a partial upgrade are rather odd and potentially dangerous (well, for stability anyway) experiments

2008-10-26T10:55:00.000Z	pen	Flannel	if you scroll up a bit you can see I already asked a question

2008-10-26T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	pen	you should ask your questions about it, and repeat them about every 20-30 minutes.  If someone knows the answer, they'll answer you.  If no one answers, you're not being ignored, it's just that no one awake knows the answer.
2008-10-26T10:59:00.000Z	pen	Flannel	so you mean you don't understand what I'm trying to do?
2008-10-26T10:59:00.000Z	Flannel	pen	I mean I don't have an answer for you.
