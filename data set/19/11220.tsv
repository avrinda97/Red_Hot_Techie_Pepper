2006-03-23T09:43:00.000Z	Zarephath		I am trying to get inetd running..however when I try to apt-get install inetd it tells me it is already installed?
2006-03-23T09:44:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	it better be! comes with ubuntu
2006-03-23T09:45:00.000Z	Zarephath	NickGarvey	Ok..so why isn't there an /etc/inetd.conf file for starters..and is it supposed to run from a new install?
2006-03-23T09:45:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	what do you need to do what the file?
2006-03-23T09:46:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	its in /usr/sbin
2006-03-23T09:47:00.000Z	Zarephath	NickGarvey	Ok thanks
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	samba?
2006-06-27T16:27:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	jump in #windows and I'll help you
2006-06-27T16:27:00.000Z	Zarephath	NickGarvey	The reason I asked here is I want to use Ubuntu to do this ;-)
2006-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	oh, "fconfig" in a terminal
2006-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	ifconfig*
2006-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	oh I see, apt-get install nmap
2006-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	then.. assuming the ips start with 192.168.0.*
2006-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	nmap -sP 192.168.0.*
2006-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	this assumes windows is not blocking ping requests
2006-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	if it is, you would need to connect to your router
2006-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	Zarephath	NickGarvey	Kewl that was what I was looking for..your assumption is correct and I can connect to the router...
2006-06-27T16:35:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Zarephath	:)
2006-06-27T16:57:00.000Z	Zarephath	NickGarvey	Worked like a charm! However attempts to scan like nmap -sS 192.168.1.* results in a message that it can't do it...I assumed root privileges was regarding Ubuntu and not the computer I am trying to scan?
