2006-08-13T13:07:00.000Z	BeepAU		hey everyone, i'm trying to install easyh10, which is for my iriver, but when i go to install the package, it tells me 'Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6'. what do i have to do to fix it?
2006-08-13T13:07:00.000Z	Bonez56_	BeepAU	try sudo apt-cache search libc6
2006-08-13T13:07:00.000Z	Bonez56_	BeepAU	and see if there are any packages, then install the one you think looks most obvious
2006-08-13T13:12:00.000Z	Bonez56_	BeepAU	how did you go?
2006-08-13T13:12:00.000Z	BeepAU	Bonez56_	-- it tell's me i already have it, and it's the newest version etc.
2006-08-13T13:14:00.000Z	BeepAU	Bonez56_	-- however, i still get the same error message. how can i fix it?
2006-08-13T13:14:00.000Z	Bonez56_	BeepAU	not too sure then sorry :(
