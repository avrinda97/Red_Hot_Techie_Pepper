2005-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	how do you mean?
2005-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	have you installed 5.04 5.10 ?
2005-10-20T07:53:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	click on system administration update manager
2005-10-20T07:54:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	then you will get a little red circle on the top right hand side of the screen click on that and enjoy the downloading
2005-10-20T07:54:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	when you are finishing you will have to reboot  as there is a new kernel in there
2005-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	why did you not do 5.10 just  as a matter of interest?
2005-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	you will be
2005-10-20T07:56:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	well if you don't mind me saying so I would download and install 5.10 now as it came out the other day
2005-10-20T07:56:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	the only advantage is that it will last longer :)
2005-10-20T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	yes, but you don't want to do taht
2005-10-20T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	yes, use sudo for a week and you will be hooked
2005-10-20T08:22:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	for one you run a command and come back to see what it was a couple of weeks later with sudo its in the logs
2005-10-20T08:22:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	the password is your own
2005-10-20T08:23:00.000Z	ompaul	WaxieWhite	you will get very used to is in a week trust me on this, also in large corporates it is how all things are done
