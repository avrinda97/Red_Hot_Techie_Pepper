2008-03-06T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	icesword	remove it from your panel
2008-03-06T08:09:00.000Z	icesword	jrib	maybe that is not right,i don't that process at boot
2008-03-06T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	icesword	deskbar-applet only loads when you login
2008-03-06T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	icesword	right click on it, remove from panel.  Let me know if it still starts next time you login
2008-03-06T08:10:00.000Z	icesword	jrib	so you mean,if i remove it,it won't load again,even in background
