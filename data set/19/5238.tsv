2009-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	dexi	How are you connected to the internet?
2009-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	ethernet cable to DSL
2009-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	dexi	And are you using the same site to test the download speed?
2009-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	its all-around slow downloads on linux...
2009-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	I didnt use a test site, i just took notice of low speed here
2009-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	dexi	Try a test site. B/c there is no reason for it to be slow on Ethernet, unless you are using ndiswrapper
2009-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	im not. im using apt-get to get amarok right now and its running around 20 kb/s and i was downloading thunderbird early at about the same...
2009-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	dexi	Ahh.. Those mirrors are bombarded pretty much all day long :)
2009-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	but i noticed a lag in average page viewing too
2009-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	dexi	And are you using ndiswrapper?
2009-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	as far as i know, no.
2009-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	dexi	I have no clue... It shouldn't really do that
2009-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	dexi	WebcamWonder	lol thanks
