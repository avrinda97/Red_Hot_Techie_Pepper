2012-06-01T00:50:00.000Z	Aster		So, I'm having a mouse pointer problem. When I click on the icon on the top right (to access the menu), or when I click on the sound icon, everything disappears. The system menu/icon only stays at long as I am holding the mouse button, and when I try to mark a program as executable, the checkbox only stays checked for about a second.
2012-06-01T00:51:00.000Z	Aster		Ubuntu 11.10
2012-06-01T00:52:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	what bits are you using? 32 bit or 64 bit?
2012-06-01T00:53:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	64
2012-06-01T00:53:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	I had problems with 64 bit with anything above 10.10 as well... so I gave up and I'm using 10.04
2012-06-01T00:57:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	the guy that answered assumed you were running an executable from a FAT or NTFS sysmte. if you can access a terminal do chmod +x /path/to/file/filename
2012-06-01T00:59:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	but the file is on another hard drive.
2012-06-01T01:00:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	that would've been valuable information to provide in the question. Is the hdd that you're file is on using NTFS or FAT?
2012-06-01T01:01:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	it's NTFS, and on another hard drive than my Linux installation.
2012-06-01T01:03:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	any idea?
2012-06-01T01:06:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	zykotick9 hurt my feelings :.(.
2012-06-01T01:07:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	is it a .exe
2012-06-01T01:07:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	Oh. D:
2012-06-01T01:07:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	yeah, I tried running it with Wine, but it gives me the message talking able blah executable blah bit blah.
2012-06-01T01:08:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	move it on to a Linux partition and then maybe it should chmod +x correctly
2012-06-01T01:09:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	can you get it onto a linux drive?
2012-06-01T01:13:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	did you get it?
2012-06-01T01:16:00.000Z	Aster	[snake]	Well, it's for running a game that's a couple 30 GB large.
2012-06-01T01:16:00.000Z	[snake]	Aster	oh... lol nope unless you like waiting. I'm afraid I cannot help you :(
