2008-05-28T14:14:00.000Z	VSpike	kurugah	what actual problem are you trying to solve.. lack of space?
2008-05-28T14:14:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	yes
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	i have ubuntu running on my eee
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	VSpike	kurugah	do you have other parititions with more space?
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	yes
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	sd with 4gb free
2008-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	VSpike	kurugah	normally it would make more sense to move /home or /var to anothe parition but what you want can be done
2008-05-28T14:16:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	how?
2008-05-28T14:17:00.000Z	VSpike	kurugah	can you do: du -sh /var/cache/apt
2008-05-28T14:18:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	23M     /var/cache/apt is the output
2008-05-28T14:19:00.000Z	VSpike		So 23M is all that is being used for downloaded packages, I think
2008-05-28T14:19:00.000Z	VSpike	kurugah	So 23M is all that is being used for downloaded packages, I think
2008-05-28T14:20:00.000Z	VSpike	kurugah	I don't think you will gain much from moving that to another partition
2008-05-28T14:21:00.000Z	kurugah	VSpike	i would like to get apt to dl the new version to another partition b4 i start the update process
