2010-04-12T11:15:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	Oh, nice,:D
2010-04-12T11:46:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	Uh. You don't have to sync anything. A list of users usually comes with any IRC client. If Pidgin isn't showing it, try to enable it somewhere.
2010-04-12T11:46:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	Ok,
2010-04-12T12:02:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	IRC does not embed smiley or img. >;}~
2010-04-12T12:02:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	Oh, thanks.
2010-04-13T12:34:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	"lsusb | grep -i bluetooth" --> Does it display something?
2010-04-13T12:35:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	Also, make sure the Wifi/BT switch is on.
2010-04-13T12:36:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	No, it does not display. Does this mean that I don't have bluetooth?
2010-04-13T12:36:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	Pretty much yes.
2010-04-13T12:36:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	Oh, I see, :(
2010-04-13T12:37:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	You can get BT dongle for... few bucks. It is incredibly cheap.
2010-04-13T12:37:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	Oh, thanks
2010-04-13T12:39:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	But, I see over Google, that Compaq 6710s has Integrated and inbuilt Bluetooth, :(
2010-04-13T12:39:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	Link?

2010-04-13T12:41:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	That's not really useful. Even the user and the helpers seems to be skeptical. Furthurmore, my PC does not have BT and i have BT dongle for the said PC, it showed up in lsusb too.
2010-04-13T12:42:00.000Z	rocket16	red2kic	Oh, thanks
2010-05-07T12:40:00.000Z	red2kic	rocket16	Set static IPS, maybe?
