2005-05-05T16:33:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	what's the structure of these heads?
2005-05-05T16:34:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	trying to install bagisas(gui)  for yafray/blender
2005-05-05T16:34:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	ah :)
2005-05-05T16:39:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	have to build from source.  bagisas= gui for yafray
2005-05-05T16:42:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	do you know the dependencies?
2005-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	PIL, PyXML, Python(2.4)
2005-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	so, you're ok with the installation? (best to install to /usr/local)
2005-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	no.  having no luck whatsoever
2005-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	what's up?
2005-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	 getting half-done installation directions.  not sure what needs to be done
2005-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	what exactly are you doing, and what exactly is the error?
2005-05-05T16:47:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	 must set paths...   what paths?  to where?  why?
2005-05-05T16:49:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	does the program run for you?
2005-05-05T16:50:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	if you've tar -xzvf'ed it , cd to the new directory and try typing ./Bagisas.py
2005-05-05T16:52:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	cool...I'm getting that problem too
2005-05-05T16:53:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	because I'm searching for the solution
2005-05-05T16:55:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	Desktop, where it was downloaded.  I'd probably end up putting it in $HOME and adding that directory to the end of my $PATH
2005-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	geargolem	djm62	alternative would be to get yafray gui for win and wine it.
2005-05-05T05:00:00.000Z	djm62	geargolem	sub-optimal...you could try on the foryms of the bagisas site and ask if anyone's using on ubuntu
