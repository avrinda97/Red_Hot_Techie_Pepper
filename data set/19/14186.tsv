2004-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	bronson		Is there any way to get the installer to install the base system WITHOUT successfully partitioning the disks?
2004-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	bronson		Every time I try to select "install base packages" it takes me to the partitioner.
2004-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	no, you need to partition the disk first, because that's where you select which partitions to use
2004-10-25T10:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	you can also select 'don't format' for some partitions if you lik
2004-10-25T10:34:00.000Z	bronson	Treenaks	Right.  The disk is partitioned fine.
2004-10-25T10:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	you have to use the partitioner to tell the installer which partition to install on
2004-10-25T10:35:00.000Z	bronson	Treenaks	yes.  But when I say "Finish and write changes to disk", [Yes]  [No] 
2004-10-25T10:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	just do it..
2004-10-25T10:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	what error?
2004-10-25T10:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	you might want to remove the partitions and re-create them then
2004-10-25T10:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	did you select 'format this partition' from the partitioner menu?
2004-10-25T10:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	and a mount point?
2004-10-25T10:37:00.000Z	bronson	Treenaks	yep.  hda3 on / and hda6 on /home.  hda5 is swap.
2004-10-25T10:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	dont knwo then, sorry
2004-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	there probably is, but I don't really know the installer
2004-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	bronson	Treenaks	any idea where I'd go to find out?  Nothing on the wiki, faq or bugzilla.
2004-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	here..
2004-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	bronson	Treenaks	here, irc?
2004-10-25T10:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	bronson	what if you don't tell it anything about the windows/restore partitions?
