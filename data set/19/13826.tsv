2005-01-26T16:34:00.000Z	Hwolf		Noda, while you're at it, how do I check if I've got open ports?
2005-01-26T16:34:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	sudo netstat -pant
2005-01-26T16:35:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	If you don't configure MySQL, it doesn't even listen on the network.
2005-01-26T16:41:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	That's true, but you're also using a less awesome video player ;)
2005-01-26T16:41:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	just giving the option. Breaking ubuntu-desktop can be unpleasant.
2005-01-26T16:42:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	Ooh, thanks for reminding me, actually! Apparently there's some new stuff (mozilla-firefox-gnome-support, openoffice.org-gtk-gnome, readahead)
2005-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	do you know a way to handle encryped dvds? I've got a set of dvd's by universal that refuse to play. :-S
2005-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	Yes, that's in the FAQ on ubuntu's website
2005-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	the problem is. I've got libdvdcss already
2005-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	Using totem-xine?
2005-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	Run "totem" from the console and try to play a movie, check if the debug output is useful
2005-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	it'll run the dvd menu, but once the film starts, it quits.
2005-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	I've never heard of that. What's the debug output? :)
2005-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	Totem won't open the dvd, gxine will, then crashes.
2005-01-27T17:28:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	that icon is fucked up, appears right on top of other icons. :-S
2005-01-27T17:29:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	I've seen that too. Hasn't (yet) annoyed me enough to make me look into it :)
2005-01-27T17:29:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	is that worth filing a bug over, and for wich package?
2005-01-27T17:30:00.000Z	noda	Hwolf	The package would be Nautilus. I'm sure the bug exists already. I'll search for it.
2005-01-27T17:31:00.000Z	Hwolf	noda	ok.
