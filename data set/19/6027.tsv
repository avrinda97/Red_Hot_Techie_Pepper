2008-03-27T07:05:00.000Z	tusk1113		anyone know why a drive mounted to /media/video  would show only 50m available when the drive itself has atleast 8g?
2008-03-27T07:05:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	hmm.
2008-03-27T07:05:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	what app is showing that.
2008-03-27T07:06:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	DVB-S the "official guestimate" is 2GB per 1 hour, so 50m might suggest that the filesystem has a 2GB limit? *wonder*
2008-03-27T07:06:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	gnome file explorer (or whatever) is reading it's properties as having 50, the partition tool (and my own memory of partitioning it) is where the 8 gig come from
2008-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	50 minutes you mean?
2008-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	50 megs
2008-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	50MB free versus 5GB capacity?
2008-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	something like that, brand new install, nothing on the dirve
2008-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	run df in a terminal.
2008-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	 hmm the drive in question isn't even showing up
2008-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	then mount it?
2008-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	ok obviously user error
2008-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	there are a number of issues here.
2008-03-27T07:10:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	. .it's saying that it's not in fstab, but i'm looking at it right now
2008-03-27T07:13:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	so what do i need to be doing?
2008-03-27T07:13:00.000Z	yacc	tusk1113	what to you want to do?
2008-03-27T07:14:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	 i want the drive to automount to the mountpoint
2008-03-27T07:18:00.000Z	tusk1113	yacc	 ok found the issue, just a quick question, now that my fstab is correct, it will automount?
