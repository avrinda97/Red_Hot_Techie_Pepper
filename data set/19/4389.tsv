2009-12-19T22:38:00.000Z	devnull_		frustrated
2009-12-19T22:39:00.000Z	devnull_		I have 9.10
2009-12-19T22:39:00.000Z	devnull_		i just upgraded
2009-12-19T22:39:00.000Z	devnull_		I have been playing this game since 9.04 broke ATI support
2009-12-19T22:39:00.000Z	devnull_		and I have already fresh installed numerous ties
2009-12-19T22:40:00.000Z	devnull_		as well as my friends computer has the same exact issues in 9.04+
2009-12-19T22:40:00.000Z	devnull_		seems like everything is just broken now ... why break support for stuff that has worked in every other version
2009-12-19T22:42:00.000Z	devnull_		just frustrated as hell that I only have problems with my hardware since 8.10 and up
2009-12-19T22:43:00.000Z	devnull_		lets see DVD playback .. USB support is iffy at best now ... whch i blame on HAL i suppose ... ATI fglrx is gone because of the new xserver
2009-12-19T22:44:00.000Z	devnull_		and no it isn't a hardware issue because it al works fantastic in older versions
2009-12-19T22:44:00.000Z	migi	devnull_	did you upgrade every time to the newer versions? Reinstalling - even though it's a pain - can work great
2009-12-19T22:45:00.000Z	migi	devnull_	my 9.04 once broke and instead of trying to fix it I just installed a new 9.10, and all problems were gone
2009-12-19T22:45:00.000Z	devnull_	migi	.... i can only hope that would be my answer
2009-12-19T22:46:00.000Z	migi	devnull_	I can't promise anything though... Don't kill me if it doesn't solve things
2009-12-19T22:46:00.000Z	devnull_	migi	no prob
2009-12-19T22:47:00.000Z	migi	devnull_	do you have an external home directory? If so, you don't have to lose any of your data and/or settings
2009-12-19T22:47:00.000Z	devnull_	migi	hehe ofcourse 12 years of linx did teach me that much :)
2009-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	migi	devnull_	is it because of the DRM? or no dvd's at all work?
2009-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	devnull_	migi	no DVD playback on any DVD at all
