2010-03-03T03:38:00.000Z	serverduck		Can someone give me a beginner guide link to installing COnky on my 9.10 ubuntu machine?
2010-03-03T03:39:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	http://conky.linux-hardcore.com/
2010-03-03T03:40:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	run conky -C > ~/.conkyrc   for a default config file or copy one from the net; then run "conky -c /path/to/config"
2010-03-03T03:40:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	Thanks :)
2010-03-03T03:41:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	just running "conky" uses ~/.conkyrc , if you have multiple setups (and you will when you get the hang of it) use conky -c
2010-03-03T03:43:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 conky -C > ~/.conkyrc does nothing...
2010-03-03T03:44:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	conky: option requires an argument -- 'c
2010-03-03T03:44:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	yes, -c /path/to/configfile
2010-03-03T03:45:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 Well ohh, to config file but I don't have one..
2010-03-03T03:45:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 Where can I get one from the internet?
2010-03-03T03:45:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 WIth everything on it :)
2010-03-03T03:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	the hardcore link I gave, or http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=281865
2010-03-03T03:48:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 THank you, and were do I put the config? I make a file named conky and put it insite it or how?
2010-03-03T03:48:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	either in ~/.conkyrc, then running 'conky' will automatically pick it up; or anywhere you like, but then run "conky -c /path/to/the/file
2010-03-03T03:49:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 Thanks
2010-03-03T04:01:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 Thank you so much I did it. Conky works so great....but another thing. How do I enable it so everytime I start my machine conky will start too/
2010-03-03T04:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	maybe just putting it in startup apps doesn't work; then write a little script; 1st line: #!/bin/bash    2nd line: sleep 20 && conky    20 being delay in seconds, to make sure your window manager is ready for conky
2010-03-03T04:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	serverduck	also conky has nothing to do with your gtk theme, the -c flag is for pointing to your config path
2010-03-03T04:13:00.000Z	serverduck	VCoolio	 Thanks ;)
