2008-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	huh ?
2008-12-01T17:53:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	Can I interrupt you for a support request? I am really stuck with this for hours now.
2008-12-01T17:53:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	if you ask the channel, I'm sure they will be able to help
2008-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	When I boot up, right after Booting up... at the very top, long before Reading files needed to boot I get the error udevd[1040] lookup_group unspecified users vboxusers unknown, and my usplash theme is not displayed and I have to read all those other boot up messages. What is wrong?
2008-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	No one does.
2008-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	This site: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/User_FAQ had asked me to do two things edit mountdevsubfs.sh and fstab. I had also edited the udev-40 file to get usb to work. Now I removed the edits from all three files and restored them to their original version. Still the udev error appears at bootup. Here are the files as they are now, removed all the edits: http://pastebin.com/m743f023b, http://pastebin.com/m326f49e8, http://pastebin.com/m1d66caeb. 
2008-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	well it looks like vbox has a group setup caled vboxusers, which doesn't exist so udev can't assign permissions
2008-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	The group exists I can see it under 'Users and groups' And me and root are members of it.
2008-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	can you please do "grep vbox /etc/group" please
2008-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	vboxusers:x:126:king,root
2008-12-01T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	that looks fine, like it should work
2008-12-01T18:00:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	What about the error message: udevd[1040] lookup_group unspecified users vboxusers unknown. I get at every bootup, even after I have restored those three files to their original version, when they didn't have the edits proposed by vbox to get usb to work. That error doesn't let the usplash theme to show and everytime I have to watch each of the file as it gets loaded during bootup.
2008-12-01T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	ahhhh users, not group
2008-12-01T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	it's looking at a user called vboxusers does that user existr
2008-12-01T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	I miss-read
2008-12-01T18:01:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	That is what I thought first of all but the user vboxusers doesn't exist "users and groups' just lists two users me and root. Is there a text file I should check?
2008-12-01T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	sad_ubuntite	create a user called vboxusers (you can delete it later) just to see if the error goes away
2008-12-01T18:02:00.000Z	sad_ubuntite	ikonia	Nice idea.
