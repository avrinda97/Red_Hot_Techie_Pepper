2007-04-13T15:54:00.000Z	atomiku		I wanna move my home dir to another partition, How would I do this? I know I would first mount the partition, then cp -r the files over to it... but... what then?
2007-04-13T15:55:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	-r may not be enough to get all of the hidden files and everything, I can't remember what the best options would be, but I think maybe you need -a too.  After that, you edit /etc/fstab and point /home to the new partition.
2007-04-13T15:56:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	thanks
2007-04-13T15:58:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	There's already a line in fstab containing /home and it points to your current home partition.  Just change the line to be the new partition (like /dev/sdb3 instead of /dev/hda2 for example).  Remember what you change it from in case you need to change it back because the new copy doesn't work right.
2007-04-13T15:59:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	not for me...
2007-04-13T15:59:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Ah, so your home directory is currently just part of your main partition?
2007-04-13T16:00:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Just a second, I'll message you the line from my fstab.
2007-04-14T16:00:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	Thanks dude.
2007-04-14T16:04:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Got it now? :)
2007-04-14T16:04:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	Nope
2007-04-14T16:04:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Did you not see my message?
2007-04-14T16:04:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	nope.
2007-04-14T16:05:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Ah, I see what happened.  They have messages turned off for those of us who aren't registered because of spam problems.  I'll just say it here.
2007-04-14T16:06:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	/dev/sda2      /home                                       ext3    defaults 0 2
2007-04-14T16:06:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	thanks :)
2007-04-14T16:07:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Just replace /dev/sda2 with whatever your partition is. :)
2007-04-14T16:07:00.000Z	atomiku	Kazz	thanks :)
2007-04-14T16:07:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	Also, you should move your old home directory and make a new one before you try to boot with that.
2007-04-14T16:08:00.000Z	Kazz	atomiku	I wouldn't delete it until you're sure that the new one is working right though.
