2005-12-08T06:08:00.000Z	Infernall		hey guys, i've installed breezy amd64 and x86 and when i get to my desktop for the first time with the default nv drivers, imm getting all kinds of problems, like no mouse cursor, screen isnt refreshing, etc
2005-12-08T06:09:00.000Z	Infernall		i move the mouse for a second, cant see it though, and then hardlock
2005-12-08T06:10:00.000Z	Infernall		ok, so hard locks with x86 and amd64 breezy at first boot to desktop, no cursor, screen isnt refreshing, and bam, hardlock.  any suggestions?
2005-12-08T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Infernall	 whats your video card/processor?
2005-12-08T06:11:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	- obviously amd64, and PCI-X gforce6600
2005-12-08T06:12:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	but im sure non 64 users have tried the 64 version :)
2005-12-08T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Not a Turion cpu eh?
2005-12-08T06:12:00.000Z	Infernall		nope, venice core athlon 64
2005-12-08T06:13:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	after remove a few resolutions ffor the default 24 bit, my hardcrash started on X
2005-12-08T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Infernall	 theres a few odd issues ive seen/heard of  with some of the newer amd cpu's -  also heard of a few pci-express issues.   but your proboems dont seem to be the same as the ones ive heard of.
2005-12-08T06:13:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	but before that i could move the mouse and see icons highlight, but no cursor.. i could click on the apps menu, then crash
2005-12-08T06:13:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	any workaround?
2005-12-08T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Infernall	 hmm.. Id guess step 1 is to see if its an X/Video issue. or a deeper kernel/cpu/issue.
2005-12-08T06:14:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	Xorg's log shows nothing
2005-12-08T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Infernall	 try  not going to X and see if the system is working ok. Check your 'clock' see if the date/time sems to be passing by at too fast a speed. Thats a 'known' issue ive seen.
2005-12-08T06:15:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	- if i use grubs recovery boot, will it just give me console?
2005-12-08T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Infernall	 yea - or append the 'single' option to the end of the grub boot line/kernel options
2005-12-08T06:17:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	- found the fix.  two X options on the forums :)  apparently its amd64 processors with pci-x
2005-12-08T06:17:00.000Z	Infernall	Dr_Willis	thanks.
