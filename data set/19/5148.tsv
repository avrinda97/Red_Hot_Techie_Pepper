2008-08-26T18:30:00.000Z	Tapout	ActionParsnip	when I plug in my usb camera.. it gets loaded .. usbvision has drivers... I see it registering in dmesg.. but no /dev/video0 is created.. so xawtv fails...
2008-08-26T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tapout	lsusb give any clues?
2008-08-26T18:31:00.000Z	Tapout	ActionParsnip	Bus 007 Device 007: ID 2304:021a Pinnacle Systems, Inc. [hex]   .. but which /dev/ is that? :)
2008-08-26T18:33:00.000Z	Tapout	ActionParsnip	i'm thinking it's either /dev/usbdev7.7_ep00   .. thru ep82
2008-08-26T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tapout	hmm, what make / model is it?
2008-08-26T18:34:00.000Z	Tapout	ActionParsnip	it's a pinnacle dazzle that is covered by usbvision
2008-08-26T18:36:00.000Z	Tapout	ActionParsnip	hrmm maybe it's cause my camera drivers heh.. it may just be registering the USB drivers (dazzle) ..   i'll see if I can find astak drivers for my camera
2008-08-26T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tapout	yeah id make sure drivers are setup ok. If it creates a different /dev then you may need to symlink
2008-08-26T18:37:00.000Z	Tapout	ActionParsnip	is there a standarized way of searching for a driver?   aptitude searchdriver astak for example, would list all drivers available
2008-08-26T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tapout	the latter
