2006-06-12T14:56:00.000Z	udo		i dont have multimedia system selector why?
2006-06-12T14:56:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	it is invoked via ``gstreamer-properties''
2006-06-12T14:57:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	"Multimedia System Selector" is hidden via menu spec in Dapper. Invoke it from the Terminal or alt+F2
2006-06-12T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	pastebin the output from ``cat /proc/asound/cards && amixer''
2006-06-12T15:07:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	type the command I gave you into a Terminal, then paste that output onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-06-12T15:07:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	then tell me the URL
2006-06-12T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	the command is in the quotation marks
2006-06-12T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	ok, great. Please pastebin ``cat ~/.asoundrc* && amixer''
2006-06-12T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	(use pastebin, not the channel)
2006-06-12T15:39:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	I'll attempt to read that shortly, very busy atm
2006-06-12T15:41:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	I have the URL; I'm just swamped atm
2006-06-12T15:44:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	can you hear anything with ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''?
2006-06-12T15:45:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	do you have multiple sound devices?
2006-06-12T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	which device are you trying to use?
2006-06-12T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	Has sound ever been audible?
2006-06-12T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	have you ever heard anything from that sound device?
2006-06-12T15:51:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	try: amixer set 'External Amplifier' off
2006-06-12T16:00:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	according to your pastebin you do.
2006-06-13T16:02:00.000Z	crimsun_	udo	I gave you the command.
