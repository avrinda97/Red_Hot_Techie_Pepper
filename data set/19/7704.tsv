2007-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	greg_		guys, anyone can help with laptops and hibernation problems ??
2007-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	 how are you hibernating the laptop , and did you use acpi?
2007-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	I'm tryinh sudo s2disk, choosing from shutdown menu or closing the lid
2007-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	I got same action almost every time, sometimes it does work but rarely
2007-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	are you using the swap partition as the location for the hibernate image?
2007-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	it goes to terminal, then is saying that it takes system snapshot and then nothing happens
2007-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	when it works it's saving image on disk
2007-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	im not sure if hibernate is properly implemented yet
2007-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	I thought it's happening by default, image goes to SWZP
2007-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	hm ....
2007-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	it's very strange as this works sometimes
2007-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	the same used to happen to me. although I thought they would have solved the problem by now
2007-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	are you still having this problem or did you solved it ?
2007-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	did you have luck with this problem or still same ?
2007-09-28T16:57:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	you should also be aware that hibernation sometimes takes a very long time
2007-09-28T16:58:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	might be true, but it's just not happening, it doesn't persist image to disk, disk is not flashing and after minute of blank screen it just switches of
2007-09-28T16:58:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	oh
2007-09-28T16:59:00.000Z	BobSapp	greg_	i never had that.
2007-09-28T16:59:00.000Z	greg_	BobSapp	:) thx Bob
