2011-08-31T01:05:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		There are files in ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata that seem to indicate info about the samba network drive I have connected to.  I would like to read them so I can find the actual bash address for that samba connection.  But when I open the files in gedit ... I get an encoding error.
2011-08-31T01:05:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		How do I discover the bash address of the samba connection?
2011-08-31T01:07:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		yes I want to write a bash script to copy files to the attached samba share folder
2011-08-31T01:08:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		it's empty
2011-08-31T01:08:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		and I am connected
2011-08-31T01:08:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		but in .local/share/gvfs-metadata there are alot of files that reference the samba share by name
2011-08-31T01:08:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		yet I can't read them
2011-08-31T01:09:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		yes
2011-08-31T01:11:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		maybe I should unmount it through Nautilus.  That is how I had mounted them
2011-08-31T01:11:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma		how do I mount a samba share through bash then?
2011-08-31T01:12:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	mount -t cifs //server/share /mountpoint
2011-08-31T01:13:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	you need to add -o username=<your username> if your windows username is not the same as your Ubuntu username
2011-08-31T01:19:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	you need smbfs package installed
2011-08-31T01:21:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	you need smbfs package installed for mount to work, run sudo apt-get install smbfs
2011-08-31T01:23:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	oh ok, you can always try IP, well there is a way to use NMBD to resolve short names, but thats another story
2011-08-31T01:40:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	you can add the line to /etc/fstab if it needs password you would have to enter the password there in plaintext
2011-08-31T01:40:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma	HeGuru	a bit insecure?
2011-08-31T01:41:00.000Z	BrianOfTacoma	HeGuru	I'm wondering if there's a way to do that requires a user input of the password?
2011-08-31T01:42:00.000Z	HeGuru	BrianOfTacoma	I never tried it, but I would guess it would ask for the password at boot if you dont enter it in fstab
