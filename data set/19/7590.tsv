2007-09-12T07:50:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		wow...i have an all-night project...my boss' laptop and installing ubuntu on it.  quite the task, i tell ya what.  it's a custom gateway so i might be needing some help later :S
2007-09-12T07:52:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ciorapel:  try formatting it ext3 and change the /etc/fstab
2007-09-12T07:52:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		countx: is there an icon by the clock?
2007-09-12T07:52:00.000Z	CountX	fatcatmatt	yes
2007-09-12T07:53:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		countx: try that then
2007-09-12T07:53:00.000Z	CountX	fatcatmatt	same thing, no shutdown or restart
2007-09-12T07:53:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ciorapel: go into gparted "sudo gparted" and format the drive as ext3
2007-09-12T07:53:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ciorapel: if you dont have it, then install it using the add/remove
2007-09-12T07:54:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ciorapel: it will come up after install under the system > administration menu
2007-09-12T07:54:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	logreeval	 install sysinfo from the add/remove
2007-09-12T07:55:00.000Z	CountX	fatcatmatt	anything?
2007-09-12T07:55:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		countx: what do you mean, anything?  there should be a shutdown option icon to the right of your clock unless you have removed it
2007-09-12T07:56:00.000Z	CountX	fatcatmatt	no its there, but the menu it brings up doesnt have a shutdown or restart
2007-09-12T07:56:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ciorapel: it's a trick.  open a terminal and type "sudo mkdir /media/disk"
2007-09-12T07:56:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		countx: hmm...that gets me...
2007-09-12T07:57:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		don't flood, ciorapel.
2007-09-12T07:57:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		ciorapel: what was the hard drive label?
2007-09-12T07:57:00.000Z	fatcatmatt		no...sda what
2007-09-12T07:58:00.000Z	CountX	fatcatmatt	thats why i said "anything?"
