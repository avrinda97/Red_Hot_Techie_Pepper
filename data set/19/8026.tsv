2007-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	josenj		Hi all.... what I can use to run Quicktime movies under Firefox?
2007-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	mozilla-mplayer
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	josenj		Thanks lethu, but I'm getting "No picture" when hit a site that has QuickTime
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	josenj		Any other idea lethu?
2007-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	are you sure firefox actually uses the mplayer plugin? usually it uses totem's plugin by default
2007-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	josenj	lethu	how can I check?
2007-05-15T09:55:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	see if the quicktime video area looks like mplayer or totem
2007-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	josenj	lethu	can't say for sure, it's just a black box where the Quicktime is suppose to play and in the middle of the black box it just says "(no picutre)"
2007-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	okey tell me what you have in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
2007-05-15T09:59:00.000Z	josenj	lethu	I have the following files: libjavaplugin.so  libvlcplugin.so  raclass.zip
2007-05-15T10:00:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	looks like you are missing plugins, you sure you have mozilla-mplayer installed?
2007-05-15T10:01:00.000Z	lethu		!ops
2007-05-15T10:03:00.000Z	josenj	lethu	I think I fix it, what I did was "sudo apt-get remove mozilla-plugin-vlc" and relauched Firefox.... and now it works... but I have small black dashes on top of the video, I can see the video fine but it has small black dishes
2007-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	lethu		joseaa, nice, dunno about the black dashes issue though srry
2007-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	nice, dunno about the black dashes issue though srry
2007-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	lethu		joseaa, srry wrong person
2007-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	josenj		Thanks, lethu, with the ls on that directory I wouldn't even though vlc was the problem....
2007-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	josenj		though = thought
2007-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	lethu	josenj	yw : )
