2006-12-21T09:57:00.000Z	LjL		!libgtk2.0-dev
2006-12-21T09:59:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	dude, I already got it libgtk2.0-dev is already the newest version. but still getting this error You have to install the Gtk+ development (and runtime?) libraries version 2.4.x or superior.
2006-12-21T10:00:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	link to the tarball you're trying to compile please
2006-12-21T10:01:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	http://web.tiscali.it/sharp/xfprot/xfprot-1.17.tar.gz
2006-12-21T10:03:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	not gonna work ?
2006-12-21T10:04:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	a second sorry
2006-12-21T10:05:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	yeah sure :-) Thanks for your time dude
2006-12-21T10:05:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	that's f-prot?
2006-12-21T10:05:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	no it's just the GTK interface of f-prot
2006-12-21T10:07:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	i think that needs gtk 1.2 -- try installing libgtk1.2-dev
2006-12-21T10:08:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	ok lemme try
2006-12-21T10:08:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	just the same
2006-12-21T10:10:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	well, actually it gives one less error
2006-12-21T10:10:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	Ok, do you recommend any other antivirus for linux with GUI ?
2006-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	well, you mean antivirus for linux *that check for Windows viruses*, i suppose?
2006-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	I download many files here and I actually have broken my friends PCs by burning DVDs and giving it to them hehe so pathatic windows users
2006-12-21T10:13:00.000Z	LjL	Madeye	clamav has interfaces for GTK and KDE shipped in the repos... but i don't think it's nearly as good as f-prot as a scanner
2006-12-21T10:14:00.000Z	Madeye	LjL	I've also tried my luck with clamav but got this The following packages have unmet dependencies.
