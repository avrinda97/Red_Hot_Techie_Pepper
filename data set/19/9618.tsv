2008-07-08T09:01:00.000Z	dpeach		I have an nVidia Ti4600 card and have tried installing drivers through the Restricted Drivers wizard. Then I tried the envyng tool. Then the nVidia driver from their site. All with the same result. It just reboots to a black screen. I am not sure what log to check to see why it crashed.
2008-07-08T09:02:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	/var/log/Xorg.log or /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-07-08T09:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	pastebin the log
2008-07-08T09:17:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	ok
2008-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	probably easiest to just boot to livecd and use that, otherwise see if there is a pastebin script in ubuntu repositories
2008-07-08T09:42:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	finally got the pastbin of my X log: http://pastebin.com/m63bbf9ac
2008-07-08T09:43:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	monitor isn't getting detected correctly, try specifying a manual resolution in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-07-08T10:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	specify modes in defaultdepth subsection in the bottom of xorg.conf
2008-07-08T10:17:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	ok.
2008-07-08T10:18:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	something like Modes "AxB" where AxB is the resolution you want
2008-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	can you point me to something that shows me what this is supposed to look like? The default depth subsection?
2008-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	Modes "AxB" where "AxB" is the resolution you want
2008-07-08T10:23:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	at the top of the xorg.conf file in the "Screen" section there is a Defaultdepth and it says 24 does what you are saying go under that?
2008-07-08T10:24:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	yes
2008-07-08T10:27:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	we are getting somewhere. The very short log file says at the end "Fatal server error: no screens found" and then gives some errors having to do with xf86CloseConsole and xf86OpenConsole
2008-07-08T10:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	you probably messed up the syntax for the screens section then
2008-07-08T10:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dpeach	http://blogs.sun.com/alanbur/resource/xorg.conf  have a look here, notice at the very bottom it has the Modes line, do it like that
2008-07-08T10:29:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	thank you.
2008-07-08T10:39:00.000Z	dpeach	Fryguy--	I can't believe this. The problem was my second monitor. Just being plugged in, it kept the machine from starting X. I unplugged it and it started right up.
