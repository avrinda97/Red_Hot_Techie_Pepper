2007-05-29T10:54:00.000Z	fogwar	bruenig	2.2
2007-05-29T10:54:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	right but with some deb or what?
2007-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	but what is the name of the package, is it a .rpm?
2007-05-29T10:59:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	yeah, what is the format of this package, is it a .rpm?
2007-05-29T11:00:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	what is it that you need out of 2.2 to begin with
2007-05-29T11:00:00.000Z	fogwar	bruenig	is there any difference?
2007-05-29T11:00:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	I don't know, you are the one itching to get 2.2, I assumed there was some reason?
2007-05-29T11:00:00.000Z	fogwar	bruenig	well, first i wanted to learn how to update something w/o having to uninstall it since it wont let me
2007-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	iirc open office puts out rpms, that will not work in ubuntu
2007-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	fogwar	bruenig	?
2007-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	?
2007-05-29T11:02:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	you always need to uninstall something before you update, even when you upgrade something from the package manager it uninstalls the version before it first
2007-05-29T11:02:00.000Z	fogwar	bruenig	so i should uninstall it via advanced even if it says not to in basic?
2007-05-29T11:03:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	you should not uninstall it period, you will not be able to install 2.2 because it isn't the right format and if you uninstall you will break a lot
2007-05-29T11:05:00.000Z	fogwar	bruenig	can u do something for me? can u see if http://cougarmail.ccccd.edu/ lets you connect on your comp--- its saying i cant connect. all it should do is prompt user and password
2007-05-29T11:05:00.000Z	bruenig	fogwar	no connection
