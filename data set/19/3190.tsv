2012-04-04T17:08:00.000Z	somebody__		i still wasn't able to run a sed command to append a line after the first line on a set of files. i tried this: find . -type f -iname '*.tex' -depth 2 -exec sed "" '1a\ test' * {} + ..doesn't work :(
2012-04-04T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	run it on one file first instead of all files.  And "doesn't work" is too vague.
2012-04-04T17:10:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	point taken. will try one file first. brb
2012-04-04T17:12:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	same problem. it displays the entire content of the file (as if using cat or sed -n)
2012-04-04T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	right.  If you want to actually write to a file, you use -i.  But note your syntax in find seems wrong.  I'm not sure why you have a '*'
2012-04-04T17:14:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	i'll try -i . the * in the end was for writing to all files..that isn't how it's done, is it?
2012-04-04T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	you're already asking find to go through each file matching the parameters you gave and execute a command on the file found.  Try putting an "echo find" instead of "find" in your command and you should get a clearer picture of what's going on
2012-04-04T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	also, don't use -i until you're sure the sed command is doing what you want :)
2012-04-04T17:16:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	the find commad works fine. used it before for find and replace with sed. can't get append after line number with sed to work now..
2012-04-04T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	yes, you find the right things but don't execute the correct command to do what you want; thus my suggestion
2012-04-04T17:18:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	yes. i'm trying now on one file only but for sed -i "" '1 a\?test'\ test.tex i'm getting error message "sed: -i may not be used with stdin
2012-04-04T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	why are you passing "" (seems useless) and why are you escaping the space before "test.tex"?
2012-04-04T17:19:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	RL is forcing me  afk. i'll be back in an hour and gna keep trying then
2012-04-04T17:19:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	i'll correct htat real quick
2012-04-04T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	RL?
2012-04-04T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	never mind.
2012-04-04T17:20:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	it worked without \, nice
2012-04-04T17:20:00.000Z	somebody__	jrib	thanks a lot
2012-04-04T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	somebody__	no problem
