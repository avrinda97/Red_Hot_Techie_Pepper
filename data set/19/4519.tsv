2008-12-30T22:14:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	Root should have no login. There should be a !     between     root:                and               :123456            (or whatever number here)
2008-12-30T22:15:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	what's there I assume is a hash of the password? It's a bunch of random numbers and letters
2008-12-30T22:15:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	Yes, thats an md5 hash of the current password
2008-12-30T22:16:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	okay, so if I remove that I should be able to use root? or?
2008-12-30T22:17:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	or, uh, when would one have been prompted to set a root password? I might remember it.
2008-12-30T22:19:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	Ubuntu is designed to NOT use root account. Things requiring admin rights should be done instead with sudo
2008-12-30T22:19:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	unfortunately sudoers is broken, so...that's not possible
2008-12-30T22:20:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	I would recommend to use a default type sudoers file. Should be only 2 entries in it.
2008-12-30T22:21:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	well, the person I was talking to before told me I can like...chmod 044 or something and fix the sudoers file
2008-12-30T22:21:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	3 lines actually... eg: Defaults        env_reset         and: root    ALL=(ALL) ALL                      and another line of: %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL                And yes should be permissions like 644 or such
2008-12-30T22:22:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	but that was the error I was getting in the terminal, that I couldn't use the sudoers because it was set to 66 something instead of 0440 or whatever
2008-12-30T22:23:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	Boot to recovery mode kernel. Then issue:   chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
2008-12-30T22:24:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	ok, how do I boot into a recovery mode?
2008-12-30T22:24:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	Hit esc during grub. Choose the recovery kernel line.   Then boot to that. Issue the chmod line. Then after: telinit 2
2008-12-30T22:26:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	what does telinit 2 do? O_o
2008-12-30T22:26:00.000Z	genii	neurologic	telinit 2        puts the computer into multi-user mode from single-user mode ("recovery")
2008-12-30T22:27:00.000Z	neurologic	genii	ah ok. well thanks. I'll brb hopefully
