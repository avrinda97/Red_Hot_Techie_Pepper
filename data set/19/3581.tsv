2010-01-01T02:39:00.000Z	tanath		syslog, messages, everything
2010-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	your CPU is filling your hard drive??? what?
2010-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	cpu is overheating, filling the logs
2010-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	or was until my disk was full
2010-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	ohh have you tried disassembling the PC and blowing it out with something?  I use an air compresser -- probaly get a dust fog out of it
2010-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	i can solve that prob. i need help with the logs
2010-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	sudo echo "" > log_name
2010-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	zsh: file exists: /var/log/syslog
2010-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	gotta use bash for that
2010-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	methinks zsh is superior
2010-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	yeah but the command wont work with zsh ;)
2010-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	just gotta tweak the command
2010-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	gonna have to downgrade for about 5 seconds
2010-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	tanath	nerdy_kid	already deleted that one and several more obscenely large logs with mc. gonna reboot in a min
2010-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	tanath	oh ok well good luck!
