2007-11-26T06:01:00.000Z	emet	ToddEDM	try doing it in the GUI package manager Adept
2007-11-26T06:02:00.000Z	emet	ToddEDM	you know how to use Adept or Synaptec?
2007-11-26T06:02:00.000Z	emet	ToddEDM	 you might have to resync your package list too that is "sudo apt-get update"
2007-11-26T06:02:00.000Z	emet	ToddEDM	 I assure you ubuntu-desktop is a valid package, so you have some kinda problem on your side
2007-11-26T06:04:00.000Z	ToddEDM	emet	 it was the update, i updated, and now ubuntu is installing
