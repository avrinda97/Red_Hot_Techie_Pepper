2005-05-02T15:08:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	stop whatever is using the sound card and try the new process then
2005-05-02T15:09:00.000Z	ircbot_	liable	i did stop using it
2005-05-02T15:14:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	are you just stopping play on xmms or killing it?
2005-05-02T15:17:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	what driver is xmms using, use that on your other apps
2005-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	alsa or oss? what else are you trying to get sound on
2005-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	ircbot_	liable	psi, gnome
2005-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	yes probably cause it uses oss emulation
2005-05-02T15:22:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	kill xmms, leave it for a minute,(there is a timeout for switching sound from one process to another) then try your gnome sounds
2005-05-24T14:58:00.000Z	liable	ircbot_	supend2 work good for me, but its a patch and compile
