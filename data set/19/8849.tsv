2007-06-08T16:12:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	no it sees the ubuntu partition but it does not see the shared partition with no os. and it says there is some error in partition table
2007-06-08T16:13:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	steel_lady	is it a NTFS or EXT3 partition?

2007-06-08T16:13:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	steel_lady	have you tried chkdsk on it from windows?
2007-06-08T16:13:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	yes but it doesn't see the partition

2007-06-08T16:15:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	can you tell me in the meantime when you boot with live ubuntu how to see al the partitions from it?
2007-06-08T16:17:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	I don't understand you I probably missed something

2007-06-08T16:23:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	steel_lady	what is "them"
2007-06-08T16:23:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	windows partition and shared partition
2007-06-08T16:42:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	we are in live CD. the idea es to start the installation and fix partition from the dialog from the installation in ubuntu. So we go to manually edit partitions and there it sees only the whole hard disk that actually has partitions buntu, shared FAT32 and win. but it doesn't show them. is it possible to fix it this way somehow?
2007-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	steel_lady	open up a term window
2007-06-08T16:46:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	what do I write in terminal?
2007-06-08T16:47:00.000Z	steel_lady	r00tintheb0x	it does not give anything
