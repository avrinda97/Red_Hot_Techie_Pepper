2009-05-15T23:47:00.000Z	martin29		i've just installed an apache server in my home machine (ubuntu), and it seems to work... how do i make it accesible from the outside, now?
2009-05-15T23:48:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	Too many variables.  But simple WAG would be port fwd port 80 to the internal machine assuming you are behind a NAT device.
2009-05-15T23:51:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 are you attemping to get to it from your PC?
2009-05-15T23:51:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	yep
2009-05-15T23:52:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	should i try from a web proxy ?
2009-05-15T23:52:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 that probably won't work.
2009-05-15T23:53:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	you can try from outside and see.
2009-05-15T23:54:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 from inside the router might be confused with the hair pinning.
2009-05-15T23:54:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	you would need to if  you are blocking it currently :)
2009-05-15T23:55:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	i just did... is my computer like totally insecure right now?
2009-05-15T23:57:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 well if you run a webserver connected to the public internet there is some level of insecurity. need to make sure all the scripts etc are secure..
2009-05-15T23:58:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 hitting your ip with a browser bring up php proxy, is that what you where looking to do?
2009-05-15T23:58:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	i guess you already tried my ip  :)
2009-05-16T00:01:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 yep already tried ..
2009-05-16T00:02:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	cool it works... i couldn't try it myself, but a friend helped
2009-05-16T00:02:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	thanks a lot
2009-05-16T00:02:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	now, can i protect my homepage with a password ?
2009-05-16T00:03:00.000Z	dooner	martin29	 if running apache, just google for htaccess and you should be all set. for the password stuff
2009-05-16T00:03:00.000Z	martin29	dooner	cool, thanks
