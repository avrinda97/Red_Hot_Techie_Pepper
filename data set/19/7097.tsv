2007-10-11T09:46:00.000Z	joshua--	mc44	yeah, i downloaded it, but i dont know how to use it. :/
2007-10-11T09:46:00.000Z	mc44	joshua--	do "ndiswrapper -l" in a terminal
2007-10-11T09:47:00.000Z	joshua--	mc44	is that ndiswrapper -one? or l ?
2007-10-11T09:48:00.000Z	joshua--	mc44	ndiswrapper -l returns nothing.
2007-10-11T09:49:00.000Z	mc44	joshua--	ndiswrapper -h
2007-10-11T09:49:00.000Z	mc44	joshua--	should show whether ndiswrapper is installed properly if you get the help insturctions
2007-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	mc44	joshua--	just run "ndiswrapper"
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	joshua--	mc44	yeah, that does nothing, the program just runs and then stops because i am give it no arguments.
2007-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	mc44	joshua--	you're sure its actually installed? :) ndiswrapper should return the help page

2007-10-11T09:54:00.000Z	mc44	joshua--	ok then you need to get the windows drivers for the wireless adaptor and find the .inf file
