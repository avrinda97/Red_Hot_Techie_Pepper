2007-07-15T10:14:00.000Z	brunner		how much does support for ATI suck versus nvidia?
2007-07-15T10:15:00.000Z	brunner		which is worse, if NV isn't an option? Intel or ATI?
2007-07-15T10:16:00.000Z	brunner		which generally has better linux support? Intel or ATI?
2007-07-15T10:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	intel
2007-07-15T10:16:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	Intel has better support?
2007-07-15T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	intel has provided open source drivers for almost all their products, ATI has provided sh*t drivers for all of their products
2007-07-15T10:21:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	laptop with a screen smaller than 15" with resolution greater than or equal to 1400x1050 that has NV video.
2007-07-15T10:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	Ron Paul 08 :)
2007-07-15T10:23:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	damn right =] 
2007-07-15T10:23:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	my girlfriend has had dinner with Ron Paul, actually
2007-07-15T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	I think that the new macbook pro's are at least 1440x900 @ 15''
2007-07-15T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	And they are Nvidia
2007-07-15T10:29:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	woah, really? I'll take a look. thanks!
2007-07-15T10:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	Probably won't run well with Linux until at least Gutsy though
2007-07-15T10:32:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	what won't run Linux well?
2007-07-15T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	New macbook pro
2007-07-15T10:34:00.000Z	brunner	Jordan_U	why wouldn't it run linux?
2007-07-15T10:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	Because Apple tends to do strange / proprietary configs
2007-07-15T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brunner	Do you care about nvidia for the drivers or do you need to do serious 3D ( intel has better drivers and is more than enough for Compiz Fusion )
