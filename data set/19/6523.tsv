2009-11-11T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	it doesnt seem to support linux, its also offtopic
2009-11-11T17:53:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	it does.  It has a hardy heron.
2009-11-11T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	seems they do have a linux client, my mistake
2009-11-11T17:53:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	I wasn't aware backup apps for Ubuntu was offtopic, sorry.
2009-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	no, its just not an official package so we cannot really support it
2009-11-11T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	the guide seems painless enough though
2009-11-11T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	give it a go. Ive not heard of it
2009-11-11T17:55:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	I got what I wanted anyway.  I just wanted some backup system online which works.  It was my first question.  That one came after I got no answer.
2009-11-11T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	$10 for 100Gb / month aint bad at all
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	I'm doing this gratis for some retired guy.  I think he'll want whatever is free first ;)
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	why not just buy a 1Tb HDD, backup to that then disconnect the device?
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	ubuntuone gives a small amount of space
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	said retired guy has no computer skills.  Less user intervention = win
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	true
2009-11-11T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	could setup a cron job to scp the data to your system, you could be his backup
2009-11-11T17:58:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	I considered trying to setup an ftp/sftp mounted as a folder which points to a part of my webhosting, but if this is built-in, I can be hit by a truck, and it still works.
2009-11-11T17:58:00.000Z	scratchme	ActionParsnip	is the 2GB licensed in Ubuntu one per user on the system?
2009-11-11T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	you can install openssh-server then configure his system to upload his stuff at midnight to your system via scp, You can then even archive it off using rsync after the upload to form a differential backup
2009-11-11T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scratchme	no idea. ive never used it
