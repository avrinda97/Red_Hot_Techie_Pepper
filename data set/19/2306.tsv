2012-11-26T15:12:00.000Z	jasper22		if in my 2 network cards $> arp -v     doesn't show entries for second network card - does it mean that second card is not connected ?
2012-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	jasper22		I mean 'arp -v'  show entries and all of them belong to eth0  - no entries for eth1
2012-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Not generally. If there is no traffic on the second card, there are no ARP elements.
2012-11-26T15:14:00.000Z	jasper22	Lachezar	this is a problem.... I could not setup 2 network on computer with 2 network-cards
2012-11-26T15:16:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	'ifconfig eth1' what does it show?
2012-11-26T15:18:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	'route -n'?
2012-11-26T15:20:00.000Z	jasper22	Lachezar	this is 'server' computer:  http://pastebin.com/bfp1nV6C
2012-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	jasper22	Lachezar	'Storage' computer:  http://pastebin.com/CsvwrsUZ
2012-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Well... There is RX and TX on the eth1, so it seems it works.
2012-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	jasper22	Lachezar	yes... it seems it work
2012-11-26T15:22:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	ping 172.16.0.2 (or whatever is the IP of the other computer).
2012-11-26T15:24:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Now do an 'arp -an'
2012-11-26T15:24:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	What is the IP of the other computer?
2012-11-26T15:26:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Are you sure the two LANs are not connected to the same switch?
2012-11-26T15:26:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Cross-Cables?
2012-11-26T15:27:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Well... As long as those are real CROSS cables it _should_ work...
2012-11-26T15:27:00.000Z	jasper22	Lachezar	it's not the same cable that I plug into the router isn't it ?
2012-11-26T15:34:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	I'm having problems connecting my two laptops (Lenovo Thinkpads) with a straight cable, and I was forced to use a crossed cable.
2012-11-26T15:41:00.000Z	Lachezar	jasper22	Do you have a crossed cable to try with?
