2006-04-25T07:52:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	that's not true that aptitude is not recommended.
2006-04-25T07:52:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	Well the places I went to (remastering KNOPPIX) said so.
2006-04-25T07:52:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	that's not our position
2006-04-25T07:53:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	Well a couple of times a ran a nested X server and used Synaptic from with the chroot. Surely that is frowned upon (come on, I've got to be breaking SOME rules)
2006-04-25T08:32:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	we recommend the ubuntu nvidia packages here
2006-04-25T08:33:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	I've had problems with them and no problems with nvidia .run
2006-04-25T08:33:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	please don't advise that here
2006-04-25T08:33:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	that will install files not under package management
2006-04-25T08:34:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	I would be happy not to. Would you be happy to advise me on how to get the ubuntu packages to build for my 2.6.15-18-386 kenel?
2006-04-25T08:34:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	why would you build them?
2006-04-25T08:35:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	Sorry but I've had too many problems with the Dapper packages for 15-20 (the 15-18 ones aren't there any more) and I'm probably an expert on nvidia installation since I've had so many problems on so many distributions for so long :(
2006-04-25T08:35:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	this isn't a dapper channel, anyway
2006-04-25T08:36:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	you may be, but people who try to follow advice they see you giving are likely not always going to be
2006-04-25T08:36:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	You did notice that I started my response with "a lot of people are having problems but I got the nvidia package to run" then I pointed out what is bad about the nvidia package (besides, the --uninstall option removes it when Dapper has sorted it out)
2006-04-25T08:37:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	I would only really recommend the official one for a 15-18 kernel which cannot be upgraded to 15-20
2006-04-25T08:37:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	please discuss dapper in #ubuntu+1
2006-04-25T08:38:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	I know, I know. I'm done now
2006-04-25T11:18:00.000Z	tritium_	Warbo	it was buggy, and not maintained
2006-04-25T11:18:00.000Z	Warbo	tritium_	Yeah, but I don;t understand alsactrl
