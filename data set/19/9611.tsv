2008-04-08T20:25:00.000Z	dtolj	eax	it should pick it up automatically if you have hot-plugging enabled
2008-04-08T20:25:00.000Z	eax	dtolj	Not sure if I have :) Just installed this day, where do I enable it?
2008-04-08T20:25:00.000Z	dtolj	eax	gnome-volume-properties
2008-04-08T20:26:00.000Z	eax	dtolj	In terminal or synaptic?
2008-04-08T20:26:00.000Z	dtolj	eax	terminal
