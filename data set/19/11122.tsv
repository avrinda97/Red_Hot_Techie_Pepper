2006-03-28T08:58:00.000Z	fiendskull9	moulty	ive been up all night, and i need something to carry me on through the day
2006-03-28T08:58:00.000Z	moulty	fiendskull9	np, what cpu you running?
2006-03-28T08:58:00.000Z	moulty	fiendskull9	lol
2006-03-28T08:58:00.000Z	fiendskull9	moulty	its intel p3
2006-03-28T09:00:00.000Z	moulty	fiendskull9	i think its ok to upgrade breezy to dapper with distro upgade, if its breezy i386 to dapper i386, not i386 to amd64, but it dont apply to you anyway ;)
2006-03-28T09:01:00.000Z	moulty	fiendskull9	i managed it once i386 to i386 np, but the other time it was i386 to amd64, it went horridly wrong
