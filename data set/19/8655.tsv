2008-01-02T10:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	thnks
2008-04-10T23:42:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	nah, it doesn't work like that anymore
2008-04-10T23:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	how does it work now.. ? I get confused after DApper
2008-04-10T23:43:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	since gutsy, you don't have to explicitly load modules
2008-04-10T23:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	k.. so how does dromer turn off glx.. from terminal?
2008-04-10T23:45:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	generally, you would just fix whatever is wrong with glx
2008-04-10T23:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	looks like dromer 's log is showing a Nvidia GLX with intel graphics.. Is that normal..?
2008-04-10T23:59:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	yeah, that's bad
2009-03-26T07:57:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	how is the experience any different? all apps should behave identically since they're seeing the same xinerama info
2009-03-26T07:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	you mean the difference between twinview and xinerama?
2009-03-26T07:59:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	ah, that's just nvidia being broken :) as long as it sets the xinerama info (ie telling apps where the physical monitors are), fullscreen and such should work
2009-03-26T08:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	yes with xinerama.. twinnview I think it sets it up as one large space thus "full screen" means "across both monitors".. I think you just said that but wanted to reitterate it differntly
2009-03-26T08:01:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	no, my point is that that's not supposed to happen
2009-03-26T08:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	with either twinnview or xinerama?
2009-03-26T08:02:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	both twinview and xinerama should be using the xinerama protocol to tell apps about the physical monitors
2009-03-26T08:04:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	the only time I know of when twinview won't is if you enable the second monitor after starting X (XRandR 1.2 doesn't have that flaw, but nvidia still hasn't implemented it)
2009-03-26T08:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	crdlb	ah.. k.. broken or not I would like to see three modes available.. twinnview (the way it works now), xinerama (two independant screens with drag across capability) and for lack of a better term, "Mirror" so what's on one is also on the other.
2009-03-26T08:06:00.000Z	crdlb	Scunizi	imho, apps should just support displaying things across both monitors (optionally)
