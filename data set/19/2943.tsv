2009-11-21T02:53:00.000Z	broken-iPod		Can somebody please help me?  I'm very frustrated at this point.
2009-11-21T02:54:00.000Z	broken-iPod		Why is it do difficult to install Flash?  I've tried multiple methods and none of them work.
2009-11-21T02:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	"sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree" allways worked for me
2009-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	broken-iPod	erUSUL	Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "flashplugin-nonfree"
2009-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	erUSUL		!info flashplugin-nonfree | broken-iPod
2009-11-21T02:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	maybe you do not have multiverse enabled ? Go to System>Admin>Software sources
2009-11-21T02:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	in the first tab tick the multiverse repo
2009-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	broken-iPod		Why is it such a difficult task?  Why can't I just go to Adobe's website and download it, then the installer actually works?  Or why can't Firefox do it on its own?
2009-11-21T02:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	legal issues; copyright; software patents and all that s**t makes this things complicated in a free as in freedom world
2009-11-21T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	you pay nothing for the OS you have to jump some hoops; the package to read comercial DVD can not even bee in multiverse it has to be in its own repo outside the USA
2009-11-21T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	which is BTW the country that makes this things so sh**ty
2009-11-21T03:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	understand now ?
2009-11-21T03:00:00.000Z	broken-iPod		Apparently I had to update something.
2009-11-21T03:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	go ahead
2009-11-21T03:00:00.000Z	broken-iPod		Now it works in Ubuntu Software Center
2009-11-21T03:01:00.000Z	broken-iPod		But it didn't before, which makes no sense.
2009-11-21T03:01:00.000Z	broken-iPod		Oh well, I got it.  Bye.
2009-11-21T03:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	after enabling multiverse install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package that package instals flash java mp3 support and a bunch of other video codecs and stuff
2009-11-21T03:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	broken-iPod	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restricted-extras
