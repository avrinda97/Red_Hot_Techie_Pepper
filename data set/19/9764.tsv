2007-07-15T14:01:00.000Z	HOT	tarzeau	no that restarts the x server, he wants to stop it
2007-07-15T14:01:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	no c-a-backpsace doesn't restart the x server
2007-07-15T14:01:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	it really only kills it
2007-07-15T14:01:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	please read man xorg.conf
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	exactly
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	it only kills x
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	something else restarts it
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	you can read the whole detail at man xorg.conf
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	HOT	tarzeau	i see...and how does that stop him being back in X?
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	he first needs to stop whatever restarts his x session
2007-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	probably gdm, i don't know
2007-07-15T14:04:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	some people start it with inittab, others with gdm/wdm. i use startx
2007-07-15T14:04:00.000Z	HOT	tarzeau	i know, and he was told ctrl+alt+backspace, and that will restart X
2007-07-15T14:04:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	no ctrl-alt-backspace will only kill x
2007-07-15T14:04:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	it will not restart x
2007-07-15T14:04:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	what you say is technically wrong
2007-07-15T14:05:00.000Z	HOT	tarzeau	i think your missing the point, technically wrong or not, it doesnt give the bloke what he wants, do you see that?
2007-07-15T14:05:00.000Z	tarzeau	HOT	well if you read further what i said it gives the bloke what he wants
2007-07-15T14:07:00.000Z	HOT	tarzeau	anyway i was hoping to lead him to  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop and explain how to ctrl+alt+fX to switch consoles, hes gone now anyway
