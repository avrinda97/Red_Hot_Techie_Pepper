2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	russianzilla		Hey, is anyone here familiar with using an Xbox 360 wired controller with Hardy?
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	btfx	russianzilla	not likely =\
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	btfx		poor pip..
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	russianzilla	btfx	Not likely it'll work?
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	russianzilla		It's very weird, I used a guide on the Ubuntu wiki.
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	btfx	russianzilla	Not likely someone here has done it
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	btfx		oh
2008-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	russianzilla		Which worked the first time, but after I unplugged it once I plugged it in again it stopped working.
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	btfx	russianzilla	I may be wrong...
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	btfx	russianzilla	how many times did you reboot =P
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	russianzilla		So far once.
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	btfx		hehheh
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	russianzilla		I tried to redo the guide a few times but it didn't get me anywhere.
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	russianzilla		Here's something more general then.
2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	btfx		sorry, I have no idea really =\
2008-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	russianzilla		I found a different guide, but it says I need to make sure that the old module I was using for the controller has been removed.
2008-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	btfx		ok
2008-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	russianzilla		I went into the joystick kernel modules and deleted the xpad file, so does that mean it's been unloaded then?
2008-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	btfx	russianzilla	AFAIK yes
