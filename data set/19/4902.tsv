2011-08-17T08:04:00.000Z	stanley_		Hi Guys, need some serious help with my graphics card...anybody got some time?
2011-08-17T08:06:00.000Z	stanley_		ok running natty with an ATI technologies inc Rage 128 RK/VR graphics card, need to install the driver so I can get desktop effects and a clearer resolution
2011-08-17T08:07:00.000Z	stanley_		propriety drivers arent available
2011-08-17T08:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	single monitor system?
2011-08-17T08:09:00.000Z	stanley_		yepp single monitor
2011-08-17T08:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	what res do you use?
2011-08-17T08:13:00.000Z	stanley_		right now I am restriced to 1024 x 768 because my graphics card driver isn't installed properly, but you can see that the screen is out of focused and it fits awkwardly on the monitor
2011-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	is 1024x768 ok for you if it was sharper?
2011-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	stanley_		Essentially I would like to use a larger resolution
2011-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	that's what I'm asking. What res do you want?
2011-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	stanley_		it would be if it was sharper
2011-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	stanley_		I am not 100% certain what resolution I would like really it depends on how it fits on my screen once I see it
2011-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	stanley_		but 1024 x 768 would be ok if it were sharper
2011-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	ok run:  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	paste in this text: http://pastebin.com/Av4NA1jY
2011-08-17T08:17:00.000Z	stanley_		ok and save?
2011-08-17T08:19:00.000Z	stanley_	ActionParsnip	ok I pasted and saved that
2011-08-17T08:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanley_	ok, reboot to test. If it is bad then hold shift at boot, select roecovery mode then select root and run:  mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_old       note the X ni X11 is capitalized. You can then run: reboot and you will be back where you are now
2011-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	stanley_	ActionParsnip	ok if it is good what should I expect?
