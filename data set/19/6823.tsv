2007-12-02T07:46:00.000Z	clanmac10		althetuxman:Mate I know.. I got the driver setup, thats not the question
2007-12-02T07:47:00.000Z	clanmac10		When a window opens, the top wigets on the tool bar of that window keep getting stuck under the top panel
2007-12-02T07:48:00.000Z	clanmac10		So you have to press Alt+left mouse to move it down the screen
2007-12-02T07:49:00.000Z	clanmac10		in other words, how do you default were a window start in the screen on gnaome
2007-12-02T07:49:00.000Z	clanmac10		s/in/on
2007-12-02T07:49:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	you need to look into the "devilspie" app
2007-12-02T07:56:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	probably not possible with gnome / metacity, devilspie can probably make rules for ALL apps, still probably your best bet
2007-12-02T07:57:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	I must have missed the initial conversation, where is it placing your apps now?
2007-12-02T08:00:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	ok that is wierd, normally that should not happen, this on a pretyt new ubuntu install?
2007-12-02T08:01:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	so the top appears beneath the top gnome panel?
2007-12-02T08:02:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	did this start happening at any point, or did it do this from the beginning?
2007-12-02T08:03:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	I would try to right click ont he panel and change it's positon to the bottom and back to the top, and then change it's size and then put the size back to maybe reset the X settings dealing with parts of the screen like that
2007-12-02T08:13:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	are you using metacity or compiz atm?
2007-12-02T08:17:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	I would check out gconf-editor and goto "apps -> compiz" and make sure nothing about "struts" is unchecked, but I'm not running compiz so hard for me to help you past this :) good luck
2007-12-02T08:20:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	the gnome panel defines a "strut" (I think) which means don't place windows here :)
2007-12-02T08:21:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	I knwo in windows managers like FVWM and other VERY configurable ones you can tell certain windows to ignorestruts etc
2007-12-02T08:21:00.000Z	kelsin	clanmac10	so clearly either gnome-panel is not defining them, or compiz is not listening
2007-12-02T08:23:00.000Z	clanmac10	kelsin	Oh ok I know what your talking about now
