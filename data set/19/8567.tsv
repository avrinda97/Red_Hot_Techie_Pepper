2007-03-12T10:28:00.000Z	Xeper		Hey everyone, I have a question... I'm downloading the Ubuntu AMD64 disc now, and the problem I had with the Gentoo install is that it wouldn't support my SATA devices during install.  Will I also run into this problem with the Ubuntu install?  Bot my HDD and my DVD RAM drive are SATA.

2007-03-12T10:29:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	it should, unless you rmotherboard has a funny chipset
2007-03-12T10:29:00.000Z	Xeper	shatrat	Nah, MSI K9AGM
2007-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	Xeper	shatrat	I'm familiar with Gentoo -- will any of the changes be difficult for me to get used to, do you think?
2007-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	probably not, just !sudo
2007-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	Xeper		I haven't used Linux for over 2 years (been in Iraq) but...
2007-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	Xeper		I still remember
2007-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	there is no root account, minor difference
2007-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	Xeper		No root account?  Why not?
2007-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	Xeper		!sudo replaces that?
2007-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	security.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2007-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	Xeper	shatrat	That's a great idea... never thought of it like that
2007-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	Xeper	shatrat	 Seems a whole lot more user friendly.
2007-03-12T10:34:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	that's the idea behind most ubuntu features.
2007-03-12T10:34:00.000Z	Xeper	shatrat	I apologize for the ignorance, but I am totally new to this.  Ubuntu is based upon Debian, right?  So it uses apt-get?
2007-03-12T10:35:00.000Z	Xeper	shatrat	And, my favorite feature about Gentoo was Emerge, because it got all the dependencies for me.  Will Ubuntu be able to do that too?
2007-03-12T10:35:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	yes, apt manages dependencies very well, and you can find most software you could want in repositories.
2007-03-12T10:36:00.000Z	shatrat	Xeper	youll just have to try it.  There's really not much explaining needed if youve used linux before.  I switched from SuSE and had no problems figuring anything out.
