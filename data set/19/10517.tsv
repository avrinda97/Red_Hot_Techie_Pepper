2006-06-06T11:44:00.000Z	Maerksi	stevejesus	but when reinstalling, won't I loose everything? Should I create at least a /home ?
2006-06-06T11:44:00.000Z	stevejesus	Maerksi	i have a seperate drive for home, that i carry with me always.
2006-06-06T11:45:00.000Z	stevejesus	Maerksi	you can always tar up your home and then extract it after you reinstall to the desired mount pint
2006-06-06T11:47:00.000Z	stevejesus	Maerksi	yes, apps are generally installed in / somewhere and then symlinked to your path.  unless you decide to install something in /home.  or if you are installing usung klik
2006-06-06T11:48:00.000Z	stevejesus	Maerksi	what ever you wants to put there man.  look at it like c:/documents and settings in windows, which is where you my documents, my pictures are etc...
