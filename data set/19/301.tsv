2012-04-29T06:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	I think it says that because it should work for both 32 and 64-bit
2012-04-29T06:26:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	yea thats what im thinking too. thanks
2012-04-29T06:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	exactly, it's so much easier to control than others
2012-04-29T07:50:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	I'm guessing you would have to reenable the alsa drivers for each new kernel install
2012-04-29T07:50:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	in other words, whatever you did to make it work before, you have to do again for all new kernel updates
2012-04-29T07:51:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	well what I did was, installed alsa-hda-dkms to get it working on 12.04, now I just updated kernel, it built a module and all. but I got no sound now the module is loaded
2012-04-29T07:52:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	it built the module, but did it actually load that module?
2012-04-29T07:52:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	yea snd_hda_intel is loaded right now.. just nothing shows up in aplay or alsamixer or anything else
2012-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	did you try modprobe on the alsa module?
2012-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	what module ? I tried rmmod snd_hda_intel and modprobing it back no luck
2012-04-29T07:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	ack, nevermind, I'm being an idiot. Best ignore me (but not /ignore ;))
2012-04-29T07:57:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	no problem.
2012-04-29T07:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	I'm guessing you already tried reinstalling the alsa thing?
2012-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	yea
2012-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	did you try booting the old kernel and see if it still works there?
2012-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	gonna try that in a minute, brb
2012-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	yea the new kernel is Borked
2012-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	gaelfx	InferiorHumanOrg	not the first time that's happened, won't be the last!
2012-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	gaelfx	yea and I got so annoyed I forgot I should just go back a kernel version.
