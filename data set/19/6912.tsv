2008-01-13T13:19:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	 what driver did you install? pls
2008-01-13T13:20:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	the latest proprietary driver from the nvidia website (version 169.07)
2008-01-13T13:22:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	why do you ask -- are you familiar with this problem?
2008-01-13T13:24:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	the first thought that crossed my mind was that you didn't reconfigure your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for the new driver
2008-01-13T13:24:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	i see. yes, i am using the driver "nvidia"
2008-01-13T13:25:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	can you repeat your issue pls - doing many things here - what's not happening ?
2008-01-13T13:26:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	i cannot change my screen resolution. it is stuck at 1024x768 -- i can't change it higher or lower if i use the nvidia driver (though i can change it if i use another driver, say vesa).  the problem persists even if i edit the "Modes" line of my display subsection of section "Screen" in xorg.conf
2008-01-13T13:27:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	currently my modes line has 1280x800, 1024x768, 800x600, and 640x480.  however, i can only actually use 1024x768.
2008-01-13T13:29:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	i have tried that, yes.
2008-01-13T13:30:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	is the resolution you want the first option in each line of /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2008-01-13T13:32:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	it seems to ignore my modes line in xorg.conf.  even if i only put, say, 800x600, it still is stuck at 1024x768.
2008-01-13T13:32:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	do you have the control panel in your menu?
2008-01-13T13:32:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	which menu are you referring to ?
2008-01-13T13:34:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	there's no "control panel" in applications, but there is "system tools" with an "nvidia settings" option
2008-01-13T13:35:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	try that for a start
2008-01-13T13:36:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	i can change the resolution in "nvidia settings", but not to 640x480 or 800x600. only to 640x384, 576x384, and 512x384, none of which i want to change to.
2008-01-13T13:38:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	from here I would suggest uninstalling any drivers you installed - rebooting and starting agai - sorry , it's the only advice UI can give from here
2008-01-13T13:38:00.000Z	minilek	ere4si	ok, thanks for the help. i have been at this for hours, uninstalling/reinstalling/rebooting/etc. thank you though.
2008-01-13T13:41:00.000Z	ere4si	minilek	my nvidia needed the restricted driver - but it worked ok - can only suggest a restart - sorry
