2008-07-26T04:35:00.000Z	Dethlok		I'm trying to install adesklets-0.6.1 and when i ./configure i get the message that "c compiler cannot creat executables"  anybody know what that means?  sorry im kinda new
2008-07-26T04:35:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	have you installed the build-essential package?
2008-07-26T04:36:00.000Z	Dethlok		must not because i dont even know what that is, =P
2008-07-26T04:37:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	ok, do     sudo apt-get install build-essential    then try to ./configure again (also say my name if you're talking to me, otherwise I'll probably miss it. this is a pretty busy channel)
2008-07-26T04:39:00.000Z	Dethlok		___yy:  ok it's installing right now, thank you very much!
2008-07-26T04:40:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	ahh, i need python as well
2008-07-26T04:40:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	you should be able to apt-get that as well
2008-07-26T04:40:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	ok tyvm
2008-07-26T04:41:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	or you can use the synaptic package manager to search for/install it if you're more comfortable in a GUI. apt-get and synaptic get packages from the same place, so It's not like you're missing anything using one or the other
2008-07-26T04:42:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	ok, i already have v2.5 but for somereason the adesklets doesn't see it
2008-07-26T04:43:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	I can't help you with that, sorry. That's an adesklets specific problem, and I've never used adesklets.
2008-07-26T04:44:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	ok, well i would just use gdesklets but it says it cant connect to the server?
2008-07-26T04:45:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	sorry, I've never used gdesklets either. I would guess it probably means it can't connect to your X server (the thing that manages window resources for you) but I don't know how to fix it.
2008-07-26T04:47:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	 ok, thank you for the clues =)
2008-07-26T04:48:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	maybe it's because i'm 64 bit?
2008-07-26T04:49:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	I don't think that should affect it really
2008-07-26T04:49:00.000Z	__yy	Dethlok	that matters more for things like drivers
2008-07-26T04:49:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	oh ok
2008-07-26T04:50:00.000Z	Dethlok	__yy	i got all the hard stuff done =P  wireless, video, etc... i figured this would be easy hehe
