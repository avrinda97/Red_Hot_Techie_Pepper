2005-01-09T12:45:00.000Z	mdz		it sounds like you don't want to run GNOME at all, in which case, don't
2005-01-09T12:45:00.000Z	buu	mdz	I'm not.
2005-01-09T12:45:00.000Z	mdz	buu	you are running at least some GNOME components, apparently
2005-01-09T12:45:00.000Z	buu	mdz	Maybe?
2005-01-09T12:47:00.000Z	buu	mdz	How do I get rid of it then?
2005-01-09T12:48:00.000Z	mdz	buu	what session did you select when logging into gdm?
2005-01-09T12:48:00.000Z	buu	mdz	'fluxbox'
2005-01-09T12:50:00.000Z	mdz	buu	if you run 'ps ux', you'll likely find that you have a bunch of gnome-related processes running
2005-01-09T12:51:00.000Z	mdz	buu	if you don't want GNOME, don't run the control center.  that will start gnome-settings-daemon, set up shortcuts, etc.
2005-01-09T12:52:00.000Z	buu	mdz	I kill all the gnome related processes.
2005-01-09T12:52:00.000Z	buu	mdz	Still getting f1.
2005-01-09T12:53:00.000Z	mdz	buu	you'll want to log out to make sure that everything is stopped
2005-01-09T12:53:00.000Z	buu	mdz	eh, ok
2005-01-09T12:55:00.000Z	buu	mdz	Only gnome process I see is gconfd-2
2005-01-09T12:55:00.000Z	buu	mdz	Still getting the f1 crap
2005-01-09T13:01:00.000Z	mdz	buu	it works fine for me, simply selecting fluxbox as the session
2005-01-09T13:02:00.000Z	buu	mdz	F1 doesn't trigger anything?
2005-01-09T13:02:00.000Z	mdz	buu	correct
2005-01-09T13:02:00.000Z	buu	mdz	How very very odd.
