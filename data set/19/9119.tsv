2008-02-20T07:49:00.000Z	amy_		why doesntgutsy recognize that i need restricted drivers?
2008-02-20T07:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	if it recognizes the hardware that needs the restricted driver, yes
2008-02-20T07:50:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	 feisty did, but gutsy does not
2008-02-20T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	whats the hardeware?
2008-02-20T07:52:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	its an nvidia chipset
2008-02-20T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	and its not in the restricted driver manager?.. System/Admin/Restricted?
2008-02-20T07:52:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	nope
2008-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	hmm. that is strange
2008-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	what chipset?
2008-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	tell me about it
2008-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	i dont know... to me, its of little importance as it was working before i upgraded
2008-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	well, it would help to know to diagnose the problem.. lspci in a terminal
2008-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	intel mobile 945gm
2008-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	thats not nvidia.
2008-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	 my mistake..
2008-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	thats an intel device, nt an nvidia.
2008-02-20T07:56:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	 still, it installed it in feisty and i was able to runberyl all of last year
2008-02-20T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amy_	don't know, i know gutsy has had some issues w/ the Intel chipsets.. i've got an Intel GM965, and it doesn't work w/ compiz.
2008-02-20T07:56:00.000Z	amy_	IndyGunFreak	 kostkon: i guess my question becomes, how does feisty install the driver and it work, but gutsy does not?
