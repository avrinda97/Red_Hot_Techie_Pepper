2009-12-25T10:28:00.000Z	shubbar		how can i use command line to batch process files in an input-file output-file?
2009-12-25T10:28:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	what exactly do you want to do?
2009-12-25T10:30:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	i am using mencoder to conver an mkv file to avi. i want to modify the command to convert all the mkv file in a directory
2009-12-25T10:31:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	wildcards work with input, but i don't know what to use for output
2009-12-25T10:32:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	something like 'for each vid in *.mkv; do mencoder "$vid" options "$vid.avi"; done'
2009-12-25T10:32:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	sorry no each
2009-12-25T10:33:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	vid here is a dummy argument ?
2009-12-25T10:34:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	what do you mean dummy argument?
2009-12-25T10:36:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	i mean it will be replaced with the name of the file in each run
2009-12-25T10:37:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	i will try this on a different command, since mencoder takes a long time in each run
2009-12-25T10:37:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	yes
2009-12-25T10:37:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	replace mencoder with echo
2009-12-25T10:42:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	it just gives me ">" and i press ctrl-c to exit
2009-12-25T10:43:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	what did you try?
2009-12-25T10:45:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	sorry, it worked. i forgot ";done" on the first try
2009-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	the "$name" has the name and extension
2009-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	shubbar	Billiard	thanks
2009-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	yes it does in the example i gave
2009-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	Billiard	shubbar	that can be removed with something like ${name%.*}.avi
