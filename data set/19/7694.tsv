2007-11-22T09:47:00.000Z	nevhood		Hello, I am trying to install an audio driver.  When I do so, I get an error message: checking for libasound headers version >= 1.0.12... not present.  What can I do?
2007-11-22T09:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	 you did install the libasound-dev package?
2007-11-22T09:47:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- i don't think so
2007-11-22T09:47:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- i'll try
2007-11-22T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	 yep do an 'apt-cache search libasound ' and look for a whtever-dev package
2007-11-22T09:49:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- seems like it's already installed, no?
2007-11-22T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	 search is NOT showing a list of whats installed.
2007-11-22T09:50:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- then, what do i do?
2007-11-22T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	 install the package.. :) if its allready installed it wont hurt anything.
2007-11-22T09:51:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- Sorry, I'm brand-new with Linux, how do I install the package?
2007-11-22T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	 now would be a good time to read some ubuntu beginners guides.  "sudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME" is one way. or use the synaptic package manager tool.
2007-11-22T09:52:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- will do
2007-11-22T09:52:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	libasound2 is already the newest version.
2007-11-22T09:53:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	i believe I already installed it before.
2007-11-22T09:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	  libasound2-dev may be the package name for the developer files.. use synaptic and LOOK and see whats installed.
2007-11-22T09:55:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	libasound2 is installed.  i just looked at synaptic.  the installed version is 1.0.14.
2007-11-22T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	   libasound2    and    libasound2-dev are 2 DIFFERNT packages. :) you understand this?
2007-11-22T09:57:00.000Z	nevhood	Dr_willis	- I understand now, sorry!
2007-11-22T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nevhood	 you want to install   libasound2-dev   in addation to libasound2 :)
