2009-09-22T14:30:00.000Z	indus		maybe someone else can advice on this
2009-09-22T14:30:00.000Z	indus		sounds interesting though
2009-09-22T14:30:00.000Z	indus		whats portage
2009-09-22T14:30:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	portage is a ports managment system
2009-09-22T14:31:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	simialar to apt just that you dont install binary packages, you download sourcecode and compile it
2009-09-22T14:32:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	ok thanks but whats the use of that?
2009-09-22T14:32:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	the use of have portage and apt installed on the system? there is no use...
2009-09-22T14:39:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	and if you cant play sound what do you have :)
2009-09-22T14:39:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	a problem :D
2009-09-22T14:43:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	ya best idea
2009-09-22T15:09:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	ntfs-3g doesnt work with user flag
2009-09-22T15:09:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	doesnt
2009-09-22T15:09:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	ya too many crappy guides out there
2009-09-22T15:10:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	you have to compile it at your own with internal fuse support
2009-09-22T15:10:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	and than setuid root on the binaries
2009-09-22T15:10:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	there is no need for that
2009-09-22T16:07:00.000Z	indus	captnchaos	dont think sudo is needed for make
2009-09-22T16:07:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	yes it is
2009-09-22T16:08:00.000Z	captnchaos	indus	if you configure as su you have to make as su
