2007-02-11T12:04:00.000Z	Tominator		hi! I've got a problem... I had a wineversion from the winehq repo installed and "overinstalled" a version which I compiled by my self (due to a patch) but now I want apt to install the newer version from the repo again, but it doesn't work#
2007-02-11T12:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	becuase you've broke the dependencies
2007-02-11T12:05:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	how can I fix them?
2007-02-11T12:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	remove all the old wine references
2007-02-11T12:05:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	but how?
2007-02-11T12:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	rm
2007-02-11T12:06:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	not really? do I have to delete each single file?
2007-02-11T12:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	yes
2007-02-11T12:07:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	I think it'll be faster to compile the newer version myself won't it?
2007-02-11T12:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	thats your call, just remember your in this position because YOU broke the dependency tree, so you're welcome to carry on that way
2007-02-11T12:08:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	how could I have not done it?
2007-02-11T12:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	use the versions from the repo
2007-02-11T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	package up the newer version against ubuntu deps
2007-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	you don't
2007-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	well probably yes
2007-09-05T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	no %100
2007-09-05T12:46:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	well... perhabs but there is a kernel error... I think I do have a problem...
2007-09-05T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Tominator	you can't use the server release
2007-09-05T12:46:00.000Z	Tominator	ikonia	okay... well that's not that good...
