2006-12-02T13:54:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	...ehm?
2006-12-02T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	theres a big difference in tabs and pagers/desktops for me
2006-12-02T13:58:00.000Z	bruenig	nothlit	it uninstall ubuntu-desktop, doesn't "break" it whatever that means
2006-12-02T13:59:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	but ubuntu-desktop is an important tool for upgrades people shouldn't really uninstall it unless they know what they're doing/remember to re-add it
2006-12-03T12:48:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	you can use the "software sources" app
2006-12-03T12:48:00.000Z	bruenig	nothlit	you can edit the sources.list
2006-12-03T12:49:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	you said pretend you don't know how to edit the sources.list file, so i was talking about the noob way
2006-12-03T12:52:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	why would he need to install a firewall in order to open ports? i'm guessing he hasn't done anything with iptables
2006-12-03T12:52:00.000Z	bruenig	nothlit	I didn't tell him to do so, I simply remarked that that is what I did to do so.
2006-12-03T12:53:00.000Z	bruenig	nothlit	iptables was maddening. Perhaps that is my incompetence but I generally am able to grasp things and that I was not.
2006-12-03T12:59:00.000Z	bruenig	nothlit	yeah if you want to leech. If you are firewalled you cannot connect to other people who are firewalled. So if everyone was firewalled, bittorrent wouldn't work.
2006-12-03T12:59:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	i know, im just explaining why he might not have got an 'error' message from the mainline client
2006-12-03T12:59:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	i am not telling him to violate the spirit of bittorrent
2006-12-03T13:00:00.000Z	bruenig	nothlit	oh ok, I mean we steal things, but we don't go as far as maintaining harmful firewalls, come on
2006-12-03T13:01:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	T.T please very carefully reread what i wrote from the very beginning before you accuse me of that again.
2006-12-03T13:01:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	very very carefully
2006-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	nothlit	bruenig	i don't think it'll work for the uris vlc and mplayer are expecting
