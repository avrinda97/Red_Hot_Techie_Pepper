2009-07-31T17:10:00.000Z	shooree		I'm trying to install new NV drivers, but I get an error that my X server is still running, even after I do the "gdm stop" thing from TTY. where am I going wrong?
2009-07-31T17:12:00.000Z	shooree		could someone tell me why executing "gdm stop" from TTY won't kill my Xserver? I can't seem to install new gfx drivers because of it. 9.04, btw
2009-07-31T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	sudo service gdm stop
2009-07-31T17:13:00.000Z	shooree	jrib	I did a sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-07-31T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	what was the output?
2009-07-31T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	log out of your X session
2009-07-31T17:14:00.000Z	shooree	jrib	I'll try that
2009-07-31T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	apt-cache policy PACKAGE
2009-07-31T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	ok, what doesn't this one do?
2009-07-31T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	dpkg -l | grep whatever ?
2009-07-31T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	why aren't you using jockey?
2009-07-31T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2009-07-31T17:26:00.000Z	shooree	jrib	oh. well, I wanted the new ones
2009-07-31T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	yes, but why?
2009-07-31T17:27:00.000Z	shooree	jrib	because I was coerced into installing them?
2009-07-31T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	ok...
2009-07-31T17:28:00.000Z	shooree	jrib	my friends are on desktops and I have an acer lappie. apparently, things get done differently and I made a fool out of myself for the second time by letting them fiddle with my settings
2009-07-31T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	well Hardware Drivers should work fine regardless
2009-07-31T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	shooree	installing drivers manually used to interfere with it.  Not sure if that's still the case
