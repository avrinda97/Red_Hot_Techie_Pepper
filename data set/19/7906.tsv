2007-06-05T05:12:00.000Z	dekos		hi there, i've just installed feisty fawn and there's no voice
2007-06-05T05:13:00.000Z	dekos		have no idea what's the problem
2007-06-05T05:13:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	any other sounds?
2007-06-05T05:14:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	what do you mean by "other sounds"? i can open every songs or movies with my player but i don't hear anything
2007-06-05T05:15:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	that's what i meant. you don't get any sound at all, right?
2007-06-05T05:15:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	yes
2007-06-05T05:15:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	did you check the volume on your speakers, and the volume control in ubuntu?
2007-06-05T05:16:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	go to System > Prefs > Sound, and play around in there. see if you can get any sound from that
2007-06-05T05:16:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	yes i did
2007-06-05T05:17:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	it doesn't work
2007-06-05T05:18:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	is sound playback set to esd?
2007-06-05T05:19:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	it is set to automatic
2007-06-05T05:20:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	try esd
2007-06-05T05:20:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	i've changed it everywhere to esd but there's no difference
2007-06-05T05:20:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	also, make sure your speakers are plugged in the proper place (like, not the mic spot)
2007-06-05T05:21:00.000Z	dekos	tanath	when i was running the ubuntu cd everything worked fine
2007-06-05T05:22:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	when you installed, how did you do it?
2007-06-05T05:22:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	there's a shortcut when running the live version to 'install to disk'. if the live disc worked, you might try that
2007-06-05T05:23:00.000Z	tanath	dekos	(if you can't get it wokring)
