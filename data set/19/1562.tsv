2011-02-02T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	duron23	better, ok is the receiver usb based?
2011-02-02T23:27:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ no, it connect directly to tv tuner card
2011-02-02T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	duron23	and if you run: xev  in a terminal and press buttons on the remote, do you get a reaction?
2011-02-02T23:30:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ no reaction from remote for xev
2011-02-02T23:32:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ I followed this tut http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1659552
2011-02-02T23:32:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ with no luck
2011-02-02T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	duron23	ok run lspci;lsusb   one line will identify the chip and may help finding guides.
2011-02-02T23:33:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ its Philips Semiconductors SAA7131/SAA7133/SAA7135 Video Broadcast Decoder (rev d1)
2011-02-02T23:35:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ to be specific it pinnacle pctv pci pro
2011-02-02T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	duron23	i suck at tv cards but if you use that in conjunction with the model it may help. If there are any details on the receiver that could help too
2011-02-02T23:40:00.000Z	duron23	ActionParsnip	@ any way to list com ports, the way we list lspci to pci devices
2011-02-02T23:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	duron23	possibly lshw-gtk
