2011-02-01T20:09:00.000Z	billmania		Where should I start looking for a problem with gdm after upgrading to 10.10 64 bit desktop?
2011-02-01T20:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	I don't look for problems,, problems just find me
2011-02-01T20:10:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	:-D
2011-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	I'm sure you must have tried but I would expect it would act as a usb disk and plug and play when you pluged it in
2011-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	Yes, tried that. lsusb lists the phone but it's not mounted as a filesystem and also not recognized as a modem.
2011-02-04T18:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	well in this case you don't need a modem,  sudo lshw not show the device have a driver?
2011-02-04T18:51:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	Correct, no driver is loaded for the phone. It does work on a MS-Windows notebook, so I'm fairly confident the phone itself is functional.
2011-02-04T18:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	what about view of dmesg
2011-02-04T18:56:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	dmesg records that the device was physically connected, but does NOT mention a specific driver being loaded or a device file being created.
2011-02-04T18:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	well this phone worked back in 8.04, but I see people working it with tried adding the line usb-storage option_zero_cd=2   to /etc/modules  as seen here: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1145846.html  but didn't work for all people
2011-02-04T18:59:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	Yup, that's the line I tried in my /etc/modules, but no joy.
2011-02-04T19:00:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	I'm hesitant to upgrade this particular notebook to 10.10 just yet, because that upgrade broke GDM on my desktop.
2011-02-04T19:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	no it worked before 8.04 or 8.10,  later it stoped working at 9.10....
2011-02-04T19:02:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	Understood. There are also some comments on some of the bugs stating that the phone works again with some 10.10 systems.
2011-02-04T19:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	newer is not always better is what I am tring to say
2011-02-04T19:02:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	I hear you loud and clear.
2011-02-04T19:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	ok I missed that link
2011-02-04T19:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	billmania	don't blame you, I never upgrade till it's broken or there is some new software that no longer runs on mine without backports or is within 6 months of no longer being suported
2011-02-04T19:05:00.000Z	billmania	sacarlson	:-D
