2007-06-17T14:32:00.000Z	MilesPrower		Don't wanna sound like a noob, but I am... can anyone help me out...I'm tryin' to install Ubuntu OS 7.04 to an originally-Windows XP OS system, and it's screwing up a bit
2007-06-17T14:33:00.000Z	MilesPrower		It's simply not loading
2007-06-17T14:34:00.000Z	MilesPrower		I put the disc in, I restart, and it's not overwriting anything
2007-06-17T14:34:00.000Z	Alvenhar	MilesPrower	are you using a Live-CD?
2007-06-17T14:34:00.000Z	MilesPrower		I don't know..my friend gave me this and said to just restart with the CD in.
2007-06-17T14:35:00.000Z	Alvenhar	MilesPrower	OK, so you start with the CD in. Is anything linux-like loading at all? Otherwise you will need to set you boot sequence in the BIOS so that the CD is read before the harddrive.
2007-06-17T14:36:00.000Z	MilesPrower	Alvenhar	no, nothing linux-like is loading, so how do I go about going in BIOS?
2007-06-17T14:37:00.000Z	Alvenhar		MilesPrower... Well, when you restart you're computer, make sure you have the screen turnde on. And during the first seconds, it should tell you a key (usually F10 or F2) that you need to press quickly to get into BIOS. There you'll need to find the boot seqeunce manager and make sure your CD drive is checked first.. Then you restart with the cd in, and it should come up loading whtaever is on it.
2007-06-17T14:38:00.000Z	MilesPrower	Alvenhar	Thanx alot!
2007-06-17T14:39:00.000Z	Alvenhar		Miles Prower, Good luck!
2007-06-17T14:42:00.000Z	Alvenhar		Question (Ubuntu 7.04): When I try to run "gksudo gnome-app-install" it responds that I can't authentificate. But I'm pretty sure in sudoers list. And when I try to reactivate this app through edit menu, it unticks after being ticked. Can anyone help please?

2007-06-17T15:05:00.000Z	MilesPrower	Alvenhar	if you're still here, what exactly do I have to do when I get into the BIOS screen?
2007-06-17T15:07:00.000Z	Alvenhar	MilesPrower	that depends on your BIOS. But you have to find where you can change the Boot Sequence. And there you'll have to cycle through the options so that the correct CD (ie the one with the cd in it) is first, and your harddrive second...
2007-06-17T15:08:00.000Z	MilesPrower	Alvenhar	So, I'm supposed to have the CD in it when I go into BIOS?
2007-06-17T15:08:00.000Z	MilesPrower		Furthermore, my BIOS activates by F1 if that helps you get what kind I'm using.
2007-06-17T15:10:00.000Z	Alvenhar	MilesPrower	that doesn't matter. You'll have to have it in when you reboot, after you changed the options, saved and exited. It appears though that you have never "played around" with your PC, right? Maybe you better pass on this one, and get this friend of your's over to show you what to do. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't "just work", as windows.
2007-06-17T15:11:00.000Z	MilesPrower	Alvenhar	I have played around, but not much. Furthermore, the friend I spoke of lives a good 10 miles away, and netiher of us have a car, so I'm stuck doing the instillation by myself, hense my being here.
