2009-07-28T01:08:00.000Z	mechtech	^^f	ok...just boot up to the cd and re-format and re-install...no need to "un-install" first

2009-07-28T01:16:00.000Z	^^f		that doesnt help me
2009-07-28T01:17:00.000Z	mechtech	^^f	ok...two ways, the first I would consider to be more complete, and therefore more reliable...boot to cd, and blow out all your linux partitions (esp your extended) then reformat then re-install ubuntu...the second is to boot to live cd, then whenit  asks to install...go through the process untill you reach the part where you can selec which partition to trsh...trash it, then rebuild it, and make it a whatever partition
