2007-06-15T11:50:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	please use lower case
2007-06-15T11:54:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	its best just to ask if someone knows they will answer
2007-06-15T11:54:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	you can also join #beryl or #ubuntu-effects
2007-06-15T11:55:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	thats a bit odd after starting beryl-manager and beryl add "&" to it that should allow you to close terminal
2007-06-15T11:56:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	so type like " beryl-manager && beryl &"
2007-06-15T11:56:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	the && tells it to run another command after and the single & is like drop back to term after execute
2007-06-15T11:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	hey hey no shouting i know your happy
2007-06-15T12:00:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	use spaces
2007-06-15T12:00:00.000Z	noiesmo	blackace11	ok no spaces lol
