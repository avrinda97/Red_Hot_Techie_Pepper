2009-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| what driver is that you just put in ?
2009-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	I didn't put in any new driver. I would assume one of the automatic updates through Apt broke it.
2009-09-18T10:16:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	But since ath5k_pci is my wireless driver, my only idea is to try reverting that driver to the version from the Live CD

2009-09-18T10:21:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	Any idea how I'd check to see what card I'm using? (Not even sure if it's an Atheros)
2009-09-18T10:21:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| sudo lspci -vnn | grep Ethernet
2009-09-18T10:22:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| sudo lspci -vnn | grep Wireless
2009-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	Unfortunately, since I don't have a connection, I can't use any of the apt-get install commands there ><
2009-09-18T10:26:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| can you check your /etc/apt/sources.list if there is a CDROM in there
2009-09-18T10:31:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	Yup, the CDROM is in there
2009-09-18T10:33:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	I'm the one trying to restore the old driver. I think khaled is confused >< I'm trying to download the madwifi "snapshot driver", but not having much luck with the connection going out every couple seconds
2009-09-18T10:35:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| dpkg -l | grep -i ath
2009-09-18T10:35:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| dpkg -l | grep -i wifi
2009-09-18T10:36:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	Yup, "ii madwifi-tools         1:0.9.4+r3685.20080531+dfsg-1ubuntu1    tols for the Multiband Atheros Driver for WiFi"
2009-09-18T10:37:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| sudo apt-get autoremove madwifi-tools
2009-09-18T10:38:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	Any sort of reboot required after the autoremove?
2009-09-18T10:38:00.000Z	willca	Pytlask	| yes to reload everything as a sanity check
2009-09-18T10:39:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	Righty-o, restarting now :) Thanks for all the attempts to help me!
2009-09-18T10:44:00.000Z	Pytlask	willca	That fixed it!!! Thanks so much <3!
