2006-12-24T14:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	use sudo rm <file>, though, if you have to ask, you hsouldnt be messing with it
2006-12-24T14:07:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	I just wanted to remove rar
2006-12-24T14:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	thats done with 'sudo apt-get remove --purge rar'
2006-12-24T14:09:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	i'm trying to reinstall rar so i can extract a file do you know how i would use it?
2006-12-24T14:09:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	'sudo apt-get install --reinstall rar' to reinstall, and 'rar x <file>
2006-12-24T14:10:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	Package rar is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-12-24T14:11:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	enable universe
2006-12-24T14:11:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	wait... should be in multiverse i think...
2006-12-24T14:13:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	how do i add the multiverse it does not say on the site
2006-12-24T14:14:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	then you should upgrade, as soon as possible
2006-12-24T14:15:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	i'm just waiting on the new cds to be shipped to m
2006-12-24T14:15:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	you can do an internet upgrade if you have the bandwith...
2006-12-24T14:16:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	I attempted that and it did not work right.. so i figured I should just wait for the cds
2006-12-24T14:16:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	remember that you can only jump one step at a time.
2006-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	rick_	nolimitsoya	i forgot about breezy? i think when i was upgrading i think thats why
2006-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	you must upgrade to from hoary to breezy, from breezy to dapper and from dapper to edgy
2006-12-24T14:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	at least get to dapper, since its a lts realease
2006-12-24T14:24:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rick_	k3b
