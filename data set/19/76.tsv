2012-10-20T18:14:00.000Z	ThothCastel		I am trying to create a folder to develop a website under /var/www/
2012-10-20T18:14:00.000Z	ThothCastel		but it is not allowing
2012-10-20T18:14:00.000Z	ThothCastel		why is that>?
2012-10-20T18:14:00.000Z	ThothCastel		'permission denied'
2012-10-20T18:15:00.000Z	ThothCastel		I tried the following to give the permission: sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/
2012-10-20T18:15:00.000Z	ThothCastel		I am trying to assign the right permissions
2012-10-20T18:16:00.000Z	ThothCastel		theoretically I undersntand it...  just haven't put it into practice yet
2012-10-20T18:17:00.000Z	ThothCastel		however it just seems that it does not work
2012-10-20T18:17:00.000Z	ThothCastel		I still can't create the directory
2012-10-20T18:18:00.000Z	ThothCastel		thanks bekks :)
2012-10-20T18:18:00.000Z	blz	ThothCastel	bekks for what it's worth, I've experienced the same thing in the past, namely with external harddrives
2012-10-20T18:19:00.000Z	ThothCastel	blz	ok... lol..   I just want to paste a directory that contains the files of my website inside the /var/www directory...
2012-10-20T18:20:00.000Z	blz	ThothCastel	and your permissions aren't taking?
2012-10-20T18:20:00.000Z	blz	ThothCastel	that's the issue, right?
2012-10-20T18:20:00.000Z	blz		Or did I assume too much =)
2012-10-20T18:20:00.000Z	ThothCastel	blz	yes
2012-10-20T18:21:00.000Z	blz	ThothCastel	yeah I don't actually have a solution.   But I've encountered that before and it's very frustrating.  I just wanted to let you know you're not crazy
2012-10-20T18:21:00.000Z	ThothCastel		I simply want to give x user full permissions to that folder
2012-10-20T18:21:00.000Z	ThothCastel	blz	 thanks yo! ;)
