2008-02-20T20:40:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	you have some doubtful repos in there?
2008-02-20T20:40:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	don't know. Want to make sure before I do the update.
2008-02-20T20:41:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	update manager says, NOT AUTHENTICATED for few updates
2008-02-20T20:41:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	that's the reason I am concerned
2008-02-20T20:41:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	anything outside or third party in there? using automatix or other non ubuntu sources?
2008-02-20T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	would you mind pastebinning your sources list?
2008-02-20T20:42:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	pastebinning? how do I do that?
2008-02-20T20:46:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	InsClusoe http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56752/
2008-02-20T20:50:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	well you have feisty backports in there but they are commented out--should be okay to run just curious why they are there--might want to completely remove them just to be totally safe
2008-02-20T20:50:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	I upgraded from Fiesty to Gutsy. May be that's the reason they are there
2008-02-20T20:51:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	it seems that you should be okay then looking at your sources list
2008-02-20T20:52:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	thanks
2008-02-20T20:53:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	but why does it say the updates are not authenticated when they are from ubuntu's sources?
2008-02-20T20:54:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	trying to remember here ;] I tend to live on the wild side and ignore those warnings so never really worried about if before--I sure those more wise than myself can clarify that
2008-02-20T20:56:00.000Z	sknh	bazhang	even I never used to worry but now I cannot afford to get into trouble, need to have access to my system all the time and cannot afford to spend time troubleshooting unnecessary problems
2008-02-20T20:58:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	check details for what the non authenticated packages are and let us know here briefly
2008-02-20T21:02:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	yes, only ati uses more of the space here ;]
2008-02-20T21:03:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	envy is generally reviled in this channel
2008-04-01T18:22:00.000Z	bazhang	sknh	should be in ubuntu-restricted-extras
