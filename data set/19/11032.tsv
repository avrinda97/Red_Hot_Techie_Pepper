2006-04-26T09:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	no, sound architectures ( alsa is a collection of drivers etc)
2006-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	orbin	thoreauputic	so what distros does it work with?
2006-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	don't know - kanotix maybe - but it is experimental
2007-04-12T07:18:00.000Z	orbin	thoreauputic	you told mikeconcepts that there has been no kernel update since 2.6.20-14.  is that the latest available kernel for edgy systems?
2007-04-12T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	 that's what I have here
2007-04-12T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	fully updated feisty ^^
2007-04-12T07:19:00.000Z	orbin	thoreauputic	... take your time in disclosing. ;)

2007-04-12T07:20:00.000Z	orbin	thoreauputic	nvm, i thought you were running edgy
2007-04-12T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	no, I have a dapper / feisty dual boot :)
2007-04-12T07:21:00.000Z	orbin	thoreauputic	had started typing something edgy relevant, and then you said you were on feisty 5 seconds later. :)
2007-04-12T07:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	used to be dapper/ edgy until about herd 4
2007-04-12T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	orbin	ah i see - sorry I missed the edgy part :)
