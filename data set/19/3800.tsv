2012-11-05T11:36:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	DeathStar	you can compile the version you want
2012-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	DeathStar	SolarisBoy	I looked into that, and VLC has a wild amount of dependancies that have to be re-compiled as well
2012-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	DeathStar	you can do a cheat that sometimes works for me
2012-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	DeathStar		do share plz
2012-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	DeathStar	apt-get build-dep first then do the compile
2012-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	DeathStar		it used to
2012-11-05T11:40:00.000Z	DeathStar		anyone else here find that getting drunk helps your command line skills go up?
2012-11-05T11:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	DeathStar	it degrades mine =)
2012-11-05T11:41:00.000Z	DeathStar	SolarisBoy	I just kind of accept the commands instead of questioning why have a -E instead of a -e when all the other commands for that package are lower case and thats the only uppercase
2012-11-05T11:41:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	DeathStar	haha - the man page generally helps for that
2012-11-05T11:41:00.000Z	DeathStar	SolarisBoy	as long as you can find your anykey your good
2012-11-05T11:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		most times cause they have some many dang args they already used the -e
2012-11-05T11:42:00.000Z	DeathStar		yeah
2012-11-05T11:42:00.000Z	DeathStar		I need to get my bash scripting up a little, i'm pretty good with perl but not so much with bash
2012-11-05T11:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		it sounds like its a python module andreb
2012-11-05T11:43:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		and it sounds like it would come in the default python base but im not sure - thats probably why ActionParsnip said reinstall python2.6 =)
2012-11-05T11:43:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	DeathStar	good with perl but not with bash? you will probably do good by just trying then
