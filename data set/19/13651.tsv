2005-02-18T07:01:00.000Z	evarlast	sleon_	have you replaced mdk with ubuntu elsewhere?
2005-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	i don't have mandrake elsewhere to replace it :D
2005-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	evarlast	sleon_	ah.  I was curious, because I was not impressed with my mdk-> ubuntu switch.
2005-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	the best thing is: ubuntu has much more packages then mdk
2005-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	and they are easier to install
2005-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	evarlast	sleon_	really?  mdk contrib has many many packages!  :)
2005-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	what is different by ubuntu  then on mdk?
2005-02-18T07:04:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	what is lacking?
2005-02-18T07:05:00.000Z	evarlast	sleon_	it lacks a cd audio burning application.  I know gnome lacks a k3b equiv, but I was still surprised by this.  Also, my audio was detected poorly and incorrectly.  I was also surprised by the use of mozilla-proper rather than firefox, and there was a long list of packages which I had to install that mdk usually did for me.
2005-02-18T07:05:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	like mp3 shitz?
2005-02-18T07:05:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	which burning app are you using?
2005-02-18T07:06:00.000Z	evarlast	sleon_	?  not mp3 shitz.  Just burning audio.  I ended up using cdrecord from command line.
2005-02-18T07:06:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	is there no k3b for ubuntu?
2005-02-18T07:07:00.000Z	evarlast	sleon_	I don't think so.  See the audio burning howto on the wiki.
2005-02-18T07:08:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	really so much?
2005-02-18T07:08:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	i will tell you how much more :D
2005-02-18T07:09:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	it is very easy
2005-02-18T07:09:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	you compile kernel module
2005-02-18T07:11:00.000Z	sleon_	evarlast	only a little more then nero
