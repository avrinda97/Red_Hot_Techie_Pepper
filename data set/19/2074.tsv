2012-07-17T21:51:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	it depends on the type of harddrive connection, if you are talking about the location of the physical drive normal its /dev/sda* or /dev/hd* for sata or ide respectivly
2012-07-17T21:52:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	or maybe you are talking about where you mount a partition
2012-07-17T21:52:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	then its what i said first
2012-07-17T21:53:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	has this answered your question?
2012-07-17T21:54:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	use gparted to look at the partition of the disk, "sudo gparted"
2012-07-17T21:54:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	it will also give you the locical names and physical names of the harddrive partions and the drives them selves
2012-07-17T21:55:00.000Z	etio	ResQue	thanks. Ill try that out. I have been using the GUI version of gparted before
2012-07-17T21:55:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	it is a much better idea to get to grips with the terminal interface and the parted tool, like te said
2012-07-17T21:55:00.000Z	etio	ResQue	yes, for sure.
2012-07-17T21:55:00.000Z	etio	ResQue	i agree
2012-07-17T22:02:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	dont store all your movies on the same partition as the os is installed, when it breaks its easy to fix :-D
2012-07-17T22:02:00.000Z	etio	ResQue	no, ill be storing it on the disk we're discussing right now
2012-07-17T22:03:00.000Z	ResQue	etio	Just thought i would give you a heads up :-D
2012-07-17T22:03:00.000Z	etio	ResQue	thanks :)
