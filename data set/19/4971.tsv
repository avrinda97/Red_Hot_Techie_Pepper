2008-10-26T01:43:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	you make sure that you have a driver that knows the device and vendor ids of your device
2008-10-26T01:45:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	I have it working, but I need to pull it out before booting, then push it back in later.  How would I know if it knew the vendor ID?
2008-10-26T01:46:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	forget what I said. How about you just put the module (driver) into /etc/modules?
2008-10-26T01:47:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	driver would get loaded. If device attached it should start working, if not attached nothing happens
2008-10-26T01:48:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	I don't seem to have a /etc/modules directory...
2008-10-26T01:53:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	it's a file. I have it in hardy. Are you using another ubuntu version?
2008-10-26T01:54:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	you can put modules in it that you want to loaded on boot
2008-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	ooh, I didn't realize it was a file.  So what line should I add to tell it to load my card?
2008-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	what's the driver you use for your card?
2008-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	lsmod could help to find the name
2008-10-26T01:58:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	I use ndiswrapper if that helps, how would I check from lsmod?
2008-10-26T02:00:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	that's it. Add a new line that says: ndiswrapper
2008-10-26T02:00:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	I already have a line that says that.  :S
2008-10-26T02:01:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	strange. What happens when you boot with the card connected, can you see the WLAN interface with iwconfig?
2008-10-26T02:02:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	When I boot with it in, the card is unresponsive in terms of the lights, how would I check with WLAN interface and iwconfig?
2008-10-26T02:03:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	just run iwconfig without arguments.
2008-10-26T02:03:00.000Z	DeadBattery	bttb	after its done booting?
2008-10-26T02:03:00.000Z	bttb	DeadBattery	that's righ
