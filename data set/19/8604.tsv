2007-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	SirDucer		I've had a look at those pages and I am totally clueless :( I've only had ubuntu installed for about 3 hours now
2007-03-06T11:03:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	did it fail when you tryed to change device like it says in the bot factoid?
2007-03-06T11:07:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	sorry to ask another stupid question, but is Master and PCM both un muted and not set to 0 in the gnome volume control window that pops up when you double click the volume applet in the bar?
2007-03-06T11:09:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	is your sound card listed under "Change Device" in the file menu of the volume control?
2007-03-06T11:10:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	ok open the terminal and run two commands "sudo lsmod" and "sudo lspci" and then pastebin the results?
2007-03-06T11:12:00.000Z	SirDucer	kelsin	stupid question alert! how do I use pastebin? lol
2007-03-06T11:12:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	you should have gotten a private message from ubotu with information
2007-03-06T11:18:00.000Z	SirDucer	kelsin	lsmod results = http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8951/    and lspci results = http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8952/
2007-03-06T11:22:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	in a terminal have you run "sudo alsaconf", if not you can definitely try it, it might clear some config issues that the ubuntu installer created by accident
2007-03-06T11:26:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	"sudo aptitude install alsa-utils" first then try "sudo alsaconf"
2007-03-06T11:27:00.000Z	SirDucer	kelsin	still says "sudo aslaconf: command not found"
2007-03-06T11:28:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	did it look like the alsa-utils package installed fine?
2007-03-06T11:29:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	you can try "sudo /usr/sbin/alsaconf" if so
2007-03-06T11:29:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	it might already be installed
2007-03-06T11:30:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	"sudo dpkg -l | grep alsa-utils" that will return one line if it is installed, try "sudo /usr/sbin/alsaconf" as well
2007-03-06T11:32:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	I have to run and catch a bus, really sorry, keep those urls for pastebin in case someone else wants to look at them. It does sound like your drivers are installed fine, I frankly confused that it's not working. obviously double check all volumes and headphone jacks and your speakers etc, good luck
2007-03-06T11:33:00.000Z	SirDucer	kelsin	the sudo dpkg came up with "ii  alsa-utils                                 1.0.11-6ubuntu2                      ALSA utilities"
2007-03-06T11:33:00.000Z	kelsin	SirDucer	yeah try "sudo /usr/sbin/alsaconf" then, I'll be on later tonight again"
2007-03-06T11:34:00.000Z	SirDucer	kelsin	but the sudo /usr/sbin/alsaconf can up with command not found
