2007-02-01T17:42:00.000Z	SpareXX	linux_kid	i can connect to my shares with my xbox running XBMC but i can't get into with win xp
2007-02-01T17:43:00.000Z	linux_kid	SpareXX	what is the workgroup on your XP machine?
2007-02-01T17:44:00.000Z	SpareXX	linux_kid	it is the same as my linux box
2007-02-01T17:44:00.000Z	linux_kid	SpareXX	OK, does the machine (on XP) show up in "workgroup computers?
2007-02-01T17:45:00.000Z	SpareXX	linux_kid	i don't know right at this time, as my sister just went to sleep, she has the computer in her room
2007-02-01T17:46:00.000Z	linux_kid	SpareXX	hmm...
2007-02-01T17:47:00.000Z	linux_kid	SpareXX	Samba has trouble with workgroup names other than MSHOME so mabye you could make all the machines MSHOME?
2007-02-01T17:49:00.000Z	SpareXX	linux_kid	do you know a way to fix so i can hear sound in more than one program at the time? I've tried to install the alsa codec, but it didnt help(do i have to reboot after install it?)
2007-02-01T17:50:00.000Z	linux_kid	SpareXX	try the reboot.  I never had that problem, so the reboot should do it.

2007-02-01T06:03:00.000Z	SpareXX	linux_kid	do you think it has something with soundcard? Maybe it's not supported good in ubuntu or something
