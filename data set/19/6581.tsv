2008-01-13T18:15:00.000Z	mewm		On my laptop the "Fn + Arrow down" is supposed to turn down volume, but it doesen't. I can see that the turns down the "Front" values in Alsamixer. But the one that controles the volume is "PCM" how do i change that?
2008-01-13T18:17:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	try right clicking the speaker icon and clicking "preferences" and changing the setting there
2008-01-13T18:17:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	perfect! Thanks :P
2008-01-13T18:19:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	it doesen't work. The FN key and arrow down still only the "Front" ?
2008-01-13T18:20:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	hmm, what does it say in system->prefs->keyboard shortcuts
2008-01-13T18:21:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	Volume up: 0xb0, Volume down: 0xae
2008-01-13T18:21:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	do those correspond to fn + up/down?
2008-01-13T18:21:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	i have no idea
2008-01-13T18:22:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	well, try to reset it? because those volume up+down should correspond to the slider control you get when left clicking on the speaker thing, which should now control the correct mixer on your card.
2008-01-13T18:23:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	so does that volume control work when you use the mouse on it?
2008-01-13T18:23:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	i mean when you left click the speak...
2008-01-13T18:24:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	it works if i manually slide on it
2008-01-13T18:25:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	i just tried it and i get the same as you... the keys always control the first mixer for some reason
2008-01-13T18:25:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	but i suppose that the "Volume down" and up on keyboard shortcut commands corresponds to the "Front"
2008-01-13T18:27:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	this might be a job for gconf-editor...
2008-01-13T18:28:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	ill check it out
2008-01-13T18:30:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-605482.html (but i can't figure out what he means about ctrl - but it sounds like he had the same problem as you)
2008-01-13T18:31:00.000Z	ali1234	mewm	ah i found it! system->prefs->sound has a different set of preferences!
2008-01-13T18:34:00.000Z	mewm	ali1234	yey :D Works well now
