2010-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	Doyle	darwin_	http://www.yuuguu.com/help
2010-04-12T14:05:00.000Z	darwin_	Doyle	you need to provide e-mail etc. My VPS dosn't got that.
2010-04-12T14:06:00.000Z	Doyle	darwin_	are you ok with terminal only connection? or does it have to be desktop?
2010-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	darwin_	Doyle	desktop. Since i have to go on internet etc.
2010-04-12T14:12:00.000Z	Doyle	darwin_	If there's no one at the other end, you'll have to use something like vnc. or freenx as mentioned earlier. I haven't played with freenx, but vnc is well documented. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC
2010-04-12T14:13:00.000Z	darwin_	Doyle	i can't get the VNC server.
2010-04-12T14:14:00.000Z	Doyle	darwin_	here's an example for server 2003. http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-remote-desktop-for-controlling-windows-xp-desktop.html
2010-04-12T14:15:00.000Z	darwin_	Doyle	i'll check that out too, thanks.
