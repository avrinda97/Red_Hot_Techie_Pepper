2010-02-07T06:43:00.000Z	lifesengine		how do i change the permissions of the folder
2010-02-07T06:43:00.000Z	lifesengine		i want full acess
2010-02-07T06:44:00.000Z	lifesengine		i can use the file manager to copy them in?
2010-02-07T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 you could use 'sudo mc' and use the mc filemanager to copy things there.
2010-02-07T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 its 'best' to install user stuff in the proper place in the users home dir. Not system wide.
2010-02-07T06:45:00.000Z	lifesengine	Dr_Willis	sudo mc is an invalid command
2010-02-07T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 for example i put my brushes in -> ~/.gimp-2.6/brushes
2010-02-07T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 install mc.. or as i just said - put the brushes in the proper directiory in the USERS home
2010-02-07T06:46:00.000Z	lifesengine	Dr_Willis	i'm brand new to ubuntu, i have no clue how to use any of this stuff
2010-02-07T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 then like ive been saying.. DONT put stuff in the system directorys.. your USER has a .gimp* directory. copy the brushes to the proper place in there.
2010-02-07T06:47:00.000Z	lifesengine	Dr_Willis	yes, but i have no permission to copy it there
2010-02-07T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 your user should have permission to do things in their own home directory -  Unless you are doing somthing wrong
2010-02-07T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 /home/USERNAME/.gimp-2.6   is my users gimp dir.
2010-02-07T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 I suggest you never do gnsudo nautilus it can really scres things up.
2010-02-07T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 you are confuseing the SYSTEM gimp directory with the USERS gimp directory
2010-02-07T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 theres really no need for you to be putting things in the SYSTEM gimp directory
2010-02-07T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 /home/USERNAME/.gimp-2.6   is my users gimp dir.  (for the 3rd time)
2010-02-07T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 note the . befor the name? its a hidden dir.
2010-02-07T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lifesengine	 use the show hidden files item in the file manager window.
