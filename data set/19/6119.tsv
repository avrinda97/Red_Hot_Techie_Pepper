2008-03-10T06:32:00.000Z	Lurp		but i think it may have to do with my attempt at installing KDE4
2008-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	Lurp		yeah
2008-03-10T06:36:00.000Z	Lurp		darkcrab:such as?
2008-03-10T06:37:00.000Z	Lurp		hmm:well i tried using gparted, made a separate partition, loaded the ISO onto that via ubuntu.com instructions, and i still get errors.
2008-03-10T06:39:00.000Z	Lurp		but i don't understand how both my drives can get effed up from ubuntu/KDE4
2008-03-10T06:39:00.000Z	Lurp		that's true
2008-03-10T06:40:00.000Z	darkcrab	Lurp	do you have a copy of Windows?
2008-03-10T06:32:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	would, but i can't. my burner isn't operational in ubuntu for some reason. I had accidentally upgraded to Hardy (don't ask how, somehow the repository got added to my sources.list)
2008-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	DAMN kde4. well like i said, i've tried booting from a separate partition, and i get errors from that and from the CD. Any ideas on how to do a reinstall?
2008-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	darkcrab	Lurp	can you access the internet?
2008-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	Haha yeah, i'm on my messed up system right now
2008-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	yeah, should i try burning the alternate CD and see if that works?
2008-03-10T06:38:00.000Z	darkcrab	Lurp	try this, start up your CD, and then click install, but instead of installing, click "check CD for errors"
2008-03-10T06:38:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	already tried that, reported no errors
2008-03-10T06:40:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	yeah, that kinda bites. The problem isn't my HDD's though, it's my optical drives. I can't boot from ANY disks. I tried a mandriva disk, didn't work.
2008-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	Unfortunately no, not a legal one.
2008-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	I thought the same thing, reset my bios to the defaults, still had the same problems.
2008-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	It's a possibility, i get grub errors semi-frequently
2008-03-10T07:06:00.000Z	Lurp	darkcrab	final consensus, windows semi loads, then does nothing
