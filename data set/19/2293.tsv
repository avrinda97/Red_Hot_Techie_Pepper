2011-06-15T16:58:00.000Z	dr_willis		isent there an app called 'photorec' or somthing like that?
2011-06-15T16:59:00.000Z	dr_willis		 mastertheknife  try the ubuntu-classic desktop yet? whats your video card?
2011-06-15T16:59:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	this is virtualbox VM
2011-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	it happens with all desktops.. i tried ubuntu classic too.. the gnome interface turns into gray
2011-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 you are using the latest virtualbox? Unity has issues with the older versions i hear
2011-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	using sudo gnome-settings-daemon    brings the gnome interface colours back
2011-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 you could install some other window manager untill you get unity/gnome fixed.. if thats the issue
2011-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 what version of vbox are you using?
2011-06-15T17:00:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	is this unity thing also running if i use classic ubuntu?? cause im having the same issue there too
2011-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	virtualbox 3.1.12
2011-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 i use Lubuntu these days. so not sure.
2011-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 that may be the issue then.. try a newer vbox version perhaps
2011-06-15T17:01:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	my bad, 3.2.12
2011-06-15T17:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 check the forums and askubuntu.com i dont use vbox, or unity.  from what i hear in here it should work with vbox4+
2011-06-15T17:27:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	wow its still happening.. unbelieveable
2011-06-15T17:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 you could try installing unity-2d
2011-06-15T17:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 disable compiz, or try unity2d
2011-06-15T17:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	mastertheknife	 as a test. try making a totally new user. see if it affects them also.
2011-06-15T17:41:00.000Z	mastertheknife	dr_willis	it cant be something done by me because i just reinstalled 11.04 5-10 minutes ago, hehe
