2010-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	musturd		and like it
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	musturd		I use chrome in Gnome
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	musturd		sudo apt-get install google-chrome
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	musturd		done
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	musturd		yes I'm pretty sure it is
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	musturd		It is webkit I mean
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	Chrome uh
2010-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	see above
2010-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	and webkit woudn't even exist, if it wasn't for Konqueror with its KHTML that Apple deicded to fork making webkit
2010-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	if you want
2010-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	however Konqueror is :)
2010-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	Konqueror is my favourite browser after  Firefox
2010-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	musturd	sebsebseb	You would suggest Konqueror even with Gnome?
2010-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	yes
2010-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	just like I would suggest Konversation for IRC, even if going to run it in Gnome
2010-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	musturd	and I would suggest K3B as a good alternative to brasero, and KDM as a good alternative to GDM for the log in screen
2010-06-09T07:46:00.000Z	musturd	sebsebseb	I like lynx :)
