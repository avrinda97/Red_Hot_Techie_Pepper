2006-04-24T08:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	sure
2006-04-24T08:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	check the output of dmesg when you insert it, see what it is recognized as. What kind of card is it?
2006-04-24T08:51:00.000Z	deathscytheh64	fyrestrtr	i woudn't've thought to do that, i'm really new to linux so i've been trying to follow along on the forums as best as i could
2006-04-24T08:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	no problem, what kind of card is it?
2006-04-24T08:52:00.000Z	deathscytheh64	fyrestrtr	belkin f5d7011 pcmcia card that uses the broadcom chipset from what i read
2006-04-24T08:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	oh its a wireless card, hrmm ... have you tried on the livecd? did it work then?
2006-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	deathscytheh64	fyrestrtr	I bought the card after installing ubuntu on the system
2006-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	hrmm, okay.
2006-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	deathscytheh64	fyrestrtr	heh i thought it would work right out of the box
2006-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	if you give me about ... 4 hours, I will have a better answer for you (that's how long it will take to rebuild my laptop) :P
2006-04-24T08:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	well first thing we have to make sure is that its being detected.
2006-04-24T08:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	okay do this
2006-04-24T08:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	deathscytheh64	take the card out, plug it in. Then, open a terminal window and type tail /var/log/messages -- and then go to pastebin.com and paste the results there.
