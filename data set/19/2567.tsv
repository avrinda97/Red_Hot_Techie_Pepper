2010-07-10T04:25:00.000Z	freezway		i play tremulous a lot and i usually get 90fps, recently however i've been getting less that 40
2010-07-10T04:25:00.000Z	freezway		how do i fix that
2010-07-10T04:26:00.000Z	freezway		no tremulous
2010-07-10T04:26:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	lower res, lower colour depth, less graphical niceness
2010-07-10T04:27:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	but i had it all up to max before and it worked fine
2010-07-10T04:27:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	then evaluate your driver / xorg settings etc
2010-07-10T04:28:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	gee thats not vague at all
2010-07-10T04:29:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	well you havent given any details so its the best I can do, if you want to give us details we can be more precise
2010-07-10T04:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	ok and when did the slow down change, like after a kernel upgrade etc??
2010-07-10T04:37:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	could try the nvidia vdpau ppa, may help
2010-07-10T04:38:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	 1 sec trojan_spike what?
2010-07-10T04:39:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	you havent said when theslowdown started...
2010-07-10T04:39:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	if i knew when i would tell you, its less than a week ago
2010-07-10T04:40:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	are there any upgrade logs?
2010-07-10T04:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	i believe there is a dpkg log in /var/log
2010-07-10T04:41:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	ok i'll pastebin it
2010-07-10T04:41:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	well its no use to us, you need to think when the slow down started adn read the log
2010-07-10T04:43:00.000Z	freezway	actionParsnip	hmmm i could grep for packages that would might have changed
2010-07-10T04:44:00.000Z	actionParsnip	freezway	i guess
