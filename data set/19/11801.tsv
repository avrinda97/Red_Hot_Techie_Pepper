2005-11-21T10:08:00.000Z	misfit_toy		which exact directories should I tar to be able to bring this laptop back to this exact moment in time? every distro has it's idiosyncrasies and I would like to make this a standard laptop image.
2005-11-21T10:09:00.000Z	misfit_toy		I have read all day about this but nothing specific to breezy that I could find...I want a good "snapshot" of this laptop so that I can not only bring it back to exactly this point in time, but can deploy other laptops using the same "snapshot"
2005-11-21T10:11:00.000Z	misfit_toy		!backup
2005-11-21T10:11:00.000Z	misfit_toy		even the bot doesn't know how to backup? sweet.

2005-11-21T10:12:00.000Z	misfit_toy		as in /var /etc /usr ...
2005-11-21T10:13:00.000Z	misfit_toy		which dir's do I need to have to make this a good snapshot backup
2005-11-21T10:14:00.000Z	BenC	misfit_toy	all of them
2005-11-21T10:14:00.000Z	misfit_toy	BenC	that shouldn't be neccessary
2005-11-21T10:14:00.000Z	BenC	misfit_toy	you need everything that was installed, unless you plan to just do a fresh install and restore just config files
2005-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	misfit_toy	BenC	that's what I mean, after a fresh install, what specific dir's would need to be restored?
2005-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	misfit_toy	BenC	I would agree with /etc and /var but what about /usr ?
2005-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	BenC	misfit_toy	policy dictates that configurable files are in ~/ and /etc
2005-11-21T10:17:00.000Z	misfit_toy	BenC	yes of course /home
2005-11-21T10:18:00.000Z	misfit_toy	BenC	I don't care about  having to *install* Ubuntu, but I need to have an easy way to restore every single program and setting from this laptop, from a disaster recovery point of view.
2005-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	BenC	misfit_toy	I always do /etc, and keep a copy of "dpkg --get-selections > packagelist.txt"
2005-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	misfit_toy	BenC	but that won't bring back specific "settings" for each app
2005-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	BenC	misfit_toy	"settings" for each app should be in ~/, or /etc
