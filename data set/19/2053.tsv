2010-07-21T09:18:00.000Z	Taev		Anyone? no one has any suggestions? Anytime I play a video with whatever player, if another application plays a sound I lose the audio to my video
2010-07-21T09:18:00.000Z	Taev		and must restart the damn video
2010-07-21T09:18:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	did you uninstall pulseaudio by mistake?
2010-07-21T09:20:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	I'm of no help, try making a new user account and see if it happens to it too. If it doesn't, theres someting misconfigured in your account and you could just wipe out those settings files
2010-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	run you video player from a terminal and see what it spits out. mPlayer would be best, it gives lots of output
2010-07-21T09:36:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-audio-dev/+archive/ppa    and then install the alsa modules for your kernel
2010-07-21T09:37:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	It's a newer version of alsa
2010-07-21T09:41:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	open synaptic, search for alsa-driver-modules    install the latest (not the backports) and then restart your computer
2010-07-21T09:41:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	actually install the 2.6.32-23 one
2010-07-21T09:42:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	Yes, the one ending in -24 is newer than your kernel so don't install it
2010-07-21T09:43:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	yes, I forgot about pae
2010-07-21T09:45:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	hooray! I guess you have some serious driver issues. You should probably file a bug report. uninstalling those modules will revert
2010-07-21T09:46:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	or learn to write drivers, yep
2010-07-21T09:46:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	umm wait
2010-07-21T09:47:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	did it work like this on the LiveCD or is this a new development?
2010-07-21T09:47:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	if it used to work, you can probably fix it. if it's a driver bug, file a very detailed report and maybe someone will fix it
2010-07-21T10:04:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	audigy sucks
2010-07-21T10:04:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems
2010-07-21T10:04:00.000Z	peepingtom	Taev	creative are evil with their drivers
