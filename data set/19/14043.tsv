2004-11-13T16:05:00.000Z	mercurus		:) Warty is up :)
2004-11-13T06:27:00.000Z	mercurus		just out of interest, I understand why legally dubious packages are not included with Ubuntu ... but is including a commented-out entry in the apt sources file beyond the legally practicable ?
2004-11-13T06:28:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	The commented out bit is only the universe repository and not what you're thinking of.
2004-11-13T06:29:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	I know ... but is it too legally dubious to include a link to the legally dubious package source ?
2004-11-13T06:30:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	*shrug* The decision to get the packages, add the respository is all down to the individual so I would say not really
2004-11-14T06:19:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	What's wrong with using universe?
2004-11-14T06:20:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	I'm trying to keep this installation to the most common packages as a bit of a test
2004-11-17T17:37:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	Might need to get the w32codecs pack first
2004-11-17T17:38:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	I have the w32 codecs ... and totem is throwing up :x actually, i think it is .asx ..?
2004-11-18T09:41:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	Just copy the samba config from a working machine then, but backup the current one:)
2004-11-18T09:41:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	I can get it working ... but I want to get it working, the Ubuntu way :)
2004-11-18T09:41:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	Ah, I've always hacked the config
2004-11-18T09:43:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	ah ... this is so I can provide instructions to a frist-time linux user :p
2005-04-08T08:14:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	Heard of winex?
2005-04-08T08:14:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	ah ... pass.
2005-04-08T08:14:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	Heard of wine?:)
2005-04-08T08:15:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	chateaux cardboard !
2005-04-08T08:15:00.000Z	Pizbit	mercurus	Basically it's an extremely modified wine which concentrates on running games, specifically directx games
2005-04-08T08:16:00.000Z	mercurus	Pizbit	yeah ... not my cup of tea ... that said ... if I had the money to own hardware that supported 3d games, and paid top dollar for new games, $15 isn't much to get them running on Linux
