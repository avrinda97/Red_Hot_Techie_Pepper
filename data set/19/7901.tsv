2010-06-27T16:02:00.000Z	paddy_		i try echo -e "\a" to make the system speaker beep but I think it might be turned off, how do i turn it on?
2010-06-27T16:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 its amazing how i see that asked ion here about eery week. :)  #1 thing to try - sudo  modprobe pcspkr
2010-06-27T16:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 or try the 'beep' command  to have finer controll of beepings.
2010-06-27T16:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 at one time there was a X bug that some how disabled the ctrl-g and \a beeping. Not sure if thats been fixed or not
2010-06-27T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 i think that 'x bug' is still happening.
2010-06-27T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 i modprobe pcspkr, then beep works. rmmod pcspkr and beep dont work.. the echo \a never works in either case
2010-06-27T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 i saw someone mention this bug a long time ago. last year some time
2010-06-27T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 YES. it does work from the console.
2010-06-27T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 load the module. and   \a works.
2010-06-27T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 so it seems that X bug is still in effect.
2010-06-27T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 the pcspkr modile
2010-06-27T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 with the modprobe command i mentioned earlier
2010-06-27T16:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 in the console the \a worked after i had loded the pcspkr module. Nothing makes it work in X.
2010-12-26T04:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	paddy_	 really old? or odd?  post a screen shot perhaps.
2010-12-26T04:17:00.000Z	paddy_	Dr_Willis	comming up
