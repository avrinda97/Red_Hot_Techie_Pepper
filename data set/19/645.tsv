2011-11-01T00:58:00.000Z	DavidCA		hey guys
2011-11-01T00:59:00.000Z	DavidCA		I'm having issues with my 10.04 just showing black/white gibberish after POST. The computer is still connectable via SSH, but doesn't load the graphical desktop at all.
2011-11-01T01:00:00.000Z	DavidCA		me? i disabled the splash screen in some related issue i read
2011-11-01T01:00:00.000Z	DavidCA		but it still does it
2011-11-01T01:00:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	Nothing wrong with using SSH ... Who needs X anyway :)
2011-11-01T01:00:00.000Z	DavidCA	_r00t_	i do! i use it for Boxee on my TV
2011-11-01T01:01:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	Why not use openELEC and xbmc ?
2011-11-01T01:03:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	Back OT I've just fixed a computer with a similar problem... Uninstalled additional nvidia driver and built the driver from Nvidias website - job done
2011-11-01T01:03:00.000Z	DavidCA	_r00t_	i've heard people saying the exact opposite! uninstall nvidia website drivers and install additional
2011-11-01T01:05:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	The additional driver failed for me big time. What happended was that I mixed the client API with wrong kernel module. The additional nvidia driver is also very old
2011-11-01T01:05:00.000Z	DavidCA	_r00t_	how hard is it to get the nvidia website driver built/working? i'll admit i'm a linux noob here
2011-11-01T01:06:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	not that tricky ... shutdown X and gdm ... ./NVid*installer*run and it runs you through it
2011-11-01T01:16:00.000Z	DavidCA	_r00t_	Here's a short video, before I do the nvidia.com stuff:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RheY8kYywo4&hd=1
2011-11-01T01:17:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	Ta... I'll take a look
2011-11-01T01:22:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	wth is wrong with the character set ?!
2011-11-01T01:23:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	Can you boot into single user mode ?

2011-11-01T01:25:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	yep that should work
2011-11-01T01:42:00.000Z	_r00t_	DavidCA	o_O lemme check
