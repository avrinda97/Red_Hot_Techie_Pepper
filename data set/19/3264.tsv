2012-08-05T06:12:00.000Z	ubuntu-studio		ok so I installed that restricted extras thing, but it wont let me use flash still on firefox?
2012-08-05T06:13:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Have you restarted Firefox?
2012-08-05T06:13:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Is flashplugin-installer actually installed? Not sure if it's a part of restricted-extras
2012-08-05T06:14:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	If you are using Firefox, I recommend downloading the "FlashAid" addon. It helps with Flash problems on Firefox on Ubuntu :/
2012-08-05T06:14:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Such problems were always there, so.
2012-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Where are you searching for FlashAid? It's on addons.mozilla.org
2012-08-05T06:18:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Ah, seems it's a dead project now. Never mind.
2012-08-05T06:19:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Well, for starters pastebin the output of this: find / -iname '*libflashplayer.so*' -print 2>/dev/null
2012-08-05T06:22:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Do what? Open a terminal, type what I said in -- it's one line, by the way.
2012-08-05T06:23:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	You're doing something wrong, "find" does not produce such output.
2012-08-05T06:23:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Just paste the command in, and you're supposed to enter it exactly like it appears
2012-08-05T06:25:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Seems Flash failed to install. You'll have to reinstall it: sudo apt-get --reinstall install flashplugin-installer
2012-08-05T06:27:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Well, now try again.
2012-08-05T06:29:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Well, that's already going somewhere. Just tell it to use the current version (Ubuntu isn't too up-to-date, especially if you're using an old version of it)
2012-08-05T06:31:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Uh, isn't there a "Load anyway" button?
2012-08-05T06:32:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Ugh. Okay, head over to the Adobe website, grab the .deb package from there (for Ubuntu) and use that.
2012-08-05T06:33:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	They call it "apt"
2012-08-05T06:34:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/ - select your architecture (32 or 64-bit) and then "Flash player for Ubuntu (apt)"
2012-08-05T06:39:00.000Z	theadmin	ubuntu-studio	Great
