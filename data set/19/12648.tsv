2007-08-16T07:59:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	opengl + sdl?
2007-08-16T08:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	It's got alot of legacy code, which is DirectX, but it's 2D, so shouldn't really be all that difficult to port, really.
2007-08-16T08:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	But it works really well on wine, except for the networking code, for some reason.
2007-08-16T08:01:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	It's a uni project, gotta get the marks first. :)
2007-08-16T08:01:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	of course, everything should be done with python and pygame :D
2007-08-16T08:02:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	This is with Lua. :)
2007-08-16T08:02:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	And cpus understood python natively. that would be my perfect world.
2007-08-16T08:02:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	Some guy's already partially made an OpenGL port, actually, so it's possible to do, anyway.
2007-08-16T08:03:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	never underestimate the power of some guy on the internet! :D
2007-08-16T08:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	I don't think I could've easily done this with python...  Python's a PITA to embed, and I'm using multiple VM's simultaniously.
2007-08-16T08:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	And it's alot slower than lua.
2007-08-16T08:04:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	and alot sexier ;)
2007-08-16T08:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	Well, there's a number of things I don't like about lua, incidentially.  The lua binding was also legacy code. :)
2007-08-16T08:05:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	actually python can be pretty fast is you use psyco
2007-08-16T08:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	Only on x86, but even then, I doubt it can beat hand-optimized C++ and Lua.
2007-08-16T08:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	Terrasque	I must head off to bed, g'night.
2007-08-16T08:07:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	thats why we need hardware that can run python natively at blinding speed!
2007-08-16T08:07:00.000Z	Terrasque	Arafangion	good night
