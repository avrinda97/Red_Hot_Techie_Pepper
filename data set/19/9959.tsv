2006-08-21T07:13:00.000Z	FirstStrike		i don't run FF 24/7 either; i only run it when i need it
2006-08-21T07:13:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	It absolutely refuses to work and doesn't give me squat in the way of error messages, the keyboard is always locked up and the mouse cursor onlt appears about 30% of the time
2006-08-21T07:15:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	nvidia-glx-1.0.8762+2.6.15.11-3
2006-08-21T07:16:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	linux-image-2.6.15-26-k7
2006-08-21T07:17:00.000Z	FirstStrike	YeTr2_	try installing the previous driver version (the .7x series)
2006-08-21T07:19:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	no change
2006-08-21T07:34:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	just installed the binary from nvidia's site, now I'm getting a 'Failed to load module "glx"
2006-08-21T07:34:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	also the nvidia module is not showing up either
2006-08-21T07:42:00.000Z	YeTr2_	FirstStrike	still nothing
2006-08-21T07:43:00.000Z	FirstStrike	YeTr2_	there's really no 'standard fix' for this. it could be something in the bios related to your graphics card. it could be something else. i don't know what else to tell you.
