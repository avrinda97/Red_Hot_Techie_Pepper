2008-08-16T02:02:00.000Z	Chrizz_		hmm
2008-08-16T02:03:00.000Z	Chrizz_		i STILL cant get a ip assigned to my server
2008-08-16T02:03:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	what's in /etc/network/interfaces?
2008-08-16T02:06:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/37816/
2008-08-16T02:06:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	spell 'address' right
2008-08-16T02:07:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	Its a typo from server to laptop pastebin
2008-08-16T02:07:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	then what isn't working right? /sbin/ifconfig -a should show you what's configured? try pinging your gateway before moving onto bigger and better things
2008-08-16T02:09:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	It shows what i configured. pinging works
2008-08-16T02:10:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	did the network work fine when under dhcp?
2008-08-16T02:10:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	It worked perfectly
2008-08-16T02:11:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	what does 'ping 192.168.1.25' and 'ping 192.168.1.1' do?
2008-08-16T02:12:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	.25 works. .1 says: destination host unreachable
2008-08-16T02:14:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	does 'arp -n' have a record for 192.168.1.1?
2008-08-16T02:14:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	it shows 192.168
2008-08-16T02:14:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	it shows 192.168.1.1, but it says (incomplete)
2008-08-16T02:15:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	did you try rebooting and is the cable still plugged in?
2008-08-16T02:16:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	a couple of times. doesnt work
2008-08-16T02:18:00.000Z	DJ-Pyro_	Chrizz_	you're doing everything right in your configuration, not sure why it's not working
2008-08-16T02:19:00.000Z	Chrizz_	DJ-Pyro_	Then the problem should be somewhere else. Im going to look for it. Thank you for your time
