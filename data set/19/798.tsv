2011-08-21T11:38:00.000Z	linuxfp		I need some help if anyone can
2011-08-21T11:39:00.000Z	linuxfp		So I just moved back to linux, and when I finished installing Ubuntu, it went to a blank screen, and then I pressed Alt+F1 and it let me use TTY... So... uh, yeah
2011-08-21T11:39:00.000Z	linuxfp		He left, didn't he
2011-08-21T11:39:00.000Z	linuxfp		Should I do a apt-get upgrade or no
2011-08-21T11:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	you get a grub menu, if you tap any key at powering on?
2011-08-21T11:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	in context black screen when?
2011-08-21T11:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	hit e at grub menu for edit insert nomodeset in kernel in place of splash hit crtl-x to boot ib low graphics, do update upgrade look in additional drives for graphic card driver.
2011-08-21T11:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	tap any key at powering on grub should show and  hit e at grub menu for edit insert nomodeset in kernel in place of splash hit crtl-x to boot ib low graphics, do update upgrade look in additional drives for graphic card driver.
2011-08-21T11:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	you can try the recovery at grub, you will get to a gui that scrolls with the arrow keys, 4 or 5th line is a lowgraphics choice do trhat.
2011-08-21T11:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	yes to get in update upgrade, it may get fixed in that process=driver found, you can also look in the menu after all that for additional divers.
2011-08-21T12:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	but will it do it again, that was a per session boot in?
2011-08-21T12:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	can you read man?
2011-08-21T12:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	update with the update manager. Per-session means not a edit or action that stays
2011-08-21T12:07:00.000Z	linuxfp	urlin2u	The only updates that it's giving me is python and ubuntu one
2011-08-21T12:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	cool sounds like you clicked the update in the install box, update it. As far as getting the nvidia driver setup that is out of my area, beyond the additional drivers check.
2011-08-21T12:11:00.000Z	linuxfp	urlin2u	What is python and ubuntu one supposed to do with this... I updated it in tty a few minutes ago and it still didn't boot properly
2011-08-21T12:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	rotate your right hand on your stomach counter clockwise, with the left hand tap the top of your head click your heels and recite there's no place like gnome.
2011-08-21T12:30:00.000Z	linuxfp	urlin2u	What
2011-08-21T12:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	linuxfp	;-) yeah
