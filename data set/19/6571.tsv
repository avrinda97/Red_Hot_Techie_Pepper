2008-01-22T00:40:00.000Z	erawfish	TheLynx	that one should SMP out of the box. check /proc/cpuinfo
2008-01-22T00:41:00.000Z	TheLynx	erawfish	cpu cores       : 1   ....however, this was working before
2008-01-22T00:42:00.000Z	TheLynx	erawfish	been searching for solution for almost 4 hours
2008-01-22T00:42:00.000Z	erawfish	TheLynx	what kernel parameters?
