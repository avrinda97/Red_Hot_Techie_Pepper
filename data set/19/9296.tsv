2006-12-16T07:50:00.000Z	kuto	jrib	where does ubuntu store hostname localhost and the 127.0.0.1
2006-12-16T07:51:00.000Z	jrib	kuto	the relevant files are /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts.  If you decide to edit these by hand for some reason, make sure they agree
2006-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	kuto	jrib	ok well in fedora your localhost is set to 127.0.0.1 already but you can specify your hostname by editing /etc/hostname or /etc/host now how do i edit my hostname?
2006-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	jrib	kuto	system > administration > networking , hit the "General" tab
2006-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	kuto	jrib	what is the gnome equivalent of that? i need to administer that without administration in new user i am in new user sorry
2006-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	kuto	that is the gnome equivalent.  Do you not have the "administration" menu?
2006-12-16T07:55:00.000Z	kuto	jrib	my user dont have admin priveledges
2006-12-16T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	kuto	oh, well you need them to change the hostname.  Can you switch to the user that does have admin privs?
