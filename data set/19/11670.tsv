2006-03-17T06:36:00.000Z	Gambit-		If I put a packages line in my sources.list file as "main restricted universe multiverse" will it pull in all pacakges?
2006-03-17T06:37:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	yes.
2006-03-17T06:37:00.000Z	Gambit-	nhaines	so I don't need to have multiple lines?
2006-03-17T06:37:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	Nope.  :)
2006-03-17T06:37:00.000Z	Gambit-	nhaines	heh ok, let me try to put all that together.
2006-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	it means that there were dependancy problems and you should use apt-get dist-upgrade.
2006-03-17T06:53:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	upgrade has a built-in safety check.
2006-03-17T06:53:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	something changed that is more major, so you can either use dist-upgrade, or just upgrade and go into Synaptic and check on the held-back packages.
2006-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	Whatsisname is not correct about it upgrading to Dapper.
2006-03-17T06:55:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	once Dapper comes out, you can use dist-upgrade to update your Breezy system.  But you must first manually change your repositories, or it'll stay as Breezy.
2006-03-17T06:56:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	so it is quite safe (as far as not surprising you with a development release!).
2006-03-17T06:56:00.000Z	Gambit-	nhaines	This machine's getting configured and then sent out into the wild, patching opportunities will be pretty slim afterwards.
2006-03-17T06:56:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	my main point is that dist-upgrade won't suddenly throw you ahead into dapper.
2006-03-17T06:57:00.000Z	Gambit-	nhaines	Right, that's an important detail, and more in line with what I'd expect :)
2006-03-17T06:57:00.000Z	Gambit-	nhaines	it's all based on whats in the sources.list file anyways, isn't it?
2006-03-17T06:57:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	yes, precisely.
2006-03-17T06:57:00.000Z	Gambit-	nhaines	cheers for the info :)
2006-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	I hope it helped.  :)
2006-03-17T06:59:00.000Z	nhaines	Gambit-	for that, there's always browsing in Synaptic after the fact.  :)
