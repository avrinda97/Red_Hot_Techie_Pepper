2010-10-18T05:51:00.000Z	xorwhy		I just installed Ubuntu 10.10, and I cannot start it. The same problem occurs when I use the LiveCD, except the problem can be solved with the LiveCD by setting the boot option acpi-off.
2010-10-18T05:51:00.000Z	xorwhy		When I am booting the system, the screen goes blank and does not turn back on. It gets to the logon screen fine as I can hear the login sound.
2010-10-18T05:51:00.000Z	xorwhy		But I can't see anything.
2010-10-18T05:52:00.000Z	xorwhy		Also there is no GRUB boot menu when I start the system.
2010-10-18T05:52:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	sounds like a vido card issue
2010-10-18T05:52:00.000Z	xorwhy	MODE_BEAST	Perhaps, but 10.04 works fine.
2010-10-18T05:53:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	 did you check the md5 checksums on your release ?
2010-10-18T05:53:00.000Z	xorwhy	MODE_BEAST	No, but I've had this problem with three different discs.
2010-10-18T05:54:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	 I never do but it sounded good hehe
2010-10-18T05:54:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	3 disks same image ?
2010-10-18T05:55:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	Thats why it is usually called Beta , I would go back 10.4 TLS
2010-10-18T05:55:00.000Z	xorwhy	MODE_BEAST	That's why I waited for the final release.
2010-10-18T05:56:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	hmm, did you check all physical connections on  your video card
2010-10-18T05:56:00.000Z	xorwhy	MODE_BEAST	There's nothing wrong with the Video card, other operating systems are working fine, and it's a laptop with Nvidia graphics.
2010-10-18T05:57:00.000Z	xorwhy	MODE_BEAST	Besides that, I'm pretty sure the system uses a software rendering system before I install proprietary drivers.
2010-10-18T05:57:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	Does it work before you install the update drivers I have had that same issue
2010-10-18T05:59:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	like i said I have had the same issue until I did not install proprietary drivers
2010-10-18T06:00:00.000Z	xorwhy	MODE_BEAST	 How did you install proprietary drivers without a display?
2010-10-18T06:02:00.000Z	MODE_BEAST	xorwhy	I may have worded that wrong the ones that are on 10.4 iso when it would update driver to the Nvidia ones I got that issue
