2012-08-07T20:12:00.000Z	arabi		i am new to linux and i need help in configuring java compiler
2012-08-07T20:12:00.000Z	arabi		nyone out there to help me plz
2012-08-07T20:13:00.000Z	arabi		I have installed java jdk tar.gz but how to configure it to run from terminal ???
2012-08-07T20:14:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Is there a reason you didn't install it from the repositories, or did you not know you could?
2012-08-07T20:15:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Don't worry it's way simpler
2012-08-07T20:15:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	run the command "sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk" to install the latest Java compiler
2012-08-07T20:16:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Stop doing what you are doing, and install it from the package manager
2012-08-07T20:18:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	What happens when you try to run the "javac" command, and how does it differ from what you are expecting should happen?
2012-08-07T20:19:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Listen to me and do as I advise you to do
2012-08-07T20:20:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Open a terminal and type the following (without the quotes): "sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk"
2012-08-07T20:22:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	running the command "sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk" will download and install the software
2012-08-07T20:22:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	What you just accidentally tried to do was install two different packages, "openjdk-7" and "jdk", neither of which exist, which is why you got an error
2012-08-07T20:24:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	No it is openjdk which is an implementation of the same standard
2012-08-07T20:25:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Yes that's right
2012-08-07T20:26:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Always check the package manager (Software Centre on Ubuntu) first, there's usually no need to go to a developer's website unless you need a version which isn't available in the Ubuntu repositories
2012-08-07T20:26:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	sudo apt-get install build-essential is always a good start
2012-08-07T20:28:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	It includes a C++ compiler, but not Java. You already installed that with the openjdk-7-jdk package
2012-08-07T20:28:00.000Z	Blazemore	arabi	Yes, g++ is the Gnu C++ compiler
