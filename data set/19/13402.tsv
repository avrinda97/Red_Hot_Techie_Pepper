2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	MadHadron		ch3rnobyl, Can OS X mount Linux partitions?
2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	MadHadron		Yes,
2005-04-06T09:36:00.000Z	MadHadron		So you're using the gimp-print
2005-04-06T09:37:00.000Z	MadHadron		When you go to select the driver, don't choose the recommended one.  Choose cups+gimp-print
2005-04-06T09:37:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl	MadHadron	yea it should be able to
2005-04-06T09:38:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl		it shows up, but it won't mount
2005-04-06T09:38:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl		i am trying to erase it
2005-04-06T09:38:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl		i was thinking of just erasing it using the Ubuntu CD
2005-04-06T09:38:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl		can i do that?
2005-04-06T09:38:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Hmm.  Do you have the gimp-print drivers installed?
2005-04-06T09:39:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl		can the Ubuntu boot CD reformat drives?
2005-04-06T09:39:00.000Z	MadHadron	alle	Oh.  Hmm...
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	MadHadron		black, Linux performs a lot of scheduled maintenance tasks
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl		ok........... so noone knows
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	MadHadron		black, And turning it off when you're not using it can result in a wildly unstable machine.
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	MadHadron		ch3r, I never had them coexisting when I had a mac
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	MadHadron		ch3r, But if you're just after erasing the partition...
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	MadHadron		ch3r, Then the disk utilities in the OS X install can do that.
2005-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	ch3rn0byl	MadHadron	did you have MacOS X?
