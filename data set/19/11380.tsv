2006-11-21T14:59:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	right click the m3u file in nautilus. Properties-OpenWith
2006-11-21T15:44:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	write a small bash script and put it in ~/bin
2006-11-21T15:44:00.000Z	cesar_	thor	ty
2006-11-21T15:45:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	for scripts a user writes you should use ~/bin
2006-11-21T15:45:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	both are in the PATH
2006-11-21T15:45:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	'echo $PATH'
2006-11-21T15:46:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	a path is a path is a path, no?
2006-11-21T15:47:00.000Z	cesar_	thor	does gnome use its own initialization bash scripts? in my .bashrc i have an export LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and i can run what i want in terminal, but not in gnome
2006-11-21T15:48:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	ah....ok. I know gnome doesn't use .xinitrc, but didn't know about path
2006-11-21T15:50:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	checking....
2006-11-21T15:52:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	found plenty of references to .gnomerc in google. I think that might be the answer to your problem. But I didn't find an example script
2006-11-21T15:54:00.000Z	thor	cesar_	I don't think .gnomerc is a script...just put the commands you want in a text file...no #!/bin/sh at the start
