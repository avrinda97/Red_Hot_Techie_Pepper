2011-09-17T23:34:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr		i need help partitioning and installing a dual boot,the website on partitioning by ub untu did not make sense nor work for me,can someone please help me
2011-09-17T23:36:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	What two OS'es?
2011-09-17T23:40:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	windows 7 and tango studio(10.,4ubuntu)or avlinux or 64studio
2011-09-17T23:41:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	If you already have windows installed, just boot your flavor of ubuntu live, then select to install and auto-partition unless you want a specific partition setup in which case you would select manual partition option
2011-09-17T23:43:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	yea i goot that far but there are 3 small partitions that are really small so i dont know what tpo do
2011-09-17T23:43:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	You probably should just leave them as they are and just install ubuntu
2011-09-17T23:44:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	In some cases, you may need to resize your windows partition from within windows
2011-09-17T23:46:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	yea i did that and made 500gb of free space
2011-09-17T23:47:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	Then you should be good to go
2011-09-17T23:52:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	in the live  install itg says that space is "unusable"
2011-09-17T23:53:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	I guess windows didn't properly free it then..
2011-09-17T23:53:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	do i need to make a blank partition in windows and mark it fat32 or somin then install?
2011-09-17T23:53:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	No, you don't want to create a partition, you only want to shrink the windows partition
2011-09-17T23:54:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	Is it labeled as free space or a partition? (the 500GB)
2011-09-17T23:55:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	the partition graph free space,the partition table right under it "unusable"
2011-09-17T23:56:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	Can you pastebin the output of 'sudo fdisk -l' to pastebin.com?
2011-09-18T00:00:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	pastebin.ubuntu.com/6918132
2011-09-18T00:01:00.000Z	stephenthemartyr	soreau	http://paste.ubuntu.com/691813/
2011-09-18T00:03:00.000Z	soreau	stephenthemartyr	The first two likely belong to the windows 7 system, not sure what the other two are. Try deleting them from windows if they're not holding any valuable data
