2006-06-05T13:51:00.000Z	Morrowyn		you could try turning off dri, which i always do
2006-06-05T13:52:00.000Z	Morrowyn		i have  Load Glcore  and load dri  commented out, and only have load glx in my xorg.conf  (im using the nvidia 3rd party drivers)
2006-06-05T13:53:00.000Z	Morrowyn		when you are on ati, it might be different, i kinda avoid ati like the plague when it comes to linux
2006-06-05T13:53:00.000Z	boxemall		morrowyn, right now i have xubuntu running. i can't even acces alsamixer. it says: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
2006-06-05T13:53:00.000Z	Morrowyn		sudo alsamixer
2006-06-05T13:53:00.000Z	Morrowyn		perhaps?
2006-06-05T13:54:00.000Z	boxemall		morrowyn, same with sudo prefix
2006-06-05T13:54:00.000Z	Morrowyn		okies
2006-06-05T13:55:00.000Z	Morrowyn		try sudo alsaconf    , but after that im running out of options
2006-06-05T13:56:00.000Z	boxemall		morrowyn, it says "sudo: alsaconf: command not found"
2006-06-05T13:56:00.000Z	Morrowyn		ok boxemall , im sorry , what type of soundcard do you have anyways?

2006-06-05T13:59:00.000Z	Morrowyn		http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?threadid=294112  and http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=169178   boxemall
2006-06-05T14:00:00.000Z	Morrowyn		they discuss your problem, although they seem rather old, weird why they havent fixed this in ubuntu
2006-06-05T14:00:00.000Z	boxemall	skippy81	it says: "FATAL: Module snd_ice1712 not found."
2006-06-05T14:01:00.000Z	Morrowyn	boxemall	  you might wanna  sudo apt-get install alsa-tools  alsa-tools-gui
