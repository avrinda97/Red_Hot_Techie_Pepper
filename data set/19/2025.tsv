2010-07-31T20:31:00.000Z	Fernandos		ubuntu asks me for the wifi password altough it is correct. I can't go online with wifi. Why???
2010-07-31T20:32:00.000Z	Fernandos		no it's absolutely correct
2010-07-31T20:32:00.000Z	Fernandos		I triple checked that
2010-07-31T20:33:00.000Z	Fernandos		it works in windows with the same settings

2010-07-31T20:35:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	what NIC do you have
2010-07-31T20:35:00.000Z	Fernandos	rlankfo	how do I find that out?
2010-07-31T20:36:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	you could open up the machine and look at the card.. lspci might give you some info
2010-07-31T20:36:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	if you are dual booting you could use something like pcwizard in windwos
2010-07-31T20:36:00.000Z	Fernandos	rlankfo	Network controller: Intel Corporation WiFi Link 1000 Series
2010-07-31T20:38:00.000Z	Fernandos	rlankfo	does that help?
2010-07-31T20:39:00.000Z	Fernandos	rlankfo	I don't know why I can't connect with wifi :(
2010-07-31T20:39:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	i had a similar problem that was specific to a broadcom NIC, so doesn't appear you are having the same problem
2010-07-31T20:39:00.000Z	Fernandos	rlankfo	how did you fix it?
2010-07-31T20:40:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	ndiswrapper
2010-07-31T20:40:00.000Z	Fernandos	rlankfo	would you say I should install ndiswrapper ?
2010-07-31T20:41:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	i would find out the exact card you have and check the forums
2010-07-31T20:41:00.000Z	rlankfo	Fernandos	ndiswrapper is a major p in the a as well, chances are it's not a compatability issue with your card so it probably won't help you
