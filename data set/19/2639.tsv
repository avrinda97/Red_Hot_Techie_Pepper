2010-07-28T11:29:00.000Z	kisuke		does any one have any idea how to fix "association took too long" errors?
2010-07-28T11:30:00.000Z	KE1HA	kisuke	are you using WPA wireless? is that where the error is happening?
2010-07-28T11:32:00.000Z	kisuke	KE1HA	one sec and i will paste bin the last 30 lines of /var/logs/daemon.log
2010-07-28T11:33:00.000Z	KE1HA	kisuke	first though, is this a wireless conneciton error? if not wehre / when is the error happening, and what Ubuntu Version are we talkign about here?
2010-07-28T11:35:00.000Z	kisuke	KE1HA	ubuntu 10.04 netboook remix, and yes it is a wlan problem, now that the darn thing (mostly) works
2010-07-28T11:35:00.000Z	KE1HA	kisuke	there's a bug in the wpasuplicant aps, a couple actually.
2010-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	kisuke	KE1HA	ther is also a kernel regression that makes getting broadcom 43xx wireless chipsets working ...painful

2010-07-28T11:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	kisuke	not much I can do on this one im affraid, if it's working, yet intermitently, they your setup and config is correct, and like I said earlier, there's a couple of bugs in the WPA applicaitons.
2010-07-28T11:48:00.000Z	kisuke	KE1HA	any ideas where i can get the nightlys?
