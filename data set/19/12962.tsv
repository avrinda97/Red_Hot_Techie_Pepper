2005-09-22T16:01:00.000Z	pluffsy		I can't seem to get this character:  on top of another character as I can on other OS:es. how do I solve that?
2005-09-22T16:01:00.000Z	pluffsy		it turns out like this when I try: emile
2005-09-22T16:02:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	add the character pallet utility to your panel
2005-09-22T16:02:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	and/or set a compose key
2005-09-22T16:02:00.000Z	pluffsy	crimsun	what is a compose key?
2005-09-22T16:03:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	it's a key that allows you to use the extended chars (hence the "compose" name)
2005-09-22T16:03:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	like this-> 
2005-09-22T16:04:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	for instance, under System> Preferences> Keyboard> Layout Options> Compose key position, I set the right Ctrl on my UK keyboard to be compose
2005-09-22T16:05:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	then to make the , I hold Compose and type ', then I type e
2005-09-28T16:23:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	it's b.s. My wrt54g works great.
2005-09-28T16:24:00.000Z	pluffsy	crimsun	alright.
2006-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	one of the developers has dapper working mostly
2006-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	pluffsy	crimsun	cool. I get a macbook tomorrow, and I would really like to able to dual-boot it with ubuntu
2006-03-12T14:40:00.000Z	pluffsy	crimsun	is it mainly an issue of getting an EFI bootloader to work with ubuntu, or are there other problems?
2006-03-12T14:40:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	oh, that's long resolved. It's mostly smaller things like sound now.
2006-03-12T14:41:00.000Z	pluffsy	crimsun	ahh I see. stuff like the fan control, is that something ubuntu needs to implement?
2006-03-12T14:41:00.000Z	crimsun	pluffsy	perhaps. I'm not actively hacking on it (lack the hardware).
2006-03-12T14:43:00.000Z	pluffsy	crimsun	right. do you know if official support for the intel macs are planned in dapperdrake?
