2008-02-22T23:06:00.000Z	pushpop		what command would I use to move all files in 1 directory to another?
2008-02-22T23:08:00.000Z	pushpop		MasterMalias clean mv * /home/user/trash ?
2008-02-22T23:08:00.000Z	pushpop		prince yes
2008-02-22T23:08:00.000Z	pushpop		but what would be the proper syntax?
2008-02-22T23:09:00.000Z	pushpop		ok
2008-02-22T23:11:00.000Z	pushpop		thanks
2008-02-22T23:12:00.000Z	pushpop		marC>clean
2008-02-22T23:12:00.000Z	pushpop		mv: cannot rename trash to /users/students/mpare047/trash/trash: Invalid argument
2008-02-22T23:12:00.000Z	pushpop		what am i doing wrong
2008-02-22T23:12:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	nothing
2008-02-22T23:13:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	that command is doing exactly what it says
2008-02-22T23:13:00.000Z	pushpop	Chousuke	its trying to rename the folder though no?
2008-02-22T23:13:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	but "trash" is in the directory you're cleaning, so it tries to move trash into itself
2008-02-22T23:13:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	it's harmless, though.
2008-02-22T23:14:00.000Z	pushpop	Chousuke	but I just want it to move files not directories?
2008-02-22T23:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	that'll move *everything*
2008-02-22T23:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	directories are files
2008-02-22T23:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	pushpop	if you want to move only non-directory files, you need a more complicated command
2008-02-22T23:15:00.000Z	pushpop	Chousuke	thanks
