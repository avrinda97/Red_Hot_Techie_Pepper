2007-08-04T08:54:00.000Z	khandi		xlv i am in (k)ubuntu now... but i cant format it.... i dont know what is wrong... it says the drive is virtual
2007-08-04T08:55:00.000Z	khandi		xlv: i am in kubuntu. what must i do step by step to format my second drive (sdb1) so it becomes my linux second drive.. so i can write files to it. currently it is a NTSF drive...
2007-08-04T08:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	YOu can write to NTFS drives :)   ntfs-3g ntfs-common
2007-08-04T08:56:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	fdisk is the command for formatting driver -- see man fdisk
2007-08-04T08:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Whhops - sorry wrong command... Something like mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1   change /dev/sdb1 to the actual drive path
2007-08-04T08:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	YOu can also always type "man command" in a terminal for complete docs
2007-08-04T09:01:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Don't think - know when reformatting - df -i wil list filesystems :)
2007-08-04T09:02:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Yes, it needs to be mounted, but you can df -i to see what's mounted already...
2007-08-04T09:03:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Can you see the drive in file manager (Computer)
2007-08-04T09:04:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	If not mounted, this might help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions?
2007-08-04T09:05:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	OK.. check props for path or look at df -i in command line and that will give you your path..
2007-08-04T09:07:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	If you can see in File Manager it's already mounted.... You have to get path...
2007-08-04T09:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Using Ubuntu 6 or 7?
2007-08-04T09:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	You have ntfs-3g installed then I imagine ? And can you browse files on drive from FIle Manager
2007-08-04T09:12:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Ah... sorry you lost me... If you can browse files you can see mount point and therefore reformat...
2007-08-04T09:15:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Wha? no - that's a ubotu message to linux_  ... Are there multiple partitions on your external drive or something?
2007-08-04T09:16:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Then if you can see it and browse files on it... what I said b4 :)
2007-08-04T09:18:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	Sorry dunno about virtual drive - you're using KDE?
2007-08-04T09:20:00.000Z	ShackJack	khandi	K, sorry I can help you with virtual drive.. but if it's mounted you should be able to reformat...
