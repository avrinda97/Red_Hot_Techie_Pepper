2009-07-21T02:54:00.000Z	lancerocke		can anyone help me with virtualbox or point me in the direction of where i can get help via IRC? im having trouble getting sound working in my virtual machine (virtualbox). i installed guest additions and my network/internet is working fine but the sound isnt. i went into the machine's settings and selected every different sound driver  combination (also/soundblaster, pulseaudio/soundblaster etc.) and the sound still isnt working in win

2009-07-21T02:56:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	Are you using the open source Vbox or the one from the website?
2009-07-21T02:56:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	the one from the website not opensource
2009-07-21T02:56:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	Ok did you recheck ubuntu sound that it is currently functioning?
2009-07-21T02:57:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	yes i played a movie
2009-07-21T02:57:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	What does vbox list as audio controllers? And list your settings from the vbos sound tab for me.
2009-07-21T02:58:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	wow i just rechecked by playing a movie and my sound isnt working on ubuntu
2009-07-21T02:58:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	Yeah I figured that was prob it.
2009-07-21T02:58:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	what can i do?
2009-07-21T02:59:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	Check your speakers are turned on, sound control is not muted and volume is up.
2009-07-21T02:59:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	actually i just used another app to open the movie and the sound is working
2009-07-21T02:59:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	ok
2009-07-21T03:00:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	What operating system did you install that sound does not work with? Windows?
2009-07-21T03:00:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	windows 7
2009-07-21T03:01:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	Could possibly be that Windows 7 is not completed yet, and also may not be compatible with Vbox as of yet. Try installing Ubuntu in it and see if that works then you can verify if Vbox sound is working as it should be. My guess is that its not fully Windows 7 ready yet.
2009-07-21T03:02:00.000Z	lancerocke	linuxguy2009	i will try but my friend who has the same motherboard did it and has the sound working. i would not have tried windows 7 on vbox if he didnt
2009-07-21T03:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	lancerocke	Your friend may have a different W7 build than you.
