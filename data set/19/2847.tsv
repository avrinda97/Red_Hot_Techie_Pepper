2010-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	mbn_18		ATI*
2010-09-11T15:54:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	first thing to check: if  /tmp/.X0-lock exists, delete it and reboot
2010-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	you will only be able to see it using an ls -la
2010-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	mbn_18	sprung	I cant loging. main screen black + cant ssh from laptop.
2010-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	ask somebody else
2010-09-11T15:59:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	software raid is not as good as hardware RAID
2010-09-11T15:59:00.000Z	mbn_18	sprung	depend on many thing. though hard raid cost allot
2010-09-11T15:59:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	not really
2010-09-11T16:00:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	i mean what is "a lot" to you?
2010-09-11T16:00:00.000Z	mbn_18	sprung	and I dont mean the crappy card that emulate hardware raid
2010-09-11T16:00:00.000Z	mbn_18	sprung	its software
2010-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	that didn't make any sense
2010-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	i think you are confusing hardware RAID and having a hot-swappable backplane or something. hardware raid is hardware raid.
2010-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	mbn_18	sprung	All the cheap raid cards are kind software raid
2010-09-11T16:02:00.000Z	mbn_18	sprung	go ask #linux-raid
2010-09-11T16:02:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	you're having a fundamental misunderstanding.
2010-09-11T16:02:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	Werner_ explains it almost like i would say it
2010-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	sprung	mbn_18	if it is something that you can actually touch, and its sole function is RAID, that's called "hardware" therefore it's a hardware RAID
