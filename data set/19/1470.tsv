2011-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	that might not work depending on the filesystem
2011-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	why is truecrypt bad?
2011-02-21T11:02:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	you might as well not run truecrypt if you want the benefits of encryptions & obfuscation
2011-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	thanks, I'll keep it in mind & check into freeOFTE
2011-02-21T11:13:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	god no, i just wanted to know which ones were for show; and if any of them were actually usable
2011-02-21T11:05:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	if you're going to bother encrypting things you might as well use something thats not open to just about every trivial crypto attack there is
2011-02-21T11:08:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	disk encryption in general is bullshit; but the novelty of some encrypted area is not
2011-02-21T11:10:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	lol
2011-02-21T11:11:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	its for stuff that you can't let out of your possession without concious effort
2011-02-21T11:13:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	you sound impassioned on the subject, are you in the security field?
2011-02-21T11:14:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	so you did a fair amount of homework on the subject?
2011-02-21T11:25:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	oddly enough wikipedia is a good enough resource for checking most of them out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_encryption_software but crypto is Hard(TM) and people just using it without knowing what they're doing can compromise even well conceived systems
2011-02-21T11:27:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	I saw that article & plan to read it more thoroughly over my morning coffee... thank you for the suggestion, though :)
2011-02-21T11:27:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	even freeofte is a compromise, but it works with native things on the linux side (and being well fleshed out on the linux side, isn't ill concieved and awful :)
2011-02-21T11:29:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	all security is a compromise and I don't think there are any absolutes in encryption, but the schemes are getting pretty good
2011-02-21T11:30:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	you can't just tape it on and get any of the purported benefits of merely having it encrypted though; that it can't be grepped is like the smallest part of it :]
2011-02-21T11:32:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ohsix	True, but pretty far OT... we'd better not clog up the intertubes with this much more ;)
2011-02-21T11:34:00.000Z	ohsix	Chipzzz	if you're going to be defending your data from something, know your possible attackers
