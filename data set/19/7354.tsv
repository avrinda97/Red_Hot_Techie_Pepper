2008-04-26T03:16:00.000Z	mtaylor		hey guys - anything know anything about ssh X11 forwarding in hardy?
2008-04-26T03:16:00.000Z	mtaylor		my hardy client machine doesn't seem to be doing it, even if I ssh -X
2008-04-26T03:17:00.000Z	mtaylor		xterm Xt error: Can't open display:
2008-04-26T03:17:00.000Z	mtaylor		xterm:  DISPLAY is not set
2008-04-26T03:19:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	if the connectivity isn't open both ways, I don't see how you can establish an ssh session
2008-04-26T03:20:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	because that's how ssh works
2008-04-26T03:20:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	I'm sshing outbound through the firewall
2008-04-26T03:20:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	can you reach the remote machine through the firewall?
2008-04-26T03:21:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	yes. but that's an outbound connection
2008-04-26T03:22:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	what you need to do is find out if ssh needs another open port for the incoming traffic... anybody got any ideas?
2008-04-26T03:22:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	it doesn't
2008-04-26T03:22:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	then if the remote machine has port 22 open, I guess you shouldn't have any trouble. unless I don't understand your problem
2008-04-26T03:23:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	its ssy -Y not -X
2008-04-26T03:23:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	kick me, you wish to run an app on the remote host and have it show on your local machine? use -Y
2008-04-26T03:24:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	mtaylor@solace:/usr/local$ ssh -Y mordred@camelot xterm
2008-04-26T03:24:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	but I'm also pretty sure it's -X
2008-04-26T03:25:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	hwilde, hmmm... never needed to do the whole X display thing before. -Y usually suffices for me, I can run almost any app that way
2008-04-26T03:26:00.000Z	nucco	mtaylor	did you check that X forwarding or something is enabled on the remote host? it could have an effect. Just guessing though
2008-04-26T03:27:00.000Z	mtaylor	nucco	don't forget to quote $DISPLAY from your local shell with ' 's
