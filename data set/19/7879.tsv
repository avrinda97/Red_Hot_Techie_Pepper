2010-10-12T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	stop please
2010-10-12T21:07:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	stop what?
2010-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	pushing debian for no good reason, he's asking for support with ubuntu, no recommend a different distro
2010-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	Actually he just mentioned wanting a different distro
2010-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	perhaps you missed that?
2010-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	because he can't get ubuntu to work
2010-10-12T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	no-one wants to boot you, please just try to focus on resolving th ubuntu issues
2010-10-12T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	please stop,
2010-10-12T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	calm down and help out,
2010-10-12T21:12:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	I will answer questions how I like.  Boot me.  It's what I expect from this community.
2010-10-12T21:13:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	if someone asks me about another distro  I'm going to tell them.
2010-10-12T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	then you'll be offtopic, so please don't
2010-10-12T21:14:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	how can it be off topic when someone asks me?
2010-10-12T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	because this channel is for ubuntu support only, not general linux questions
2010-10-12T21:14:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	it's support to describe how a distro differs from the one you are using, especially if that distro doesn't have the same problems you're seeing.
2010-10-12T21:15:00.000Z	linenoise	ikonia	Are you seriously going to argue that I can't compare distros?
2010-10-12T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	linenoise	not at all,
