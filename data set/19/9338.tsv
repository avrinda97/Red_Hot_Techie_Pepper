2006-11-19T09:29:00.000Z	dogie		does antone know if the remote and receiver that came bundled with the nvidia personal cinema everything will work with lirc in ubuntu?
2006-11-19T09:30:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	probably not.
2006-11-19T09:32:00.000Z	dogie	ashika	thanks, I read on a site that someone had the tnt rivia personal cinema up  and it had the same tuner chipset that mine uses so I thought I would ask
2006-11-19T09:33:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	Sorry what remote and what software agfain? Ill double check for you
2006-11-19T09:42:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	what software do you wnat to use it with
2006-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	for lirc you need the drivers from linuxtv.org for your card.
2006-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	unless you already have the linux drivers
2006-11-19T09:47:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	Dogie I just triple checked as long as you have all drivers everything will work fine. Nearly every model is supported.
2006-11-19T09:47:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	Your IR may or may not work I have no clue its 50-50.
2006-11-19T09:47:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	some IR devices seem to work while others dont. Dongles for example dont work
2006-11-19T09:48:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	Good luck dogie
2006-11-19T09:50:00.000Z	dogie	ashika	Ill check there but I am not intrested in the tuner I have a happauge 500 set up I was just trying to utilize the IR portion as I am using the tv out from the  breakout box, but I still have a problem with the tv out even though the nvidia settings allow me to enable it when I restart the x-session it fails and I have to restore the preivious conf file, but maybe that is my problem
2006-11-19T09:51:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	Try but make sure you have the drivers for the card as it also contains IR portion drivers. This will work 50-50
2006-11-19T09:52:00.000Z	dogie	ashika	,sorry I am a little green actually very green but I need other drivers then the drivers I installed from Nvidias site?
2006-11-19T09:52:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	oh you installed the linux drivers? Did you run LIRC
2006-11-19T09:53:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	so dogie whats the problem?
2006-11-19T09:54:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	Dogie try running lirc now and see if it works. In my opinion I think it will work as you have everything done good. I wish you good luck and let me know how it fares out.
2006-11-19T09:55:00.000Z	dogie	ashika	ok gonna try it in a bit thanks
2006-11-19T09:55:00.000Z	ashika	dogie	let me know! im interested in your result.
