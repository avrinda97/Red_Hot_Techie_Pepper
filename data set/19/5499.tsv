2008-10-09T01:28:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	thanx, i have been asking the question for the past 2 days and no one is replying , perhaps you could help ?
2008-10-09T01:28:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	probably not, but just ask the question
2008-10-09T01:29:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	as you can see, it is very busy in here, so answers are variable
2008-10-09T01:29:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	ok, i mapped a network drive in windows, the path to the drive is /media/500gbBackup on my ubuntu server,
2008-10-09T01:30:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	when trying to browse or crate folders, i get error access denied, so i'm guessing it has to do with permissions, but not sure how to set that
2008-10-09T01:30:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	all on one line
2008-10-09T01:30:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	are your permissions in /etc/fstab ok?
2008-10-09T01:32:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	i didnt even know about that ... going to look now
2008-10-09T01:32:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	any hints on what i should set there ?
2008-10-09T01:34:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	I thought there would have been a man page, but there doesn't seem to be one.
2008-10-09T01:36:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	can you pastebin it?
2008-10-09T01:36:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	are you familiar with samba as a domain member ?
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	a bit
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	here are instructions, i seem to follow and instead get worse results than what i already have http://pastebin.com/m60062c10
2008-10-09T01:38:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	i thought you were going to paste your fstab
2008-10-09T01:40:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	where is this valid_users thing you posted from?
2008-10-09T01:42:00.000Z	techsupport	emorris	from samba manual
2008-10-09T01:43:00.000Z	emorris	techsupport	not sure to be honest, you may/probably will get better answers in #samba, or if not, #linux
