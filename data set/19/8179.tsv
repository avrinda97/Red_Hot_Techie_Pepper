2007-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	I agree gimp pwnz but if you want something else then try wine to install it
2007-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	what distro you using?
2007-04-28T08:14:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	follow instructions here for ubuntu: http://wiki.winehq.org/Recommended_Packages Then download this: http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/system/emulators/wine/wine-0.9.36.tar.bz2 Then do this to install photoshop: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=17
2007-04-28T08:15:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	its alright I know how right brain people can be picky about their gui layout, I had a gf same way couldn't stand certain desktop themes I don't know you guys like color sensitive or something
2007-04-28T08:16:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	I can't send pms
2007-04-28T08:16:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	no you just want gimp with a photoshop gtk theme
2007-04-28T08:17:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	do you know how to code? if not how do you know what engine looks like?
2007-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	seriously just use wine, photoshop runs perfectly on linux
2007-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	agentnewb	Shadow_X	and you CAN use wine on 64 bit
