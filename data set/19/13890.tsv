2004-12-20T10:45:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		so i have a question. i currently have a gtk only system, don't use kdelibs. if i install programs like kopete/kpim/etc will the performance of my computer take a hit?
2004-12-20T10:45:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	not really
2004-12-20T10:45:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		would htose programs run just as fast under gnome?
2004-12-20T10:46:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	it'll just use a bit more RAM for the KDE libs
2004-12-20T10:46:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		heh ok... are you sure about that?
2004-12-20T10:49:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	yes. Unless you are seriously short of Hard Disk and/or RAM, it'll be just as fast
2004-12-20T10:49:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Ng	1 gig ram (usually using ~200-400 mb, and 240gig hd :)
2004-12-20T10:49:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	yeah, that should be fine ;)
2004-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Ng	it is soo tempting
2004-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	what was it you wanted to install?
2004-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		all my kde apps :)
2004-12-20T10:50:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		lol
2004-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	hehe, well you will probably notice that things don't integrate as well
2004-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		i switched from debian (after 4 years) always using kde
2004-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		haven't put any on
2004-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	Ng		|Quad-_: I've only really gotten into the mixing KDE/Gnome scenario for one-off apps like K3B
2004-12-20T10:51:00.000Z	|QuaD-_		but i miss kpim, kdevelop, etc
2004-12-20T10:52:00.000Z	Ng	|QuaD-_	perhaps a distro with KDE in it would be more sensible then? ;)
2004-12-20T10:52:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Ng	i normally would have said that, i wanted to see what the hype about ubuntu was all about. I am thoroughly impressed
