2010-06-12T02:23:00.000Z	Appl6	gee	You're entering uncertain territory.  You can pass --force-downgrade to dpkg, but this is risky business, and could seriously mess up your system.

2010-06-12T02:26:00.000Z	Appl6	gee	mmfb: That error is really easy to fix.  Just go back to the page you downloaded the package from, and under "Other Packages Related to" you'll see "libglib1.2ldbl".  Download that one, too, and install it first.
