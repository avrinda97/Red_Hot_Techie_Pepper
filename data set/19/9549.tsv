2006-11-07T14:40:00.000Z	Sutur		"File size limit exceeded". Received this error while copying a 4.4GB mdf dvd image from NTFS to FAT32 via the "cp" command. Suggestions please?
2006-11-07T14:40:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	FAT32 has a 2GB file size limit
2006-11-07T14:41:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	The file that failed to copy reported over 4GB.
2006-11-07T14:41:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	Via "ls -la" command.
2006-11-07T14:41:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	if FAT32 has a 2GB file size limit, then yes, a 4GB file is "file size exceeded"
2006-11-07T14:42:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	I understand, but the program copied OVER 2GB, it just couldn't seem to handle the last 200-ish mb's...
2006-11-07T14:43:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	how much actually got written?
2006-11-07T14:43:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	4294967295 of 4499005440...
2006-11-07T14:45:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	Bump for help, 4294967295 of 4499005440 was written...
2006-11-07T14:45:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	i misspoke, FAT32's limit is 4GB
2006-11-07T14:45:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table
2006-11-07T14:48:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	The file was originally stored on a FAT32 partition, is then possible that windows XP had some kind of extra program or service running to exceed the 4GB limit?
2006-11-07T14:48:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	no idea. i haven't touched Windows in almost 10 years.
2006-11-07T14:49:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	nothing Microsoft touches "makes any logical sense"
2006-11-07T14:53:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	Something I could have learnt a long time ago.
2006-11-07T14:54:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	I'm in the process of switching all my filesystems from fat32 & ntfs for the LAST damned time.
2006-11-07T14:54:00.000Z	mnepton	Sutur	smart move :)
2006-11-07T14:54:00.000Z	Sutur	mnepton	Thanks. Cya
