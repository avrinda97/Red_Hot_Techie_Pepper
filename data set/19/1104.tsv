2011-09-08T22:33:00.000Z	fadax		I have  a win7 computer which was working fine a few days ago but is now unable to startup (doesn't even get to the win7 loading screen). I thought maybe it's a hard disk problem and so wanted to check the hard disk. I have a ubuntu liveCD so thought it would be good to try and check the disk from here. How would I do that once I've booted into the liveCD? Thanks for any help
2011-09-08T22:34:00.000Z	B0g4r7	fadax	there is a handy program called "badblocks" for doing this.
2011-09-08T22:36:00.000Z	fadax		ok I'll try running badblocks. will it still work fine since my hard disk is in NTFS format which is different to ubuntu's disk format?  ActionParsnip well I already ran memtest for a while, and it didn't find any problems with the RAM
2011-09-08T22:37:00.000Z	B0g4r7	fadax	all badblocks does is check for media defects on the device being tested.  It won't care what is on the device.
2011-09-08T22:37:00.000Z	fadax		ok thanks,I'll try and run that then
2011-09-08T22:38:00.000Z	fadax		by the way, does liveCD use the hard disk at all?
2011-09-08T22:38:00.000Z	B0g4r7	fadax	you'll basically want to boot, determind the name of the device to test (usually /dev/sda or maybe /dev/sdb), and run 'badblocks -vv /dev/sda', substituting the correct device name if it differs.
2011-09-08T22:39:00.000Z	B0g4r7		A livecd should not touch the hard drive unless you ask it to.
2011-09-08T22:39:00.000Z	fadax	B0g4r7	ok I see, thanks
2011-09-08T22:42:00.000Z	fadax		hmm actually I can't seem to boot from the liveCD. It booted to the Welcome menu and then I clicked "Try Ubuntu" but it hasn't moved for over 5 minutes. (just stuck on the busy cursor)
2011-09-08T22:42:00.000Z	fadax		does that indicate a hardware problem?
2011-09-08T22:44:00.000Z	B0g4r7		What does it mean when Ubuntu desktop shows a tiny blue triangle in the upper left corner of the screen, by the menu?
2011-09-08T22:51:00.000Z	fadax	B0g4r7	I ran fdisk -l and I have three devices /dev/sda1 2 and 3..
2011-09-08T22:52:00.000Z	fadax		is the one with the most blocks likely to be my win7 device?
2011-09-08T22:53:00.000Z	fadax		dev/sda3 has the most blocks
2011-09-08T22:58:00.000Z	B0g4r7	fadax	you want to check the whole device.  Just /dev/sda.  sda1, sda2, etc represent partitions on that device.
2011-09-08T23:00:00.000Z	fadax	B0g4r7	oh right ok I see. I'm running the badblocks test now. by the way I mounted the disk from the livecd and was able to browse my windows 7 files (documents etc). doesn't this mean that the hard disk is probably alright?
2011-09-08T23:01:00.000Z	B0g4r7	fadax	it means that it's at least partly working.  If badblocks doesn't find any errors then you have some other problem, most likely software.
