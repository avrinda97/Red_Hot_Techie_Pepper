2011-04-19T17:45:00.000Z	Soothsayer		does the drive need to formatted necessarily as FAT32 or NTFS will do ?
2011-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	We use ext4 -- We don't use FAT32 or NTFS.
2011-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	ye I know, but this "Universal USB INstaller" says it will format as fat32
2011-04-19T17:47:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	Oh you're installing it via USB? Fat32 will be fine. The worst scenario? It does not work.
2011-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	ok :-) creating the USB now..
2011-04-19T17:50:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	I have been using linux for several years too. I made the switch when Vista came out. Vista was a terrible OS. Now Windows 7 came out and they're working on Windows 8. I just can't go back.
2011-04-19T18:09:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	Definitely a good guide to read. :P
2011-04-19T20:52:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	I take it UbuntuLiveCD work well?
2011-04-19T20:53:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	yes, it worked fine.
2011-04-19T20:54:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	Nice. I have to ask why you didn't opt for Automatic Partition (Full disk) Installation?
2011-04-19T20:54:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	I did that first! It failed.
2011-04-19T20:54:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	I tried it thrice infact! Looks like there's an issue with formatting for ext4 on this disk.
2011-04-19T20:55:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	You ran md5sum on the iso? (I guess not). Anyway, good luck. ext3 will work just great. It's far better than NTFS. :P
2011-04-19T20:55:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	yes, md5 matched too. (I really did do an md5)
2011-04-19T20:59:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	It does.
2011-04-19T21:00:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	Usually, the automatic installation would make everything done smoothly -- but in some situation like yourself, things are more difficult / troubleshooting for newcomers. So sorry. :(
2011-04-19T21:01:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	it's alright. I expected some glitches with this laptop especially. Great UI though, hats-off!
2011-04-19T21:02:00.000Z	red2kic	Soothsayer	Remember. Everything are pretty much customizable. If you find something you don't like, the chance is that you frigging can change it. Freedom. :)
2011-04-19T21:04:00.000Z	Soothsayer	red2kic	yup. I've been a debian server user.
