2012-04-11T10:56:00.000Z	Stryker		hey, I cant boot sdb1. What's my problem? here's all the info you need: http://pastebin.com/SpDQVR2S
2012-04-11T10:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	that looks like some sort of "fix grub" tool output
2012-04-11T10:57:00.000Z	Stryker	ikonia	it's made by someone on sourceforge
2012-04-11T10:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	what's the actual problem/error
2012-04-11T10:59:00.000Z	Stryker	ikonia	i can't boot sdb1, my windows drive. All I get is a blank screen
2012-04-11T11:07:00.000Z	Stryker	ikonia	i can't boot sdb1, my windows drive. All I get is a blank screen
2012-04-11T11:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	Stryker do you believe it's booting the right partition
2012-04-11T11:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	that patebin doesn't really show much of value, more so as you've got such an over the top dual boot setup with grub 2
2012-04-11T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	ok, so if it's booting the right partition, but all you are getting is a blank screen, that suggests the windows install has a problem of some sort, or grub is not passing the right boot information
2012-04-11T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	I'd suggest (and this is just a suggestion) that you have conflicting grub installs (eg: grub from one linux install is overwriting the grub from another install) and the windows partition isn't actually setup properly to boot
2012-04-11T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	that is just a suggestion, but it's not uncommon in the setup you have
2012-04-11T11:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	the simple soloution for me would be to use windows to re-apply the windows MBR, test it, confirm it working, then re-apply 1 grub2 setup
2012-04-11T11:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	there we go then, I suggest you follow my suggestion
2012-04-11T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	use the windows setup disk
2012-04-11T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	get one
2012-04-11T11:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	tons of XP media available for shops/retail/ebay
2012-04-11T11:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	then buy it really quick
2012-04-11T11:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	you can't boot into windows to get to the windows install to use any of the microsoft tool, therefore the correct way is to use the install media.
2012-04-11T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Stryker	you've not asked a sensible question in ##windows the question is "how do I re-apply the Microsoft boot loader to the MBR of my disk, without access to Windows or any install media"
