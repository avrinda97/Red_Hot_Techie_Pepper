2007-07-05T14:36:00.000Z	powergoal	niuq	did you do a manual install, or through the package manager?
2007-07-05T14:36:00.000Z	niuq	powergoal	manual install
2007-07-05T14:42:00.000Z	powergoal	niuq	your best bet might be to go through the steps of reinstalling it, and then just remove the files that it moves around.  Sometimes its hard to trace where they go
2007-07-05T14:44:00.000Z	niuq	powergoal	you mean trace the package while i am installing it?
2007-07-05T14:44:00.000Z	powergoal	niuq	right, maybe run it like ``$# make install >> install.log''  so you can find the files later
