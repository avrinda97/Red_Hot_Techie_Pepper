2007-09-19T16:51:00.000Z	Smokem		synaptic only shows ndiswrapper 1.38, how do i update to 1.47
2007-09-19T16:52:00.000Z	Smokem		downloaded the tar.gz configd, made, and installed but ndiswrapper -v still shows 1.38
2007-09-19T16:52:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	go to google and type ndiswrapper the first option there you will find the 1.47
2007-09-19T16:54:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	use this link http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/content/view/17/2/
2007-09-19T16:55:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	or type sudo wget http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/content/view/17/2/
2007-09-19T16:55:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	That should do it
2007-09-19T16:57:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	you have to remove the old version first
2007-09-19T05:01:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	1: sudo rmmod ndiswrapper 2: sudo apt-get remove ndiswrapper-utils
2007-09-19T05:01:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	Now you need to hunt down and find all instances of ndiswrapper left on your file system.
2007-09-19T05:02:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	To become root and look for these files you need.
2007-09-19T05:03:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	Delete all instances of ndiswrapper. Then run the two previous commands over again.
2007-09-19T05:04:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	after that you can install the new version
2007-09-19T05:07:00.000Z	giox	Smokem	 If you have any questions go to this page is a step by step on how to remove it and install it http://ubuntu1501.blogspot.com/2007/01/fixing-wifi-on-dell-1501.html
