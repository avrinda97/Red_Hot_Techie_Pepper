2010-02-18T09:32:00.000Z	Dread348		I installed a CLI only version of linux to a server box from a USB flash drive and when I remove the flash drive is has an error, cannot find bootable device.  help?
2010-02-18T09:34:00.000Z	Dread348		I am using minimal CD image and I have tried using UNEbootin and others.  All with the same result
2010-02-18T09:35:00.000Z	Dread348		I suspect that like a GUI version I need to use the install command but I don't know it for the CLI
2010-02-18T09:35:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	could it be something stupidly easy, like making sure your bios is set to try to boot from teh HD , and not just from the usb key?
2010-02-18T09:35:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	no prob, but nice to try the easy solutions first.

2010-02-18T09:45:00.000Z	Dread348	thiefy	I have tried that....Normally, when you install from a USB key.  After installation can you remove the USB Key and boot to linux?  Or do you have to leave the key in and execute a command to transfer the bootable system to the HDD?
2010-02-18T09:45:00.000Z	Dread348	thiefy	that sounded REALLY dumb
2010-02-18T09:46:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	i know nothing about a CLI / no gui install, but after you've done the install, you can shut down and reboot and it should be all good to go. meaning - no other command...
2010-02-18T09:46:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	hey, if there is a easy solution, try it first.
2010-02-18T09:46:00.000Z	Dread348	thiefy	thanks I will go and try it again on your recomendations
2010-02-18T09:47:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	make srue it's actually installed.
2010-02-18T09:48:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	you could reboot with a GUI ubuntu on a usb key and see waht's on the hard drive. see if the bloody OS is even there. haha
2010-02-18T10:23:00.000Z	Dread348	thiefy	I FOUND THE PROBLEM!!1  My HDD isn't bootable so says fdisk.  How do I fix that?
2010-02-18T10:24:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	go get a distro called parted magic (it'll fix partitions and hds.)
2010-02-18T10:24:00.000Z	Dread348	thiefy	thanks!!!
2010-02-18T10:24:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	- if your partition is having a problem... taht'll fix it. OR maybe you just need to edit your boot file.
2010-02-18T10:25:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	search google for help.ubuntu.com grub2
2010-02-18T10:25:00.000Z	thiefy	Dread348	taht is where your boot options are.
