2012-03-07T22:08:00.000Z	DrDamnit		Could upgrading to natty fix my IP problem?
2012-03-07T22:09:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	DrDamnit	Upgrading ubuntu is not going to fix that.
2012-03-07T22:09:00.000Z	DrDamnit		Ho^Oh... I figured.
2012-03-07T22:09:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	DrDamnit	That's some weird gateway IP you haev there.
2012-03-07T22:09:00.000Z	Ho^Oh		Does it have to be static?
2012-03-07T22:10:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	That's the right gateway. This server is on a public static IP. It is a /28 network.
2012-03-07T22:10:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	DrDamnit	Change it back to automatic dhcp using network manager. Then right click on network manager on taskbar/notification bar and select "INFO".
2012-03-07T22:10:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	There is no GUI. This is the server install.
2012-03-07T22:11:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	Network manager was uninstalled because it is a known issue.
2012-03-07T22:11:00.000Z	DrDamnit		I just ran: sudo apt-get purge dhcp3-client
2012-03-07T22:11:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	I just ran "sudo apt-get purge dhcp3-client" think that will do it?
2012-03-07T22:12:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	DrDamnit	Not sure. Does it even connect to internet?
2012-03-07T22:13:00.000Z	Ho^Oh		Losing configuration may be caused my an automated process/running background program you might've installed
2012-03-07T22:13:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	Yes. Works fine for a couple of hours, then something happnes, and it decides that it wants a DHCP address, takes itself offline, and no one can get to it until I run /etc/init.d/networking restart from the console.
2012-03-07T22:14:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	DrDamnit	I think it's a good idea to investigate the softwares you installed to ubuntu server...
2012-03-07T22:15:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	It's my standard setup. LAMP and all the stuff that goes with it. Nothing special.
2012-03-07T22:16:00.000Z	Ho^Oh	DrDamnit	How did you installed lamp? o_O     Even a lamp install wouldn't do that.
2012-03-07T22:16:00.000Z	Ho^Oh		Might want to check for cron scripts.
2012-03-07T22:17:00.000Z	DrDamnit	Ho^Oh	This is my standard script: http://paste.ubuntu.com/873297/
