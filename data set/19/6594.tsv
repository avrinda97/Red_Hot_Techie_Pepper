2008-06-03T13:41:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan		how do i solve this pseudo-error?
2008-06-03T13:41:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan		 pidgin-games depends on pidgin (<< 3.0); however:
2008-06-03T13:41:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan		  Version of pidgin on system is 1:2.4.1-1ubuntu2.
2008-06-03T13:41:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-06-03T13:41:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	Flannel	8.04
2008-06-03T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	pidgin-games is from a third party, yes?  You should consult whomever packaged it (or find one for Hardy)
2008-06-03T13:42:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	Flannel	yes, from pidgin's developers
2008-06-03T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	Find a package meant for Hardy
2008-06-03T13:43:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	Flannel	i think it's because dpkg can't recognize the weird version format "1:2.4.1-1ubuntu2" that ubuntu uses
2008-06-03T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	No, that's not it.  It's just an indication of problems to come.  Even if you got it installed, it most likely wouldn't work too well, based on other library differences.
2008-06-03T13:45:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	Flannel	where can i find packages for ubuntu except ubuntu's repository?
2008-06-03T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	Well, see if whereever you got that one has a version for Hardy.  But, I'm not sure.
2008-07-18T16:38:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	you already have one
2008-11-11T13:34:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	You can always change it
2008-11-11T13:35:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	Flannel	which do you suggest?
2008-11-11T13:35:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	I like the default just fine, but theres tons of others out there
2008-11-11T13:35:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	Flannel	but rarely a good one. Aurora is good, but doesn't fit with firefox
2008-11-30T15:01:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	proposed is completely untested.
2008-11-30T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	yao_ziyuan	Mind taking this to #ubuntu-offtopic? its not really a support conversation anymore
