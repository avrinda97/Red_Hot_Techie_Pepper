2012-04-28T08:34:00.000Z	gaelfx		is there a way to make it support tab completion after sudo?
2012-04-28T08:35:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	add complete -cf sudo
2012-04-28T08:35:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	thank you :D
2012-04-28T08:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	just at the end?
2012-04-28T08:37:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	yeah
2012-04-28T08:37:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	if you don't want to log out or start a new shell, you can just do . ~/.bashrc to reload it
2012-04-28T08:38:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	it's all good, just opened a new terminal and tested
2012-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	do you know which driver it's loading for your touchpad?
2012-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	almost 100% certain it's xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
2012-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	It's detected as Name="SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"
2012-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	is it possible you accidentally disabled the touchpad in BIOS or using the fn hotkeys?
2012-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	Fn+F9 (enable/disable touchpad) key has no effect, BIOS doesn't have any settings available for it
2012-04-29T06:07:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	however, the behavior is very much as if it's disabled...evtest shows no events for the input device associated with it
2012-04-29T06:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	does it show up in lsusb? also, what laptop model is this?
2012-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	Doesn't show up in lsusb and it's a Toshiba NB505 netbook
2012-04-29T06:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	have you tried looking through the archlinux documentation RE:synaptics? I know it's not directly related to ubuntu, but there is a ton more info there than on the ubuntu documentation
2012-04-29T06:24:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	Haven't looked yet, will take a look
2012-04-29T06:40:00.000Z	ismarc_netbook	gaelfx	Arch documentation led me to https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/20830, which describes the behavior I'm seeing...time to add a config section for X, reload and hope for the best
2012-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	ismarc_netbook	good luck! I hope it works out
