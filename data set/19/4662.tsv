2008-11-27T00:40:00.000Z	nande12		hello all.  I have a question hopefully someone can help me with
2008-11-27T00:41:00.000Z	nande12		I recently installed ubuntu 8.10 on my usb stick using usb-creator
2008-11-27T00:41:00.000Z	nande12		can I make the usb drive writable?
2008-11-27T00:41:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	me too, that was awesome =D
2008-11-27T00:42:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	have you been able to write to the usb stick as ubuntu user?
2008-11-27T00:43:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	i couldn't access the usb drive in itself, didn't investigate much though
2008-11-27T00:44:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	I have tried chmod but it hasn't worked.  root has read/write and everyone elsee has read only
2008-11-27T00:44:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	ic, try -o remount,uid=1000,gid=1000
2008-11-27T00:46:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	huh?
2008-11-27T00:46:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	as in mount -o remount,uid=1000,gid=1000 /cdrom
2008-11-27T00:50:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	no luck
2008-11-27T00:53:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	how are the permissions?
2008-11-27T00:54:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	scheize, it didn't work :'(
2008-11-27T00:54:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	nope
2008-11-27T00:56:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	maybe a bind mount, mount -o bind,uid=1000,gid=1000 /cdrom /mnt/foo
2008-11-27T00:56:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	does it matter that I am running ubuntu off of it?
2008-11-27T00:56:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	it shouldn't
2008-11-27T01:00:00.000Z	nande12	snuitje	drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 foo
2008-11-27T01:06:00.000Z	snuitje	nande12	other thing you could try is remounting with umask=000
