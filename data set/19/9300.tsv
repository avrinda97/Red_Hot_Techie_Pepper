2008-01-19T23:56:00.000Z	_Dbug_		I installed a windows xp in a partition which takes half of the disk, the second half is unpartitionned. If I want to install unbunt as dual boot, all I have to do is select "Guided - use the largest contiguous free space", or is there something else I should do ?
2008-01-19T23:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	XP is already installed?
2008-01-19T23:56:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	yes
2008-01-19T23:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	That will work
2008-01-19T23:57:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	Just let it do the defaults to the unpartitioned space
2008-01-19T23:57:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	ok, I just ask because in a previous attempt two month a go I wiped the xp install :-/
2008-01-19T23:57:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	In all honesty though -- unless you use XP on that machine for gaming -- you won't need it
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	I was a die hard XP user (mainly for office & gaming) -- but have left it behind now
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	why do you think I have a quad core and a geforce 8800 :D
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	I'm planning to use Ubuntu as main OS, but I need XP for gaming
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	Yeah - I have that setup on my C2Duo box
2008-01-19T23:59:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	is the ntfs writing mode safe now ? Can I reasonably write stuff on the ntfs partition from Linux without alterating windows badly ?
2008-01-20T00:00:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	Supposedly -- I don't do it myself -- I've got a 50GB FAT32 partition that I store music on and stuff
2008-01-20T00:09:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	the file to edit to define the delay to wait before booting, is /boot/grub/grub.conf, correct ? I just need to change the value here and save ?
2008-01-20T00:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	I think so - let me double check
2008-01-20T00:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	menu.lst in /boot/grub
2008-01-20T00:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	Change the timeout value
2008-01-20T00:16:00.000Z	_Dbug_	Cpudan80	my windows install is alive, and grub works :)
2008-01-20T00:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80	_Dbug_	You did it right! :-)
