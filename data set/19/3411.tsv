2009-08-16T05:53:00.000Z	detrix42		Hello folks.  have an issue with Nvidia driver.  I get the following error:  API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module has version 173.14.16, but this NVIDIA driver component has version 173.14.20.  How do I remove the 14.20 driver?
2009-08-16T05:54:00.000Z	Ben64	detrix42	but 20 > 16
2009-08-16T05:54:00.000Z	detrix42	Ben64	yes, but I believe 20 is for different card
2009-08-16T05:54:00.000Z	Ben64	detrix42	20 should just be a version
2009-08-16T05:55:00.000Z	detrix42	Ben64	there is a missmatch between the driver and the module...
2009-08-16T05:56:00.000Z	detrix42	Ben64	then how do I update the module to 20
2009-08-16T05:57:00.000Z	detrix42	Ben64	I downloaded it from the nvidia web site. it did not update the modual
2009-08-16T05:58:00.000Z	Ben64	detrix42	don't install drivers from nvidia.com
2009-08-16T05:58:00.000Z	detrix42	Ben64	I do believe I read that somewhere..lol
2009-08-16T05:59:00.000Z	detrix42	Ben64	so how do I uninstall the driver from nvidia website?
2009-08-16T05:59:00.000Z	Ben64	detrix42	install a version on top
