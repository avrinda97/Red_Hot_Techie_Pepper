2009-10-02T01:11:00.000Z	Whitor		why is it that even after disabling my local firewall... local users on my network cannot connect to services running on my machine? They cant even ping me.
2009-10-02T01:11:00.000Z	Whitor		I'm trying to host a crack-attack game :)
2009-10-02T01:12:00.000Z	Whitor		I did a sudo ufw disable ... to no avail
2009-10-02T01:12:00.000Z	Whitor		worked fine on 8.10
2009-10-02T01:13:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	a good place to test to see if you have your ports properly set is canyouseeme.org
2009-10-02T01:14:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	but that would push through my external firewall... which would skew the results
2009-10-02T01:20:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	It wouldnt hurt to reboot to refresh the settings
2009-10-02T01:16:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	well i know i had similar issues, with my machine being access on the internal network but not the outside one..that was how i tested the ports...also make sure your isp isnt blocking the port on the incoming.
2009-10-02T01:16:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	this is all local that I'm talking about
2009-10-02T01:18:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	ok sorry.....sorry for late reply trying to think about your problem.
2009-10-02T01:19:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	ping doesnt work either way to or from your machine?
2009-10-02T01:19:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	only to my machine
2009-10-02T01:20:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	do I need to reboot after doing ufw disable ?
2009-10-02T01:21:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	only thing i am wondering is are you using a router?
2009-10-02T01:21:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	nope
2009-10-02T01:22:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	the only thing that changed was installing 9.04 .... works fine on the laptop sitting next to me running 8.10
2009-10-02T01:22:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	well cool that narrows it down for sure
2009-10-02T01:27:00.000Z	Whitor	trineox	good idea, I'm doing an angryipscan from another computer
2009-10-02T01:33:00.000Z	trineox	Whitor	i wouldnt know ive only been using 9.4 for awhile
