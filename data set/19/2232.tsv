2010-06-29T20:14:00.000Z	Benkinooby		hi i found out, that when the "lm" flag is set, my laptop has a 64 bit cpu. i typed cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "lm" and i got lahf_lm. so is this 64 bit or not? the output of cat /proc/cpuinfo is http://pastebin.com/9G5VUs06

2010-06-29T20:29:00.000Z	abhi_nav	Benkinooby	do as said by bazhang and see if a flag called 'lm' is listed. if yes then cpu is 64 if not then 32
