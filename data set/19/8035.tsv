2007-05-17T10:23:00.000Z	Zigosity		I'll deal with it.
2007-05-17T10:23:00.000Z	Zigosity		Might just go back to windows :\ lol
2007-05-17T10:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 a vfat or ntfs partition has its 'permissions' set when mounted. as a work around of mimitations in the vfat/ntfs compared to other - filesystems.
2007-05-17T10:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 so thats correct.
2007-05-17T10:24:00.000Z	Zigosity		Hurrah, I'm correct.
2007-05-17T10:25:00.000Z	Zigosity	dr_willis	Is there any way of changing the permissions that are set when mounted?
2007-05-17T10:25:00.000Z	Zigosity		>_<
2007-05-17T10:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 not that i am aware of. Never really had to worry about it much.
2007-05-17T10:26:00.000Z	Zigosity		Heh
2007-05-17T10:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 windows can read/write to ext2/3 now. :) so i rarely need to use vfat partitions any more
2007-05-17T10:27:00.000Z	Zigosity	dr_willis	Formatting the drive is -not- an option. I need the data on it.
2007-05-17T10:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 copy it over somewher then. back it up. ONE thing ive learhed the hard way. If y9our data is THAT impiorntant - BACK it up. You could lose it NOW at any time. :)
2007-05-17T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 you dont want to know the # of people ive seen the last 3 months that have had hd's just Die on them :)
2007-05-17T10:28:00.000Z	Zigosity	dr_willis	I know, I know... So, if I changed it to ext3, I would still be able to use it from windows?
2007-05-17T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zigosity	 yes. I use that fs-driver all the time :)
2007-05-17T10:29:00.000Z	Zigosity		Why does this have to be so damn complicated -__-
2007-05-17T10:30:00.000Z	Zigosity		I don't understand WHY I can't just share the stupid FAT32 partition as it is.
2007-05-17T10:33:00.000Z	Zigosity	dr_willis	Is there any particular reason why Linux people decided that FAT32 just shouldn't be shared, or are they just mean >_<.
