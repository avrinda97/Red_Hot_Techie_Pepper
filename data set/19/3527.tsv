2012-05-15T07:00:00.000Z	derp		hello all! quick question - i have a machine running some lubuntu version for bitcoin mining. almost everything has been gutted from the version except terminal and essential stuff.  i want to know what speed my P4 is running at.  the command "-sudo cat /proc/cpuinfo" doesnt work, it says no such command. my question is what dependencies do i need to get for that command to work ?
2012-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	derp		yes i did that lol

2012-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	what error message do you get?
2012-05-15T07:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	if you want a minial ubuntu install, install ubuntu-minimal! https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2012-05-15T07:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	first of all, drop the sudo, completely unnecessary.
2012-05-15T07:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	what happens if you just run "cat"?
2012-05-15T07:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	what do you get if you run "which cat"?
2012-05-15T07:11:00.000Z	derp	DarwinSurvivor	it didnt do anything. it dropped to the next line in term, and just sat there blank untill i killed it with ctrl c (i waited a couple minutes)
2012-05-15T07:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	was that when running "cat" or "which cat"?
2012-05-15T07:16:00.000Z	derp	DarwinSurvivor	that was just "cat"
2012-05-15T07:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	ok, that's normal (it's what cat does)
2012-05-15T07:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	what does "ls -l /proc/cpuinfo" report?
2012-05-15T07:22:00.000Z	derp	DarwinSurvivor	your command returned this "-r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 may 15 03:18 /proc/cpuinfo"  lol. was that intended ?
2012-05-15T07:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	yes. "cat /proc/cpuinfo" should work just fine according to those results.
2012-05-15T07:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	you're sure you didn't put a / at the very end?
2012-05-15T07:23:00.000Z	derp	DarwinSurvivor	i can do it again and check, one moment..
2012-05-15T07:27:00.000Z	derp	DarwinSurvivor	hey it worked that time! i must have made a typo. thanks for the help. ps, +1 for Darwinism ;)
2012-05-15T07:27:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	derp	no problem. typos are very common
