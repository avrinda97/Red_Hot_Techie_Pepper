2008-06-27T18:45:00.000Z	Huiu		anyone can tell me how to make my mouse side buttons hotkey back and front in firefox?
2008-06-27T18:46:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	use xmodmap, and map them to "Alt + Left" and "Alt + Right"
2008-06-27T18:47:00.000Z	Huiu	cjohnson	m8 i still dont understand how, i usexmodmap in terminal and then?
2008-06-27T18:48:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	that i'm not entirely sure of, I used btnx for my mouse buttons
2008-06-27T18:48:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	google "xmodmap tutorial" and i'm sure you'll get great results

2008-06-27T18:52:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	type "xev" in the term and then click them in the little window
2008-06-27T18:52:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	it'll tell you the button, as well as a ton of other information, in the terminal

2008-06-27T19:00:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	I had that problem, unfortunately, where the extra buttons didn't detect properly. I haven't found a fix yet
2008-06-27T19:00:00.000Z	Huiu	cjohnson	so there is not a solution right now?
2008-06-27T19:01:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	none that I've found, sadly
2008-06-27T19:01:00.000Z	Huiu	cjohnson	thanx m8 :)
2008-06-27T19:07:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	it's an alternate mouse button detection program...sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
2008-06-27T19:08:00.000Z	Huiu	cjohnson	i can find it in synaptic?
2008-06-27T19:08:00.000Z	cjohnson	Huiu	don't believe so, google it though it should be first result
2008-06-27T19:08:00.000Z	Huiu	cjohnson	or google it
