2009-12-20T09:05:00.000Z	purpley		hey guys
2009-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	purpley		I have a ubuntu live cd running on mmy other computer, I need to edit a partition how do i open the partition manager i know there is one on the live CD
2009-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	purpley		a GUI one preferably
2009-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	sudo gparted
2009-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	do so from the livecd
2009-12-20T09:14:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	gparted
2009-12-20T09:14:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	open terminal, type "sudo gparted" and press enter
2009-12-20T09:14:00.000Z	purpley	blakkheim	I'm assuming on my hardrive?
2009-12-20T09:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	gparted will scan for drives
2009-12-20T09:16:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	gparted
2009-12-20T09:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	you can run gparted from the livecd
2009-12-20T09:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	YES
2009-12-20T09:20:00.000Z	purpley	blakkheim	told me I can run gparted on my live cd
2009-12-20T09:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	if gparted isn't on the cd, run sudo aptitude install gparted
2009-12-20T09:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	if you want full disk encryption i would recommend looking into LUKS and dm-crypt
2009-12-20T09:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	but you will need a separate /boot partition
2009-12-20T09:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	how much ram do you have
2009-12-20T09:31:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	if you need to be able to put the computer in hibernation, make the swap at least as much as your amount of RAM
2009-12-20T09:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	purpley	free -t
