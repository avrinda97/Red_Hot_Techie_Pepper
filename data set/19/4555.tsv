2009-03-21T11:49:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	is your dhcp server configured for booting over network?
2009-03-21T11:49:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	im not that familiar with it - but settings for the .conf file are http://pastebin.com/m3ad36ac
2009-03-21T11:52:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	the method you have mentioned uses apache to server the boot file, is apache configured? do you see any network activity on your network card?
2009-03-21T11:53:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	no usb boot / no cd
2009-03-21T11:53:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	apache local host works ok
2009-03-21T11:55:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	do you see any activity on the LEDs of your network card or switch?
2009-03-21T11:55:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	yes both are flashing
2009-03-21T11:55:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	can you access the pc that serves the boot file?
2009-03-21T11:56:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	yes im on it right now that is where i configured the dhcp
2009-03-21T11:56:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	im also via a router
2009-03-21T11:56:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	try installing iptraf package on it and use it to watch what's going on on the network
2009-03-21T11:57:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	i suppose you cant tell if my config file is right or not ?
2009-03-21T11:57:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	or there is no other way to check the dchp is working - i do have another windows machine that i can connect to the network to see if the dhcp is working
2009-03-21T11:59:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	no, I can't probably, have you checked the syslog file? there you should see dhcp messages
2009-03-21T12:00:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	not you personally, but i mean me here on the machine that is where i have configured the dhcp server
2009-03-21T12:00:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	have you tried syslog file?
2009-03-21T12:01:00.000Z	JessicaParker	sarmisak	the dell seems to have found the server  i have client ip 192.168.1.10 mask 255.255.255.0 dhcp ip 192.168.1.88
2009-03-21T12:02:00.000Z	sarmisak	JessicaParker	ok, since apache is serving the files, have you checked its logs?
