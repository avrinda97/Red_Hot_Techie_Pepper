2010-12-30T12:50:00.000Z	carson		it is? now that i dont have linux on the computer, just two windows 7's, is grub in one of the windows 's or does it have its own partition or where is it now?
2010-12-30T12:50:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	I believe it caches itself to the harddrive
2010-12-30T12:51:00.000Z	carson	Us3r_Unfriendly	so if i deleted one of my windows 7's would grub be deleted again?
2010-12-30T12:54:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	can I ask you why you didn't just uninstall windows?
2010-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	well hope you give linux another chance some time...
2010-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	carson	Us3r_Unfriendly	because windows is stupid and i dont know how, deleting the partitions just seemed so much easier!
2010-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	but you deleted the linux partition though?  Guess I'm a bit confused at this point
2010-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	carson	Us3r_Unfriendly	oh i love linux WAY more then windows, im on linux on my laptop right now. but i installed 32 bit ubuntu on our family computer by mistake when its a 64 bit system, so the drivers and stuff wernt working, thats why im getting rid of it
2010-12-30T12:58:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	and everyone else: but to me the 32 bit seems like it works pretty smoothly compared to using a 64 bit and for example with 64 flash
2010-12-30T13:01:00.000Z	carson	Us3r_Unfriendly	yah, personaly i dont really see the difference, and for all the hassle of now i cant have windows xp <the windows i do like> or vista on the new 64 bit computer, so i cant dualboot it, and the audio editing software i love <cool edit pro 2.0, before it was bought out by adobe> isnt windows 7 compatible
2010-12-30T13:07:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	the cache of the hard drive
2010-12-30T13:08:00.000Z	carson	Us3r_Unfriendly	i feel really stupid for saying this, but what is the cashe? what does it mean
2010-12-30T13:10:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	carson	I might be wrong about the cache part
2010-12-30T13:12:00.000Z	carson	Us3r_Unfriendly	and okay, well atleast i know what cashe is now :P
