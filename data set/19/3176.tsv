2010-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	kassah		I have an UPS Thermal Printer... I was wondering how I'd find a driver for it?
2010-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	kassah		or unload it fully so vbox can pass through the usb
2010-07-15T05:42:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	what's the make/model number?
2010-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	Zebra LP2844 (Labels itself UPS Thermal 2844 to the computer)
2010-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	it's not exactly a common printer except amoung places like pharmacies and shipping docks
2010-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	i'll google around for a minute
2010-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	they cost over $600... and print on a very small label... their industrial =)
2010-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	is it serial or parallel or usb?
2010-07-15T05:48:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	USB
2010-07-15T05:49:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	have you seen this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9319169
2010-07-15T05:50:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	I suspect there is a module attached to it even though it's not fully installed preventing VirtualBox from being able to make use of it. so a way to look determine which modules were using a usb device would also work
2010-07-15T05:51:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	your vbox host is linux and the vbox guest is linux?
2010-07-15T05:51:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	guest is windows... working on a work project that requires me to program an app that prints to it...
2010-07-15T05:52:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	if it's supported in linux... I can just share it to the windows box... if it's pass-thru-able... that works even better
2010-07-15T05:52:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	good point, i forgot about a net share
2010-07-15T05:52:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	sadly, I havn't managed to convince the warehouse to switch to linux yet lol
2010-07-15T05:53:00.000Z	codebrainz	kassah	i'm not useful with printers, i don't have one, but i know the older-style serial/parallel ones are super easy to interface with even without drivers
2010-07-15T05:54:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	thanks for looking =)
2010-07-15T05:54:00.000Z	kassah	codebrainz	yeah... all of mine are network printers... this whole usb thing is foreign to me lol
