2006-03-17T14:23:00.000Z	p0mppu		is it part of the Ubuntu-thing that my console is located a bit too much left so part of the content is outside my screen?
2006-03-17T14:23:00.000Z	p0mppu		X is ok, but console isn't :)
2006-03-17T14:24:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	that's possibly an adjustment to be made on your monitor
2006-03-17T14:24:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	but wouldn't it affect the positioning in X too, if I altered it?
2006-03-17T14:24:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	oh, so you mean it's cut off on the virtual terminals?
2006-03-17T14:25:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	i would guess it's running at a different refresh rate on the VT's...
2006-03-17T14:25:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	surely, since I can get tv-out when in console, but not while in X :)
2006-03-17T14:25:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	some monitors can "remember" screen positions for different frequencies
2006-03-17T14:25:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	is that so? hmm..never heard before..
2006-03-17T14:26:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	nope, just tried and it moves the screen in every terminal = in different freqs
2006-03-17T14:27:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	no, sorry.
2006-03-17T14:28:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	i'm not sure if you set the refresh in X to match the VT refresh if that would fix it
2006-03-17T14:28:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	the problem in that would be (I've tested) that then Windows is moved off the screen, as this is a dual-booting machine :) (and my girlfriend uses Windows, so I really can't delete it even if I wanted to)
2006-03-17T14:29:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	so you should just match settings between windows and ubuntu, then things won't have to be adjusted (match refresh + resolution)
2006-03-17T14:31:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	well how would I do that? Windows seems to place the screen into different place than Ubuntu, even when I do use the same frequencies/resolutions in both of them (as far as I know and if I assume Windows doesn't lie to me)
2006-03-17T14:31:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	hrmm...so you can have the monitor confirm what the software is telling you about refresh/resolution
2006-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	it's in the OSD
2006-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	p0mppu	pestilence	yes, of course the monitor shows the freqs when I push that "menu" button
2006-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	pestilence	p0mppu	and they are the same in windows and ubuntu?
