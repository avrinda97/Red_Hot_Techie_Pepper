2007-04-01T11:55:00.000Z	Nehal		when installing ubuntu, is there an option to put the boot loader onto a floppy instead of the mbr?
2007-04-01T11:55:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	no
2007-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	why dont you want it to touch the MBR?
2007-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	i won't be using linux that much. windows will remain my primary partition, therefore it is unnecessary to add a bootloader
2007-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	instead, have it install grub in the MBR then change your grub config to make Windows the default choice.
2007-04-01T11:59:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	i prefer floppy, then i can simply select by inserting/removing it... it has always been a personal preference that i like...
2007-04-01T12:00:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	unfortunately, the ubuntu installer doesn't allow that.
2007-04-01T12:00:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	ok.. i guess i can just skip installing the bootloader, then put my own on the floppy
2007-04-01T12:01:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	nm, i can install to floppy ... i found it in the installation docs
2007-04-01T12:02:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	really? then i was wrong before then.
2007-04-01T12:04:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	http://ftp.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-i386/current/doc/manual/en/ch06s03.html#id2514188  ... look at 'other choice' in this section
2007-04-01T12:06:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	that info applies to Ubuntu 4.10 which is two years old.
2007-04-01T12:08:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html#di-make-bootable   there we go ;)
2007-04-01T12:09:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	so you will need a CD with debian-installer on it i guess.
2007-04-01T12:09:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	why is that?
2007-04-01T12:13:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	where can i find the info about which CDs have debian-installer on it?
2007-04-01T12:15:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	if you want the more advanced installer, which that doc u mentioned talks about, you'll need the alternate CD.  It's easier to just install the standard way and edit the grub config file easily leter.
2007-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	Nehal	unfo	nah.. i don't mind.... i installed slackware 5 years ago.. so i think i can handle it :)
2007-04-01T12:22:00.000Z	unfo	Nehal	then i think u can handle it too :)
