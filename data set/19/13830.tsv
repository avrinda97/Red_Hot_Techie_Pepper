2005-03-04T12:45:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	is your cd-rom volume muted?
2005-03-04T12:45:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	is your cd-rom hooked up to your sound card?
2005-03-04T12:49:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	did you build your computer yourself?
2005-03-04T12:49:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	does the cd-rom work in Windows?
2005-03-04T12:52:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	Linux sucks, go back to Windows
2005-03-04T12:53:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	no, you dumb
2005-03-04T12:53:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	because you don't know how to verbs and stuff
2005-03-04T12:54:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	anyway, I'm not sure what's wrong

2005-03-04T12:56:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	yes, it's all my fault, I'm sorry
2005-03-04T12:57:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	What would you like me to do to fix it?
2005-03-04T13:00:00.000Z	jmob	mamadou	ah, right, so you were looking for the warm fuzzy computing community that Linux offers?
