2006-06-18T10:26:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 do you have samba running?
2006-06-18T10:26:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 well, they're probably accessing shares then, just like a windows box
2006-06-18T10:27:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 yes, if not same workgroup/domain and you browse to it, that will happen.
2006-06-18T10:27:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 you can set up samba just like a windows box.
2006-06-18T10:28:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 check out the samba howtos. there's probably one for ubuntu somewhere.
2006-06-18T10:45:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 are your linux and windows systems in same workgroup (samba)?
2006-06-18T10:47:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 you can save the password in windows
2006-06-18T10:48:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 did you do System->Administration->Shared Folders?
2006-06-18T10:49:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 well, samba user password is different than regular user. i don't use samba on ubuntu, so am used to doing it manually.

2006-06-18T10:51:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 did you try System->Administration->Shared Folders?

2006-06-18T10:53:00.000Z	bobstro	rjian	 sorry, but i don't use it in ubuntu. smbpasswd is the program though.
