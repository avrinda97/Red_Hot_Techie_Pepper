2012-05-20T18:52:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	there is a problem with 295.40 imo. The nvidia-current-updates package seems much happier.
2012-05-20T18:53:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	i;m not talking about just recent events. i'm talking about what i have seen on this channel in the past 6 years.
2012-05-20T18:55:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	you have opinion. i have 6 years of logs. :)
2012-05-20T18:57:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	Again... I am sure you have ati problems, and intel problems... we use compositing and accelleration for h264 in our project, and nvidia has always worked just dandy... we auto detect and install... and it all works great, except this latest slew... your "opinion" is noted
2012-05-20T19:08:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	like i said, it is opinion based on a very deep experience with Ubuntu users.
2012-05-20T19:09:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	and mine is based on making all of these work without any user interaction at all... on any hardware with any display.
2012-06-29T20:07:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	go edit that paste for XavierCosta. and don't forget that DNS belongs in that file as of 12.04
2012-06-29T20:07:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	then no paste, just a quick typing of 2 lines.
2012-06-29T20:08:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	<XavierCosta> L3top I should write cat   /etc/network/interfaces on command line, right? No eth0 stuff comes bye, just auto lo on first line and then on second line iface lo inet loopback
2012-06-29T20:09:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	then type a paste for XavierCosta to duplicate. far easier than line-by-line on the channel.
2012-06-29T20:11:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	I was unaware 1204 required a DNS
2012-06-29T20:11:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	it can still be set via DHCP, but for static setups /etc/resolv.conf is deprectaed.
2012-06-29T20:17:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	we have purged/installed/--reinstalled... installed the proprietary nvidia driver (a joy in itself as it is currently broken nvidia-173)... gnash, lightspark... everything is right, everything is pointing right... I am at a loss for our friend AssociateX.
2012-06-29T20:19:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	in-release upgrade?
2012-06-29T20:19:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	/ AssociateX:boot to previous kernel?
2012-06-29T20:21:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	He no longer has a previous kernel... did a fresh install
2012-06-29T20:24:00.000Z	L3top	mneptok	lspci does not reveal one.
2012-09-22T07:18:00.000Z	mneptok	L3top	let it go.
