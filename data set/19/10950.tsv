2007-02-03T16:56:00.000Z	lufis		Which ubuntu repo server is fastest? All my downloads from the repos are stuck at 50 kb/s :(
2007-02-03T16:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	the local one...
2007-02-03T16:58:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	I'm using the local one now... it never goes beyond 50-ish kb/s
2007-02-03T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	where do u live?
2007-10-08T08:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	hm, do lsof maybe.
2007-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	what does that do?
2007-10-08T08:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	(l)i(s)t (o)pen (f)iles
2007-10-08T08:40:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	it lists devices as well?
2007-10-08T08:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	device == file
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	what does two equal signs mean? I'm not a math nerd :p
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	type lsof at your terminal, and pastebin what comes out
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	just that, equal
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	Then why didn't you just use an equal sign :p
2007-10-08T08:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	because that means assignment, and ... oh, you're right, sorry
2007-10-08T08:43:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	The text file i outputted lsof to is 500 KB. you SURE you want to read this? ;P
2007-10-08T08:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	DONT PUT THE FILE IN HERE
2007-10-08T08:43:00.000Z	lufis	kbrooks	rofl! Oh my god, i wasn't!
2007-10-08T08:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	lufis	just checking
