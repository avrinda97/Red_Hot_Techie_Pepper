2006-12-23T12:17:00.000Z	Lam_		how can i script a screen session to start up upon boot?
2006-12-23T12:18:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	you can start screen in detached mode from a init script
2006-12-23T12:19:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	sounds like what i'm looking for. how do i go about doing that? i'm trying to load one command in my screen session: rtorrent
2006-12-23T12:19:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	like this: su -c "/usr/bin/screen -d -m command_to_run_in_screen" - username
2006-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	put this line a in a existing init script or write a new one and symlink to it from you default runlevel dir
2006-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	is the su -c necessary? what does it do? and this will load upon boot without the need to log in if i place it in /etc/rc.local, right?
2006-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	su -c ... - username is for running the screen session as non-root
2006-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	ah that's a good idea lol. i'll do that. thanks a lot for the help
2006-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	you can later do   screen -r   as that user
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	so you can watch and control the session
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	ok, great. thanks :)
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	screen just rocks! :)
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	lol yeah definitely
2006-12-23T12:23:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	the finest console tool ever. i use it with my own .screenrc with nice hardstatus bar.
2006-12-23T12:24:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	a hard status bar would be neat. is that a simple command flick in screenrc?
2006-12-23T12:24:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	wait, i'll paste it
2006-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	hardstatus alwayslastline "%?%{wb}%-Lw%?%{Yb}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%?%{wb}%+Lw%?%{wb}%=%c"
2006-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lam_	a bit cryptic, though :)
2006-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	Lam_	POVaddct	lol obviously.  thanks again :)
