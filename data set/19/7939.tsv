2007-05-29T16:25:00.000Z	doc_ido		hi. just upgraded 6.1 => 7.04 had some minor problems but most is OK. However I still have a couple issues : cannot find where to set keyboard layout in console, and cannot get more than one console to run (alt-F1 works, no other ttys are enabled.)
2007-05-29T16:27:00.000Z	doc_ido		y' welcome
2007-05-29T16:27:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	loadkeys <keyboard layout>
2007-05-29T16:28:00.000Z	doc_ido	kitche	thx
2007-05-29T16:28:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	so to use the us layout you would loadkeys us
2007-05-29T16:28:00.000Z	doc_ido	kitche	and to make it permanent ?
2007-05-29T16:29:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	add it to .bashrc
2007-05-29T16:30:00.000Z	doc_ido	kitche	the console settings for bash have changed from dapper to feisty ?
2007-05-29T16:30:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	or you can add it to ~/.profile if you wish also
2007-05-29T16:30:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	but that is just for the command line :) for X you have to edit xorg.conf
2007-05-29T16:31:00.000Z	doc_ido	kitche	yep but it's command line I want to set up
2007-05-29T16:31:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	then edit .bashrc and put loadkeys <keyboard layout>
2007-05-29T16:32:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	bash uses three files for getting it's setup  in the user directory .bashrc .bash_profile and .profile
2007-05-29T16:33:00.000Z	doc_ido	kitche	will add it in /etc/bash.bashrc
2007-05-29T16:49:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	bash
2007-05-29T16:49:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	well bash is the program your looking for
2007-05-29T16:50:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	but check /etc/securetty
2007-05-29T16:52:00.000Z	kitche	doc_ido	ok that shouldn't be the problem then
2007-05-29T16:52:00.000Z	doc_ido	kitche	nope, this is rally weird
