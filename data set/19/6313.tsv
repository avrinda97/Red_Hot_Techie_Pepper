2008-08-24T21:01:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	thanks for the response :) I downloaded an HTML toggle button extension for Thunderbird that is supposed to toggle the HTML editing option for composing messages.  As of right now, as far as I know the button does nothing
2008-08-24T21:03:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	ah.. so thunderbird isn't really broken.. it's the plugin.. anything else you think I should know? (name of the plugin would be a good start)
2008-08-24T21:03:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	it's either the "HTML Toggle" extension or the "Buttons!" extension.  Both of them have a Toggle HTML button, and neither of them currently do anything
2008-08-24T21:04:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	ok.. I'll try installing those.. see what I can find
2008-08-24T21:04:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	thank you :)
2008-08-24T21:06:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	while I'm installing you can try running thunderbird from a terminal.. see if you get any error messages
2008-08-24T21:06:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	no error messages ... I'll restart X, be back in a bit
2008-08-24T21:10:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	I installed Buttons! (version 0.5.3.2) and used customize to get a "HTML!" button.. it doesn't do anything in the main view but when I'm reading a mail I can toggle between html-rendering and text only-rendering just fine
2008-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	I was under the impression that the "HTML!" button is supposed to toggle HTML or plaintext editing mode for composing messages.  The html / text rendering options for reading email do work fine for me
2008-08-24T21:13:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	I can't get a HTML! button in the editor window..
2008-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	same here.  Actually, I just realized something.  The HTML! button does nothing for composing messages... it's only supposed to alter the way messages are viewed

2008-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	yup
2008-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	but there is a menu option for formatting in the edit window
2008-08-24T21:16:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	do you know of a way to toggle HTML in composition?  That's a pretty important feature for me .. The menu option for formatting does not have this toggle
2008-08-24T21:17:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	I feel like a moron.  I just found it under "Options".  Sorry for leading you on a wild goose chase
2008-08-24T21:17:00.000Z	Slart	leeping2008	hehe.. no worries
2008-08-24T21:18:00.000Z	leeping2008	Slart	Thanks :) I think I can use Thunderbird more comfortably now
