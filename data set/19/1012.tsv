2011-07-18T11:02:00.000Z	rahul_		currently I am using ubuntu 11.04, is there any way I can downgrade it to 10.10 without formatting my Hard Disk
2011-07-18T11:03:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Use 10.04 LTS
2011-07-18T11:04:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	In other words, you can't downgrade. Just backup /home/rahul/ and /etc/
2011-07-18T11:05:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	You don't have to -- but it won't hurt. It's only 10MB at most. Your systemwide settings.
2011-07-18T11:06:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	/etc/apt/sources.list (and among many things) are under /etc/ -- Sometimes we make changes and forget to keep them.
2011-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Necessary or not. It's an option. I mean, you don't have to back up your home directory too. -- But you want to. It's up to you.
2011-07-18T11:10:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Wow. Back them up. I generally keep hard drives separated so reinstalling any OS is relatively easy for me. :)
2011-07-18T11:12:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Meanwhile, use 11.04 until you have something in place. I guess. I'd recommend you to use multiple hard drives as to keep OS and 150GB~ data of personal consumption separated. :)
2011-07-18T11:13:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	I use Shiki-Colors Fat.
2011-07-18T11:14:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Flat*

2011-07-18T11:15:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Cool.
2011-07-18T11:17:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Install it in ~/.themes
2011-07-18T11:17:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Just plop it there, really.
2011-07-18T11:17:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	No. Bunch of Shiki folders.
2011-07-18T11:20:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	Dun dun dun. Try other themes. I don't think that's the theme you wanted.
2011-07-18T11:23:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	I use compiz. Unsure about metacity. You should do this -- "sudo apt-get install gnome-colors" for icons.
2011-07-18T11:27:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	I'm not using Ubuntu -- but I'm using Gnome.
2011-07-18T11:27:00.000Z	Lasers	rahul_	I like giving out candies and supports.
