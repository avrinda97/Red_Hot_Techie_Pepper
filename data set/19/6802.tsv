2007-12-05T07:06:00.000Z	ejt		hello
2007-12-05T07:07:00.000Z	ejt		I have found an issue in the command line expansion in Makefiles... it appears to only occur in Ubuntu (out of Fedora or OS X, which all use the same GNU Make 3.81)
2007-12-05T07:08:00.000Z	ejt		I at first blamed bash, but the Fedora bash is older than 7.04, which is older than OS X 10.5, which is older than 7.10
2007-12-05T07:08:00.000Z	ejt		so the only consistent thing is Ubuntu, unless bash broke, fixed, and then broke again
2007-12-05T07:09:00.000Z	ejt		figured I'd check here if anyone wants to try a 3 line Makefile...
2007-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	ejt		oh the other weird thing is the expansion works properly on the command line itself...
2007-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	ejt		it seems to only break in Ubuntu, within a Makefile
2007-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	can you post in pastebin a test file with your expansion and the behavior on different systems?
2007-12-05T07:13:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	at the top of your not working makefile can you set "SHELL = /bin/bash" and also try with "SHELL = /bin/sh"?
2007-12-05T07:14:00.000Z	ejt	kelsin	here's what I was doing: http://pastebin.com/m33204849
2007-12-05T07:15:00.000Z	ejt	kelsin	ahh, yes, it works with SHELL=/bin/bash at the top
2007-12-05T07:15:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	ubuntu uses dash for /bin/sh, it's posix compliant
2007-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	so now you know that technically that syntax isn't posix :) but you can override the shell with SHELL obviously, glad that fix was easy lol
2007-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	ejt	kelsin	hmm, so what of the expansion? is {h,cc} not posix compliant?
2007-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	ejt	kelsin	(or is it just a bug in dash)
2007-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	yeah, if you run "/bin/sh -c 'ls file.{1,2}'" it will also complain
2007-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	I'm not 100% but my best guess is that {} isn't in posix
2007-12-05T07:17:00.000Z	kelsin	ejt	a lot of normal bash stuff isn't
2007-12-05T07:17:00.000Z	ejt	kelsin	wow, alrighty then, that's a new one for me, thanks!
