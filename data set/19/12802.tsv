2006-01-29T06:10:00.000Z	i3dmaster		The volumn control on the panel is showing a red x when I click it, it says either I don't have right GStreamer plugins installed or I don't have sound card configured. Anyone knows how to remedy this?
2006-01-29T06:11:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	try what ubotu suggested
2006-01-29T06:11:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	ubotu: ok, let me take a look of that.. thanks!
2006-05-01T15:26:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	in kde you just right click it, can't you do the same in gnome?
2006-05-01T15:27:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	I can change, but the there is only a close button, after close, the name didn't get changed
2006-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	I don't know. it sounds a bit broken then
2006-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	I think it is
2006-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	I was trying to see if anyone knows if the gnome-cups-manager reads any conf file so I can just edit the conf file and change the names instead of going to GUI
2006-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	Well I believe you can edit the cups conf files by hand
2006-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	edited printers.conf but when I open gnome-cups-manager, it still using those old names
2006-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	that sounds odd
2006-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	very
2006-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	does it update if you restart cupsys?
2006-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart
2006-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	I can try
2006-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	no unfortunately
2006-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	mwe	i3dmaster	I don't think I can help then. maybe someone else ...
2006-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	haha.. you know what, I changed from the KDE printer manager.
2006-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mwe	I think the gnome one is just broken
