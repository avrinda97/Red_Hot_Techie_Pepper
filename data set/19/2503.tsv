2010-03-17T14:10:00.000Z	abracadab		Ubuntu is running slowly here - requesting links to good docs on speeding up Ubuntu. Thanks
2010-03-17T14:11:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	look at top what is eating the cpu/ram
2010-03-17T14:14:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	'top' apps are xorg, firefox, metacity, pidgen, gnome-terminal. Total CPU used fluctuates between 5% and 30%.
2010-03-17T14:15:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	and ram?
2010-03-17T14:16:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	1GB, I think. What command will verify that?
2010-03-17T14:16:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	top
2010-03-17T14:16:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	or free -m
2010-03-17T14:17:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	top says 1GB total, 6.5 MB used.
2010-03-17T14:17:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	please paste the output of free -m to pastebin
2010-03-17T14:18:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	pastebin?
2010-03-17T14:20:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	http://paste.ubuntu.com/396626/
2010-03-17T14:20:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	looks good, no problem with ram
2010-03-17T14:22:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	thanks. any other suggestions or pointers to docs for speed boosts? (other than: "buy a faster machine"). ;)
2010-03-17T14:23:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	disable compiz (the desktop effects) check the speed of the hdd (hdparm)
2010-03-17T14:23:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	look if "w" in top is high (which is (w)aiting for the io-devices)
2010-03-17T14:36:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	re, disabling compiz: System > Preferences > Visual Effects are set to "None". Is there more to disabling compiz than that?
2010-03-17T14:46:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	thats all
2010-03-17T14:46:00.000Z	iceroot	abracadab	maybe you are on jaunty with an intel card?
2010-03-17T16:19:00.000Z	abracadab	iceroot	Yes, I'm on Jaunty with an Intel card! What kind of difference does that make?
