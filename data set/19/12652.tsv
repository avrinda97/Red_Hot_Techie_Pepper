2005-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	_ryan		if anyone could advice me on this seemingly simple error (on my part), it would be much appreciated. I uploaded the text to a webpage so I don't clutter the channel: http://www.freewebs.com/ryanazar/please_help.html
2005-07-28T12:24:00.000Z	_ryan		if anyone can suggest a place for me to go to get help, i would be happy to go elsewhere.
2005-07-28T12:25:00.000Z	_ryan		i do not want to disturb others, i just need help for my question :X
2005-07-28T12:26:00.000Z	_ryan		i am guessing this isn't the place to get help, I appologize.
2005-07-28T12:26:00.000Z	_ryan		talk to yall later
2005-07-28T12:26:00.000Z	_ryan		it is? :X
2005-07-28T12:26:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	what is your question?
2005-07-28T12:27:00.000Z	_ryan	La_PaRCa	I am trying to compile a simple program and gcc is giving me a few errors, i set up a small log showing what gcc spit out and what command i used here: http://www.freewebs.com/ryanazar/please_help.html
2005-07-28T12:28:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	ok. That is helpful.
2005-07-28T12:28:00.000Z	_ryan	La_PaRCa	thanks for taking the time ( :
2005-07-28T12:32:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	haha... libx11-dev is the way to go
2005-07-28T12:32:00.000Z	_ryan	La_PaRCa	but i have the header files in the folder, is that not correct?
2005-07-28T12:34:00.000Z	_ryan	La_PaRCa	in addition, i just checked synaptic and it says libx11-dev is installed.
2005-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	however, you are calling X11/Xlib.h
2005-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	and the header file is in the same folder as what you are compiling
2005-07-28T12:36:00.000Z	_ryan	La_PaRCa	they are copies. i put them in there because i kept getting that error when i tried to build. the real files are in /usr/X11R6/include/X11/
2005-07-28T12:37:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	I am not sure then. You'll have to ask someone that knows a little more about c
2005-07-28T12:37:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	_ryan	and ubuntu and X programming
2005-07-28T12:37:00.000Z	_ryan	La_PaRCa	thankyou for you're time :-D
