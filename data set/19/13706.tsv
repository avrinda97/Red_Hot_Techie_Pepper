2005-07-18T07:34:00.000Z	mebaran151		it looks like a pretty powerful language
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		yeah
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		Java I dont like
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		but I know it can be used
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		I am thinking of developing in C#
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		and hooking it all up with ruby
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		ok
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		but C# is open souurce
2005-07-18T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		I think
2005-07-18T07:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		the Mon project lets me check out code!
2005-07-18T07:36:00.000Z	pgavin	mebaran151	uhh, not really, there is an open source implementation, tho
2005-07-18T07:36:00.000Z	mebaran151	pgavin	that is like saying UNIX is not open source right now, but FreeBSD is an open source implementation
2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	pgavin	mebaran151	well, the only C# reference implementation is closed source
2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	pgavin	mebaran151	but there are multiple open source implementations of unix that can be used as a reference
2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	pgavin	mebaran151	well, sure, after its mature, but its not right now
2005-07-18T07:39:00.000Z	pgavin	mebaran151	plus, C# has lots of windows specific details which would have to be emulated in mono
2005-07-18T07:39:00.000Z	mebaran151	pgavin	eh that is true
2005-07-18T07:42:00.000Z	pgavin	mebaran151	well, both are turing complete :)
2005-07-18T07:42:00.000Z	mebaran151	pgavin	yep both are turing complete
