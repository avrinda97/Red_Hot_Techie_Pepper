2011-08-08T03:04:00.000Z	goddard		my BitTorrent keeps crashing my internet connection
2011-08-08T03:04:00.000Z	escott	goddard	could be your routers nat connection tracking failing
2011-08-08T03:06:00.000Z	goddard	escott	ill give that a test if it happens a again
2011-08-14T00:11:00.000Z	escott	goddard	software installed manually and not through apt
2011-08-14T00:11:00.000Z	goddard	escott	ahh thanks
2011-11-07T04:13:00.000Z	escott	goddard	have you used the -v argument to get the cause
2011-11-07T04:14:00.000Z	goddard	escott	it attempts to connect with both key types but doesn't say it fails
2011-11-07T04:16:00.000Z	escott	goddard	if its not in debug1 try -vv to see debug2 you should get a message that it was refused/invalid
2011-11-07T04:16:00.000Z	escott	goddard	since your key is being sent its likely on the server side. check the permissions of your auth keys file
2011-11-07T04:18:00.000Z	goddard	escott	http://fpaste.org/waie/
2011-11-07T04:22:00.000Z	escott	goddard	you can keep throwing more v's at it but its probably on the server side
2012-11-20T04:36:00.000Z	escott	goddard	yes
2012-11-20T04:36:00.000Z	escott	goddard	AES is not asymmetric
2012-11-20T04:37:00.000Z	goddard	escott	what is?
2012-11-20T04:38:00.000Z	escott	goddard	AES is a symmetric cipher. assymetric ciphers are provided by pgp/gpg and use large primes or ECC
2012-11-20T04:38:00.000Z	escott	goddard	so RSA, DSA, and ECC
2012-11-20T04:38:00.000Z	goddard	escott	ahh ok
2012-11-20T04:39:00.000Z	escott	goddard	if you "gpg --help" the asymmetric ones are listed under pubkey, ciphers are symmetric
2012-11-20T04:41:00.000Z	goddard	escott	rockin dude thanks
