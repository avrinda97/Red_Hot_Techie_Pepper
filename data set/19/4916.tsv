2009-03-19T18:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	did you change your /etc/pulseaudio/daemon.conf, especially the default-sample-channels = 2 line ? it'l have to be set to 6 instead of 2 for a 5.1 system
2009-03-19T18:51:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	yes i have done that, and the 5 speakers are working but the subwoofer
2009-03-19T18:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	i see .... that was my 2 cents contribution i'm afraid, i'd try to rule out subwoofer hardware failure first by hooking it up to another system/OS
2009-03-19T18:56:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	it works on windows and because of the upmix: if i unplug the subwoofer cable i can hear the subwoofer, so it lays on pulseaudio
2009-03-19T19:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=795525 might have some helpful insights to try and configure pulseaudio for your exact setup
2009-03-19T19:03:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	i tried both methods
2009-03-19T19:05:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	i just installed pavumeter and cheked if there is any output on the subwoofer: there is no!
2009-03-19T19:08:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	is pavucontrol showing the subwoofer channel as muted perhaps ?
2009-03-19T19:08:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	no
2009-03-19T19:09:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	but if i look on the alsa-sink arguments there is set subwoofer and not lfe, in alsamixer stands lfe
2009-03-19T19:10:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	you might be on to something there i guess, at least worth a try changing that
2009-03-19T19:11:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	how do i change that
2009-03-19T19:13:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	/etc/pulse/default.pa is the best spot to experiment with different sinks etc. imho
2009-03-19T19:18:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	it doesn't work anyway
2009-03-19T19:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	too bad, running out of ideas i'm afraid
2009-03-19T19:51:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	but it's funny, if i  have a sound file with true 5.1, so with a subwoofer ouztput channel it works, so it seams that i have to set the upmix for the subwoofer manually on
2009-03-19T19:53:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	changed and guess what: it works, so it seems that in the new version lfe remixing is disabled by default
2009-03-19T19:53:00.000Z	krzd	glitsj16	however: thx fo the nice support ;-)
2009-03-19T19:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	krzd	nice that's settled, enjoy the sounds ;)
