2006-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	uber_spaced		every once in a while, something weird happens on my ubuntu install where I cant ping localhost
2006-01-03T11:12:00.000Z	uber_spaced		i ran an /sbin/ifconfig and it showed that my external interface had no IP address, so I ran /etc/init.d/network restart, and now it does have an address, but I still cant ping localhost.
2006-01-03T11:13:00.000Z	uber_spaced		whenever this happens, rebooting seems to fix it, but I dont want to reboot to fix the issue.
2006-01-03T11:13:00.000Z	radaway	uber_spaced	do you have "127.0.0.1    localhost"in your /etc/hosts file?
2006-01-03T11:14:00.000Z	uber_spaced	radaway	yeppers.
2006-01-03T11:14:00.000Z	radaway	uber_spaced	odd maybe it's udev eating your loop device
2006-01-03T11:15:00.000Z	uber_spaced	radaway	well, it's not in there exactly how you've written it; it's like:
2006-01-03T11:15:00.000Z	uber_spaced		127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost myhost
2006-01-03T11:17:00.000Z	radaway	uber_spaced	that should work
2006-01-03T11:17:00.000Z	uber_spaced	radaway	it's resolving to 127.0.0.1;
2006-01-03T11:17:00.000Z	radaway	uber_spaced	yeah that's you
2006-01-03T11:17:00.000Z	uber_spaced		I have apache running and when I do a netstat -tcp, things dont get past SYN_SENT
2006-01-03T11:18:00.000Z	radaway	uber_spaced	127.0.0.1 always points to the computer you are running
2006-01-03T11:18:00.000Z	uber_spaced	radaway	yes, I know.
2006-01-03T11:30:00.000Z	uber_spaced	radaway	when you said ' odd maybe it's udev eating your loop device', I think you may have been on to something
2006-01-03T11:31:00.000Z	uber_spaced		I can refer to my machine with my IP address, but not localhos or 127.0.0.1
2006-01-03T11:31:00.000Z	uber_spaced		my lo looks like it's borkded.
2006-01-03T11:31:00.000Z	uber_spaced		is there a way to fix that?
2006-01-03T11:31:00.000Z	radaway	uber_spaced	yeah I think that's what is happenning sadly my expertise are not enough to help you with that :/ maybe update your udev or kernel
