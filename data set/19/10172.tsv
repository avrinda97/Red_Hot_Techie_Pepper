2006-08-06T15:29:00.000Z	tabman		how can i copy multiple files with one statement ?
2006-08-06T15:29:00.000Z	tabman		as in cp file1 file2
2006-08-06T15:29:00.000Z	tabman		what if I have 3 files to copy
2006-08-06T15:30:00.000Z	tabman		anyone ?
2006-08-06T15:31:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	cp file1 file2 ... file_n destination
2006-08-06T15:32:00.000Z	tabman	RAOF	no commas in between ?
2006-08-06T15:32:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	no
2006-08-06T15:32:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	that's what "cp * /to/here" expands to
2006-08-06T15:32:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	"cp <list of files separated by spaces> /to/here" :)
2006-08-06T15:36:00.000Z	tabman	RAOF	when I copied my files to the new directory, the new directory shows those files with a lock on them ?
2006-08-06T15:37:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	The files will generally retain the same permissions.  The "lock" indicates that you don't have write permissions.  Did you copy from somewhere you didn't have write permissions to (like a CD :))
2006-08-06T15:38:00.000Z	tabman	RAOF	they did not have earlier in the old folder ?
2006-08-06T15:40:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	Odd.  Did you have to use "sudo" to copy them, or anything?  Were you copying to somewhere your user doesn't have write permissions? (Like anywhere outside /home/username)
2006-08-06T15:42:00.000Z	tabman	RAOF	i used sudo
2006-08-06T15:42:00.000Z	tabman	RAOF	yes its an outside location but the old & new location are on the same drive
2006-08-06T15:44:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	Ok, so the files are somewhere you didn't have write access to, so you still don't have write access.
2006-08-06T15:44:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	If you really want write access, you could "sudo chmod +w /path/to/file(s)"
2006-08-06T15:45:00.000Z	RAOF	tabman	But that's probably the wrong solution.  Pretty much anything you want to (routinely) write to should be in your home directory, anyway.
2006-08-06T15:47:00.000Z	tabman	RAOF	right
