2009-05-12T00:46:00.000Z	the1corrupted		Hey, anyone know how to configure an AMP installation to work?  So far, I can't get PHP to work...
2009-05-12T00:47:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	What's not working, exactly?
2009-05-12T00:47:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	When I open a php page, firefox comes up and says "PHTML File, what do you want to do?  --Open With, --Save As"
2009-05-12T00:48:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	Apache itself is working fine, though?
2009-05-12T00:48:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	Yup.
2009-05-12T00:59:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	So do you know what might be wrong?
2009-05-12T01:00:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	.php extension? Did you specify in apache.conf to serve php files?
2009-05-12T01:00:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	Yeah, .php ext.  But how do I setup the apache.conf to serve php files?
2009-05-12T01:10:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	check that you have php5.conf in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2009-05-12T01:10:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	You should have a line: AddType application/x-httpd-php  .php .phtml
2009-05-12T01:13:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	But it's already on there..
2009-05-12T01:15:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	Have you tried restarting Apache? Anything in Apache logs?
2009-05-12T01:16:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	What is the output of a2enmod php5?
2009-05-12T01:17:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	It says AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3  And how do I go about restarting apache?
2009-05-12T01:18:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2009-05-12T01:19:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	IT said something about unable to reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name...
2009-05-12T01:19:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	That's fine, don't worry about that
2009-05-12T01:31:00.000Z	Celauran	the1corrupted	According to everything I've read, if your PHP files are still prompting a download, you may need to purge and resintall libapache2-mod-php5
2009-05-12T01:32:00.000Z	the1corrupted	Celauran	Nah, it was fixed by assigning ServerName to "localhost"
