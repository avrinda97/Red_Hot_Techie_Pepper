2007-01-13T07:09:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu		ok - i bit the bullet and installed ubuntu onto my abit be6ii system - installled fine - found the sound card, nvisia card etc etc - but its ignored the HPT370 drives and second drive - i can see it in Device manager - and seem to be recognised properly there - but the "desktop" and filebrowser doesnt recognise it... baring in mind i'm a noob so dont laugh!
2007-01-13T07:09:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu		hey I installed the nvisia drivers ok using automatix :P
2007-01-13T07:10:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	does this command list the drives --  fdisk -l
2007-01-13T07:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	address me so i know you have replied or your posts will get lost in this busy channel :)
2007-01-13T07:13:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	i get no output with fdisk -l
2007-01-13T07:13:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	errm, try  -- sudo fdisk -l
2007-01-13T07:14:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	i get "invalid option -l"
2007-01-13T07:15:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	hmm maybe this -- sudo sh -c "fdisk -l"
2007-01-13T07:17:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	ok - i got output! my error - i get lots of /dev/** stuff - all sizes seem correct for the drives (even recognises the raided drive as 80gb (well 78gb) )
2007-01-13T07:21:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	ok - i got output! my error - i get lots of /dev/** stuff
2007-01-13T07:23:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	can you !pastebin the output of that command please?
2007-01-13T07:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	stop
2007-01-13T07:26:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1386/
2007-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	 my output from sudo fdisk -l http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1386/
2007-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	errm, ok -- one drive seems to be detected but has a bad partition table /dev/hdf -- another /dev/hde contains an SFS partition which i am not sure can be read from linux -- so thats two drives that are accounted for
2007-01-13T07:31:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	the hde and hdf *were* part of a RAID0 in windows - two 40Gb joined to make 80gb
2007-01-13T07:32:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	it was purely data in NTFS - be nice if i could mount it somehow and then read the data - but no biggy
2007-01-13T07:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	Dave-Ubuntu	well, in either case -- if you want to use these drives, you'll need to repartition and reformat them again -- as for the NTFS drive /dev/hdb ..it should be readable and writable ok
2007-01-13T07:33:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	un_operateur	ok - which brings me to my question - how do i get Ubuntu to "see" them ?
