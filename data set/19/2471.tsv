2010-03-31T09:55:00.000Z	eremite		I only have 1 VGA port in the back of my computer.  Is it possibel to have dual monitors without buying a new graphics card, or can I use a splitter of some sort?
2010-03-31T09:56:00.000Z	runarfreyr	eremite	with just one vga. Sadly no. Splitter would just split the same image to two monitors
2010-03-31T09:57:00.000Z	runarfreyr		Same thing myron, any other way I can get this log o you?
2010-03-31T09:57:00.000Z	runarfreyr		Thanks in advance
