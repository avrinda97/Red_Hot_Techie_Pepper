2009-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	ibkanat		I want to upgrade my kernel is this the easiest way? http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2009-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	ibkanat		it fails on inserting my nvidia and vbox modules
2009-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	ibkanat		anyone know?
2009-12-22T09:12:00.000Z	ibkanat		vbox performance on guest is terrible I improved it with a build but read that upgrade fixes
2009-12-22T09:13:00.000Z	ibkanat		I would like 2.6.33
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ibkanat		http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/drm-next/current/
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ibkanat		?
2009-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	ibkanat		what are the drm and drm-next?
2009-12-22T09:16:00.000Z	ibkanat		is there another safe place to look for recent kernels?
2009-12-22T09:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	a later kernel why?  it's useually best to stay with kernels from the Ubuntu repo
2009-12-22T09:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	there is probably a ppa for a later kernel, but why do you want one?
2009-12-22T09:17:00.000Z	ibkanat	sebsebseb	performance in vbox is horid in the karmic kernels
2009-12-22T09:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	that's probably more to do with your graphics card and RAM
2009-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	ibkanat	sebsebseb	no its a known bug that kernel upgrade fixes
2009-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	ok well look for a ppa for a later kernel then
2009-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	there is probably something on launchpad
2009-12-22T09:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	uhmm   Ubuntu 9.10  kernel ppa  on Google or something like that, will bring one up I guess
2009-12-22T09:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	launchpad is the trusted source for ppa's
2009-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ibkanat	found a ppa by using the key words I suggested or something similar?
