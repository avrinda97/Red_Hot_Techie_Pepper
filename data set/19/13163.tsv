2007-02-16T10:10:00.000Z	khronus		have since confirmed checksums and burnt using recommended burning software and it still fails the defect check
2007-02-16T10:10:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	run @ slow speed such as 2x AND md5sum check
2007-02-16T10:11:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	sorry for the lag; anyhow, try to install with acpi disabled
2007-02-16T10:13:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	at the boot, add noacpi to the boot command
2007-02-16T10:15:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	just tap the space bar and it'll stop the clock, then you can add option to the boot command ... i don't remember what it says (been a long time)
2007-02-16T10:17:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	yes. that's it. hit F6, then add option (noacpi)
2007-02-16T10:21:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	without
2007-02-16T10:36:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	you can try this one, acpi=off, also
2007-02-16T10:37:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	fwiw, i have one laptop that gave me a hard time, such as install stops @ 28%, so i issued a command with acpi=off and it went all the way.
2007-02-16T10:39:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	interesting. maybe that IS the problem.
2007-02-16T10:40:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	you can check it out @ launchpad
2007-02-16T10:41:00.000Z	IcemanV9	khronus	bug reports site for ubuntu
