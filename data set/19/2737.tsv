2010-02-02T10:33:00.000Z	Santisnight		I'm having a rather serious audio issue. It seems that the audio is suddenly slowed down, and the pitch drops horridly. I have no clue whats going on, it used to ahppen for short periods of time, but now it seems to stick around. I have yet to restart to see if that would just reset it, but i know that will not permanently fix the issue. any suggestions?
2010-02-02T10:33:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	killall pulseaudio
2010-02-02T10:35:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 cool, now is this a permanent fix? or if the issue occurs again is there something i can do to stop it for good?
2010-02-02T10:36:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	not sure.. sound is a funny thing.. there's lots going on there.. pulseaudio is the sound server and proper operation depends on the sound card, driver, and pulseaudio which is still under heavy development
2010-02-02T10:37:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	could have been something you ran that got stuck.. so to speak
2010-02-02T10:37:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 but if it occurs again, just killall ? (im glad that it's the drivers because i allready lost my right speaker
2010-02-02T10:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	yep..
2010-02-02T10:38:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 by the by, you wouldn't happen to know how to switch the sound so it will work off of mono on my leftover left speaker?
2010-02-02T10:40:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	if you double click the little speaker icon up by the clock you'll get the mixer.. there may be an option there to move all the sound to one side or even toggle it into mono mode.
2010-02-02T10:42:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 well I've done the 'all on the left' option, but certain songs are stereo (meaning i only get half the song played if i only have one speaker) i wanna be able to hear both halves on one, if thats possible without screwing with the song itself.
2010-02-02T10:42:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 and the 'mono' options i tried completly muted me.
2010-02-02T10:43:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	try unplugging and plugging in the connection to the speakers a few times just to check for a bad connection
2010-02-02T10:44:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 with it on mono?
2010-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	no stereo to see if it work
2010-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 uhm... Ok, fairly certain that wouldn't matter in the 'half songs' situation...
2010-02-02T10:53:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	 As i had suspected, no dice with the unplug.plug the speaker connection. did i mention i only have the left speaker?  the right one broke :T
2010-02-02T10:54:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	you didn't mention that specifically.. DOH! .. time for new speakers..
2010-02-02T10:54:00.000Z	scunizi	Santisnight	gotta run.. good luck..
2010-02-02T10:55:00.000Z	Santisnight	scunizi	k
