2007-11-18T10:11:00.000Z	vasilisa		 ~help~ :  I just reinstalled everything on this SATA, and im having a major partition crisis. My data partition (seperate from system) is 170 gigs. 110 gigs are in use... and 6 gigs are free? Thats not all. Gparted and parted in general freeze on startup. And what is this:::  Invalid argument while trying to resize /dev/sda1
2007-11-18T10:12:00.000Z	vasilisa		So what, no one can help me?
2007-11-18T10:13:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	pastebin the output of df -h
2007-11-18T10:14:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	uh oh... hold on, it didnt want to mount back on
2007-11-18T10:15:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	bad superblock on /dev/sda1,
2007-11-18T10:16:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	what filesystem is /dev/sda1?
2007-11-18T10:16:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	it was ext3, i removed the journal to try to resize it, but that didnt work either..... fstab must not work.
2007-11-18T10:17:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	fstab has nothing to do with an unmounted filesystem, sounds like you have filesystem errors
2007-11-18T10:18:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	Here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/44977/
2007-11-18T10:18:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	i might add now that while resizing the partition on the live cd before i started all this, i thought it locked up and canceled the process c.c
2007-11-18T10:19:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	then it's probably completely trashed, delete it and create a new one
2007-11-18T10:19:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	yeah, that'll be easy with 120 gigs of files
2007-11-18T10:19:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	don't know what to tell you, filesystem resizing is one of those things you CANNOT have interrupted, it's trashed
2007-11-18T10:20:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	I never do partition operations without backups :/
2007-11-18T10:20:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	I have backups. Anyway the files are accessable.
2007-11-18T10:20:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	its just annoying. Backups... i mean, we're talking about gigs and gigs.
2007-11-18T10:21:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	Well thanks... i may have a cheat for this anyway
2007-11-18T10:22:00.000Z	astro76	vasilisa	I have little sympathy for all the people who don't want to backup their 100s of gigs of pirated media before doing destructive operations.... anyway your first stop should be a fsck
2007-11-18T10:24:00.000Z	vasilisa	astro76	Actually its largely po..... yeah, aquired media. I tried fsck... meh, ill just use the other partition since xp wasnt installing anyway
