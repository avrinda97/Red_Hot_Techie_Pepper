2009-04-26T09:18:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	none of the settings are in .gdm/
2009-04-26T09:18:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	learn something new every day.
2009-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	it's where you install linux inside a linux filesystem which lives in a single large NTFS file
2009-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	sorta like colinux.  I'm trying to remember exactly what they called those.
2009-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	called what?
2009-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	how is the linux Run?  loadlin?
2009-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	or is it virtualized?
2009-04-26T09:23:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	when I boot, I get the windows bootloader menu, with 'XP' or 'Ubuntu'.  if I pick Ubuntu, I get the grub menu.  I don't know any more about it.
2009-04-26T09:24:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	it doesn't run inside windows - windows doesn't boot when I run ubuntu even though it's a wubi install.  I imagine just an NTFS driver runs to allow access to the linux fs
2009-04-26T09:25:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	kind of like the old loadlin for the FAT32 on win98.  they call it a looplinux install.
2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	sounds about right
2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	I find myself running windows a lot of the time because I boot and go do something else while it boots, and it always defaults to windows
2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	yeah, I could do that.  In fact, you can do that from windows pretty easily.  Assuming you are speaking of WinXP.  Vista shouldn't be much harder.
2009-04-26T09:27:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	mentioned a wubi install and that it uses the windows boot loader.
2009-04-26T09:27:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	edit the boot.ini file.
2009-04-26T09:28:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	C:\boot.ini   You can change the default there.
2009-04-26T09:28:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	I'm a windows geek.  Moved to linux in recent years. :)
2009-04-26T09:29:00.000Z	uncmar	dooglus	PM.
2009-04-26T09:29:00.000Z	dooglus	uncmar	I don't have one - are you registered?
