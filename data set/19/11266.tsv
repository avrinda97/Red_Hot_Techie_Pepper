2006-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	UNH2LY		i installed qemu and got windows rolling
2006-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	UNH2LY		and that identified it as a cirrus logic card
2006-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	UNH2LY		and i tried installing xserver-xorg....-cirrus
2006-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	UNH2LY		but i my video still runs horribly
2006-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	UNH2LY		like, i cant get over 10 fps on most screensavers
2006-05-24T11:47:00.000Z	UNH2LY		and im running 1024x768
2006-05-24T11:48:00.000Z	UNH2LY		it seems that ive already installed the package, but it seems that its not set/activated
2006-05-24T11:49:00.000Z	UNH2LY		oh no, x runs, but its graphically slow
2006-05-24T11:49:00.000Z	UNH2LY		not nearly as quick as it should be
2006-05-24T11:49:00.000Z	UNH2LY		like screensavers and whanot
2006-05-24T11:50:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	it probably isn't using your graphics card then
2006-05-24T11:55:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-05-24T11:56:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	use the pastebin
2006-05-24T11:57:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	there's also the option of using a lighter-weight window manager
2006-05-24T11:59:00.000Z	UNH2LY	xanavim	this should have everything to do with video in it...
2006-05-24T12:02:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	it doesn't look like there is a driver for your card built-in to Ubuntu, but you could try getting one from the vendor and you could also try 16-bit color
2006-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	your X is using vesa, which is a generic video card driver
2006-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	UNH2LY	xanavim	how do i tell what video driver is in here... windows in qemu said cirrus logic
2006-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	xanavim	UNH2LY	I don't remember
