2007-05-22T12:08:00.000Z	mirra		can someone help me with a mysql question (#mysql is dead)
2007-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	mirra		here goes
2007-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	mirra		is there a way to setup replication using a single instance of mysql? basically have two db's - one of them just replicating the other?
2007-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	mirra		if not..can someone help me install two instances of mysql on ubuntu??
2007-05-22T12:10:00.000Z	noiesmo	mirra	you could use rsync for that on a cron job
2007-05-22T12:10:00.000Z	mirra	noiesmo	can't..its an active db and the tables cannot be locked on the main one
2007-05-22T12:11:00.000Z	mirra	noiesmo	can you help with either of those issues?
2007-05-22T12:11:00.000Z	noiesmo	mirra	I once had co that had server in usa and the database was rsync'd with a local one every 15 minutes
2007-05-22T12:12:00.000Z	mirra	noiesmo	i was told that unless the tables are locked..any method like that won't ensure a reliable backup
2007-05-22T12:13:00.000Z	noiesmo	mirra	not sure about the lock'd bit sorry.
2007-05-22T12:13:00.000Z	mirra	noiesmo	can you help with either issue
2007-05-22T12:13:00.000Z	mirra	noiesmo	can replication be done with only one mysql instance?
2007-05-22T12:16:00.000Z	noiesmo	mirra	sorry not sure I know we use to just rsync between two boxes then when the usa on broke we just copied the most recent sync back to usa and off we went again
2007-05-22T12:16:00.000Z	mirra		for an active web site/
2007-05-22T12:18:00.000Z	noiesmo	mirra	yes active web site with online store the sysnc was set to run every 3 minutes from usa to local back up so there would be possible 3 minutes loss of info hope that helps
2007-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	mirra		no..thanks though
2007-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	mirra		the data needs to be locked
2007-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	mirra		with that method
