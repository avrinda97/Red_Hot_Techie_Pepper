2008-09-03T06:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	dunno, i use that version fo madwifi quite successfullly
2008-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	look in the folder(that resulst when you extract the tar file), and see if it has any contents..
2008-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	yes
2008-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	did you look at the contents?
2008-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	ys, you downloaded an empty file.
2008-09-03T06:45:00.000Z	BunTai	IndyGunFreak	: can u give a url for madwifi download?
2008-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	did you see the message i sent you?
2008-09-03T07:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	you need to use ndiswrapper, since you're using 64bit.
2008-09-03T07:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	that link you had had 64bit instructions.
2008-09-03T07:45:00.000Z	BunTai	IndyGunFreak	: should i uninstall madwifi
2008-09-03T07:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	you can, but i don't think it will matter one way or the other
2008-09-03T08:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BunTai	sudo kwrite /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
