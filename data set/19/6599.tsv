2008-10-12T22:47:00.000Z	carrera		I'm building a server for work
2008-10-12T22:47:00.000Z	carrera		I'm trying to decide between RH Enterprise and Ubuntu Server
2008-10-12T22:47:00.000Z	carrera		any thoughts?
2008-10-12T22:48:00.000Z	carrera		i'm getting RH Ent for free too
2008-10-12T22:48:00.000Z	carrera		here's a problem I have
2008-10-12T22:49:00.000Z	carrera		the cost?
2008-10-12T22:49:00.000Z	carrera		ok
2008-10-12T22:49:00.000Z	carrera		I'd like to use Ubuntu Server but it doesn't have gui
2008-10-12T22:50:00.000Z	carrera		but I'm on an extremely chuppy 128 Kb/s adsl
2008-10-12T22:50:00.000Z	carrera		I usually build my own LAMP anyway
2008-10-12T22:52:00.000Z	gord_	carrera	I've actually never required http or php, I usually just run ftpd and samba/swat and nfs for my linux clients
2008-10-12T22:52:00.000Z	carrera	gord_	I need to set up a wiki for our production unit
2008-10-12T22:53:00.000Z	gord_	carrera	In that case apache may be a good choice
2008-10-12T22:58:00.000Z	carrera	gord_	ikonia, actually I do have 4 GB of RAM on two modules now and I'm thinking of upgrading to 8
2008-10-12T22:59:00.000Z	gord_	carrera	go 64
2008-10-13T00:05:00.000Z	gord_	carrera	if you're on 32 bit you cant simply download the 64 bit, you need to download an image... which you can do through commandline using wget or rtorrent with wget to grab a .torrent first
2008-10-13T00:05:00.000Z	carrera	gord_	thanks I was looking for the command
2008-10-13T00:07:00.000Z	carrera	gord_	it's 11 pm over here and no one has access to that server
2008-10-13T00:10:00.000Z	gord_	carrera	it would probably be faster to download a torrent. 'rtorrent' is an excellent commandline torrent program, run it in a screen and you're set
