2010-05-29T05:49:00.000Z	Astroe		Hey, can anybody help me out? I am new to Ubuntu
2010-05-29T05:49:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	Hi :) What do you need?
2010-05-29T05:52:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	You'll need to boot from the Live CD and then use GParted
2010-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	Won't that mess up how it boots up? I read that windows does the booting since it was installed first..
2010-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	Are you using just GRUB? or the windows bootloader starts grub first?
2010-05-29T05:54:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	The windows bootloader runs grub.
2010-05-29T05:56:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	you could delete windows with gparted, resize the partition, and just in case, reinstall grub
2010-05-29T05:57:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	See, that sounds like it might work. But I don't know how to install Grub
2010-05-29T05:57:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	neither do I, but let's check what google says :D
2010-05-29T05:57:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	lol sounds like a plan
2010-05-29T05:59:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	OR! if you have little stuff in ubuntu… just do a fresh install :)
2010-05-29T05:59:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	I wanted to do that but the only reason I started by dual booting was so I could save the hundred gigs or so of media I had in windows.
2010-05-29T06:02:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	wait… you have data on your windows partition? if it's like that, you won't want to remove the partition with gparted :O
2010-05-29T06:03:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	I transferred all the important stuff over to Ubuntu already.
2010-05-29T06:04:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	Now I just need to delete the Windows partiton so I can use my whole drive for ubuntu
2010-05-29T06:06:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	just an idea: fresh install on the windows partition, so it automatically fixes bootloader stuff, and correctly installs grub, then move stuff, delete old linux partition, merge
2010-05-29T06:07:00.000Z	NinoScript	Astroe	I think it would take more time, but less effort
2010-05-29T06:07:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	Ugh, that sound like a lot of work. I've already migrated all the files. It took three hours. I think I'm just gonna try reinstalling the grub from the live CD. I'll let ya know how it goes :p
2010-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	Astroe	NinoScript	You here?
