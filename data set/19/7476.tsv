2008-01-11T02:44:00.000Z	gvsa123		i now have devede. it's asking me what kind of disc i want to create... i want to watch an .avi in a home dvd player... do i choose video dvd or divx/mpeg 4?
2008-01-11T02:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 unless you got a newer dvd player that can read divx movie files
2008-01-11T02:45:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	the dvd burning is not in ubuntu by the way... it's on an xp machine
2008-01-11T02:46:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	so i can continue with this project in devede and transfer the file into the xp machine to be burned into a dvd as a movie?
2008-01-11T02:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 the geration of the various dvd files that get burnt to the disk is the hard part.. the actual burning of the dvd disk is easy.
2008-01-11T02:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 ive never used that tool. so no idea if it can just gereate the files, or not.
2008-01-11T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 you might be able to make it generate the dvd.iso file  which would save a little time also.
2008-01-11T02:47:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	i guess i'm gonna have to go and see then
2008-01-11T02:47:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	and the iso file is what i transfer to xp and burn into disc?
2008-01-11T02:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 that would make simpiler.
2008-01-11T02:48:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	this will run on a home dvd player... i need to show this movie to my class... argh
2008-01-11T02:48:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	ok thanks.. i'll give it a shot
2008-01-11T02:48:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	i like audio cd's better... lol
2008-01-11T02:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	the output video format should be pal or ntsc? sorry i know this is not exactly ubuntu stuff...
2008-01-11T02:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 depends on your tv and wher you live.. USA = NTSC, Other places = no idea. :)
2008-01-11T02:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gvsa123	 and it looke like by default devede generates a .iso
2008-01-11T02:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	i guess that would be ntsc... thanks again....
2008-01-11T02:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	yes it did... i guess i'll just leave everything with the default
2008-01-11T02:56:00.000Z	gvsa123	Dr_willis	okay... it says it's creating the iso... home dvd players are able to play iso files right?
