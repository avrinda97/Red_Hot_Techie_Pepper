2006-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	njan		damn, he left.
2006-05-12T06:29:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	I never knew about "mplayer -vo aa" before.  that's really funny.  :)
2006-05-12T06:30:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	it rocks :)
2006-05-12T06:30:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	can you get it to use the current terminal, instead of making a new window?  and can I set the font size to be smaller, for a higher-resolution ASCII image?
2006-05-12T06:32:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	I'm not sure about the former, but for the latter you'd have to do something with framebuffer and increase the resolution the console was operating at, I'd imagine
2006-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	I'm in a gnome-terminal, not the console.
2006-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	and "mplayer -vo aa:help" doesn't show aa options, like the man page promises it will.
2006-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	does it for you?
2006-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	it does for me.
2006-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	could you do a pastebin of it for me pls?
2006-05-12T06:34:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	http://pastebin.com/702806
2006-05-12T06:36:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	that's what I get.  it's nothing to do with 'aa' though, is it - it's generic mplayer help
2006-05-12T06:37:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	I hadn't even noticed that, I just pulled the command straight from the manpage 0:)
2006-05-12T06:38:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	I guess that's a bug that needs reporting - the program and the man page don't agree
2006-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	indeed, yeah
2006-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	even better:  mplayer -vo caca <-- colour ascii art :)
2006-05-12T06:48:00.000Z	njan	dooglus	that's pretty cool :)
2006-05-12T06:49:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	I reported the bug with the aa:help command
2006-05-21T08:23:00.000Z	dooglus	njan	how do you tune QoS settings?
