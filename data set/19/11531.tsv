2006-06-18T07:09:00.000Z	crash9877		anyone using an ibm rapid access ii keyboard?
2006-06-18T07:10:00.000Z	crash9877		i mean it works perfectly but i cant get all multimedia keys working
2006-06-18T07:10:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	lineak
2006-06-18T07:11:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	don't know if there is a package for it though
2006-06-18T07:11:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	well, help the developer with making it work better... there is a note on the right side of the webpage to get your keyboard working
2006-06-18T07:12:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	you'll get your name in lights on the page :)
2006-06-18T07:14:00.000Z	crash9877	alpha255	searched the web for rapidaccess but none useful information.
2006-06-18T07:14:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	http://lineak.sourceforge.net/index.php?nav=showdoc&docid=LinEAK_support_HOWTO&doctitle=Keyboard%20support%20HOWTO
2006-06-18T07:15:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	it looks like the guy will do most of the work to make it better
2006-06-18T07:16:00.000Z	crash9877	alpha255	thx thats what i did. 4 keys are dead
2006-06-18T07:17:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	oh man... that would make it *very* tough to use those keys ;)
2006-06-18T07:19:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	maybe you can get one on ebay for cheap that has those 4 keys working
2006-06-18T07:19:00.000Z	crash9877	alpha255	its ok now since i have several keyboards. i just wanted to know if someone has the same problem
2006-06-18T07:24:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	 dual boot it?
2006-06-18T07:25:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	 how about if you needed to connect via ssh to a remote location and wanted it to show in the desktop
2006-06-18T07:25:00.000Z	crash9877	alpha255	no chance dude. i love my mac with mac os x. i only install linux on pcs :-)
2006-06-18T07:25:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	os x is good stuff
2006-06-18T07:27:00.000Z	alpha255	crash9877	 in the connect to dialog    try ssh://nameofserver.domain.com ... that's the only thing that I wish it could do
