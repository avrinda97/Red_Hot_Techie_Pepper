2008-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	J-Unit		kill -15 pid                     then wat to kill a running app thru terminal?
2008-04-26T20:40:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	kill -15 ?
2008-04-26T20:41:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	i dont add pid?
2008-04-26T20:43:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	-15 is not necessary, SIGTERM is the default behaviour
2008-04-26T20:44:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	the one you're looking for (if a program locked up or doesn't respond to -15) is SIGKILL (or -9)
2008-04-26T20:44:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	its not if it doesnt respond necessarily
2008-04-26T20:44:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	its like im running a game that just doesnt show although its technically running but i dont c it
2008-04-26T20:45:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	so the syntax would be kill -9 PID, you can get the process ID through ps (man ps), alternatively, you could use killall to bypass the PS step, and directly give the name of processes to kill
2008-04-26T20:47:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	for example: killall ./test or killall mozilla-firefox-bin
2008-04-26T20:47:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	ps -e shows the number of all running processes?
2008-04-26T20:50:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	so all i need to do is killall nameofrunningappiwanttokill ?
2008-04-26T20:50:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	yes
2008-04-26T20:50:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	thx but no offense u could of said that from the begining
2008-04-26T20:51:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	heh, sorry :)
2008-04-26T20:51:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	at least now you know about both techniques :)
2008-04-26T20:51:00.000Z	J-Unit	crashanddie	thx again
2008-04-26T21:02:00.000Z	crashanddie	J-Unit	high speed eh :)
