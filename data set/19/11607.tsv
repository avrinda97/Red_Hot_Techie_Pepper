2006-03-17T10:42:00.000Z	ITSa341		<-- has to admit he's not running ubuntu right now    Xandros4 for the moment
2006-03-17T10:43:00.000Z	ITSa341		But I find this the friendliest help room I have been to in years and very helpful usually
2006-03-17T10:45:00.000Z	ITSa341		Anyone know how I can convert RH drivers to work with Ubuntu? I need my GPS working and all I can find is RH drivers which won't load.
2006-03-17T10:45:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	alien?
2006-03-17T10:46:00.000Z	ITSa341	metalhedd	 alien is only for packages right? Not actual drivers? All I can get is the driver.c files
2006-03-17T10:46:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	you could run a redhat kernel probably.
2006-03-17T10:48:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	otherwise you'd have to pick through the error messages to find out which patches you need to apply to get the driver to work.
2006-03-17T10:48:00.000Z	ITSa341	metalhedd	   there are 100's of them to pick through and I'm a relative newbie
2006-03-17T10:49:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	probably have better luck installing a redhat kernel.
2006-03-17T10:49:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	you can probably find instructions somewhere.
2006-03-17T10:49:00.000Z	ITSa341	metalhedd	   yuck
2006-03-17T10:49:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	meh
2006-03-17T10:49:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	ubuntu's kernel is nothing special either.
2006-03-17T10:50:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	you need to compile your own from scratch if you wnat a real nice one.
2006-03-17T10:51:00.000Z	ITSa341	metalhedd	 of all the times I have tried to compile my own kernel  2 have actually been bootable after
2006-03-17T10:51:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	practice practice practice.
2006-03-17T10:51:00.000Z	metalhedd	ITSa341	in my gentoo days I could reconfigure a kernel in 2 minutes flat.
2006-03-17T10:52:00.000Z	ITSa341	metalhedd	I just need to learn to BACKUP then practice
