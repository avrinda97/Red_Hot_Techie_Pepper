2004-11-11T12:54:00.000Z	tolstoy		time and date settings says to "enable ntp", but doesn't say how.
2004-11-11T12:56:00.000Z	tolstoy		Is there something in particular I have to install for the applet to enable NTP support?
2004-11-11T12:56:00.000Z	tolstoy		ntpdate is there, but the applet doesn't seem to recognize it.
2004-11-11T12:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	try sudo /etc/init.d/ntpdate restart
2004-11-11T12:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	and do you have default ntpdate servers set up?
2004-11-11T12:58:00.000Z	tolstoy	thoreauputic	it says "synchronizing", but I still can't click the checkbox in the applet.
2004-11-11T12:59:00.000Z	tolstoy	thoreauputic	I've just got "ntp" and "ntpdate" installed.  Not, say, "ntp-simple".
2004-11-11T13:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	hmm - I don't really know then - I just use ntpdate from a terminal without the daemon, and alias it to "t" (lazy I guess)
2004-11-11T13:00:00.000Z	tolstoy	thoreauputic	and on my laptop, I've got ntp-simple, and ntp-server, which was a flail for the first time this didn't work.  Works on the laptop now, though.
2004-11-11T13:01:00.000Z	tolstoy	thoreauputic	Ah. Don't set your gnome-panel clock to do it for you (ie, even lazier)!
2004-11-11T13:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	you might need to specify some IPs for it to look for? Public ntp servers?
2004-11-11T13:01:00.000Z	tolstoy	thoreauputic	that's what you do *after* to click the synchronize checkbox.  Do you have it there on your panel?
2004-11-11T13:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	I'm on debian and using fluxbox :/

2004-11-11T13:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	taking forever to  load here
2004-11-11T13:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	I see
2005-02-27T11:59:00.000Z	tolstoy	thoreauputic	I generally startx from the tty all the time.
2005-02-27T12:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	so did I until Ubuntu - now I'm cursing gdm all the time ;)
2005-02-27T12:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tolstoy	but I still do the startx thing quite a bit
