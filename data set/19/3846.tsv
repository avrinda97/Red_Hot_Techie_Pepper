2009-05-18T13:03:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	that doesn't work for me.  might've disabled it though :)
2009-05-18T13:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	Check System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts > Action > Desktop > Run a terminal.
2009-05-18T13:07:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	ah I see why it's disabled now.  last week sometime I went to remap it to Win+T.  but when I try it just maps it to the Win key on its own, or Super-L as it calls it.  except that doesn't actually do anything when I press it.
2009-05-18T13:08:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	so then I gave up, couldn't remember what the default was (there is no way to reset it back to the default), then hit backspace it disable it
2009-05-18T13:09:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	I just set it back to Ctrl+Alt+T and it still doesn't work.  mysterious.
2009-05-18T13:10:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	others work though, eg. Alt+Tab
2009-05-18T13:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	Because you mingled with it in an inapprorite way. May be http://www.columbia.edu/~djv/docs/keyremap.html helps.
2009-05-18T13:41:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	my Keyboard Shortcuts settings seem to be having no effect at all, btw...
2009-05-22T10:24:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	whoever wrote that description was being a bit loose with the English language
2009-05-22T10:25:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	of course not all daemons have to be run as root ("system daemon") .. but I don't think that's what they meant.
2009-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	And how would you express this statement in more precise English?
2009-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	Ah, I see. Thank you for explaining.
2009-05-22T10:27:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	I'd cheat and read /usr/ports/consolekit/pkg-descr in FreeBSD.
2009-05-22T10:29:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	I haven't been following closely so I don't know what your original question was.
2009-05-22T10:30:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/ConsoleKit may be useful though
2009-05-22T10:39:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	Thank you.
2009-05-25T17:19:00.000Z	ozzmosis	bullgard4	grep will probably find it, in a crude way
2009-05-25T18:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	'~$ rgrep  'IBM Red Book' / 2>/dev/null' runs now almost an hour and has not found it. Impractical.
2009-05-26T14:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	ozzmosis	No, I can have more than ten if I want to.
