2006-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	ROBOd		hello
2006-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	ROBOd		i want to have executable files from ~/bin available in my "path"
2006-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	ROBOd		so i can directly write my-script blah
2006-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	ROBOd		instead of ~/bin/my-script blah
2006-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	ROBOd		how to do it?
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	ROBOd		Opera internet suite
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	ROBOd		you know it?
2006-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	ROBOd		it has an email client, quite a good one
2006-08-12T05:06:00.000Z	ROBOd		you can use that instead of evolution
2006-08-12T05:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ROBOd	/etc/environment contains the system path... but you can change the ones longbean said as well...
2006-08-12T05:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ROBOd	Probably better to use ~/.bash*, because other users won't have access anyway.
2006-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	ROBOd	Tomcat_	it seems my bash_profile already contains ~/bin
2006-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	ROBOd	Tomcat_	but it doesn't work....
2006-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ROBOd	Did you restart the console? What is the exact line in .bash_profile?
2006-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ROBOd	What does "env" say?
2006-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	ROBOd	Tomcat_	that's all
2006-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	ROBOd	Tomcat_	any suggestions? i am now using the gnome terminal... but i want my bin scripts to be available in all terminals
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	ROBOd	Tomcat_	i have check from vt1, yes, my ~/bin works, but ... i want in gnome terminal
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ROBOd	Well, answer my questions... did you restart the console after changing your PATH? What does "env" say about the PATH?
