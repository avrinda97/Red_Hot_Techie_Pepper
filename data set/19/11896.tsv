2007-12-31T05:45:00.000Z	Delvien		PCMCIA wifi card*
2007-12-31T05:46:00.000Z	tarvid	Delvien	I use an 8470 WD Orinoco
2007-12-31T05:46:00.000Z	tarvid		It has an external antenna port which comes in handy when signal is weak
2007-12-31T05:46:00.000Z	Delvien	tarvid	any messed up installation for that ? this belkin actually got FRIED installing the drivers
2007-12-31T05:47:00.000Z	tarvid	Delvien	there has been much noise about the madwifi drivers but mine works fine
2007-12-31T05:47:00.000Z	tarvid	Delvien	I tried every card at Walmart and returned the whole bunch
2007-12-31T05:48:00.000Z	Delvien	tarvid	bought mine at wal mart, its a rip off
2007-12-31T05:48:00.000Z	tarvid	Delvien	I have a few frisbees (Prism) but the atheros works better for me
2007-12-31T05:48:00.000Z	Delvien	tarvid	i had to install because of my graphics card.. the card was working with the SAME instructions i used last install now its not
2007-12-31T05:48:00.000Z	tarvid	Delvien	there are more expensive cards with higher power but I haven't tried those
2007-12-31T05:49:00.000Z	Delvien	tarvid	madwifi , will that work on all cards?
2007-12-31T05:49:00.000Z	tarvid	Delvien	no it is atheros specific. The Orinoco cards used to try and work with atheros but the results were poor
2007-12-31T05:50:00.000Z	Delvien	tarvid	ah
2007-12-31T05:50:00.000Z	tarvid		I solved my stupid cron problem, the stupid part was me, I hate that

2007-12-31T05:54:00.000Z	tarvid		pcmcia is obsolete. I have used a dozen or so of this model and everyone still works
