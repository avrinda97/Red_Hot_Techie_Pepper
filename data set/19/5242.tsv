2008-08-07T05:53:00.000Z	godzirra		Can anyone think of a reason why my windows box can't reach my linux box, but my laptop can?
2008-08-07T05:55:00.000Z	godzirra		which is the linux box ip.
2008-08-07T05:56:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	is there a vpn client on your windows side that is getting exclusive control on your network interface?
2008-08-07T05:56:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	no.  Fresh install of windows.
2008-08-07T05:57:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	I'd be looking at things like, is the patch cable the same, can I contact it from the windows box booted onto an Ubuntu live cd, hardware testing like that
2008-08-07T05:58:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	well, the windows box works fine network wise.
2008-08-07T05:58:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	everything EXCEPT getting to the .99 linux box works.
2008-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	Windows firewall status?
2008-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	checking
2008-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	I tihnk you're right and its windows firewall being retarded.
2008-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	let's hope - from all you've said it sounds like windows software issue - the Firewall might just be doing it's job
2008-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	could be.  I just added putty to the exceptions list though and I still don't connect. :/
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	I'd definitely just shut off the Windows Firewall entirely, and see if it works
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	Yeah, trying that now.  Its still not working.
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	I'd reboot too after that
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	blah... okay.
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	you can try the ubuntu live cd while you're at it
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	csky_max	godzirra	good luck
2008-08-07T06:06:00.000Z	godzirra	csky_max	WAit, it works externally to ssh with putty.
