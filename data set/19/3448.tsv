2009-08-25T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mnaines	i dont get why they cant just use the sockets on every soundcard ever rather than messing with usb stuff, it an extra complication
2009-08-25T14:25:00.000Z	mnaines	ActionParsnip	Its called "Keeping up with the Joneses"...People these days are born and bred believing they have to have the latest and greatest
2009-08-25T14:34:00.000Z	mnaines	ActionParsnip	Would 800MHz on a dual-core (800MHz on each of two cores) be detrimental to Ubuntu's performance?
2009-08-25T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mnaines	not at all, thats plenty
2009-08-25T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mnaines	if its sluggish then install lxde or xfce as a lighter desktop environment

2009-08-25T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mnaines	i use lxde througout
2009-08-25T14:38:00.000Z	mnaines	ActionParsnip	I think my idea is better because it gets me used to the different DEs
2009-08-25T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mnaines	lxde is a different de :/
2009-08-25T14:39:00.000Z	mnaines	ActionParsnip	I mean that if I use multiple distros each with a different DE, I can get myself comfortable with those different DEs

2009-10-10T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mnaines	sh uses encryption so is secure
