2009-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	rey		reinstalled windows, running ubuntu in WUBI
2009-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	rey		still same problem
2009-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	Wubi can go bad
2009-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	Wubi tends to = bad
2009-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	better to do a partition install :)
2009-07-21T07:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	and even better get rid of Windows :)   well maybe dual boot for some apps, if your 3D Windows gaming well keep it on dual boot for now I guess
2009-07-21T07:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	with enough RAM for most other stuff you can run Ubuntu inside Windows,  anyway  get yourself sorted out with a partitioned install :)
2009-07-21T07:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	which ones?
2009-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	oh stuff you may be able to virtual machine,  depending on RAM
2009-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	how much you got?
2009-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	yep that's enough for Windows virtual machines.  Virtualbox :)  http://www.virtualbox.org   and then when you got your install you can get the version for linux hosts from their site which has USB support.  and then when doing vm  doing a dynamically expanding hard disk is best.    anyway you need to get an install on there that works properly, first
2009-07-21T07:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	virtual machine :)
2009-07-21T07:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rey	external hard disk first
