2012-02-22T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	stop printing at the first blank line?
2012-02-22T17:22:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	jrib	how?
2012-02-22T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	I don't know offhand
2012-02-22T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	why do you need to?  Why can't you just look at the beginning of the file?
2012-02-22T17:23:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	jrib	i wanted to put the name of the cpu in conky
2012-02-22T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	well if you only had the information for the first core how would you then get the name?
2012-02-22T17:24:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	jrib	grep
2012-02-22T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	so why not use grep on the whole thing?  And have grep return only 1 result?
2012-02-22T17:25:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	jrib	how do i use grep to use only processor 0?
2012-02-22T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	see --max-count in « man grep »
2012-02-22T17:26:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	jrib	ok
2012-02-22T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	see if #ubuntu-motu (and maybe #ubuntu-packaging) have better advice
2012-02-22T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	you can at least package it yourself, whether or not you can get it into the repos I am not sure (really depends on what the issues with the current package are).  You can always put it in your own ppa.  And packaging should not be difficult since there is already a package for an earlier version
2012-02-22T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	ljsoftnet	ignore my comments about packaging... wrong nick
2012-02-22T17:30:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	jrib	got it thanks man
