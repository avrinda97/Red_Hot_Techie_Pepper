2010-10-09T18:16:00.000Z	btQuark		greetings
2010-10-09T18:16:00.000Z	btQuark		i've got problems with ubuntu 10.04 and the nvidia-commercial driver
2010-10-09T18:16:00.000Z	btQuark		using a celsius h250 workstation notebook (quadro graphics in there) i cannot get the device to wake up properly from sleep
2010-10-09T18:17:00.000Z	btQuark		it does suspend, anyhow it does not wake up properly, or it does wakeup anyhow does not get its display initialized again
2010-10-09T18:18:00.000Z	btQuark		the hints with "agp" in the various forums did not work, most likely due to the fact that its not agp but pci-e
2010-10-09T18:18:00.000Z	btQuark		stupid thing is - windows works like a charm
2010-10-09T18:19:00.000Z	btQuark		solaris works like a charm
2010-10-09T18:19:00.000Z	btQuark		only the uberpro-superduper-ubuntu has yet again decided to deprecate acellerated graphics
2010-10-09T18:20:00.000Z	noob-tux	btQuark	why bother use ubuntu? go for windows.....spend more $ while we save more $ :P
2010-10-09T18:20:00.000Z	btQuark		i've had that once with radeon graphics - then workstation graphics again, as i need to do real work, and it did not work as well, because "uh, opensource and no our driver is not fit for the purpose yet"
2010-10-09T18:21:00.000Z	btQuark	Jookia	- i wouldn't regard a driver that works on a ridiculous number of platforms without issue and fast as "broken" when one weeny bunch of software does not get its act clean and some stable binary interfaces up
2010-10-09T18:22:00.000Z	btQuark		ah, because you supersmug linuxies dont like to hear about problems?
2010-10-09T18:22:00.000Z	btQuark		that might the point of people not using your software because it does not work for them
2010-10-09T18:23:00.000Z	btQuark		well, seems like ubuntu still is best kept in a virtual machine, aka "native environment"
2010-10-09T18:23:00.000Z	noob-tux	btQuark	from now on....read c++ programming tutorials.....and from the time u know how to read and write program....make ur own operating system! and u'll know why those programmers take time to debug those bugs found......
2010-10-09T18:23:00.000Z	btQuark		since all relevant hardware function still dont work
2010-10-09T18:24:00.000Z	btQuark		sure.
2010-10-09T18:24:00.000Z	btQuark		and the crusades death cases were not the christs' faults but the fault of those who refused to be christs
2010-10-09T18:24:00.000Z	noob-tux	btQuark	in this world we know the good and the moron! unlucky u belong to the moron type! :))))))))
