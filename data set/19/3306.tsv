2009-09-19T03:39:00.000Z	chingus	sOMETHING132	you don't have to go as root, it was a suggestion
2009-09-19T03:40:00.000Z	chingus	sOMETHING132	the default user is usually good, try log in as yourself, if all that fails type in "root" in username and administrators password for that username
2009-09-19T03:41:00.000Z	chingus	sOMETHING132	sorry there is no root account in ubuntu...I thought there was
2009-09-19T03:41:00.000Z	chingus	sOMETHING132	basically find and kill -9 the process that it says is trying to block you out...
2009-09-19T03:43:00.000Z	chingus	sOMETHING132	hope that helps got to go now....
