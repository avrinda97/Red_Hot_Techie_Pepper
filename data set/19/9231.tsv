2006-12-08T08:24:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	no. the command "install" is totally unrelated. type "man install" to know what it does
2006-12-08T08:25:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	ok, then i would have to use sudo dpkg?
2006-12-08T08:25:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	thanx a lot, i'm finally getting it
2006-12-08T08:26:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	or gdebi
2006-12-08T08:27:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	then i need to locate ndiswrapper-utils-1.8.deb or do i specify the folder
2006-12-08T08:28:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	well, if you've downloaded it manually, it'll be on the desktop or somewhere in your home, no? you'll need to specify the path unless you're already there, yes.
2006-12-08T08:30:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	if it is on my desktop, no path name is needed? i thought no path name is needed if it was in the same folder as terminal (wherever that is) - and 1 other thing, what is the difference between sudo -i and dkpg -i?
2006-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	uh? "sudo" is a command to let you run things with administrator priviledges ("root"), using the "sudo <command>" syntax.  "sudo -i" is a way of saying that you don't just want to run *one* command as administrator, but you want to start a *shell* as administrator (when you're finished, you can use "exit")
2006-12-08T08:31:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	"dpkg" on the other hand is the program that handles .deb files. the "-i" option is for "install"
2006-12-08T08:32:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	besides that -- as you correctly said, you can do without the path name only if you're in the right folder, in the terminal. the default folder is your home ("/home/your-username", can also be spelled "~"). the desktop folder is ~/Desktop
2006-12-08T08:33:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	what are you looking for?
2006-12-08T08:34:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	i'm lookin for ndiswrapper 1.8 that is prebuilt for edgy, kernel 2.6.17-10, correct?
2006-12-08T08:34:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	hm, i'm not sure you'll find that. i suppose you've read the WiFi howto?
2006-12-08T08:36:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	for the most part, yeah. i know for ubuntu edgy, i need to find ndiswrapper-utils-1.8, take a look here- http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy/Hardware#How_to_install_Windows_Wireless_Drivers_.28Ndiswrapper.29
2006-12-08T08:41:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	--- after i install the deb package using dpkg -i, then i use sudo to install the wireless driver, correct?
2006-12-08T08:42:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	i've never really dealt with wireless. but for that matter, you need sudo for running dpkg as well - you can't install .deb files while you're not root
2006-12-08T08:44:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	oops, i mean i need to run sudo dkpg -i (location of package) and then use sudo ndiswrapper (and specify my windows driver inf) - ndiswrapper is a program to install wireless windows drivers
2006-12-08T08:45:00.000Z	Cubed	LjL	does that help you see what i'm trying to do
2006-12-08T08:52:00.000Z	LjL	Cubed	it makes sense as far as i can tell but i just don't know how ndiswrapper is supposed to be used, so it could be right as well as it could be wrong
