2008-05-10T10:21:00.000Z	jlc		I recently installed a clean load of 8.04 x64, what is my root password?
2008-05-10T10:22:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	there is not root password nor root account activated by defualt
2008-05-10T10:24:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	ubottu is not human, but yes, you can "become" root with sudo. It is very convenient.
2008-05-10T10:32:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	I need the jre, can I just change the name of the download?
2008-05-10T10:26:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	and you do not need to follow strange steps form the Sun site to install Java. Java is in the repos, you can apt-get it.
2008-05-10T10:27:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	what's the syntax for that?
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	this would help http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=606009
2008-05-10T10:29:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	programming talk?
2008-05-10T10:30:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	yes? there is a FAQ
2008-05-10T10:30:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	I've got the file I downloaded from sun, now I just need to figure out how to install it.
2008-05-10T10:31:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	don't do it that way is my advice.  Do "sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jdk"
2008-05-10T10:31:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	ty
2008-05-10T10:33:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	search packages through synaptic, yes. JRE is the runtime only, I thought you wanted the development kit to actually program in java. Maybe I didn't get you the first time.
2008-05-10T10:36:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	ty.  I got it installed but it don't work in Firefox.
2008-05-10T10:37:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	and yes, it is enabled.
2008-05-10T10:38:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	well, there is a separate package for the web plugins, I think ..."sun-java6-plugin"
2008-05-10T10:39:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	btw, will these work on the x64 version?
2008-05-10T10:41:00.000Z	vocx	jlc	ow! Maybe you want to try the 64-bit forum in ubuntuforums.org  I really don't know... Maybe they work, maybe not. If they are in the repos they should work. Arg, don't know.
2008-05-10T10:41:00.000Z	jlc	vocx	ty, will look into it.
