2007-04-30T08:46:00.000Z	CheshireViking		is it possible to use either the alternate cd, or the desktop cd to boot to a command line system?
2007-04-30T08:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	desktop cd
2007-04-30T08:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	once booted just press "ctrl+alt+f1"
2007-04-30T08:48:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	thats not what I'm looking for, I've got a laptop which won't boot the live cd completely, it hangs part way through booting & I wanted to see whether I could edit the xorg.conf to change  the video driver before it starts gnome
2007-04-30T08:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	tried safe graphics mode?
2007-04-30T08:48:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	yes, tried that, i just ended up with a black screen
2007-04-30T08:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	and ctrl+alt+f1 didn't take you anywhere?
2007-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	I didn't think about trying ctrl-alt-f1, i'll try it when i get home, generally everything seems frozen - mouse doesn't move, ctrl-alt-backspace didn't do anything
2007-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	i'd recommend an alternate install then
2007-04-30T08:52:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	thats what I was afraid of, because its not my laptop, I wanted to be sure it'd work ok first from the live cd, but if its the only option, I'll have to try that - annoying thing is that a dapper livecd doesn't crash, just edgy & fiesty - i suppose i could install dapper & then upgrade to edgy & upgrade to fiesty

2007-05-25T16:49:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	it must have got out of bed on the wrong side
2007-08-01T06:49:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	i knew lurking here would teach me things, i've been wondering how to cut & paste in xchat but never got round to looking for it
2007-08-01T06:50:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	hilight and middle click is the greatest linux feature _EVER_
2007-08-03T12:33:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	on xchat, not xchat-gnome
2007-08-03T12:34:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	yes, xchat, i thought that was what lunchbox_ said they were using
2007-08-03T12:34:00.000Z	PriceChild	CheshireViking	no, he thinks he is, but he's on xchat-gnome it seems
2007-08-03T12:35:00.000Z	CheshireViking	PriceChild	ah ok then
