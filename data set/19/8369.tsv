2007-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Kaur		I'm trying to record sound with ubuntu, but no matter which soft I use there's this wierd background sound....
2007-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Kaur		How can i get rid of it
2007-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	that is interference, that is natural
2007-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	get a usb mic instead
2007-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	do u realy think it's normal? I dunno...
2007-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	it is, if you are using analog instead of digital. what are you trying to record?
2007-04-07T08:51:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	speech
2007-04-07T08:51:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	off a microphone
2007-04-07T08:52:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	I don't understand what u mean
2007-04-07T08:52:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	are you using a microphone with the plugin that looks like headphones?
2007-04-07T08:52:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	and is the noice sorta like a static?
2007-04-07T08:52:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	Basicly, it's a skype headset...
2007-04-07T08:53:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	yes, it's static
2007-04-07T08:53:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	usb plugin? no, its probably analog, you plug it into your pc witha round connector that looks like a headphone jack
2007-04-07T08:53:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	yes, it's analog... No usb
2007-04-07T08:54:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	you need a usb headset, that will eliminate the static. analog almost always have static
2007-04-07T08:54:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	thats all i can tell you.
2007-04-07T08:54:00.000Z	Kaur	Linuxnewbie756	ok, many thanks
2007-04-07T08:54:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	Kaur	yw
