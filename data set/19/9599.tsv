2007-03-03T10:12:00.000Z	cassio		everybody! I wanna know from those who are using edgy if it runs faster than dapper drake...
2007-03-03T10:12:00.000Z	cassio		I'm running Eclipse for Java development, but I think it's too slow here...
2007-03-03T10:12:00.000Z	cassio		i know 512 mb ram is not that much but....
2007-03-03T10:14:00.000Z	cassio		yes, but Eclipse is too heavy weight I think...
2007-03-03T10:15:00.000Z	cassio		In Windows it runs ok...
2007-03-03T10:15:00.000Z	cassio		but i don't loke windows
2007-03-03T10:15:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	 what are you trying to do? develop java or run the app server?
2007-03-03T10:18:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	 what are you trying to do? develop java or run the app server?
2007-03-03T10:18:00.000Z	cassio	bulmer	develop
2007-03-03T10:18:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	then whats the worries of slowness? unless you're running the apps server on same machine
2007-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	cassio	bulmer	it because you haven't see it...
2007-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	why not run tomcat in a server and just do your development in laptop?
2007-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	vim not enuff?  :)
2007-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	you can turn off the app server running on eclipse noh?
2007-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	cassio	bulmer	nope... I'm using lots of plugins for Eclipse... it helps me a lot, its more productive... I use vim just to program C or Perl
2007-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	but plug-ins only works after you have it running on the app server noh?
2007-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	cassio	bulmer	if fact app server in Eclipse runs as a plugin for Tomcat... it's not native, just a bridge for the installed server
2007-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	cassio	bulmer	nope, they run during development
2007-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	bulmer	cassio	oh okay.
