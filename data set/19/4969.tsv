2008-09-27T03:34:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	what is your problem.
2008-09-27T03:38:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	please excuse me if you have already stated you problem in detail, but it is very hard to solve a problem without knowing details.
2008-09-27T03:42:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	thanks. I will look into your problem.
2008-09-27T03:44:00.000Z	lima	portablejim	Thanks buddy!
2008-09-27T03:47:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	How new is your installation?
2008-09-27T03:47:00.000Z	lima	portablejim	Dude, I already wrote another user, but as already told you, I am novice in the Linux world.
2008-09-27T03:49:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	so another user can use the computer alright?
2008-09-27T03:55:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	on the problem user, open up terminal and type "mv ~/.gconf ~/_.gconf"
2008-09-27T04:00:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	I think typing "mv ~/.gconf ~/_.gconf" on the terminal will fix your problem.
2008-09-27T04:04:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	 Quando você faz login, depois das mensagens de erro, vá para Aplicações => Acessórios => Terminal (the brazilian was a translator, just to help you understand)
2008-09-27T04:07:00.000Z	lima	portablejim	see if I understand as I do:
2008-09-27T04:11:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	 not exactly. on the problem user just type into terminal "mv ~/.gconf ~/_.gconf", no need to use 'su or sudo'
2008-09-27T04:13:00.000Z	lima	portablejim	:sure, but that is due this error?
2008-09-27T04:23:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	I am still here.
2008-09-27T04:49:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	post up (to pastebin of course) the output from "df -h"
2008-09-27T04:49:00.000Z	portablejim	lima	you run "df -h" in terminal.
