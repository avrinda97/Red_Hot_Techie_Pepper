2006-12-10T15:04:00.000Z	kerik		but it will still throttle it?
2006-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	was 'scaling' in mine
2006-12-10T14:43:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	space after 'nano' in that line
2006-12-10T14:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	how much can you spend and how big do you want?
2006-12-10T15:04:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	do you have scaling enabled in the BIOS?  sometimes it's disabled by default, e.g. my Dell laptop
2006-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	I actually don't know...what is that called in BIOS?
2006-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	might also be 'hyperthreading'
2006-12-10T15:06:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	It's a celeron so hyperthreading might not be supported?
2006-12-10T15:06:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	ah, maybe not, mine is a core-duo
2006-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	That might do the trick ;)
2006-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	yeah, sorry, you can't hyperthread a single core heh
2006-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	Mine is an elderly IBM thinkpad r31 celeron 1,13 256MB Ram.. :)
2006-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	but runs linux like a dream compared to XP
2006-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	I'm not entirely sure if those older CPU's did scaling or not
2006-12-10T15:08:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	well...its a mobile version of the celeron - or so it says...so it should be able to scale in my logic :)
2006-12-10T15:09:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	you would think, I'm just not sure
2006-12-10T15:10:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	What I need to learn myself is the bloody linux commands....being used to windows and DOS for 16 years, I have to rethink everything...and it is just too logic in linux ;)
2006-12-10T15:10:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kerik	you'll get it with time
2006-12-10T15:10:00.000Z	kerik	Kingsqueak	yeah I hope so :). the thing is to figure where to start and end...
