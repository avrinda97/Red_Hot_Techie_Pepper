2011-12-20T03:05:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	of course you can. resizing partitions is a dangerous operation.
2011-12-20T03:05:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	perhaps try moving it to the left first, and then resizing?
2011-12-20T03:06:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	but anyway if you're scared of losing your data, *don't do this*. resizing partitions is *dangerous*. have a backup.
2011-12-20T03:06:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	didn't you just say you had free space on the left?
2011-12-20T03:07:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	or a DVD, or a USB key, or something.
2011-12-20T03:07:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	like this? | Windows partition | Free space | Ubuntu partition |
2011-12-20T03:20:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	you need to resize the extended partition first, and then resize the partitions contained in it
2012-07-03T23:35:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	/join ##c
2012-07-04T19:51:00.000Z	LjL	phil_phys	weren't you already told ##c ?
