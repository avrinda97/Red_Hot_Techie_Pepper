2011-02-08T04:52:00.000Z	Pici	tucemiux	More likely because you failed to 'apt-get update' properly, try it again.
2011-02-08T04:54:00.000Z	tucemiux	Pici	i didnt get the same error again, probably 'cos I did an apt-get update some time ago, Im upgrading now, hopefully it'll work after I reboot o_O
2011-05-11T23:23:00.000Z	Pici	tucemiux	You mean screen? Or tmux?
2011-05-11T23:27:00.000Z	Pici	tucemiux	No. Its ctrl-a then d
2011-05-11T23:30:00.000Z	tucemiux	Pici	now Im confused!
2011-05-11T23:31:00.000Z	tucemiux	Pici	so start up screen then control A, then start the command, then control-D ?
2011-05-11T23:31:00.000Z	Pici	tucemiux	No.  Use ctrl-a to enter the mode where you can enter screen commands.  'd' is the key to detatch from screen.  See ctrl-a then '?' for help

2011-07-07T20:52:00.000Z	Pici	tucemiux	I'm lousy with flash problems.
2011-07-14T19:19:00.000Z	Pici	tucemiux	Lmat: It is initially defined in /etc/environment, but for adding to it for yourself, you should add a PATH=/new/path:$PATH to your own .bashrc (or relevant $SHELL config file)
2011-07-14T19:19:00.000Z	tucemiux	Pici	apparently on ubuntu it's on .profile
