2007-09-19T10:58:00.000Z	Astaroth		this isn't about instancy
2007-09-19T10:58:00.000Z	Astaroth		it's about the fact that people have been having these problems for weeks, and people are not even bothering to reply
2007-09-19T10:58:00.000Z	Astaroth		let alone try to help
2007-09-19T10:59:00.000Z	Astaroth		and they are just replying to completely unimportant threads
2007-09-19T10:59:00.000Z	Astaroth		yeah that's the sort of attitude that will make ubuntu popular
2007-09-19T10:59:00.000Z	Astaroth		well done guys
2007-09-19T11:00:00.000Z	Astaroth		maybe i'll just do what everyone else is doing and drop ubuntu for sabayon
2007-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	Astaroth		what's so special about sabayon? how about the fact that it works?
2007-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	Astaroth		as opposed to ubuntu?
2007-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	Astaroth		out of the box as well
2007-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	please stop trolling/offtopic :)
2007-09-19T11:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	it might be useful to know what you have tried, and to pastebin outputs of tests from ubotu's message
2007-09-19T11:07:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	also tell the channel what card you have
2007-09-19T11:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	that isn't official ubuntu documentation, read the ubuntu wiki guide.
2007-09-19T11:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	also, reinstalling packages does no good as configuration files are left
2007-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	finally does it work on the desktop cd live session?
2007-09-19T11:13:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	you haven't even given me an error, i'm just assuming you have followed the guides properly so far
2007-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	why are you using module-assistant ?
2007-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	PriceChild	Astaroth	why are you using module assistant? :S
