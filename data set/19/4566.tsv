2008-12-18T18:22:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles		 Hi there. Using Ubuntu 8.10, pretty new to linux. Until last night everything was working fine. Woke up this morning, and there's no sound. There's sound at the login screen, but when I am logged in nothing. Any ideas?
2008-12-18T18:23:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Okay. Volume's up right?
2008-12-18T18:24:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Close firefox and test for sound?
2008-12-18T18:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Yeah,  but try Slart's idea first.
2008-12-18T18:29:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Closed firefox while you're testing?
2008-12-18T18:29:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles	tiyowan	: Aye.
2008-12-18T18:33:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	try typing killall pulseaudio from a terminal and retesting?
2008-12-18T18:33:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles	tiyowan	: No process killed
2008-12-18T18:35:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Let me dig up the forums to see if I get something. What's your hardware?
2008-12-18T18:35:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles	tiyowan	: And at this point my mind goes utterly blank. Does ubuntu have a nice way of finding out hardware, or should I just boot back into windows?
2008-12-18T18:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	lspci command. Check to see if it picks up your sound card.
2008-12-18T18:38:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles	tiyowan	Neaai , jrib : 05:02.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Audigy LS
2008-12-18T18:40:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Uh-oh. The threads I dug up relate to the Audigy card.
2008-12-18T18:41:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Wait one. Searching some more on the forums.
2008-12-18T18:43:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles	tiyowan	: Np, thankee. Weird though - I just found the command aplay -l and ran it. It doesnt list the SB.
2008-12-18T18:44:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	I'm with you, buddy, running some searches. Give me a couple of minutes.
2008-12-18T18:47:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	I'm still digging. Follow Neaai's instructions and see if that works.
2008-12-18T18:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	Hey, that's great!
2008-12-18T19:08:00.000Z	tiyowan	Stephen|Edibles	I think Neaai's pointed you on the right track. :) If I were you, I'd do the same thing.
