2008-10-13T13:59:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94		guys.. I have a serious question: is it dangerous to left just 200MB spaces on your ROOT drive?
2008-10-13T13:59:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	what do you mean by root drive?
2008-10-13T14:00:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	I mean, the "/" drive... and it's not even 200MBs, it's just 120MBs!
2008-10-13T14:01:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	yes that is dangerous. You can install localepurge to save some space and launch the disk usage anylazer to see where it is all being used up.
2008-10-13T14:01:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	you know, in Windoze, if the drive C: is left with such little space, it'll screamin' "not enough free space" etc..
2008-10-13T14:01:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	what is localepurge?
2008-10-13T14:02:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	it is a program that gets rid of unneeded locales (translations)
2008-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	ok, I've installed localepurge. Then it pops up with a list of weird-name files..
2008-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	what language is your native language?
2008-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	ok, lets see... I'm Indonesian, but never use that language for computer. So, it'll be English. Oh, and I'll need Japanese and Arabic, too.
2008-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	so which one should I choose?
2008-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	en_US or en_UK or which ever one you are, I think JP is japan and AR is arabic, not sure lemme check
2008-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	or someone else: what is the difference of en_US, en_US.ISO-8859-15, and en_US.UTF-8? Which one should I choose...?
2008-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	you can choose all of them
2008-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	must I choose all of them?
2008-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	only the ones you want
2008-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	why not just "en" or "en_US"?
2008-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	ziroday	oh ok.. but I don't understand their difference..
2008-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	ziroday	mib_88cqzp94	en will have every language with en, en_US will have every language with en_US in it
