2006-07-21T14:46:00.000Z	emil_		Hello
2006-07-21T14:46:00.000Z	emil_		I've got a problem with totem
2006-07-21T14:46:00.000Z	emil_		It says: "Cannot contact the soundservers"
2006-07-21T14:46:00.000Z	emil_		I allready reinstalled, but same problem.
2006-07-21T14:48:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	Does sound work in other stuff?
2006-07-21T14:48:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	I don't have programs with sound
2006-07-21T14:50:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	My sound even doesn't work on other programs, but yesterday it worked
2006-07-21T14:51:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	Is this just gstreamer-based (like totem, rhythmbox, etc.) or everything, including XMMS, login sounds, etc.
2006-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	Yesterday it worked, i installed some codecs, they worked, but now i don't have sound at all
2006-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	Did you have to set up the sound before, or was it automatic?
2006-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	 Automatic
2006-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	OK, try "alsamixer" in a terminal
2006-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	Surround is off and Center is off, LFE is off, LINE is off
2006-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	I think space enebles them. But you're not getting any errors about the hardware not being detected?
2006-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	he detects the hardware
2006-07-21T14:56:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	Does the Gnome volume control work? Try double clicking on the volume applet in the panel
2006-07-21T14:56:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	I changed some settings, and now Totem wokrs again and plays music well
2006-07-21T14:56:00.000Z	emil_	Warbo	Thank you very much
2006-07-21T14:56:00.000Z	Warbo	emil_	(I'm having sound problems myself right now, but that may be because I just pulled apart the cable)
