2009-12-22T08:48:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi all!  Is there a linux tool for viewing windows event logs?
2009-12-22T08:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	what file format are those in?
2009-12-22T08:49:00.000Z	dsnyders	sebsebseb	I don't know.
2009-12-22T08:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	well there is a type of Windows file that can be opended on  Desktop Linux,  there's an article hmm,  I didn't read it properly yet though, so don't know if that's  what your after
2009-12-22T08:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	(in fact I didn't even open the actsaul article up, just read a bit on the site where it was mentioned)
2009-12-22T08:53:00.000Z	dsnyders	sebsebseb	My vista is in a critical error loop.  Upon booting, it gives me an error message and reboots a minute later.  I need something to view the event logs to help diagnose the problem.
2009-12-22T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	you can open .cfm files in Ubuntu, but I don't think that's what your after
2009-12-22T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	are you getting the Blue Screen Of Death?
2010-02-01T08:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	the movie companies have internal Linux software for making movies
2010-06-08T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	some how yeah
2010-06-08T04:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	 well for Virtualbox some how not sure how maybe can find that one out in #vbox  for  VMware well theres VMware convert which can convert a pshyical Windows install into a virtual machine, but last time I tried it
2010-06-08T04:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	it was the size of the partition :(
2010-06-08T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	VMware converter above
2010-06-08T04:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	sebsebseb	Thanks for the pointers.  I suppose I could do a partition resize before attempting a conversion.
2010-06-08T04:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	and then if its XP, you can like set up a hardware profile first, and I guess other versons of Windows.  and then you got  a hardware profile for the pshyical install with its drivers and such,  and  then another for  the virtual machine once your running it as a vm.  I read some webpages and tried  VMware converter about a year or two ago or something.   Why not just do a clean install though of Windows, which is what I assume your
2010-06-08T04:27:00.000Z	dsnyders	sebsebseb	I have some software on the windows partition that I would like to keep, but for which I no longer have the installation media.
2010-06-08T04:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	oh right ok
2010-06-08T04:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsnyders	there is even a way to boot up a pshyicall install of Windows in virtual machine software, but I do not know the details
2010-06-08T04:28:00.000Z	dsnyders	sebsebseb	If it were not for that, I'd wipe and reinstall in a heartbeat.
