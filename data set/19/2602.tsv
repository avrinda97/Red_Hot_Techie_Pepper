2010-02-20T14:56:00.000Z	Mean_admin		I shall!
2010-02-20T14:57:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	(new to the discussion) did you set correct filesystem permissions? (i.e. does the user have read/execute permissions on the shared directory?)
2010-02-20T14:57:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	also check your logs
2010-02-20T14:58:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	for the moment, Im struggling to get win7 to connect to the damned thing at all
2010-02-20T14:58:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	otherwise, there is a smb user ready for it with local user equivalent
2010-02-20T14:59:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	what does your log say?
2010-02-20T15:00:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	did you allow the network to connect?
2010-02-20T15:00:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	log is empty.... log is created for the machine's ip (so there was connection attempt) but the log is just empty...
2010-02-20T15:01:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	you don't have a firewall or anything right?
2010-02-20T15:02:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	sufficient diskspace ... permission to write the logs etc
2010-02-20T15:02:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	also try to increase the amount of logging
2010-02-20T15:03:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	yeah good ide
2010-02-20T15:03:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	I suspect there is NTLMv2 trouble going on
2010-02-20T15:03:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	I read Win7 insists on using only NTLMv2 for auth and Samba isn't quite able to make it so
2010-02-20T15:07:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	some log love finally, at level 2
2010-02-20T15:07:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	[2010/02/20 05:06:13,  2] smbd/sesssetup.c:1360(setup_new_vc_session)
2010-02-20T15:13:00.000Z	candyban	Mean_admin	what was the problem?
2010-02-20T15:14:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	not sure really... I think some old credentials were in memory or something.. I had to reboot the win machine once more and now it connects
2010-02-20T15:15:00.000Z	Mean_admin	candyban	it's working with security = share so I'll see how that goes but if I can upgrade it to security = user, my night would not have been in vain
