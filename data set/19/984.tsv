2011-11-12T18:01:00.000Z	g0th		so the suggestion was to uncomment all other sources and "reload everythign"
2011-11-12T18:02:00.000Z	g0th		what do you mean?
2011-11-12T18:02:00.000Z	g0th		which one?
2011-11-12T18:02:00.000Z	g0th		most of it was cause by the kubuntu update process
2011-11-12T18:03:00.000Z	g0th		I have no idea
2011-11-12T18:04:00.000Z	g0th		the easiest solution would be to reinstall the whole ubuntu
2011-11-12T18:04:00.000Z	g0th		but even this is not so easy for me at the moment
2011-11-12T18:04:00.000Z	g0th		removing everythign?
2011-11-12T18:04:00.000Z	g0th		I am not sure what I should leave on and what not
2011-11-12T18:05:00.000Z	g0th		I was told to use system -> package management etc but I don't know hwo to do that
2011-11-12T18:05:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	btw.. about reinstalling everything.. do you have a separate /home partition?
2011-11-12T18:05:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	then what do you have to back up?
2011-11-12T18:07:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	which is already on a separate partition. So just leave that untouched, backup the few other things, and reinstall
2011-11-12T18:10:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	the encryption key is in your ubuntu keychain, save that somewhere before reinstalling
2011-11-12T18:12:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	did you find your encryption key in the keychain manager?
2011-11-12T18:13:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	Applications > Accessories > Passwords and Encryption keys
2011-11-12T18:14:00.000Z	g0th	apwbdjp	remember my kde desktop is non responsive
2011-11-12T18:21:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	do you see a folder ~/.gnome2/keyrings/ ?
2011-11-12T18:22:00.000Z	apwbdjp	g0th	I use lxde and yet I have it
