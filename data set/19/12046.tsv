2005-10-18T09:28:00.000Z	Nicolinux		hi folks, I just installet latest Ubuntu 5.10 and now upon boot the X server start but the screen goes dark - help I am lost
2005-10-18T09:29:00.000Z	Nicolinux		donethat :)
2005-10-18T09:30:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	please switch to a console and inspect /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2005-10-18T09:31:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	did that too - it detects the card correctly -> radeon mobility 9600 pro
2005-10-18T09:31:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	I've got the feeling that it does akward things with the DST - is this the default now?
2005-10-18T09:33:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	not sure what happened then...you're using fglrx?
2005-10-18T09:33:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	it is the first start after the install
2005-10-18T09:33:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	so, no
2005-10-18T09:34:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to verify it's setup correctly?
2005-10-18T09:34:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	no, good idea thanks - i will do it now
2005-10-18T09:34:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	you might also consider trying to install the fglrx drivers, if you want to
2005-10-18T09:36:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	yes I will try the ati bins but it's a shame that ubuntu chokes on an dell inspiron 8600...
2005-10-18T09:38:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	that's not normal.  You're sure the cd burn was successful?  Did the install seem to go smoothly?
2005-10-18T09:39:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	well burned the iso with a mac (mac os x) and took the n00b install mode. the old ubuntu worked well
2005-10-18T09:40:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	can you check the md5sum of the .iso?
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	good idea again - i will check
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	hm, md5sums differ :/  my file is also called "ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso" and the downloadable ones are called "ubuntu-5.10-rc-install-i386.iso" - damn I took the bittorrent download
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	mrimbert	Nicolinux	you have the right image, but sounds like it's corrupted
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	Nicolinux	mrimbert	on one last check:
