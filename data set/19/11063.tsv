2006-04-01T11:41:00.000Z	TheFaction20		ian_:yeah... i hear u. i heard this was a good starting and even good advanced distro and it was free so not gonna argue. but i might be getting a linux book with other distros on an included disc so who knows
2006-04-01T11:42:00.000Z	TheFaction20		nickgarvey:yeah i wasnt looking at that
2006-04-01T11:42:00.000Z	TheFaction20		fiendskull9:i think thats what i was looking at the other day. not sure tho.  what do u guys think about the linux pocket guide?
2006-04-01T11:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	That the one geared toward Fedora?  I have that.
2006-04-04T09:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Yes, but it will bog down your RAM.
2006-04-08T14:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	My experience?  Partition Magic is c***.  Just use an Ubuntu Live CD.  (I had very poor luck with PM as well.)
2006-04-08T14:46:00.000Z	TheFaction20	tonyyarusso	yeah well im trying to get the xp to run
2006-04-08T14:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Yeah, that's all well and good, just use something else to set up the partitions.  (I'm assuming you've seen the DualBoot wiki page, correct?)
2006-04-08T14:48:00.000Z	TheFaction20	tonyyarusso	well thats not my concern at the moment. i just wanna be able to boot into xp at this point
2006-04-08T14:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Oh, okay.  So your problem then is the bootloader, no?
2006-04-08T14:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Okay.  I just need to get filled in here (I'm sleep deprived and not entirely coherent, so...).  You started with a fresh working XP install, correct?  What have you done since then?
2006-04-08T14:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Do you have install disks for XP?
2006-04-08T14:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	You might try booting that up and running 'fixmbr', and see if it boots correctly after that.
2006-04-08T14:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	If so, breathe a sigh of relief, grab a snack, then come back to the computer after calming down a bit :)
2006-04-08T14:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Apparently you can get a command prompt somewhere in the process of booting those disks.  I've never done that myself, but it's frequently mentioned.
2006-04-08T14:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	After that, when you go ahead with Ubuntu later, forget about PM.  The Ubuntu install CD will do the partitioning perfectly safely, you just have to read the prompts carefully.
2006-04-08T14:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	You can do either.  Read the DualBoot wiki page carefully ahead of time (heck, print it), and you'll be selecting the "Manually edit partition table" option, where you have the power to tell it exactly what you want it to do.
2006-04-08T15:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TheFaction20	Okay.  I may be at dinner, depending on when you return, but I'll be back too, and other people have done this too.
