2005-12-20T16:34:00.000Z	BenUrban		http://rafb.net/paste/results/13rRn726.html <-- any ideas?
2005-12-20T16:35:00.000Z	BenUrban		heh
2005-12-20T16:37:00.000Z	BenUrban		actually it depends on the filesystem
2005-12-20T16:37:00.000Z	BenUrban		hfs/hfs+ are case insensitive
2005-12-20T16:38:00.000Z	BenUrban		:P
2005-12-20T16:39:00.000Z	BenUrban		because it's got the wrong case
2005-12-20T16:39:00.000Z	BenUrban		kdevelop probably does though
2005-12-20T16:40:00.000Z	BenUrban		and so is c
2005-12-20T16:40:00.000Z	BenUrban		:P
2005-12-20T16:42:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	you do realise that's valid C code, don't you?
2005-12-20T16:42:00.000Z	BenUrban	dooglus	it's valid but it won't compile as-is
2005-12-20T16:42:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	you have to define the iNt type, but other than that it's OK.
2005-12-20T16:42:00.000Z	BenUrban	dooglus	that's my point
2005-12-20T16:42:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	like this, for instance: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5798
2005-12-21T10:07:00.000Z	BenUrban	dooglus	you do not have a sata hd unless you know you have one
2005-12-21T10:07:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	OK
2005-12-21T10:08:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	'linux'
2005-12-21T10:09:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	'linux' is a meta-package, but it's probably what you want
2005-12-21T10:09:00.000Z	dooglus	BenUrban	or 'linux-686'
