2008-05-22T06:04:00.000Z	Vedalken	srcw0rm	what is the problem you're having?
2008-05-22T06:07:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	I have this random booting problem, When I select either one of the Ubuntus in the GRUB, I end up in the black screen with the text line blinking and a random letter b and 2 green bars come out of knowhere and nothing happens afterweards
2008-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	Vedalken	srcw0rm	what kind of install did you do?
2008-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	I did a safe graphics mode install.
2008-05-22T06:09:00.000Z	Vedalken	srcw0rm	what is your current hardware (mostly just the mobo,RAM,Video Card, and processor)?
2008-05-22T06:11:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Yeah, I have a ATI RADEON 9250 graphics card, a Intel Celeron 3.0Ghz processor and a dell mobo, my computer is a dell optiplex 320
2008-05-22T06:11:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Nope.
2008-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	I'm pretty sure I burned the CD with the correct ISO image, and I know it's i386, unless I downloaded the wrong one by mistake.
2008-05-22T06:19:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	I didn't install from windows, I installed from the BIOS or the Bootloader
2008-05-22T06:20:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	ok
2008-05-22T06:24:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	I have the normal Ati radeon 9250 256mb
2008-05-22T06:27:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Oh gosh, then I guess I'll stick with Windows.
2008-05-22T06:28:00.000Z	Vedalken	srcw0rm	i can find ATI AGP cards that are supported if you'd like.
2008-05-22T06:28:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	No thanks, Thanks for you help.
2008-05-22T06:30:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Oh well, I guess I'll just stick with Windows from now on...Or is there another Linux that can support my card
2008-05-22T06:33:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Would it be awkward to use 7.10 or something?Because I really want Linux on my computer.
2008-05-22T06:34:00.000Z	Vedalken	srcw0rm	this 8.04 is my first Linux
2008-05-22T06:35:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Oh, well IDK what's the best linux to use for my card.
2008-05-22T06:39:00.000Z	srcw0rm	Vedalken	Do you know any good Linux Distros out there that I can run?
