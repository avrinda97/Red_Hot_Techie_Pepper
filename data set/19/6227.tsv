2008-02-22T04:59:00.000Z	s		my be is its synaptics
2008-02-22T04:59:00.000Z	kellis		s I wasn't aware it was 4-way
2008-02-22T04:59:00.000Z	s		my be???  my guess is it is a synaptics
2008-02-22T05:00:00.000Z	kellis		s So where does that leave me? I've installed gsynaptics before
2008-02-22T05:00:00.000Z	s		i would try to get the synaptics module. but it should work just off the main install as a basic mouse.
2008-02-22T05:01:00.000Z	s		in a word - creek (up a)
2008-02-22T05:01:00.000Z	kellis		s I'll give it another go. Thanks
2008-02-22T05:01:00.000Z	s		sorry wish I could help more.
2008-02-22T05:03:00.000Z	s	kellis	remeber there are other mfg's of touchpads, you might look into those.
2008-02-22T05:03:00.000Z	kellis		s Will do, thanks
2008-02-22T05:06:00.000Z	s	kellis	- if your still her go into vista and see what driver ms is using for the touchpad...
