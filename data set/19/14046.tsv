2005-09-21T16:39:00.000Z	p0windah		well I guess servers need to rest too :)
2005-09-21T16:40:00.000Z	p0windah		ah ha!
2005-09-21T16:41:00.000Z	p0windah		the man types in his sleep :)
2005-09-21T16:41:00.000Z	p0windah		are there any other mirrors around for i386 I could use seveas ?
2005-09-21T16:42:00.000Z	p0windah		I've tried the kanatix and debian ones, but they each have their own problems with breezy
2005-09-21T16:42:00.000Z	p0windah		sweet
2005-09-21T16:43:00.000Z	p0windah		seveas: my thanks, in advance
2005-09-21T16:45:00.000Z	p0windah		is plural vulgarities, ies or ys
2005-09-21T16:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	ies
2005-09-21T16:45:00.000Z	p0windah	thoreauputic	thanks
2005-10-09T14:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	haha - still #ubuntu-offtopic I say :)
2005-10-09T08:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	for the sake of simplicity...
2005-10-09T08:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	which won't work unless he does sudo -i first, BTW
2005-10-09T08:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	or uses echo with a pipe to sudo tee
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	the echo won't work with sudo
2005-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	hence my other remqrks
2005-10-09T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	p0windah	sudo -i is better  an safer
