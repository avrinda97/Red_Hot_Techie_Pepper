2011-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	mcurran		What do you mean 12.04, 11.04 hasn'
2011-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	mcurran		t even come out
2011-04-22T05:12:00.000Z	mcurran		what the hell is unity, some hole in the wall desktop?
2011-04-22T05:12:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	it's a plugin for another window manager, compiz
2011-04-22T05:46:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences
2011-04-22T05:17:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	well that'd mean ditching pretty much all the software that exists now to do it, stuff like wayland aim to make it easy and be different enough for experiments
2011-04-22T05:19:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	the form factor is hardly there yet to actually make use of such a thing though
2011-04-22T05:19:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	it's pretty much al lnetbooks for the forseeable future
2011-04-22T05:21:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	well you can have that already, mostly; but it still comes down to 2d windows and one or more mouse cursors, or touch blobs
2011-04-22T05:24:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	you have to be careful, some filesystems don't leave space for it to be on the partition
2011-04-22T05:36:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	people don't even keep track of their authentication tokens and have a big whine when they can't access the unimportant stuff they decided to encrypt
2011-04-22T05:37:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	well, there's apt preferences and pinning releases; allowing downgrades and the like
2011-04-22T05:37:00.000Z	mcurran	ohsix	are you planning on running multiple services on your box?  what is the need for encryption really?
2011-04-22T05:37:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	i'm not the guy doing it
2011-04-22T05:39:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	it's not going to do it with the information it has, you need to add more with pins, and tell it that it's ok to use downgrades for updates
2011-04-22T05:43:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	btw you could have installed gcc without doing it manually; added it as a source then pinned that pocket as a valid version
2011-04-22T05:44:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	apt pinning is a very very worthwhile thing to know
2011-04-22T05:44:00.000Z	ohsix	mcurran	fyi mint and bt4 aren't supported variants, so if you have a ubuntu question keep that in mind :]
2011-04-22T05:45:00.000Z	mcurran	ohsix	I'm just saying, sorry didn't know I wasn't allowed to chat if I use anything but default ubuntu
