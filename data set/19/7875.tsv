2008-06-28T08:12:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	you have a 8800gt?
2008-06-28T08:13:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	No. 7950 GTX  its on a laptop.
2008-06-28T08:13:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	haaaaa... ok. Maybe give try to nvclock
2008-06-28T08:14:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Ok will do. Thanks
2008-06-28T08:15:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	it's in ubuntu just sudo apt-get install nvclock
2008-06-28T08:16:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Thanks =) I was googling for it lol
2008-06-28T08:30:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Do you use Nvclock?
2008-06-28T08:31:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	yes. I even patched it to report temperature for 8800GT correctely... :)
2008-06-28T08:32:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Cool!
2008-06-28T08:33:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	in fact to report temperature on my desktop, I use Watermark screenlet (which uses nvclock). This is a screenlet I made.
2008-06-28T08:34:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	So you should be able to tell me this. How to bring up gui >< lol All I get is terminal.  Awsome, id like to do that.
2008-06-28T08:35:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	nvclock_gtk
2008-06-28T08:38:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Nice. Watermarks a program that you built?
2008-06-28T08:39:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	Yes. In fact it'S a screenlet which use screenlets framwork to display things on the desktop:  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/WaterMark+system+information?content=71960
2008-06-28T08:42:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Now thats cool!!
2008-06-28T08:43:00.000Z	WalloO	dirtbag	I need to make a nice theme for WaterMark, however I suck in design, and need to find some help to design a small (but major) part of the theme I want to create
2008-06-28T08:50:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Yeah, design is hard.
2008-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	dirtbag	WalloO	Does Watermarks run screenlets, or do screenlets run Watermarks?
