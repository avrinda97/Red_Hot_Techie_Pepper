2012-05-03T03:35:00.000Z	trent_		can anyone tell me how to install this ncurses_5.7+20090803.orig.tar.gz
2012-05-03T03:36:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 that's not an installer package
2012-05-03T03:36:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 are you trying to install the ncurses package, version 5.7+x?
2012-05-03T03:38:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 where are you getting that tarball from?
2012-05-03T03:38:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 isnt that what I asked?
2012-05-03T03:39:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 also, is 5.9 too "new" for what you need, or something?
2012-05-03T03:41:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 i ask again, do you need the older version of that package than what's in current repositories?
2012-05-03T03:41:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 the current version of ncurses5's built binaries is 5.9 in ubuntu precise
2012-05-03T03:42:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 do you need that older version, 5.7?
2012-05-03T03:43:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 are you on a 64bit system?
2012-05-03T03:43:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 rather than pasting a line which i dont particularly care about, can you just answer my question?
2012-05-03T03:47:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 try doing this first: sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch
2012-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 i saw, standby
2012-05-03T04:07:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 did you enable the universe repository?
2012-05-03T04:08:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 ia32-libs-multiarch, the package which installs 32bit libraries on a 64bit system, exists in the universe repository
2012-05-03T04:09:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 one sec
2012-05-03T04:18:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=179  except where it says 'warty' in what you need to change, replace 'warty' with 'precise'
2012-05-03T04:18:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 that'll enable the universe repository, then you can install ia32-libs-multiarch
2012-05-03T04:19:00.000Z	Resistance	trent_	 and sorry for the delay, i'm active right now in about 10 other channels :P
