2009-01-06T02:00:00.000Z	cameron_		i currently use slamd64 i like it but i want to *try* kubuntu so i dont have to compile kde 4 to try it
2009-01-06T02:00:00.000Z	cameron_		ive already wasted 3 disks i just dont want to waste another
2009-01-06T02:00:00.000Z	cameron_		is there any way to use lilo to boot off an iso ?
2009-01-06T02:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	Not lilo, but there is unetbootin
2009-01-06T02:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	You tell it to do a hard drive install and point it to the correct partition
2009-01-06T02:29:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	I guess I don't understand what you're trying to do
2009-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	Unetbootin can be used to install an iso directly to your hard drive, do you have a partition setup for Kubuntu?
2009-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	cameron_	ASULutzy	yes
2009-01-06T02:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	Hold on, I'll see if I can find a decent unetbootin howto
2009-01-06T02:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	Check lubi

2009-01-06T02:52:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cameron_	and there's this on unetbootin: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=427540 tbh I haven't used unetbootin in a while, but I know it can install an iso to a partition
