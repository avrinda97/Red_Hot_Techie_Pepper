2010-05-14T23:37:00.000Z	trumee		guys, i am new to ubuntu and trying to upgrade to mythtv 0.23 following this http://www.mythbuntu.org/auto-builds
2010-05-14T23:38:00.000Z	trumee		i downloaded the http://www.mythbuntu.org/files/mythbuntu-repos.deb file and installed using dpkg -i
2010-05-14T23:39:00.000Z	DCGstudios	trumee	are you using mythbuntu or did you install myth-tv on a normal ubuntu installation?
2010-05-14T23:39:00.000Z	trumee	DCGstudios	normal ubuntu
2010-05-14T23:39:00.000Z	trumee	DCGstudios	i want the 0.23 version of mythtv
2010-05-14T23:40:00.000Z	DCGstudios	trumee	its all up and working already before you upgrade right?
2010-05-14T23:40:00.000Z	trumee	DCGstudios	i am setting up a new frontend, already have backend running on another system
2010-05-14T23:41:00.000Z	DCGstudios	trumee	okay you said you had the deb file already right? doesnt look like its in the repo from what i can see
2010-05-14T23:41:00.000Z	trumee	DCGstudios	i am using this webpage http://www.mythbuntu.org/auto-builds
2010-05-14T23:42:00.000Z	trumee	DCGstudios	guess, that page builds mythtv from upstream every day
2010-05-14T23:42:00.000Z	DCGstudios	trumee	yea interesting i never used this when i set up my mythtv box.. let me take a quick look
2010-05-14T23:42:00.000Z	trumee	DCGstudios	cheers
2010-05-14T23:43:00.000Z	DCGstudios	trumee	you already have the auto builds activated on your system right?
