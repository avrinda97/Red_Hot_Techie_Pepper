2006-10-25T10:47:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Totem-xine has stopped being able to play .wmv files that it could play before. (I have had totem-xine for months and months and it has worked fine until yesterday, when it suddenly stopped being able to play .wmv files. The error it gives is "Video codec 'Windows Media Video 9' is not handled." (or WMV8 or WMV7, etc.) **It was handled OK until now.**) How do I begin to troubleshoot this?
2006-10-25T10:48:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	I can play some wmv9 files and not others.  are you sure it's the same videos that played before and don't play now?
2006-10-25T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	does /usr/lib/win32/wmv9dmod.dll exist?
2006-10-25T10:50:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	 yes, wmv9dmod.dll is there
2006-10-25T10:50:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	does mplayer play the files?
2006-10-25T10:51:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	- checking
2006-10-25T10:52:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	- yes, mplayer plays the .wmv files I've been using as tests
2006-10-25T10:53:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	heh.  that's all the help I can be, then - I'm an mplayer guy.  I was hoping maybe they had the same problem, and if I debugged mplayer it would fix totem/xine
2006-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	 you've solved my immediate problem, at any rate
2006-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	I do.  mplayer 4 life, and stuff.
2006-10-25T10:58:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	you get gmplayer for free except by installing mplayer-nogui
2006-10-25T11:06:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	or soundray or anyone who knows mplayer and gmplayer: gmplayer doesn't want to run but mplayer works. could use some help solving the gmplayer problem so I can be a happy mplayer dude too
2006-10-25T11:07:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	I don't use gmplayer :)   it gives me problems all the time.  I just learn the keyboard shortcuts from `man mplayer` and I'm happy with mplayer-nogui
2006-10-25T11:08:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	I wish gmplayer were more reliable - there are some pretty nice skins for it and stuff.  but it gives me too many problems.
2006-10-25T11:09:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	or soundray - Is there a way to set up nautilus s.t. it starts mplayer when I double-click a movie file?
2006-10-25T11:10:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	probably, but I also don't use nautilus :)  you want to set up your file associations, however that's done in gnome
2006-10-25T11:10:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	trappist	 somehow I expected that! :) you're CLI all the way?
2006-10-25T11:11:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	no, I set up my file associations in kde - but I do mostly use mplayer from the console.  gf is not interested in that though, so I try to keep the gui up to speed too.
2006-10-25T11:13:00.000Z	trappist	Nutubuntu	a peripheral device that comes with no drivers and no manual, and mostly exists to cost money
