2008-12-28T16:17:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	you probably wanted to address zephyr34 instead of zetheroo
2008-12-28T16:17:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	roger on that.
2009-01-30T02:29:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	dbus is an OS internal "messaging" system, that file is a directory (I suppose) but I would expect it to be owned by you, not root
2009-01-30T02:31:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	ok, I'm trying to archive my home directory, and it is aborting on permission denied .dbus?
2009-01-30T02:32:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	and Nautilus doesn't even list it, I had to use ls -al.
2009-01-30T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	I'm not sure but have you started a GUI application (gedit,...) with sudo instead of gksu?
2009-01-30T02:33:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	yes, but not recently.
2009-01-30T02:35:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	in you homedir: sudo chown -vR <your user> .dbus
2009-01-30T02:39:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	I'm familiar with gksudo, and it's use. What can I do about the .dbus file?
2009-01-30T02:40:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	as I wrote before: in your homedir: sudo chown -vR <your user> .dbus
2009-01-30T02:41:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	sorry, missed that, thanks.
2009-01-30T02:41:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	np, I hope it works for you :)
2009-01-30T02:53:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	it worked
2009-01-30T02:54:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	glad :), I'll remember it for the future
2009-06-19T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	type fuser -m <path to your flash drive>
2009-06-19T01:40:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	have you figured it out?
2009-06-19T01:41:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	what does "fuser -m <path to your flash drive>" tell you?
2009-06-19T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	n2diy	open another terminal, and look again with fuser -m
2009-06-19T01:43:00.000Z	n2diy	guntbert	doing that now.
