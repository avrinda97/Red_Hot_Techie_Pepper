2009-02-25T00:27:00.000Z	ibuclaw	lenswipe	ideally, you would increase the "Periods/Buffer" and decrease the "Frames/Period" in a linear sort of fashion, if your soundcard supports
2009-02-25T00:27:00.000Z	lenswipe	ibuclaw	how an where???
2009-02-25T00:28:00.000Z	ibuclaw	lenswipe	do you use JACK Control?
2009-02-25T00:28:00.000Z	lenswipe	ibuclaw	sudo apt-get jack control?
2009-02-25T00:28:00.000Z	ibuclaw	lenswipe	sudo apt-get install qjackctl

2009-02-25T00:32:00.000Z	ibuclaw	lenswipe	once installed, go into Applications -> Sound+Video -> JACK Control
2009-02-25T00:32:00.000Z	lenswipe	ibuclaw	ok so i got jack control installed and when i ran it from terminal it opened but i got a message saying "Warning: no locale found: /usr/share/locale/qjackctl_en_GB.qm"

2009-02-25T00:33:00.000Z	lenswipe	ibuclaw	ok, btw jack being a server if i set it up right could other machines connect to the jack server and hear the sound on it?
2009-02-25T00:33:00.000Z	lenswipe	ibuclaw	just a matter of interest :)
2009-02-25T00:34:00.000Z	ibuclaw	lenswipe	that is a very good question. I have never tried that myself, so I'd have to look it up first though
