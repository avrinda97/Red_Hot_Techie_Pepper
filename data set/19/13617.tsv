2005-06-07T11:32:00.000Z	levander	danko123456	#debian's prolly just like that cause communities develop personalities.
2005-06-07T11:33:00.000Z	danko123456	levander	I have a more developed theory, thanks.
2005-06-07T11:33:00.000Z	levander	danko123456	think that's more of a sociological / human behavior question than anything else
2005-06-07T11:34:00.000Z	levander	danko123456	it's an old stereotype with some of the computer geeks, usually applied to dba's, that people don't like explaining stuff to everybody
2005-06-07T11:34:00.000Z	levander	danko123456	that's what I think of when in ##java and #php
2005-06-07T11:34:00.000Z	danko123456	levander	it is deeper than that on #debian... but, I dont wanna go into it more now, I have to wait till issues get sorted out.
2005-06-07T12:01:00.000Z	danko123456	levander	what kind of cd?
