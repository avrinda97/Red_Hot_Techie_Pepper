2006-08-01T08:07:00.000Z	Zambezi		Is it risky to use: chmod u+rw /mnt/harddrive2 ?
2006-08-01T08:08:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	no, but without -R /mnt/harddrive2/. it won't do anything
2006-08-01T08:08:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	unless you are trying to chmod the mount point, which won't do what you are thinking it will
2006-08-01T08:09:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	May I explain in PM what I want to achive?
2006-08-01T08:09:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	sure, but if you explain here you'll get just as good an answer, and if I make a mistake someone will flag it.
2006-08-01T08:11:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	I need to make folders without sudo. I'm going to put the harddrive in a computer without X. And I want to transfer files to the harddrive via LAN and I can't to that if I make folders with sudo.
2006-08-01T08:13:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	ok, then it makes sense, but only _after_ the thing is mounted.
2006-08-01T08:14:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	It mounted now and then I try to make a folder it says I don't have access so I need to use sudo. :-(
2006-08-07T09:53:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	that's (about xchat) absurd
2006-08-07T09:54:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	besides, you can run any IRC client on ubuntu, not just xchat
2006-08-07T09:56:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	I will try Irssi later when I have more energy. It's a little bit tricky because I have BNC.
2006-08-07T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	I have no problem with xchat.  I'm just saying that the comment about the safety of ubuntu, relating it to xchat, is nonsense
2006-08-07T09:58:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	Thanks for saying that. It's my 7th week so I'm failrly new. And if somebody says I thing, I won't argue cause I don't talk about things I don't know of.
2006-08-07T09:59:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	 I wasn't being critical of you, I was annoyed at whoever made the remark originally, because, in addition to being wrong, it's ignorant.
2006-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	I wasn't either. It really feelt like a relief that you "confirmed" that the guy is a nut and just talking crap.
2006-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	I know.
2006-11-19T17:47:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	check the ssh config files in /tec
2006-11-19T17:47:00.000Z	sethk	Zambezi	/etc, that is
2006-11-19T17:48:00.000Z	Zambezi	sethk	I'll have a look. Thanks.
