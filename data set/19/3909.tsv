2010-10-22T15:05:00.000Z	angelete2		i have a server with a motherboard Intel S875WP1-E
2010-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	angelete2		i have 4 HD and i've set up hardware RAID 1+0
2010-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	angelete2		but now i don't know how to install ubuntu server using this raid array. Any help?
2010-10-22T15:07:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	dont use fakeraid
2010-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	angelete2	iceroot	installing from cd, how do i avoid this?
2010-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	why you want fakeraid? what about software-raid?
2010-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	angelete2	iceroot	maybe performance?
2010-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	lol
2010-10-22T15:09:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	fakeraid is a software-raid, only using the cpu but with disadvantages aganainst a real software-raid
2010-10-22T15:09:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	or is it a real hardware-raid? if so, there is no special task in ubuntu to do
2010-10-22T15:10:00.000Z	angelete2	iceroot	it's a real hardware-raid, i've created it on bios setup. Now when i try to install ubuntu i can view 4 disk instead of one only device
2010-10-22T15:11:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	if you can see 4 disks, its not hardware-raid
2010-10-22T15:11:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	hardware-raid is transparent to the os, so the os is only seeing one array
2010-10-22T15:11:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	fakeraid is raid using an onboard controller but only doing it with software-raid
2010-10-22T15:12:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	real hardware-raid is not using the cpu, transparent to the os and the controller costs ~180â‚¬
2010-10-22T15:13:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	google is telling that it is fakeraid
2010-10-22T15:14:00.000Z	iceroot	angelete2	so dont use that cr*p controller, build a software-raid by your own
2010-10-22T15:45:00.000Z	angelete2	iceroot	another question about raid, i want to configure raid5 for my partitions, do i set 4 partitions as active for any raid device or should i set 3 active and 1 free?
