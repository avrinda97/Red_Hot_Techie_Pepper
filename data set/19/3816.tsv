2009-05-22T18:55:00.000Z	pietje		hello all, I have a problem using ubuntu 9.04, it hangs verry often. Sometimes its just 1 program that hangs, and sometimes every thing hangs. The screen greyes out, and I have to wait about 10 seconds.
2009-05-22T18:56:00.000Z	pietje		does somebody know how to solve that problam
2009-05-22T18:56:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	lenny doesn't do it
2009-05-22T18:56:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	what do you mean?
2009-05-22T18:56:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	I'm saying: switch over to debian lenny
2009-05-22T18:57:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	isn't there another way? do you know what is causing that problem?
2009-05-22T18:58:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	i've got no idea; ubuntu works just fine on my computer
2009-05-22T18:58:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	you should be more specific though
2009-05-22T19:00:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	I don't know what more to say.. I'll give an example: I'm using firefox, and all of the sudden firefox hangs, and the complete firefox screen turns grey, but I can still use other programms. And after about 10 seconds, it comes back to live. But I'm certain it is not a firefox problem, because I have the exact same problem with every program
2009-05-22T19:02:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	what about other apps; is is just firefox? and if so, when it happens?
2009-05-22T19:03:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	no it isn't just firefox, it happens with about every app.. And I'm not doing anything special when it happens.
2009-05-22T19:03:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	thats why I'm so puzzeld
2009-05-22T19:04:00.000Z	pietje		puzzeled
2009-05-22T19:04:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	have you seen the logs?
2009-05-22T19:05:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	nope, I must say I'm a bit of a beginner with linux, what log should I check?
2009-05-22T19:06:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	seems like you must do some reading
2009-05-22T19:08:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	I think I should check the syslog right?
2009-05-22T19:08:00.000Z	rizet	pietje	exactly
2009-05-22T19:10:00.000Z	pietje	rizet	I'm tailing the syslog now, I'll and when some app hangs again, I'll be back
