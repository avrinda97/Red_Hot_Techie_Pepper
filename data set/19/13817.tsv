2005-01-24T11:03:00.000Z	dr_willis		BeOs did some very neat things right.. and i found some things very wrong.. but its all sort of moot in many ways. :(
2005-01-24T11:04:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	it did two things wrong:  poor net stack, and not multiuser.
2005-01-24T11:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 tjhere was other 'little' bits i hated also.
2005-01-24T11:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 but every os/pc/tool has its issues in one way or another.
2005-05-29T06:50:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	congrats.  you just paid too much for hardware.
2005-06-01T12:50:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	no it's not.
2005-06-01T12:50:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	why do you think qwerty is so terribly laid out?!
2005-06-02T12:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 could chmod it :P  or back it up and restore it every login.
2005-06-02T12:48:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	i think i chmodded and that still didn't work.
2005-06-02T12:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 Hmm  My menu have the name of the program...
2005-06-02T12:50:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	no way.
2005-06-02T12:50:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	 look in accessories.
2005-06-02T12:55:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	name one way in which it was weird?
2005-06-02T12:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 i do belive that if you drag folder foo, onto say folder bar.. and there was a 'foo' allready with files in it.. it would basicially DELETE the existing folder.
2005-06-02T12:56:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	 no it would ask
2005-06-02T12:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 ie; it dident sort of merge folders when  copying.  It dident ask me when i did it ages ago. :P
2005-06-02T12:56:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	beos tracker was the slickest thing ever.
2005-11-19T12:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	BROKEN_LADDER	 could install it as a user.. then as root copy the files over.. and change the owensrship
2005-11-19T12:39:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	dr_willis	but then how to i install it so that theme manager sees it?
