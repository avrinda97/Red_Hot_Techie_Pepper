2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	why?
2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	waste of space
2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	if you're swaping that much, you're running too much stuff
2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	bcoz i read somewhere that swapfile works as physical ram for linux
2007-05-01T11:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	it works just like a paging file works in any OS
2007-05-01T11:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	the "when to swap" is a bit different, nothing near as stupid as windows
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	Mem:       2066820     908720    1158100          0     118536     373612
2007-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	my old 1GB ram server hsa 1.25 GB of swap. .it's using < 20MB right now
2007-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	i got plenty of space to give so i did it, But if you are insisting that much then i will change it to?
2007-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	eh, if it works for you, why bother changing it :)
2007-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	look at things like 'free' to see swap usage
2007-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	and 'vmstat 1' to see if you are swapping a lot
2007-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	bcoz i am not running that much stuff,only using it as a desktop pc
2007-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	SuperQ	numan	look at the si/so (swap-in/swap-out) columns in vmstat
2007-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	its all zeros
2007-05-01T11:56:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	its still running maybe refreshing continuosly?
2007-05-01T12:01:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	?
2007-05-01T12:12:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	i was looking for you
2007-05-01T12:13:00.000Z	numan	SuperQ	i got all the zeros
