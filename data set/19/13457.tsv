2005-03-31T07:00:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC		Wow, #wireless is a REAL help...its practically dead in there
2005-03-31T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	would you quickly recap what probs with wireless?
2005-03-31T07:03:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	My only connection to the Internet is wireless.  It works on windows which is what I'm using now.  ath_pci and ath_hal are loaded modules, hardware configure shows that I have an Atheros AR5212 802.11abg NIC (rev 01)...
2005-03-31T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	does ,,ifconfig ath0'' return anything?
2005-03-31T07:06:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	there is no ath0
2005-03-31T07:10:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	presuming you're in the socal area?
2005-03-31T07:11:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	I live on a Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, CA (by Palm Springs)
2005-03-31T07:11:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	(otherwise you may have needed to pass additional parameters to modprobe ath-pci if you're outside the USA)
2005-03-31T07:12:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	ok, bear with me, please lsmod|grep ^ati_pci
2005-03-31T07:12:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	err, lsmod|grep ^ath_pci
2005-03-31T08:06:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	just to check, is the wireless adapter enabled in bios?
2005-03-31T08:06:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	how do you check that?
2005-03-31T08:06:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	check in bios to see if it's enabled
2005-03-31T08:06:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	I'll check in a sec
2005-03-31T10:17:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	/dev/sda is the device.  The partition will be /dev/sda1 if you've formatted it.
2005-03-31T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	what filesystem would you like to use?
2005-03-31T10:21:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	fat so i can switch between linux and windows
2005-03-31T10:33:00.000Z	SeeleyUSMC	crimsun	my atheros AR212 is supposed to work right out of the box too.. but look where i am
2005-03-31T10:34:00.000Z	crimsun	SeeleyUSMC	did you ever see if it's enabled in bios?
