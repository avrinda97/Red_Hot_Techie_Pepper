2009-07-05T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	you have ubuntu as host, xp as guest?
2009-07-05T02:09:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	and you say virtualbox doesn't support bluetooth in its VMs?
2009-07-06T01:49:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	it should be there already
2009-07-06T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	go to applications/Terminal
2009-07-06T01:51:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	then the terminal starts, doesn't it?
2009-07-06T01:52:00.000Z	omr	guntbert	ya it's started
2009-07-06T01:52:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	ok then?

2009-07-06T01:54:00.000Z	guntbert	omr	when you start gnome-terminal you get a shell, right?
