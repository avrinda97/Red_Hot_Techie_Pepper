2007-07-04T07:34:00.000Z	iphv37		<for EVERYONE!> "An error occurred!! Could not open location; You may not have permission to open the file."
2007-07-04T07:36:00.000Z	iphv37		HOW do i solve this problem with video streaming? "Could not open location; You may not have permission to open the file."
2007-07-04T07:37:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	try using sudo or gksudo and see if that helps
2007-07-04T07:38:00.000Z	iphv37	mongolai	it's not possible because i'm not using the terminal to open the video!
2007-07-04T07:39:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	try gksudo *programname* and then use the program to try to open the stream
2007-07-04T07:41:00.000Z	iphv37	mongolai	but why it starts to show this error while i used this way without problems?
2007-07-04T07:41:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	I don't know. Are you opening a locally-stored file ?
2007-07-04T07:50:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	is it a local-file stream, or an internet stream?
2007-07-04T07:50:00.000Z	iphv37	mongolai	internet stream!
2007-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	Glad to hear it!
2007-07-04T08:19:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	sorry, but the recent flood seems to have destroyed my scroll-back buffer. What was your problem again?
2007-07-04T08:20:00.000Z	iphv37	mongolai	the video i'm trying to open from a site is showing an error!
2007-07-04T08:21:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	Oh, that's right. Is it a problem with the video itself?
2007-07-04T08:22:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	what's the link?
2007-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	iphv37	mongolai	some links work, and other don't..
2007-07-04T08:29:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	can you send me a link that does, and one that doesn't
2007-07-04T08:32:00.000Z	iphv37	mongolai	mms://win40nj.audiovideoweb.com/avwebdsnjwin4292/mark2leve.wmv
2007-07-04T08:36:00.000Z	mongolai	iphv37	I opened the first link fine in VLC. Perhaps try using that. It's a better player, IMO
