2005-09-10T08:27:00.000Z	chombee		Hello - can anyone send me a sample sources.list file for Breezy? I tried replacing Hoary with Breezy in sources.list but no good, synaptic can't find a single repository now
2005-09-10T08:27:00.000Z	chombee		Ahh... is Breezy case-sensitive?
2005-09-10T08:28:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	all of *nix is case senstive
2005-09-10T08:29:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- that's an exageration, I could write a linux program and make it case-insensitive if I wanted
2005-12-30T13:16:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- do you know if some extra package has to be installed? Whenever I resize an ntfs partition nothing happens
2005-12-30T13:20:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	use g- or qt- parted, it's self-explanatory
2005-12-30T13:21:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- I have been trying GParted, it goes ahead and resizes the partition, doesn't give any errors, but afterwards the pertition hasn't changed
2005-12-30T13:21:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	try qtparted
2005-12-30T13:22:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- ok, installing it
2005-12-30T13:25:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- QtParted doesn't even detect the disk, it's a SATA device at /dev/sda, it's looking at /dev/hda
2005-12-30T13:26:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	sounds like a dodgy controller. have you tried this from a liveCD, perhaps?
2005-12-30T13:27:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- yes i am in a livecd now
2005-12-30T13:27:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- is that a problem?
2005-12-30T13:27:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	have you tried from a LiveCD?
2005-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- yeah, that's what I'm trying
2005-12-30T14:07:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	burn`bath - in the end I just ran the installer and resized the partition manually with that. I think the installer may use ntfsresize. For the record, if ppl want to resize ntfs partitions the easiest way may to boot the installer, resize it, then abort the install
2005-12-30T14:08:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	i've used qtparted and gparted to resize ntfs and not had any problems (we are discussing millions of permutations of hardware, tho)
2005-12-30T14:09:00.000Z	chombee	johndarkhorse	- it's strange, this is the second machine on which GParted didn't work for me
2005-12-30T14:10:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	chombee	gparted was late in the game getting ntfsprogs support, which is why i prefer using (and recommending qtparted for ntfs work)
