2006-01-17T12:23:00.000Z	d33t		ah well, one last shot on my question.....
2006-01-17T12:24:00.000Z	d33t		anyone know how to specify a logon username when connecting to a samba server from windows?
2006-01-17T12:24:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	man mount
2006-01-17T12:25:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	sorry, i read the Q backwards
2006-01-17T12:26:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	in XP it can be a pain... try right-clicking on the server in the network neighborhood
2006-01-17T12:26:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	somewhere in there is an option to 'connect as' or 'authenticate as'
2006-01-17T12:27:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	so it is a windows problem, nothing i can change on the server side?
2006-01-17T12:29:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	i'm not sure.  What I do know is that once XP connects once to a server, specially if it's mapped to a drive, it won't ask for a username password by default.  it'll just fail to mount.
2006-01-17T12:29:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	hrm. well, now xp seems to not want to connect to anything or even see the workgroup. windows is so lame!
2006-01-17T12:29:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	it's just as well, i shoudl sleep soon
2006-01-17T12:29:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	thanks
2006-01-17T12:30:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	if you try to connect with a brand new xp user-profile though, and right-click instead of double-clicking, it should give an option to change username
2006-01-17T12:30:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	ok, i'll check it out once i can see the server again
2006-01-17T12:30:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	worst come to worst, mount it from cygwin :-p
2006-01-17T12:30:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	heh, sygwin woudl work in theory, but i want it to be seemless; that and i've never gotten cygwin to work right..... it's quicker to fdisk and install linux :)
2006-01-17T12:31:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	i'll give the right click a shot though, thanks again
2006-01-17T12:31:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	yeah i was kidding.  I did a fresh install of cygmwin about 6 ms ago and it was prefict
2006-01-17T12:31:00.000Z	shadowplay	d33t	perfect.
2006-01-17T12:32:00.000Z	d33t	shadowplay	off to sleep, take care
