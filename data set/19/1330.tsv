2011-05-26T07:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	install openssh-server and you will get an SFTP server you can put files on
2011-05-26T07:14:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	what is the capacity of that SFTP server
2011-05-26T07:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	as much space as your drives have
2011-05-26T07:15:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	Does this feature show it all as individual drives or does it appear as one big drive, if indivdual can it be made to appear as one large drive?
2011-05-26T07:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	it will appear just as your filesystem does now, with access defined using the UNIX permissions in place, usually users get dropped in their $HOME folders
2011-05-26T07:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	you can control data storage by enforcing disk quotas
2011-05-26T07:17:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	Will I have to use the command line to accesss files? ie ls /media and then finding things manually or does it have a gui?
2011-05-26T07:19:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	What I mean is are the files in OpenSSH got icons or long lines of text like you see on the command line.
2011-05-26T07:20:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	Im very interested in this form of storage
2011-05-26T07:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	you can mount the sshfs in nautilus and it will act like a local folder
2011-05-26T07:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	just like when you mount anything
2011-05-26T07:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	you can access it over WAN too as it uses the security in SSH
2011-05-26T07:22:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	What im looking for is storage solution that i can access locally via usb 3.0, my own network or anywhere in the world.
2011-05-26T07:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	if you port forward TCP port 22 to the server, you can access it at any time from anywhere
2011-05-26T07:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	if you want a hardware thing then it is outside the scope of the channel
2011-06-04T19:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	click your name, then select it at the bottom
2011-06-06T21:14:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	How hard is it to get the source code from a .tar.gz file and "make" it?
2011-07-20T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Psydoll	close software center
2011-07-20T22:38:00.000Z	Psydoll	ActionParsnip	ikonia i closed it now i get ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install libdvdread4
