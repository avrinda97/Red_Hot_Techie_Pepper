2010-02-18T07:30:00.000Z	Daughain		I have a few questions about 3G radios under linux and what can be done with them....Is there a way to access the phone number assigned to the card by the carrier and use it to place and receive phone calls?
2010-02-18T07:31:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	your service provider probably specifically disallows that kind of usage, and may not even allow calls to be routed to the device
2010-02-18T07:32:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	Probbaly, but, I still want to try. =) You would be surprised what backdoors there are if you look.
2010-02-18T07:33:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	given what i know from my previous employer, a major US telecom and cell phone provider, i'd say there's no chance you could get it working with them, anyway :)
2010-02-18T07:34:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	Well, wth the proper mopds on my BB, I have full net access and dont pay for a data plan at all. So, I still want to experiment.
2010-02-18T07:35:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	i believe that - but i don't think that a data-only device is provisioned the same way as a voice device with data capability is
2010-02-18T07:35:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	I'm going to be using a sim designated for both voice and data to begin with.
2010-02-18T07:36:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	oh well in that case, you can probably get that working - i was assuming your sim was only for a data device
2010-02-18T07:36:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	i was thinking the restriction would be the provisioning on the carrier end
2010-02-18T07:36:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	I'm going to try both, ultimately, but....The first attempt is not data only.
2010-02-18T07:37:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	look into the openmoko project - there might be some software for the 3g radio that you can look at that's somewhat relevant
2010-02-18T07:37:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	Thanks for the start. =)
2010-02-18T07:39:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	no problem :)
2010-02-18T08:29:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	they probably only look at people who are using almost 5gb per month
2010-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	One of these days I;d like to pick your brain on carrier end filters for data networks.
2010-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	i don't have a whole lot of specialized knowledge about the phone network - i worked in the it services division
2010-02-18T08:28:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Daughain	know this: deep packet inspection is real, and it's used in industry
2010-02-18T08:28:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	Ah......Hmmmm.....Wonder why I havent been tagged for my net access yet. Been doing it for years.
2010-02-18T08:30:00.000Z	Daughain	mgmuscari	Could be....I dopnt get close to that...
