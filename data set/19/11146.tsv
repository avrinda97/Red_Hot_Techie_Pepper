2006-04-14T12:08:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	and we're just trying to get a path, as to where you put your index.html file
2006-04-26T14:08:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	no
2006-04-26T14:08:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	just the meta package
2006-04-26T14:08:00.000Z	jadaz87	FlannelKing	how do i get rid of gnome?
2006-04-29T06:49:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	if you've got a 686 proccessor
2006-04-29T06:50:00.000Z	jadaz87	FlannelKing	what whould it do (btw i have a Mobile Pentium 4 2.66)
2006-04-29T06:50:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	it allows the kernel to use commands that are 686 specific, not 386 only.
2006-04-29T06:52:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	it won't hurt anything.  And you definately shouldn't uninstall it until you've rebooted into 686, and ran it for a few days (to make sure you don't have problems)
2006-04-29T07:06:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	eh? you switch at the login screen itself.  Itll be under the session tab thing.  If you want to use kdm (kde display manager) as opposed to gdm (those both are the login screen things) then youll have to reconfigure that
2006-04-29T07:07:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	I dont know, I haven't used a display manager in ages
2006-04-29T07:07:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	theres a script for it though, itll ask what you want to use
2006-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	you really don't have to switch, you can still use gdm with KDe, and vv.
2006-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	FlannelKing	jadaz87	heh.
