2009-07-04T23:30:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	go to System->Preferences->Sessions. Click Add and type in a name (it doesn't matter what) and the terminal command you want to run at startup
2009-07-04T23:32:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	the thing is I only know how to do that from the GUI, not from command line
2009-07-04T23:33:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	hold on, I think I know the command...
2009-07-04T23:35:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	try "sudo nvidia-settings" restart your session, come back here if it doesn't work
2009-07-04T23:35:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	take out sudo
2009-07-04T23:42:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	nvidia-settings pops up the GUI
2009-07-04T23:43:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	here's the issue: I won't have a screen connected to it, just s-video output to my TV
2009-07-04T23:43:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	Oh, so you want the default video out to be to s-video?
2009-07-04T23:45:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	now, everytime I restart it disables the TV screen and I have to set it up every time I restart
2009-07-04T23:45:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	gimme a minute, I'll try to find something.
2009-07-04T23:46:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	thanks :)
2009-07-04T23:48:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	where in nvidia-settings are the options you want to enable?
2009-07-04T23:50:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	X Server Display Configuration
2009-07-04T23:50:00.000Z	shesek	Apollo2366	than I select TV-OUT, configure, set to "twin view"
2009-07-04T23:51:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	after you set those, did you click "Save to X Configuration File" ?
2009-07-04T23:52:00.000Z	Apollo2366	shesek	ok, if it doesn't work, be sure to come back here. =)
