2010-09-03T20:25:00.000Z	kishon1		i have .bin file which I mount as a file system using mount -t ext2 -o loop rd-ext2 mountpoint/ for which i want to increase the size..
2010-09-03T20:25:00.000Z	kishon1		how do i increase it;s size
2010-09-03T20:26:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	First, you need to increase the size of the file by adding 0s to the end, then use resize2fs.
2010-09-03T20:26:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	how much bigger do you want to make it?
2010-09-03T20:27:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	Yeah probably quickest to just create a new file. You know how to make one yourself or you need instructions?
2010-09-03T20:28:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	Alright. Open a terminal
2010-09-03T20:29:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	type "dd if=/dev/zero of=newe2image.bin bs=1024 count=24578"
2010-09-03T20:30:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	that will give you a blank 24MB file... After that's done we format it with mke2fs using "mke2fs newe2image.bin"
2010-09-03T20:31:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	When the formatting is done, you can mount both the new image file, and the old one, and transfer the files to the new one
2010-09-03T20:38:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	Ah, hold on.. I Missed the rd-ext2 part... gimme a minute to check that out. I'm not sure what that's for.
2010-09-03T20:41:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	Try using "mke2fs -m0 newe2image.bin"?
2010-09-03T20:44:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	can you run dumpe2fs on the old disk so I can see what parameters it was created with?
2010-09-03T20:45:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	post the output of dumpe2fs to pastebin and paste the link here
2010-09-03T20:48:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	Double check the dd command. Make sure you got the numbers right, because 24MB should be enough to create the fs with default parameters.
2010-09-03T20:49:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	I see nothing odd about the params on the 16mb file
2010-09-03T20:50:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	that command would make it 24 KB, not 24 MB
2010-09-03T20:50:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	Change the 1k to 1M and try again
2010-09-03T20:53:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	All good then?
2010-09-03T20:53:00.000Z	undecim	kishon1	ok
