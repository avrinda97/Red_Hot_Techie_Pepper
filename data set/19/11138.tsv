2006-03-25T14:08:00.000Z	ompaul	misterii	well it ain't windows so the concept of registry does not work
2006-03-25T14:10:00.000Z	misterii	ompaul	I know... But something.... There is no registry in linux as such, but still I'm getting an already removed app haunting
2006-03-25T14:11:00.000Z	ompaul	misterii	well if you used >>apt-get remove --purge packagename<< if it was a deb it should clean up anything that has been changed
2006-03-25T15:30:00.000Z	ompaul	misterii	system - administration - disks that should find that for you - also you need data in the drive
2006-03-26T12:56:00.000Z	ompaul	misterii	there are over 600 here
2006-03-26T12:56:00.000Z	misterii	ompaul	anyone helping me?
2006-03-26T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	misterii	launch synaptic and it will do all that for you just go play with settings
2006-03-26T13:02:00.000Z	misterii	ompaul	I wanna do it manually
2006-03-26T13:04:00.000Z	ompaul	misterii	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list enable lines with universe by removing leading # in the line with #deb .... universe and then type the word multiverse at the end of the line
