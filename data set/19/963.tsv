2011-07-04T02:38:00.000Z	potatoes_		Hello! I'm trying to run Ubuntu Customization Kit to build a customized Ubuntu (i.e. only with the apps/features I want) using the Ubuntu Mini remix as the 'source'. I'm having some troubles though...is anyone willing to take a bit and see if they can help me out? (warning: I'm an Ubuntu newbie)
2011-07-04T02:40:00.000Z	potatoes_		Has anyone here used Ubuntu Customization Kit before?
2011-07-04T02:40:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	ask your real question
2011-07-04T02:41:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	it's really specific, I'm stuck at this one point using UCK...it gives me three options, 1) select a package manager, 2) console something, etc.
2011-07-04T02:41:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	when I select option 1, it says there's no package manager installed...
2011-07-04T02:41:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	ok so what's your problem? more details are required on what you actually need help with
2011-07-04T02:42:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	also see the links that ubottu posted
2011-07-04T02:42:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	alright!
2011-07-04T02:45:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	now that I read that link on remastering, I think it might not be quite what I want - because I don't have a concrete list of all the apps I want to add/remove - basically, what I'm looking for is a super 'slim' version of Ubuntu that just has the bare minimum of apps, so that I can then go on to add apps on an as needed basis
2011-07-04T02:47:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	ubuntu-server with a GUI? :-)
2011-07-04T02:48:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/minimal
2011-07-04T02:48:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	ahh! let me check that out :)
2011-07-04T02:48:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	it's already been done numerous times so I wouldn't suggest doing something that has already been done, unless you really need too
2011-07-04T02:49:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	yeah, I see what you mean.
2011-07-04T02:49:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	you can still use the minimal setup as a base, install packages and then re-create your own flavour of ubuntu
2011-07-04T02:50:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	sweet, I think this is exactly what I was looking for
2011-07-04T02:50:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	also this link for the download https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2011-07-04T02:50:00.000Z	potatoes_	io	Nice, thanks a lot for this suggestion!
2011-07-04T02:50:00.000Z	io	potatoes_	no problem
