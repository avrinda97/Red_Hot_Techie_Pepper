2005-10-13T09:25:00.000Z	mvhenten		If I try to remove the gcc base, it says I have to remove practically all of ubuntu....
2005-10-13T09:26:00.000Z	mvhenten		I want to downgrade to gcc 3.4
2005-10-13T09:26:00.000Z	mvhenten		The thing is, there's no gcc left on my system at all
2005-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	mvhenten		everytime I try to install 3.4 it allows me to do so in synaptic, goes trough all the movements, but... no gcc installed
2005-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	mvhenten		no
2005-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	mvhenten		well,
2005-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	mvhenten		I want gcc 3.4 to be my default, that's all
2005-10-13T09:27:00.000Z	mvhenten		it's not very practical to have 2 versions of gcc on the system when you only use one of them!
2005-10-13T09:28:00.000Z	mvhenten		what is updatedb?
2005-10-13T09:28:00.000Z	mvhenten		no, me neither
