2007-06-04T07:37:00.000Z	doctorow	Tom47	I don't want to disable Slow Keys. I want to disable the shortcut for turning Slow Keys on. That shortcut will activate EVEN IF Slow Keys is disabled.
2007-06-04T07:37:00.000Z	Tom47	doctorow	no you can turn it off altogether
2007-06-04T07:37:00.000Z	doctorow	Tom47	Do you know which line?

2007-06-04T07:38:00.000Z	doctorow	Tom47	It is not a package. It's part of another package -- and I don't know which one. Searching Synaptic for Slow Keys returns no results

2007-06-04T07:42:00.000Z	doctorow	Tom47	Adept says it's installed but it's not in my list of programs -- do you know which menu it lives under? Or how to invoke it from terminal?
2007-06-04T07:42:00.000Z	Tom47		Applications > System Tools
2007-06-04T07:43:00.000Z	doctorow	Tom47	I don't have a System Tools -- I'm using Kubuntu. I have  Settings, System and Utilities
