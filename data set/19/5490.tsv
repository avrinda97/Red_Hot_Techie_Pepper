2008-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	TiZ_		Then you probably don't need any restricted drivers.
2008-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	TiZ_		Um...
2008-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	TiZ_		Look for VGA Compatible Controller
2008-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	TiZ_		Then you have an intel video card. I'm sorry. :P
2008-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	TiZ_		But on the bright side, you don't need proprietary drivers for it.
2008-06-19T10:25:00.000Z	TiZ_		Usually, intel cards are indeed very disappointing.
2008-06-19T10:25:00.000Z	TiZ_		Probalby more so than an ATI card would be.
2008-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	TiZ_		I'm using a laptop with an ATI Radeon Xpress 1150, and the proprietary driver is no good on it.
2008-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	TiZ_		I use the open source driver.
2008-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	kcormier	TiZ_	how can you get the open source ati driver?
2008-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	TiZ_	kcormier	you probably already have it.
2008-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	kcormier	TiZ_	I'm pretty sure it's the vesa driver by default
2008-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	kcormier	TiZ_	damn.  and it seems the binary driver doesn't work either.  damn damn damn!
2008-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	kcormier	TiZ_	I've been working on this damn machine for 4 days too....lmfao
2008-06-19T10:31:00.000Z	kcormier	TiZ_	I've noticed...too bad it's pretty much all I have because in windows it's usually much better for tv out!
2008-06-19T10:36:00.000Z	TiZ_	kcormier	the only thing you can do is scour google and the ubuntu forums for solutions, or go back to Windows.
2008-06-19T10:36:00.000Z	kcormier	TiZ_	do you know if the open source driver supports the ati hd2600 pro?
