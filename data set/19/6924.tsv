2008-03-26T19:10:00.000Z	clarezoe		anyone knows where to took at the out put histories from terminal, something like a log file?
2008-03-26T19:12:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	what is texlive2007
2008-03-26T19:13:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	it's a tex package
2008-03-26T19:14:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	exactly
2008-06-23T17:48:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	install the chinese fonts pack
2008-06-23T17:50:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	where can I find the fonts pack
2008-06-23T18:09:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	I have installed the mozilla-firefox-locale-zh-cn, is that what you mean, but still no change
2008-06-23T18:09:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	that is odd; works fine here-->what about quick locale switcher plugin for ff
2008-06-23T18:10:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	OK, I'll try that, give me a second
2008-06-23T18:14:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	another failure
2008-06-23T18:15:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	you cant see the fonts properly? or are you trying to blog
2008-06-23T18:15:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	I can see it in other browser, I just want to read
2008-06-23T18:16:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	not sure; I usually install anything relating to chinese (simplified + traditional) fonts when installing ubuntu
2008-06-23T18:18:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	me too, I'm Chinese, and I need to use Chinese, so I have almost everything installed, I don't know what else I need
2008-06-23T18:19:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	you got scim all configured? that is really odd. perhaps the setting within firefox itself
2008-06-23T18:22:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	yes. Is there anything with scim? I also asked help in ubuntu-cn channel, but seems no one have my problem
2008-06-23T18:23:00.000Z	bazhang	clarezoe	must be the ff settings then
2008-06-23T18:27:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	OK，thanks, I'll look around
2008-06-23T19:27:00.000Z	clarezoe	bazhang	still there?  it says this if I run firefox in terminal "(firefox:8143): Pango-WARNING **: failed to create cairo scaled font, expect ugly output. the offending font is '楷体_GB2312 10.5'", any idea?
