2006-01-28T17:51:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	just compile it
2006-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	the Kernel Module(Driver)
2006-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	the Nvidia Installer right?
2006-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	make sure you have Build-Essiential installed, gcc-3.4, and the kernel headers for your kernel
2006-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	then just run it, when it sees that there is no precompiled interface it will offer to compile it
2006-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	install gcc-3.4
2006-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	then export CC=gcc-3.4
2006-01-28T17:57:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	then just do this: export CC=gcc-3.4
2006-01-28T17:58:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	then run the installer (sudo it of course)
2006-01-28T06:02:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	no compile?
2006-01-28T06:03:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	thats what export CC=gcc-3.4 should do
2006-01-28T06:03:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	CC=gcc-3.4 <RETURN> export CC
2006-01-28T06:03:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	CC has to be Captial
2006-01-28T06:06:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2006-01-28T06:08:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	that should be it
2006-01-28T06:09:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	If you closed the term you'll need to export again
2006-01-28T06:19:00.000Z	Kyral	rahul	oh
