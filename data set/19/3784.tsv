2009-05-28T23:07:00.000Z	s0tt0	ZykoticK9	its not virtual PC problem

2009-05-28T23:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	s0tt0	it's an issue with getting network forwarding in your virtual machines - find a "virtual pc" channel / support it's their networking you have to correct
2009-05-28T23:09:00.000Z	s0tt0	ZykoticK9	ok thanks

2009-05-28T23:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	s0tt0	trust me - it's the vm's networking (if you used Virtualbox i know how to do it, but i don't use anything on ms products) Good luck.
