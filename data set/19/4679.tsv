2009-08-25T09:52:00.000Z	hornets		thanks
2009-08-25T09:53:00.000Z	torn	hornets	you might as well run OpenOffice. It supports MS Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint formats, as well.
2009-08-25T09:54:00.000Z	torn	hornets	oops, just read mralexandro's reply.
2009-08-25T09:55:00.000Z	torn	hornets	how come?
2009-08-25T09:56:00.000Z	torn	hornets	OpenOffice cannot index pages?
2009-08-25T09:56:00.000Z	torn	hornets	can you explain please? I like to learn about different features.
2009-08-25T09:57:00.000Z	hornets	torn	well.. it's a project from my college degree.
2009-08-25T09:58:00.000Z	torn	hornets	but in my case, I have no problems switching between using OpenOffice and MS Office, especially for word documents. In that case, I just save my file as MS Word 97/2000/XP format.
2009-08-25T09:58:00.000Z	hornets	torn	I know that
2009-08-25T09:59:00.000Z	torn	hornets	OpenOffice supports .docx as well.
2009-08-25T10:02:00.000Z	hornets	torn	what idea?
2009-08-25T10:03:00.000Z	torn	hornets	do you still have your Windows XP/Vista installation disc?
2009-08-25T10:03:00.000Z	hornets	torn	yep
2009-08-25T10:03:00.000Z	torn	hornets	I have great experience with VirtualBox, and couldn't be happier with it. http://www.virtualbox.org
2009-08-25T10:04:00.000Z	hornets	torn	dude
2009-08-25T10:04:00.000Z	torn	hornets	LOL
2009-08-25T10:04:00.000Z	torn	hornets	I would going to say to install Windows on a virtual machine, and just run Office 2007 on there. It's better than messing around with Wine.
2009-08-25T10:05:00.000Z	torn	hornets	I'm surprised at how well VirtualBox works. It's almost as good as VMware, yet it's completely free for personal use, and OSS at that...
