2011-06-03T01:20:00.000Z	Darkenvy		where can I go for VMware trouble?
2011-06-03T01:21:00.000Z	Darkenvy		vmware works fine up to the point of ANY video playing of any kind or program. Crashes the VMware environment's display driver
2011-06-03T01:21:00.000Z	Darkenvy		namely windows
2011-06-03T01:21:00.000Z	Darkenvy		nope
2011-06-03T01:21:00.000Z	Darkenvy		VMware all the way
2011-06-03T01:21:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I tried virtual box I hated it so much
2011-06-03T01:21:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	I can run XBMC perfectly on virtualbox
2011-06-03T01:23:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	do you really need to watch netflix on this specific software for windows? Im pretty sure xbmc for linux can handle netflix too
2011-06-03T01:26:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	well, that's new for me. Didn't know that netflix support was broken on boxee and xbmc.
2011-06-03T01:28:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	unfortunately I don't have experience with vmware. Do you have video driver setup with hardware acceleration on linux?
2011-06-03T01:29:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	lol that`s the problem!
2011-06-03T01:30:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	at least, I got similiar problems while runing triple screen with xinerama
2011-06-03T01:30:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	xinerama disables hardware acceleration
2011-06-03T01:31:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	you mean that back in 10.04 everything was working fine even with xinerama ON?
2011-06-03T01:33:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	are you installing the same vmware version on the 10.10?
2011-06-03T01:35:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	well, im not sure honestly. But since you have such a uncommon display setting, I doubt that developers do really care if the software is gonna work on it so I think trying to install the same version is a valid try.
2011-06-03T01:37:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	lol I tried to give an alterative because I didn't understand that netflix was only an example
2011-06-03T01:40:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	by the way. I know that there is a guide on the ubuntuforums that shows a way to enable hardware acceleration on xinerama setups. But it needs a lot of hacking and patchs.
2011-06-03T01:42:00.000Z	Sl4sh3r	Darkenvy	if you take a look on youtube you will find plenty of videos. But I really doubt how stable it is. I will drop a link on private.
