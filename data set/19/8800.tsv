2007-05-08T08:35:00.000Z	cables		I've enabled Sync to VBlank in nvidia-settings, but I have to reenable it every time I boot up.
2007-05-08T08:35:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	Add "nvidia-settings --load-config" (or something similar, see man nvidia-settings) to your session start up.
2007-05-08T08:36:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	ok, the problem is Beryl has to be started after that.
2007-05-08T08:36:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	Then load beryl as "nvidia-settings --load-config && beryl" ?
2007-05-08T08:36:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	that makes sense
2007-05-14T12:09:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	Bambie: Or "deluge-torrent" in add/remove
2007-05-14T12:09:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	it's not in the repos
2007-05-14T12:10:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	nice try
2007-05-14T12:10:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	Odd, because *I've* installed it from Feisty's universe
2007-05-14T12:11:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	maybe you installed from their .deb and you thought you had installed from the repos...
2007-05-14T12:11:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	No, definitely not.
2007-05-14T12:12:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	maybe you added a 3rd party repo?
2007-05-14T12:13:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/deluge-torrent - it *was* in Feisty, and is in edgy-backports and gutsy.
2007-05-14T12:13:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	Maybe it's currently in a state of flux while being backported to Fesity?
2007-05-14T12:13:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	why was it removed from feisty?
2007-05-14T12:15:00.000Z	cables	RAOF	why would it be in edgy-backports but not any feisty repos?
2007-05-14T12:16:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	I have no idea.
2007-05-14T12:16:00.000Z	RAOF	cables	As I said, maybe it's been accidentally removed as a part of a backport.
