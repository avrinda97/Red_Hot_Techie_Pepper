2007-12-29T09:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	some can last way longer than that if you have a slow machine or low ram.
2007-12-29T09:37:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	this is T61P
2007-12-29T09:38:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	^^^^^^^
2007-12-29T09:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	not if it boot to the start or install menu
2007-12-29T09:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	assuming you have more than 256 megs you may end up using the alternate install cd
2007-12-29T09:39:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	I got 2G of ram in here
2007-12-29T09:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	that was for johnny
2007-12-29T09:40:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	so how do I boot to the install menu
2007-12-29T09:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	if you dont get to start or install do you get any error.. often you need to verify the md5 or burn very slowly.
2008-12-24T23:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	watch the language.. thanks
2008-12-24T23:11:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	it couldn't be described in a better way
2008-12-24T23:11:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	I go to websites and they don't recognize the browser type, and it sends me to the mobile site, or it sends me to some other screwed up site
2008-12-24T23:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	It could have done without the profanity
2008-12-24T23:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	what site is not letting you view it.
2008-12-24T23:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	papajohns comes up in the default firefox here
2008-12-24T23:17:00.000Z	dan2	Jack_Sparrow	right... but in iceweasel it doesn't
2008-12-24T23:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dan2	FYI the video came up on amazon for me here
