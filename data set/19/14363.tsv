2004-09-19T16:32:00.000Z	glyph		IMHO cryptic options should look cryptic
2004-09-19T11:24:00.000Z	glyph		I am lame; I get some leet 0-day warez and I don't even have time to test them :-(.
2004-09-19T11:24:00.000Z	glyph		does anyone have a suggestion for me to install ubuntu on one of my machines without destroying the existing debian install?   I don't have room anywhere for a full backup of my existing drives.
2004-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	lamont	glyph	do you have a spare couple of gig in a partition of it's own?
2004-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	glyph	lamont	if I had that, I wouldn't be asking this question ;)
2004-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	lamont		rumor has it you can force ubuntu to just install in that partition, instead of trashing the machine...
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	lamont		then you're probably stuck with installing another hard drive... :-(
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	glyph	lamont	Rgargh
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	lamont		or you could install vmware under debian, and then install ubuntu in a virtual machine...
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	glyph	lamont	I meant "warez" in the figurative sense
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	lamont		or s/vmware/selinux/
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	glyph		selinux?
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	lamont		sorry.  uml
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	glyph		you mean UML?
2004-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	glyph		yeah, thought so
2004-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	glyph		I guess it's about time I bought a new hard drive anyway
2004-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	glyph		unless you guys want to send me one? :-)
2004-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	lamont	glyph	I fear it's too far to walk. :-)
2004-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	glyph	lamont	you could just mail-order me one
