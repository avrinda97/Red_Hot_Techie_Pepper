2008-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	hyperair		hello there. how well do broadcom cards work with linux?
2008-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	most work well
2008-08-03T19:47:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	anything bcm4328 will need ndiswrapper, most others will work with b43-fwcutter
2008-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	can you find out the chipset?
2008-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	no, the broadcom chipset :p
2008-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	broadcom 4310
2008-08-03T19:49:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	the other is 4315
2008-08-03T19:50:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	-->http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#supported
2008-08-03T19:51:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	in other words none of the broadcom cards work out of the box?
2008-08-03T19:52:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	that's one hell of a high res
2008-08-03T19:52:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	one package install for most (b43-fwcutter will do the download automatically when it installs)
2008-08-03T19:52:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	my desktop is 2560x1024 :p
2008-08-03T19:53:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	is there no way to do install ubuntu and set up network without a network connection?
2008-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	any broadcoms that don't work with b43 should probably work with ndiswrapper, although finding the right windows driver can be a pain (make sure you check hardware revisions, aka, there's 3 different bcm4328's, each needing a different windows driver to make them work)
2008-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	define setup network
2008-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	get internet connection without a wire?
2008-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	look to find a cheap cheap usb wireless adapter, most of them work out of the box
2008-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	cwillu	hyperair	zd1211 chipset usually
2008-08-03T19:55:00.000Z	hyperair	cwillu	i was hoping it wouldn't come to that
