2010-08-11T17:26:00.000Z	asal		 i have a problem with my usb flash mass storage as follows
2010-08-11T17:27:00.000Z	asal		when i insert my flash in usb port it is detected by linux & kde but it is mounter only as read-only
2010-08-11T17:27:00.000Z	asal		 and when i use the command "dd of=/dev/sda count=1 bs=512"
2010-08-11T17:27:00.000Z	asal		it reports me that the file-syste is read-only
2010-08-11T17:27:00.000Z	asal		 this matter is repeated by any linux that i htested including ubuntu-10.10 and knoppix 5.1 and 5.3
2010-08-11T17:27:00.000Z	asal		s there anyone knowing my solution?
2010-08-11T17:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	ya some usb flash have a switch on the side that make them read only
2010-08-11T17:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	reformat it?
2010-08-11T17:32:00.000Z	asal	sacarlson	it can not be accessed by any command that want to write on any sectors of it
2010-08-11T17:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	play with it with gparted
2010-08-11T17:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	umount it then play with it in gparted
2010-08-11T17:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	was it already mounted?  it must be unmounted I think to do that
2010-08-11T17:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	can you unmount it?
2010-08-11T17:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	unmount it
2010-08-11T17:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	did you try gparted with it unmounted?
2010-08-11T17:37:00.000Z	asal	sacarlson	i tried all of things that you told , but nothing is different unfortunately :-(
2010-08-11T17:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	 I had some counterfit usb flashed I used a tool from the manufacture that only runs in windows but I totaly mest it up when I reprogramed the usb id to 0000:0000.  I had to trash it.
2010-08-11T17:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	asal	there are tool to program usb flash drives to make them change there id and make them look biger than they realy are.  that's the scam the chinese are using to sell fake usb flash drives.  these tools go beyond what linux can do.  look for usb flash counterfit on google and you will see.
