2009-11-09T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	s/he doesnt have it,
2009-11-09T03:34:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	some people just gotta learn to RTFM once in a while
2009-11-09T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	not hugely constructive
2009-11-09T03:35:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	yeah but giving links is basically telling them the same thing now isn't it?
2009-11-09T03:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	pretty much but if thats what it takes then play the game and it ends faster
2009-11-09T03:37:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	just don't like it when people start calling people names when they don't have the patience to follow a link or read for themselves
2009-11-09T03:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	yeah me too, its also against channel guidlines
2009-11-09T03:39:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	funny though he got on IRC so you'd pretty much assume he'd know his way around a system...
2009-11-09T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	possibly, maybe s/he finds getting on IRC easy but other things harder
2011-05-06T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	not all adapters can use wpa2 under linux
2011-05-06T13:15:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	iwlist auth : WPA WPA2 CIPHER-TKIP CIPHER-CCMP
2011-05-06T13:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	doesn't mean you adapter can use it, the access point is just relaying what it can do
2011-05-06T13:18:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	the thing is this worked on 10.10 but had to compile the VIA VT6656 drivers
2011-05-06T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	sounds like a regression bug then
2011-05-06T13:20:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	it actually authenticates and associates with the AP then drops with: "Scanning [<hex chars>] not found, disconnected !" in dmesg
2011-05-06T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	tried disabling ipv6 (assuming you don't use it).I've seen it break people's connection
2011-05-06T13:22:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	IPv6 is set to Ignore on network-manager
2011-05-06T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ek|mu5	you can disable it in the kernel too with the bootoption:  ipv6.disable=1
2011-05-06T13:23:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	ActionParsnip	Okay I'll try that. Thanks
