2005-07-26T15:16:00.000Z	lok	volvoguy	?
2005-07-26T15:16:00.000Z	lok		well
2005-07-26T15:16:00.000Z	volvoguy		thought so. i rarely use OO, so it's never been a big issue here.
2005-07-26T15:16:00.000Z	lok		it's not really faster for me
2005-07-26T15:17:00.000Z	volvoguy		i second abiword. i much prefer it to OO.
2005-07-26T15:18:00.000Z	lok		se7enone>> word quickly ???
2005-07-26T15:18:00.000Z	lok		faster than OOo but not really quick
2005-07-26T15:19:00.000Z	lok		LuNaTiK^GuY>> use totem-xine
2005-07-26T15:20:00.000Z	lok		using totem for music is a bit too heavy for me
2005-07-26T15:21:00.000Z	lok		and not really make for it
2005-07-26T15:22:00.000Z	lok		Burgundavia>> it's heavy when I just want to play a music
2005-07-26T15:22:00.000Z	lok		LuNaTiK^GuY>> it's totem but it use libxine instead of gstreamer ones
2005-07-26T15:23:00.000Z	lok		rhythmbox is more designed to play music than totem
2005-07-26T15:23:00.000Z	lok		xmms is old and ugly :)
2005-07-26T15:26:00.000Z	lok		LuNaTiK^GuY>> there is a nvidia panel no ?
2005-07-26T15:26:00.000Z	volvoguy		BMP - "Beep Media Player" is quite impressive for a simple media player.
2005-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	lok		volvoguy>> it's just xmms but a bit more heavy :)
2005-07-26T15:28:00.000Z	volvoguy	lok	i thought just the opposite - less configs to mess with and it usually "just works". everybody listens to music differently though.
