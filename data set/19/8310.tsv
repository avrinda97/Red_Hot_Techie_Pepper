2009-02-18T19:35:00.000Z	odder		hello, does anybody know how to make gnome-panel display no icons?
2009-02-18T19:35:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	you should be able to remove everything that's on it
2009-02-18T19:37:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	okay, I need to be more specific. I want the application-list applet display text only
2009-02-18T19:40:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	I don't know how you would do that. You can install a different menu applet, or a different panel app...
2009-02-18T19:42:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	for example?
2009-02-18T19:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	xfce-panel with xfce4-xfapplet-plugin
2009-02-18T20:02:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	you're sure it works? I've just checked it and there is no option of displaying window list without icons
2009-02-18T20:03:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	(I mean the xfce4-panel)
2009-02-18T20:03:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	oh I'm not sure of anything, that was just an example. I've used different panels before, and from what I remember of xfce there were no icons in the menus. I could be wrong tho
2009-02-18T20:04:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	you said application list earlier not window list
2009-02-18T20:05:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	yeah, but I've corrected myself
2009-02-18T20:05:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	no, I mean the app that shows you currently opened apps
2009-02-18T20:06:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	ooh. I take it back. not sure
2009-02-18T20:13:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	Is it impossible, then?
2009-02-18T20:15:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	well, with open source nothing is impossible. It's just a matter of scale
2009-02-18T20:15:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	geez, it shuld be simple, there's such an option on fluxbox e.g.
2009-02-18T20:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	it should be. I think you should ask  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie> to add that feature. I'd like to see it too.
2009-02-18T20:20:00.000Z	odder	Seven_Six_Two	why Mark? window-list applet shows Alexander Larsson as the author
2009-02-18T20:25:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	odder	I was looking at window selector applet
