2011-05-02T03:03:00.000Z	david8732		Depends on what you wanna do.
2011-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	david8732		@xgates The biggest problem was browsers when 64-bit first came out.
2011-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	david8732		Plugins werent compatible with the 64-bit versions
2011-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	david8732		but that's barely an issue now
2011-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	david8732		yup
2011-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	david8732		It's got a slight performance advantage
2011-05-02T03:05:00.000Z	david8732		64-bit flash was working pretty well last time I tried it. You can run the 32-bit version with a compatibility layer.
2011-05-02T03:06:00.000Z	david8732		If anything acts up
2011-05-02T03:07:00.000Z	david8732		maybe you dont have enough video ram for that resolution.
2011-05-02T03:08:00.000Z	kneaux	david8732	would that be the case with a new upgrade? This didn't happen in 10.04
2011-05-02T03:08:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	Only if you changed hardware. If you just upgraded, that would be bizarre
2011-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	kneaux	david8732	now you understand my pain.
2011-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	I would make sure the graphics driver being used is the right one...
2011-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	I had that happen
2011-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	check the connection to your monitors. Maybe do a power-cycle on them
2011-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	and reconnect them. They might be detected incorrectly
2011-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	kneaux	david8732	did that, and fglrx should work as well now as it did then
2011-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	damn. =/
2011-05-02T03:11:00.000Z	david8732	kneaux	try 'lsmod | grep flgrx' in the console
