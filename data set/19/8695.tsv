2007-02-23T15:21:00.000Z	starly		does anyone know how to get a specific version of X.org?
2007-02-23T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	starly	if you want to stay within the ubuntu framework, you're stuck with 7.0 on edgy.
2007-02-23T15:24:00.000Z	soundray	starly	if you want a different version, you have to compile and install it yourself, bypassing the apt system.
2007-02-23T15:24:00.000Z	starly	soundray	can i tell apt not to install another version of xorg, when i install it from source?
2007-02-23T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	starly	yes, but you have to uninstall all the metapackages that depend on X directly or indirectly
2007-02-23T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	starly	btw, feisty will have 7.1
2007-02-23T15:27:00.000Z	starly	soundray	does this mean, i have to install all GUI-programs from source?
2007-02-23T15:27:00.000Z	soundray	starly	no
2007-02-23T15:28:00.000Z	soundray	starly	you can still install GUI clients, as they don't depend on the X server being installed locally.
2007-02-23T15:29:00.000Z	soundray	starly	but you can probably save yourself headaches by testing feisty instead of retrofitting 7.2 onto edgy.
2007-02-23T15:30:00.000Z	starly	soundray	i'll test feisty, if it's not better in feisty, can i install xorg 6.X and let xorg7 installed until xorg6 is running or will i have a time when i can't use X?
2007-02-23T15:32:00.000Z	soundray	starly	I'm not aware of any way of installing 6.X without bypassing apt
2007-02-23T15:32:00.000Z	starly	soundray	ok, thanks a lot :-)
2007-02-23T15:33:00.000Z	soundray	starly	what is it about 7.0 that troubles you?
2007-02-23T15:35:00.000Z	starly	soundray	i got the driver for my matrox g200 (really old graphics card) and by installing, it complains about wrong xserver version, by checking the manual i found they require xorg 5.X or 6.X
2007-02-23T15:39:00.000Z	soundray	starly	I'm running it on a production machine
2007-02-23T15:39:00.000Z	soundray	starly	only because otherwise it wouldn't run at all. It's stable. That doesn't mean you'll have the same experience, though.
2007-02-23T15:40:00.000Z	starly	soundray	the same experience as what?
2007-02-23T15:40:00.000Z	soundray	starly	the same experience of stability that I have ;)
