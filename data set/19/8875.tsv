2007-02-24T11:39:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	irida: which specific w32codec? I laready have soemthing installed - Win32/VfWev and Win32/VfW    neitehr one works
2007-02-24T11:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	The package that irida linked is all you need to install.
2007-02-24T11:41:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	ok, let me try
2007-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	I keep on getting this eror even after I isntalled w32 codecs:  Error opening/initializig the selected video_out (-vo) device.
2007-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	That's not w32codecs, your mplayer is set up incorrectly. Are you using it from the command line or the GUI?
2007-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	gui
2007-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	Go into whatever options there are and select xv as the video output driver.
2007-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	Run mplayer from the command line and pastebin all the output
2007-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	ardchoille: I think the movie is file is a broken downlaod as mplayer plays fine the other video. Also I slected ffmpeg for audio codec - is that ok or soemthing else ?
2007-02-24T12:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	ffmpeg isn't an audio codec. Go with -ao alsa
2007-02-24T12:01:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	ok
2007-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	I have a lot of choice but nothing like "-ao alsa"
2007-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	alsa
2007-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	wait I was look at the codecs & demuxer section all this time. What do I set in tehre ?

2007-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	What?
2007-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	slyfox	arrenlex	What do I do about this error? Reuqested audi codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not availabel. Enable it at compilation
2007-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	Did you get mplayer from the ubuntu repositories? If so, it appears that mp3lib was not compiled in it. Choose another codec for mp3 decoding, like libmad. I have no idea what the screen looks like; never used the mplayer gui.
2007-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	slyfox	recursive, force
