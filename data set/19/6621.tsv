2008-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	WinShade		hello all... ubuntu newbie, am i in the right place?
2008-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	yup
2008-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	ask your question
2008-01-08T10:13:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	Alt-Ctl-F2 won't work til the system is booted. If I were you I would try the alternate cd...this is an older laptop from your desc and probably doesn't have much ram/cpu/hd
2008-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	then you have ubuntu booting on this computer>
2008-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	what drivers are you looking for?
2008-01-08T10:15:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	ok....lspci, lsusb, lshw
2008-01-08T10:17:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	when you boot ubuntu, do you get a graphic login or just text mode?
2008-01-08T10:23:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	bet it is uvcvideo
2008-01-08T10:24:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	type 'lsmod | grep video' and see if uvcvideo is loaded (or some other video module)
2008-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	probably. Try this at the command prompt....sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
2008-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	WinShade	th0r	video       18060  0
2008-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	give that dpkg command a try
2008-01-08T10:28:00.000Z	WinShade	th0r	i selected 800x600 since i figure most monitors of this age can handle at least that. what do i do again to start up the graphical interface?
2008-01-08T10:28:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	hit Alt-F7 and if it is running it will take you to the gui, if it isn't running, hit Alt-F2 again and type startx
2008-01-08T10:29:00.000Z	WinShade	th0r	still getting weird blue alternating dots set up in a neat stripe pattern vertically on the screen
2008-01-08T10:29:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	yeah...it isn't configuring the modelines correctly.
2008-01-08T10:29:00.000Z	WinShade	th0r	totally black screen otherwise, seems its not doing anything (loading or anything)
2008-01-08T10:30:00.000Z	th0r	WinShade	give the other guys a shot...maybe their ideas will work
