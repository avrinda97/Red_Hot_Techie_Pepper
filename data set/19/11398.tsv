2006-01-28T08:14:00.000Z	danno	brenner	thanks hmmm
2006-01-28T08:15:00.000Z	danno	brenner	thanks I have used other distributions and was surprised at having to mount the floppy manually with sudo for the owners of the system
2006-01-28T08:15:00.000Z	brenner	danno	is mount removable media checked in sys > orefs > removable discs?
2006-01-28T08:16:00.000Z	danno	brenner	sys > orefs?
2006-01-28T08:16:00.000Z	brenner	danno	prefs, sorry
