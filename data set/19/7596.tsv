2007-08-27T11:06:00.000Z	Tilllinux		hm...
2007-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	Tilllinux		well I'm actually having touble with my usb harddisk, as it's write-protected since last boot
2007-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	what file system does the HD use?
2007-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	have you checked the disk's permissions?
2007-08-27T11:10:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	what do you mean?
2007-08-27T11:12:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	right click on the disk on desktop. go to properties, then permissions. make sure the owner has folder access to create and delete files. I'm not sure why they would cheange on reboot, but that should give you access.
2007-08-27T11:13:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	i've got permissions
2007-08-27T11:15:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	my problem is, that I've got rw permissions (the group sections says "root" which is strange and this root group hasn't got any permissions), but the disk is write-protected
2007-08-27T11:18:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	but above the group should be a section called Owner: Folder access should be create and delete files, file access should be read-write. If those are set correctly (it sounds like they are), and it is a supported file system (fat32 is), then the file system is corrupt
2007-08-27T11:19:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	root has no permissions in the disk I'm looking at too, so I don't think that's a problem. Also, can you read data, even if you can't write to the disk?
2007-08-27T11:19:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	no, fileacces is set to " --- " ... if i change it to rw, it will change itself back again
2007-08-27T11:19:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	yes i can read everything
2007-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	huh. well, that's actually the way it's set on this disk too, so that shouldn't be an issue.
2007-08-27T11:25:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	there's also this little "wirte-protected"-symbol on the disk-icon
2007-08-27T11:27:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	was it set as write protected in a previous life of did it do this on its own? if on its own, then given what else you've said, I think the file system may be corrupt
2007-08-27T11:29:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	i never told it to be write protected (well, i hope i didn't) but i dont think the file system is corrupt, either
2007-08-27T11:30:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	that's a good test. everything I've read says that it's either bad permissions, an NTFS file structure, or a corrupt file system
2007-08-27T11:32:00.000Z	Tilllinux	deramin	seems to be somewhat corrupted... hm anything to correct a corrupted filesystem? well, ill run chkdsk /r in windows
2007-08-27T11:33:00.000Z	deramin	Tilllinux	not sure. Fat32 isn't known for stability, though
