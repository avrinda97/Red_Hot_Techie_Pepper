2007-05-26T14:37:00.000Z	hexpill		anyone ever get a "no such file or directory" message for a program that is obviously there?
2007-05-26T14:38:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	is that program in the same directory as you are
2007-05-26T14:38:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	yes it is
2007-05-26T14:38:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	then invoke it with ./program
2007-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	hexpill		I did
2007-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	I'm trying to run baudline
2007-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	I do both baudline and ./baudline in the directory where the file is at but no luck
2007-05-26T14:41:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	check the ownership of the file. is it marked as executable?
2007-05-26T14:42:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	yes it is, -rwxr-xr-x
2007-05-26T14:42:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	is it a script? where did you get it from?
2007-05-26T14:42:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	baudline.com
2007-05-26T14:43:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	did you compile it yourself?
2007-05-26T14:43:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	it was precompiled
2007-05-26T14:44:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	it just has me stumped
2007-05-26T14:45:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	It is possible it is compiled for the wrong libraries
2007-05-26T14:45:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	ask baudline.com if they could make a version for ubuntu
2007-05-26T14:45:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	maybe, but the thing is that I don't think the creators of baudline have the source out. I could be mistaken
2007-05-26T14:46:00.000Z	hexpill	magnetron	someone told me earlier that they were able to run baudline on feisty fawn without a problem
2007-05-26T14:46:00.000Z	magnetron	hexpill	ok
