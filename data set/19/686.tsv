2011-10-15T14:59:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	could you please offer some help? sorry to single you out but I am frustrated :S
2011-10-15T14:59:00.000Z	ronspirin	Kingsy	that does not make me an expert on what you are trying to do, whatever that may be :P
2011-10-15T15:00:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	well, see if you know, basically 1 sec I will image shack a printscreen of my desktop
2011-10-15T15:01:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	ok check this out.. -> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/684/screenshotat20111015115.png/
2011-10-15T15:02:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	you see how the height of the main panel is nearly double that of the bottom? and the icons and menu buttons are sitting on a different color than the panel color?
2011-10-15T15:02:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	and the icons are massive with ugly dark lines seperating them?
2011-10-15T15:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	this is what I am trying to change
2011-10-15T15:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	I also have no system icons anymore apart from "sound"
2011-10-15T15:04:00.000Z	ronspirin	Kingsy	is that oneiric with gnome-panel?
2011-10-15T15:04:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	http://imageshack.us/f/839/screenshotat20111015115.png/ <--- that displays my problem a little better..
2011-10-15T15:04:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	tbh I don't know, I installed 11.10.. booted and didnt like the new layout of gnome.. so I installed gnome classic logged out and logged back in
2011-10-15T15:06:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	what have I done wrong? so i need to isntall something totally different?
2011-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	ronspirin	Kingsy	try to use a different theme and relog
2011-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	ronspirin	Kingsy	canonical replaced the classic gnome2 desktop with unity, and you're  probably running gnome3 in the fallback mode
2011-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	what do you mean? changing the theme doesnt change the height of the top panel
2011-10-15T15:08:00.000Z	ronspirin	Kingsy	so, *you* did nothing wrong, they just didnt tell you that the upgrade would mess up the way your desktop used to work :P
2011-10-15T15:09:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	so how do you use your desktop? do you use the new gnome layout?
2011-10-15T15:10:00.000Z	ronspirin	Kingsy	sroecker: let's try to fix that in a seperate channel or something #oneiricgnomepanel
2011-10-15T15:10:00.000Z	Kingsy	ronspirin	cool .. join that channel
