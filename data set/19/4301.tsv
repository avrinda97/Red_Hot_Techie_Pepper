2009-02-21T06:00:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	 is there an example directory or README, or DOC(S)?
2009-02-21T05:58:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	do you know the name of the file? you could try something like 'sudo updatedb && sudo locate <FileNAME>'  or look in /etc/openvpn/ maybe
2009-02-21T05:59:00.000Z	_niko	_VIM_	I know where the files are, I just dont know where they need to go to actaully work with openVPN as stupid as it may sound =[
2009-02-21T05:59:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	I myself do not have OpenVPN so I'm not exactly sure, but it seems most configs are in /etc/
2009-02-21T05:59:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	oh, hmmm
2009-02-21T06:01:00.000Z	_niko	_VIM_	The example doc was installed to /usr/share/doc/openpn/examples
2009-02-21T06:01:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	ok in that example file, it should say in there where to put the config
2009-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	sudo gunzip filename.gz
2009-02-21T06:09:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	np :)  well then i'd guess it's probably in Docs or README
2009-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	_niko	_VIM_	I have been looking =/ I only resort to IRC if im desperate =] I just hoped someone would know. I guess I shall plough through more text for now!
2009-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	ok, sorry I couldnlt of helped more :)
2009-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	_niko	_VIM_	haha its np you guys rock anyhow for trying =D
2009-02-21T06:12:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	yeah that's what makes Ubuntu so great, it's not the distro, there's a million good distros, it's the Community that really does it :)
2009-02-21T06:19:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	ok i think the config file needs to be /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf and you start it by /etc/init.d/openvpn start
2009-02-21T06:20:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	from what i've read you have to add the '.conf' bit
2009-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	hmm ok im going by this guide: http://www.ventanazul.com/webzine/articles/openvpn-ubuntu-and-hulu
2009-02-21T06:23:00.000Z	_niko	_VIM_	I saw that fleeting before, It seems i might have the config in the right place, I will just try and start it up
2009-02-21T06:56:00.000Z	_niko	_VIM_	If you around, Thanks fyour you help I got there server up, now i just have to figure how to use it! Thakns again
2009-02-21T06:56:00.000Z	_VIM_	_niko	glad you got it working :)
