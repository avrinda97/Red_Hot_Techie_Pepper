2007-06-17T11:15:00.000Z	Trixsey		Hey, I've got a problem with Java/GCJ in Ubuntu (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=476593), any ideas?
2007-06-17T11:17:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	it does NOT depend on gcj. note the little word "or"
2007-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	In theory it shouldn't, since it says it doesn't.. but when I do "sudo apt-get install eclipse".. it installs gcj too
2007-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	yes, cause java from sun is in non-free/mutliverse
2007-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	so how do I install eclipse without GCJ?
2007-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	install java from sun, install eclipse
2007-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	it should at least be recommended (not depended on)..
2007-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	if you bothered reading my entire post you'd know I run Java from Sun already
2007-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	still forcing GCJ to be installed
2007-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	it cannot be a recommends. eclispe cannot work without an installed java
2007-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	and Suns Java is not an installed Java? I don't quite see your point. As I stated in IRC and as I stated in my post: I have Suns Java
2007-06-17T11:23:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	apt-cache show eclipse, apt-cache show sun-java6-bin apt-cache show  sun-java6-jre
2007-06-17T11:24:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	in my post I also checked packages Azureus/Eclipse depends on... -_-, please read the entire post
2007-06-17T11:24:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	^^
2007-06-17T11:25:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	why would if force an install of GCJ if I already run Suns Java? It seems very illogical to me...
2007-06-17T11:32:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	dpkg -l |grep java
2007-06-17T11:33:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	http://www.mathbin.net/11525
2007-06-17T11:35:00.000Z	wols_	Trixsey	sun-java6-jre, does it provide java2-runtime? (apt-cache show to check(
2007-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	Trixsey	wols_	I didn't have java2-runtime
