2009-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	pady		I want to install hunspell from source but it is giving error on make install
2009-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	pady		the error is : make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.
2009-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	pady		Please guide me what to do
2009-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	Slart	pady	have you read the instructions in INSTALL or README?
2009-07-23T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	pady	./configure, make, sudo make install is the normal way ie the way most source code is compiled.. but it's far from the only way.. there are other systems, ways and so on.. you need to read the incuded instructions when you compile source code
2009-07-23T15:45:00.000Z	pady	Slart	I had read and follow that instruction, still it is giving the same error
2009-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	pady	can you pastebin what happens when you run ./configure  make    sudo make install? including the commands
2009-07-23T15:55:00.000Z	pady	Slart	Config will giving error here is the config.log file I had pasted : http://paste.ubuntu.com/226900/
2009-07-23T15:56:00.000Z	Slart	pady	ok, I'll have a look
2009-07-23T15:57:00.000Z	Slart	pady	run this "sudo apt-get install build-essential", then try again
2009-07-23T15:57:00.000Z	pady	Slart	ok
2009-07-23T15:57:00.000Z	Slart	pady	in some cases   ./configure actually creates the make files so if configure fails there might not be a make install rule
2009-07-23T15:58:00.000Z	pady	Slart	Thanks
2009-07-23T15:59:00.000Z	Slart	pady	it works now?
2009-07-23T15:59:00.000Z	pady	Slart	but make giving error
2009-07-23T15:59:00.000Z	Slart	pady	ok.. pastebin again
2009-07-23T16:00:00.000Z	pady	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu.com/226915/
2009-07-23T16:02:00.000Z	Slart	pady	I have no idea why it does that..
2009-07-23T16:46:00.000Z	pady	Slart	config giving these warning  http://paste.ubuntu.com/227064/, so while giving make I am getting  error :http://paste.ubuntu.com/226945/
