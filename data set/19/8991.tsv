2007-08-11T06:05:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	What is the actual question you want to ask?
2007-08-11T06:06:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	why gnome/ubuntu/whatever doesn't want me to unmount my external disks..
2007-08-11T06:06:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	what happens *exactly*that you think should not happen?
2007-08-11T06:07:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	i right click, press unmount, it unmounts, ubuntu complains that the disk is being written to and mounts it again
2007-08-11T06:13:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	Silly question, but do you have anything open from the USB disk? or is it your curent working directory in any program (eg a terminal, a browser...)?
2007-08-11T06:13:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	nothing, and this happens with all my (3) disks, at all times, even when i've just startet ubuntu..
2007-08-11T06:14:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	i've searched a little, and it looks like i'm not the only one with that problem, and it's not just an ubuntu thing..
2007-08-11T06:15:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	Then you know more than me about this problem.
2007-08-11T06:15:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	thanks anyway :)
2007-08-11T06:16:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	Can you let us know a URL or two for where you found info? Maybe they will give one of us a clue...
2007-08-11T06:19:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	yeah, i'm just looking for a good one :)
2007-08-11T06:21:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	it's this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-mount/+bug/107963
2007-08-11T06:21:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	i'll just try the fix the last comment links to
2007-08-11T06:25:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	Just waht I was going to suggest (have just read the bug threads)
2007-08-11T06:36:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	I have it, but don;t know how to get it to you (total GAIM newbie).
2007-08-11T06:38:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	How can I send you this file? I feel so inadequate...
2007-08-11T06:38:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	i'm sure i'll find it somewhere :)
2007-08-11T06:39:00.000Z	nichlas	kauer	my broser still works, just not my file manager :P
2007-08-11T06:42:00.000Z	kauer	nichlas	Here is mine: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33332/
