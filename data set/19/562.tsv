2012-05-07T20:51:00.000Z	eutheria		i like the rest
2012-05-07T20:52:00.000Z	eutheria		ok i will accept i can't disable it for the minute
2012-05-07T20:53:00.000Z	eutheria		i liked that in 11.04 that there was a button on the top panel to start the dashboard
2012-05-07T20:53:00.000Z	eutheria		once i have an indicator for everything, what do i need the launcher for?
2012-05-07T20:54:00.000Z	eutheria		i really like the indicators
2012-05-07T20:54:00.000Z	eutheria		the launcher doesn't look part of the desktop
2012-05-07T20:54:00.000Z	eutheria		you press meta and your UI totally changes
2012-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	eutheria		you know the amount of screen real estate you get back with unity is awesome
2012-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	eutheria		the scroll bars, global menu, etc
2012-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	eutheria		i just want to be able to see my menu all the time
2012-05-07T20:55:00.000Z	mobius420	eutheria	 unity is cool,  but I would make sure to disable the zeitgeist recorder
2012-05-07T20:56:00.000Z	eutheria	mobius420	i just want to tweak some things! keep the default as seen fit for new users
2012-05-07T21:00:00.000Z	eutheria	mobius420	that is to do with your virtual host entries i bet
2012-05-07T21:00:00.000Z	mobius420	eutheria	 how might I edit that file,  and would the file be on the webserver itself?
2012-05-07T21:00:00.000Z	mobius420	eutheria	  oh right
2012-05-07T21:00:00.000Z	eutheria	mobius420	that depends on how you configured it
2012-05-07T21:01:00.000Z	eutheria	mobius420	i follow the standard file system layout and keep my config under /etc/apache2/sites-available
2012-05-07T21:02:00.000Z	eutheria	mobius420	add an entry to your /etc/hosts then
2012-05-07T21:04:00.000Z	eutheria	mobius420	you have the default site enabled, look at /etc/apache2/site-enabled
