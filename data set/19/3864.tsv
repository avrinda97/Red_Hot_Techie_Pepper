2009-05-15T03:45:00.000Z	hacktolive		thanks DasEi
2009-05-15T03:47:00.000Z	hacktolive		So if I have my HOME in a separated partition, can I have a dual-boot of ubuntu and Fedora both using the same home.... ?
2009-05-15T03:48:00.000Z	hacktolive		cool (regarding dual-boot)
2009-05-15T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	perhaps.. some different versions of apps might not liek it though
2009-05-15T03:49:00.000Z	hacktolive	Slart	I was thinking the same...
2009-05-15T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	I would use a separate partition for documents.. and mount that in the home folder.. that way you still have one home for each os but documents and such are still available on both
2009-05-15T03:53:00.000Z	hacktolive	Slart	So... you can mount a regular ext3 partition anywhere you like? even on a regular folder...? I'm still not familiar with that...
2009-05-15T03:53:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	sure
2009-05-15T03:53:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	it's just a gnome thing that you have to mount stuff in /media
2009-05-15T03:54:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	but you can mount stuff anywhere you want (almost).. you can mount a folder several times in different places if you want..
2009-05-15T03:54:00.000Z	hacktolive	Slart	interesting... in fact, I have already done it with regular ISOs, but not with partitions...
2009-05-15T03:54:00.000Z	hacktolive	Slart	So mounting a partition is kinda like mounting any other file (ISO, tar.gz, etc...) ?
2009-05-15T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	sure.. same method
2009-07-15T03:14:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	what is a "superdeb"? ... sounds... big =)
2009-07-15T03:15:00.000Z	hacktolive	Slart	lots of .deb files + installer script
2009-07-15T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	nevermind.. I found the FAQ =)
2009-07-27T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	yes, in theory and practice
2009-07-27T00:26:00.000Z	hacktolive	Slart	mcmcmc: OK, thanks a lot
2009-07-27T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	hacktolive	of course.. assuming the cpu uses the amd64 setup.. not that intel weird thingy
