2005-04-01T08:57:00.000Z	thully		However, at least Ubuntu's stable releases actually have a kernel/software from this century...
2005-04-01T08:58:00.000Z	thully		no - same thing
2005-04-01T08:59:00.000Z	thully		HSF is software modem, and HCF is controllerless I believe
2005-04-01T08:59:00.000Z	thully		They are both very similar - use slightly different drivers though
2005-04-01T09:00:00.000Z	thully		You can go to www.linuxant.com and download drivers - they have a free 14.4 driver and a full driver which costs
2005-04-01T09:00:00.000Z	thully		they have both software/controllerless
2005-04-01T09:01:00.000Z	thully		Also, many people's phone lines can only do 28.8 - like mine.  That's why I use a wireless (as in mobile phone technology, not wi-fi) connection.
2005-04-01T09:02:00.000Z	thully		no - it's debian based - uses it's own repository but is very similar to debian, only simpler
2005-04-01T09:03:00.000Z	thully		I actually find the fact that Ubuntu uses it's own repo to be an advantage - no dealing with unstable/testing and non-standard packages
2005-04-01T09:04:00.000Z	thully		I always think it's a bit weird that people run Linux on Macs - isn't their main appeal Mac OS?
2005-04-01T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	the mac is nice hardware - and I like my iBook G4 with linux better than OS-X
2005-04-01T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	Linus Torvalds runs a G5 BTW
2005-04-01T09:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	probably a dev library (that's the usual problem anyway)
2005-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	grumpy will be the "everything breaks" unstable version ;)
2005-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	wart >> hoary >> breezy
2005-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	I think so
2005-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	not really - debian testing changes, breezy won't
2005-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	once it's released I mean
2005-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thully	like hoary until Friday, yeah
