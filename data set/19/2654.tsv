2011-02-22T01:03:00.000Z	khafra		I just installed the latest updates, rebooted, and now 10 seconds after logging in I can no longer access any active elements of Gnome
2011-02-22T01:03:00.000Z	khafra		Can't move windows around, click on menus, anything
2011-02-22T01:03:00.000Z	khafra		This is a terminal window I opened before the gui freeze.
2011-02-22T01:04:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	try ctrl+alt+f1, then ctrl+alt+f7 to switch to a console and back; some grabs can do that and if you're lucky it'll break it
2011-02-22T01:05:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	if you can't switch than that's interesting indeed
2011-02-22T01:05:00.000Z	khafra	ohsix	I can switch, it just doesn't help
2011-02-22T01:06:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	can you login on the terminal and do DISPLAY=:0 xlsclients
2011-02-22T01:13:00.000Z	khafra	ohsix	This time, the GUI started working again, about 20 seconds after it froze. Still nothing on /var/log/messages
2011-02-22T01:13:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	try ~/.xsession-errors
2011-02-22T01:14:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	and xlsclients, it shows everything connected and the culprit is somewhere in there
2011-02-22T01:25:00.000Z	khafra	ohsix	That log provided some interesting googling fodder; thanks.  xlsclients is a good list to have, too
2011-02-22T01:25:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	no problem, good luck
2011-02-22T02:08:00.000Z	khafra	ohsix	Looks like it may very well be flash killing my system. I've put out an open contract on all Adobe VPs, as part of my bugfix attempt
2011-02-22T02:10:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	nice, are you using nspluginwrapper or an nvidia card?
2011-02-22T02:11:00.000Z	khafra	ohsix	nspluginwrapper--but my card is a gefore 9800 GT.  Dunno why Ubuntu chose nspluginwrapper
2011-02-22T02:11:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	well because theres no nonbeta flash plugin, you can purge flashplugin-installer and install the plugin manually
2011-02-22T02:11:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	if you're not running the 64bit edition then it's not nspluginwrapper
2011-02-22T02:12:00.000Z	khafra	ohsix	64-bit AMD
2011-02-22T02:13:00.000Z	ohsix	khafra	yea so uninstall flash from the package manager and get the .so for 64bit flash from adobe, stash it in ~/.mozilla/plugins
