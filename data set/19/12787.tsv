2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	rob^^^		Dr: if you need another machine you can have my Dell Outlet script
2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	rob^^^		;)
2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	rob^^^		that's why I haven't bought anything off the outlet
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	rob^^^		we were 2 desktops/2 laptops and now we are 1/2
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	rob^^^		and soon we may be 1/2 with the desktop being replaced by a server
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	rob^^^		I don't use a machine that has 256
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	rob^^^		I won't even touch one
2006-01-28T12:43:00.000Z	rob^^^		I remember people were like "64 megs on a 166? Your _never_ going to need that much ram"
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	rob^^^		ok so here is the dumb question of the hour: how do you tell what package owns a given file or directory?
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	rob^^^		I knew,  I forgot, and for the life of me I can't remember
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	installed package, or not installed?
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	rob^^^	dooglus	installed
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	dpkg -S
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	if it's not installed, get 'apt-file' and that will tell you
2006-01-28T12:46:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	you know you can "man dpkg" to see the flags, right?
2006-01-28T12:46:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	              dpkg -S | --search filename-search-pattern ...
2006-01-28T12:47:00.000Z	rob^^^	dooglus	I checked and didn't see it
2006-01-28T12:47:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	after doing "man dpkg" type "/search" and hit return
2006-01-28T12:48:00.000Z	dooglus	rob^^^	then hit 'n' a few times 'til it finds it
