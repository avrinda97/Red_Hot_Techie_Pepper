2007-05-08T14:25:00.000Z	mavers		Good afternoon all...I'm having some major problems getting my ubuntu workstation to boot (yes, I'm a n00b)  Can someone lend a hand?
2007-05-08T14:26:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	could you specify what exactly is happening?
2007-05-08T14:27:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	so you arent even getting a terminal?
2007-05-08T14:27:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	is this the first boot after install?
2007-05-08T14:28:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	 No, I've been using it for a day or two...was just trying to get some extra buttons on my logitech mouse working when I rebooted, then it didn't load.  I had to power down manually during this.
2007-05-08T14:29:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	I already undid the changes in xorg.conf that I had made when working on the mouse...that didn't solve anything
2007-05-08T14:30:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	and there is no error message either? hmmn
2007-05-08T14:31:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	no error, when in recovery it loads a bunch of stuff, then the last line I saw was something like 58.123456 ===================  (not exact number)
2007-05-08T14:32:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	 Is there a way from the live cd that i can backup everything in my home/<user> directory and then just reinstall?
2007-05-08T14:32:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	oh, then maybe the disk is corrupted.. try booting from a live CD and see if the drives are ok..
2007-05-08T14:32:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	 I have it booted to a live cd...how do I check the drive?
2007-05-08T14:32:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	the partition is mounted automatically?
2007-05-08T14:33:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	I was able to mount it using nautilus (double-clicked the 54G disk in the left hand pane)
2007-05-08T14:34:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	then just get the home dir out safely (copied somewhere over network or somewhere online)
2007-05-08T14:35:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	randomly check if the files are ok..
2007-05-08T14:35:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	actually, try "fsck", this might fix the prob (i.e. IF the disk had some hiccups)
2007-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	fsck won't run on that drive as it is ext3 not ext2
2007-05-08T14:53:00.000Z	dotpavan	mavers	it works for ext3, just force it (man fsck has good syntax examples)..
2007-05-08T15:09:00.000Z	mavers	dotpavan	it says it is clean
