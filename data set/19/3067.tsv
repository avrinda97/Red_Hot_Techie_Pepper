2010-04-15T09:09:00.000Z	hylian		yes i have a ubuntu 9.10 cd, cofirm,ed 100% error free (nice program by the way, built in and all), so i dont get this
2010-04-15T09:10:00.000Z	hylian		and i dont understand the grub command for installing it via the terminal
2010-04-15T09:11:00.000Z	hylian		the system says there is no master boot record, so it cant boot.
2010-04-15T09:11:00.000Z	hylian		if it wheren't for the live cd, i wouldnt have a machine right now
2010-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	hylian		why do you use apt-get to install what is already there...??
2010-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	hylian		nope. nothing to do with windows.
2010-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	hylian		0% windows problem
2010-04-15T09:13:00.000Z	hylian		i want to know how to have grub install itself to the hard drive, thats what i meant
2010-04-15T09:14:00.000Z	hylian		no wuni install. i told ubuntu it could have one whole drive. it then took that drive and formatted it, installed ubuntu, but idd not install a mbr or grub. windows no longer exists on this computer and is out of the equation.
2010-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	hylian		this is the second time in installed. i am not gonna reinstall again just to be reinstalling this xchat program just to tell you it didnt work for a third time
2010-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	kuttans	hylian	have you specified the /boot while doing a partioning portion of the wubi install?
2010-04-15T09:18:00.000Z	kuttans	hylian	you mean to say the grub is not installing itself in the hard disk or the mbr?? on new installation??
2010-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	kuttans	hylian	there is nothing much to it, by the way you can specify which is the boot partition while installing, its just simple
2010-04-15T09:22:00.000Z	kuttans	hylian	open gparted and check whats the name of your hdd
2010-04-15T09:26:00.000Z	kuttans	hylian	sorry i dint tracked your issue

2010-04-15T09:27:00.000Z	kuttans	hylian	you mean to say you have another hdd with pclinuxos on it? and the one you are using for ubuntu is a second one?
