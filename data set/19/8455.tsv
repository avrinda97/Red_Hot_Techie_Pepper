2007-03-25T08:53:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	Are you stuck right now?
2007-03-25T08:53:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	If so, you might get back to the login with control-alt-backspace
2007-03-25T08:59:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	Does it freeze up at the song?
2007-03-25T09:00:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	What kind of sound card?
2007-03-25T09:00:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	OK, here's a test: go into your bios, and disable the sound card.  Then try.
2007-03-25T09:00:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	If it works, it's something with the sound card.
2007-03-25T09:11:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	ok, can you switch to <alt><f1>, at the text login?
2007-03-25T09:11:00.000Z	Mugwump09	sbalneav	what does that do?
2007-03-25T09:11:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	login as yourself, and see where it's at at the login.  Be interesting to see where it's hanging up at with a ps -ef
2007-03-25T09:19:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	how did you install it? With the live CD?
2007-03-25T09:20:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	Might be something with your video card.  What kind is it?
2007-03-25T09:22:00.000Z	sbalneav	Mugwump09	Well, don't know what I can suggest.  In the past, when I've had this sort of locking up, I fixed it by updating my bios.  So you might want to check if there's a bios update for your mobo.
