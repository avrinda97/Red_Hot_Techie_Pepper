2010-11-06T02:11:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	if you can't run the ati file, put a "./" in front of it.
2010-11-06T02:12:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	this isn't Windows.  In Linux, the current directory isn
2010-11-06T02:12:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	this isn't Windows.  In Linux, the current directory isn't in the PATH
2010-11-06T02:13:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	littlegirl it looks like somehow gedit is the default program to open ".run" files.  I would guess that is the problem of trying to run it in the GUI
2010-11-06T02:14:00.000Z	n0a1ias	sjm	how would you open it?
2010-11-06T02:15:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	I know, I was explaining one of the differences in Linux.  Why you got the "command not found" when trying to run the ati file.  It wasn't in the PATH.  You can explicitly run it by specifying the exact full or relative path to the file.
2010-11-06T02:16:00.000Z	n0a1ias	sjm	i tried it in the downloads folder too
2010-11-06T02:16:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	littlegirl   to run the file in the terminal, just prepend it (if you are in the same directory) with a "./" (without the quotation marks)
2010-11-06T02:16:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	littlegirl and make sure it is "executable"  (chmod +x <filename>)
2010-11-06T02:22:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	is the file "executable"?  do an "ls -l ati...," and see if the "x" bits are set.
2010-11-06T02:25:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	it's a continuation of the line above.  If you didn't close a quotation mark, it's waiting for the rest of the line to be typed in.
2010-11-06T02:26:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	littlegirl it won't run because it's not marked as being executable.  use the command:  chmod +x ati...
2010-11-06T02:29:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	you need to learn about tab completion  :)
2010-11-06T02:29:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	you can type in the first few letters and then <tab> and it will complete as much as it can of the command
2010-11-06T02:30:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	or filename
2010-11-06T02:32:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	littlegirl now just run it with: ./ati<tab>
2010-11-06T02:34:00.000Z	sjm	n0a1ias	have fun!  glad it's working.
