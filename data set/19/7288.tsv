2007-09-15T09:48:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 you'd better not beryl even on your system if you are running compiz
2007-09-15T09:49:00.000Z	begasus_	kkathman	 .. it's just the version that comes with ubuntu
2007-09-15T09:49:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 well there is a diff between compiz, beryl and compiz-fusion
2007-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 its a series of programs
2007-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 its not in standard repos either
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusion
2007-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	begasus_	kkathman	.. I don't see anything else there then the default compiz ..
2007-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 I just said, you have to add repositories
2007-09-15T09:55:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 no, compiz-fusion isnt installed by default in feisty
2007-09-15T09:55:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusion
2007-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	begasus_	kkathman	 maybe there is an iso with compiz in it by default?
2007-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 not an official one
2007-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 however, if you DID install gutsy, thats possible since they plan to make compiz-fusion be standard IF
2007-09-15T09:57:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 but if you are truly on 7.04/Feisty, compiz-fusion isnt default, because its not even in the standard repos (you have to add the amaranth repos or trevino ones)
2007-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 if you check out that page I pasted now twice to you, you'll see
2007-09-15T09:59:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 hehe - no prob man.. lots of things happen..just that the standard Ubuntu/Kubuntu ISOs purposely left compiz-fusion out, cuz it wasnt near ready in July :)
2007-09-15T10:16:00.000Z	begasus_	kkathman	http://www.newlinuxuser.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/ubscr1.png
2007-09-15T10:17:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 compiz yes,  not compiz-fusion
2007-09-15T10:20:00.000Z	kkathman	begasus_	 Basically, beryl was a fork of compiz, and they have merged back together with a new product, compiz-fusion. Beryl will not be supported in the future.
