2007-08-20T06:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Jaydoggg	 ndiswrapper is only needed if you have to use the window driver
2007-08-20T06:45:00.000Z	Pelo	Jaydoggg	 ask a specific question ,  what do you need to do at this point

2007-08-20T06:49:00.000Z	Jaydoggg	Pelo	nobody has tried to help.  If it were windows i'd tell someone to do me a quick ipconfig /all to see what devices are installed...what do do in linux as an equivelant?
2007-08-20T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	Jaydoggg	  ifconfig is the linux equivalent of ipconfig
