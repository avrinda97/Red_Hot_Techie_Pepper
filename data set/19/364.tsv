2012-05-15T02:31:00.000Z	cuddylier		How would I give specific ftp access for a user to certain folders on ubuntu? I want to rent out a game server on my server but, dont want them to have full access to all my files via ftp
2012-05-15T02:32:00.000Z	e2b04836	cuddylier	which ftpd?
2012-05-15T02:32:00.000Z	cuddylier		Yes
2012-05-15T02:32:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	Yes
2012-05-15T02:33:00.000Z	e2b04836	cuddylier	which one are you using ie vsftpd
2012-05-15T02:33:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	Just sftpd I think.
2012-05-15T02:35:00.000Z	e2b04836	cuddylier	are you actually using ftp or sftp?
2012-05-15T02:35:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	sftp
2012-05-15T02:36:00.000Z	e2b04836	cuddylier	it would be much easier to achieve what you want with ftp you can restrict users to /home/<username>
2012-05-15T02:36:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	is it still possible with sftp and is ftp not less secure?
2012-05-15T02:37:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	Also, would it be easy to switch to ftp?
2012-05-15T02:37:00.000Z	e2b04836	cuddylier	it is less secure however you can enable encryption if its needed
2012-05-15T02:37:00.000Z	e2b04836		also i believe it is possible with sftp but it's much harder
2012-05-15T02:37:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	I am a complete n00b, would that be easy and if so, how would I actually change to ftp and enable encryption?

2012-05-15T02:38:00.000Z	e2b04836		that has all the info you need including encryption and chrooting
2012-05-15T02:39:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	Would this program conflict with my current sftp?
2012-05-15T02:39:00.000Z	e2b04836	cuddylier	no
2012-05-15T02:39:00.000Z	cuddylier	e2b04836	Good, thanks
