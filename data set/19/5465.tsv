2008-06-25T05:50:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	i'm having several issues. The first one which is most important is that I have lost my top panel and cannot seem to be able to put it back
2008-06-25T05:50:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		hiptobecubic^:Yes but do I just type in my IP on TightVNC?
2008-06-25T05:51:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		tstiffler88:Right click the bottom panel and click add panel
2008-06-25T05:51:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	i do not have a bottom panel, I have the AWN dock down there
2008-06-25T05:52:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		tstiffler88:I think there is some command to do it but I dont know it. Make a new account from the terminal and log in
2008-06-25T05:52:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		hiptocubic^:I have tried on my PPC Mac and WinXP desktop but no luck
2008-06-25T05:52:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	i just added a menu to the AWN that allows me to see the menus that were in the panel, is there a setting in administration or system that will let me add a panel?
2008-06-25T05:53:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		tstiffler88:Maybe.
2008-06-25T05:54:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	ok, well..I can wait for that for now, I am having another issue with my fstab. It has extra mount points in it and I'm not sure which one to go with
2008-06-25T05:55:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		tstiffler:Explain more
2008-06-25T05:55:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	here is what my fstab looks like, http://pastebin.com/m4a7db486 I have two sda7 (one which is commented) and I don't know which one to use
2008-06-25T05:57:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall	tstiffler88	Are you wanting to change your mount point or what?
2008-06-25T05:58:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	I want to have the right one mounted, and the other one removed. I get an error when I boot about sda7 already being mounted when it tries to boot, and I have to hit ctrl +d before I can login
2008-06-25T05:59:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall	tstiffler88	something like this http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-368654.html
2008-06-25T06:00:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	i don't think that will help me too much
2008-06-25T06:01:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	what if I just make a backup of all of my files and everything, and then reinstalled ubuntu after wiping out the other partitions? do you think that this may solve all of my issues?
2008-06-25T06:02:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		tstiffler88:Try googling or the ubuntu forums. I would stay and help but I have to go make a house call. You could back up your files and reinstall but then that would probably take longer than a fix
2008-06-25T06:03:00.000Z	tstiffler88	linuxguymarshall	alright, thanks so much for the help.
