2005-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	keats_		hi guys. i can't play mp3s with rhythmbox
2005-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	keats_		in xmms it works fine
2005-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-04-18T07:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	try sudo gst-register0.8
2005-04-18T07:58:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	it doesn't work
2005-04-18T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	OK - it was worth a try - sometimes helps
2005-04-18T07:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	do you have system sounds?
2005-04-18T08:00:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	i guess that if i can listen to music in xmms in have it, or am i wrong ?
2005-04-18T08:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	rhythmbox uses gstreamer - xmms probably is using mpg123 or similar
2005-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	yes i have them
2005-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	i can listen to the sounds gnome makes
2005-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	hmm - dunno - you could try sudo dpkg-reconfigure gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-04-18T08:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	it seems to be a gstreamer problem
2005-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	hmmm is that fixable ?
2005-04-18T08:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	did you try the reconfigure command I posted?
2005-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	still nothing
2005-04-18T08:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	this is a desperation measure, but you can try  sudo init 1 to go right down to single user level, then ctrl-D to get back to X and gdm - it might kick-start your sound system
2005-04-18T08:12:00.000Z	keats_	thoreauputic	shouldn't a simple restart do the same thing ?
2005-04-18T08:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	keats_	yes, it *should*
