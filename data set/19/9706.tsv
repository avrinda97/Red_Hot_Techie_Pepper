2006-09-27T09:25:00.000Z	ivaldi	scrp	I can't see that video you linked to either
2006-09-27T09:26:00.000Z	scrp	ivaldi	....its easy to watch in windows
2006-09-27T09:27:00.000Z	ivaldi	scrp	yes they do. the codecs are proprietary.
2006-09-27T09:28:00.000Z	ivaldi	scrp	it could be illegal depending on which country you live in.
2006-09-27T09:29:00.000Z	ivaldi	scrp	microsoft pays licensing fees in order to have mp3 support included in windows.
