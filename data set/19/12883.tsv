2005-08-06T09:54:00.000Z	nmsa		I have a d-link router; my ubuntu has 192.168.0.1; my router has a WAN IP, how can I find out the wan IP from ubuntu?
2005-08-06T09:56:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	from outside (other computer/internet) or accessing to you router
2005-08-06T09:57:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	www.whatismyip.com
2005-08-06T09:57:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	what I meant is to run a script in ubuntu box who mails me the WAN Dynamic IP so anytime I can access it
2005-08-06T09:57:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	no-ip.org dyndns.org
2005-08-06T09:58:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	there's tools which do that automaticly, and then you have to just remebmer one hostname like nmsa.no-ip.org when connecting
2005-08-06T09:59:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	my D-link has this dyndns feature, but it doesn't work ok at all
2005-08-06T09:59:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	don't use that, use no-ip from you computer :)
2005-08-06T10:00:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	no-ip work from my private ip?
2005-08-06T10:00:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	what do you mean by private ip
2005-08-06T10:00:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	ubuntu get 192.168.0.100 from d-link
2005-08-06T10:01:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	so?
2005-08-06T10:03:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	you always get lan ip if your using nat :/
2005-08-06T10:04:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	so? how do I know my WAN ?
2005-08-06T10:04:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	www.whatismyip.com :)
2005-08-06T10:04:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	yes no-ip will do
2005-08-06T10:05:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	I see :) 'thnx; one more thing: is there a auto update software for no-ip or dyndns >
2005-08-06T11:25:00.000Z	nmsa	anacron	do you use ipcheck?
2005-08-06T11:26:00.000Z	anacron	nmsa	im not sure
