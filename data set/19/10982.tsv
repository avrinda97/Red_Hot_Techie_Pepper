2006-06-05T08:54:00.000Z	reza	neutrinomass	: yes dhcp is not working :( sad  but true lol
2006-06-05T08:54:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	Heh :D
2006-06-05T08:54:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	Don't touch anything regarding ifconfig and dhcp settings, they are all fine.
2006-06-05T08:55:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	'sudo rmmod tulip && sudo rmmod dmfe && sudo modprobe dmfe' and your problem is fixed :)
2006-06-05T08:55:00.000Z	reza	neutrinomass	: i know but how can i fix it?
2006-06-05T08:55:00.000Z	reza	neutrinomass	: is it?
2006-06-05T08:56:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	Yes. I nearly killed myself trying to figure out what's wrong. I put up a wiki page to help others but apparently you didn't run across it.
2006-06-05T08:56:00.000Z	reza	neutrinomass	: i couldnt find any help in the net :( thanks :)
2006-06-05T08:56:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	AFAIK it broke after breezy (I never had the chance to use breezy so I don't know). It will be fixed in the next kernel update for dapper

2006-06-05T09:05:00.000Z	reza	neutrinomass	how can i set it in startup?
2006-06-05T09:05:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	I'm not sure about that part... I don't use my NIC anyway .... gimme a sec please
2006-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	 I think you have to add 'tulip' in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, but I'm not sure ...
2006-06-05T09:08:00.000Z	reza	neutrinomass	never mind it is working ! 2 days i was searching for a solution thx again ! :D
2006-06-05T09:09:00.000Z	neutrinomass	reza	I know how you feel. I had just bought a router + nic combination and didn't know what was wrong. I know 0 of networking (0 though) so it was *painful* :)
