2008-07-30T04:17:00.000Z	regeya	gavi	what's your question?  ddrescue is pretty easy to use
2008-07-30T04:17:00.000Z	gavi	regeya	thanks for the reply, im trying to copy a directory to another directory
2008-07-30T04:17:00.000Z	regeya		you caught me about to go home for the day :-)
2008-07-30T04:18:00.000Z	gavi	regeya	my guess is ddrescue /media/mydisk/thelocation /home/myuser/myfolder
2008-07-30T04:18:00.000Z	regeya		oh...gavi, well, if you're just copying a directory, that's not really the purpose of the thing...really, the purpose is if, say, you have a drive about to go out, and want to make an image of the drive.
2008-07-30T04:18:00.000Z	regeya	gavi	however, a good choice for doing that would be...

2008-07-30T04:20:00.000Z	gavi		did i miss something
