2007-08-12T16:13:00.000Z	Cartas		Um, fnf:  I couldn't find a Thunderbird package at getdeb.net, unfortunately!
2007-08-12T16:14:00.000Z	Cartas		The one I used from Add/Remove is a really old version.
2007-08-12T16:15:00.000Z	Cartas		I downloaded a new one from Mozilla, Paddy_EIRE, but I've no idea how to install from a tar.gz.  I tried extracting and using the ./configure, make and make install way, but it didn't work.
2007-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	Cartas		What's an aptitude install then?  Paddy_EIRE:  I've no idea about Mint Flavours.  I'm using Ubuntu 7.04.
2007-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	Cartas		Um, is that a particular extension?
2007-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	Cartas		There is none.
2007-08-12T16:17:00.000Z	Cartas		For information about installing, running and configuring Thunderbird
2007-08-12T16:17:00.000Z	Cartas		including a list of known issues and troubleshooting information,

2007-08-12T16:19:00.000Z	Cartas		Just say when it's downloaded, fnf! :)
