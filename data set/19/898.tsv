2011-07-27T04:21:00.000Z	esing2		and i found out that i used x11vnc
2011-07-27T04:21:00.000Z	esing2		as a server
2011-07-27T04:22:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	x11vnc is for connecting to a real X server.
2011-07-27T04:23:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	If you don't need this use something else (vnc4server or similar)
2011-07-27T04:23:00.000Z	esing2	vlt	what is a real X server ?
2011-07-27T04:24:00.000Z	esing2	vlt	I want to access my VPS through gui
2011-07-27T04:24:00.000Z	esing2		(remotly)
2011-07-27T04:24:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	An X server runs on the machine where a display, keyboard and mouse is attached to.
2011-07-27T04:24:00.000Z	esing2		good to know
2011-07-27T04:25:00.000Z	esing2		thanks!
2011-07-27T04:25:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	When you want to connect to such a (client) machine use x11vnc
2011-07-27T04:25:00.000Z	esing2		no i want to connect to a sever
2011-07-27T04:25:00.000Z	esing2		*vps server
2011-07-27T04:25:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	For "emulating" an X server your programs send data to use vncserver
2011-07-27T04:26:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	and connect to it via vnc
2011-07-27T04:26:00.000Z	esing2		i'll connect from Windows
2011-07-27T04:26:00.000Z	esing2		can I still use "vnc4server" for that?
2011-07-27T04:27:00.000Z	vlt	esing2	Yes. You need to run something like vnc4server on  the server. Then you can connect from windows -- please use ssh tunnel -- and run programs on the server that depend on a running X server.
2011-07-27T04:28:00.000Z	esing2	vlt	ok ill try it out. thanks+
