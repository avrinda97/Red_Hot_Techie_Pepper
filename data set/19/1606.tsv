2011-03-07T03:35:00.000Z	ShawnRisk		how do I change the location of my documents folder?
2011-03-07T03:36:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	 you can just drag and drop the folder anywhere you want
2011-03-07T03:38:00.000Z	noonian		Guest68527, you might not have flash installed sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
2011-03-07T03:38:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	when I use gmail, I want to add a file to my email, and click documents it goes to the wrong place.
2011-03-07T03:40:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	i'm pretty sure that it opens to whichever folder had the last file you sent as an attachment
2011-03-07T03:40:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	so if you attach something from documents it should open up there next time
2011-03-07T03:40:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	yes but how do I change the documents folder on there, which is the same as the listed folders in the places menu
2011-03-07T03:42:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	i'm not sure what you mean. do you want to rename it? or move it?
2011-03-07T03:42:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	I want to change the location
2011-03-07T03:43:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	i don't think you can do that from within the browser opened by gmail. But if you open a file browser you can drag the documents folder into whichever folder you want
2011-03-07T03:44:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	explain again the file browser please
2011-03-07T03:45:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	if you go to the places menu and then home folder you will see your documents folder there. You can drag that folder and drop it in a different folder
2011-03-07T03:46:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	I tried that and it didn't work
2011-03-07T03:46:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	how did it not work?
2011-03-07T03:46:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	was there an error message?
2011-03-07T03:48:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	it works sorry I moved the wrong folder the first time.
2011-03-07T03:48:00.000Z	noonian	ShawnRisk	hehe thats good :)
2011-03-07T03:49:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	noonian	thanks
