2010-10-05T02:30:00.000Z	juk		bug http://pastebin.com/2qpNqpHG ?
2010-10-05T02:30:00.000Z	trism	juk	do you have python-gconf installed?
2010-10-05T02:31:00.000Z	juk	trism	ii  python-gconf                                2.28.1-1ubuntu2
2010-10-05T02:33:00.000Z	juk	trism	ubuntu2 stands for lucid?
2010-10-05T02:34:00.000Z	trism	juk	no, ubuntu2 just means the second ubuntu version of a package, and it seems to be a bug because I have it here too, give me a minute to look at the code
2010-10-05T02:35:00.000Z	juk	trism	i don't understand any of python, thanks
2010-10-05T02:43:00.000Z	trism	juk	found the error, I'll submit a patch and hopefully it will be fixed soon, this is the patched file: http://pastebin.com/LCLbXLry (/usr/lib/gedit-2/plugins/pythonconsole/config.py) if you want a temporary fix (changed two lines)
2010-10-05T02:44:00.000Z	juk	trism	haha it was import gconf
2010-10-05T02:44:00.000Z	juk	trism	right?
2010-10-05T02:45:00.000Z	trism	juk	it was actually refering to the class scoped gconf module without the class prefix (so it looked in the global scope instead)
2010-10-05T02:45:00.000Z	trism	juk	I just added PythonConsoleConfig. to the two references, and the colors are now correctly saved and updated
2010-10-05T02:46:00.000Z	juk	trism	cool, import gconf also worked heh :p
2010-10-05T02:47:00.000Z	trism	juk	yes that would work too
2010-10-05T02:47:00.000Z	juk	trism	today my second bug in maverick, so you submitted?
