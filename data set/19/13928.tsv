2012-02-01T05:03:00.000Z	Rin		so question, does linux have a huge database of drivers that it can access?
2012-02-01T05:04:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	the linux kernel is full of "drivers"
2012-02-01T05:05:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	it chooses automatically and you rarely have to override it
2012-02-01T05:06:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	unless you are very unlucky, yes
2012-02-01T05:07:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	it is magic when it works... (which is most of the time)
2012-02-01T05:08:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	happy to reply in channel but I'm going to bed soon
2012-02-01T05:09:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	bit of both. Some of the drivers have had to be reverse engineered
2012-02-01T05:11:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	new drivers will be loaded automatically for new hardware. Ubuntu will offer alternative drivers if necessary
2012-02-01T05:11:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	as i said, when it works it is magic...
2012-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	some steam games work. Steam itself runs through an application called "wine"
2012-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	but don't expect much major-label support for ubuntu
2012-02-01T05:13:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	there is a user-friendly "app-market" type interface
2012-02-01T05:14:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	of course
2012-02-01T05:14:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	just about, yes
2012-02-01T05:15:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	there is no real support for silverlight
2012-02-01T05:16:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	better on ubuntu
2012-02-01T05:16:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	you can install the Windows fonts easily
2012-02-01T05:18:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	remeber you can try ubuntu by installing it from "within" windows
2012-02-01T05:18:00.000Z	mcphail	Rin	lol
