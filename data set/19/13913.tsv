2005-07-27T16:13:00.000Z	Cooner750		is it just me, or does QTParted seem a little incomplete!?
2005-07-27T16:14:00.000Z	Cooner750		I mean the menus, like"&Resize"
2005-07-27T16:16:00.000Z	Cooner750		UGH! %^%$& error
2005-07-27T16:16:00.000Z	Cooner750		How hard is it to resize a partition!?
2005-07-27T16:17:00.000Z	Cooner750		yea, I wish I had Partition Magic for windows. Now THAT would be nice.

2005-07-27T16:17:00.000Z	Cooner750		I get a error with that too
2005-07-27T16:17:00.000Z	Cooner750	Hunchback	Yes I know, but it's shareware
2005-07-27T16:18:00.000Z	Cooner750		I know, the trial version does not allow applying actions
2005-07-27T16:18:00.000Z	Cooner750		so... it's kind of useless
