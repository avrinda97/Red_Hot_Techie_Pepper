2011-10-03T00:41:00.000Z	chalcedony		i need help getting pulseaudio to work: my computer currently has no sound. desktop ubuntu 11.04, 00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc SBx00 Azalia (Intel HDA) - Sound Preferences Hardware is set to Analog Stereo Duplex. i was messing with that, trying to get it not to sound like glass smashing on foil, and it quit working.
2011-10-03T00:42:00.000Z	chalcedony		for my next death defying trick i get to take apart the washing machine. can someone help with ubuntu sound?
2011-10-03T00:43:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	type 'alsamixer' in a console and see what is muted
2011-10-03T00:44:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	it looks like maybe <Headphone> is - and that's the plug i have my speakers in?
2011-10-03T00:46:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	but it does talk when i do speaker test in the terminal.
2011-10-03T00:47:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	if headphones is muted and that's where you expect sound to come out, you should unmute the headphones
2011-10-03T00:47:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	i don't see how to do that?
2011-10-03T00:48:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	in alsamixer, move left/right until you've highlighted the right one, then hit 'm' to mute or unmute
2011-10-03T00:49:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	doesn't change the color - it's the only one that isn't green/white/red with blue at the bottom.
2011-10-03T00:50:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	it should change the bottom part. It should change between 'm' and something else every time you hit 'm'
2011-10-03T00:51:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	i appreciate it..
2011-10-03T00:52:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	that's a bit weird, I dunno.
2011-10-03T00:52:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	I don't really know what pulse does to things, perhaps that's part of the issue.
2011-10-03T00:53:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	yeah.. i updatead the drivers because of the crunching
2011-10-03T00:54:00.000Z	chalcedony	Shirakawasuna	i turned things off and on again in the gui stuff
2011-10-09T09:54:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	nope
2011-10-09T09:54:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	you can choose any window borders you'd like, and revert easily.
2011-10-09T09:56:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	Well, you're going to install a window border theme. In the same app that you use to switch themes (I forget the exact name, as I use xubuntu), there will be several options. One of them is the default. You can try them out right now if you'd like.
2011-10-09T09:56:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	chalcedony	it's going to be in 'appearances' or 'window borders'
