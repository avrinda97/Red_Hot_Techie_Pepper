2008-09-13T13:08:00.000Z	excelblue		how do I extract the current xorg.conf from a live ubuntu?
2008-09-13T13:08:00.000Z	excelblue		I've been having all sorts of issues getting video working in my Linux distro, but ubuntu configures it perfectly
2008-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	excelblue		however, the xorg.conf supplied in /etc/X11/xorg.conf doens't even contain the driver, much less anything else
2008-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	chubs_	excelblue	cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf destination
2008-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	excelblue		hmm - but those xorg.conf contain almost no data?
2008-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	excelblue		does that mean that xorg is left to figure out the rest?
2008-09-13T13:10:00.000Z	excelblue	debCarlos	ArchLinux
2008-09-13T13:10:00.000Z	excelblue		yeah - videocard is Intel X4500HD
2008-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	excelblue		supposedly, the driver to use is "intel"
2008-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	excelblue		but I've been having some serious stability issues with it
2008-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	excelblue		and the fonts don't display
2008-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	excelblue	debCarlos	no - it uses its own minimalist system called pacman
2008-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	excelblue		no kidding - it's called pacman :)
2008-09-13T13:12:00.000Z	excelblue		one would expect a nice game to pop up
2008-09-13T13:12:00.000Z	chubs_		package manager. sigh
2008-09-13T13:12:00.000Z	excelblue		I'd called it pkgmgr
2008-09-13T13:13:00.000Z	chubs_		probably avoiding confusion with slackware excelblue
2008-09-13T13:13:00.000Z	excelblue		slackware now has pkgmgr? hmm...
2008-09-13T13:13:00.000Z	chubs_	excelblue	pkgtool
