2006-11-13T15:45:00.000Z	eobanb	BrightEyes`	that sounds like a mac os x question
2006-11-13T15:45:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	eobanb	: thats linux isnt it??? mac os x isnt linux?
2006-11-13T15:46:00.000Z	eobanb	BrightEyes`	well if you're trying to use oroborOSX (which is the mac os x port of oroborus) then it has nothing to do with ubuntu or linux.
2006-11-13T15:46:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	eobanb	: why??? i can find it source code in tar.gz
2006-11-13T15:47:00.000Z	eobanb	BrightEyes`	please listen.  oroborus is an X11 environment for MAC OS X, NOT LINUX
2006-11-13T15:47:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	eobanb	: any similar to it?
2006-11-13T15:47:00.000Z	eobanb	BrightEyes`	oroborus is in universe
2006-11-13T15:48:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	eobanb	what do you mean "is in universe" ?
2006-11-13T15:48:00.000Z	eobanb	BrightEyes`	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=oroborus&searchon=names&subword=1&version=edgy&release=all
2006-11-13T15:49:00.000Z	eobanb	BrightEyes`	next time instead of asking about some mac os x crap you can at least apt-cache search for the package.
2006-11-13T15:50:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	eobanb	edgy (x11): A lightweight themeable windowmanager for X [universe]
