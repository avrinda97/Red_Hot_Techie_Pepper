2009-09-02T05:25:00.000Z	histo	burf	lspci | grep VGA
2009-09-02T05:26:00.000Z	histo	burf	what type of video card do you have?
2009-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	histo	burf	it is if your video is working I believe those cards use software rendering though. So you  may not be able to run compiz.
2009-09-02T05:33:00.000Z	histo	burf	you may want to check on the forums and search for your card. Perhaps someone will have the same make model and similiar issues
2009-09-02T05:34:00.000Z	histo	burf	hrm... try glxinfo | grep render
2009-09-02T05:53:00.000Z	histo	burf	cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep sis
2009-09-02T05:54:00.000Z	histo	burf	no the line isn't in there thats why its returning nothing
2009-09-02T05:54:00.000Z	histo	burf	lsmod | grep sis
2009-09-02T05:59:00.000Z	histo	burf	where is that file saved? because its not /etc/X11/xorg.conf if grep isn't finding it
2009-09-02T06:01:00.000Z	histo	burf	well you can fix the file and restart X
2009-09-02T06:03:00.000Z	histo	burf	yes Driver "sis" being the important wone you may not need the PCI id
2009-09-02T06:03:00.000Z	histo	burf	yes it matters lowercase
2009-09-02T06:40:00.000Z	histo	burf	what app are you looking for?
2009-09-02T06:41:00.000Z	histo	burf	well if they have a .deb availbe that is the easiest way otherwise you will mostlikely have to install it from source
