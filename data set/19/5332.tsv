2008-08-01T14:25:00.000Z	pobbel		G'day all
2008-08-01T14:27:00.000Z	pobbel		I am looking for a mini pci wifi card, what chipsets have less issues with ubuntu?
2008-08-01T14:27:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	depends on what you want to use it for
2008-08-01T14:28:00.000Z	pobbel	sn9	just home wifi
2008-08-01T14:37:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	no, very few chipsets need ndiswrapper anymore
2008-08-01T14:38:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	are you wanting to replace an existing MiniPCI?
2008-08-01T14:39:00.000Z	pobbel	sn9	thats good, I am still having issues with my current linksys based card, it is easier to get another card given tha amount of time I have tried sorting it out.

2008-08-01T14:41:00.000Z	pobbel	sn9	neti2220 /  inprocomm   ipn2220
2008-08-01T14:41:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	yecchh
2008-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	inprocomm driver situation is *blows raspberry*
2008-08-01T14:43:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	you got the worst possible card in the world for linux
2008-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	as long as you replace it with *anything* else, you're good to go. even broadcom, ActionParsnip
2008-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	pobbel	sn9	gee thanks, I don't feel so bad now.  I thought I was stuffing something up, but its just the card
2008-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	that works
2008-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	i would recommend a ralink RT2800 in the long term, but that won't work out-of-the-box yet
2008-08-01T15:14:00.000Z	pobbel	sn9	they seem fairly common, is WAP the norm or still better to stick with WEP for now, I have read there were issues with WAP but not sure what the progress is
2008-08-01T15:14:00.000Z	sn9	pobbel	WPA generally works in 8.04 for most drivers. biggest notable exception is Texas Instruments
2008-08-01T15:15:00.000Z	pobbel	sn9	my current card does not support it but my router does so I have not really played with it
