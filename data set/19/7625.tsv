2011-01-10T00:43:00.000Z	benedict		hi, i installed ubuntu 10.10 minmal, and now i have it up and running with fluxbox :) but now i am a bit confused: during install and even during running in commandline, the system sometimes "falls asleep"/gets stuck/pauses during executing a command. then i have to "wake it up" by pressing a key or moving the mouse. during installation, i often had to keep one key pressed to keep the install running. hwo can i fix that.
2011-01-10T00:44:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	are you sure? that sounds very very odd
2011-01-10T00:46:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	yes. i am surprised my self. sometimes (very seldom) i experience someting similar when booting my 10.04 (but i did not complain becuase i messed with it a lot). i tried a test install of a debian system, and it didn't have that probs. i install from pendrive to a leovo ideapad s12 (netbook with atom processor)
2011-01-10T00:47:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	perhaps a hardware issue with the netbook.
2011-01-10T00:47:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	the problems only appear when i am using a (virtual) terminal.
2011-01-10T00:47:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	hm... but why does debian work like charm?
2011-01-10T00:48:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	I didn't see that you mentioned a terminal. That's even odder, terminal just works
2011-01-10T00:49:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	it it very strange. also, maybe you can verify this for me: in 10.04 when doing sudo aptitude update i get a lot of console ouptut. in 10.10 i only get one line, that always deplays the actual action
2011-01-10T00:50:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	In 10.10 it also outputs a lot of "Hit: http://archives..."
2011-01-10T00:51:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	so it's writing every message into a new line?
2011-01-10T00:52:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	yes, in every line. In there is thing that says "0% working" and then updates itself, but after that, the rest of the output is in new lines. Slightly different than 10.04, but not that different.
2011-01-10T00:53:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	at my system i only get one line that get udpated :( first i thought it might be becuase i use minimal install, but i tried the normal ubuntu live cd too and it has the same symptoms
2011-01-10T00:54:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	hm... now sudo aptitude update behaves normal.. strange
2011-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	that's strange... oh, you fixed it.
2011-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	i didn't do anything
2011-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	you talked to me... that's enough in most cases to solve things
2011-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	although i appreciate your "help" i'm not 100% satisfied... but at least released ;)
2011-01-10T00:58:00.000Z	benedict	vocx	thank you for your assistance/time/patience ... i'll be off, doing some rebooting and stuff...
2011-01-10T00:59:00.000Z	vocx	benedict	:)
