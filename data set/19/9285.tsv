2007-03-13T10:29:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	What you want to do is there
2007-03-13T10:38:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	:)
2007-03-13T10:43:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	did you install the trickle program? It was on the link I gave
2007-03-13T10:44:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	Ah, OK. No, the apt-get will be locked up.
2007-03-13T13:02:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	It is nothing crucial that must be applied immediately. you can defer it
2007-03-13T13:03:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	The update, yes
2007-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	You should do all of them at once when you do upgrades from a major dist to the next of the actual OS
2007-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	genii	Anabelle	If you are only doing a maintenance-type update then it is usually fine to defer some if they are huge. This is where I got confused and need to remove foot from mouth etc etc
