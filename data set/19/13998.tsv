2004-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	fc 3 doesn't even install here
2004-11-23T06:54:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	and ubuntu is more polished
2004-11-23T06:56:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	afaik fglrx doesn't run with xorg so you have to use the OSS drivers that are not the same :-/
2004-11-23T06:58:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	you sound like the guy to ask: I bought a <$100 radeon RV280 card specifically for use with the OSS drivers for my ubuntu box. How do well do the OSS drivers work (I assume you've tried them)
2004-11-23T06:58:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	is rv280 the radeon 9200 just like the ibook g4 1.1 onboard?
2004-11-23T07:00:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	it's a 9250. I believe it's an 'improvement' (die shrink? consolidation/integration)?
2004-11-23T07:01:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	i installed warty rc on my ibook (it's the only decent distro out ther for PPC, maybe gentoo is good too but i haven't tried)
2004-11-23T07:01:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	oh ok. Would you care to relate your experience?
2004-11-23T07:01:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	the OSS drivers work good anyway i had problems with xcomposite (i compiled xorg 6.8.1 by hand)
2004-11-23T07:02:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	i had problems with metacity that caused a xserver crash and using xfwm i managed to get xorg running with shadows but it was really slow
2004-11-23T07:03:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	anyway radeons work good using the xorg drivers, but i want to try them playing quake 3 :)
2004-11-23T07:03:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	:D
2004-11-23T07:03:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	glxgears give me 5329 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1065.800 FPS
2004-11-23T07:04:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	it's glxgears running on my rv250 (radeon 9000) using hoary
2004-11-23T07:04:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	ok.
2004-11-23T07:05:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	have you got some glxgears output to compare?
2004-11-23T07:05:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	no. Not yet.
2004-11-23T07:05:00.000Z	plfiorini	ermo	k
2004-11-23T07:05:00.000Z	ermo	plfiorini	sorry :/
