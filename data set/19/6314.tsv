2008-02-15T02:11:00.000Z	Che-Anarc		If Direct Rendering is not enabled after install... should I try enabling it somehow?... or does it just mean that there are no appropriate drivers for my system?
2008-02-15T02:11:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	what does lspci | grep -i vga   return?
2008-02-15T02:13:00.000Z	Che-Anarc	mjw-	VGA Comptable controller: Intel Corporation 82830 CGC rev 4
2008-02-15T02:14:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	use a pastebin to paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf  so I can see it
2008-02-15T02:20:00.000Z	Che-Anarc	mjw-	http://pastebin.ca/904318    its a bit messy in some parts since I am trying to get my touchscreen up and running
2008-02-15T02:22:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	but glxinfo | grep -i direct returns no?
2008-02-15T02:23:00.000Z	Che-Anarc	mjw-	Yes returns "No"  :-(
2008-02-15T02:23:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	is this a somewhat old system?
2008-02-15T02:23:00.000Z	Che-Anarc	mjw-	Yeah a little Toghbook P3 866 Laptop.
2008-02-15T02:27:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	http://pastebin.ca/904323   ....you may need to load some modules, see my modules section
2008-02-15T02:27:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	but ignore the rest...especially my device section ;)
2008-02-15T02:31:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	you are using the right driver though at least.
2008-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	any luck?
2008-02-15T03:25:00.000Z	Che-Anarc	mjw-	Thanks for the .conf... I'm trying those modules now  :-)
2008-02-15T03:26:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	you might also find    man intel   to be of some help
2008-02-15T03:34:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	you might try googling about for your chipset and xorg.conf ...might find some example ones
2008-02-15T03:34:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	the 82830 should work
2008-02-15T03:36:00.000Z	Che-Anarc	mjw-	 Any suggestions as what more I can try?... I've tried googling it without much luck but mind you I didnt try chipset.
2008-02-15T03:38:00.000Z	mjw-	Che-Anarc	from my searching it appears DRI with the 830 is crummy anyway...oh well :/
