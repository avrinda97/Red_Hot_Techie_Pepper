2007-06-30T16:19:00.000Z	vaurdan		Hey
2007-06-30T16:19:00.000Z	vaurdan		I'm with a problem
2007-06-30T16:19:00.000Z	vaurdan		My Wireless network is not detected
2007-06-30T16:19:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	do iwlist $interface scan
2007-06-30T16:20:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	lo        Interface doesn't support scanning.
2007-06-30T16:21:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	you are right then, it doesn't detect it
2007-06-30T16:21:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	are you sure it is on and working
2007-06-30T16:21:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	yes
2007-06-30T16:22:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	what can I do?
2007-06-30T16:22:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	um don't really know, it doesn't really appear to be a hardware failure or anything like that, is your wireless interface up
2007-06-30T16:23:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	what can I do now?
2007-06-30T16:24:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	what did your previous three comments mean
2007-06-30T16:24:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	now the wireless is detected
2007-06-30T16:24:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	what i do now?
2007-06-30T16:25:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	iwconfig $interface essid $essid
2007-06-30T16:25:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	unless it is encrypted, then you need to do something else too
2007-06-30T16:25:00.000Z	vaurdan	bruenig	how do I connect by the GUI?
2007-06-30T16:25:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	not sure, not a big gui fan
2007-06-30T16:27:00.000Z	bruenig	vaurdan	the only wireless gui I have used before is wifi-radar, but I think ubuntu tends to use the networkmanager framework so I am unfamiliar
