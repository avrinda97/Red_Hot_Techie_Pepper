2007-09-10T06:46:00.000Z	disinterested		i just added a second hard drive i had to use the jsata off my mb to hook it up but now its not detected?
2007-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	disinterested		yeah its a biostar mb
2007-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	is it detected by the bios ?
2007-09-10T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	 you need to have it detected in the bios first,  if your other drive is not sata you may need to set a jumper , check your mobo manual
2007-09-10T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	 most are ;-)
2007-09-10T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	 I have both sata and ide hdd on my comp and I have no problems, I also have 2 ide dvd-rw
2007-09-10T09:00:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	it just worked,  did you just install the sata ?
2007-09-10T09:01:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	does your bios see it ?<
2007-09-10T09:02:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	the sata is enabled and not visible in the bios ???? , check your mobo's manual see if you have a jumper so set or something
2007-09-10T09:03:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	can you use it to boot from in the bios ( I know there i nothing on it jet I jsut want to know if it is available)
2007-09-10T09:05:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	untill you can get your bios to see your sata it will not be available in ubuntu,  try checking the jumpers on the hdd as well , I think you need to set them to master,  or try taking out the jumper alltogether
2007-09-10T09:08:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	are you listening ?  take the sata hdd out and theck the jumpers on it
2007-09-10T09:29:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	yes ?
2007-09-10T09:30:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	 not quite what you were suppose to look for
2007-09-10T09:31:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	 was there a jumper on the sata hdd ?  I don'T need to know how it was set  I just want to know if there is one
2007-09-10T09:33:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	ok then,  I suggest you take your comp to a store and have them give it a shot  preferably the store where you bought and /or the computer,  there is little else we can do for you here , and it's a bit off topic anyway
2007-09-16T13:50:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	 questions regarding azureus are better directed to #azureus-support
2007-09-16T13:52:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	slave hdd are always read write , ifyou can't wite to it from ubuntu is is either because of permission or the filesystem used
2007-09-16T13:54:00.000Z	Pelo	disinterested	sudo chmod 755 /pathTo/mountpoint
