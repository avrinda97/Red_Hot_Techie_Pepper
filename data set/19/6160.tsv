2009-02-18T03:19:00.000Z	Lasivian		I need some troubleshooting help, my ethernet is giving me no DNS info and I do not know why
2009-02-18T03:20:00.000Z	Lasivian		The ethernet used to work fine and then suddenly it can;t resolve anything, yet ifconfig looks fine to my newbie eyes
2009-02-18T03:22:00.000Z	Lasivian		ping google.com
2009-02-18T03:23:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	do you have anything defined in /etc/resolv.conf?
2009-02-18T03:23:00.000Z	Lasivian	skel	blank
2009-02-18T03:23:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	that'd be why
2009-02-18T03:23:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	sounds like whatever is serving your dhcp isn't giving you a lease and giving you the dns servers
2009-02-18T03:24:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	run sudo dhclient
2009-02-18T03:24:00.000Z	Lasivian	skel	the wireless gets that data, on the same network
2009-02-18T03:24:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	then it could be a netmask config issue
2009-02-18T03:24:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	for that particular interface
2009-02-18T03:25:00.000Z	Lasivian	skel	the numbers look right for my network
2009-02-18T03:25:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	does the wired interface get a lease?
2009-02-18T03:26:00.000Z	Lasivian	skel	so that command forced a new dhcp address?
2009-02-18T03:27:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	it should try, yes
2009-02-18T03:27:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	did you get a new IP?
2009-02-18T03:27:00.000Z	Lasivian	skel	i'll add it to my toolbox, many thanks
2009-02-18T03:27:00.000Z	Lasivian	skel	it's working now, yes
2009-02-18T03:27:00.000Z	skel	Lasivian	ok good to hear :)
