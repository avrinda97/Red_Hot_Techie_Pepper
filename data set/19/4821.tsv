2009-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	iLogic		man.. intrepid ibex has been a _serious_ step backwards for nvidia drivers compatibility.. not only the native solution for proprietary drivers don't work, but it won't work with envy anymore.. *sigh*
2009-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	what card does lspci say you have?
2009-01-05T01:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/nvidia-glx-177
2009-01-05T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-177
2009-01-05T01:49:00.000Z	iLogic	ActionParsnip	it's already installed.. but needs to be actived
2009-01-05T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings; gksudo nvidia-settings
2011-08-05T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	is it listed in any menus after you type something. Possibly could also use tab followed by enter if one isn't listed
2011-08-05T23:25:00.000Z	iLogic	ActionParsnip	no it is not, and tab results in a indent space.. so am I right? gwibber is plain stupid?
2011-08-05T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	not something i use. I use tweetdeck for chromium
2011-08-05T23:28:00.000Z	iLogic	ActionParsnip	but dude, it's the default client for ubuntu.. don't you agree it is stupid not to have a keyboard shortcut for seding messages? you have to actually click the button after you type, that is plain stupid
2011-08-05T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	ctrl+enter like in ms outlook maybe..
2011-08-05T23:28:00.000Z	iLogic	ActionParsnip	tried it all.. just agree with me it is stupid
2011-08-05T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	default doesnt mean too much
2011-08-05T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	a shortcut would be a smart thing to have especially due to the nature of twitter (text)
2011-08-05T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	i think i got something
2011-08-05T23:32:00.000Z	iLogic	ActionParsnip	you mean like drugs?

2011-08-05T23:34:00.000Z	iLogic	ActionParsnip	but dont you agree it should be standard? as dr_willis suggested, i'm writing them an angrymail
2011-08-05T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iLogic	i guess but i found what you needed with websearching which you could have also found.
