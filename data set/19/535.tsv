2012-01-06T14:04:00.000Z	vartan		yeah i get i a ping
2012-01-06T14:05:00.000Z	vartan		i was just wondering why was it telling me that "service networking stop" -> "stop: unknown instance"
2012-01-06T14:05:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	are you sudoing those commands?
2012-01-06T14:06:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	yep
2012-01-06T14:06:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	"unknown instance" of what, I wonder...
2012-01-06T14:07:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	thats the message "stop: unknown instance"
2012-01-06T14:08:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	yes, but I wonder what it isn't finding an instance of... you said the networking was running, didn't you?
2012-01-06T14:09:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	yeah
2012-01-06T14:09:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	it seems as if it tries to say that "stop" is not a valid parameter of "service networking stop"
2012-01-06T14:10:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	same thing is i do "stop networking"
2012-01-06T14:10:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	there's no error message from "stop networking"?
2012-01-06T14:11:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	i ment that the error message was the same "stop: unknown instance"
2012-01-06T14:12:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	sorry, I misunderstood. Same with "/etc/init.d/networking stop", I assume?
2012-01-06T14:13:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	that where the punchline comes in, "etc/init.d/networking stop" works OK
2012-01-06T14:13:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	lol
2012-01-06T14:21:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	Humbedooh: i just tired this in 10.04 i have here and its the same, the "service networking" and the upstart script dont respond to stop...
2012-01-06T14:22:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	and again, the /etc/init.d... does?
2012-01-06T14:22:00.000Z	vartan	Chipzzz	yep
2012-01-06T14:23:00.000Z	Chipzzz	vartan	lol...
