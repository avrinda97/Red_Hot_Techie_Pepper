2010-06-21T23:26:00.000Z	abhi_nav	JackStoner	I succesfully connected to yahoo. you dont type example@yahoo.com just type 'example' and then password. try it
2010-06-21T23:27:00.000Z	JackStoner	abhi_nav	i tried with another account and it worked i think this account has an issue...wait i try something, thanks btw :)
2010-06-21T23:28:00.000Z	abhi_nav	JackStoner	yes It seems like problem with specific account and not with empathy.
2010-06-21T23:48:00.000Z	JackStoner	abhi_nav	i got my account locked :(
2010-06-21T23:48:00.000Z	abhi_nav	JackStoner	locked? how?
2010-06-21T23:48:00.000Z	JackStoner	abhi_nav	i think someone has been trying to log in many times using the wrong password so now i have a 24-hr block
2010-06-21T23:49:00.000Z	abhi_nav	JackStoner	ohhh so sad. try after 24 hr. and if you have alternate email set then ask it for forget password and set new password. (just my opinion)
2010-06-21T23:50:00.000Z	JackStoner	abhi_nav	wil try the alternate email thing :P thanks
