2009-05-14T03:58:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	TonyTheTiger have trouble pinging google....
2009-05-14T03:58:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	seems like a messed up install then :)
2009-05-14T03:59:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	man crypt 3
2009-05-14T04:00:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	a messed up university network and a messed up install
2009-05-14T04:05:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	TonyTheTiger is behind a proxy....
2009-05-14T04:06:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	proxy doesn't kick in when pinging an ip, unless there's also a firewall
2009-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	sometimes the only way to access the internet at some places is through the proxy... everything else might be blocked...
2009-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	true... but that's abusing a proxy then ;)
2009-05-14T04:10:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	that might be a very bad case of murphy :p
2009-05-14T04:31:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	MHz128 you can copy the contents of an iso to disk and boot from that
2009-05-14T04:43:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	removing gnome-panel seems harmless....
2009-05-14T04:44:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	why?
2009-05-14T04:44:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	imagine this real-life example: something fails with your session, and your hope is on alt+F2.... not available without gnome-panel
2009-05-14T04:45:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	:D
2009-05-14T04:46:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	Ctrl+Alt+F1, login, install gnome-panel, restart X :)
2009-05-14T04:46:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	that didn't work at that time for some reason
2009-05-14T05:11:00.000Z	Kalmi	blizzkid	yeah... but it seems that he can't do it :)
2009-05-14T05:11:00.000Z	blizzkid	Kalmi	the question there is can't he, or can't his router ;)
