2007-07-24T14:52:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	your user password should work
2007-07-24T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	what is the output of this command: groups
2007-07-24T14:56:00.000Z	KeVi1	jrib	kevin adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
2007-07-24T14:57:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	what does this command return: sudo echo hi
2007-07-24T14:57:00.000Z	KeVi1	jrib	sudo suddenly started working o.O It returned hi
2007-07-24T14:58:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	ok, does your gksudo command from before work now?
2007-07-24T14:58:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	gksudo gedit /usr/share/apache2/default-site
2007-07-24T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	does the editor still open?
2007-07-24T15:01:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	what about:  gksudo 'gedit /usr/share/apache2/default-site'
2007-07-24T15:01:00.000Z	KeVi1	jrib	Same
2007-07-24T15:01:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	does /usr/share/apache2 exist?
2007-07-24T15:01:00.000Z	KeVi1	jrib	yes
2007-07-24T15:02:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	does this work:  sudo nano /usr/share/apache2/default-site
2007-07-24T15:02:00.000Z	KeVi1	jrib	Yes. It opened some odd window.
2007-07-24T15:03:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	you can use that to edit and then save with ctrl-o and exit with ctrl-x.  I'm not sure why your gksudo isn't working, but we can troubleshoot some more after you exit nano
2007-07-24T15:04:00.000Z	KeVi1	jrib	How do I make a new file with this?
2007-07-24T15:04:00.000Z	jrib	KeVi1	when you do    nano /new/file    it will create it
