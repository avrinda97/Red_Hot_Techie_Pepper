2010-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	statagem_bot	ActionParsnip	Is there a log for GDM somewhere that might tell me why I can't even login
2010-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	statagem_bot	set your password in root recovery console
2010-08-13T23:23:00.000Z	statagem_bot	ActionParsnip	my password is already set. I'm not sure I understand?
2010-08-13T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	statagem_bot	if you can't log in, you can reset the password so you know its good
2010-08-13T23:25:00.000Z	statagem_bot	ActionParsnip	I'm not getting an "authentication failure" message.  if I do type in the wrong passwrod. it'll tell me.

2010-08-13T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	statagem_bot	I've seen people mess with /tmp in recovery root, but unsure of specifics
2010-08-13T23:26:00.000Z	statagem_bot	ActionParsnip	I did do a "passwd (name)" in console though and it didn't help
