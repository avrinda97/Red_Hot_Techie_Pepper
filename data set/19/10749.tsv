2008-01-03T21:05:00.000Z	coldboot		So let's say I have this: "tcp       45      0 nhooey-xeon.ne.ende:nfs 172.30.62.57:51494      CLOSE_WAIT"
2008-01-03T21:05:00.000Z	coldboot		How do I get rid of it with sysctl?
2008-01-03T21:05:00.000Z	coldboot		Probably because they're shitty and broken, as they always have been, and the acceleration never turns on.
2008-01-03T21:06:00.000Z	coldboot		Is there seriously anyone else in here but men from the ages of 16 to 50?
2008-01-03T21:06:00.000Z	coldboot		I don't see why the channel has to be "family friendly" in the puritan sense.
2008-01-03T21:07:00.000Z	coldboot		Swearing makes the language colourful.
2008-01-03T21:07:00.000Z	coldboot		It's hard to describe ATI's Linux drivers without saying bad words.
2008-01-03T21:09:00.000Z	coldboot		So anyone know how to knock out a CLOSE_WAIT connection with sysctl?
2008-01-03T21:11:00.000Z	v3ctor	coldboot	yes it is
2008-01-03T21:12:00.000Z	v3ctor	coldboot	is the NFS share still showing as mounted on the client?
2008-01-03T21:13:00.000Z	coldboot	v3ctor	Nope, "mount" shows nothing to do with nfs on the client machine: "inspiron"
2008-01-03T21:14:00.000Z	v3ctor	coldboot	is the close_wait showing on the client or the server?
2008-01-03T21:14:00.000Z	coldboot	v3ctor	Several on the server, all the old IP addresses of inspiron each time it connected to the network.
2008-01-03T21:15:00.000Z	coldboot	v3ctor	But this is probably not the problem, I killed a process on the server, and now I time out when mounting NFS.
2008-01-03T21:15:00.000Z	v3ctor	coldboot	restart the process that you killed
2008-01-03T21:15:00.000Z	coldboot	v3ctor	Do you know how to restart NFS completely, 'cause /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart, and restarting nfs-common, both do nothing to help.
2008-01-03T21:15:00.000Z	coldboot	v3ctor	I don't remember which process it was.
2008-01-03T21:21:00.000Z	v3ctor	coldboot	did you kill that process for a reason?
2008-01-03T21:22:00.000Z	coldboot	v3ctor	I thought it would help get rid of the stale connection, it was obviously a mistake.
