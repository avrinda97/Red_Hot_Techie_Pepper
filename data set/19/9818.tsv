2006-12-30T17:48:00.000Z	HighLife		Can anyone tell me how to enable multi-core support on mencoder
2006-12-30T17:48:00.000Z	HighLife		?
2006-12-30T17:49:00.000Z	HighLife		Hey I am just getting into this linux thing :P
2006-12-30T17:49:00.000Z	HighLife		lol
2006-12-30T17:51:00.000Z	HighLife		I know it's possible there must be someone here who knows how to make mencoder use both cores?
2006-12-30T17:51:00.000Z	HighLife		It would make Highlife very happy :)

2006-12-30T06:04:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	I don't think it does because of timing problems
2006-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	mpeg is definitely SMP enabled, but you'll have to grep the ffmpeg changelog yourself
2006-12-30T06:08:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	hehe, np's - http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/changelog.html
2006-12-30T06:08:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	search that for 'smp' and the things you're trying to transcode from/to - ffmpeg's my transcoder of choice, at least
2006-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/documentation.html is pretty good, lots of examples on the net though
2006-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	if you're trying to use H264, I recommend building your own libx264 and ffmpeg from SVN
2006-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	the x264 and ffmpeg that ship with Ubuntu has been crippled for copyright reasons
2006-12-30T06:12:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	two secs, there should be packages for it out there on the net..
2006-12-30T06:12:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	googling because I haven't got them installed here yet either ^^
2006-12-30T06:14:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	I'm not having much luck finding anything, I used to have a script to do it - i'm knee deep in Ruby on Rails atm, if I get a chance I'll put it together again this weekend
2006-12-30T06:15:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	keep poking me in here ^^
2006-12-30T06:15:00.000Z	JosefK	HighLife	I'll stick it on my FTP when it's done
