2004-12-18T11:03:00.000Z	trans_err		I went through the faq's on the wiki (and tried a manual install) and I can't get the java plugin to load
2004-12-18T11:03:00.000Z	trans_err		it simply won't load on my installed copy of firefox 1.0 and I get errors when I start .9
2004-12-18T11:04:00.000Z	trans_err		No such file or directory/home/lib/i386/libjavaplugin_nscp.so:
2004-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	trans_err		can someone help me figure this out- i've never had a problem before
2004-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	trans_err		that's what I figured
2004-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	trans_err		but I can't find it
2004-12-18T11:06:00.000Z	trans_err		what is the default firefox plugins path?
2004-12-18T11:07:00.000Z	trans_err		I installed the jre .bin, copied the contents to /usr/lib... added the bin to my PATH and copied the plugin to /usr/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
2004-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	trans_err		this is driving me insane-- does anyone have a solution to this? this isn't supposed ot be difficult
2004-12-18T11:11:00.000Z	davmor2	trans_err	what is the problem
2004-12-18T11:11:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	I can't get the java plugin to load
2004-12-18T11:14:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	how did you install? I can't get firefox to load the plugin
2004-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	how so?
2004-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	davmor2	trans_err	when you go on a java enabled page a bar across the top of the browser opens saying there is a plugin available click on it
2004-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	davmor2	trans_err	no idea now mate sorry you can install the source quite easily though just follow the mozilla folder til you find firefox then follow firefox till you get to the plugins folder make a note of the path.  ./java.....   it asks you for the install path type it in away you go
2004-12-18T11:25:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	what?
2004-12-18T11:25:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	install the source?
2004-12-18T11:26:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	no
2004-12-18T11:26:00.000Z	trans_err	davmor2	I have a symlink is /usr/local/bin
