2008-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	tim		can someone help me mount a working usb (fat) hard drive?
2008-10-02T05:35:00.000Z	tim		ya ya, mounts like a sd, except it doesn't.
2008-10-02T05:35:00.000Z	jrib	tim	you need to be a lot more specific
2008-10-02T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	tim	don't know.  I don't see anything on the wiki about usb not working on an eeepc. Do other usb devices work?
2008-10-02T05:47:00.000Z	tim	jrib	yes
2008-10-02T05:47:00.000Z	tim	jrib	and it works on the eeepc not on the normal computer
2008-10-02T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	tim	check 'dmesg' right after plugging in your usb key
2008-10-02T05:50:00.000Z	tim	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/53030/
2008-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	jrib	tim	pastebin 'sudo fdisk -l'
2008-10-02T05:56:00.000Z	tim	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/53033/ shows only internal drives
2008-10-02T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	tim	what size is the usb key?
2008-10-02T06:00:00.000Z	tim	jrib	60gb
2008-10-02T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	tim	google your last line in dmesg (I'm googling as well, but don't see anything interesting yet)
2008-10-02T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	tim	what version of ubuntu?
2008-10-02T06:04:00.000Z	tim	jrib	kubuntu 8.10
2008-10-02T06:04:00.000Z	tim	jrib	last line: device not accepting address 6, error -110
2008-10-02T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	tim	8.10 is a *development* version intended for developers and testers.  You need to ask in #ubuntu+1, not here
2008-10-02T06:05:00.000Z	tim	jrib	7.10 then I use hardy
2009-02-14T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	tim	avoid alien
