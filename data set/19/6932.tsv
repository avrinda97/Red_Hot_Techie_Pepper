2007-11-08T06:07:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	hehe. yeah. except im not getting that far.. iwconfig doesnt show the wireless connection
2007-11-08T06:07:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	you've told ndiswrapper to load the windows drivers in?
2007-11-08T06:08:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	yeah, i tried bcmw5l first, and got some errors in dmesg.. but i tried bcmw5la, and got it loaded smoothly, but still no eth1
2007-11-08T06:08:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	it won't be ethX, it will probably be wlan
2007-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	did you monitor the tail end of dmesg as you loaded the driver? it should probably tell you what the name will be
2007-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	i changed the setting on that, but still, no wlan riyjrt
2007-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	 it doesnt mention another connection other than eth0 (my wired connection)
2007-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	does `ifconfig -a` mention anything other than eth0 and local?
2007-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	sit0, whatever that is
2007-11-08T06:11:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	is that listed as being a wireless device under iwcondig?
2007-11-08T06:11:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	yes, but so is lo and eth0
2007-11-08T06:12:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	lo an deth0 should say "not a wireless device" or such though
2007-11-08T06:12:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	no wireless extensions ?
2007-11-08T06:12:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	yea... does it say that under sid0 too?
2007-11-08T06:12:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	yes
2007-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	im thinking about just buying a mini-pci card that is known to work easily for linux/ubuntu
2007-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	but im gonna try Wireless Assistant before i totally give up
2007-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	rxKaffee	Hatabax	tried native bcm drivers?
2007-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	Hatabax	rxKaffee	i think so, but not sure. I know it didnt work " out of the box" and ive heard that the native drivers just plain dont work
