2006-07-01T10:52:00.000Z	ScottNailon		hey guys, I have an old 800 MHz PC here with Win ME, can you guys tell me a way of installing UBUNTU on it? it seems not to load from the normal CROM . . :(
2006-07-01T10:52:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	ScottNailon	is your BIOS configured to boot from a CD?
2006-07-01T10:53:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- yeah of course, I am booting to the cd, and trying to load the OS from CDROM install but it just doesnt load up....
2006-07-01T10:53:00.000Z	ScottNailon		xftp
2006-07-01T10:54:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- any other ideas ?
2006-07-01T10:54:00.000Z	ScottNailon		I just wanna kill WINME and install Linux.... :(
2006-07-01T10:55:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	ScottNailon	"just doesn't work" doesn't help, what happens exactly?
2006-07-01T10:56:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- it just goes to load up Xwindows to boot but doesnt get far past that screen.... I am running a Maxrox Millenium Video card, dont know if thats a prob...
2006-07-01T10:57:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- It seems to halt and load forever on Xwindows
2006-07-01T10:57:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	ScottNailon	so it IS installed, but X isn't working
2006-07-01T10:57:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- no it is booting from CDROM to the CDROM version but wont boot INTO X at all :(
2006-07-01T10:58:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	ScottNailon	so you're using the live cd?
2006-07-01T10:58:00.000Z	ScottNailon		yes yes yes
2006-07-01T10:58:00.000Z	ScottNailon		correct. sorry I forgot to say that!
2006-07-01T10:59:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- is there a way I can just start an install from Windows which will FORCE itself onto this pc? and can you install it onto a FAT32 partition?
2006-07-01T11:00:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	ScottNailon	iirc the live CD doesn't install. you need an install CD. you can probably install to a fat32 partition, but it'll be ugly
2006-07-01T11:01:00.000Z	ScottNailon	hawkaloogie	- what do you mean by ugly? and why wont the LIVE cd work?
2006-07-01T11:02:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	ScottNailon	ugly as in the opposite of pretty, and i don't know.
