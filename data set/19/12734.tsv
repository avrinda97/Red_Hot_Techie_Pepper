2005-09-03T09:25:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	you mean dualbooting?
2005-09-03T09:25:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	waht probs are you hacing?
2005-09-03T09:26:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	it will install GRUb for you later ... have you set up partitions already?
2005-09-03T09:30:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	i leave the bootflag as default .. i'll let apokryphos tell you what it means ( i don't know myself)
2005-09-03T09:32:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	yes, that's still the partitioning stage iirc.....it will ask you to install the bootloader later ... just choose the default option and you should be fine
2005-09-03T09:51:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	choose the default option ( i think it is 'yes')
2005-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	install go ok?
2005-09-03T10:26:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	i suppose you mean a GUI app?
2005-09-03T10:26:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	did the install go ok?
2005-09-03T10:29:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	most of us use a console-based editor and gcc/g++
2005-09-03T10:29:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	google for IDEs and then install one you like via synaptic
2005-09-03T10:31:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	there is none
2005-09-03T10:32:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	the readme doesn't say that!
2005-09-03T10:34:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	Instructions for use:
2005-09-03T10:34:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	why are you reading the code? :)
2005-09-03T10:34:00.000Z	brenner	Tobsn	just read the instructions in the box!
