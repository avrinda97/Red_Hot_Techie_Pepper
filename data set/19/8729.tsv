2007-02-18T10:05:00.000Z	AlexC_	emet	I run Beryl on an ATI X800xt
2007-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	emet	AlexC_	what driver package do you use ?
2007-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	AlexC_	emet	fglrx
2007-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	AlexC_	emet	fglrx and XGL, works fine...though I'd rather be running AIGLX with nVidia :P
2007-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	emet	AlexC_	yah but I can't even do XGL cause I have NO 3d acceleration for some reason
2007-02-18T10:08:00.000Z	AlexC_	emet	have you followed the guide on the Beryl Wiki? I've had this a few times, I don't know what caues it - I usualy give up and reinstall Ubuntu lol
2007-02-18T10:08:00.000Z	emet	AlexC_	it might be driver regression .. I have the newest versions of the fglrx driver and they are broke, but the older ones used to work fine
2007-02-18T10:10:00.000Z	emet	AlexC_	how long you think before ATI add support for AIGLX extensions ?
2007-02-18T10:10:00.000Z	AlexC_	emet	haha yeah, like Seveas said
