2007-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	desertc		why did you pick today to make me fight with my video drivers... sigh
2007-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	desertc		why why why why is it necessary to update the kernel every few weeks, when so often the proprietary graphic card users get screwed?
2007-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	if you use the drivers from the repos, you wouldn't get screwed
2007-09-26T09:07:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	fact of the matter is that most people are not yet ready to use the drivers from the repo.  and losing your graphic configuration is a DISASTER
2007-09-26T09:07:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	not yet ready??
2007-09-26T09:07:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	the drivers from the repos are far easier to install...
2007-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	regardless - the people using the restricted drivers are getting screwed, just because the ubuntu team wants to update the kernel every couple weeks
2007-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	no, people using the restricted drivers are fine. People using drivers from nvidia.com have the problem
2007-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	I never installed drivers from nvidia.com
2007-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	the kernel needs to be updated for security reasons
2007-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	where did you install the drivers from?
2007-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	restricted drivers manager
2007-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	then you shouldn't have a problem at all... hmm
2007-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	this is the fourth time I have had a problem with a kernel update
2007-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	getting to the point I am going to disable updates
2007-10-18T21:22:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	don't install the drivers from their site
2007-10-18T21:22:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	use the ones in the reops
2007-10-18T21:22:00.000Z	desertc	mc44	The ones in the repos cause me problems every time I update the kernel
2007-10-18T21:23:00.000Z	mc44	desertc	the ones from nvidia will break X every time you update the kernel
