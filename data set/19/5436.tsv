2008-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	Frogging101		I am trying to make my ubuntu partiton bigger, using space from another partition. I can shrink the other partition no problem, but the ubuntu partiton is locked because it is mounted. When I try to unmount it there is an error message saying that it couldnt unmount the partition because there may be other partitions mounted on the same mountpoint. There are no other mounted partitions. I am using Gparted.\

2008-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	you need to do that from the live cd
2008-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	you can't re-size a partition while it is in use, it's in use because your using ubuntu
2008-11-13T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	sounds like a router issue
2008-11-13T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	sorry, not you
2011-12-04T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	what are you talking about
2011-12-04T23:39:00.000Z	Frogging101	ikonia	The new software centre in Ubuntu 10.10, some software has prices now. Most of it is free, but I still think it's a step in the wrong direction to make it easy to charge money for linux software
2011-12-04T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	give 1 example
2011-12-04T23:40:00.000Z	Frogging101	ikonia	Open the Ubuntu software centre. And look in the "What's new" section. You'll notice that many of the programs have a price tag
2011-12-04T23:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	no, I'm asking you to give me an example of free software that has a price next to it in ubuntu software center
2011-12-04T23:41:00.000Z	Frogging101	ikonia	Any free software says "Free" next to it. That's fine, but the fact that it specifies that is saying that there is software that isn't free.
2011-12-04T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	please give one example
2011-12-04T23:41:00.000Z	Frogging101	ikonia	Gparted
2011-12-04T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	so you are saying it's charging money for gparted ?
2011-12-04T23:42:00.000Z	Frogging101	ikonia	No. My point is basically, that the new software centre is a step in the wrong direction because they now host paid software
2011-12-04T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	so ?
2011-12-04T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	some solutions cost money
2011-12-04T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Frogging101	it's up to you if you want to use it
