2007-10-20T11:22:00.000Z	todkon		hmm, I just finished installing Gusty, and my sound doesn't work...
2007-10-20T11:22:00.000Z	todkon		I have an Audigy sound card
2007-10-20T11:23:00.000Z	ActySofts	todkon	my sound doesn't work too, I got 2 sound cards
2007-10-20T11:24:00.000Z	todkon	ActySofts	did you make sure your onboard sound is off?
2007-10-20T11:24:00.000Z	ActySofts	todkon	what do you mean?
2007-10-20T11:24:00.000Z	todkon	ActySofts	one of your soundcards is on the motherboard, right?
2007-10-20T11:25:00.000Z	ActySofts	todkon	yes, though it worked before turning it off to go to bed, and I restarted it a couple of times
2007-10-20T11:25:00.000Z	todkon	ActySofts	ahh, hmm, well, make sure its disabled in your Bios :P
2007-10-20T11:26:00.000Z	todkon	ActySofts	neither of your soundcards work either though?
2007-10-20T11:26:00.000Z	todkon		not even on board?
2007-10-20T11:27:00.000Z	ActySofts	todkon	yep, and there's no option like that in my bios (I can't make anything out of italian though), but they both work on windoze and they did work before
2007-10-20T11:28:00.000Z	ActySofts	todkon	I'm using xubuntu btw, but I guess it doesn't really matter, the core is the same
2007-10-20T11:29:00.000Z	todkon	ActySofts	ahh, yeah, both same core
