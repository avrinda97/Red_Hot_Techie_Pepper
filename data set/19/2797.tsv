2010-05-07T03:27:00.000Z	JoshDreamland		all right, being here hasn't helped me for the last three days
2010-05-07T03:27:00.000Z	JoshDreamland		chances are it won't help me today
2010-05-07T03:27:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	whats the problem
2010-05-07T03:32:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	Have you tried using LiveCD and booting in that way. You could triboot and it may fix the problem
2010-05-07T03:32:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	LinuxPhreak	LIveCD fails to load with a different error message
2010-05-07T03:33:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	that sounds like it is corrupted. Did you do an integrety check and check the md5
2010-05-07T03:34:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	LinuxPhreak	Integrity check skips itself when I request it
2010-05-07T03:36:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	explain? But if I understand you correctly you will just need to do md5sum name-of-iso.iso
2010-05-07T03:37:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	that will work with any ISO on most linux systems
2010-05-07T03:40:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	Always burn on cheap disk and at lowest write speeds
2010-05-07T03:44:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	not sure never tried. But I don't see why not. You could try download an integrity check tool that will check disk before booting it
2010-05-07T03:46:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	LinuxPhreak	Know of any I can apt-get?
2010-05-07T03:47:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	not off my head. Open up synaptic and search for integrity check
2010-05-07T04:24:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	LinuxPhreak	The disk has the correct hash as well. I'm not sure why the integrity check causes the OS to try to boot, nor why the OS fails to boot.
2010-05-07T04:25:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	just a wild idea you may want to try sbm
2010-05-07T04:26:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	LinuxPhreak	What is that?
2010-05-07T04:26:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	Smart Boot Manager
2010-05-07T04:26:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	JoshDreamland	are you using ubuntu-desktop or alternative
2010-05-07T04:30:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	LinuxPhreak	Ubuntu-desktop-10-4-i386, or something
