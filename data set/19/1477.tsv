2011-01-12T02:39:00.000Z	zaery		JackSteam, which games in particular?
2011-01-12T02:40:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	TF2 is the main one. But WoW would be another that i'd like
2011-01-12T02:45:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	the part with the command for terminal. i get an error, when i checked the error it seems i need to 'mount' the windows drive. but i don't know how
2011-01-12T02:48:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	no i don't
2011-01-12T02:49:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	come again? not sure what you mean
2011-01-12T02:51:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	yes
2011-01-12T02:52:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	yes
2011-01-12T02:56:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	not there isn't
2011-01-12T02:58:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	yes
2011-01-12T02:59:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	erm, i'm not sure which is the ntfs partition
2011-01-12T03:00:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	yes. it says 'unmount' so i'm guessing it is mounted?
2011-01-12T03:01:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	under volumes?
2011-01-12T03:02:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	might be worth mentioning i did install ubuntu via wubi. incase that helps
2011-01-12T03:04:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	it said mounted at /host so i clicked it and now i can see all my windows things, could i just drag and drop that into the virtual C drive that wine made?
2011-01-12T03:12:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	did all that. it says its launching but the nothing happens.
2011-01-12T03:13:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	steam works just fine but the games just don't want to load
2011-01-12T03:17:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	i right click steam select TF2 it shows TF is starting then friends list shows as in-game not a second later it shows im not? very confusing
2011-01-12T03:28:00.000Z	JackSTEAM	zaery	thankyou ever so much, its working now. any problems i'll be sure to ask :)
