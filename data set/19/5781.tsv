2008-06-12T03:06:00.000Z	DIL		why would i not be able to login as root from login window - i am receiving " the system admin is not allowed to login from this screen"
2008-06-12T03:07:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	use sudo command instead
2008-06-12T03:07:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	no, it wasn't, unless you actually went as far as to give your root user a password
2008-06-12T03:09:00.000Z	DIL	_adriaan	i did, and now the case is the same but getting -admin cant login from login screen
2008-06-12T03:09:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	well, then I'd guess 8.04 reverted to the default ubuntu state (being: your root user does not have a password, you have to use sudo instead)

2008-06-12T03:11:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	I can't remember how to give your root user a pass, but as you apparently did so before, it shouldn't be hard to do it again
2008-06-12T03:11:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	although I have always been said it is discouraged
2008-06-12T03:11:00.000Z	DIL	_adriaan	ty i understand
2008-06-12T03:16:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	okay, fine:

2008-06-12T03:16:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	don't tell me I didn't stress it's a bad idea
2008-06-12T03:17:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	ofcourse, replace the kde bits with gnome and kdm with gdm
2008-06-12T03:17:00.000Z	DIL	_adriaan	wisdom is always loved by all who receive it
2008-06-12T03:18:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	eh.. okay... I guess :) - anyway, I'm off now
2008-06-12T03:20:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	okay, lookep it up again for gnome, just enter the command "gksu gdmsetup"
2008-06-12T03:21:00.000Z	DIL	_adriaan	just wanted to know what was happening - i dont like modifying files
2008-06-12T03:22:00.000Z	_adriaan	DIL	Well, it's none of my business, and you may well be way more advanced at it than me, but I don't trust any user, including myself, with it. That said, what I gave you should be enough, so good luck with it :)
