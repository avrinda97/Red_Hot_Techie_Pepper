2011-10-10T02:19:00.000Z	djresree		In fact, I was using the Linux box to print to the printer on another machine just fine, but wanted to move my stuff to ubuntu to consolidate it as my server for everything.. seems my plan has backfired
2011-10-10T02:21:00.000Z	djresree		On top of it, one of the Linux help docs for Ubuntu says about using Windows to be the print server "why would you want this  ?"  And that made me even more mad because I say "BECAUSE AT LEAST SHARING A PRINTER ON WINDOWS WORKS!"
2011-10-10T02:22:00.000Z	fullmetal	djresree	it is frustrating however please avoid going into an all caps rage...
2011-10-10T02:24:00.000Z	fullmetal	djresree	for the priter share do you allow all clients? guest access may be needed if your win boxes are not authenticating...
2011-10-10T02:25:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	 I have it shared for any and all clients
2011-10-10T02:28:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	 it says "Allow printing for everyone except these users:"  and there is no one in that list
2011-10-10T02:29:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	 ipp://192.168.2.108:631/printers/Deskjet4135  is the addy of the printer
2011-10-10T02:29:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	 hp:/usb/Deskjet_F4100_series?serial=CN7BK4S5TQ0542   is the other addy I have
2011-10-10T02:31:00.000Z	fullmetal	djresree	try doing a \\servername on your windows box and see if you can see the printers...
2011-10-10T02:32:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	 I assume you mean replace servername with the IP of my linux box?
2011-10-10T02:33:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	  The network path was not found
2011-10-10T02:34:00.000Z	fullmetal	djresree	can you ping the ip of the linux server?
2011-10-10T02:35:00.000Z	djresree	fullmetal	 how do I ping the server?  from Windows run or ubuntu?
