2008-02-08T02:28:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		well, i've read something about beryl
2008-02-08T02:28:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		and when i tried to install it
2008-02-08T02:28:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		i couldn't
2008-02-08T02:28:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		well, first tried the 3ddesktop application ubuntu have
2008-02-08T02:29:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		and it asked me for some hardware acceleration configuration
2008-02-08T02:29:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		is an nvidia
2008-02-08T02:29:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		i don't remember the model
2008-02-08T02:30:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		no
2008-02-08T02:30:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		i don't see the restrictive drivers menu
2008-02-08T02:32:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		well... in the about section it says "unbuntu 6.06 LTS - the drapper drake realeased in june 2006"
2008-02-08T02:34:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	i would try 7.10
2008-02-08T02:36:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	7.10 doesn't work with your monitor? How so?
2008-02-08T02:38:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	I would go back to 7.10 becuase it is more updated. Then install the restricted drivers. Then work with your monitor... I believe the command is nvidiaconfig
2008-02-08T02:39:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	I too had issues with my LCD monitor setup until I used nvidaconfig
2008-02-08T02:40:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	I'm using 1650 x 1280? can't remember I'm not home righ now
2008-02-08T02:41:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	You will need the restricted drivers in order for beryl to work, but I think it comes pre-installed already.
2008-02-08T02:41:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	A hot key would be SpecialWindowsKey + e
2008-02-08T02:42:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	Good luck
2008-02-08T02:42:00.000Z	ewanchic	Hechicera1973	And God Bles
