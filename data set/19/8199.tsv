2007-04-26T16:31:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Are you trying to install fglrx or the open source drivers?
2007-04-26T16:33:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Are you trying to install fglrx or the open source drivers?
2007-04-26T16:33:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Which one?
2007-04-26T16:34:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Which of these two are you trying to install, fglrx (ATi's Closed Source driver) or the open source ATi drivers?
2007-04-26T16:37:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	You can try this method, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2007-04-26T16:39:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Yes, that is how I installed my fglrx drivers for my ATi X1950XTX and it works just fine.
2007-04-26T16:39:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Yes, with XGL
2007-04-26T16:40:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	I used this guys installation method to get XGL + Beryl working: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=399913
2007-04-26T16:41:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	If your card supports Dual-Link DVI, the install method I gave you for fglrx, will work on any monitor up to a resolution size of 2560x1600
2007-04-26T16:41:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	With no problems at all.
2007-04-26T05:43:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	I would have not seen your message as it didn't highlight your name, next time to grab my attention type trumpeter2003 (tru<tab>)
2007-04-26T05:43:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Are you starting Gnome with XGL from your login manager?
2007-04-26T05:44:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	As such, did you create all the scripts that were requested? And even more so, did you chmod a+x them?
2007-04-26T05:45:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	That means that the Window Manager isn't loading
2007-04-26T05:46:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Which resorts to the scripts not being created correctly or without the correct permissions
2007-04-26T05:46:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Go back through and check that you did all the steps in the guide and didn't skip over any of them
2007-04-26T05:47:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	Shouldn't
2007-04-26T05:47:00.000Z	trumpeter2003	razzorz	And all the permissions on the scripts are a+x
