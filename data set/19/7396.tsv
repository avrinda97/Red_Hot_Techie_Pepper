2007-08-30T06:14:00.000Z	Rorshach		got a sound question. I have a sound blaster card, and while I get sound, I have to turn my speakers all the way up, is there a way to amplify it?
2007-08-30T06:15:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	run alsa-mixer to adjust the volume settings
2007-08-30T06:16:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	okay, anything else I should check while I'm at it?
2007-08-30T06:17:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	I hope that should be it
2007-08-30T06:18:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	the correct command is alsamixer
2007-08-30T06:20:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	you can also add a Volume Control setting to the preferences menu, just right-click on System, and the panel edit menu
2007-08-30T06:21:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	okay, I turned up all the sliders, but to no effect. I know the sound card works, but I'm just curious if it's only a windows card.
2007-08-30T06:22:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	it's a standard soundblaster live?
2007-08-30T06:23:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	no, SB Audigy Gamer.
2007-08-30T06:25:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	I'm currently checking the alsa site to find out more about the issue.
2007-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	when you ran alsamixer did you adjust the Wave slider? There are more sliders visible if you resize the window.
2007-08-30T06:30:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	I'm not seeing a wave slider either in GUI or terminal.
2007-08-30T06:30:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	if you resize the window of alsamixer in terminal, there is no wave slider visible?
2007-08-30T06:31:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	That is correct, what is shown however is a Master, Bass, treble, PCM, etc.
2007-08-30T06:32:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	That's not so good :(
2007-08-30T06:33:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	lol I had figured as much.
2007-08-30T06:39:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	I found this at launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/107540
2007-08-30T06:42:00.000Z	Rorshach	CaptainFrisbee	wow, who'd a thunk? that certainly helped. aparently the sound had been rerouted to my digital output.
2007-08-30T06:42:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	Rorshach	glad that it's fixed :)
