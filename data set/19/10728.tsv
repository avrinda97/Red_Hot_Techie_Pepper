2011-01-16T22:13:00.000Z	needlez		anyone experenced working with bash scripts?? need help finishing one for making totem autoclose and then for the computer to go into sleep mode
2011-01-16T22:13:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	just add "sudo halt" to the end of your script.
2011-01-16T22:13:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	and that will force sleep mode??
2011-01-16T22:14:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	that will shut it down, if you specifically want sleep, you are going to have to see if there are acpi commands available to you that will work with your hardware.
2011-01-16T22:15:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	yes i want sleep not shutdown, and thank you i forgot about the acpi commands...dur...lol
2011-01-20T11:36:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	are the acpi tools/libraries not enough?
2011-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	that was a shell script, not a C program.
2011-01-20T11:40:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	im trying to write a script that tells totem to close after so long but then after close for it to put the computer to sleep ... only the issue is that it requires root priveleges for suspend commands and for shutdown commands, so I had someone help me make a c wrapper that does the same thing as shutdown and added it to me as users. any ideas??
2011-01-20T11:40:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	you could have sudo not require a password for those commands from your username.
2011-01-20T11:41:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	I don't want to remove my password because while this is my laptop that posses a security risk
2011-01-20T11:42:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	you don't remove the password, you just don't require a password for sudo to shutdown or suspend the computer.
2011-01-20T11:43:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	for instance, this in your sudoers: "needlez ALL=NOPASSWD: /path/to/your/script"
2011-01-20T11:43:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	ok so I can make it so pm-suspend no longer requires sudo?? or a password to run?? please explain
2011-01-20T11:44:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	did that yesterday and broke sudoers
2011-01-20T11:44:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	or: needlez ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend
2011-01-20T11:44:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	is there a way to change permissions of pm-suspend with chown or something like that??
2011-01-20T11:45:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	yes... but that is really not a good idea.  making the one commnad usable by your user with no password is a better option.
2011-01-20T11:46:00.000Z	needlez	greppy	 I was just going to change pm-suspend so it doesnt require root to run so then I can run it as normal from script
2011-01-20T11:46:00.000Z	greppy	needlez	it needs root to run
