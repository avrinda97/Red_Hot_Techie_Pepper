2007-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	ashu		in pastebin and give me the link
2007-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	ashu		C++
2007-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	std is the namespace
2007-09-20T12:36:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	Anjuta, Eclipse, KDevelop are 3 that I have tried
2007-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	#include <cstdio> int main(void) { printf("Hello, World!"); return; }
2007-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	sorry i meant c++
2007-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	#include <iostream> int main(void) { std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl; return; }
2007-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	it looks similar to turbo c++, but what's that std:: thing?
2007-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	alternatively, i could have just put a "using namespace std;" at the top, but i advise myself against that
2007-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	will this code work both on anjuta and eclipse?
2007-09-20T12:43:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	should.
2007-09-20T12:53:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	i know there's thousands of guides on that
2007-09-20T12:53:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	which one is better?
2007-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	they have different features; i tend to enjoy beryl more
2007-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	i had installed beryl once before and it just kept crashing
2007-09-20T12:55:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	compiz ian't listed in add / remove programs; and i don't know how to install those .tar.gz stuff from it's website
2007-09-20T12:55:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	tar -xvf [file] .tar.gz
2007-09-20T13:10:00.000Z	ashu	Codemaster	in anjuta, after compiling how do i run the program?
2007-09-20T13:10:00.000Z	Codemaster	ashu	not sure, to be honest; I haven't used Anjuta in a while
