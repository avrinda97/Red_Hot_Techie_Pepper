2007-03-16T15:18:00.000Z	hejsa		When i installed apache2 from the repositories it had no httpd.conf file, how do i get this quite important file :D ?
2007-03-16T15:19:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	you don't.  Apache2 doesn't use httpd.conf, it uses a comglomeration of other config files, which allow for a ton of modulability and flexibility
2007-03-16T15:20:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	Damn, then i have no idea why my apache isn't working
2007-03-16T15:20:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	what's it doing?
2007-03-16T15:22:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	First i thought php just didn't work, but then i found out that apache1.3 was the one being used... and then i tried to remove it and now i got no webserver answering on port 80...
2007-03-16T15:22:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	And the apache2 server doesn't seems to start
2007-03-16T15:23:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	are you sure apache(1) isn't still running?
2007-03-16T15:23:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	what error does Apache2 give you?
2007-03-16T15:24:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	apache2: Syntax error on line 189 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf: No such file or directory
2007-03-16T15:24:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	Alright.  Sounds like you've got config file issues then.  Why don't you go ahead and pastebin your apache2.conf
2007-03-16T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	oh, and pastebin httpd.conf as well
2007-03-16T15:25:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	As i said i have no httpd.conf
2007-03-16T15:26:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	Eh?  Did you delete it?  You should have one, even if it's entirely comments.
2007-03-16T15:26:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	you're on dapper or edgy?
2007-03-16T15:27:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	:S feisty, so i'm not relaying on this apache server to work, but it still would be nice to be able to use it
2007-03-16T15:28:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	Oh.  Feisty.  Well, it's entirely possible that feisty's apache is broken currently.  You might ask in #ubuntu+1.
2007-03-16T15:28:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	anyway, do this: purge apache2-common, reinstall it.  Then pastebin your apache2.conf (and reaffirm that httpd.conf doesn't exists)
2007-03-17T16:02:00.000Z	hejsa	Flannel	Apache problem again... Apache2 is running and working now, but php isn't working. php is installed and a2enmod php5 says it's enabled and /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf got the right file indexes... and i have restarted the apache2 server a couple of times... also when apache2 isn't running i got no other webservers answering... what could the problem be ?
2007-03-17T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	hejsa	you may want to try asking in #apache.  But I'll keep trying
