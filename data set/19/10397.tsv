2006-11-29T15:35:00.000Z	efox		how can i disable my internal wireless card ?
2006-11-29T15:35:00.000Z	efox		i want to add a pcmia one but the internal one is 'gettin in the way'
2006-11-29T15:35:00.000Z	abes	efox	start from the BIOS
2006-11-29T15:36:00.000Z	efox	abes	its dual booted with windows, i want it to work in windows, just not with linux ( i have a separate card for that)
2006-11-29T15:39:00.000Z	abes	efox	how about just going to System -> Administration -> Network Tools and deactivating the onboard one?
2006-11-29T16:03:00.000Z	efox	abes	sorry bout the delay, i tried doing that but its not listed there. It is under device manager though and I know its partialy working because when i perform "iwlist" it tells me of a few availables networks
2006-11-29T16:03:00.000Z	abes	efox	how about ifconfig ath0 (or whatever it's called) down
2006-11-29T16:04:00.000Z	efox	abes	ive gone through all of them, at least what i know, wlan0, ath0...eth0 is the only one left
2006-11-29T16:04:00.000Z	abes	efox	do u have the PCMCIA plugged in now?
2006-11-29T16:05:00.000Z	abes	efox	because looks like wlan0 and ath0 are two different cards
2006-11-29T16:06:00.000Z	efox	abes	im such a nooob. I think it was the pcmia. When i popped it out, and tried iwconfig, it said no card found...when i popped it back in..it found the essid
2006-11-29T16:06:00.000Z	efox	abes	dapper...or drapper..whatever its called
2006-11-29T16:07:00.000Z	abes	efox	so when u have no pcmcia only eth0 is visible?
2006-11-29T16:08:00.000Z	efox	abes	if  i go to network tools, only eth0 shows up
2006-11-29T16:09:00.000Z	abes	efox	good... therefore the onboard is disabled
2006-11-29T16:11:00.000Z	abes	efox	but is the pcmcia plugged in now?
2006-11-29T16:11:00.000Z	efox	abes	yes
2006-11-29T16:12:00.000Z	abes	efox	so try unplugging the pcmcia and run "ifconfig -a"
2006-11-29T16:12:00.000Z	efox	abes	wlan0 goes away, the rest remain
