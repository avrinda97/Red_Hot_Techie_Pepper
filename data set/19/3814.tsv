2009-05-22T20:56:00.000Z	Jugger		Hello everyone, I just installed Ubuntu and only problem i am having is i cant get nVidia X Server to recognize im using a LCD monitor not a CRT monitor.
2009-05-22T20:58:00.000Z	Jugger		Anyone happen to know if there is any bugs the prevent my nVidia 8800GT from noticing my LCD screen?
2009-05-22T21:00:00.000Z	flintwingel	Jugger	I have an nVidia 8800 and have had no problems - what is the output of xrandr
2009-05-22T21:02:00.000Z	Jugger	flintwingel	I honestly dont know what that means, but i cant get X Server to notice im using a LCD monitor it says im using a CRT.
2009-05-22T21:03:00.000Z	flintwingel	Jugger	Menu->Preferences->Display... does it show you your monitor correctly?
2009-05-22T21:04:00.000Z	Jugger	flintwingel	No that just says Unknown.
2009-05-22T21:05:00.000Z	flintwingel	Jugger	are you using the nvidia or open source drivers?
2009-05-22T21:05:00.000Z	Jugger	flintwingel	nVidia 180 driver
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	flintwingel	Jugger	do you have a Nvidia settings entry in either the Preferences or System ?
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	Jugger	flintwingel	Yes NVIDIA X Server Settings
2009-05-22T21:08:00.000Z	Jugger		It only shows CRT Monitor and i cant chane it.
2009-05-22T21:08:00.000Z	Jugger		change even

2009-05-22T21:12:00.000Z	flintwingel	Jugger	all I can suggest is you run through the xserver initialisation again -  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

2009-05-22T21:38:00.000Z	Jugger		Alright so in Unistalled the NVIDIA Drivers and Reinstalled them and im still at the same problem i cant change my display off CRT to my LCD.
