2009-07-30T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	spO	this one
2009-07-30T02:16:00.000Z	jrib	spO	did you read the link ubottu gave you?  You should use sudo instead.  If you want a gui, install one :)
2009-07-30T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	spO	you can do it, it's just not necessary
2009-07-30T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	spO	no, only people with sudo privileges.  By default any user in the "admin" group can.  Only the first user created is a member of the "admin" group by default
2009-07-30T02:19:00.000Z	jrib	spO	just install the package for the window manager you want.  It should pull in anything you need
2009-07-30T02:21:00.000Z	jrib	spO	why did you install the server edition?
2009-07-30T02:22:00.000Z	spO	jrib	becasue this is a server box
2009-07-30T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	spO	then why do you need a gui :)  Just install ubuntu-desktop if you want all of the stuff that's on the regular ubuntu
2009-07-30T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	spO	no.
2009-07-30T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	spO	I already told you two ways to do it, you aren't listening
2009-07-30T02:24:00.000Z	spO	jrib	you told me to install desktop version instead of server edition
2009-07-30T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	spO	no, I didn't
2009-07-30T02:24:00.000Z	spO	jrib	but i want it to be a mixture of the two
2009-07-30T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	spO	ubuntu-desktop is a package you install
2009-07-30T02:35:00.000Z	jrib	spO	help.ubuntu.com
2009-08-06T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	spO	no...
