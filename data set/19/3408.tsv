2010-09-05T06:45:00.000Z	BrianE		When I close my laptop lid for more than about 5 minutes, the laptop conks out. Not a standard shutdown, the laptop actually just powers off, like you'd expect if it had no battery and the power was cut. It's not a hardware issue as I can't replicate it under other OSs; has anyone got any ideas / suggestions?
2010-09-05T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	Is it suspending to disk?
2010-09-05T06:47:00.000Z	BrianE	edbian	No, it wouldn't have time to suspend to disk if it's just dying instantly, and the system doesn't 'wake' when it's turned on in any case =\
2010-09-05T06:48:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	You said it takes 5 minutes?
2010-09-05T06:48:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	Also, suspend to hdd appears to be off completely (no power is being consumed).  It checks for a suspend to disk image every time it turns on.  If it finds one it boots.  Many laptops are set to "hibernate" when the laptop lid is shut.
2010-09-05T06:49:00.000Z	BrianE	edbian	It isn't a gradual process, the laptop is fine and normal if I open the lid before then - the 5 minutes is rough, as I've never actually timed it specifically
2010-09-05T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	So there is some cutoff point at which it suddenly shuts down as if the plug was suddenly pulled.
2010-09-05T06:50:00.000Z	BrianE	edbian	Yes
2010-09-05T06:51:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	That's a very strange problem.  I'm not sure! :P
2010-09-05T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	power management is actually a well known rats nest of problems.  When MS introduced the idea hardware manufacturers started implementing it in their systems.  Some cheaper ones started making buggy / crappy ones that worked any way because windows would alter their OS just to allow these hardware to work correctly.  Now for Linux, it's impossible to get it to work well for many machines because they're all different.
2010-09-05T06:54:00.000Z	BrianE	edbian	Is ACPI not standardised?
2010-09-05T06:54:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	It is but very poorly.  And like I said, many people simply don't follow it and Microsoft makes room for them.
2010-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	BrianE	edbian	The root of all evil, again!
2010-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	Ha ha.  Tell me about it.  Linus HATE acpi
2010-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	BrianE	edbian	Do you know him personally? :P
2010-09-05T06:57:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	No.  I wish.  I know from quotations from code comments and such.
2010-09-05T06:58:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds   there is one on their about acpi
2010-09-05T07:19:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	yep!  But we're off topic :(
2010-09-05T07:19:00.000Z	edbian	BrianE	we can talk about this in ubuntu-offtopic
