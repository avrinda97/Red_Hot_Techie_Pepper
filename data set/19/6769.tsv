2007-12-09T16:20:00.000Z	velko	egs_	is your model listed here? http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html
2007-12-09T16:07:00.000Z	egs_	velko	having trouble with a logitech webcam here. how did you load gspca? every time i plug in, uvcvideo gets loaded.
2007-12-09T16:08:00.000Z	velko	egs_	i either use the precompiled gscpa modules for my current kernel or the gspca sources (and compile them against the kernel with module-assistent)
2007-12-09T16:09:00.000Z	egs_	velko	i have gspca compiled and installed. but when I plug the cam in, it loads uvcvideo instead
2007-12-09T16:09:00.000Z	velko	egs_	strange. on my machine uvcvideo is not loaded at all
2007-12-09T16:10:00.000Z	velko	egs_	gscpa uses videodev, v4l2_common and v4l1_compat
2007-12-09T16:11:00.000Z	egs_	velko	which logitech cam do you have ? mine is a logitech quickcam notebook pro.
2007-12-09T16:12:00.000Z	velko	egs_	did you tried to blacklist uvcvideo in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.local?
2007-12-09T16:12:00.000Z	egs_	velko	didn't know about that, let me try it...
2007-12-09T16:13:00.000Z	velko	egs_	the format is "blacklist uvcvideo". by the way i have blacklisted "snd_usb_audio"
2007-12-09T16:14:00.000Z	velko	egs_	my model is some sort of quickcam also. but can't remember which exactly
2007-12-09T16:15:00.000Z	egs_	velko	lsusb says "046d:08c3" for mine, what's yours? (trying blacklisting now)
2007-12-09T16:17:00.000Z	velko	egs_	either 046d:08ad or  046d:c046 (i have webcam and mouse from logitech and cannot tell which is which because lsusb shows both of them as "Logitech, Inc.")
2007-12-09T16:19:00.000Z	egs_	velko	thanks, gspca isn't working for me -- no device.
2007-12-09T16:22:00.000Z	egs_	velko	Yes, bridge is spca525a, driver is linux-UVC. Does that mean I should be using uvcvideo?
2007-12-09T16:22:00.000Z	velko	egs_	it looks like that, yes
2007-12-09T16:23:00.000Z	egs_	velko	ok, thanks, i'll re-try uvcvideo, which did work better than GSPCA in that it at least created a device for me.
2007-12-09T16:35:00.000Z	egs_	velko	giving up on this webcam, will just buy a new one.
2007-12-09T16:36:00.000Z	velko	egs_	sorry to hear this. it's listed as supported...
