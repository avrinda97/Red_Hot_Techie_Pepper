2010-11-01T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	yes :)
2010-11-01T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	you need to mark the file as executable then run it in a terminal using sudo
2010-11-01T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	ok then the installer will run
2010-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	bydanknot1	ActionParsnip	sudo chmod ??
2010-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	no need for sudo for the chmod, the file is owned by you so its not needed
2010-11-01T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	you only need sudo if the file is not owned by you
2010-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	then try using sudo as you say
2010-11-01T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	use sudo to launch the installer
2010-11-01T12:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	sounds good
2010-11-01T12:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bydanknot1	as long as you have space, it doesn't matter that much
