2010-12-30T13:28:00.000Z	chandrageetha		hi andycc, i didnÂ´t insta unrar package, how to?
2010-12-30T13:29:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	you should already have the unrar package i believe by default...
2010-12-30T13:29:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	sudo apt-get install unrar
2010-12-30T13:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	what's the problem with it then?
2010-12-30T13:33:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	so if you try to open, lets say the Music folder under "Places", it gives you that error message?
2010-12-30T13:37:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	open a terminal and type:    nautilus ~/Music
2010-12-30T13:37:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	does that open your Music folder?
2010-12-30T13:39:00.000Z	chandrageetha	Us3r_Unfriendly	tell me how to correct it?
2010-12-30T13:40:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	the "gnome-panel" is the panel on the top where you access your nautilus and the directories on your machine
2010-12-30T13:46:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	run the command under "sudo"
2010-12-30T14:11:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	make sure to include your new user to the "Admin" group...that way you can use "sudo" in the new account
2010-12-30T14:11:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	do you know how to?
2010-12-30T14:12:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	that works
2010-12-30T14:13:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	then reboot and then if you need to run "sudo", then you can
2010-12-30T14:13:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	to add yourself to the admin group?
2010-12-30T14:14:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	or you could use the combination of cli commands for "group"
2010-12-30T14:15:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	i just did
2010-12-30T14:15:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	?
2010-12-30T14:17:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	chandrageetha	well my way won't work for you because you need to use sudo in order to use the command...you could use       su -c "nano /etc/group"       but you would have to know your root password (not your user password)
