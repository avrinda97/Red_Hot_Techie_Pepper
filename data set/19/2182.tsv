2011-07-20T11:14:00.000Z	flametai1		I had a wireless keyboard previously and it all of a sudden out of the blue stopped working with Ubuntu 10.10, but if I pressed the FN key on it it would just continuously  type iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii over and over. Until I pressed a button and then it would stop. Thinking the keyboard was the problem I bought a new one, which is a corded USB keyboard. It worked for about 2 months and now this one is working fine except it
2011-07-20T11:14:00.000Z	flametai1		presses iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii over and over now randomly.
2011-07-20T11:14:00.000Z	flametai1		Anyone know my god damn problem?
2011-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	flametai1		About ready to throw Ubuntu out the window as much as I like it =/ It's just becoming a pain in the ass now though.
2011-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	MrDudle	flametai1	swearing won't help you
2011-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	MrDudle	flametai1	Did that only happen in a certain program?
2011-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	flametai1	MrDudle	swearing makes me feel better considering I've asked this question in here AND #linux a thousand times and no one seems to know what's going on =|
2011-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	MrDudle		Or in all programs that allow text input?
2011-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	MrDudle		Well, flametai1, people here do have lives.
2011-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	flametai1	MrDudle	anything, even the OS itself.
2011-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	MrDudle		I'm not even sure what that means.
2011-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	MrDudle		How do you know it would produce 'i' if it wasn't in a program or something?
2011-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	flametai1		.........selects a file/folder that has i in it
2011-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	flametai1		searches for files with "i"
2011-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	flametai1		etc.
2011-07-20T11:20:00.000Z	MrDudle	flametai1	Honestly sounds like a keyboard problem.
2011-07-20T11:20:00.000Z	flametai1	MrDudle	the keyboard is brand friking new.
2011-07-20T11:20:00.000Z	MrDudle		This is why I don't like wireless things.
2011-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	flametai1	MrDudle	the one pressing i randomly isn't wireless. My previous one is wireless and presses i when I press FN
