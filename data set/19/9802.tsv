2006-10-23T16:28:00.000Z	Lam_		how does kde handle hidden folders?  gnome does it by a dot prefix
2006-10-23T16:28:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	Linux in general uses the convention of hiding files that being with a dot.
2006-10-23T16:30:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	you're using Edgy, correct?
2006-10-23T16:31:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	then join #ubuntu+1. anyway, either Edgy or KDE 3.5.5 (not sure which one is responsible) has made most folders hidden by default in dialogs and file browsers. in dialogs, you can right click and choose to view all files - in konqueror i'm not sure
2006-10-23T16:48:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	sudo apt-get install smartmontools
2006-10-23T16:48:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	thanks
2006-11-17T15:47:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	"ps aux" lists, "kill" kills
2006-11-17T15:48:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	thanks
2006-11-30T12:42:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	i'm not exactly looking to fix tags, since i can do that in amarok. i'm looking to rename files using the tags
2006-11-30T12:42:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	"apt-cache show easytag" <- check a package's description before assuming it doesn't do something ;-)
2006-11-30T12:43:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	specifically, "Ability to rename files from the tag (using masks) or by loading a text file"
2006-11-30T12:43:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	ah ok then. thanks.  i'll consider my options
2006-12-04T14:45:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	find | xargs md5sum
2006-12-04T14:46:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	or something ;)
2006-12-04T14:46:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	lamego: thanks :)
2006-12-04T14:47:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	lamego's sounds much better. my xargs command would have required a -print0 option to find, and also an -n 1 (or somethign) option to xargs
2009-03-20T02:17:00.000Z	LjL	Lam_	(gtk)
2009-03-20T02:18:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	Thanks
2009-03-20T02:22:00.000Z	Lam_	LjL	 Exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks a lot.
