2008-05-03T23:31:00.000Z	Paragtim		Hi guys - How do I get a GUI in 8.04 - I'm at initramfs
2008-05-03T23:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	lol
2008-05-03T23:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	is your system booting at all? other than that message?
2008-05-03T23:33:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	yep - thinks so - If i type help get a list of commands
2008-05-03T23:34:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	what do you have installed on your system?
2008-05-03T23:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-05-03T23:37:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	msg ---- sudo: not found
2008-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	- Got a "safe mode" list on boot how do I get rid of the extra operating systems?
2008-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	you want to get rid of "safe mode"?
2008-05-03T23:54:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	No I've got into the GUI but the "Safe Mode" screen shows 2 x dev and 2 x recovery and 4 x other operating systems.  I think I kcuf'ed yp the install and have multiple partitions now !!
2008-05-03T23:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	I don't follow.  Are you talking about the grub menu?
2008-05-03T23:56:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	- yes - O think so - Pressed esc on boot
2008-05-03T23:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	so, are you getting into ubuntu, ie gnome?
2008-05-03T23:58:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	Yes I have now but if I re-boot it goes back to the original screen prompt
2008-05-03T23:58:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	you should always get the grub menu when ever you boot
2008-05-03T23:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	if you have no important data, and you think you messed up the install, then you should start over with a clean install, and do it right.  Its easier than trying to fix problems after the fact
2008-05-04T00:00:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	- OK - but unless I press esc it just loads to the screen prompt.  If I press esc and select the 4th option (recovery) it will load into the Gui.
2008-05-04T00:00:00.000Z	danbhfive	Paragtim	like I said, maybe you should try installing again
2008-05-04T00:01:00.000Z	Paragtim	danbhfive	- I think you might be right - Thanks for your time and patience
