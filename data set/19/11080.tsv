2006-10-25T08:46:00.000Z	tarzeau		anyone going to http://nightshift.untergrund.net/ ?
2006-10-25T05:39:00.000Z	tarzeau		does ubuntu have something like www.debian.org/devel/people ?
2006-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	Adriano	tarzeau	since ubuntu upstream for most packages is Debian, I'd add most of those people to the list
2006-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	no
2006-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	Adriano		no?
2006-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	i want the statistics of only ubuntu: http://io.debian.net/~tar/bugstats/?gurkan
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	without the debian stuff.
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	only official ubuntu developers, and official ubuntu packages
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	no universe, no multi-verse
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	Adriano		well, that sounds self-defeating
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	no, it's just that i don't look for other numbers but the ones i look for
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	Adriano		you ask for the list of devs "without this bit here"
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	no, you don't understand me
2006-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	and you are misinterpreting me too
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	Adriano		I don't think your numbers will make much sense, is what I'm saying
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	i don't care, you don't know what i want to do with the numbers
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	you are only assuming i want to compare them, but your addumption is wrong
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	Adriano		of course not
2006-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	Adriano	i think my question was clear enough, i don't want to discuss about other things
