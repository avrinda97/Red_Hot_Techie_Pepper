2005-02-07T09:50:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	getting rid of em?
2005-02-07T09:51:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	wasnt <em> about getting rid of <i> and <b> ?  :)
2005-02-07T09:51:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	yes apparently there's some talk of ditching <em> tags because they're not semantic enough for xhtml
2005-02-07T09:52:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	nobody is going to take that one seriously (hopefully)
2005-02-07T09:53:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	hopefully ....
2005-02-07T09:53:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	<em>'s semantic are pretty well defined i thing
2005-02-07T09:53:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	they don't involve italics...
2005-02-07T09:55:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	what do you mean they don't involve italics? Italics is the standard formatting for <em> tagged text. Try it in any browser in unstyled html file.
2005-02-07T10:01:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	emphasizing with italics is typographic _convention_ in traditional non-fiction text, not _standard_.
2005-02-07T10:01:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	not limited to non-fiction. And most stuff in text is convention. So what?
2005-02-07T10:02:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	"so what" that it's not _standard_ of any kind and emphasizing depends on context
2005-02-07T10:03:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	the fact that context when using text varys only a little is clear but has nothing to do with _standards_.
2005-02-07T10:06:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	I'm not sure what you're getting at. I agree that the conventions about how emphasis is indicated in text are less firm than certain other textual conventions. Indeed, how emphasis is indicated in text is one of the areas where writing becomes not just verbal but visual (like those poems which are carefully arranged in a shape on the page). This is one of the complications about reducing all documents to a simplified semantic structure. (Wh
2005-02-07T10:08:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	exactly, people just want to type a letter and be done with it
2005-02-07T10:09:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	mmm... we are having a discussion where participants move at totally different levels, ...or at least i wasnt talking about "having a letter done"
2005-02-07T10:10:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	TTilus	That's fine :)
2005-02-07T10:10:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	at that level, yes, theres very little point in trying to separate context-dependat conventions and standards and current state and the target processess we are aiming at...
2005-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	TTilus	TreadingSoftly	thats an argument when talking about a portion of individuals, gotta remember that it's not the whole world, bigger circles, bigger problems and bigger hammers to "get the job done" U C
