2010-10-11T18:25:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	it's indicator-applet
2010-10-11T18:26:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	It seems that this isn't a command I can run... and shouldn't indicator-applet be displaying a menu from some extra process?
2010-10-11T18:27:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	in fact the indicator-applet app contains several apps, the executable seems to be at/usr/lib/indicator-applet/indicator-applet
2010-10-11T18:28:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	or maybe this one will be the one you're interested in : /usr/lib/indicator-sound/indicator-sound-service
2010-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	It does seem to be what I'm looking for, but it crashes on execution
2010-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	david_christians		I'll look onward
2010-10-11T18:30:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	thanks!
2010-10-11T18:30:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	you're welcome
2010-10-11T18:31:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	might help you, here's a list of the indicator processes running on my computer : http://paste.ubuntu.com/510894/
2010-10-11T18:34:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	seems as though it might be a gnome-shell issue, with gnome-shell not supporting the ubuntu indicator system
2010-10-11T18:35:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	now i know
2010-10-11T18:37:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	I think this is your problem : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-shell/+bug/572599
2010-10-11T18:40:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	indeed it was
2010-10-11T18:41:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	did you get the applet to work with the suggested solution ?
2010-10-11T18:41:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	yes, I ran gnome-volume-control-applet and it gave me a little volume indicator
2010-10-11T18:42:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	no fancy sound menu but that's fine :)
2010-10-11T18:42:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	nice :)
2010-10-11T18:43:00.000Z	david_christians	glebihan	again thanks!
2010-10-11T18:43:00.000Z	glebihan	david_christians	you're welcome
