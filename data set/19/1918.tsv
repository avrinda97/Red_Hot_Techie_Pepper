2010-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	van7hu		What is difference between building a packet and install a packet
2010-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	van7hu		?
2010-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	you mean "package"?
2011-03-20T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	why?
2011-03-20T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	yes, but why do you care if there's a variable?  Are you asking how to change your time zone?
2011-03-20T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime describes how to set the timezone.  I don't have any TZ variable set in my environment but maybe applications will respect that if you set it
2011-06-10T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	yes
2011-06-10T18:20:00.000Z	van7hu	jrib	bazhang, thans
2011-06-10T18:20:00.000Z	van7hu	jrib	bazhang, thanks
2011-09-27T14:22:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	works fine here
2011-09-27T14:23:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	what did you type exactly?
2011-09-27T14:23:00.000Z	van7hu	jrib	'newgrp - adm'
2011-09-27T14:24:00.000Z	van7hu	jrib	'newgrp adm' works well
2011-09-27T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	it's something in your shell's startup files
2011-09-27T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	what you just said suggests you should check ~/.profile first
2011-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	van7hu	jrib	oh, out of my knowledge
2011-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	hmm?
2011-09-27T14:26:00.000Z	van7hu	jrib	then, what to look up?
2011-09-27T14:27:00.000Z	jrib	van7hu	read ~/.profile.  If nothing there uses 'expr', then I'd move on to other relevant files.  If you can't find the culprit, rename these files one at a time until the issue goes away.  Then investigate further
