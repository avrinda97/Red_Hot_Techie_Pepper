2012-05-09T23:17:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149		Hi #Ubuntu, does anyone have any experience making a Lenovo U300s "Clickpad" work properly under 12.04?
2012-05-09T23:18:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149		or can send me in the right direction?
2012-05-09T23:19:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149		Yes, I think that's the proper name of a trackpad that is also a button
2012-05-09T23:19:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149		how do I find the correct driver for it?
2012-05-09T23:19:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Touchpad driver on the fabricant website
2012-05-09T23:21:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	install System Profiler and Brenchmark, on the Software Center application. There you may find the name of all the components of your lappy
2012-05-09T23:22:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Once you have the name of the touchpad, paste it on Google for driver. You may find something
2012-05-09T23:24:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Driver must be Linux based, favour the .deb package. I couldn't guide you through another way.
2012-05-09T23:28:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Yes, it's possible to find it in Lenovo's Website, searching for the model of your lappy
2012-05-09T23:28:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Even for Linux.
2012-05-09T23:40:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149	FfoO	I've seen that post before, it's a fix for one thing but not for all the problems the trackpad has
2012-05-09T23:41:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149	FfoO	This driver is useless to me on linux, right? http://i.imgur.com/uTE0i.png
2012-05-09T23:42:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	I'm afraid so
2012-05-09T23:54:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	please try on terminal: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics.
2012-05-09T23:55:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	if it shall not work, type this same 'xserver-xorg...' in synaptiks package mannager
2012-05-09T23:56:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Gotta go afk now. Good luck, dude.
2012-05-09T23:58:00.000Z	OfficeITGuy149	FfoO	left me with something that looks rightâ€¦ can someone tell me what xserver-xorg-input-synaptics is?
2012-05-09T23:59:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	you're probably installing the packet which makes the touchpad work fine
2012-05-10T00:01:00.000Z	FfoO	OfficeITGuy149	Let's hope so. I have the same version of touchpad myself, here, and it works properly
