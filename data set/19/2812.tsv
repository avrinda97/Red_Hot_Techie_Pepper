2010-03-13T15:47:00.000Z	underdev		hi- i unnstalled something, and my ubuntu has been.. quirky.. ever since.  Ubuntu is now not detecting external usb storage media.  It detects my USB wireless nic fine, but neither my HD or my mp3 player.
2010-03-13T15:47:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	using an usb hub?
2010-03-13T15:47:00.000Z	underdev	acicula	no, the ports on the Motherboard
2010-03-13T15:48:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	there is some hal addon storage process that takes care of mounting usb drives, but forgot what its called exactly
2010-03-13T15:54:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	does the device show via lsusb
2010-03-13T15:56:00.000Z	underdev	acicula	there is a Bus 002 Device 002: "microsoft..."  <-- this may very well be my external HD
2010-03-13T15:56:00.000Z	underdev	acicula	its probably ntfs

2010-03-13T15:59:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	in dmesg it will tell you what drives are assigned
2010-03-13T16:00:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	hubs are not disks though
2010-03-13T16:00:00.000Z	underdev	acicula	ty, i will dig through the dmesg info
2010-03-13T16:01:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	if you unplug and replug the device the last few dmesg lines will hold what you are looking for

2010-03-13T16:09:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	you probably killed off the automounter somehow or the system cant mount the fs on the mp3 player?
2010-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	underdev	acicula	it could read the fs on the mp3 player before.  I am quite confident its something in the automounter chain that's fubared... is there anything i can do about it?
2010-03-13T16:27:00.000Z	acicula	underdev	gnome-volume & gnome-volume-manager, reinstall and reconfigure those?
2010-03-13T16:27:00.000Z	underdev	acicula	ty, worth a shot
