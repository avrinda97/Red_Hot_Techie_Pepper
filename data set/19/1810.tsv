2010-11-27T15:38:00.000Z	sara2010	void_pointer	 so what to do now ? u can not help me !
2010-11-27T15:39:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	I did. Open a console window and type "sudo add default gw xxx.xxx.xxx" where "xxx.xxx.xxx" is the IP of your gateway
2010-11-27T15:46:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	I told you
2010-11-27T15:48:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	open a terminal window. Type "sudo route add default gw xxx.xxx.xxx" where xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP of your gateway
2010-11-27T15:48:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	then type "sudo route"
2010-11-27T15:49:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	yes, if 10.1.1.1 is your gateway
2010-11-27T15:54:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	then "sudo route add default gw 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0"
2010-11-27T15:56:00.000Z	sara2010	void_pointer	 .. there is error came  no such device
2010-11-27T15:56:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	well now we are getting somewhere
2010-11-27T15:57:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	are you sure you typed the command exactly as i wrote it?
2010-11-27T15:57:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	including the "gw"?
2010-11-27T15:58:00.000Z	sara2010	void_pointer	 i m  sure ...  but before i  type without netmast
2010-11-27T15:59:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	well, you can exclude the netmask
2010-11-27T15:59:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	or try a netmask of "255.255.0.0"
2010-11-27T16:03:00.000Z	sara2010	void_pointer	... its same no such device
2010-11-27T16:05:00.000Z	void_pointer	sara2010	well, first, are you sure that's the IP of your gateway?
2010-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	sara2010	void_pointer	.. yes i m sure ..  my server gateway ip is 10.1.1.1
