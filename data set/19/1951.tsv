2010-08-20T05:58:00.000Z	sammarks14		hi, i have a question about my ubuntu installation
2010-08-20T06:00:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	the ask applies to you too
2010-08-20T06:01:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	have you tried updating and restarting?
2010-08-20T06:01:00.000Z	sammarks14	smw	i can't because it freezes before i can get my wireless adapter working
2010-08-20T06:01:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	can you find a way to plug it in?
2010-08-20T06:02:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	I can walk you through text mode if you have internet
2010-08-20T06:03:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	phrag is having issues with wubi. I don't see the connection :-\.
2010-08-20T06:04:00.000Z	sammarks14	smw	do you think the 32 bit version would make a difference?
2010-08-20T06:04:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	32bit would not help X problems
2010-08-20T06:05:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	yes
2010-08-20T06:05:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	ubuntu does not have X config files
2010-08-20T06:05:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	I believe you can put them in if you want :-)
2010-08-20T06:06:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	I really think updating would help
2010-08-20T06:06:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	but I have never done it
2010-08-20T06:07:00.000Z	sammarks14	smw	in text mode, it ran fine.
2010-08-20T06:07:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	I am explaining it to phragg
2010-08-20T06:09:00.000Z	sammarks14	smw	okay, i will do as you suggested and report if that worked or not
2010-08-20T06:10:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	thanks :-)
2010-08-20T06:10:00.000Z	smw	sammarks14	or you can use babyeater's idea
