2009-04-06T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	then use update-rc.d, the man page is somewhat cryptic, but you should be able to figure it out
2009-04-06T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	there's /etc/init.d/skeleton if you really want to go that route and avoid using /etc/rc.local
2009-04-06T17:16:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	thank you for that - i have been using update-rc.d - but can't figure out how to just have the script execute on run level 3
2009-04-06T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	you know runlevel 2 is default and 2-5 are identical by default?
2009-04-06T17:17:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	basically i just want to fire a script off when the server boots....
2009-04-06T17:17:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	 not on all run levels
2009-04-06T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	erm, ok.  Then create an init.d script for it first
2009-04-06T17:18:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	yeah i have my script ready
2009-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	(and it has many examples)
2009-04-06T17:26:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	yeah the man page is cryptic...
2009-04-06T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	scroll down to examples
2009-04-06T17:27:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	for some reason - i dont example on my man page
2009-04-06T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	did you find the examples section at the bottom?
2009-04-06T17:28:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	yeah i did. good jobs. what run level is boot on ubuntu?
2009-04-06T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	2
2009-04-06T17:28:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	ta
2009-04-06T17:41:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	not 3?
2009-04-06T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	zealiod	try « runlevel »
2009-04-06T17:43:00.000Z	zealiod	jrib	interesting, yeah - good good.
