2006-09-17T13:47:00.000Z	omar		lets try
2006-09-17T13:48:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	chances are it's not 'mozilla' alone, it's 'mozilla-suite' or something
2006-09-17T13:50:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	which version you using? breezy? dapper?
2006-09-17T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	alright, give me a sec
2006-09-17T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	also, you can delete old kernels, if you didn't know.  they're taking up space
2006-09-17T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	ah, mozilla is the meta package, but you'll need to remove the components as well
2006-09-17T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	you can use adept, to remove them all.
2006-09-17T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	and, search for 'linux-image' and remove the older ones (lower versions) but don't delete your newest one!
2006-09-17T13:55:00.000Z	Flannel	omar	'mozilla' installs 'mozilla-browser' 'mozilla-mailnews' and 'mozilla-psm', remove those
2006-09-25T08:48:00.000Z	omar	Flannel	yes please, tell Omar about it
