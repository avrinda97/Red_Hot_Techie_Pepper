2008-08-28T17:46:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	their download link for ubuntu is bad...
2008-08-28T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	no it's not.  It points you to packages.ubuntu.com, which is the same as what you get through APT already.  Why do you not want to use the version in the repositories?
2008-08-28T17:48:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	becuase I wam on a windows machine, attempting to work with a ps3 that has no data access
2008-08-28T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	packages.ubuntu.com is timing out right now, but it will come back.  Copy the deb
2008-08-28T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	packages.ubuntu.com is timing out right now, but it will come back.  If you don't want to wait, copy the deb directly from a repository
2008-08-28T17:50:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	I just want to get a file that works for once, so I'll wait. Ihave been trying for DAYS to get wifi working on PS3 Xubuntu (following various tutorials etc) all of which are broken in some way...
2008-08-28T17:51:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	wifi is working, well, people have it working, but for some unkown reason, it wasnt (^$@($@ implemented and now the way to do it is broken in the repo
2008-08-28T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	what do you mean by "broken in the repo"?
2008-08-28T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	the link on the wifi radar page for ubuntu is exactly the repo version
2008-08-28T17:52:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	the repo's for the method of getting wifi to work on a PS3 in Xubuntu are broken.
2008-08-28T17:53:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	referring to this article here...most others refer to similar steps... Also, the files mentioned lack certain important things like /lib/firmware in deb 2.6.24...
2008-08-28T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	so is the fix in svn?
2008-08-28T17:54:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	so someone mentioned wifi radar 'might' help..through some incredibly small chance...may somehow make it work...so I am trying it, even though it just seems like a way to manage an already functioning wifi setup
2008-08-28T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	have you found a bug at bugs.ubuntu.com?  That's probably the best source of info and usually has comments with workarounds if they exist
2008-08-28T17:56:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	are you a bot?
2008-08-28T17:56:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	no PS3 experience with Ubuntu, I take it?
2008-08-28T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	right
2008-08-28T17:58:00.000Z	RakZer1	jrib	the user details using the intrd and kernel from here: http://cell.fixstars.com/ps3linux/download/cell-linux-addon-latest/CELL-Linux-CL_latest-ADDON/target/ , (lacking firmware for update intrafs step), and says you rpm2cpio it (however this never works, and ubuntu insists you use Alien instead, which I think is also a problem...)
2008-08-28T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	RakZer1	tried #ubuntu-ps3 by the way?
