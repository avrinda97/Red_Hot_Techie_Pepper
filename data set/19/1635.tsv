2010-11-19T03:57:00.000Z	Dazza71		hi anyone help with my printer issues
2010-11-19T03:59:00.000Z	Dazza71		guys can't get my web cam or printer to work ????
2010-11-19T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	what model is your printer
2010-11-19T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	brother has very poor linux support, along with cannon
2010-11-19T04:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	it may not be supported
2010-11-19T04:00:00.000Z	Dazza71	ikonia	so what do I do as I know both the web cam and printer work on windows
2010-11-19T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	works on windows means nothing, they need to be supported on ubuntu
2010-11-19T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	do you have the "driver" files
2010-11-19T04:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	have you read the install instructions ?
2010-11-19T04:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	as in the install instructions that tell you how to install them
2010-11-19T04:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	have you read the install instructions for the driver files ?
2010-11-19T04:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	because to know how to install them, you need to read the install instructions, that's why it matters
2010-11-19T04:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	I don't know, you need to find them, you said you got the linux drivers, where did you get the linux drivers
2010-11-19T04:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	as I've said, Brother has poor linux support, so it may not be supported at all
2010-11-19T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	find out if it's supported is the first step
2010-11-19T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	it may not be supported then
2010-11-19T04:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	no
2010-11-19T04:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	as I've just said "it may not be supported"
2010-11-19T04:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Dazza71	it means your installing a package for the wrong version (32bit/64bit) than your running
