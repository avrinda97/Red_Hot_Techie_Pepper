2012-07-19T20:31:00.000Z	Asar	bhavesh	great, though can't see it
2012-07-19T20:31:00.000Z	bhavesh	Asar	Cannot see what?
2012-07-19T20:33:00.000Z	bhavesh	Asar	try changing settings to 100Mbps full duplex/ 100MBps half duplex / 10Mbps full duplex then

2012-07-19T20:35:00.000Z	Asar	bhavesh	you're siting an internet site that is unreachable
2012-07-19T20:36:00.000Z	bhavesh	Asar	First you have to install ethtool with "sudo apt-get install ethtool net-tools" then check your speed/duplex settings with "ethtool eth0" and change the settings with "sudo ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 10 duplex half" changing the 10/half
2012-07-19T20:37:00.000Z	Asar	bhavesh	unable to fetch the archives
2012-07-19T20:40:00.000Z	bhavesh	Asar	use sudo if it doesn't allow
2012-07-19T20:41:00.000Z	bhavesh	Asar	I guess it just needs reconnecting the network
