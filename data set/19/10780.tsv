2008-03-20T15:32:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT		hey.. need some advice on a laptop purchase: are there any limitations as to CPUs not supported by kernel?
2008-03-20T15:33:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT		in an advert it clearly states that windows xp is not supported
2008-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT		CPU is a 2.40 GHz Intel C2 DUO T8300 800MHz 3MB
2008-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	sorry - any x86 or x86_64 is supported
2008-03-20T15:36:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	so linux kernel does not give a rats *ss about registers and internal structure of a CPU as long as its x86 or 64. why cant xp run with it?
2008-03-20T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	I don't know - ask microsoft
2008-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	nah they suck
2008-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	ok, so don't ask about it then
2008-03-20T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	so ask microsoft if XP is supported
2008-03-20T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	so ask that company - not ubuntu
2008-03-20T15:40:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	i know thats where i'll get the real answer, but I thought I would try asking here
2008-03-20T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	why ? it's nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-03-20T15:41:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	well... i had two questions... kernel in ubuntu support... and supplementary question: xp
2008-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	and stop being a troll :|
2008-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	I'm not trolling anyone.
2008-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	hehe ok
2008-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	CoOlGhOsT	may serve you well to check the topic
2008-03-20T15:44:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	i know i know.... i wont bother you with questions not 100% concerning ubuntu again then
2008-03-20T15:45:00.000Z	CoOlGhOsT	ikonia	thanks for helping about though even though the question was "off-topic"
