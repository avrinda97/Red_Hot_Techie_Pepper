2006-06-13T14:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	no, but if there was, more people would not have disasters :)
2006-06-13T14:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	it's probably involving some arcane use of find :/
2006-09-25T08:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	can you pastebin the errors?
2006-09-25T08:26:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	Ok
2006-09-25T08:29:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24742
2006-09-25T08:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	well, it looks like you broke your dapper
2006-09-25T08:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	you installed an edgy library
2006-09-25T08:31:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	How did I do that?
2006-09-25T08:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	watch the bot
2006-09-25T08:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	see the issue?
2006-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	Hmm...I don't remember adding edgy sources, that's the thing.
2006-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	did you do anything else nonstandard?
2006-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	Only thing is I have been working (unsuccessfully) with xgl/compiz...that's the only non-official sources I've added.
2006-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	yes, xgl tends to break systems, i have no idea why people use it
2006-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	Well, they use it cuz its pretty :) Any suggestions on what to do?
2006-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	maybe someone in #ubuntu-xgl can tell you how to get rid of it
2006-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	ajax4	eyequeue	Ok, thanks.
2006-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	eyequeue	ajax4	good luck
