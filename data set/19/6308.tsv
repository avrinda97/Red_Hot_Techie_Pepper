2010-02-21T05:44:00.000Z	samsonite		hey ppl
2010-02-21T05:44:00.000Z	samsonite		im having a weird issue with a thinkpad - the keyboard layout is all effed up
2010-02-21T05:45:00.000Z	samsonite		there are keys with numberpad type secondary buttons, and they are registering instead of the "real" key
2010-02-21T05:46:00.000Z	samsonite		like pressing 'M' actually does what 'Insert' does
2010-02-21T05:46:00.000Z	samsonite		any ideas
2010-02-21T05:46:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	is there a numlock key somewhere?
2010-02-21T05:46:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	yeah, I tried pressing it
2010-02-21T05:47:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	i have to press FN and then numlock tho
2010-02-21T05:47:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	or some other weird key.. like function-blabla to turn the numerical keyboard on or off
2010-02-21T05:47:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	its possible the FN key isnt registering i guess
2010-02-21T05:47:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	but it was like that from install as well
2010-02-21T05:49:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	I talked to someone else with the same problem the other day.. I think we even looked at some keyboard images of the thinkpad keyboard.. we didn't find a solution though
2010-02-21T05:49:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	yikes, that sucks
2010-02-21T05:50:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	yes.. indeed it does.. not really sure what might be the problem though.. hopefully it's just a setting somewhere
2010-02-21T05:51:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	ive tried like every layout :(
2010-02-21T05:52:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	you could try a live cd of lucid.. the next version.. see if it's the same there
2010-02-21T05:52:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	it's still beta though.. but it might be nice to know if it might be fixed in 2 months
2010-02-21T05:53:00.000Z	samsonite	Slart	the lack of a bug report seems to indicate that a fix is unlikely
2010-02-21T05:53:00.000Z	Slart	samsonite	nothing in the forums?
