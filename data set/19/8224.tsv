2008-01-24T06:53:00.000Z	biouser		http://ohioloco.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=49714 I have a lexmark z615 that GUTSY properly recognizes as a z600, should I use my old howto to install the printer driver?
2008-01-24T06:54:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- i found the old directions to still be true in the latest distro
2008-01-24T06:55:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- though converting the rpm to pkg worked easiest
2008-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	biouser	petriborg	then use dpkg?
2008-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	biouser	petriborg	do you have a more recent howto?
2008-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- yeah use dpkg -i
2008-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- let me see if i can find the one i used on my lexmark... 2 sec
2008-01-24T06:57:00.000Z	biouser	petriborg	that would be great... I think there has to be a couple of steps.. like alien or something (used to be)
2008-01-24T06:57:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- yeah you use alien to convert the rpm to a package and then you use dpkg -i to isntall them both, then start up the CUPS and setup your printer
2008-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- i did it a couple of weeks ago and it worked for me so you should be good to go
2008-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	biouser	petriborg	okay, sounds like the same as my old howto, I guess I'll go for it, thanks

2008-01-24T06:59:00.000Z	petriborg	biouser	- that link i think basically says that, and it should work
2008-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	biouser		what is up with #sudo apt-get install alien asking me to put a disk in?
2008-01-24T07:01:00.000Z	biouser		Media change: please insert the disc labeled
2008-01-24T07:01:00.000Z	biouser		 'Ubuntu 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release i386 (20071016)'
2008-01-24T07:01:00.000Z	biouser		in the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter
2008-01-24T07:01:00.000Z	biouser		sorry for the paste
