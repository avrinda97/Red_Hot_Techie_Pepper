2010-10-13T04:47:00.000Z	Ianr		I rebooted my machine today and now I can't resolve domain names.  I can ping ip's and connect to my wireless network.  Any ideas on where to look? I never had to set my name servers or anything like that before
2010-10-13T04:48:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	The name servers are set in /etc/resolv.conf
2010-10-13T04:49:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	file doesn't exist
2010-10-13T04:49:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	you don't have an /etc/resolv.conf   ?
2010-10-13T04:50:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	whats wierd is that I have a resolve.conf.tmp
2010-10-13T04:50:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	resolve.conf is empty
2010-10-13T04:50:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	Very odd.  Change it.  Drop the .tmp
2010-10-13T04:50:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	not resolve.conf, resolv.conf
2010-10-13T04:50:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	no 3
2010-10-13T04:50:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	no e*
2010-10-13T04:51:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	what I try to move/copy it says "Input/output error"
2010-10-13T04:52:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	Then you're doing it wrong?  sudo cp /etc/resolve.conf.tmp /etc/resolv.conf
2010-10-13T04:52:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	i'm already root
2010-10-13T04:52:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	then do that same command without sudo.  What error does it give?
2010-10-13T04:53:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	same error "Input/output error"
2010-10-13T04:53:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	maybe my USB is corrupt, this is live mode (persist)
2010-10-13T04:54:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	It sounds that way to me.
2010-10-13T04:55:00.000Z	Ianr	edbian	i can't even ls -l resolv.conf to read the permissions.  Is it possible network manager left it open or has it open?
2010-10-13T04:56:00.000Z	edbian	Ianr	That file doesn't get locked.  Additionally you can ls -l a locked file.  Something is wrong the the FS on the flash drive.
