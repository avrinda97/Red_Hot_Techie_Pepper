2005-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	anethema		what does it say batoms when you do
2005-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	anethema		ifconfig eth0 up
2005-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	but it brings it up
2005-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	this isn't a wireless card
2005-05-15T11:28:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	it works after that
2005-05-15T11:28:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	but this is my server so i need to it work on boot
2005-05-15T11:29:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	the problem is then i need to to a /etc/init.d/dhcpd restart and a /etc/init.d/ipmasq restart
2005-05-15T11:29:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	i was hoping for something cleaner thatn that
2005-05-15T11:32:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	ifconfig eth0 up doesn't say anything
2005-05-15T11:35:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	ifconfig eth0 down takes it down
2005-05-15T11:35:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	and ifconfig eth0 up brings it up without noise
2005-05-15T11:36:00.000Z	batoms	anethema	the problem is that it does'n't work on boot
