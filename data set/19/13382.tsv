2005-04-08T09:26:00.000Z	Lefungus		hello
2005-04-08T09:27:00.000Z	Lefungus		I'm very disapointed to see that ubuntu doesn't support musepack out-of-box :(
2005-04-08T09:28:00.000Z	Lefungus		it is an audio codec
2005-04-08T09:28:00.000Z	Lefungus		bsd license
2005-04-08T09:28:00.000Z	Lefungus		supported in gstreamer
2005-04-08T09:28:00.000Z	Lefungus		but disabled in ubuntu
2005-04-08T09:28:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	You can probably find that in Universe or Multiverse
2005-04-08T09:29:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	And "disabled" probably isn't the term
2005-04-08T09:29:00.000Z	Lefungus	pseudo	I don't think I should replace gstreamer by the version in universe
2005-04-08T09:30:00.000Z	Lefungus		and I mean 'disabled during compilation'
2005-04-08T09:31:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	Just remember, sometimes you have to change things, Ubuntu tries to make "alot" of people happy and in doing so doesn't make "everyone" happy. If you don't like changing a computer settings to fit you needs, use Windows ;) j/k Not trying to troll.
2005-04-08T09:32:00.000Z	Lefungus	pseudo	spare me the sarcasm
2005-04-08T09:33:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	Sound like you are the one with sarcasim this morning. It's just this is a place to get help, not complain about how you don't like something. If you are seriously unhappy with a desision, "seriously no sarcasim" file a bug report so it can be changed.
2005-04-08T09:36:00.000Z	Lefungus	pseudo	uninteresting discussion, topic closed. As always, it's DIY, and I will do it again
2005-04-08T09:36:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	I'm sorry If I came across crass. Just been getting a little annoyed at some people complaining about how linux doesn't do something with out having to tweak it. But isn't that the point? Some things need to be changed to fit ones needs, theres no possible way to fit everyones needs, and just because one distro did it doesn't mean that another is not as good.
2005-04-08T09:37:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	Good luck on it though. I have to go.
2005-04-08T09:37:00.000Z	Lefungus	pseudo	the little difference is that I coded many things to support musepack, including libmusepack
2005-04-08T09:37:00.000Z	Lefungus		and now i get preaching
2005-04-08T09:38:00.000Z	pseudo	Lefungus	Yeah, if needed. Just file a bug report, hopefully someone can tur it on by default for you in a nightly update :D.
