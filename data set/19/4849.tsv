2008-11-02T03:25:00.000Z	photon		how do I have to change permissions of a script so that they run as root? I tried chown root:root script.sh && chmod +s script.sh, but I still have to type in the admin password
2008-11-02T03:25:00.000Z	jrib	photon	you can't setuid scripts for security reasons.  Why would you want to do that?
2008-11-02T03:26:00.000Z	photon	jrib	because otherwise I have to type in the admin password *all the time*, which is kind of tedious. I'm using this script 20 times a day. is there no workaround?
2008-11-02T03:27:00.000Z	jrib	photon	set up sudoers so that you can use that command without sudo prompting you for a password
2008-11-02T03:27:00.000Z	photon	jrib	cliechti: thanks
2010-02-21T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	photon	kbdrate I guess
2010-02-21T17:48:00.000Z	photon	jrib	doesn't work, since those settings are encrypted at this stage.
2010-02-21T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	photon	kbdrate doesn't involve X.  You've tried it already?
2010-02-21T17:50:00.000Z	photon	jrib	yup, no effect. :(
2010-02-21T17:50:00.000Z	photon	jrib	thing is, the only unencrypted directory is /boot/, so it's gotta be saved there.
2010-02-21T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	photon	oh, so you're only dealing with grub at that point, no kernel yet?
2010-02-21T17:52:00.000Z	photon	jrib	I assume. I'm not knowledgeable enough to tell at which stage the kernel is loaded, but I see grub loading and then a screen prompting me for the password to unlock my root partition.
2010-02-21T18:04:00.000Z	photon	jrib	any ideas?
2010-02-21T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	photon	nope, I don't know enough about how the encryption is setup to help
2010-02-21T18:05:00.000Z	photon	jrib	thanks though
2010-02-21T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	photon	try to learn what exactly is responsible for asking for that password.  I think there's more than just grub involved
2011-05-06T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	photon	use « date »
2011-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	photon	jrib	and then file_name_`date -whatever` ???
2011-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	photon	yes, something like that
