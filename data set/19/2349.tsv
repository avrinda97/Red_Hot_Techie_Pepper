2010-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	Kartagis		what codec does mencoder require for libmp3lame?
2010-09-30T11:46:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	try mencoder -oac mp3lame
2010-09-30T11:48:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	it gives me No file given
2010-09-30T12:08:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	weren't you asking about mencoder. Did you see my answer?
2010-09-30T12:08:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	it gives me No file given
2010-09-30T12:09:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	you have to supply an input file (and probably an output file too). mencoder takes *lots* of options. What exactly are you trying to do. Maybe there's an easier way?
2010-09-30T12:10:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	at my work laptop, I get no errors. at home, I get Audio LAVC. Couldn't find codec for libmp3lame
2010-09-30T12:14:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	oh. the codecs are optional due to licensing issues, sounds like you don't have them installed on the home version. When you get home, you can install them. What release are you running at home?
2010-09-30T12:15:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	10.04
2010-09-30T12:15:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	I think you need the w32codecs mentioned here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2010-09-30T12:16:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	I don't have them at work, and it works
2010-09-30T12:18:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	so, the exact same command line is ok at work but fails at home?
2010-09-30T12:18:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	yes
2010-09-30T12:20:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	I dunno why it's ok at work, but I don't see how it can function without the codecs. How do you know they're not installed at work...?
2010-09-30T12:21:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	because I get errors
2010-10-04T11:12:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	It's not a good idea. All of these are compression schemes which are lossy, which means every time you do almost any conversion, you *lose* quality. Never convert unless you have to....
2010-10-04T11:14:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	I have to, because .mp4 is the only format my phone can read
2012-07-09T10:04:00.000Z	Loshki	Kartagis	running unity?
2012-07-09T10:06:00.000Z	Kartagis	Loshki	atm, cairo
