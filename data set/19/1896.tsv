2010-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	misterB		anyone here have any experiece with mounting ecryptfs files that were orphaned by fsck? Details @ http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/rQ9xrW2j
2010-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	been there done that :D  you need your key though
2010-09-20T09:41:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	got that
2010-09-20T09:41:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	you can use the ecryptfs tools to reconsruct it using your pwd. I've done that much before
2010-09-20T09:42:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	cool as then, got some links in my email will dig them out
2010-09-20T09:42:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	same routine then with the ones in lost and found, just copy them somewhere and work on them there
2010-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	when fsck orphaned my stuff, it messed up all the file names as well.
2010-09-20T09:46:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	ah, luckily its not the file names that matter, you checked for the .Private dir in your old /home (not user) folder I guess ?
2010-09-20T09:47:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	right. There is not .Private directory
2010-09-20T09:48:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	I could probably make a fair guess as to which one was my .Private directory though. Are there any other key files that matter?
2010-09-20T09:49:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	thats actually your files, there stored there
2010-09-20T09:50:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	is .Private a directory or a file?
2010-09-20T09:50:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	kind of anyway, try reading this, its comprehensive http://wikinewbie.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/rm-rf-ext4ecryptfs-undelete/
2010-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	folder
2010-09-20T09:52:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	not good. I don't have any orphaned directories that are any where near the right size.
2010-09-20T09:52:00.000Z	Asigottech	misterB	goog luck, remember to image / backup files first, im out
2010-09-20T09:52:00.000Z	misterB	Asigottech	files, yes. directories, no
