2007-09-18T08:19:00.000Z	cganya		pelo, XD i'm in central ontario
2007-09-18T08:21:00.000Z	cganya		pelo idleone, har har! found the cd's, i have install and live, version 5.04
2007-09-18T08:22:00.000Z	cganya		pelo, was java not avalible for ubuntu back then or is linux not backwards compatable?
2007-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	cganya		idlone, i imagine you cant just download and install the newer version of ubuntu, you have to use a CD?
2007-09-18T08:24:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, ah thanks for pointing that out
2007-09-18T08:24:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, crud
2007-09-18T08:25:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, i have a file i downloaded from the java website though... i cant just use that?
2007-09-18T08:25:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, that was my origonal question XD how do you use a .bin file
2007-09-18T08:27:00.000Z	trpr	cganya	try 'file yourfile.bin' .. i bet your bin is actually a script. sh ./myfile.bin
2007-09-18T08:27:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, update manager, ooo fun
2007-09-18T08:28:00.000Z	cganya	trpr	no offense, but that be moonspeak, not 48 hours ago i had never needed to use a linux machine
2007-09-18T08:29:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, waiit
2007-09-18T08:29:00.000Z	cganya		idleone, where is the update manager real quick
2007-09-18T08:29:00.000Z	trpr	cganya	the first part 'file somefile' is a command. run it to determine what kind of file you have
2007-09-18T08:29:00.000Z	trpr	cganya	and provided its identified as a script, run it with sh ./yourfile
2007-09-18T08:30:00.000Z	cganya		trdr, umm... run... thats a command prompt thing right?
2007-09-18T08:30:00.000Z	trpr	cganya	on the other hand if you can't get to the prompt to type in those commands just forget i mentioned it ;) im sure there are easier ways to install java
