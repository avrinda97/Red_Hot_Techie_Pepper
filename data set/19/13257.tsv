2006-04-26T16:41:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl		i'm testing dapper but i can't install the w32codecs to play divx files ?
2006-04-26T16:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	sure you can
2006-04-26T16:42:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: and in what repository can i find that ?
2006-04-26T16:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	ubotu just sent you a link, which shows you how to install the w32codecs
2006-04-26T16:43:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: thx
2006-04-26T16:45:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: when i try to install them i get an error saying that it isn't for X64
2006-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	oh, x64. No, unless you jump through a lot of hoops
2006-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: so there's no avi playback for x64 ?
2006-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	not with the codecs. I hear of people installing a 32bit ubuntu in a chroot for running videos, flash & the like, but most people that want that functionality fall back to installing the i386 version of ubuntu
2006-04-26T16:48:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: would that make me loose much performance, because i have an AMD 3800+ X2
2006-04-26T16:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	I hear that for most purposes the i386 version doesn't lose much over the x64
2006-04-26T16:50:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: damn
2006-04-26T16:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	I don't have first hand experience on the i386/amd64 question, so I'm just parroting what I have heard.
2006-04-26T16:52:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: no prob i'll just try it
2006-04-26T16:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	wise choice :) Set up a couple of partitions, install each, and make your own evaluation
2006-04-26T16:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Ti_Uhl	be sure to set up a separate partition for /home, you can use it under both the i386 and amd64 installs
2006-04-26T16:54:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: thx for the info :)
2006-04-26T16:59:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	nickrud	: vlc seems to play my divx files prefectly, but that uses it's own codecs
