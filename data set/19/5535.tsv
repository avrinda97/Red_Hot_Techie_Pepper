2008-06-10T15:00:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	from a terminal, run 'gksudo gdmsetup' -- does this work? If not, does it report an error in the terminal?
2008-06-10T15:00:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	it does the same thing, the window appears for half a second then goes
2008-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	it does the same thing, the window appears for half a second then goes
2008-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	you could run 'sudo strace gdmsetup', see if you can make sense of the output
2008-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	it'll probably tell you what it fails on
2008-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	you ecpect me to read about 1,000 pages of info?!
2008-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	it's your choice
2008-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	hint: what you're looking for is probably at the end of this output
2008-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	lots of missing thumbnail pngs and a segmentation fault
2008-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	do you get segfaults with any other programs?
2008-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	not that i know of
2008-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	try a 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install gdm' and retry gksudo gdmsetup
2008-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	sudo didnt ask for pass and this happened:
2008-06-10T15:34:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	is gdmsetup working now?
2008-06-10T15:41:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	is gdmsetup working now?
2008-06-10T15:42:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	no i can't quit synaptic, it's still updating
2008-06-10T15:42:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	it's not sensible to run gdmsetup while you're updating, anyway
2008-06-10T15:43:00.000Z	ndf	soundray	i spose, but it's not actually installing yet, it's just downloading packages
2008-06-11T05:11:00.000Z	soundray	ndf	and do you see lots of help pouring in as a result? No, you've just managed to annoy.
