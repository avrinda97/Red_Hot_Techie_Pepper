2008-03-18T16:54:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	Yup, amongst other browers
2008-03-18T16:54:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	do u know how to make my opera play videos?
2008-03-18T16:54:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	i can use firefox to view videos but not opera
2008-03-18T16:54:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	Not sure sorry
2008-03-18T17:03:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	you might want to try epiphany, it seems to take advantage of the installed media players that you may have installed for firefox,  but it seems lighter-weight in use. Galeon is handy as well.
2008-03-18T17:03:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	i will try them out!
2008-03-18T17:04:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	thx very much :)
2008-03-18T17:05:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	It may be over kill for your needs - but I tend to have a selection of browsers at my disposal as it allows me to log into the same website under separate sessions  for testing when I'm developeing.
2008-03-18T17:18:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	do u dl torrent using opera? i use deluge as my torrent client, do u know how i can cancel this option in opera? bcos opera uses bittorrent by default :(
2008-03-18T17:19:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	I don't use opera for torrent downloading, I use bitswash, a stand alone torrent client
2008-03-18T17:20:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	let me look at my opera prefs - I'll see whether I can find anything
2008-03-18T17:20:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	yes, me too...but i can't disable it
2008-03-18T17:20:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	thx
2008-03-18T17:22:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	within Opera, go to tools->preferences->Downloads,  untick the "Hide file types opened with opera" option, type torrent into the "quick find" box and you can edit or delete the handler option for torrent files
2008-03-18T17:25:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	tq very much!!!! i was wondering y i couldn't find anything in prefences
2008-03-18T17:25:00.000Z	Nikki85	bytecode	tq very much u were very helpful
2008-03-18T17:25:00.000Z	bytecode	Nikki85	no problem - have a nice day :-)
