2009-10-20T22:44:00.000Z	lo127		I have a subversion repository in /var/<repos>, how do I set the filesystem permission so that multiple users can acces it?
2009-10-20T22:46:00.000Z	beli	lo127	chmod -R o+r /path/to/folder   ...o stands for others....+r for adding read permissions,,, the -R does it recursive on all files and dirs
2009-10-20T22:46:00.000Z	lo127	beli	is that really how its done?
2009-10-20T22:47:00.000Z	beli	lo127	no. ask your local police officer
2009-10-20T22:47:00.000Z	lo127		I was thinking about creating a group "subversion" an use chgrp -R subversion /path
2009-10-20T22:47:00.000Z	beli	lo127	sure its done that way....read manuals! man chmod   and man chown
2009-10-20T22:47:00.000Z	lo127		but that would force me to change the standard creaton group of all users to subversion, right?
2009-10-20T22:48:00.000Z	beli	lo127	no...OTHERS stands for the rest of the world
2009-10-20T22:48:00.000Z	beli	lo127	you can set perms for the user, the group and all others of the file/dir
2009-10-20T22:49:00.000Z	lo127	beli	not sure I wan't all local users to have r+w in the repos
2009-10-20T22:49:00.000Z	lo127	beli	anyway, if a user creates a file in the repos, what happens with the permissions
2009-10-20T22:49:00.000Z	lo127		it won't be 777 any more, will it?
2009-10-20T22:53:00.000Z	beli	lo127	best way is to add the local users to one group....maybe they have a common group USERS....and then adjust the group permissions to +rw  ....existing files are unchanged of permissions...new files will take user:group
2009-10-20T22:54:00.000Z	beli	lo127	why not just read the manuals? its all in there
2009-10-20T22:54:00.000Z	lo127	beli	so the new files has to be manually changed to the correct group?
2009-10-20T22:54:00.000Z	beli	lo127	no!
2009-10-20T22:55:00.000Z	beli	lo127	you dont listen....read the manual
2009-10-20T22:55:00.000Z	lo127	beli	chill out, I will
2009-10-20T22:56:00.000Z	lo127	beli	thanks anyway
