2009-05-19T18:46:00.000Z	SolusMIB		hey all...
2009-05-19T18:47:00.000Z	SolusMIB		anyone here familiar with super formatting floppy disks with ubuntu 9.04?
2009-05-19T18:48:00.000Z	SolusMIB		superformat /dev/fd0  = error...it can't find fd0   anyone know why?
2009-05-19T18:49:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	do you have a /dev/fd/0?
2009-05-19T18:52:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	does "lsmod | grep floppy" return anything?
2009-05-19T18:55:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	did you try the "lsmod | grep floppy" command i asked about?
2009-05-19T18:56:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	*tap*tap*tap* is this thing on? "lsmod | grep floppy"?
2009-05-19T19:01:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	hmm, no response at all? try "sudo modprobe floppy", and see if it doesn't load the driver for you.
2009-05-19T19:01:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	might just be that it wasn't loaded automatically when the drivers were swapped.
2009-05-19T19:05:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	interesting. so what device does it mount as? try a "mount" when the windows floppy is inserted.
2009-05-19T19:06:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	there should be one line corresponding to the floppy; something like "/dev/sda1 on /mnt/floppy" or the like.
2009-05-19T19:07:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	if it's easier, you can just pastebin the output of "mount"
2009-05-19T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	ah, so try superfomat with the /dev/sdb argument.
2009-05-19T19:17:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	/dev/sdb, right? not a?
2009-05-19T19:17:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	/dev/sda is the disk in the machine, surely?
2009-05-19T19:19:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	how did you unmount the drive?
2009-05-19T19:21:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	can you verify that /dev/sdb is not mounted via "df"? also, what was the exact superformat command you used?
2009-05-19T19:28:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	hmm. unfortunately, i have to be afk for a while. my only suggestion at this point would be to burn the floppy drive :-) you can make a normal filesystem on it using mke2fs, which is probably your best bet. superformat is for low-level formatting anyway, not really needed for a "recent" floppy disk.
2009-05-19T19:29:00.000Z	sipior	SolusMIB	or just leave the windows filesystem in place, might be easier when interacting with other systems. good luck!
