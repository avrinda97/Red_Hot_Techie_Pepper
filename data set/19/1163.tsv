2011-08-13T22:45:00.000Z	maestrojed		I am building a new box to be a media center, I bought a quad-core AMD PhonomII. Should I use ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent or
2011-08-13T22:45:00.000Z	maestrojed		ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
2011-08-13T22:47:00.000Z	maestrojed		why would I chose the amd64 over the i386 version?
2011-08-13T22:49:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64
2011-08-13T22:54:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	basically 64bit allows individual programs to access more ram than 32bit, and 64bit enables additional registers which make some programs faster, and 64bit enables some advanced sse instructions useful in media encoding, but 64bit doubles the size of pointers and increases program memory usage
2011-08-13T22:55:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	ok, sounds like the better choice. The ubuntu website has (recommended) next to the 32bit version and I wonder why. But thank you on the advice. I am going to download the 64 bit version
2011-08-13T22:55:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	because 32bit is universally compatible. better than someone wondering why their system doesn't boot because they picked the wrong one
2011-08-13T22:56:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	THX!
2011-12-04T04:24:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	run "sudo blkid" and identify the uuid of the partitions you want mounted, and add a line to your fstab with the matching uuid
2011-12-04T04:27:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	 feel free to !paste stuff to us if you want to know what things mean
2011-12-04T04:27:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	ok, as far as options, I am only listing "auto". Anything else you would suggest? This is just a data drive with my music and media
2011-12-04T04:30:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	depends on the partition type
2011-12-04T04:31:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	ok, I am going give this a few tries. See if I can figure it out
2011-12-04T04:32:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	if you dont know the partition type then you can use the disk utility. if the partitions are linux partitions (ext2/3/4) auto is fine, for fat32/ntfs you may want to use some other otions
2011-12-04T04:32:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	its ext4. I typically mounts at /media/Pam so I am going to give it a try first.
2011-12-04T04:33:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	so that looks like uuid=??? /media/Pam ext4 defaults 0 0
2011-12-04T04:33:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	yes, I had "auto" instead of "defaults" but it seemed to work. I appreciate the help
2011-12-04T04:34:00.000Z	escott	maestrojed	klj613 i need to sign-off. goodluck
2011-12-04T04:34:00.000Z	maestrojed	escott	thank you, pease
