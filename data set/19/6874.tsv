2008-05-09T03:46:00.000Z	ere4si	Mimi	have a look at the second last post here - it might answer your mount prob - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hal/+bug/49890
2008-05-09T03:47:00.000Z	Mimi	ere4si	 the 2nd post? this one? Thanks for your bug report. With the drive attached could you run 'lsusb' and add the output? Could you also add the output of 'dmesg' after booting the system with the USB drive connected?
2008-05-09T03:47:00.000Z	ere4si	Mimi	second last
