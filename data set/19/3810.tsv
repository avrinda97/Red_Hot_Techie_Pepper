2009-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne		Indus: Could I steal you for some help with ALSA too please, well when you are done helping Omar87
2009-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	iam  a big noob to be honest but ill try to help
2009-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	you can go ahead and ask though, i can handle 2 at one time :P
2009-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	Me too, but it seems you know a little more then I do.
2009-06-17T11:44:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	why did you install alsa that way?
2009-06-17T11:45:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	It just seemed the easiest, Im still new to linux and I dont know how to compile from source and stuff
2009-06-17T11:46:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	when you installed jaunty, wasnt sound working for you by default?
2009-06-17T11:48:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	Yes it was, but when I would use skype my cpu usage would leap to 100% and then it would crash skype or some weird issues
2009-06-17T11:49:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	i suggest you go back to default sound first otherwise its difficult to troubleshoot/ in skype you can set sound output to pulse and fiddle
2009-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	actually I might have fixed my problem it was a typo on my part
2009-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	what do you mean?
2009-06-17T12:00:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	you solved your prob?
2009-06-17T12:01:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	but what was the exact problem you were facing?
2009-06-17T12:03:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	Um just a typo, but other then that everything else works now. That script was really easy to get working and I didnt need to do much config
2009-06-17T12:03:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	hmm ok cool. Good night indeed then for you :)
2009-06-17T12:04:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	yes it shall be, is there something that I might be able to help you with?
2009-06-17T12:04:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	heh nothing really, my ubuntu is working perfect almost :)
2009-06-17T12:04:00.000Z	indus	PsyCl0ne	thank you
2009-06-17T12:04:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	indus	kk, I just thought id ask. Have a gnight and thanks for your help.
