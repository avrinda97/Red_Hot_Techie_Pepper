2011-01-20T18:48:00.000Z	ngrstan		omg! you guys are talking about grub!
2011-01-20T18:48:00.000Z	ngrstan		i've been up all night trying to get that damn thing working properly.
2011-01-20T18:48:00.000Z	DasEi	ngrstan	ask in a precise manner, for  hard chews try #grub
2011-01-20T18:49:00.000Z	DasEi		ghh: you want a default install without splashscreen ?
2011-01-20T18:49:00.000Z	ngrstan	DasEi	i booted into livecd ubuntu 10.04, resized my main (ubuntu) partition just fine, installed winxp onto newly created ntfs partition.  it proceeded to screw up my mbr, and would only boot into winxp
2011-01-20T18:50:00.000Z	ngrstan		so my process at that point was trying every method to repair the mbr, reinstall grub, etc
2011-01-20T18:50:00.000Z	ngrstan		so far i've run into hangups at every stop. results so far have included: boots into grub itself.  also, boots into black screen.
2011-01-20T18:50:00.000Z	DasEi	ngrstan	ah, so first few steps back, after resizing, did you adjust /etc/fstab ?
2011-01-20T18:51:00.000Z	ngrstan	DasEi	i did not.  i used gparted to change the size of the main partition and add the new ntfs partition
2011-01-20T18:51:00.000Z	ngrstan		currently gparted, ubuntu installer, etc, all show the partitions just fine.
2011-01-20T18:52:00.000Z	DasEi	ngrstan	so way to go is than, boot live cd, get the (now changed) uuids from your resized linux-partitons, correct fstab  and device.map,  chroot into the system, re-install grub and install os-prober
2011-01-20T18:52:00.000Z	DasEi		then*
2011-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	DasEi		!blkid | ngrstan
2011-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	ngrstan		the current uuid appears to be correct, or at least its what i've pulled up in the console
2011-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	DasEi		!grub
2011-01-20T18:53:00.000Z	ngrstan		i said grub, i meant grub2
2011-01-20T18:54:00.000Z	DasEi	ngrstan	the first link from !grub details how to chroot, but first the ""new"" partitons must be found again
2011-01-20T18:54:00.000Z	ngrstan		the ubuntu install is meerkat, i'm on a lynx livedisc, if that is relevant
2011-01-20T18:54:00.000Z	DasEi	ngrstan	common sense in ubu, grub is now grub2
