2007-02-08T08:38:00.000Z	DiaboluZ		hbaigu> yes :) e.g. utorrent (through wine) which always puts an icon in tray with all the other front-ends
2007-02-08T08:38:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	I have a bug with utorrent, can you confirm?
2007-02-08T08:39:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	Open utorrent.  minimize it to tray.  open it again.  is it a very very tall and skinny window?
2007-02-08T08:46:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	?
2007-02-08T08:48:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	oh.  didn't see.
2007-02-08T08:49:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	yes.  I asked you a yes / no question
2007-02-08T08:50:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	right-clicking > show / hide utorrent still puts it in a tall and skinny window
2007-02-08T08:50:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	Do you know any way to make it go away from the taskbar?
2007-02-08T08:51:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	right.  it can be resized to correct this, but it's still annoying
2007-02-08T08:54:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	So you get maximum throughput with utorrent 1,6 under wine?
2007-02-08T08:59:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	I'm still experimenting.
2007-02-08T09:00:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	I'm getting 60kbytes/s right now, which is only like 5% of my max speed
2007-02-08T09:05:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	mmm how you have 100mb link?
2007-02-08T09:06:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	eh ?
2007-02-08T09:07:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	How do you get your stuff off the server?  Is it close physically?
2007-02-08T09:07:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	Then why run it there at all? :P
2007-02-08T09:08:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	So you need to keep your ratio up for private trackers, eh.  I seee
2007-02-08T09:19:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	Oh, here is another one.. have you gotten torrent files setup to open with utorrent?
2007-02-08T09:19:00.000Z	Quintin	DiaboluZ	mm
