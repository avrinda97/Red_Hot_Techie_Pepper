2010-09-27T20:22:00.000Z	jimmy51_		how can i install lilo on my usb flash drive i have plugged in and mounted as /dev/flashdisk?
2010-09-27T20:23:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	why on EARTH are you using /dev/flashdisk?!?
2010-09-27T20:23:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	sorry, i meant /media/flashdisk
2010-09-27T20:23:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	/dev/sdh1 is /media/flashdisk
2010-09-27T20:24:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	yes, lilo /dev/sdh1
2010-09-27T20:24:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	ok, thanks
2010-09-27T20:24:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	read man lilo for more info
2010-09-27T20:25:00.000Z	gartral		i think i need a hdd x.x
2010-09-27T20:26:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	i specify the partition,. and it makes the drive bootable?
2010-09-27T20:26:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	well, yes, but thats for computers who's BIOS dont support "fastbooting" a USB stick
2010-09-27T20:27:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	as of right now, you should be able to select the boot order from bios
2010-09-27T20:28:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	i'm hoping to have it boot to the usb stick, and chainload to the HDD
2010-09-27T20:29:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	oww.. why?
2010-09-27T20:29:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	hmm, it's saying lilo isn't installed.  i apt-get installed it.  this isn't going to replace my system's bootloader is it?
2010-09-27T20:29:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	i want to boot to flash, attempt to chainload what's on the HDD, if it fails, have it fail over to the flash
2010-09-27T20:30:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	and... if the HDD dies completely, i want it to failover and keep booting from flash
2010-09-27T20:30:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	i've got an OS on both the HDD and flash... flash is for failover boots
2010-09-27T20:31:00.000Z	gartral	jimmy51_	read up on man pages pal
2010-09-27T20:31:00.000Z	jimmy51_	gartral	doh.  i left my decipher key at home :|
