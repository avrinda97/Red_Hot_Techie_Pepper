2010-07-11T04:10:00.000Z	monokrome		hey
2010-07-11T04:10:00.000Z	monokrome		Is it possible to install 32 bit Python on a 64 bit Ubuntu system?
2010-07-11T04:11:00.000Z	monokrome		I know there's something like: dpkg install --ignore-architecture
2010-07-11T04:11:00.000Z	monokrome		but I think that'll overwrite my already existing code
2010-07-11T04:11:00.000Z	monokrome		er... already existing installation
2010-07-11T04:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 why do you need 32bit python?
2010-07-11T04:12:00.000Z	monokrome	Dr_Willis	In order to link the 32bit python DLL to a project that I'm working on that has to be compiled as 32bit
2010-08-10T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 alt-clock on panel, (on a non button/gadget area) drag/drop to other monitor
2010-08-10T05:21:00.000Z	monokrome	Dr_Willis	Ah. They hid it a little. Nice. Thank you :)
2010-12-26T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 its proberly in the coreutils package. or some other package with other tools.
2010-12-26T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 i think the apt-file tool can tell what package it comes from also.
2010-12-26T19:24:00.000Z	monokrome	Dr_Willis	apt-cache search useradd only results in a LDAP tool called cpu
2010-12-26T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 try apt-file
2010-12-26T19:25:00.000Z	monokrome	Dr_Willis	I don't even have that
2010-12-26T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 then install it.. :)
2010-12-26T19:28:00.000Z	monokrome	Dr_Willis	Doesn't show anything.
2010-12-26T19:31:00.000Z	monokrome	Dr_Willis	The only reason that I am asking, is because I want to know the method that `useradd` "safely" copies all files from /etc/skel/
2010-12-31T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 its past end of life for starters.. time to upgrade.
2010-12-31T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monokrome	 so all packages would have been moved to the 'archive' servers. whatever they are called.. i forget
