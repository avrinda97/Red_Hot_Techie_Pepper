2005-07-06T07:37:00.000Z	tkiesel		Hi all.  I had (yet another) question. My wife and I are about to reformat her old Windows Xp partition. (woo hoo!)  I am uncertain as to the location of GRUB though, and don't want to leave her computer unbootable.
2005-07-06T07:38:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	if your bios was made within the last 10 years, grub should properly write over the MBR and display a menu on boot for what OS to run.  You can rezise NTFS partitions, btw, so you could install both OSs at the same time
2005-07-06T07:38:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	Nice. Well, we're actually just getting rid of her Win Xp partition for the space. She's decided to go Ubuntu 100%.
2005-07-06T07:39:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	have you used linux much before?
2005-07-06T07:39:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	For the last several months, yes.
2005-07-06T07:42:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	How to install GRUB if erasing the old win partition destroys it.
2005-07-06T07:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	what's your current partitioning setup?
2005-07-06T07:44:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	First partition on the disk is primary, contains the old Win XP install.  The rest of the disk is an extended partition that includes the various partitions Ubuntu is using.  swap, /, /home/, and a FAT32 shared part.
2005-07-06T07:45:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	okay.  So you're going to delete the windows partition, and then what?
2005-07-06T07:47:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	Format it.  reiserfs or maybe ext3.  Space for the wife's files.  The /home partition is getting cramped. ;)
2005-07-06T07:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	when you type `mount` does it list it?
2005-07-06T08:01:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	and reka:  Here's my plan. Format the partition and reinstall GRUB from the rescue terminal of the install CD, then copy over the existing grub menu to the new boot partition.  Good idea? Bad?
2005-07-06T08:01:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	any reason you need a boot partition now, but didn't before?
2005-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	There's a boot partition. It's just housed in the Windows partition we're going to destroy.
2005-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	So the short answer to your question is that there was a boot partition before. lol
2005-07-06T08:03:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	oh
2005-07-06T08:03:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	tkiesel	then why do you need to change anything?  lol sorry I'm not being very helpful..
2005-07-06T08:03:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	Because the existing boot partition is about to be eradicated when we format that part of the drive, and my wife needs a bootable computer.  lmao.
2005-07-06T08:12:00.000Z	tkiesel	tiglionabbit	Okay. I just checked out her GRUB menu.lst. The Grub root is referring to (hd0,1) Which is the second partition on her first hard drive. That's her current Ubuntu /, meanign that I'm nto going to be wiping out any kernels here.  Thanks for the help!
