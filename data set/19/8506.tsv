2007-03-20T15:25:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	use the pastebin if necessary

2007-03-20T15:27:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	I would try the fixres approach first
2007-03-20T15:36:00.000Z	RolandB1	soundray	: hey,  when I paste the code ddcprobe | grep monitorrange it dosne't show me anytying ( I fallow that doc you gave me )
2007-03-20T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	not all monitors support ddc. Get the specs from the monitor manual, or use the "simple" option in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	RolandB1	soundray	: can you take a look please http://pastebin.ca/403413
2007-03-20T15:58:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	in Section "Screen", you have Device     "Generic Video Card" -- should this be Device "aticonfig-Device[0] "?
2007-03-20T15:58:00.000Z	RolandB1	soundray	just a sec please
2007-03-20T15:59:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	essentially, you have to go through and check all the cross-references in the config.
2007-03-20T16:01:00.000Z	RolandB1	soundray	http://pastebin.ca/403416 here is my lasted xorg.conf but it still dosne't work
2007-03-20T16:02:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	you haven't corrected the mistake I pointed out in the earlier one
2007-03-20T16:03:00.000Z	RolandB1	soundray	: I've added HorizSync  and VertRefresh
2007-03-20T16:03:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	in Section "Screen", you have Device     "Generic Video Card" -- should this be Device "aticonfig-Device[0] "?
2007-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	RolandB1	soundray	ok I've added that..now I get http://pastebin.ca/403421
2007-03-20T16:08:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	revert that change and read my earlier replies carefully
2007-03-20T16:09:00.000Z	soundray	RolandB1	better yet, restore xorg.conf from the oldest backup in /etc/X11 and start over, following the wiki instructions carefully
