2009-11-20T16:05:00.000Z	Will123456		hey guys. quick question: for a 1.6 ghz single core AMD XP with a gig of DDR RAM, is it worth going to xubuntu just for a quick boost of speed? it's fine running ubuntu but can struggle with some websites, esp. if there's quite a few tabs up. (i've read that xubuntu is quicker than ubuntu but actually not THAT much quicker, not as much as they make out anyway)
2009-11-20T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	xubuntu will be more responsive but i've ran a full kde system on a similar rig
2009-11-20T16:10:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	thanks, i guess i may as well stick with ubuntu then (it's for my mum and she's more familiar with gnome) :)
2009-11-20T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	cool, if she likes it then stick with it, user interface familiarity an all
2009-11-20T20:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	gotcha
2010-02-19T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	use a lighter de like xfce or lxde
2010-02-19T00:04:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	i'm assuming lxde and xfce are lighter on harddrive space too? as performance in other areas isn't a problem
2010-02-19T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	yes they are smaller there too. Using less ram will give more to disk cache which should make things nicer. You can also turn down vm.swappiiness so swap is used oonly when needed
2011-07-13T09:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	i would but I'm ssh'd in from work, no can do
2011-07-13T09:02:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	fair enough - I actually thought a bunch of you would be in that situation :P
2011-07-13T09:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	plus I use openbox so I doubt its relevant to your (most likely) gnome desktop
2011-07-13T09:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	does it happen as all users?
2011-07-13T09:05:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	I actually didn't even think of testing that. i'll do it right now. thanks!
2011-07-13T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	try thinking instead of the snappy remark earlier ;)
2011-07-13T09:06:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	duly noted - i'm already feeling ashamed :P
2011-07-13T09:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	its cool :D
2011-07-13T09:09:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	other users have the same problem (including the super key not working). as much as it pains me to say this i might end up reinstalling ubuntu! :(
2011-07-13T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Will123456	then it is a bug, not bad settings
2011-07-13T09:10:00.000Z	Will123456	ActionParsnip	in that case i'll definitely file a bug
