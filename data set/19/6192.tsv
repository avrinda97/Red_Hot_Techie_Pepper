2008-09-29T18:15:00.000Z	l33		I guess you've tried a minimal apt-sources and apt-get update?
2008-09-29T18:17:00.000Z	l33		good luck
2008-09-29T18:18:00.000Z	l33		narco what version of ubuntu you usu
2008-09-29T18:20:00.000Z	l33		so. anyone know how I can achive this
2008-09-29T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	l33	best to just repeat your question since most people have no idea what "this" is
2008-09-29T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	l33	are you mrnaan?
2008-09-29T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	l33	after you apt-get source, apply the patch, then rebuild
2008-09-29T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	l33	take a quick look at 'man patch'.  It's very readable.  poke me if you're stuck
2008-09-29T18:30:00.000Z	l33	jrib	the package already has a diff? can I just diff the source and do apt-get -b ? or do I have to do other things
2008-09-29T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	l33	what do you mean by "the package already has a diff"?
2008-09-29T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	l33	no, that's something different
2008-09-29T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	l33	you need to go inside the directory you got and apply patch
2008-09-29T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	l33	they're the same
2008-09-29T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	l33	you need to diff the right versions
