2006-09-02T13:31:00.000Z	JamieBE		Hi there guys. I have a 300GB external FAT32 USB drive - using Ubuntu, how can I change the name of the drive, it is currently "NEW VOLUME"
2006-09-02T13:31:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	you have to go into the properties of the drive, or use fdisk /dev/sda
2006-09-02T13:32:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	How to I enter the properties of the drive?
2006-09-02T13:32:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	just use fdisk /dev/sda and type m for the help menu and you should be able to press something in order to change the name of the volume
2006-09-02T13:36:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	sorry, which switch would I use to edit the "NEW VOLUME" part?
2006-09-02T13:39:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	i'm getting there
2006-09-02T13:40:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	sorry.
2006-09-02T13:40:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	its t once you get into the sudo fdisk /dev/hd
2006-09-02T13:40:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	And then...
2006-09-02T13:40:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	t
2006-09-02T13:42:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	that might work as well, never done it that way
2006-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	Annoyingly enough it doesn't?
2006-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	do what?
2006-09-02T13:44:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	what doesn't work?
2006-09-02T13:49:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	I tried using something called e2label and tune2fs - Neither of them support volume renaming under Fat32!?
2006-09-02T13:55:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	I figured it out. There is a tool called mtools - It allows modification of volume names for FAT32 USB drives under Ubuntu. Is there any way of suggesting that this simple command actually works in the next release of Ubuntu?
2006-09-02T13:55:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	good for you, i don't use FAT32 anymore
2006-09-02T13:56:00.000Z	Sivik	JamieBE	especially on this computer since i don't have this nasty thing call microcrap installed on it
2006-09-02T13:57:00.000Z	JamieBE	Sivik	What FS do you use for external drives?
