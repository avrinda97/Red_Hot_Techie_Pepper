2009-03-20T02:18:00.000Z	mr_claus		which partition should have the boot flag? root or /boot?
2009-03-20T02:18:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	it doesn't really matter to GRUB
2009-03-20T02:18:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	(as long as GRUB is installed in the MBR, that is)
2009-03-20T02:19:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	i don't think that has anything to do with what the boot partition is
2009-03-20T02:20:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	ok, do you know how i can find out why grub don't want to boot the kernel? i have a /boot partition on sda2
2009-03-20T02:21:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	# groot=(hd0,1) should do it i think, but still that error
2009-03-20T02:21:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	honestly i just use a vanilla grub configuration with no separate /boot partition so i'm not all that familiar with it. perhaps /boot/grub/device.map isn't quite right?
2009-03-20T02:23:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	device.map has only one line "(hd0)   /dev/sda", seems to be right
2009-03-20T02:24:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	well if you want, pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst as well as the output of "ls -l /boot", though i don't know if i'll be able to help

2009-03-20T02:27:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	/dev/sda1 is mapped to /dev/mapper/root (crypted fs), /dev/sda2 is /boot and /dev/sda3 is a swap partition
2009-03-20T02:29:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	i don't know, it all looks correct to me
2009-03-20T02:30:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	grub stop working in stage 1.5, error 24 is, if i checked out correct, continue working without a valid kernel

2009-03-20T02:35:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	hey, sounds good, ty for that link
2009-03-20T02:36:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	i'm not sure i understand what it's saying in its entirety, but it, err, sounds related
2009-03-20T02:37:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	absolutely, because i used a plain root partition without a /boot before i started the encryption of the filesystem
2009-03-20T03:00:00.000Z	mr_claus	LjL	it works, thank you again
2009-03-20T03:00:00.000Z	LjL	mr_claus	nice
