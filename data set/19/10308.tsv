2006-06-28T07:04:00.000Z	neutrinomass		How do I tell that 3d acceleration is enabled ?
2006-06-28T07:04:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	try glxinfo | grep OpenGL
2006-06-28T07:06:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	What do I expect to see ? I don't have a 3d card on this comp, but I'm going to a store with a livecd to check out a laptop.
2006-06-28T07:06:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	I take it that it should work out of the box (some integrated intel controller I think )
2006-06-28T07:07:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	well the nvidia or ati supplied drivers isn't included on the livecd, but generally you should buy nvidia with linux, works best
2006-06-28T07:08:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	Yeah, I know that part ;) It's not nvidia or ATI, it's some shared memory intel integrated graphics (but I've got no model from the prospectus).
2006-06-28T07:09:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	glxinfo | grep OpenGL should tell me whether 3d is enabled. If it is enabled, I guess everything is alright and that graphics-wise the laptop is OK ?
2006-06-28T07:09:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	I wouldn't buy it then, but I've heard that the intel 945 have decent drivers.. anyway if you want that exact model I think you should get the chipset name with lspci and then google it
2006-06-28T07:10:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	It's a great deal (1GB DDR, Core Duo, 100GB sata hd, dvdrw for 950 euros) :( Ok, will do that. Final question: What do I expect to see in grep OpenGL that will tell me whether 3d is enabled?
2006-06-28T07:10:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	no glxinfo | grep OpenGL will only give you the vendor and manufacturer strings for the currently running GLX
2006-06-28T07:10:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	Oh...
2006-06-28T07:11:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	the livecd usually only provides the mesa software rendering glx.. you should get the name if the chipset with lspci and then google the name + linux
2006-06-28T07:11:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	that should give you a clue as the whether linux accelerated drivers exists :)
2006-06-28T07:12:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	Ok thanks. Any idea on how well ipw3945 works ?
2006-06-28T07:12:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	I don't even know what it is mate :)
2006-06-28T07:12:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	Ok thanks anyway :) (wireless )
2006-06-28T07:13:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	I still haven't jumped on the wifi bandwaggon so I don't know that much about wlan config.. but again google is usually your friend.. although it can take some time :)
2006-06-28T07:14:00.000Z	neutrinomass	biscon	I've found http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net which is endorsed by Intel so it's probably not too bad, but I'm looking for first hand experience as well ;)
2006-06-28T07:14:00.000Z	biscon	neutrinomass	well that probably means that is is an open source driver backed by the company who makes it (intel), that usually means great support.. but again I don't know anything about wifi
