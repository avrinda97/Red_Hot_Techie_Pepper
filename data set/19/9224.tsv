2006-12-09T06:53:00.000Z	delight		is the xinerama the right method to expand my laptops view to a external screen ?
2006-12-09T06:53:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	Depends on what release. If it's pre-edgy, yes.
2006-12-09T06:53:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	no its edgy
2006-12-09T06:53:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	Then there's something else (I've been told) ... but I've not tested it myself.
2006-12-09T06:53:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	whats the name ?
2006-12-09T06:54:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	Don't remember - just asked a friend of mine who was the one who mentioned it to me.
2006-12-09T06:54:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	All my workstations are either pre-edgy or different distros, so I'm using xinerama.
2006-12-09T06:55:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	... ok ... i will try looking into xinerama and get it working ... i just asked because i also read something about twinview and could not distinguish whats the right method
2006-12-09T06:56:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	meaning the descent method ... thank u so far
2006-12-09T06:56:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	It might be that twinview is the 'new' thing.
2006-12-09T06:56:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	.. fine then I'll google both
2006-12-09T06:57:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	And IIRC he mentioned that xinerama no longer works - but as I say, I've not tested myself.
2006-12-09T06:57:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	.. oh thats not to good info
2006-12-09T06:58:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	He's said "Dualview" is the name of the new 'thing'
2006-12-09T06:58:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	Let me know how you get on with it.
2006-12-09T06:59:00.000Z	delight	bigbro	ok ;)
2006-12-09T07:11:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	Apparently my friend made up the word 'DualView' - he actually meant 'TwinView'.
2006-12-09T07:11:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	I have mocked him and applied appropriate derision ;-)
2006-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	bigbro	delight	Also, he has now pointed out that it might only be something to do with nVidia chipsets only... http://www.killminus9.net/index.php?article=16#updates
