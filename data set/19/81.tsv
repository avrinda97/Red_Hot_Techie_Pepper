2012-10-09T04:13:00.000Z	klaxtr		im learning python and seems that gnome terminal works as python, so i was wondering if gnome terminal had something of python code on it
2012-10-09T04:14:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	the shell can interpret scripts and so forth, you can run python code as you need
2012-10-09T04:14:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	thats why bash scripts have #!/bin/bash  at the top, python will have a python based line.
2012-10-09T04:17:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	you can use python in gnome-terminal
2012-10-09T04:20:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	the interpretter is flexible
2012-10-09T04:21:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	the same way you use bash scripts
2012-10-09T04:21:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	just start a text file with:  #!/usr/bin/python       and use python commands, it will run. You will need to make the text file executable
2012-10-09T04:22:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	when you run it, the interpretter will see you telling it to use python, and itwill be used
2012-10-09T04:25:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1268495/   for example
2012-10-09T04:26:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	whack it in a text file, mark it as executable and you have a python script
2012-10-09T04:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	many
2012-10-09T04:31:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1268497/

2012-10-09T04:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	dropbox is python based too
2012-10-09T04:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	klaxtr	it's not going to stop in 2012
