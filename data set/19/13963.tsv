2005-04-28T05:37:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, do you mean find out whats mounded
2005-04-28T05:37:00.000Z	ssam		emilile, no squid for megamind
2005-04-28T05:37:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, do you mean find out whats mounted
2005-04-28T05:38:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, if you type 'mount' you get a list of mounted drives
2005-04-28T05:39:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, 'fdisk -l /dev/sda' will list all the partitions on a drive
2005-04-28T05:39:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, /dev/sda is the usually point for usb drives
2005-04-28T05:40:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, warty or hoary?
2005-04-28T05:41:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, oh, stuff may have broken, you could try the dev mailinglist/forum
2005-04-28T05:43:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, yes, but if the right people arn't in the irc room at the moment, then they wont see the message, mailinglist and forums will get noticed eventually
2005-04-28T05:43:00.000Z	ssam		benjamin_L, is there a dev irc room? #ubuntu-dev ?
2005-04-28T05:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ssam	#ubuntu-devel
2006-03-18T07:57:00.000Z	ssam	LinuxJones	digg this one up http://digg.com/linux_unix/Ubuntu_password_bug_fixed_in_just_a_few_hours
2006-03-18T07:58:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ssam	yeah it's great that it was so fast but how long has this bug been known ?
2006-03-18T07:58:00.000Z	ssam	LinuxJones	since this afternoon
2006-03-18T07:59:00.000Z	ssam	LinuxJones	unless people knew and kept it secret
2006-03-18T07:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ssam	well it's fixed now :)
2006-03-18T08:00:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ssam	I think I will run a major grep on my system overnight to see if it pops up anywhere else :(
2006-03-18T08:01:00.000Z	ssam	LinuxJones	good idea, i think that will now be part of standard testing
2006-03-18T08:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ssam	:)
