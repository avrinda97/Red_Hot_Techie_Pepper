2010-02-01T15:44:00.000Z	rileyp	jamie	you might be better off doing clean install and then doing a backup then updateing
2010-02-01T15:45:00.000Z	rileyp	jamie	you are looking for item s that get repeated  repetedely
2010-02-01T15:45:00.000Z	jamie	rileyp	hmm... but this is pretty much a clean install, only installed about an hour ago
2010-02-01T15:45:00.000Z	rileyp	jamie	but by the sound your update went bad do you multiple kernals to boot from
