2009-10-30T01:12:00.000Z	bradland		Hiya all :)
2009-10-30T01:12:00.000Z	bradland		I just read something I don't understand... imagine that
2009-10-30T01:13:00.000Z	bradland		"In either case, remember you don't need to assign (*and don't want to) an IP
2009-10-30T01:13:00.000Z	bradland		address to the monitoring interface"
2009-10-30T01:13:00.000Z	bradland		How does one "not assign" an IP to an interface?
2009-10-30T01:13:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	you dont want to use it?
2009-10-30T01:14:00.000Z	bradland	wsch	well, this is going to be used for nTop monitoring, so supposedly the interface should be A) in promiscuous mode, and B) not have an IP
2009-10-30T01:16:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	sorry no idea of that
2009-10-30T01:17:00.000Z	bradland	wsch	no problem. thanks for looking though :)
2009-10-30T01:17:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	something to wrrite in /etc/network/interfaces im guessing
2009-10-30T01:17:00.000Z	bradland	wsch	i think i found something
2009-10-30T01:17:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	please do share :p
2009-10-30T01:18:00.000Z	bradland	wsch	amazingly, this is the best documentation i've seen to date! haha
2009-10-30T01:18:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	yeah nice find, im gonna bookmark it
2009-10-30T01:19:00.000Z	bradland	wsch	if you've got a switch capable of mirroring traffic, you should definitely check out nTop. I picked up an old SMC TigerSwitch (managed switch) for $30 on eBay
2009-10-30T01:21:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	nice, i got a neat professional modem/router, maybe that can do things liek this
2009-10-30T01:21:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	a speedtouch 510 equivalent, its actually a flashed 510 :p
2009-10-30T01:21:00.000Z	bradland	wsch	mmmmm, good stuff
2009-10-30T01:22:00.000Z	wsch	bradland	it can give me TONS of details of my ADSL line, so if i call my ISP i probably know more about the line then the moron on the other side :D
