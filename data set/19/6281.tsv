2008-02-14T11:04:00.000Z	Syubi		where does the terminal program resides on a Ubuntu box?
2008-02-14T11:05:00.000Z	Syubi		ok, so perhaps i can use /usr/bin/gnome-terminal of another computer
2008-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	Syubi		I am machine C. I connected to machine B with SSH. I would like to use machine B to connect to machine A because they are on the same network.
2008-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	Syubi		I'm clicking on the gnome-terminal file but it's not working
2008-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	on A, sudo apt-get install ssh  (this will install sshd which listens for the connection from ssh)
2008-02-14T11:12:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	do you think it's
2008-02-14T11:14:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	If you can ssh from C to B, and you can ssh from B to A, yes...
2008-02-14T11:14:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	can you tell me how to do that, please ?
2008-02-14T11:17:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	I was doing this with the 'connect to server' window and i can only browse files that way..
2008-02-14T11:18:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	ahhh, ok. That's a little more complex then.
2008-02-14T11:18:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	Indeed.. I was clicking on gnome-terminal with no success.. hehe
2008-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	you can do tricks like 'tunneling' ports from one box to the next but it's a bit complex to describe
2008-02-14T11:21:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	what's the syntax for ssh ? I know the host name and my user name and my password.
2008-02-14T11:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	man ssh .. typically 'ssh user@host' or just 'ssh host' if you're using the same username on both
2008-02-14T11:23:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	ssh? it has roots in openbsd I think..
2008-02-14T11:35:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	Unfortunately it didn't work. It says the connection is refused. That machine has the latest Ubuntu server installed. Do you think I should install sshd on it?
2008-02-14T11:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	perhaps... if it's accessable from the internet you might want to be sure there are no weak passwords, or firewall out traffic to port22 from the general public
2008-02-14T11:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Syubi	but yes, to ssh to it it will need sshd running
2008-02-14T11:44:00.000Z	Syubi	zcat[1]	Thanks for everything. I'm logging off now. Bye.
