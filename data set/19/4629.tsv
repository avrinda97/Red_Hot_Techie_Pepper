2008-12-01T15:03:00.000Z	BlueEraser		Im having a bit of trouble, when i try to allow my proprietary driver to download and run that 8.10 has detedted, it wont allow it
2008-12-01T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlueEraser	are you using sudo / gksudo to run the app to get the driver?
2008-12-01T15:04:00.000Z	BlueEraser		well, its not that its not being allowed, its just not doing anything
2008-12-01T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlueEraser	you may need to configure your system to use whats downloaded
2008-12-01T15:05:00.000Z	BlueEraser	ActionParsnip	no, ubuntu detected it for me and told me which one it recommended, when it trys to download, nil
2008-12-01T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlueEraser	is this for nvidia drivers?

2008-12-01T15:17:00.000Z	BlueEraser	ActionParsnip	so by typing lspci | grep VGA it gave me a read out, and told me what i already knew, but was i acully telling the OS to look there for the card?
2008-12-01T15:18:00.000Z	BlueEraser		because after typing the command, the install went fine
2008-12-01T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		then i have no idea, you got the goal which is cool though :)
