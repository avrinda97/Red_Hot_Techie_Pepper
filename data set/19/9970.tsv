2006-09-02T11:55:00.000Z	burhan	linux__alien	is this the first time you are trying to install jabber?
2006-09-02T11:56:00.000Z	linux__alien	burhan	i installed a jabber server but couldnt configure it and couldnt test my client :-(
2006-09-02T11:56:00.000Z	burhan	linux__alien	perhaps it would be easier for you to go with a pre-packaged server? Something like Wildfire ( http://www.jivesoftware.org )
2006-09-02T11:57:00.000Z	linux__alien	burhan	Does it use the jabber protocol?
2006-09-02T11:57:00.000Z	burhan	linux__alien	of course :)
2006-09-02T11:57:00.000Z	linux__alien	burhan	will that involve lot of configuration stuff ?
2006-09-02T11:58:00.000Z	linux__alien	burhan	i get lost in the configuration stuff alone :-(
2006-09-02T11:58:00.000Z	burhan	linux__alien	its pretty much already setup -- comes with a gui and a web-based management tool that you can use to setup users, rooms, conferences, etc.
2006-09-02T11:58:00.000Z	burhan	linux__alien	browse the site to find out more.

2006-09-02T12:11:00.000Z	burhan	linux__alien	how are you compiling your software? Have you just tried to build it using gcc ?
