2012-05-20T00:03:00.000Z	pzn		I'm developing a gtk app to run in ubuntu, in a device with 800x480 screen size. I want to preview how it appearence will be. how can I set my notebook to have a 800x480 screen? this size is not available in the monitor configuration.
2012-05-20T00:04:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	why won't you just set the size of your window to 800x480?
2012-05-20T00:04:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	all app windows work in "fullscreen" mode
2012-05-20T00:05:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	but, when debugging, you can set them to that size, won't you?
2012-05-20T00:06:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	not so easy to do... fullscreen windows have different toolboxes/menus behaviour
2012-05-20T00:06:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	oh, i see
2012-05-20T00:07:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	if I install ubuntu inside a virtualbox, could I set the screensize to 800x480? does it make some difference between a real video card and a virtualbox video card?
2012-05-20T00:08:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	I'd check it, but I'm working now on the system without virtualbox, trying to isolate one nasty bug :)
2012-05-20T00:09:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	but you surely will have your program in full-screen mode
2012-05-20T00:09:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	while it will be in virtualbox window
2012-05-20T00:09:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	then I'll try it. thanks!
2012-05-20T00:09:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	you are welcome
2012-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	just out of curiosity, why the window must be exactly 800x480?
2012-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	do you plan to support another screen resolutions?
2012-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	because it is a touchscreen device... just 800x480 is available
2012-05-20T00:11:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	i mean, don't you plan to run it on different devices?
2012-05-20T00:12:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	no, it is a dedicated equipment for lab purposes. I just don't have it with me right now... on monday I can run on the real device. today I'll have to develop with my notebook only :-)
2012-05-20T00:12:00.000Z	milaz	pzn	i see :) good luck to you
2012-05-20T00:16:00.000Z	pzn	milaz	tks
