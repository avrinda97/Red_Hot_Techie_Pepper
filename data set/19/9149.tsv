2006-12-27T07:00:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	you need to get into single user mode and create the file anew
2006-12-27T07:05:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	recovery mode == single user mode
2006-12-27T07:06:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	its the recovery mode
2006-12-27T07:06:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	when you get to grub's menu .. press 'e' .. at the end type out 'single'
2006-12-27T07:08:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	you can't get a GUI there
2006-12-27T07:10:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	you'll need to mount the volume that has / on ..
2006-12-27T07:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	you don't type single at the terminal -- because you dont get one -- you modify grub's menu to get you into single-user mode -- and then you get to a root terminal
2006-12-27T07:13:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	once there, you mount / .. which is probably you /dev/hda2 .. mkdir /tmp/hda2; mount /dev/hda2/tmp
2006-12-27T07:14:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	 mkdir /tmp/hda2; mount /dev/hda2 /tmp/hda2
2006-12-27T07:15:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	once you have mounted / -- you need to chroot to it .. chroot /tmp/hda2
2006-12-27T07:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	once inside chroot -- edit sudoers -- vi /etc/sudoers
2006-12-27T07:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	well, then you need to recreate the file anew -- like this here -- http://pastebin.ca/293315
2006-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	i think you wanted -- http://pastebin.ca/293315
2006-12-27T07:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	can't you click on this link -->>  http://pastebin.ca/293315
2006-12-27T07:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	if you feel this is all a bit above your head -- you can always use a knoppix boot CD to aid you
2006-12-27T07:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	I think you had better use knoppix -- because you need the contents of http://pastebin.ca/293315 exactly as they are in /etc/sudoers otherwise you will still have the same problem
2006-12-27T07:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	you  boot up to the desktop in koppix, select the partition that represents / , properties -- change to "read/write" mode .. after, explore that partition, and open up the etc/sudoers file with the editor -- and then copy and paste  http://pastebin.ca/293315 into it, save the file, reboot, etc, etc
2006-12-27T07:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	I think knoppix uses kedit .. you can definitely find it in the knoppix menu
2006-12-27T07:53:00.000Z	un_operateur	emun	it's only difficult because of the number of steps -- but it's really easy otherwise :)
