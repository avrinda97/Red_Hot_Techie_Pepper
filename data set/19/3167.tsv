2009-10-12T09:32:00.000Z	grease		Hi .. have a n00b query ... I did a partial upgrade on my ubuntu system (9.10) ... was asked for a restart (which I did) .. but since then the system doesn't boot back ... I see a grub interface, but even the recovery mode says "could not mount filesystem"
2009-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	crypt-0	grease	that could be a problem
2009-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	crypt-0	grease	if you boot into a liveCD can you see your files?
2009-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	grease		I can .. but it seems my hard disk is password protected and it doesn't accept the (usual) password I gave .. also on using the command line at grub and "ls" I can see all my files .. so I think all my files are ok
2009-10-12T09:35:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	I don't think my hard disk is corrupted
2009-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	crypt-0	grease	password protetected, as in a password on grub, a password on the account or encryption?
2009-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	password on account
2009-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	crypt-0		grease can you get a root terminal and type cat /etc/fstab ?
2009-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	crypt-0		or boot a LiveCD
2009-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	trying .. just a sec
2009-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	crypt-0	grease	cat /etc/fstab >>>> paste it here http://pastebin.com
2009-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	crypt-0		brb
2009-10-12T09:41:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	I am logged here using a different computer .. how do I paste the contents of /etc/fstab to the website from the grub terminal ?
2009-10-12T09:53:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	http://pastebin.com/mdbcd46e
2009-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	u there?
2009-10-12T10:08:00.000Z	crypt-0	grease	sorry
2009-10-12T10:08:00.000Z	crypt-0		was afk for longer...than i expected
2009-10-12T10:09:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	no problem .. i pasted the /etc/fstab contents ( http://pastebin.com/mdbcd46e )
2009-10-12T10:10:00.000Z	grease	crypt-0	think the trouble is because the last few lines I had added (for VirtualBox) .. Is there a way to delete it from grub command line?
