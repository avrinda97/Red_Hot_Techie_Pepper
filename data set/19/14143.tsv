2004-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		to fstab
2004-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		oh OK
2004-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		that sounds cool
2004-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		wish debian did that
2004-11-01T13:30:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		how about firewire drives? formatted on a mac as a dos drive?
2004-11-01T13:30:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		but firefox is more popular
2004-11-01T13:31:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		like some plugin only works for firefox .8 and up
2004-11-01T13:32:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		dll?
2004-11-01T13:32:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		linux?
2004-11-01T13:32:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		anyway, how's ubuntu on firewire drives?
2004-11-01T13:32:00.000Z	pepsi_	KazeNoBokusha	my ipod works fine
2004-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha		i've heard an nforce2 board is problematic under linux, and i haven't tried firewire yet, so i'm worried
2004-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	pepsi_		cept its slow
2004-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	pepsi_	hmm
2004-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	pepsi_	any idea why?
2004-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	pepsi_	i don't want to transfer 10G of files slowly after all
2004-11-01T13:34:00.000Z	pepsi_		but as TheMuso just said, its probably because its mounted with an option to sync
2004-11-01T13:34:00.000Z	pepsi_		im going to try putting it in fstab
2004-11-01T13:34:00.000Z	KazeNoBokusha	pepsi_	do you have other firewire devices which aren't slow, or does sync make all fw drives slow?
