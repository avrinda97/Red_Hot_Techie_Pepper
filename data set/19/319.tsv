2012-05-13T09:08:00.000Z	Areckx	escott	 but it worked before i tried upgrading to 12.04, gnome
2012-05-13T08:45:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	then pipe it to less
2012-05-13T08:46:00.000Z	Areckx	escott	how do i do that I tried putting less in the command line
2012-05-13T08:46:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	setting up wireless from the cli is complex. if you already established a connection with network manager you might want to use nm-cli
2012-05-13T08:50:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	nmcli is intended only for enabling already established connection profiles
2012-05-13T09:01:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	because you have to associate the ssid, and then you have to do a wpa_supplicant protocol, and then you have to do your dhcp network setup
2012-05-13T09:02:00.000Z	Areckx	escott	 how so i do that?
2012-05-13T09:02:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	i've never done it. its too hard
2012-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	thats a kernel error. the driver may not be working for that wireless card. what chipset is it?
2012-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	Areckx	escott	dont know
2012-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	sudo lshw -C network
2012-05-19T06:38:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	"mount" will tell you want the mountpoint is
2012-06-18T06:47:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	just a gui assertion. not a big deal
2012-06-18T06:48:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	those come up ALL THE TIME with basically any gui program. its always surprised me that gui programs aren't constantly crashing, the layout engines must just be designed to deal with assertion failures
2012-07-23T06:13:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	why would you sudo ssh? (only reason i can think of is that you are using auth_keys and the private key is in /root/.ssh
2012-07-23T06:16:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	sudo ssh is a weird thing to do, because you (usually) care about the permissions on the remote side not on the local side. why do you care that root@localhost is sending commands to the other machine vs username@localhost. what matters is if root@remotehost is executing the commands or not
2012-07-23T06:24:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	well you can't ping it. so do you have the right ip?
2012-07-23T06:28:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	i don't really know. all i know about iProducts is that iDontBuyThem
2012-07-23T06:34:00.000Z	escott	Areckx	its the antithesis of free software
