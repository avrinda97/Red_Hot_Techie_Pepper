2006-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	rgg		hello,I downloaded an aMSN autopackage from...well,the amsn website.i changed the permissions and ran it,but i forgot to delete the old version of amsn from synaptic.so,it didn't install.then i deleted the old amsn and now it just won't run.
2006-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	rgg		nautilus is calling it a "script shell",i try to run it and it just doesn't,and when i run it on terminal,i get no "text" there,terminal opens and just closes right away.
