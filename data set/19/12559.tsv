2005-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	kestas		does anyone know where I should go for OS X shell scripting help?
2005-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	kestas	man bash
2005-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	Chousuke		;)
2005-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	kestas	Chousuke	OS X doesnt use bash
2005-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	Chousuke		yes it does.
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	kestas	Chousuke	and there are lots of fucked up differences, like sed -e 's/blah/\n/' does what you'd expect on linux/freebsd, but not on OS X
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	Chousuke		older versions may use tcsh but mine sure has bash.
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	Chousuke	kestas	sed is not a bash command
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	kestas	Chousuke	right well I said with bash scripting
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	Chousuke		sed is a separate tool. it has nothing to do with bash scripting
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	kestas	Chousuke	it includes all those posix tools
2005-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	Chousuke		not really.
2005-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	Chousuke		you can script those tools with any shell
2005-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	kestas	Chousuke	well thats a matter of opinion, but Ive never seen a bash script of any complexity which doesnt use sed
2005-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	kestas	so man sed
2005-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	Chousuke		and learn how the FreeBSD-based sed differs from GNU sed.
2005-12-19T14:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	kestas	basically OS X includes the same tools as most linux distros. just different implementations
2005-12-19T14:01:00.000Z	Chousuke		you can install gnu versions if you like.
2005-12-19T14:02:00.000Z	kestas	Chousuke	where can you get them?
