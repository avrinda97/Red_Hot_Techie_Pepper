2010-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	why not just use whatever's is the repositories, as the sun-java6-bin package?
2010-02-01T09:24:00.000Z	H4xor3d	nanotube	umm how?
2010-02-01T09:24:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	what version of ubuntu do you have?
2010-02-01T09:25:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	and do you want just the runtime, or also the jdk?
2010-02-01T09:26:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	then just run "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk"
2010-02-01T09:26:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	that will install the version from the ubuntu repos, which is 6-13-1... recent enough... :)
2010-02-01T09:26:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	more info: http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/sun-java6-jdk
2010-02-01T09:28:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	hrm that's strange - did you by any chance install some other java from somewhere else other than the ubuntu repos?
2010-02-01T09:29:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	because here on intrepid i'm getting "java version "1.6.0_14" and on karmic i'm getting "java version "1.6.0_15"  so if you have jaunty, you shouldn't be getting 1.6.0_0...
2010-02-01T09:29:00.000Z	H4xor3d	nanotube	umm ive tried to install manually from a .bin file dl'ed from java's website
2010-02-01T09:29:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	hrm well maybe if you undo whatever you did with your manual install... ?
2010-02-01T09:33:00.000Z	H4xor3d	nanotube	umm deleting files did not work because i do not have permission o.O
2010-02-01T09:34:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	well i don't really know what the sun java manual installer does... so i can't really tell you how to undo it...  generally, you could just delete the files with sudo - but you have to be careful to know precisely what you want to delete...
2010-02-01T09:36:00.000Z	H4xor3d	nanotube	well here's the website: https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewFilteredProducts-SingleVariationTypeFilter;pgid=yYdgaHqkkjVSR0EUPIQsoQ3D0000w5YpMzN9;sid=xJf6mjW75W36mX7dnpqyn9oSW2mc2fj-kXU1Wyilnk2-UQ==?DLWidget=true&AutoWidgetDL=
2010-02-01T09:40:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	that link seems to take me to a blank page... might these be the instructions you're following: http://java.com/en/download/help/5000010500.xml
2010-02-01T09:46:00.000Z	H4xor3d	nanotube	k thx! ill try this tomorrow as its getting late and need to sleep.....ill be back tomorrow if i still have questions
2010-02-01T09:46:00.000Z	nanotube	H4xor3d	good night ;)
