2009-01-14T16:51:00.000Z	th1		hi, if I want to use nvidia's driver (downloaded from their site)
2009-01-14T16:51:00.000Z	th1		instead of ubuntu's supplied one.. what should I do?
2009-01-14T16:52:00.000Z	th1		I want to avoid conflicts..
2009-01-14T16:52:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	why do you want to use the one from nvidia.com?
2009-01-14T16:52:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	because it has a fix to a problem Ihave with my card
2009-01-14T16:53:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	you can try use PPA's with the latest -180 driver in them
2009-01-14T16:53:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	how do I do that?
2009-01-14T16:53:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	its slightly safer then just getting them from nvidia.com
2009-01-14T16:53:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	one sec, finding the ppa :)
2009-01-14T16:54:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	fyi it's this fix I need: "Fixed a regression that could result in window decoration corruption when running Compiz using Geforce 6 and 7 series GPUs."
2009-01-14T16:55:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	https://launchpad.net/~thomas-creutz/+archive add that to your /etc/apt/sources.list and then do sudo apt-get update. After that you need to remove your current nvidia drivers with sudo apt-get remove nvidia-<whatevertheyare> and then do sudo apt-get install nvidia-180*
2009-01-14T16:59:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	I then get an error message saying: "E: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/metods/https could not be found."
2009-01-14T16:59:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	changed to http, worked
2009-01-14T17:00:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	err you did actually click on the link and get the deb and deb-src lines from there right?
2009-01-14T17:01:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	lol
2009-01-14T17:01:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	haha
2009-01-14T17:03:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	hmm, it says it's "180.18" and the one on nvidia's page is "180.22", I wonder if it will have the fix? probaby not?
2009-01-14T17:04:00.000Z	ziroday	th1	try .18 first
2009-01-14T17:09:00.000Z	th1	ziroday	thanks, it seems to have fixed the problem with the titlebars
