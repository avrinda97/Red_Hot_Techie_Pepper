2009-12-31T06:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	do you have a question?
2009-12-31T06:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	in kde.. mouse over the clock and a bar will slide out from the side.. click the "x"
2009-12-31T06:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	is this a widgit on the screen?
2009-12-31T06:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	can you move the clock around on the screen
2009-12-31T06:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	if you do short posts and several in a row .. the bot says you're flooding..
2009-12-31T06:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	where is the clock?
2009-12-31T06:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	k.. hang on and let me boot kubuntu in my VM
2009-12-31T06:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	also you should use the nick of the person you're talking to.. so it highlights.. type the first few characters then hit TAB to auto complete
2009-12-31T06:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	teage	8.10 is almost end of life... and a much earlier version of kde which may have some quirks.. you should upgrade to 9.04 then 9.10..
