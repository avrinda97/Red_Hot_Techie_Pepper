2010-06-27T00:06:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	well are you running sshd?
2010-06-27T00:06:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	yes
2010-06-27T00:08:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	guntbert , If I try user@ip in my machine I can connect, but if I try from outside the LAN it times out.
2010-06-27T00:11:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	it could be the cable modem, it could be the isp, it could be the other computer you're trying to SSH from... can you try to SSH within your lan?
2010-06-27T00:48:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	just check the cable modem settings
2010-06-27T00:49:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	How, could you guide me .?
2010-06-27T00:50:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	I tryed to read modem user guide, but there was no information about ports blocked ...
2010-06-27T00:51:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	so can you connect to the ssh server if it's running on port 1022, for example? ... have you checked netstat -lpn | grep ":22" to see what it's listening on?
2010-06-27T00:52:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	I've seen SSH listening on 127.0.0.1 only, at least once, that blocked outside access
2010-06-27T00:52:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	I tryed 2222 yesterday, and the same hapened
2010-06-27T00:53:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	you ignored the second part of that line
2010-06-27T00:55:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	I get http://pastebin.com/D3AKAssd
2010-06-27T00:55:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	ok, so that's not the problem then
2010-06-27T00:56:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	did you check iptables already?
2010-06-27T00:56:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	If a try nmap my-ip i see ssh listening on port 22, but if you try , you won't see it.
2010-06-27T00:58:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	Some people checked it, I have no experience with it, but if you want to make sure : http://pastebin.com/gLBSSf3c
2010-06-27T00:58:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	thats the output of iptables -L
2010-06-27T01:00:00.000Z	lietu	zimbres	hmmm... well my next to steps would be to check the cable modem settings, and then ask the ISP for ideas
2010-06-27T01:04:00.000Z	zimbres	lietu	thanks you .
