2005-12-07T13:12:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	sound like it is almost reading it raw!
2005-12-07T13:12:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	+ starts most raw messages.
2005-12-07T13:13:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	any idea what might be causing it?
2005-12-07T13:14:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	N oidea.
2005-12-07T13:16:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	suppose its time to reconnect then, eh?
2005-12-07T13:16:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	Perhaps.
2005-12-07T13:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	how is it?
2005-12-07T13:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	Standard 5.10 XChat?
2005-12-07T13:23:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	hm?
2005-12-07T13:29:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	apparently, its not raw, but rather something called "CAPAB IDENTIFY-MSG"
2005-12-07T13:29:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	how did you fix it?
2005-12-07T13:30:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	no clue. :P
2005-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	nah, i'm still getting stuff in the same way.
2005-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	qt2	Very odd. Normal Ubuntu XChat?
2005-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	yep, apparently xcaht added support for hte feature that freenode came uo with back in 2.4.0
2005-12-07T13:36:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	thing is, i dont know how it got turned on, and i dont know how to turn it off.
2005-12-07T13:36:00.000Z	qt2	Fujitsu	basically, this thing puts a + beside the line of text if a nick is regged, and a - if it isn't.
