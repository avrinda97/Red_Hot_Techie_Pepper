2009-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	tristanmike		Hi all :) I have a question that I would appreciate some help on. I have an ASUS A7N8X-Deluxe Motherboard. I have just purchased a new SATA drive (640GB) and I would like Ubuntu to see it. I've tried the command "sudo lshw -C disk" however it is not listed, which I suppose means it's not seen in the BIOS. The product page says it supports Serial ATA but the manual only describes the Windows installation, any help would be ap

2009-07-02T23:10:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	wait so does the bios see it?
2009-07-02T23:10:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	have you checked?
2009-07-02T23:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	te_, upon boot, doesn't detect SATA, just my IDE and two ROMs (IDE)... in the BIOS, it doesn't appear that they have their own section, in the same way the IDE drives do
2009-07-02T23:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	te_, It should be noted that I currently have an 80GB IDE drive which Ubuntu currently resides
2009-07-02T23:17:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	well it's not an ubuntu problem. master slave won't matter since it's sata...
2009-07-02T23:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	right, it's more of a "how do I get Ubuntu to see it" kinda thing
2009-07-02T23:18:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	you've gone into the bios settings right? not just looking at the post results?
2009-07-02T23:18:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	your bios can't see it, so clearly ubuntu can't
2009-07-02T23:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	yes, but it's not listed in the same way IDE is... that is to say, on the main BIOS screen
2009-07-02T23:19:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	well, do you know the drive is spinning up? working? plugged in? does your mobo support it? etc.
2009-07-02T23:20:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	live cd's can't help
2009-07-02T23:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	http://www.asus.com/Product.aspx?P_ID=wAsRYm41KTp78MFC  -- says it supports it
2009-07-02T23:22:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	plugged in, check
2009-07-02T23:22:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	working - well, I'm not quite sure as the BIOS doesn't recognize it.... te_, I'll see what happens when I boot the live CD see ya in a bit. :D
2009-07-02T23:46:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	woo!
2009-07-02T23:46:00.000Z	derenrich	tristanmike	I knew you could do it!
2009-07-02T23:46:00.000Z	tristanmike	derenrich	Not without you all to push me a little further :D
