2005-02-08T12:23:00.000Z	rob__		hey how do you make a dirrect copy of a cd in nautilous? is it possible?
2005-02-08T12:25:00.000Z	rob__		thrshbarg: its not possible in nautilous?  does this work from one cdrom to another?
2005-02-08T12:26:00.000Z	kent	rob__	try using k3b, perhaps it can do that?
2005-02-08T12:27:00.000Z	rob__	kent	thanks but KDE wont install on my sistem, (Broken packages or some such weird error), thus I can install it even if I wanted to  (which i really dont care about KDE in the first place)
2005-02-08T12:28:00.000Z	rob__	kent	k3b is an excelent program though and most certainatly can do that
2005-02-08T12:29:00.000Z	kent	rob__	are you running Hoary (the unstable branch)? if so, try graveman. It seems like it can duplicate cd's and such things..
2005-02-08T12:30:00.000Z	kent	rob__	then graveman can duplicate from cd to iso. i just checked now.
2005-02-08T12:31:00.000Z	kent	rob__	although it might be so that it has to be run as root (gksudo), becaus it dont want to see my cd-rw when i run it as a normal user..
2005-02-08T12:31:00.000Z	kent	rob__	graveman is installable from universe in Hoary i think, that must be where i got it ;)
2005-02-08T12:31:00.000Z	rob__	kent	thanks I am installing it now
2005-02-08T12:34:00.000Z	kent	rob__	to copy a singla data-session from a cd to an iso should be working yes. But i guess its more complicated for cd's with other stuff on them, such as audio, etc.
2005-02-08T12:35:00.000Z	rob__	kent	thats the idea
2005-02-08T12:36:00.000Z	kent	rob__	some way of just selecting the cd-drive in the Computer folder, and be able to choose "copy to iso", or such would be cool.
2005-02-08T12:41:00.000Z	kent	rob__	what do you meen?
2005-02-08T12:42:00.000Z	kent	rob__	try starting it from a terminal and see if it complains about something. (i know it feels kind of stupid to do such things.. but it can help others,)
2005-02-08T12:52:00.000Z	kent	rob__	so graveman works for you now? it still dont see my cd-rw :(  and i tried starting it with sudo.
2005-02-08T12:53:00.000Z	rob__	kent	bummer, does gnome see your cdroms in the Device Manger?
2005-02-08T12:54:00.000Z	kent	rob__	gnome finds my device. its just graveman. Perhaps something with the atapi-thing.
2005-02-08T12:56:00.000Z	rob__	kent	atapi? perhaps. i have to use the scsi simulator in K3B usually and but this one gave me no problems about it
