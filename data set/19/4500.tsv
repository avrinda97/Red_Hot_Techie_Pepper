2009-01-03T23:17:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	rgnr	on the place "lib" was
2009-01-03T23:18:00.000Z	rgnr	abuyusuf_	 the lib is there still
2009-01-03T23:18:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	rgnr	So what is the problem if it still there ?
2009-01-03T23:18:00.000Z	rgnr	abuyusuf_	 i just wanna uncopy files from lib from lib32
2009-01-03T23:19:00.000Z	rgnr	abuyusuf_	 cuz it makes me problems
2009-01-03T23:19:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	rgnr	Now, you copied some files from lib32 to lib, and want to del the copied one from lib ?

2009-01-03T23:21:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	rgnr	So, just see which files in lib32 from lib and del them !, did you face a problem in that ?
