2005-03-10T14:36:00.000Z	Libby		login apears normally and i typed my password into the login box to check it
2005-03-10T14:36:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	i had that problem too
2005-03-10T14:36:00.000Z	Libby	fgubuntu	how did you slove it?
2005-03-10T14:37:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	i didn't. it seems a problem with locales and keyboard at install time. when i made italian install i had the prob, when i made english i didn't
2005-03-10T14:38:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	i think that happens something like this:
2005-03-10T14:39:00.000Z	Libby	fgubuntu	did you manage to change your keyboardsettings afterwards?
2005-03-10T14:40:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	you can do it after install
2005-03-10T15:02:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	tell me
2005-03-10T15:03:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	it could be that
2005-03-10T15:04:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	but i hade same prob using regular letters ( not capital )
2005-03-10T15:05:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	i think that when you type pass the keyboard is still set to english the you reboot you got a dutch keyboard with "english pass", but this is only my opinion, i could be wrong
2005-03-10T15:06:00.000Z	Libby	fgubuntu	could still be that too
2005-03-10T15:06:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	ok.
2005-03-10T16:56:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	what about pass
2005-03-10T16:57:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	keyboard locale
2005-03-10T16:58:00.000Z	Libby	fgubuntu	i'm affraid i need a little more info here :-)
2005-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	fgubuntu	Libby	afraid? for what?
