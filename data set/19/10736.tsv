2006-05-23T16:45:00.000Z	Tonren		hey guys, how do I update a package that I've already installed?  amaroK 1.4 just came out .
2006-05-23T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	either find an unofficial deb, or build it from source
2006-05-23T16:47:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	 There's no like... apt-get update or something?
2006-05-23T16:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	no. ubuntu is a 'stable' distro, and does not promise to run the latest & greatest.
2006-05-23T16:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	but don't count on it. But, someone will create an unofficial deb if ubuntu doesn't.
2007-12-27T22:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	sorry, but you will probably have troubles finding someone here to troubleshoot that, the ubuntu drivers get support here
2007-12-31T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	most of the kde enabled people hang out in #kubuntu
2007-12-31T09:27:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	It seems like a kernel issue, rather than a KDE issue.  But I will ask in #kubuntu too.
2007-12-31T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	does it happen in gnome?
2007-12-31T09:28:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	I haven't tested it.  I have no way to reproduce it, and I do all my work in KDE, so I haven't installed GNOME.
2007-12-31T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	ok. it could be that you found the kde related stuff simply by chance, or because you're gnome deprived. I just noticed that all your info was kde related
2008-02-09T04:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	it's simply telling you the technique it's using to access the usb.
2008-02-09T04:22:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	fyrestrtr : Well, first off, it's not actually mounting anything.  Second off, why does it need SCSI?  SCSI is older than the hills.
2008-02-09T04:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	why it's not mounting is another question, but what's wrong with scsi ?
2008-02-09T04:23:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	fyrestrtr: Well, fair enough.  I was under the impression that SCSI was just a deprecated standard.  But if it's supposed to work, sure.  Now, howcome it isn't mounting?
2008-02-09T04:24:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	fyrestrtr : When I manually mount it, it works fine.  It doesn't seem to be able to mount it automatically, though.
2008-02-10T03:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	you did mk2fs.ext3 /dev/<device> ?
2008-02-10T03:47:00.000Z	Tonren	nickrud	I formatted it to ext3 using gparted.
2008-02-10T03:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Tonren	I don't know anything about how kde does automounting
