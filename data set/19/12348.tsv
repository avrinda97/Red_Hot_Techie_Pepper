2005-10-13T15:42:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	the opensource driver works fine, but needed to install the one from ati in order to connect to a monitor using the digital port
2005-10-13T15:43:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	ATI Technologies Inc RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10] 
2005-10-13T15:43:00.000Z	qmanman	El_Che	sound and everything else runs fine?
2005-10-13T15:45:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	yep, but sound is not from ati
2005-10-13T15:45:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	every single piece of this laptop works, except a weird sd-card reader
2005-10-13T15:46:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	it's a hp (there a special custom cd's from ubuntu)
2005-10-13T15:46:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	on the other hand, the same was true (working) for my former laptop, an ibm thinkpad t23
2005-10-13T15:47:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	i had beter experience with the ati driver from ati (they have an gui installer) than the one in the ubuntu repository
2005-10-13T15:48:00.000Z	qmanman	El_Che	yeah thats what the forums seem to tell me
2005-10-13T15:48:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	ah, ok, didn't know that
2005-10-13T15:49:00.000Z	qmanman	El_Che	this one I'm looking at is pretty much all ATI based.......
2005-10-13T15:50:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	are you buying online?
2005-10-13T15:50:00.000Z	El_Che	qmanman	otherwise, a live-cd will tell you a lot
2005-10-13T15:50:00.000Z	qmanman	El_Che	yeah I think I'm getting it from newegg
2005-10-13T15:51:00.000Z	qmanman	El_Che	I think COMPUSE has acer, going to see if they have it
