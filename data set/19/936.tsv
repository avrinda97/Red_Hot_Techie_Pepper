2012-03-22T12:13:00.000Z	ejv		hi guys, my new user isn't being asked for a password when I sudo, i'm in the sudo group... ideas?
2012-03-22T12:14:00.000Z	ejv		is it too close to the initial login, so it's caching my pass? i thought sudo would still ask...
2012-03-22T12:15:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	you mean not requiring password when you sudo su - <login> ?
2012-03-22T12:33:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	true, sorry
2012-03-22T12:39:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	he's using VMware in a windows 7 host and Ubuntu client vm. He wants his SD-card to be (auto-monted) in Ubuntu
2012-03-22T12:42:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	you can't move trees using mv either ejv
2012-03-22T12:42:00.000Z	ejv	MestreLion	clarify
2012-03-22T12:43:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	mv some/very/long/path/to/file anotherdir  will not work
2012-03-22T12:44:00.000Z	ejv	MestreLion	yes you can, I do it all the time. what version of the GNU toolchain are you using? lol
2012-03-22T12:45:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	will it mv file to anotherdir/file or anotherdir/very/long/path/to/file  ?
2012-03-22T12:46:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	he didn't, you can still see the command evocation
2012-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	nope... just the output itself
2012-03-22T12:51:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	i'm trying lshw here... but it does not map controllers to the assigned /dev/sdX devices
2012-03-22T13:00:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	we are not even sure if vmware is properly exposing the card, or HOW it is doing so
2012-03-22T13:02:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	ohs: SD cards are pretty standard, regardless of manufacturer... it's all about the card READER, which are usually USB/PCI internally
2012-03-22T13:03:00.000Z	ejv	MestreLion	right, didn't see that
2012-03-22T13:08:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	i rase to 20 ;)
2012-03-22T13:09:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	nope, i'm a big fan of VirtualBox... never used vmware before
2012-03-22T13:09:00.000Z	MestreLion	ejv	and not willing to since it looks so painful to set up ;)
