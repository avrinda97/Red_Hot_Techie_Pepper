2006-01-07T15:14:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	why is it so difficult to install to a usb drive?
2006-01-07T15:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	I have no idea.  I've been told other distros' live CDs can do it, but not this one.
2006-01-08T17:51:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	you don't... windows doesn't have such concepts
2006-01-08T17:51:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	you can format the disk with a linux filesystem like ext3 and it will remember the owner and permissions you set... but windows won't read it at all
2006-01-08T17:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	What if the Windows box had the ext2/3 driver?
2006-01-08T06:00:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	then windows would be able to read the disk just fine
2006-01-10T09:54:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	my guess is a compressed image file of the main partition as it was shipped from the factory
2006-01-10T09:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	Sounds plausible.  And would explain why they're large files.
2006-01-15T16:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	What exactly does the journal bit mean anyway?  Never really understood that.
2006-01-15T16:33:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	it's a scratch place for the kernel to make note about important changes it is about to make, so that if it doesn't get to finish making those changes, it knows about it when it boots up again adn can either finish the changes, or undo them... so the change either gets all done, or not done at all
2006-01-15T16:36:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	the net result is certain operations are slowed down a bit ( because more data has to be written to the disk, once to the journal, and once to the real location ) but if the system crashes, you don't end up with a damaged filesystem
2006-01-15T16:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	Sounds like a worthwhile sacrifice to me.
2006-01-15T16:38:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	I can't wait for the reiser4 filesystem to get merged into the stock kernel... it uses a wandering journal so it gets the benefits without the slowdown.. looks really cool
2006-01-20T11:18:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	"the live cd is not going to break your computer or destroy your data" usually works well
2006-01-20T11:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	They don't believe me.
2006-01-20T11:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	They don't understand why not.
2006-01-20T11:20:00.000Z	psusi	tonyyarusso	"because it doesn't touch your hard drive, it runs entirely off the cd"
2006-12-09T08:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	defrag package?  I thought we didn't need defragging?
2006-12-09T08:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	psusi	Second option iirc, yes (for shrinking hda1)
