2011-07-28T15:47:00.000Z	Antonis		Hello. I have installed ubuntu 10.10 on my netbook but have a problem with wifi. I am able to see wifi networks and also connect to them. in fact I have connected to my wifi at home but while it says that I am connected and everything seems to be ok I am not able to browse the web or update or do anything that needs an internet connection
2011-07-28T15:49:00.000Z	Antonis		Could someone pls help me solve this problem?
2011-07-28T15:49:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	pastebin output of "ip addr" and "ip route"
2011-07-28T15:54:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	just a sec
2011-07-28T15:56:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	http://paste.ubuntu.com/653739/ and http://paste.ubuntu.com/653741/
2011-07-28T15:57:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	you have addresses on two different interfaces on the same subnet. why?
2011-07-28T16:00:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	I don't understand what you mean. I have no idea why :\
2011-07-28T16:00:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	do you have a wired connection and a wireless connection to the same network at once? what are the interfaces eth0 and eth1?
2011-07-28T16:01:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	yes eth0 would be the ethernet which I am connected to cause eth1 which is the wifi won't work
2011-07-28T16:01:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	you don't have a default route on the eth1
2011-07-28T16:02:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	which means?
2011-07-28T16:03:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	your computer doesn't know where to send the data for things that are not on your network
2011-07-28T16:03:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	how did you configure the ip address on your wireless interface?
2011-07-28T16:04:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	I didn't I just installed ubuntu 10.10 and then added the drivers from the hardware tool up on the panel. I rebooted and found my network on the wifi list and just connected
2011-07-28T16:05:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	try disconnecting your wired network and doing "ping 192.168.1.1" to see if your wireless is really connected and you can get to your router
2011-07-28T16:08:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	destination host unreachable
2011-07-28T16:08:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	right, then you are not really connected to your wifi network
2011-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	ne2k	Antonis	is the wifi network one and the same as the wired network?
2011-07-28T16:12:00.000Z	Antonis	ne2k	yes
