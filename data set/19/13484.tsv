2005-07-05T11:46:00.000Z	LeaChim		what does this error message mean? - Value too large for defined data type
2005-07-05T11:47:00.000Z	LeaChim		i'm only trying to copy a 40meg file
2005-07-05T11:47:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	how..?
2005-07-05T11:47:00.000Z	LeaChim	Seveas	cp
2005-07-05T11:47:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	hmm...
2005-07-05T11:49:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	thats odd at least, is that the complete error?
2005-07-05T11:51:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	try mv instead of cp (it won't delete it since ntfs is read only)
2005-07-05T11:53:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	and if you cd into the folder that contains the file?
2005-07-05T11:56:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	no f*ing clue :|
2005-07-05T11:56:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	can you please ask on #ubuntu-devel or ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com, this looks like a really odd bug...
2005-07-05T11:57:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	does it immediately say it or after copying a part of it?
2005-07-05T12:46:00.000Z	LeaChim	Seveas	fyi
2005-07-05T12:47:00.000Z	LeaChim	Seveas	i copied the files by scp'ing them from windows to my other *nix box - and then back in ubuntu copying them back
2005-09-12T14:30:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	breezy
2005-09-12T14:32:00.000Z	LeaChim	Seveas	when's breezy supposed to be out? :P
2005-09-27T10:07:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	apt-get install --reinstall vim-common :)
2005-09-27T10:08:00.000Z	LeaChim	Seveas	i haven't got apt installed during the install, have i :/
2005-09-27T10:08:00.000Z	Seveas	LeaChim	of course you have otherwise you installed a different distro
