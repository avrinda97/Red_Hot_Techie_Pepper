2010-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	newbee		how do you list directories ?
2010-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	newbee		ls is listing the files
2010-10-28T19:35:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	ls -d
2010-10-28T19:36:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	Ya coz you have only that directory
2010-10-28T19:37:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	It's showing you directories that are under / (root)
2010-10-28T19:37:00.000Z	newbee	Krishnandu	true
2010-10-28T19:37:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	And BTW ls does shows you directories. The blue coloured ones are dirs
2010-10-28T19:38:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	simple ls shows you dir. Dir are in blue colour
2010-10-28T19:39:00.000Z	newbee	Krishnandu	^^
2010-10-28T19:39:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	You don't have any directories there
2010-10-28T19:39:00.000Z	newbee	Krishnandu	how does cd /usr work then ?
2010-10-28T19:39:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	cd = change directory
2010-10-28T19:40:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	do cd / and then use ls, you'll see the directories
2010-10-28T19:40:00.000Z	newbee	Krishnandu	^^
2010-10-28T19:40:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	in linux / is root directory, so cd /etc means etc in / (root) dir
2010-10-28T19:41:00.000Z	newbee	Krishnandu	what was root@server01:~# ?
2010-10-28T19:41:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	You were in your home directory
2010-10-28T19:41:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	~ identifies your home dir
2010-10-28T19:41:00.000Z	Krishnandu	newbee	do cd ~ and you'll understand it
