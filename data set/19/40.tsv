2012-11-16T03:49:00.000Z	mrwhistler		Hi. how can I prevent a user from changing his/her password?
2012-11-16T03:49:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	change it to something he doesn't know
2012-11-16T03:49:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	remove the passwd utility or mark it as non-suid
2012-11-16T03:49:00.000Z	mrwhistler	escott	and just allow automatic login?
2012-11-16T03:51:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	it seems a weird thing to be doing, and isn't entirely supported. why do you want to do this?
2012-11-16T03:52:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	so what you SHOULD be doing is regenerating that account every time they logout
2012-11-16T03:52:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	otherwise one malicious user can leave a "userkit" behind to steal the next users passwords or files
2012-11-16T03:53:00.000Z	mrwhistler	escott	how does one control that, is there some folder that i can put scripts in that are executed on logout?
2012-11-16T03:53:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	various ways... if the machine is sitting out in the open (ie no physical control) you need to configure a pxe boot, and just set the thing up to reboot on logout
2012-11-16T03:54:00.000Z	mrwhistler	escott	it will be a VM on a windows box
2012-11-16T03:54:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	b/c with physical access they can get root and leave rootkits behind. otherwise I could just install a firefox plugin to the user profile and have that plugin send me their passwords
2012-11-16T03:55:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	then that is very easy. configure the VM server to clone the image before starting it, and then destroy the image on shutdown
2012-11-16T03:55:00.000Z	mrwhistler	escott	wonder if that is possible on vmware player
2012-11-16T03:56:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	i dont know. keep in mind if they have physical access to the machine then they have control (no matter what OS is running)
2012-11-16T03:57:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	so im not sure how windows is secured here, but if you could secure against access to the host OS and just need to secure the VM image you can do lots of stuff. store a pristine copy remotely and swap it out between sessions
2012-11-16T03:57:00.000Z	mrwhistler	escott	i think that is the tree to bark up
2012-11-16T03:58:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	enterprise vms certainly have what dr_willis is talking about (COW and all) but probably not vmware player. vmware player probably just supports a full clone when the guest is off
2012-11-16T03:59:00.000Z	escott	mrwhistler	"deploy" sounds like what you want
2012-11-16T04:00:00.000Z	mrwhistler	escott	hell yea
