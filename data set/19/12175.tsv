2007-05-14T11:42:00.000Z	jrr		in my experience, 64 linux is less fun
2007-05-14T11:42:00.000Z	jrr	fluvvell	HD. high-def.
2007-05-14T11:43:00.000Z	fluvvell	jrr	oh no no, not at this stage.  Maybe in the future, but upgrading from edgy killed my backend so I've got to fix it first.
2007-05-14T11:43:00.000Z	jrr		when going linux 64, be preared to lose most proprietery binary support (flash plugin, etc) excepting nvidia, as they don't suck
