2012-07-05T09:06:00.000Z	johnnycakes		New install of 12.04, everything works great EXCEPT I can't click in the top-right corner of any maximized app... clicks seem to go straight through to the desktop.
2012-07-05T09:06:00.000Z	johnnycakes		the little Close icon is there, but only about the left-most 3 pixels actually respond to a click.. everything else goes down to the desktop (if I right-click on the Close button then the desktop's right-click menu pops up)
2012-07-05T09:07:00.000Z	johnnycakes		Anyone have any experience with that issue?
2012-07-05T09:07:00.000Z	jthan	johnnycakes	Not something I have ever heard of or experienced.  Did you check the forums out?
2012-07-05T09:08:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	yup
2012-07-05T09:08:00.000Z	jthan	johnnycakes	Alright. Give me a second.
2012-07-05T09:08:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	making a new account to post on ubuntuforums.org with (since my old account doesn't seem to work anymore)

2012-07-05T09:10:00.000Z	jthan	johnnycakes	Go through this testcase and see if it applies please https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/880449
2012-07-05T09:11:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	193985 seems different than my issue (and is also unresolved hehe) but will check out 880449
2012-07-05T09:12:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	880449 is related to the same thing as 193985... thanks for tryin tho :D
2012-07-05T09:13:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	my click-through problem is consistent, with every single window I maximize, regardless of whether anything has been minimized or not
2012-07-05T09:13:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	also it's only a small square in the top-right corner that covers most of the close button
2012-07-05T09:14:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	the menu bar (including the close button) work fine, but only the left-most part of the close button is clickable (when not maxed the whole close button works)
2012-07-05T09:15:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	it's like there's a little 10x10px box floating in the top-right corner that's sending all clicks straight through to the desktop
2012-07-05T09:16:00.000Z	jthan	johnnycakes	Yeah - I understand your description. Just don't know how to search for it anywhere.  You are best to open up a forum post and maybe even file a bug if you can't find a resolution. Make sure to include your hardware specifics.
2012-07-05T09:16:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	yeah that's about the same conclusion I've reached... was hoping it was common enough that an IRC person might recognize it, despite it being a hard thing to google for
2012-07-05T09:17:00.000Z	johnnycakes	jthan	thanks anyway :)
2012-07-05T09:17:00.000Z	jthan	johnnycakes	Certainly. Sorry I couldn't do more.
