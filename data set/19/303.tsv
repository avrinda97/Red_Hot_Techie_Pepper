2012-05-12T21:40:00.000Z	_Tristan		I have to remove a package and then reinstall a newer version with .debs. How can I remove the package without removing it's dependencies?
2012-05-12T21:40:00.000Z	_Tristan		or at least, without having to reconfigure them if I have to reinstall them?
2012-05-12T21:41:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	did you try just installing it?
2012-05-12T21:41:00.000Z	_Tristan		the .deb packages?
2012-05-12T21:41:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	yes
2012-05-12T21:41:00.000Z	_Tristan	krababbel	for some reason the whole thing needs to be done in a very specific order... here's what I'm doing http://blog.siansiew.com/2011/08/30/installing-mysql-5-5-on-ubuntu-11-04-natty/
2012-05-12T21:43:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	did you try just doing the command he posted?
2012-05-12T21:43:00.000Z	_Tristan		it'll remove php5-mysql, sphinxsearch, phpmyadmin, and some other things which I need
2012-05-12T21:43:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	you can more easily track package dependecies in aptitude
2012-05-12T21:44:00.000Z	_Tristan	krababbel	I know, I'm just not sure how I can prevent it from uninstalling certain things as part of the resolution
2012-05-12T21:45:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	so you want to remove packages withou installing them back anymore, and expect other packages which depend on the first, to work? I doubt it will work, a package will need a depency to work.
2012-05-12T21:46:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	you can hold packages in aptitude
2012-05-12T21:46:00.000Z	_Tristan	krababbel	I'm going to remove mysql with aptitude, then install it with dpkg
2012-05-12T21:46:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	so just remember those which got removed and you still want. :) install them again afterwards
2012-05-12T21:47:00.000Z	_Tristan		won't their data be removed as well? or no?
2012-05-12T21:48:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	nothing user configurable, though I don't know mysql installation.
2012-05-12T21:48:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	you can see in b
2012-05-12T21:48:00.000Z	_Tristan		b?
2012-05-12T21:49:00.000Z	krababbel	_Tristan	dpkg should be able to list all files of a package, but user config shouldn't be a problem, just backup it for good measure.
