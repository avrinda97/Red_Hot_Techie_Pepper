2011-12-02T18:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	goldenboy87	 you have a live cd handy?
2011-12-02T18:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	goldenboy87	 so this is now a new install that seems to have a failed grub
2011-12-02T18:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	goldenboy87	 depends on how you did the install.
2011-12-02T18:11:00.000Z	goldenboy87	dr_willis	i didn't install it, i did everything til the step, where to chose the disk
2011-12-02T18:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	goldenboy87	 see what partitions and disks  'sudo fdisk -l' show from the live cd.
2011-12-02T18:16:00.000Z	goldenboy87	dr_willis	i get only /dev/sdb1
2011-12-02T18:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	goldenboy87	 you may want to pastebin the output of 'sudo fdisk -l' for the channel to see.  Was there anything on you rlinux install you wanted to recover?
2011-12-02T18:23:00.000Z	goldenboy87	dr_willis	i would like to know how could it happen, that my ubuntu installation just gone
