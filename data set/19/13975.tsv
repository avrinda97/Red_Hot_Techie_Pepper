2004-11-27T10:35:00.000Z	eclipse		The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2004-11-27T10:35:00.000Z	eclipse		  kdebase: Depends: kcontrol (>= 4:3.2.2-1ubuntu2) but it is not installable
2004-11-27T10:35:00.000Z	eclipse		  konqueror: Depends: kcontrol but it is not installable
2004-11-27T10:36:00.000Z	eclipse		see, i guess i can't install kde in my system
2004-11-27T10:36:00.000Z	eclipse		but it won't let me install kcontrol
2004-11-27T10:36:00.000Z	fubarpa	eclipse	I installed KDE without an issue
2004-11-27T10:37:00.000Z	eclipse	fubarpa	how did u do it?
2004-11-27T10:38:00.000Z	eclipse	fubarpa	can u tell me the command that u typed?
2004-11-27T10:40:00.000Z	fubarpa	eclipse	uncomment the Universe repository, then apt-get install kde
2004-11-27T10:42:00.000Z	eclipse	fubarpa	after that what is the command to install kde?
2004-11-27T10:44:00.000Z	eclipse	fubarpa	r u running warty or hoary?
2004-11-27T10:46:00.000Z	fubarpa	eclipse	after you enable the universe repository, you need to do a sudo apt-get update
2004-11-27T10:47:00.000Z	fubarpa	eclipse	no, you need ot enable it
2004-11-27T10:51:00.000Z	fubarpa	eclipse	yeah, that is kinda odd
