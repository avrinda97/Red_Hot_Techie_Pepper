2011-01-31T07:28:00.000Z	species	ActionParsnip	i dont think thats going to help; he wants to get the rest of his 2tb hdd
2011-01-31T07:28:00.000Z	species	ActionParsnip	df indicates its mounting properly so the question is, why cant he access it all
2011-01-31T07:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	true but it helps
2011-01-31T07:29:00.000Z	species	ActionParsnip	120mb isnt worth a sneeze these days
2011-01-31T07:29:00.000Z	species	ActionParsnip	dude... thats not his main concern right now
2011-01-31T07:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	if you have a netbook with 4Gb then it is, or installed to an SD card etc
2011-01-31T07:30:00.000Z	species	ActionParsnip	but those scenarios dont apply here
2011-01-31T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	true, but it can be a significant lump of data
2011-01-31T07:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	notice how I'm addressing both issues....
2012-03-27T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	+1

2012-03-27T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	its gnome3, the next version. The shell has changed from gnome-panel to Unity
2012-03-27T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	gnome is the DE, Compiz is the WM
2012-03-27T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	omgubuntu has a how to for making the current Gnome look like Gnome2, if you want an easier way just use xfce
2012-03-27T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	install xfce4 and log off, then log into xfce
2012-03-27T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	look in power options and screen saver options. Its all there
2012-03-27T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	species	just because you can't find something doesn't mean its not there
2012-03-27T05:16:00.000Z	species	ActionParsnip	next question, how can I make the [MASSIVE ICONS] in unity smaller?
