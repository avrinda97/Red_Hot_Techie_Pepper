2007-08-16T11:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	Davy_Jones	fusion is an extension of compiz. And ask in #ubuntu-effects please
2007-09-24T15:23:00.000Z	PriceChild	Davy_Jones	how did you turn it off?
2007-09-24T15:23:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	PriceChild	i didn't.. i ran firefox as root and youtube tells me i either don't have flashplayer or have javascript turned off

2007-09-24T15:27:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	PriceChild	i know what root is, i know it's dangerous to run stuff as root, i know you want to call me stupid for doing so.. can i do this?
2007-09-24T15:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	Davy_Jones	what are you really trying to achieve by running root?
