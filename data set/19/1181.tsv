2011-05-30T03:02:00.000Z	LAcan		I'm trying to delete a directory but ubuntu keeps telling me its not empty, despite the fact that there are no files in it. From the CLI i do an "ls -aR" and it lists sub directories, but also "Input/output error". Any fix?
2011-05-30T03:03:00.000Z	lsv	LAcan	sudo rm -fr dirname
2011-05-30T03:04:00.000Z	LAcan	lsv	doesnt work "Directory not empty"
2011-05-30T03:07:00.000Z	lsv	LAcan	type this ' cd && mv path-to-folder path-to-folder-new && sudo rm -rf path-to-folder '
2011-05-30T03:08:00.000Z	lsv	LAcan	what i mean is, make sure you're not in the directory you're deleting, rename folder, then remove the folder
2011-05-30T03:09:00.000Z	LAcan	lsv	i wasnt in it
2011-05-30T03:11:00.000Z	lsv	LAcan	try to rename the folder and then delete?
2011-05-30T03:12:00.000Z	LAcan	lsv	no go, renaming it didint work either
2011-05-30T03:13:00.000Z	lsv	LAcan	where is this folder?
2011-05-30T03:13:00.000Z	LAcan	lsv	its a seperate logical partition, formatted as ntfs and mounted to my home directory
2011-05-30T03:15:00.000Z	lsv	LAcan	another user mention you should try to unmount the partition.  Check what Loshki said
2011-05-30T03:16:00.000Z	LAcan	lsv	Loshki but if i unmount how do I delete/access it?
2011-05-30T03:16:00.000Z	LAcan	lsv	Loshki ok, this is messed but i just managed to delete it now... all gone.. success i guess and ty for the help!
