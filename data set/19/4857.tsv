2008-10-23T23:11:00.000Z	akahige		can anyone tell the the bash script syntax for doing a recursive chmod? the usual "-R" doesn't seem to do it
2008-10-23T23:13:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	is this in a bash script?
2008-10-23T23:13:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	if it is, chances are you will have to put it in a loop of some kind
2008-10-23T23:14:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	since $quoted is a variable, you have to change it for every name
2008-10-23T23:14:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	easier would just be to do cd /dir/ && chmod -R 644 *
2008-10-23T23:15:00.000Z	akahige	lswest	this is a bash/nautilus script
2008-10-23T23:15:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	so pass it the dir as a variable, it'll work better that way I think
2008-10-23T23:17:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	if you pass the paths as multiple paths in one variable it will only change the first variable, better to pass it multiple variables, or put it in an array (if that works in bash scripts, never tried it)
2008-10-23T23:18:00.000Z	akahige	lswest	I'm kind of out of my element with bash scripting. I'm just happy I got it to work.  =]
2008-10-23T23:18:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	what exactly do you want the script to do?  Might be a different way to do so
2008-10-23T23:20:00.000Z	akahige	lswest	would like the script to be able to recurse if there are selected directories, and keep (or make the directories 755) while chmoding the files to 644.
2008-10-23T23:21:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	if you want multiple directories to be changed, you'll have to pass it seperately each time to the command
2008-10-23T23:22:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	e.g. cd dir1 && chmod -R 644 *
2008-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	akahige	lswest	is that just an issue of setting up a loop, or is it more complicated?
2008-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	I'm not sure, I'd have to play with a few scripts myself
2008-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	if you want, email me a detailed outline of what you want passed and what you want to happen at lswest@live.co.uk
2008-10-23T23:24:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	I'll sort it out and email you the script I come up with by tomorrow afternoon at the latest then
2008-10-23T23:24:00.000Z	akahige	lswest	thanks.  I'll do that.
2008-10-23T23:24:00.000Z	lswest	akahige	no problem, hopefully it'll be simpler than we both think
