2007-04-22T11:57:00.000Z	Stig		Ok, thanks anyway
2007-04-22T11:58:00.000Z	Stig		 Is there a program or any way to help configure my battery on my laptop? I am new to Ubuntu and have noticed my battery does not last as long as it did on XP. Any idea's why?
2007-04-22T11:58:00.000Z	Stig		thanks
2007-04-22T11:59:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	you can also check System-> preferences -> power management
2007-04-22T12:02:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	System-> preferences-> Power settings
2007-04-22T12:03:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	thanks, I have already looked in there but it hasn't got any options to change CPU power, GFX power, etc. I have a 2Ghz dual core processor, and on Windows I was able to use only half of the CPU, which saved alot of battery power.
2007-04-22T12:06:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	oh nice! thanks
2007-04-22T12:10:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	and trol0s; one thing you should know about that widget on laptops, when i resume from suspend, it seems to lock my cpu into full throttle mode until i restart X, i've reported it as a bug, and i don't know if it happens for other people, just something to watch.
2007-04-22T12:12:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	on the CPU frequency monitor. Is it possible to change the CPU power settings? I can only see it tell me what speed it is running at, but can;t see how to change it;s power settings, etc.
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	just click on it, it should have 4 entries: Conservative, Ondemand, Performance, Powersave
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	Also, do you know if I need to have two instances of CPU frequency monitor running if I have a dual core processor?
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	no the freq is the same between cores.
2007-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	nothing happeneds when I left click, when I right click I see the normal taskbar options of "preferences, help, about, remove from panel" etc... :O
2007-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	no sure why, what kind of laptop/processor?
2007-04-22T12:15:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	Dell inspiron 9400, it's a intel T7200 Core 2 duo 2Ghz CPU I think...
2007-04-22T12:16:00.000Z	taggie	Stig	i don't know, it's possible there's no throttling support for the 7200 yet, but i don't know why that would be. what does the display say? 100% all the time?
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	When I open an application or something, it goes up to 100% :O
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	when I am idle it's 50%, pretty cool I guess. But I would like it to be 50% all the time when in battery power!
2007-04-22T12:19:00.000Z	Stig	taggie	Oh wait, I just switched to battery power and it's at 50% all the time now. So I guess it automatically changes the CPU settings. I don't know, I will ask on the forums. Thanks for the help anyway.
