2008-03-26T04:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	that we definitely have.
2008-03-26T04:27:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	do you know iptables?
2008-03-26T04:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	Not really (yet), although I really should.
2008-03-26T04:30:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	you may take a look to pptp too
2008-03-26T04:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	"PPTP is difficult to forward past a network firewall because it requires two network sessions." - that doesn't sound good
2008-03-26T04:32:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	encapsulate it through ssl?
2008-03-26T04:35:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	Can't Alice connect outside to a VPN server instead of trying to break in the NAT ?
2008-03-26T04:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	could you elaborate?
2008-03-26T04:36:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	cron job a deamon to check vpn state and connect to your vpn server... or meabe a simple deamon that "keep alive" the connection
2008-03-26T04:37:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	maybe the NAT wont let pass some traffic... you may consider encapsulate your VPN connection through 443 (SSL)
2008-03-26T04:40:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	find out a place with a static ip or a configured dyn-dns and install your pptp or openvpn server there. then connect alice to it. You will have a both way connection through the univiersity network ;)
2008-03-26T04:41:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	some IDS / active firewall may flag that kind of traffic but, in my point of view, it's the way to go
2008-03-26T04:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	Mostly following.
2008-03-26T04:42:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	basicly you need a pptp or openvpn server that you can reach. install your tunnel (pptp/openvpn) server on it and connect alice to it
2008-03-26T04:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	well, bob doesn't have a static IP, but a third machine "Charlie" that I have access to does.
2008-03-26T04:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	Okay, I'll look into that a bit more.
2008-03-26T04:43:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	connect the three together ;)
2008-03-26T04:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CMind	right
2008-03-26T04:44:00.000Z	CMind	tonyyarusso	try googling "pptp through ssl"
