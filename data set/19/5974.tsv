2009-06-09T09:22:00.000Z	jcp		Is there a way to install drivers for the sony vaio webcam in ubuntu? I've done some google searches but nothing seems to be conclusive about it.
2009-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	jcp		and how do I find that out. lsusb didn't print anything about a webcam in the output
2009-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	jcp		heh, np

2009-06-09T09:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	jcp	Could you open a terminal and type "ls /dev/video*"
2009-06-09T09:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	jcp	let me know what is listed?

2009-06-09T09:35:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	jcp	yeah.. is there a hotkey to turn your webcam on?
2009-06-09T09:35:00.000Z	jcp	Paddy_EIRE	nope, it's normally always on in windows
2009-06-09T09:36:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	jcp	have you tried installing an application called "cheese" to see if that detects your camera?
2009-06-09T09:37:00.000Z	jcp	Paddy_EIRE	cheese... I don't think I've heard of that
2009-06-09T09:37:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	jcp	open a terminal and type "sudo apt-get install cheese"
2009-06-09T09:39:00.000Z	jcp	Paddy_EIRE	ok, ran that and it says "no webcam found"
2009-06-09T09:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	jcp	there seems to be very few responses (none) to that particular problem http://wiki.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1103545
