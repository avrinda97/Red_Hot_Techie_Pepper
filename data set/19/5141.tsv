2008-08-22T23:11:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]		Well, I would like a tip to make a configuration of /etc/fstab file.
2008-08-22T23:11:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]		Btw, I have installed ntfs-3g and ntfs-config program on my Ubuntu.
2008-08-22T23:11:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]		I have 3 HDDs in my PC.
2008-08-22T23:11:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]		That's the file system table of them: http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p61/avsantos/Ubuntu/Tabeladeparties.png (Arquivos Pessoais = Personal files; "Janelas" = Windows)
2008-08-22T23:11:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]		(I added a 3rd one last week and it has 40GB (fat32 and /sdc)
2008-08-22T23:11:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]		I would like to mount, by default, all these others partitions instead of only /sda1, /sda5 (these two were mounted under ntfs-3g configs)
2008-08-22T23:12:00.000Z	Pici	[_Ulver_]	floodbot is a bot, it cannot respond to you.
2008-08-22T23:14:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	ok. Thanks
2008-08-22T23:15:00.000Z	Pici	[_Ulver_]	What does your /etc/fstab look like right now?
2008-08-22T23:16:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	one second...
2008-08-22T23:17:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	http://paste.ubuntu.com/39751/
2008-08-22T23:21:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	any idea man?
2008-08-22T23:22:00.000Z	Pici	[_Ulver_]	You'll need to create mountpoints for each of the partitions you want to mount.  They don't have to be named the same thing as the parition name if you don't want, but heres a little sample as to what it should look like: http://paste.ubuntu.com/39754/
2008-08-22T23:25:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	to create mounpoint I need to do: sudo mkdir /media/xxx ?
2008-08-22T23:25:00.000Z	Pici	[_Ulver_]	Yep, a mountpoint is just a fancy name for a directory.
2008-08-22T23:26:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	hmm, ok. I'll do it now. But the other 2 HDDs aren't recognized when I mount them by ntfs-3g. What should I do?
2008-08-22T23:27:00.000Z	Pici	[_Ulver_]	They've never been recognized? or just all of a sudden?
2008-08-22T23:30:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	/sdb and /sdc are just mounted when I click on them. Every time when I reboot they turn to be unmounted again.
2008-08-22T23:36:00.000Z	[_Ulver_]	Pici	thank you too.
