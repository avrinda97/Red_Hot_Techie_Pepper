2006-10-09T16:03:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	So I'm guessing no
2006-10-09T16:04:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	Core 2 Duo's use socket LGA775, that motherboard is a socket mPGA478. So the chip wouldn't even fit, much less work :S
2006-10-09T16:06:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	That motherboard was desiged for a chip that came out 3 years ago. The Core 2 Duo wasn't even a research prototype at that point.
2006-10-09T16:06:00.000Z	rcmiv	RobHu	thanks for the link
2006-10-09T16:06:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	np
2006-10-09T16:07:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	I found this all out from the wikipedia entries on Core 2 Duo, and Pentium 4
2006-10-09T16:07:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	and that page
2006-10-09T16:08:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	Why do you need that particular board to be supported?
2006-10-09T16:08:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	Is that what you have?
2006-10-09T16:08:00.000Z	rcmiv	RobHu	yep
2006-10-09T16:08:00.000Z	rcmiv	RobHu	the P4 3.2 runs _hot_. I hate it
2006-10-09T16:09:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	What about a Pentium D?
2006-10-09T16:10:00.000Z	rcmiv	RobHu	will research, thanks
2006-10-09T16:11:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	You can get a Core 2 Duo compatible mobo for 45 dollars (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813185086) ... I assume you are american
2006-10-09T16:12:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	Core 2 is a fantastic chip, I have a Pentium D 805 which is the gen before
2006-10-09T16:12:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	More than enough for me though - I don't really see why most users need dual core

2006-10-09T16:14:00.000Z	RobHu	rcmiv	You might also want to search for 775...
