2007-05-22T09:25:00.000Z	jacobnix		guys , i have a question
2007-05-22T09:25:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	just ask
2007-05-22T09:25:00.000Z	jacobnix	Pelo	ok
2007-05-22T09:39:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	 you add it
2007-05-22T09:42:00.000Z	jacobnix	Pelo	but when i installed an application from synaptic, not only kate it is installed , more kde applications dependencies were installed
2007-05-22T09:43:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	 dependencies dont, appear in the menues, only the applications,   most dependencies are librairies and stuff like that
2007-05-22T09:44:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	if they are not in the menu you add then to the menu,  you need to remember what you installed to do that
2007-05-22T09:44:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	then add the others
2007-05-22T09:45:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	only happs you have decided to install will have been installed,  when you are running gnome there are no kde apps by default
2007-05-22T09:46:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	so you should know which kde app you have installed
2007-05-22T09:47:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	 sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-05-22T09:47:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	 you'llhave to wait then
2007-05-22T09:49:00.000Z	Pelo	jacobnix	canada
