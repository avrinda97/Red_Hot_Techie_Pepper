2010-03-31T04:12:00.000Z	codnik		aye folks
2010-03-31T04:13:00.000Z	codnik		i need some help... nslookup is resolving localhost to google's dns server. that doesn't sound right to me
2010-03-31T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	if you run: cat /etc/resolv.conf    do you see 8.8.8.8
2010-03-31T04:15:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	yeah. i added nameserver 127.0.0.1 to that but i'm not sure that's a proper thing to do. it doesn't solve the problem, anyway
2010-03-31T04:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	are you running something like dnsmasq
2010-03-31T04:15:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	not that i'm aware of
2010-03-31T04:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	then adding nameserver 127.0.0.1 will do nothing
2010-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	ah, you're right. i entered dnsmasq in the terminal and now localhost resolves to the right ip
2010-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	if you added the google dns servers in your network management app or /etc/resolv.conf then they will be used. its no bad thing, it will do the job
2010-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	i use dnsmasq, you can check its working using dig
2010-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	i wasn't aware of that until now. i actually thought it could be an issue because i'm not being able to listen on localhost for music player daemon
2010-03-31T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	dig www.bmezine.com   will take a few ms to finish, if you repeat it will take 0ms
2010-03-31T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	if your system is on long enough dnsmasq will have a decent amount of resolutions and you wont need any web based resolutions ;)
2010-03-31T04:20:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	so how come it wasn't on by default?
2010-03-31T04:20:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	also, can you help with my mpd issue?
2010-03-31T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	it shouldnt be, your ISP's dns will be default, you have to add google's manually as well as localhost
2010-03-31T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codnik	not something i use dude
2010-03-31T04:22:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	dudette ;P
2010-03-31T04:23:00.000Z	codnik	ActionParsnip	anyway, thanks for the insights
