2010-10-13T09:08:00.000Z	etyrnal_		i am a parent
2010-10-13T09:09:00.000Z	etyrnal_		i don't want to have to
2010-10-13T09:10:00.000Z	etyrnal_		How do i set a user up so that their password can not e changed?
2010-10-13T09:10:00.000Z	etyrnal_		be^
2010-10-13T09:10:00.000Z	etyrnal_		(by the user that is)
2010-10-13T09:11:00.000Z	etyrnal_		another reason, is because it's a shared account...  a family account...  and i do not want child A being able to accidentally/purposefully change the password
2010-10-13T09:11:00.000Z	etyrnal_		and i don't see why i should have to pass my request for help past an evaluation just to get help?
2010-10-13T09:12:00.000Z	etyrnal_		so, is there a way to set a user's password, and then make it so that user can not change the password?
2010-10-13T09:13:00.000Z	etyrnal_		i love how people will question my motives for asking for help, but then won't help
2010-10-13T09:14:00.000Z	izinucs	etyrnal_	not sure exactly how but it has to do with what group the user belongs to..
2010-10-13T09:14:00.000Z	etyrnal_	izinucs	thanks!  a least that's a start...  so You are saying, that as far as You know, it is/may be possible tho?
2010-10-13T09:15:00.000Z	izinucs	etyrnal_	I know it's possible.. user settings are very flexable
2010-10-13T09:16:00.000Z	etyrnal_	izinucs	thanks -- that right there is a big help - no i know where to start looking - much appreciated
2010-10-13T09:16:00.000Z	izinucs	etyrnal_	good luck.. nice project
2010-10-13T09:16:00.000Z	etyrnal_		so maybe create a group, put that user in it, and then set that group to be unable to change it's pw -- essentially, right?
2010-10-13T09:17:00.000Z	izinucs	etyrnal_	maybe.. but more like remove membership in the group that allows password changes.
2010-10-13T09:18:00.000Z	etyrnal_		hmm - the user is in a group named after their own name
2010-10-13T09:18:00.000Z	izinucs	etyrnal_	no.. there are several/many groups that a user belongs to "out of the box"
