2006-10-31T11:11:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	i didn't see the entire conversation -- just tuned in.
2006-10-31T11:14:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	it's not
2006-10-31T11:14:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	i can connect to it
2006-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	ah, sorry that i missed your comment about that.
2006-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	maybe he is not routing to it?
2006-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	no... he can ping it
2006-10-31T11:16:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	so he can ping it, but not telnet to port 21?
2006-10-31T11:20:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	i can't think of anything, unless some router (or remote site) is filtering based off of MAC address
2006-10-31T11:46:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	not routeable across a router to a different network
2006-10-31T11:47:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	unless an explicit routing table is setup, right?
2006-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	no.   a router cannot legally route it (following the rfc's i mean)
2006-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	it's fine on your LAN
2006-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	ah, makes sense.  is that in RFC 1918?
2006-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	not sure offhand which it is. but something has to do NAT before such packets can get to an external network
2006-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	found it.  RFC 1918, page 4
2006-10-31T11:51:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	that's why you have to set up port forwarding through your router to connect to an internal machine on your LAN. the internal addresses can't be routed directly. the router doing the NAT has a routeable address
2006-10-31T11:52:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	i understand that -- i just didn't realize that "private" networks were not allowed to propagate routing information across links
2006-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	dfcarney	mister_roboto	specifically, i didn't know this:  "routing information about private networks shall not be propagated on inter-enterprise links, and packets with private source or destination addresses should not be forwarded across such links.
2006-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	mister_roboto	dfcarney	ahh, ok :)
