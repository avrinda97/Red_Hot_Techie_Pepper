2007-09-15T07:16:00.000Z	ferronica		Can we do Web Cam chat in ubuntu ?
2007-09-15T07:17:00.000Z	Xero	ferronica	no.
2007-09-15T07:17:00.000Z	Xero		This is IRC, not IM. You have absolutely no idea what kind of people lurk here, and that's why there is no webcam chat on IRC.
2007-09-15T07:17:00.000Z	ferronica	Xero	what application do i need
2007-09-15T07:18:00.000Z	Xero	ferronica	if you want to IM, I suggest Kopete or Pidgin. Kopete has webcam support right out of the box.
2007-09-15T07:19:00.000Z	Xero		[nrx] , Feisty Fawn
2007-09-15T07:20:00.000Z	ferronica	Xero	In Gaim ?
2007-09-15T07:20:00.000Z	Xero	ferronica	Gaim is discontinued. If you want webcam support, sudo apt-get install kopete
2007-09-15T07:20:00.000Z	Xero		I'm sure tehre are others that have webcam support, but Kopete is the one that comes to my mind.
2007-09-15T07:20:00.000Z	Xero		*there
2007-09-15T07:21:00.000Z	ferronica	Xero	Is that KDE application
2007-09-15T07:21:00.000Z	ferronica	Xero	right now i am using GAIM
2007-09-15T07:21:00.000Z	Xero	ferronica	you can run KDE apps on GNOME if you install a few libs.
2007-09-15T07:23:00.000Z	ferronica	Xero	in GNOME any IM which support WEB CAM
2007-09-15T07:23:00.000Z	Xero	ferronica	I don't know;.
2007-09-15T07:23:00.000Z	Xero		Search it on google, because I have no idea
2007-09-15T07:23:00.000Z	ferronica		okay
2007-09-15T07:24:00.000Z	Xero		[nrx] , pidgin doesn't have webcam.
