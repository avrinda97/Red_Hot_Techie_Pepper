2009-12-01T21:37:00.000Z	ManDay		I want to install the GTK engine Clearlooks, there is one in the repos, but its marked as "virtual" and I cannot install it - whats this?!
2009-12-01T21:37:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	GTK Clearlooks is provided by another package
2009-12-01T21:38:00.000Z	ManDay	ibuclaw	so why is it listed in aptitude then? whats that for?
2009-12-01T21:39:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	sometimes several packages have the exact same files... to prevent a conflict - we have "virtual" packages that act as a master package.
2009-12-01T21:40:00.000Z	ManDay	ibuclaw	ah
2009-12-01T21:40:00.000Z	ManDay		thanks
2009-12-01T21:40:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	for example: xsplash-artwork is a virtual package - and it's "child" packages (that provide it) are ubuntu-xsplash-artwork and sability-xsplash-artwork.
2009-12-01T21:41:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	but other packages don't depend on the child package - instead they depend on the master.
2009-12-01T21:41:00.000Z	ibuclaw		if that makes sense...
2009-12-01T21:41:00.000Z	ManDay		thanks ibuclaw
2009-12-01T21:42:00.000Z	ManDay		can anyone tell me what package enables fancy mouse gestures for mousepads?
2009-12-01T21:42:00.000Z	ManDay		(the apple-like things)
2009-12-01T21:43:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	not too sure, but you could try: apt-cache search mouse gestures
2009-12-01T21:43:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	to query the packages in the repository
2009-12-01T21:43:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	only seems to be a Firefox addon
2009-12-01T21:45:00.000Z	ManDay	ibuclaw	im not talkign about firefox mouse gestures. im talking about these apple-gestures (two fingers scroll etc)
2009-12-01T21:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	oh, I'm pretty sure I saw a two finger scroll option in the Gnome Mouse preferences
2009-12-01T21:45:00.000Z	ManDay		btw: do I need to install a separate package besides compiz and metacity-common to make gnome remember the maximized state of a window after it got closed?
2009-12-01T21:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	ManDay	System->Preferences->Mouse
