2012-09-26T04:24:00.000Z	k4r1m		is there anyway to print a user's password using root?
2012-09-26T04:24:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	no
2012-09-26T04:25:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	:(
2012-09-26T04:26:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	what are you trying to do?
2012-09-26T04:27:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	my user on machine is an active directory user via centrifydc.. I ran an update and janitor and I believe it removed centrify. I can no longer log in.
2012-09-26T04:29:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	active directory is a windows thing... presumably you must be using some kind of ldap or samba connector to AD
2012-09-26T04:29:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	but the user would not appear in /etc/passwd if it were an LDAP or AD account
2012-09-26T04:29:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	yeah centrifyDc
2012-09-26T04:30:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	so if centrify was the interface to the AD server then you need to reinstall centrify
2012-09-26T04:31:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	well actually I think centrify is still here
2012-09-26T04:31:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	adinfo says the machine is joined but centrifydc is down
2012-09-26T04:34:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	you'll have to find someone who knows more about this centrify program
2012-09-26T04:36:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	you might try logging into the new user on tty1 (ctrl-alt-f1) then stopping your dm (sudo service gdm stop) and then startx
2012-09-26T04:49:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	not by default, and since your account isn't a standard unix account anyways we are going to have to point you back to your AD server centrify configuration
2012-09-26T04:50:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	you might want to try the #ubuntu-server channel they *might* know more about AD
2012-09-26T05:10:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	After a little more digging it seem that I'm connected to my AD and I can log in fine from the recovery shell using "su username" but I can't login from gdm
2012-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	su username won't work because the user doesn't exist unless the AD service is working
2012-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	k4r1m	escott	it did work
2012-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	escott	k4r1m	think about about the stuff in /etc/passwd. that is *all* you need to create an account, so things like LDAP and AD can just provide the required information (password auth process, $HOME location, UID and GIDs) to the login process, but without them it says "I don't know how to set $HOME or how to set GID or UID
