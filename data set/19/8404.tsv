2007-05-13T06:07:00.000Z	NessieLiberation		hello - metacity doesnt always start up when i load gnome
2007-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	NessieLiberation		"doesn't always" = rarely or never
2007-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	any errors in $HOME/.xsession-errors?
2007-05-13T06:10:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	yeah, seems so
2007-05-13T06:11:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	make that none, cat $HOME/.xsession-errors | grep -i metacity = blank
2007-05-13T06:11:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	I remember fixing a configuration issue where metacity complained about a key with a "blank" value.
2007-05-13T06:12:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	like:
2007-05-13T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	don't paste please
2007-05-13T06:12:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	i was going to paste the single line
2007-05-13T06:13:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	go on then, I hope you don't get kicked ;)
2007-05-13T06:13:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	nevermind... it's not there
2007-05-13T06:15:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	I remembered. In gconf-editor, look at /apps/metacity/window_keybindings and ensure that toggle_shaded is set to disabled (rather than an empty string).
2007-05-13T06:15:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	i'll have a look, thanks
2007-05-13T06:16:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	i set toggle shading to alt+f11 deliberately
2007-05-13T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	that's fine then, it just mustn't be empty. That wasn't your problem, then.
2007-05-13T06:17:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	i do have plenty of <no value>s though
2007-05-13T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	well, maybe it would help to set those. Or go with jrib's suggestion (do it in a failsafe session, though).
2007-05-13T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	NessieLiberation	no_values don't seem to cause a problem here. Only empty strings do.
2007-05-13T06:20:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	soundray	jrib, thanks i'll have a play later
