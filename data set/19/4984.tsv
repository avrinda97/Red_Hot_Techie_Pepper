2008-11-16T08:04:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	64 runs fine on my amd too, but i agree, less support and less apps
2008-11-16T08:06:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	i'm gettin deadmoo to try it in a vbox :P
2008-11-16T08:06:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	well no
2008-11-16T08:08:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	sorry for that (deadmoo is Os86X a patched leopard :P)
2008-11-16T08:08:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	u'd try intrepid amd64 if you look for 64bit
2008-11-16T08:09:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	there is gmountiso
2008-11-16T08:10:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	there is a fine app gmount.iso (or a similar name)
2008-11-16T08:11:00.000Z	raven_	tripitakit	looks like that's just a GUI app for mount
2008-11-16T08:11:00.000Z	tripitakit	raven_	yes it is a gui for a loopback mount
