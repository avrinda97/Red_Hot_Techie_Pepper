2005-12-26T07:03:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	gtk-gnutella is quite good
2005-12-26T07:03:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	where do I get that?
2005-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	ak, ok ...
2005-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	the "repos" information that ubotu should have /msg-d you includes how to add the "universe" repository which you'll need to get gtk-gnutella (or whatever)
2005-12-26T17:41:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	you could try gtk-gnutella - "sudo aptitude install gtk-gnutella" (if the universe repository is enabled)
2005-12-26T17:43:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	okay, I just done that now how do I get it to show up in my menus?
2005-12-26T17:43:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	Applications -> Internet
2005-12-26T17:43:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	I know, I'm sorry, woke up to early
2005-12-26T17:43:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	:)
2005-12-26T17:45:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	it says I have a very old version, how do I update it?
2005-12-26T17:48:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	what is it? (mine is 0.95.4-1 via "dpkg -l gtk-gnutella")
2005-12-26T17:48:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	that's what mine is too but, I can't get anything to show up on it.  it says I'm firewalled but I don't know how to fix that
2005-12-26T17:50:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	hm, mine says that too - but works ok. not sure sorry
2005-12-26T17:51:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	I just type what I'm looking for in the search bar, correct?  dumb question but, maybe I'm not doing something right.
2005-12-26T17:53:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	yep, that's right, then click on the search on the left to see the results
2005-12-26T17:54:00.000Z	alpunk	bimberi	that what I thought.  thanks
2005-12-26T06:01:00.000Z	bimberi	alpunk	 you will need to enable the multiverse repository
