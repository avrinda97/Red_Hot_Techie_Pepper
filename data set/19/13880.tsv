2005-01-01T13:02:00.000Z	anir		but in ububtu i have to download from the net only to configure my system...
2005-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	anir		take for example ... i am downloading 200MB from yesterday..
2005-01-01T13:04:00.000Z	anir		and belive me.. it requires a lot of time to do this..
2005-01-01T13:05:00.000Z	anir		but see in windows.. you will get all the required software in the installing cd only
2005-01-01T13:06:00.000Z	anir		thats why people hasitates to install linux.. as my rommie said
2005-01-01T13:07:00.000Z	anir		i dont know.. but other than being a bit stable...i dont find any advantages in linux over windows
2005-01-01T13:08:00.000Z	anir		hope we will get something better linux in the near future which will solve the problems... but till then..
2005-01-01T13:09:00.000Z	anir		now Window is coming with LongHorn... its great..
2005-01-01T13:09:00.000Z	tritium	anir	what compilers and libraries does Longhorn come with?
2005-01-01T13:35:00.000Z	tritium	anir	I'd be careful callilng that a "fact"
2005-01-01T13:16:00.000Z	tritium	anir	did you install wine?
2005-01-01T13:17:00.000Z	tritium	anir	I can help you install wine.  It can run many, but not all, windows applications.
2005-01-01T13:18:00.000Z	tritium	anir	okay, just makeing sure
2005-01-01T13:22:00.000Z	tritium	anir	there are different opinions of what would be better.  I don't play video games, so the ability to play windows games wouldn't make ubuntu better for me...
2005-01-01T13:23:00.000Z	anir	tritium	but for the rest 50% people it will be.. why only think about yourself
2005-01-01T13:23:00.000Z	tritium	anir	I'm not.  I'm thinking about those that don't care about games.
2005-01-01T13:24:00.000Z	anir	tritium	suppose u work in php and i work with java.. so it will be better if it supports both..isnt it
2005-01-01T13:26:00.000Z	tritium	anir	I'm more of a minimalist.  I'd prefer the intersection, rather than the union, of users' needs.
2005-01-01T13:34:00.000Z	tritium	anir	You overlook the fact that a standard windows installation does not include many of the tools that come standard in any linux distro.
