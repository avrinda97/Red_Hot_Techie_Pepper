2007-07-31T15:55:00.000Z	wilrecar		alright
2007-07-31T15:56:00.000Z	wilrecar		n[i] x: you lost me, why would you install the ssl dependencies for an ipod related application?
2007-07-31T15:58:00.000Z	wilrecar		n[i] x: you said that when you tried to run the install it showed the name of the required lib, search that on google, there should be something ubuntu compatible
2007-07-31T15:59:00.000Z	wilrecar		also, how are there to N[i] X's in different colors?
2007-07-31T15:59:00.000Z	wilrecar		two*
2007-07-31T16:00:00.000Z	wilrecar		i think im talking to the gold nix and ameyer is talking to the purple one
2007-07-31T16:01:00.000Z	wilrecar		i see you with a purple colored name and i see a nix with a golden colored name in a slightly bolder text
2007-07-31T16:02:00.000Z	ameyer	wilrecar	the installer script required that lib apparently
2007-07-31T16:02:00.000Z	wilrecar		it did?
2007-07-31T16:02:00.000Z	ameyer	wilrecar	I'd guess the iPod only  runs signed binaries
2007-07-31T16:03:00.000Z	wilrecar		i saw his earlier response say the lib libcrypto.so.0.9.7 was required
2007-07-31T16:06:00.000Z	wilrecar		wait wait wait, you have lost me again
2007-07-31T16:06:00.000Z	wilrecar		from my point of view he has an ipodlinux installer but it wont work because its missing a library, correct???
2007-07-31T16:07:00.000Z	ameyer	wilrecar	apparently
2007-07-31T16:08:00.000Z	ameyer		darn, he let
2007-07-31T16:08:00.000Z	wilrecar	ameyer	so why would he need the ssl dependency or a driver?
2007-07-31T16:08:00.000Z	ameyer	wilrecar	who  knows
2007-07-31T16:08:00.000Z	wilrecar		oh well
2007-07-31T16:09:00.000Z	ameyer	wilrecar	perhaps the linux image he was attempting to install on the iPod needed to be cryptographically signed
