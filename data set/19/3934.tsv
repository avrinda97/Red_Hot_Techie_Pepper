2009-06-26T23:04:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	What if it shows nothing?
2009-06-26T23:05:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Run `iwconfig` at a prompt and check whether the computer has a wireless interface configured.
2009-06-26T23:05:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	That comes up good (I think), its assigned to wlan0
2009-06-26T23:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Does the  "wlan0" line say something like "IEEE 802.11abgn"?
2009-06-26T23:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Okay, that stuff means that the driver for the wifi interface is loaded.
2009-06-26T23:07:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Ask the wifi interface directly for a list of networks.  Run `sudo iwlist scan` at the prompt.
2009-06-26T23:08:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	It shows the different ESSID's available in range
2009-06-26T23:09:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Okay, that means that the glitch is in the network manager.
2009-06-26T23:09:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	Should I reinstall network manager?
2009-06-26T23:09:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Did it ever work, or has it always been broken?
2009-06-26T23:11:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Check the /etc/network/interfaces file for a mention of wlan0.  Network Manager won't automatically configure most interfaces that have any kind of static configuration.
2009-06-26T23:12:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	No wlan0 mentioned!
2009-06-26T23:12:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	Can I add "auto wlan0" or something?
2009-06-26T23:12:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	No, don't do that.  It is okay for that file to be empty or sparse.
2009-06-26T23:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Check the computer for a toggle switch with the wifi logo, or a network logo.
2009-06-26T23:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Many laptop computers have a physical switch that disconnects or disables the wifi card.
2009-06-26T23:13:00.000Z	kovacsleeve	dajhorn	Have done that several times already. It lights up as active (the wirless) when I turn it to on.
2009-06-26T23:14:00.000Z	dajhorn	kovacsleeve	Okay, do a cold restart.  Power off, let it sit, and power on.
