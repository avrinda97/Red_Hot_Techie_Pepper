2010-05-13T11:34:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam		that's your standard option there
2010-05-13T11:34:00.000Z	chouchou	CogitoErgoSam	since ubuntu have all of them
2010-05-13T11:34:00.000Z	chouchou		I want to use it
2010-05-13T11:34:00.000Z	chouchou		on my OC
2010-05-13T11:35:00.000Z	chouchou		PC
2010-05-13T11:35:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	chouchou	 You're not being very clear.  Do you want LAMP?  Its the standard option.  If no, why not?
2010-05-13T11:35:00.000Z	chouchou		I want lamp, but on a linux based environment
2010-05-13T11:36:00.000Z	chouchou		because I cannot always upload my php files on a remote hosting server
2010-05-13T11:36:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	chouchou	 lamp IS the linux based environment
2010-05-13T11:36:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	chouchou	 It stands for Linux Apache Mysql PHP
2010-05-13T11:36:00.000Z	chouchou		ok, I understand, but installed on windows gives a nasty resumt
2010-05-13T11:36:00.000Z	chouchou		result
2010-05-13T11:36:00.000Z	chouchou		XAMPP, and Easyphp when istalled
2010-05-13T11:37:00.000Z	chouchou		for many years, I always have have problem with database
2010-05-13T11:37:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	chouchou	 If you're referring to XAMP on windows, it always worked fine for me...but regardless, LAMP is the standard php environment for linux hosting
2010-05-13T11:37:00.000Z	chouchou		I don't want to solve a problem for windows and later solve a different for linux, that is why I want to have a uniform deployment for all
2010-05-13T11:39:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	chouchou	 Well, you can't magically make everything work the first time on both windows and linux.  The setup is fairly similar on the two environments but with either option you're going to have to do some learning and extra work.
2010-05-13T11:39:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	chouchou	 But as far as the PHP code goes, that's gonna work pretty much the same regardless of the host OS
