2008-06-26T04:04:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	well ... liveCD sees my 4 CPUs
2008-06-26T04:06:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	did you install 8.04 or did you upgrade?
2008-06-26T04:07:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	?
2008-06-26T04:09:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	yepÂ· As I said :  I see only one. But I am now on a liveCD and I see all 4. So I'm trying to find what we could have in common except the OS and the CPU
2008-06-26T04:10:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	so, did you do a fresh 8.04 install or did you upgrade from 7.10?
2008-06-26T04:10:00.000Z	zeeq	sammyF	i thing its something to do with the i386 32bit archetecture...they say the support for dual core and quad core is more in the 64bit edition
2008-06-26T04:11:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	ahhh
2008-06-26T04:11:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	could be. I'm on the 64bit LiveCD right now
2008-06-26T04:13:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	nah ... more a general question ;)
2008-06-26T04:14:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	that's also a very good one :)
2008-06-26T04:17:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	yep :/
2008-06-26T04:18:00.000Z	sammyF	zeeq	yep :/ cpm is indeed right
2008-06-26T04:20:00.000Z	zeeq	sammyF	if u get it solved plz report back, I will come back with the lernel compiling updates
