2006-12-17T08:37:00.000Z	iks		Hey all ! I just installed Feisty (reinstall in fact) and I tried to install everything that I needed (non-free things). I generally did that using Automatix but since I read it can cause problems I did it with normal apt-get...
2006-12-17T08:37:00.000Z	iks		My first problem is that movies do not show previews...
2006-12-17T08:38:00.000Z	iks		Do you have any idea abot how I can fix that ? :p

2006-12-17T08:39:00.000Z	un_operateur1	iks	no, i'm not french  -- my current nick is a nom-de-plume
2006-12-17T08:39:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	oh ^^
2006-12-17T08:40:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	so do you have any idea why I keep seeing the same icons for all my movies where I should see a preview of it ?
2006-12-17T08:41:00.000Z	un_operateur1	iks	i'm sorry i cant really help with that -- i dont use gnome at all :)
2006-12-17T08:41:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	ok >_<
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	just to tell you I found the solution : simply delete all folders in ~/.thumbnails (when it first generate the previews not having the correct codec it cant show the preview and it then save it in those folders)
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	un_operateur1	iks	cool, i'll remember that for the next time i use nautlius :)
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	never ? xD Do you use KDE ?
2006-12-17T08:51:00.000Z	un_operateur1	iks	i use fluxbox
2006-12-17T08:51:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	I tried it on Mandriva today I think..
2006-12-17T08:51:00.000Z	iks	un_operateur1	anyway, thanks for helping ;) Good Day/Night (3 AM here in Paris)
2006-12-17T08:52:00.000Z	un_operateur1	iks	bon nuit :)
