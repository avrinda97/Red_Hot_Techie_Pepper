2009-06-27T01:22:00.000Z	Nationiant	microtech	thanks
2009-06-27T01:22:00.000Z	microtech	Radtoo	I tried it that way first yes
2009-06-27T01:23:00.000Z	microtech	Radtoo	if there are no partitions on the drives can I still create the /dev/md0 and reference /dev/sda1 and sbd1?
2009-06-27T01:23:00.000Z	microtech		ya it definitely doesnt =)
2009-06-27T01:24:00.000Z	microtech	Radtoo	is there a mdadm --destroy command, how can I delete the /dev/md0 I tried to create
2009-06-27T01:24:00.000Z	microtech		is it just the mdadm --stop
2009-06-27T01:24:00.000Z	microtech		ok, it stopped it
2009-06-27T01:25:00.000Z	microtech	Radtoo	so do I want partitions on the drives to begin with?
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	Nationiant		How to burn .dmg files in Ubuntu (I need to install Mac Os X to my Macintosh computer so i need to burn it), imgburn doesn't work
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	microtech		it doesnt Nationiant?
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	Nationiant	microtech	It doesn't support it
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	microtech		no I don't Radtoo
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	microtech		hrm, sorry about that Nationiant
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	Nationiant	microtech	I selected it and got "Invalid or unsupported image file format"
2009-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	microtech		so, currently I have no partitions on the drives, when I do the mdadm -C  would it still be with /dev/sda1 or just /dev/sda
2009-06-27T01:27:00.000Z	microtech		hrm, sorry about the mis-info. Nationiant
2009-06-27T01:27:00.000Z	microtech		ok sounds good
2009-06-27T01:27:00.000Z	Nationiant	microtech	Well not a bad thing, thanks for trying
