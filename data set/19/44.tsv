2012-11-10T06:13:00.000Z	breiak		I have a problem with my audio its not working at all, I'm running 12.10, This is my first linux desktop so I dont know how to begin.
2012-11-10T06:14:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	what make model computer,
2012-11-10T06:15:00.000Z	breiak	dauntless	its an Intel pc with an onboard soundcard.
2012-11-10T06:17:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	do you happen to know what make/nodel of your mobo?
2012-11-10T06:17:00.000Z	breiak	dauntless	I really have no idea what a mobo is.
2012-11-10T06:17:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	motherboard
2012-11-10T06:18:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	sudo dmidecode | more
2012-11-10T06:20:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	assuming you know to run that from a terminal
2012-11-10T06:20:00.000Z	breiak	dauntless	I do: http://pastebin.com/Bd2rmVq2
2012-11-10T06:22:00.000Z	breiak	dauntless	does that help?
2012-11-10T06:22:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	not exactly what we wanted,  -- the thing is, 12.10 is very recent and it _should_ work, but if for some weird reason the kernel doesn't support the audio chipset that could be your problem
2012-11-10T06:23:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	have you ever had linux on this box with audio working?
2012-11-10T06:23:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	what release?
2012-11-10T06:24:00.000Z	breiak	dauntless	I think 10.10
2012-11-10T06:26:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	sounds like 12.10 might have an issue, or you don't have the proper driver installed or config is messed up
2012-11-10T06:29:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	when you did the dmidecode, did you find a string with motherboard? you are looking for a Motherboard model
2012-11-10T06:30:00.000Z	breiak	dauntless	I pastebinned everything that was there, that was it :/
2012-11-10T06:33:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	this might be of help: http://askubuntu.com/questions/25430/audio-not-working
2012-11-10T06:34:00.000Z	dauntless	breiak	also, have you tried headphones? I know it might seem counterintuitive.
