2006-05-27T13:15:00.000Z	holycow		the rest you download off the net if you need to, but its 1 cd's wort of everything to get you started
2006-05-27T13:15:00.000Z	holycow		debian is like 1/3rd of a cd for netinstall
2006-05-27T13:15:00.000Z	holycow		well you don't need all 14
2006-05-27T13:16:00.000Z	holycow		you dl them if you need alocal copy of EVERYTHING
2006-05-27T13:16:00.000Z	holycow		if you put ubuntu onto cds it would be the same number as debian
2006-05-27T13:16:00.000Z	holycow		but no one here will long enough to actually try every single debian package
2006-05-27T13:16:00.000Z	holycow		thus one only needs 1 cd
2006-05-27T13:18:00.000Z	holycow		it just freezes debian unstable every 6 months
2006-05-27T13:19:00.000Z	holycow		sure but its not really a separate distro in the sense that other debian forks are
2006-05-27T13:19:00.000Z	spikeb	holycow	just because it forks more than once doesn't make it a spoon ;)
2006-12-23T15:07:00.000Z	holycow	spikeb	do you know if they are just removing the non free stuff or making other modifications beyond say artwork?
2006-12-23T15:07:00.000Z	spikeb	holycow	the default installation has a couple different packages, they removed launchpad integration, stripped teh kernel of binary-only bits in it...i think that's about it
2006-12-23T15:08:00.000Z	holycow	spikeb	thats neat, thanks
2006-12-23T15:09:00.000Z	holycow	spikeb	i think the ubuntu approach is the right compromise
2006-12-23T15:09:00.000Z	spikeb	holycow	generally speaking, i agree.
2006-12-23T15:10:00.000Z	spikeb	holycow	i do think that something like gnewsense is a valuable niche and resource though, so i hope they stick around and prosper.
2006-12-23T15:10:00.000Z	holycow	spikeb	funny, i agree with that
2006-12-23T15:11:00.000Z	spikeb	holycow	:)
