2012-09-21T04:31:00.000Z	miraj	ethern0t	: that sounds definitely like uefi parition table that ubuntu isn't reading
2012-09-21T04:31:00.000Z	ethern0t	miraj	i think it is
2012-09-21T04:31:00.000Z	ethern0t	miraj	but there is not alot of info about it on web
2012-09-21T04:32:00.000Z	miraj	ethern0t	: when you installed Win 8, did it give you any partition-creating options to choose from?
2012-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	ethern0t	miraj	yeap
2012-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	ethern0t	miraj	i ve created the partition there since it was a blank hdd
2012-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	miraj	ethern0t	: you might have to reinstall Win 8 with a standard partition table
2012-09-21T04:34:00.000Z	ethern0t	miraj	or set it back to 7, since no difference to me. but thanks for your attention
2012-09-21T04:35:00.000Z	miraj	ethern0t	: I'm pretty sure othert people have been able to install linux with uefi parititions
