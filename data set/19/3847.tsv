2009-05-16T01:27:00.000Z	soreme		hi all, my ubuntu does not recognize COM ports (serials), why?
2009-05-16T01:28:00.000Z	izzle	soreme	you might need to probe a kernel module ....
2009-05-16T01:28:00.000Z	soreme	izzle	should i recompile the kernel then?
2009-05-16T01:28:00.000Z	izzle	soreme	not if you can just build a module
2009-05-16T01:28:00.000Z	soreme		ah ok
2009-05-16T01:28:00.000Z	izzle	soreme	the whole purpose of modules
2009-05-16T01:29:00.000Z	soreme		sorry i am not very sklilled in technical things
2009-05-16T01:29:00.000Z	soreme		*skilled
2009-05-16T01:29:00.000Z	soreme	izzle	yes ok
2009-05-16T01:30:00.000Z	izzle	soreme	i cant help you much because I do not have any com devices... though I recently setup a gameport based joystick and I'm sure the method is similar
2009-05-16T01:30:00.000Z	izzle	soreme	if you modprobe -l .. you might find there is one already
2009-05-16T01:30:00.000Z	soreme	izzle	thank you anyone but i think i will try to focus on the italian channel, because it's more easy for me to follow the whole thing
2009-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	soreme	izzle	*anyway
2009-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	soreme		not anyone LOL

2009-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	soreme	izzle	I don't get any solution from the italian channel i will return here
2009-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	soreme		thanks
2009-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	soreme		*IF I
