2005-04-19T06:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	thaks for that
2005-04-19T10:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	it's not included in Ubuntu
2005-04-20T08:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	yeah you have more control over your users
2005-06-12T07:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	usually you start or stop them by typing /etc/init.d/servicename start|stop|restart (most are started when you boot your comp)
2005-06-12T08:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	bye
2006-05-26T07:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	you compile your own kernel ?
2006-05-26T07:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	you don't have all of the proper stuff built into the kernel like filesystem and ide device support..etc
2006-05-26T07:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	did you create an initrd ?
2006-05-26T07:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	there you go :)
2006-05-26T07:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	make sure your filesystems are built in as well as ide support (if that's what your hard drive uses)
2006-05-26T07:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spanglesontoast	it's been abotu 4 years since I compiled a kernel but afaik ide support is not compiled into the kernel proper you have to specifically enable it if your not using an initrd.
