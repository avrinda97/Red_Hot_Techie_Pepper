2009-05-05T06:23:00.000Z	Crash1hd		How much space should i give the swap file
2009-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	Crash1hd		ok so if I give 3 gigs would be too much?
2009-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	bit of a waste for normal usage, imho
2009-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	Crash1hd	mzz	I have 3 gigs of ram
2009-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	but if that's what the automatic partitioner suggests just let it do its thing
2009-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	it won't hurt, but it's imho not likely the system will be usable if you run something that makes it use up 3 GiB of swap.
2009-05-05T06:31:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	again, imho 2 GiB or so is more than sufficient
2009-05-05T06:32:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	oh, lifeforce4 has a point, if you intend to suspend/resume you may want a bit more swap
2009-05-05T06:32:00.000Z	Crash1hd	mzz	is that so that you dont runn into any issues that way
2009-05-05T06:32:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	(it'll still suspend with less swap than you have ram as long as not all your ram is in use when you suspend)
2009-05-05T06:33:00.000Z	Crash1hd	mzz	ok :)
2009-05-05T06:33:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	more swap than ram really doesn't make sense if you have multiple GiB of ram imho, and less usually suffices
2009-05-05T06:36:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	that sounds sane
2009-05-05T06:40:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	ext4 is pretty new.
2009-05-05T06:40:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	(meaning there may be bugs lurking that haven't been shaken out yet)
2009-05-05T07:28:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	100MiB is usually plenty imho
2009-05-05T07:28:00.000Z	Crash1hd	mzz	KB1JWQ ok :) any reason to do 200 mb over 100?
2009-05-05T07:29:00.000Z	Crash1hd	mzz	KB1JWQ ahh ok :) I can give it 200mb :) just for the hell of it :)
2009-05-05T07:31:00.000Z	mzz	Crash1hd	if in doubt put it before
