2010-04-02T22:01:00.000Z	dododoo		I cant get to anything on /  only the stuff from busybox.  if I try mount -a it says that cannot read /etc/fstab.  Also, I am on 9.10/dell E6500 and I do have my user dir encrypted
2010-04-02T22:02:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	u need a entry in /etc/fstab for mount -a to work
2010-04-02T22:03:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	better mount with mount -t <type> /dev/<device> /<mount point >
2010-04-02T22:03:00.000Z	dododoo	bogor	I assure you there was one there last night when I went to bed and shutdown
2010-04-02T22:03:00.000Z	dododoo		I've been on 9.10 since Jan
2010-04-02T22:04:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	creating fstab entry is not all that difficult, google it up
2010-04-02T22:05:00.000Z	dododoo	bogor	if it will just mount the root device, it would see all of that
2010-04-02T22:05:00.000Z	dododoo		i didnt change any of that
2010-04-02T22:06:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	Leave worrying about the previous setup, just create a new entry in fstab and enjoy
2010-04-02T22:06:00.000Z	dododoo	bogor	I cant get to fstab or I would do that
2010-04-02T22:07:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	you mean to say there is no fstab inside etc ??
2010-04-02T22:08:00.000Z	dododoo	bogor	from busybox shell, no fstab
2010-04-02T22:09:00.000Z	dododoo	bogor	I am not seeing the same / as I usually see either  I have a /software that is not there either
2010-04-02T22:09:00.000Z	dododoo		I think I may be in a ramdisk busybox shell or something
2010-04-02T22:09:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	I am sure of busybx, i thought you are working with ubuntu
2010-04-02T22:10:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	not sure*
2010-04-02T22:10:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	sory for the typo
2010-04-02T22:10:00.000Z	dododoo	bogor	apparently, if ubuntu fails at boot, it drops into busybox shell
2010-04-02T22:12:00.000Z	bogor	dododoo	I think you are taking about bash shell prompt. What is that about busybox.
