2010-11-22T02:30:00.000Z	ldlework	Gnea	I read that already and it doesn't say what to do if your cam doesn't show up
2010-11-22T02:30:00.000Z	Gnea	ldlework	it says which ones are supported, is your cam in that list?
2010-11-22T02:36:00.000Z	ldlework	Gnea	I'm having a hard time figuring out what my integrated webcam is exactly.
