2006-11-30T17:27:00.000Z	Pie-rate		Can anyone even hear me?
2006-11-30T17:27:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	yes
2006-11-30T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	why don't you use a more up-to-date version? 5.10 won't even be supported anymore in a couple of months
2006-11-30T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	ah ok
2008-01-22T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	releasing "a .deb" doesn't necessarily mean it'll work on all versions of Debian, Ubuntu and whatever distribution uses .deb. many software houses prefer to let the distributions do the packaging job
2008-01-22T19:40:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	ubuntu has failed at packing, then. i'm willing to bet 70-90% of desktop users want flash installed. fixing it should be a higher priority, in my opinion.
2008-01-22T19:41:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	perhaps, but then again it's pretty sad that the Ubuntu package has to actually fetch the tarball from the Adobe file because the license doesn't let them just package the thing.
2008-01-22T19:41:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	agreed
2008-01-22T19:42:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	we need a lawyer to go poke adobe's lawyers a few times
2008-01-22T19:42:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	or we need more programmers to put efforts into Gnash and friends :)
2008-01-22T19:43:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	meh. probably never gonna be perfect. imo adobe should just opensource the thing.
2008-01-22T19:43:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	gnash is kind of like WINE. neither will ever be "done"
2008-01-22T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	Pie-rate	while complicated, i'm sure Flash is still much simpler than the entire Win32 API. anyway, we've strayed way too much offtopic i fear
2008-01-22T19:44:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	although, i guess it is a lot less simple to clone flash
2008-01-22T19:44:00.000Z	Pie-rate	LjL	a lot simpler*
