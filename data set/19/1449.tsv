2011-01-20T09:00:00.000Z	cogsworth		Is there any reason an 8 gig flash drive wouldn't support NTFS formatting
2011-01-20T09:00:00.000Z	cogsworth		I'm trying to format it to NTFS from GParted but it won't let me.
2011-01-20T09:00:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	i find that linux sucks at formatting things in windows formats.
2011-01-20T09:00:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	but what do you mean "it won't let you"
2011-01-20T09:01:00.000Z	cogsworth	rvn	I was able to format a partition to NTFS from the Ubuntu LiveCD.  And I mean it won't let me as in the ntfs selection is grayed out in GParted.
2011-01-20T09:01:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	no idea.
2011-01-20T09:01:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	ah yeah that would do that
2011-01-20T09:04:00.000Z	cogsworth	rvn	I'm having some trouble finding ntfs-utils in the repository, is there any chance you might have it and could point me to it?
2011-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	i don't use the GUI, but you can open up a terminal when you know the exact name of what you want and type "sudo apt-get install <THING>", in this case ntfs-utils
2011-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	i dont use the GUI for the package manager, that is
2011-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	cogsworth	rvn	Yes, I tried looking for it with aptitude and it isn't listed
2011-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	cogsworth	rvn	I searched for "ntfs" and looked under all the utils listed
2011-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	did you try apt-cache search ntfs-utils
2011-01-20T09:06:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	try ntfs-3g-utils
2011-01-20T09:06:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	go with what he says
2011-01-20T09:08:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	both
2011-01-20T09:08:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	the other programs utilize it
2011-01-20T09:08:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	in the background
2011-01-20T09:08:00.000Z	rvn	cogsworth	but you could use it yourself
