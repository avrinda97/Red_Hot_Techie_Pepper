2007-08-17T09:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	ok, what's your output of "uname -m"
2007-08-17T09:56:00.000Z	slavik`lap		if wastrel is jesus, then I am moses :P
2007-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	slavik`lap	therealnanotube	-m, --machine            print the machine hardware name
2007-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	yes, i know what it does. :) i want to know what it outputs on 64bit ubuntu.
2007-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	slavik`lap	therealnanotube	no idea :(
2007-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	slavik`lap	therealnanotube	prolly amd64
2007-08-17T09:58:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	aye, there's the rub. :) that's why i was asking for a 64bit ubuntu user to run "uname -m" for me. :) i /think/ it should output "x86_64", but i'm not sure, since i don't have 64bit ubuntu...
2007-08-17T09:58:00.000Z	slavik`lap	therealnanotube	go to the forums, but why does this matter?
2007-08-17T09:58:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	need it for a script to detect if it's on 64bit ubuntu. :)
2007-08-17T09:58:00.000Z	slavik`lap	therealnanotube	ask in forums :)
2007-08-17T09:59:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	well, i figured, it's such an amazingly quick question, and out of 1000 users here, /one/ dude must be running 64bit... that it would be quicker to come to irc. :) apparently... i was wrong...
2007-08-17T09:59:00.000Z	slavik`lap		cnr = cut down synaptic with a different repo
2007-08-17T09:59:00.000Z	slavik`lap	therealnanotube	but not all 1k pay attention :P
2007-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	indeed. :) so how've you been doing, anyway, dude? :)
2007-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	slavik`lap		meh
2007-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	therealnanotube	slavik`lap	haven't seen you in a while, haven't been around on irc
