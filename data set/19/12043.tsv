2005-12-26T14:32:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		hi all
2005-12-26T14:33:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		I've got a mount problem with a ntfs which worked till now :(
2005-12-26T14:35:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		if I try to mount it it says mount: /dev/hdb1 already mounted or /media/win_e busy _(
2005-12-26T14:37:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		can anybody help me with this ntfs partition; I can't mount it anymore
2005-12-26T14:37:00.000Z	Falstius	NoWhereMan	what changed?
2005-12-26T14:38:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	I really don't know... but I can't browse my files anymore
2005-12-26T14:39:00.000Z	Falstius	NoWhereMan	so if you type say "ls /mnt/myntfsdrive" it doesn't output anything or it says "permission denied" or what?
2005-12-26T14:40:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	 well, ls doesn't output anything... the dir is empty
2005-12-26T14:41:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	I wish it were. It isn't
2005-12-26T14:42:00.000Z	Falstius	NoWhereMan	is the device in /dev?  try ls /dev/hd* (or /dev/sd*) and see if it is there
2005-12-26T14:42:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	yes, it is
2005-12-26T14:44:00.000Z	Falstius	NoWhereMan	have you tried manually mounting it to a different location? "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 -t ntfs /mnt/newplace"?
2005-12-26T14:45:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	tried, no luck :(
2005-12-26T14:45:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	same error
2005-12-26T14:46:00.000Z	Falstius	NoWhereMan	you could try to unload and reload the ntfs driver.
2005-12-26T14:47:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	I already tried to reboot
2005-12-26T14:47:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	how do I load/unload the drv anyway? (meanwhile I installed the ntfsprog package)
2005-12-26T14:48:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	I CAN do a ntfsls -d /dev/hdb1 so the fsystem is accessible
2005-12-26T14:51:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	Falstius	any clue?
