2010-09-01T07:40:00.000Z	avi_		hello, does anyone know if Clonezilla supports ext4 fully?
2010-09-01T07:40:00.000Z	avi_		:P
2010-09-01T07:41:00.000Z	avi_		Yeah, it would be a REAL bummer if it didn't..
2010-09-01T07:41:00.000Z	avi_		Perhaps you could suggest a similar tool? I need to do a backup of my Lucid system, so that when I wipe the HD and reinstall Lucid vanilla, I can just restore to the exact state my computer is in right now.
2010-09-01T07:42:00.000Z	avi_		Partimage won't do it because it can't support ext4.. :/
2010-09-01T07:44:00.000Z	Micheal`	avi_	chack here: http://clonezilla.org/
2010-09-01T07:44:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	That's what I'm angling at right now. Can you personally vouch for it's success?
2010-09-01T07:46:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	Right. But i'm concerned about apps and settings not data.. all my media/documents I have on an external ext4 drive specifically for that. :D
2010-09-01T07:47:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	I mean like, all the apps I've installed, custom settings, server config files, and other settings that (I don't think are in /home/$USER
2010-09-01T07:47:00.000Z	Micheal`	avi_	well cloning the wholedrive wont help you
2010-09-01T07:48:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	Oh no?
2010-09-01T07:48:00.000Z	Micheal`	avi_	well if you clone the whole drive and them reinstall the whole system are you just going to copy parts over?
2010-09-01T07:49:00.000Z	Micheal`	avi_	and if you restore the clone well you gain nothing from reinstalling
2010-09-01T07:50:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	No I don't intend to like "drag" the files over. I am hoping for a system where I can click "backup/clone" in my current install of Lucid, then, after i've wiped the HD and set up the partiton map as I like, install vanilla lucid to the partition i've assigned for it, and simply hit "restore" and walk away. Then I'll come back and my system will be *exactly* as I left it.
2010-09-01T07:50:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	Yes, I should've mentioned that, the reason I'm reinstalling is not about Lucid.. it's actually about OS X.
2010-09-01T07:51:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	But sadly I can't just reinstall the OS X partiton, because OS X
2010-09-01T07:51:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	's restore CD crashes when it has to deal with ext4 cds.
2010-09-01T07:52:00.000Z	Micheal`	avi_	are you looking to duel boot?
2010-09-01T07:55:00.000Z	avi_	Micheal`	Izinucs, Okay. I currently have a tripleboot system that works fine mostly, on my mac. (Win7, Lucid, latest OS X). Except my OS X partition needs to be reinstalled. To do that, because of complications/limitations with Apple's reinstall functions, I need to basically WIPE the whole drive and then set up 3 partitions.. then install OS X+Win7+Lucid. So naturally there's nothing wrong with my Win7 and Lucid partitions, hence my desi
