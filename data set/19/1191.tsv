2011-12-06T05:01:00.000Z	tjkent	wizonesolutions	what is your problem now?
2011-12-06T05:02:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	Trying to get write access as my normal user to an NTFS partition.
2011-12-06T05:02:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	AKA, trying to mount it as such.
2011-12-06T05:03:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	I mount it, but it basically ignores anything I specify about permissoins.
2011-12-06T05:03:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	Mounting works. But the permissions are not as I want.
2011-12-06T05:05:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	Yep, dual-booting.
2011-12-06T05:06:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	File/directory ownership. Users is owned by root/root, so I can't cd in or see anything.
2011-12-06T05:07:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	If it's safe...then I don't really care if it's ntfs-3g or not.
2011-12-06T05:08:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	OK so shoot
2011-12-06T05:09:00.000Z	tjkent	wizonesolutions	did you get it?
2011-12-06T05:17:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	You mentioned rebooting in PM, I just don't understand why I can't umount and then mount -a. What cached data or whatever is getting reinitialized upon reboot? Doesn't it just read from /etc/fstab like mount -a does?
2011-12-06T05:18:00.000Z	tjkent	wizonesolutions	fstab is read when your system boots
2011-12-06T05:19:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	Yeah mount -a and normal mount commands also check it if for example I type "mount /mnt/windows" <--- my mount point
2011-12-06T05:21:00.000Z	tjkent	wizonesolutions	it worked for me
2011-12-06T05:23:00.000Z	tjkent	wizonesolutions	dmesg|less
2011-12-06T05:24:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	It actually was in syslog it seems...one sec
2011-12-06T05:25:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	tjkent	netninja: From log output, almost certain that the POSIX ACLs feature is burning me somehow, just not sure what options to set to disable it...or something. http://pastebin.com/bd685NFN
