2006-08-07T16:47:00.000Z	frying_fish	davin	you prob need the "dev" versions then, look in synaptic
2006-08-07T16:47:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	okay thanks
2006-08-07T16:48:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	okay, its installing nvidia-glx-dev and some mesa- stuff
2006-08-07T16:48:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	lets try this
2006-08-07T16:51:00.000Z	frying_fish	davin	then you probably don't have the correct package yet
2006-08-07T05:35:00.000Z	frying_fish	davin	you say a bin file, do you mean a cd image thats a .bin .cue set?
2006-08-07T05:36:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	nope, i mean an executable, its a Java runtime enviorment installation
2006-10-15T06:59:00.000Z	frying_fish	davin	!grub
2006-10-15T06:59:00.000Z	frying_fish	davin	follow that guide
2006-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	thanks dude
2006-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	do I -need- to use the alternate cd? cant I use the normal/live cd that I got from shipit?
2006-10-15T07:02:00.000Z	davin	frying_fish	Nevermind found it~
