2012-11-06T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	;)
2012-11-06T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	cd /etc/xdg/autostart; sudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' *.desktop
2012-11-06T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	now when you view the items in 'startup items' you will see them all
2012-11-06T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	or install rcconf if it is run in the rc.X folders etc
2012-11-06T06:06:00.000Z	superfake123	ActionParsnip	thank you!
2012-11-20T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	it's in the repos
2012-11-20T11:05:00.000Z	superfake123	ActionParsnip	the latest version is 24, 20. is at least 6 months old I think
2012-11-20T11:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	what is the difference between the versions?
2012-11-20T11:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	so why is the 20 version no good to you?
2012-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	if the only way to get that version on Ubuntu is via PPA, why test using that version?
2012-11-20T11:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	superfake123	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:a-v-shkop/chromium-dev; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install chromium-browser    for ver 25
