2005-08-29T05:03:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	Normally AV on Linux is sued to scan emails that will be retrived by windows clients.
2005-08-29T05:03:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	You won't need AV for Linux itself.
2005-08-29T05:05:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	I'd love to, but they pay the rent...
2005-08-31T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	the idea is that you don't touch it, but pay them to do it.
2005-08-31T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	See, you bought  abrand name PC< therefore you know nothing about computers and will NOT attempt to modify it yourself.
2005-09-17T06:17:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	Athlon XP-M's do have frequency scaling.
2005-09-17T06:17:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	cafuego	any idea how to enable it
2005-09-17T06:17:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	Well, mine does anyway. Mine just loads up acpi and runs powernowd; that's all there was to it.
2005-09-17T06:18:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	cafuego	mine doesn't, it says at startup MAD mobile athlon 4 known _not_ to support cpu frequency scaling
2005-09-17T06:18:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	Mebbe your have an older model, dunno.
2005-09-17T06:19:00.000Z	cafuego	CookedGryphon	Mine goes from 500 MHz to 1.8 Ghz without issues.
