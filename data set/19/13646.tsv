2005-02-18T10:57:00.000Z	bzImage		Does ubuntu support netgear usb wireless out of the box or do I have to find a seperate driver set (seperate drivers shouldnt be a problem for me)
2005-02-18T10:57:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	you'll have to find out what driver it uses; it should be supported.
2005-02-18T10:58:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	madwifi?
2005-02-18T10:59:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	do you know which driver it uses?
2005-02-18T10:59:00.000Z	bzImage	andrewski	No.
2005-02-18T10:59:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	ok, h/o a sec...
2005-02-18T11:00:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	but it is included on ubuntu's installation cd.
2005-02-18T11:01:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	http://www.linux-wlan.org/docs/wlan_adapters.html.gz  look for your card and post back here which chipset it uses...
2005-02-18T11:02:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	that's ok, just let me know which chipset it uses and i'll help you out.
2005-02-18T11:05:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	ok, i don't think madwifi will support it.  (btw, you should probably refer to me by name; your post gets highlighted in my client and it's just good chat etiquette. :)
2005-02-18T11:06:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	do you know which one you have?
2005-02-18T11:06:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	yes, it is. :)
2005-02-18T11:07:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	do you know which version of your netgear card you have?
2005-02-18T11:07:00.000Z	bzImage	andrewski	netgear ma111 wireless adapter, 802.11b, (Prism2/2.5/3 chipset via wlan)
2005-02-18T11:07:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	yes, but you say there are two versions; which one do you have?
2005-02-18T11:08:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	ok, but there are still two versions and that will matter. :)
2005-02-18T11:09:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	now, google for netgear ma111 v1 linux and see what comes up; you're looking for driver or chipset.
2005-02-18T11:10:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	yeah, good call.
2005-02-18T11:11:00.000Z	andrewski	bzImage	refer to me by name, please. :)
