2008-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	norv		who knows if there is a good way to "split" home directories, like having a /home/<user>/extdocs ?
2008-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	norv		where extdocs is on another disk, due to space consideration
2008-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	astro76	norv	all you have to do is make /home/user/extdocs and mount the partition there
2008-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	norv	astro76	well, I guess all I need is per user now, since it's a single user box
2008-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	norv	astro76	so that'll work
2008-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	astro76	norv	or just mount it to /media/something and make a symlink to it in your home
2008-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	norv	astro76	ah, that
2008-02-05T11:12:00.000Z	norv	astro76	I had a problem that when I added a USB thumb drive, grub would just refuse to load with the same error at stage 1.5
2008-02-05T11:13:00.000Z	norv	astro76	I realized it was detecting the thumb drive first and making it hard disk 0 0 or such. lilo seemed to fix this, though I never found out why
2008-02-05T11:14:00.000Z	astro76	norv	but his only happens when he removes the external, leaving only window
2008-02-05T11:14:00.000Z	norv	astro76	yes, it's a different issue
2008-02-05T11:16:00.000Z	norv	astro76	it seems LILO uses uuid or something a little more picky about what drive maps to what number, but that's just my speculation
2008-02-05T11:16:00.000Z	astro76	norv	lilo installs completely to the MBR, not relying on a file in /boot, could be that
2008-02-05T11:17:00.000Z	astro76	norv	or are you talking about your issue.. I'm sleepy and confused ;)
2008-02-05T11:17:00.000Z	norv	astro76	hmm, I was told it still had a staging process because the MBR is too small for any real storage (splash image in LILO?) .. .btw, my issue
2008-05-18T03:29:00.000Z	astro76	norv	yes it uses opengl, and is written with qt for cross-platform... but 32bit afaik
2008-05-18T03:30:00.000Z	norv	astro76	isn't there a trick to run 32-bit stuff?
2008-05-18T03:30:00.000Z	astro76	norv	probably ;)
2008-05-18T03:30:00.000Z	norv	astro76	like a 32-bit usermode Linux, or something
