2010-08-23T21:56:00.000Z	nnilk46		Has anyone here ever had a situation where upgrading grub legacy gets stuck at "Setting up grub-pc (1.96+20080724-12ubuntu2.1) ..." no matter if you try terminal or synaptic, on 9.04, 9.10 and 10.04?
2010-08-23T21:57:00.000Z	nnilk46		I'm battling this right now and I can't find any info on what the problem is :(
2010-08-23T21:58:00.000Z	nnilk46		Hi
2010-08-23T21:59:00.000Z	nnilk46		Can anyone help me with my grub upgrade issue?
2010-08-23T21:59:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 what's the question?
2010-08-23T22:11:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 are your referring to Grub2 upgrade again or another application?
2010-08-23T22:11:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	grub2 again.
2010-08-23T22:12:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 did you specific /dev/hda or /dev/sda when you said install grub .. ..
2010-08-23T22:14:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	I didn't have to specify anything as the defaults "just work" going throught the OS install.
2010-08-23T22:14:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 for upgradeing from Legacy Grub, you ahve to do 3 things: 1)- sudo apt-get install grub2  2) sudo upgrade-from-grub-legacy 3) sudo grub-install /dev/sda  where /dev/sda is your MBR or boot drive.
2010-08-23T22:15:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	That's fine. I get stuck in step 1.
2010-08-23T22:15:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 open the package manager, seach for grub-pc and install that from there.
2010-08-23T22:16:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	I'm tellin' ya, I've tried doing that many times. The process keeps freezing up part way in. :-/
2010-08-23T22:18:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 then it sounds like a pkg manager problem, not so much a Grub2 problem. You having trouble whit any other packages installing ?
2010-08-23T22:19:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	Not really. Everything else works just fine. Even upgrading the OS from 9.04 all the way to 10.04 works fine. I don't know how to figure out what is causing the pkg manager to seize up on grub2.
2010-08-23T22:23:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	If I forcefully quit from it, and go to start the grub2 upgrade again, it'll complain that the previous process did not complete and to run a certain command (sorry, can't remember atm) and it just ends up right where it left off, and does not finish.
2010-08-23T22:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	 sudo aptitude install grub-pc  failes to instlal correct?
2010-08-23T22:24:00.000Z	nnilk46	KE1HA	yeah.
2010-08-23T22:25:00.000Z	KE1HA	nnilk46	see PM
