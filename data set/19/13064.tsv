2005-06-17T08:35:00.000Z	toran		anyone know of a good graphical tool to use to [re] format a harddrive?
2005-06-17T08:35:00.000Z	toran		blech
2005-06-17T08:35:00.000Z	toran		I'll see if I can get it to work again
2005-06-17T08:36:00.000Z	toran		ooh, I haven't tried gparted
2005-06-17T08:36:00.000Z	toran		I'll check it out
2005-06-17T08:36:00.000Z	toran		I sometimes prefer the GTK interfaces to things
2005-06-17T08:36:00.000Z	toran		thanks :)
2005-06-17T08:36:00.000Z	toran		it's not my main hard drive, I'm hoping I won't need too much luck
2005-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	toran		ok, when I try to unmount my hard drive it says "device busy". how can I check what I have happening on that hard drive?
2005-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	toran		I closed all windows and changed out of that directory in all my terminals, and it still says busy
2005-06-17T08:39:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	Maybe the hal-daemon is in the way.
2005-06-17T08:40:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	You could try.
2005-06-17T08:40:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	Maybe run sync a couple of times then retry.
2005-06-17T08:41:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	What filesystem do you want tu unmount?
2005-06-17T08:41:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	What's your cwd?
2005-06-17T08:42:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	try: lsof | grep -i '/old'
2005-06-17T08:43:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	lsof. not sof
2005-06-17T08:43:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	nope..
2005-06-17T08:43:00.000Z	klaas_	toran	any results?
