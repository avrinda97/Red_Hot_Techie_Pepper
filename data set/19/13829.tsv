2005-06-18T12:28:00.000Z	ksoze		okee
2005-06-18T12:28:00.000Z	ksoze		heh
2005-06-18T12:29:00.000Z	ksoze		I need sleep with female
2005-06-18T12:29:00.000Z	ksoze		but more, I need a good audio recoding program
2005-06-18T12:30:00.000Z	ksoze		haven't tried it
2005-06-18T12:30:00.000Z	ksoze		Is there a good place to find a fairly canonical listing of what sound programs exist as packages for ubuntu?
2005-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	spunout	ksoze	audacity seems like the goods
2005-06-18T12:31:00.000Z	ksoze		and where is that to be found?
2005-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	ksoze		I had a strange thing happen.  the add/remove programs util asked for a password, and the root password didn't work, but my user password did
2005-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	ksoze		ahhhh
2005-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	ksoze		cool
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		it is?
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		so what is the root pwd for, then?
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	spunout		apt-cache search sound | less
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		I mean, the once with the root account
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		the one, rather
2005-06-18T12:35:00.000Z	ksoze	bob2	is that a good thing?
2005-06-18T12:35:00.000Z	ksoze		I read the article you pointed to, but I'm not sure why root had to be nuked.  I like the use of sudo, but can't it be handy sometimes to have good ol' root?
2005-06-18T12:36:00.000Z	spunout	ksoze	then you just sudo su
