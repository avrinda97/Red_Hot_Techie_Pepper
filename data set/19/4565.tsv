2009-12-05T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	what has win32 hosts got to do with it ?
2009-12-05T02:00:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	The host upon which the connection is served ...
2009-12-05T02:00:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	Trick question?
2009-12-05T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	doesn't matter
2009-12-05T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	the host is not important as long as the keyus are compatible
2009-12-05T02:01:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	I'm pretty sure that different platforms conform to the RFC in different ways ...
2009-12-05T02:01:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	40 bit.
2009-12-05T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	as long as the client is compatible with the encyription level it shouldn't be a problem
2009-12-05T02:02:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	Great, but I've encountered some issues connecting to a Win32 host from Ubuntu 9.10.
2009-12-05T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	I've not seen - or had such problems
2009-12-05T02:03:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	Good for you then :)
2009-12-05T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	then don't ask if people are having problems if you don't want the answer
2009-12-05T02:03:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	Your hostility amuses.
2009-12-05T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	I'm not being hostile, you asked if people where having problems - I'm telling you I'm not
2009-12-05T02:04:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	I'm glad, that you speak for "people"
2009-12-05T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	then why are you asking if you don't want people to respond
2009-12-05T02:05:00.000Z	veda	ikonia	I think your "bad day" shouldn't rub off on IRC.
2009-12-05T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	veda	I'm not having a bad day, I've just answered your question, it's working fine, I'm not aware of any problems
