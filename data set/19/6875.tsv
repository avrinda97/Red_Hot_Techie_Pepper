2008-05-08T23:07:00.000Z	Mimi		*SIGH* ... anyone know why    /dev/sdb1 /media/USB\040Drive ntfs-3g defaults,force,locale=en_CA.UTF-8 0 0        is not being mounted at boot?
2008-05-08T23:09:00.000Z	Mimi		#python
2008-05-08T23:09:00.000Z	Mimi		!enter
2008-05-08T23:10:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	what does it say when you boot up? There should be an error message
2008-05-08T23:11:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	try: dmesg | grep sdb1
2008-05-08T23:12:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	what happens when you execute: sudo mount -a
2008-05-08T23:13:00.000Z	Mimi	Vlet	   no output why
2008-05-08T23:13:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	because that basically mounts everything in fstab, so if your drive was unmounted and you execute that, you should see an error
2008-05-08T23:14:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	if the line you put in fstab didn't work, you'd see an error, so are you SURE it's not mounted?
2008-05-08T23:16:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	hmm... paste your /etc/fstab in here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2008-05-08T23:16:00.000Z	Mimi	Vlet	   /dev/sdb1 /media/USB\040Drive ntfs-3g defaults,force,users 0 0
2008-05-08T23:16:00.000Z	Mimi	Vlet	 before you go there, YES ive tried it without spaces, YES, the folders do exists
2008-05-09T01:36:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	Why not just put the mount command in your login script
2008-05-09T01:38:00.000Z	Vlet	Mimi	if it does, then you can just give your account permissions to execute that command with sudoers (man sudoers)
