2007-04-19T08:38:00.000Z	Angel-SL	AlexC_	its just a home server in my NAT i like to fiddle with

2007-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	Angel-SL	AlexC_	theres only 1 difference right?
2007-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	Angel-SL	AlexC_	just it doesn't have the X window right?
2007-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	Angel-SL		and gnome
2007-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	AlexC_	Angel-SL	Server comes with no Gnome, no X, no GUI apps and is more server orientated,
2007-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	AlexC_	Angel-SL	which you don't need for a server, so you may as well just install Server
2007-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	Angel-SL	AlexC_	does it have a smaller size?
2007-04-19T08:40:00.000Z	AlexC_	Angel-SL	smaller install size, yes afaik
