2009-06-17T03:49:00.000Z	SeaPhor		In 8.04 in System>Preferences>Remote Desktop there is an "Advanced " Tab where you could choose an alternate port, ITS gone in 9.04, so how do you choose to receive RDP on an alternate port now?
2009-06-17T03:51:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	: ip:port maybe ?
2009-06-17T03:51:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	where?
2009-06-17T03:51:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	where would the .conf file be for RDP?
2009-06-17T03:51:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	: sry ... receive RDP ???? receive VNC maybe ..... start RDP ... there's no RDP "receiving" on *nix
2009-06-17T03:52:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	that is understood, but the question remains the same
2009-06-17T03:52:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	: let me search on google.
2009-06-17T03:53:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	thank, i have to my wits end, it is only on 9.04, i have been doing this config since 7.04
2009-06-17T03:54:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	: In GConf. You can change it from gconf-editor. Go to apps/vinagre from it.

2009-06-17T04:01:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	please look at this, i dont see it... http://imagebin.ca/view/2kMe1bLh.html
2009-06-17T04:14:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	apparently suggestions on launchpad aren't very helpful .... try under /desktop/gnome/remote_access
2009-06-17T04:15:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	will do,,, thank you for your time
2009-06-17T04:16:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	: just helping where someone before helped me . try to reestablish the "balance" (very zen)
2009-06-17T04:17:00.000Z	Niphlod	SeaPhor	: I have an "alternative_port" value under that , but I'm on intrepid. I'm just guessing (and hoping) it's in that place too in jaunty
2009-06-17T04:17:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	oh, in the gconf, siorry
2009-06-17T04:18:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Niphlod	Got It! thats it,,, U-D-Man bro...
