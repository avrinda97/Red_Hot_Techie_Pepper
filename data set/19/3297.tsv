2010-05-03T18:13:00.000Z	WXZ		if you right click your panel, there's an option called "add panel"
2010-05-03T18:15:00.000Z	WXZ		is there a way to change the screen resolution in vbox
2010-05-03T18:16:00.000Z	WXZ		without actually changing the screen size
2010-05-03T18:17:00.000Z	WXZ		which version are you using agionz?
2010-05-03T18:18:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	Install the guest additions in the guest os, then you can simply resize the vbox window to resize the vbox's screen.
2010-05-03T18:19:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	What is the guest os?
2010-05-03T18:20:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	I though that's what you meant.
2010-05-03T18:20:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	I don't think it can scale it
2010-05-03T18:23:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	If you change your host resolution to 1024x768, then run the XP guest in fullscreen, it should look right. I don't know any other way.
2010-05-03T18:24:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	Oh, you want the guest to show up in 1280x1024? but it really shows up in 1024x768?   You might have to give the vm more video memory.
2010-08-17T15:33:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	I recommend using gnome-schedule to run graphical apps in cron
2010-08-17T15:35:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	And now crontab -l is showing some python stuff and xwrapper.py, right?
2010-08-17T15:36:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	You need to wait more than a minute.
2010-08-17T15:37:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	It could take a minute for cron to notice the new cronjob
2010-08-17T15:44:00.000Z	WXZ	geirha	nope, didn't work
2010-08-17T15:46:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	Should have worked. No idea why it didn't. :/
2010-09-12T15:27:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	You can use shred(1) to overwrite the harddrive several times
2012-06-28T11:54:00.000Z	geirha	WXZ	app >/dev/null 2>&1 &
