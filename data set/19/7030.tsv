2007-10-21T00:52:00.000Z	tharvey		the dual screen gui seems a bit schitzo about what it calls Screen1 and Screen2
2007-10-21T00:53:00.000Z	tharvey		ok, I'll check out /etc/X11/xorg.conf - so if you end up in a situation where you can't see GDM b/c its being displayed on a card that has no display attached are there any keybindings you can hit to switch or something?
2007-10-21T00:54:00.000Z	tharvey		virtual text consoles don't work for some reason... I figured ubuntu disabled them?
2007-10-21T00:54:00.000Z	tharvey		never mind, my bad - keyboard f-key issue
2007-10-21T00:55:00.000Z	tharvey		ok, so next big issue - I run 'terminal' from apps->excessories and it starts a process called 'starting terminal' which then just goes away leaving no terminal - any ideas?
2007-10-21T00:57:00.000Z	tharvey		during install I was never asked for a root passwd - so what is root's passwd?
2007-10-21T00:59:00.000Z	tharvey		sudo requires a root acct - I guess you mean root login is disabled for ubuntu?
2007-10-21T01:00:00.000Z	tharvey		ok thx
2007-10-21T01:01:00.000Z	tharvey		I haven't found any docs on ubuntu site for 7.10 - is it b/c it just was released - should the 6.04 docs be pretty sufficient?
2007-10-21T01:02:00.000Z	tharvey		also I'm not finding common packages for install such as vmware-player for 7.10 - are they just not available yet?
2007-10-21T01:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	tharvey	vmware player isn't in the repos anymore
2007-10-21T01:03:00.000Z	tharvey	dystopianray	does the std download from vmware work without any issues? (no vmware-any-any required to rebuild kernel mods?)
2007-10-21T01:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	tharvey	it works fine, run the installer script and it configures itself and compiles its own module
2007-10-21T01:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	tharvey	although you'll want build-essential before you install it
2007-10-21T01:04:00.000Z	tharvey	dystopianray	ok - what is 'build-essential'?  a script that installs with vmware player?
2007-10-21T01:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	tharvey	no it is a package that will allow you to compile C programs
2007-10-21T01:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	tharvey	the essential package for buiding anything
2007-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	tharvey	dystopianray	oh - ok... all prereqs for software devel
2007-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	tharvey	basically
