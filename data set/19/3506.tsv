2009-08-07T05:25:00.000Z	jiohdi		if you use alt-ctrl f1 what do you type to return to gnome?
2009-08-07T05:25:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	alt ctrl F7
2009-08-07T05:27:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	if something has locked up... how do I find it in terminal (alt-ctrl-f1) to shut it down?
2009-08-07T05:28:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	what something is it? if it is an application use ps aux|grep applicationname  .. but what exactly is locked up?
2009-08-07T05:28:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	I was running firefox in wine and it locked up everything but the cursor, I could get to terminal but did not know what to do from there
2009-08-07T05:30:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	you could kill wine? ps aux| grep wine  then kill -9 theFirstsetofnumbers
2009-08-07T05:30:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	are you one gnome?
2009-08-07T05:31:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	yes, I am using ubuntu and from what I have read, it is gnome, right?
2009-08-07T05:31:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	yes it is gnome.. if killing wine doesn't help you could restart gnome with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-08-07T05:32:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	thanks... I found that one online, but that is like a soft reboot
2009-08-07T05:32:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	somewhat, it just kills gnome and restarts X. you don't actually restart the box just X
2009-08-07T05:33:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	yup, its a good quick reboot better than a full reboot, but it would be nice to kill just the offending program
2009-08-07T05:33:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	 have you tried to kill wine?
2009-08-07T05:34:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	the problem has past, I am trying to increase my understanding for next time :)
2009-08-07T05:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	running firefox in wine doesn't make a lot of sense. it runs great natively.
2009-08-07T05:35:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	not with ms oriffice lies... it refuses linux
2009-08-07T05:35:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	firefox in wine works just fine with office live
2009-08-07T05:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jiohdi	 ah. good luck
2009-08-07T05:36:00.000Z	jiohdi	bastidrazor	I would not bother but that I have a webpage that I need to fix from time to time and cannot do it from native linux
