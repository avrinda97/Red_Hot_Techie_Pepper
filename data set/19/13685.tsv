2008-04-23T22:22:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	i don't use ATi but you may have better results with newer drivers installed through envyng. 'sudo apt-get install envyng'
2008-04-23T22:24:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	enable the universe repo. !universe
2008-04-23T22:37:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	'sudo apt-get install envyng'
2008-04-23T22:41:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	how about 'sudo apt-get install envy' ?
2008-04-23T22:42:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	what release of ubuntu are you using?
2008-04-23T22:43:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	enable the universe repository in /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-04-23T22:43:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	after that, 'sudo apt-get update' then try to install envyng again
2008-04-23T22:52:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	try getting it directly from the site
2008-04-23T22:52:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	choose envy legacy, download the .deb, install it
2008-04-23T22:55:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	sudo apt-get install python-central
2008-04-23T22:57:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	did you get envy legacy and not envyng??
2008-04-23T22:57:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	now read here to find out what it means: http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelHacking :-)
2008-04-23T23:33:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	you got envy installed?
2008-04-23T23:33:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	did you try to install your driver with it?
2008-04-23T23:35:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	cp xorg.conf? to where?
2008-04-23T23:37:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	you have to edit xorg.conf depending on which driver you use
2008-04-23T23:39:00.000Z	Boohbah	sploby	no, envy is a script to install drivers
