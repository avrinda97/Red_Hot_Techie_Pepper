2007-03-27T12:56:00.000Z	titun		hello all, I just installed UBUNTU 6.10 few hours ago
2007-03-27T12:56:00.000Z	titun		how do I know if I have gcc compiler or not
2007-03-27T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	you don't.  install "build-essential", then you will
2007-03-27T12:57:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	how to do so ?
2007-03-27T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	yes.  You might need to still get specific libraries for certain programs though
2007-03-27T13:23:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	Ok, let me get started, I have only option to compile, run programs from terminal right
2007-03-27T13:24:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	for a IDE I need something like Eclipse, am I correct
2007-03-27T13:24:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	Uh, sure.  Although, a text editor can be an IDE as well.
2007-03-29T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	because apt doesn't do anything.  There is no 'apt' command
2007-03-29T13:43:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	ohkey
2007-05-10T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	pidgin isn't in the repositories, so that's not unexpected.
2007-05-10T12:12:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	yes, its not in the repositories
2007-05-10T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	find a deb that works with feisty, or just use GAIM beta 6
2007-05-10T12:13:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	i have the deb for Feisty , but this dependeny on libc6 killing me
2007-05-10T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	that deb isn't really for feisty.
2007-05-10T12:14:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	humm...... ok
2007-05-10T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	if it was, it wouldn't depend on that, it'd be for the feisty version of libc6 (2.5-0ubuntuN)
2007-05-10T12:15:00.000Z	titun	Flannel	right
2007-07-07T12:22:00.000Z	Flannel	titun	the Bitstream family (bitstream vera, etc)
