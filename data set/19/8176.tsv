2008-06-27T10:48:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX		can someone recommend a video player other than Totem or VLC?
2008-06-27T10:49:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX		I am spamming?
2008-06-27T10:49:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	vlc
2008-06-27T10:49:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	oh. well vlc is awesome
2008-06-27T10:49:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	I agree that VLC is awsome, but unfortunately audio is not working for me and Totem just won't play the video at all
2008-06-27T10:50:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	u don't have it configured then. go to the configuration and change the audio output to the correct one
2008-06-27T10:51:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	I configured it to use the pulse audio plugin is that not enough?
2008-06-27T10:51:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	do you have pulseaudio?
2008-06-27T10:52:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	I don't really know, I am on Hardy Heron if that helps
2008-06-27T10:53:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	use default audio output
2008-06-27T10:54:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	no luck
2008-06-27T10:54:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	what audio driver are you using?
2008-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	I don't know, how can I check?
2008-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	i would guess you are using alsa so: sudo apt-get install alsa-oss
2008-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	if you don't know you are using alsa
2008-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	vlc is an oss app so you need to install alsa-oss
2008-06-27T10:55:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	I am installing it now
2008-06-27T10:56:00.000Z	Skipp_OSX	WhoNeedszzz	and suddenly sound works, thank you WhoNeedszzz
2008-06-27T10:56:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	Skipp_OSX	no problem :D
