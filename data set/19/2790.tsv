2010-11-24T06:07:00.000Z	linguinii		Every time I want to use skype after restarting my computer, to get my microphone to work, I have to go to System > Preferences > Sound > Hardware , select my Internal Audio (the other choice being my web cam), select input, and change a value.  Is there some way to make this change permanent?
2010-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	Are you saving your ALSA settings at any point?
2010-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	Not that I know of.  skype says "pulseaudio"...
2010-11-24T06:09:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	In skype, my microphone is "PulseAudio server (local)"
2010-11-24T06:09:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	If you are setting mixer settings etc.. you should save your ALSA settings at some point.. although I'm not sure how.  ALSA settings wouldn't be in skype..the would be in the mixer, or on the command-line.
2010-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	Are ALSA and pulse audio mutually exclusive?  Or am I getting mixed up with something else (OSS or something?).
2010-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	ALSA are the mixer settings.. Pulseaudio is just an output driver.  Two separate pieces that work towards the send end result.
2010-11-24T06:12:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	Oh, I think I misread; I am not setting mixer settings.
2010-11-24T06:12:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	You described changing mixer settings for your microphone etc.. I assumed you meant in ALSAmixer.
2010-11-24T06:13:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	I'm changing The "connector" value in the Input tab of "Sound Preferences" [I think]
2010-11-24T06:13:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	I don't know why skype wouldn't save your prefs.  Perhaps you don't have write access to the configuration file?
2010-11-24T06:14:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	it is not skype settings; it is System > Preferences > Sound
2010-11-24T06:15:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	OK.. so those would be alsa settings.. but it's very strange that it doesn't remember them if you're using a system control panel.
2010-11-24T06:16:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	And actually she might be changing the device from "0802 Analog Mono" to "Internal Audio Analog Stereo".  I'll ask for sure.
2010-11-24T06:18:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	Oops, I was wrong.  She changes the device from "Internal Audio Analog Device" to "0802 Analog Mono"
2010-11-24T06:19:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	analog mono? icky poo!  It might change that back because it's a mono driver.
2010-11-24T06:19:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	so is that the "alsa device setting" I am changing?
2010-11-24T06:20:00.000Z	heebie	linguinii	It might not be.
2010-11-24T06:26:00.000Z	linguinii	heebie	Maybe I'll try getting a different microphone device to work (I think it defaults to the one in the MB rather than the one in the web cam)
