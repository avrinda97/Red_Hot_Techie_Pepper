2010-01-13T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	You can watch youtube videos in Totem Movie Player

2010-01-13T12:25:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	do i have to download them first?
2010-01-13T12:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	There is a youtube plugin that comes with Totem ( Applications > Sound and Video > Movie player ) that lets you browse and watch youtube videos
2010-01-13T12:26:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	okay, where can I find instructions to set that up?
2010-01-13T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	Do you see the drop down menu at the top right in totem that says "Playlist" ?
2010-01-13T12:28:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	just a sec.
2010-01-13T12:29:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	i guess i don't have totem installed, just reinstalled karmic today
2010-01-13T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	It comes by default unless you are using kubuntu
2010-01-13T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	It's just called "Movie Player" in the menu though
2010-01-13T12:30:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	All I show is movie player under Sound & Video
2010-01-13T12:31:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	EastDallas: got movie player open i see PlayList
2010-01-13T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	Click that drop down menu and chose "youtube"
2010-01-13T12:32:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	done
2010-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	Is that all there is to it?
2010-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NamVet	Yes
2010-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	NamVet	Jordan_U	Unreal been struggling w/ this for about 5 hrs. Thanx ever so much.
