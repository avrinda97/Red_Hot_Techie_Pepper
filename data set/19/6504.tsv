2011-04-17T21:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	very
2011-04-17T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	any will do
2011-04-17T22:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	did you change the pwd to the folder you downloaded the file to?
2011-04-17T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	so if you run: ls     do you see the file (LS in lowercase)
2011-04-17T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	that is moot
2011-04-17T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	do you see the file?
2011-04-17T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	yes, its a command, run it
2011-04-17T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	and do you see smart.deb ?
2011-04-17T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	ok then run: sudo dpkg -i ./smart.deb
2011-04-17T22:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	no, as long as you can see the file it will be ok. You can also doubleclick the file in GUI if you have one
2011-04-17T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	not sure,if ls shows the file it is in pwd so ./filename will make it work, only thing I can think of is case sensitivity
2011-04-17T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	in what sense?
2011-04-17T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	uname -m   will show arch
2011-04-17T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	lsb_release -a    will show release
2011-04-17T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	i686 = 32bit     x86_64 = 64bit
2011-04-17T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haitham	possibly, if you are using the wrong arch it won't install
