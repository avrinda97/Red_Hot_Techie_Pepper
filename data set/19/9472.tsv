2006-11-10T09:40:00.000Z	what_if	flodine	i'm told theres still a problem there

2006-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	what_if	flodine	yes
2006-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	what_if		i've heard of that working... could also try 'gnash' instead. it is reported to work 64 bit mode
2006-11-10T09:42:00.000Z	what_if		does anyone know hot to get  '/dev/net/tun' to show up as a network device ??
2006-11-10T09:42:00.000Z	flodine	what_if	does it really run better on 64 bit i never tried it
2006-11-10T09:43:00.000Z	what_if	flodine	the system or firex for or ... ?
2006-11-10T09:43:00.000Z	flodine	what_if	 system
2006-11-10T09:43:00.000Z	what_if		no noticable difference for every day apps
2006-11-10T09:44:00.000Z	flodine	what_if	 i always have 32 bit on my 64 bit chip
2006-11-10T09:44:00.000Z	what_if	flodine	you will notice a difference in 64bit 3d games (slight) and a big difference in 64 bit math
2006-11-10T09:45:00.000Z	what_if	flodine	unless you do intense math with large numbers, then no real big difference (except bragging rights) ;)
2006-11-10T09:46:00.000Z	flodine	what_if	 so i should just stay with 32 bit edgy if no diffrence
2006-11-10T09:47:00.000Z	what_if	flodine	unless you have a reason to go 64bit then 32bit has better software support (flash, etc )
