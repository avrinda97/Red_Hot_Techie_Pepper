2005-09-12T06:07:00.000Z	marcin_ant		btw who else thinks that synaptic UI sucks and is absolutely non intuitive?
2005-09-12T06:07:00.000Z	aftertaf	marcin_ant	 you get to learn it....
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	aftertaf	marcin_ant	 anything can be easily confiduing for newbies..... we can't baby sit them though.... not that much.
2005-09-12T06:16:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	I don't agree with you but it's just my opinion
2005-09-12T06:16:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	it depends on target
2005-09-12T06:17:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	if you want to provide linux desktop for all - and target is 'everyone' then you have to provide something for 'dumb' users too
2005-09-12T06:18:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	personally I don't care - my favourite tool is ion3 and emacs and I don't like all these sweet candy gnome/kde things
2005-09-12T06:18:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	but I also have customers and I try to replace windows with ubuntu on their desktops
2005-09-12T06:19:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	and these users are for example 40-50 yr old managers used to windows/office/excel things.. they don't have will and time to learn things they don't need
2005-09-12T06:20:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	sometimes it is not their choice
2005-09-12T06:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	marcin_ant	 in that case they don't need linux.
2005-09-12T06:24:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	ok go to your 'virtual' world and live in your linux gurus clan forver
2005-09-12T06:25:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	in the real world it is very often that your employer want's to reduce cost
2005-09-12T06:26:00.000Z	aftertaf	marcin_ant	 you dont know me, or what i am like. WHo are you to speak to anybody you don't know anything ?
2005-09-12T06:26:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	and voila you get brand new laptop for your work but suprise - no windows - just ubuntu and open office
2005-09-12T06:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	then stop to talk like 'linux guru' from dark ages ;)
2005-09-12T06:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	sorry anyway
2005-09-12T06:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	today linux goes on desktops and goes to everyone so it has to be _easy_
2005-09-12T06:28:00.000Z	marcin_ant	aftertaf	ok
