2006-12-28T17:15:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	sure
2006-12-28T17:13:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	yep
2006-12-28T17:14:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	go ahead and paste it on paste.ubuntu-nl.org. then paste the URL to your paste here
2006-12-28T17:08:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	misconfigured interface maybe?
2006-12-28T17:12:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	I have some experience with networking, could it be some obscure problem? It is working at another DCHCP server (a router at my home)
2006-12-28T17:13:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	hmm. the same interface is working with another dhcp server?
2006-12-28T17:13:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	paste /etc/network/interfaces on paste.ubuntu-nl.org and I'll see if I can spot anything
2006-12-28T17:20:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39137/    (transcibed)
2006-12-28T17:20:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	which one is your interface?
2006-12-28T17:21:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	eth0
2006-12-28T17:21:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	it looks broken. let me try fixing it
2006-12-28T17:21:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	ok
2006-12-28T17:22:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	remove lines 6 to 8. please back up the file first though
2006-12-28T17:23:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	then try sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0 and see if it works
2006-12-28T17:23:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	I think I have tried without those, thing is, in the network settings the static IP is saved (they are inactive when you have DHCP from the combobox)
2006-12-28T17:23:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	i.e. I have tried without those lines
2006-12-28T17:24:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	please try what I suggested. then don't mess with network settings afterwards
2006-12-28T17:24:00.000Z	Enselic	mwe	ill give it a shot       i will disconnect from here to try, be back in a few minutes
2006-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	mwe	Enselic	if you look at /etc/network interfaces, are those lines gone now?
