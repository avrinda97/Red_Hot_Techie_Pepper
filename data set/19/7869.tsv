2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	TheCougar		how would i go about installing synergy on ubuntu desktop?
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	it's in repos right?
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	TheCougar		sorry synergy
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	.rpm
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	sudo apt-get install synergy it's in the repos
2007-06-13T12:12:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	i've actaully never installed anything in linux before:) always used ports types of installs
2007-06-13T12:12:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	ahhh ;) you should try to use the Synaptic tool or apt-get or aptitude to install things in ubuntu...
2007-06-13T12:13:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	synaptic tool?
2007-06-13T12:13:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	in System->Administrator menu there should be an option for Synaptic
2007-06-13T12:14:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	use the search option in Synaptic to search for synergy
2007-06-13T12:17:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	thank you
2007-06-13T12:18:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	no problem :) Synaptic can also be used to uninstall software that you decide not to use... have fun!
2007-06-13T12:20:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	one last thing. i delieted the bar (panel?) at the bottom of my screen and have not seen where to put it back on. any suggestions?
2007-06-13T12:21:00.000Z	TheCougar		ha nevermind greyfrog found:)
2007-06-13T12:21:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	cool :) where was the option
2007-06-13T12:22:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	on the bar at the top... now if i don't delete both i should be fine;)
2007-06-13T12:22:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	lol, cool... thanks for the info :)
2007-06-13T12:22:00.000Z	TheCougar	greyfrog	i accidently deleted the multiple desktop thing on the bottom one and in my attempts to figure out what addon for the panel it was i deleted the panel lol
2007-06-13T12:23:00.000Z	greyfrog	TheCougar	at least it was an easy fix ;)
