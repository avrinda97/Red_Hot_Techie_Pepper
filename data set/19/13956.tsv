2005-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	EricNeon		If ubuntulinux could use any truetype fonts as "FireFlySung" for chinese environment,it will better then now in china
2005-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	it surely can.
2005-03-14T08:01:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	yes yes. it may not be totally easy, because there are many complications.
2005-03-14T08:01:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	wait a second...
2005-03-14T08:02:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	consider this tutorial for Debian, it is almost the same under Ubuntu: http://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#i18n
2005-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	looks good to me.
2005-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	no
2005-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	whats the problem? Whats happening that you would like happened differently?
2005-03-14T08:07:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	Nice screenshot, and what's the point?
2005-03-14T08:08:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	again, what's the point?
2005-03-14T08:09:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	whatever, but what do you want to achieve?
2005-03-14T08:10:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	so far you are just making statements. But have you got a specific question to ask?
2005-03-14T08:11:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	if you want to suggest to the Ubuntu developers some new and better fonts for Chinese in Ubuntu, use the Ubuntu bug tracking system to report an issue on the X package.
2005-03-14T08:12:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	I think this will help them. I suspect they dont have much time to look for fonts.
2005-03-14T08:13:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	most distributions in effect don't look too good as to fonts -- there are few good fonts and finding them is not easy.
2005-03-14T08:15:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	there aren't that many really nice chinese fonts that are free, AFAIK.
2005-03-14T08:18:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	note that in order to be distributed by Ubuntu, fonts have to be ''free''.
2005-03-14T08:49:00.000Z	EricNeon	Blissex	,this is my chinese fonts set->  ftp://211.92.88.40/pub/ericneon/
2005-03-14T08:50:00.000Z	Blissex	EricNeon	put that entry into the issue database, as a request for upgrade/fixes.
