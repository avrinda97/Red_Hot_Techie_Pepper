2011-03-22T13:40:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	you'll just have to go through all the config files I guess
2011-03-22T13:41:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	i cant see anything like that on the upstart script or the Xorg config files
2011-03-22T14:36:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	didnt get you there
2011-03-22T14:37:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	different runlevels runlevel 3 command prompt, runlevel 5 Xorg, etc
2011-03-22T14:38:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	i would like to define what each one of them is
2011-03-22T14:39:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	by default, Ubuntu does not differentiate (as far as I know)
2011-03-22T14:40:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	but why would you want to change those numbers?
2011-03-22T14:41:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	a simple shell script will let you change runlevels
2011-03-22T14:45:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	not about changing those numbers
2011-03-22T14:46:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	on ubuntu, ALL runlevels are the same.
2011-03-22T14:46:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	it is about each runlevel, run a different set of computer services, of applications
2011-03-22T14:47:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	any ideas on how to make the same thing ?
2011-03-22T14:47:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	what exactly do you want to do? Configure runlevels?
2011-03-22T14:48:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	exactlly
2011-03-22T14:48:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	have a look: http://www.debianadmin.com/debian-and-ubuntu-linux-run-levels.html
2011-03-22T14:49:00.000Z	czardoz	froes	it has detailed instructions on how to configure :)
2011-03-22T14:52:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	that article is not UPSTART friendly
2011-03-22T14:52:00.000Z	froes	czardoz	if it was, i wasnt haning this problem
