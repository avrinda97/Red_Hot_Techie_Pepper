2009-02-17T03:59:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	you could have installed it with the package manager :-D
2009-02-17T04:00:00.000Z	mads	Myrtti	oh
2009-02-17T04:00:00.000Z	mads		well its installed now :o
2009-02-17T04:00:00.000Z	mads		now I am jsut trying to figure out how to change the .conf file :S
2009-02-17T04:01:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	well, now you also have no sensible/easy way of uninstalling it...
2009-02-17T04:01:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	let this be a lesson, always check package manager first :-)
2009-02-17T04:02:00.000Z	mads	Myrtti	I really feel how easy windows is when I sit on play with ubuntu :o and ubuntu is from what I udnerstand BY FAR the easisets linux distro
2009-02-17T04:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	well you really could have installed that software with one single command
2009-02-17T04:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	and also always keep it updated
2009-02-17T04:04:00.000Z	mads	Myrtti	but how can I try to uninstall it when I have installedi t? I have used http://www.ubuntugeek.com/nzb-par-and-unrar-all-in-one-using-hellanzb.html
2009-02-17T04:04:00.000Z	mads		its installed in exactly those dirs
2009-02-17T04:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	*if* you had done it the way it's supposed to, you could have uninstalled it either with GUI or a single command line option, "sudo aptitude remove hellanzb"... but now... let me look
2009-02-17T04:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	that doesn't tell where it's actually installed to
2009-02-17T04:07:00.000Z	mads		can I search it somehow?
2009-02-17T04:08:00.000Z	mads	Myrtti	cant I jsut use the apt-get and hope it overwrites it? :p
2009-02-17T04:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	sure you can hope, I doubt it though
2009-02-17T04:12:00.000Z	mads	Myrtti	but when its installed with apt-get how do I configure it ? I dont know how to see where it is installed automaticly
2009-02-17T04:12:00.000Z	mads	Myrtti	 and from what I understand it dont have a GUI
2009-02-17T04:13:00.000Z	Myrtti	mads	I suppose the configuration files will be in the same place as with the other one
