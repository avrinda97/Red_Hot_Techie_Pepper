2005-07-14T09:37:00.000Z	youth		someone said to me before that it is possible to get Photoshop 7.0 on here, but I need ..WINE, is this right?
2005-07-14T09:38:00.000Z	Danar	youth	probably. wine is used to run windows apps on linux. there's also cedega which is oriented towards games. it's free if you compile it yourself. search cvscedega. wine should be in the repository
2005-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	Danar	youth	no reason not to have both. sometimes one will run something the other doesn't
2005-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	Danar	youth	wine is more for general apps, cedega for games
2005-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	Danar	youth	nonetheless, some general windows apps are more graphical, and will only work in cedega
2005-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	Danar	youth	the ones that play in the browser?
2005-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	Danar	youth	get the flash & java plugins
2005-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	Danar	youth	you use firefox right?
2005-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	Danar	youth	yeh, there's a plugins faq on mozdev.org
2005-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	Danar	youth	google firefox plugins, and you should find it
2005-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	Danar	youth	java can be a bit of a pain though, so pay attention :p
2005-07-14T09:42:00.000Z	Danar	youth	uh... huh? lol
2005-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	Danar	youth	run 'wine program.exe' in a terminal
2005-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	Danar	youth	you cd to the dir of the program, and run 'wine program.exe'
2005-07-14T11:31:00.000Z	Danar	youth	cd = the change directory command. you need to run it from the same directory the program is in
