2008-11-10T04:56:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	the desktop live cd has a installer that can create bootable USB sticks
2008-11-10T04:56:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	just dont post your question 3 times in 10 seconds. we will try to help
2008-11-10T04:58:00.000Z	SnelGids	zsquareplusc	, ljl at the ubuntu site i see Desktop Edition only
2008-11-10T04:58:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	the desaktop live cd is the normal CD that most users get. boot it on a PC. then you can go to system->admin->create usb disk
2008-11-10T04:58:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	yes, that is the right one
2008-11-10T05:00:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	you could download and burn the iso image and then boot form it? an other way would be booting the iso image in virtualbox or some other virtual machine that supports USB
2008-11-10T05:01:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	no, you dont need to install it. booting from the cd runs a live system without touching your harddrive
2008-11-10T05:01:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	you need to make the stick bootable. that involves a few steps that you have to do manually. but it is possible
2008-11-10T05:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ may work too. but i did not try out this one personally
2008-11-10T05:04:00.000Z	SnelGids	zsquareplusc	what if i do what i said above, plug in my usb disk to my notebook and through my notebook settings i select "boot" and select boot from usb stick
2008-11-10T05:05:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	SnelGids	it does the same as if you would boot from the CD. it starts the live system and gives you the opportunity to install ubuntu if you want
2008-11-10T05:07:00.000Z	SnelGids	zsquareplusc	in referrin to what i said right ??
