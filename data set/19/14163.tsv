2004-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	brettcar		So, how can a guy find out where Ubuntu needs volunteers and help out?
2004-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	brettcar		Yeah I watch some of the lists (not the dev list though)
2004-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	brettcar		But no one is saying we need people here, here and here.
2004-10-30T13:01:00.000Z	brettcar		Okay, I suppose I could :P
