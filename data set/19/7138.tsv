2008-06-22T00:46:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	Lol, why?
2008-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	on ocasion when i push a button in a game on firefox 3 the damn thing lags where it didnt with firefox 2
2008-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 I agree with you.
2008-06-22T00:48:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 Install Firefox 2?
2008-06-22T00:51:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 Be positive able it, no one likes flaming.
2008-06-22T00:51:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	i know, i know
2008-06-22T00:54:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 Are you trying to build a source package?  If so, try "apt -get install build-essential"  should give you what you need.
2008-06-22T00:54:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 oops, "apt-get"
2008-06-22T00:56:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	yeah trying to install xmms onto my ubuntu 64bit. least i think it is ubuntu the start screen says xubuntu *shrugs* and the build-essential has already beejn installed
2008-06-22T00:56:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 Is there no XMMS package for Ubuntu?  Have you tried beep-media-player?
2008-06-22T00:57:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	i LIKE xmms i KNOW xmms i want to stay with xmms but getdebs doesnt have a package and the xmms site only give out the source
2008-06-22T00:57:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 Well, beep-media-player is a rebuild of xmms against GTK2 and some newer libs.. might want to check it out.
2008-06-22T00:58:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	BMPx with add and remove?
2008-06-22T00:58:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	The package used to be called "beep-media-player" but this was like, dapper drake days so I don't know if it's called something else.  Let me check.
2008-06-22T01:18:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 Did you end up installing "build-essential"  -- that should contain glibc
2008-06-22T01:18:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	that was apparently already instralled cause it said it was already up to date when i ran it
2008-06-22T01:18:00.000Z	yowshi	skreet	and yes it containds glibc but glibc isnt what i need
2008-06-22T01:18:00.000Z	skreet	yowshi	 If I could fix my apt, I'd try to set up xmms on my system for comparison, but I'm not getting very far.
