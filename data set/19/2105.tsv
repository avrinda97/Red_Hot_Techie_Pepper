2010-06-30T14:06:00.000Z	syeki		Hi there. Can anyone tell me why the chat page appeared momentarily and the disappeared during my fist connect to this channel (i'm completely new to ubuntu and irc)
2010-06-30T14:08:00.000Z	Vroomfondle	syeki	sounds like a bug in your IRC client, perhaps
2010-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	syeki	Vroomfondle	i'm using ubuntu 10.04 empathy. Is it known to be buggy?
2010-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	Vroomfondle		Empathy? Yeah. Not good for IRC in the past, though I haven't tried the version that comes with 10.04.
2010-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	Vroomfondle		try installing xchat instead. A lot of beginners use xchat.
2010-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	syeki		Can you recommend a better prog?
2010-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	Vroomfondle		and it's been around for ages so is very stable
2010-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	syeki		thanks Vroomfondle will try
2010-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	Vroomfondle	syeki	personally I use irssi, but that isn't as beginner-friendly.
2010-06-30T14:13:00.000Z	syeki		hi tripelb, my needs are quite modest. I'm trying to use this channel to solve bigger problems.
2010-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	syeki		yes that would be great. Where do i start?
2010-06-30T14:15:00.000Z	syeki		umm repository?
2010-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	syeki		Can we start again? I will try to explain better>
2010-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	Vroomfondle	syeki	okay, first thing to learn about is repositories and synaptic/apt-get. These are what you use to install software on Ubuntu, usually.
2010-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	Vroomfondle		!apt
2010-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	Vroomfondle		!synaptic
2010-06-30T14:17:00.000Z	Vroomfondle	syeki	see what ubottu just said about Synaptic? Follow the link
2010-06-30T14:17:00.000Z	syeki		ok now text is flashing by so fast i can't read anything.
2010-06-30T14:18:00.000Z	Vroomfondle	syeki	go to  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
