2006-09-22T06:03:00.000Z	otaku515		I downloaded the source files for the Bitchx IRC client for linux but I dont understand how to use them and how to compile them so I can use the client
2006-09-22T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	bitchx is available in the universe repository.  Just enable universe and then use system > administration > synaptic to install it
2006-09-22T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	that's ok, ubotu should have sent you the information about enabling universe.  Did you get it?
2006-09-22T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	did you receive a private message from ubotu?
2006-09-22T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	great, those links explain all about universe and how to enable it.  Just come back and ask any more questions you have in case something isn't clear in those documents
2006-09-22T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	ok, did you manage to enable universe?
2006-09-22T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	hmm ok, they way to install bitchx is to go to system > administration > synaptic and install it there.  Or, you can just run the command 'sudo apt-get install bitchx'.  But you need to have enabled universe first
2006-09-22T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	ok, then you should have it.  Just try to install it with apt-get.  If it doesn't work, then we know you don't have it :)
2006-09-22T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	yes, were you talking to him? :P
2006-09-22T06:37:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	no, synaptic is a gui way to install packages.  apt-get is a command line program to install packages.  Let's try to use apt-get since it's easier to explain over irc.  Go to applications > accessories > terminal.  Then type 'sudo apt-get install bitchx' without quotes and press enter
2006-09-22T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	yikes, can you copy the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list and post them on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org ?  Give us a link afterwards please
2006-09-22T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	type 'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' without quotes to open the file
2006-09-22T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	nope
2006-09-22T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	do you have synaptic open maybe? or some other apt-get running somewhere?
2006-09-22T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	extracted?
2006-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	just to explain, apt-get fetches the program from online repositories.  So you don't ever need to grab the source code manually for a program.  it didn't use the tar.gz that you have on your computer of bitchx's source
2006-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	type 'bitchx'
2006-09-22T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	yes, it's a terminal irc client
2006-09-22T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	otaku515	df -h
