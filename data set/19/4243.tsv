2009-02-23T06:45:00.000Z	Montag1		whoever sent me a link to how to install tghem I guess didn't know that
2009-02-23T06:45:00.000Z	Montag1		pr was intentionally wasting my time.  :)
2009-02-23T06:45:00.000Z	Montag1		but I still can't detect my displays
2009-02-23T06:46:00.000Z	Montag1		So any thoughts on getting this thing to use both monitors in a useful fashion?
2009-02-23T06:46:00.000Z	Montag1		I hate the thought of reinstalling the OS That Shall NOt Be Named
2009-02-23T06:48:00.000Z	Montag1		and can't get both monitors to do anything other than mirror each other through my ATI card
2009-02-23T06:48:00.000Z	Montag1		want both as part of one desktop
2009-02-23T06:49:00.000Z	Montag1		Not gonna run a beta, sorry.
2009-02-23T06:49:00.000Z	Montag1		And am hoping to leave MS forever.
2009-02-23T06:49:00.000Z	Montag1		So I really just want to get this working under intrepid.  I didn't come to an ubuntu channel to have someone try to talk me into Windows
2009-02-23T06:50:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	there are supposedly settings in your screen resolution gui
2009-02-23T06:51:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	is there not an advance tab there
2009-02-23T06:52:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	I am ignorant of your answer but have you tried to google dual monitors in ubuntu ?
2009-02-23T06:52:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	sorry I use single monitors
2009-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	let me see what I can find
2009-02-23T06:55:00.000Z	Montag1	f_newton	that yields a bunch of stuff
2009-02-23T07:14:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	the only other distro I know of that is a plug n play as ubuntu is mandriva .... possibly suse.... fedora is more bleeding edge but less stable
2009-02-23T07:15:00.000Z	f_newton	Montag1	you will have to get used to the nvidia bias that permeates all linux
2009-02-23T07:16:00.000Z	Montag1	f_newton	or just not use it.  :)
