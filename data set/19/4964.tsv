2008-12-27T11:50:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Also, is there any way I could change the alt sysrq combo to a different key combo, because having to press alt fn del then REISUB/O is a bit of a pain
2008-12-27T11:50:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	no
2008-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	thats a hardware evil
2008-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	I figured, but not even at the kernel level?
2008-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	dont believe so. you CAN send the commands using the terminal though
2008-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	would that help?
2008-12-27T11:52:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	not really, cause if I cant access the terminal, then trying to send commands from it would be a problem
2008-12-27T11:52:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	if its panicked, sysrq doesnt work either though
2008-12-27T11:53:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	if you can get to alt+sysrq+t, thatll give you a terminal to let you do the rest using "edho"
2008-12-27T11:53:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	well, not panicked per se, just unresponsive, like when X crashes and I cant even see the terminal even if it was open
2008-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	ah well if it's just X that's crashed, alt+sysrq+t if you can reach that combo will take you to a terminal and you can restart X
2008-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	cause I've tried that before, and then REISUB worked fine, just the ATi Drivers on here just shut down and the screen was completely unresponsive
2008-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	it was like I disconnected the screen, but I didnt actually disconnect anything (which would be difficult regardless seeing as how I'm on a laptop.
2008-12-27T11:56:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	are you serious?
2008-12-27T11:56:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	(bout the kid and the IBM exec)
2009-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maco	well, even then, the xorg still gets a little screwy with the accel
2009-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	even with their closed drivers, getting dual-head working was cake under hardy...
2009-11-29T13:15:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	its configurable. upstream turned it off by default
2009-11-29T13:15:00.000Z	maco	GodfatherofEire	lstarnes is right on the reasoning
