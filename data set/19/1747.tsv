2010-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	deadroot		okay
2010-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	deadroot		okay
2010-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	deadroot		that is strange...
2010-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	deadroot		brb
2010-10-14T11:22:00.000Z	deadroot		okay, my script is indeed using 'source ./setenvironment.sh'
2010-10-14T11:23:00.000Z	deadroot		it shold have worked fine, but later on, the build script ran erroneously. the symptom is the same as the environment var not being set. i'll try again and see what happens this time. thanks Jordan_U
2010-10-14T11:23:00.000Z	deadroot		my current change will be to 'sudo screen'
2010-10-14T11:25:00.000Z	deadroot		okay, i've started yet another build run
2010-10-14T11:26:00.000Z	deadroot		as mentioned before i'm using putty to do the runs. and as it may take more than twenty four hours, i'm using screen to do it.
2010-10-14T11:26:00.000Z	deadroot		my concern now is that whenever i use screen, then exit putty, then try to reattach via another putty window, it says that 'There is no screen to be resumed.''
2010-10-14T11:27:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	oh did you detach or hit [X] on the win32 window ?
2010-10-14T11:32:00.000Z	deadroot	lucent	thanks. works like a charm. :)
2010-10-14T11:32:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	some programs (like irssi) are smart enough to dettach themselves when asked to
2010-10-14T11:32:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	that's called "screen-awareness" but you know, the other ten million programs out there have no clue and you must get into a ctrl-a-d habit
2010-10-14T11:34:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	another pro tip for you, typing ~. in an ssh session will kill that ssh session
2010-10-14T11:34:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	useful if the program you're running remotely barfs, or the connection is disrupted
2010-10-14T11:36:00.000Z	deadroot	lucent	thanks again. ^_^;;
2010-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	you can install older versions, I think
2010-10-14T11:55:00.000Z	lucent	deadroot	use the software sources manager, if you can
