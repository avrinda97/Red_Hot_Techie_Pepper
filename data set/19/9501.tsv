2006-12-10T15:25:00.000Z	webmaren		does anybody know how to get mplayer to play through usb headset
2006-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	usb headsets are evil. they are little soundcards of their own, and never work
2006-12-10T15:28:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	but it works for all my other sound
2006-12-24T14:16:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	I wouldn't do that, rick_ you should burn edgy CDs
2006-12-24T14:16:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	there is no diffrence, unless you suggest making a clean install
2006-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	If he's going CD, then he's doing that anyways
2006-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	not by necesity...
2006-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	but most likely
2006-12-25T13:03:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	so true
2006-12-25T13:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	photoshop is kind of nice, excluding their png support...
2006-12-25T13:18:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	juano: *correction* all paid software that isn't a bajillion bucks is crap
2006-12-25T13:25:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	I feel for ya
2006-12-25T13:26:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	but there are more stupid people then smart ones
2006-12-25T13:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	what does he need tha for?
2006-12-25T13:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	wouldnt the ubuntu guide be enough?
2006-12-25T13:36:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	to make his iPod worth it
2006-12-25T13:36:00.000Z	webmaren	nolimitsoya	joke, nvm
2006-12-25T13:36:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	webmaren	ah, nice project :P
