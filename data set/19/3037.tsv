2009-11-06T05:02:00.000Z	xfire8		hey help me please , http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/page-250411_12_0.html  thanks . ( i have the same problem)
2009-11-06T05:03:00.000Z	xfire8		i tired memtest but no problems
2009-11-06T05:04:00.000Z	xfire8		yes
2009-11-06T05:04:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	so -- again: why would this be a Linux/Ubuntu issue?
2009-11-06T05:05:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	which, BTW, you were told more than 3 times so far
2009-11-06T05:06:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	OK. Why is it a problem only on Linux?
2009-11-06T05:07:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	so (1) you start Windows, shutdown, restart, no problems; (2) you start Linux, shutdown, restart, you see the problem?
2009-11-06T05:08:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	and shutdown on Windows -- is there a problem on reboot?
2009-11-06T05:09:00.000Z	xfire8	hggdh	: no
2009-11-06T05:09:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	it does not sound like power, or memory issue
2009-11-06T05:10:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	it sounds more like your BIOS is slightly hosed/bad. Did you upgrade the BIOS recently?
2009-11-06T05:10:00.000Z	xfire8	hggdh	: and more something . IF I DISABLE " SAFEWATCHDOG " FROM THE BIOS, obviously the error message is not displayed BUT the OS doesn't boot at all and the monitor doesn't recive more signal and go to stand-by...
2009-11-06T05:10:00.000Z	xfire8	hggdh	: my bios is up to date .
2009-11-06T05:10:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	did you update the BIOS recently?
2009-11-06T05:11:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	did you have the same problem with the previous BIOS version?
2009-11-06T05:11:00.000Z	xfire8	hggdh	: and more something . IF I DISABLE " SAFEWATCHDOG " FROM THE BIOS, obviously the error message is not displayed BUT the OS doesn't boot at all and the monitor doesn't recive more signal and go to stand-by...
2009-11-06T05:11:00.000Z	xfire8	hggdh	: i dont remember i tired to install the old bios and still problem
2009-11-06T05:15:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	did you try the BIOS recovery process in here: http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-028780.htm
2009-11-06T05:16:00.000Z	hggdh	xfire8	I doubt
