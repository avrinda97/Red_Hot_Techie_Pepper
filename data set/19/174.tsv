2012-07-19T05:34:00.000Z	AverageJB		hi
2012-07-19T05:34:00.000Z	AverageJB		I just installed a brand new copy of ubuntu server to my virtual PC and I can't access it through SSH?
2012-07-19T05:35:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	Can you ping the IP?
2012-07-19T05:35:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	ssh from ___________?
2012-07-19T05:35:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	And are you srue that the guest actually has connection to the LAN?
2012-07-19T05:36:00.000Z	AverageJB	usr13	yeah it's connected
2012-07-19T05:37:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	And from where are you trying to ssh?  From the host?  From another PC on the network?
2012-07-19T05:38:00.000Z	AverageJB	usr13	host
2012-07-19T05:38:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	Can you ping the IP you are trying to ssh to? Are you sure you are .... Oh from the host?  Why?
2012-07-19T05:38:00.000Z	AverageJB	usr13	I want to send files to my virtual pc via SFTP
2012-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	sftp is not ssh so.....
2012-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	AverageJB	usr13	the virtual machine responds to a ping
2012-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	And do you know that sshd is installed?
2012-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	sudo apt-get install openssh-server  #On the host OS.
2012-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	.... if it is Ubuntu
2012-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	For future reference, you can see if a PC is listen for ssh via nmap scan on port 22.  nmap -p22 192.168.x.x
2012-07-19T05:44:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	sudo apt-get install openssh-server  #On the guest OS.  (Sorry, previous one was typo)
2012-07-19T05:44:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	and all others:  openssh-server is not installed by default.
2012-07-19T05:46:00.000Z	usr13	AverageJB	openssh-client & openssh-server are two separate packages in Ubuntu.  For security reasons, openssh-server is not installed by default.
