2011-08-11T20:52:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		trying to figure out why my system won't boot in normal mode but works fine in recovery mode
2011-08-11T20:53:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		no, I tried to add a swap partition yesterday and since then it won't boot
2011-08-11T20:55:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		it actually didn't add anything to fstab
2011-08-11T20:56:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		I tried adding the line myself but it didn't help
2011-08-11T20:57:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		well at this point I've already broken the system
2011-08-11T20:57:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		not sure if deleting the swap part and resizing the main back to its original size would fix anything
2011-08-11T20:57:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		but maybe worth a try
2011-08-11T20:58:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		I used parted magic to resize and create a new partition
2011-08-11T20:58:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		my original was a single ext4 logical partition
2011-08-11T20:58:00.000Z	Dulak	DeltaWhy	what kind of errors do you get when you boot the kernel with no options?  'e' at the grub menu and remove quiet/splash from the boot line?
2011-08-11T21:00:00.000Z	Dulak	DeltaWhy	/var/log/system and /var/log/messages prolly
2011-08-11T21:00:00.000Z	Dulak	DeltaWhy	/var/log/syslog even
2011-08-11T21:01:00.000Z	Dulak	DeltaWhy	you are on ubuntu?
2011-08-11T21:02:00.000Z	Dulak	DeltaWhy	you should have /var/log/messages on a ubuntu box afaik, it's where most of the logs go
2011-08-11T21:18:00.000Z	DeltaWhy	Dulak	found something that looks promising in syslog: http://pastebin.com/0s9iy3YR
2011-08-11T21:20:00.000Z	Dulak	DeltaWhy	this was working?  Have you tried an older kernel in your list?
2011-08-11T21:33:00.000Z	DeltaWhy	Dulak	hmm, I just changed the partitions back to the original state, and it's still doing the same thing.
