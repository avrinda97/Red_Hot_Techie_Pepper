2005-03-03T15:38:00.000Z	anthonws		anyone with 2.6.11-686 image?
2005-03-03T15:39:00.000Z	jnk	anthonws	I tried it but it had a broken patch applied that made it unusable at the time, I don't know if it'sfixed  (the same patch was applied to 2.8.10, but reverted)
2005-03-03T15:42:00.000Z	anthonws	jnk	after i login in gdm it frezzes.... completly....
2005-03-03T15:42:00.000Z	jnk	anthonws	it was the same for me
2005-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	jnk	anthonws	you can't use this package, it's broken. Compile the kernel yourself without the broken patch,, or use 2.6.10
2005-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	anthonws	jnk	it's what i'm using but....
2005-03-03T15:44:00.000Z	anthonws	jnk	i was trying to use it to see if it would solve some of my problems
2005-03-03T15:44:00.000Z	jnk	anthonws	well no luck for now :) what are your problems ?

2005-03-03T15:45:00.000Z	anthonws	jnk	some times works... others not... a toshiba a60 (atiixp sound or AC 97)
2005-03-03T15:46:00.000Z	anthonws	jnk	what i cant understand is why it seems the system has "feelings".... really! at one boot the sound card is working... the other not
2005-03-03T15:47:00.000Z	jnk	anthonws	when it doesn't work, do you get any error, or just no sound ?
2005-03-03T15:48:00.000Z	anthonws	jnk	the error message is that no dsp (device) in available, but in device manager the hardware is there
