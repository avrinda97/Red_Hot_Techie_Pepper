2007-09-01T07:34:00.000Z	ironmatar		ok i seem to be haveing a real issue    i install ubuntu and update and install my vid driver and evernthing goes haywire
2007-09-01T07:35:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	do you have an 8800?
2007-09-01T07:37:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	do you get an error from x11 when you try to start up ubuntu after installing your nvidia drivers?
2007-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	 yes sorry not use to nick first
2007-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	i don't know why, but all of the dx10 nvidia cards seem to do that. i don't know if yours is a dx10 card, but your error sounds like mine when i tried installing ubuntu with an 8800 gts. i used https://launchpad.net/envy/ to automate the installation and then it worked fine
2007-09-01T07:39:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	although by the time i got around to using that autoinstalling script, i had already dicked around with my xorg.conf settings, so i don't know if it'll work right out of the box for you
2007-09-01T07:43:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	 im ready to try anything at this point i figure i should ahve had a working system eve for noob like me a week ago
2007-09-01T07:44:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	yeah, i understand the feeling. btw, here's the link to the author's download page for envy http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
2007-09-01T07:45:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	 canu span the apt get build essiental command in sytax i thought i had it wrote done but aparently not
2007-09-01T07:46:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	sorry, i'm a bit confused. what exactly are you asking?
2007-09-01T07:48:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	  i think its supposed to be apt-get install build essiental  but thats wrong somehow to
2007-09-01T07:49:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	did you run "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade" first?
2007-09-01T07:50:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	oh yeah, what Flannel said; build-essential not build essential
2007-09-01T07:52:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	 what order would you run those in
2007-09-01T07:53:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	 or just the essential
2007-09-01T07:54:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	update first, then upgrade then build-essential
2007-09-01T07:54:00.000Z	ironmatar	Jobias	 thanks
2007-09-01T07:54:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	although it sounds like your problem may just be in forgetting to use build-essential instead of build essential. but doing update/upgrade doesn't hurt anyways, so you might as well do them
2007-09-01T07:56:00.000Z	Jobias	ironmatar	i agree. but it's worth doing in the end. you learn so much, and you feel much better after having understood how things work
