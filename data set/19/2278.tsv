2010-05-11T04:41:00.000Z	b12core		Hello, what is the parameter for gnome-terminal for auto-executing commands: i.e. gnome-terminal -X "cd foo/bar; make", thanks in advance
2010-05-11T04:41:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	try looking up .bashrc
2010-05-11T04:42:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	it's for a keybinding_command shortcut, I want to connect <Control>F9 with a make command
2010-05-11T04:43:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	Oh that? You can set that up in your System => Preferences => Keyboard Shortcuts
2010-05-11T04:44:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	thanks, I know how to set one up. The issue is that make -I ~/directory doesn't seem to want to work.
2010-05-11T04:44:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	why don't you write a little bash script for that? You could call it as an alias from bash.
2010-05-11T04:45:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	make's being an asshole in bash scripts. I can, however, get it working in terminals.
2010-05-11T04:46:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	sometimes the ~ does not work, wher $HOME does
2010-05-11T04:48:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	Just to confirm, I place the bash script in the same directory as my Makefile, with 'make' inside of it. Then I execute it?
2010-05-11T04:49:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	No, that's not what I meant, you can use .bashrc to include this script in your path so you can call it from any directory.
2010-05-11T04:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	You could also define an alias instead after you have made your target script executable with chmod
2010-05-11T04:52:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	here's how within .bashrc: alias=/[PathToYourScript]/[scriptname]
2010-05-11T04:53:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	Sounds good, I'll give it a try
2010-05-11T04:53:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	that would be gksudo instead
2010-05-11T04:54:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	gksudo, whats the difference? Sorry, new to ubuntu.
2010-05-11T04:55:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	Ah ok, thanks
2010-05-11T04:55:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	ubottu is the greatest IRC bot I've ever seen on any channel (and I visted a few)
2010-05-11T04:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	b12core	I could almost see ubottu blush there ;-)
2010-05-11T04:57:00.000Z	b12core	Stereocaulon	haha, so here's what I got so far, buildscript=~/_CORE/Melancholika/build.sh
