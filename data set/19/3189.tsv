2009-10-05T18:56:00.000Z	Andrew-		Hi all!
2009-10-05T18:58:00.000Z	Andrew-		I installed ubuntu on my hdd usb. I installed also grub on the same hdd. The result is that now I can't load ubuntu and can't load even XP if the hdd is connected...
2009-10-05T18:58:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	did selected "boot from usb" ?
2009-10-05T18:58:00.000Z	Andrew-		I just can load XP when the hdd is disconnected and only ubuntu live
2009-10-05T18:58:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	do you mean on bios?
2009-10-05T18:59:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	yes
2009-10-05T18:59:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	 yes, I did. But now I can't verify that cause the bios doesn't start if the hdd is connected
2009-10-05T19:00:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	is a laptop?
2009-10-05T19:00:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	yep
2009-10-05T19:01:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	try with usb pendrive
2009-10-05T19:02:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	actually I have another usb hdd and the bios does recognize that, so that shouldn't be the problem
2009-10-05T19:02:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	it append the same to me i resolve with usb pendrive
2009-10-05T19:03:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	ok, what should I do precisely?
2009-10-05T19:04:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	i create an usb bootable "disc"
2009-10-05T19:04:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	I see. Does it mean that I should use it everytime I wanna boot?
2009-10-05T19:05:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	no only if u wanna use ubuntu from u'r usb
2009-10-05T19:06:00.000Z	Andrew-	biczd	I see, thanks. Just one more question: Is it possible to change again the mbr of the usb hdd as to boot XP without disconnecting everytime the hdd?
2009-10-05T19:06:00.000Z	biczd	Andrew-	don't know sorry :|
