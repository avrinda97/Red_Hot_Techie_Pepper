2007-12-22T23:24:00.000Z	Phopsy		Hey, I'm running Feisty and getting lock-ups every single time I boot up on the login screen - this may be connected to the latest kernel updates. There's no issue with my hardware as I'm now running a Live CD and I have scanned the HDDs with fsck and badblocks. Is there anything else I can try to diagnose it with?
2007-12-22T23:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	latest feisty updates worked here.  I gotta ask if you EVER used automatix or envy scripts... (Both bad ideas by the way)
2007-12-22T23:26:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Hmm. I MAY have used Automatix at some point to get some codecs. I actually can't remember, but probably.
2007-12-22T23:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	And there falls another victim of automatix
2007-12-22T23:27:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Never needed Envy on Feisty, the Restricted Drivers seemed to work perfectly.
2007-12-22T23:27:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, I know, but ... well, mixed reviews, let's say. So, is there anything I can do about it?
2007-12-22T23:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	Sorry, not much.  As the link says, best to reinstall..
2007-12-22T23:29:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Reinstall? Over my dead body, it took me so long to sort this lot out ...
2007-12-22T23:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	Automatix seems to break many systems when they dont integrate with the updates
2007-12-22T23:32:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Is there anything else you think might be the problem? One thing I thought of is that I moved house yesterday, but I'm sure that can't be the problem!
2007-12-22T23:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	Post your sources.list to the pastebin...
2007-12-22T23:33:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	I'll get to it
2007-12-22T23:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	/etc/apt/sources.list
2007-12-22T23:35:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49332/
2007-12-22T23:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	Yep.. you used automatix and that is the root of your problem and no we cant help you fix it.
2007-12-22T23:38:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, many thanks. But you could help me: Other than my /home folder, what should I back-up to make transition as seamless as possible?
2007-12-22T23:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	NOrmally I would say to burn /var/cache/apt/archives to a cd or use apt on cd, but there are going to be some files in there you do NOT want to use that were picked up by automatix
2007-12-22T23:46:00.000Z	Phopsy	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks very much, Cap'n. Looks like I'll be back to Square One! No more Automatix for me.
2007-12-22T23:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Phopsy	I wish I had a better soultion, but at least we found the problem fast
