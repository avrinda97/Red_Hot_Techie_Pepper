2007-05-26T10:27:00.000Z	gravemind		hey does anybody know how to connect to websites with ftp?
2007-05-26T10:27:00.000Z	gravemind		I'm supposed to be adding pages to a website that way
2007-05-26T10:27:00.000Z	wastedfluid	gravemind	 try gftp
2007-05-26T10:28:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	thanks
2007-05-26T10:28:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	i'm still not sure how this is supposed to work - do I put the name of the website in, and it connects, or what
2007-05-26T10:29:00.000Z	wastedfluid	gravemind	Well.  You need to nkow your username+password of your website.  The port is typically port 21.  Just put the name of your website in(if the FTP server is running off your website name, which is most cases..), so, I use jbodystreet.com port 21 and my user/pass
2007-05-26T10:29:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	thanks, I'll give it a try
2007-05-26T10:30:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	awesome, it worked
2007-05-26T10:31:00.000Z	wastedfluid	gravemind	kudos to you.  g'job.
2007-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	awesome, I can edit files on site with gedit
2007-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	wastedfluid	gravemind	 Yes, you can.
2007-05-26T10:39:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	I finished editing and clicked save, but the page on the internet didn't change. What am I doing wrong?
2007-05-26T10:39:00.000Z	wastedfluid	gravemind	it depends.  where did you put your files?
2007-05-26T10:41:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	I right clicked > edited the file on the server
2007-05-26T10:41:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	no go
2007-05-26T10:44:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	the file I wanted to edit is called home.html, but the file in gedit is called gftp-view.1mQIBL.html (/tmp)
2007-05-26T10:45:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	ok. So I can't actually edit files from the site, I download them, change them, and upload them back?
2007-05-26T10:46:00.000Z	wastedfluid	gravemind	 I don't usually do it like that.  I usually copy my entire web server folder.. and edit them on my HD.  I then upload the actual file, and overwrite thme.  Copy your webserver to your /home/ directory, edit the files as you see - and just overwrite them on your webserver.. that's how I do it
2007-05-26T10:47:00.000Z	gravemind	wastedfluid	alright
