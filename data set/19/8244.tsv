2011-02-08T00:49:00.000Z	genjix		oops
2011-02-08T00:49:00.000Z	genjix		this channel is a warzone :D
2011-02-08T00:50:00.000Z	genjix		the virtualbox from their site runs faster than the ubuntu version
2011-02-08T00:51:00.000Z	genjix		no need to have a separate home partition really
2011-02-08T00:51:00.000Z	genjix		if your install goes wrong then you can boot a livecd, backup and reinstall
2011-02-08T00:52:00.000Z	genjix		what're you trying to do? I missed it?

2011-02-08T00:53:00.000Z	llutz	genjix	use sysv-rc-conf
2011-02-08T01:02:00.000Z	llutz	genjix	the bootloader (grub) is to be installed into the MBR, so /dev/sda in Kingsys case. wth should it be written to sdb?
2011-02-08T01:05:00.000Z	llutz	genjix	thats stupid
2011-02-08T01:05:00.000Z	genjix	llutz	why is it bad?
2011-02-08T01:06:00.000Z	llutz	genjix	it makes no sense at all. why should one change the BIOS just for booting, when writing grub into sda works fine?
2011-02-08T01:06:00.000Z	genjix	llutz	he's already installed
2011-02-08T01:07:00.000Z	llutz	genjix	we're talking about Kingsy  who wants to install? so what is "already installed"?
2011-02-08T01:07:00.000Z	genjix	llutz	he said he's already installed 5 times
2011-02-08T01:08:00.000Z	llutz	genjix	so nothing is installed right now. stop talking nonsense please
2011-02-08T01:08:00.000Z	genjix	llutz	he hasn't wiped his hard drive
