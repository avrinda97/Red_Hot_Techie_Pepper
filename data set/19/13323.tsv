2005-04-18T14:32:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	gaim doesn't suit you?
2005-04-18T14:33:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	gaim drives me crazy.
2005-04-25T14:26:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	so does a '/etc/init.d/networking restart' also take a long time on 'lo'?
2005-04-25T14:27:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	I dunno. I've never done that.
2005-04-25T14:29:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	I just did /etc/init.d/networking restart now and it only took ~5 seconds.
2005-04-25T14:29:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	well that makes little sense!
2005-04-25T14:31:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	actually it might... I haven't rebooted since I commented out "auto eth0" in /etc/networking/interfaces... haha. I just took a quick stab at a solution this morning but never tested it.
2005-04-26T13:13:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	hehe, but did it help poor Fazer..
2005-04-26T13:13:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	I dunno. I think it would though. I don't think he's gonna get the stock module to work with his chipset, so he's gonna have to compile his own I'll bet.
2005-04-26T13:14:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	hmm.. i thought so too
2005-04-26T13:15:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	i like 'plow' it's easy to remember
2005-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	I'm the same way. I think, however, that we are few.
2005-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	the finder assumes software is lost already. odd concept
2005-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	"like wolves amongst sheep, we walk among them"
2005-09-27T05:42:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	hehe strange redirection of the question there.
2005-09-27T05:44:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	yes, he's close to breaking his system.
2005-09-27T05:44:00.000Z	dcraven	delire	What mount is that drive that he's gonna 777?
2005-09-27T05:45:00.000Z	delire	dcraven	he wants all users to be able to mount, read write execute on the partition.
