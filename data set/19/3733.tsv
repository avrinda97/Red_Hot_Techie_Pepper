2010-09-27T20:02:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	Is that last partition ext4 or 3?
2010-09-27T20:02:00.000Z	friendishan	edbian	not sure but i guess ext4
2010-09-27T20:03:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	You're gonna need a swap partition as well.  so add that and when you're installing tell choose manual and tell Ubuntu to use that last partition as /
2010-09-27T20:03:00.000Z	friendishan	edbian	the partition i want to use is sda4
2010-09-27T20:04:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	Great.  Then you have 4 primary partitions?
2010-09-27T20:04:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	?
2010-09-27T20:04:00.000Z	friendishan	edbian	yep it shows sda1,2,3,4 sda2 has windows 7
2010-09-27T20:05:00.000Z	friendishan	edbian	maybe i can resize the last partition and take out 3-4 GB Space for my swap space?
2010-09-27T20:06:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	sounds good.
2010-09-27T20:06:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	You could also create a big chunk of empty space on the drive (in the place where you would want a partition) and tell Ubuntu "use the largest continuous free space" and it'll do all the partitioning for you.
2010-09-27T20:06:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	Possibly that's the easiest option
2010-09-27T20:07:00.000Z	friendishan	edbian	how to create that big chunk of empty space? :P
2010-09-27T20:08:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	by deleting partitions.  it looks grey and is called "unallocated" in gparted
2010-09-27T20:13:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	Really it's you who is trusting me :)
2010-09-27T20:13:00.000Z	friendishan	edbian	thanks for that idea ;)
2010-09-27T20:14:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	Technically this is Ubuntu support not windows support.  Don't expect us to know the windows partitioner.
2010-09-27T20:16:00.000Z	edbian	friendishan	yep
