2008-12-31T12:41:00.000Z	forensicwannabe		I wonder if this chat room is strictly ubuntu. Is there a different chat room for kubuntu?
2008-12-31T12:42:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	#kubuntu of course
2008-12-31T12:44:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	no, just reinstalling using a livecd is all
2008-12-31T12:48:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	I always dban before I reinstall. Are you familiar with Dban? Also, If I was you, I would use fluxubuntu, or install minimal ubuntu with the ubuntu light script, or even consider debian lenny. look at this website all to super secure your debian based distro, if you are into that:
2008-12-31T12:49:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	I just get bored and format and reinstall every so often actually.
2008-12-31T12:51:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	are you into performance? it seems you might be judging by some of your responses. fluxubunt, or ubuntu light are just ubuntu based distros. you might like them. they use ubuntu repositories, you just get the basics and add what you want to it.
2008-12-31T12:52:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	I've tried grabbing the alternate and building up from there, it's a pain with upgrades though
2008-12-31T12:53:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	have you ever tried fluxubuntu
2008-12-31T12:54:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	no I haven't, I've tried KDE and didn't really like it, I think I like GNOME myself
2008-12-31T12:55:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	KDE just felt too stiff for me
2008-12-31T12:55:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	isn't KDE just kubuntu
2008-12-31T12:55:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	KDE = K Desktop Environment, kubuntu does use it though
2008-12-31T12:57:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	Oh right, I musunderstood.... anyways, if I'm not mistaken, KDE has a big footprint just like ubuntu and kubuntu
2008-12-31T12:57:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	footprint?
2008-12-31T12:58:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	you know: gnome desktop manager eats up all kinds of resources
2008-12-31T12:59:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	yeah I know, but I want something which is stable since I play around, a lot, I'm on Jaunty right now actually, and I need to have something stable to fall back on if I break things
2008-12-31T13:02:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	you must have it on a dual boot. that's what I want to do, have ubuntu stable, and I think I'll install fluxubuntu on another partition to play with
2008-12-31T13:03:00.000Z	Arenlor	forensicwannabe	I dual boot Vista/Jaunty right now, but in the reinstall I'm getting rid of Vista, no longer need it.
2008-12-31T13:06:00.000Z	forensicwannabe	Arenlor	I have xp on a seperate partition, and I think I will replace it with one of the lighter distros
