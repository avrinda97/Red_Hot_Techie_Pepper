2008-02-21T06:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fredsua	do you have libdvdcss2?
2008-02-21T06:54:00.000Z	fredsua	prince_jammys	I do and it still does not work
2008-02-21T06:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fredsua	frustrating.  what player do you use? and have you tried different DVDs?
2008-02-21T06:56:00.000Z	fredsua	prince_jammys	I have a Plextor PX-712A DVD-RW.  I've tried playing backup movies and they play fine but when I try playing a movie from blockbuster or others that I have it can't read it.
2008-02-21T06:57:00.000Z	fredsua	prince_jammys	I'm speculating reinstalling Ubuntu
2008-02-21T06:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fredsua	i don't know the solution, sorry.  i actually just got a dvd drive on this computer and havent gotten around to dealing with that
2008-02-21T06:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fredsua	i really doubt you need to reinstall
2008-02-21T06:59:00.000Z	fredsua	prince_jammys	Thanks for trying.
