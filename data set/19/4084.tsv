2009-03-27T08:23:00.000Z	FSWolf		any ideas would be apreshated
2009-03-27T08:24:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	yeah, Ubuntu can do that on its own, it just needs to 'see' the partitions, which it usually can by default
2009-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	FSWolf	Gnea	was that directed tword me ?
2009-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	FSWolf	Gnea	in places
2009-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	yes.
2009-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	FSWolf	Gnea	FileSystem>PlaceS?
2009-03-27T08:27:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	have you not used ubuntu before?
2009-03-27T08:28:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	heh, I used to use Debian for years.  Still use it on a few systems. :)
2009-03-27T08:29:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	I happen to think that Ubuntu has made strides where Debian can/will not make them. But, that is beside the point, and off-topic.
2009-03-27T08:29:00.000Z	FSWolf	Gnea	that it eh i dont use it graphicly either so im not sure how to guide her unless i just go to my sisters computer and work there :? or shh into her system and try to find it my self
2009-03-27T08:29:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	well, if you want to help support her on it, perhaps install it in vmware or virtualbox
2009-03-27T08:30:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	don't even go there ;)
2009-03-27T08:30:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	did she actually install windows yet?
2009-03-27T08:33:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	I'm really not sure at this point. she might be able to get at it through Places->Computer... but if she has internet access, she might as well open xchat and get on here and ask herself
2009-03-27T08:33:00.000Z	FSWolf	Gnea	kim4249 is the one who having this issue
2009-03-27T08:34:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	nothing doing.
2009-03-27T08:35:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	it's better to do it here, in case it helps someone else
2009-03-27T08:35:00.000Z	Gnea	FSWolf	or in case someone else has another option to help
