2006-12-05T07:26:00.000Z	IdleOne		did you read what it is called?
2006-12-05T07:28:00.000Z	IdleOne		you dont have that repo
2006-12-05T07:28:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	I followed those instructions to the letter though, it involves making that repo, which I now have on my computer.
2006-12-05T07:30:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	Any idea?
2006-12-05T07:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	 no I dont instructions seem pretty straight forward
2006-12-05T07:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	 those instructions are for 6.06 might not work on 6.10
2006-12-05T07:43:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	Well if I can't get CVSD working Ubuntu is kind of worthless to me ... they updated to 6.10 but they didn't change the docs?
2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	` that "doc" is a blog that a user posted try asking in #ubuntu=1 they might be able to help you there
2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	What's #ubuntu=1 ?
2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	` that "doc" is a blog that a user posted try asking in #ubuntu+1 they might be able to help you there  sorry +1 not =1
2006-12-05T07:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	it's the dev help channel I beleive
2006-12-05T07:45:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	This'll be fun :-D
2006-12-05T07:45:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	I suspect I don't have a dev-worthy question though ..
2006-12-05T07:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	 some advice be patient and check the tude :)
2006-12-05T07:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	Cyde	 or keep hanging out here and ask ever so often and maybe someone will be able to help you
2006-12-05T07:47:00.000Z	Cyde	IdleOne	I just found a much better doc from Gentoo, it seems like it should work here, I'll try it out.   http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_CVS_Server
