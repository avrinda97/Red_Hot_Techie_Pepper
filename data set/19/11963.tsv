2006-02-24T13:21:00.000Z	jenda		How do I know if a dataprojector will work on my Ubuntu box? It's a Hitachi CP-RS55 - Google won't say.
2006-02-24T13:23:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 try looking for your projector and linux
2006-02-24T13:23:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	As I said, won't say.
2006-02-24T13:24:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 it would be in hardware support usb or the like

2006-02-24T13:32:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 found this page for projectors http://www.spinics.net/linux/vidproj.php
2006-02-24T13:33:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	hey thanks :)
2006-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 what interface does it use
2006-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	hey... it's listed in there, but clicking the link just kicks me to Amazon.com. Interface? Dunno... how would I find out... lemme look around.
2006-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	geneo93		does it attach to video card jenda
2006-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	I don't know, I've never had it in my hands. It says "Inputs: 1 composite, 1 S-Video, 1 VGA" on Amazon
2006-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 well its does connect to video card or capture card either one
2006-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	the vga input would kinda suggest it will just take a connection from the PC's monitor port, no?
2006-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 it will hook right in place of monitor or if you have tv out you can use that
2006-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	Yes, I sort of thought so, but wanted to make sure. Will it just appear as a monitor to my Ubuntu PC?
2006-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	geneo93	jenda	 it might take some tweaking but should work fine
2006-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	OK, thanks... the 'some tweaking' sounds a little scary... how deep would that go?
2006-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	geneo93		just a resalution change maybe jenda
2006-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	jenda	geneo93	Oh OK, that sounds good. Thanks for your help :)
