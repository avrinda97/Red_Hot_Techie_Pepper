2007-03-21T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	are you looking for themes?
2007-04-05T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	yes, read what the bot sent you
2007-04-05T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	yes for version 5
2007-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	you just said it
2007-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	n-iCe	jrib	 which one is the lastest version ?
2007-04-05T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	6 is the latest version
2008-06-24T19:56:00.000Z	n-iCe	jrib	Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor , what's that?
2008-06-24T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	run 'gconf-editor' in a shell
2010-03-18T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	because the redirection is being done by your shell which is run by your user.  Use something like: zcat file | sudo tee other-file
2010-03-18T03:41:00.000Z	n-iCe	jrib	 I don't get it
2010-03-18T03:41:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	what don't you get exactly?
2010-03-18T03:42:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	instead of doing "sudo zcat X > Y" instead do "zcat X | sudo tee Y"
2010-03-18T03:43:00.000Z	n-iCe	jrib	 sudo zcat boot.img.gz | sudo tee /dev/sdc1
2010-03-18T03:43:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	no need to sudo at the beginning
2010-03-18T03:44:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	except I guess you probably don't want the junk also printed to stdout, so maybe redirect stdout to /dev/null, or just use sudo -i, do what you must with the redirection, and then get out
2010-03-18T03:47:00.000Z	n-iCe	jrib	a lot of weird characters and sybols are being showed is it normal
2010-03-18T03:47:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	yes, see my last message
2011-09-13T00:48:00.000Z	jrib	n-iCe	are you a vampire?
