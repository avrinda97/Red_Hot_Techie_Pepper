2005-04-04T10:54:00.000Z	fangorious		so what's the hoary-updates apt repos that are default disabled?
2005-04-04T10:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 on april 7th, after hoary is released, they will ne no longer disabled
2005-04-04T10:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 consider them a placeholder at present
2005-04-04T10:57:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	how do they differ from the security updates repos?
2005-04-04T10:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 "updates" are changes to the stable release, which only happens for hoary on 6 april
2005-04-04T10:59:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	ok, I'll just ignore it untill then. thanks
2005-04-04T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 i'm about to speak of 802.11g, not 802.11b, so bear that in mind
2005-04-04T11:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 the linksys card, of the *same* model number etc, had at least four different revisions, all of which used a *different* chipset (and thus required a different driver) as ridiculous as that sounds
2005-04-04T11:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 quite the pain determining this of course, when someone tells you that you need driver "foo" for that model, etc.   is it possible that the same is true of yours?
2005-04-04T11:07:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	i've been using the orinoco driver bundled with the kernel for a long time, FC 1-3, ubuntu warty, ...
2005-04-04T11:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 oh, the same physical card?  then you know it's that driver, ignore what i said
2005-04-04T11:08:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	:)
2005-04-04T11:19:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	heh, I had the SSID messed up, it works now
2005-04-04T11:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 heh, glad it's working, frustrating when it turns out to be completely outside where you were looking :)
2005-04-23T10:06:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	are you talking about acroread?
2005-04-23T10:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 yes, and they'll want the js extention, i'm sure
2005-04-23T10:07:00.000Z	fangorious	eyequeue	does standalone acroread call home, or just the plugin?
2005-04-23T10:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	 the spyware requires javascript, hence requires the plugin
2006-09-23T16:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	fangorious	#ubuntu-xgl
