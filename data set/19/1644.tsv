2011-02-17T11:53:00.000Z	Ycarene		Anybody have issues with videos on youtube delaying and then acting strangely?
2011-02-17T11:53:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 other than buffering issues  no
2011-02-17T11:55:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 put the video on pause untill the buffer completes
2011-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 or install the  video downloadhelper plugin for firefox and simply download the video
2011-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 did you install the restricted extras?
2011-02-17T11:57:00.000Z	Ycarene	coz_	- restricted extras?
2011-02-17T11:57:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	Ycarene	coz_	- looks like I have it installed already.
2011-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 mm    in terminal   lcpci | grep -i vga
2011-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 yeah sorry   lspci | grep -i vga
2011-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 and you already installed the nvidia driver ...yes?
2011-02-17T12:01:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 did you install the nvidia driver?
2011-02-17T12:01:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 ok so you already rebooted after doing that
2011-02-17T12:02:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	which version of ubuntu are you running?
2011-02-17T12:03:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 then I am puzzled... it should be working fine with what you have
2011-02-17T12:05:00.000Z	Ycarene	coz_	- lemme try re-installing the flash plugin.
2011-02-17T12:10:00.000Z	Ycarene	coz_	- Ahh, that did it, for some reason firefox was using gnash instead of the adobe plugin.
2011-02-17T12:10:00.000Z	coz_	Ycarene	 there you go
2011-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	Ycarene	coz_	- That's strange, I installed gnash as an afterthought months ago, I wonder why it started using it over adobe, oh well, my own fault.
