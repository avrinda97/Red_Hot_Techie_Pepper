2008-07-23T17:00:00.000Z	econobeing		IIRC, NTFS doesn't have very good support with linux
2008-07-23T17:01:00.000Z	econobeing		if you're fortunate enough to have an external, back everything up with it. i never had any read problems with it
2008-07-23T17:01:00.000Z	econobeing		>_> wat
2008-07-23T17:01:00.000Z	econobeing		sorry...kinda drunk
2008-07-23T17:02:00.000Z	econobeing		well, if you're trying to dual boot
2008-07-23T17:02:00.000Z	econobeing		dunno if you are
2008-07-23T17:03:00.000Z	econobeing		but if you are. it's best to have your linux in a ext2/3 partition, windows in NTFS, then share files between a FAT32
2008-07-23T17:04:00.000Z	econobeing		when i dual booted, i had all my music/videos/etc on the FAT32. i kept my OS dedicated (NTFS/ext3) to a minimum size
2008-07-23T17:04:00.000Z	econobeing		maybe it's cause i'm drunk...but i pirate a lot of stuff too <_<
2008-07-23T17:05:00.000Z	econobeing		but generally people frown upon saying as such
