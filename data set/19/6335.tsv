2008-02-10T11:02:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	 thank you
2008-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	so alls well in 1680x1050?
2008-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	 yes
2008-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	everything is tiny on my 15" screen
2008-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	Awesome :)
2008-02-10T11:05:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	on 15" I'm thinking 1440x900 might be a better bet
2008-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	i like things small i still have issues with restart x freezing my computer showing only the background
2008-02-10T11:07:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	Ok, that might be an ATI driver problem
2008-02-10T11:08:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	so i basically need to rip my gpu out and find a way to put a nvidia gpu in my laptop
2008-02-10T11:09:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	 If that is even possible :(  ATI can be awkward... Some machines they run like absolute champs.  Others, like a couple of desktops I tried Ubuntu on, they crash the kernel after trying to switch to console or, god forbid! log out
2008-02-10T11:10:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	yep mine does the latter
2008-02-10T11:10:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	welcome to the misery of being an ATI user :(
2008-02-10T11:10:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	tis a temporary state i assure you
2008-02-10T11:11:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	im thinking a nice termite experiment is in order
2008-02-10T11:11:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	as it was with me... I bought my new desktop, and the first thing I did upon arriving home was to burn an Ubuntu disk, rip out the ATI card,slap in an nvidia, wipe out windows and install Linux
2008-02-10T11:33:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	Flickering playback?  Damn, sound EXACTLY like what I had going on b/f i replaced the ATI card...
2008-02-10T11:34:00.000Z	acee1235	cptnapalm	 im going around the world this summer so my laptop might set...stolen
2008-02-10T11:34:00.000Z	cptnapalm	acee1235	You should go to AMD and find the chip designer and beat them to death with it
