2006-09-04T06:34:00.000Z	medic30420		hi all, i am another noob at linux and need help
2006-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	medic30420		i have ubuntu installed on my laptop with very little hassle, but my desktop is hanging at installation
2006-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	medic30420		i have a 2.4GHz w/ 256RAM, i think the live CD is taking up too much memory
2006-09-04T06:36:00.000Z	cynical	medic30420	the livecd will work fine as long as you have 192MB of memory
2006-09-04T06:36:00.000Z	cynical	medic30420	where does it hang?
2006-09-04T06:36:00.000Z	medic30420		this is wierd, after the OS boots
2006-09-04T06:36:00.000Z	medic30420		if you click on anything it takes a very long time
2006-09-04T06:37:00.000Z	medic30420		over an hour to get to the timezone screen
2006-09-04T06:37:00.000Z	medic30420		cynical - i have switched CD's, CD Drives, done a memtest, no changes
2006-09-04T06:38:00.000Z	cynical	medic30420	wow thats odd
2006-09-04T06:38:00.000Z	medic30420		very strange, i think it is a hardware problem
2006-09-04T06:39:00.000Z	medic30420	cynical	is their an automatic installation that i can download? I think once i get linux inside my box everything will be ok
2006-09-04T06:39:00.000Z	cynical	medic30420	have you tried the alternative cd?
2006-09-04T06:40:00.000Z	cynical	medic30420	comes with a text-based installer so it shouldnt have the slowdown issues
2006-09-04T06:40:00.000Z	medic30420		oooo, that is what i need
