2008-01-31T17:37:00.000Z	sarmisak		so?
2008-01-31T17:37:00.000Z	sarmisak		what's the problem
2008-01-31T17:38:00.000Z	ludal-live	sarmisak	I can't copy, it says that it's mounted in read-only
2008-01-31T17:38:00.000Z	sarmisak		it's not ntfs right?
2008-01-31T17:38:00.000Z	ludal-live		no, fat32
2008-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	sarmisak		actually it seems to be mounted rw
2008-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	sarmisak		read/write
2008-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	sarmisak		did you try to cp something with sudo cp /path/smthign /mdia/disk/smthing
2008-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	ludal-live		no, with gui
2008-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	ludal-live		I'll try
2008-01-31T17:40:00.000Z	sarmisak		just popup a terminal
2008-01-31T17:40:00.000Z	sarmisak		it's usually the access restrictions
2008-01-31T17:40:00.000Z	sarmisak		the fastest way is sudo mkdir /media/disk/dir_name
2008-01-31T17:40:00.000Z	sarmisak		and then sudo chmod 0777 /media/disk/dir_name
2008-01-31T17:41:00.000Z	sarmisak		then you can r/w from the gui much easier
2008-01-31T17:42:00.000Z	ludal-live		I get the cp: omission du r√©pertoire `/media/disk-2/ludo/Desktop/sauvegardeSTOREX/spectacles/' error
2008-01-31T17:42:00.000Z	ludal-live		I'm french :)
2008-01-31T17:43:00.000Z	sarmisak	ludal-live	sorry my french is not that good :)
2008-01-31T17:43:00.000Z	sarmisak	ludal-live	can you read from the source?
