2011-10-26T08:03:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	"sudo apt-get purge remove chrome" in terminal :)
2011-10-26T08:04:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	no problem dude
2011-10-26T08:06:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	try "sudo apt-get purge remove chrome*"
2011-10-26T08:07:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	you may want to try http://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-linux-google-chrome-browser-download-install-and-usage#12-how-to-uninstall-google-chrome-from-ubuntu-linux   look on the right for how to uninstall
2011-10-26T08:09:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	no problems
2011-10-26T08:14:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	go to the software center and download synaptic package manager
2011-10-26T08:15:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	then use the synaptic package manager to remove chrome, "http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95319"

2011-10-26T08:15:00.000Z	alejandro__	TexasRussian	I will do that, but see this: dpkg -l | grep chrome did not find any google chrome package.
2011-10-26T08:29:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	what are you trying to do, did you already uninstall chrome?
2011-10-26T08:29:00.000Z	alejandro__	TexasRussian	I could remove it but installing a .deb that overwrote it and the installed the version I wanted.
2011-10-26T08:30:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	wait what? you just wanted to update it?
2011-10-26T08:31:00.000Z	alejandro__	TexasRussian	Yes.
2011-10-26T08:31:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	all you had to do is go to the wrench icon on the right of chrome, scroll down and click about chrome, and it would update..
2011-10-26T08:32:00.000Z	alejandro__	TexasRussian	That feature is disabled in Linux...
2011-10-26T08:32:00.000Z	TexasRussian	alejandro__	I use it all the time, it works for me.
