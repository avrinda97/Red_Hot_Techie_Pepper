2012-03-16T18:15:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	you can restart the entire x.org subsystem with ALT-PrntScr-K

2012-03-16T18:18:00.000Z	rileyp	mneptok	 yep I tried it

2012-03-16T18:19:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	quite right
2012-03-16T18:19:00.000Z	rileyp	mneptok	 so how can I just stop it?
2012-03-16T18:22:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	change it ti what?
2012-03-16T18:23:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	you want just KDE, or the apps that go along with a Kubuntu install?
2012-03-16T18:24:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2012-03-16T18:25:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	you'll be given a choice about which you want to run at the login screen
2012-03-16T18:26:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	why? just logout and back in.
2012-03-16T18:26:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	you'll be able to choose an XFCE or KDE session from the login screen
2012-03-16T18:27:00.000Z	rileyp	mneptok	I know that
2012-03-16T18:27:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	that's not going to do it, though.
2012-03-16T18:27:00.000Z	mneptok	rileyp	you can stop a display manager all you want. it's not going to change what session starts when you login.
2012-03-16T18:29:00.000Z	rileyp	mneptok	Ah ok so if my system start s as xfce4 and I drop to a tty and stop xfce4 and start kde this is not possible as it wil go to the dm menu?
2012-03-16T18:35:00.000Z	rileyp	mneptok	 I want xfce4 to start by default as it does with auto login and then when in xfce Id like to drop to a tty kill xfce4 and start kde is this possible? or must I logout of xfce4 and then login to kde?
2012-03-16T18:40:00.000Z	rileyp	mneptok	 I want xfce4 to start by default as it does with auto login and then when in xfce Id like to drop to a tty kill xfce4 and start kde or unity is this possible? or must I logout of xfce4 and then login to kde? I haven't tried kde in years or unity yet...:D
