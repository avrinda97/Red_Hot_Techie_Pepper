2008-05-31T21:27:00.000Z	bing_		how do i fix it
2008-05-31T21:27:00.000Z	bing_		i only installed ubuntu yesterday and its my 1st ever forray into linux
2008-05-31T21:27:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	try a 'mkdir ~/Desktop' and please keep your problem descriptions on one line
2008-05-31T21:29:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	yes, everything except the quote marks
2008-05-31T21:36:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	does the Desktop folder exist in your home now?
2008-05-31T21:36:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	did you type 'mkdir ~/Desktop' in the terminal?
2008-05-31T21:38:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	log out and log back in to see if the problem is resolved now (whatever it was...)
2008-05-31T21:56:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	please describe your entire problem on one line
2008-05-31T22:13:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	still here?
2008-05-31T22:15:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	I need to give you a big set of instructions, so please be patient while I type it up
2008-05-31T22:16:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	Type Alt-F2 and start gconf-editor. In there, go through apps-nautilus-preferences and find the entry called desktop_is_home_dir. Uncheck it if it is checked (I hope it is)
2008-05-31T22:19:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	gconf-editor (note the - )
2008-05-31T22:21:00.000Z	bing_	soundray	it was unchecked
2008-05-31T22:24:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	too bad... Would it be terrible to create a new user on your system and use that instead of your current one? It's easily done through System-Administration-Users and Groups. Make sure you give it all privileges.
2008-06-05T17:20:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	did you leave out the ./ ?
2008-06-05T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	cd ~/fuppes
2008-06-05T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	from then on follow the installation help page. Type everything except the $ marks
2008-06-05T17:27:00.000Z	soundray	bing_	instead of 'su -', type 'sudo make install' when you get there
2008-06-05T17:29:00.000Z	bing_	soundray	thank you
