2011-03-06T06:39:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kn100	did you try to simply run sudo update-grub2 in terminal?
2011-03-06T06:40:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	didn't detect windows
2011-03-06T06:40:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	the weird thing is windows was there before and nothings changed apart from an update afaik
2011-03-06T06:40:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kn100	hmm, you got 30_OS_Prober tagged as executable?
2011-03-06T06:40:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	sorr what? ;p
2011-03-06T06:41:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kn100	in /etc/grub.d a file named OS Prober, it has to be chmod +x so grub can use it when you do sudo update-grub2
2011-03-06T06:43:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	chowned it, no change
2011-03-06T06:44:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	could it be that the windows bootloader is somehow damaged?
2011-03-06T06:44:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kn100	dont think so, grub wouldnt really care if it was or not
2011-03-06T06:44:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	what else can I try/do
2011-03-06T06:45:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kn100	you might try purging and then reinstalling grub, i had to do that once after 10.10 upgrade
2011-03-06T06:45:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	sudo apt-get --purge remove <what>
2011-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kn100	poke grub remove in google, there is 2 parts to remove but i foget the exact names offhand
2011-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	erm, uninstalled grub-common
2011-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	reinstalling it as we speak
2011-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	kn100	Wiesshund	IT WORKED! <3 <3 <3 <3
