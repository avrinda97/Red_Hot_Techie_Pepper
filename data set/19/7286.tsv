2007-09-15T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	what version of ubuntu are you running, first
2007-09-15T09:20:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	i just downloaded the latest 10 mins ago
2007-09-15T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	64bit, 32bit?
2007-09-15T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	ok, put the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list on a pastebin   (in a terminal,   gedit /etc/apt/sources.list  will open it read-only)
2007-09-15T09:22:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	will try very soon, i tried reinstalling ubuntu now
2007-09-15T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	sure, it's an odd problem, I kinda looked forward to looking at it
2007-09-15T09:22:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	i didn't say i solved it :)
2007-09-15T09:23:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	boot from cd didn't help
2007-09-15T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	boot the hard disk, then do that pastebin thingy
2007-09-15T09:28:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	http://pastebin.ca/698604
2007-09-15T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	ok,  do sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install gparted ; if it fails, put up the complete error
2007-09-15T09:30:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	update part seems to work
2007-09-15T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	j416	good to go then
2007-09-15T09:31:00.000Z	j416	nickrud	you are the best, it worked! thank you so much
