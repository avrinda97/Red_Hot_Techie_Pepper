2012-03-20T17:14:00.000Z	Pratik		I have Ubuntu 11.10 installed on my laptop in dual boot mode. The grub comes, and I'm able to see the login screen as well. But I'm not able to sign in. Password and other details are correct. I can access all the files throught the virtual terminal. When I sign in, a black screen comes which does not even last for a second and then again the login screen comes.
2012-03-20T17:14:00.000Z	Pratik		Basically, I cannot access via GUI
2012-03-20T17:15:00.000Z	ome	Pratik	What Desktop Env. do you use ?
2012-03-20T17:16:00.000Z	Pratik	ome	yes
2012-03-20T17:17:00.000Z	ome	Pratik	try installing something else, (i.e gnome-shell) and see if something is wrong with Desktop Env. (the unity) or something else.
2012-03-20T17:17:00.000Z	Pratik	ome	what exactly do I need to install?
2012-03-20T17:18:00.000Z	Pratik	ome	ok fine
