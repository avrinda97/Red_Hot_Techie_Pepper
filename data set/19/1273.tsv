2011-04-06T13:32:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	what is the dns server?
2011-04-06T13:32:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	and is it supposed to be authoritative for the domain?
2011-04-06T13:33:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	how to check that?
2011-04-06T13:33:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	is that domain configured in bind? or is it someone else's domain?
2011-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	I have 3 linux servers 1st hold the domain and dns1 server
2011-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	authoritative means that the dns server is in charge of that domain
2011-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	non-authoritative means the dns server is not in charge of the domain and got the information from another server
2011-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	2. and 3. servers is only dns2 and dns3 servers
2011-04-06T13:35:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	how to fix this
2011-04-06T13:35:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	i don't really understand what you're doing
2011-04-06T13:35:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	if you own the domain and it's configured on all 3 servers then they're authoritative
2011-04-06T13:35:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	I want to delegate domain to my server
2011-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	catphish	patrykr	well that's done by your domain registrar
2011-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	I want to delegate domain using dns servers. I have change one of my server and must set up it again
2011-04-06T13:39:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	but I have dns servers on my machines
2011-04-06T13:41:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	I already have master domain registed, and my server hold it, but I would like to add next one
2011-04-06T13:42:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	It doesnt matte?
2011-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	patrykr	catphish	I have only add domain entry on master server, and it fix that but only for master
