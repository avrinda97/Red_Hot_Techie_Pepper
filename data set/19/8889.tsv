2007-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky		hey guys. ok, thats how my fstab looks like: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2278/ - now, that thing mounts sda1 as swap right? but i definitely know that sdc is where all my linux stuff is, including the swap on sdc5
2007-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky		so whats up with that sda? :D
2007-01-20T07:56:00.000Z	BULLE	nfp|kelnoky	your fstab says it mounts sda1 as rootfs
2007-01-20T07:57:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	yeah, but look at that: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2280/
2007-01-20T07:58:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky		and if I look up the properties of my linux partitions in thunar it says sdc as well
2007-01-20T07:58:00.000Z	BULLE	nfp|kelnoky	and what does just "mount" say ?
2007-01-20T07:59:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2281/
2007-01-20T08:00:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	any idea? :|
2007-01-20T08:00:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky		it seems as if ubuntu ignores my fstab^^
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	BULLE	nfp|kelnoky	not realy no
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	BULLE	nfp|kelnoky	its a bit wierd imho
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky		well thanks anyway
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky		yeah, thats why i asked :D
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	BULLE	nfp|kelnoky	have you added/removed any disks or other ide devices since you did the original install ?
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	yes, i did
2007-01-20T08:02:00.000Z	BULLE	nfp|kelnoky	mhm, so then that is the cause atleast, exactly what happened, i dunno
2007-01-20T08:02:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	i added another harddrive just now - its sdb.
2007-01-20T08:02:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	before that my linux harddrive always was sdb
2007-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	nfp|kelnoky	BULLE	but well, i really dont need the stuff on sdb and sda, i only wanna be sure if i can delete them
