2006-09-23T15:23:00.000Z	Asc	silent_scream	oh, an actual command.  Probably out of my league.
2006-09-23T15:28:00.000Z	Asc	silent_scream	This probably won't help, but try going to the 'fonts' option tab, unchecking the first button, and checking the second.  And, like, pressing apply.
2006-09-23T15:31:00.000Z	silent_scream	Asc	i can't read re menus!!! its in like "???!#@ !? ??!232"
2006-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	Asc	silent_scream	Okay.  Open the menu.  'options' is the fourth entry from the bottom.  It'll open a submenu, and preferences is the first entry on that
2006-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	silent_scream	Asc	what is the shortkey i must press to open the menu?
2006-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	Asc	silent_scream	just click at the top-left of the window

2006-09-23T15:35:00.000Z	Asc		Once you get there, 'fonts' is the sixth tab from the left

2006-09-23T15:36:00.000Z	Asc		Or whatever the heck library is equivalent to ALSA-dev these days
