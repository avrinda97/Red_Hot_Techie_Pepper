2008-03-09T19:11:00.000Z	dda		is there a way to use webcam installed on another machine?
2008-03-09T19:13:00.000Z	dda		both PCs are mine
2008-03-09T19:13:00.000Z	dda		on the same LAN
2008-03-09T19:14:00.000Z	dda		but webcam is buggy in linux, so I thought I could install it on other PC (windows) and use as networked
2008-03-09T19:14:00.000Z	gerro	dda	yeah dda that sounds good but why you asking here though this isn't a windows chat
2008-03-09T19:15:00.000Z	gerro	dda	I've found very few nice windows programs for webcams perhaps someone wrote some oss stuff cross compiled can check though
2008-03-09T19:15:00.000Z	dda	gerro	because I want to know if I can use such networked webcam in linux applications (ekiga for example)
2008-03-09T19:16:00.000Z	gerro	dda	you probably can but what webcam is it anyway? I might know how to get it working on linux
2008-03-09T19:16:00.000Z	dda	gerro	it's Logitech Fusion, it is known as buggy on linux :(
2008-03-09T19:21:00.000Z	gerro	dda	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205782 seems your cam might work with the basic spca drivers but you'll have to compile them and tell them which system id your camera is (do lsusb and its the second part of that mac)
2008-03-09T19:22:00.000Z	dda	gerro	thanks, I will look again, but i tried something like that before! I will let you know.
2008-03-09T19:22:00.000Z	gerro	dda	most the logitech cameras up until that version have worked fine I doubt they've changed much about their software, just fix the system id the driver uses to refer to the camera and it should work
2008-03-09T19:24:00.000Z	dda	gerro	the camera suffers from "reset bug", in UVC driver.
2008-03-09T19:25:00.000Z	gerro	dda	has anyone posted a patch for that bug yet?
2008-03-09T19:25:00.000Z	gerro	dda	maybe some way you can deny its resets
2008-03-09T19:26:00.000Z	gerro	dda	do you have the link to the bug report?
2008-03-09T19:26:00.000Z	dda	gerro	yes, and I tried to apply it. after that luvcview (a program by UVC driver developer) works, and shows vieo, but skype and camorama do not
2008-03-09T19:28:00.000Z	dda	gerro	here are some links related to the patch: http://osdir.com/ml/drivers.uvc.devel/2006-11/msg00040.html and http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2007-April/001562.html
2008-03-09T19:30:00.000Z	dda	gerro	I have to go now, will try after some time and let you know. thanks!
