2007-01-30T07:45:00.000Z	shmeelAway		-.-
2007-01-30T07:46:00.000Z	shmeelAway		but that's only in the terminal right?
2007-01-30T07:46:00.000Z	shmeelAway		can i get root access out of terminal? i'm not the greatest at this script stuff
2007-01-30T07:47:00.000Z	shmeelAway		like, my mounted windows partition says root only for writing stuff, i wanted to get something from my edgy partition to the windows one
2007-01-30T07:47:00.000Z	shmeelAway		no, it's read/write
2007-01-30T07:48:00.000Z	shmeelAway		but i need root permission
2007-01-30T07:48:00.000Z	shmeelAway		it says "owner: root" folder acess "create and delete files"
2007-01-30T07:48:00.000Z	shmeelAway		I have it mounted already
2007-01-30T07:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Use "sudo command..." to do things as 'root'
2007-01-30T07:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Yes you can, but you need to add a simple script to Gnome to allow you to open directories as root
2007-01-30T07:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Let me get mine, you can copy it
2007-01-30T07:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	I'm just pasting it on pastebin, i'll give you the URL in a moment
2007-01-30T07:57:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Try this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/3414/
2007-01-30T07:57:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Once you restart nautilus, you can Right-Click on and directory or file and choose "Scripts > Open As Administrator"
2007-01-30T07:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Hang On!! There's a critical typo!!
2007-01-30T08:00:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	Yes, it is... here's the corrected instructions: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/3416/
2007-01-30T08:00:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	shmeelAway	I typed the wrong directory name for gnome2 :)
