2005-04-17T07:44:00.000Z	socomm		I want a modded seXBox.
2005-04-17T07:45:00.000Z	socomm		X-Box is a better toy.
2005-04-17T07:45:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	X-Box also uses restricted formats
2005-04-17T07:46:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	PS2 also uses restricted formats
2005-04-17T07:46:00.000Z	socomm	whiskers	Huh?
2005-04-17T07:46:00.000Z	socomm	whiskers	Huh?
2005-04-17T07:47:00.000Z	socomm	whiskers	Just buy a secondhand X-Box, mod it, and be done with it.
2005-04-17T07:48:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	well my understanding is that they made mods illegal
2005-04-17T07:48:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	so you can't even mod an Xbox
2005-04-17T07:48:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	or a PS2
2005-04-17T07:49:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	true but the Patriot Act and the DMCA prevent modding anything
2005-04-17T07:55:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	that is why i said this stuff is debatable
2005-04-22T12:52:00.000Z	socomm	whiskers	totem-xine
2005-04-22T12:52:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	no..just totem-ogg-theora
2005-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	the last i saw xine was for playing proprietary stuff
2005-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	socomm	whiskers	totem is alot better with the xine backend.
2005-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	well i am sure...but we cannot use it in the US
2005-04-22T12:54:00.000Z	whiskers	socomm	of course elsewhere it may be legal..i don't know
2005-04-22T12:54:00.000Z	socomm	whiskers	Only illegal if you get caught.
