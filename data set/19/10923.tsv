2006-04-23T06:32:00.000Z	nopcode_		hey
2006-04-23T06:32:00.000Z	nopcode_		i just read the following sentence 'Have you ever wondered who the people behind Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu are and what they do?'
2006-04-23T06:32:00.000Z	nopcode_		ehrm.
2006-04-23T06:33:00.000Z	nopcode_		is there a seperate distribution depending on which windowmanager you want?
2006-04-23T06:33:00.000Z	nopcode_		is there a seperate ubuntu-distribution for each window-manager?
2006-04-23T06:34:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	sorta, but in theory you can install any windows-manager/desktop environment in any distro.
2006-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	nopcode_	capiCrimm	i mean this really sounds like utter bullshit to me
2006-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	why?
2006-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	nopcode_	capiCrimm	because usually linux systems are multiuser
2006-04-23T06:35:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	so?
2006-04-23T06:36:00.000Z	nopcode_	capiCrimm	so? i'd have to think hard to come up with anything a distro could do window-manager specific
2006-04-23T06:36:00.000Z	nopcode_	capiCrimm	that is, i don't understand the distribution/wm coupling at all.
2006-04-23T06:36:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	it's just a program
2006-04-23T06:37:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	just what they install by default
2006-04-23T06:38:00.000Z	nopcode_	capiCrimm	to save the user from selecting something while installing?
2006-04-23T06:38:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	by distro's you mean different versions of Ubuntu?
2006-04-23T06:39:00.000Z	nopcode_	capiCrimm	kubuntu etc, yeah
2006-04-23T06:40:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	yeah it's pretty much the default software they install and what they focus on more than anything. If you really want you can get a fairly bare system by typing ``server'' at install.
2006-04-23T06:41:00.000Z	capiCrimm	nopcode_	like nubuntu is focused on security and speed I believe.
