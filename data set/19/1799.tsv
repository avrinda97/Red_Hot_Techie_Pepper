2010-10-06T04:09:00.000Z	collosi	sjm	 not really, but I think you want to open a dictionary program using keyboard shortcuts?
2010-10-06T04:10:00.000Z	sjm		colllosi:  not just open it, also to get word meaning direct from that shortcuts
2010-10-06T04:12:00.000Z	collosi	sjm	 the only thing I know that can do something like that is a program called gnome-do, but it does a lot more than just that.  You might want to give it a try
2010-10-06T04:12:00.000Z	sjm		colllosi:  so no need to write the words just i will put the mouse on it and i will get the meaning automaticlly
2010-10-06T04:13:00.000Z	sjm	collosi	 thanks for your help
2010-10-06T04:13:00.000Z	collosi	sjm	 you wan this to be done in a browser or just in general withing your ubuntu environment?
2010-10-06T04:13:00.000Z	sjm		i will try it
2010-10-06T04:15:00.000Z	sjm	collosi	 in browser or in general withing ubuntu environment
2010-10-06T04:17:00.000Z	collosi	sjm	 best thing I could find was this, but it's not exactly what you wanted  http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/171440/add_a_desktop_dictionary_to_ubuntu.html
