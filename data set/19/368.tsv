2012-06-07T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 clarify for me what ABI is..  its 4 am here.
2012-06-14T15:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 whats your ram size
2012-06-14T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	you wont see much gain by 64bit. doing a full normal install would help more
2012-06-14T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 you want better performance - do a full normal install
2012-06-14T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 i find that doubtfull
2012-06-14T15:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	there is no 64bit wubi that i know of.
2012-06-16T18:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	  you dont a 'sudo apt-get update' lately? I just install the nvidia-current package normally
2012-06-16T18:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 then you dont need anything to do with Nvidia.
2012-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 not that ive ever seen in the real word.. theres always a posibillity
2012-07-02T00:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 if its using a serial connection, you would use some sort of serial terminal app. Unless its set up to use SLIP or some other sort of network0ng over serial port thing.
2012-07-02T00:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 does the thing have some sort of ip# over the serial port?
2012-07-02T00:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 you can have an ip for yur local lan. and not be on the 'net'
2012-07-02T00:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 you may be needing to check the docs for that   board.
2012-07-02T00:22:00.000Z	angs	Dr_Willis	it has a static IP number that I assigned before
2012-07-02T00:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	angs	 then it does have an ip...
