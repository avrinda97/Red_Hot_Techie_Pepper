2006-06-19T16:24:00.000Z	scheuri		I try to install VMware Server on Ubuntu Server, but it lacks certain libraries...how do I find out which library is provided by which package? Thanks a lot for help
2006-06-19T16:24:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	apt-file
2006-06-19T16:24:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	thanks...I trying that just now
2006-06-19T16:25:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	uhmm...apt-file is not a command, I guess I need to install another package before using that?
2006-06-19T16:26:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	Actually, apt-file is what I use on my debian servers.  Ubuntu probably has it too, in either case, you have to install it.
2006-06-19T16:26:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	I am on it...thanks...:)
2006-06-19T16:29:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	THOUSAND thanks...it worked perfectly fine....
2006-06-19T16:37:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	Depends.  I use apt-get and dpkg.
2006-06-19T16:37:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	Some things just need dpkg.
2006-06-19T16:38:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	well, apt-get does not handle dependencies that well as aptitude is able to...when removing stuff or upgrading it, aptitude takes better care of deps
2006-06-19T16:39:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	apt-get is more reserved, afaik.
2006-06-19T16:40:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	that is possible...
2006-06-19T07:05:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	I have a suspicion he's compiling something.
2006-06-19T07:06:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	aye, sounds like that
2006-06-19T07:12:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	I tend to assume people aren't idiots.
2006-06-19T07:12:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	scheuri	Therefore, I've assumed he's NOT setting up an ftp server with firefox(!) :)
2006-06-19T07:12:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	me too, usually...but sometimes it is hard to assume so...;)
2006-06-19T07:20:00.000Z	scheuri	Arafangi1n	;)
