2010-01-29T10:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	ubuntu	sounds ok to me, not sure why it takes so long to use the cd
2010-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	blakkheim	ubuntu	you don't have to do all that just to find the grub version lol, if it's 9.10 it's grub2, if it's earlier it's not
2010-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	blakkheim	ubuntu	then it's grub2
2010-01-29T11:07:00.000Z	ubuntu	blakkheim	dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc this command, the instructions say taht i have to press SPACEBAR to select the device
2010-10-11T03:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	ubuntu	you can only have 4 primary partitions on a disk with MBR
