2005-04-12T08:37:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	ntldr is the nt loader - windows stuff

2005-04-12T08:38:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	i cna boot unbuntu i want to boto windows
2005-04-12T08:38:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	i but ubuntu on the sedond partition of my hdd and it runs fine, but the NTLDR is gone and i cant boot XP and i have a lan party tommorw :(
2005-04-12T08:39:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	grub is there?
2005-04-12T08:39:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	and you can boot ubuntu still?
2005-04-12T08:39:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	i believe so grub/lilo
2005-04-12T08:39:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	i can boot ubuntu rgr
2005-04-12T08:40:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	and you could boot windows from grub before?
2005-04-12T08:40:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	i installed ubuntu yester day and i've booted into it three times, i tried XP and it gave me the NTLDR missing error
2005-04-12T08:43:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	i've never booted windows from grub
2005-04-12T08:47:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	one sollution you could try, is to boot the Windows XP install cd and try to use the rescue command line and try the fixmbr and fixboot - that will ruine the grub boot loader, but you could fix that after your lan party
2005-04-12T09:41:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	correct
2005-04-12T09:41:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	martinhj	well i ahve hoary live cd
2005-04-12T09:41:00.000Z	martinhj	Jamminpotato	it's solveable :-)
