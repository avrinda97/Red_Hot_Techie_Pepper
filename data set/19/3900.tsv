2009-06-06T11:52:00.000Z	kandinski		hi, in upgrading my computer to jaunty the networking broke: ifconfig only finds the loopback interface
2009-06-06T11:52:00.000Z	kandinski		obviously I cant apt-get install -f to depants it; can anybody help me diagnose and fix the problem?
2009-06-06T11:53:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	you might try restarting with the previus kernel .. to see if that fixes anything
2009-06-06T11:53:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	good point, will try that
2009-06-06T12:00:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	you rock, going back to the previous kernel fixed it, thanks
2009-06-06T12:00:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	doing that may or may not break other things
2009-06-06T12:01:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	well, as long as it fixes networking...
2009-06-06T12:02:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	getting that error from apt?
2009-06-06T12:02:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	from aptitude, yes
2009-06-06T12:03:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	you still have a broken system - and it may take a little figuring out to get you back to golden
2009-06-06T12:06:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	can you give me a clue on how to start diagnosing it? It is testimony to ubuntu's goodness that I have been using it for four years now, but it has mostly worked till now, so I don't even know where to start poking
2009-06-06T12:08:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	firstly you can search on ubuntuforums.org for people having the same errors as you... 2 google search ubuntu jaunty networking broken on upgrade
2009-06-06T12:09:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	except that the problem now is not broken networking, but broken apt
2009-06-06T12:09:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	thanks
2009-06-06T12:10:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	apt is broken because apt was upgraded - using the broken(new) kernel apt would work
2009-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	fccf	kandinski	tritium: apt/dpkg will not while the intrepid kernel is loaded... must fix jaunty kernel for networking or apt to work
2009-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	tritium: note that I am using kernel 2.6.27.14 now and jaunty kernel is 2.6.28.12 (but my networking does not work under jaunty kernel)
2009-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	why does dpkg require the jaunty kernel?
2009-06-06T12:30:00.000Z	kandinski	fccf	thanks for the advice, and I am doing it just to give it a try, but surely the problem is in the databases and not in the dpkg-kernel interaction?
