2007-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight		yeah it does suck
2007-04-17T08:25:00.000Z	xtknight		recurse subdirectories(of what?)
2007-04-17T08:26:00.000Z	xtknight		extract .rars within a .rar?
2007-04-17T08:27:00.000Z	xtknight		just with x you would have all your folders
2007-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	xtknight		yeah it does it for you

2007-04-17T08:34:00.000Z	xtknight		bill__k, make sure you have permissions there.
2007-04-17T08:34:00.000Z	bill__k	xtknight	bruenig unrar x -pmypassword /media/externalhdd/billy\'s\ stuff/me.rar (while working in directory i wished to extract to)
2007-04-17T08:34:00.000Z	xtknight	bill__k	nononononono nooo
2007-04-17T08:35:00.000Z	xtknight	bill__k	70gigs of root files? :P
2007-04-17T08:35:00.000Z	xtknight	bill__k	well what was the owner of them?
2007-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	bill__k	xtknight	would ls -alAg /media/,.../blah.rar do it?
2007-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	xtknight	bill__k	not sure what that would do?
2007-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	xtknight	bill__k	what  is in the rar file? anything permissions-sensitive?
2007-04-17T08:39:00.000Z	xtknight	bill__k	anyways if the permissions dont matter then just sudo it i guess.  you can always change perms later
2007-04-17T08:42:00.000Z	bill__k	xtknight	bruenig thanks for your help, extracting now.  Just hope media/drive2 (empty 80gb drive) doesnt fill up before it finishes!
