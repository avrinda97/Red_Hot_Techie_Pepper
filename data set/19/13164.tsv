2005-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Rocha		Hello
2005-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Rocha		I'm trying to install a network printer
2005-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Rocha		How can I know if it uses SMB or CUPS ?
2005-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	jmjones	Rocha	is it your printer, or at work?
2005-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	at work
2005-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	jmjones	Rocha	can you ask the sysadmin or the person it belongs to?
2005-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	the sysadmin doesn't know
2005-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	jmjones	Rocha	is it a printer attached to a windows machine?
2005-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	it's a woman
2005-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	jmjones	Rocha	does it matter that it's a woman?
2005-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	no, but she doesn't understand anything about system administration
2005-07-10T08:39:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	i don't know if it's a windows machine
2005-07-10T08:39:00.000Z	jmjones	Rocha	then the problem is an incompetent sysadmin - not that she's a woman
2005-07-10T08:39:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	if it is a windows machine, it uses smb right?
2005-07-10T08:39:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	yes, you're right.
2005-07-10T08:39:00.000Z	jmjones	Rocha	if it's a windows machine, you should be able to setup a windows share and access it as a samba printer, yes.

2005-07-10T08:42:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	she said she thinks it's a linux machine
2005-07-10T08:42:00.000Z	Rocha	jmjones	but she doesn't know if it's using cups or smb
