2011-08-12T17:48:00.000Z	bretton		I gotta display problem. When I put a software fullscreen, it becomes all white. For example vlc when I read a video.
2011-08-12T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	Which desktop do you use?
2011-08-12T17:48:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	gnome
2011-08-12T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	with compiz?
2011-08-12T17:49:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	compiz fusion I think
2011-08-12T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	same thing, if you use natty, log of and log in to the 'Ubuntu Classic' session. If you use Lucid or Maverick press ALT+F2 and run:  metacity --replace
2011-08-12T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	this will take compiz out of the equation, is it still the same?
2011-08-12T17:50:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	but I won't have desktop effects with ubuntu classic ?
2011-08-12T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	no but it's simply to test. It's not forever. It's called "Isolating the issue"
2011-08-12T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	if its ok without effects then we KNOW what is causing the issue, don't we
2011-08-12T17:52:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	ok I test if I have this problem
2011-08-12T17:53:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	so the problem if the test works come from my video card driver ?
2011-08-12T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	no it's compiz, not the video driver
2011-08-12T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	then you can start to find guides on issus like yours with compiz and ask in #compiz too :)
2011-08-12T17:58:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	that was it :)
2011-08-12T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	so now you know the root cause
2011-08-12T18:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	so you can direct 100% of your effort finding out what the deal is with compiz as you KNOW that is the thing causing the issue
2011-08-12T18:00:00.000Z	bretton	ActionParsnip	yeah, I'm on #compiz. I hope someone'll answer.
2011-08-12T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bretton	you could also search the bugs to see if it's been reported
