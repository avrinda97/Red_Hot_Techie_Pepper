2005-05-03T15:29:00.000Z	Traderjb		I was the poor dope who needed help on passwords and root stuff
2005-05-03T15:29:00.000Z	Traderjb		Some nice person told me to go and type "users" in a terminal
2005-05-03T15:30:00.000Z	Traderjb		Well, if I am in a different room, maybe one of you good folk out there can help me out?
2005-05-03T15:30:00.000Z	Traderjb		:)
2005-05-03T15:31:00.000Z	Traderjb		I just got this Ubuntu linux
2005-05-03T15:32:00.000Z	Traderjb		And need to configure my networking for wifi.  It seems that I can do much, because I get a popup dialog box asking for my password
2005-05-03T15:32:00.000Z	Traderjb		Well I give my user password, but it says it is incorrect
2005-05-03T15:32:00.000Z	Traderjb		When I installed Ubuntu, it never once asked me for a root password of any kind.
2005-05-03T15:32:00.000Z	Traderjb		Please help
