2009-09-26T05:36:00.000Z	donnybrasco		I'm having trouble installing kubuntu to my other system - apparently this bug applies, but I have no clue what to do about it https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/312554
2009-09-26T05:36:00.000Z	donnybrasco		can anyone help/walk me through this?
2009-09-26T05:38:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	the bug was fixed, how is it still affecting you?
2009-09-26T05:40:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	when did you download/burn the iso?
2009-09-26T05:40:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	just last night
2009-09-26T05:42:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	whatever is happening I doubt it's this bug, can you paste the error in a pastebin?
2009-09-26T05:43:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	ok - give me one sec, cause I'll have to type it out (it's on my other system)
2009-09-26T05:52:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	sorry for the wait - here it is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/278343/
2009-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	I see, well if the latest kernel in JJ isn't working right then either a downgrade to II or try out KK.
2009-09-26T06:00:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	thanks very much for your time - I figured that I might get that answer eventually, but I
2009-09-26T06:00:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	**I'm just learning
2009-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	what MB/cpu?
2009-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	didn't want to just jump to that solution if there was an oppurtunity to learn more
2009-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	hang on- let me check
2009-09-26T06:02:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	there is, but if this is a new install it's not worth the headache. Although if your up to it try and find a newer kernel for JJ in the PPAs but you need to chroot to your install from a live cd to install it.
2009-09-26T06:12:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	I can't seem to find out what mb/cpu I'm running - it's an ACER Aspire t325
2009-09-26T06:15:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	I think I'm just going to try II or KK, like you suggested - unfortunately haven't had that much time to fool around on the computers lately
2009-09-26T06:15:00.000Z	donnybrasco	durt	thank you so much for your help, though
2009-09-26T06:16:00.000Z	durt	donnybrasco	sorry I couldn't help more.
