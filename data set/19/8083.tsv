2008-08-20T01:51:00.000Z	siloko		do I stop USB harddrives from being automounted when I plug themin?
2008-08-20T01:52:00.000Z	Syngin	siloko	 edit /etc/fstab i think
2008-08-20T01:53:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	I thought that was just for mounts at boot
2008-08-20T01:53:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	Mine has no mention of external drives, just my local partitions
2008-08-20T01:54:00.000Z	Syngin		agreed Legendario
2008-08-20T01:54:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	it really annoys me - I have a large external hd with multiple partitions and every time I plug it in I get a shower of gnome file managers pissing all over my screen!!!
2008-08-20T01:54:00.000Z	Syngin		lol, siloko
2008-08-20T01:55:00.000Z	Syngin		i'll think of something
2008-08-20T01:55:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	there used to be a preferences option - but Canonical, in their wisdom, trashed it a couple of versions back . . .
2008-08-20T01:56:00.000Z	Syngin		oh ye
2008-08-20T01:56:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	but it must have been a front to some file somewhere - just don't know what it is :(
2008-08-20T01:56:00.000Z	Syngin	siloko	 was is removable drives and media
2008-08-20T01:57:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	yes - but the HD option is longer there
2008-08-20T01:57:00.000Z	Syngin		ahh, ok
2008-08-20T01:58:00.000Z	Syngin	siloko	have you checked on ubuntuforums
2008-08-20T01:58:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	There's an old post - I'll look again - thanks anyway
2008-08-20T02:02:00.000Z	siloko		Are wildcards allowed in fstab (e.g /dev/sdb*) ?
2008-08-20T02:03:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	you were right - I have to add entries to potential device names and stop thembeing mounted with the 'noauto' flag . . .
2008-08-20T02:03:00.000Z	siloko	Syngin	I wnated to do /dev/sdb* mountpoint NONE with nosuto option
