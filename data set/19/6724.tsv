2007-12-17T06:49:00.000Z	bjbdrgn		slight problem, I accidentally removed some packages via synaptic.. now I can't seem to install them with either synaptic,adept,apt-get, or aptitude
2007-12-17T06:50:00.000Z	bjbdrgn		anyone know if totally removing packages makes it very difficult to restore them?
2007-12-17T06:50:00.000Z	bjbdrgn		right nwo all that matches beryl is libberyldecoration0 and libberylsettings0
2007-12-17T06:50:00.000Z	bjbdrgn		*now
2007-12-17T06:52:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	If you no longer have the repo enabled, or those packages no longer exist on the repo, then that may happen.
2007-12-17T06:52:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	oh. perhaps that's why it's bugged out ever since i upgraded to gutsy
2007-12-17T06:52:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	In any case, are you trying to install Beryl? And if so, is there a reason you want to use it instead of Compiz (which ships with Gutsy)?
2007-12-17T06:53:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	i was using beryl, thought that was the more well-known fork
2007-12-17T06:53:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	Ahh, remember that the dist-upgrader in Ubuntu will disable all your 3rd party repos.
2007-12-17T06:53:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	Well, I don't know if you've already heard, but Beryl's discontinued and all the work is going into Compiz and Compiz Fusion. Check in at #compiz-fusion if you have any more questions on this. :)
2007-12-17T06:53:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	I don't have third party ones, but I do have all the restricted/universe/multiverse
2007-12-17T06:54:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	hopefully compiz has the handy fullscreen thing
2007-12-17T06:55:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	alt-enter and most apps would toggle (was a setting in beryl's config)
2007-12-17T07:06:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	thanks, worked fine, and i'm upgraded properly
2007-12-17T07:00:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	That fullscreen toggling action is now in a plugin called "extrawm" (Extra WM Actions), which is inside compiz-fusion-plugins-extra.
2007-12-17T07:01:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	ahh, downloading everything that matched compiz right now
2007-12-17T07:01:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	If you used the standard dist-upgrader I think compiz would have been auto-installed already... maybe not plugins-extra though.
2007-12-17T07:16:00.000Z	bjbdrgn	Fyda	know where compiz settings are stored, for Ring Switcher? I can't seem to set the key macro in Actions
2007-12-17T07:17:00.000Z	Fyda	bjbdrgn	For Compiz-specific questions I would recommend that you ask in #compiz-fusion
