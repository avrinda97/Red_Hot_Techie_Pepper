2007-05-03T08:39:00.000Z	robinsjostrom		my screen goes black when trying to run ubuntu cd
2007-05-03T08:40:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	Do you have an ATI card?
2007-05-03T08:40:00.000Z	robinsjostrom	strabes	yes ati x700
2007-05-03T08:42:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	You don't actually have to download the alternate CD.
2007-05-03T08:42:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	PM me and i'll walk you through it
2007-05-03T08:44:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	Are you there?
2007-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	The only real difference is that you don't boot into a gui to install it. The install is kind of text based. It's basically like the windows XP installer.
2007-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	robinsjostrom	strabes	ok so the partition part and stuff is exactly the same as the regular install?
2007-05-03T08:51:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	well, no, there's no pretty GUI. You don't have to use the alternate CD to install ubuntu even though you have a card that needs the proprietary fglrx driver. If you PM me i can walk you through it.
2007-05-03T08:56:00.000Z	strabes	robinsjostrom	no
