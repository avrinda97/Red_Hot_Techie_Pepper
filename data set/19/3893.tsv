2009-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	Crash1hd		Hmm can anyone walk me through creating a ssl x11vnc connection between windows and ubuntu?
2009-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	which way?
2009-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	connecting to ubuntu from windows
2009-05-09T00:33:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	do you really need full desktop access or just access to graphical programs?
2009-05-09T00:34:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	would like full desktop but what where you thinking re just graphical prog?
2009-05-09T00:34:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	Graphical access to linux machines is most intuitive when you tunnel an X connection over ssh imho.
2009-05-09T00:35:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	ahh how would I do that?
2009-05-09T00:38:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	Something like this: http://www.tjansson.dk/?p=163
2009-05-09T00:39:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	That will tell you how to get an x server for windows. Then you do what guntbert said and use Putty or another ssh client to connect to your ubuntu machine. When you run graphical programs, the window will open on your windows machine.
2009-05-09T00:40:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	guntbert cool thanks :)
2009-05-09T01:00:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	the daemon?
2009-05-09T01:00:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	yeah I think if thats the word for server
2009-05-09T01:00:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	as long as you keep it patched and either use very strong passwords or shared keys
2009-05-09T01:01:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	If it's really critical, probably want shared keys or shared keys + password
2009-05-09T01:01:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	hmm might want to look into shared keys can you have both a strong pass and shared keys?
2009-05-09T01:01:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	lol :)
2009-05-09T01:01:00.000Z	Crash1hd	brassmaster	Is there a way of making it so that ssh only works inside my local network?
2009-05-09T01:02:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	what trirnoth said.
2009-05-09T01:02:00.000Z	brassmaster	Crash1hd	yes
