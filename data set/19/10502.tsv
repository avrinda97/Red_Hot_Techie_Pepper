2006-06-15T06:47:00.000Z	b14ck		how can i get rid of the forced filesystem check?
2006-06-15T06:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	you really don't want to do that ....
2006-06-15T06:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	so don't ask in a support channel how to kill your OS, ;)
2006-06-15T06:48:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	 but my pc crashes very often and i'm tired of waiting 5 min for it to start again
2006-06-15T06:48:00.000Z	b14ck		lol
2006-06-15T06:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	perhaps figure out what's causing your pc to crash?
2006-06-15T06:49:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	 it's very old...>.<
2006-06-15T06:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	have you run memcheck?
2006-06-15T06:49:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	 no
2006-06-15T06:50:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	well that's step #1 - reboot to grub & select memtest
2006-06-15T06:50:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	 but i think that may be the problem. when i removed one of the ram i have it stopped for some time
2006-06-15T06:50:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	most problems show up in 30mins, though leaving it to run overnight's a good plan
2006-06-15T06:51:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	ok so i just do that. thanx
2006-06-15T06:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	try reseating the dims/sims & then maybe try slacking off the bios memory times can help
2006-06-15T06:52:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	 if i figure out what u said i might just try that :P
2006-06-15T06:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	reseat = take memory out, clean pins with an eraser, put back in
2006-06-15T06:53:00.000Z	Frogzoo	b14ck	then google -> memory timing bios
2006-06-15T06:53:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	lol oky. i'm not english. i understand now :P
2006-06-15T06:54:00.000Z	b14ck	Frogzoo	 thanx dude. baybay
