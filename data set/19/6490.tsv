2009-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Hey guys
2009-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Got a problem with my Ubuntu 8.10 -- The automounter for USB sticks doesnt work
2009-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80		It comes up and says "cannot mount [key name], root privileges required"
2009-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	does the partition show up in sudo fdisk -l
2009-02-17T18:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	ikonia Yeah it all works ok if I plug it in then do sudo mount -a
2009-04-07T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	you dont, if you do you will get a big mess
2009-04-07T05:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	no -- there is a utility to do it
2009-04-07T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	jaunty debs are for jaunty, intrepid debs are for intrepid. if you mix them yuo WILL get a big mess
2009-04-07T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	thats why the sources file is not univrsal and specifies the release you have
2009-04-07T05:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	If you do it correctly - you wont get a big mess, I know what I am doing - there is a tool to pull jaunty sources for specific packages you mark
2009-04-07T05:30:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	Unless you happen to know why the heck wpa-supplicant remains broken even after several hundred bug reports
2009-04-07T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	its your system, all i can do is advise
2009-04-07T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	i dont use wpa, too much faffing around
2011-08-23T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	boot to root recovery console and reset it there
2011-08-23T21:37:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	Well yeah I tried that, I select "recovery mode" from the boot menu but I never get to a command prompt
2011-08-23T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	select root from the next screen, you should get another screen
2011-08-23T21:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	there is no next screen, it acts like it is booting up and then just ... stops
2011-08-23T21:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cpudan80	you can always boot to liveCD then chroot
2011-08-23T21:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ActionParsnip	Ok I can try that
