2005-07-22T05:04:00.000Z	parka		hi. may i kindly ask for your help
2005-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	parka		nautilus goes nuts when i try to access my home ... dontknowthewordinenglish
2005-07-22T05:06:00.000Z	topyli	parka	nuts how?
2005-07-22T05:09:00.000Z	topyli	parka	can you ls the directory in a terminal?
2005-07-22T05:10:00.000Z	topyli	parka	seems like nautilus is trying to list the dir but fails
2005-07-22T05:10:00.000Z	topyli	parka	do you have something weird mounted in a subdir of your home?
2005-07-22T05:13:00.000Z	topyli	parka	what desperate measures! :)
2005-07-22T05:14:00.000Z	topyli	parka	try unmounting the usb drive and deleting the mount point
2005-07-22T05:18:00.000Z	topyli	parka	might be gam_server going nuts
2005-07-22T05:18:00.000Z	topyli	parka	nautilus always restarts
2005-07-22T05:19:00.000Z	topyli	parka	yes, it's a daemon that tries to list and remember all files
2005-07-22T05:19:00.000Z	topyli	parka	to speed up nautilus
2005-07-22T05:21:00.000Z	topyli	parka	hrm. well, perhaps it's the opposite and it _should_ be running (well normally it should :)
2005-07-22T05:23:00.000Z	topyli	parka	i believe it's "gamin" that is responsible of starting gam_server
2005-07-22T05:24:00.000Z	topyli	parka	but i don't really know how to start it manually, it's gnome-sessions job
2005-07-22T05:28:00.000Z	topyli	parka	nautilus /home/parka/directory ?
2005-07-22T05:32:00.000Z	topyli	parka	that does sound pretty bad on a sunday. it's a sin you know ;)
2005-07-22T05:34:00.000Z	parka	topyli	thanks a lot for your help
2005-07-22T05:35:00.000Z	topyli	parka	np, even though it was not very helpful :)
