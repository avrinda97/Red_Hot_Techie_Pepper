2010-05-12T06:19:00.000Z	teknoz		what is the command to identify my web server name?
2010-05-12T06:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	hostname
2010-05-12T06:21:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	Actually, i think it's something different. I'm trying to install Nagios and the step I'm at tells me to "Identify Web Server User" and tells me to type in "grep "^User" /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"....
2010-05-12T06:22:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	does that make a difference?
2010-05-12T06:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	oh, roger. you might need to be added to the 'http' group or something. that might not be the correct name of it either
2010-05-12T06:23:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	Heh. Ok. how do I do that?
2010-05-12T06:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	you better get someone whi knows that there doing when it come to installing a web server. but you can try looking at the following giu app. not sure if it'll have what you need in there, but it might. System --> Administration --> Users and Groups
2010-05-12T06:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	i doubt it. mysql is a database service while apache... is a web server
2010-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	probably be more like 'httpd' than mysql
2010-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	have a look at the /etc/group file to see what groups exist on your system
2010-05-12T06:28:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	Probably. I'm going to try running it through Synaptic. I think there's an autoinstaller during the process.
2010-05-12T06:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	ok, roger
2010-05-13T02:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	lol
2010-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	You remember me, right? Heh. With the huge Nagios installation issues yesterday. :)
2010-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	yes
2010-05-13T02:10:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	Would it be a good idea to install Nagios BEFORE I upgrade to 10.04 LTS? Or should I just wait out the 2 hours it's going to take for the upgrade process?
2010-05-13T02:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	i'd wait
2010-05-13T02:11:00.000Z	teknoz	onetinsoldier	Aww...ok. Sucks I have a day off tomorrow, otherwise I'd be back to play with Ubuntu some more. :)
2010-05-13T02:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	teknoz	sorry.... but i'd wait if i were you :-)
