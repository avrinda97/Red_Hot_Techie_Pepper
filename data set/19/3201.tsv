2009-10-04T18:49:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	gnome-look.org
2009-10-04T18:53:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	drag and drop
2009-10-04T18:54:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	or click the install button and browse
2009-10-04T18:56:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	download a gnome (metacity) theme - compiz will use whatever theme you have selected
2009-10-04T19:10:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	conky
2009-10-04T19:10:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	not a sidee bar as such, but very cool none the less
2009-10-04T19:11:00.000Z	system404	zen|tao	howd u mean not a sidebar
2009-10-04T19:11:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	try it and see - it's real small to download
2009-10-04T19:11:00.000Z	system404	zen|tao	ok
2009-10-04T19:16:00.000Z	system404	zen|tao	ive installed conky cant find it in my apps though
2009-10-04T19:16:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	braseo
2009-10-04T19:17:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	type conky in a terminal
2009-10-04T19:17:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	you might want to man conky first - lots of options
2009-10-04T19:21:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	braseo
2009-10-04T19:21:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	brasero*
2009-10-04T19:21:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	tried k3b?
2009-10-04T19:27:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	gnome has desklets - but don't know if they're any good, as I have never used them.
2009-10-04T19:31:00.000Z	zen|tao	system404	also drupal is a side bar, but again I can't vouch for it.
