2008-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	the installer can partition for you.  No need to do that in advance.
2008-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	language, please
2008-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	and profanity
2008-12-28T10:56:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	unless you absolulely need 64 bit for, say, > 3GB RAM, no need for it.
2008-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	I would not for the reasons I stated above
2008-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	see above
2008-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	yes
2008-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	the are compiled for different architectures
2008-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	in the past, there was no 64-bit flash, as another example
2008-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	no, I'm suggesting 32-bit
2008-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	how much RAM do you have?
2008-12-28T11:02:00.000Z	tritium	zaine	32-bit can use all 3 GB
