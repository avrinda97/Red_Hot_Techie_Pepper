2010-09-18T23:31:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Niwatori	use unetbotin
2010-09-18T23:31:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Niwatori	also you can do the regular installation process and at the time os partition select pen drive as installatino target
2010-09-18T23:32:00.000Z	Niwatori	AbhiJit	i cant install it because i cant make a cd, im running a emulated iso
2010-09-18T23:32:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Niwatori	then you need unetbootin
2010-09-18T23:32:00.000Z	Niwatori	AbhiJit	where would i find that?
2010-09-18T23:33:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Niwatori	sudo apt-get install unetbootin
2010-09-18T23:33:00.000Z	Niwatori	AbhiJit	im runnning windows, not linux
2010-09-18T23:33:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Niwatori	then get it from their web site
