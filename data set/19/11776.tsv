2006-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	HaxoR91		i already have gcc
2006-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	HaxoR91		the newest version
2006-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	HaxoR91		how do i open it?
2006-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	you don't open it, you use it
2006-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	gcc -o filename filename.c
2006-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	well, of course you have to give it a name of a file that exists
2006-04-30T06:11:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	we don't know what file you want to compile  :)
2006-04-30T06:11:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	a .cpp is a c++ file, so use g++, not gcc
2006-04-30T06:14:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	you have the compiler
2006-04-30T06:14:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	as someone earlier said, you may be confusing a compiler with an IDE
2006-04-30T06:14:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	there are IDEs in linux, if that's what you want
2006-04-30T06:14:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	look at anjuta
2006-04-30T06:15:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	in that case, you already have what you want
2006-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	you said you installed it.  Probably it is in /usr/bin
2006-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	you really aren't listening
2006-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	you can compile from vi.  vi is an editor.
2006-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	but what you want is called an IDE, which let's you compile and link and run programs without knowing what you are doing
2006-04-30T06:17:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	that book is for toy computers
2006-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	sethk	HaxoR91	but, as I've said at least four times, there are programs in linux that do exactly what you expect
