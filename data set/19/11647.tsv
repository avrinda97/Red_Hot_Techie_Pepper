2006-05-29T05:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 depends on what its a theme for. :P ya can often open the theme manager program.. and just drag/drop the new theme to it.
2006-05-29T05:26:00.000Z	lewix	Dr_Willis	it's in *tar
2006-05-29T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 i ment is it an ICON theme? a desktop theme? a gtk2 theme.. ect.. :P just try the drag/drop thing/
2006-05-29T05:28:00.000Z	lewix	Dr_Willis	wheres the theme manager program?. It's a theme/styles
2006-05-29T05:28:00.000Z	lewix	Dr_Willis	im using kde
2006-05-29T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 there in the setting smenus some where with every other configuration program.
2006-05-29T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 you would pick the ONE time i am booted to gnome. :) normally i use kde.
2006-05-29T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 just uncompress the file to some dir.. and use the kde theme manager's "install new theme button" and select the theme file

2006-09-15T07:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 best? the one that just powers off the screen.
2006-09-15T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 i would say yes.
2006-09-15T10:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 why SHOULD it be 'ok'  - is it ok for you to leave your front doors open? :P
2006-09-15T10:57:00.000Z	lewix	Dr_Willis	that's not my point. My point is  whether it's good or not for the hardrive
2006-09-15T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 you dident phrase it that way.
2006-09-15T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 accessing the drive from linux is not going to hurt the drive.
2006-09-15T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lewix	 writing to NTFS - may trash the filesystem.. but not harm the drive. :)
