2008-01-15T03:54:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	 yes close add and remove, open up synaptic and click on reload
2008-01-15T03:54:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	 system/administration
2008-01-15T03:56:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	click on reload, upper left
2008-01-15T03:57:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	yes, once it reloads you can search for the codecs.
2008-01-15T04:02:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	what codecs are you trying to install?
2008-01-15T04:03:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	close any package programs you presently have open
2008-01-15T04:04:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	 open up a terminal and type the following "sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restricted-extras"
2008-01-15T04:05:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	 restart your computer. For some reason or another, apt seems to be having an issue connecting to the servers
2008-01-15T04:18:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	maybe your sources.lst file got messed up
2008-01-15T04:20:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Infopirate	you can reinstall, it will fix it. however, you can just rewrite it or have someone send you a copy of theirs
