2012-03-24T18:19:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	is that nvidia?
2012-03-24T18:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	click "advanced" there
2012-03-24T18:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	you should now see a "Panning" option, if you have something like 640*480 in there correct it to the proper values
2012-03-24T18:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	x display conf
2012-03-24T18:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	working for you now?

2012-03-24T18:25:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	i do understand that, did you understand what i wrote how to fix it?
2012-03-24T18:26:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	oh i did not know that, sorry...
2012-03-24T18:28:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	huh?
2012-03-24T18:29:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	either you insert the values in nvidia xserver sttings or you use xrandr
2012-03-24T19:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	dorin	then you misspelled it
