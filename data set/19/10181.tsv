2006-07-28T16:00:00.000Z	alex_ndc		hi people, I have a problem ... I installed Apache2, php5 and mysql-server-4.1 ... I also installed php5-mysql and php5-mysqli ... these extensions haven't been activated ... how can I activate them ?
2006-07-28T16:01:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	do you have this installed: libapache2-mod-php5 ?
2006-07-28T16:02:00.000Z	alex_ndc	oskude	yes, libapache2-mod-php5 is installed
2006-07-28T16:03:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	and what isnt enabled ?
2006-07-28T16:03:00.000Z	alex_ndc	oskude	I think I have all extensions required installed ... but I think I am supposed to modify php.ini or something
2006-07-28T16:03:00.000Z	alex_ndc	oskude	the mysql extensions are not enabled in php, so I cannot access the mysql database
2006-07-28T16:04:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	hmm, do you really have mysql sever installed ? can you login with "mysql -u root" ?
2006-07-28T16:05:00.000Z	alex_ndc	oskude	yes, I have it installed
2006-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	and a php file with "<?php phpinfo() ?>" doesnt show mysql ?
2006-07-28T16:06:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	im just wondering, as i didnt have to edit anything after i install "lamp"
2006-07-28T16:07:00.000Z	alex_ndc	oskude	no,  phpinfo doesn't show mysql ... it doesn't show GD either (I also installed GD)
2006-07-28T16:07:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	hmm, sec...
2006-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	i got extension=mysql.so extension=mysqli.so extension=gd.so at the end of my /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini but i cant recall adding them there
2006-07-28T16:09:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	have you restarted apache2 since installing ?
2006-07-28T16:10:00.000Z	alex_ndc	oskude	yeah, I have ... it appears I don't have those lines in php.ini
2006-07-28T16:11:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	hmm... i remember i had to do something with gd to get it included, but definetly not by adding those lines... for mysql i didnt have to do anything...
2006-07-28T16:12:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	could be that when i installed apache2-mod-php5  with apt-get, it asked my if it should be activated
2006-07-28T16:13:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	dunno if synaptic asks that (or if it even asked with apt-get)
2006-07-28T16:13:00.000Z	oskude	alex_ndc	roger
