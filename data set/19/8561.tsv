2009-01-01T17:31:00.000Z	cyphase		Does anyone know if there's a way I can copy or move files to a hard drive at a set speed?
2009-01-01T17:31:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	sata or ide?
2009-01-01T17:32:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	ide
2009-01-01T17:32:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	why the set speed? whats the point.
2009-01-01T17:33:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	the destination drive has been having a problem where if i read from or write to it to fast, the whole computer starts to freeze up
2009-01-01T17:34:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	i'm pretty sure restarting would fix it, but i don't want to restart right now
2009-01-01T17:34:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	that sounds like dodgey ram
2009-01-01T17:35:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	can you run top?
2009-01-01T17:35:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	running
2009-01-01T17:35:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	whats the proc usage?
2009-01-01T17:36:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	around 30%
2009-01-01T17:36:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	i'm not copying right now though
2009-01-01T17:36:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	so when you copy/transfer stuff - it increases almost instantly to something ridiclous?
2009-01-01T17:37:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	it's so bad i can barely move the mouse
2009-01-01T17:37:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	it sounds like it's RAM related. the reason you can probably do the most basic of things is because there's a reserve/unflushed amount - which is keeping it going
2009-01-01T17:38:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	yea, i'm pretty sure it'll work fine
2009-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	you could do a memtest, i think you need to *reboot* it really.
2009-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	cyphase	eth01	i know
2009-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	eth01	cyphase	not really, there is a way
