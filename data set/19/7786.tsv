2007-06-25T12:34:00.000Z	J-_		how do I reconfigure X?
2007-06-25T12:35:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-06-25T12:36:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	you mean X won't start on boot or X won't start at all?
2007-06-25T12:39:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	boot, xdm comes up, I type in my password, and it just hangs, then goes back to gdm. I went to a tty, tried to log in and it was successful
2007-06-25T12:40:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	did you change the xdm script?
2007-06-25T12:41:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	what -did- you do?
2007-06-25T12:41:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	I don't think so, I was fooling around in .fluxbox, trying to get init working so nm-applet would run once the computer restarts
2007-06-25T12:42:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	that's beyond me, man.  you'll have to expand upon "fooling around".  :)
2007-06-25T12:42:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	lol, guess that's what I get for fooling around >.> =(
2007-06-25T12:43:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	if X starts, but not on boot, that's probably not the issue.
2007-06-25T12:43:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	k, if xdm starts, would that mean X has started?
2007-06-25T12:45:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	that's a good question.  i've seen X die both before and after gdm.  i've had weird looking gdm screens, and fine gnome screens.
2007-06-25T12:48:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	cool
2007-06-25T12:49:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	one way to test.  get to tty.  and then, X --config /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-06-25T12:50:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	you in irssi?
2007-06-25T12:51:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	yes
2007-06-25T12:54:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	oh.  not two -'s.  just one.  -config.  X -config /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-06-25T12:57:00.000Z	J-_	dawn`chorus	yeah still fatal error. Think I'm going to remove nm-applet or network-manager-gnome. and see what that does.
2007-06-25T12:58:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	J-_	watch that work like a charm!
