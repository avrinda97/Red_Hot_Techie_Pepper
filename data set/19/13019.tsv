2005-06-14T05:43:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- no disk, or no floppy drive?
2005-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- ever hear of PXE net boot?
2005-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- that will let you boot floppy image files from a server
2005-06-14T05:51:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- do you have a 2nd PC (even an old P1-75)
2005-06-14T05:52:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- is one of them a DHCP server?
2005-06-14T05:53:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- so yes?  cuz Mr admin (im gussing dad) might be up for some mods that will help you out
2005-06-14T05:54:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- so you aren't interested in any more help?
2005-06-14T05:55:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- would booting a knoppix cd on the "server" be considered messing with the server?
2005-06-14T05:56:00.000Z	CarlFK	caine	- what about turning off the server?
