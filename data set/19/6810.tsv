2010-06-03T04:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	Please run this script: http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/ and pastebin the output.
2010-06-03T04:11:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	The issue isn't with the grub config?
2010-06-03T04:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	I don't understand your question.
2010-06-03T04:12:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	Oh, I misunderstood that script - what is it exactly you hope this script will tell me
2010-06-03T04:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	It will tell me a lot of things. What drives /partitions you have, what bootloaders are installed to each of these, is grub installed such that it is looking in the correct partitions for its files, etc.
2010-06-03T04:16:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	Grub works ok, it just takes half an hour to do it
2010-06-03T04:16:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	So that information is surely useless?
2010-06-03T04:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	If it's grub 1.97 beta4 (from karmic), rather than 1.98 from lucid, and you have grub installed to the mbr of a drive different than the one that contains /boot, that would explain the delay.
2010-06-03T04:18:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	I have 1.98 (from 10.4 server) I think, and there is only one drive
2010-06-03T04:19:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	It was a fresh install, no special options (other than ubuntu desktop), only one hard drive installed. I had the issue on another machine as well....
2010-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	Is /boot on LVM also?
2010-06-03T04:21:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	Possibly, I don't recall, I just used Guided LVM (whole disk)
2010-06-03T04:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	If /boot is on LVM then you won't be able to use grub legacy at all. Are you sure that it's grub that is being slow? By default in Ubuntu the grub menu isn't even shown, so there is no way to tell when grub has finished and you're into the linux kernel / init.
2010-06-03T04:27:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	Last time I had this issue, I was informed there was an issue with some grub2 installs where grub stalled for an indeterminate amount of time
2010-06-03T04:27:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	As thats on a server that is on 24/7, it isn't so much of an issue.
2010-06-03T04:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	That issue was very specific, only occuring with karmic, and only when grub's mbr portion was on a different drive than /boot.
2010-06-03T04:29:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	Ok, I'm going to leave it for this evening and re-download ubuntu (desktop this time) and install without LVM tomorrow, and see what happens.
2010-06-03T04:30:00.000Z	MikeH_	Jordan_U	Thanks for your help anyway
2010-06-03T04:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MikeH_	You're welcome.
