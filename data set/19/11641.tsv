2005-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	ejofee		my home folder is a symlink to my older home folder (from another partition). bash seems to detect this and expands the symlink into the physical path, which i hate. why does it behave like this in ubuntu and how can i change this?
2005-12-20T11:10:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	why not just mount your old home folder as /home?
2005-12-20T11:10:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	how can i mount... a dir?!
2005-12-20T11:10:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	it is not a whole partition, it is just a dir!
2005-12-20T11:10:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	ah sorry thought you had a similar setup to mine
2005-12-20T11:11:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	yes, i myself am considering using a whole partition as a home partition
2005-12-24T07:40:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	use the menu editor to see what command the shortcut runs
2005-12-24T07:41:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	i don't have that menu... my menu is different
2005-12-24T07:41:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	smeg
2005-12-24T07:43:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	i simply don't know where the menu editor is! kmenuedit is not what you mean, i assume; right?
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	I told you the command: 'smeg'
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	my menu editor is not in my menu... so i have to access it from the console...
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	ohh, i never heard of any such command :)
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	i thought it was english, never thought it was (ba)sh
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	:)
2005-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	no worries
2006-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	try installing the package mplayer-fonts
2006-01-19T10:22:00.000Z	ejofee	_jason	thank you
2006-01-26T08:37:00.000Z	_jason	ejofee	I think they are getting one in dapper.  You could set up a nautilus script to do it though
