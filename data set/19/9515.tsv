2007-01-25T16:35:00.000Z	Aurvandill		I am trying to install the nvidia beta drivers (for Beryl) but ran into a problem. Is anyone here able to help?
2007-01-25T16:35:00.000Z	Aurvandill		Okay, here is the deal...
2007-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	Aurvandill		I am following this HOWTO and I am at the "Installing nVIDIA Beta Driver" section
2007-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	Aurvandill		http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Edgy_with_nVidia
2007-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	Aurvandill		But I am stuck adding Repository
2007-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	foutrelis	Aurvandill	What section are you at?
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	Aurvandill	foutrelis	Installing the nVIDIA Beta Driver
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	Aurvandill		It says to add a rep. in the following command:
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	Aurvandill		sudo echo -e "\n## nVidia driver repository\nrepository" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	Aurvandill		so it should look like this, right?
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	Aurvandill		sudo echo -e "\n## nVidia driver repository\ndeb http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/ubuntu edgy stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	Aurvandill		or did I get it wrong?
2007-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	foutrelis	Aurvandill	Just do it manually. gksu gedit /etc/apt/source.list :)
2007-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	foutrelis	Aurvandill	And then copy paste the repo in the text file and click save :)
2007-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	Aurvandill	foutrelis	ok, I just didn't understand what the line the HOWTO suggested did
2007-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	Aurvandill	foutrelis	is it just doing it in a fancy way?
2007-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	foutrelis	Aurvandill	yes
2007-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	Aurvandill	foutrelis	I see you use gksu. is that for extra "vulnerable" files or something? Are there more "su"s?
2007-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	foutrelis	Aurvandill	It is like su but for GUI apps
