2007-04-27T07:50:00.000Z	intelikey		i just came in here to complain that there was a problem in the LTS release that might be "critical"   run-parts  doesn't work.
2007-04-27T07:51:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	your best bet is to figure out what's wrong and then file a bug report on launchpad
2007-04-27T07:53:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	my best bet is to rm the file and write a script to replace it....      i would fix it but,  i don't  C  :)
2007-04-27T07:54:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	try removing the .sh from the filename
2007-04-27T07:55:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	still nada
2007-04-27T07:55:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	tail /var/log/syslog show anything
2007-04-27T07:56:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	nothing apropos
2007-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	i'll just make a script with a for loop to run what ever is in the dir it's pointed at and be done with it.
2007-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	i assume that run-parts being hosed is why the package manager was also acting stupid....
2007-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	well, you should still report it -- not that it'll do any good, but that's the right thing to do :)
2007-04-27T07:58:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	yeah someone should....     i'm just too irresponsable  and unregistered ....  i don't even have an email addy.
2007-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	hmm, it's working for me so far
2007-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	ok.   what version ?
2007-04-27T08:00:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	  mine shows   Debian run-parts program, version 2.15.2
2007-04-27T08:01:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	that's on  dapper LTS
2007-04-27T08:01:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	hmm -- i don't see anything in the changelog that talks about a bug
2007-04-27T08:05:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	anyway, you could build the edgy package on LTS and see if that fixes the problem
2007-04-27T08:07:00.000Z	intelikey	brainsik	it's provided by "debianutils"   i might try that.  in the mean time.  i'll make a script and get done with what i'm fiddling with...      thanks for the tod.
2007-04-27T08:07:00.000Z	brainsik	intelikey	my tod is your tod
