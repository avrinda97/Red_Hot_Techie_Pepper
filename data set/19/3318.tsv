2009-11-06T03:52:00.000Z	Bryce1		it doesnt let me access the windows network. nothing happens it just wont connect
2009-11-06T03:53:00.000Z	ashy	Bryce1	using DHCP?
2009-11-06T03:54:00.000Z	Bryce1	ashy	im not sure. But when you suggested to use the live cd it worked wonderfully
2009-11-06T03:55:00.000Z	ashy	Bryce1	have you set up a static ip and stuff on your install?
2009-11-06T03:56:00.000Z	Bryce1	ashy	i dont believe so i have trouble shot samba and smbfs alot so that might of changed it but i havent gone into network connections and changed that
2009-11-06T03:58:00.000Z	ashy	Bryce1	 try doing cat /etc/resolv.conf on both your install and the livecd, make sure they're the same
2009-11-06T03:58:00.000Z	Bryce1		ok
2009-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	ashy	Bryce1	I had similar problems and it turned out to be dns issue
2009-11-06T04:11:00.000Z	Bryce1	ashy	yes the cat /etc/resolv.conf is the same on the live disk as it is on my install
2009-11-06T04:11:00.000Z	ashy	Bryce1	hmmm, then sorry I'm out of ideas
2009-11-06T04:12:00.000Z	Bryce1		ok thanks for the help
2009-11-06T04:12:00.000Z	Bryce1		i think im going to re install karmic
2009-11-06T04:12:00.000Z	ashy	Bryce1	I guess that would be the easy way :D
2009-11-06T04:54:00.000Z	Bryce1	ashy	Hi i got it working by reinstalling 9.10 thanks for your help
