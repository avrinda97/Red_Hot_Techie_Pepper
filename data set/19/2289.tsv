2010-05-08T15:40:00.000Z	adiba		i can't remove or add pkg and i can't update the ditro
2010-05-08T15:41:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	How did you do the update? LiveCD or through update-manager?
2010-05-08T15:43:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	There have been quiote a few issues i know of where upgrading via update-manager has caused errors. I would have said the easiest option is to roll back and use a LiveCD if possible
2010-05-08T15:44:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	What are you trying to upgrade to? and what from? 9.10 -> 10.04 ??
2010-05-08T15:45:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	Then roll back and burn the 10.04 liveCD and upgrade using that.
2010-05-08T15:46:00.000Z	adiba	bushbaby	 how to roll back plz  ??
2010-05-08T15:49:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	It seems there's no direct rollback functionality. (Correct me anyone if i'm wrong here!) The only thing i can suggest is back up all your files and do a clean install from a 10.04 liveCD.
2010-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	adiba	bushbaby	thanks too much for your help , after a backup i will do that
2010-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	No problem. Good luck
2010-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	adiba	bushbaby	is rollback functionality available for older distros
2010-05-08T15:53:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	Older distro's? How so?
2010-05-08T15:54:00.000Z	adiba	bushbaby	is the roll back function avilable for 9.04 or 9.10 juste to know if i could wait for till it will be available
2010-05-08T15:55:00.000Z	bushbaby	adiba	I've no idea. I didn't realise there was a specific rollback function at all.
