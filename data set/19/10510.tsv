2007-07-12T12:38:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	could u help me install my intel drivers
2007-09-22T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	although I guess such habits have been fostered from windows, click and pray is not advised
2007-09-22T11:25:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	iv trying to fix this since 7pm..its not 1:25am
2007-09-22T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	I am advising you on methodology
2007-09-22T11:26:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	i want advice on how to fix it :)
2007-09-22T11:26:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	if you understand what is going on, you will actually be able to do it for one and two be able to undo it, now we have two different drivers installed, one precompiled, the other not, there could be version mismatches, there could be overwritten files
2007-09-22T11:26:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	I mean the system as you described it is a troubleshooting mess, it is hard to even know what it looks like
2007-09-22T11:27:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	i guess u are aright..so u think i should reinstall ubuntu?
2007-09-22T11:28:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	I mean there is always a way to undo something (well pretty much), but since you aren't even sure what you did the first time, it will be hard to undo it. I mean you know you clicked something but you don't know what that was supposed to do...
2007-09-22T11:29:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	its one thing if you clicked something from ubuntu, those are standardized and should be trackable, but when you go into third party stuff you are pretty much out on your own
2007-09-22T11:30:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	well i installed the drivers using envy and then i installed cedega but 3d acceleration and opengl were failing along wid rendering.. so i used to package manager to reinstall the drivers. but its the same thing.
2007-09-22T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	you don't understand, these drivers are not the same, they come from different places. This is one of the problems with abstraction, you think that envy and the package manager did the same thing when they didn't do anything close to the same thing
2007-09-22T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	you could have file conflicts, version conflicts, etc.
2007-09-22T11:32:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	so i will have to uninstall the separately and then reinstall one. but i was getting the prob since before i installed the other set of drivers
2007-09-22T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	well like ubotu said, envy is garbage
2007-09-22T11:34:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	so its best advised to use package manager
2007-09-22T11:34:00.000Z	bruenig	randy	yes
2007-09-22T11:38:00.000Z	randy	bruenig	does opengl need a special set of drivers apart from the normal nvidia bundle that package  manager gives?
