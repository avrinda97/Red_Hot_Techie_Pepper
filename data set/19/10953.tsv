2009-02-05T21:34:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	I should probably edit sudo
2009-02-05T21:34:00.000Z	usr13_		Right?
2009-02-05T21:34:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	no, don't edit sudo. just don't add a user you don't want using sudo to the admin group
2009-02-05T21:35:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Ok
2009-02-05T21:35:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	What is adm ?
2009-02-05T21:35:00.000Z	usr13_		gourp adm
2009-02-05T21:36:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	sor of a sub admin acount; mostly used to limit access to system  logs that I've seen
2009-02-05T21:36:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	for example, if your user is not in the adm group, they can't see /var/log/syslog
2009-02-05T21:37:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Actually, the user does not even know how to use command line, so sudo is not really the issue. I jsut don't want her to be able to mess up the system via GUI abilities.
2009-02-05T21:37:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Is that possible?
2009-02-05T21:37:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	no sudo, no writing outside of their own personal home.
2009-02-05T21:37:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	not giving sudo is exactly what you want to do. No sudo = no synaptic, no access to anything in the admin menu, etc
2009-02-05T21:38:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Ok, very good.  I'll exclude from admin
2009-02-05T21:40:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Ok, done.  But... just realizing, that if one had done that and there was only one user on a new ubuntu system, it would be hard to do any sort of administrative tasks, and how would you fix such a situation?
2009-02-05T21:40:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	boot into recovery mode, and run in the console  adduser <user> admin . recovery console is a root account
2009-02-05T21:41:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	In other words, at least one user needs to be in admin group if there is no root account.
2009-02-05T21:41:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Oh, ok. very good. thanks.
2009-02-05T21:41:00.000Z	nickrud	usr13	off to work, have fun :)
2009-02-05T21:41:00.000Z	usr13_	nickrud	Now that I have exlcuded that user from admin, will she be able to install new applications?
