2009-06-24T05:03:00.000Z	lufis		Is there a way to open up ports without the use of a firewall?
2009-06-24T05:04:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	most application installs will open the ports that you need
2009-06-24T05:04:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	Hmm. Vnc fails to connect every time
2009-06-24T05:05:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	local network?
2009-06-24T05:05:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	Intarwebs address
2009-06-24T05:05:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	most likely a firewall in between
2009-06-24T05:06:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	are you at the machine you're connecting from?
2009-06-24T05:06:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	i always have these issues with vnc. sigh. I'm trying to connect to my nongeek's friend's pc. She's got everything set up in "Remote Desktop" preferences but i can't ever connect
2009-06-24T05:06:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	yes, and only myself
2009-06-24T05:06:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	you're on ubuntu?
2009-06-24T05:06:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	Yes, and so is she
2009-06-24T05:07:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	Me? It would be preferable :p
2009-06-24T05:08:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	if you're both on ubuntu did you try the built in remote desktop viewer?
2009-06-24T05:08:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	I'm not sure what ports it uses but it's worked for me from work to home with no firewall config changes
2009-06-24T05:08:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	Yep. well, kind of. I told her to configure everything in Remote Desktop prefs, and she did. I've been using vncviewer but it always fails to connect
2009-06-24T05:09:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	applications, internet, remote desktop viewer
2009-06-24T05:09:00.000Z	lufis	dtownhero	I tried that too, but always fails. Do I connect to her ip address or her broadcast address?
2009-06-24T05:10:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	IP
2009-06-24T05:10:00.000Z	dtownhero	lufis	is she behind a router by chance?
