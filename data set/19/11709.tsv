2005-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	drumline		that'll get your root privs
2005-12-09T16:01:00.000Z	drumline		Just wanted to say that I love Ubuntu and I love this #channel.  :)  Thanks folks.
2005-12-09T16:01:00.000Z	dosle	drumline	 is there another way for the GUI aspect of drag/dropping files to apache?
2005-12-09T16:07:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	still there?
2005-12-09T16:08:00.000Z	dosle	drumline	 yeah im here
2005-12-09T16:08:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	go to the K, Internet, Web Browser (konquerer)... right click and run as a different user... try root and your root pass....   that works for me, but again, I set my root password in single user mode, so if that doesn't work, I'd recommend setting your root password.
2005-12-09T16:10:00.000Z	dosle	drumline	i see what that would solve but my issue is a bit different i think.  I just want to be able to drag and drop the .html into the directory
2005-12-09T16:11:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	konquerer is how you can drag and drop it...    either that or select them all and copy, then paste it...
2005-12-09T16:12:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	did that work?
2005-12-09T16:13:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	oh yeah...  this in the Gnome side of things...   umm...  Nautalis is the gnome FM right?
2005-12-09T16:13:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	try it with the Gnome File Man
2005-12-09T16:14:00.000Z	dosle	drumline	is that in a menu as well?  not seeing it
2005-12-09T16:15:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	probably in one of the pulldowns from the top...    I don't have much experience with Gnome, I'm more attracted to KDE.
2005-12-09T16:16:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	if you want...  I think you should at least try it and make your decision afterwards.
2005-12-09T16:18:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	here's what I'd do.   Open a root shell and do it on the command line  :)
2005-12-09T16:18:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	poningru's suggestion should work
2005-12-09T16:19:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	 Don't change the group though.. .just the user.
2005-12-09T16:21:00.000Z	drumline	dosle	the chown method locks the directory only to you.
