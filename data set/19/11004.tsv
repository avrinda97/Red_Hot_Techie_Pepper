2006-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	msoul		hello, I'm having a problem with Xorg
2006-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	msoul		just installed ubuntu on my toshiba laptop
2006-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	just state your problem
2006-04-24T10:24:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	your best bet to get X working after a clean install is to run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' & answer the questions, or just accept the defaults
2006-04-24T10:24:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	I believe I accepted the defaults when I installed ubuntu, no?
2006-04-24T10:25:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	I'll try that, bbs
2006-04-24T10:33:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	I honestly didn't get it, it's really a hard peice of hardware
2006-04-24T10:42:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	no luck with dpkg-reconfigure ...etc
2006-04-24T10:42:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	yeah no luck
2006-04-24T10:43:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	what should I do? :-)
2006-04-24T10:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	define no luck - here this might help
2006-04-24T10:44:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	well, it just no matter what I do I can't see anything when I reboot, all I see is a blank screen so I have to ctrl-alt-F1
2006-04-24T10:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	see ubotu's fixres url above - you might need to spec vertrefresh & horizsync for your monitor/resolution
2006-04-24T10:46:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	I could try that, the thing is that's the only laptop that I have at home
2006-04-24T10:46:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	could you tell me how can I set monitor resulotion?
2006-04-24T10:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	it's in that link ubotu posted
2006-04-24T10:48:00.000Z	msoul	Frogzoo	you know that I'm on console mode only
2006-04-24T10:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	to the "Monitor" section add these on two new lines "    HorizSync 30-67"   "    VertRefresh   30-60"     just be sure your monitor can handle those (on a lappie, shouldn't be a problem)  'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart' & ctrl alt f7   & cross fingers
2006-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	msoul	glad you got a result - finally!
