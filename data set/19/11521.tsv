2006-03-12T08:37:00.000Z	randabis		latest kernel updates to dapper made my ndiswrapper stop working :(...it still works on the old kernel but not the new one
2006-03-12T08:37:00.000Z	randabis		i'm using dapper now...the amd64 version
2006-03-12T08:37:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	stable?
2006-03-12T08:38:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	so far it seems to be, other than my latest ndiswrapper dilemma with the newest kernel update
2006-03-12T08:39:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	what happened? ndiswrapper no like 2.6.15, right?
2006-03-12T08:39:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	actually, it works with 2.6.15-15, but not 2.6.15-17
2006-03-12T08:39:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	random
2006-03-12T08:40:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	I have a bcm4318 wireless chipset
2006-03-12T08:41:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	working with dapper kernel?
2006-03-12T08:41:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	tried the native driverS?
2006-03-12T08:44:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	the native driver is no longer in the kernel modules with the latest dapper amd64 kernel so I have not tried that...it never worked when I tried it before when it was still in the kernel anyway
2006-03-12T08:45:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	why isn't it any more?
2006-03-12T08:45:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	I have no idea...I searched for the module and it isn't there
2006-03-12T08:51:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	kernel update fixed it :)
2006-03-12T08:51:00.000Z	mikearthur	randabis	you now have native bcm43xx again?
2006-03-12T08:51:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	no, I have ndiswrapper bcm43xx
2006-03-12T08:52:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	the bcm43xx module is back though  where it should be in /lib/modules
2006-03-12T08:54:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	I can try to get the native driver working again if you would like...the problem with it last time was that it would cause a kernel panic if I inserted the required firmware into /lib/firmware and then modprobed bcm43xx (I made sure ndiswrapper wasn't loaded before doing so)
2006-03-12T08:55:00.000Z	randabis	mikearthur	the kernel panic would then repeat itself every time I tried to boot the machine..the only way to fix it was to use the ubuntu cd and go into recovery mode and remove the firmware from /lib/firmware
