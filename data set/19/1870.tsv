2010-09-25T11:15:00.000Z	rusivi		st_ hehe
2010-09-25T11:16:00.000Z	rusivi		st_ hey I'm all about support
2010-09-25T11:16:00.000Z	rusivi		st_ support me damnit!
2010-09-25T11:18:00.000Z	rusivi		yeah you have to command line it in the same directory at Terminal: sh linux....
2010-09-25T11:20:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	yes it is lol, Linux hates mounting vbox cdroms
2010-09-25T11:22:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	- lol
2010-09-25T11:23:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	maybe you know this, does kvm have guest additions or that or no?
2010-09-25T11:26:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	idk I'm very VBox-centric at this point, tried virt-manager and it was GUI crippled for Ubuntu Lucid RC have not used since https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/amarok/+bug/494851
2010-09-25T11:26:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	kvm kills my 64-bit for virtualbox, which sucks, but I kind of like it for servers
2010-09-25T11:27:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	I'll have to check that out, i'm in beta atm for Maverick may give it a go
2010-09-25T11:27:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	what I like though is the option to go full command line
2010-09-25T11:28:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	one thing I hated about Windows, could not command line half the stuff I thought would be way easier had to play hungry, hungry clicker
2010-09-25T11:28:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	I've been learning some of the vbox command line args, which is neat, but I don't think it'd work in a vm server (e.g. Ubuntu server running vms for other computers)
2010-09-25T11:28:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	you would have to use Oracle's biz class VBox for that kind of stuff
2010-09-25T11:29:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	or vmware
2010-09-25T11:29:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	yeah Windows cli sucks, but I know a few commands to do a few things, not very much it's all vbscript and that; well I meant for personal use here at home
2010-09-25T11:30:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	nice, yeah I'm not patient enough to do it the "windows" way, I'd rather just do a google search and blamo got what I want
2010-09-25T11:32:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	rusivi	I keep a terminal open just cause I like to do things in terminal, move files, mount images, even surf the net sometimes (using Lynx)
2010-09-25T11:34:00.000Z	rusivi	slooksterpsv	yeah I just re-discovered my terminal is a pretty good internet browser :p
