2010-07-14T20:55:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	yes, but I want it to show on the remote box, not mine,
2010-07-14T20:56:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	I can get it to run on my box
2010-07-14T20:57:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	Ah, I see.  I think you can specify the display variable (ex. 0:0) or whatever to have it launch and run remotely.
2010-07-14T20:57:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	Let me see if in can figure it out...
2010-07-14T20:57:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	yes, I was thinking there was a way to do that, export!  thanks
2010-07-14T20:59:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	I'm sure of it.  I just have to remember how...
2010-07-14T21:00:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	I think I got it here:  http://www.cisl.ucar.edu/docs/ssh/guide/node29.html
2010-07-14T21:33:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	welcome!  take care.
2010-07-14T21:03:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	Looks like it.  Good luck!
2010-07-14T21:03:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	initial test failed, I must need to export the display in the same command as I want exported.
2010-07-14T21:26:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	fyi here is the trick:  http://ranjith.zfs.in/send-messages-over-network-gnome-popup-box-message/
2010-07-14T21:28:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	I lost my shell session (poor connectivity to the wireless network) so I just got back here now.  In playing, I found that if you set the DISPLAY variable to, ":0.0" it will work.
2010-07-14T21:30:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	without messing with the xauthority it will work?
2010-07-14T21:31:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	Yes.  That's the beauty of doing X over ssh!
2010-07-14T21:31:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	that will be easier to remember too, thanks a bundle!
2010-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	rob_p	shane2peru	You still have to ssh to the remote host with the, "-X" option.  But once you do that, simply do, "export DISPLAY=":0.0" and your set!
2010-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	yes, I love ssh, I can organize pics, sync my wife's pc with mine, and put a message on the kids laptop. lol :)
2010-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	rob_p	great, thanks!!!
