2011-07-28T23:09:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	network-manager
2011-07-28T23:09:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	why?
2011-07-28T23:10:00.000Z	wolfric	edbian	i want to disable the default "connect automatically" when you first connect to a network
2011-07-28T23:11:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	For the first thing you'd have to change the source code or manually tick that box.
2011-07-28T23:11:00.000Z	wolfric	edbian	manually change tick that box?
2011-07-28T23:12:00.000Z	wolfric	edbian	you mean go in manually and untick it for each connection i make? yes i do that automatically
2011-07-28T23:12:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	Yeah
2011-07-28T23:12:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	You'd have to edit the source code to change that behavior I think.
2011-07-28T23:13:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	There is not 'tick this box automatically' tick box anywhere that I'm aware of :(
2011-07-28T23:16:00.000Z	wolfric	edbian	happen to know where it saves your remembered networks?
2011-07-28T23:16:00.000Z	edbian	wolfric	No :(  Probably in gconf
