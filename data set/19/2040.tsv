2010-10-29T14:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	daniel_	right click on network icon and select: enable wireless
2010-10-29T14:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	daniel_	and if you have a wireless switch on your laptop, switch it on
2010-10-29T14:52:00.000Z	daniel_	ilovefairuz	^
2010-10-29T14:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	daniel_	what ubuntu version are you using?
2010-10-29T14:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	daniel_	are you using a laptop or a desktop? there has to be a wirless kill switch, anyhow try: rfkill unblock wlan
2010-10-29T14:54:00.000Z	daniel_	ilovefairuz	i have searched all over the laptop for a switch and there is none
2010-10-29T14:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	daniel_	it could be a key combination, like FN + F1 or 2, etc
2010-10-29T14:55:00.000Z	daniel_	ilovefairuz	thanks that was the problem
2010-10-29T14:56:00.000Z	daniel_	ilovefairuz	its working now
2010-10-29T14:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	daniel_	you're welcome
