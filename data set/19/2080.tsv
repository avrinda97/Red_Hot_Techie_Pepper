2010-09-17T02:59:00.000Z	n0a1ias		similiar to that
2010-09-17T02:59:00.000Z	n0a1ias		mount them, snake_ click places, then right click the partition and select mount
2010-09-17T03:01:00.000Z	n0a1ias		oh, simply drag and drop snake_
2010-09-17T03:01:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	you have a composite signal out of the camera, and you want to run it to what exactly?
2010-09-17T03:02:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	and why not just use a composite video cable to a video ingest card on the computer ?
2010-09-17T03:04:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	why not just run the composite video to a tv/monitor then?
2010-09-17T03:06:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	getting composite video into a computer requires hardware
2010-09-17T03:06:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	you can't just magick it in there :)
2010-09-17T03:06:00.000Z	n0a1ias	iter	nope, i skipped that class
2010-09-17T03:10:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	sorry dude but video ingest requires some A->D conversion
2010-09-17T03:10:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	what are you going to plug the other end of the rj45 into?
2010-09-17T03:15:00.000Z	iter	n0a1ias	that guy uses a video ingest card for the video
