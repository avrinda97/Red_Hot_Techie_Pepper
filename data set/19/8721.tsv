2008-10-29T04:48:00.000Z	justin_		can some one help me with creating startup programs through sessions? im kind of lost at what to do at this point
2008-10-29T04:49:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	what do you want to start?
2008-10-29T04:50:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	Konversation (irc), and also firestarter (firewall)
2008-10-29T04:50:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	are you using ubuntu or kubuntu
2008-10-29T04:50:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	ubuntu
2008-10-29T04:51:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	ok, you need to go to System -> Preferences -> Sessions
2008-10-29T04:52:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	K, got tha
2008-10-29T04:53:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	you can click add, in the startup programs tab
2008-10-29T04:53:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	k
2008-10-29T04:54:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	Give it a name (Konversation or IRC or something like that), and then put in the command to launch konversation
2008-10-29T04:54:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	if you don't know where the binary is, you can open a terminal and type "which konversation" and that will give you the path
2008-10-29T04:55:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	 Ok, what would be the command? Im still a little linux illiterate
2008-10-29T04:55:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	what do you get when you open a terminal and type "which konversation"
2008-10-29T04:56:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	 I get /usr/bin/konversation
2008-10-29T04:57:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	ok, put that in the command box.  That should at least open it up for you when you log in.  I haven't used konversation, but I'm sure there are options to autlogin, join channels, etc... that you can append to that if you want.  I would read the man page for those options
2008-10-29T04:58:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	but that should at least get konversation running
2008-10-29T04:58:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	yes there are options for that. Thank you
2008-10-29T04:58:00.000Z	cyberjackal	justin_	no problem, just repeat for anything else you want to start
2008-10-29T04:59:00.000Z	justin_	cyberjackal	 Yep doing so now :) Learn something new every day from this channel
