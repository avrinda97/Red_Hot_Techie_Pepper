2009-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	Ghoti	orthodoc	if you're here, you're on the internet, friend :)
2009-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	interesting isn't it? But firefox does not connect to the net
2009-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	I am using one of those plug in usb modems
2009-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	Ghoti	orthodoc	so XChat is working, but Firefox is not?  What errors does firefox give?
2009-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	it says page load error
2009-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	Ghoti	orthodoc	and after that?
2009-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	says firefox is in offline mode
2009-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	Ghoti	orthodoc	file -> (uncheck) offline mode, then try again
2009-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	thanks that did the trick
2009-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	but thats not the problem actually
2009-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	when i try and connect to the net via a lan it works fine
2009-08-06T08:40:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	how do i change that?
2009-08-06T08:40:00.000Z	Ghoti	orthodoc	I'm not sure how to prevent firefox automatically going 'offline'; I've never had that problem, I'm afraid :(
2009-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	 next time arounf just disconnect your lan and try firing up firefox and it goes into an offline mode auto
2009-08-06T08:42:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	anyways thanks a lot ...
2009-08-06T08:42:00.000Z	orthodoc	Ghoti	the solution was simple and it escaped my mind
