2012-01-28T01:21:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		so if I call this script, and volume stays the same, I check the file, and find out if its a matter of script, or keygrabber
2012-01-28T01:22:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		so, I add following line to ~/.fluxbox/keys (default keys file):
2012-01-28T01:22:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		None XF86AudioRaiseVolume :Exec ~./soundControlScript.py -up
2012-01-28T01:22:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		I also tried without Exec
2012-01-28T01:23:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		and with ' ' around script call
2012-01-28T01:23:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		also tries changing ~ to /home/phill
2012-01-28T01:24:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		(and that dot after ~ is a typo, already changed it and tried all above, still doesnt work)
2012-01-28T01:24:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		at this point, I have no clue what next
2012-01-28T01:25:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		I checked button name with xev, name is right
2012-01-28T01:25:00.000Z	phil_kiddo		I read documentation for fluxbox - nothin mentioned (as far as I understood)
2012-01-28T01:26:00.000Z	Pici	phil_kiddo	you need to stop pressing enter so often. Use a comma instead.  Also, can you try running your script as an argument to python?
2012-01-28T01:28:00.000Z	phil_kiddo	Pici	understood, comma will occur ;) If you mean calling "python .soundControlScript -up" - it wont make any difference, I added #/usr/bin/python at the first line, so shell will interpret script woth python interpreter. Anyway, as I tried - it works just the same
2012-01-28T01:29:00.000Z	Pici	phil_kiddo	I mean like: "python /home/phill/soundControlScript.py -up"
2012-01-28T01:30:00.000Z	phil_kiddo	Pici	works exactly the same - changes volume, as expected. You think of setting buttonpress to call python, not bash?
2012-01-28T01:33:00.000Z	phil_kiddo	Pici	tried: None XF86AudioRaiseVolume :Exec 'python /home/phill/soundControlScript.py -up' - still nothing (bot with and without ' ' )
2012-01-28T01:34:00.000Z	Pici	phil_kiddo	Can you specify "python /home/phill/soundControlScript.py -up" inside your fluxbox keys file? Also, you may want to use :ExecCommand instead of :Exec
2012-01-28T01:37:00.000Z	phil_kiddo	Pici	damn! I just spotted my problem: script name started with dot, but as a typo, I placed dot BEFORE slash (and left undotted name) - when I changed it, I forgot to add . to name, so script Ive been calling didnt exist...
2012-01-28T01:37:00.000Z	phil_kiddo	Pici	now its okay, thanks for your help :)
2012-01-28T01:41:00.000Z	phil_kiddo	Pici	and, for the record: in this form it works as well: None XF86AudioRaiseVolume :Exec ~/.soundControlScript.py -up (without calling python interpreter, without ' ' and with ~ instead of full name)
