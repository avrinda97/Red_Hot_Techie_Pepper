2005-06-12T08:21:00.000Z	DAC1138		happens every day in the blender chat
2005-06-12T08:22:00.000Z	DAC1138		whats stupid is then they pop back in 20 minutes later "uh, how do i do this?" and they leave, and come back
2005-06-12T08:22:00.000Z	DAC1138		its like "just login and STAY to ask your questions, help others as well while you're here"
2005-06-12T08:22:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	it's part of how they learn. How I learn too.
2005-06-12T08:25:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	edit partitions or access and edit files?
2005-06-12T08:34:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	well without having to partition there is slackware with umsdos, or colinux or cygwin.  Ubuntu doesn't fit the bill -- oh though the livecd would be good
2005-06-12T08:34:00.000Z	DAC1138	dougsk	yeah, ive used slackware way bak at 8.0 with umsdos
2005-06-12T08:34:00.000Z	DAC1138	dougsk	but that was very hard to set up
2005-06-12T08:35:00.000Z	DAC1138	dougsk	wheras the live cd will work, and you can mount the windows partition and edit it
2005-06-12T08:35:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	point well taken.  O never said it was 'easy'.  But it doesn't touch the partition table.
2005-06-12T08:36:00.000Z	DAC1138	dougsk	umsdos i think is also what peanut linux was using as a main partition type
2005-06-12T08:37:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	yes peanut is/was based off of slackware circur 9.x
2005-06-12T08:37:00.000Z	DAC1138	dougsk	peanut was one of my first distros. it was very hard to setup, mainly because of umsdos and i had to download an extra file from the internet that was 80MB (this was on dialup)
2005-06-12T08:37:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	if you chose to partition with peanut it used reiser3
2005-06-12T08:38:00.000Z	DAC1138	dougsk	i got a weird copy of peanut. the instructions told me to get an 85 bzImage file, copy that to a DOS formatted partition, and install it like that. it would use the DOS partition as its main filesystem
2005-06-12T08:38:00.000Z	dougsk	DAC1138	I was a huge peanut fan jp does great work and bolting rpm ontop was pretty cool.
