2007-11-27T05:16:00.000Z	airtonix		using msn is plain laughable
2007-11-27T05:17:00.000Z	airtonix		yeah jabber is a eXentisble Messaging & Presence Protocol
2007-11-27T05:17:00.000Z	airtonix		it has load balancing, ie can cluster with other jabber servers
2007-11-27T05:17:00.000Z	airtonix		ie ones you make or ones others  have made
2007-11-27T05:19:00.000Z	airtonix		youaredoome: no
2007-11-27T05:19:00.000Z	airtonix		youaredoome: its CLI only
2007-11-27T05:20:00.000Z	airtonix		LOL running a UI for a server.....and then running GNOME at that
2007-11-27T05:20:00.000Z	airtonix		you want a gui for a server, you should be running xfce at the most
2007-11-27T05:20:00.000Z	airtonix		blackbox at the least
2007-11-27T05:20:00.000Z	kitche	airtonix	you do know that a lot of servers run gui's
2007-11-27T05:21:00.000Z	airtonix	kitche	only for monkeys so they can click point
2007-11-27T05:29:00.000Z	airtonix	kitche	Hilikus: you are describing the jabber protocol
2007-11-27T05:32:00.000Z	airtonix	kitche	jabber is still called jabber...i don't know what your referring to
2007-11-27T05:35:00.000Z	kitche	airtonix	hmm my jabber can't talk to my msn at all maybe you can show me how it's done but anyways I m gonan call it XMPP since the foundation isn't even called Jabber Software Foundation anymore
2007-11-27T05:36:00.000Z	airtonix	kitche	your 'jabber' refine please,... you mean gaim or ejabberd?
2007-11-27T05:36:00.000Z	kitche	airtonix	hmm I mean jabber if it's a protocol it shouldn't matter what client I use
