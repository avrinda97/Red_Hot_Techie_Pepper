2009-09-13T09:33:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	boot of the live cd and reinstall it
2009-09-13T09:36:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	ubottu is just a bot, but yes you do
2009-09-13T09:36:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	oh ok, thanks
2009-09-13T09:37:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	just go to that first link (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub) and then scroll down to "restore grub"
2009-09-13T09:40:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	do i mount the linux into /media/root and the boot partition(windows) to /media/root/boot?
2009-09-13T09:41:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	do you have two hard drives? or just one drive with two partitions?
2009-09-13T09:41:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	 multiple hard drives
2009-09-13T09:42:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	ok, then which one do you want to boot to? ubuntu or windows?
2009-09-13T09:43:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	 well i installed a new drive where i installed windows and moved the linux drive, so the windows drive is the boot drive
2009-09-13T09:43:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	ok, sounds like you will be booting to the drive that has windows, and you just need to re-install grub to that drive? right?
2009-09-13T09:44:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	i think so
2009-09-13T09:46:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	 im already on that page but do i need to mount the windows drive to /media/root/boot?
2009-09-13T09:46:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	its not really clear from the tutorial
2009-09-13T09:48:00.000Z	kromar	pyro2927	it says "You also need to mount your /boot partition if you made one, like this :" but did i made a /boot partition? o_O
2009-09-13T09:48:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	private chat, easier
2009-09-13T09:49:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	where does it say that? I don't see it anywhere
2009-09-13T09:49:00.000Z	pyro2927	kromar	just saw it
