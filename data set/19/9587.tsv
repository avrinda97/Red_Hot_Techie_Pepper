2006-10-29T12:00:00.000Z	fnf		Hi, I have asked this question before, but here again: Anyone successfully installed nvidia-glx in Dapper ?. This package depends on one of the older kernel (2.6.15.11), which would screw up my system (2.6.15.27) after installing.
2006-10-29T12:02:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	I had no problems with it; did you have security updates enabled?
2006-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	You mean even you're running the latest kernel, installing nvidia=glx wouldn't cause it to be reverted back to the older one ?
2006-10-29T12:04:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	I was running 2.6.15-27-k7
2006-10-29T12:06:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	What did apt-cache tell you about the dependency ?. Mine stays in 'pool/restricted/l/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15/', hence it would complain if I didn't have the appropriate kernel installed. Any direction would be great.
2006-10-29T12:07:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	Sorry, I switched to Edgy last night :-?
2006-10-29T12:10:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	Which is from the 2.6.15.11-1 source package. (but that's fine).
2006-10-29T12:10:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	That's right, and attempting to install it on my 2.6.15.27 kernel would be dangerous.
2006-10-29T12:10:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	No, that's the RIGHT one
2006-10-29T12:10:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	it goes wityh the 2.6.15-27 kernel from dapper-security/main
2006-10-29T12:11:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	After that, I would have to choose between running an acient kernel with nvidia-glx or not at all.
2006-10-29T12:11:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	You've installed nvidia-glx ? If so, I think I'll have a shot at Edgy.
2006-10-29T12:12:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	On dapper. nvidia-glx 1.0.8762+2.6.15.11-5 (dapper-security/restricted) with linux-image-2.6.15-27-k7 2.6.15-27.48 (dapper-security/main)
2006-10-29T12:14:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	"sudo apt-get -s install nvidia-glx" din't tell you that you need to install another kernel ? It's really wierd.
2006-10-29T12:14:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	Nope. You should check that your sources.list is up to date,a s well as run 'sudo apt-get update'.
2006-10-29T12:15:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	I cron "apt-get update/upgrade" on a daily basis. It should have the latest patches.
2006-10-29T12:16:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	Thanks, guess I'll have to search and comeback in a while.
2006-10-29T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego	fnf	The mirror you use is perhaps out of sync; also if you sue any non-official repos, disable them for a moment.
2006-10-29T12:17:00.000Z	fnf	cafuego	Ahh no, I mean I did an update check very frequently, sorry for the miswording. :-p
