2009-07-29T01:17:00.000Z	TigerCR1200		I am trying to make an audio cd from MP3s using Brasero. When I try to select a MP3 it tells me ""mp3 file name" is not suitable for audio or video media." Any ideas why?
2009-07-29T01:19:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- what filename are you putting ?
2009-07-29T01:20:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	"01-tito_el_bambino-el_amor.mp3"
2009-07-29T01:21:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- without the quotes obviously, try taking out the underscores and dashes (_-) i know this seems pretty weird but try it and tell me how it goes...
2009-07-29T01:22:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- rename it with something that you would recognise it by
2009-07-29T01:23:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	same result with file name "01.mp3"
2009-07-29T01:24:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- try calling it something with just letters for example "filename.mp3"
2009-07-29T01:25:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	simpletext.mp3 fails same way
2009-07-29T01:26:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- hmm.. not sure what to suggest give me a minute
2009-07-29T01:27:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	fyi I can play the mp3 its not a codec issue that I have been able to find out.
2009-07-29T01:28:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- remind me, are you trying to burn the files to a cd ?
2009-07-29T01:30:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- okay, in a terminal type sudo apt-get install k3b
2009-07-29T01:31:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- k3b is another burning tool, its simple to use and can be found under apps
2009-07-29T01:31:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- once installed of course ;) =P
2009-07-29T01:32:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	I know what it is
2009-07-29T01:32:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- ahh good sorry i couldnt help, what was your problem so if it happens to me i know how to avoid ;P
2009-07-29T01:33:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	it was a codec issue after all. I was able to play the file but not burn it. I just had to install ubuntu-restricted-extras it is now going to attempt to burn with orginial file names.
2009-07-29T01:34:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	TigerCR1200	- ahh okay, usually it is a codec issue at least its sorted now
2009-07-29T01:35:00.000Z	TigerCR1200	Joe-needs-help	I know first thing I tried was to try and play the file but it gave me noise
