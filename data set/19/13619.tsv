2005-05-20T13:52:00.000Z	danko123456		yup, remove your firefox, add these two to your sources: "deb http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/backports hoary-backports main universe multiverse restricted" "deb http://manno.name/debian/ breezy cvs" , and update your apt-get, and then you will have the 1.03, but, I have no clue how good or bad that will be for your system.
2005-05-20T13:52:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	in general, backports are bad for your system ;)
2005-05-20T13:54:00.000Z	danko123456	tritium	if he installs the .3 firefox, and removes the sources, does nothing else, like upgrade or something stupid like that, he should be almost fine, execpt perhaps for teh firefox...
2005-05-20T13:55:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	yes, he should be okay
2005-05-20T13:56:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	huh?
2005-05-20T13:56:00.000Z	danko123456	tritium	that is what synaptic tells me...
2005-05-20T13:57:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	trying to do what?
2005-05-27T15:12:00.000Z	danko123456	tritium	it is related to his reboot, does not boot...

2005-05-27T15:40:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	please, that's rather offtopic
2005-05-27T15:41:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	this isn't the appropriate forum
2005-05-31T11:29:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	just ask
2005-05-31T11:29:00.000Z	danko123456	tritium	I know, I am being sarcastic....it was a skit:)
2005-06-03T09:40:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	I hope you used make-jpkg to build a .deb for him :)
2005-06-03T09:40:00.000Z	danko123456	tritium	:) i didnt, I didnt even use java-package:(
2005-06-03T09:41:00.000Z	tritium	danko123456	:(  (btw, make-jpkg is provided in java-package)
