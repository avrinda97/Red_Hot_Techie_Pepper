2011-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	you will need to use the Alternate Installer
2011-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	where do i get that from? i searched and couldn't find it.
2011-02-17T12:01:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	one second
2011-02-17T12:01:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	ok
2011-02-17T12:01:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	are you looking for the LTS(10.04) or the newest(10.10)?
2011-02-17T12:02:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	newest with complete hard drive encryption option.
2011-02-17T12:03:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	ubuntu 10.10 is about half way down the page. I will send you the link for instructions in just a minute. http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/releases.ubuntu.com//
2011-02-17T12:05:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	ubuntu-10.10-alternate-i386.iso  is the one i want?
2011-02-17T12:05:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	yes, for a 32bit system
2011-02-17T12:06:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	ok downloading now.
2011-02-17T12:06:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	i'm surprised HD encryption is not available as an option in the standard installer.
2011-02-17T12:08:00.000Z	uRock		The GUI takes up too much of the space needed for the install files. dissipate
2011-02-17T12:08:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	ah i see.
2011-02-17T12:09:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	I can't find the ubuntu doc on doing the encrypted install, but I have used it in the past and it is offered when you get to the partitioning setup
2011-02-17T12:10:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	thanks for trying to find it. i'm looking at this right now: http://joernfranz.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/installing-ubuntu-10-10-with-full-disk-encryption/
2011-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	this page covers all of the cool stuff you can do with partitioning to include encryption https://help.ubuntu.com/10.10/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html#di-partition
2011-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	dissipate	uRock	cool, thanks!
2011-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	uRock	dissipate	you are welcome
