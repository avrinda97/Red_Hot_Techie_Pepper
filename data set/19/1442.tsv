2012-06-24T06:15:00.000Z	ethical		i've got a problem
2012-06-24T06:16:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	what's the problem?
2012-06-24T06:19:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	i will have to do some digging into teamview to see what's going on, brb.
2012-06-24T06:25:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	I think it's because Ubuntu has detected and assigned the webcam already. I read an article about a bug teamviewer has where if the webcam is already assigned (an irq?) then it won't work, because teamviewer wants that webcam open and available for it to assign the webcam. Sorry, I might not have made much sense there.
2012-06-24T06:28:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	you could try this: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/07/get-your-webcam-to-work-with-google.html it's not directly used for team viewer, but it was mentioned in another board about teamviewer...
2012-06-24T06:29:00.000Z	ethical	hylian	: thanks .. lemme check out  :) brb
2012-06-24T06:29:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	it can't. vlc is simply for audio/video playback.
2012-06-24T06:31:00.000Z	ethical	hylian	very informative article .. but sir.. as i said . cam is already working with gtalk
2012-06-24T06:32:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	sorry, I was grapsing for straws there
2012-06-24T06:33:00.000Z	ethical	hylian	:)
2012-06-24T06:34:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	this is totally a strange workarond, but someone said something about running the webcam through a virtual connection, like tty to your own machine. I have never done such a thing, so I am afraid this is way over my head, but I thought I would mention it.
2012-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	ethical	hylian	: virtual connection ?  using virtual cam?
2012-06-24T07:06:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	come back with a good word, i hope. :)
2012-06-24T07:08:00.000Z	hylian	ethical	um.. ok.
