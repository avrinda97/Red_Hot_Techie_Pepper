2006-12-12T14:21:00.000Z	paloyme		ok, how do you point to a file thats a few folders deep? is there a shortcut to it?
2006-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	paloyme		ln?
2006-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	jrrs	paloyme	sudoedit is sudo(8) invoking $EDITOR on a copy of the file in question, such that changes to the file aren't moved back until you exit the editor
2006-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	paloyme		thanks tony
2006-12-12T14:23:00.000Z	paloyme		is this applicable when doing, like for example, sudoedit /etc/salfkjdslfk/fasdfsdf/asdfasdf/asdfsadf/abc.conf?
2006-12-12T14:23:00.000Z	paloyme		is there a shortcut to that?
2006-12-12T14:24:00.000Z	paloyme		yeah i know i need to type it to a terminal, but is there some shortcut, so that i wont need to type in those damn folders?
2006-12-12T14:24:00.000Z	paloyme	owh	just once
2006-12-12T14:24:00.000Z	paloyme		but since i dont know some of the folder name formats, i get errors and it sucks to repeat the whole folder name
2006-12-12T14:25:00.000Z	paloyme		i see... thanks ill try that
2006-12-12T14:26:00.000Z	paloyme		what does .folder/ mean?
2006-12-12T14:27:00.000Z	jrrs	paloyme	the 'dot' in front means it won't show up in ls(1) unless you include -a
2006-12-12T14:27:00.000Z	paloyme		how do i access it in terminal? or how do i use it in sudoedit? ... sudoeit .folder/xxxfile.conf?
2006-12-12T14:27:00.000Z	jrrs	paloyme	sure.  or ' cd .folder; sudoedit xxxfile.conf' or sudo vi or blahblah
