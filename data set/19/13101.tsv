2006-09-12T16:54:00.000Z	bintut		 anyone here can help me on how to install ubuntu desktop?
2006-09-12T16:54:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	what stage are you at right now?
2006-09-12T16:55:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	what stage do you mean? it's the first page or display i see
2006-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	what OS is installed on your computer at the moment? have you downloaded or otherwise got hold of a CD/DVD with ubuntu on?
2006-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	i tried to boot from a non-graphical boot and it cannot find a kernel image "install"
2006-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	i already have an ubuntu desktop from http://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/pub/linux/ubuntu/releases/dapper/ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-amd64.iso and i already booted it first
2006-09-12T16:57:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	and that was a liveCD with an "install" icon on the Desktop?
2006-09-12T16:57:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	i don't know.
2006-09-12T16:58:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	so where in the install process are you?
2006-09-12T16:59:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	the very first.. choosing the boot methods..
2006-09-12T16:59:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	what options do you get, and what happens when you just leave it to the default?
2006-09-12T16:59:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	i pressed F3 and the only available boot methods it says are live and memtest
2006-09-12T05:00:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	so if you choose live?
2006-09-12T05:00:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	i want to install ubuntu desktop and not the live cd
2006-09-12T05:00:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	the dapper release combines those things...
2006-09-12T05:01:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	if you choose liveCD you will have the option to install from there (also giving you a quick check of your hardware compatibility)
2006-09-12T05:01:00.000Z	bintut	djm62	ok
2006-09-12T05:01:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	you don't HAVE to! you can get a different iso if you don't want to for whatever reason
2006-09-12T05:01:00.000Z	djm62	bintut	(in case you were feeling forced)
