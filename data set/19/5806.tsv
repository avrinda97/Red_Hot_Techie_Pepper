2009-07-07T13:27:00.000Z	wapko		what dock do people use ? cant seem to find one i like..
2009-07-07T13:27:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	avant-window-navigator
2009-07-07T13:29:00.000Z	wapko	iMatter	awn, yeah. is there a way to create a launcher that creates new processes everytime you click it.. intead of minimizing and restoring. like a terminal.. if one terminal is doing stuff and i want a new one ?
2009-07-07T13:30:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	hmm all you have to do for a new terminal open the one thats already up click file new tab or file new terminal
2009-07-07T13:30:00.000Z	wapko	iMatter	i know. guess im just to picky..
2009-07-07T13:30:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	other than that theres no way to do that
2009-07-07T13:31:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	unless you simply go to Applications or whatever and open it
2009-07-07T13:32:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	if it worked like that you could never open your original window :P
2009-07-07T13:33:00.000Z	wapko	iMatter	yeah. cos my original window would have gotten its own icon. like a dock with seperate launchers and proces icons
2009-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	wapko	iMatter	whick probably defeats the purpose of a dock. but thats just me ;)
2009-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	LOL yush
2009-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	why not trying putting doubles of the icons you want two of?
2009-07-07T13:35:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	it may look ugly but it does what you want >.>
2009-07-07T13:35:00.000Z	wapko	iMatter	but say i need 10 terminals at the same time.. not so nice looking dock
2009-07-07T13:36:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	just use terminal tabs :P
2009-07-07T13:36:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	theres a keybinding to open a new tab
2009-07-07T13:36:00.000Z	wapko	iMatter	but i want to see simultaneous output :P
2009-07-07T13:37:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	once you have them all tabbed you can then separate them!
2009-07-07T13:37:00.000Z	iMatter	wapko	i know thats tedious but it works
