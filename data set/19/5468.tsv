2011-02-12T15:18:00.000Z	hosein		hi people! after some updates and changes, when I restarted my ubuntu, the OS loader page options have duplicated! how to remove these duplicates?
2011-02-12T15:18:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	you've probably installed a new kernel
2011-02-12T15:19:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	try ubuntu tweak and clean it up
2011-02-12T15:19:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	http://ubuntu-tweak.com/
2011-02-12T15:25:00.000Z	hosein	halvor	Thanks,I downloaded it. but I have another problem too! when I run update manager after getting my pass, this error occurred:The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources.
2011-02-12T15:25:00.000Z	hosein		even when i run The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources...
2011-02-12T15:25:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	some keys are missing
2011-02-12T15:25:00.000Z	hosein		I saw that:The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources.
2011-02-12T15:25:00.000Z	hosein		sorry:dpkg: requested operation requires superuser privilege
2011-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	if you use ubuntu tweak too update your system you shouldn't really pay attention to that error
2011-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	try sudo
2011-02-12T15:32:00.000Z	hosein	halvor	Now I am running tweak. how to clean up them?
2011-02-12T15:32:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	package cleaner or something
2011-02-12T15:33:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	and there you'll find a button "remove kernel"
2011-02-12T15:33:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	but don't go berzerk :) remove the oldest one first
2011-02-12T15:33:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	then reboot... and you should see one option less on the grub screen
2011-02-12T15:37:00.000Z	hosein	halvor	there is 3 kernel packages: I think linux-image-2..-generic is installed by update manager recently.
2011-02-12T15:38:00.000Z	hosein		now can I clean the first: linux-headers-2...-22 ?
2011-02-12T15:48:00.000Z	halvor	hosein	remove the older ones
