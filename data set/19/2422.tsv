2010-04-10T02:26:00.000Z	micko		hi guys, I have bought a Dell 1564 with i3 and I installed Ubuntu 9.04 and I have shitty graphics :( how to solve that please?
2010-04-10T02:26:00.000Z	micko		I tried Lucid beta and the graphics problem is solved, but it's highly unstable :(
2010-04-10T02:28:00.000Z	micko		anyone please?
2010-04-10T02:28:00.000Z	minimec	micko	<alt>f2 gnome-terminal, then lspci | VGA
2010-04-10T02:28:00.000Z	minimec	micko	tell me the results
2010-04-10T02:29:00.000Z	micko	minimec	dude the graphic card is Intel which is integrated in the CPU
2010-04-10T02:29:00.000Z	minimec	micko	Ok. Are you running 9.10?
2010-04-10T02:29:00.000Z	micko	minimec	this is a common problem among people :)
2010-04-10T02:29:00.000Z	micko	minimec	9.04
2010-04-10T02:31:00.000Z	minimec	micko	What should I say... Upgrade to 9.10 or wait for the 10.04 These distributions support kms (kernel mode settings) for your card.
2010-04-10T02:31:00.000Z	micko	minimec	I tried 9.10 but it doesn't work either!
2010-04-10T02:32:00.000Z	micko	minimec	tried Lucid and it solves the problem, but it's NOT stable at all :(
2010-04-10T02:32:00.000Z	minimec	micko	wait for lucid. It's probably the best.
2010-04-10T02:33:00.000Z	micko	minimec	I need to use my computer!!! :(
2010-04-10T02:33:00.000Z	micko	minimec	I'm a student
2010-04-10T02:35:00.000Z	minimec	micko	Sorry... I don't know what you mean by shitty graphics. if you have to, modify your /etc/xorg.conf of your 9.04 install and use the basic vesa driver.
2010-04-10T02:35:00.000Z	micko	minimec	some people said that they modified xorg.conf and change vesa to Intel
2010-04-10T02:36:00.000Z	micko	minimec	but I couldn't find the "vesa" part in that file
2010-04-10T02:38:00.000Z	minimec	micko	yeah... In 9.04 /etc/xorg.conf is still present but 'empty'... There should be some examples in the forums, dealing that problem.
