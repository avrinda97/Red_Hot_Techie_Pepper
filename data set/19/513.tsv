2012-02-21T21:20:00.000Z	rcmaehl		I have a problem
2012-02-21T21:20:00.000Z	rcmaehl		I have a really old graphics card
2012-02-21T21:21:00.000Z	rcmaehl		It's an nvidia geforce AGP card
2012-02-21T21:21:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	from terminal "lspci | grep -i vga"
2012-02-21T21:22:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	nvidia-current is only for the newest nvidia cards
2012-02-21T21:22:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	Its module isn't loaded
2012-02-21T21:23:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	so which package?
2012-02-21T21:23:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	if it doesn't find any supported hardware (ie an old card) that might make sense
2012-02-21T21:23:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	from terminal "lspci | grep -i vga"
2012-02-21T21:23:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	it doesn't detect it because it's on intergrated graphics right now as it's set to intergrated on the motherboard in the BIOS
2012-02-21T21:24:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	i see.  that does make sense, but ok.  I can't help then.  good luck.
2012-02-21T21:25:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	I can open the case and see if the card has the model easily readable real quick. it is an old card so it might now
2012-02-21T21:26:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	if lscpi doesn't find it, you have a bigger issue.
2012-02-21T21:26:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	it finds it when it boots from the graphics card just not when I do nvidia-xconfig
2012-02-21T21:28:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	nvidia geforce 2 mx
2012-02-21T21:30:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	from my quick search it appears you need to be using the 96 nvidia driver instead of current
2012-02-21T21:30:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	ok thanks
2012-02-21T21:31:00.000Z	zykotic10	rcmaehl	i've personally had a lot of issues getting the 96 driver to work, i hope you have better luck then me.
2012-02-21T21:36:00.000Z	rcmaehl	zykotic10	I'm attempting a reboot. If the 96 drivers don't work I'm coming after you. LOL jk jk wish me luck
