2006-01-17T10:46:00.000Z	blink56k		so whent he grub prompt shows up i tipe root sda1? and then makeactive and then boot?
2006-01-17T10:47:00.000Z	blink56k		hdX, X (whats the second x for)
2006-01-17T10:48:00.000Z	blink56k		root hda1, 1 then makeactive then , boot...are those the three commands?
2006-01-17T10:49:00.000Z	blink56k		e, root [hda0, 1] , makeactive, press b?
2006-01-17T10:50:00.000Z	blink56k		ahh I'm such a dumbarse...id leave linux on my machine happily but my school just doesnt support it on its network :(
2006-01-17T10:51:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	how is it not possible to 'support linux on the network'?
2006-01-17T10:51:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	ah. you should probably try looking for a cisco vpn compatible client then for linux
2006-01-17T10:52:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	they're probably running cisco clients on some prupose that has nothing to do with windows vs linux
2006-01-17T11:10:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	just type grub commands that you would have in the grub config for that partition
2006-01-17T11:11:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	the commands that are in menu.lst are exactly the ones that you can type in
2006-01-17T11:11:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	on any linux installation that boots with grub in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-01-17T11:13:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	not really, root doesn't 'boot' :-)
2006-01-17T11:13:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	root sets the default partition for grub from which it will look for files
2006-01-17T11:13:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	like kernel and such, but yes, start with root (hd0,1), then continue with kernel and initrd (if you have one)
2006-01-17T11:14:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	then as a last command, execute boot (if grub let's you proceed to that stage, it will display errors if any of your commands are really wrong/bad ones)
2006-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	blink56k	czr	kernel, initrd?
2006-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	yes. those normally come after a 'title' line
2006-01-17T11:33:00.000Z	blink56k	czr	good news...i successfully booted manually from the grub. prompt...if i wanted to boot from a windows partition would root (hd0,1) save deafult makeactive boot suffice?
2006-01-17T11:34:00.000Z	czr	blink56k	not sure. better check the nice grub documentation on the web for that
