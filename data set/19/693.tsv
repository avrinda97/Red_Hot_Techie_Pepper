2011-10-13T12:55:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	TehDGM	It does a little bit in Wine, not very well mine due. I forgot to mention that was on Windows, i know that Linux probably doesnt count with that side of the Hibernate feature, but in a general term i was lucky to have that much swap allocated
2011-10-13T12:58:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	TehDGM	I second that motion and raise you a +1, i run a server with Ubuntu Server 11.04 running with on GUI, doesnt mean its not an operating system, means its an operating system for people wont want o get things done FAST
2011-10-13T13:09:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	TehDGM	New Unity Launcher, Faster, new Software Centre, can support Gnome3
2011-10-13T13:11:00.000Z	TehDGM	Reave-Magentium	is that actually a good thing? Sounds a bit clunky to me
2011-10-13T13:12:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	TehDGM	it is a good thing because it means that you can code up very very basic interfaces in HTML and CSS. It allows the user a little more freedom, and also uses just over half the resources that GDM uses
2011-10-13T13:14:00.000Z	TehDGM	Reave-Magentium	i guess thats interresting for the many web devs out there. As for the resources, i'd have to see :)
2011-10-13T13:15:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	TehDGM	yes of course, seeing as i only saw it in the beta of 11.10 cannot make an decisions on it a of yet, will be interested to see what sort of resources work.
2011-10-13T14:14:00.000Z	TehDGM	Reave-Magentium	only with 3rd party plugins i've ever had that. If you do it with the regular ones i'd say its a driver issue or unsupported hardware
2011-10-13T14:16:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	TehDGM	im using the Propietory Drivers (From Additional Drivers section) on an ATI 4530 Mobility Radeon, mind due only happens on 11.10 Beta
