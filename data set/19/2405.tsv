2010-05-06T21:36:00.000Z	Flare-Laptop	delac	lol just unplug it, then the icon will go poof :P
2010-05-06T21:38:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	I still actually need the device. It's Huawei 3G stick, and the drive I want to remove is the emulated CD that has the windows drivers.
2010-05-06T21:38:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	and all this should happend automatically
2010-05-06T21:39:00.000Z	Flare-Laptop	delac	stuff like that doesn't work on linux :/
2010-05-06T21:40:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	what doesnt? There is the "Safely Remove" command in the right click menu that does shut down the device for good.
2010-05-06T21:40:00.000Z	Flare-Laptop	delac	emulated CD drives
2010-05-06T21:40:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	but I want the command line equivalent
2010-05-06T21:41:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	Well I dont exactly know what it is, but it is mounted as CD, but it definitely ain't one.
2010-05-06T21:41:00.000Z	Flare-Laptop	delac	then it won't work then :/
2010-05-06T21:41:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	what doesn't work?
2010-05-06T21:42:00.000Z	Flare-Laptop	delac	emulated CD drives
2010-05-06T21:42:00.000Z	delac	Flare-Laptop	right. well, i still have something mounted that i want to power down.
