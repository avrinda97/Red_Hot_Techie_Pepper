2008-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	StPatrick	vocx	 Do you know how to fix my wifi?
2008-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	vocx	StPatrick	you can follow the advise you want, but if the one helping you isn't even sure, you can mess things up badly.
2008-04-06T06:58:00.000Z	StPatrick	vocx	 Well, what do you reccomend then man? I need wifi working, and I'm completely new to linux. :(
2008-04-06T06:59:00.000Z	StPatrick	vocx	 It was on Ubuntu forums.
2008-04-06T07:00:00.000Z	vocx	StPatrick	Okay, just remember that you can't rush things up. It doesn't matter if you are desperate, and being new to linux doesn't help.

2008-04-06T07:03:00.000Z	StPatrick	vocx	 Im not complaining. I'm stating a fact. Im not rushing anything, i am a little rushed, cause people helping me keep having to leave 1/2 way through the process..
