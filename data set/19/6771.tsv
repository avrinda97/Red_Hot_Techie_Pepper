2009-11-16T08:48:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	i think only a mod can
2009-11-23T13:50:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	did you check the md5 of your iso?
2009-11-23T13:50:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	nope!
2009-11-23T13:50:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	how do i do that. I downloaded it directed from the torrents.
2009-11-23T13:51:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	it should be good from a torrent
2009-11-23T13:51:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	try adding    -t iso9660   to the mount command
2009-11-23T13:52:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	wrong fstype is the error now
2009-11-23T13:52:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	check the md5 i guess
2009-11-23T13:52:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	md5sum file.iso   i think
2009-11-23T13:53:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	compare it to these http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.10/MD5SUMS
2009-11-23T13:54:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	I got an md5sum starting with 183 and ending with 33c1. and it isnt listed on that page you directed me to.
2009-11-23T13:55:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	bad download then, in your torrent client recheck, it should download the bad parts
2009-11-23T13:55:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	oh
2009-11-23T13:56:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	I used Transmission. Using the verify local data option to check the data now.
2009-11-23T14:04:00.000Z	SingAlong	Billiard	I verified the torrent data and checked the md5sum again. Its still the same. (I had downloaded the torrent from the releases.ubuntu.com site)
2009-11-23T14:06:00.000Z	Billiard	SingAlong	if the md5 doesnt match its bad, i think the torrent isos should be the same as the others
