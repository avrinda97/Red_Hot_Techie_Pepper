2008-04-07T17:57:00.000Z	differentreality		is there some way for me to make an image of the partition with my filesystem so that I am able after a possible format to install that image and have everything configured as they are right now ?
2008-04-07T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	like a clone?
2008-04-07T17:58:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 well... i gues.. whatever works so that i dont need to download all my programs or configure them
2008-04-07T17:59:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 hmmm this adds the packages on an existing ubuntu installation ?
2008-04-07T18:00:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	that seems to be the gist of the description
2008-04-07T18:03:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 this only creates a file with names of packages... i guess that packages need to be download... it just downloads them all automatically ... but this is not what i want.   I want to either have an image with the whole ubuntu installation which will include all my programs+configuration OR an image or sth that will automatically install+configure all my progs (WITHOUT internet)
2008-04-07T18:05:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	what about aptoncd
2008-04-07T18:06:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 i think that aptoncd would just install progs.. but then i would have to configure them all over right ?
2008-04-07T18:06:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 for example i use konversation and i have changed (among other things) the bg color. will that be configured like i have it now ?
2008-04-07T18:08:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	okay; what about zipping your /home then moving it to the new machine with aptoncd for the rest
2008-04-07T18:09:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 actually... what about /etc/resolv.conf for example ?
2008-04-07T18:10:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	what have you tried so far? I have given you some suggestions
2008-04-07T18:11:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 yeah but none will actually clone everything i got so far :/
2008-04-07T18:12:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	have you tried anything so far?
2008-04-07T18:13:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 no, because it seems that my prob won't be solved
2008-04-07T18:13:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	it seems that you want some guarantee of success beforehand; linux is about trying stuff and learning from what does and does not work
2008-04-07T18:14:00.000Z	bazhang	differentreality	I know what will work with my system; but your system is another matter as you have done very different things most likely--thus my suggestions
2008-04-07T18:14:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 well.. that's not it... it's just obvious that installing the packages withouth using the internet wont give me the configuration i need ... so i see no reason to do it at the moment
2008-04-07T18:15:00.000Z	differentreality	bazhang	 i think i most likely need sth like zipping my whole partition with the filesystem rather than just the /home :p
