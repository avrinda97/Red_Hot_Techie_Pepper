2011-10-17T00:56:00.000Z	FoolsRun		Hi, since installing 11.10 my top bar is generic grey and most of my icons are generic white "application" icons. I've cleared all my settings and even created a new user with no effect. Anyone know how to fix this?
2011-10-17T00:58:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	change your themes and see what happens. Try out radiance vs. ambiance and icon themes designed for light/dark
2011-10-17T00:58:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Shirakawasuna	I tried that, nothing happens.
2011-10-17T01:00:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Shirakawasuna	It appears that the window title bars actually do change when I switch themes, but the GTK theme doesn't. It's stuck generic grey.
2011-10-17T01:02:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	see if 'gtk-chtheme' will allow you to fix the gtk theme
2011-10-17T01:03:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	alternatively see what's in ~/.config/gtk-3.0
2011-10-17T01:04:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Shirakawasuna	That does seem to work, but the Unity top bar remains generic grey
2011-10-17T01:04:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	weird
2011-10-17T01:04:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Shirakawasuna	is there a way to just reset my and all users' desktop settings to default?
2011-10-17T01:04:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	there isn't an easy way outside of backing up and removing .config and .local (and maybe some other dot-dirs)
2011-10-17T01:05:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	e.g. mv .local localbak && mv .config configbak
2011-10-17T01:05:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	You could also try making a new user and seeing if the problem persists
2011-10-17T01:05:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	that would tell you whether it's a config issue
2011-10-17T01:05:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Shirakawasuna	The problem does psersist with a new user
2011-10-17T01:06:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	try adding things to that new user's dirs so pinpoint where the problem lies
2011-10-17T01:06:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	e.g. cp -r .config/* /home/testuser/.config/
2011-10-17T01:07:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	eventually you can start using bifurcation to narrow down which config is being a jerk
2011-10-17T01:08:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	e.g. let's say it is something in .config that's messing things up (using your .config with the testuser account). Then try using just every dir in .config that starts with a-m
2011-10-17T01:11:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	FoolsRun	it may be worthwhile to redo unity's configs, wherever they are (delete them). Probably .config/unity (I don't know because I don't use it)
