2012-11-16T02:59:00.000Z	MFen		how do i configure my servers so postfix stops asking me that useless goddamn question during upgrades
2012-11-16T02:59:00.000Z	MFen		sorry for the rage, but this just killed an entire client's server of mine
2012-11-16T02:59:00.000Z	MFen		postfix popped up its question during a headless upgrade, AFTER postgresql was shut down. doom.
2012-11-16T03:00:00.000Z	MFen		when i provision a new server, the first thing i want to do is tell dpkg STOP ASKING ME ABOUT POSTFIX
2012-11-16T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	thanks fofr that random pointless outburst, please don't do it again
2012-11-16T03:01:00.000Z	MFen	ikonia	so you don't know?
2012-11-16T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	don't know what ?
2012-11-16T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	you've not asked a question
2012-11-16T03:02:00.000Z	MFen	ikonia	it was above. (not very far above.)
2012-11-16T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	it's asking you to configure postfix during the upgrade as it needs a response
2012-11-16T03:03:00.000Z	MFen	ikonia	it doesn't. postfix has a config file already. i set it up by hand during install. by even asking me that question, postfix is asking me whether i want to ruin my handmade config file
2012-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	so answer "no"
2012-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	MFen	ikonia	"no" isn't even an answer to the prompt, but the prompt itself is the problem
2012-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	it wants you to answer
2012-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	your only real option is to use response files
2012-11-16T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	I've not done it for a long time, but that's what you need
2012-11-16T03:06:00.000Z	MFen	ikonia	thanks! i google now.
2012-11-16T03:09:00.000Z	MFen	ikonia	looks like it's actually debconf-set-selections that i want! http://serverfault.com/questions/228266/how-do-i-generate-a-response-file-to-be-used-with-apt-get-or-aptitude
2012-11-16T03:10:00.000Z	ikonia	MFen	bravo
