2008-02-12T00:23:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		Ok, for the last time today: Who can I contact to get my WLAN working?
2008-02-12T00:25:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		Can I make the "system bars" in Ubuntu floating?
2008-02-12T00:26:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	System bars?
2008-02-12T00:26:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	Pici	You know, menus and stuff.
2008-02-12T00:26:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	Okay, then what do you mean by floating?
2008-02-12T00:27:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	You can click on an empty space and drag them around...
2008-02-12T00:28:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	Pici	No, that just puts them on another edge
2008-02-12T00:29:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	You cant drop them in the middle of the screen if thats what you're asking
2008-02-12T00:31:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	Sure.

2009-02-06T18:02:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-4.2 has some links
2009-02-06T18:05:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	There is no easy way to do what you are asking because these files are in a PPA and not the official Ubuntu repositories.
2009-02-06T18:10:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	This is the best I can do: https://edge.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-experimental/+archive/ppa
2009-02-06T18:10:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	Pici	No kind of web client anywhere that I can browse that with? Or local windows client that runs from USB drives?
2009-02-06T18:11:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	No.
2009-02-06T18:11:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	Pici	:(
2009-02-06T18:11:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	Sorry. :/
2009-02-06T18:23:00.000Z	Pici	Jonathan_L	These packages were just not designed to be downloaded from anything other than apt.
2009-02-06T18:23:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	Pici	I think that I should create something like a APT browser fro Windows...
