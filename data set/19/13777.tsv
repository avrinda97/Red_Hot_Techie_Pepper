2005-04-17T14:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	Doesn't work? Does it sit on IRC all day? Does it want more money?

2006-01-14T06:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	That's not too unbelieveable, it's just a matter of having the right libraries installed.
2006-01-14T06:19:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	Amaranth	Before on Hoary KDE apps used to run very slowly and took alot time to load on GNOME
2006-01-14T06:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	That's just because C++ apps and libs take forever to find dependency libs and load them.
2006-01-14T06:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	prelinking helps a lot with C++

2006-01-14T06:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	freetype likes to change ABI/API without a new major version number

2006-01-14T06:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	You need the freetype, cairo, glib, and pango from dapper.
2006-01-14T06:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	St0n3-C0l	 If you get one you have to get them all.
