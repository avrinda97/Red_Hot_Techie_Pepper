2008-04-23T03:07:00.000Z	_20eric06_		Hello, I've just bought a new computer which has Ubuntu, and I want to double-boot XP with it, but I don't know how to use the GNU Parted
2008-04-23T03:07:00.000Z	_20eric06_		Could anyone help me?
2008-04-23T03:08:00.000Z	_20eric06_		Hello, anyone?
2008-04-23T03:09:00.000Z	_20eric06_		It came with the computer
2008-04-23T03:09:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	download it
2008-04-23T03:14:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	the first step is for you to burn an ubuntu desktop cd so you can repartition
2008-04-23T03:15:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	I take that back, the very first step is to back up your files
2008-04-23T03:16:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	such things exist, yes. but that is not as easy as backing up, burning an ubuntu cd
2008-04-23T03:17:00.000Z	_20eric06_	proq	Is there how to burn the entire Ubuntu system (2gb apparently) on a DVD, format, instal XP, repartition and then install Ubuntu?
2008-04-23T03:17:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	yes, but those are separate howtos. again, I wouldn't try making a DVD from your system. it's harder
2008-04-23T03:21:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	windows doesn't have as many games as playstation. maybe that's what you need
2008-04-23T03:22:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	on top of that, you can still run ubuntu on playstation
2008-04-23T03:25:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	that's not much space
2008-04-23T03:25:00.000Z	_20eric06_	proq	It's not.
2008-04-23T03:25:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	is that a rescue partition?
2008-04-23T03:28:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda  will tell you if it's swap
2008-04-23T03:28:00.000Z	_20eric06_	proq	I'm not on linux
2008-04-23T03:29:00.000Z	_20eric06_	proq	Should I delete the 233gb partition, make a new 213 one for windows, leaving 20gb for Linux?
2008-04-23T03:30:00.000Z	proq	_20eric06_	you also need a swap partition, and possibly anything else you want on a partition
