2007-03-10T13:45:00.000Z	garuhhh		sorry mistyped hi! am using firestarter, can't seem to share my internet ...
2007-03-10T13:46:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	you gotta do a couple things,
2007-03-10T13:46:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	first, make sure that everything is networking properly,
2007-03-10T13:47:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	if you set DHCP to on, it will assign a 'gateway' ip to your local network interface,
2007-03-10T13:47:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	then assign ip's in that same subnet to the other computers
2007-03-10T13:48:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	i'm talking about networking in the sense of IP addressing
2007-03-10T13:48:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	what needs to happen: you need to be able to ping the shared computer, and vice-versa
2007-03-10T13:49:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	firestarter has a problem with static addressing, so you have to mangle the ipTables rules....
2007-03-10T13:49:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	it's not fun
2007-03-10T13:51:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	what you are interested in is what iptables has in it's FORWARD table
2007-03-10T13:52:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	do this, type $sudo iptables-save
2007-03-10T13:53:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	you should see a bunch of stuff in after INPUT, OUTPUT, INBOUND, OUTBOUND, LSI, and LSO
2007-03-10T13:53:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	what you want is what's after FORWARD
2007-03-10T13:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	for ex, mine says "-A FORWARD -p icmp -m limit --limit 10/sec -j ACCEPT"
2007-03-10T13:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	then "-A FORWARD -j LOG_FILTER"
2007-03-10T13:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	then "-A FORWARD -j LOG --log-prefix "Unknown Forward" --log-level"
2007-03-10T13:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	and that's it
2007-03-10T13:55:00.000Z	rdw200169	garuhhh	with the FORWARD ones?
