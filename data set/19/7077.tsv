2007-10-14T12:10:00.000Z	Mumphster	silent	I am trying to get my onboard sound to work
2007-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	silent	Mumphster	is your sound card detected under lspci and/or the sound gui under system > preferences > sound?
2007-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	silent	Mumphster	have you installed the latest alsa driver and libraries?
2007-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	silent	Mumphster	1.0.15rc3?
2007-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	Mumphster	silent	I am pretty sure but how would I go about checking just to be positive?
2007-10-14T12:13:00.000Z	silent	Mumphster	did you download alsa and install it yourself?
2007-10-14T12:13:00.000Z	Mumphster	silent	im pretty sure I did but how would I go about checking
2007-10-14T12:14:00.000Z	silent	Mumphster	I'm not sure how you would check the version, but you can always reinstall to make sure, you want to reinstall?
