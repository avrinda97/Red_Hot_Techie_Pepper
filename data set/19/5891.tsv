2012-05-22T01:27:00.000Z	wolfdart		Hi folks. Can you help me with this issue? See this screenshot (http://s13.postimage.org/6kienasqd/gedit.png) and look the color of the embedded terminal on gedit: it's impossible to use it with this grey bg and white letter color! Can I change that?
2012-05-22T01:29:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	It looks like it's using the color, but not the background from the default config
2012-05-22T01:29:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	try changing the color to "black on white" in a normal terminal window.
2012-05-22T01:29:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	yes. I changed the gedit color scheme, but it did not help
2012-05-22T01:30:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	Restarted gedit since that?
2012-05-22T01:30:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	Yes! I will try change the terminal color scheme
2012-05-22T01:32:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	Change the terminal color didnt wirk too =/
2012-05-22T01:32:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	I'll install gedit-plugins and take a look at it, I guess :)
2012-05-22T01:33:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	thanks for that
2012-05-22T01:33:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	i will post this screen on ubuntu forum, maybe someone can solve this
2012-05-22T01:37:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	I can change the text to black with dconf-editor, but not the background
2012-05-22T01:37:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	org.gnome.gedit.plugins.terminal.forgound-color
2012-05-22T01:40:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	Actually... Just set the foreground and background color in dconf, and uncheck "use-theme-colors"
2012-05-22T01:41:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	hmmm. I will try
2012-05-22T01:41:00.000Z	undecim	wolfdart	It fixed the problem for me
2012-05-22T01:43:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	I never used this dconf-editor before. I installed dconf-tools package, is that right? If so I will look on Google how to use.
2012-05-22T01:43:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	Thanks for that.
2012-05-22T01:43:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	Thanks for that tip.
2012-05-22T01:46:00.000Z	wolfdart	undecim	IT WORKED!!! Thanks very much!! :D:D:D
