2012-08-19T09:22:00.000Z	Larr		right now I am using lubuntu 12.04 , but I heard everything is same under the hood
2012-08-19T09:22:00.000Z	Elesa		if your PC isn't very old you can try Xubuntu
2012-08-19T09:22:00.000Z	Elesa		Yes, everything is the same. It's only a different desktop environment. Lubuntu and Xubuntu have lightweight desktop environments, but both can do what Ubuntu does.

2012-08-19T09:24:00.000Z	Elesa		/dev/sda is her internal HDD. /dev/sdc is the external one where we want to install Ubuntu.
2012-08-19T09:24:00.000Z	Larr		but I think I have to re-think my options

2012-08-19T09:25:00.000Z	Elesa	Larr	if you are used to GNOME 2 and don't want to use Unity, you might want to use Xubuntu, since it's a nice alternative and similar to GNOME 2.
