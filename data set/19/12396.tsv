2005-10-01T12:58:00.000Z	mojo	linner	u hear about pocket with embedded linux and linuxdevices.com (methinks)
2005-10-01T12:59:00.000Z	linner	mojo	i can't remember if HP is coming out with one in 2007?  Have you heard that too?
2005-10-01T13:00:00.000Z	linner	mojo	you got it
2005-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	mojo	linner	sry not sure how either.  you said "increase" in delay?  i don't get it anyway, sry
2005-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	linner	mojo	hard to explain let me try though.................... i'm on a laptop and if i don't take my finger off IMMEDIATELY it keeps typing that same character
2005-10-01T13:10:00.000Z	mojo	linner	oh, you mean the key-repeat delay.  that MAY be a bios setting, even.
2005-10-01T13:10:00.000Z	linner	mojo	i don't think so...
2005-10-01T13:10:00.000Z	mojo	linner	if my ffox was working just now I could point u to an article that talks about how keys are processed in linux and x
2005-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	linner	mojo	ok.. i'll google it and find out
2005-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	linner	mojo	thought it might be a quick fix
2005-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	mojo	linner	good luck.  I know that there is some confusion cuz the kernel maps keys, then x re-maps them itself
2005-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	linner	mojo	oh?
2005-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	mojo	linner	but n e way gl
2005-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	linner	mojo	huh?
2005-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	mojo	linner	kernel makes keycode from raw data stream on kebd input.  x takes keycodes, and makes its own mappings of them.  i didn't read article yet, had it saved.
2005-10-01T13:19:00.000Z	mojo	linner	okay let me see if i can find that 4 u now.. ffox is back up for me...
2005-10-01T13:23:00.000Z	mojo	linner	what i found was https://wiki.ubuntu.com//MultimediaKeys but it may not help..  read at "in depth" heading maybe.  but i saw something else too i thought...
2005-10-01T13:29:00.000Z	mojo	linner	try the console command kbdrate (man kbdrate)
2005-10-01T13:29:00.000Z	mojo	linner	or look into the man pages on xset, as it may be in x
