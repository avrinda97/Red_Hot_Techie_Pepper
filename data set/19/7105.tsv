2008-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	what gives you $ uname -r ?
2008-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	2.6.24-12-386
2008-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	i think you need to install 'linux-generic' and then reboot with that kernel
2008-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	after that proceed
2008-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	Is it a known problem that virtualbox may mess with the kernel/modules?
2008-03-15T16:09:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	you are running an custom not standard kernel 'i386'
2008-03-15T16:09:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	default is '*-generic'
2008-03-15T16:10:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	'i386' is the 'pure' without any fancyness
2008-03-15T16:10:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	It tells me that linux-generic is already the latest version
2008-03-15T16:11:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	that means it is allready installed
2008-03-15T16:11:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	then reboot
2008-03-15T16:11:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	OK
2008-03-15T16:11:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	and in grub choose *-generic
2008-03-15T16:19:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	I believe virtualbox pulled in linux-386. I've removed it, rebuilt the iniramfs and am rebooting now.

2008-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	Just rebooted; sound and wireless are back in business. uname- r tells me it's -generic.
2008-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	ok
2008-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	m1lkc0w	Xk2c	Thanks a bunch for your help.
2008-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	Xk2c	m1lkc0w	;)
