2008-11-01T09:31:00.000Z	oorjha		Why was the displayconfig-gtk package removed ? I want it badly, what is the alternative ?
2008-11-01T09:33:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	not sure there is an alternative - everything is supposed to be detected
2008-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	there isn't a replacement - 8:10 seems ok for now, but i haven't done many installations of it yet
2008-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	Its not recognising by default, xorg.conf itself is not showing any details.
2008-11-01T09:36:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	ye - the xorg.conf file is supposed to be pretty empty
2008-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	have you tried sudo dpkg -reconfigure... command you can find in xorg.conf?
2008-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	I will attempt that and get back to you
2008-11-01T09:40:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	yes back to writing everything manually :(
2008-11-01T09:41:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	did you read jim_p's comment to use X -configure?
2008-11-01T09:43:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	what type of monitor are you having troubles with and what is the trouble?
2008-11-01T09:43:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is not working as it used to be in hardy and previous releases.. It now completes in only 4 steps
2008-11-01T09:43:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	what type of monitor are you having troubles with and what is the trouble?
2008-11-01T09:44:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	jim_p , I am using Viewsonic 17 inch widescreen with default resolution 1280x720
2008-11-01T09:46:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	flatscreen or one of the old crt's?
2008-11-01T09:47:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	flatscreen LCD, the problem is the horizontal and vertical syncs are not being detected automatically
2008-11-01T09:50:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	run through the page at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=269052&highlight=1280 and see if that helps
2008-11-01T09:52:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	I'm planning to run hardy live cd and make a backup of the xorg.conf there and pasting it back here, instead doing all those manual stuff, Would that work ?
2008-11-01T09:53:00.000Z	dovel	oorjha	most likely
2008-11-01T09:54:00.000Z	oorjha	dovel	jim_p, Thanks for your time, booting hardy
