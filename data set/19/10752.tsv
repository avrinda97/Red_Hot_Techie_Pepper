2006-05-30T16:06:00.000Z	fli7e		efficient in terms of doing what you need it to and nothing more, i think he meant
2006-05-30T16:06:00.000Z	fli7e		or she
2006-05-30T05:18:00.000Z	fli7e		can someone explain to me the difference between runlevel s and runlevel 1? from what i have always understood, they are more or less the same
2006-05-30T05:18:00.000Z	fli7e		single user mode
2006-05-30T05:19:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	s level in system initialization level at boot. 1 is single user level. :)
2006-05-30T05:20:00.000Z	fli7e	crazy_penguin	so S is completely noninteractive?
2006-05-30T05:21:00.000Z	crazy_penguin		yes
2006-05-30T05:21:00.000Z	crazy_penguin		it's were the program for the initialization of the system runs, after that the system switches to one of the 12345 levels
2006-05-30T05:21:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	^^^
2006-05-30T05:23:00.000Z	fli7e		so is runlevel S identical to/a synonym for runlevel 1? intelikey, you are leading me to beleive it is, but crazy_penguin i think is saying there is a difference
2006-05-30T05:23:00.000Z	crazy_penguin		no
2006-05-30T05:23:00.000Z	crazy_penguin		it's not
2006-05-30T05:24:00.000Z	crazy_penguin		the level S and the level 1 are different
2006-05-30T05:25:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	the init process at boot runs first the S level programs to initialise everything and after switches to one of the 1 2 3 4 5 runlevels
2006-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	the 1 2 3 4 5 level are interactive
2006-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	fli7e	crazy_penguin	thanks... that makes a little more sense.
2006-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	the s level not
2006-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	you're welcome
2006-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	crazy_penguin	fli7e	:)
