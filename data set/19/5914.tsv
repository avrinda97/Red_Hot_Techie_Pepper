2008-06-18T20:35:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	damn you are hardcore dude :P what are you reading ?
2008-06-18T20:26:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	you have to put a script in therre first, then it'll display the scirpts (and browse) in right click
2008-06-18T20:27:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	I know :) but I cant seem to find the directory in the gui ?
2008-06-18T20:27:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	ah, then hit ctl-h in the browser :)
2008-06-18T20:27:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	while in your home dir, that is
2008-06-18T20:28:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	niiice :D 10000 thx to you m8 :)
2008-06-18T20:30:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	I dont need to install the scripts, just place them in the folder right ?
2008-06-18T20:30:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	correct
2008-06-18T20:31:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	im installing a script to mount iso files, but i dont get the "scripts" option when rightclick the files
2008-06-18T20:34:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	try killall nautilus , that should make it see the script
2008-06-18T20:35:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	you saved me 5 hours of searching that for sure :)
2008-06-18T20:38:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	would a reboot help if I still cant see the "scripts" option when i rightclick
2008-06-18T20:39:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	at worst, log out and back in. Are you sure the script is executable?
2008-06-18T20:40:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	its .sh so it should be :)
2008-06-18T20:41:00.000Z	nickrud	buckie	no, .sh doesn't make it executable, the excutable bit needs to be set. Right click the file, select properties, and click the executable checkbox
2008-06-18T20:44:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	ahhhh :)
2008-06-18T20:45:00.000Z	buckie	nickrud	thx, ill bash that text :)
