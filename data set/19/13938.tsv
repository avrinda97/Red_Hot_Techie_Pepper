2005-03-09T09:56:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		i just downloaded the openoffice.org installer for 1.1.4 and it claims i cant update it because the previous version was a networkj install
2005-03-09T09:58:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		whats a network install, and should i just remove openoffice altogther?  if so how do i do that?
2005-03-09T09:59:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	did you read the install howto with Linux its a two stage thing  need to do a system install then run it as a suer and that sets up the user stuff
2005-03-09T10:00:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	and you should just have used synaptic and installed the new version it would have just gone straight in
2005-03-09T10:02:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	you missed the point the whole idea of Ubuntu/Debian is all the packages are setup debugged and configured "for your desktop" if you download stuff and install the installers dont interface with your desktop well in many cases to icons are missing things are missing in your menu's etc ..the package manager and the packages dont just install software they configure the install too
2005-03-09T10:04:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	pick the core package for openoffice and what you need will be downloaded
2005-03-09T10:05:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	yeppers
2005-03-09T10:12:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	wait a few weeks and it will be the default lol
2005-03-09T10:13:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	the 1.9/2.0 stuff has been going for a long time now
2005-03-09T10:13:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	I was told this 1/4
2005-03-09T10:15:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	yep
2005-03-09T10:15:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	hmm last time I did the debian update of OOo I had to remove it before the install
2005-03-09T12:19:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	your kidding Ubuntu has a built in burner
2005-03-09T12:19:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	Nautilus the file browser can burn CD's on the fly
2005-03-09T12:21:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	you can but it will download about 20 packages because it uses the kde desktop
2005-03-09T12:22:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	read the Ubuntu howto on there home page you can use nautilus just drop the files on the cd
2005-03-09T12:28:00.000Z	linux_galor1	shadeofgrey	need to get xorg with the OpenGL transparency patch
