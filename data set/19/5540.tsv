2008-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	w0ss4g3		Hi, can someone help me? I've just installed x86_64 hardy heron on my lappy, and when i access the terminal from the apps menu, i dont get a bash shell... only the default gnome terminal.. obviously it works if i type bash, but can someone tell me how to fix it so it goes straight to bash?
2008-06-10T02:36:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	From the GUI or the command line?
2008-06-10T02:37:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	From the go to preferences and then select your profile and select the advanced tab, then select your desired shell.
2008-06-10T02:38:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	via sys -> admin -> users and groups ? - its all blanked out :/
2008-06-10T02:39:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	Which version are you useing?
2008-06-10T02:40:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	Choose "unlock" next to the close button and authenticate, then choose your login name and click properties, then choose advanced.  Then type /bin/bash in the shell input.
2008-06-10T02:41:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	just trying that now.. do I need to logout and back in?
2008-06-10T02:41:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	still the same
2008-06-10T02:43:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	in fact when I change it, as soon as I go back it's defaulted back to /bin/sh. how do I source my profile?
2008-06-10T02:44:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	source ~/.profile
2008-06-10T02:44:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	where "profile" = my username ?
2008-06-10T02:44:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	no, just as I showed above
2008-06-10T02:44:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	~/ means go to the current users home folder
2008-06-10T02:46:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	source: command not found :\
2008-06-10T02:48:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	in fact, it says /home/username/.profile: no such file or directory
2008-06-10T02:48:00.000Z	acgiglyph	w0ss4g3	Can you try that command from a bash shell?
2008-06-10T02:49:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	also, I've just checked and my fstab appears to be blank :/
2008-06-10T02:49:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	just says # UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM
2008-06-10T02:53:00.000Z	w0ss4g3	acgiglyph	don't worry.. I think I've made some mistakes on install.. going to start again
