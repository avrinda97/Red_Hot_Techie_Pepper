2009-12-28T10:25:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	video quality of what?
2009-12-28T10:25:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	video quality of movies , etc
2009-12-28T10:27:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	make sure u have codecs and video card drivers installed.. thats about it
2009-12-28T10:27:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	yup i do have but there was some file to edit which i done in jaunty which increased my video quality (i guess it was on ubuntu's site)
2009-12-28T10:28:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	i think that would be application specific
2009-12-28T10:28:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	try using vlc media player
2009-12-28T10:29:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	yup i using that
2009-12-28T10:29:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	the file i edited had this at the end # Line commented out by installer because it failed to verify:
2009-12-28T10:30:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	yup that was it i edited that and it increased all the display quality
2009-12-28T10:30:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	NO it didnt.
2009-12-28T10:32:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	your repository sources has nothing to do with video quality, editing that file wont do anything to your quality
2009-12-28T10:32:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	yea it actually did (i had broken something and my totem wasn't loading so someone told me to do this and it increased the display quality and fixed the video problem (also VLC all other with video))
2009-12-28T10:32:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	yno, it actually didn't
2009-12-28T10:33:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	maybe its something that you installed AFTER adding the repository
2009-12-28T10:33:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	maybe
2009-12-28T10:34:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	friendishan	i have a feeling you need to update or enable your video card driver... just a feeling.... as VLC uses its own codec files
2009-12-28T10:34:00.000Z	friendishan	ae86-drifter	ok
