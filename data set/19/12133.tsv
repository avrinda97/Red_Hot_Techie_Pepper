2006-05-27T13:59:00.000Z	rukuartic		Ah. o-o
2006-05-27T13:59:00.000Z	rukuartic		still looking for anyone who'se used a laptop with linux... can anyone reccommend a good compatible laptop?
2006-05-27T14:00:00.000Z	rukuartic		Anything made by HP or Dell or Compaq doesn't work too swiftly with linux... as I've understood.
2006-05-27T14:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	I'll second that.  T43 here.
2006-08-22T09:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	The man pages for chmod and chown will also be helpful.
2006-08-22T09:57:00.000Z	rukuartic	tonyyarusso	Well... actually I've been looking. I've read a few articles, but I'm having a tad of trouble. For example, I've added a test user (no sshd, don't worry :P) and I'm trying to figure out why when /home/test is rwxr-x--- I can't read it (yes I'm part of the test group)
2006-08-22T09:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	Do the files in the folder have matching permissions?  What filesystem?
2006-08-22T09:59:00.000Z	rukuartic	tonyyarusso	ext3 I'm pretty sure. there's only one visible file in the directory, and its 770
2006-08-22T10:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	So it says you don't have permissions to see that then?  Is this in Gnome, cli, or both?  (Like, will 'cat filename' work even if Nautilus won't?)
2006-08-22T10:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	tonyyarusso	I'm actually just working in bash... I try cd /home/test and I get "permission denied". let me try nautilus really quick.
2006-08-22T10:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	tonyyarusso	Update--Doesn't work in nautilus either.
2006-08-22T10:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	Can I see the ls -l of /home/test and groups rukuartic, just to see for myself?
2006-08-22T10:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	tonyyarusso	sure
2007-03-19T08:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	It is done, yes
2007-03-19T08:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	Companies do it for internal resources, for instance.
2007-03-19T08:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	tonyyarusso	Well of course! I'm just looking for something neat to host in my basement ot show off to friends.
2007-03-19T08:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rukuartic	hehe - I had my blog on a home connection for a little while.  Networked games too
