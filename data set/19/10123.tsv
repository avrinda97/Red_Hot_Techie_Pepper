2009-04-21T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	of course
2009-04-21T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	there was a good review recently
2009-04-21T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	hold on  I should be able to find it again
2009-04-21T03:42:00.000Z	etzerd	sebsebseb	the reason that I asked I heard a lot about it. the reason for is because it's base on ubuntu.
2009-04-21T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	like GOS   they are good distros, but  I would recommend using proper Ubuntu
2009-04-21T03:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	I could find that review
2009-04-21T03:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	,but yes  it comes with propritary stuff by default, and has some linuxmint  changes to some programs
2009-04-21T03:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	I want to try mint in a virtual machine :)  once I am setup again  nicely  this time round with  Ubuntu 9.04  and Ext4 file system
2009-04-21T03:46:00.000Z	etzerd	sebsebseb	never heard about GOS

2009-04-21T03:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	Ubuntu is based on Debian one of the first distros,  and now days quite a lot of distros are based on  Ubuntu as well,  because it got all popular, and it's good,  Mint,  GoogleOS etc
2009-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	loads of distros out there, it's not just Ubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu, and more Ubuntu.   http://www.distrowatch.com is a good site for finding out about distros
2009-05-05T08:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	etzerd	hi
2009-05-05T08:12:00.000Z	etzerd	sebsebseb	can you tell me the website that I can donwload codecs and some other restricted for Ubuntu? someone tell me last week and I forget the address
