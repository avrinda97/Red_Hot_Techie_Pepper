2006-07-05T14:01:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I have installed (k)ubuntu Dapper and there's one problem that drives me mad: gam_server. There are running gam_server processes for each user and they consume about 20 % of cpu. How can I solve that?
2006-07-05T14:02:00.000Z	tsume	vlt	hmmm, what was gam_server part of?
2006-07-05T14:04:00.000Z	vlt	tsume	google tells me gamin ...
2006-07-05T14:04:00.000Z	tsume	vlt	yeah, wait ahead :) I just didn't know what gamin was used for
2006-07-05T14:05:00.000Z	tsume	vlt	gam_server isn't running on mine right now actually. I remember seeing it, it must have disappeared on me :)
2006-07-05T14:05:00.000Z	vlt	tsume	I think it's the Gnome (wth gnome on Kubuntu?!?) file alteration monitor.
2006-07-05T14:06:00.000Z	tsume	vlt	yeah, I'm running Gnome right now ;)
2006-07-05T14:06:00.000Z	tsume	vlt	I suppose you're running Breezy?
2006-07-05T14:06:00.000Z	vlt	tsume	no a fresh Dapper stable
