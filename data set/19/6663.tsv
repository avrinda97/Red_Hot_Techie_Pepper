2008-02-01T05:11:00.000Z	quittt		there is something wrong on my boot
2008-02-01T05:11:00.000Z	quittt		when I boot, do you know the Ubuntu logo? nothing appers, the monitor keeps down
2008-02-01T05:11:00.000Z	quittt		and when the boot finished, the monitor opens
2008-02-01T05:11:00.000Z	quittt		it is vey bizarre, what can be making this?
2008-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	when the boot is over you still get into Ubuntu?
2008-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	quittt		of course
2008-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	quittt		everything works perfecly
2008-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	quittt		perfectly
2008-02-01T05:12:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	Could be a problem with the usplash. Have you changed it recently?
2008-02-01T05:13:00.000Z	quittt	syntaxerror55	I've just installed Xubuntu
2008-02-01T05:13:00.000Z	quittt		hehe
2008-02-01T05:14:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	Xubuntu would have changed the usplash. I think I know how to fix it
2008-02-01T05:15:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	type sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
2008-02-01T05:15:00.000Z	quittt	syntaxerror55	it is not this
2008-02-01T05:15:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	huh?
2008-02-01T05:16:00.000Z	quittt		it was a misconfiguration of the installer... actually is a bug... usplash.conf the resolution is not supported by my monitor
2008-02-01T05:16:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	I thought you didn't know the problem. :|
2008-02-01T05:16:00.000Z	quittt	syntaxerror55	just discovered it, =P
2008-02-01T05:17:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	quittt	ah, k
