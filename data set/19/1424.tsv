2012-02-05T01:05:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	What do you try to open it with?
2012-02-05T01:06:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	Or is it a random tarball?
2012-02-05T01:09:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	Go to terminal, and type: udo dpkg -i $HOME/Downloads/google-talkplugin_current_i386.deb"
2012-02-05T01:15:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	Type the thing i put in quotes. Does it work/did it install?
2012-02-05T01:21:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	There are even GUIs for installing Debian packages, such as GDebI, you should consider installing that, for the sake of not having problems with filenames
2012-02-05T01:23:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	Try putting the filename in your command in quotes
2012-02-05T01:25:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	What are you trying to do, BTW?
2012-02-05T01:25:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	Ok, to make it simple, just type "sudo apt-get install gdebi"
2012-02-05T01:26:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	no, it's a command
2012-02-05T01:29:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	An installer should pop up, and allow you to easily install it
2012-02-05T01:31:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	well, i can't help you from there. I don't know enough information to help you
2012-02-05T01:36:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	Can you tell me what happens when you go to the 'open with' options?
2012-02-05T01:40:00.000Z	__Alex_	rick__	I can't help you, because i don't use Gnome, and would lead you blindly, ask someone else, please
