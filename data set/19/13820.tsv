2005-01-22T17:25:00.000Z	neighborlee		    (none)
2005-01-22T17:25:00.000Z	no0tic		uhm

2005-01-22T17:27:00.000Z	no0tic	neighborlee	did it ask you anything
2005-01-22T17:27:00.000Z	neighborlee		Syntax for the root user:
2005-01-22T17:27:00.000Z	neighborlee		    /usr/sbin/ptal-init start|stop|setup|status|condrestart [-q[uiet] |-v[erbose] ] 
2005-01-22T17:28:00.000Z	no0tic	neighborlee	the setup option lets you define new devices
2005-01-22T17:28:00.000Z	neighborlee	no0tic	its not giving me that option set because its finding  'none' for devices ;(
2005-01-22T17:29:00.000Z	neighborlee	no0tic	I  had this all working before ..had to reinstall and dont recall how I got working ;(
