2009-09-20T19:45:00.000Z	n-iCe		is amd64 only for amd processors?
2009-09-20T19:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	or Intel 64-bit
2011-07-05T23:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	did you try skype from the partner repo?  kernel panics can be difficult to diagnose (equivalent to BSOD in Windows)
2011-07-05T23:57:00.000Z	n-iCe	ZykoticK9	found this in logs, what do you think? http://pastebin.com/QN0e6Jsy
2011-07-05T23:57:00.000Z	n-iCe	ZykoticK9	yes I tried
2011-07-05T23:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	sorry your pastebin doesn't mean anything to me really.  Best of luck.
2011-07-06T01:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	i imagine that "it depends", but if it's a kernel built-in, then it's not really a file at all (besides the kernel files)
2011-07-06T00:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	drive or driver?
2011-07-06T00:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	for driver, yes blacklist
2011-07-06T00:56:00.000Z	n-iCe	ZykoticK9	[   19.205417] rtl8187: Card reports RF frontend Realtek 8225
2011-07-06T00:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	not sure, but perhaps the driver is built into the kernel?
2011-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	n-iCe	ZykoticK9	yes it is, it won't stop ot?
2011-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	"lsmod | grep rtl8187" show anything?
2011-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	blacklist only stops modules, if it's built into the kernel, i doubt it would have any effect
2011-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	n-iCe	ZykoticK9	what can I dot to remove it from the kernel?
2011-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	you don't...
2011-07-06T01:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	it's obviously possible - but beyond me... good luck.
2011-07-06T01:01:00.000Z	n-iCe	ZykoticK9	is the a drive a single file? or whole of folders and files?
2011-07-06T01:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	n-iCe	not sure?
