2011-02-24T13:21:00.000Z	ndxtg		hi guys! what is the latest version of Ubuntu that uses grub instead of grub2?  thanks
2011-02-24T13:21:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	you can uninstall grub23 and install grub
2011-02-24T13:21:00.000Z	ndxtg	mickster04	oh really? that's great, thank you :D
2011-02-24T13:22:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	investigate it
2011-02-24T13:24:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	not sure why'd you want to tho:/
2011-02-24T13:26:00.000Z	ndxtg	mickster04	I'm gonna build a commercial software system based on ubuntu and I just like to reduce the unnecessary stuffs to make sure everything is fine
2011-02-24T13:28:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	not sure using grub is a sensible choice concidering the whole support issues you will account soon
2011-02-24T13:29:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	considering*
2011-02-24T13:29:00.000Z	ndxtg	mickster04	oh... im familiar with grub and no idea/no time to learn grub2 so... just try to utilise everything :)
2011-02-24T13:30:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	that is a fair arguement
2011-02-28T08:01:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	why do you need gnome? its a server? you'll need x server first aswell?
2011-02-28T08:02:00.000Z	ndxtg	mickster04	yea, but i dont remember the exact package names, cant google it out (I need to install a minimal ubuntu and its the only way)
2011-02-28T08:03:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	you know of minimal install cd, aka alternate install, also ubuntu-mini
2011-02-28T08:05:00.000Z	ndxtg	mickster04	I thought alternate is like the normal desktop CD, except it does not have "Try it live" , so when installed, it comes with lot of apps
2011-02-28T08:06:00.000Z	mickster04	ndxtg	do you have a browser available?
2011-02-28T08:07:00.000Z	ndxtg	mickster04	as said above, google does not help
