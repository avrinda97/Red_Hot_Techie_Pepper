2005-11-07T14:40:00.000Z	runedude_		my system i got from dell comes with integrated sound.. so i really am not sure what to do to get my sound working, since i dont know the driver to use.
2005-11-07T14:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	how are you testing it?
2005-11-07T14:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	try rhythmbox?
2005-11-07T14:42:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	or set the output plugin of xmms to esound
2005-11-07T14:42:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	let me know if it works and I'll update the bot to say "Breezy" instead of hoary ;)
2005-11-07T14:42:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	you're using Hoary?
2005-11-07T14:43:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	and gnome?
2005-11-07T14:43:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	why not use amarok from kde :)
2005-11-07T14:43:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	apt-get install it and never look back ;)
2005-11-07T14:47:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	no?
2005-11-07T14:48:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	such as?
2005-11-07T14:48:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	did you install "gstreamer0.8-mad" for playing mp3s?
2005-11-07T14:49:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	should play .oggs fine, hrm... how about installing "amarok-xine" instead?
2005-11-07T14:49:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	amarok uses gstreamer by default, but xine plays most everything
2005-11-07T14:52:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	aww... maybe your sound card isn't supported... or... your user isn't in the 'audio' group
2005-11-07T14:53:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	from a term "lsmod |grep snd"
2005-11-07T14:53:00.000Z	bur[n] er	runedude_	looks like your sound drivers arent going for some reason :\
