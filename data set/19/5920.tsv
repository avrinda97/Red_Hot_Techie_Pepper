2008-04-16T06:37:00.000Z	JohnK`		I can't get the Number of Desktops in CompizConfig to go above 1.
2008-04-16T06:37:00.000Z	JohnK`		i'm using KDE 3.5
2008-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	JohnK`		odd.
2008-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	JohnK`		oh
2008-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	JohnK`		orbixx, killall firefox
2008-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	JohnK`		wait, are you upgrading, orbixx?
2008-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	JohnK`		that happened to me.
2008-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	JohnK`		while i was upgrading
2008-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	JohnK`		to 8.04\
2008-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	JohnK`		so does anyone have ANY idea why i can't get the number of desktops to go above 1 in CompizConfig?
2008-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	bazhang	JohnK`	ccsm general settings--->virtual horizon desktops set to 4
2008-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	JohnK`	bazhang	but that dosen't work right with kicker
2008-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	JohnK`		kicker won't let me go above one either
2008-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	JohnK`		and it's frustrating
2008-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	JohnK`		because i'm used to having multiple desktops.
2008-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	JohnK`		and i can only have one.
2008-04-16T06:41:00.000Z	bazhang	JohnK`	best bet is to join the compiz channel-->how critical of a problem is this? sounds mainly aesthetic
2008-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	JohnK`	bazhang	it's more than aesthetic because it affects my productivity
2008-04-16T06:43:00.000Z	bazhang	JohnK`	but 8 messages in 3 minutes here? /j #compiz-fusion
