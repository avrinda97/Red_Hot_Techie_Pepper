2005-06-09T06:58:00.000Z	yahalom		can someone tell me what i need to change in interface in order to prevent getting d/c everytime my ip is renewed?
2005-06-09T06:59:00.000Z	Fikrann	yahalom	if you get your ip changed, there's nothing that can help prevent you from getting disconnected.
2005-06-09T06:59:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	i can make sure it stops checking for my ip
2005-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	i forgot the settings
2005-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	works like a charm
2005-06-09T07:01:00.000Z	Fikrann	yahalom	you can kill dhclient3, but don't be surprised if you get weird problems like someone else getting your current ip assigned.
2005-06-09T07:01:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	not that. something in /usr/lib/ppr/interfaces
2005-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	/etc/network/interfaces
2005-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	# The primary network interface
2005-06-09T07:04:00.000Z	Fikrann	yahalom	if your network is using dhcp, not using it is asking for administrator rage.
2005-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	well i'm paying them for a service.
2005-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	i get disconnected every 30 minutes when i use dhcp
2005-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	Fikrann	yahalom	and you'll probably get into problems for disrupting their service.
2005-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	then i'll change isp for bad service :)
2005-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	Fikrann	yahalom	of course it doesn't
2005-06-09T07:10:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	ignore the 0.0.0.0
2005-06-09T07:11:00.000Z	Fikrann	yahalom	it's better to use 1.2.3.4 or something similar as IP stub, since 0.0.0.0 is reserved address.
2005-06-09T07:11:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	man. all i know is that this is the only way i stay connected :(
2005-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	yahalom	Fikrann	i'll leave it on dhcp and see if it disconnect sme
