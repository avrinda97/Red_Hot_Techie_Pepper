2007-04-20T12:17:00.000Z	valermos		has anybody else gotten feisty to work with an ATI card and direct rendering?
2007-04-20T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	I have
2007-04-20T12:18:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	I have a 9600 and i keep getting an error message "PreInitDAL failed"
2007-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	somehow I got 2d working... I have no idea.. but i don't have direct rendering, and it's running OpenGL: Tungsten Graphics
2007-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	Have you tried the restricted driver manager?
2007-04-20T12:20:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	Yeah, it seems like whenever i run the restricted driver mananger, it puts me back into a no video situation
2007-04-20T12:20:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	I've had the most success so far with the proprietary driver from ATI
2007-04-20T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	How did you install the ATi drivers in Edgy?
2007-04-20T12:24:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	hmm... It was a while ago... But I think I used the xorg-driver-fglrx package from the repository... I'm pretty sure i added the restricted repository to my sources
2007-04-20T12:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	Could you pastebin your sources.list?
2007-04-20T12:25:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	sure, just a sec
2007-04-20T12:27:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.ca/449447
2007-04-20T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	That all looks fine, did you ever install the Drivers from ATi.com/
2007-04-20T12:30:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	Yeah, as an alternative I followed a guide to install the ati-driver-installer-8.36.5-x86.x86_64.run package from ATI
2007-04-20T12:31:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	this is the guide i followed, method 2: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide
2007-04-20T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	What you did then may be interfering with the drivers from the repos.
2007-04-20T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	valermos	Follow the uninstall instructions then try the repo drivers again
2007-04-20T12:33:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	Alright I'll work on it... I'm about go go buy an nvidia card :) Thanks for your help. I might be back.
2007-04-20T13:48:00.000Z	valermos	Jordan_U	Hey, thanks again for the help. I finally got everything working through restricted-drivers. It turns out I had my xorg.con videoram set really low and it was causing some bizzare problems. Cheers!
