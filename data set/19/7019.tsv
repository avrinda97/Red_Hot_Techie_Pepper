2007-10-23T05:25:00.000Z	phixnay		Hey - I've noticed a problem that wasn't here when I upgraded to gutsy - now I'm having trouble with the full screen modes of firefox and totem. Have other people been reporting this?
2007-10-23T05:25:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	what problems are you seeing with full screen modes of firefox and totem?
2007-10-23T05:26:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	well with totem it wouldn't exit full screen for some movies (had to restart gdm) and for firefox it got 'stuck' between full and regular when I pressed f11
2007-10-23T05:27:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	have you tried disabling the visual effects (compiz) and see if this problem is still apparent?
2007-10-23T05:27:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	afaik the're not enabled on my computer
2007-10-23T05:28:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	it didn't use to be a problem - it worked fine for a while after I upgraded to gutsy
2007-10-23T05:28:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	right click on desktop -> Change desktop background - > Visual Effects Tab -> Click on None  (this is assuming you are using gutsy)
2007-10-23T05:32:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	it's already set to 'none'. I think it might have been a bug in one of the recent upgrades
2007-10-23T05:33:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	i've just tried the F11 thing in firefox here and i'm not having the same issue, it does sound to me like it is a video driver issue
2007-10-23T05:34:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	hmm, wonder if there's anything else I can try... I'll make sure that firefox and totem still do it
2007-10-23T05:34:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	are you using a nvidia card?
2007-10-23T05:35:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	yes
2007-10-23T05:35:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	have you installed nvidia-glx-new ?
2007-10-23T05:35:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	let me check
2007-10-23T05:36:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2007-10-23T05:37:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	desertc_: i didn't know I had to do anything at all! Everyone who was using nvidia-glx has to install nvidia-glx-new?
2007-10-23T05:38:00.000Z	troyoz	phixnay	nvidia-glx-new is just a new nvidia driver than the nvidia-glx package.  I have found to have less issues with nvidia-glx-new that I was having with the old driver, its worth a try if you are using nvidia-glx
2007-10-23T05:38:00.000Z	phixnay	troyoz	ok. I think last time I did it, the memory and the cpu were probably more taxed than usual, because I had like 30 tabs open
