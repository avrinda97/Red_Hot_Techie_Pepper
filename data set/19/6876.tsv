2007-11-29T03:57:00.000Z	MatthewV	nomojob	you have installed compizconfig-settings-manager ?
2007-11-29T03:58:00.000Z	nomojob	MatthewV	i think so, Synaptic says it is installed
2007-11-29T03:59:00.000Z	MatthewV	nomojob	if you hit Alt-F2 and then type in 'ccsm' (without quotes) and hit enter, what happens?
2007-11-29T03:59:00.000Z	nomojob	MatthewV	Could not open location 'file:///ccsm'
2007-11-29T04:01:00.000Z	nomojob	MatthewV	Could not open location 'file:///ccsm'
2007-11-29T04:01:00.000Z	MatthewV	nomojob	could you double check that you have the compizconfig-settings-manager installed? just type ' sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager' without quotes in terminal and that will tell you if it is not installed
