2009-06-08T13:28:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	how familiar are you with nic setup and routing on linux?
2009-06-08T13:29:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	read the nag2
2009-06-08T13:29:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	Alas, poor... Last time I tried anything like that I had to reinstall my OS...
2009-06-08T13:29:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	The what?
2009-06-08T13:29:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	google for it...its free.....network administrator's guide 2
2009-06-08T13:30:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	alright, I will have a general look in that direction.
2009-06-08T13:30:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	hateball: loof: Thanks for your help
2009-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	sites avialable/site not available has two main issues: dns or routing
2009-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	It's routing
2009-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	The DNS is working fine.
2009-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	Which is why I think the nodefaultroute option is the prime culprit
2009-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	But I haven't a clue how to rid myself of it
2009-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	use traceroute
2009-06-08T13:32:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	and read into ip2 tools...they give you more options then ifconfig and route
2009-06-08T13:37:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	looks like your provider has routing problems
2009-06-08T13:38:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	problems with its peers
2009-06-08T13:38:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	beli	(Whoops, I've been spelling your name wrong) But the problem doesn't manifest in Ubuntu 8.04!?!
2009-06-08T13:39:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	sometimes problems appear at the same time...and you misunderstand them because you think its because of your upgrade...got another os to try it out?
2009-06-08T13:43:00.000Z	beli	rpgsimmaster	boot the live cd then and check its settings related to ifconfig/route/dns/pppoe
