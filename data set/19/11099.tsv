2007-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	MenZa		Transmission is alright, I find
2007-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	MenZa		!fstab | Trae
2007-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	fstab isn't the easiest thing on the planet to deal with, hence why I was asking for help.
2007-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	what kind of drive is it?
2007-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	Sure, but what file type?
2007-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	Do you have an fstab entry for it now?
2007-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	Possibly I wasn't clear.  I currently have to type mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt   by hand to get the drive to mount
2007-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	But we want to add it to our fstab
2007-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	which means there is no fstab entry heh
2007-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	There might be; I have an fstab entry that doesn't automount
2007-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	sudo <favourite text editor here> /etc/fstab
2007-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	Any sign of /dev/sdb1?
2007-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	negative
2007-06-09T08:10:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	ok, try writing the following then: /dev/sdb1 /mnt ext3 rw,auto,user,exec 0 0
2007-06-09T08:10:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	shouldn't I ascertain if the drive is ext3 first?
2007-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	and how would I do that?
2007-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	I thought you'd already established that
2007-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	MenZa	Trae	do sudo fdisk -l
2007-06-09T08:13:00.000Z	Trae	MenZa	GrueTamer thanks
