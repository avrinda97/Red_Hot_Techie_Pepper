2005-04-18T11:56:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	gives an error
2005-04-18T11:56:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	which error?
2005-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	Failed to run users-admin:
2005-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	because I don't have the rights I think.
2005-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	you would have been asked for the root password
2005-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	there is no root passwd in ubuntu
2005-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	sorry, i mean your user password :)
2005-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	matthijs@tails:~$ sudo -s
2005-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	that's why the GNOME user thingie also doesn't work
2005-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	add yourself to /etc/sudoers, then :)
2005-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	I don't haver permission for that, need root for that.
2005-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	:|
2005-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	I'm in an endless loop hwaaa!
2005-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	you may try starting in single-user mode and adding yourself to /etc/sudoers
2005-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	How do I start single user from grub?
2005-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	select your ubuntu entry, press e, choose init, set it to /bin/bash
2005-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	matthijs_	trygvebw	thank you!
2005-04-18T12:01:00.000Z	trygvebw	matthijs_	np :)
