2012-05-14T23:18:00.000Z	trism	roasted	bug 781931 looks like it should be fixed in 5.14.0
2012-05-14T23:19:00.000Z	roasted	trism	looks like I'm on 5.12. Does apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade not update me to Unity 5.14?
2012-05-14T23:22:00.000Z	trism	roasted	5.14.0 isn't released yet, but actually on closer reading of the comments it might not, since the proposed fix is against gtk+ (and from a while ago)
2012-05-14T23:23:00.000Z	roasted	trism	then I wonder how my other laptop doesn't have this issue whatsoever...
2012-05-14T23:24:00.000Z	trism	roasted	don't know, I can reproduce it here on this netbook though
2012-05-14T23:25:00.000Z	roasted	trism	oh, so you're seeing the exact same thing?
2012-05-14T23:26:00.000Z	roasted	trism	I'm getting in the habit of hitting alt tab whenever I type in an application I want to open. Shouldn't need to do that, but it's nice to see it's not JUST me. :P
2012-05-29T22:48:00.000Z	trism	roasted	are you installing gimp2.8?
2012-05-29T22:48:00.000Z	roasted	trism	yes, sort of
2012-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	trism	roasted	if this is < 12.10, you will need and updated version of babl and gegl too
2012-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	roasted	trism	since 2.8 isn't in the repos, and we don't want PPAs to manage, I got the .deb's for 2.8 so I'm trying to figure out how to install them manually sow e can later automate it
2012-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	trism	roasted	yes that is fine, you'll just need those too
2012-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	roasted	trism	I suppose the .deb's wouldn't take care of that?
2012-05-29T22:51:00.000Z	trism	roasted	the newer versions are not in the repo (until 12.10), so you'd need to find them, think you'll just need libbabl-0.1-0 and libgegl-0.2-0
2012-05-29T22:52:00.000Z	roasted	trism	appreciate it - looking into those packages now!
2012-07-11T07:52:00.000Z	trism	roasted	~/.local/share/Trash
2012-07-11T07:53:00.000Z	roasted	trism	bingo, thanks!
2012-11-24T00:19:00.000Z	trism	roasted	gnome-terminal --full-screen -e command; though there is also: gnome-terminal --maximize -e command; if that's what you meant
