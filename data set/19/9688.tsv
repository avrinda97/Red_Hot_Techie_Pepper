2007-08-01T16:50:00.000Z	seamus7	javaJake	what should I use in the launcher ... ?
2007-08-01T16:50:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	ah, OK
2007-08-01T16:45:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	no
2007-08-01T16:45:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	right click your desktop, and click "Create Launcher..."
2007-08-01T16:46:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	the name is whatever you want to name it, and the command should be the bin file
2007-08-01T16:46:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	make sure it's set to "Application" of course
2007-08-01T16:49:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	use the premade script then
2007-08-01T16:49:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	if it will not launch, run the "Command" in a terminal and see what it says.
2007-08-01T16:50:00.000Z	seamus7	javaJake	i can get it to run in a terminal by changing to the directory and then using ./nameofgame
2007-08-01T16:50:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	make a new script, and punch in those commands that you use to start the game, one command per line
2007-08-01T16:51:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	save it as something like "nameofgame_customstart.sh" - something with the .sh ending
2007-08-01T16:51:00.000Z	seamus7	javaJake	oh ok ... does a script need anything special at the beginning .. lilke ##bash or something
2007-08-01T16:51:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	#!/bin/bash
2007-08-01T16:52:00.000Z	seamus7	javaJake	oh ok thx
2007-08-01T16:52:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	last step, while you are in the same directory as the newly created script, run "chmod u+x <nameofscript.sh>"
2007-08-01T16:52:00.000Z	seamus7	javaJake	ok
2007-08-01T16:53:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	without that, Linux will not let you run the script. It's a security feature. :)
2007-08-01T16:53:00.000Z	javaJake	seamus7	you have to tell Linux what specifically can be run.
2007-08-01T16:58:00.000Z	seamus7	javaJake	the script worked and I added it to my menu list.. thx
