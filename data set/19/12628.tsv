2006-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	eth42		I have a weird problem: gdm restarts when I type the first letter of my password. what could that be??
2006-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	holycow	eth42	does it restart if you don't start typing?
2006-01-01T17:43:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	no, only with the first type
2006-01-01T17:43:00.000Z	holycow	eth42	the only thing that i can think of is x is crashing, have you checked your logs?
2006-01-01T17:44:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	yes but I don't see anything serious
2006-01-01T17:44:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	and now the login worked without anything changed... wtf???!
2006-01-01T17:44:00.000Z	holycow	eth42	have you tried just a plain vesa driver just as a stab in the dark? i've never heard of this
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	holycow	eth42	well talking to us fixes most things magically
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	holycow		*cough*
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	holycow		:)
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	:-) I suppose it's not fixed yet
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	yesterday gdm wouldn't start
2006-01-01T17:46:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	only the wait-mouse pointer, the interface didn't come up until I removed the DPMS option... ????
2006-01-01T17:46:00.000Z	holycow	eth42	i don't have the faintest clue except to say, try a different driver
2006-01-01T17:46:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	yeah, probably..
2006-01-01T17:46:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	bit like windows :-)
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	holycow	eth42	please don't say such cruel things
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	holycow		:)
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	eth42	holycow	hehe
