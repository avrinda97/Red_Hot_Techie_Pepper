2007-03-02T16:09:00.000Z	tony_		hey I'm on my ubuntu laptop at my office, and we got a guy here who works on our spanish webpages and wants to type in Spanish and have it autocorrect to put the accents in the way Word does... will open office do that?
2007-03-02T16:09:00.000Z	tony_		and if so, how?
2007-03-02T16:11:00.000Z	tony_		so does anybody know if openOffice will autocorrect when typing in spanish?
2007-03-02T16:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	tony_	i'm spanish and i can say that it will ;)
2007-03-02T16:12:00.000Z	tony_	erUSUL	 do you know how to get it to then?
2007-03-02T16:13:00.000Z	tony_		I've installed Spanish support
2007-03-02T16:13:00.000Z	tony_		but I don't know how to tell it "Look... the language for this document is Spanish(Mexico)"
2007-03-02T16:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	tony_	it works by default here check in Tools>Option>Language support

2007-03-02T16:16:00.000Z	tony_		I typed some bad spanish in and it didn't autocorrect anything... then hit spellcheck and it still didn't find any errors :-(
