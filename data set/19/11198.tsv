2006-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	no
2006-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	he probably needs nvidia-glx
2006-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	umm why it will work with nv driver
2006-12-04T09:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	because nv sucks ;)
2006-12-04T09:37:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	I just looked at the image nad it does seem like a driver issue but nv should have worked fine
2006-12-04T10:05:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	I had him do that
2006-12-04T10:06:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	it's not in there
2006-12-04T10:06:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	well he said he just did grep -c3 nvidia|/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-12-04T10:07:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	but if he doesn't cat xorg.conf it won't even look for nvidia at least from my knowledge
2006-12-04T10:08:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	you don't need cat
2006-12-04T10:08:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	grep [options]  PATTERN [FILE...] 
2006-12-04T10:09:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	ah yeah that brings back the whole section my way only brings back one or two lines that's why I think i like cat better
2006-12-04T10:09:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	I wanted the whole section
2006-12-04T10:10:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	at least I know you can do it that way now :)
2006-12-04T10:10:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	-C is for "context"
2006-12-04T10:10:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	grep is your friend :)
2006-12-04T10:10:00.000Z	kitche	SuperQ	I use grep all the time but I usually do that cat way since I know what I m looking for usually
2006-12-04T10:10:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	yea
2006-12-04T10:11:00.000Z	SuperQ	kitche	I just wish ubuntu would default to nvidia binary drivers
