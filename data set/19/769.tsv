2011-09-19T20:31:00.000Z	alex-		I don know which control panel I have to choose for my server.
2011-09-19T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	none
2011-09-19T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	because they cause problems, and if you're running a server, you should know how to run it
2011-09-19T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	so why do you need a control panel ?
2011-09-19T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	it's 1 command
2011-09-19T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	a lot of control panels have problems with ubuntu due to how some of the file system applications are laid out
2011-09-19T20:34:00.000Z	alex-	ikonia	i'm thinking of ISPConfig, Froxlor, OpenPanel or VirtualMin
2011-09-19T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	try them see what you like and see what they break
2011-09-19T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	up to you
2011-09-19T21:11:00.000Z	alex-	ikonia	i dont really know...
2011-09-19T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	then you shouldn't be doing it
2011-09-19T21:12:00.000Z	alex-	ikonia	what do you mean?
2011-09-19T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	if you don't know which OS to use to run your hosting, you shouldn't be running hosting
2011-09-19T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	when you decide which one you want, you can move forward
2011-09-24T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	what's the issue ?
2011-09-24T17:18:00.000Z	alex-	ikonia	I have a python script on my website, but it just outputs the script on my website instead of running it
2011-09-24T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	you need apache setup to "execute" python, otherwise it just treats it as a text file and displays it
2011-09-24T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	you'll have to check the apache http documentation on using mod_python (I think it's called) or using python as a cgi script
2011-09-24T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	alex-	he means it has strict rules on content, check the /topic when you join
