2006-05-26T11:35:00.000Z	Polibio		I have 3CRWE154G72 wifi card, it works in kernel 2.6.15-19 but it does NOT work in the new kernels 2.6.15-21 to 23   What can I do to connect wirelessly again?
2006-05-26T11:36:00.000Z	DewDude	Polibio	what chipset is it based off of?
2006-05-26T11:36:00.000Z	Polibio		prism
2006-05-26T11:36:00.000Z	DewDude		odd
2006-05-26T11:36:00.000Z	DewDude		usually prism is supported
2006-05-26T11:36:00.000Z	DewDude		maybe they didn't load a module
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	DewDude		i've got issues with my ndiswrapper
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	DewDude		so..i can't really help you.
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	Polibio		I didn't need ndiswrappper, it worked perfectly without it
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	Polibio		but not in the lask kernels
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	DewDude		yeah, you don't
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	DewDude		but i do.
2006-05-26T11:37:00.000Z	DewDude		dude
2006-05-26T11:38:00.000Z	DewDude		you either don't have a module loaded, or your card isn't prism
2006-05-26T11:38:00.000Z	DewDude		i'm going to guess you have a module not loaded, or a bad config
2006-05-26T11:39:00.000Z	Polibio		and what should I do?
2006-05-26T11:39:00.000Z	DewDude		find out what driver you need
2006-05-26T11:39:00.000Z	DewDude		and load it
2006-05-26T11:40:00.000Z	Polibio	DewDude	how do you load a driver in Ubuntu?
