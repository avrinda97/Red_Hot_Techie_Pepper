2011-11-01T16:58:00.000Z	cablop		i plan to install ubuntu 64 bits on my desktop, any recommended size for the root partition?
2011-11-01T16:58:00.000Z	cablop		?
2011-11-01T16:59:00.000Z	bhavesh	cablop	I gave it 140GB.. just 50GB would be enough with all extra apps.
2011-11-01T16:59:00.000Z	cablop		mmm, i don't know how to set up the things nowadays, lol
2011-11-01T16:59:00.000Z	cablop		hello
2011-11-01T16:59:00.000Z	cablop		all extra apps?
2011-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	cablop		i just want normal usage, and development, maybe a little gaming
2011-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	cablop		as for he swap, i know the rule of 2x ram or 2.5 ram is not exactly what we need now
2011-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	cablop		but willing to go for 1.5x~2x size of ram for the swap
2011-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	bhavesh	cablop	I installed a lot of "Extra apps" and still just 31GB got used
2011-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	cablop		lol
2011-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	cablop		maybe i'll give it just 50 GB
2011-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	bhavesh		use zram if u wanna use your swap efficiently
2011-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	bhavesh		yes u can
2011-11-01T17:01:00.000Z	cablop		and no resize, because i am going to run it on top of a LUKS encryption
