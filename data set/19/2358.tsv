2010-05-22T04:09:00.000Z	mkhanyisi		Does anyone knows whether firefox 3.6 supports HTML5 or what?
2010-05-22T04:09:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	there's like  a hack for windows is all
2010-05-22T04:10:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	zaxonspox, thanks guys. was just curious.
2010-05-25T02:09:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	try using GParted
2010-05-25T02:10:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	cli
2010-05-25T02:10:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	i don't recommend that but take a look at these utilities: parted, cfdisk and fdisk
2010-05-25T02:11:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	don't really have a choice?
2010-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	can you only resize logical volumes?
2010-05-25T02:14:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	Yes, I Can!
2010-05-25T02:15:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	well my question is, i have http://pastie.textmate.org/private/bkiiciypnqhzdwteldifia … should i resize the logical or extended?
2010-05-25T02:17:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	treat extended as an envelope and the logic partition as the real letter, now you cannot shrink the envelope if the letter fills it up. first shrink the letter first
2010-05-25T02:19:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	I get Error: Could not detect file system.
2010-05-25T02:19:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	what application are you using to resize?
2010-05-25T02:19:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	parted
2010-05-25T02:20:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	as I have told you, you  rather be an expert on those, otherwise stay away and use GParted
2010-05-25T02:21:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	if i had to guess… gparted is just going to say, sorry, no can do since it's lvm
2010-05-25T02:21:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	webPragmatist	lvm, what is lvm and whats special about it?
2010-05-25T02:33:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	 is there not a clish gui version of gparted
2010-05-25T02:34:00.000Z	webPragmatist	mkhanyisi	what i did instead was resize the disk (it's a vm) and tried mkpart… but now when i try to add a partition to the free space it says i'm overlapping (even though I put 16.2GB vs 16.1GB
