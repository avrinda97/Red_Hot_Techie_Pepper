2007-09-19T05:00:00.000Z	Sitherae		Shack: Give me a second.
2007-09-19T05:00:00.000Z	Sitherae		Shack: its "exit"
2007-09-19T05:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	no, that exits the shell.
2007-09-19T05:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	itr does not pop up anything.
2007-09-19T05:01:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	OH.. I see what he wants to know
2007-09-19T05:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	you're wrong.
2007-09-19T05:04:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	Alright, just giving what I think.
2007-09-19T05:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	you think wrong
2007-09-19T05:05:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	...........cocky aren't we?
2007-09-19T05:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	when you press the power quit button on the panel, it pops up a dialog. when it pops up the dialog, it dims the screen and freezes input/output from  the windows that you see.
2007-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	It stops my music also.
2007-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	by freezing input/output, i don't mean literally. i don't mean it blocks a program from reading/writing to a file.
2007-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	Ahh okay. I was close :D
2007-09-19T05:14:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	that's also funny if you know C
2007-09-19T05:14:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	:D
2007-09-19T05:15:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	C++ is a subset of C
2007-09-19T05:15:00.000Z	Sitherae	kbrooks	I know
2007-09-19T05:15:00.000Z	kbrooks	Sitherae	ok
