2007-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	sayanora818181		The 2nd is empty
2007-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	sayanora818181		The 3rd is backup
2007-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	sayanora818181		Yes
2007-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	sayanora818181		Yup
2007-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	sayanora818181		I edit video and audio
2007-11-22T15:43:00.000Z	sayanora818181		Cool, can't
2007-11-22T15:43:00.000Z	sayanora818181		Cool, I can't
2007-11-22T15:43:00.000Z	sayanora818181		But how do I partition that 2nd drive so it has 2 partitions, one for main data and one for swap
2007-11-22T15:45:00.000Z	sayanora818181		No it won;t
2007-11-22T15:45:00.000Z	sayanora818181		I press forward and it gives me an error mesage
2007-11-22T15:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	What error?
2007-11-22T15:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	Have you in fact made a swap partition?
2007-11-22T15:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	I don't know how the installer interface works but I would assume you would resize another partition to make room, or just use Gparted which ( IMHO ) has a better interface
2007-11-22T16:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	The conventional wisdom used to be 2X your RAM, but that is far from neccisary now, I'd go with 1 GIG, but the truth is that you will probably never even touch swap
2007-11-22T16:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	Then you are using 32 bit
2007-11-22T16:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	I'd say 256 Meg- 1 GIG, but it really doesn't matter much.
2007-11-22T16:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	doesn't matter, end, and there is no mount point for swap ( wait, are you still talking about swap ? )
2007-11-22T16:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	Make sure you have chosen a file system rather than swap
2007-11-22T16:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	sayanora818181	Please post a screenshot
