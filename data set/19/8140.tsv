2007-06-04T05:28:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	i didn't ask you to do that, crdlb did
2007-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	read and experiment
2007-06-04T05:40:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	careful, it's xserver-xorg not xserver.xorg
2007-06-04T05:50:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	do you get a grey screen with an 'x' cursor if you type X by itself on the commandline?
2007-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	if the desktop effects need 3D, then no, you cannot.
2007-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	can you play games?
2007-06-04T06:38:00.000Z	Gnea	forever	how goes it?
