2006-04-18T06:44:00.000Z	Der_Richter		Hello. One question... On ubuntu, how do i make the OSS-module autoload... So i don't have to modprobe all the time after a sys restart.
2006-04-18T06:46:00.000Z	Der_Richter		So... /lib/modules/[Kernel-name] / i suppose is the right place? But what do i put there for OSS to load without modprobe?
2006-04-18T06:47:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	the way it works in 2.6 is that if the hardware is there then it should load - if you have to reprobe something else is the issue
2006-04-18T06:48:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	I suppose it may be the fact it loads libALSA instead... So i have to probe OSS when using software only built for using OSS.
2006-04-18T06:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	so it loads that - hmm so install "bum" and turn off any alsa that is starting
2006-04-18T06:51:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	"bum" is software? Never heard of? apt-get?
2006-04-18T06:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	yeh - its boot up manager
2006-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	I'll try it out. Can you load other modules at boot with it as well?
2006-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	its less of a module more of a server stuff thing
2006-04-18T06:54:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	As long as it can kill ALSA-server and load OSS instead i'm happy.
2006-04-18T06:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	you should be okay then
2006-04-18T06:56:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	Nope. ALSA is not active according to bum. Maybe because i have the OSS probed now?
2006-04-18T06:57:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	:-) is it in the list - you can disable it
2006-04-18T06:57:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	The thing is... It IS disabled.
2006-04-18T06:57:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	ooch
2006-04-18T06:58:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	That makes it worse :) Still starts ALSA every reboot.
2006-04-18T06:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	get alsa enabled software :-/
2006-04-18T06:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Der_Richter	I have no more on that for you, hax kernel or some such?
2006-04-18T07:01:00.000Z	Der_Richter	ompaul	Seems i have to recompile the kernel... perhaps with --OSS flags. Damn :)
