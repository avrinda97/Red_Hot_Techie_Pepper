2007-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		[nrx] , it really says on that site that it supports multiple IP addresses, but i can't find any configuration options that would let me configure the IP's
2007-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	hold on
2007-09-19T05:38:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	i would suggest doing some reading for your router
2007-09-19T05:38:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	what router?
2007-09-19T05:39:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	Step 1: Get a decent router

2007-09-19T05:45:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	your router does support multiple IP addresses: http://www.edimax.com.tw/download/manual/BR-6204Wg_M.pdf
2007-09-19T05:45:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	first hit on page 54
2007-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	did you read the link i gave you? starting on page 53.. you should read up on it. It's all about NAT.You may want to read up on NAT on the net, too

2007-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	they never are, unfortunately :/
2007-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	it's definately possible with that router.. you'll just need to read a bit and mess around :)
2007-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	it's definately an issue with NAT then... best to read that link :)
2007-09-24T16:26:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	nothing.. just make sure you have the conf's correct
2007-09-24T16:27:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	to be honest, and i'm not being funny, but if you don't know what the conf's are, you shouldn't be messing around with DNS, let alone rDNS
2007-09-24T16:29:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	read up on.. you need to do more than just edit some confs :)
2007-09-24T16:30:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	that's a very good idea :)
2007-09-24T16:30:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	are you running bind?
2007-09-24T16:32:00.000Z	[nrx] 	EvaLuaTe	it's /etc/named.conf and the correct zone files in /var/named/file.db
