2005-01-30T11:32:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	sudo reboot
2005-01-30T11:36:00.000Z	Skwid_	paradoxmo	nono, i want to restart, but then be in console after I restarted, with no X
2005-01-30T11:37:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	do you want that to be permanent?
2005-01-30T11:37:00.000Z	Skwid_	paradoxmo	no, just once
2005-01-30T11:39:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	do you really need to be in console only? or can you just switch to it ctrl-alt-f1
2005-01-30T11:40:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	no, that gets you into single user mode
2005-01-30T11:40:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	i assume you want multiuser, but without x?
2005-01-30T11:40:00.000Z	Skwid_	paradoxmo	hum ... i just want no X
2005-01-30T11:40:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	what are you trying to do?
2005-01-30T11:41:00.000Z	Skwid_	paradoxmo	lauch project looking glass in session
2005-01-30T11:41:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	okay, what you want to do is logout of your current x session, and then from command line do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2005-01-30T11:41:00.000Z	Skwid_	paradoxmo	and how do i do that ?
2005-01-30T11:42:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	you're in X now, right?
2005-01-30T11:42:00.000Z	Skwid_	paradoxmo	i'm on windows right now :)
2005-01-30T11:42:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Skwid_	basically,
