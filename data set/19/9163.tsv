2006-12-21T16:29:00.000Z	doug_h		and pretty vague
2006-12-21T16:29:00.000Z	mc44	doug_h	and not for discussion here :)
2006-12-21T16:29:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	of course
2006-12-21T16:30:00.000Z	mc44	doug_h	well i think he made his point well :)
2006-12-21T16:30:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	to each his own
2006-12-21T16:31:00.000Z	mc44	doug_h	I meant saying that then running away, but yes indeed
2006-12-21T16:32:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	only way i know of to avoid an argument (or more commonly known as a discussion)
2006-12-21T16:36:00.000Z	mc44	doug_h	i rather doubt it
2006-12-21T16:36:00.000Z	mc44	doug_h	although may I convince you of the relative merits of ubuntu... :p
2006-12-21T16:37:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	i'm not convinced that ubuntu is good nor bad
2006-12-21T16:38:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	i mostly use CentOS on my server and thats about it, i've tried most of the other mainstream distro's and didn't really like any of them but i don't need linux for a desktop so ubuntu doesn't have much at all i'm interested in
2006-12-21T16:40:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	that and i'm mainly here to observe heh

2006-12-21T16:44:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	yes i recorded just under 3k frames using piespy to kind of observe the social activities here
2006-12-21T16:45:00.000Z	mc44	doug_h	any profound conclusions (other than oooh pretty?)
2006-12-21T16:46:00.000Z	doug_h	mc44	well it tells me who is active most, who holds the most concurrent conversations
