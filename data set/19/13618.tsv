2005-04-18T12:03:00.000Z	danko123456		Hi, do you guys like KDE? I mean, does anyone have a reason why that would be needed?
2005-04-18T12:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	some people like it, therefor it should be included
2005-04-18T12:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	ask in #kubuntu if you want to know what a kde user thinks
2005-05-09T16:58:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	pretty good
2005-05-09T05:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	because linux devs are smart and they have cameras as well
2005-05-09T05:06:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	make sure he cleans out his sources too
2005-05-09T05:07:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	HE CAn maybe use the ubuntuguide sources.list?
2005-05-09T05:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	not recommended
2005-05-09T05:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	too many nerim.net repos. You only need one (testing)
2005-05-09T05:08:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	I first used the ones with backports and everything the first time I upgraded.
2005-05-09T05:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	he
2005-05-09T05:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	but my name can be either
2005-05-09T05:31:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	because linux devs are smart and they have cameras as well
2005-06-03T10:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	with w32codecs, totem-xine can play realplayer stuff
2005-06-06T10:03:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	it can not merely be that,..
2005-06-06T10:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	it is
2005-06-06T10:04:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	cause, kde uses kapps, and gnome uses gapps,. they are all different apps...
2005-06-06T10:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	danko123456	the repos are the same, the packages are the same, the developers are the same
2005-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	danko123456	Burgundavia	taht was kinda funny,. too, I didnt expect it...
