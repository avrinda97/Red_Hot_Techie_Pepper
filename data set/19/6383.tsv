2008-03-22T20:12:00.000Z	Nameless_one		hello, I am trying to use aptitude's search function but not everything seems to work as written on the manual, unless I am doing something wrong
2008-03-22T20:13:00.000Z	Nameless_one		I am trying to search for packages that anjuta depends on and aren't installed, so I probably have to use the  terms ~Rdepends: and !~i. I can't find a way to search for packages that match both
2008-03-22T20:13:00.000Z	Nameless_one		can anyone help?
2008-03-22T20:13:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	whats not behabing as it should?
2008-03-22T20:13:00.000Z	Nameless_one	unop_	PM?
2008-03-22T20:14:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	better in here -- other people can help and learn
2008-03-22T20:15:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	search term1 term2 will match either term1 or term2 -- if you want to match both -- you need to use a regular expression -- aptitude search "term1.*term2"
2008-03-22T20:16:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	give me an example of what you are trying so far?
2008-03-22T20:17:00.000Z	Nameless_one	unop_	I can't because the terms aren't string patterns, they are aptitude's search terms which match packages relating to their state, eg, ~Rdepends:anjuta returns all packages that anjuta depends on
2008-03-22T20:18:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	you there?
2008-03-22T20:19:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	i think i might have -- yes, i got disconned
2008-03-22T20:19:00.000Z	Nameless_one	unop_	I can't because the terms aren't string patterns, they are aptitude's search terms which match packages relating to their state, eg, ~Rdepends:anjuta returns all packages that anjuta depends on
2008-03-22T20:19:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	can you repeat please? :)
2008-03-22T20:21:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	i guess you might need to use pipe and grep then -- aptitude search .. | grep blah
2008-03-22T20:22:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	 aptitude search ... | grep -iE "p\t"   perhaps??
2008-03-22T20:23:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	that is if you meant <tab> as in whitespace
2008-03-22T20:23:00.000Z	Nameless_one	unop_	yeah, that's what I though, thanks. I actually want to learn how to do it with aptitude to have more control over my system. The people at #debian sent me away :-S
2008-03-22T20:24:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	if you've caught this easter-egg in aptitude it says "this version of aptitude does not have super cow powers" .. if you get me? :)
2008-03-22T20:25:00.000Z	unop_	Nameless_one	sometimes, it's not possible for an app to do everything, sometimes it's easier if you use a variety of tools to get the job done,,.
