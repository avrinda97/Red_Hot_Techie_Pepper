2008-08-28T00:12:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	what filesystem on this volume?
2008-08-28T00:12:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	ext3
2008-08-28T00:13:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	you have to give yourself permissions on the volume then
2008-08-28T00:13:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	could you show me how
2008-08-28T00:14:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	did you say this was an arch volume?  does that mean a filesystem used by arch linux?
2008-08-28T00:14:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	yes
2008-08-28T00:15:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	do you still use arch linux?
2008-08-28T00:15:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	yes
2008-08-28T00:15:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	hmm .. this is going to be tricky
2008-08-28T00:15:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	im still experimenting it (or should i say learning)
2008-08-28T00:16:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	we can set its <options> to relatime    and not neccessariliy   relatime,errors=remount-ro
2008-08-28T00:17:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	that still doesn't address the fact that you don't have permissions over the volume -- and if you change permissions you upset your arch install
2008-08-28T00:18:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	I think the best thing to do is give yourself permissions via ACLs rather than change unix permissions
2008-08-28T00:18:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	plz, elaborate
2008-08-28T00:19:00.000Z	unop	DEViUS	hold on, i'm looking for a good howto for you
2008-08-28T00:19:00.000Z	DEViUS	unop	tyt
