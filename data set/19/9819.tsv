2006-09-11T09:56:00.000Z	Caplain		is there an ntfs to ext3 converter?
2006-09-11T09:57:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	The answer to the question is no. Not like there is from FAT32 to NTFS.
2006-09-11T09:58:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	If you wanted to move from an NTFS partition to an ext3 partition, you would have to backup your data on another partition, change your NTFS partition to ext3 (all data will be lost), then restore your backup
2006-09-11T09:59:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	You could always be evil and buy one from whatever store, use it, wipe it, return it. :P
2006-09-11T10:01:00.000Z	Caplain	wweasel	what do they run at pricewise?
2006-09-11T10:01:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	No idea.
2006-09-11T10:01:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	you are using a full 250 gigs on your NTFS partition
2006-09-11T10:02:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	And please tell me you have some way of backing up your data... :P
2006-09-11T10:04:00.000Z	Caplain	wweasel	i just converted to linux
2006-09-11T10:05:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	I understand. I had 2 questions. Do you use the entire 250 GB, or is there some free space? And, do you backup your data ever?
2006-09-11T10:06:00.000Z	Caplain	wweasel	 i have two drives that equal 250GB and i dont have anything to back my data up to
2006-09-11T10:07:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	Sounds like it would be a good investment then. You never know when the demons known as hard drive failure will strike.
2006-09-11T10:07:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	But that's for the future. For the moment, you need some way of converting NTFS to ext3?
2006-09-11T10:07:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	I'd imagine that's because you want read/write access in Linux...read isn't gonna cut it, right?
2006-09-11T10:08:00.000Z	Caplain	wweasel	correct
2006-09-11T10:08:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	Well, until you have somewhere to backup your data and change the partition type, I recommend you check out read/write in ntfs
2006-09-11T10:09:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	Rather, in linux.
2006-09-11T10:09:00.000Z	Caplain	wweasel	is it safe?
2006-09-11T10:10:00.000Z	wweasel	Caplain	Well, not fully. It's not stable yet. It is pretty good, many people use it. But there are always warnings and disclaimers
