2007-03-28T06:53:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	i mean BEFORE
2007-03-28T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	not if you backup your /home or have it in a seperate partition
2007-03-28T06:51:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	what is the best way to back it up?
2007-03-28T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	doesn't really matter, any backup will do
2007-03-28T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	you'll just restore it after the new install
2007-03-28T06:53:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	can i save it as a different folder in the  root file system
2007-03-28T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	you mean after restoring the bacup?
2007-03-28T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	no, that will get wiped if you install ubuntu that partition
2007-03-28T06:54:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	so ubuntu doesn't care for the files existing in a partition, it will erase everything
2007-03-28T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	yes afaik
2007-03-28T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	if you have space on the drive you could move your /home to another partition
2007-03-28T06:56:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	the problem is that i don't
2007-03-28T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	why do you want to reinstall?
2007-03-28T06:57:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	and i cannot access /etc/sudoers anymore
2007-03-28T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	heh, yes that is a good reason.  How big is your /home
2007-03-28T06:57:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	so i cannot ran sudo anymore
2007-03-28T06:57:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	9 JB
2007-03-28T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	ticki	well two dvd's could take care of that if you have a dvd burner
2007-03-28T06:59:00.000Z	ticki	jrib	i think i will do that.
