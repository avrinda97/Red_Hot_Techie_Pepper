2008-11-28T09:59:00.000Z	mikematis	doors98	I think yu set it when you set up the shared folder.
2008-11-28T10:02:00.000Z	mikematis	doors98	you should also be able to get to it from your windows box with \\ipofubuntubox\sharename typed into the address bar of any explorer window

2008-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	mikematis	doors98	Stay on 8.04. Not that much different from 8.10.  Its System > Applications > Network
2008-11-28T10:21:00.000Z	doors98	mikematis	or nt8user: then after im inside network admin, how will i set my workgroup on ububtu?
2008-11-28T10:25:00.000Z	mikematis	doors98	 type "sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf" this will open a text editor so you can edit the samba config, where the workgroup setting is (Samba is a thing that lets linux and windows machines "talk" to eachother)
