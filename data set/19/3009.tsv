2009-11-08T00:38:00.000Z	rainbow007		hi guys, i'm novice user. and i want to know how i can see the options on login screen, where i can select either kde or gnome desktop. i got ubuntu v.9.10 running
2009-11-08T00:40:00.000Z	rainbow007		hi doorman 352, i have converted gnome to kde-desktop from the installation package found in synaptic
2009-11-08T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	first you need to have them installed, then you just pretty much select it I think
2009-11-08T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	tell it which one to use and log in on it
2009-11-08T00:43:00.000Z	rainbow007	sebsebseb	i don't see the options on login screen to choose, which is missing for some reason. all i can see on login screen is username and then password
2009-11-08T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	clean install or upgrade?
2009-11-08T00:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	I don't want to go on that link right now, but all you need to do to get KDE  is this  sudo apt-get or apttitude  install  kubuntu-desktop
2009-11-08T00:56:00.000Z	rainbow007	sebsebseb	i have done exactly what you have mentione
2009-11-08T00:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	ok so you got KDM then?  nice blue log in screen yes?
2009-11-08T00:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	re installing the old Grub onto the MBR,  is a bit of a pain,  I am not sure how to do that,  I assume though that re installing Grub 2 will be similar, by the way they have a channel #grub
2009-11-08T00:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	well GDM 2 is a bit sucky really I guess
2009-11-08T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	and not just, becasue it can't be themed like the old one
2009-11-08T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	I suggest joining #grub and asking there
2009-11-08T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	oh wrong one ah
2009-11-08T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	KDM used to suck in my opinion, but I like this new one,  more so than the  new GDM 2.
2009-11-08T01:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	You can ask for help in #kubuntu as well
2009-11-08T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	GDM 2 sucks
2009-11-08T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	and since you want to be going Kubuntu you should be using KDM really
2009-11-08T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rainbow007	however you should also be able to boot into KDE from  GDM 2
