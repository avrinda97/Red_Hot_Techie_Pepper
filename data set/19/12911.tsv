2007-08-24T07:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	sh scripting is enough imho
2008-06-16T18:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	gambas is VB like programming enmvoirment for linux
2008-06-16T19:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	it is a migration path for the millions VB6 programmers users
2008-11-21T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	user01 move openbsd chatter to offtopic or an openbsd chat room; please
2010-02-05T03:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	the former
2010-05-03T22:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	we do not do anything ...
2010-05-03T22:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	this is support channel not a ranting one
2010-05-03T22:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	just make a bug report.

2010-10-11T18:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	cron sends mail to root with output of tasks afaik.
2010-10-11T19:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	if you do not have a mta in your system you wont get them
2010-10-11T19:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	make the up writte to a log file. redirect the output to /tmp/app.log for instance
2010-10-11T19:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	yes; you have to export DISPLAY at least for an X app to work from cron
2010-10-11T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	cron is not really designed to run gui apps
2010-10-11T19:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	have you tried with gnome-schedule? it has wrapper  to run gui apps via cron ...
2010-10-11T19:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	DISPLAY=:1 should be enough
2010-10-11T19:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	in fact giving an ip may force X to use less efficient methods to display the app
2010-10-11T19:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	sudobash	run the app like this « myapp 2> /dev/null » so cron does not see anything of that
