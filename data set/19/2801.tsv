2010-05-09T01:16:00.000Z	sky1		I'm dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04, and I have some data hard drives. Should they be ext4 or NTFS? I assume NTFS would be preferred since it has the best cross compatibility with windows and ubuntu? (Windows having no ext4 support really)
2010-05-09T01:18:00.000Z	patdk-wk	sky1	ntfs is ok, but if you don't shutdown windows cleanly, then the ntfs driver in ubuntu will refuse to use them
2010-05-09T01:18:00.000Z	patdk-wk		so fat32 *might* be a better solution
2010-05-09T01:19:00.000Z	sky1		fat32 is not a very good solution for 1+TB drives I do not think :P
2010-05-09T01:19:00.000Z	patdk-wk		why I said *might*
2010-05-09T01:20:00.000Z	sky1	patdk-wk	 of course lol. Yeah I think NTFS is probably best as long as I shutdown nicely, but sadly it's going to be a pain to backup 2TB of data to format the drive from ext4. But as of right now its impossible to read/write from windows on them, which I think I'd rather be able to, even if ubuntu is going to the main OS
2010-05-09T01:21:00.000Z	patdk-wk	sky1	how much free space on the drive?
2010-05-09T01:21:00.000Z	sky1		I tried ext2fsd. I was able to get a listing of the root of the drive, but that was it, and I tried opening some files and the drive ended up getting corrupted :/ (and the files were gibberish). LUCILY fsck was able to fix the errors though (thank god lol)
2010-05-09T01:22:00.000Z	patdk-wk	sky1	sounds like you have ext4 with extents
2010-05-09T01:22:00.000Z	patdk-wk		that is not ext2 compat :)
2010-05-09T01:22:00.000Z	sky1		the 1.5TB drive has about 800GB free, and the 1TB drive has  160GB free. Yeah that's what I figured patdk-wk, I'm surprised there isn't better support though. It is the 'oh so godly' windows :P
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	patdk-wk		heh? better support?
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	patdk-wk		ext4 is compat with ext2 and ext3
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	patdk-wk		and you can upgrade any to ext4
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	patdk-wk		but the new stuff in ext4 you can't upgrade to
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	patdk-wk		and if you use the new stuff in ext4, it's not backwards compat
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	sky1		haha well considering the user-base you'd think a good ext4 reader would exist for Windows considering how awesome NTSF support has gotten for linux
2010-05-09T01:23:00.000Z	patdk-wk		well, techincally ext3 isn't backwards compat with ext2, but
2010-05-09T01:24:00.000Z	patdk-wk	sky1	personally, I never dualboot
