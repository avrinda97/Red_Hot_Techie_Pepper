2010-11-23T09:25:00.000Z	violet		Hi everyone.
2010-11-23T09:25:00.000Z	violet		I'm having trouble installing Maverick Netbook on an Eee PC.
2010-11-23T09:26:00.000Z	violet		Hi, edbian.
2010-11-23T09:26:00.000Z	violet		Specifically, the forward button is greyed out on the "Who Are You" page.
2010-11-23T09:27:00.000Z	violet		Yes. :-p
2010-11-23T09:27:00.000Z	violet		It's all filled out.
2010-11-23T09:27:00.000Z	violet		And the progress bar is telling me that it's ready when I am.
2010-11-23T09:28:00.000Z	violet		I filled out my name, the computer's name, my user name. I picked a good password, and there's a green checkmark by the pw confirmation box, indicating a match.
2010-11-23T09:30:00.000Z	Tweedle	violet	are you having problems with root password?
2010-11-23T09:30:00.000Z	violet		My name: Becky / My computer's name: Ada / Pick a username: Becky
2010-11-23T09:30:00.000Z	Tweedle		stuck how?
2010-11-23T09:30:00.000Z	violet		Didn't change anything.
2010-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	Tweedle	violet	how are you stuck?
2010-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	violet	Yeah	all lowercase fixed it.
2010-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	violet		Yeah.
2010-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	violet		The installer should almost certainly warn about that. :-P
2010-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	violet		(So where can I file a bug?)
2010-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	violet		Thanks!
2010-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	Tweedle	violet	DO NOT USE ANY CAPITAL LETTERS
