2006-10-21T13:52:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		hm, i figured when you produce a flash file in linux it would be identical to the file produced by a windows flash, mac and windows have that in common
2006-10-21T13:52:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		flash always banks on working perfectly cross platform
2006-10-21T13:53:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		ah right, got it
2006-10-21T13:53:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		hm, maybe i should find a cheap second pc to try it out on first before putting it on my main machine
2006-10-21T13:54:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		nope, i'm gathering as much info as i can before doing anything
2006-10-21T13:54:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		what is the live cd exactly?
2006-10-21T13:55:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		i know i should look this stuff up, there's just so much ubuntu info i'm trying to read everything at once
2006-10-21T13:55:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		ah, i'll check that one out, seems convenient
2006-10-21T13:56:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		thanks guys, i'll do some reading and try the live cd
2006-10-21T13:56:00.000Z	Snottlebocket		cable, through a router
2006-10-21T13:56:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	with a password, or are you connected once you plug the cable?
2006-10-21T13:49:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	almost. sometimes even more. :)
2006-10-21T13:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	wine is a compatibility layer for Linux. Lets you run windows programs in Linux.
2006-10-21T13:56:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	what kind of internet connection do you have?
2006-10-21T13:58:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	right. Try out the live cd. I think you'll like it. There are irc clients available and you shouldn't have any difficulties connecting.
2006-10-21T14:08:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	the Gimp is really cool.
2006-10-21T14:08:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	just boot from live cd, install wine and install your Flash Studio or whatever it is called.
2006-10-21T14:09:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	keep in mind that the system will be much slower because you're running from the cd.
2006-10-21T14:10:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Snottlebocket	glad to hear it. :)
