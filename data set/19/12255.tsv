2005-11-23T17:58:00.000Z	_jason		Hi when I startx, I get: "Could not init font path element unix/:7100, removing from list!
2005-11-23T17:58:00.000Z	_jason		" what does this mean?
2005-11-23T17:58:00.000Z	cafuego	_jason	it means the font server isn't running. This is not an error, just ignore it.

2006-02-19T09:26:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	ah thankyou
2006-03-04T06:07:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	are these online somewhere?
2006-03-04T06:08:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	never mind, thought you were talking about irc channel logs
2006-03-04T06:08:00.000Z	cafuego	_jason	Ew, no ;-)
2006-03-04T06:30:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	should have just done passwd ` getent passwd 1000 | awk -F: '{print $1}'`, ;)
2006-04-17T10:11:00.000Z	cafuego	_jason	bugger all, i dunno
2006-04-18T11:47:00.000Z	cafuego	_jason	Having a conversation with it helps ;-)
2006-04-30T07:10:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	when I ask ubotu to define eft, it takes him like 10 minutes, other words seem instant (or so it was a couple of days ago)
2006-04-30T07:10:00.000Z	cafuego	_jason	Depends on how fast the dictionary server is, eh?
2006-04-30T07:11:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	ah I see
2006-04-30T07:30:00.000Z	_jason	cafuego	he did it a few minutes ago too, came back after a minute
