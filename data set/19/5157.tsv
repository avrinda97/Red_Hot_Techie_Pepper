2009-04-29T17:35:00.000Z	raddy		Hello Everybody
2009-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	raddy		SSH is very slow in Ubuntu
2009-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	raddy		What could be the reason?
2009-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	are you using compiz?
2009-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	Yeahhhh
2009-04-29T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	join #compiz  its known to get weird like that
2009-04-29T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	in fact, compiz breaks a lot of stuff
2009-04-29T17:38:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	SSH slowness is not because of compiz. it takes lot of time to connect to a server over ssh
2009-04-29T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	ahh im mixing you up
2009-04-29T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	its due to name resolve to ip
2009-04-29T17:38:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	Also Nautilus times out connecting to SSH
2009-04-29T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	if you add an entry for your ssh client pc in /etc/hosts it will be way faster
2009-04-29T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	you add it in the ssh servers /etc/hosts
2009-04-29T17:39:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	Seems i have to disable IPv6
2009-04-29T17:39:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	Can you tell me how to disable IPv6?
2009-04-29T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	no idea man
2009-04-29T17:40:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	It takes lot of time to connect to any server
2009-04-29T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raddy	if you add the resolv in hosts it will resolv instantly to an ipv4 address
2009-04-29T17:41:00.000Z	raddy	ActionParsnip1	I'll try
