2006-12-11T11:58:00.000Z	ubox		Barrl:how is apt coming
2006-12-11T11:59:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	I haven't tried apt directly, just the GUI.
2006-12-11T11:59:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	I'm merely a penguinista in training, and don't know yet what to do in case of failures...
2006-12-11T12:02:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	That listed a bunch of Ign lines, a few Get lines, and a bunch of Hit lines. Fetched 3B in 3S, and then Reading package lists... Done. However, Software Updates is still just spinning with no changes.
2006-12-11T12:05:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	There are currently 25 updates available, including the gnupg security update. It's not so much that there's something specific I'm looking for, as I'd like to get the automatic software updater working again.
2006-12-11T12:15:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	Have I lost you? :-9
2006-12-11T12:18:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	Those would be a good start, but I'd rather have the GUI tool working properly.
2006-12-11T12:20:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	No. There is an orange star-like icon in my, uh, system-tray-like place (near my clock) that indicates updates are available. The Software Updates window opens when I click that.
2006-12-11T12:22:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	I hover over it and it says "There are 25 updates available". I click it and the window is titled Software Updates.
2006-12-11T12:25:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	Depends on how you define "need." There are non-security updates provided by this tool, too. At the moment, there are some for gimp and for some games that are not coming down.
2006-12-11T12:28:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	I could try, if I knew what it was called either... :-( It's functionality that is instaleld automatically with Ubuntu. My Hoary install had it as well.
2006-12-11T12:31:00.000Z	Barr1	ubox	I would have to know the name of the package to upgrade. This tool, when it works, does that automatically.
