2009-04-08T11:24:00.000Z	Aloe		hi everybody
2009-04-08T11:26:00.000Z	Aloe		I tried to write a if condition where one string is compared to two other string with the operator "eq" and "and" but it doesnt seem to work. Does anybody knows another way of writting it?
2009-04-08T11:27:00.000Z	raylu	Aloe	show us the actual script?
2009-04-08T11:29:00.000Z	raylu	Aloe	i think you want [ instead of ( and -eq instead of eq and "&&" instead of "and"
2009-04-08T11:30:00.000Z	raylu	Aloe	wait, that seriously worked?
2009-04-08T11:34:00.000Z	raylu	Aloe	oh.............

2009-04-08T11:41:00.000Z	raylu	Aloe	try == instead of eq
2009-04-08T11:41:00.000Z	raylu	Aloe	also, you need a space between OUTFILE and "
2009-04-08T11:43:00.000Z	Aloe	raylu	== only works for numbers
