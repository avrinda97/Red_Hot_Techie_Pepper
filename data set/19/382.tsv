2012-05-22T14:41:00.000Z	Talisman`Work		is there any way to easily rollback an upgrade? i.e. I want to go back to 11.10 - I'm finding that 12.04 is broken for a number of my packages.
2012-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	Talisman`Work		OK, great.  then... if I reinstall 11.10 will it reinitialise my partitions?
2012-05-22T14:44:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	part of the 11.10 install is to setup partitions so you can just mark the existing partitions for formatting and to be used for the same role, or you can wipe them out and repartition. Be sure you backup everything you need
2012-05-22T14:45:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	can it be marked to not initialise the partition?
2012-05-22T14:46:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	sure you can partition and not set a mount point, you can even set it to not format the partition but use it as a mount opint, retaining the data
2012-05-22T14:46:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	that sounds more like what I want... thanks.
2012-05-22T14:47:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	just read the screen and you'll be ok. If al else fails you can use your backups
2012-05-22T14:47:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	rofl.  yeh.. I'll cp my data to my portable tonight.
2012-05-22T14:48:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	you'll need to mark the partition for / to be formatted
2012-05-22T14:48:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	I suggest you do it more regularly
2012-05-22T14:49:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	I'm not to worried about it.  but thanks for the concern - you and Abhijit both :-)
2012-05-22T14:49:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	Abhijit : thanks for your assistance - much appreciated :-)
2012-05-22T14:51:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	install ubuntu minimal then install fluxbox
2012-05-22T14:51:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	I may just do that.
2012-05-22T14:52:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	there used to be fluxbuntu too (unofficial of course)
2012-05-22T14:52:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	minimal + fluxbox + slim = about 1.3Gb installed :)
2012-05-22T14:53:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	ActionPa1snip	:-D  I've been using fluxbox on gentoo for about 7 years now - from the 2004.1 release.  never looked back...
2012-05-22T14:54:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Talisman`Work	I'm an lxde kinda guy :). Fluxbox is badass though
