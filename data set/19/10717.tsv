2006-05-24T15:10:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	ok, I see your problem, let me look for a fix

2006-05-24T15:12:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	have you tried building a newer version of the module from source?
2006-05-24T15:14:00.000Z	jhv	DBO	i dont now what that means. ive ran all updates on ubuntu. du mean update the ipw2200 driver?
2006-05-24T15:15:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	I mean download the source from sourceforge and compile it yourself =)
2006-05-24T15:16:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	on a scale from 1 to 10 on linux guruishness (not word).  10 being Linus Torvalds and 1 being Bill Gates, where do you fall?
2006-05-24T15:17:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	do you think you can handle getting the source for your driver from sourceforge and trying to compile it?
2006-05-24T15:18:00.000Z	jhv	DBO	yes, its pretty straight forward, i simply follow the readme, but it hasnt worked up til now, but ill try
2006-05-24T15:19:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	just dont do the make install part until you talk to us again =)
2006-05-24T15:26:00.000Z	jhv	DBO	do i need to update firmware?
2006-05-24T15:27:00.000Z	DBO	jhv	no, just the module me thinks, did you get it to compile?  (dont do the make install step yet please)
2006-05-24T15:28:00.000Z	jhv	DBO	no, ive just downloaded this http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/#downloads and i am now reading what to do
