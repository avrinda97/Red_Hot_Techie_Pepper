2007-10-21T17:38:00.000Z	beni	h4writer	tell me if it worked buddy
2007-10-21T17:51:00.000Z	h4writer	beni	yeah it worked. I had to do  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure portmap"  and let portmap not to bind to the loopback address? And now it works with 'sudo mount computername.local:/name/to/dir /name/to/mount'
