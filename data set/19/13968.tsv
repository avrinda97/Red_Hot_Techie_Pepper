2004-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	no
2004-11-29T13:36:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	ask your question, silly =] 
2004-11-29T13:37:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	that I'd like too see... =] 
2004-11-29T13:38:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	to be honest, it's been a long time since I've used my palmpilot - and then I only used it to sync with Evolution... now I don't remember at all
2004-11-29T13:39:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	gloin_	It's not a showstopper ... just figured someone, somewhere, has worked this one out already ...
2004-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	IIRC, you've got to set jpilot to the correct USB TTY
2004-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	try this: ls -l /dev/input/mice
2004-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	gloin_	- need root terminal for this?
2004-11-29T13:42:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	that's interesting - do you have a USB mouse?
2004-11-29T13:44:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	see if you can reconfigure jpilot so that, say if now it's using /dev/somethingUSB0, change the 0 to a 1
2004-11-29T13:52:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	there is a 1.x version in hoary (testing) version
2004-11-29T13:57:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	gloin_	- do I need to *create* /dev/ttyusb0 and/or /dev/ttyusb1? I see a MAKEDEV shell script ...
2004-11-29T13:58:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	you shouldn't need to make those devices... I'm really curious as to how your mouse is being seen the way it is
2004-11-29T13:59:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	that is odd.. I have no clue, honestly
2004-11-29T14:08:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	gloin_	- just to check my guesses - should I be able to see /dev/ttyusb-something devices in /dev?
2004-11-29T14:08:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	that's what I'd expect to see...
2004-11-29T14:38:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	gloin_	Just wanted to say I think I've got it working (the Palm sync) ...
2004-11-29T14:39:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	what was the trick for it?
2004-11-29T14:40:00.000Z	gloin_	UbuntuNewbie	if it makes you feel any better, I get to do battle with my iPod when I get vid drivers stabilized
