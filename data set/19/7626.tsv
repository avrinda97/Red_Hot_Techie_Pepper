2008-09-14T09:49:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	that's an interesting question, how do you determine if a process is using a hardware device? Where do you search, in /proc or maybe with ps?
2008-09-14T09:49:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	lsof | grep libasound
2008-09-14T09:51:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	list open files, good one, I had forgotten abut this command.
2008-09-14T09:51:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	it's a lifesaver ;)
2008-09-14T09:51:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	which search /proc as essentially I was suggesting, but in a better way.
2008-09-14T09:56:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	/msg nickserv help
2008-09-14T09:57:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	real men don't register their nick!
2008-09-14T09:57:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	lol
2009-08-31T04:18:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	he didn't spam.
2009-08-31T04:18:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	that was one line, not several. pay attention.
2009-08-31T04:19:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	sukuri I don't mean spam literally, more like "a bit too much post"...
2009-08-31T04:20:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	okay, when it's more than 2 lines in a row, it's considered spam. if it's just one or two lines at a time, like _jay_ was doing, it's NOT spam. got it?
2009-08-31T04:21:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	posted text seemed like output from the terminal. Unexperienced users routinely post a lot of that text. I was just being overly cautious.
2009-08-31T04:22:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	thanks, but there's no need, since it's unwise to give people the incorrect idea.
2009-08-31T04:24:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	not always.
2009-08-31T04:33:00.000Z	vocx	Gnea	ha, you said pictures didn't work...
2009-08-31T04:33:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	not 'always'
2009-08-31T04:33:00.000Z	Gnea	vocx	careful...
