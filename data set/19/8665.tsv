2007-02-27T09:40:00.000Z	twob		Is there a way to make all X fonts (file, edit, xterm, etc) larger?  Either in xorg, a .xsession variable or something else?  I'm looking for something outside of a window manager realm.

2007-02-27T09:41:00.000Z	twob	pinchmesh	it's on an hdtv for a media box, so I need to keep the resolution up higher.
2007-02-27T09:41:00.000Z	pinchmesh		it's under system -> preferences
2007-02-27T09:42:00.000Z	pinchmesh		i unno about hdtv

2007-02-27T09:42:00.000Z	pinchmesh		but, you can try
2007-02-27T09:42:00.000Z	twob	pinchmesh	which tool system->preferences?  Or is that a xorg compile option?

2007-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	pinchmesh		ah, then maybe in rc
2007-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	twob		system->preferences only adjusts gnome/kde font sizes, not X font sizes...
2007-02-27T09:43:00.000Z	pinchmesh		it's under /etc, i think
2007-02-27T09:44:00.000Z	twob	pinchmesh	rc?
2007-02-27T09:44:00.000Z	pinchmesh		x fonts are in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-02-27T09:45:00.000Z	pinchmesh		rc is the system wide resource control settings
2007-02-27T09:45:00.000Z	pinchmesh		sec
