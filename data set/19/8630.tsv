2007-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	Andy50		so I reloaded one of my computers from CentOS to ubuntu, everything went fine, but I have a couple of extra HD in there and can't get them to mount
2007-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	Andy50		any ideas?
2007-03-03T13:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 and... you couldnt mount them manually?
2007-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 edit the fstab to mount them correctly ? or are you talking about a deeper prob lem?
2007-03-03T13:01:00.000Z	Andy50	Dr_willis	: well first I just wanted to mount them using the mount command and check what is on the drive then I would edit fstab to make the mount perm
2007-03-03T13:02:00.000Z	Andy50	Dr_willis	: no, it says unrecognized file sys
2007-03-03T13:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 now we are getting to the 'actual' problem....
2007-03-03T13:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 they may bee reiserfs, or somthing else..  could fire up gparted and see what it says they are.. or use 'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	Andy50	Dr_willis	what repo is gparted in ?
2007-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 'main' it seems
2007-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	Andy50	Dr_willis	did you check my paste ?
2007-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 if you are using LVM - then i got no clue. i dont bother with LVM at all.
2007-03-03T13:09:00.000Z	Andy50	Dr_willis	gparted shows filesystem unknown for all my drives
2007-03-03T13:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 so they are all for lvm?
2007-03-03T13:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 you are on ya own then. :) ive never used lvm at all.. never saw the need for it.
2007-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 you need an identd server for some reason? those things are normally not needed any more.
2007-09-23T10:47:00.000Z	Andy50	Dr_willis	yes I need identd
2007-09-23T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 dare we ask why. :) thers dozens of the services you can install , also thers a identd written in perl (like 4 lines of code) that ive used in the past.
2007-09-23T10:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Andy50	 all of them should work. :) otherwise.. whats the point of them
