2006-04-27T06:59:00.000Z	Warbo	gtrplr	Mine is PCI. And I searched eBay specifically for "wifi pci linux"
2006-04-27T07:00:00.000Z	gtrplr	Warbo	I have even install ndis sources, re-made them, reinstalled wireless tools

2006-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	Warbo	gtrplr	With what?
2006-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	Warbo	gtrplr	If I don't use my CD I get "Operating System Not Found" (I am using USB everything)

2006-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	gtrplr	Warbo	dual boot ?
2006-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	Warbo	gtrplr	No. My BIOS doesn't understand USB and my only IDE is Floppy and CDROM
