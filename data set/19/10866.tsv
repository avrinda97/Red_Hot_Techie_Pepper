2006-05-01T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	"designed for" is microsoft propaganda.  there is no such thing
2006-05-01T12:38:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	you can buy a tag maker
2006-05-01T12:38:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	why would they do that?  they make no profit if you use linux or bsd
2006-05-01T12:38:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	they sell you windows and mark it up
2006-05-01T12:39:00.000Z	cliche	sethk	hahaha, nice oke

2006-05-01T12:39:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	they are running a business.  their purpose is to sell you stuff for more than they have to pay for it
2006-05-01T12:40:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	they aren't going to put a tag on their box that says "please, pay us less"
2006-05-01T12:40:00.000Z	cliche	sethk	even they sole you the sh*t?

2006-05-01T12:43:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	I've been working in seattle lately, in a building where Paul Allen has his office.  Two blocks from there are a dozen homeless shelters.  People begging for food, lining up for blocks for free meals.
2006-05-01T12:43:00.000Z	sethk	cliche	they could feed all these people and never even feel it.  they don't
