2009-01-05T02:26:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Are you aware of the problems with Broadcom cards?
2009-01-05T02:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	Yes
2009-01-05T02:26:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Where are native linux drivers????
2009-01-05T02:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	b43, they come with Ubuntu, they just need firmware ( which broadcom refuses to allow Ubuntu to distribute ) to work
2009-01-05T02:31:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Where do I find the supposed firmware???
2009-01-05T02:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	You can get it by installing the package b43-fwcutter, or I have an archive of them on my web page ( and they are in various other places on the web )
2009-01-05T02:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	I am using a BCM4318 card with Intrepid right now
2009-01-05T02:34:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Ok. I am just wondering. I don't own the crappy chipset my buddy does. Where did you find the firmware. I know the b43 driver is there but the firmware isn't
2009-01-05T02:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	You can install the b43-fwcutter package which will grab the firmware from the internet
2009-01-05T02:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	Mejborg That will only work if you are connected to the internet
2009-01-05T02:37:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	There is a slight possibility but it doesn't rely on much that seems to be changed
2009-01-05T02:38:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	I'm guessing that he is using a wired connection
2009-01-05T02:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	He said earlier that he can't
2009-01-05T02:42:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Thank you for helping Mejborg out!
2009-01-05T02:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	np :)
2009-01-05T02:46:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Can you pm me the link where you are putting the firmware?
2009-01-05T02:47:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	NM
2009-01-05T02:47:00.000Z	HacKBoX	Jordan_U	Thank You, Sir!
2009-01-05T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	HacKBoX	np
