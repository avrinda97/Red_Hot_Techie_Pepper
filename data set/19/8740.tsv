2007-02-16T12:07:00.000Z	Savant2k6		so... im thinking about replacing my OS from WinXP SP2 to Ubuntu, but ive got 2 important questions left, that are to be answered before i dare to ^^
2007-02-16T12:07:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	ask away...
2007-02-16T12:08:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	not saying we'll be able to answer.. but your chances improve drasticly by asking =)
2007-02-16T12:09:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	ouch.. I haven't tried using wireless on my ubuntu machine yet.. try searching for the name of your wireless equipment +ubuntu on google.. see if anytihng shows up
2007-02-16T12:13:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	wow is possibly the most supported windows game using wine
2007-02-16T12:15:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	look here for specifics  http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=1922
2007-02-16T12:20:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	I also have an audigy + on board sound.. I use both.. one for speakers (music etc), one for a headset for gaming and such'
2007-02-16T12:22:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	I think the opposite
2007-02-16T12:23:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	plus many on board sound chips lack hardware mixing .. so you end up doing it in software
2007-02-16T12:24:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	yes.. the sudigy drivers are good.. at least I haven't had problems with them.. no thanks to creative though
2007-02-16T12:35:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	 there are some issues with 64 bit.. flash for example
2007-02-16T12:36:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	so I'd stick with 32 bit for now.. you won't miss 64 bit
2007-02-16T12:39:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	you've been warned..  =)
2007-02-16T12:40:00.000Z	Savant2k6	Slart	well, if my usb-wlan stick thingie doesnt work, ill get me a bridge... who cares damnit. ebay has it all ^^
2007-02-16T12:41:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	hehe.. throw money at the problem..  =)
2007-02-16T12:42:00.000Z	Slart	Savant2k6	hehe.. never thought about it that way.. but sure.. you've got a couple of hundred dollars to spend =)
