2008-05-08T18:35:00.000Z	micooooo	soundray	it didn't work. it says "Starting Up". and then there's a message in gibberish...
2008-05-08T18:36:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	this time it didn't go back to the grub menu?
2008-05-08T18:38:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	do you have an option in your BIOS to select the boot priority separately for your two hard disk drives?
2008-05-08T18:39:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	try both. If grub fails to come up on one, it may be worth trying to leave it at that setting and reinstalling grub using the RecoveringUbuntu... procedure in the factoid:
2008-05-08T18:42:00.000Z	micooooo	soundray	can i access files on the windows's partition from the ubuntu?
2008-05-08T18:42:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	yes, Ubuntu reads NTFS filesystems
2008-05-08T18:52:00.000Z	micooooo	soundray	i'm trying to mount that windows partition. http://paste.ubuntu.com/10915/
2008-05-08T18:53:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	could be. This sounds like bad news, to be honest
2008-05-08T18:53:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	no, grub ignores that flag
2008-05-08T18:54:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	I mean, it doesn't matter
2008-05-08T18:54:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	just leave it as it is, in case you go back to a standard DOS MBR at some point
2008-05-08T18:56:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	on the assumption that tovare is right, you could revert to a DOS MBR (just use any DOS-based rescue CD) and see if that lets Windows boot
2008-05-08T18:58:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	on the world wide web
2008-05-08T19:00:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	do you know how to search it? There is a great service called "Google" :)
2008-05-08T19:03:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	I don't have much experience, but I would start with FreeDOS. There is also something called UBD that I've used years ago (universal boot disk, I think)
2008-05-08T19:04:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	once you have a DOS system running, it's a matter of running 'fdisk /fixmbr'. Perhaps you want to disconnect one of your disks, so you know for sure which one you are operating on
2008-05-08T19:06:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	I think that's part of the problem. Your BIOS and Ubuntu disagree about which one is the first disk in your system.
2008-05-08T19:08:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	no, not at all
2008-05-08T19:09:00.000Z	soundray	micooooo	logical vs. primary partitions never causes problems like yours
