2011-06-19T20:09:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	what is cw? (other than Continous Wave)
2011-06-19T20:11:00.000Z	maahes	usr13	change word
2011-06-19T20:12:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	Never knew that commaned existed.  I know about dw but not cw
2011-06-19T20:13:00.000Z	maahes	usr13	cw is nice :) basically dw + drops you into insert.
2011-06-19T20:13:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	Yea I see.  It works.
2011-06-19T20:13:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	But seems to be just the same as dw
2011-06-19T20:14:00.000Z	maahes	usr13	dw doesn't drop you into insert.
2011-06-19T20:14:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	Yea ok I see that now.
2011-06-19T20:15:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	As far as your implementation of vim  not letting you cw or dw last word in the file... well I dono about that.  Strange.
2011-06-19T20:17:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	but mine is version 7.2.330  (Ubuntu 10.04)
2011-06-19T20:17:00.000Z	maahes	usr13	yeah, I'm on 11.04, it didn't have this problem on 10.10, and D still works.
2011-06-19T20:17:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	What version does 11.04?
2011-06-19T20:19:00.000Z	maahes	usr13	7.3
2011-06-19T20:19:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	 Well, I know what dd does but what is D ?
2011-06-19T20:23:00.000Z	maahes	usr13	D is until the end of the line
2011-06-19T20:24:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	Oh yea, I see.  I knew that, just forgot.
2011-06-19T20:24:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	So does D work on last word of file?
2011-06-19T20:25:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	So, there is your work-around :)
2011-06-19T20:31:00.000Z	usr13	maahes	I would assume c$ or C is good for last word, so there is your work-around for cw for last work.  Still strange though.  cw still works elswhere accept for last word of file?  Right?
