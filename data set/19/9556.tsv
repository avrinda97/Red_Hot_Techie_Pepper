2007-03-23T07:07:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	I have compiz running and it's fine but there seems to be more theming for beryl...is there a speed difference that you are aware of? as in cpu sucking etc...
2007-03-23T07:07:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	beryl has more features, and compiz is more bugfree according to some people.
2007-03-23T07:08:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	no not really. I tried both but sort of preffered compiz.
2007-03-23T07:08:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	both have clitshes, and I preffered those in compiz...
2007-03-23T07:09:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	what window decorator are you using
2007-03-23T07:09:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	if you use gwd any metacity theme should work
2007-03-23T07:10:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	hm, I guess that is where I'm going wrong, not sure how to install a "window decorator", I'm just going to my system/themes
2007-03-23T07:11:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	which compiz package are you using?
2007-03-23T07:11:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	no idea actually
2007-03-23T07:12:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	what does apt-cache show compiz say? should tell you which version you have installed
2007-03-23T07:14:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	0.0.13.38-0ubuntu3 - compiz-core (0 (null)) compiz-plugins (2 0.2) compiz-gnome (0 (null)) cgwd (2 0.59)
2007-03-23T07:15:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	ahh. That's a pretty old package. You said you're on edgy right?
2007-03-23T07:15:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	yes
2007-03-23T07:16:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	if you wan't to investigate you can go to www.go-compiz.org or www.beryl-project.org for further info
2007-03-23T07:16:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	should give you details of both compiz and beryl
2007-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	ok, I will, don't need any hand holding, I thought there might be a newer repo or something, thanks for the suggestions!
2007-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	and how to get the latest packages for edgy. But be prepared for some tinkering...
2007-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	misfit_toy	bh_	sure thing, always is!
2007-03-23T07:19:00.000Z	bh_	misfit_toy	didn't mean to "lecture". It's just that the newer versions are much better.
