2010-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	greg__		anybody up for a challange?
2010-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	greg__		so I paid for 24hrs of hotel internet
2010-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	greg__		which is now expired
2010-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	greg__		but I have this single ssh connection to my home computer that stayed open
2010-11-17T05:25:00.000Z	greg__		any ideas how to make it do port forwarding without closing it?
2010-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	shcherbak	greg__	why you need x?
2010-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	greg__		haha mostly to browse reddit
2010-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	shcherbak	greg__	links2? elinks?
2010-11-17T05:29:00.000Z	greg__	shcherbak	I know I can browse by text, I just wanted to see if it was possible to beat the system
2010-11-17T05:30:00.000Z	greg__		I can't open a new connection
2010-11-17T05:30:00.000Z	greg__		that's the catch
2010-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	shcherbak	greg__	thinking, most obvious would to try second connection
2010-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	greg__		haha its night and raining where I am, but thanks
2010-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	greg__		haha actually might be the best option
2010-11-17T05:31:00.000Z	greg__		I was just hoping there was some magic way to change the terms of a ssh connection while it was already open
2010-11-17T05:36:00.000Z	greg__		I'm not sure how that would work, but idk I't probably not worth it, I think I'l just give in and give the westin my money
2010-11-17T05:37:00.000Z	greg__		oh shit I got a plan
2010-11-17T05:37:00.000Z	greg__		how about netcat
2010-11-17T05:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	greg__	or use wget -R
