2010-08-29T15:02:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		Hey guys, I tried to install Portable Virtualbox ( http://www.vbox.me/ ) using Wine and it's taking up some massive file somewhere and I don't know where it is. I'm down to 3 mb of space and I don't know what to do
2010-08-29T15:02:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		I'm running Wubi and I installed it to my host directory but there's some huge file it's taking up on my Ubuntu :c
2010-08-29T15:03:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		Oh crap I'm down to 2 mb now
2010-08-29T15:04:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		Guys, my disk space is going down, I need some help..
2010-08-29T15:04:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		Doesn't matter
2010-08-29T15:04:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		Something's still wrong
2010-08-29T15:05:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		Yes
2010-08-29T15:05:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		You seem to be missing the point here
2010-08-29T15:06:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		The portable virtualbox app is a Windows program. It legally cannot contain the VirtualBox code so it downloads it somewhere. The .exe has a download button in it. I click it and boom, my hard drive fills up and there seems to be no files anywhere
2010-08-29T15:06:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin		I looked at the disk usage analyzer and there was nothing different
2010-08-29T15:06:00.000Z	dmex	CanadianPenguin	if your on windows try cleaning out your %temp% folder
2010-08-29T15:09:00.000Z	dmex	CanadianPenguin	your temp folder.
2010-08-29T15:09:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin	dmex	Temp folder has been cleaned several times and is not taking up any space
2010-08-29T15:10:00.000Z	dmex	CanadianPenguin	how big is the hdd?
2010-08-29T15:11:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin	dmex	134 gb, wubi was around 5 gb but only had 100 mb left before this
2010-08-29T15:12:00.000Z	dmex	CanadianPenguin	you want to know whats talking up that 100mb or was it more?
2010-08-29T15:13:00.000Z	CanadianPenguin	dmex	I want to know where the files it downloaded are stored because disk usage analyzer/manual searching has been useless so far
2010-08-29T15:18:00.000Z	dmex	CanadianPenguin	I wouldnt expect to save 100mb
2010-08-29T15:19:00.000Z	dmex	CanadianPenguin	log files, temp files, os updates etc... 100mb would be gone quite quickly
