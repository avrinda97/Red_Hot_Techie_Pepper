2011-02-09T15:25:00.000Z	zewb		i need help with my ubuntu system
2011-02-09T15:25:00.000Z	zewb		i cant seem to su to root
2011-02-09T15:25:00.000Z	zewb		theres a password even though i didnt set one during installation
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		whats the deal with that
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		hmm
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		so like
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	ubuntu does not have a root account enabled
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	sudo asks for the users password
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	there is no root password
2011-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	so all someone has to do is get roots password and they can have root accesss?
2011-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	how is any difference in getting your password or root's??
2011-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	not supported here
2011-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	use a distro that do not use sudo by default ( all of the other ones )
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	bluenemo we do not support enabling the root password account in this channel
2011-02-09T15:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	« sudo is a bad idea » care to back that up with some reasoning?
2011-02-09T15:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	or we have to accept your word ?
2011-02-09T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	first thing sudo is safer. with root account enabled i only have to guess your password with sudo i have to guess your login name *and* your password
2011-02-09T15:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	second; every sudo invocation/attemp is logged in auth.log better traceability/accounting. root logins? no luck.
2011-02-09T15:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	zewb	so now tell us exactly how is sudo « a bad idea » ?
