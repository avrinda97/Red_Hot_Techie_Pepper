2005-09-29T09:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	see the msg that ubotu sent you a minute or so ago...
2005-09-29T09:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	see ubotu above ^^^
2005-09-29T10:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	cd to whatever directory has the deb file in it, then do the dpkg stuff
2005-09-29T10:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	different from dos... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands for some basics
2005-09-29T10:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	use sudo
2005-09-29T10:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	what are you trying to install via dpkg?
2005-09-29T10:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	use GAIM, it'll do yahoo and a bunch of other IM stuff - and it's pre-installed in Ubuntu...
2005-09-29T10:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	so "sudo dpkg -i <whatever.deb>" if Gaim is really busted...
2005-09-29T10:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	eagleye	you can't use dpkg if Synaptic is also open
