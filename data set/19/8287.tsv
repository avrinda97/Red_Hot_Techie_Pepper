2008-01-21T21:13:00.000Z	ceil420		i want a 21" CRT :o
2008-01-21T21:14:00.000Z	ceil420		enjoy your lack of true blacks and fail native resolutions
2008-01-21T21:14:00.000Z	ceil420		lol sipior; i'm over the age of 10, i can handle carrying a CRT :p
2008-01-21T21:15:00.000Z	ceil420		lol true
2008-01-21T21:17:00.000Z	ceil420		nah, i can take a 30" :p
2008-01-21T21:18:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	two 24" side by side are too wide, but 3 with the side 2 angled might work ok
2008-01-21T21:19:00.000Z	ceil420	calc	i think ideal for me would be a main 21"+ screen front and center, a 17-20" screen off to the side for stuff like GIMP and Firefox, and a little 12-15" for 'utilities' (sys info etc)
2008-01-21T21:20:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	i've found off to the side hard to read which was why i was mentioning angling might help
2008-01-21T21:21:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	at least at the 24" size
2008-01-21T21:21:00.000Z	ceil420	calc	where can i get a 24" CRT? :o
2008-01-21T21:21:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	i have two 24" 1920x1200 LCDs
2008-01-21T21:21:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	but yea Sony and Iiyama made 24" widescreen CRTs iirc
2008-01-21T21:22:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	maybe NEC also
2008-01-21T21:23:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	CRT quality varies just like LCD
2008-01-21T21:23:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	a FW900 is not a $15 monitor
2008-01-21T21:23:00.000Z	ceil420	calc	true :p
2008-01-21T21:24:00.000Z	ceil420	calc	also, people upgrade to shiny new LCDs and don't think their 10 year old CRT's are worth very much, so just sell 'em for dirt cheap even though they work just fine
2008-01-21T21:24:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	yea that is true :)
2008-01-21T21:24:00.000Z	calc	ceil420	I have an IBM P260 which is very nice but haven't used it since I bought the 2 24" LCDs a few years ago
