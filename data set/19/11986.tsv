2005-10-28T06:22:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	it varies
2005-10-28T06:22:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	if you want a happy ubuntu box, just stick to the repos
2005-10-28T06:59:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	very
2005-10-28T06:59:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	doing it now
2005-10-28T06:59:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	set what up? the ssh-server on the ubuntu end?
2005-10-28T07:00:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	is the machine plugged straight into a cable modem or DSL modem or is it behind a router?
2005-10-28T07:02:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	you'll have to enable port forwarding on the router
2005-10-28T07:02:00.000Z	tarheelcoxn	corincole	depending on your router that can be very easy or practically impossible
2005-10-28T07:03:00.000Z	corincole	tarheelcoxn	pm....
