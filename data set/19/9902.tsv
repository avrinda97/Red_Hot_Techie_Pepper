2006-08-30T12:33:00.000Z	AndrukTatum		how do i get the ubuntu live CD to mount all partitions automatically, like knoppix?
2006-08-30T12:33:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	you don't, a live cd is not supposed to mount any drives, it's supposed to run by itself
2006-08-30T12:34:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	then how do i get it to mount my drives?
2006-08-30T12:35:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	did they show up in locations - > computer ?
2006-08-30T12:37:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	they do, but i cant access them nor change their permissions
2006-08-30T12:38:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	is there no "mount" option?
2006-08-30T12:39:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	there is, it says that the device is not removable and it could not execute pmount
2006-08-30T12:39:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	try a sudo mount /dev/hd* ;)
2006-08-30T12:39:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	* being the right letter+integer
2006-08-30T12:40:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	righto, did that, and it says it cant find the drives in fstab or mtab
2006-08-30T12:40:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	so now i get to edit fstab and/or mtab?
2006-08-30T12:40:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	I wouldn't put them there, useless in a live session. point it to some mountpoint. see man mount ;)
2006-08-30T12:41:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	'$ mount -t <type> <dev> <path>'
2006-08-30T12:43:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	type is the fs, dev is /dev/hd* and path is the path where i want to mount it, right?
2006-08-30T12:44:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	yep, type for example ntfs/ext3/vfat , dev for example /dev/hda1, path /path/to/some/mountpoint
2006-08-30T12:45:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	so what do you do then? create it!
2006-08-30T12:48:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	e-type	okay, thanks!
2006-08-30T12:49:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	np
2006-08-30T12:49:00.000Z	e-type	AndrukTatum	be carefull what you change on your alien drives ;)
