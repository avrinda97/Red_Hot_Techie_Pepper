2010-06-18T19:47:00.000Z	cristian_c		Hi
2010-06-18T19:48:00.000Z	cristian_c		I was told I have to edit the file /etc/gdm/custom.conf to turn sounds on login
2010-06-18T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 theres some gui tools that enable/disable teh GDM login sound if thats all you want to do.
2010-06-18T19:49:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	which tools?
2010-06-18T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 ubuntu-tweak for one, gdm2setup for another and proberly a dozen others.. its a common thing people want to disable
2010-06-18T19:51:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	I tried Gdm2setup, but it still seems to lack the necessary capabilities
2010-06-18T19:51:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	I'll install ubuntu-tweak
2010-06-18T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 if you want to turn OFF the login sound on gdm.. the normal 'gdmsetup' tool has a checkbox for that
2010-06-18T19:53:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	I tried, but its tab is disabled
2010-06-18T19:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 use the 'unlock' button? It worked for me just fine in 10.04 just now when i tried it
2010-06-18T19:59:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	In the General tab there is the option to disable the login sound, but I would rather turn on the sounds of a theme that I downloaded
2010-06-18T19:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 i dont have a general tab.
2010-06-18T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 what versuion of ubuntu are you using?
2010-06-18T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 I dotn know what general tab you mean then. I run 'gdmsetup' and theres no tabs at all.
2010-06-18T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 perhaps we are confused as to what you are trying to do.
2010-06-18T20:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 im using the normal 'gdmsetup' not gdm2setup' and  gdmsetup can disable the login sound .
2010-06-18T20:06:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	ok, but I would turn on the sounds and install a sound theme that I downloaded
2010-06-18T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cristian_c	 no idea on sound themes.. I just turn off the annoying sounds.
2010-06-18T20:21:00.000Z	cristian_c	Dr_Willis	ok, I tried ubuntu-tweak too, but There is nothing about enabling login sounds :(
