2012-08-07T03:37:00.000Z	litropy		Hey guys, I'm trying to write a script. I need to know what network-manager is doing when I click the wifi icon, and click the network that I'm already connected to. Doing so tells network-manager to disconnect then reconnect to the same network.

2012-08-09T19:58:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	"admin user"?
2012-08-09T19:59:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	I connect using the same user that I log into when I boot up.
2012-08-09T20:00:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	^^
2012-08-09T20:02:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	Did you restart vsftp?
2012-08-09T20:02:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	yes
2012-08-09T20:04:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	pastebinit /etc/vsftpd.conf
2012-08-09T20:07:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1138023/
2012-08-09T20:08:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	you know what, I think it's an issue with os x (my client OS), because I can open a terminal in OS X and 'put' just fine. Yet I can't do it using the GUI.
2012-08-09T20:08:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	What is that?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1138023/
2012-08-09T20:09:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	whoops you wanted the .conf sorry
2012-08-09T20:09:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	that's the log
2012-08-09T20:10:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	Actually, never mind.  Just install / use proftpd
2012-08-09T20:11:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	benefits?
2012-08-09T20:11:00.000Z	litropy	usr13	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1138029/
2012-08-09T20:11:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	yes
2012-08-09T20:23:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	I dono for sure, (I use proftpd because it is easier), but I think you prolly have to uncomment chroot_local_user=YES and add user name to /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
2012-08-23T01:16:00.000Z	usr13	litropy	lsb_release -r
