2008-04-02T00:11:00.000Z	cook		hey guys. i've got a big problem. my pc is running since 4 hours now. and at the start until before one hour every thing was okay. but then the load was going high and the pc was lagging. i dont know what it could be
2008-04-02T00:11:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	run the "top" command on the console and press "p" while it runs.
2008-04-02T00:12:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	the only thing my htop shows me is the biggest cpu % with 3 its pidgin and there is no "Z" at the STAT
2008-04-02T00:13:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	What does "cat /proc/meminfo" show, and is the hard drive ok?

2008-04-02T00:14:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	how should i know if the hard drive is ok. i think its okay...
2008-04-02T00:18:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	is it a sata drive or a ide drive?
2008-04-02T00:18:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	it is a ide drive
2008-04-02T00:20:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	okay wait
2008-04-02T00:22:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	SMART Disabled. Use option -s with argument 'on' to enable it.
2008-04-02T00:22:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	how old is the drive?
2008-04-02T00:23:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	about three years
2008-04-02T00:26:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	and now?
2008-04-02T00:26:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	Well you could activate smart for the drive, but I'm not sure if this is a safe operation. I haven't had any problems with it, but I wouldn't recommend it without knowing the hardware.
2008-04-02T00:27:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	but what could that be, i mean my load is higher than 3 or 2 and can this real be the hard drive?
2008-04-02T00:28:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	I wouldn't think so, but if there isn't any process that causes the load. Hm, another idea - maybe there is rootkit on your PC. Did you run "chkrootkit" ?
2008-04-02T00:30:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	i think where should i have got the rootkit? i dont load any warez or cracks etc
2008-04-02T00:32:00.000Z	nbkr	cook	was just an idea. A rootkit would prevent htop to show the process.
2008-04-02T00:32:00.000Z	cook	nbkr	but chkrootkit didnt find anything
