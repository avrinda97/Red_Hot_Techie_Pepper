2009-02-08T01:32:00.000Z	Tonik		How do I figure out if a machine is Ubuntu Server or Desktop?
2009-02-08T01:33:00.000Z	Tonik		2.6.15-52-686, and what does that tell me?
2009-02-08T01:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	They're not exactly different.  You can use uname like deany said to determine the kernel, but that won't tell you much anyway (you can have either kernel on either).  You can also check to see if X is installed
2009-02-08T01:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	That means you're running Dapper, and it's likely a desktop machine.
2009-02-08T01:34:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	X is installed, but I may have installed it on top of a server edittion  :)_
2009-02-08T01:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	Indeed.  There isn't really a hard fast way to tell, because they're not different.
2009-02-08T01:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	Use the alternate CD
2009-02-08T01:34:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	alternate can also be server and desktop, right?
2009-02-08T01:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	It can install a desktop box with a GUI, or a CLI-only box, yes.  But it's not the same as the "server" flavor, which has a separate kernel
2009-02-08T01:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	But the alternate CD has the most packages on it, and it'll result in you needing to download fewer from the internet during install.  Of course, you also will have updates after you upgrade, so if you're just using a CD to save on bandwidth, I say just go with the straight internet upgrade.
2009-02-08T01:37:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	I'm just using a CD to save on traffic , and I have ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso and ubuntu-8.04-server-i386.iso
2009-02-08T01:38:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	so whatever I use it shouldn't hurt anything, just affect the amount of stuff it downloads?
2009-02-08T01:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	You need the alternate CD.  Desktop can't be used to upgrade.  However, consider this:  You're going to download the 700MB alternate CD to save on about 500MB worth of packages (which you'll then need to upgrade anyway, since 8.04.2 was released a few weeks ago)
2009-02-08T01:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	Actually, you only have 8.04, so those packages are even older.  I honestly would just say do a straight upgrade from the internet.  Those packages are almost a year old
2009-02-08T01:39:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	I see. Thanks
2009-02-08T02:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	It *may* work, but hasn't been tested/verified to work.  Dapper-updates + full up-to-date ensures a known configuration pre-upgrade
2009-02-08T02:57:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	i see
2009-02-08T02:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Tonik	Are you using update-manager-core?
2009-02-08T02:57:00.000Z	Tonik	Flannel	mmm, yes, the do-* cli thing
