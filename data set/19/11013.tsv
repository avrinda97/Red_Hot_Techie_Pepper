2009-01-02T08:18:00.000Z	Varth		Can anyone point me in the right direction for a working .deb of ZSNES in Intrepid?
2009-01-02T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Varth	 32 or 64bit ?
2009-01-02T08:19:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	32bit.
2009-01-02T08:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		!info zsnes
2009-01-02T08:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Varth	 32bit is in the repos... there is no 64bit version of zsnes.. alternatively the snes9x emulator works very well also
2009-01-02T08:19:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	The 32 bit version in the repos doesn't work.
2009-01-02T08:20:00.000Z	Varth		Hasn't for a while.
2009-01-02T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Varth	 what dosent work about it?
2009-01-02T08:20:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	It won't launch
2009-01-02T08:20:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	I had a working deb of it a while ago, but reinstalled and can't find it now.
2009-01-02T08:22:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	From what I've gathered from boards and stuff, the version in the repos was compiled wrong or something.
2009-01-02T08:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Varth	 run it from a terminal and look for error messages :() it seems its trying to read a incorrect /dev/ entry  not sure why
2009-01-02T08:23:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	PM sent.
2009-01-02T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Varth	 looks like its got a BUffer Overflow.. bummer.. nasty bug.  Perhaps the forums, or ppa repos have a newer/fixed version
2009-01-02T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		!find snes
2009-01-02T08:26:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	I had a deb for it that I used for Intrepid, but I just installed Mint 6 and can't find the deb any more.
2009-01-02T08:26:00.000Z	Varth		Same error between distros though.
2009-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		!find glxinfo
2009-01-02T08:44:00.000Z	Varth	Dr_willis_	I finally found a working .deb: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/18358430/zsnes_1.510b-1%7Etimo2_i386.deb
