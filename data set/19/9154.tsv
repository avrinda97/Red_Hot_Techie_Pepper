2009-08-30T23:52:00.000Z	justyna_		>Is there some way to run x300 radeon (unsupported) with leates Ubuntu?
2009-08-30T23:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	with the free radeon or radeonhd driver ?
2009-08-30T23:53:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	with fglrx, or other if could work aswell
2009-08-30T23:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	i thought you said that fglrx does not support fglrx any longer...
2009-08-30T23:54:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	so how could i get such performance with other method_
2009-08-30T23:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	i dunno if performance is the same try the radeon driver. is installed by default.
2009-08-30T23:55:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	so perfomance is terrible
2009-08-30T23:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	it was fine for my 9200 back in the day (now i have nvidia)
2009-08-30T23:56:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	3d work very bad
2009-08-30T23:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	try this one instead ? xserver-xorg-video-radeonhd
2009-08-30T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	then you are stuck with radeon ? i really dunno sorry
2009-08-30T23:59:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	yes, i am stuck
2009-08-31T00:00:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	and thats why i am back to Windows...
2009-08-31T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	your choice. linux is all about choice imho
2009-08-31T00:01:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	its not a choice
2009-08-31T00:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	yes; it is you can accept a loss in performance to have ubuntu installed.
2009-08-31T00:03:00.000Z	justyna_	erUSUL	less performance? its no performance
2009-08-31T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	justyna_	but we can agree we disagree :)
