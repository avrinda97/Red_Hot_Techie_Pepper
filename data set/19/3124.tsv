2010-06-30T03:50:00.000Z	vock		I'm just trying to load from a LiveCD but when it gets to starting gdm all I get are a bunch of tightly packed beige stripes across the screen. It's on both the 32 and 64 bit Ubuntu LiveCDs. The burns should be good, I used them before yesterday on the same machine
2010-06-30T03:51:00.000Z	thune3	vock	do you know what brand of graphics chip you have?
2010-06-30T03:52:00.000Z	vock	thune3	I believe it's nvidia
2010-06-30T03:53:00.000Z	vock	thune3	Actually i'm wrong, it's an ATI Radeon Xpress 1150, just googled it
2010-06-30T03:54:00.000Z	thune3	vock	when booting ESC-enter_lang-F6-Esc. Try adding "xforcevesa" to the grub line after quiet splash. This is a workaround, and you will need to find a real fix (maybe installing proprietary drivers) if you choose to install.
2010-06-30T03:55:00.000Z	vock	thune3	that's at the beige screen?
2010-06-30T03:55:00.000Z	vock	thune3	or during the splash?
2010-06-30T03:55:00.000Z	thune3	vock	the very first graphics screen with the two icons at the bottom.
2010-06-30T03:56:00.000Z	vock	thune3	i'll give it a try
2010-06-30T03:56:00.000Z	vock		thanks
2010-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	vock	thune3	Didn't work, got the stripes again
2010-06-30T04:02:00.000Z	thune3	vock	you might try acpi=off seperatly or in addition
2010-06-30T04:04:00.000Z	vock	thune3	checking it out now
2010-06-30T04:05:00.000Z	vock	thune3	that was already on the line
2010-06-30T04:06:00.000Z	vock	thune3	thank you a bunch
2010-06-30T04:06:00.000Z	vock	thune3	you are a gentlemen and a scholar
2010-06-30T04:07:00.000Z	vock	thune3	that's right. Gentlemen, your kindness is that of many
2010-06-30T04:10:00.000Z	thune3	vock	you got in?
2010-06-30T04:12:00.000Z	vock	thune3	yep, the acpi=none with xforcevesa worked
