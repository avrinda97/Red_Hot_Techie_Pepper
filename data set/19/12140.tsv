2005-10-23T10:58:00.000Z	r0xoR		it might actually be .xsession that you want
2005-10-23T10:58:00.000Z	r0xoR		and then again
2005-10-23T10:58:00.000Z	r0xoR		it might actually be .Xclients-default
2005-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	r0xoR		so what's the big deal
2005-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	r0xoR		just do what it says on the forum
2005-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	r0xoR		so just do what it says
2005-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	r0xoR		but i think the file you want is .xsession
2005-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	r0xoR		and if .xinitrc and .xsession don't work then try .Xclients-default
2005-10-23T11:01:00.000Z	r0xoR		!backports
2005-10-23T11:01:00.000Z	r0xoR		!tell yale about backports
2005-10-23T11:01:00.000Z	dabaR	r0xoR	!+ backports would have worked, + ensures it is public.
2005-10-23T11:21:00.000Z	dabaR	r0xoR	yeah, I saw those two today. well, ubuntu has both.
2005-10-23T11:26:00.000Z	dabaR	r0xoR	how come you chose a nick like that?
2005-10-23T11:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	dabaR	how come you chose a nick like THAT?
2005-10-23T11:28:00.000Z	dabaR	r0xoR	I dont know how come I chose it, well I do. my first initial is d, and second b, so I was daba(means stupid) for a while, then I changed to dabaR cause it means beaver.
2005-10-23T11:29:00.000Z	r0xoR	dabaR	what planet do you come from?
2005-10-23T11:30:00.000Z	dabaR	r0xoR	no offense, I am just curious how someone comes to choose r0xoR as a nick.
2005-10-23T11:31:00.000Z	r0xoR	dabaR	well i chose my nick because I'm a rocker - i.e. i am a musician
2005-10-23T11:32:00.000Z	r0xoR	dabaR	my nickname is also making fun of the wannabe l337 haxors on the internet
