2010-10-09T02:05:00.000Z	crimsonmane		mobo is Intel DG33TL
2010-10-09T02:05:00.000Z	crimsonmane		the onboard isnt working, but apparently i have to hardwire in order to get my WUSB600N Linksys to work
2010-10-09T02:05:00.000Z	crimsonmane		k then what
2010-10-09T02:07:00.000Z	crimsonmane		its an intel
2010-10-09T02:07:00.000Z	crimsonmane		and no, i cant, because nothing works that online says
2010-10-09T02:07:00.000Z	crimsonmane		scott the comp is in the other room
2010-10-09T02:07:00.000Z	crimsonmane		its not easy moving around like that
2010-10-09T02:08:00.000Z	crimsonmane		for every little thing.
2010-10-09T02:08:00.000Z	crimsonmane		it simply doesnt work. i've been working on it for 10 hours
2010-10-09T02:09:00.000Z	crimsonmane		the motherboard is an Intel DG33TL, so from there we can look up the intel nic drivers
2010-10-09T02:10:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 open a terminal and type:  lspci    like scott_ino said, then look for a netowork or ethernet controller
2010-10-09T02:11:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 now google it and find out what driver you need,  then do a lsmod to see if is is loading
2010-10-09T02:13:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 so what network controller do you have?
2010-10-09T02:14:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 that doesn't make sense
2010-10-09T02:15:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 so what network controller do you have?  then we can google it and see if things are the way they are suppose to be
2010-10-09T02:22:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 you're using 10.04 right?
2010-10-09T02:28:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 you've been using Unix for 6 years and can't get this working?
2010-10-09T02:31:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 ok let's try this again, so your Ethernet Controller is a 82566DC Gigabit correct?
2010-10-09T02:45:00.000Z	collosi	crimsonmane	 what?  it is clearly there
