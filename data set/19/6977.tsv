2008-01-13T00:35:00.000Z	ArrPirate		so, there's no help for my tiny fonts issue?
2008-01-13T00:36:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	probably someone with a clue will happen by later
2008-03-08T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	as in didn't work, what does that entail
2008-03-08T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	ok, first you want to   sudo mkdir /media/disk  (so there's somewhere to mount)  and then the line you have will mount your ntfs partition read only
2008-03-08T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	then your fstab line should have   ntfs-3g    defaults,umask=007,gid=46   instead of  ntfs defaults if you want to write
2008-03-08T08:15:00.000Z	ArrPirate	nickrud	Ok, so now a reboot should fix the problem?
2008-03-08T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	after those changes, you can test  with   sudo mount /media/disk
2008-03-08T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	if you get the right behavior with that, then every time you boot you'll have the same behavior
2008-03-08T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	   ls  /media  put that on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and /etc/fstab also
2008-07-18T02:54:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	yes, mkdir /path/to/mountpoint && sudo mount /dev/<device> -t vfat /path/to/mountpoint
2008-07-18T02:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	that will mount it read only
2008-07-18T02:57:00.000Z	ArrPirate	nickrud	didn't work
2008-07-18T02:58:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	that should work fine, are you sure you have a mountpoint directory already made?
2008-07-18T02:58:00.000Z	ArrPirate	nickrud	yes
2008-07-18T02:59:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	is the partition good?
2008-07-18T03:00:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	ah, -t fatx then
2008-07-18T03:00:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	I read that as fatX where X was 16 or 32
2008-07-18T03:03:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	you need to use nicks in lines, I missed your line
2008-07-18T03:03:00.000Z	nickrud	ArrPirate	http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Mounting_FATX_partitions_HOWTO has info for you
