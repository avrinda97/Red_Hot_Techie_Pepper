2008-11-18T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	so you have a machine that can access the IRC network to act as a proxy
2008-11-18T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	where do you plan to run the proxy
2008-11-18T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	do you have a machine on the internet that you can connect to to run the proxy
2008-11-18T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	no - do you have a machine on the internet to run the proxy on
2008-11-18T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	you can't, as the machine your on can't connect to the internet
2008-11-18T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	you wn't be able to as the machine your on can't connect to the correct irc ports
2008-11-18T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	if the machine your on can't connect to the irc ports, how do you intent to use it as a proxy
2008-11-18T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	I'm in that channel, I can see what your saying
2008-11-18T23:48:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	this is not an ubuntu problem, so please stopdiscussing it
2008-11-18T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	no it's not, ubuntu is not hear to solve your networking problems
2008-11-18T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	stop talking about it - talk to your network admins, this is not an ubuntu issue
2008-11-18T23:52:00.000Z	ikonia	mewshi	not it's not - your network is the problem, speak to the people who run your network
