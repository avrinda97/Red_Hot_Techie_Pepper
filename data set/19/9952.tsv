2006-09-15T16:54:00.000Z	lupine_85		what's the version number, if you don't mind me asking
2006-09-15T16:54:00.000Z	lupine_85		my botfu seems to be down right now, and I'm in edgy
2006-09-15T16:56:00.000Z	lupine_85		Or the base ralink driver?
2006-09-15T16:56:00.000Z	lupine_85		ah, the kernel update isn't an ABI change so that's OK
2006-09-15T16:57:00.000Z	davey_	lupine_85	I think so, are you talking about modding the interface file?
2006-09-15T16:56:00.000Z	lupine_85	davey_	rt2x00 or rt61 ?
2006-09-15T16:57:00.000Z	lupine_85	davey_	th rt61 driver needs a patch applying for amd64... have you done that
2006-09-15T16:58:00.000Z	lupine_85	davey_	no. There's a portion of the source code that isn't 64-bit safe. The patch fixes that, but introduces a (small) memory leak
