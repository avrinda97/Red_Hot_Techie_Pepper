2011-09-05T02:47:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	if you're trying to copy files >4GB, is the filesystem something that can handle that (hint: FAT32 can't)
2011-09-05T02:58:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	take the hub out of the equation before purchasing cables. plug the drive directly into the USB port of the computer.
2011-09-05T03:00:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	you need to take the hub away before purchasing cables.
2011-09-05T03:01:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	I am not using a USB hub.
2011-09-05T03:01:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	what format is the partition you're trying to use on that device?
2011-09-05T03:02:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	NTFS
2011-09-05T03:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	NTFS write support in Linux can be shaky. does the drive exhibit odd symptoms doing similar tasks in Windows?
2011-09-05T03:03:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	I haven't tested that recently.
2011-09-05T03:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	before spending money, you might want to check. what are you using to run a backup in Linux?
2011-09-05T03:04:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	rsync
2011-09-05T03:06:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	try "rsync -rtvu --modify-window=1 --progress /path /path"
2011-09-05T03:06:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	the --modify-window may help when using NTFS
2011-09-05T03:09:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	Okay. I will try.
2011-09-05T03:14:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	The harddisk doesn't work anymore
2011-09-05T03:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	that's FAT, not NTFS.
2011-09-05T03:20:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	you'll encounter file size issues (no files >4GB), open descriptor issues, and timestamp issues when using rsync with FAT32
2011-09-05T03:21:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	but you have bad blocks all over that disk. it's certainly time to think about reformatting, and if that does not help, replace the media.
2011-09-05T03:22:00.000Z	Somelauw	mneptok	my bad
2011-09-05T03:23:00.000Z	mneptok	Somelauw	an fsck.fat32 is in order. or use diagnostic tools in Windows.
