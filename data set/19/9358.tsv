2008-02-14T12:05:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	just type whois
2008-09-16T23:23:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	many.. gftp is one
2008-09-16T23:35:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	nvidia-settings
2009-04-07T11:35:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	you could boot from a live cd and use "dd" or "wipe" to clear it all
2009-04-07T11:35:00.000Z	arooni	Slart	i'm at the livecde;  how do i do that
2009-04-07T11:36:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	I'm not sure what those low level formatting utilities from the manufacturers actually do besides that..
2009-04-07T11:36:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	I've never managed to remember the syntax for dd.. man dd in a terminal will probably tell you more..
2009-04-07T11:45:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	you did run the command as root, right?
2009-04-07T11:45:00.000Z	arooni	Slart	yes sir
2009-04-07T11:46:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	hmm.. odd
2009-04-07T11:47:00.000Z	arooni	Slart	actually when i do : "sudo fdisk -l" i see nothing.
2009-12-28T05:33:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	there might be a few.. check for RSI or write a simple bash script
2009-12-28T05:34:00.000Z	arooni	Slart	what is RSI
2009-12-28T05:34:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	something like Repetetive Strain Injury
2009-12-28T05:34:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	when you're doing the same thing for extended periods of tim
2009-12-28T05:35:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	in bash something like sleep 60*25;beep;sleep 60*5;beep   there are fancy "beep" utilities out there.. you'll probably have to do the calculations for the sleep timer yourself
2009-12-28T05:41:00.000Z	arooni	Slart	workrave works sooo wlel!
2009-12-28T05:41:00.000Z	Slart	arooni	good =)
