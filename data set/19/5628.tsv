2008-06-17T06:58:00.000Z	xTOGx		i'm kinda new to this world, BCM43.  in windows, i'd say it was under file system/nathan but i'm not sure how things are arranged here
2008-06-17T06:58:00.000Z	xTOGx		diablo ii.iso is the file name
2008-06-17T07:00:00.000Z	xTOGx		ok, i'm in file system. the only things i see are [nathan] [desktop] [trash] [file system]
2008-06-17T07:01:00.000Z	xTOGx		ok... you mean in the file manager?
2008-06-17T07:02:00.000Z	xTOGx		i don't see anything, BCM43
