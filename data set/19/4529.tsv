2009-11-22T06:59:00.000Z	Travis		hello A/all
2009-11-22T07:00:00.000Z	Travis		Ubuntu is making me want to pull my hair out.  I have a laptop it's on that has an external monitor port.  How can I make it go to both?  I've tried the stuff on the forums.  It either goes to the external or internal, never both.
2009-11-22T07:01:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	It's largely dependent on your graphics chipset. Which do you have?
2009-11-22T07:06:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	What do you see for video when you run lspci?
2009-11-22T07:07:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	Try "lspci | grep VGA".
2009-11-22T07:13:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	I had to uninstall the dang driver to make the laptop work where i can read it.
2009-11-22T07:14:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	No problem.
2009-11-22T07:19:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	Still rebooting?
2009-11-22T07:27:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	here is the video card in it:  NVIDIA GeForce4 440 GoÂ™
2009-11-22T07:27:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	What's the output from "lspci | grep VGA"?
2009-11-22T07:28:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	You'll need that. The "generic" name won't give you enough information.
2009-11-22T07:34:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	 nVidia Corporation NV17 GeFroce4 440 Go
2009-11-22T07:34:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	you there?
2009-11-22T07:35:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	 nVidia Corporation NV17 GeFroce4 440 Go
2009-11-22T07:36:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	There's no PCI ID or anything in the output from "lspci | grep VGA"?
2009-11-22T07:39:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	that IS what that command spit out
2009-11-22T07:39:00.000Z	Travis	Squideshi	 nVidia Corporation NV17 GeFroce4 440 Go rev a3
2009-11-22T07:40:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	Hmmm... There's usually a PCI ID out front. For example: 00:02.0
2009-11-22T07:40:00.000Z	Squideshi	Travis	Have you tried #nvidia ?
