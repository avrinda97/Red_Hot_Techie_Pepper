2006-10-26T07:39:00.000Z	hume		where do I place a script that unlocks my encrypted partitions, so it runs at login / boot, and asks me for a password? I have a simple shesscript for it, running dmcrypt
2006-10-26T07:39:00.000Z	hume		shellscritp
2006-10-26T07:39:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	A script that contains the password?
2006-10-26T07:39:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	no, that asks me for it
2006-10-26T07:40:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	Is the homedir encrypted or a different data partition?
2006-10-26T07:40:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	a different partition, or really a loopback device
2006-10-26T07:41:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	*nod* You could interface the script via zenity and run it via the gnome sessions/startup panel.
2006-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	interface via zenity? how do I do that? got any instructions somwhere?
2006-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	i run KDE, but I guess KDEs autostart is equivalent
2006-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	'man zenity' :-)  it's *really* easy.
2006-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	ok, i'll check
2006-10-26T07:42:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	Yeah... just so you get prompted at login or somesuch.
2006-10-26T07:52:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	i'm fiddling with zenity, found out how to make a dialog asking for password, but how do I send that to the cryptsetup-command?
2006-10-26T07:52:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	Store it in an env var in the script and pass it as option (orwecho it in)
2006-10-26T07:53:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	sorry, not that good at scripts. how do I echo it in?
2006-10-26T07:54:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	cryptsetup <stuff> << zenity <stuff>?
2006-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	$PASSWORD=$(zenity --entry --title Password --text "Please enter your password:")
2006-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	cafuego	hume	Then echo"$PASSWORD" | command that reads the password off stdin.
2006-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	hume	cafuego	thanks, great!!
