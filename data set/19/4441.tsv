2009-01-11T05:05:00.000Z	MindVirus		When I elect to eject my iPod from the panel applet, it tells me I don't have permission.
2009-01-11T05:05:00.000Z	MindVirus		How do I give myself permission?
2009-01-11T05:05:00.000Z	MindVirus		I own the iPod.
2009-01-11T05:06:00.000Z	MindVirus		I can unmount it as root through the console.
2009-01-11T05:06:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 well if you use root you might not  own it
2009-01-11T05:06:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 have you tried chown?
2009-01-11T05:06:00.000Z	MindVirus	BLZ	and what should I chown?
2009-01-11T05:07:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 or maybe it's sudo chown 700 [device name]  ... yeah i think it's that
2009-01-11T05:08:00.000Z	MindVirus	BLZ	that wouldn't work.
2009-01-11T05:08:00.000Z	MindVirus	BLZ	chown changes the owner.
2009-01-11T05:08:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 oh yeah, duh.  Try chmod then
2009-01-11T05:08:00.000Z	MindVirus	BLZ	I have tried chmodding the /media/ipod directory.
2009-01-11T05:08:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 you want everybody else to be able to rwx?
2009-01-11T05:09:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 but try it with /dev/sda1 or whatever
2009-01-11T05:09:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 yeah sorry... i wasn't clear about that
2009-01-11T05:09:00.000Z	MindVirus	BLZ	nice!
2009-01-11T05:11:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 lol you play a dangerous game... don't you have to patch the kernel for that?
2009-01-11T05:12:00.000Z	MindVirus	BLZ	no, it's already in the kernel, I thought.
2009-01-11T05:12:00.000Z	BLZ	MindVirus	 i thought not, but maybe you're right... i dunno
