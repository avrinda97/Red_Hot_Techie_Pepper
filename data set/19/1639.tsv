2010-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		are you using an nvodia or ati card
2010-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		nvidia
2010-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		which card specifically
2010-12-16T15:49:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	  sure..its the radeon 9600[rv350]
2010-12-16T15:49:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		card supported under the catalyst drivers should support dual screen
2010-12-16T15:49:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	 the trouble i had was.... on the extended screen (half of the screen was scrambled)
2010-12-16T15:50:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		my radeon 9000 doesnt do dual screen very well
2010-12-16T15:50:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	  no one was able to fix it over the last threee days.
2010-12-16T15:50:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		so i believe its an open source ati driver issue
2010-12-16T15:50:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	 its funny how it work perfectly in kubuntu though?  i figured i would have the same problem.
2010-12-16T15:51:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		it might be an xorg config thing
2010-12-16T15:51:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		i looked up the flags for xorg for my card and played with the xorg file you might try the same
2010-12-16T15:52:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	 i dont even have an xorg file though ..... =/
2010-12-16T15:52:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		google how to generate a new xorg file in ubuntu 10.10
2010-12-16T15:53:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		its what i did
2010-12-16T15:53:00.000Z	PhysicistJames	error_203	are you using debian
2010-12-16T15:54:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		just curious whats up with the squeeze/sid stuff
2010-12-16T15:54:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	error 203...are you asking me?
2010-12-16T15:55:00.000Z	noobie25	PhysicistJames	 i'm using this xchat new irc client...but it doesn't tell me if a message is direced to me
