2007-06-26T10:16:00.000Z	user_1		How long does it ussualy take until a bug (via launchpad) is fixed?
2007-06-26T10:16:00.000Z	user_1		Or does the time greatly vary?
2007-06-26T10:16:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	yes does
2007-06-26T10:16:00.000Z	user_1		But there's probably something like a minimum
2007-06-26T10:16:00.000Z	user_1		time
2007-06-26T10:17:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	yes, like last year
2007-06-26T10:17:00.000Z	user_1	Tm_T	so it could take several months??? lol
2007-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	well, it could be already fixed when reported, or it could take a year, it just depends
2007-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	user_1		Aha. So you just have to wait?
2007-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	or help fixing it
2007-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	user_1	Tm_T	How do you do that?
2007-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	it depends
2007-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	sometimes bugs need more info, sometimes they are not usable at all and should be closed, sometimes there's testing needed etc
2007-06-26T10:20:00.000Z	user_1	Tm_T	How do I now if more info or tests are needed?
2007-06-26T10:20:00.000Z	user_1		(I want it to be fixed soon - so I'd help with all the information I have)
2007-06-26T10:21:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	good question, devel should inform that, though common sense might tell something
2007-06-26T10:21:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	anyway, depends on what is the bug
2007-06-26T10:21:00.000Z	user_1	Tm_T	So I'd get an email (I reported it via launchpad)
2007-06-26T10:21:00.000Z	Tm_T	user_1	maybe
