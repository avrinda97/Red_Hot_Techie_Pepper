2008-10-10T07:21:00.000Z	mynameistux		can I ask pc hardware related questions here, or is it strictly ubuntu only?
2008-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	people here know a lot about hardware too, I'm sure, go ahead and ask
2008-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	Windows has limitations for sure, but I don't know of any other limitations simply based on hardware.
2008-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	I would be surprised if it had limitations, I am pretty sure, IDE is IDE, and SATA is SATA, regardless of size, therefore if a motherboard supports the standard, it should be able to support any size of HDD using that standard.
2008-10-10T07:25:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	FAT32 does have limitations, I believe, I don't know what they are right off hand, but I am pretty sure there is some sort of size constraint on that FS
2008-10-10T07:26:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	but if you are running an ubuntu server which is probably using an ext3 filesystem, why would you want to use FAT32 instead of ext3?
2008-10-10T07:27:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	You might just want to go with NTFS, FAT32 support is slow even on windows
2008-10-10T07:28:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	good decision. keep it open
2008-10-10T07:30:00.000Z	mynameistux	neeto	is right, but I don't want to pay for a windows licence
2008-10-10T07:30:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	you should just try NTFS then
2008-10-10T07:31:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	I don't (publicly) condone piracy, but who says you have to pay for anything these days? lol
2008-10-10T07:31:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	good man. demonoid/usenet FTS
2008-10-10T07:33:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	if you are going the route of APACHE then the filesystem won't matter because it will all be done over HTTP
2008-10-10T07:34:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	and samba is a good choice too, since it facilitates the sharing of files between linux and windows computers
2008-10-10T07:35:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	well since your computer would BE the server, there would be no uploading process, things would just be available from the network.
2008-10-10T07:36:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	well either way, putting things on the server would make them availiable to the network if you have the permissions set up that way.
2008-10-10T07:37:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	you should go for samba in that case
2008-10-10T07:39:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	it's not bad, but it does take work, just like most things on linux...
2008-10-10T07:40:00.000Z	neeto	mynameistux	it's configured through a config file somewhere. I don't mean to be blunt, but you should stop asking about it and go play with it. It's free and you have nothing to lose.
