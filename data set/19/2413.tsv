2010-09-12T23:26:00.000Z	Flomaster		im looking for some one who can do a fancy renaming on all files in a folder. I have a folder full of NES roms and all the files have (USA) in the file name. I need a one line command to remove  (USA) from the file names
2010-09-12T23:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	probably --> rename 's/USA//' *
2010-09-12T23:28:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	i do not have a rename feature im running a stipped down version of ubuntu   its xbmc-LIVE
2010-09-12T23:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	then use pure bash « for f in *; do mv -- "$f" --target "${f/USA/}" ; done
2010-09-12T23:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	untested. test it first
2010-09-12T23:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	second time ---> then use pure bash « for f in *; do mv -- "$f" --target "${f/USA/}" ; done
2010-09-12T23:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	worked?
2010-09-12T23:37:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	 I copied and pasted your line of text starting at  ---->  and it returned this  -bash: syntax error near unexpected token `do'
2010-09-12T23:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	you have to copy what is between the « and »
2010-09-12T23:39:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	for f in *; do mv -- "$f" --target "${f/USA/}" ; done   returned   ..... filename is not a directory
2010-09-12T23:39:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	mv: target `Attack of the Killer Tomatoes ().zip' is not a directory   I got that for each file in the folder
2010-09-12T23:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	sorry drop the --target
2010-09-12T23:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	for f in *; do mv -- "$f" "${f/USA/}" ; done
2010-09-12T23:40:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	it got rid of USA but left me with ()  in the file name
2010-09-12T23:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	for f in *; do mv -- "$f" "${f/\(\)/}" ; done
2010-09-12T23:42:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	it worked
2010-09-12T23:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	if you want to get rid o (USA) in one go -> for f in *; do mv -- "$f" "${f/\(USA\)/}" ; done
2010-09-12T23:48:00.000Z	Flomaster	erUSUL	thanks for your help  for a linux n00b like myself googling and trial and error wasn't working
2010-09-12T23:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flomaster	no problem
