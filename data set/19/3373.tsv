2012-10-26T18:26:00.000Z	LucidGuy		Can anyone explain to me my I can't sync my time with ntp.ubuntu.com   http://paste.ubuntu.com/1307278/    Thats the output from ntpdate -q
2012-10-26T18:27:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	"no server suitable for synchronization found"
2012-10-26T18:28:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Try a different server
2012-10-26T18:30:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Try a different server
2012-10-26T18:30:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2012-10-26T18:31:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Or just drop the -d
2012-10-26T18:32:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Actually it shouldn't matter....
2012-10-26T18:32:00.000Z	LucidGuy	usr13_	the -d is just for debug â€¦ dropping it makes no difference.
2012-10-26T18:32:00.000Z	LucidGuy	usr13_	and still unable to sync with the server you specified.
2012-10-26T18:32:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Must be a network issue
2012-10-26T18:33:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Looks like port 123  ?
2012-10-26T18:35:00.000Z	LucidGuy	usr13_	You think my port 123 is blocked going out?
2012-10-26T18:36:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	I don't know, but tested from mine and works ok.  That's all I can think of is that you have a network issue.
2012-10-26T18:37:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	ping -c3 ntp.ubuntu.com
2012-10-26T18:38:00.000Z	LucidGuy	usr13_	responds fine
2012-10-26T18:39:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	sudo iptables -L
2012-10-26T18:39:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	sudo iptables -L |pastebinit
2012-10-26T18:43:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	Maybe your router has a time server running?
2012-10-26T18:44:00.000Z	usr13_	LucidGuy	... and you can use it?
