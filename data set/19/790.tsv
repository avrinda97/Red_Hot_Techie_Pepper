2011-09-19T03:17:00.000Z	terr		can someone do me a favour.  I have a ga-6vtxe MB rev 1.1 and its missing memory.  I went to the gigabyte website and unfortunately no information comes up... like the page is there but its blank for me.  I would like ot know what CPU might be on it... like I do not know the family even and I can't see the cpu w/o taking the fan off and that looks like a pain.  Next I need to know what memory it likes since someone took the memory.
2011-09-19T03:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2011-09-19T03:18:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	won't boot yet.  no memory in it.
2011-09-19T03:19:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	ga-6vtxe?
2011-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	yes.  Gigabyte GA-6VTXE
2011-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	and you want to know what processor is on it?
2011-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	it could be a number
2011-09-19T03:22:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	I'm most interested in the memory because if it boots then I'm set.  I'll know what CPU from the boot
2011-09-19T03:22:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	didn't you just say you found what memory it uses?
2011-09-19T03:22:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	has 4 dimm slots and I don't know which to use.  No manual.
2011-09-19T03:23:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	no I found what memory I happen to have lying around.
2011-09-19T03:25:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=GA-6VTXE&Cat=RAM
2011-09-19T04:08:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	well I think the gigabyte baord is dead.  I have three Tyan Tiger 230T S2507T MB's here.  Two look like they have never been used.  These have a pair of PGA370 sockets.
2011-09-19T04:09:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	that's too bad, and nice
2011-09-19T04:11:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	I just realized I inserted the memory incorrectly... should have pushed both ends but it wouldn't go so I did one end then the other.
2011-09-19T04:12:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	if there is no memeory I think the bios is suppose to beep somehow - right?
2011-09-19T04:12:00.000Z	alkafoo	terr	doing one end then the other can still work
2011-09-19T04:13:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	if I knew if the bios gives some sort of beep code if no ram then I'd be further ahead.
2011-09-19T04:14:00.000Z	terr	alkafoo	I cna yank out that old MB and install one of the tyan's.
