2008-10-31T12:20:00.000Z	leohartx		good afternoon
2008-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	leohartx		how do i format and delete and merge partition in ubuntu ?
2008-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	leohartx		i want to merge 2 partitions in NFTS into 1 partition with ext3
2008-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	format and delete ?   trying to make it unrecoverable ?
2008-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	just delete them.  and make the new one.
2008-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	leohartx	_2	but there are 1 other partition after them
2008-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	it will probably be renumbered but shouldn't hurt anything.
2008-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	what is the partition after "them" ?
2008-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	leohartx	_2	i've tried last night
2008-10-31T12:25:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	gksudo gparted #try again.
2008-10-31T12:26:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	you will have to make sure that they are not mounted.
2008-10-31T12:26:00.000Z	leohartx	_2	but after 2 partitions i want to format is another patition
2008-10-31T12:27:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	i got that the first time.
2008-10-31T12:28:00.000Z	leohartx	_2	so, do you have any solution ?
2008-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	yes dismount the file systems on the partitions in question, then delete the partitions in question, and make a new partition where the empty space is.     i think i can do that with gparted   but i'm sure i can with cfdisk
2008-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	leohartx	_2	cfdisk ?
2008-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	leohartx	_2	a command ?
2008-10-31T12:30:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	don't ask me to demonstrate though. cause i don't have any partitionl
2008-10-31T12:30:00.000Z	_2	leohartx	man cfdisk
