2011-06-18T20:02:00.000Z	mrdeb		is it safe to buy amd graphics to use with ubutnu with open drivers, or is nvidia better
2011-06-18T20:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 i would stick with nvidia
2011-06-18T20:03:00.000Z	mrdeb	dr_willis	does the open driver work well enough
2011-06-23T17:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 more ram is always good..
2011-06-23T18:00:00.000Z	mrdeb	dr_willis	not always i need to know about 512 and over
2011-06-23T18:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 for ubuntu - more then 512 would be a boon...
2011-06-23T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 untill you start doing some real work
2011-06-23T18:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 with yoru logic.. would it be help or not if the system has any ram at all... :)
2011-06-23T18:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 it helps running apps run smoother.. if nothing is running..
2011-07-21T00:54:00.000Z	mrdeb	dr_willis	so you can mount without root?
2011-07-21T00:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 via fstab yes.. theres also some fuse smb tools that  give you a dynamic 'list of all shares on the network' feature
2011-07-21T00:55:00.000Z	mrdeb	dr_willis	o you have to visudo mount too for the user
2011-07-21T00:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 Huh?
2011-07-21T00:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 the fstab file can have a 'users' option for specific mount points..
2011-07-21T00:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 allowing users to mount it.
2011-07-21T00:57:00.000Z	mrdeb	dr_willis	that is for place only. what about hwen it asks for root. will it still ask for root
2011-07-21T00:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 it depends on how you are mounting it.. you are not being clear on what you want to do.
2011-07-21T00:58:00.000Z	mrdeb	dr_willis	mounts without root
2011-07-21T00:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	mrdeb	 make a fstab entry with the users option is the normal way to mount a location as a user. ......    theres no safe way to do a 'let users mount eveyrthing with no limitations'
