2011-01-05T11:12:00.000Z	Crash1hd		Can anyone tell me if dd and ddrescue are the same program? also how long does dd take to do 100gb drive?
2011-01-05T11:13:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	ddrescue is based on a similar dd code base but with added features for recovering from a dying disk (usually)
2011-01-05T11:13:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	no
2011-01-05T11:14:00.000Z	Crash1hd	psycho_oreos	ahh ok thanks :)
2011-01-05T11:14:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	you can kill dd with a certain signal to make it show the progress but it only shows it once and for every time you issue that same kill signal
2011-01-05T11:15:00.000Z	Crash1hd	psycho_oreos	hmm the kill signal kills the process though right
2011-01-05T11:16:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	not always, some programs will act in a certain way when killed with a specific signal, such as some daemons with -sigint will cause it to reload conf files
2011-01-05T11:16:00.000Z	Crash1hd	psycho_oreos	ahh so if there is only 4gb used on the 100gb drive then rsync would be alot faster
2011-01-05T11:17:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	yes but if you wanted to also copy stuff from MBR (usually when trying to migrate one hard disk data completely to another and make the target disk bootable) you need dd for instance to at least dump the MBR
2011-01-05T11:18:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	also dd is very handy for parsing the images to forensic utilities when needing to undelete files as dd dumps blocks for blocks unlike rsync which goes by pointers and therefore visible files
2011-01-05T11:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	you need to make it ext3 first and under windows there's ext2ifs which treats ext3 as ext2 (without journaling support)
2011-01-05T11:21:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	you could rsync the entire thing and then use dd to dump the MBR which contains grub, then use the dumped image to write back which should work
2011-01-05T11:24:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	yes and no, portions of it sits inside /boot/grub but the bootloader itself is hidden in the MBR
2011-01-05T11:25:00.000Z	Crash1hd	psycho_oreos	ok which could be on /
2011-01-05T11:25:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	no its not even on /
2011-01-05T11:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	it doesn't tell you, you can only guess by judging the speed at which its going and how much spaces are left
2011-01-05T11:37:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	I'd say 10.5*1000/60 for GB per minutes
2011-01-05T11:39:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	its not denoted as binary measurement but rather Si
2011-01-05T11:39:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Crash1hd	actually I could be wrong but have a look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix
