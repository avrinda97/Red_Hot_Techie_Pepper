2009-09-11T18:19:00.000Z	trelayne		anyone know how to instal the latest version of firefox, have it autoupdate, keep my bookmarks and not have to worry too much about plugins that are already installed by synaptic?
2009-09-11T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	sudo apt-get install firefox-3.5
2009-09-11T18:19:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	really??
2009-09-11T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	if you add the firefox ppa you can install 3.7 but its very flakey
2009-09-11T18:20:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	 do I have to uninstall my current version of firefox?
2009-09-11T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	in jaunty its a seperate app. in karmic its a true upgrade
2009-09-11T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	you can keep both side by side
2009-09-11T18:20:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	 that is actually awesome..  but do they share the same bookmarks ?
2009-09-11T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	yes, they use ~/.mozilla
2009-09-11T18:21:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	also I have extension I used extensively...
2009-09-11T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	when you run te new version its compatibilty will be checked
2009-09-11T18:21:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	nice! So I simply do sudo apt-get install firefox-3.5
2009-09-11T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	indeed
2010-03-04T00:02:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	 thanks will try
2010-03-04T00:06:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	 thanks for that. So if I add new packages, it will update whatever DB it's using (sort of like what is done with "locate"?
2010-03-04T00:08:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	 you mean I have to  do "sudo apt-file update" if I add a new repo ?
2010-03-04T00:09:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	excellent, thank you so much!
2010-03-04T00:10:00.000Z	trelayne	ActionParsnip	no problem.. very useful, I remember it was built-in on mandriva
2010-08-20T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trelayne	modify /etc/apt/sources.list and comment out the lines for the repos you don't want, use a # character at the start of the line
