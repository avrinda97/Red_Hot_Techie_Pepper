2009-01-29T18:00:00.000Z	Techman83		I'm looking for a bit of information regarding the way Ubuntu 8.10 handles Xorg now, In previous versions getting Dual Screen setup as 2 X Sessions, it was as simple as commenting out Xinerama, now with no config, even setting it to false gives me no joy
2009-01-29T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	wiki.ubuntu.com/X
2009-01-29T18:01:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	thanks, I'll check it out
2009-01-29T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	wiki.ubuntu.com/X is mostly about 8.10
2009-01-29T18:25:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	most except the MultiHead section, no real references to Xinerama
2009-01-29T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	How are you trying to disable xinerama?
2009-01-29T18:27:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	before it was a case of commenting out the Xineram line, I have tried manually setting up the Xorg.conf and adding
2009-01-29T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	after adding that to the server layout, you restarted X and /var/log/Xorg.0.log still says it loaded xinerama?
2009-01-29T18:28:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	Correct, display was across both screen as opposed to 2 seperate
2009-01-29T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	erm, ServerFlags apparently is what you want to add it to?
2009-01-29T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	the log explicitly stated that xinerama was being loaded?
2009-01-29T18:30:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	under server flags
2009-01-29T18:32:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	(II) Initializing built-in extension XINERAMA
2009-01-29T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	yeah same thing here, but it recognizes the option in the log too
2009-01-29T18:35:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	i'll just give it a shot and see what the log says, should be Option "Xinerama" "0" to disable?
2009-01-29T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	yeah, that's what it /should/ be afaict, but it seems to still load here.  See what happens though
2009-01-29T18:37:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	Alrighty brb
2009-01-29T18:40:00.000Z	Techman83	jrib	I'll just have a read for the log, only got clone currently
2009-01-29T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	Techman83	what card by the way?
