2011-09-09T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CyborgSmurf	there isn't one, that's only for web access. You can put 10.0.0.1 if you want. Doesn't do anything
2011-09-09T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CyborgSmurf	you may need to leave it blank if it doesn't work
2011-09-09T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CyborgSmurf	actually leave it blank, less confusion
2011-09-09T19:30:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	ActionParsnip	I will
2011-09-09T19:30:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	ActionParsnip	how do I know if they can find each other over the cable and not the wireless(I have that too)
2011-09-09T19:36:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	ActionParsnip	thank you for the help "connection established" fivestars rate ;)
