2010-03-14T02:13:00.000Z	kocmodpom		trying to use 'automake' and get 'configure.ac' is required. ??
2010-03-14T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	 well, what do you want to accomplish?
2010-03-14T02:17:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	umm, did you read the README?
2010-03-14T02:20:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	anyway, README and README.install gives install instructions
2010-03-14T02:24:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	acicula, going through the readmeinstall again
2010-03-14T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	I remember reading that's not the first thing
2010-03-14T05:52:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	already installed xgrafix
2010-03-14T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	you linked me to xoopic earlier
2010-03-14T05:53:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	correct, step one and two of installing xoopic is download and installation of xgrafix
2010-03-14T05:54:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	step 3 says "Run ./configure"
2010-03-14T05:54:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	read the whole document...  (in the end you are probably missing some library, but that is not what README.INTALL says in xoopic-20091028.tar.gz)
2010-03-14T05:56:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	README.INSTALL from that version of xoopic you listed is exactly what I am reading from
2010-03-14T05:57:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	so where does it say to run ./configure?
2010-03-14T06:02:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	in step 3 I am trying to copy it but pastebin is horribly unresponsive but my router is dying
2010-03-14T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	I was just reading the top of the file
2010-03-14T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	since the top ends with "the rest of this file is pretty old..."
2010-03-14T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	kocmodpom	anyway, if you are missing some library, you need to install the corresponding -dev package for the library.  Also, the age of the software may be an issue.  Libraries may have changed since it was released
2010-03-14T06:17:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	my connection crapped out, I missed everything
2010-03-14T06:17:00.000Z	kocmodpom	jrib	how can I "properly install" hdf5 ??
