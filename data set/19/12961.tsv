2005-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	stein		FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Operation not permitted
2005-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	stein		Any idea why I get this ? Maybe becasue of failed update I had today ?
2005-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	have you tried doing a depmod -ae?
2005-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	stein	nuopus	no
2005-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	nuopus		try it
2005-10-06T05:09:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	or if you just recently upgraded kernel ... reboot
2005-10-06T05:09:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	or do both! lol
2005-10-06T05:09:00.000Z	stein	nuopus	 I rebooted. I tries depmod -ae , it is still the same
2005-10-06T05:10:00.000Z	stein	nuopus	it is a pretty stupid error : Operation not permitted , I am root, what else does it want ???
2005-10-06T05:10:00.000Z	nuopus		lol
2005-10-06T05:10:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	I have seen that before if the modules were not build with same symbols as the current running kernel
2005-10-06T05:10:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	but those modules are the ones from the linux-restricted package?
2005-10-06T05:11:00.000Z	stein	nuopus	so what now ? apt-get upgrade ?  Install updates ?
2005-10-06T05:11:00.000Z	stein	nuopus	I have plain hoary + some updates
2005-10-06T05:12:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	You could try that. Some reasons for that happening: ndiswrapper module compiled with symbols from a different kernel ... and .. well ... thats it!
2005-10-06T05:12:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	lol
2005-10-06T05:12:00.000Z	nuopus	stein	thats all I can think of
2005-10-06T05:12:00.000Z	nuopus		brb
2005-10-06T05:12:00.000Z	stein	nuopus	I had an update of 105 packages today, but i failed for some reason :-(
