2005-11-26T08:17:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	thanx for the pointer, even that ive used debian(ubuntu) for 2years "apt-cache source" was new to me, i LOVE LINUX ;)
2005-11-26T08:18:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	hehe
2005-11-26T08:18:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	eeh apt-get source i ment
2005-11-26T08:19:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	so "apt-get source xmms-dev" = "apt-get source xmms" ?
2005-11-26T08:19:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	yes, but for a slightly confusing reason
2005-11-26T08:19:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	sry, ment  "apt-get source xmms" = "apt-get source xmms-dev" ?
2005-11-26T08:19:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	yes
2005-11-26T08:20:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	sry im too drunk :) ment "apt-get source xmms" = "apt-get install xmms-dev" ? :)
2005-11-26T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	'apt-get install foo' installs the *binary* package foo.  each binary package comes from one source package, which is ofen, but not always, the same name as the binary package
2005-11-26T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	no
2005-11-26T08:20:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	xmms-dev is a binary package that comes from the xmms source package, same as the xmms binary package itself
2005-11-26T08:21:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	hmm, sure "xmms-dev" = the source code ?
2005-11-26T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	no
2005-11-26T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	xmms-dev is not source code
2005-11-26T08:22:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	so xmms-dev is ?
2005-11-26T08:22:00.000Z	bob2	oskude	xmms-dev is a binary package (which is confusing named, but just means that it is a .deb) that contains some xmms header files
2005-11-26T08:23:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	hmm, i have to check on this, thnx for the info!!!
2005-11-26T08:27:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	OMG im like out of my socks, but it sounds very "normal", i have compiled many apps from source code and when they needed some libs, i just installed the *-dev packages, and now when i think, yeah they only need the headers. LOL i was so "wrong" all the time,so i thank you VERY MUCH for your info :)
2005-11-26T08:29:00.000Z	oskude	bob2	but then again, when ever i needed source, was cause the deb was too "old" so i NEWER needed the source of the debs...
