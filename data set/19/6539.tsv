2010-10-16T11:45:00.000Z	OLD		Is there a way to make ubuntu look like xfc4 desktop?
2010-10-16T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	could install xfce...
2010-10-16T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	if you install xfce4 package, you won't bloat your OS with all the fluff the xubuntu-desktop package comes with
2010-10-16T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	and you can run the gnome apps you have with no issue
2010-10-16T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	install xfce4 in software centre.. gives the xfce desktop. If you install xubuntu-desktop you will have a tonne of apps which will mirror you current ones and will bloat your OS unnecessarily
2010-10-16T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	gurpreet : gives a sound advice. LXDE is sweeeeet
2010-10-16T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	could install Lubuntu and be done :)
2010-10-16T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	sure, its just lighter. Iso is 520mb and the install is about1.5gb
2010-10-16T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	and default app list
2010-10-16T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	the desktop exerts less strain on the cpu so it can run slower, using less power
2010-10-16T12:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	damn right!
2010-10-16T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	its a little OT here, this is support only dude
2010-10-16T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	arora is good too
2010-10-16T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	I use that and chromium-daily build
2010-10-16T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	yes the repo will be polled, if a new version is available you will be offered it
2010-10-16T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	ubuntu has an autoupdate tool but if you apt-get and stuff it will do the same
2010-10-16T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	chromium is the code which chrome is based on
2010-10-16T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	chrome is just stable and has the google tracker stuff in it
2010-10-16T12:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	OLD	no the browser has an ip so they know where YOU have been
