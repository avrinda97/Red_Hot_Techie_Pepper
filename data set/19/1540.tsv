2011-02-20T04:30:00.000Z	induz_		as i have Gnome alreday in my system
2011-02-20T04:32:00.000Z	induz_		actually i am more comfortable with KDElive  so i want KDE
2011-02-20T04:34:00.000Z	induz_		somehow i had lots of packages from KDE
2011-02-20T04:35:00.000Z	bazhang	induz_	it wont. just try something else, or fix the issues with kdenlive
2011-02-20T04:35:00.000Z	induz_		kdenlive is a video programm for editing
2011-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	bazhang	induz_	I know that
2011-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	induz_		kdelive is based on KDE i was told
2011-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	bazhang	induz_	it can be uses by either DE
2011-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	induz_	bazhang	it was for brontosaurusrex
2011-02-20T04:37:00.000Z	induz_	bazhang	i am too confused with this DE thing
2011-02-20T04:37:00.000Z	induz_	bazhang	i can always un-install it if i dont like it
2011-02-20T04:38:00.000Z	bazhang	induz_	better to fix the errors with kdenlive, try another editor than install all of kubuntu-desktop which is a huge install and wont fix the kdenlive issues
