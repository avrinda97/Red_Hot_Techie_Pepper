2007-04-14T14:07:00.000Z	kane77		what is the easiest way to send files on LAN? (with 2 ubuntu machines)
2007-04-14T14:07:00.000Z	variant	kane77	scp
2007-04-14T14:07:00.000Z	kane77	variant	what is that?
2007-04-14T14:08:00.000Z	variant	kane77	secure copy, uses ssh
2007-04-14T14:08:00.000Z	kane77	variant	does that require the "other side" confirmation?
2007-04-14T14:08:00.000Z	variant	kane77	you need to have the password of the remote host, thats all
2007-04-14T14:09:00.000Z	variant	kane77	scp /path/to/file user@host:/path/to/remote/file
2007-04-14T14:09:00.000Z	kane77	variant	thx, that's exactly what I need :D
2007-04-18T09:41:00.000Z	variant	kane77	wait till tomorrow...
2007-04-18T09:42:00.000Z	kane77	variant	I already started :P so there is no way back
2007-04-18T09:42:00.000Z	variant	kane77	fair enough.. shouldn't have any issues
2007-04-19T08:54:00.000Z	variant	kane77	because  /home/kane/.setup8661 does not exist
2007-04-19T08:54:00.000Z	kane77	variant	:/ the number varies each time I run installer
2007-04-19T08:55:00.000Z	variant	kane77	is enemy territory supported in 64bit?
2007-04-19T08:55:00.000Z	variant	kane77	i thought it was a 32bit app
2007-04-19T08:55:00.000Z	variant	kane77	if so then you will have to run it in a 32bit chroot
2007-04-19T08:55:00.000Z	kane77	variant	I talked with people that runs it without problems
2007-04-19T08:56:00.000Z	variant	kane77	don't know then, sorry
