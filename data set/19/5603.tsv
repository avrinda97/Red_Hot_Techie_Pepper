2008-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	HardyHuman		Hi everyone:)  I've been trying to get my Audio configured so that my soundcard will produce 5.1 surround in Hardy Heron.  I've tried a few different sites and even a package that claims to configure it properly but I've had no luck.  PulseAudio angers me

2008-06-26T05:23:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	let me just see if I have:)
2008-06-26T05:30:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	ok I was following the instructions on that page and I got a ton of similar errors
2008-06-26T05:31:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	on which step did you have those errors ?
2008-06-26T05:32:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	my scroll size is too small let me see exactly where
2008-06-26T05:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	hang on a moment, i believe i read something about libasound2, the official repo version has bugs
2008-06-26T05:33:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	alright
2008-06-26T05:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	according to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4928900 you'd want the libasound2 packages (and sources) from hardy-proposed .. might give you a way around those errors, not sure
2008-06-26T05:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	that's part A of that link
2008-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	I'm so not into this... lol I have been putting this off for a couple weeks now haha:)  Back into the trenches I go
2008-06-26T05:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	lol, not a oneline quick fix indeed, keep a clear head .. goodluck ;)
2008-06-26T05:38:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	thanks:)
2008-06-26T05:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	just an opinion, i would try to get pulseaudio going from that last link before going for the 5.1 support, that way at least you'll end up with something :p
2008-06-26T05:40:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	 hahaha well I don't even have any asound directories... this is strange
2008-06-26T05:41:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	guess I haven't gotten to that with this current install
2008-06-26T05:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	actually not that strange, for pulseaudio to run on top of ALSA you will need those though
2008-06-26T05:42:00.000Z	HardyHuman	glitsj16	I <3 ALSA
2008-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	HardyHuman	after doing those changes, this is a nice reference to get all kinds of different sound apps going with pulseaudio http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup .. didn't want to push them all in the same reply :p
