2006-01-28T13:36:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 You mean resize windows?
2006-01-28T13:37:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 just grab the edge of the window and drag
2006-01-28T13:37:00.000Z	abeee	mitrovarr	: how to set up the windows size in desktop ? its too small.. its to hard for me to see the word
2006-01-28T13:38:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 Put the mouse pointer on the edge of the window until you get an arrow pointing into a line, click and drag until the window is resized in that dimension until it is the size you want.
2006-01-28T13:40:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 Sorry, I'm just not sure what you're trying to ask about exactly.
2006-01-28T13:41:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 OH, that's easy.  Go to system, preferences, screen resolution
2006-01-28T13:44:00.000Z	abeee	mitrovarr	: i wanna using linux as my server to manage the bandwtich.. is this linux ubuntu version support it ?
2006-01-28T13:44:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 you'll have to be more specific as to what you want to do exactly.  Server for what?
2006-01-28T13:46:00.000Z	abeee	mitrovarr	: i have 20 computer in my network. and want to use linux as my server also as an router to manage all the computer bandwtich in my network... ? what i want is to everage all the bandwtich in each computer.. could i do that in ubuntu ?
2006-01-28T13:47:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 You mean file server?  File serving and routing can both be done, without problems
2006-01-28T13:47:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 stuff like configuring network bandwidth limiting will be hard to configure, though
2006-01-28T13:47:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 certainly beyond anything I know how to set up
2006-01-28T13:48:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 I wish, but I don't know any myself.  I'd just google for the specific tasks you want.  Do you want to be a file and print server to windows machines?
2006-01-28T13:49:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 Sorry, I don't know how to do that, or where there's a faq.  I guess I'd google for it.

2006-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	mitrovarr	abeee	 I don't think I can really offer much help for what you're doing, past what I've already said
