2008-02-23T13:26:00.000Z	msingh		anyone having problems with azereus on amd64?
2008-02-23T13:27:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	Umm I dunno I haven't tried it yet.. just reinstalled to 64bit I could test it if you want?
2008-02-23T13:27:00.000Z	msingh	ph0rensic	i've just installed it for the first time here .. and it crashed on runtime
2008-02-23T13:28:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	Ok Let me download real quick and see
2008-02-23T13:28:00.000Z	msingh	ph0rensic	cheers. i think im seeing the same error as this fellow https://bugs.launchpad.net/azureus/+bug/93769
2008-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	is there a 64-bit version to download?
2008-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	msingh	ph0rensic	not sure, i just installed it using apt-get without doing anything special
2008-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	Oh really? Last time I had to compile it and it worked, but that was on 32-it
2008-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	msingh	ph0rensic	ah i see. nah i didnt compile anything, just apt-get install azereus
2008-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	Ok maybe you might try compiling it
2008-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	ph0rensic		I'll try the apt way first though
2008-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	msingh		ok
2008-02-23T13:31:00.000Z	ph0rensic		Has azureus always been in the repos?
2008-02-23T13:31:00.000Z	msingh	ph0rensic	dunno
2008-02-23T13:32:00.000Z	msingh		is there another good client to try?
2008-02-23T13:33:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	DOing config ...
2008-02-23T13:34:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	Hmm hasn't crashed yet.. its open
2008-02-23T13:35:00.000Z	msingh	ph0rensic	cool. it didnt crash for me until about an hour into using it .. then restarting it, it would consistently crash on startup
2008-02-23T13:35:00.000Z	ph0rensic	msingh	I remember that happening to me on the 32 bit .. i downloaded the source and compiled it myself and had no problem, just try that would be your best bet really
