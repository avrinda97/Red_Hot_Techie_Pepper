2004-11-25T09:28:00.000Z	Manny		hi :)
2004-11-25T09:28:00.000Z	Manny		is there any alsa auto configuration script?
2004-11-25T09:30:00.000Z	Manny		while ubuntu seems to be pretty good at detecting hardware (hotplug etc.), my soundcard was installed after the installation and isn't used, although the relevant modules where modprobed automagically
2004-11-25T09:30:00.000Z	Manny		my guess is that some alsa configuration file has to be written
2004-11-25T09:32:00.000Z	Manny		alsactl: save_state:1061: No soundcards found...
2004-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	Manny		dunno what the criterion for detecting soundcards is
2004-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	Manny		in my opinion, it writes some file to /etc/alsa. I've dpkg-reconfigured some packages as well
2004-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	Manny		alsa-base, alsa-utils that is
2004-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	Manny		s^it writes^it should have written
2004-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	Manny		^
2004-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Manny	have you tried running alsaconf ?
2004-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	Manny	thoreauputic	no. None of the debs provided it
2004-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	Manny	thoreauputic	where is it?
2004-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Manny	yes, here it's in alsa-utils
2004-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Manny	but this is debian, not ubuntu
2004-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	Manny	thoreauputic	how can I traceback where a file came from with debian means? I used to use packages.debian.org.
2004-11-25T09:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Manny	if it's installed, dpkg -S alsaconf will show it
2004-11-25T09:38:00.000Z	Manny	thoreauputic	thanks
2004-11-25T09:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Manny	seems like alsa-utils is broken...
