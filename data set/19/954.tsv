2011-10-15T05:38:00.000Z	djskidd		2 problems:
2011-10-15T05:38:00.000Z	djskidd		1. Audio is broken
2011-10-15T05:39:00.000Z	djskidd		!language|swashy
2011-10-15T05:39:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	For future reference, please just keep your question on one line and don't flood
2011-10-15T05:39:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Try opening alsamixer in a terminal and see if PCM is set to zero or muted
2011-10-15T05:40:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	For the first, try the fix I suggested, for the second I'm afraid I can't help (I don't know anything about that upgrade path)
2011-10-15T05:41:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Try Ctrl+Alt+T
2011-10-15T05:42:00.000Z	djskidd	velociostrich	it says cannot open mixer: No such file or diectory
2011-10-15T05:42:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	The command is alsamixer
2011-10-15T05:43:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	alsamixer prints that? that's not something I've ever encountered
2011-10-15T05:44:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Don't worry just yet, try taking a look at the audio docs on the wiki
2011-10-15T05:44:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Worry when it's several days from now
2011-10-15T05:45:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Do try
2011-10-15T05:51:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Good to hear
2011-10-15T05:51:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	(unintentional pun)
2011-10-15T05:51:00.000Z	djskidd	velociostrich	Glad I'm not deaf
2011-10-15T05:51:00.000Z	djskidd	velociostrich	...yet
2011-10-15T05:51:00.000Z	velociostrich	djskidd	Keep your headphones down
