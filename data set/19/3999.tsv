2010-01-03T14:38:00.000Z	nmvictor		whats the command to fireup  Network Manager?
2010-01-03T14:40:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	nm-applet i think
2010-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	get download the source from their website. use apt-get to work out the deps, then built it using that source
2010-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	you don't use apt for compiling from source, in general
2010-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	ok, i have the source from their website, would you please point me to a perfet HOWTO on how i could build the deps?
2010-01-06T15:26:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	so you mean the ./configure make and make install stuff, how do i come up with a .deb with that procedure?
2010-01-06T15:28:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	there's a proper way, and there's checkinstall - replace make install with checkinstall, and install the produced deb with dpkg
2010-01-06T15:28:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	thanks, got that from maverick_
2010-01-06T15:30:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/HandsOn this is the 'proper' way
2010-01-06T15:31:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	yea, thats proper
2010-01-06T15:32:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	why?
2010-01-06T15:32:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	its not the 'right' way to do it. personally i use checkinstall for personal stuff ;p
2010-01-06T15:34:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	never. they probably have a proper build environment setup
2010-01-06T15:36:00.000Z	faileas	nmvictor	it isn't a bad direction - but it depends on what the bug is
2010-01-06T15:39:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	the kannel version from repo is same as the version from their website
2010-01-06T15:39:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	i might be wrong since the link actually talks of ubuntu 8.04
2010-01-06T15:40:00.000Z	nmvictor	faileas	http://kerneltrap.org/17017
