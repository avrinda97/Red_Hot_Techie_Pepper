2009-07-01T05:07:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart		evening folks. I was wondering if anybody could help me out with figuring out how to dual boot. I'm on ubuntu-64-jaunty and I'd like to also boot ubuntu-x86-jaunty
2009-07-01T05:09:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	Umm.. Just wondering why you would want to do that?
2009-07-01T05:10:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	dual boot? or go back to x86?
2009-07-01T05:11:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	Whyy dual boot the same system, and not use the x64 if you can?
2009-07-01T05:11:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	long story short is that I've been working with 64 for a year now... and I've had plenty of trouble. I have enough "odd" things going on that adding 64 to the mix makes things complicated.
2009-07-01T05:12:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	Whats your problems, perhaps we could help with those.
2009-07-01T05:12:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	And may I ask your ram?
2009-07-01T05:12:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	4mb ram
2009-07-01T05:12:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	With 32 bit you can only use ~3.2 gigs of it.
2009-07-01T05:13:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	for example, I'm using dual monitors with an intel gma card... which made that difficult...
2009-07-01T05:13:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	I'm now having problems with all of my video applications... none of them seem to work.
2009-07-01T05:13:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	I can't play .wmv, .mov etc
2009-07-01T05:13:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	May I suggest a fresh reinstall? I Mean... you might aswell run one Jaunty... or give another distro a try. =o
2009-07-01T05:14:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	my fear is the lack of a system.... that's the reason i wanted to dual boot..
2009-07-01T05:14:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	Lack of a system meaning?
2009-07-01T05:15:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	I have a vista machine that is my wife's to fall back on... but even after a year of ubuntu and installing things and working on configuring things manually to try to understand things... I'm not confident in my ability to wipe things out
2009-07-01T05:15:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	I'm sure I'd do just fine wiping things out.. ;-)
2009-07-01T05:16:00.000Z	coleys	AndrewGearhart	Ah... That's why I would suggest an easy replacement for such sort of things.
2009-07-01T05:17:00.000Z	AndrewGearhart	coleys	when I first installed ubuntu it took me a day because I had two drives... an IDE and a SATA... and the build of grub caused it to try to boot to the IDE drive... where an old install of windows lives partially crippled
