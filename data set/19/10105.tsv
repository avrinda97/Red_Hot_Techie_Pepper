2006-07-27T15:30:00.000Z	Zyfo		I want to be able to write on a media hd of mine but it tells me I don't have the permissions. Afaik I've already logged in as the owner, what must I do for ubuntu to understand I'm the owner?
2006-07-27T15:30:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	and you did sudo?
2006-07-27T15:30:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	and your on root?
2006-07-27T15:31:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	nope, this is in the GUI when I right click on the hd
2006-07-27T15:31:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	what is in the gui? an error pops up?
2006-07-27T15:32:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	the option boxes are grey and on the bottom it just says "You are not the owner, so you can't change these permissions" no place where you can type your password as I can see.
2006-07-27T15:32:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	you mean under the permissions tab?
2006-07-27T15:32:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	yes
2006-07-27T15:33:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	can you change the owner in the drop-down? or is it grey?
2006-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	there's nothing about owner in the drop-down menu.
2006-07-27T15:42:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	could I perhaps change it via terminal? It is called media\hba1. What would the command be for that?
2006-07-27T15:43:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	sudo chmod -R media/hdb1 755
2006-07-27T15:43:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	tell me how it goes
2006-07-27T15:44:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	chmod: invalid mode: `media/hdb1'
2006-07-27T15:44:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	sudo chmod -R /media/hdb1 755
2006-07-27T15:45:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	invalid mode again.
2006-07-27T15:45:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	man chmod
2006-07-27T15:45:00.000Z	roostishaw	Zyfo	good luck man, sorry i douldn't help  :(
2006-07-27T15:45:00.000Z	Zyfo	roostishaw	thanks anyway, :<
