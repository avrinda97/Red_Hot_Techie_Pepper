2008-07-13T00:40:00.000Z	mavsman4457		I accidentally removed the network manager from my top panel, how do I put it back?
2008-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	try right-click on panel and "Add to panel"
2008-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	(assuming you use gnome)
2008-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	I did that but then I don't know whihink it's in that listch applet to choose, I don't t
2008-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	sorry typo
2008-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	I don't think the network manager applet is in thhat list
2008-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	do you have network-manager-gnome package installed?
2008-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	ummm, if it's not installed by default then no
2008-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	you are talking about the applet used to select wifi networks, right?
2008-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	you said you "removed it from the top panel", does that mean you right-clicked and selected "remove from panel"?
2008-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	or that it just disappeared?
2008-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	ya I thought it would be really easy to add back but the " network manager"
2008-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	yes I removed it manually
2008-07-13T00:45:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	then it should be in the "add to panel" list
2008-07-13T00:45:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	there is a network manager in the list when I click add to panel but it's not the right one
2008-07-13T00:45:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	it's different and doesn't function the same way
2008-07-13T00:45:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	the applet that shows network activity in a nice graph is _not_ the network manager applet. you are not talking about that, right?
2008-07-13T00:46:00.000Z	mavsman4457	abli	what?
2008-07-13T00:46:00.000Z	abli	mavsman4457	what did the applet you removed look like?
