2007-11-30T03:50:00.000Z	kruvalig		i want to start program trought ssh and logout, but i need to program still work. How can i do it?
2007-11-30T03:50:00.000Z	kruvalig		when i logout program stop
2007-11-30T03:51:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	if it's a shell program use screen <program> then detach screen with C-a C-D
2007-11-30T03:54:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	yeah screen will work for that
2007-11-30T03:55:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	C=ctrl by the way
2007-11-30T03:55:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	ctrl+a then ctrl+d
2007-11-30T03:56:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	ctrl+a puts screen in command mode
2007-11-30T03:58:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	screen works the same on any distro but fedora does do some odd things can ask in #fedora
2007-11-30T03:59:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	are you running rtorrent in screen?
2007-11-30T03:59:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	did you type screen rtorrent to start rtorrent inside screen?
2007-11-30T03:59:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	or just screen
2007-11-30T04:00:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	since ctrl+a will do nothing you need to press ctrl+d after ctrl+a
2007-11-30T04:01:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	you should see something that states [detached]
2007-11-30T04:01:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	ok your doing it wrong that's why
2007-11-30T04:01:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	screen rtorrent is the command you want
2007-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	I know
2007-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	type screen rtorrent and then ctrl+a ctrl+d and then logout and it will work
2007-11-30T04:04:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	screen is wonderful if you use a lot of console apps or want to have multiple "windows" open in just one console
2007-11-30T04:06:00.000Z	kitche	kruvalig	screen -r to reattach it to detach it the same way as you did before
