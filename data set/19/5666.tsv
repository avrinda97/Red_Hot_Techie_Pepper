2008-05-19T12:38:00.000Z	domino14_		so ok
2008-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	domino14_		the md5 checksum of my install cd is good
2008-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	domino14_		but my ubuntu is doing very bad things
2008-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	domino14_		what should i do?
2008-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	domino14_		shadow420: real hardware
2008-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	domino14_		fresh install
2008-05-19T12:40:00.000Z	domino14_		it mostly has to do with my firewire HD .. i cant copy from it using nautilus without it hanging
2008-05-19T12:40:00.000Z	domino14_		and then i kill nautilus, and it never comes back, and i have to restart my computer
2008-05-19T12:40:00.000Z	domino14_		and if i try copying using cp -a, it also hangs and stops copying after a couple of files
2008-05-19T12:40:00.000Z	domino14_		someone suggested my install was corrupt, but the cd checks out
2008-05-19T12:41:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	does the iso check out too?
2008-05-19T12:42:00.000Z	domino14_	m0u5e	-- i dont know, i did a fresh install :)
2008-05-19T12:43:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	i mean your original iso cd image... did you md5sum the file?
2008-05-19T12:43:00.000Z	domino14_	m0u5e	no i didnt, i left it on my computer and then reformatted with the ubuntu install
2008-05-19T12:43:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	:(
2008-05-19T12:44:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	i'd just try reinstalling... is it a laptop? were you moving it around as it burned? etc
2008-05-19T12:45:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	depends on what kind problems your having...
2008-05-19T12:45:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	i don't know, sometimes a reinstall will magically fix things for me
2008-05-19T12:45:00.000Z	m0u5e	domino14_	did you install a bunch of packages? etc
