2010-04-22T07:56:00.000Z	wyclif		I just tried installing Karmic on an IBM T40 laptop that I was running the full Ubuntu Karmic on successfully, but now I've got a broken system and right now I'm running off the live CD trying to get help; I cannot now boot from the HDD
2010-04-22T07:58:00.000Z	wyclif		I cannot even boot into recovery mode; I get an error stating "device not found", when I press Enter I'm back at the grub menu
2010-04-22T07:59:00.000Z	wyclif		so right now I'm running off the Live CD trying to figure out why I can't boot from my HDD
2010-04-22T08:00:00.000Z	wyclif		anybody good with boot issues?
2010-04-22T08:00:00.000Z	randomusr_	wyclif	yes I put mine on every day
2010-04-22T08:01:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	hahaha
2010-04-22T08:01:00.000Z	randomusr_	wyclif	what's the issue?
2010-04-22T08:03:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	no it's an IBM thinkpad laptop
2010-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	randomusr_	wyclif	how old is it?
2010-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	not sure but I'm guessing 4-5 years
2010-04-22T08:05:00.000Z	randomusr_	wyclif	are you the original owner? Has it run Windows fine?
2010-04-22T08:05:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	it's run *everything* fine before
2010-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	I ran memtest a few minutes ago, also tried using help on the CD, maybe I will have to bust out the Knoppix later?
2010-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	randomusr_	wyclif	also, you may want to attempt installing Karmic with the alternate cd
2010-04-22T08:07:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	alternate CD?
2010-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	here's a question: when I set my BIOS settings to boot from the CD, after I eject the disc and reboot do I have to reset BIOS to "boot from HDD"
2010-04-22T08:10:00.000Z	randomusr_	wyclif	no as long as the cd is out. This is more of a convenience feature than overall functionality
2010-04-22T08:10:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	for some reason I can't reset the boot order in BIOS settings
2010-04-22T08:16:00.000Z	wyclif	randomusr_	I forgot to mention that it's xubuntu not standard ubuntu
