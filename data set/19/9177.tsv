2009-08-12T20:22:00.000Z	fabio_		I need help
2009-08-12T20:22:00.000Z	fabio_		I run Ubuntu and i can't get into gnome
2009-08-12T20:23:00.000Z	fabio_		I run ubuntu and I cannot get into gnome. It gives me a blue screen with a message that says something like: "The system has failed for graphical login for more than 60 seconds. It is likely that something bad is going on".
2009-08-12T20:23:00.000Z	fabio_		I'm using another computer now
2009-08-12T20:23:00.000Z	fabio_		mike: im not a big computer expert- i define it as i don't get to the graphical login
2009-08-12T20:23:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	sounds like something went haywire with X or the video card driver
2009-08-12T20:25:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	sounds like the updates borked your video drivers
2009-08-12T20:29:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	boot into recovery mode and run xfix and see if you can get back to the login
2009-08-12T20:30:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	if that works, you'll need to install the drivers again
2009-08-12T20:30:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	when it boots you should see a message about press ESC to enter grub
2009-08-12T20:31:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	some should save something about recovery or single user mode
2009-08-12T20:32:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	save = say
2009-08-12T20:32:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	ok
2009-08-12T20:33:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	worry about that later, its for sound
2009-08-12T20:36:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	beyond me then, something is messed up but not sure what to suggest as I have ati cards
2009-08-12T20:36:00.000Z	fabio_	Halitech	it's ok mate. thank u very much. i will just reinstall Ubuntu
2009-08-12T20:36:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	do you have a seperate home partition?
2009-08-12T20:37:00.000Z	Halitech	fabio_	ok, I *think* I heard that you can reinstall without losing home now in 9.04 but I don't recall how it was done other then unchecking the option to format home
