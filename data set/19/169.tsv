2012-07-24T00:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj		well, leave the cable plugged in and type this in the terminal, ifconfig
2012-07-24T00:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj		boghiu,^
2012-07-24T00:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj		boghiu,ok , then after that type , sudo dhclient eth0
2012-07-24T00:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj		cable
2012-07-24T00:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj		jf he's try to fix an ethernet NIC with no cable
2012-07-24T00:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj		_jdccdevel,
2012-07-24T00:12:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	Yeh, I see it.
2012-07-24T00:49:00.000Z	BluesKaj	_jdccdevel	I suggested he boot in with his ubuntu cd with cable plufgged in and update and upgrade
2012-07-24T00:50:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	the problem is that ifup doesn't know about the eth0 interface. It's not in the interfaces file.
2012-07-24T00:50:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	all he needs to do is add "auto eth0" to the bottom
2012-07-24T00:52:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	It did, I checked that first. eth0 is there, and the driver "forcedeth" is loaded
2012-07-24T00:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	_jdccdevel	you mean /etc/network/interfaces file ?
2012-07-24T00:52:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	yes
2012-07-24T00:54:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	nothing at all in interfaces about eth0. "cat /etc/network/interfaces | grep eth0" returns nothing
2012-07-24T00:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	_jdccdevel	I'll bet the interfaces file didn't get written during the install because there was no cable connected to the internet
2012-07-24T00:55:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	it's still there for lo
2012-07-24T01:29:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	Is the PC you're using now windows? or Linux?
2012-07-24T01:30:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	sorry, wrong person.
2012-07-24T02:25:00.000Z	_jdccdevel	BluesKaj	do you know how to troubleshoot a pppoe connection?
