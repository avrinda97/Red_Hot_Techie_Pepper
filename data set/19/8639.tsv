2007-03-03T17:49:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	could somebody send me crossover office?
2007-03-03T17:51:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	Crossover office isn't free, that'd be illegal.  Are you sure you need it?  And OpenOffice (or others) can't do what you need?
2007-03-03T17:53:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	i need crossover office to run world of warcraft
2007-03-03T17:53:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	You don't.  WoW works on wine just fine.
2007-03-03T17:54:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	it doesnt work for me
2007-03-03T17:55:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	It works for everyone else, so it is possible.  You should try asking in #winehq, theyd be able to help, quite aptly, I imagine
2007-03-03T17:55:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	okay thanks
2007-03-03T06:03:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	lol nobody in winehq will help
2007-03-03T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	Check the forums (ubuntuforums.org), theres a few step by step howtos there
2007-03-03T12:42:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	this isn't a crossover office support channel, try asking in #crossover
2007-03-03T12:42:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	they dont say anything back

2007-03-06T06:24:00.000Z	K3nto	Flannel	just the desktop will work?
2007-03-06T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	make it a new folder.  So, on your desktop make a folder "mydisk" then mount to ~/Desktop/mydisk/
2007-03-06T09:02:00.000Z	Flannel	K3nto	help.ubuntu.com/community/RPM/AlienHowto
