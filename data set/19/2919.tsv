2009-12-10T07:55:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		i just installed nvidia drivers now my ubuntu will not boot up
2009-12-10T07:55:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		all i get is the command line
2009-12-10T07:57:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		kde/gnome
2009-12-10T07:57:00.000Z	ae86-drifter		kubuntu is like vista for linux
2009-12-10T07:57:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ae86-drifter	I disagree.
2009-12-10T07:57:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	SpaceGhostC2C	it uses enough resources
2009-12-10T07:59:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	SpaceGhostC2C	in my opinion
2009-12-10T08:00:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	SpaceGhostC2C	prefers kde, as he has a supercomputer
2009-12-10T08:01:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ae86-drifter	I'd be very verbose about it being your opinion and that it isn't necessarily the best for every user. ps, I don't think it matters much that you have a computer with lots of resources, at least not to me.
2009-12-10T08:02:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	SpaceGhostC2C	resources are very precious on a 486
2009-12-10T08:03:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ae86-drifter	so I'd be very careful about saying that kde is best. I'd present it and inform them about it's resource requirements as you see them.
2009-12-10T08:45:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ae86-drifter	try putting sudo in front.

2009-12-10T09:00:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ae86-drifter	I don't think I can help you. I don't use sshfs.
