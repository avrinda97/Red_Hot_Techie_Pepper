2005-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	HiddenWolf		FC3 is sucky. :-P
2005-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	It's not a bad distro, but, well, it's not Ubuntu. :)
2005-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apokryphos	it's as windows as linux can get, that's what makes it bad. :-P
2005-03-03T11:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	Hehe, yeah. I think nowadays they're primarily aiming to get the masses in. Aims are quite different to those of slack/debian/gentoo
2005-03-03T11:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	And, of course, dragging in the masses means GUI and user-friendly galore.
2005-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	I don't see why; bugs are *very* rare, and it's not compulsory to update.
2005-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apokryphos	there are about 142 release critical bugs that 'have' to be fixed before final hoary.
2005-03-21T09:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	Heh. Nice to know they've shyed away from me.
2005-03-29T11:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	what hannes_ said and cat /etc/version
2005-03-30T06:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	ubuntu > can run kde programs.
2005-08-12T09:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	all very debatable, of course =)
2005-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apokryphos	bah, everything is debatable
2005-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	not really; I'm talking about a substantiated discussion from either side
2005-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apokryphos	yeah, well. There is substantiated debate about a load of things. Including which distro rocks hardest. :)
2005-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	there is. And? :S
2005-08-12T09:55:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apokryphos	just tell people what's the way you do it, or you believe it's best, and if it's muddy, tell em to form their own opinion. :)
2005-08-12T09:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	point is, sudo and su use the same security system; so in general they're both subject to the same flaws and strengths
2005-08-12T09:56:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apokryphos	true, but ubuntu seems to like sudo, so i'll just piont anyone to that wiki page.
2005-08-12T09:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	HiddenWolf	I wasn't arguing with that, at all :). I like sudo (I prefer it). Your point that it was more secure was questionable. Heh, this has gone on          -_)
