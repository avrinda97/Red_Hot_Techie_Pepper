2008-07-11T19:21:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Hi. I understand to run a script I type either ./<scriptname> but what if I want to run it from a different directory? <pathname>/./<scriptname> doesnt work
2008-07-11T19:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	is <pathname>/<scriptname>
2008-07-11T19:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	. stands for the current directory so when you type ./scriptname you are actually telling the shell /pathname/scriptname
2008-07-11T19:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	the same gfoes for .. (parent directory) or ~ (home directory) they are alias
2008-11-20T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	ls -1
2010-02-06T23:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	why not just install from repositories ?
2010-02-06T23:38:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	Because the version in the hardy repos is 2.4.1 and it wont open an MTS file I need to edit.
2010-02-06T23:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	maybe getdev has a newer version of some ppa ? compiling should be the last option
2010-02-06T23:39:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	What is getdev?
2010-02-06T23:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	getdeb is a webpage but i just checked they do not have avidemux 2.5 for hardy only 2.4.4
2010-02-06T23:42:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	I could try 2.4.4 I suppose. It is newer than 2.4.1 which is what I have currently
2010-02-06T23:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	http://old.getdeb.net/app/Avidemux
2010-02-06T23:43:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	I will try that. Thanks. If it doesnt do what I need and I need to compile it from source would you be able to help me?
2010-02-06T23:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	I already have backports in my software sources
2010-02-06T23:47:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	Thanks. I will try that
2010-02-07T03:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	x86_64 --> 64 bits
2010-02-07T03:07:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	erUSUL	Does that mean my computer is 64 bit or my OS is 64 bit?
2010-02-07T03:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	well your os is 64 bits and that implies that your cpu is 64 bits too
2010-02-07T03:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	JonathanEllis	no problem
