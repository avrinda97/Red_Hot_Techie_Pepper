2007-01-16T07:22:00.000Z	soundray	Smirnov	is your disk full?
2007-01-16T07:24:00.000Z	soundray	Smirnov	log in on the text console and look for error messages in $HOME/.xsession-errors
2007-01-16T07:25:00.000Z	Smirnov	soundray	nothing really
2007-01-16T07:25:00.000Z	Smirnov	soundray	Registering your session with wtmp... running :usr/bin./sessreg ...... Beginning session setup
2007-01-16T07:25:00.000Z	Smirnov	soundray	just 3 lines, no "fatal errors" or anything
2007-01-16T07:26:00.000Z	soundray	Smirnov	maybe create a new user ('sudo adduser test'), then try and log in as that.
2007-01-16T07:27:00.000Z	Smirnov	soundray	shit.. that works...
2007-01-16T07:28:00.000Z	Smirnov	soundray	excellent. i had a file ~/.xsession and it didnt like that
