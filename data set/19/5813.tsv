2008-11-18T00:17:00.000Z	severb		After upgrading to 8.10 my custom keyboard layout doesn't load anymore and the /etc/X11/xkb directory it's almost empty. I understand that this version uses HAL for input stuff, but does anyone knows how to customize my keyboard layout again?
2008-11-18T00:18:00.000Z	fde	severb	same way you did it before... System > Preferences > Keyboard
2008-11-18T00:18:00.000Z	fde	severb	"layouts" tab
2008-11-18T00:18:00.000Z	severb	fde	I edited my files to create a new layout, a combination between Romanian and Dvorak
2008-11-18T00:18:00.000Z	fde	severb	I dunno where such files will go... did you put them back into the directory you stated?
2008-11-18T00:22:00.000Z	severb	fde	I've edited /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/ro and /etc/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.xml to create my custom layout, but in 8.10 xkb is missing rules and symbols directories
2008-11-18T00:24:00.000Z	fde	severb	uhh... then create them  :/
2008-11-18T01:08:00.000Z	severb	fde	no results
2008-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	fde	severb	try asking in #xorg
2008-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	fde	severb	I'm fairly sure they weren't moved though  :/
2008-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	severb	fde	i've asked and they said they said there are in the same place!
2008-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	fde	severb	ok... then they are... why can't you just create the files yourself?
2008-11-18T01:06:00.000Z	fde	severb	just cuz they weren't created for you doesn't mean its not the right config file  :/
2008-11-18T01:06:00.000Z	severb	fde	they can't be, because that directory doesn't exists now
2008-11-18T01:06:00.000Z	fde	severb	then make it  :/
2008-11-18T01:07:00.000Z	severb	fde	the base.xml file had other name, and all the layouts are missing, they can't be hardcoded in the X
2008-11-18T01:07:00.000Z	fde	severb	ok... keep arguing with the xorg developers then...
2008-11-18T01:09:00.000Z	fde	severb	then throw the whole file in there that you backed up
2008-11-18T01:16:00.000Z	severb	fde	if anyone else asks, /etc/X11/xkb has moved to /usr/share/X11/xkb/
