2007-03-11T07:40:00.000Z	variant		feisty automatic codec downloading is excellent, just though I would drop that in :)
2007-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	nope, I used it for adding partitions in the unused space
2007-03-11T07:14:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	how did you install exactly?
2007-03-11T07:14:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	try booting in safe mode, I am not aware of any situation where a normal ubuntu isntallation would damage the windows install unless you actualy perform some action to do so
2007-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	did you use the cd to resize the partitions?
2007-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	I'm sure its something I did, but I can not understand what....
2007-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	what version of windows is it? vista?
2007-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	did you resize the parititons?
2007-03-11T07:17:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	well, i reccomend you boot to safe mode in windows if you havent already tried that
2007-03-11T07:18:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	I'm gonna try....
2007-03-11T07:23:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	still the same problem: unaccessible boot device
2007-03-11T07:23:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	windows is on /dev/hda1 wich is marked as bootable....
2007-03-11T07:24:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	if you have a windows xp cd handy i suggest you use it's rescue mode (this will wite the ubuntu bootloader so you will have to re install grub via the live cd)
2007-03-11T07:24:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	windows 2000 will do? that's what's installed
2007-03-11T07:25:00.000Z	variant	TheHobbit	if it's cd has a rescue mode then yes
2007-03-11T07:31:00.000Z	TheHobbit	variant	ok, it has an option 'Recover a win2000 installation', I'll try it :s
