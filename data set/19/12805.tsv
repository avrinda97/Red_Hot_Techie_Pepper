2006-07-21T06:23:00.000Z	shiv		I really love the clock screensaver in KDE how do I get it to work for Gnome?
2006-07-21T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	I think you need kscreensaver to use it
2006-07-21T06:26:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	it is somehow possible to use kscreensaver instead of xscreensaver
2006-07-21T06:27:00.000Z	shiv	mwe	I think it installed fine but where do I find it?
2006-07-31T05:01:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	you can mount an iso out of the box
2006-07-31T05:02:00.000Z	shiv	mwe	how? just right click?
2006-07-31T05:02:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	I don't know about clicking. sudo mount -o loop /path/to/isofile /mnt should do it
2006-08-04T05:49:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	paste.ubuntu-nl.org your /etc/fstab
2006-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	shiv	mwe	I did that fstab
2006-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	what?
2006-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	you pasted it?
2006-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	URL?
2006-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	paste the URL here. paste.buntu-nl.org/123456 or whatever
2006-08-04T05:54:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19646
2006-08-04T05:54:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	change it to what I pasted
2006-08-04T05:56:00.000Z	shiv	mwe	u just removed the -3g?
2006-08-04T05:56:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	no
2006-08-04T05:56:00.000Z	mwe	shiv	changed umask to something sensible as well
2006-08-04T06:02:00.000Z	shiv	mwe	this is what I get
