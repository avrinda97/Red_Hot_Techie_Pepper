2006-10-21T08:53:00.000Z	halfsusi		is there a fix for that?
2006-10-21T08:54:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	you still use doom legacy?
2006-10-21T08:54:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	What should I use?
2006-10-21T08:55:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	im using the doomsday engine, and doom 2 looks so good in it
2006-10-21T08:55:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	Multiplayer is broken with 1.9.0-beta4
2006-10-21T08:55:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	try typing deng in synaptic ;)
2006-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	Doomsday is useless for my purposes now that it is broken
2006-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	oh...
2006-10-21T08:57:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	So, in fact, I need the prettiest and easiest to use sourceport with a working multiplayer
2006-10-21T08:57:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	but there are like hundreds of other ports out there, doom legacy is kind of old, and the most recent linux compile sound system doesnt work
2006-10-21T08:58:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	Like what? prboom does not work with opengl in this machine. Or how does one enable opengl in it?
2006-10-21T08:58:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	you can still use doomlegacy, without sound and play multi there
2006-10-21T08:58:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit		i havent been in doom matches lately
2006-10-21T08:59:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	What I am trying to do is to have my kid brother and his visiting cousin playing co-op
2006-10-21T08:59:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit		hmm... aside from playing the game in windows, you could try to disable the sounds, i did that once, but, wait... lemme check the forums again for that...
2006-10-21T09:00:00.000Z	halfsusi	Negative_Infinit	This machine has no windows, the other machine has only windows

2006-10-21T09:02:00.000Z	Negative_Infinit	halfsusi	i forgot the keyword for disabling the sounds, anyway, you can try typing something like gldoom --help and then run the game with the no sound option
