2008-11-29T01:53:00.000Z	amh		is there a way to do a fresh install of 8.10 from command line?  i think i have a corrupt installation and i tried to dist-update but it tells me there is nothing to update.
2008-11-29T01:54:00.000Z	amh		fresh install without a cd, i should say.  just internet connection
2008-11-29T01:55:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	You can install it a few ways yes, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation  gives you all sorts of options
2008-11-29T01:56:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	oh, maybe a usbstick is the way.  i tried that already but it wouldnt boot.  i'll check that ink.
2008-11-29T02:33:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation  did that not cover it?
2008-11-29T02:33:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	there were so many options.  i wasnt sure which one to work with.
2008-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	i'd just like to reinstall.  it seems to difficult.
2008-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	They all will work.  They just depend on what you have at your disposal, etc.  That page is all about reinstalling.
2008-11-29T02:35:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	i didnt see anything on reinstalling
2008-11-29T02:35:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	That entire page is about installing.  Which is identical to reinstalling.
2008-11-29T02:35:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	is there not a way to force a dist-update?
2008-11-29T02:36:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	What do you mean?
2008-11-29T02:38:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	If its already upgraded, then its up to date.  There's nothing to upgrade.  You mean reinstall those packages?  You'd have to just reinstall all of your packages.  It'd be... not so nice.  But, I guess you could try it.  see --reinstall, and I guess use globbing.

2009-01-27T12:14:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	it seems there more arguing going on than helping :/
2009-01-27T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage, removing it doesn't do a whole lot
2009-01-27T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	I'm no good at very many GUI related issues, sorry.
2009-01-27T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	amh	Try switching to ctrl-alt-f1, logging in, then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, then 'startx'
2009-01-27T13:02:00.000Z	amh	Flannel	tried that. that screen is all screwy... i see a mouse cursor and hear the harddrive going...
