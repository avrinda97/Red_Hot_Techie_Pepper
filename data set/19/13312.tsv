2005-10-23T07:58:00.000Z	gusto5		] BreliC[, what happens? the cusped disappears after you get it?!
2005-10-23T07:59:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	then all of a sudden, the cupsd no longer appears to be running, even though there is no error when i restart it
2005-10-23T08:00:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	can't seem to, no.  really strange
2005-10-23T08:01:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	ouch!
2005-10-23T08:01:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	well, it no longer works now.. it says The CUPS server could not be contacted... which makes sense because it doesn't appear to be running
2005-10-23T08:02:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	frustrating, isn't it?
2005-10-23T08:05:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	Lexmark z605.  it worked in Hoary without a hitch, and in Breezy for a few days... but now nothing
2005-10-23T08:08:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	hmm, i seem to have kind of fixed it
2005-10-23T08:08:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	i managed to start the cupsd again.  but i still can't access it from the laptop
2005-10-23T08:10:00.000Z	] BreliC[	gusto5	what do i have to set on the server side to allow network printing?  only to allow the LAN location (near the bottom of the cupsd.conf)?
