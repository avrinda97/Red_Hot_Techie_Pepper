2007-11-20T05:52:00.000Z	evil_tech		how do i get the desktop cube to look like a cube? i have more than two workspaces
2007-11-20T05:52:00.000Z	randorfer	evil_tech	 do you have compiz-settings-manager installed?
2007-11-20T05:54:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  double click on your ipod (it should open and show all files on it)
2007-11-20T05:54:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  that could be?  ive never worked with one that was synced with a mac
2007-11-20T05:56:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  try adding a different song (maybe that song is already on there ?)
2007-11-20T05:57:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn_selig:  try opening your ipod in rythmbox and pulling songs off of it
2007-11-20T05:57:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn_selig:  if that works you can pull them all of, sync it with a pc and then it should work in the way I described before
2007-11-20T05:58:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn_selig:  same sort of way I was describing before, open up rythmbox, double click on your ipod and then drag the songs to you music folder
2007-11-20T05:59:00.000Z	evil_tech	randorfer	i looked in the settings manager for compiz and couldnt find anything for number of sides
2007-11-20T05:59:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  wonderfull (that the exact way it *should* work to put them on after you format it with a pc)
2007-11-20T06:00:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  I do not know how to do that if you can!
2007-11-20T06:00:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  I would just find a windows computer, install itunes on it and sync with it(it will re-format it)
2007-11-20T06:00:00.000Z	randorfer		shawn:  yes that is the idea!
2007-11-20T06:02:00.000Z	evil_tech		i tried increasing the number of desktops under general tab in compiz settings and still no cube
2007-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	randorfer	evil_tech	 Do you have compiz-settings-manager installed?
2007-11-20T06:03:00.000Z	randorfer	evil_tech	 obviously you do if you increased them under general tab.  Ok then, make sure you have cube selected and rotate cube
2007-11-20T06:04:00.000Z	evil_tech		i do still no cube
2007-11-20T06:04:00.000Z	evil_tech		should i logout and then back in
2007-11-20T06:04:00.000Z	randorfer	evil_tech	 under system->preferences->apperance->visual effects do you have custom selected
