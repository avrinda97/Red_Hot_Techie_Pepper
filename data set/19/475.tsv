2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Stelpa	  greetings

2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Stelpa	  details...
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		i can't use the package manager anymore
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		ok
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		here is the error: E: vlc: Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should  reinstall it before attempting a removal.
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		i can't use the package manager at all
2012-02-23T05:51:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	dpkg: error processing vlc (--purge):
2012-02-23T05:51:00.000Z	Stelpa		 Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should
2012-02-23T05:51:00.000Z	Stelpa		 reinstall it before attempting a removal.
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	Stelpa		also, a big problem is that someone had uploaded a vlc 2.0 .deb file
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	Stelpa		this is why it's screwed up i think :|
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	Stelpa		they had a different version of C than me or something?
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Stelpa	  vlc 2.0 isn't in package manager
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	i really wanted vlc 2.0, even though my system is too old for it, but someone made a .deb file for me, and it didn't work
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Stelpa	  vlc 2.0 isn't in *software center*
