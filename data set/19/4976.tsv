2008-10-15T23:06:00.000Z	AlexMax		I'm having trouble with GNOME.  If I click on the date/time in the upper right hand corner of the screen, I used to get a calendar.  Now all it does is lock up the entire taskbar and i have to kill X and relogin to get it working again.  Help!
2008-10-15T23:07:00.000Z	davismj	AlexMax	are you wearing a red cap
2008-10-15T23:08:00.000Z	AlexMax	misteralexander	Did nothing
2008-10-15T23:08:00.000Z	AlexMax		I'm assuming I have to remove it first?
2008-10-15T23:08:00.000Z	AlexMax		And isn't it a dependency of ubuntu-desktop?
2008-10-15T23:09:00.000Z	AlexMax	misteralexander	I can't remove it, ubuntu-desktop depends on gnome-applets
2008-10-15T23:10:00.000Z	AlexMax		actually aptitude is giving me an option to downgrade it
2008-10-15T23:10:00.000Z	AlexMax		from 22.2 to 22.1
2008-10-15T23:11:00.000Z	AlexMax		didn't work
2008-10-15T23:11:00.000Z	davismj		alexmax wears a cap!
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		Actually my methodology is faulty
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		I downgraded without restarting X
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		and I already upgraded back (because of a noficiation that said i was out of date)
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		but it should be 'reinstalled' in that case
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		so let me try again
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	davismj		!alexmax wears a cap
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		dont apologize
2008-10-15T23:12:00.000Z	AlexMax		the only other guy talking to me is spouting nonsense
2008-10-15T23:13:00.000Z	davismj	AlexMax	what the heck, don't name yourself after a nickelodeon character and then not fulfill the persona. you wear a red cap and melt when you need to slip under doors!
