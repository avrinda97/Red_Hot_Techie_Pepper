2008-12-16T04:04:00.000Z	Formode		Dear internet conncetion, I hate you. :( You are so slow.
2008-12-16T04:05:00.000Z	deever	Formode	i'm not your internet connection...! ;)
2008-12-16T04:06:00.000Z	deever	Formode	btw, do you have Xen running?
2008-12-16T04:06:00.000Z	Formode	deever	I'm not certain what Xen is, one moment
2008-12-16T04:07:00.000Z	deever	Formode	so you haven't it ruuning...;)
2008-12-16T04:11:00.000Z	Formode	deever	Should I be running it? :) Is it good? I dislike VMware so.
2008-12-16T04:12:00.000Z	deever	Formode	do you know VirtualBox?
2008-12-16T04:12:00.000Z	Formode	deever	*Drools* Is it a form of baked good? Otherwise no I don't.
2008-12-16T04:14:00.000Z	deever	Formode	http://www.virtualbox.org
2008-12-16T04:14:00.000Z	Formode	deever	Great! Now I just need to figure out how to uninstall VMware. :D
2008-12-16T04:15:00.000Z	deever	Formode	?
2008-12-16T04:15:00.000Z	Formode	deever	Do you know how I could uninstall VMWARE? :(
2008-12-16T04:15:00.000Z	deever	Formode	are you guests of the same arch as the host?
2008-12-16T04:16:00.000Z	Formode	deever	I don't have any. I stopped using it awhile ago. :D
2008-12-16T04:17:00.000Z	deever	Formode	the advantage of vmware is that you can run guests of a different arch to the host's one with it, afaik
2008-12-16T04:18:00.000Z	deever	Formode	if you don't need that, virtualbox is an real alternative
2008-12-16T04:18:00.000Z	Formode	deever	I'm x86/64bit, and I find VMWARE incredibly intrusive.
