2010-03-14T07:22:00.000Z	karan		:(
2010-03-14T07:22:00.000Z	karan		sorry
2010-03-14T07:22:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 What's the problem?
2010-03-14T07:23:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 There are 2 flash packages, did you alternate to see if one works better than the other?
2010-03-14T07:24:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Look in the repositories, and install the one there. It's distro specific so probably works better. Uninstall the one you got from the site first.
2010-03-14T07:24:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Maybe hardware can't handle it. Has it ever played smoothly on that machine?
2010-03-14T07:25:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Is it just flash? Or HD video files too? Then maybe your video drivers aren't set up properly.
2010-03-14T07:26:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Like I said, install the flash package that is in the ubuntu repo
2010-03-14T07:27:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 You said you installed from the Adobe site :/
2010-03-14T07:29:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Did you try different browsers?
2010-03-14T07:33:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Would downgrading to Flash 9 be a good idea to try?
2010-03-14T07:36:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 That's such a strange problem :S
2010-03-14T07:38:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 What about other flash? Like flash cartoons or games that don't embed FLV?
2010-03-14T07:55:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Sounds a lot like karen sorry
2010-03-14T07:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Linux is based on UNIX. Please take to OT channel
2010-03-14T07:07:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Hmm just had a thought. Maybe it's something to do with 32bit/64bit? ;o
2010-03-14T07:08:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 32bit OS? 32 CPU? 32 flash binary package?
2010-03-17T01:20:00.000Z	NewWorld	karan	 Ask in the OpenSUSE chan
