2010-09-12T15:11:00.000Z	WXZ		if I install windows on 1 partition
2010-09-12T15:11:00.000Z	WXZ		I mean hdd
2010-09-12T15:11:00.000Z	WXZ		and ubuntu on another
2010-09-12T15:11:00.000Z	WXZ		grub will allow me to switch between both right?
2010-09-12T15:12:00.000Z	WXZ		ok
2010-09-12T15:12:00.000Z	WXZ		does it matter w
2010-09-12T15:12:00.000Z	WXZ		does it matter the order in which I install
2010-09-12T15:13:00.000Z	WXZ		or windows is going to kill the mbr either way
2010-09-12T15:13:00.000Z	WXZ		k, thanks
2010-09-12T15:13:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	ubuntu kills the mbr with grub, windows first then ubuntu for ease of transition
2010-10-10T18:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	sudo apt-get gnome
2010-10-10T18:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	sudo apt-get install gnome (sorry missed ouit install)
2010-10-10T18:59:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	what are they?, just instal them
2010-10-10T19:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	btw its easier to just 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' although you do get a lot of junk with it
2010-10-10T19:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	unlikely, usually it only goes down one level
2010-10-10T19:01:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	imo, if your going minimal, i wouldn't use gnome
2010-10-10T19:02:00.000Z	WXZ	aeon-ltd	I'm not looking for the "bare-minimum" per se, just the bare minimum of the apps which I want to run (gnome being one of them)
2010-10-10T19:02:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	then erUSUL's suggestion is correct, gnome-core
2010-10-13T20:24:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	WXZ	its in the description in synaptics
