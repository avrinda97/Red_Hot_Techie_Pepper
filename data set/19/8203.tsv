2007-04-24T12:59:00.000Z	bloodMuffin		since im running out of space on it( i created it too small)
2007-04-24T12:59:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	Gparted
2007-04-24T13:00:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	Gparted, is that an application to resize partitions?
2007-04-24T13:00:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	yes
2007-04-24T13:02:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	boot a live disc and use gparted
2007-04-24T13:03:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	hm im running off the live disc right now...
2007-04-24T13:03:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	then start gparted and go for it
2007-04-24T13:10:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	i open gparted, and i see 4 partitions and 1 unallocated space
2007-04-24T13:10:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	it wont let me create a partition in the unallocated
2007-04-24T13:11:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	what does it say?
2007-04-24T13:11:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	'it is not possible to create more than 4 primary partitions'
2007-04-24T13:12:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	from left to right i have [ntfs] [ext3] [linux-swap] [ntfs] [unallocated] 
2007-04-24T13:12:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	it wont let you make it a ext3 partition?
2007-04-24T13:13:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	yea it says i cant have more than 4 primary partitions
2007-04-24T13:14:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	it doesnt really matter, we want to grow a partition to take up that space yeah?
2007-04-24T13:17:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	Parmenion, my gparted looks like the following :    [  ntfs ]  [ext3] [linux-swap] [     ntfs   ]  [ unallocated   ] 
2007-04-24T13:18:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	you want to grow the ext3 to take the unnallocated space yeah?
2007-04-24T13:19:00.000Z	bloodMuffin	umop	it wont let me grow i think since there exists an ntfs partition and a linux-swap partition between my ext3 and the unallocated
2007-04-24T13:20:00.000Z	umop	bloodMuffin	thats true, there is probably a way to shuffle them, buts its up to you, like unallocating swap, then resizing the nts, etc till you have space nxt to ext3
