2012-08-12T16:30:00.000Z	Crnkoj	jrib	well i found this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookAir where they suggest 8.04... and thats sort of too old for me...
2012-08-12T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	Crnkoj	macbooks are intel macs you should be able to use the amd64 and i386 versions of ubuntu.  Thus why I am confused that you found a version of 8.04 for it
2012-08-12T16:30:00.000Z	Crnkoj	jrib	yes im confused about it myself as well, thats why i was asking around here
2012-08-12T16:31:00.000Z	Crnkoj	jrib	i mean i know i can put gentoo on it and it will work fine, but for certain programs i woudl need ubuntu
