2007-04-07T05:48:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	theoretically, that's a deb:  what you're running into is like a windows program that needs a vb runtime installed as well
2007-04-07T05:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	no internet access on that machine you said?
2007-04-07T05:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	sorry if you've already answered this, are you running edgy or fiesty?
2007-04-07T05:49:00.000Z	Jim1804	cwillu	not on that machine, but I've been carting files over on a flash drive..
2007-04-07T05:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	k, one sec
2007-04-07T05:50:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	what packages have you been installing?
2007-04-07T05:54:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	come on, get your priorities straight :)
2007-04-07T05:56:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	do you have another ubuntu machine on the internet?
2007-04-07T05:56:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	I believe you just need gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
2007-04-07T05:57:00.000Z	Jim1804	cwillu	- i thought about using easy ubuntu to download them via the live cd, and then transfer them over, but i wasn't sure exactly what i was lookig for..
2007-04-07T05:58:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	that's the one that provides mp3 and a bunch of other stuff, I don't think it depends on anything else
2007-04-07T05:58:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	it _might_ be a slightly different version in edgy though
2007-04-07T05:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	better off using ubuntu's, there's no guarentee of binary compatibiltiy between ubuntu and debian (even though it usually works)
2007-04-07T05:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	plus there may be a bunch of different dependencies with debian
2007-04-07T06:00:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	yep;  they often will, but ubuntu has different dependencies, so anything system'ish will often require a bunch of different stuff
2007-04-07T06:03:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	yep, everything that gets installed is cached in /var/cache/apt, can probably just copy the whole mess
2007-04-07T06:05:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	:p
2007-04-07T06:05:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	did you have any luck with the one gstreamer package I mentioned?  I'm almost certain it should Just Work.
2007-04-07T06:06:00.000Z	cwillu	Jim1804	k, gl with that :)
