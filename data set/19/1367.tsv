2012-06-29T01:53:00.000Z	aristidesfl		hi, I've got ubuntu installed on a 4GB usb drive, with swap disable. would like to copy it to an empty hard drive, and enable swap on that hard drive, and have  the rest of space for a 3rth partition for media files. what's the easiest way to accomplish this?
2012-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	you should try partitioning with gpart first
2012-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	is parted ok?
2012-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	yeah, same thing it was a type on my part :P
2012-06-29T01:56:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	you probably want to make your linux partition with ext4
2012-06-29T01:57:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	the partition on the usb stick is ext3
2012-06-29T01:57:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	it shouldn't really matter, either is ok
2012-06-29T01:58:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	what are the advantages of ext4

2012-06-29T01:59:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	ext4 can mount and use a filesystem without a journal
2012-06-29T02:00:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	can't ext3 mount a FAT usb stick?
2012-06-29T02:00:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	I don't really know, I'm not exactly an expert in that area
2012-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	don't partition if you don't have a backup!
2012-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	you can look at other partition data with disk utility
2012-06-29T02:04:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	I don't have a desktop environment
2012-06-29T02:04:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	have you tried booting from the usb? gparted and disk utility are available on there
2012-06-29T02:05:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	I don't have a desktop environment
2012-06-29T05:06:00.000Z	aristidesfl	altan	500MBps
2012-06-29T05:06:00.000Z	altan	aristidesfl	that's good. I'm getting 570MBps as a benchmark
