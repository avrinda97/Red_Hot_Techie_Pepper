2006-09-02T09:16:00.000Z	reptyle		its not a bug.
2006-09-02T09:16:00.000Z	reptyle		ssh is not allocating a pseduo tty due the "run command" parameter...
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	ScribbleJ	reptyle	I figured it was something along those lines...
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	reptyle		it will probably not echo the password if you pass ssh the -t option to allocate a tty
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		Thanks... I'll give that a shot next time.
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		++reptyle.
2006-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	reptyle		I run libterm apps thru multiple servers and require the allocated tty :).. I've run into that before.
2006-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	reptyle		if you run ssh bare, it thinks you want a terminal, if you tell it to run a command it thinks you don't need a tty...
2006-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	ScribbleJ	reptyle	maybe you know this then... is there a simple way to 'chain' an ssh tunnel through multiple machines?
2006-09-02T09:18:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		Simple as in - can be done in one command line. :)
2006-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	reptyle	ScribbleJ	I would say probably.. but mostly I need to access 1 system then ssh to an internal one... so I've never had to do that :)
2006-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		Ah.
2006-09-02T09:19:00.000Z	reptyle	ScribbleJ	but I would use the ssh agent forwarding for that.
2006-09-02T09:20:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		I have a situation where I am on machine A, have ssh access to machine B, which has ssh access to machine C, which has ssh access to machine D, and I want to connect to a serivce on D.
2006-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	reptyle	ScribbleJ	in one line.. I'd have to work that out.. but it can be done with port forwarding.
2006-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		Reptyle, yes, I *do* it now.
2006-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		But I do it in three commandlines.
2006-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	ScribbleJ		Heh
2006-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	reptyle	ScribbleJ	it'll just be slow :)
