2008-04-25T17:49:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	you probably need madwifi-tools
2008-04-25T17:29:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	get airecrack-ng, it includes a tool that scans for available access points
2008-04-25T17:30:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	I forget which one though
2008-04-25T17:30:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	whats the package name exactly?
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	have you tried to modprobe ath_pci
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	blacklisted
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	that's strange why would it be blacklisted....
2008-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	I did it lol
2008-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	well remove the black list, ath_pci is needed
2008-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	but im using atheros windows driver on ndiswrapper
2008-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	well don't
2008-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	you should be able to get ath_pci to work
2008-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	so no need for ndiswrapper?
2008-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	no
2008-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	ok but when ndiswrapper disabled , wireless doesnt work even if the athpci is enabled
2008-04-25T17:49:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	1st I installed madwifi , wireless worked but same problem as ndiswrapper , wireless working and no network detection
2008-04-25T17:51:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	how to edit blacklist file and modprobe conf file?
2008-04-25T17:56:00.000Z	amerio	iKernel	how to remove ndiswrapper from modprobe?
2008-04-25T17:57:00.000Z	iKernel	amerio	modprobe -r <module you want to boot up the ass and get out for just a moment while you do something else>
