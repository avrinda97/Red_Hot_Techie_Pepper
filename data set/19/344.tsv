2012-04-03T20:28:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	You could start with the link I gave you.
2012-04-03T20:29:00.000Z	Sant	bekks	yup ,..jus checking it out
2012-04-15T13:21:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	No.
2012-04-15T13:21:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	All you have to to is to copy it to your /boot in your VM, create a grub entry, and to install the modules. You really should go about creating .debs for y new kernel instead of installing it that way.
2012-04-15T13:23:00.000Z	Sant	bekks	i am relatively new to linux. How can i create a grub entry in vm?

2012-04-15T13:23:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	You should read that document and do it that way, not the manual way you are approaching.
2012-04-15T13:24:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	No.
2012-04-15T13:25:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	And for booting a kernel with an ISO, you need qemu, not vbox.
2012-04-15T13:26:00.000Z	Sant	bekks	but a lot of places i have seen vbox using iso to boot
2012-04-15T13:26:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	Right, and ISO that boot an OS, and not just a single kernel.
2012-04-15T13:27:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	Yes, for the fourth time :)
2012-04-15T13:29:00.000Z	Sant	bekks	could you also suggest where i can begin with kernel programming? some website or something?
2012-04-15T13:30:00.000Z	bekks	Sant	I gave you a link.
