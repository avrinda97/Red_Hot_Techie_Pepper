2008-12-30T20:09:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	you need to read the link and modify your sources.list as indicated
2008-12-30T20:09:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	no you did not
2008-12-30T20:16:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	your sources.list are wrong. fix them and then upgrade
2008-12-30T20:20:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	the ones that are not old-releases.ubuntu.com are wrong
2008-12-30T20:21:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	then your sources would be correct, but they are not.
2008-12-30T20:21:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	the link says exactly what to do.
2008-12-30T20:24:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	you need to remove everything but those old-releases.ubuntu.com ones, as indicated in the link.
2008-12-30T20:26:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	update your sources.list with a # in front of the dead archives
2008-12-30T20:34:00.000Z	bitannihilator42	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/96033/ well?
2008-12-30T20:35:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	your sources.list should have only those old-releases.ubuntu.com as shown on that link. please update your own list as such then sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-12-30T20:37:00.000Z	bitannihilator42	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/96038/

2008-12-30T20:39:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	choose yes
2008-12-30T20:40:00.000Z	bitannihilator42	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/96041/ now what?
2008-12-30T20:41:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	did you place a # in front of the old archives like I recommended?
2008-12-30T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	bitannihilator42	then change those to gutsy, remove the #, and put a # in front of the old-releases ones
