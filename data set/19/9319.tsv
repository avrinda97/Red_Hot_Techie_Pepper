2006-11-23T17:23:00.000Z	peer123	fyrestrtr	can you help me with PPPoE?
2006-11-23T17:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	I can try, I don't have much experience in it since I don't use it.
2006-11-23T17:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	you have them in the correct file?
2006-11-23T17:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	have you tried it via kppp ? Its the KDE dialer, and its quite good.
2006-11-23T17:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	ehh ... maybe your dialog has some extraneous characters that are tripping it up (assuming your credentials are okay)
2006-11-23T17:29:00.000Z	peer123	fyrestrtr	can you please elaborate?
2006-11-23T17:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	if your dialog where the program enters your username/password has some extra characters (like a space or other non printable characters) that might trip it up.
2006-11-23T17:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	this is usually in the chap/pap file, but its been 4+ years since I did PPPoE on Linux.
2006-11-23T17:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	that was waayyy before ubuntu was born.
2006-11-23T17:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	why is that?
2006-11-23T17:31:00.000Z	peer123	fyrestrtr	: same problem i guess, since the firmware is linux-based
2006-11-23T17:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	what do you use to connect when it does work?
2006-11-23T17:34:00.000Z	peer123	fyrestrtr	: I use the pppoe interface in m$ win XP
2006-11-23T17:34:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	peer123	are you dual booting?
