2010-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	justin22885		is xdm a login thats unbiased to any desktop environment?
2010-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	justin22885		then i like xdm... keep it modular, ya know?
2010-02-19T13:43:00.000Z	justin22885		ive never used redhat... i used one of the first fedora core distros for about 2 days though
2010-02-19T13:45:00.000Z	justin22885		im going to need to install wifi.. i have a broadcom wifi adapter, any tips on how to get this properly configured?... my router uses no password, but will only accept devices of specific mac addresses, so no issues there
2010-02-19T13:46:00.000Z	justin22885		once those 256gb SSDs become affordable, im hopping over to SSD on all devices and not looking back
2010-02-19T13:46:00.000Z	justin22885		afterstep?
2010-02-19T13:48:00.000Z	justin22885		to be honest, i havent a clue as to which desktop environment i will use, fluxbox, lxde, gnome, or kde
2010-02-19T13:48:00.000Z	justin22885		ive used all those except for lxde
2010-02-19T13:50:00.000Z	justin22885		ok, the net install disc is asking me to choose a kernal, any suggestions?... 2.6.31-19-386 looks good
2010-02-19T13:51:00.000Z	justin22885		question: will xdm allow me to select from multiple installed desktop environments? so i could install gnome, lxde, and fluxbox and toy around with all?
2010-02-19T13:52:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	pure xdm? I remember that was very minimalistic, but I probably haven't seen that for nearly a decade. The lxdm, gdm and kdm all allow it.
2010-02-19T13:53:00.000Z	justin22885	alankila	i just want an unbiased login, lxdm, gdm, and kdm are all biased to lxde, gnome, and kde
2010-02-19T13:54:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	so what? xdm probably means you go for editing files when you want to change the DE, or that is what I would have had to do back in the time I still used xdm. I don't know. I recommend lxdm or gdm, who cares which one it is as long as it works?
2010-02-19T13:55:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	you can easily try the xdm & see how it goes, but chances are there's nothing but username and password prompt
2010-02-19T13:56:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	riiight. Well, you still want some kind of box where to select which desktop to boot. You can put username and password as 'x' if you like.
2010-02-19T13:56:00.000Z	justin22885	alankila	xdm wont allow me to select a desktop?
2010-02-19T13:56:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	my guess is no
2010-02-19T13:59:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	I have personally liked lxde almost over gnome -- it is what I use on this machine for instance.
2010-02-25T15:20:00.000Z	alankila	justin22885	perhaps you should consider lxde, if gnome and kde are off the table for some reason?
