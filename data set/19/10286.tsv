2006-07-02T08:17:00.000Z	pete6		Hi I'm having trouble changing my resolution, it's set on 1600x1200 and i'm trying to change to 1280x1024 and set it as default and it doesn't stay after i hit apply
2006-07-02T08:18:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 i'd just remove the 1600x1200  from /etc/X11/xorg.conf  (backup the original first)
2006-07-02T08:18:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	alright, give me a second
2006-07-02T08:20:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	which 1600x1200? there are multiple entries under subsection "display"
2006-07-02T08:20:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 yeah delete all of them if you don't want to use that resolution
2006-07-02T08:21:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	can i delete all the resolutions i'm not going to use? (dumb question :P )
2006-07-02T08:21:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 yes you can if you want
2006-07-02T08:24:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	i am unable to save the xorg.conf in the same location
2006-07-02T08:24:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 ah yes you need to have superuser priviliges to edit the file.  save it in your homedir and you can copy it over with sudo
2006-07-02T08:26:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	what is sudo?
2006-07-02T08:27:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 sudo gives root privilidges to the command you call with it.
2006-07-02T08:29:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	i'm confused as to how i use sudo to copy the xorg.conf, sorry this is my first time with linux
2006-07-02T08:31:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	  sudo cp file1 file2   this will move file1 to the location of file2.   for example  sudo cp xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-07-02T09:05:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 maybe use a lower color depth
2006-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	how do i change the color depth?
2006-07-02T09:08:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 it might be useful to find the monitor specs , hsync vsync resolution and color depth, in the manufacturers documentation or a hardware database.
2006-07-02T09:08:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 you can comment out depth settings in your xorg.conf
2006-07-02T09:13:00.000Z	pete6	wastrel	after i editted the color depths in the xorg.conf i can't get past the log in screen :/
2006-07-02T09:13:00.000Z	wastrel	pete6	 what did you do?
