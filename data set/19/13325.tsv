2005-04-18T10:22:00.000Z	samuel		first time on ubuntu for me
2005-04-18T10:22:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	it's your user password.
2005-04-18T10:22:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	the first user you made. Use sudo.
2005-04-18T10:24:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	when you run synaptic as your user it will ask for a password. Enter your user password.
2005-04-18T10:26:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	do a "sudo passwd" to get root back.
2005-04-19T07:41:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	running "sudo passwd" will set the root password.
2005-04-19T07:42:00.000Z	samuel	dcraven	thanks, done that, i was looking at the sudoers file and it seems i am a member of the admin group... is it safe to take me off of it?
2005-04-19T07:43:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	why am I thinking adm is the one... I'm not sure which group it is now!
2005-04-19T07:44:00.000Z	samuel	dcraven	ive got the hoary RC and i dont have an adm group, i DO have an admin group
2005-04-19T07:44:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	oh.. Then it's probably safe :)... I wonder why I'm in adm too?
2005-04-19T07:45:00.000Z	samuel	dcraven	thx - i dont like to use root unless i su on purpose...
2005-04-19T07:47:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	yeah.. I think the "admin" group is used in the visudo stuff. You'll be fine I think.
2005-04-19T12:37:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	evolution here.
2005-04-19T12:39:00.000Z	samuel	dcraven	no, thunderbird still doesnt do virtual folders, just tried it out
2005-04-19T12:39:00.000Z	dcraven	samuel	thanks.
