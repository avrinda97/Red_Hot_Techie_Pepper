2010-07-16T04:22:00.000Z	bolle		i can boot to a livecd, i just recently installed jolicloud and linux mint so i know everything is working fine with my computer
2010-07-16T04:23:00.000Z	Vig0	bolle	Did you want a GUI with the Minimal?
2010-07-16T04:23:00.000Z	bolle		no vig, i just want a command line in order to install lxde

2010-07-16T04:27:00.000Z	bolle		how would i do that?
2010-07-16T04:27:00.000Z	Vig0	bolle	Hold N at boot? I think
2010-07-16T04:28:00.000Z	bolle	Vig0	Ill try it.. So like while booting into my live usb of linux mint hold N?
2010-07-16T04:28:00.000Z	Vig0	bolle	That key combo works in most Gnome...
