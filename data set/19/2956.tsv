2009-11-19T01:13:00.000Z	marti750		Scuzini: Are you there?
2009-11-19T01:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	yep
2009-11-19T01:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	is this a fresh install or do you have tons of data on the drive?
2009-11-19T01:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	It doesn't take long.. I'd just reinstall.. I know the level of frustration you're having.. trying to diagnose it might take much more time than just reinstalling it.. if you have the drive space you might consider partitioning the drive in 3 sections.. 8 gigs for root / .... 1-2 gigs for /swap ... and the rest for /home.. that way later if you need to reinstall you won't have to wipe out your /home with all your data.
2009-11-19T01:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	doesn't it use the generic driver?
2009-11-19T01:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	so reinstall and *don't* install the ati driver.. the system will set itself up with the generic.. then you can use it and search for the right way to do it..
2009-11-19T01:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	doesn't matter.. When you reinstall part of the install process is to set the system up with a generic driver so it's functional.
2009-11-19T01:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	after it's installed then check the link I"ll have ubottu give you..
2009-11-19T01:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	no.. reinstall it all.. it should work right after installation.. don't immediately try to install an ATI driver right after installation.. do all your updates first .. THEN look in System>Admin>Hardware drivers.. if there's one there for your card activate it.. if there isn't then follow the link ubottu gave you.
2009-11-19T01:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	ATI is not the easiest to work with.. envyng has messed with your system and I don't know how to reverse it.. the previous link is the best I can do.. I run nvidia and find it much easier.
2009-11-19T01:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	what's the video card.. an ATI what?
2009-11-19T01:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	hang on.
2009-11-19T01:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	first.. use TAB to auto complete my nick.. you're mispelling it so it doesn't highlight.. if you have 2 cards in the machine pull one.. installing drivers with 2 cards in can cause LOTS of confusion.. also check in www.ubuntuforums.org and search on Radeon or Radeon 9800 etc.. there's lots of references. I don't have the time to go through them..
2009-11-19T01:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	you misspelled it again.. so do you have 2 unique cards in the machine? or just output for 2 monitors?
2009-11-19T01:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	typee Scu<TAB> to auto complete..  .. do you have a secondary monitor plugged in?
2009-11-19T01:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	yes.. I don't have the answers for you.
2009-11-19T01:58:00.000Z	marti750	Scunizi	I have 1 more question, my littlebrother playing World of Warcraft on this machine (Ubuntu 9.10) Then i start it , it's don't show up? can it be the ATI?
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	possibly
2009-11-19T02:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	marti750	your welcome.. I hope it's fixed soon
