2010-01-25T18:52:00.000Z	MrTorque		how do i create a file with 800GB quickly? dd if=/dev/zero takes so long!
2010-01-25T18:52:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	get a quicker hard drive, fool
2010-01-25T18:53:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	did you ever had to write  800GB file??
2010-01-25T18:54:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	yes. I did it on a RAID0.
2010-01-25T18:55:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	is there an other way then dd it from /dev/zero?
2010-01-25T18:56:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	buying faster harddrives is not possible
2010-01-25T18:56:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	don't go there.
2010-01-25T18:56:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	yes, it is possible
2010-01-25T18:57:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	listen, ok? Your hard drive is the bottleneck, not dd. There is nothing you can do to speed it up.
2010-01-25T18:58:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	hm, ok.
2010-01-25T18:58:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	hard drives are bottlenecks in -most systems-, you hear? Writing to them is -slow- by comparison to RAM.
2010-01-25T18:59:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	well, i can not change the bottleneck. i have to live with it
2010-01-25T18:59:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	for win there seems to be tools for that: http://windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/40935/how-can-i-create-a-file-of-a-certain-size-in-windows-xp-and-later.html
2010-01-25T19:00:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	there seems to be tools for that in Linux too. It's called 'dd'.
2010-01-25T19:02:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	what about mkfile? http://www.manpagez.com/man/8/mkfile/
2010-01-25T19:02:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	if your file is 100% redundant then you could use something like zfs to compress it, and possibly reduce the bottleneck significantly.
2010-01-25T19:03:00.000Z	s00p	MrTorque	consider looking at zfs for your nas.
2010-01-25T19:03:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	what with dd and the seek option??
2010-01-25T19:05:00.000Z	MrTorque	s00p	haha, i did: dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/linkstation1/container bs=1024 seek=799999990 count=800000000 and voila: got a 800GB file very, very quickly!
