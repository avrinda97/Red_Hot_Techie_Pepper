2010-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	I want to remove the title bar for any window. The bar that stands on the top with the 3 buttons (minimize, maximize, close) and the title
2010-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 dare we ask why? COmpiz has a feature to do that. if you really wanted to.
2010-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	-^
2010-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 no idea. never tried.
2010-03-14T15:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 why is this even impoirntant?
2010-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	this title bar takes useful space
2010-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	It's not useful for me anymore
2010-03-14T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 its a window manager feature/thing. Compiz can do it - I imagone others can aswell.. but not gnomes default metacityu
2010-03-14T15:18:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	does Compiz require graphics acceleration?
2010-03-14T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 for the most part. yes
2010-03-14T15:23:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	Is it possible that some configuration file saves information about the size of the title bar? I realized that increasing the font size from the title bar makes the title bar grow, but the oposite is not true. I even removed all of the buttons and decreased the font size, but the title bar doesnt shrink... (I tried this with gconf-editor)
2010-03-14T15:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 some window managers have per-window/app title bar options. I do not think the default gnome window manager can do this.
2010-03-14T15:34:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	by the way, how do I do it with Compiz? - remove the title bar
2010-03-14T15:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 in the CCSM tools it has a settings for that stuff on a per window/program basis
2010-03-14T15:36:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	alright, gonna check that
2010-03-14T15:59:00.000Z	bombel	Dr_Willis	Thaks, problem solved. My unique problem with Compiz is that it conflicts with other graphical applications unexpectly.
2010-03-14T15:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bombel	 most people have no issues.. at leat not any more
