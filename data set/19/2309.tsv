2010-05-05T07:26:00.000Z	wildbat	CogitoErgoSam	the system want <super>+ something but i want just the super~
2010-05-05T07:28:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 I'm looking around but I bet there's a way to set the hotkey somewhere in the gconf settings (in ~/.gconf/)
2010-05-05T07:28:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 If I find it I'll let ya know
2010-05-05T08:06:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 If you're still here I found a way for you to set that hotkey to just <SUPER>
2010-05-05T08:06:00.000Z	wildbat	CogitoErgoSam	wow thatnks
2010-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	I got good news and bad news
2010-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	wildbat	CogitoErgoSam	hey ~ you still there xD
2010-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 bad news, can't use gconf to bind something like the menu to the super key exclusively because its a modifier
2010-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 good news, might be able to via compizconfig if I can find the right command-line options to bind to Super
2010-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 But it does look like you can bind actions to JUST super via compizconfig
2010-05-05T11:33:00.000Z	wildbat	CogitoErgoSam	i tried that too ~ no luck ;p
2010-05-05T11:34:00.000Z	wildbat	CogitoErgoSam	i doubt if it can be done ~ but if ibus can switch input method with use modifier key like ctrl+shift, it should be ;p
2010-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 THere are other channels for stuff ike that, but you can match any number of repeated characters like this:  [a]{7} for 7 of them, or do ranges like [a]{1,3} for 1-3
2010-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 [a]{4,} will do 4 or more
2010-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	wildbat	CogitoErgoSam	but that way i am limited to 'a' ~ i wanna match any repeating letter ~ is that possible?
2010-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 A decent site for reference is www.regular-expressions.info, or google "regular expression cheat sheet" which should get ya some decent guides that show those shortcuts
2010-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 Regex has special characters for things like letters, numbers, etc
2010-05-12T09:58:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	wildbat	 if you use extended regular expressions you can use \w for word characters, or \d for digits instead of manually doing ranges
