2009-10-23T16:55:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Updating didn't solve the problem...Any suggestions?
2009-10-23T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	i dont know what you problem is
2009-10-23T16:56:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	My problem is firefox doesn't let me navigate back or forward, it doesn't save history nor bookmarks.
2009-10-23T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	have you tried renaming ~/.mozilla
2009-10-23T16:57:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	The folder?
2009-10-23T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	yes ~/.mozilla is a folder
2009-10-23T17:00:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Could you please tell me the whole path?
2009-10-23T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	/home/$USER/.mozilla   OR $HOME/.mozilla   OR (as I actually did give you the path)   ~?.mozilla
2009-10-23T17:01:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Thanks very much, indeed.
2009-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Which name should I set?
2009-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	anything you want, just make it different
2009-10-23T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	once you rename it you will get a stock profile when you next run the browser
2009-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Ok.
2009-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	if its ok now, the old profile is corrupted
2009-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Why are there hidden directories in my home directory?
2009-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Because that directory doesn't appear doing a "ls"
2009-10-23T17:08:00.000Z	Guest58035	ActionParsnip1	Is this correct? ----> sudo rename \.mozilla \firefox ?
2009-10-23T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla_old
2009-10-23T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Guest58035	you can copy and paste to the terminal
