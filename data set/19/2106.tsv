2010-06-30T19:22:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	What's the problem?
2010-06-30T19:23:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	I try and login using my regular username, which only shows me the login screen wallpaper (al windows are gone) and does nothing else. I then try to login using a new user account which works fine, then I start gdmflexiserver and login with my original username and that also works fine
2010-06-30T19:24:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	but reboot and it's the same story all over again, and I just don't understand how this might work since gdmflexiserver shouldn't be that different from gdm concerning login scripts and such, should it?
2010-06-30T19:24:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	whoa!! did this all crop up after updates?
2010-06-30T19:24:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	yup
2010-06-30T19:26:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	I really wish I could tell you exactly what's wrong, we did a fresh install on my friend's motherboard the other day and updated and couldn't get in to login screen. There seems to be something wrong with an update
2010-06-30T19:26:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	sorry I Meabt my friend's PC
2010-06-30T19:27:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	strange, I can start X and gdm fine, just can't login
2010-06-30T19:27:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	We couldn't boot into Linux after the updates and haven't been able to re-install since
2010-06-30T19:28:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	well that's weird!
2010-06-30T19:28:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	so what did you end up doing then?
2010-06-30T19:30:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	We got out an old PC and installed on that. Though after updates we encountered a myriad of problems. Eventually I just abandoned him to it. After 24 hours of straight up computer bashing I'd had enough.
2010-06-30T19:31:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	Right now I have developed problems of my own trough updates
2010-06-30T19:31:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	damn man, that sucks
2010-06-30T19:31:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	Grub's gone, and this morning my firefox updates have screwed my web browsers and the flash plugin isn't working. That's what I'm trying to solve now
2010-06-30T19:32:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	Opera and Firefox have become unusable
2010-06-30T19:33:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	damn, how'd you boot then?
2010-06-30T19:36:00.000Z	DarkStar1	ryuslash	I honestly don't know. when I boot up now it jumps straight into Ubuntu but it shows me like a brief screen of errors (I/O errors) then launches straight into ubuntu
2010-06-30T19:38:00.000Z	ryuslash	DarkStar1	ok, strange, since I installed 10.04 I never see grub anyway, and I haven't been able to show it even though the timeout seems to be set at 10 (I barely understood grub and don't understand grub2 any better)
