2008-08-07T16:43:00.000Z	bazhang	underandy	why do you need the xorg.conf then if it is all hunky-dory
2008-08-07T16:45:00.000Z	underandy	bazhang	cause maybe something missing? its abit laggy when I got firefox, terminal and like pidgin up
2008-08-07T16:46:00.000Z	underandy	bazhang	maybe because i use ext2?
2008-08-07T16:48:00.000Z	bazhang	underandy	no guide? could it have been from either #eeepc or www.eeeuser.com wiki?

2008-08-09T22:44:00.000Z	underandy	bazhang	bcause I only wanted gnome-core
