2009-12-22T06:20:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	do you have the wicd deb package?
2009-12-22T06:21:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	thanks for the response. No I have been installing everything via synaptic.
2009-12-22T06:22:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	Go to System -> Preferences -> Sessions and then find the Wicd entry and uncheck the box.
2009-12-22T06:24:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	I don't seem to have 'sessions' under system->prefs!!
2009-12-22T06:24:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	9.10
2009-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	post results of "more /var/log/wicd/wicd.log"
2009-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	will do. It may take me a few minutes
2009-12-22T06:33:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	use pastebin
2009-12-22T06:34:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	sorry I'm brand new to irc. I don't know what pastebin is!... sorry
2009-12-22T06:39:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	& ubottu: thanks for the tips. I found pastebin, but the output is SO big I can't copy it all!!!... I'm stuck
2009-12-22T06:40:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	then post results of "tail -100 /var/log/wicd/wicd.log"
2009-12-22T06:42:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m4849e87d  Is this correct?
2009-12-22T06:50:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	Well, everything seems to be ok, does /etc/init.d/wicd file exists?
2009-12-22T06:51:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	yes, I have already found that in my digging, plus the settings conf files.
2009-12-22T06:53:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	well, nothing really comes to my mind, no errors mean wicd it's doing just fine, but you can try: "sudo update-rc.d wicd start 80 2 3 4 5 . stop 20 0 1 6 ."
2009-12-22T06:54:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	I've done much googling and found a few people had the same problem and tried most things without success. I've tried that last suggestion and that didn't work either :(. Thank you so much for trying.
2009-12-22T06:56:00.000Z	epinky	LRCV8	good luck :)
2009-12-22T06:56:00.000Z	LRCV8	epinky	very many thanks and good seasons wishes.
