2009-11-03T17:19:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	do you already have a free partition or are you trying to shrink your windows partition?
2009-11-03T17:20:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	Im trying to make my windows partiton bigger than Ubuntu's
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	I cant see the slidder that I saw in a tutorial
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	are you using gparted?
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	No just the installer
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	Im at the partitoning stage
2009-11-03T17:22:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	boot into the live cd and run gparted
2009-11-03T17:22:00.000Z	aaron11		ok
2009-11-03T17:22:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	Yes after that
2009-11-03T17:23:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	if you still cant resize your partitions you could have some files near the end of one of your partitions, so it wont let you
2009-11-03T17:24:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	It looks like i have a lot of partitons
2009-11-03T17:25:00.000Z	Cantcme		does anybody have a way to auto-disable compiz when you launch a 3d app/fullscreen app (that works with games running in Wine) ?
2009-11-03T17:25:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	yeh, you can resize which ever ones you want now
2009-11-03T17:25:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	just be careful :)
2009-11-03T17:25:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	How do I resize again?
2009-11-03T17:26:00.000Z	Cantcme	aaron11	right click on the partition you want to resize, then select the resize/move option
2009-11-03T17:26:00.000Z	aaron11		ok
2009-11-03T17:26:00.000Z	aaron11	Cantcme	Thanks
