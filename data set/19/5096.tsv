2008-09-02T07:33:00.000Z	[Ex0r]		er what the hell
2008-09-02T07:33:00.000Z	[Ex0r]		i have two cd-drives and its telling me there is no media in either one, even though there is
2008-09-02T07:34:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Are you still in gnome?  Can you check that gnome-volume-manager is running?
2008-09-02T07:34:00.000Z	[Ex0r]	dmwit	yes I am
2008-09-02T07:36:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Open the process manager and search for "volume" in the process list.
2008-09-02T07:36:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Okay, that's good.
2008-09-02T07:37:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Is the disk a blank one?
2008-09-02T07:37:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Which program complains about "no media"?
2008-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Okay, try an audio program instead.
2008-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	There's nothing particularly interesting to see on audio discs.
2008-09-02T07:39:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Neat!
2008-09-02T07:40:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	hum
2008-09-02T07:40:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Can you check whether you have a CD device in your fstab?
2008-09-02T07:48:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Those things aren't even remotely related.
2008-09-02T07:49:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	Wait.
2008-09-02T07:49:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	What do you mean by "manage"?
2008-09-02T07:56:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	On a side note, hdparm might help with your cdrom problem, too; check if your drives are set for DMA or not...
2008-09-02T07:57:00.000Z	[Ex0r]	dmwit	im sure its probably got something to do with digital rights management or something
2008-09-02T07:58:00.000Z	dmwit	[Ex0r]	...
