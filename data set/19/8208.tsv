2007-11-17T18:35:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	do I just do a chmod -R on the drive?
2007-11-17T18:35:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	mm nope, i guess the drive is mounting with the wrong settings
2007-11-17T18:36:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	exactly. That is what I want to change. When it is mounted I want any user to be able to modify.
2007-11-17T18:36:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	try this
2007-11-17T18:36:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	cat /etc/mtab
2007-11-17T18:36:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	and check to see what drive the disk is on
2007-11-17T18:37:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	also it should have the "rw" permissions on
2007-11-17T18:37:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	I checked that sometime back. It is "rw"
2007-11-17T18:39:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	also maybe it needs user permissions, sometimes rw doesnt apply to the user
2007-11-17T18:39:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	I am wondering as to what is the reason for the USB drive not to mount as RW for all users.
2007-11-17T18:39:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	aah I see. So how do I set it for the users?
2007-11-17T18:41:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	you can try this
2007-11-17T18:41:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	sudo chown -R
2007-11-17T18:42:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	chown - won't that cause problems for other users?
2007-11-17T18:42:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	or better these settings users,rw,auto 0 0
2007-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	the option users should be in there too
2007-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	aaha! I see.
2007-11-17T18:49:00.000Z	cyrax	juano__	jrib yaay! That worked. Thanks a lot for that.
2007-11-17T18:49:00.000Z	juano__	cyrax	great, glad it did
