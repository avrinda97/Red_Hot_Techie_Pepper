2010-06-04T00:00:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	I attempted that I get an error on "gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade""
2010-06-04T00:00:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	the obvious question is: what error?
2010-06-04T00:01:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	sh: Can't open /cdrom/cdromupgradeflametai1@flametai1-desktop:~$
2010-06-04T00:01:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	Yes I have the ISO Mounted
2010-06-04T00:01:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	does /cdrom/cdromupgrade exist?
2010-06-04T00:02:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	cdrom0 exits, but there is no "cdromupgrade" folder inside of the ISO
2010-06-04T00:02:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	well what is there?
2010-06-04T00:02:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	I also tried changing the "cdrom" to "cdrom0"
2010-06-04T00:04:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	it has casper, dists, install, isolinux, pics, pool, preseed, ubuntu, autorun.inf,md5sum.txt, readme.diskdefines, and wubi.exe
2010-06-04T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	is this the ALTERNATE iso?
2010-06-04T00:05:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	you have a point, no it is not xD
2010-06-04T00:05:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	guessing I need that one so I can upgrade instead?
2010-06-04T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	why not just use update-manager?
2010-06-04T00:06:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	3 hour download
2010-06-04T00:06:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	it will probably take longer with the cd... you have to download even more
2010-06-04T00:08:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	How would I unmount? lol Now it's saying "Unable to unmount cdrom0 umount:/media/cdrom0 mount disagrees with the fstab"
2010-06-04T01:35:00.000Z	flametai1	jrib	Do you use XChat?
2010-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	flametai1	no
