2008-09-11T23:48:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	you're better off asking in #psp, this isn't a PSP support channel, unless you're trying to load ubuntu on it.
2008-09-11T23:50:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	sorry, got ya confused for a sec
2008-09-11T23:52:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	try adjusting your video settings in the mplayer config
2009-08-24T15:52:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	if it's still going without any errors, then wait
2009-08-24T15:54:00.000Z	darksifer	Gnea	check my pastebin http://pastebin.com/m4329b72a plz
2009-08-24T15:55:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	run it like this:  e2fsck -y /dev/sdaX
2009-08-24T15:56:00.000Z	darksifer	Gnea	ok. but how much time do i have to wait to be sure that the command u gave me is working
2009-08-24T15:57:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	it'll automatically assume 'yes' to everything - just kick back, go make a pizza or something
2009-08-24T16:00:00.000Z	darksifer	Gnea	but before the chat i did e2fsck -f -y -v /dev/sdb5.   is that ok or should i cancel and do e2fsck -y /dev/sdb5
2009-08-24T16:00:00.000Z	Gnea	darksifer	oh, no, let it keep going with that - you have -y already, you just turned on a bunch of verbosity so it's massively noisy
2009-08-25T12:57:00.000Z	darksifer	Gnea	hi. u remember me? am the guy from yesterday having problem with the ext4 partition. u recommend me to do e2fsck -y -v /dev/sdb5. operation completed successfully but stil cannot mount the drive. it says wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock ....... try dmesg | tail
