2009-07-27T11:50:00.000Z	itai_michaelson		can anyone help me with a simple rsync command - i want to copy one hard disc into another
2009-07-27T11:50:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	get grsync
2009-07-27T11:51:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	can i set grsync to run everyday at a specific hour?
2009-07-27T11:51:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	No, for that I'd use cron
2009-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	i thought so, thats why i want to know the right syntax for the sync command
2009-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	basically i want to copy sdc1 into sdc2 ,thats it
2009-07-27T11:55:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	 will rsync -ax --delete --force /sdc1 /sdc2 be correct?
2009-07-27T11:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	okay. I'm not the expert at it.  I relied on grsync to keep my backup and it didn't work to restore when I needed it, so I'm disavowing it
2009-07-27T11:55:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	ok
2009-07-27T11:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	I'm going to image-based backup
2009-07-27T11:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	clonezilla
2009-07-27T11:56:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	but i'm backing up data not /
2009-07-27T11:57:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	okay, so sdc1 is mounted as /home or something, is it?
2009-07-27T11:57:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	mounted as /data and the other partition as /backup
2009-07-27T11:57:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	okay
2009-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	well I'd be tempted to replace /sdc1 and /sdc2 in your command with /data and /backup
2009-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	richardcavell	itai_michaelson	keep them mounted
2009-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	of course , you are right.....
2009-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	richardcavell	i just found a good HOWTO so i'll follow that : http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/#Rsync.....thaks
