2009-11-22T02:49:00.000Z	epinky	Napoleon__B	execute on terminal "/usr/bin/vmware/vmware-uninstall.pl"
2009-11-22T02:44:00.000Z	epinky	Napoleon__B	wait, there's not uninstallation script, right?
2009-11-22T02:49:00.000Z	Napoleon__B	epinky	I installed it from a bundle file, and if I run it again it will first uninstall vmware, and then install it again.. but I just need the uninstall part :)
2009-11-22T02:50:00.000Z	epinky	Napoleon__B	did you execute on terminal "/usr/bin/vmware/vmware-uninstall.pl" ?
2009-11-22T02:52:00.000Z	Napoleon__B	epinky	it is installed there but even with sudo it writes back command not found.!
2009-11-22T02:58:00.000Z	Napoleon__B	epinky	the command did do something, It took about a minut to go back to a normal state, but it looks like vmware still is there.! think reboot might help?
