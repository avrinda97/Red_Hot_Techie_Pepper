2007-10-30T19:57:00.000Z	amadeux		Will Horney Horse have a built-in media center? I think that would really be a step forward for ubuntu
2007-10-30T19:58:00.000Z	amadeux		Are there any good media center apps for Gutsy?
2007-10-30T19:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	Horney Horse? where did you get that from lmao
2007-10-30T20:00:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	had to call it something
2007-10-30T20:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	it will be called Hardy Heron see !hardy
2007-10-30T20:01:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	oh. Hardon Heron ;-)
2007-10-30T20:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	you are offtopic and just being stupid for stupid sake now
2007-10-30T20:02:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	not stupid, just a lame attempt at humour. Guess it's not allowed here :)
2007-10-30T20:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	sexual/religious/political comments have no business in the FOSS world
2007-10-30T20:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	see !CoC and !ircguidelines for more info
2007-10-30T20:04:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	yeah yeah, I get it...
2007-10-30T20:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	but to answer your question a media Center would be nice yeah
2007-10-30T20:06:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	I know there are several offerings, but one of the strong suits of ubuntu is that it chooses one main app for one purpose, and stick with that. When a mature enough media center is available, I guess it will be included in ubuntu
2007-10-30T20:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	you can make a wish/request @ launchpad.net
2007-10-30T20:07:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	cool
2007-12-03T19:28:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	I am not talking about dvds
2007-12-03T19:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	amadeux	you need libdvdcss2 to view .mov files
2007-12-03T19:29:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	ok
2007-12-03T19:30:00.000Z	amadeux	IdleOne	but mplayer seems to be able to play h.264 files just fine?
