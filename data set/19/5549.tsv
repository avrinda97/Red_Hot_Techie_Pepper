2008-06-08T14:34:00.000Z	janice8951		Does anyone know how to setup a server that I can access wirelessly?
2008-06-08T14:35:00.000Z	janice8951		Or rather. does anyone know how to setup a home network in Ubuntu?
2008-06-08T14:36:00.000Z	janice8951		home network with a server?
2008-06-08T14:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	janice8951	what about a home network with a server?
2008-06-08T14:38:00.000Z	janice8951	Starnestommy	do you know how to setup one?
2008-06-08T14:39:00.000Z	Starnestommy	janice8951	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
2008-06-08T14:39:00.000Z	janice8951		I sure hope that helps
2008-06-08T14:40:00.000Z	janice8951		What is that Starnestommy?
2008-06-08T14:40:00.000Z	janice8951		That would have been helpful. You shouldn't just blindly point someone to a website and not tell them about it.,
2008-06-08T14:40:00.000Z	Starnestommy	janice8951	that's a page on how to set up the apache webserver with mysql and php
2008-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	janice8951	Starnestommy	I haven't any idea what those things are.
2008-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	janice8951	they're used for making websites
2008-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	janice8951		I don't want a bloody webserver. I need a home network
2008-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	janice8951	oh.  As in one for file sharing?  Try samba
2008-06-08T14:41:00.000Z	janice8951		So that I can use this Machine running Kubuntu as host to store files that I can access wirelessly.
2008-06-08T14:42:00.000Z	janice8951		Yeah, Samba is impossible to figure out to setup.
2008-06-08T14:42:00.000Z	janice8951		Been at this for 4 hours now.
2008-06-08T14:42:00.000Z	janice8951		It's Linux Linux
2008-06-08T14:43:00.000Z	janice8951	Starnestommy	I have been at this for 4 hours. I still have nothing to show for it. NFS is nice and all, but I am starting from scratch, and that's pretty complex eh
