2007-06-28T14:28:00.000Z	hendrixski		umm... I rebooted and all of my programs are still there, but none of my settings, and none of my files are there
2007-06-28T14:28:00.000Z	hendrixski		like, my music just disappeared ...
2007-06-28T14:29:00.000Z	hendrixski		umm.. yeah, so all of my data just dissapeared, but everything works... what could have caused this... and how can I get it back?

2007-06-28T14:30:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	try using a program called photorec
2007-06-28T14:31:00.000Z	hendrixski	Wonderboy	I'll check out photorec ...
2007-06-28T14:31:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	it's free file recovery
2007-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	Wonderboy		point it at the drive and tell it the filetypes to recover
2007-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	Wonderboy		best of luck to you mate
2007-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	here is a video on using it: http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/data-carving-with-photorec-to-retrieve-deleted-files-from-formatted-drives-for-forensics-and-disaster-recovery
2007-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	hendrixski	Wonderboy	cool... will it work on the drive that I'm currently using??? because like i said... everything works.. just my data is gone
2007-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	it sure will
2007-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	hendrixski	Wonderboy	sweet... thanks
2007-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	no problem, let us know how it goes, or at least /msg me with results.
2007-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	hendrixski	Wonderboy	i gotta leave work soon... I'll probably be doing this tomorrow... I'm just... shocked that somethign like this happened
2007-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	always sucks when it happens, and it's always a surprise. =P
2007-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	Wonderboy	I wonder if it's because I accidentally typed dpkg --reconfigure -a instead of confugre ... or because I tried to rm -r a folder for my chroot without having unmounted the drives first ... :-/
2007-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	Wonderboy	hendrixski	heh, at least you know what may have caused it so you'll avoid doing it again next time. ;)
2007-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	Wonderboy	but I don't know if that's it or not... :-/ what if it was some other thing I ran when i was having chroot problems... I'm just totally flustered
