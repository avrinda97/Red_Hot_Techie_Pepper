2011-02-06T09:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoss	The netbook interface is signifigantly different from the normal "Desktop" interface, though in 11.04 the "unity" interface will be used for Desktop by default as well.
2011-02-06T09:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoss	Currenly unity doesn't work with compiz, though that also will change in 11.04 (where it will *only* work with compiz :)
2011-02-06T09:23:00.000Z	hoss	Jordan_U	when is 11.04 expected to release?
2011-02-06T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoss	11 is the year, 04 is the month, so 11.04 will be released April 2011.
