2010-04-18T10:22:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	yes, both ubuntu, both connected via ethernet
2010-04-18T10:25:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	gah, i hope not, no dual boot, just ubuntu and windows 7 and xp via vmware... i could try another linux live cd?  the ethernet is off motherboard, what could have caused nic going bad?
2010-04-18T10:27:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	bttw, interesting caveat: i have one keyboard and one mouse shared for both computers through synergy... that works, so the two computers can interact well... the computer that can't connect also streams videos to xbmc... so it can get to network and work well, just not internet
2010-04-18T10:28:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	yeah, by those checks, the nic seems to work and i'm assigned an IP and my router even seems to see the computer, but wtf
2010-04-18T10:29:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	all the routes seem to be in place and gateway is correct but it just doesn't seem to work, and it stopped working suddenly a couple days ago, very perplexing...
2010-04-18T10:33:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	yes, i was able to access internet, but no hardware upgrades
2010-04-18T10:34:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	i've been looking for a variable that changed, and i can't come up w/ one... obviously there must be something somewhere, but for the life of me i can't figure it out...
2010-04-18T10:34:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	the network settings of each computer are identical as far as i can tell
2010-04-18T10:37:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	interesting enough... can't ping anything, but pinging router gets me a "destination host unreachable" pretty quick
2010-04-18T10:38:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	not really, but i can figure it out pretty quick
2010-04-18T10:38:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	what should i check?
2010-04-18T10:41:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	k, please hold a sec
2010-04-18T10:44:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	http://paste.ubuntu.com/416474/
2010-04-18T10:51:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	sorry, huh?  you mean type a few numbers into console and hit tab?
2010-04-18T10:53:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	yea, default 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 eth0
2010-04-18T10:57:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	yes, other computer pings fine, router not so much... much the ping is obviously literally going through the router to get to the other computer...
2010-04-18T11:00:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	i can't, says "destination host unreachable", fwiw that comes up pretty quick as opposed to when i ping yahoo.com it takes a while to come back w/ unreachable
2010-04-18T11:04:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	hmm, yes, i did pass protect, i'll poke around router settings, if that doesn't work maybe i'll try restarting to factory settings
2010-04-18T11:06:00.000Z	davebs	tucemiux	thank you for your help, i really appreciate it
