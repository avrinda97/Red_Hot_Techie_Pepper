2005-06-11T12:29:00.000Z	Scorpinf		but still no DMA
2005-06-11T12:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	but that section you pasted is commented out, heh.
2005-06-11T12:33:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	yes
2005-06-11T12:36:00.000Z	Scorpinf	crimsun	is   /dev/discs/disc0/disc   the harddrive, i use SATA discs at HD ??
2005-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	Scorpinf	crimsun	any more ideas on how to get DMA working, it's totally dead like Linux will be if it can't handle dma
2005-06-11T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	did you enable DMA manually?
2005-06-11T13:12:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	is it SATA?
2005-06-11T13:12:00.000Z	Scorpinf	crimsun	tried both, it's ide
2005-06-11T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	does your controller support DMA for it, and your HD, too/
2005-06-11T13:13:00.000Z	Scorpinf	crimsun	tried both, it's ide, and yes it works fine i XP
2005-06-11T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	show me the error in #flood you get when attempting to enable DMA on the device
2005-06-11T13:15:00.000Z	Scorpinf	crimsun	HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
2005-06-11T13:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	then it's simply not permitted, and there's not much you can do about it
2005-06-11T13:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Scorpinf	if by chance you are one of the unfortunate people whose hardware is affected by module load order, you might find solutions on the web
2005-06-11T13:16:00.000Z	Scorpinf	crimsun	tuff luck for a linux begginer you mean ;-)
