2006-05-19T05:51:00.000Z	dooglus		doh!  he's taken it off his site!  I'll upload my copy, just a sec.
2006-05-19T05:53:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	oooh thats sooo easy
2006-05-19T05:55:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	need to add an installer to the script
2006-05-19T05:55:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	do you have an easier way of pasting stuff to the pastebin when you can't run X?
2006-05-19T05:55:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	not complaining about the script just all the geek help
2006-05-19T05:56:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	um...  the script won't run if it's not executable
2006-05-19T05:57:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	you can send the script a an executable
2006-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	just make sure the script as an install stage built ine
2006-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	what are you talking about?
2006-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	I didn't send the script.  I uploaded it to a web site
2006-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	well all the help scripts Ive done (self extracting installable files mostly)
2006-05-19T06:00:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	his whole problem is that he can't get into X.  he can't click on anything.  do you understand?
2006-05-19T06:01:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	aah, Live CD time
2006-05-19T06:01:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	he can boot ubuntu, and log in to a VC, but GNOME isn't working.
2006-05-19T06:01:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	I don't see how a live cd will help.
2006-05-19T06:02:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	well for starters give you a working Xorg.conf file
2006-05-19T06:06:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	did you try to get him to start a basic X session without gnome
2006-05-19T06:07:00.000Z	dooglus	linux_galore	no, I was trying to get him to try GNOME as a different user.
2006-05-19T06:08:00.000Z	linux_galore	dooglus	we dont even know if the problem is gnome yet
