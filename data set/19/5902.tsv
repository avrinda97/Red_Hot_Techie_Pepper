2008-04-20T23:21:00.000Z	latitu		how to run an app as system service on boot?
2008-04-20T23:22:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	do you mean how to run a program at each boot?
2008-04-20T23:23:00.000Z	latitu	mwe	yes. and as system service
2008-04-20T23:23:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	As a system service, what does that mean?
2008-04-20T23:24:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	you can put the program name in /etc/rc.local before "exit 0" and it will run at each boot
2008-04-20T23:24:00.000Z	latitu		!boot | mwe
2008-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	latitu	mwe	what does /etc/init.d do?
2008-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	if you want it to show in the list of services you need to write a script in /etc/init.d and use update-rc.d to make it run
2008-04-20T23:26:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	/etc/init.d/ is the directory where "service" scripts are kept
2008-04-20T23:26:00.000Z	latitu	mwe	so what is more powerful and unstopable. init.d or rc.local?
2008-04-20T23:26:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	links in /etc/rc?.d/ determine the startup/stop order
2008-04-20T23:27:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	essentially both are starting a program that can be stopped
2008-04-20T23:27:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	please tell me what you want more presicely
2008-04-20T23:29:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	a program running with root privs is potentially very powerful by nature
2008-04-20T23:32:00.000Z	latitu	mwe	just having info
2008-04-20T23:34:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	well having a program regisered as a service doesn't make it more powerful. the nature of the program itself determines how powerful it is.
2008-04-20T23:35:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	and in linux the root user should be able to stop any process
2008-04-20T23:36:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	in ubuntu that is when you use sudo
2008-04-20T23:38:00.000Z	mwe	latitu	so the linux kernel doesn't distinguish between processes started as a service and other processes
