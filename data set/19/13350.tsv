2005-04-15T06:03:00.000Z	alainm	pune	i am just suggesting that you use synaptic to install wine on your system
2005-04-15T06:03:00.000Z	alainm	pune	i had no problems
2005-04-15T06:03:00.000Z	pune	alainm	i've already installed wine, but it's saying that the config file is missing
2005-04-15T06:04:00.000Z	alainm	pune	oh.. ok
2005-04-15T06:05:00.000Z	pune	alainm	it asks for the winesetupTk file which is on synaptic, however it doesn't work as well, so i was trying to get winetools on
