2005-06-03T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	use the initscript
2005-06-03T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	it's very simple, really. Install icecast2 and ices2.
2005-06-03T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	the reads the docs for both.
2005-06-03T07:10:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	that's the old version of icecast. You don't want that. You want icecast2.
2005-06-03T07:24:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	you have syntax error(s)
2005-06-03T07:28:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	did you copy it over?
2005-06-03T07:34:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	yes
2005-06-03T07:35:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	there are instructions in /usr/share/doc/icecast2/ and /usr/share/doc/ices2/examples/
2005-06-03T09:19:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	why do you need 2.0.1?
2005-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	"made it"?
2005-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	both of those packages are in universe
2005-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	use the universe versions
2005-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	aptitude install icecast2 ices2
2005-06-03T09:23:00.000Z	crimsun	_kevin	use sudo
