2010-02-19T07:22:00.000Z	Losha	icepeda	I'm guessing, but you might be able to rmmod the kernel module and then reload it. Type lsmod to see the kernel modules and see if anything looks likely...
2010-02-19T07:25:00.000Z	icepeda	Losha	How can I remove and reload the module?
2010-02-19T07:26:00.000Z	icepeda	Losha	How can I remove and reload the module?, I see some video modules and one is v4l2, if I remove it how can I reload it?
2010-02-19T07:27:00.000Z	Losha	icepeda	You can try: sudo rmmod v4l2 ; sudo modprobe v4l2 but the exact commands vary from one release to another....

2010-02-19T07:35:00.000Z	Losha	icepeda	there are books written on the linux kernel. It's a large^H^H^H^H^H huge learning curve...
