2005-12-26T10:08:00.000Z	Mike_		hi, i've had lots of problems setting up a wireless card
2005-12-26T10:09:00.000Z	Mike_		is there any wireless cards on the market with linux drivers?
2005-12-26T10:11:00.000Z	Mike_		i've heard the Linksys ones are good, do they offer linux drivers?
2005-12-26T10:13:00.000Z	Mike_		well the Linksys PCI cards have Atheros chipsets which i believe are better supported than the ACX111 crap
2005-12-26T10:13:00.000Z	Mike_		but it's still ridiculously hard getting a wireless card to work under linux
2005-12-26T10:13:00.000Z	Mike_		which is really letting it down
2005-12-26T10:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	Mike_	it depends on which card you have
2005-12-26T10:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	Mike_	maybe we shud just get tou your wireless issue?
