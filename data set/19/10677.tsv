2006-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	open_shell		Hi. If I wanted to start an application in Ubuntu as the SU how would I create an icon on the desktop and make it open and ask for the password? I know I could open a terminal and do it but I would like to skip the extra step.
2006-05-27T05:40:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	use "gksu command"
2006-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	open_shell	interferon	It opened up no problem but did not ask for a SU password
2006-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	it should
2006-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	open_shell		Hmm let me check on it interferon
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	use "gksu whatevertheprogramis" as the Command field for the launcher
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	open_shell		That is what I have interferon. I have gksu quanta %U
2006-05-27T05:45:00.000Z	open_shell		Interferon: It lets me save now to the var/www/ folder so it worked without asking for the password.
2006-05-27T05:46:00.000Z	open_shell		Thanks Interferon.
2006-05-27T05:46:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	ah.  quote the whole command, e.g. 'gksu "quanta %u"'
2006-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	open_shell		ok will try that now.
2006-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	open_shell		Can anyone tell me if there is a similar shortcut to minimize all windows via the keyboard
2006-05-27T05:48:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	you can set a shortcut to show the desktop, which is similar
2006-05-27T05:48:00.000Z	open_shell		Interferon is there  a website you recommend?
2006-05-27T05:49:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	for what?
2006-05-27T05:49:00.000Z	open_shell		For learning the GNOME shortcuts?
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	open_shell		Oh duh there is a app for it
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	open_shell		Sorry I just found it.
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	interferon	open_shell	try the Keyboard Shortcuts option in System | Preferences
