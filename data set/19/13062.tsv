2006-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	MachineScrew	pppoe_dude	it works here in FF
2006-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	MachineScrew	ok thanks :) google video usually allows me to download videos (free ones)
2006-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	MachineScrew	pppoe_dude	and the xvid is in much higher quality
2006-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	MachineScrew	whats FF?
2006-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	MachineScrew	pppoe_dude	FireFox
2006-05-13T12:19:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	MachineScrew	oh... yes it works on FF for me too... no audio but i think its an esd problem there
2006-05-13T12:19:00.000Z	MachineScrew	pppoe_dude	but that software version of the plugin could be the problem try removing that plugin
