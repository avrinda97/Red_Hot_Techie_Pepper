2004-11-25T12:21:00.000Z	farruinn		the ubuntu website says that oldworld macs aren't supported at all by ubuntu - would it be possible to boot from the cd via bootx?
2004-11-25T12:23:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	"not supported" as in "it may or may not work, but we can't fix it at this point"
2004-11-25T12:23:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	if you can get it installed, it should work fine
2004-12-26T12:40:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	that's not good?
2005-02-24T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	yes
2005-03-11T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	er, sure it's looing for /include? that dir doesn't exist on any linux system.
2005-03-11T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	I'd guess it's looking for /includes/ under the kernel source tree, but the kernel source dir variable is empty
2005-03-11T11:59:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	should I really need the kernel source for building this module?  According tot he howto it should only need linux-headers-*
2005-03-11T11:59:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	the file it wants, config.h exists, include/linux is simply in /usr not /
2005-03-11T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	er,, no, the files in /usr/include/ are not what you need
2005-03-11T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	you need to install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-03-11T12:07:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	Thanks, for some reason my kernel version is 2.6.8.1-3 but 2.6.8.1-5 headers are available
2005-03-11T12:08:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	you'll need to upgrade your kernel then
2005-03-11T12:08:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	*-3 headers are available too though and apt-get upgrade doesn't install anything
2005-03-11T12:10:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	well, install them
2005-03-11T12:10:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	obviously, I was just clarifying, thanks =)
2005-03-11T12:12:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	heh
2005-03-18T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	~/.xsession
2005-03-18T09:20:00.000Z	farruinn	bob2	ok, but there's already a fluxbox.desktop in /usr/share/xsessions
