2010-10-11T23:17:00.000Z	Alchimista		hi there. I've updated my ubuntu yesterday, but did no choose to update to maveric. Today it got down and when i try to start it, it goes to a dark place, where initramfs rules :S any idea?
2010-10-11T23:18:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	It goes to France?
2010-10-11T23:18:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	not sure, he does not talk to me :s
2010-10-11T23:20:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	any idea on how to fix it?
2010-10-11T23:22:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	I did not understand your problem, other than moving your computer to the dark place(France, I assume, to quote John Adams)
2010-10-11T23:24:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	If your system is not booting the GUI up, try going to a virtual console, login and do the updates from there.
2010-10-11T23:26:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	well, yesterday i had made the updates on synaptic, and today my pc crashed. Now when i turn it on, i get a black screen, with errors telling that /root/dev, root/sys and /root/proc failed, the easybox message and initramfs terminal :s
2010-10-11T23:29:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	If you are lucky, you just need to fsck the root partition.  Boot up with a CD drive, and run fsck on your root partition.
2010-10-11T23:32:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	try withou t install, right? Doing it
2010-10-11T23:32:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	Yes
2010-10-11T23:37:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	it's taking so long to load ubuntu from cd :s Can it damage if i remove the cd to try again, or is it normal to take so many time?
2010-10-12T00:13:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	does not loads, it remains loading. is there anythin that i can make in initramfs comand line?
2010-10-12T00:18:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	This error occurs during the boot.  Prior to this point, there is an opportunity to choose a kernel.  Try booting with a different kernel.  I gor Lucid trying to boot a PAE kernel somehow and it would die just like yours.  Booting an earlier kernel worked for me.
2010-10-12T00:19:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	but i don't get the option to choose a prior kernel, it simply goes there directly
2010-10-12T00:22:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	Press the Shift key at the right time during boot.  You may have to try it a few times.  In my case, I booted with Knoppix, and edited /boot/grub/grub.cfg to make that menu unhidden.
2010-10-12T00:23:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	goes to the same menu :S
2010-10-12T00:26:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	my too kernels gives the same error :s
2010-10-12T00:29:00.000Z	Severian	Alchimista	That's all I have at the moment.  Sorry.
2010-10-12T00:30:00.000Z	Alchimista	Severian	thanls anyway. i only have acces to the grub menu. Searching what i can do from there
