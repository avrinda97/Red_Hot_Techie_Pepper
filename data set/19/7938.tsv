2007-05-29T16:59:00.000Z	korny_unregister		waht system requirements does the ubuntu feisty fawn livecd have?
2007-05-29T05:00:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	about 256mb ram and a fast enough processor or patience
2007-05-29T05:01:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	to load the whole livecd to ram or just fast enough to install the system
2007-05-29T05:01:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	it never loads the whole thing, but fast enough to use it and to install from. what processor do you have.
2007-05-29T05:02:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	i'm thinking about building a silten pc of old hardware. I think i have 700 mhz pentium 3 and 256mb of ram. i hoped it would be enough to load the system to ram and not use any mechanical parts.
2007-05-29T05:03:00.000Z	korny_unregister		my english really suks
2007-05-29T05:03:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	that's enough to run from cd, but you'll have to keep the cd in to do anything with it.
2007-05-29T05:04:00.000Z	Taxman		if you want a minimal system with no moving parts you want something like damn small linux, korny_unregister
2007-05-29T05:04:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	that wouldn't be silent at all
2007-05-29T05:04:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	try the livecd and you'll see what I mean. It's not spinning all the time, it will run the current program, but if you need to load a new program it spins up the cd
2007-05-29T05:06:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	dsl is a bit too small i think, i'd like to use applications like gaim and firefox. so if i've booted the livecd an started these two applications i coukd remove the cd if i will not start anything else?
2007-05-29T05:07:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	not sure, I can't recall if you can remove the ubuntu livecd or not
2007-05-29T05:08:00.000Z	Taxman		so any ideas why copying a mounted 7.04 cd recurses and uses all available space and runs out?
2007-05-29T05:10:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	okay what should i rather use? i heared that the new ubuntu has the ability to install the proprietary graphicsdrivers within the livecd
2007-05-29T05:11:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	yeah I think so. what are you trying to do, just no moving parts. But use it for what?
2007-05-29T05:13:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	just a pc to surf the web an stay online so nice graphics (like 1280x1024 pixels as default) would be nice
2007-05-29T05:14:00.000Z	Taxman	korny_unregister	yeah, I'm not sure. sorry
2007-05-29T05:14:00.000Z	korny_unregister	Taxman	okay thanks.
