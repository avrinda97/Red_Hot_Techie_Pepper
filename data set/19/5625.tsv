2010-06-16T03:31:00.000Z	edoceo		Why won't cron run my jobs?
2010-06-16T03:31:00.000Z	edoceo		cat /etc/crontab: 30 15 * * * root /usr/bin/php5 /opt/ari/cella/cella.php show
2010-06-16T03:31:00.000Z	edoceo		Yep, doesn't even run them
2010-06-16T03:31:00.000Z	edoceo		cronlog shows other jobs running, just not this one
2010-06-16T03:32:00.000Z	edoceo		And there is not a record in cron that it even tries to *start* the job'
2010-06-16T03:32:00.000Z	edoceo		For example, cron shows this in the log: syslog:Jun 15 15:17:01 vh0 CRON[5132]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)
2010-06-16T03:33:00.000Z	edoceo		But doesn't show any of the jobs I"ve added to /etc/crontab - they never run (using strace on the cron daemon shows it never tries)
2010-06-16T03:34:00.000Z	edoceo		Seems that the cron with ubuntu is a piece of shit, have had this issue before - to bad the package manager complains when I try to replace it with something functionaly, say fcron
2010-06-16T03:34:00.000Z	edoceo		english preferred, german second
2010-06-16T03:35:00.000Z	jpds	edoceo	Sure, your choice.
2010-06-16T03:37:00.000Z	jpds	edoceo	Did you try $ crontab -e -u root ?
2010-06-16T03:37:00.000Z	edoceo	jpds	I tried that too - cron would not run the jobs
2010-06-16T03:37:00.000Z	edoceo		Not from user crontab, not from system crontab, no logs, no messages, nothing just don't run them
2010-06-16T03:38:00.000Z	jpds	edoceo	Is cron reloaded after the edit?
2010-06-16T03:38:00.000Z	edoceo		Was expecting the logs to be more helpful but there was nothing, yes reloaded cron as well
2010-06-16T03:39:00.000Z	edoceo		I've been a Linux user for 15+ years and have only ever see this issues on vixie-cron + ubuntu
2010-06-16T03:39:00.000Z	edoceo		Sadly I cannot figure out how to reproduce it at all :(
2010-06-16T03:42:00.000Z	jpds	edoceo	I copied and pasted your crontab entry and got:
