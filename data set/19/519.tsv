2012-01-21T00:13:00.000Z	t4unt		hey guys I just made a good deal of changes in terminal
2012-01-21T00:13:00.000Z	t4unt		but i'm running ubuntu from a bootable usb. one of the commands called for sudo reboot
2012-01-21T00:13:00.000Z	t4unt		were all my changes lost?
2012-01-21T00:14:00.000Z	graft	t4unt	what kind of changes?
2012-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	t4unt		trying to install a miner
2012-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	t4unt		sudo apt-get update
2012-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	t4unt		sudo apt-get install libqtgui4
2012-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	graft	t4unt	a bitcoin miner?
2012-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	t4unt		then installed some drivers
2012-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	t4unt	graft	yes
2012-01-21T00:16:00.000Z	t4unt		ok well, I guess everything was lost
2012-01-21T00:16:00.000Z	t4unt		because "fglrxinfo" returns "command not found"
2012-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	graft	t4unt	why would everything be lost?
2012-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	t4unt		Can anyone help me? Is it possible to run a bitcoin miner on a Ubunut machine which is running on a bootable-usb?
2012-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	graft	t4unt	oh, if you're running from USB, yeah, you probably lost it
2012-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	t4unt	graft	becasue the OS isn't saved to a hard disk?
2012-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	t4unt		damn :\
2012-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	graft	t4unt	unless you setup your USB disk to have some save space
2012-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	graft	t4unt	which you can do, the USB creator will guide you through it
