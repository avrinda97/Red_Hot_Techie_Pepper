2006-06-08T13:34:00.000Z	sakha		frying_fish,TheSheep: what i am trying to get at is not having to re-partition existing ntfs disk, which is the situtation with 95% computers sold
2006-06-08T13:35:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	trying to get linux to live in ntfs space ?
2006-06-08T13:37:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	just a thought.  but what will it cost to just resize the ntfs and make a partition ???
2006-06-08T13:39:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	people afraid to partition have no business installing an os.   imo
2006-06-08T13:41:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	would we want more and more people to try linux?
2006-06-08T13:41:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	the number of people that use linux does not interest me in the least.
2006-06-08T13:42:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	i'd rather have a hand full with quietness than great numbers with strife
2006-06-08T13:45:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	hopefully....  hehhe yeah
2006-06-08T13:46:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	why do u think there might be a data loss?
2006-06-08T13:52:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	sure make a scba for linux to live in ntfs space.... ahhh isn't that cygwin ???
2006-06-08T13:54:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	it is not really like cygwin, cygwin uses the native ntfs filesystem only
2006-06-08T13:54:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	but it's so near...
2006-06-08T13:55:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	yet different
2006-06-08T13:55:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	build it.
2006-06-08T13:56:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	sure, once i know enough about the ubuntu install process, it is all in python and i could get much ahead in that
2006-06-08T13:56:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	i think it's a bad idea in general.  it says that "linux will bend over backwards and kiss M$ butt"   but hey.  doesn't ecery one ?
2006-06-08T13:57:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	u have any idea about the ubiquity thingy
2006-06-08T14:00:00.000Z	sakha	intelikey	but it is really linux doint it, just that the file system underneath that it has to go thru is ntfs
2006-06-08T14:00:00.000Z	intelikey	sakha	so rewrite it.  it's open source.  not like ntfs.
