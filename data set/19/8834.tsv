2007-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	huascar80		hi, i got a question...
2007-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	huascar80		is it possible t olet nautilus show images as thumbanils without caching on my hd till it gets full!!!
2007-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	huascar80		?
2007-06-09T07:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	I guess the thumbnails have to lib=ve somewhere ;)
2007-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	huascar80		thoeaoeutci: lib=ve? sorry newb here
2007-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	sorry typo for "live"
2007-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic_		:0
2007-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	huascar80	thoreauputic_	still don't get it..
2007-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	I mean, thumbnails take space - no way around that I guess
2007-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	huascar80		ah
2007-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	you can turn thumbnailing off though
2007-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	huascar80	thoreauputic_	i know that
2007-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	*shrug* OK
2007-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	huascar80	thoreauputic_	maybe decreasing the cache size?
2007-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	could work I guess
2007-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	huascar80	thoreauputic_	any idea how?
2007-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	huascar80	not off the top of my head, no
2007-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic_		!upgrade
