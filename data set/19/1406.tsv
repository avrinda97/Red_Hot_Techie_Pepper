2012-04-27T21:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	unity is a shell on top of gnome3, compiz is the default window manager of unity
2012-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	so gnome3 runs beneath unity?
2012-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	yes, unity is built on top of gnome3
2012-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	in 11.04 is was on top of gnome2
2012-04-27T21:45:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	hm okay. and so what does unity do with windows that compiz does not, and visa versa?
2012-04-27T21:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	no you misunderstand, unity uses compiz as the window manager, unity is basically what you'd call the desktop environment
2012-04-27T21:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	if you were running xfce (desktop environment) your window manager would be xfwm4
2012-04-27T21:47:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	okay so unity relies on compiz to interpret its X window API and render a window (including all
2012-04-27T21:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	yes, and unity2d uses metacity instead of compiz as the window manager
2012-04-27T21:50:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	what's Unity2D? a different distribution?
2012-04-27T21:51:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	no, unity2d is the lesser version of unity, you fall back to unity2d if you can't run full unity (usually due to the graphics)
2012-04-27T21:52:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	so... unity IS responsible for making things pretty (including how the windows look?)?
2012-04-27T21:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	no thats the window manager's job (compiz)
2012-04-27T21:53:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	so when you say unity/unity2d and graphics you're not referring to the way your desktop environment looks?
2012-04-27T21:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	what?
2012-04-27T21:53:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	hm nvm I think I get it
2012-04-27T21:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	it doesn't sound like you do, sorry :)
2012-04-27T21:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sample	"how things look" is a very broad term
2012-04-27T22:03:00.000Z	Sample	ThinkT510	regarding your last statement, is there a general or easily describable explanation of what parts of that is handled by the DE (unity) and by the WM (compiz)
