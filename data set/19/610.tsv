2011-11-19T17:15:00.000Z	ztane		any ideas on how to make ubuntu 11.10 grub working on EFI laptop, or... can I use windows 7 boot loader to chainload grub somehow?
2011-11-19T17:16:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	sudo apt-get install grub-efi
2011-11-19T17:29:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	running apt-get upgrade now, maybe that's what's at fault here
2011-11-19T17:58:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	the problem is, no matter where i install grub (grub-install --boot-directory=/boot /dev/sda, or /dev/sda1 or what not, it never ever tries to load grub
2011-11-19T17:59:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	Again, you have to use the GRUB from the grub-efi package, not the normal one
2011-11-19T18:08:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	the solution: install grub-pc instead of the autodetected grub-efi !!
2011-11-19T18:09:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	but... grub-pc is for BIOS...
2011-11-19T18:12:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	it seems to me that not all "EFI" systems are booting with EFI
2011-11-19T18:12:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	True enough, I have a computer with something called "Insyde EFI H20" on it, that is, infact, a BIOS.
2011-11-19T18:13:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	but what is even more confusing is that many ppl on the net have used grub-efi specifically to make oneiric work on this very model
2012-02-07T11:24:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	/var full maybe? You sure logrotate is installed?
2012-02-07T11:25:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	145 gigs free
2012-02-07T11:25:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	it also hangs on stop
2012-02-07T11:26:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	Hmm... Any output when you start it manually as in "sudo service rsyslogd start"?
2012-02-07T11:26:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	no
2012-02-07T11:27:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	Ah then probably something wrong with the config file in /etc/init/
2012-02-07T11:35:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	hmm, config is unchanged
2012-02-07T11:36:00.000Z	theadmin	ztane	Hm, even weirder
2012-02-07T11:41:00.000Z	ztane	theadmin	reboot helped, not nice, fortunately this was not in production
