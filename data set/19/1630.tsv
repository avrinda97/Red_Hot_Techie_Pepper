2011-04-27T13:57:00.000Z	econnell		so outside of revu and bugs.deb.... where should I be pointing people?
2011-04-27T13:59:00.000Z	econnell		i'm sure my userbase will be happy to absolutely inundate whatever forum is needed to get mangler into ubuntu
2011-04-27T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	what is the issue you currently have, lets see if we can help
2011-04-27T14:00:00.000Z	econnell	ikonia	i have a software package that I've been trying to get into ubuntu repos since Dec 2009
2011-04-27T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	ok - what have you done to get it into the repos
2011-04-27T14:01:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	ok - so you've logged a wishlist request, what else have you done ?
2011-04-27T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	ok - so you've built the package and submitted it to the motu process ?
2011-04-27T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	it's a license issue, that's the issue
2011-04-27T14:04:00.000Z	econnell	ikonia	the license issue was resolved months ago....
2011-04-27T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	just reading through
2011-04-27T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	why ?
2011-04-27T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	it seems like reasonable requests, (I've just got to the bottom)
2011-04-27T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	it does matter to call out the correct license, and it's a trivial change
2011-04-27T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	just make the changes and submit, it will get there
2011-04-27T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	and on a side issue thank you for submitting, it will be a good tool to have
2011-04-27T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	guess there is nothing more to be done then,
2011-04-27T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	no point discussing it further then as the revu process is the correct process
2011-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	econnell	ikonia	so i just checked the svn logs... that copyright change was made on jul/23/2010 to comply with revu
2011-04-27T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	econnell	send a mail to the motu guys or ask in #ubuntu-motu for a status update
