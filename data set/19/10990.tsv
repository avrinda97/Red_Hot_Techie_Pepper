2006-05-23T16:15:00.000Z	Rhine		I am trying to use Gtkpod to transfer my music from my ipod to my harddrive but i cannot write to the disk how do i become user permanently for that disk?
2006-05-23T16:15:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	try your /home folder
2006-05-23T16:17:00.000Z	Rhine	Samuli^	The harddrive with the home folder isnt large enough to hold all my music, so im trying to move it to the larger one it is partioned and is the /boot/ but it wont let me write to it
2006-05-23T16:18:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	that's not a good idea.
2006-05-23T16:18:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	mount it to somewhere else than /boot
2006-05-23T16:21:00.000Z	Rhine	Samuli^	I changed it to /Music but the permission is still denied how can i give permission permantly?
2006-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	you need to edit your fstab.
2006-05-23T16:22:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	is a ext3 partition or what?
2006-05-23T16:23:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	then you need to chmod the permissions.
2006-05-23T16:23:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	yeah. Might be a good idea to mount it to your /home/
2006-05-23T16:25:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	no.. Just chmod the permissions.
2006-05-23T16:25:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	first off.. try to mount it into /home/music for example.
2006-05-23T16:26:00.000Z	Rhine	Samuli^	Yep im changing the path at this moment
2006-05-23T16:26:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	yup.. see if you get rights to it that way.
2006-05-23T16:33:00.000Z	Rhine	Samuli^	When i do /home/Music it doesn't make it that it will make it "none". Dunno know if i mentioned this but they are two different Hard Drives ill just try the chmod :/
2006-05-23T16:39:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	and the numbers are 1 write, 2 read and 4 execute then you just add them up like you want.
2006-05-23T16:40:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	for example 777 means everyone has all rights (read, write and execute)
2006-05-23T07:41:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	don't use equalizers, they're evil things :/
2006-05-23T07:43:00.000Z	Samuli^	Rhine	you've propably blown the elements then.
