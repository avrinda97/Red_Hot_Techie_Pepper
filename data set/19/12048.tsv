2005-10-27T15:43:00.000Z	jareth_		SpudLike with xnest you will find in th emenu login in nested window
2005-10-27T15:45:00.000Z	SpudULike	jareth_	Sorry, struggling to find this emenu login.  Where would it be nested?
2005-10-27T15:49:00.000Z	jareth_	SpudULike	you got it working?
2005-10-27T15:49:00.000Z	SpudULike	jareth_	I did apt-get xnest but I do not have 'login' in my menu, only 'New login' which does nothing.
2005-10-27T15:50:00.000Z	jareth_	SpudULike	new login in nested window is the menu-entry
2005-10-27T15:51:00.000Z	SpudULike	jareth_	Ah, maybe I need to do something first. I have created another user but do I need to do anything else to the account to allow them to log in by this xnest method?

2005-10-27T15:52:00.000Z	jareth_	SpudULike	do 1st:  sudo kill gnome-panel
2005-10-27T15:52:00.000Z	jareth_	SpudULike	and look again in th emenu
