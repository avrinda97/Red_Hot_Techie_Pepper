2011-02-21T23:04:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	does ping6 mango.itojun.org return unknown host
2011-02-21T23:04:00.000Z	Godslastering	ohsix	connect: Network is unreachable
2011-02-21T23:04:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	it probably has something to do with it; sec
2011-02-21T23:07:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	theres no simple way to disable ipv6 in chrome to check, but firefox has network.dns.disableIPv6, you can try it with it on and off and see if it goes away
2011-02-21T23:08:00.000Z	Godslastering	ohsix	i have that disabled and am still getting the issue

2011-02-21T23:11:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	if your router is sending RA's but doesn't have a route to ipv6 it should be fixed/disabled there if you can
2011-02-21T23:11:00.000Z	Godslastering	ohsix	i just looked through my router and didn't see anything related to ipv6 at all
2011-02-21T23:11:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	for shame
2011-02-21T23:12:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	RA's might not even be coming from your router; you can listen for them with tcpdump, it won't solve your problem but you might be able to fix the thing after you force it off in ubuntu
2011-02-21T23:14:00.000Z	Godslastering	ohsix	i'm going to attempt a reboot and i'll tell you if it helps
2011-02-21T23:22:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	yay
2011-02-21T23:22:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	the red flag was the ipv6 address on the interface
2011-02-21T23:23:00.000Z	Godslastering	ohsix	pesky little problem though, because i'm not sure where the issue is arising from. is my router actually creating the issue?
2011-02-21T23:24:00.000Z	ohsix	Godslastering	could be, like i said you can use tcpdump to listen for RA's and see where they're coming from, the problem is paying attention to them when theres no ipv6 route through the router advertising routes
