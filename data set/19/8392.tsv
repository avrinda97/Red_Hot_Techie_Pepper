2007-10-14T11:48:00.000Z	ny00123		Hi and OMG!
2007-10-14T11:48:00.000Z	ny00123		All of the icons on the desktop have reappeared with the .desktop extension, can't be executed, and no there's no icon to identify
2007-10-14T11:48:00.000Z	ny00123		(apart from some default icons)
2007-10-14T11:49:00.000Z	ny00123		Solution: Wait for Ubuntu 7.10 and install?
2007-10-14T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	came in late, but have you tried killall nautilus?
2007-10-14T11:52:00.000Z	ny00123	nickrud	a reboot didn't help
2007-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	when did this start happening, do you remember doing anything just before?
2007-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	that thing about gconf, you saw that as an error?
2007-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	ny00123	nickrud	I think I've just tried executing GNU Backgammon via a launcher I've made
2007-10-14T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	I'd log out, switch to a virtual console (clt-alt-f1) , log in , make sure gconf is not running (killall gconfd) and then rm .gconf*
2007-10-14T11:56:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	also, creating a new user and seeing if it's desktop works is a good check to see if it's a user config issue
2007-10-14T11:58:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	try creating a new user, log into that one
2007-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	it shouldn't matter, those are used when you gksudo <gui program>
2007-10-14T12:04:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	ok. Strange problem, that. Where'd you put that desktop file you created?
2007-10-14T12:05:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	next step for me (if the distro upgrade wasn't so close ;) would be to log into recovery mode (that way I *know* gconfd is not running) and delete emerge/.gconf , .gconfd , .gnome2 ,gnome2_private , .local
2007-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	and the desktop file I'd created
2007-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	ok, also get rid of .nautilus .metacity .config .
2007-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud	ny00123	although, gutsy works pretty darned well :)
2007-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	ny00123	nickrud	I'm going to get Gutsy soon yeah ;]
