2009-02-21T04:04:00.000Z	ironrose		"Reading files needed to boot"
2009-02-21T04:04:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	where?
2009-02-21T04:05:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	when loading Ubuntu
2009-02-21T04:05:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	why do you want to get rid of it?
2009-02-21T04:06:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	i messed with my partitions, and before that, it didn't come up. I'm assuming I mounted something wrong?
2009-02-21T04:06:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	does it boot?
2009-02-21T04:06:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	yes, it's just an annoyance cuz it takes longer
2009-02-21T04:08:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	perhaps this can help? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usplash/+bug/205990
2009-02-21T04:13:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	No, thats not it
2009-02-21T04:13:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	what is different?
2009-02-21T04:14:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	Splash screen is fine. it's just before it, it loads this long list of stuff
2009-02-21T04:14:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	and it takes longer to boot?
2009-02-21T04:16:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	does hibernate work?
2009-02-21T04:16:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	It has something to do with an important partition i deleted. like an ext3 maybe? i dunno. It was there by default
2009-02-21T04:16:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	try this:
2009-02-21T04:17:00.000Z	BCM43	ironrose	http://ggts.net/2008/05/13/reading-files-needed-to-boot/
2009-02-21T04:17:00.000Z	ironrose	BCM43	ding ding. I'll look at this. Thank you
