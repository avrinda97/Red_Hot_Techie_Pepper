2011-07-13T07:51:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	it sounds like you're conflating issues of "internet" vs "intranet". I don't know what it means to have a password to the network as you outline it.
2011-07-13T07:51:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	I doubt that keyboards and mice have completely unique identifiers.
2011-07-13T07:52:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	you could write said program. Forcing them to enter the information requires knowing how to hook it into the login process, not hard, but something to keep in mind.
2011-07-13T07:52:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	if you install the C compiler, even "guest" users will be able to use it.
2011-07-13T07:52:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	The wi-fi has internet access, but to use it you have to set the gateway IP, subnet IP, and so forth
2011-07-13T07:53:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	out of the box, they'll be able to bring in executables on jump drives, but you can disable external media, again, if you know how.
2011-07-13T07:53:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	So I can't for example, install Netbeans java compiler and only allow certain users access to it?
2011-07-13T07:54:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	that's past the extent of my knowledge. I believe there are ways you can control who has access to what executables, maybe with groups? ActionParsnip might be able to chime in.
2011-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	If the executables are Windows executables and wine isn't installed, wouldn't they not be able to use them?
2011-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	correct, I meant linux executables.
2011-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	I don't know if the students are smart enough to create linux executables for hacking.
2011-07-13T07:56:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	I would make the same assumption though I would've been able to had I desired. :P It's probably a safe assumption in my opinion.
2011-07-13T07:56:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	I suspect they get Windows executables from people who make them available.
2011-07-13T07:56:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	I would suspect the same, yes.
2011-07-13T07:57:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	The thing is, these are Koreans.   Koreans are so group oriented (no original thought) that pretty much everybody just uses Windows
2011-07-13T07:58:00.000Z	bridean	magn3ts	A few questions then  1)  Does it make sense to switch to linux?   2)  If I do switch, would a different security model be better than the one I am thinking of?
2011-07-13T07:59:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	I don't know what all your users need to be able to use or what Windows software they might miss, but I guess.
2011-07-13T07:59:00.000Z	magn3ts	bridean	with proper tools, especially newer versions of Windows can be pretty securely locked down.
