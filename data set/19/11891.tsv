2010-09-03T16:15:00.000Z	hal		when I try to down my network interface eth0, and then bring it up again, it remains down
2010-09-03T16:15:00.000Z	hal		can anyone help me to bring it up please?
2010-09-03T16:15:00.000Z	hal		I have tried /etc/init.d/networking restart
2010-09-03T16:16:00.000Z	hal		I have also tried ifconfig eth0 up
2010-09-03T16:17:00.000Z	hal		I'd have to reboot
2010-09-03T16:19:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	could you try a $sudo service networking restart ?
2010-09-03T16:19:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	I tried that first, and it was not recognised
2010-09-03T16:20:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	so, /etc/init.d/network restart ?
2010-09-03T16:20:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	still nothing ?
2010-09-03T16:20:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	it returns, restart: Unknown instance:
2010-09-03T16:21:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	it is very strange that service networking restart does not work...  the script seems to be coded to recognise that
2010-09-03T16:22:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	service network restart also does not work
2010-09-03T16:22:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	indeed... I remember I  used it a lot on my test server
2010-09-03T16:23:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	i don't have any karmic here to try it out... do you understand the init scripts ?
2010-09-03T16:24:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	not fully
2010-09-03T16:24:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	when you remove the cable does it realize it? and when you put it back, does it reconnect?
2010-09-03T16:24:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	yes
2010-09-03T16:27:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	hal	are you using DHCP or STATIC IP ?
2010-09-03T16:27:00.000Z	hal	PresuntoRJ	static
