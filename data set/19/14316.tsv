2005-02-04T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	smogger911	then you don't have universe enabled

2005-02-04T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	smogger911	do you prefer to use Synaptic Package Manager (gui) to install packages?
2005-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	tritium	smogger911	open it up
2005-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	tritium	smogger911	it's in your menu.  I can't remember where it is in Warty.

2005-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	smogger911	go to "Settings->Repositories"
2005-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	smogger911	you'll need to look for the line where universe is, and make sure it's enabled
