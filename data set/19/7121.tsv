2007-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	what type of motherboard do you use?
2007-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	jroes	oliver_g_	I've got a toshiba a105-s4034 laptop
2007-10-06T09:58:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	booting from usb stick can be tricky on some hardware
2007-10-06T09:59:00.000Z	jroes	oliver_g_	I wish there was a way to see some output so I even had some sort of error to reference
2007-10-06T09:59:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	i needed to create a small boot partition on my 512 mb stick because the bios wouldn't boot otherwise
2007-10-06T09:59:00.000Z	jroes	oliver_g_	how did you figure that out?
2007-10-06T09:59:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	do you get any output at all?
2007-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	for troubleshooting, set boot sequence so that usb is tried first, then cdrom, then hdd
2007-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	... and then put a boot cd in drive
2007-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	so you don't have to wait for windows boot all the time :-)
2007-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	jroes	oliver_g_	that's what I have right now actually
2007-10-06T10:01:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	yes :-) but the ubuntu boot menu gives you time to stop the boot :-D
2007-10-06T10:02:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	IIRC there can be some other quirks for usb boot... like, you have to fiddle with the usb keyboard options in bios
2007-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	jroes	oliver_g_	hmm.. but the splash screen usually kills the display so I can't see it
2007-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	theoretically it's quite easy :-) but in practice it depends on the bios
2007-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	maybe get another (more primitive) boot cd?
2007-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	or indeed disconnect hdd and cdrom and see what the bios says
2007-10-06T10:07:00.000Z	jroes	oliver_g_	did you use the guides at pendrivelinux.com to set yours up?
2007-10-06T10:10:00.000Z	oliver_g_	jroes	i made the usb boot stick after a receipt written by a colleague
