2007-05-07T12:10:00.000Z	crdlb		and what guide?
2007-05-07T12:11:00.000Z	crdlb		just use the included open source drivers
2007-05-07T12:11:00.000Z	crdlb		they provide full 3d support
2007-05-07T12:11:00.000Z	crdlb		for your card
2007-05-07T12:12:00.000Z	crdlb		after 8.28.8 iirc
2007-05-07T12:13:00.000Z	crdlb		9500 and up
2007-05-07T12:13:00.000Z	crdlb		although I don't recommend it below the x850
2007-05-07T12:14:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	I couldn't get opengl support for ati radeon 9100 mobile card in this one lappy a friend had
2007-05-07T12:14:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	used that driver too and edited xorg to fit
2007-05-07T12:14:00.000Z	crdlb	Gerro	what driver?
2007-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	the one listed for ati in the repository, it was named like frglx something
2007-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Gerro	wrong driver
2007-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	which then? perhaps it was named radeon I forget
2007-05-07T12:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Gerro	but you have to purge fglrx, if you installed anything, you screwed it up
2007-05-07T12:16:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	oh yeah it was named radeon but it crashed anything that used 3d but with the frglx erm other one I mean it at least attempted and failed
2007-05-07T12:16:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	ah yes I always forget about purging it, probably should have blacklisted it too
2007-05-07T12:38:00.000Z	crdlb	Gerro	at that level, it's identical to ubuntu
2007-05-07T12:39:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	what is upstart?
2007-05-07T12:40:00.000Z	Gerro	crdlb	ah okay I'll read up on that
