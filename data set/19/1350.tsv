2011-03-02T01:03:00.000Z	am-dxing		whenever i write ubuntu's iso to a usb thumbdrive and boot off it (10.10) to install it, ubuntu always checks for a CD and installation always fails, any way to get around this bug?
2011-03-02T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	did you md5 test the iso you downloaded?
2011-03-02T01:04:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	yes, downloaded server, alt, and reg.; failed on all 3
2011-03-02T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	i saw a user on launchpad report that filenames over 64 chars get truncates
2011-03-02T01:06:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	the problem is all the ubuntu installers look for a CD when I am using USB to boot (using netbootin)
2011-03-02T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	what apps have you tried to put the image on the usb?
2011-03-02T01:07:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	just unetbootin so far, and also tried dd
2011-03-02T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	they don't look for cd as a matter of course. I only install with usb with zero issue
2011-03-02T01:09:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	any other software to put the iso on the usb besides netbootin? i am on arch now.
2011-03-02T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	try usb-creator or the 1-2-3 installer from pendrivelinux. Maybe unetbootin is to blame. It is the common factor
2011-03-02T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	i've not used arch, maybe it has its own tool
2011-03-02T01:11:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	that Universal USB installer is an *.exe (for windows); im on arch linux now.
2011-03-02T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	you could have a windows system too or you may dual boot. Its called: thinking outside the box
2011-03-02T01:14:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	i don't have windows to run the software.  is running MS Windows the only way to install Ubuntu on a usb drive?
2011-03-02T01:15:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	is it compatible with wine?
2011-03-02T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	i wouldn't use it in wine
2011-03-02T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	am-dxing	you can slowly burn the iso to a CD and boot that
2011-03-02T01:19:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	i have no cd drives
2011-03-02T01:24:00.000Z	am-dxing	ActionParsnip	i'll let you know how Universal USB Installer works over wine, testing it now
