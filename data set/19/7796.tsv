2007-09-22T16:32:00.000Z	XiXaQ		I'm a Xen newbie. I'm following the guide on the help pages, but I can't figure out how to use the dvd or cd as source instead of having to download everything from the net. Can someone explain this? The guide I'm talking about is this one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen
2007-09-22T16:32:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	were you using the dvd?
2007-09-22T16:33:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	I don't understand the question.
2007-09-22T16:33:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	I mean for creating guests..
2007-09-22T16:33:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	to use the cd or dvd as source, you can use the dvd of ubuntu or the alternate cd of ubuntu (not the live/desktop one)
2007-09-22T16:34:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	how?
2007-09-22T16:37:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	can you elaborate on your previous comment?
2007-09-22T16:43:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	Can I use mirror = /media/iso/feisty-alternate.iso?
2007-09-22T16:45:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	not directly to the iso. you would either insert it into the drive then execute apt-cdrom add or something similar
2007-09-22T16:46:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	oh, but I could refer to /media/cdrom for instance?
2007-09-22T16:47:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	i think you would mount the device as inserted in the standard cd/dvd rom drive, then apt-cdrom add it          and if you had the iso you should be able to mount that          mount ./ubuntu-alternate.iso /media/cdrom -o loop   for example
2007-09-22T16:47:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	but how do I use xen-tools with that=?
2007-09-22T16:48:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	sorry i am not help with xen
2007-09-22T16:50:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	yes i understood you were asking for some specific to setting up xen, which is not the support type of this channel. you were also asking for help regarding using a disc as a source
2007-09-22T16:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	yes, as a source when installing a Xen guest virtual machine.. That's special.. But my previous message was private and not meant as critisism, but as a helpful comment. :)
2007-09-22T16:54:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	I wouldn't have asked for help here if I hadn't read all available guides.
2007-09-22T16:54:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	alright. best of luck then.
2007-09-22T16:59:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	XiXaQ	had you checked ##xen ?
2007-09-22T05:01:00.000Z	XiXaQ	WaltzingAlong	yes, but they aren't familiar with Ubunutu.
