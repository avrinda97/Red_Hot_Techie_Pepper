2006-02-19T14:48:00.000Z	Draconicus		Wow. My very DEFAULT X just crashed on me, standard from the properly burned, perfectly installed Ubuntu Breezy Badger, and nobody is freaking out?!
2006-02-19T14:48:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	not in the least
2006-02-19T14:52:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	what mplayer driver were you using?
2006-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	"mplayer driver"? o_O
2006-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	-vo foo
2006-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	or vo=foo in ~/.mplayer/conifg
2006-02-19T14:55:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	Again, I can't be sure what I was playing at the time. Some files were actually deleted or moved when I had finished watching them.
2006-02-28T12:56:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	Oooh.. I like the sound of THAT feature! :P
2006-02-28T12:56:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	many are waiting for an implementation
2006-03-02T09:15:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	what encoding is that?
2006-03-02T09:15:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	It doesn't say... :\
2006-03-02T09:15:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	it's not ascii or keyboard scancode
2006-03-02T09:17:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	"keys values are in the format YXXX where Y is the device number. 0 means keyboard and XXX is the SDL define for the desired key (read SDL_keysym.h)."
2006-03-02T09:19:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	ah
2006-03-02T09:20:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	I'm not finding an SDL_keysym.h. Are you?
2006-03-02T09:24:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	you would need to install the libsdl dev package
2006-03-02T09:26:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	I'm looking at The SDL keysyms online. They look nothing like this! It shows things like SDLK_h for h
2006-03-02T09:27:00.000Z	amphi	Draconicus	I have /usr/include/SDL/SDL_keysym.h (on debian)
2006-03-02T09:28:00.000Z	Draconicus	amphi	Alright. I'll look into it.
