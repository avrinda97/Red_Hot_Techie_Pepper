2011-09-29T02:36:00.000Z	HagopH		How do I create a USB bootable Ubuntu disk if my only active system is Windows?
2011-09-29T02:36:00.000Z	HagopH		I can get to the "boot: " prompt.
2011-09-29T02:37:00.000Z	HagopH		But Ubuntu stops there.
2011-09-29T02:37:00.000Z	HagopH		I AM NOT ASKING HOW SOMETHING WORKS IN WIN!
2011-09-29T02:37:00.000Z	HagopH		I have the USB formatted and booting to Ubuntu.
2011-09-29T02:37:00.000Z	HagopH		It just stops at the "boot: " prompt.
2011-09-29T02:38:00.000Z	HagopH		That's not Windows.
2011-09-29T02:38:00.000Z	HagopH		It *does* autoformat the drive.
2011-09-29T02:38:00.000Z	HagopH		Pendrivelinux tells me to use Universal-USB-Installer-1.8.6.4.exe, which I tried.
2011-09-29T02:39:00.000Z	HagopH		Yes. I've tried two different Ubuntu distributions: ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso and ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso.
2011-09-29T02:39:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	Silly question, i know - but have you actually set up your BIOS to boot from USB?
2011-09-29T02:48:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	Can you tell me what OS you're using right now, just so I can drag up some decent instructions?
2011-09-29T02:55:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	have you used diskpart to confirm that the partition is actually active?
2011-09-29T02:56:00.000Z	HagopH	BarkingFish	I tried to partition the USB flash drive but was unable to do so.
2011-09-29T02:56:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	did it deny you access to it?
2011-09-29T02:57:00.000Z	HagopH	BarkingFish	I didn't use diskpart. I assume that's an Ubuntu program?
2011-09-29T03:01:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	OK, I'm gonna help you sort this.  Here's what I want you to do: Insert the USB stick, and open your start menu. Click run, and type compmgmt.msc
2011-09-29T03:08:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	- so the disk is marked active, the partition is good, there are no errors... Does the drive have a drive letter assigned to it?
2011-09-29T03:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish	HagopH	Looking at my notes, something may actually be wrong.  When a disk is bootable, the disk management area should show Healthy (Active, Boot) or simply Healthy (Boot)
