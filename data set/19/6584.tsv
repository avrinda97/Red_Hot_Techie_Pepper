2008-02-13T02:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	is there an actual poker game, or just hold 'em?
2008-02-13T02:51:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	no idea
2008-02-13T02:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	pmg,,.thats stupid
2008-02-13T04:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	WOOT!!!
2008-10-26T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	just add an entry with the IP address of the server you want them to get, followed by the hostname they'll be typing.
2008-10-26T19:24:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	so 69.563.443.111 www.facebook.com           for example?
2008-10-26T19:25:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	likely, if that's the IP you want them to end up at
2008-10-26T19:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	cheers dude
2008-10-26T19:26:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	although, that is not an IP to begin with
2008-10-26T19:27:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	yeah lol, how can i find the ip of a web page? i pinged www.ubuntu.com and used the ip that it resolved but when it redirects it takes me to http://www.canonical.com/
2008-10-26T19:28:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	that's what aurel42 is saying. one IP could host several actual websites. no way to get around that using /etc/hosts
2009-04-17T02:15:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	GGRRR!! :)
2009-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	Guest1405: actually, no. we don't manage the international channel. a better place would be #ubuntu-irc
2009-04-17T02:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	oh, sorry, I had no idea. Apologies
2009-10-31T02:48:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	are we allowed to do that so early after relase day? Fix things?
2009-10-31T02:49:00.000Z	LjL	Bodsda	well, it wasn't a problem *specific* to the new release... so i though i could...
2009-10-31T02:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	LjL	ah I see. In that case its ok, I want tell :)
