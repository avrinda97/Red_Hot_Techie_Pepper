2006-06-12T13:23:00.000Z	watson540		and DavidJaq , why dont you call your mobo manufacturer and get it from them?
2006-06-12T13:24:00.000Z	watson540		i dont think anyone in here can google better than the next person DavidJaq
2006-06-12T13:24:00.000Z	watson540		here's a concept, google
2006-06-12T13:24:00.000Z	DavidJaq	watson540	why don't you try to be helpful rather than just spout useless stuff? Didn't it occur to you that I tried google and couldn't find anything?
2006-06-12T13:25:00.000Z	watson540		did you see my reply about contacting your mobo manufacturer DavidJaq ?
2006-06-12T13:25:00.000Z	DavidJaq		My motherboard was made 7 years ago and the company who made my computer no longer produces my computer and their support is useless
2006-06-12T13:26:00.000Z	watson540		wow a 7 year old mobo sounds just *as* useless as the company who dies with it
2006-06-12T13:28:00.000Z	DavidJaq		I'm kind of stuck, then, because I can't boot from CD... I'm using a brand new DVD burner, my IDE cables are new, and my bios is set up so it should boot from CD before hard drive... someone told me that it means I need to update my bios
2006-06-12T13:30:00.000Z	DavidJaq		the computer won't boot from -any- bootable cd, not even officially pressed ones like my Breezy Live CD or my Windows XP cd.
2006-06-12T13:30:00.000Z	DavidJaq		a new what?
2006-06-12T13:31:00.000Z	DavidJaq		I know it sounds like BIOS, which is why I went onlin to try to find a bios update, couldn't find one so I came here thinking I could find help, but instead got told to google it
2006-06-12T13:32:00.000Z	watson540		well hrm, DavidJaq i was just suggesting google but id say if you cant find anything it doesnt exist
2006-06-12T13:32:00.000Z	watson540		but seriously a 7 yr old mobo with new dvd burner and junk, hopw fast cana  7 yr old mobo be?! p3?
2006-06-12T13:32:00.000Z	watson540		i would save trouble and go drop 100 bux on a new asus
2006-06-12T13:32:00.000Z	DavidJaq		pentium 3 600mhz. It's fast enough for WinXP
2006-06-12T13:33:00.000Z	DavidJaq		The problem is that I'm poor. I don't have money to buy a new computer
2006-06-12T13:33:00.000Z	DavidJaq		everything I have on my computer was bought for me
2006-06-12T13:34:00.000Z	watson540	DavidJaq	can you not boot from a usb flash drive? or possibly boot a linux rescue disk in your 3.5" drive to start a net install?
