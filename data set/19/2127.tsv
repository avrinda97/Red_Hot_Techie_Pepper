2010-08-24T00:15:00.000Z	n0body		any suggestions on a extreme small web browser for small laptops? I find all the firefox alike take too much space, with all the toolbars covering 1/4 of the screen
2010-08-24T00:15:00.000Z	n0body		ok guys I'll try
2010-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	smw	n0body	firefox can be made smaller
2010-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	smw	n0body	I use it on my netbook
2010-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	n0body	smw	how?
2010-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	smw	n0body	get the "classic compact" theme
2010-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	smw	n0body	next disable the bookmarks bar
2010-08-24T00:17:00.000Z	n0body	smw	okay thanks
2010-08-24T00:17:00.000Z	smw	n0body	then there is an extension to get rid of the file bar and place it on the address bar area
2010-08-24T00:18:00.000Z	n0body	smw	good advice
2010-08-24T00:18:00.000Z	smw	n0body	then get rid of the tab bar always being there (only show up when needed)
2010-08-24T00:18:00.000Z	smw	n0body	I do this to my laptop too :-)
2010-08-24T00:18:00.000Z	smw	n0body	this is years of making it smaller and smaller :-D
2010-08-24T00:19:00.000Z	smw	n0body	of course, now I only use chromium and use firefox on my netbook for its size
2010-08-24T00:20:00.000Z	smw	n0body	, I installed it after the fact. It is very easy to do
2010-08-24T00:21:00.000Z	smw	n0body	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-netbook
2010-08-24T00:21:00.000Z	n0body	smw	hmm, would that work??
2010-08-24T00:22:00.000Z	smw	n0body	it takes affect when you restart
2010-08-24T00:23:00.000Z	smw	n0body	you can switch back and forth at login :-)
