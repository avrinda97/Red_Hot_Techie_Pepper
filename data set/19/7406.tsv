2007-11-20T07:18:00.000Z	lastelement0		does the "cube" work for only 4 workspaces?
2007-11-20T07:18:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	it works for up to 19 on my computer
2007-11-20T07:19:00.000Z	lastelement0	Vovk	so you have 19 or so panels on ur cube?
2007-11-20T07:19:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	lol... i was just playing with the settings to see how high it could go, but yes, I got it to form a ring of 19 panels
2007-11-20T07:20:00.000Z	lastelement0	Vovk	hmm cuz i was messing around with it earlier yet i had lost my top and bottom panel and couldnt do anything
2007-11-20T07:20:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	first of all, are you using beryl or compiz fusion
2007-11-20T07:21:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	ok, do you have the compiz-config settings manager installed?
2007-11-20T07:21:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	so what is the problem? you no longer have a top or bottom to your cube?
2007-11-20T07:22:00.000Z	lastelement0	Vovk	if i have more than 4 workspaces...it doesnt show on the cube
2007-11-20T07:23:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	aah.. i know what the problem is
2007-11-20T07:25:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	when you increased your desktops, did you increase the number of desktops or the horizontal virtual size?
2007-11-20T07:25:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	if you increase the desktops, then you will get an error, since the cube is really one desktop with a number of virtual desktops
2007-11-20T07:25:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	you need to set desktops to 1 and then horizontal size to what you want
2007-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	the desktops are completely seperate cubes and such... i think they are supposed to be used like the extra slides in the enlightenment window manager
2007-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	i really don't understand why the extra desktops are not also virtual desktops. I think they are a more fundamental subset of the computer
2007-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	i haven't found a way to do that yet, although if you disable the cube and enable the wall, you can have a huge number of side by side workspaces
2007-11-20T07:29:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	try the desktop switcher in one of your panels... go to the leftmost one
2007-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	ooo, this is cool. if you enable the *expo* mode and hotkey it to the top left of your screen, then enable the cube and increase the vertical size, you can have as many seperate cubes as you have vertical panels. you can switch between them by going into expo mode
2007-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	Vovk	lastelement0	lol... it's in the same thing as the cube option. It creates a set of panels representing all of your desktops
