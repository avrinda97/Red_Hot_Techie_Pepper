2011-10-22T22:36:00.000Z	Masxmasx		After a failed update to 11.10 which made my system unable to boot properly, I'm trying to do a fresh install of 11.10, but it keeps stopping mid installation after spewing out a lot of starting/stopping messages. Can anyone help with that?
2011-10-22T22:36:00.000Z	bobweaver	Masxmasx	are you sure that you can not get data back ?
2011-10-22T22:36:00.000Z	Masxmasx	bobweaver	i dont care about the data
2011-10-22T22:37:00.000Z	bobweaver	Masxmasx	 you have checked the md5sum ?
2011-10-22T22:38:00.000Z	bobweaver	Masxmasx	that is allways the 1st step that I take

2011-10-22T22:48:00.000Z	Masxmasx	bobweaver	I'm currently putting the iso on the usb stick again, maybe it went wrong there
2011-10-22T22:54:00.000Z	Masxmasx	bobweaver	reput it on the sd card, still does not work. I get to the install/livecd/memtest screen, choose install on hdd, then it shows the loading screen for a good minute, then a lot of starting/stopping stuff, with one fail: Starting restore sound card(s') mixer state(s) [fail]
