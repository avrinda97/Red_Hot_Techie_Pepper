2009-10-17T17:38:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	It's no-ip, not noip.
2009-10-17T17:38:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	I know
2009-10-17T17:41:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	If you're running GNOME, open Places -> COnnect to Server
2009-10-17T17:46:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	now do I have to have openssh-server installed on the computer that is receiving the files?
2009-10-17T17:46:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	No, only the client (which already comes with Ubuntu).
2009-10-17T17:47:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	so I won't mess up anything if I "sudo apt-get purge openssh-server" ?
2009-10-17T17:47:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	You shouldn't - but I would keep the server installed, in case you want to access your PC someday
2009-10-17T17:49:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	is it safe, in the sense of hacking, to keep openssh-sever?
2009-10-17T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	As long as your password isn't "foo123"
2009-10-17T17:50:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	password to my computer?
2009-10-17T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	Yeah
2009-10-17T17:51:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	Besides... incoming connections require "port forwarding". (If you ever used BitTorrent, you'll understand.) And if you configured your router to forward port 22 to the other computer, your own isn't accessible from outside (unless you also set up another port).
2009-10-17T17:51:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	my pass is 9 characters long is that good? and I never had to port forward to use bittorent
2009-10-17T17:52:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	Yeah, that's good - but look up "dictionary attacks".
2009-10-17T17:54:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	But like I said, your own PC probably isn't accessible yet.
2009-10-17T17:56:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	what do you mean?
2009-10-17T18:01:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	You mean sshd, the server? It's automatically configured to run at startup.
2009-10-17T18:02:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	It's in /etc/rc5.d/
2009-10-17T18:05:00.000Z	grawity	ShapeShifter499_	Yeah.
