2008-02-29T19:11:00.000Z	Blice		I'm in recovery mode right now, it seems the password for my normal account has changed too.
2008-02-29T19:11:00.000Z	Blice		I changed visudo though, so that's fine.
2008-02-29T19:11:00.000Z	Blice		What file is the password for my user account kept in? :(
2008-02-29T19:12:00.000Z	Blice		Gah
2008-02-29T19:12:00.000Z	Blice		So what's the command to change my root/user password in terminal?
2008-02-29T19:13:00.000Z	Blice		Okay, I'll use passwd.
2008-02-29T19:13:00.000Z	Blice		Also, you guys should get Irssi as an IRC client ;x
2008-02-29T19:13:00.000Z	Blice		I bet you guys can't use IRC in recovery terminal like this :DDD

2008-02-29T20:16:00.000Z	Blice	test3r	I had to edit my pam so I could join this windows domain, so it would use winbind.

2008-02-29T20:26:00.000Z	Blice	test3r	You mean, connect to a computer that's part of the domain and go 'through' it? No thanks; They're all windows machines anyways, I have a feeling I'd have even more trouble. But I disgress, there's a lot of various things that I need to be a part of our domain to do.
