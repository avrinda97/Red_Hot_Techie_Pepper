2005-02-16T16:13:00.000Z	nicedreams		Anyone know when the Ubuntu / Nvidia problem is going to be fixed?
2005-02-16T16:14:00.000Z	nicedreams		the problem where it hard locks your system
2005-02-16T16:14:00.000Z	nicedreams		i've googled for over a month
2005-02-16T16:14:00.000Z	nicedreams		and people have problems with nvidia and ubuntu
2005-02-16T16:14:00.000Z	nicedreams		can you run open gl games without hard locking the system?
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	nicedreams		any time you run a real opengl app it locks the system
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	nicedreams		using the real nvidia drivers though
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	nicedreams		the ubuntu nvidia doesn't let you play games
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	nicedreams		nvidia-glx?
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	nicedreams	ubuntu is for hard-working company people only :)
2005-02-16T16:15:00.000Z	nicedreams	topyli	that makes no since
2005-02-16T16:16:00.000Z	topyli	nicedreams	no gaming ;)
2005-02-16T16:18:00.000Z	topyli	nicedreams	you should file a bug. you might have a rare combination of harware since it's working for many others
2005-02-16T16:18:00.000Z	nicedreams	topyli	i'll file a bug then.  if you google "ubuntu nvidia crash" you'll see a lot of people with the same problem
2005-02-16T16:19:00.000Z	topyli	nicedreams	then there might be a bug report already. check first, don't make a 20th duplicate :)
2005-02-16T16:19:00.000Z	nicedreams	topyli	is it in the wiki or main site?
2005-02-16T16:22:00.000Z	topyli	nicedreams	https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/
2005-02-16T16:22:00.000Z	nicedreams	topyli	i found it..  :)
2005-02-16T16:23:00.000Z	topyli	nicedreams	was just surfing so... ;)
