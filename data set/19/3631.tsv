2009-07-02T04:19:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	I don't know but you might run a memtest
2009-07-02T04:19:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	the mem is fine.
2009-07-02T04:20:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	I don't know then...  Sorry...
2009-07-02T04:20:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	The numbers are different every time it shuts down also
2009-07-02T05:13:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	Try:  shutdown -r now
2009-07-02T05:15:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	stuck on the other line that states "*Stopping GNOME Display Manager... [ OK ]
2009-07-02T05:17:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	What happens when you hit the power button.  (That's how I shut mine down.)
2009-07-02T05:19:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	I can only shutdown once it freezes by holding down the power button. Nothing happens when I just press it and then release it.
2009-07-02T05:19:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	bastidrazor is correct, shutdown does not turn off the computer.
2009-07-02T05:21:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	I don't know, but sounds like acpi is broken.  See:  http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/acpi/
2009-07-02T05:22:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	If you hit the power button when the system is running, it is supposed to shut down the OS and power off the PC, (if all is working as expected).
2009-07-02T05:26:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	I use the shut down command from the desktop to init the shut down. It starts to shut down by going black and it shows "Broadcast message from root@holly-desktop (unknown) at <time>", which then repeats before "The system is going down for halt NOW!"
2009-07-02T05:38:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	does a desktop need acpi installed to shut down correctly?
2009-07-02T05:38:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	Yes
2009-07-02T05:40:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	apt-get install acpi  acpid acpi-support
2009-07-02T05:42:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	then what?
2009-07-02T05:43:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	Then try it and see if it works.
2009-07-02T05:44:00.000Z	usr13	DarkMage26	reboot
2009-07-02T05:47:00.000Z	DarkMage26	usr13	no such luck. still need to hold the power button to complete the shutdown. :(
