2010-09-24T03:50:00.000Z	tru3fate		can anyone help me with a virtualbox error. error saids VirtualBox cant operate in VMX root mode.Please disable the kvm kernel extension, recompile your kernel and reboot.
2010-09-24T03:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	do you have kvm installed?  especially the kernel acceleration part (i forgot what it's called)?
2010-09-24T03:54:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	I install kvm dont know what kernel acceleration to install.
2010-09-24T03:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	can you uninstall kvm?  might be the easiest, you'll might have to run "sudo apt-get auto-remove" (only do if prompted after kvm removal to remove anything else it may have installed), obviously if you need both then you have an issue.
2010-09-24T04:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	keep it in channel please
2010-09-24T04:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	when you removed kvm did it say certain packages where no longer needed?  have you rebooted the system?
2010-09-24T04:03:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	no nothing just remove
2010-09-24T04:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	have you tried vbox again?
2010-09-24T04:04:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	same error with it remove
2010-09-24T04:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	have you rebooted?
2010-09-24T04:05:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	reboot my box , or virtualbox
2010-09-24T04:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	if it's a kernel module that's loaded, it might still be loaded even though you've uninstalled kvm (which i'm unsure if it uninstalled the kvm kernel stuff!), but rebooted would clear that stuff up - so i'd try it (it would be possible to do without rebooting if we knew the module name that kvm loads)
2010-09-24T04:08:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	i dont know if this helps (VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE) it also has that in the error
2010-09-24T04:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	doesn't help me i'm affraid - i haven't used kvm in a million years, i only use vbox now (& vmware for school) - but this kvm/vbox issue has been around for a long time!
2010-09-24T04:11:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	is there another type i can use that is more useful less errors
2010-09-24T04:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	your current issue is due to having too many installed at one time, i doubt adding more would help ;)  vbox is GREAT for me, but VMware is good as well.  i don't like kvm/qemu nearly as much, but it's all personal preferences/needs.
2010-09-24T04:14:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	ok so ill uninstall everything dealing with vbox
2010-09-24T04:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tru3fate	i think vbox is the one you should use ;)  it's all up to you.
2010-09-24T04:16:00.000Z	tru3fate	ZykoticK9	Vbox is same as virtualbox right?
