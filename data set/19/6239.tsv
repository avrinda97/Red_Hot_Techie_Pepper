2008-03-09T16:51:00.000Z	fredmv		Alright, I have a _dumb_ problem..
2008-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	fredmv		I modified my username via System->Admin->Users/Groups, but I didn't update my home dir.  Now when logging in, everything is broke because it's looking in the old /home dir...
2008-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	fredmv		So now, as suggested, I'm trying to use usermod, but it doesn't appear to be doing anything.
2008-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	fredmv		I ran: # usermod -d /home/fredmv fredmv which should be the proper command.   The dir is still 'fmv'.
2008-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	you will need to rename the dir
2008-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	can't do that.
2008-03-09T16:55:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	you can't log in at all? this is the only account on the system?
2008-03-09T16:56:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	I'm logged in as root trying to make these changes.   If I try editing the /home dir as you suggest, it gives me an error.
2008-03-09T16:57:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	what command are you trying to run? you should be able to run: mv /home/fmv /home/fredmv
2008-03-09T16:57:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	so if I log in, it's trying to access stuff from /home/<old usr> and GNOME crashes.
2008-03-09T16:57:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	I'm working with usermod.   Perhaps I could do something like adduser, make a new account, and then do it via GUI (newb solution)
2008-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	usermod can't do what you want
2008-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	the user has already been modified
2008-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	so what should I do?    Try mv'ing it?
2008-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	your problem is that the directory has the wrong name
2008-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	mv /home/fmv /home/fredmv
2008-03-09T16:59:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	 exactly
2008-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	fredmv	v3ctor	 _thank you_ very much.  I would've never thought to 'mv' it.   Worked perfectly.
2008-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	v3ctor	fredmv	no problem, tis what we are here for
