2009-03-12T01:01:00.000Z	ManaPirat		Hi There
2009-03-12T01:02:00.000Z	ManaPirat		my main administrator user cannot log in (screen size issue) - how can I let my second user get adinsitrator rights?
2009-03-12T01:03:00.000Z	ManaPirat		I tried sudo usermod -aG admin <myuser>
2009-03-12T01:03:00.000Z	ManaPirat		in a recovery terminal
2009-03-12T01:04:00.000Z	ManaPirat		anybody?
2009-03-12T01:04:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	Just a sec...\
2009-03-12T01:11:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	Still there?
2009-03-12T01:12:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	You have added a new user and want to give him same rights as the original one?  Is that it?
2009-03-12T01:13:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	Edit file /etc/group and add a comma and your new user name to the end of each line that has the original user name.
2009-03-12T01:13:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	And then log out and back in again and you'll have privilidges.
2009-03-12T01:15:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	No.
2009-03-12T01:16:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	But you'll have to do it in the original user's account.  Or do it in single user mode.
2009-03-12T01:17:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	Let's say the old user was fred and the new one is jim, you'll see several lines that end with fred, just put ,jim after them so that they look like  fred,jim
2009-03-12T01:18:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	But you shouldn't need to add a new user to fix the problem.
2009-03-12T01:18:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	Just do Ctrl-Alt-F6 and go to console mode and fix the X server.
2009-03-12T01:18:00.000Z	ManaPirat	usr13	I kinda found the tnries that way you describe it
2009-03-12T01:21:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	tnries ?
2009-03-12T01:29:00.000Z	ManaPirat	usr13	solved the problem - either via adding to sudoers or because of restart idk
2009-03-12T01:30:00.000Z	usr13	ManaPirat	Ok, sorry I wasn't more help
