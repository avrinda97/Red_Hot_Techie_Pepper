2011-05-02T10:07:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	it is odd that ubuntu does not install it by itself
2011-05-02T09:52:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	install it
2011-05-02T09:53:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager start
2011-05-02T09:53:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	then run network manager
2011-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	the job is already running!
2011-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	then run the executable for it whatever it's called
2011-05-02T10:03:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	what executable should i run? there is nothing other than the service...
2011-05-02T10:03:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	one moment i'll look it up
2011-05-02T10:03:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	ok :)
2011-05-02T10:05:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	nmcli
2011-05-02T10:06:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	nmcli: error while loading shared libraries: libnss3.so.1d: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2011-05-02T10:06:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	this was the problem
2011-05-02T10:06:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	so install the libraries networkmanager relies on
2011-05-02T10:08:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	? why should it?
2011-05-02T10:08:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	because it installs one package by default, without its dependencies?
2011-05-02T10:09:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	it should work on a fresh installation
2011-05-02T10:10:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	blame the package manager and just becauase YOU need those libraries doesn't mean everyone else wants them
2011-05-02T10:10:00.000Z	d4gg3r	celthunder	network manager is not something that I only want!
2011-05-02T10:11:00.000Z	celthunder	d4gg3r	i didn't say that
