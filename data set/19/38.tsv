2012-11-22T02:43:00.000Z	bearlockhomes		I'm having an issue with a usb-vga graphics connection in 12.10 and was wondering if anyone would be able to help?
2012-11-22T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	does it show in the output of:  sudo lshw -C display
2012-11-22T02:45:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	no. but it is identified for lsusb
2012-11-22T02:46:00.000Z	bearlockhomes		much of the issue is summarized here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1050566, but it stands unresolved
2012-11-22T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	cool, any results online for the 8 character hex ID?
2012-11-22T02:47:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	0711:5100
2012-11-22T02:50:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	One point that I noted in the bug report was that the ID needed to be added to the driver table under sisusb_table, but I'm not sure how that is done. Any ideas?
2012-11-22T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	seems to use the sisusbvga driver
2012-11-22T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	you may need an xorg.conf to make it fly
2012-11-22T02:52:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	That was alluded to in much older versions (circa 9.10) with the same issue but figured enough of xorg had updated through 12.10 for that to not be necessary.
2012-11-22T02:53:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	I'll give it a try. Just as a refresh xorg conf should go in the dir /etc/x11/xorg.conf?
2012-11-22T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	xorg.conf can be necessary, if one xists it wil be obeyed
2012-11-22T02:55:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	Sounds good. Thank you for your time.
2012-11-22T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	is the system a laptop?
2012-11-22T02:56:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	yes, thinkpad t500 ATI radeon
2012-11-22T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	makes sense then
2012-11-22T02:57:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	could you elaborate? Is there something related to lenovo drivers?
2012-11-22T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bearlockhomes	i was just going to suggest a PCI video card if the system was a desktop
2012-11-22T02:59:00.000Z	bearlockhomes	ActionParsnip	Gotcha. Thanks again.
