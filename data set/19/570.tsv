2012-01-02T02:31:00.000Z	_Marcus		How do I switch what screen I am on with the screen command? I am currently inside a Java program which is command line and I using ssh to access the server. I want to go to the main terminal without opening another ssh session.
2012-01-02T02:31:00.000Z	_Marcus		Once it worked with the down arrow key but it just says "Wuf ----- Wuf"
2012-01-02T02:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 alt arrow
2012-01-02T02:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 rather F3 and F4
2012-01-02T02:45:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 yes, i used to do it
2012-01-02T03:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 don't forget to mention that you're on a mac, with different keybindings
2012-01-02T03:04:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	it shouldn't matter as long as I am not using the function keys
2012-01-02T03:05:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 fair enough, but don't you think you should better ask in a mac support channel?
2012-01-02T03:06:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	They would redirect me here anyway, It's an Ubuntu machine I am accessing with SSH and it's a command bulit into Ubuntu
2012-01-26T19:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 go and tell them :)
2012-02-10T21:26:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 use gdebi
2012-02-10T21:28:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 in the future, please inform us that you wish to work with the CLI
2012-02-10T21:28:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	Sorry
2012-02-12T06:53:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	What if they say "mint" as in "mint gum"
2012-02-20T21:11:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 http://www.brudvik.org/2011/02/chrootjail-sftpscpssh-on-ubuntu/
2012-03-29T18:53:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	Nothing much, just sitting here at my computer on xChat like normal.
2012-04-22T18:31:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	##windows wont help him, I think he should try #wine
2012-08-07T01:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	_Marcus	 please remove the underscore in your nic - no CDE is for unix
2012-08-07T01:41:00.000Z	_Marcus	MonkeyDust	First you guys wanted me to remove the `, now the _? I can't go any lower using a nick I own. But I'll switch anyway
