2007-02-27T13:09:00.000Z	ToddEDM		hey crimeboy, what was that command you gave me, for shutting down X
2007-02-27T13:11:00.000Z	ToddEDM		but X is still running
2007-02-27T13:12:00.000Z	ToddEDM		what im trying to do is install some nvidia drivers
2007-02-27T13:12:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	that will close gnome and all open apps, but it'll let you install the nvidia drivers
2007-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	ToddEDM		thanks
2007-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	what drivers are you trying to install?
2007-02-27T13:14:00.000Z	ToddEDM	Prometheum	 some video driver... not even sure if its the right one
2007-02-27T13:14:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	make sure you have all of the open source ones removed before installing the binaries, that'll lead to the "version mismatch" error. Also, comment out the DRI line.
2007-02-27T13:15:00.000Z	ToddEDM		ohhh christ, all i want is to get this scrolling undr control
2007-02-27T13:15:00.000Z	ToddEDM		its sooo slow
2007-02-27T13:15:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	this is the best guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual?highlight=%28NvidiaManual%29
2007-02-27T13:16:00.000Z	ToddEDM		thanks Prometheum
2007-02-27T13:17:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	no problem, I had the same issue when I first started with Linux. Be thankful you're with nvidia, other comanies don't care about *nix as much
2007-02-27T13:18:00.000Z	ToddEDM		hey Prometheum ,Linux AMD64/EM64T would be for turion64 x2?
2007-02-27T13:19:00.000Z	Prometheum	ToddEDM	yes, it would
2007-02-27T13:19:00.000Z	ToddEDM		cool, i picked the right one
2007-02-27T13:19:00.000Z	ToddEDM		lol
