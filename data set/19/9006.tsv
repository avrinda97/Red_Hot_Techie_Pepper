2007-01-25T13:42:00.000Z	bef		But Coca Cola is a corporate whore; I think it's rather fitting in that circumtance ;)
2007-01-25T13:44:00.000Z	bef		Yes, you are going to want to make a secondary partition to run Ubuntu or your linux distro from
2007-01-25T13:44:00.000Z	bef		and you'll need to steal some space from the Windows
2007-01-25T13:44:00.000Z	bef		in sudoers list
2007-01-25T13:45:00.000Z	bef		you might need wheel, or to edit sudoers list :] 
2007-01-25T13:46:00.000Z	bef		Depends how much more space you'll use up on windows as to how much you leave it with ;)
2007-01-25T13:47:00.000Z	bef		Are you going to be using Ubuntu as your _primary_ OS?
2007-01-25T13:47:00.000Z	bef		I'm in agreement with Toma
2007-01-25T13:48:00.000Z	bef		lol
2007-01-25T13:48:00.000Z	bef		I got 5gig swap
2007-01-25T13:49:00.000Z	Toma-	bef	why so much?
2007-01-25T13:50:00.000Z	Toma-	bef	hmm touche. thats why i prefer a swapfile tho. running out of space? no worries! just rm the swapfile and dd a new one
2007-04-09T08:46:00.000Z	Toma-	bef	nautilus would be nicer
2007-04-09T08:48:00.000Z	Toma-	bef	nautilus is the thing you look at your files with in gnome
2007-04-09T08:48:00.000Z	bef	Toma-	 lol yeh, I'm having a bad night. So where can I locate the nautilus ftp client
2007-04-09T08:49:00.000Z	Toma-	bef	open nautilus, hit "Ctrl L" i think to get the location op and enter the ftp ip
2007-04-09T08:50:00.000Z	bef	Toma-	foutrelis: toddobryan: I don't think I'm making myself clear, maybe I am, I'm wanting a client for uploading files to my website ;)
2007-04-09T08:50:00.000Z	Toma-	bef	yep. itll do that.
2007-04-09T08:51:00.000Z	bef	Toma-	foutrelis: toddobryan: thanks :)
