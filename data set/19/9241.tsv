2007-01-08T12:14:00.000Z	hjmills		hi - i have a problem - i want to learn to program quite quickly so i can create decent apps (pref gui) because if i do all the cli apps and build up to bigger apps i just get bored
2007-01-08T12:15:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	try #programming
2007-01-08T12:15:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	thanks
2007-01-29T12:20:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	there's just quite different. locate is fast, because it uses a database. however, the database is updated only daily (by default). find is slower but actually searches the filesystem, and has a load of options for narrowing down your searches
2007-02-01T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	whole thing
2007-02-01T11:39:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	recently, a feature was added to APT whereby, when you *update* (not upgrade), only the diffs of the package *lists* are downloaded. however, nothing like that is implemented for the packages themselves
2007-02-01T11:39:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	oh ok - moving in the right direction then
2007-02-05T15:36:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	now thats a more sensible idea
2007-10-01T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	read -n 1
2007-10-01T08:10:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	thanks
2007-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	what does the -n 1 bit do?
2007-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	stops reading after one character.  help read 
2007-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	thanks - i tried man but that got me nowhere
2007-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	internal bash commands aren't documented by man, only help
2007-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	thanks
2007-10-01T09:06:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	shell commands that don't really conform to the POSIX standard, but work in bash
2007-10-01T09:07:00.000Z	LjL	hjmills	zenity --info --text=$(command)
2007-10-01T09:07:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	ok thanks
2007-10-01T09:09:00.000Z	hjmills	LjL	magnetron, thanks - thats sorted my problem - thanks very much for all the help
