2009-10-31T13:02:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets		Hey guys, if I'm using Ubuntu right now and I want to make my system boot from a windows disk, how do I do that?
2009-10-31T13:02:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	you have a separate partition containing your Windows installation?
2009-10-31T13:18:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	You want to reboot the computer and log onto Vista?
2009-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	When I reboot, I'd like the system to boot from the DVD instead so that I can install it
2009-10-31T13:19:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	What is it currently doing?
2009-10-31T13:20:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	does it currently boot straight into Ubuntu?
2009-10-31T13:20:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	Yeah, straight into Karmic
2009-10-31T13:20:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	Change your BIOS settings to boot from the DVD drive
2009-10-31T13:21:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	How does one do this? :P
2009-10-31T13:22:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	when you reboot your computer, you can typically go into the BIOS settings by pressing F2
2009-10-31T13:23:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	your computer should briefly display a message like "Press F2 to enter BIOS" on bootup
2009-10-31T13:23:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	Oh, alright, sounds good :)
2009-10-31T13:23:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	you should do it quickly before it boots into Ubuntu

2009-10-31T13:25:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	Alright, sounds good! Time to re-find my Vista :P
2009-10-31T13:48:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	were you able to get into the BIOS settings?
2009-10-31T13:48:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	I don't think so
2009-10-31T13:49:00.000Z	secret901	MasterofPuppets	how did you install Ubuntu anyhow?
2009-10-31T13:49:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	secret901	Downloaded the karmic image from the main site and installed
