2010-02-11T06:07:00.000Z	MWisBest		I have this stupid CPU monitor stuck in my upper right corner. It's transparent, has a graph thing, and... it's ugly. Anyone know how to get rid of it?
2010-02-11T06:09:00.000Z	MWisBest		Well I'm in Kubuntu but I can't get any help over there.
2010-02-11T06:09:00.000Z	MWisBest		I don't know what the heck it is.
2010-02-11T06:09:00.000Z	MWisBest		Nooo
2010-02-11T06:09:00.000Z	MWisBest		Something to do with the virtuoso-server upgrade.
2010-02-11T06:09:00.000Z	MWisBest		Nope.
2010-02-11T06:10:00.000Z	MWisBest		It's not.
2010-02-11T06:10:00.000Z	MWisBest		How would I do that jrib?
2010-02-11T06:11:00.000Z	MWisBest		Yep.
2010-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	AssociateX	MWisBest	that will work if it's a widget
2010-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	MWisBest	AssociateX	It's not a widget. It's not in there.
2010-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	AssociateX	MWisBest	dang, sorry then
2010-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	MWisBest		Could it have ANYTHING to do with this virtuoso-server package that was breaking my dist-upgrade in Lucid?
2010-02-11T06:14:00.000Z	AssociateX	MWisBest	is it something in ~/.kde/Autostart
2010-02-11T06:14:00.000Z	MWisBest		I found a way around it but found out I didn't need what it installed and then I uninstalled it, rebooted, and this ugly thing is on my screen.
2010-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	AssociateX	MWisBest	what did you install?
2010-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	AssociateX		then uninstall?
2010-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	MWisBest		virtuoso-server.
2010-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	AssociateX	MWisBest	ok, good luck anyway
