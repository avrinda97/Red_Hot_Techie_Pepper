2005-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	inc7		i installed using terminal, and instructions but now i cant run or have firefox recognize for a stream
2005-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	inc7		to install, i installed in home folder
2005-08-30T05:47:00.000Z	inc7		no, downloaded for website

2005-08-30T05:48:00.000Z	inc7		not listed?
2005-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	inc7		can not display location file//:relplay
2005-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	inc7		can i double click icon suposed to run?
2005-08-30T05:52:00.000Z	inc7		home/inc7/RealPlayer
2005-08-30T05:53:00.000Z	inc7		thats where it is, i type that in and it opens the folder?
2005-08-30T05:53:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 so maybe thats a folder and not an executable
2005-08-30T06:17:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 why not install realplayer from the repositories
2005-08-30T06:41:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 ppc and x86 refers to cpu-architechture
2005-08-30T06:41:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 and ubuntu has builds for both
2005-08-30T06:43:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 im sure the amd64 can run x86 builds.. the amd64 builds are only optimized for your cpu
2005-08-30T06:43:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 and the amd64 build is not as mature as the x86  from what i've seen
2005-08-30T06:46:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 if you installed the x86 then all is fine
2005-08-30T06:47:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	that's fine too if you've got a AMD64 cpu
2005-08-30T06:47:00.000Z	kemik	inc7	 but as i said, it's not as mature build as the x86, so if you feel that youre very new to linux, maybe you should try the x86 to start with
