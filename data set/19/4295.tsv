2009-03-25T21:15:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		People I am in deep trouble! I need help!!!
2009-03-25T21:16:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		I have been working on Ubuntu over a year now!
2009-03-25T21:17:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		today Ubuntu suddenly is not loading
2009-03-25T21:17:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		it reaches the grub, loads ubuntu, the progress bar loads completely, then the waiting cursor comes and it just keeps waiting
2009-03-25T21:17:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		I never reach the login screen
2009-03-25T21:17:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	what error message do you get while booting ?
2009-03-25T21:18:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	try booting without the splash screen
2009-03-25T21:18:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	digen	how??
2009-03-25T21:18:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	From the Grub menu for the kernel entry, remove the string 'string' and press enter, immediately press 'b' to boot
2009-03-25T21:19:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	when you reach the Grub menu, you should see instructions for selecting and passing options to the kernel
2009-03-25T21:19:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	digen	so I should press 'e' to edit it first
2009-03-25T21:19:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	digen	yes ok go on
2009-03-25T21:19:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	yes that's correct
2009-03-25T21:20:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	digen	ok I will do that and see what error I am getting
2009-03-25T21:20:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	without the splash screen will show the finer details of what is going on
2009-03-25T21:20:00.000Z	digen	dhruvasagar	good luck !
2009-03-25T21:20:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	digen	yea I know that, just didn't know how to skip loader
