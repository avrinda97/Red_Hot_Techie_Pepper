2007-01-24T06:59:00.000Z	GillBates		i am planning on to start witha server installation....what should i do after that? anyone please
2007-01-24T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	actually, the Alternate CD will allow that, too. but if you get the Minimal you won't download stuff that you aren't going to use. *don't* use the Desktop CD, it won't allow that
2007-01-24T07:02:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	did you see my two messages?
2007-01-24T07:03:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	that is, the bot factoid and the alternate cd comment
2007-01-24T07:04:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	actually, the Alternate CD will allow that, too. but if you get the Minimal you won't download stuff that you aren't going to use. *don't* use the Desktop CD, it won't allow that
2007-01-24T07:05:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	well it's your decision whether to hunt them down or reinstall with the minimal or alternate cd... however, removing them manually isn't so hard if you know what are the main dependencies
2007-01-24T07:06:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	in the end you want to have a text-mode only install?
2007-01-24T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	well then what you need to make sure is to never remove any package that's depended upon by ubuntu-standard (and specifically ubuntu-minimal!). if apt-get remove something tells you that one of those is being removed, don't say Yes to it
2007-01-24T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	if you want to remove most of your current GUI stuff, i'd remove libgnome or even libgtk, that will get rid of a lot of stuff. of course, you'll be left with text-mode or a safemode-only CX
2007-01-24T07:10:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	i mean X. you could even just remove everything that is *not* part of ubuntu-standard - that way you'd end up with something that's just about exactly like the minimal CD in its minimal option
2007-01-24T07:11:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	note that you want to use "--purge remove" if you want the configuration files wiped too, of course. "--purge autoremove" will also help on Edgy
2007-01-24T07:11:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	no, you won't have a GUI
2007-01-24T07:11:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	to install one you can get the xorg package... and then, of course, your favorite WM
2007-01-24T07:12:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	i don't believe there is something just like that, so your best bet is still to either remove everything you don't want, or remove *everything* except ubuntu-standard and then reinstall the stuff you need
2007-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	if it were me, i think i'd remove libgtk and then install the stuff i need
2007-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	of course if you're left with no X and need help, you can install irssi to IRC from the console
2007-01-24T07:16:00.000Z	LjL	GillBates	keep in mind that as long as 1) you can use the console (or at least irssi)  2) you don't remove files manually  3) you don't remove anything that belongs to ubuntu-minimal (or even ubuntu-standard just to be on the safe side) -> then there's no way you can *really* ruin your system
