2007-09-27T10:42:00.000Z	vsayikiran		is there any way to store a package in hard disk from ubuntu repos
2007-09-27T10:42:00.000Z	vsayikiran		package can be anything like vlc, video codecs, xmms, etc
2007-09-27T10:43:00.000Z	vsayikiran		hmpmstr: i didnt get you,
2007-09-27T10:44:00.000Z	vsayikiran		suppose i want vlc.deb package including all audio,video codecs, then what to do.
2007-09-27T10:44:00.000Z	vsayikiran		hmpmstr: then to install .deb what is needed
2007-09-27T10:46:00.000Z	vsayikiran		so installing .deb package is similar to installing any windows setup.exe file
2007-09-27T10:48:00.000Z	vsayikiran		and what about the codecs, how to install them
2007-09-27T10:48:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	No, it will only install whats inside the package, but not any of the dependencies.
2007-09-27T10:50:00.000Z	vsayikiran	nbkr	i also want that all dependencies should be stored locally, suppose i want to reinstall ubuntu and i dont have net connection then i can install the .deb package
2007-09-27T10:51:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	Than you have to download all the packages that vlc depends on. And all packags that those packages depend on ...
2007-09-27T10:52:00.000Z	vsayikiran	nbkr	then it is a difficult task, to do that , but i think ubuntu without net connection is difficult to update
2007-09-27T10:54:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	Well - just see what dependencies vlc has. It aren't so many.
2007-09-27T10:55:00.000Z	vsayikiran	nbkr	thats ok but i am saying i general, people who dont have net connection cannot benefit from ubuntu
2007-09-27T10:55:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	They can order a CD - even for free.
2007-09-27T10:56:00.000Z	vsayikiran	nbkr	but that CD will only install OS , but not all the codecs, dependencies, packages.... etc
2007-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	Same than for any other operating system, isn't it?
2007-09-27T10:59:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	But you still have to download a file -> You have net connection -> You can use apt ...
2007-09-27T11:00:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	Pardon?
2007-09-27T11:01:00.000Z	nbkr	vsayikiran	The servers are even mirrored by others all over the world.
