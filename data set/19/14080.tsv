2004-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	joshua__	nomasteryoda	no... warty is on /dev/hda5 and hoary is on /dev/hda4... the roots are (hd0,3) and (hd,4) respectively
2004-12-20T11:16:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	joshua__	i remember booting with the ubuntu bootable cd then modifiying the grub file to match
2004-12-20T11:16:00.000Z	joshua__	nomasteryoda	i can get into warty just fine, so i can edit grub to point to the right place
2004-12-20T11:17:00.000Z	joshua__	nomasteryoda	im telling grub to look in the correct place, its just getting lost
