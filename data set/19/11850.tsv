2005-12-09T12:22:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	do you have a console port on your switch?
2005-12-09T12:22:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	yes.. but don't have a com cable
2005-12-09T12:23:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	is there a reset button on the switch?
2005-12-09T12:23:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	what kind of switch is it?
2005-12-09T12:25:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	it's a notel baystack 350-24T.. not sure where the reset switch is though
2005-12-09T12:29:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	 it might not allow connections on port 23 you need to connect to it using a serial cable
2005-12-09T12:31:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	have you been looking on the net for documentation
2005-12-09T12:34:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	yes.. and found some, but i haven't studied networking, so aren't familiar with some of the terminology and such.
2005-12-09T12:34:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	have you been here: http://www130.nortelnetworks.com/cgi-bin/eserv/cs/main.jsp?level=1&category=8&subcategory=&subtype=&tranProduct=8122&resetFilter=1&pfTypeList=alpha&level1List=1&productList=8122&contentTypeList=8
2005-12-09T12:37:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	thanks.. think so, but will see if there's other files i missed that will help
2005-12-09T12:42:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	the documentation says that you can connect to the COM port using a straight through DB-9 with a straight through standard serial port cable
2005-12-09T12:44:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	just db9 to db9 - switch to computer? i don't have a cable though
2005-12-09T12:44:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	yeah you need to get a serial cable...
2005-12-09T12:46:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	its good to have one anyways... after you get the cable look up information on building your own cables with RJ45 DB-9 & RJ45 DB-25 connectors, you can easily change the pinouts to connect to anything
2005-12-09T12:52:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	if making a serial cable, would i just wire the connectors pin to pin (ie. pin1 to pin1, pin3 to pin3)?
2005-12-09T12:53:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	you need three things.  1 straight through (regular) ethernet cable, 2 DB-9 (straight through)
2005-12-09T12:54:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	straight through means just like you said, pin1 -> pin1 ...etc...
2005-12-09T12:55:00.000Z	rabeldable	drummer87	the DB-9 connectors should be RJ45 DB-9 connectors
2005-12-09T13:04:00.000Z	drummer87	rabeldable	hmm.. thanks, but i'm a little confused. should i make a cable with serial to serial, or serial to ethernet (rj45)? and how would i connect to the com port on the switch with the rj45 one?
