2006-06-10T15:03:00.000Z	livingdaylight		What's the deal when i've downloaded stuff and it don't show up?
2006-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight		hello?
2006-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight		arrr
2006-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Well, i've downloaded VolumeControl and it aint there
2006-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	doesn't show up in the menus?
2006-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	if you can figure out what the program is called (to run it in a terminal) you can use alacarte to add it to your menus
2006-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	thats right
2006-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	in a previous install both breezy and dapper it is just there. This time its not though, should i worry?
2006-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	in ADD/Remove Programs under sound there is volume control. I also went to synaptics and installed two volume control clients and none show up in menus
2006-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	oh, i believe those are hidden by default
2006-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	as i said i always had a volume controller in menus before after installing
2006-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	start up alacarte (Applications->Accessories->Alacarte Menu Editor) and make sure they've got tick marks in the Sound section
2006-06-10T15:12:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	ok, now i feel stupid, Doh...i swear i didn't used to have to do that. It would just be in menus after installing - thx!
2007-10-15T14:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	Wow, breezy is _really_ old
2007-10-15T14:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	Yeah, that's about 2 years old
2007-10-15T14:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	It doesn't even get security updates anymore
2007-10-15T14:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	livingdaylight	It'd probably take about 24 hours to upgrade since you have to go from version to version, I suggest you download the Ubuntu 7.10 Release Candidate and do a clean install with it.
2007-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	i tried geubuntu but had troubles with applications menu in it and they at #geubuntu tried to help me and must have in the process removed the metadata
2007-12-19T06:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Amaranth	you seemed to know what is up
