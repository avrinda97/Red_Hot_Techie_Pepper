2009-08-21T11:10:00.000Z	Paraj		Who here has been using (or attempting to use) Ubuntu since 5.10?
2009-08-21T11:12:00.000Z	Paraj		Where is the channel which actually does support? :P
2009-08-21T11:12:00.000Z	Paraj		Really, could have fooled me :P
2009-08-21T11:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	thats because you are easily fooled

2009-08-21T11:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	you need never ask again
2009-08-21T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	whack it in your favourites and you are set for life
2009-08-21T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	then put /home on a sperate partition
2009-08-21T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	or have a backup copy of ~/.mozilla before reinstall
2009-08-21T11:25:00.000Z	Paraj	ActionParsnip	I knew you'd say that, means nothing I can't get the damn OS working
2009-08-21T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	well keep punching till you work it out, if you use advanced partitioning you canspecify partition sizes, you need a swap partition a / partition and a /home partition, make / about 10Gb and use the rest for /home, when you reinstall, simply tell the installer the format the / partition and tell it to mount the largest partition as /home
2009-08-21T11:27:00.000Z	Paraj	ActionParsnip	That's not the problem, my problems all relate after installation like the one I'm having now with updating the assorted linux-restricted-module
2009-08-21T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	does your CD verify as ok? Bad media will make a bad install
2009-08-21T11:31:00.000Z	Paraj	ActionParsnip	Media is fine
2009-08-21T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	ok thats cool
2009-08-21T11:31:00.000Z	Paraj	ActionParsnip	I get a "Fatal: raid_setup: stat("/dev/sdh")" error during update for linux-restricted-module s. I'm using LILO
2009-08-21T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	i find lilo more flexible
2009-08-21T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Paraj	but i only single boot linux so a fancy bootloader is wasted on me
2009-08-21T11:33:00.000Z	Paraj	ActionParsnip	This is a single boot also, at first I thought it was because my /boot partition was too small (As shown in a few bugs in launchpad) but that's not the case
