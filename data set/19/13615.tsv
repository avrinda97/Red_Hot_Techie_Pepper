2005-02-23T15:17:00.000Z	ProgramGeek		Ah...
2005-02-23T15:18:00.000Z	ProgramGeek		Hmm, the best you can do in the middle of install to change keyboard layout is to stop it and try again.. Because all it does is put a writefile on wait
2005-02-23T15:18:00.000Z	ProgramGeek		Well, for the X-installation of the keyboard layout, unless you speaking of before that...

2005-02-23T15:20:00.000Z	ProgramGeek		Tobbe, does the keymapping affect you out of X too?
2005-02-23T15:20:00.000Z	ProgramGeek		Because I know how to change keymapping for X, but not otherwise.
