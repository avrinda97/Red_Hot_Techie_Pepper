2011-09-04T05:44:00.000Z	BarkingFish		guys, can I just check with you, all the bugs in kubuntu go onto the ubuntu launchpad, don't they?
2011-09-04T05:44:00.000Z	tardis	BarkingFish	Kubuntu like to report things upstream if it's a KDE issue. Ask #kubuntu-devel
2011-09-04T05:45:00.000Z	BarkingFish		I've discovered a very severe security bug in kubuntu 11.04, and want to speak to a dev about it in pm if possible, tardis - I don't know if it's just a KDE bug or not.
2011-09-04T05:45:00.000Z	tardis	BarkingFish	pay a visit to the aforementioned channel, then ;)
2011-09-04T05:45:00.000Z	BarkingFish		I'm in there, I've asked and nobody is responding
2011-09-04T05:46:00.000Z	tardis	BarkingFish	be patient
2011-09-04T05:46:00.000Z	BarkingFish		It's 2.45 am, and I need to get some sleep soon :)   I don't know how much patience a tired guy has!
2011-09-04T05:47:00.000Z	BarkingFish		i'm guessing it's not a lot if I'm anything to go by
2011-09-04T05:52:00.000Z	BarkingFish		there's a channel here for mint support, cypher - but there's only 2 people in it right now
2011-09-04T05:52:00.000Z	BarkingFish		try ##mint the next time you come on
2011-09-04T05:54:00.000Z	tardis		!mintsupport | BarkingFish: for future reference
2011-09-04T05:54:00.000Z	tardis		the channel's not on freenode ;)(
2011-09-04T05:54:00.000Z	tardis		s/(//
2011-09-04T05:56:00.000Z	BarkingFish	tardis	according to alis, it is
2011-09-04T05:57:00.000Z	BarkingFish		##mint                                               2 :Welcome to the Linux Mint support channel. | Linux Mint site- http://www.linuxmint.com/ | New release: Linux Mint 10 RC - http://linuxmint.com/rel_julia_whatsnew.php
2011-09-04T05:57:00.000Z	tardis	BarkingFish	that isn't the Linux Mint support channel.
2011-09-04T05:57:00.000Z	tardis		even the name of it (two hashes) makes that obvious ;)
2011-09-04T05:58:00.000Z	BarkingFish		ok then, I can only go by what I see in the alis listings, if it's not official it should be shut
2011-09-04T05:58:00.000Z	tardis	BarkingFish	that's not what freenode policy says :)
