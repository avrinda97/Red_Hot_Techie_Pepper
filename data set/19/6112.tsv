2008-03-13T02:38:00.000Z	macogw	artenius	conky will show it on the desktop
2008-03-13T02:39:00.000Z	artenius	macogw	I like conky but I was hoping there might be a nicer looking one, to compliment compiz
2008-03-13T02:39:00.000Z	macogw	artenius	gkrellm's not so nice looking. do you like widgets?
2008-03-13T02:40:00.000Z	artenius	macogw	I don't honestly know what widgets are yet
2008-03-13T02:40:00.000Z	macogw	artenius	ok well try installing screenlets
2008-03-13T02:40:00.000Z	macogw	artenius	what version of ubuntu are you using?

2008-03-13T02:41:00.000Z	macogw	artenius	it requires that you have compiz going though

2008-03-13T02:42:00.000Z	artenius	macogw	yeah, should I use that link or just install via synaptic?
2008-03-13T02:42:00.000Z	artenius	macogw	yes I'm using compiz
2008-03-13T02:42:00.000Z	macogw	artenius	that one's more up to date / fixed
