2008-08-07T03:45:00.000Z	RadiCaL		On Windows there is an indexing service to speed up searches, I usually disable it to save memory etc. Is there such a thing in Ubuntu?
2008-08-07T03:45:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	Tracker
2008-08-07T03:46:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	where would I go about disabling it, assuming there is benefit in doing so. For that matter where do I disable any services?
2008-08-07T03:46:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	Easiest is to just apt-get remove tracker
2008-08-07T03:46:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	is there a way to see all the services running on my computer?
2008-08-07T03:47:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	and does it improve performance like it does on windows? Or should i just leave it?
2008-08-07T03:49:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	sudo services-admin. There's some performance to be gained by disabling at least tracker and stuff like bluetooth if you dont need it... But other than that you shouldnt need to worry
2008-08-07T03:51:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	ok, i'll check em out, thanks.
2008-08-07T03:51:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	got an error. ** (services-admin:17812): CRITICAL **: Unable to lookup session information for process '17812'
2008-08-07T03:51:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	I am assume that isnt something to worry about?
2008-08-07T03:52:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	Nah, as long as it opens properly...
2008-08-07T03:52:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	well, everything is greyed out and I cant uncheck anything. also, this will effect what it loads at boot too right? not just this session.
2008-08-07T03:53:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	Launch it without sudo and click unlock. That should work. It's only for systemboot stuff, user-related things are under system -> settings -> sessions
2008-08-07T03:54:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	are there any notable services that should be disabled for a quicker boot?
2008-08-07T03:56:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	is there somewhere i can get a description of what each service is for?
2008-08-07T03:57:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	The wiki, forums, or google ;) But other than tracker there's nothing you should need disable really... You wont notice any real differences as they are daemons
2008-08-07T03:59:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	alright, i've disabled the ones I dont need, like printing & bluetooth along with tracker. My system boots in about a minute, but the hardware is very new. Is there something else I can do to cut it down?
2008-08-07T04:02:00.000Z	hateball	RadiCaL	Not much to do that I know of, maybe some hdparm tweaking... Or get a hobby and practice that during the minute you wait ;)
2008-08-07T04:04:00.000Z	RadiCaL	hateball	guess I'll have to find a quick hobby :P thanks for the help :)
