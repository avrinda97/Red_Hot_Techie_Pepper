2006-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	admin > pref > session > startup progs
2006-02-21T11:04:00.000Z	NCLife	farous	my azureus is just an executable, i must run it at a terminal every time
2006-02-21T11:05:00.000Z	NCLife	farous	is there a way to get azureus as a normal programm?
2006-02-21T11:06:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	what do you mean i can not quite understand
2006-02-21T11:07:00.000Z	NCLife	farous	i mean it is just a shell script that i have to load on a terminal to run it.. i dont have it on the programms menu
2006-02-21T11:07:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	any program that you run is an executable that you can run in a terminal. unluss you need special env. var for azures
2006-02-21T11:08:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	it will work fine Admin>pref>session>startup
2006-02-21T11:08:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	just give it the right path
2006-02-21T11:08:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	where do you run azurus from which dir
2006-02-21T11:09:00.000Z	NCLife	farous	from ~/programms/azureus$

2006-02-21T11:10:00.000Z	farous	NCLife	sorry ment you can also execute it as ~/programms/azuresus/azureus
