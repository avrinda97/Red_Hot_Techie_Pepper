2007-04-19T16:04:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- which card is it?

2007-04-19T16:05:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- You don't know if it's working or you don't know what type of card it is?  You gotta be joking?!
2007-04-19T16:05:00.000Z	Treedude		i dont know what type it is
2007-04-19T16:06:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- what did the box say it was?
2007-04-19T16:06:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- what does the ifconfig bring back (as well as the lspci command)?
2007-04-19T16:06:00.000Z	Treedude	hayesben	i bought it 2 years ago, i cant remember what it said on the box and the card has no writing on it at all
2007-04-19T16:10:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- if you run the lspci command, can you see your wireless card listed?
2007-04-19T16:10:00.000Z	Treedude		how do i run that?
2007-04-19T16:10:00.000Z	Treedude		ty
2007-04-19T16:10:00.000Z	hayesben		open up a terminal console (Applications -> Terminal) and type in lspci
2007-04-19T16:13:00.000Z	Treedude	hayesben	there's a cardbus controller, that what im looking for?
2007-04-19T16:13:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- if your wireless card is working, you should be able to run ifconfig and see if it's acquiring an ip address.  If ubuntu isn't loading it up, you will need to get the vendor codes for the hardware and do a search.  Once you find the hardware, you can download the windows drivers and install ndiswrapper and install the drivers that way to get it working.
2007-04-19T16:14:00.000Z	hayesben		liz - yeah, i forgot about the iwconfig command.
2007-04-19T16:14:00.000Z	Treedude		ok, ty all, ill get on that
2007-04-19T16:15:00.000Z	Treedude		i may be back :P
2007-04-19T16:18:00.000Z	hayesben	Treedude	- Two more areas to look at.  If you go to System -> Device Manager & System -> Networking, you should be able to visually see if the card is loaded properly.  The Device Manager will give you more info about the card in question to help you in your search.
