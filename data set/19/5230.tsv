2009-06-29T05:24:00.000Z	ryanprior		We're introducing ARM support, IIRC.
2009-06-29T05:25:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	o.0, really?
2009-06-29T05:25:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	yes, announced in November 2008
2009-06-29T05:25:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	http://www.ubuntu.com/news/arm-linux
2009-06-29T05:31:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	full-screen support?
2009-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	The virtual machine has full-screen support, don't know whether it's implemented in ActionScript yet or not.
2009-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	the virtual machine?
2009-06-29T05:33:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	Gnash is a general virtual runtime engine, with a Flash compatibility layer.
2009-06-29T05:37:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	most likely, no. but different versions of some apps might not like their configuration files. evolution and pidign come to mind, especially
2009-06-29T05:38:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	I use webmail and Empathy. Am I in the clear?
2009-06-29T05:38:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	hopefully :P
2009-06-29T05:38:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	i think it'd be better to run 8.04 and just put 9.04 in a VM
2009-06-29T05:39:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	I'd do that if this weren't my memory-anemic laptop with an old Celeron processor with no virtualization support.
2009-06-29T05:39:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	oh. you could consider installing the drivers for 9.04 yourself, then
2009-06-29T05:57:00.000Z	raylu	ryanprior	fine for me. http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/sourceforge.net
2009-06-29T05:57:00.000Z	ryanprior	raylu	great website, will bookmark that one. Will you download http://downloads.sourceforge.net/lubi/lubi_7.04.04_all.deb and mirror it for me?
