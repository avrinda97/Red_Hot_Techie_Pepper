2008-10-19T10:36:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	what's your video card?
2008-10-19T10:37:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	ah... and you are using the foss nv driver? or the closed-source nvidia?
2008-10-19T10:38:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	tried the nv driver?
2008-10-19T10:39:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	so why not use the opensource driver?
2008-10-19T10:42:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	heh
2008-10-19T10:42:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	yea :)
2008-10-19T10:43:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	yea, that's why the oss driver lacks some features... but it should be perfectly fine for regular 2-d stuff.
2008-10-19T10:45:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	heh, pretty fragile, if a videodriver can get you so. :)
2008-10-19T10:46:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Mikenolike	or you could just use the default nv driver. heh. why exactly were you unhappy with it in the first place?
