2007-05-01T12:24:00.000Z	MukiEX	naoise	: Linux? HP printer?
2007-05-01T12:24:00.000Z	MukiEX	naoise	: What kind of files are they?
2007-05-01T12:24:00.000Z	MukiEX		Ah. =3
2007-05-01T12:24:00.000Z	naoise	MukiEX	rpm
2007-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	MukiEX		I literally timed Ubuntu's copying portion of the install. It was like literally, 18 minutes on my rig.
2007-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	MukiEX	naoise	: sudo apt-get install alien
2007-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	MukiEX		run xterm or gnome-terminal via the run box (alt+f2 default)
2007-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	naoise	MukiEX	k
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	MukiEX	naoise	: do you know your way around the terminal? (e.g. moving to the correct folder)
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	naoise	MukiEX	its on desktop
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	MukiEX		because eventually you wanna run alien on that RPM file.
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	MukiEX		alien ~/Desktop/(driver name).rpm
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	MukiEX	naoise	: What kind of printer do you have?
2007-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	naoise	MukiEX	canon ip6600d

2007-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	MukiEX		it doesn't auto-detect it, naoise? brb
2007-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	naoise	MukiEX	it does, but it doesn't have the proper model number
