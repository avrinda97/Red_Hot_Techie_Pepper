2012-02-16T04:06:00.000Z	Woodie8Potatoes		hello there, i'm trying to install some software from the installation cdrom, but the thing just doesn't work, i've ran "apt-cdrom add", it worked then i checked "/media/apt" and the cdrom is mounted, also it wrote the thing on /etc/apt/sources.list, but when i run apt-get it says "file not found".
