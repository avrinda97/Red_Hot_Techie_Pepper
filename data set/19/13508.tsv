2005-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	meff		hi all, i have a quick question i hope i can get help with.. i have a IT812x secondary pata controller, and i booted up the breezy cd and it does not find it.. i know this driver was in 2.6.13 -- if i install breezy, is there a 2.6.13 update available?
2005-10-19T09:23:00.000Z	meff		i'd really appreciate it if someone can tell me whether there is a 2.6.13 update available in breezy...
2005-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	There is not. 2.6.12-9 is teh latest.
2005-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	how would i get my IT812x controller to work then? do i have to wait till the next release?
2005-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	Does 2.6.12 not support it *at all* ?
2005-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	correct. driver was merged into kernel on 2.6.13
2005-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	Then I'm afraid you'll need a custom compiled kernel.
2005-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	this i can do. does ubuntu provide patchsets and configs that i could use against 2.6.13 by any chance?
2005-10-19T09:28:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	and if not, does kernel-package work in ubuntu like in debian?
2005-10-19T09:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	I think they don't; they DO provide a patch set for an already-ubuntu kernel, but that won't necessarily work on a vanilla kernel. make-kpkg works fine, though.
2005-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	great. does ubuntu use any special kernel features that would not be in vanilla then?
2005-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	Yep. The main one is breezy is usplash (bootup progress bar)
2005-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	so i guess building off vanilla 2.6.13 would require some patching eh.. hmph..
2005-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	I'm not sure how extensively the kernel is patched for restricted-modules (nvidia, ati etc) support.
2005-10-19T09:30:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	true. crap.. i guess i'll have to wait till a 2.6.13 comes out on breezy -- or.. will one ever? ..
2005-10-19T09:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	If their update policy is the same as debian, then no.
2005-10-19T09:32:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	Mind you, that does _not_ mean you wouldn't be able to run the 2.6.13 kernel from Dapper Drake ;-)
2005-10-19T09:36:00.000Z	cafuego_	meff	Is the it* the only controller the mobo has?
2005-10-19T09:36:00.000Z	meff	cafuego_	no but my ICH7 pata is full and i have disks on the ITE chipset.
