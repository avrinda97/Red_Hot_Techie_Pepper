2009-11-03T05:28:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	nothing...
2009-11-03T05:28:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	lsof  | grep config.dat shows nothing
2009-11-03T05:29:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	still won't run?
2009-11-03T05:30:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	have you checked the permissions on the file?
2009-11-03T05:30:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	nope, still won't run.. Im executing this with root so I suppose permissions shouldnt be a problem
2009-11-03T05:35:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	here's a thought - you sure the partition it's looking in is mounted rw?
2009-11-03T05:36:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	yes, checked it with touch
2009-11-03T05:36:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	touch updated the modified time?
2009-11-03T05:37:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	no, Just did touch /var/cache/debconf/test
2009-11-03T05:37:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	perhaps the config script su's to the application's user or something and it doesn't have rw access on the file...
2009-11-03T05:37:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	see if you can sudo touch -a the file to update the modified time
2009-11-03T05:37:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	no... I've had this before, I think.. and there was a way to force it..
2009-11-03T05:40:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	got the solution.. top showed me a process "whiptail" taking 99% CPU... A kill on that process fixed all
2009-11-03T05:41:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	well ok, haha
2009-11-03T05:42:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink	mgmuscari	whiptail is the TUI interface where it was waiting for user input when the SSH connection broke..
2009-11-03T05:42:00.000Z	mgmuscari	sven_oostenbrink	ah...
