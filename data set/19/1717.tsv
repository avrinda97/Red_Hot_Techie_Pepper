2011-04-29T00:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	it's unuseable right now, how so?
2011-04-29T00:06:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	??  I think you got the wrong guy! :)  How's it going though!
2011-04-29T00:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	also if you find Unity unusable or whatever, give Gnoem Shell a try ;)  the new interface for Gnome 3 the default proper one :)
2011-04-29T00:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	oh yeah I did
2011-04-29T00:06:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	I have already previewed unity and already plan on sticking with gnome though. :)
2011-04-29T00:08:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	is gnome shell the same as gnome desktop?
2011-04-29T00:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	Gnome Shell is the new interface for Gnome 3 :)  http://gnome3.org
2011-04-29T00:09:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	ahh, ok
2011-04-29T00:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	Unity is currenlty on top of Gnome 2 in 11.04, but will be on top of Gnome 3 for 11.10  whilst being used instead of Gnome Shell by default.  and with 11.10 people should be able to install the uhmm 100% proper Gnome 3 expereince from the repo's no problem.  where as with 11.04 Gnome 3 is an optional ppa, which lacks a few things
2011-04-29T00:11:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	right I was playing with gnome3 a little in my little spare time, but didn't get far, thanks for the info.
2011-04-29T08:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	ok
2011-04-29T08:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	ok by the looks of it, that's for Ubuntu Classic Desktop not Unity
2011-04-29T08:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	and it does say how to install using the ppa's
2011-04-29T08:20:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	but it seems to indicate that those come with 11.04, and reading the article I thought it was unity.
2011-04-29T08:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	also really what they are telling you, that you can install, is a load of junk
2011-04-29T08:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	^
2011-04-29T08:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	shane4ubuntu	there's loads of junk you can add to Ubuntu, and that site useually tells people about it
2011-04-29T08:22:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	sebsebseb	it is for unity the first paragraph explains the doing away with the Application Panel indicators, and the new entry of indicators.
