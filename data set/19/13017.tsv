2005-08-01T14:09:00.000Z	apollo2011		is there a way in Gnome to put the system in standby or suspend to safely un-dock the laptop from a base station? Last time I tried doing it worked with the machine wide awake but then one time I corrupted the fs and had to reinstall.

2005-08-01T14:12:00.000Z	Xyc0		bah ha ha ha ha
2005-08-01T14:12:00.000Z	apollo2011	Xyc0	no...I assume being able to go into standby in Windows has nothing to do with this?  Would it be in the Log Out menu if it was supported?
2005-08-01T14:12:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	If you Log Out, it should give you some options, one of those being Suspend if your hardware supports it.

2005-08-01T14:13:00.000Z	apollo2011	Xyc0	ok, so i guess mine doesn't support it then...
2005-08-01T14:13:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	What kind of laptop?
2005-08-01T14:13:00.000Z	apollo2011	Xyc0	 Dell Inspiron 8600
2005-08-01T14:15:00.000Z	apollo2011	Xyc0	 I guess that Dell Supsend Fix article should help me...lol
2005-08-01T14:15:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	Read a bit more into it tho, I tried the same thing on my Dell 5150 and it cause my memory to bug out every 10 minutes
2005-08-01T14:16:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	there is a link on that page that gives you details on your specific make of laptop
2005-08-01T14:16:00.000Z	apollo2011	Xyc0	no actually that article is about closing the lid...that works finee on mine...but I will definitely look into those links..thx
2005-08-01T14:17:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	do you know how to work with bash commands?
2005-08-01T14:17:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	cause I ended up editing grub/menu.lst in bash tog et my laptop back to normal
2005-08-01T14:17:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	I just dont want to leave you hanging
2005-08-01T14:18:00.000Z	Xyc0		!suspend
2005-08-01T14:22:00.000Z	apollo2011	Xyc0	Looks like to suspend, you just have to close the monitor, then you can safely undock from the base.
2005-08-01T14:22:00.000Z	Xyc0	apollo2011	sounds good
