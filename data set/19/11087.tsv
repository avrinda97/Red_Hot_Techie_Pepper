2008-08-10T03:52:00.000Z	johnny__	Smegzor	Im sure it requires specifically 644 permissions then
2008-08-10T03:52:00.000Z	Smegzor		i'll log out and back again now that i've chmodded it to 644
2008-08-10T03:52:00.000Z	Smegzor		brb
2008-08-10T03:52:00.000Z	johnny__		!sudo | PineHead
2008-08-10T03:53:00.000Z	Smegzor	johnny__	no difference :(
2008-08-10T03:53:00.000Z	Smegzor		i'll switch to another user and see if its doing that for everyone..
2008-08-10T03:53:00.000Z	johnny__	Smegzor	try to create a new user, see if the new user has the same problem.
2008-08-10T04:00:00.000Z	Smegzor	johnny__	Its definitely only giving me that error.  It started right after I tried making one of my wine prefixes accessible to all users.  I copied it to a fake user (I just made a directory in home) and this started after I tried running that wine.
2008-08-10T04:03:00.000Z	johnny__	Smegzor	the funny thing about that, is that I was having the same problem, I am drawing a blank as to how i fixed it.
2008-08-10T04:03:00.000Z	johnny__	Smegzor	I believe the way I fixed it was just reinstall ubuntu though :(
2008-08-10T04:04:00.000Z	Smegzor	johnny__	I'm going to do that in October.  Thats how I upgrade Ubuntu.
2008-08-10T04:05:00.000Z	Smegzor		this isn't a show stopper, just annoying.
2008-08-10T04:05:00.000Z	johnny__	Smegzor	I know.
2008-08-10T04:05:00.000Z	johnny__	Smegzor	Im sorry I can't help any more
