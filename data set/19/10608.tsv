2007-04-26T14:40:00.000Z	mag_	Pelo	LOL. No, the BIOS (or something) protects the boot sequence, so that GRUB cannot launch
2007-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	Pelo	mag_	 check in the bios for security,  there might be something in ther for  mbr protection or some such
2007-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	mag_	Pelo	Damn !  I should disconnect, then ?
2007-04-26T14:42:00.000Z	mag_	Pelo	OK. I'll check . My BIOS is Phoenix, on a Packard Bell Easynote laptop BTW
2007-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	Pelo	mag_	 that means nothing to me , sorry, I can'T walk you trhough it ,  check your manual if you ahve one
2007-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	mag_	Pelo	: OK. I'll try. Thanks !!!
2007-04-26T15:03:00.000Z	mag_	Pelo	You were Right. There was a MBR protection in the BIOS. However, I still can't boot. Would sudo update-grub solve the problem and rebuild a correct bootstrap ?
2007-04-26T15:04:00.000Z	Pelo	mag_	 possibly, I realy donT' knwo I've never had that problem
2007-05-14T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	mag_	 someone made a distro based on ubuntu with a load for multimedia apps in the default install

2007-09-05T05:40:00.000Z	Pelo	mag_	 install gparted,  repartition it and then you can mount it
