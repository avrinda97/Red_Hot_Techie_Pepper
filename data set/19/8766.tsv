2007-02-11T13:47:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	when typing this:  sudo dpkg -i kernel-image-2.6.17-11.deb
2007-02-11T13:47:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	try to tab-complete : sudo dpkg -i linux<tab>
2007-02-11T13:47:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	ok, i try and back soon
2007-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	Maybe i did confusion, what dir am i supposed to do the command?
2007-02-11T13:49:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	hmm actually, I think this was not the right thing or you
2007-02-11T13:50:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	why do you think you need a custom kernel ?
2007-02-11T13:52:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	I followed step by step all the istructions in the tutorial, but, as a newbie user, i moved between dirs whesn something went wrong... I just need to be put back in the right way :-)  please help me
2007-02-11T13:53:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	tried not bothering users with dummy questions, but now i need help
2007-02-11T13:53:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	I can't really help you with it, I always build my kernels with source from kernel.org, not with the Ubuntu packages
2007-02-11T13:54:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	ok... could be simply a wrong dir error, can you suggest me from which one I can type the command?
2007-02-11T13:54:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	maybe /usr/src/linux ?
2007-02-11T13:55:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	are you getting my PMs ?
2007-02-11T14:04:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	maybe i need to register my nick ...
2007-02-11T14:05:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	that's what I told you
2007-02-11T14:06:00.000Z	midmood	HymnToLife	don't you read my responses?
2007-02-11T14:08:00.000Z	HymnToLife	midmood	no, you'll need to be registered to send PMs
