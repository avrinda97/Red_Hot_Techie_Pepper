2008-03-11T07:38:00.000Z	TaRDy		is amorok supposed to be difficult to use?
2008-03-11T07:39:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	no
2008-03-11T07:43:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	i guess i was just missing mp3 support, now I think it sees most of my music
2008-03-11T07:43:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed? where are you trying to import music from?
2008-03-11T07:46:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	thank you for the restricted-extras pointer, and in case you missed my last message I basically copied my old XP "my music" folder to ~/Music
2008-03-11T07:48:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	it said it was building the db, it just didn't look at the mp3s since it did not support it, however it is working now, thank you
2008-03-11T08:14:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	windows
2008-03-12T05:12:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	watching only or watching and recording like a Tivo
2008-03-12T05:13:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	if the better client is just watching then i dont mind not recording
2008-03-12T05:13:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	not sure about just watching--I tend to use the net for just watching
2008-03-28T05:19:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	what package
2008-05-13T10:01:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	devilsadvocate thanks I will try it out then
2008-05-13T09:57:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	not likely
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	thanks, I am considering seeing if a triple boot could occure
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	with solaris?
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	correct, ubuntu 8.04, opensolaris 2008.05 and vista
2008-05-13T09:59:00.000Z	TaRDy	bazhang	if triple booting even is possible
2008-05-13T09:59:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	grub might do it; not sure if you could mount zfs though
2008-05-13T09:59:00.000Z	bazhang	TaRDy	sure it is possible to triple or even higher boot (someone had a hundred)
