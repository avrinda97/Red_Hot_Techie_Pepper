2011-08-02T11:23:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	are you sure you didn't upgrade to 11.10 (oneiric)? i think gnome classic is already removed from it
2011-08-02T11:24:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	ok just checking.. weird
2011-08-02T11:38:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	I'm not expert about those kind of things but everything seems to be ok (i think), except that ubuntu-desktop package is not installed (and apparently cannot be installed due to broken dependancies)
2011-08-02T11:49:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	I don't know. I suppose this is the channel. You can also try ##club-ubuntu, there seems to be very competent people :)
2011-08-02T11:39:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	No, i don't think so
2011-08-02T11:40:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	have you tried 'sudo apt-get install -f' to fix dependencies?
2011-08-02T11:42:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	What is it going to remove when you do it?
2011-08-02T11:47:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	I'm sorry I can't help you :( I hope here are someone who can.
2011-08-02T11:48:00.000Z	kamidi	Hittwice	And be patient ;-)
