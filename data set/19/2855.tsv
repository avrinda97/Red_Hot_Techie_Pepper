2009-12-26T12:15:00.000Z	mota_		quick question how do I extract with wine ? does anyone know ?
2009-12-26T12:16:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	extract with wine? you mean use a windows archive program on a compressed file ?
2009-12-26T12:16:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	you don't need wine for that
2009-12-26T12:17:00.000Z	mota_	airtonix	this is telling me I do need it
2009-12-26T12:17:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	assuming you are using ubuntu and gnome, you right click on the zip file and select extract here

2009-12-26T12:18:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	if the exe is just a self extracting archive you can just use the mthod i mentioned
2009-12-26T12:19:00.000Z	mota_	airtonix	how come it wont work ? im sorry this is my first day on ubuntu :/
2009-12-26T12:25:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	 you dont.
2009-12-26T12:27:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	so you unpacked the exe file you got from the linksys website... step one of the page you linked before...follow the rest of the page
2009-12-26T12:28:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	it might also be helpful if you gave us the exact url of the page where you downloaded the driver from
2009-12-26T12:29:00.000Z	mota_	airtonix	ok
2009-12-26T12:29:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	also in google i typed : "ubuntu karmic WMP54GS" and got : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1342611
2009-12-26T12:29:00.000Z	mota_	airtonix	et al. this is the website : http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support/WPSM54G/download
2009-12-26T12:30:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	you downloaded the 57mb file ?
2009-12-26T12:31:00.000Z	mota_	airtonix	no i downloaded the 318kb file
2009-12-26T12:31:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	the firmware file which i assume is intended to be flashed onto the device and not used as a driver in the operating system of your computer
2009-12-26T12:32:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	see comment above by DaZ
2009-12-26T12:32:00.000Z	airtonix	mota_	i doubt you downloaded a OS driver to be honest
