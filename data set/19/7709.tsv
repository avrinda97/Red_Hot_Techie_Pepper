2008-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	Invert314		how do i unmount all drives i previously mounted?
2008-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	umount -a
2008-04-24T09:06:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	i already tried umount -a...the srives are still mounted
2008-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	which partition you want to umount
2008-04-24T09:08:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	/dev/sda3, sda2, sda5 mounted to /ubuntu, /ubuntu2, /ubuntu5 respectively (i think)
2008-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	how can i tell which drives are mounted to which directory?
2008-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	just type mount
2008-04-24T09:22:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	lol

2008-04-24T09:13:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	how do i mount sda6 to /ubuntu6?
2008-04-24T09:14:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	lsof | grep Ubuntu6
2008-04-24T09:15:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	you can see in /etc/mtab
2008-04-24T09:15:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	ubuntu@ubuntu:/$ lsof | grep Ubuntu6
2008-04-24T09:17:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	there are no traces of /ubuntu6 in my mtab file
2008-04-24T09:20:00.000Z	suprie	Invert314	have you tried without -t options
2008-04-24T09:21:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	i'll try that now
2008-04-24T09:22:00.000Z	Invert314	suprie	without -t options, the prompt says that sda looks like swap space lolol
