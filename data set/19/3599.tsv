2009-07-14T19:42:00.000Z	codyxx		I just got a read/write error when attempting to resize my ext3 partition in Gparted
2009-07-14T19:42:00.000Z	codyxx		What can I do?
2009-07-14T19:42:00.000Z	codyxx		(How could I also change the mount permissions on my drive?)
2009-07-14T19:43:00.000Z	codyxx		I saw the command before, but I dorgot it.

2009-07-14T19:43:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	uh oh
2009-07-14T19:43:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	could be real bad
2009-07-14T19:44:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	are you still in gparted?
2009-07-14T19:44:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	you need to fsck everything
2009-07-14T19:46:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	are you sure? You don't know until you fsck
2009-07-14T19:47:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	after you got the read/write error?
2009-07-14T19:48:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	okay, good
2009-07-14T19:49:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	unmount and then remount
2009-07-14T19:51:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	I'm not sure I understand what you're asking
2009-07-14T19:52:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	You want to remount a hard disk partition from a liveCD?
2009-07-14T19:53:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	the read/write error didn't come from permissions
2009-07-14T19:56:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	I think your hardware came up with an error
2009-07-14T19:56:00.000Z	richardcavell	codyxx	that's the kind of error that could signal your disk is about to break
