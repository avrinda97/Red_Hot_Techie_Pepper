2008-10-04T02:32:00.000Z	PhotonSCX		How do I partition a 10GB partition into 9+1?
2008-10-04T02:32:00.000Z	PhotonSCX		so I have 1GB swap
2008-10-04T02:34:00.000Z	PhotonSCX		help please. See above. :(
2008-10-04T02:35:00.000Z	PhotonSCX		after choosing the 10GB partition it complains it needs one more partition for the swap, which I don't have. How do I split up the 10?
2008-10-04T02:36:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	how much ram?
2008-10-04T02:36:00.000Z	PhotonSCX	ompaul	2GB
2008-10-04T02:37:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	in theory you should be double your ram - however with such a tight mean amount of space I would say 512Mb
2008-10-04T02:38:00.000Z	PhotonSCX	ompaul	if 10GB swap is good, and resize of this existing Vista partition is reliable, I am willing to give Ubuntu 30-40GB of this Vista partition with the resize tool, and specify the 10GB as swap on the LiveCD
2008-10-04T02:39:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	do you want help with a straight install or a dual boot?
2008-10-04T02:40:00.000Z	PhotonSCX	ompaul	I am typing from a laptop with Vista. Vista partition is 150GB. I just formatted D: which is 10GB
2008-10-04T02:40:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	so then you let the guided install automatically work out the swap it won't killyou
2008-10-04T02:42:00.000Z	PhotonSCX	ompaul	right-o, will do.
2008-10-04T02:43:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	do an automatic install, then you will see how it works and you can tweek it soon
2008-10-04T02:45:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	the live cd has it all there - just do it
2008-10-04T02:46:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	the install tool does it - your call if you want to use it or not
2008-10-04T02:47:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	so you don't know what you are doing, let it do itself
2008-10-04T02:49:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	ehh not what i suggested read your logs
2008-10-04T02:49:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	what I am saying to you, and this is the last time I will say it, is point it at that partition and let it go automatically
2008-10-04T02:50:00.000Z	ompaul	PhotonSCX	there is a click once and it works install tool when it boots up
