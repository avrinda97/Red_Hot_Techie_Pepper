2007-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	thanks i'll look at that first
2007-02-21T07:41:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	y0hm, it appears tracepath hangs like any other command, i'll paste here when it's done.
2007-02-21T07:41:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	Better to pastebin it if there are many lines
2007-02-21T07:43:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	When you put the command you used something like:   sudo tracepath some.url.here      ? (or ip)
2007-02-21T07:44:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	yes apart from sudo
2007-02-21T07:44:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	using an ip address
2007-02-21T07:45:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	OK. Very odd. Does ping manage to reach it??
2007-02-21T07:46:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	that was from the remote host to my desktop here. pinging from here to remote no pong..
2007-02-21T07:47:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	Looks to me at first glance then to be some kind of routing or dns issue
2007-02-21T07:48:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	i should probably mention the server is behind a router that forwards the ports 22 and 80 to the server which has static ip address... this could be a bad approach but it used to work.
2007-02-21T07:49:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	IdleOne i tried to ping the router (the server has only local ip)
2007-02-21T07:49:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	I use the same setup here and it works fine
2007-02-21T07:50:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	-^
2007-02-21T07:52:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	Yes, it would help if the router had icmp enabled (ping reply)
2007-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	Another thing which is sometimes a problem is that some "hackers" try to brute-force attack on known ports, so the box could just be overloaded with this at times. You should change the port that sshd runs on to something oddball and then forward that port instead
2007-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	thanks for the advice. so in any case it's the router settings that need to be altered?
2007-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	genii	battlesquid	Well, it is good to be able to turn it on and off for diagnostic purposes for instance. you may want to consider turning on the remote admin features of the router so you can access it over the internet. But I recommend again to put it on some oddball port number
2007-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	battlesquid	genii	bauer77 noted, thank you
