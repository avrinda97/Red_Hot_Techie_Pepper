2007-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	HannaH1		tnx hmhowie
2007-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	HannaH1		what is the last version for firefox?
2007-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	look at what ubotu said
2007-09-25T14:27:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	xchat or kvirc for beginners, irssi for adavanced users
2007-09-25T14:28:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	but it's all personal preference anyway
2007-09-25T14:29:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	be sure to pick xchat, not xchat-gnome
2007-09-25T14:29:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	then you probably have xchat-gnome (which is crippled somehow)
2007-09-25T14:30:00.000Z	HannaH1	rausb0	what is the command for see this?
2007-09-25T14:30:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	dpkg -l | grep xchat
2007-09-25T14:31:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	hmm, not the gnome version. and you have no userlist on the right side?
2007-09-25T14:32:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	hmm. i don't have xchat here, so i cannot help you with that
2007-09-25T14:32:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	alright then :)
2007-09-25T14:34:00.000Z	HannaH1	rausb0	my Meneger Packeges found firefox 2.0.0.1 :((
2007-09-25T14:34:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	which version of ubuntu do you have?
2007-09-25T14:35:00.000Z	rausb0	HannaH1	please post your /etc/apt/sources.list on phpfi.com
2007-09-25T14:36:00.000Z	HannaH1	rausb0	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38528/
