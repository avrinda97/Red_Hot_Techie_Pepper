2012-02-29T18:41:00.000Z	allu2		Hello, can someone try to swich desktop in unity using ctrl+alt+up+left while on the down right desktop? does it work?
2012-02-29T18:42:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	it works for me, although I must ask which version of unity are you running?
2012-02-29T18:42:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	um the one with oneiric(?) i can't move that way, all other directions work but not that one :S
2012-02-29T18:43:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	i can move first to left and then up, or first up and then left but not change directly by pressing both same time
2012-02-29T18:43:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	this works tough from left up to down right
2012-02-29T18:43:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	hmm that's wierd. I also have that problem...
2012-02-29T18:44:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	:S bug?
2012-02-29T18:44:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	if I press up + left not simultaneously but quickly in succession then it works
2012-02-29T18:44:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	yeah a bug I guess...and I am running Precise
2012-02-29T18:44:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	i wonder if this has been reported
2012-02-29T18:45:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	or maybe i'm only one paying attension to such minor things ^^
2012-02-29T18:45:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	nice catch though :)...we want a pixel perfect precise!
2012-02-29T18:45:00.000Z	allu2		:D
2012-02-29T18:45:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	can you report a bug and provide the bug report link?
2012-02-29T18:45:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	I'll mark it confirmed
2012-02-29T18:46:00.000Z	allu2	krnekhelesh	ok, time to try ubuntu-bug for first time :P
2012-02-29T18:46:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	try ubuntu-bug compiz
2012-02-29T18:46:00.000Z	krnekhelesh	allu2	since it is related to compiz package
