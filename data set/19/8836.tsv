2009-09-08T17:09:00.000Z	xrfang		another quesiont, I removed a lot of packages from a ubuntu installation, as I intend to use it as server. Now it has problems: when I insert a usb hard disk,  the disk appears in nautilus, but is NOT mounted, and I cannot mount it in nautius (no folder appear under /media)
2009-09-08T17:09:00.000Z	xrfang		what package do I need to let ubuntu automatically mount external disks?
2009-09-08T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	xrfang	should happen by default
2009-09-08T17:10:00.000Z	xrfang		yes it should
2009-09-08T17:10:00.000Z	xrfang		but now it didn't
2009-09-08T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	xrfang	what version of ubuntu?
2009-09-08T17:10:00.000Z	xrfang		I don't think I need to modify fstab
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	xrfang		it is 9.04
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	jrib	xrfang	ubuntu desktop?
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	xrfang		no I didn't I just removed a *LOT* of packages
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	xrfang		ubutu desktop
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	jrib		:/
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	xrfang		desktop is still there I can use vnc to login
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	jrib	xrfang	you removed a lot of packages /on purpose/?
2009-09-08T17:11:00.000Z	xrfang		yes on purpose
2009-09-08T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	xrfang	why?  Just randomly?
2009-09-08T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	xrfang	are you still running gnome?  I'm pretty sure gnome-volume-manager is responsible
2009-09-08T17:13:00.000Z	xrfang		e.g. mono, open office, alsa, bluz etc
2009-09-08T17:14:00.000Z	xrfang	jrib	I will verify if the volume manager is still there or not. It's in office. thanks!
