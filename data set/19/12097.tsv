2005-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	primoturbo		ctrl + alt + backspace doesn't restart x for me
2005-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	primoturbo		when I press it I see a login, text-based
2005-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	primoturbo		then I logged in
2005-11-30T11:48:00.000Z	primoturbo		nope
2005-11-30T11:49:00.000Z	primoturbo		i typed gdm
2005-11-30T11:49:00.000Z	primoturbo		and it said it's already running it
2005-11-30T11:49:00.000Z	primoturbo		I tried alt f7
2005-11-30T11:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 start gdm is the command not just gdm
2005-11-30T11:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 at the black screen you will see login type startx or type start gdm
2005-11-30T11:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 if you are on a black screen than X has shut down
2005-11-30T11:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 typing startx will start X again if it complains about permissions than sudo startx
2005-11-30T11:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 i enjoy it and its lighter than gnome or kde so it should run lil faster
2005-11-30T11:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	fluxbox,blackbox or any other box should be fastest due to no icons or nothing
2005-11-30T11:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 now i really have to ask what you mean by faster winxp has more lag to it than anything
2005-11-30T11:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 it is so is kde
2005-11-30T12:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 you did not state weather you were running doom or not all you said was i get 5 or 6 less in doom
2005-11-30T12:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	 try thinking about this if your xp desktop has no other running apps it could be pretty fast but when you start starting apps with winxp like say norton you will run at snails pace
2006-01-20T07:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	how much ram do you have?
2006-01-20T07:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	primoturbo	it should be faster than xp
