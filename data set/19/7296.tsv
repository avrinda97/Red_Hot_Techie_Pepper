2008-05-24T14:21:00.000Z	daftman		hi does anyone know how to simulate gnome events through the command?
2008-05-24T14:22:00.000Z	daftman		line
2008-05-24T14:22:00.000Z	daftman		e.g mute, volume up, shutdown etc?
2008-05-24T14:23:00.000Z	daftman		anyone know how to turn volume up through the command line?
2008-05-24T14:24:00.000Z	daftman		alsamixer just change the volume of the system through the back
2008-05-24T14:24:00.000Z	daftman		i have media keys that turn the volume up and down
2008-05-24T14:25:00.000Z	daftman		i want to find out how to do that through the command line
2008-05-24T14:25:00.000Z	daftman		sending the same keys
2008-05-24T14:25:00.000Z	daftman		i'm trying to set up my remote control to turn gnome volume up and down
2008-05-24T14:26:00.000Z	daftman		what does show key do?
2008-05-24T14:26:00.000Z	_2	daftman	admittedly the output is a bit cryptic at first   it 0x"hex number here"
2008-05-24T14:25:00.000Z	_2	daftman	ummm showkey  ?
2008-05-24T14:28:00.000Z	_2	daftman	a4 is the hexidecimal output of the key you pressed    so you can find the key code that the system sees.   you can use that info to either make a script for doing the same thing   or change the keymap to have that key do things...   the possiblities are many
2008-05-24T14:29:00.000Z	daftman	_2	I don't think you understand me right. right now say for example xf86audiomute is set to mute audio in gnome
2008-05-24T14:33:00.000Z	_2	daftman	if you don't want to use that key to do this.  only want a command to mute it.   asoundconf  can probably do that.    i just install aumix and use it.     aumix -v 0
2008-05-24T14:34:00.000Z	daftman	_2	yea i read about that, but I just want to see if there is anyway to send commands to the gnome desktop environment via a command line
2008-05-24T14:35:00.000Z	_2	daftman	then you need to be looking at metacity  and dbus ?
2008-05-24T14:37:00.000Z	_2	daftman	like i said look into metacity    i don't do gnome
2008-05-24T14:38:00.000Z	_2	daftman	and you were correct,  i did misread what you wanted.    being a console user i think a little differently than the avarage ubunteer
