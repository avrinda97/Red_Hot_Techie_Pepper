2011-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	but what is it you think you even need it for?

2011-10-15T13:12:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	and your PCM isn't at 100 or anything like that?
2011-10-15T13:12:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	okay, did you ever try specifying a model in alsa-base.conf ?
2011-10-15T13:14:00.000Z	SetiAmon	reisio	 How would i go about specifyinga model in alsa-base.conf?
2011-10-15T13:14:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	usually there're examples in comments in the file

2011-10-15T13:15:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto covers it some
2011-10-16T06:44:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	not without sentencing yourself to unsupported software
2011-10-16T06:45:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	on the other hand you can absolutely make GNOME 3 work just like GNOME 2
2011-10-16T06:50:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	it can if you use an updated kernel/driver, but I wouldn't bother
2011-10-16T06:50:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	backwards is backwards
2011-10-16T11:23:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	what'd you do?
2011-10-16T12:36:00.000Z	reisio	SetiAmon	a site
