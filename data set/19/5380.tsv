2011-02-25T10:45:00.000Z	joeoshawa		is it only mkv files that subtitles play by default
2011-02-25T10:45:00.000Z	joeoshawa		separate file
2011-02-25T10:46:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i can turn them off but they are on every time i start a video
2011-02-25T10:46:00.000Z	joeoshawa		i don't want the subtitles to play
2011-02-25T10:47:00.000Z	joeoshawa		all of them
2011-02-25T10:47:00.000Z	joeoshawa		but movie player is the one i am using
2011-02-25T10:47:00.000Z	joeoshawa		srt file
2011-02-25T10:48:00.000Z	joeoshawa		damn
2011-02-25T10:48:00.000Z	joeoshawa		ok
2011-02-25T10:48:00.000Z	joeoshawa		thought maybe there was a way i could make them off by default and turn them on if i want them
2011-02-25T10:49:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	there isn't a preferences option in any of the menus?
2011-02-25T10:52:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	in preferences, see the checkbox that says "Load subtitles file when movie is loaded"?
2011-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	well, I personally prefer smplayer, but that's me. vlc is pretty good too. I almost never touch movie player though
2011-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	indeed, that is pretty weird
2011-02-25T10:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	is this an mkv with built-in subs?
2011-02-25T10:55:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	try smplayer, if you have it, the options are much more vast, confusing, but precise ;)
2011-02-25T10:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	if you want to make it the default player, you just need to check the properties of any kind of movie file you want it to play and select smplayer under the opens with tab, then it will always open files of that type with smplayer
2011-02-25T10:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	hey, no big deal, I forget shtuff all the time
2011-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	joeoshawa	yeah, there are definitely some nice things about linux :D
