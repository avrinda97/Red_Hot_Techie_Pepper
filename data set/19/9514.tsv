2007-03-13T09:42:00.000Z	foutrelis	heydude	Did you install the nvidia driver from nvidia.com?

2007-03-13T09:44:00.000Z	foutrelis	heydude	First do: sudo apt-get remove nvidia-kernel-common

2007-03-13T09:47:00.000Z	foutrelis	heydude	Now sh NVIA*** --uninstall
2007-03-13T09:47:00.000Z	foutrelis	heydude	replace NVIA*** with the actual nvidia installer
2007-03-13T09:48:00.000Z	foutrelis	heydude	And to finish off, sh NVI** to install it again. Then reboot :)
