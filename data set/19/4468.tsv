2009-01-08T04:15:00.000Z	Quagmire		ok then ...I'm trying to find a program ...I moved it but do not remember where ...now I can;t find the folder. I have searched in Nautilus in the home folder, but it doesn;t show up
2009-01-08T04:16:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	try running 'locate programname'
2009-01-08T04:17:00.000Z	Quagmire	oCean__	where do I find that?
2009-01-08T04:17:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	you might have to run 'updatedb' first
2009-01-08T04:17:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	open a terminal and run command
2009-01-08T04:27:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	You might try de-installing from the add/remove option in the Applications menu
2009-01-08T04:18:00.000Z	Quagmire	oCean__	I got ...cannot open a temporary file for /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db
2009-01-08T04:19:00.000Z	Quagmire	oCean__	that is what I got when I ran updatedb
2009-01-08T04:19:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	right, you have to run "sudo updatedb"
2009-01-08T04:20:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	after that, as a user you can locate any file by using the 'localte' command
2009-01-08T04:21:00.000Z	Quagmire	oCean__	"locate program name" command
2009-01-08T04:22:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	what's the question?
2009-01-08T04:23:00.000Z	Quagmire	oCean__	I just want to make sure I had the info right ...I think you made a typo with locate earlier and wanted to be sure
2009-01-08T04:24:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	I might have :) After running the updatedb command, your localte command is: "/usr/bin/locate <string>"
2009-01-08T04:24:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	where <string> is (part of) your filename
2009-01-08T04:24:00.000Z	Quagmire	oCean__	now that I I have found everything that has anything to do with xchat ...how do I kill it all off ...I want to remove everything and start from scratch
2009-01-08T04:25:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	I'm not sure, you want to remove all of the xchat software?
2009-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	and that's bad because...
2009-01-08T04:31:00.000Z	oCean__	Quagmire	well, as raylu pointed out, your settings are in the .xchat directory in your homedirectory. Removing that directory (~/.xchat) might help you
