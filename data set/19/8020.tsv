2007-05-17T07:11:00.000Z	verme		hmmm my problem does not appear in the ubotu sound links, the sound is too low, anybody know how to solve it?
2007-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	verme		all fader at maximum
2007-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	stefg	verme	Mixer settings? Put the computer to suspend before?
2007-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	verme		no stefg
2007-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	verme		the nly fader of the volume control is the PCM, in other computer appear more faders
2007-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	stefg	verme	so double click on the volime icon and check if the pcm level is reasonably high
2007-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	verme		yes
2007-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	verme		it is at maximum stefg
2007-05-17T07:14:00.000Z	verme		there is not master fader, there is PCM fader only
2007-05-17T07:15:00.000Z	stefg	verme	ah... seems somehow the Master is set too low, and alsa is confused about your card. type 'alsamixer' in a terminal and see if you get more faders, including a master
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	verme	stefg	the problem is that alsamixer master does not have fader, it has mute only
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	verme		and it is unmuted
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	stefg	verme	what soundchip is it?
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	verme	stefg	i will find
