2006-10-29T17:24:00.000Z	NemesisD		anyone? can't get my USB network adapter working with ndiswrapper, im on my second day trying to get this thing going
2006-10-29T17:25:00.000Z	TGPO	NemesisD	the biggest problem people run into with ndiswrapper is using the wrong drivers even though they have the same name
2006-10-29T17:25:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	got the drivers from the d-link website and have both of them installed, both are detected
2006-10-29T17:26:00.000Z	TGPO	NemesisD	match up lspci with lspci -n and get the drivers from the ndiswrapper wiki. 99% of the time that clears up the problems
2006-10-29T17:27:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	okay let me try that
2006-10-29T17:27:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	its USB though
2006-10-29T17:28:00.000Z	TGPO		you'll be matching the lsusb -n (I think)
2006-10-29T17:29:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	lsusb doesn't seem to have the option for -n
2006-10-29T17:29:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	am i looking for vendor and product id?
2006-10-29T17:31:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	-d seems to show vendor and productid, is that what im supposed to be looking for in lsusb?
2006-10-29T17:31:00.000Z	TGPO	NemesisD	the xxxx:xxxx code for device ID
2006-10-29T17:32:00.000Z	NemesisD		ok i think thats -d lemme try it
2006-10-29T17:33:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	it appears to be 2001:3a03, does that sound about right?
2006-10-29T17:33:00.000Z	TGPO		that sounds right
2006-10-29T17:34:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	now which wiki was it that i was supposed to search this ID for?
2006-10-29T17:34:00.000Z	TGPO		ndiswrapper wiki
2006-10-29T17:35:00.000Z	TGPO	NemesisD	I'll see if I can get the link for the exact page
2006-10-29T17:37:00.000Z	TGPO	NemesisD	heres that link http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List
2006-10-29T17:37:00.000Z	NemesisD	TGPO	thanks!
