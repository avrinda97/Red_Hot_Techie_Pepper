2006-06-22T12:26:00.000Z	Jowi	r3nd3r0	don't think so. but pppoeconf should get the job done.

2006-06-22T12:26:00.000Z	r3nd3r0		didnt work
2006-06-22T12:26:00.000Z	r3nd3r0		my isp requires a user and pass

2006-06-22T12:26:00.000Z	r3nd3r0		i entered it into pppoeconf

2006-06-22T12:27:00.000Z	r3nd3r0		yeah im looking there
2006-06-22T12:27:00.000Z	r3nd3r0		but is that a binary ?
2006-06-22T12:27:00.000Z	r3nd3r0		that i can download
2006-06-22T12:29:00.000Z	Jowi	r3nd3r0	no idea. pppoeconf always worked for me (has set up that way for 3 people). do you get an ip address at all?
2006-06-22T12:29:00.000Z	r3nd3r0	Jowi	yup ive tried all those things in the wiki
2006-06-22T12:29:00.000Z	r3nd3r0	Jowi	no i dont think i get an ip
2006-06-22T12:30:00.000Z	Jowi	r3nd3r0	if you don't get an ip the authentication probably failed. I bet you've misstyped something in the setup.
