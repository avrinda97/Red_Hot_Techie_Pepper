2011-03-25T10:30:00.000Z	earthling_		I'm trying to boot up an ubuntu live USB on a 2001 compaq desktop, won't recognize it on bootup, says "non system disk or disk error"
2011-03-25T10:31:00.000Z	earthling_		how do I get it to recognize it?
2011-03-25T10:31:00.000Z	SwedeMike	earthling_	are you sure it's even able to boot off of usb and that error isn't from the built in harddrive?
2011-03-25T10:32:00.000Z	earthling_	SwedeMike	I'm not sure if it can, but I am able to change the boot order in bios to usb first
2011-03-25T10:32:00.000Z	earthling_	SwedeMike	and there is no hard drive in the machine
2011-03-25T10:33:00.000Z	SwedeMike	earthling_	and it works in another machine?
2011-03-25T10:33:00.000Z	earthling_		tried it long time ago
2011-03-25T10:33:00.000Z	earthling_		seemed to work iirc
2011-03-25T10:34:00.000Z	earthling_	SwedeMike	are some old computer unable to boot from USB?
2011-03-25T10:34:00.000Z	SwedeMike	earthling_	can't think of something that might cause it, the error message you get means there isn't a boot block on the USB stick.
2011-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	earthling_	SwedeMike	usb works on other computer
2011-03-25T10:41:00.000Z	SwedeMike	earthling_	oki, then I have no idea. In my mind I am considering LBA mode as a culprit, but I don't know enough about it to say if might cause problem.
2011-03-25T10:41:00.000Z	earthling_		perhaps this old comp has usb 1.1
2011-03-25T10:42:00.000Z	earthling_		I'm using a 3 month old usb drive
2011-03-25T10:42:00.000Z	earthling_		or maybe some computers just don't like to boot from usb
2011-03-25T10:43:00.000Z	SwedeMike	earthling_	well, if it's in the boot order then it should be fine. How large is the USB drive? trying to remember what size problems came at what point in time, you might want to try a smaller one. Also, burning a CD always works :P
2011-03-25T10:43:00.000Z	earthling_	SwedeMike	4 gb
2011-03-25T10:44:00.000Z	earthling_	SwedeMike	CD did work, wanted ability to save changes though
2011-03-25T10:44:00.000Z	SwedeMike	earthling_	I'm out of ideas.
