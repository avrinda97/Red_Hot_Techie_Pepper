2005-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	vladuz976		anybody know what the permission 0710 stands for
2005-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	-rwx--x---
2005-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	how do you see that
2005-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	i found this out without any thought: touch /tmp/foo; chmod 0710 /tmp/foo; ls -l /tmp/foo
2005-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	that means read write exexte by user and x by anyone in group?
2005-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	yes
2005-07-31T16:27:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	pretty odd permissions, seems to me...
2005-07-31T16:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	it's for mutt
2005-07-31T16:27:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	on a directory?
2005-07-31T16:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	file
2005-07-31T16:27:00.000Z	vladuz976		getmailrc
2005-07-31T16:27:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	well i don't see what the --x for group is good for - how can you execute a file if you can't read it?
2005-07-31T16:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	you probably can't but, sine i have rwx it should be ok for me should i set it to 0755 ?
2005-07-31T16:28:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	0700 should be fine for you, i think
2005-07-31T16:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	why did you do the touch thing on /tmp
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	prolly doesn't matter, anyway
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	to create it
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	vladuz976	useruser	why in /tmp
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	useruser	vladuz976	because it's useless
