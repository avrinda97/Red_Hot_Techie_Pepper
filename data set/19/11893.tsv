2005-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	joey_		wmv files should play in totem with w32codecs
2005-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	joey_		yep
2005-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	joey_		what happened? did you get them?
2005-12-12T07:20:00.000Z	joey_		whAAAAAT?
2005-12-12T07:20:00.000Z	joey_		mine works like mad
2005-12-12T07:20:00.000Z	joey_		you didn't get the codecs?
2005-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	joey_		oh man, you need to comment those repos, they can break your system if you use them all the time.
2005-12-12T07:22:00.000Z	joey_		it's great, sorry you hate it.
2005-12-12T07:22:00.000Z	joey_		did you check the repos i sent you?
2005-12-12T07:24:00.000Z	joey_		xubuntu anyone?
2005-12-12T07:24:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	I've used it.
2005-12-12T07:25:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	I love xfce, but on my ubuntu machine I'm currently using kde, for some reason...
2005-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	yes.
2005-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	You're probably using the card for something else, as xfce doesn't load up an audio playing engine by default.
2005-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	I mean, stop amarok. Stop every audio-playing device on the system. Now try with that flash applet :)
2005-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	Currently, your system can probably play one audio source at a time.
2005-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	Can you use amaroK while playing some other audio file with another player?
2005-12-12T07:30:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	That's what I thought.
2005-12-12T07:31:00.000Z	redondos	joey_	oh well, if that happens then I don't know, sorry. not really using flash
