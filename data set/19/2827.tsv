2012-07-29T17:53:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	Well... Sudo apt-get install gdm. You will be asked for your default login manager during install. There you choose 'gdm'.
2012-07-29T17:53:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	but so i will have to use gdm right? if possible i want to fix the problem with lightdm
2012-07-29T17:55:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	I saw this kind of delay with lightdm on some computers (2-3 sec). It might depend on hardware.
2012-07-29T17:56:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	i have a 2nd Gen i7
2012-07-29T17:57:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	and the delay is about 30 seconds
2012-07-29T17:57:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	well CPU should be ok... ;) Do you use the Intel HD4000 GPU? I have a i5 3570k(ivy) and don't have any delay.
2012-07-29T17:58:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	it used to be vary fast... it started being slow yesterday
2012-07-29T17:59:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	Did you try to 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm' once? That might help...
2012-07-29T17:59:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	i alredy tried
2012-07-29T18:01:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	Did you change your wallpaper? I don't know. Maybe lightdm doesn't love some heavy wallpapers...
2012-07-29T18:01:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	the wallpaper is in the same resolution of screen.
2012-07-29T18:05:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	Try to have a look on that one http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg3749396.html
2012-07-29T18:56:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	i already tested, no problem with wallpaper and i already done a dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
2012-07-29T19:06:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	Did you upgrade  from an older system? Could an old lightdm config file cause the problem??
2012-07-29T19:07:00.000Z	User_007	minimec	no it was a fresh install. It don't use to happen before yesterday. Today i purged lightdm and deleted every file/folder with lightdm on it's name, and then installed lightdm again
2012-07-29T19:09:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	I have no clue sorry.
2012-07-29T19:14:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	That is interesting. Add user-session=ubuntu after [SeatDefaults]
2012-07-29T19:24:00.000Z	minimec	User_007	Good to know.
