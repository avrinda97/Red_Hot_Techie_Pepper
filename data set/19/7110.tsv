2007-12-05T06:02:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x		So my processor runs approx. 10 degrees warmer in Ubuntu than it does in XP
2007-12-05T06:02:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x		so that the fan is on nearly constantly.
2007-12-05T06:03:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	cpufreq might help   http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty
2007-12-05T06:07:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	I already have frequency scaling set up.
2007-12-07T05:05:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	 got some java app working ?
2007-12-07T05:07:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	 you are confusing me, when you get  100% cpu , open a terminal and type top,  see what process is on top of the list
2007-12-07T05:07:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	that's the thing.  there's nothing listed in top that's eating CPU cycles... it just seems to be unrelated to ANYthing
2007-12-07T05:08:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	try with sudo top , might bring up more processes
2007-12-07T05:09:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	I don't mean to be difficult, but I've tried that.
2007-12-07T05:10:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	could it be the display that is wrong ? is  your system behaving as if is it using 100% cpu &
2007-12-07T05:11:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	now THAT sounds like a very good possibility!  In top and sudo top, nothing shows as chewing up 100% CPU, but in gnome-system-monitor, it shows 100% CPU usage w/o any apps eating that much CPU
2007-12-07T05:12:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	in system-monitor when you turn it on , the sys-mon itself does take quite a bit of cpu to get running , but it tends to go up and down for a while
2007-12-07T05:12:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	alas, it's not just with system mon.
2007-12-07T05:13:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	 there is a pannel app you can use to monitor your cpu and mem and a bunch of otehr suff that you can basicaly ahve on all the time, that might give you a better idea
2007-12-07T05:13:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	sensors-applet  might need to apt-get it first
2007-12-07T05:14:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	all right.  I'll look into it
2007-12-16T04:53:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	make a crontab rule to restart the screenlets every hour
2007-12-16T04:56:00.000Z	Pelo	xTheGoat121x	It's probabaly a memory leak in the way screenlets is coded,   you'll need to check in their forum for a clue
2007-12-16T04:56:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Pelo	ah, gotcha... all righty.  I appreciate the Crontab rule hint.
