2007-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	NkZ		Guys, I have a huge problem
2007-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	NkZ		Even since the last ubuntu update my PC is going nuts, even rebooting alone
2007-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	have you tried 'apt-get update' and 'apt-get upgrade' ?
2007-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	discussion and opinion go in #ubuntu-offtopic.
2007-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	you're trolling about how much Ubuntu sucks. please take that to -offtopic, there are people who are tryign to get support here without complaining.
2007-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	have you tried apt-get update && apt-get upgrade?
2007-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	then that's kind of weird. have you tried booting with acpi off?
2007-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	there isa  boot flag, on sec
2007-02-24T10:37:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	rebooting for me was usually lloose / bad RAM. had a look at that?
2007-02-24T10:38:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	what did the updates pull in, mate?
2007-02-24T11:30:00.000Z	NkZ	lastnode	I checked the memory, It's not it, Also ran the memtest thing at the boot.
2007-02-24T11:30:00.000Z	NkZ	lastnode	Could you please point me again to that file speaking about booting options?
2007-02-24T11:30:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	hmm, that's really weird.
2007-02-24T11:31:00.000Z	NkZ	lastnode	Thanks! What kind of programs do integrate the acpi? Any idea?
2007-02-24T11:31:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	ACPI stands for Advanced Configuration & Power Interface, do the math ;)
2007-02-24T11:32:00.000Z	NkZ	lastnode	Weird stuff. I thought it might be beryl messing up, but since you I do the math I think it's not it.
2007-02-24T11:33:00.000Z	lastnode	NkZ	problems like yours usually fascinate me. but im crazy busy atm with school. else id be of more use. sorry.
2007-02-24T11:33:00.000Z	NkZ	lastnode	I know the meaning, I think I could just sit and wait for a patch.
2007-02-24T11:34:00.000Z	NkZ	lastnode	Just out of thought, could the Printer set up be the nest of my isses?
