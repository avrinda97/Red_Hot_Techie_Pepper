2004-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	Cardador	Sirius_Black	theres your problem :)
2004-10-03T15:12:00.000Z	Cardador	Sirius_Black	if you wanted sid, why not use debian installer?
2004-10-03T15:13:00.000Z	Sirius_Black	Cardador	the answer is simple - couse it is much easier to install 2.6 kernel debian based distro than it is debian itself :-))
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	Cardador	Sirius_Black	hmm you could have used knoppix
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	Sirius_Black	Cardador	knopixx has no gnome 2.8
2004-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	Cardador	Sirius_Black	i had sid AND gnome 2.8
2004-10-03T15:15:00.000Z	Cardador	Sirius_Black	it is available on experimental
2004-10-03T15:15:00.000Z	Sirius_Black	Cardador	so whu have you moved to ubuntu then
2004-10-03T15:16:00.000Z	Cardador	Sirius_Black	i just fell ubuntu is much more oriented to desktop use than plain debian
2004-10-03T15:16:00.000Z	Sirius_Black	Cardador	couldnt agree more mate
