2007-03-03T08:59:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	i like audacity too
2007-03-03T09:02:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	does flac work for you in amarok? I installed amarok and it wouldn't play flac, though all my other players would
2007-03-03T09:02:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	flac? im not familar with that. is that aac?
2007-03-03T09:03:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	Free Lossles Audio Codec
2007-03-03T09:04:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	i have never tried to play those, what version of amarok you using?
2007-03-03T09:05:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	the latest one in synaptic. I read on the amarok page that flac was broken in the lastest build, so I guess I'll just wait for the fix to come
2007-03-03T09:06:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	im not sure, do the files play in other programs?
2007-03-03T09:07:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	yeah they do. since the people on the amarok website said it's a bug, there's probably nothing to do about it
2007-03-03T09:07:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	well, they may fix it soon, you could try converting the files.
2007-03-03T09:08:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	lol, I like my flac files, I'll just use amarok for mp3s I have for the time being
2007-03-03T09:12:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	one comes out every 18months
2007-03-03T09:13:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	so another year or so I think
2007-03-03T09:23:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	i see what you mean, one person will tell you 1 is the best, another person will tell you 2 is the best (you see the comparison)
2007-03-03T09:24:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	yeah, and both have good reasons for why they think so
2007-03-03T09:25:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	"People forcing their opinion on others doesn't bother me one bit, what bothers me is when someone forces a wrong opinion on someone else"-me
2007-03-03T09:26:00.000Z	phixnay	Jarhead756	what I don't like is when someone is giving you line by line instructions, and then you find out you've hosed your computer because he didn't tell you you were messing with the system
2007-03-03T09:32:00.000Z	Jarhead756	phixnay	is rockbox any good? how about on my ipod? what are the benifits of it?
