2007-09-09T14:22:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	i feel like you want to change _owner_ of the file
2007-09-09T14:23:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	sudo chown theuseryouwant thefiles
2007-09-09T14:23:00.000Z	neol	TTilus	how exactly i need full format/ command.
2007-09-09T14:24:00.000Z	neol	TTilus	i tried chmod but i dint work out, may be some work syntax.
2007-09-09T14:24:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	that was full, just replace user and file
2007-09-09T14:25:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	you do not want to chMOD, you want to chOWN, to change OWNER, not privileges
2007-09-09T14:25:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	sudo chown theuseryouwant file1 file2 ...

2007-09-09T14:30:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	if you want to write to folder you need either own the folder and have rwx for owner, or belong to group which the folder belongs to and have rwx for group or have rwx for world (other) for the folder
2007-09-13T05:54:00.000Z	TTilus	neol	locate finds if the file _existed_ 24+ hours ago
