2010-04-12T07:00:00.000Z	abc123	LinuxGuy2009	how do you open multiple tabs in the same terminal window when writing a bash script?
2010-04-12T07:00:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	If your writing a bash script you can use a plain text editor if you like.
2010-04-12T07:01:00.000Z	abc123	LinuxGuy2009	but what is the command to start  a new tab?
2010-04-12T07:01:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	Shift+Ctrl+T?
2010-04-12T07:02:00.000Z	abc123	LinuxGuy2009	I meant in a bash script
2010-04-12T07:02:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	umm
2010-04-12T07:03:00.000Z	abc123	LinuxGuy2009	"umm"? do I put a slash before that or anything?
2010-04-12T07:03:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	--tab-with-profile=PROFILENAME
2010-04-12T07:04:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	I can just as easily tell smartasses to go help themselves.
2010-04-12T07:05:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	I just told you how. If you need more details "man gnome-terminal".
2010-04-12T07:05:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	You here to troll?
2010-04-12T07:06:00.000Z	abc123	LinuxGuy2009	I'm gonna have to report/ignore you if you continue with the insults
2010-04-12T07:06:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	Same here.
2010-04-12T07:07:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	 And yes you do put a - before the ummm.
2010-04-12T07:08:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	abc123	"gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile=PROFILENAME"
2010-04-12T07:23:00.000Z	abc123	LinuxGuy2009	how do you make the new commands appear in the new tab that is opened in the way you showed me?
