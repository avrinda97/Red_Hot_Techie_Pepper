2011-10-12T23:18:00.000Z	Surkow|laptop		hmm, guys the proper place to go for wireless issues?
2011-10-12T23:20:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	what is your issue
2011-10-12T23:21:00.000Z	Surkow|laptop	madmax_	since three weeks I can no longer make use of my wireless internet. Ethernet works fine. Wireless connects fine with at least four networks. In Windows and with a bootable ubuntu usb live disk internet works without hassles
2011-10-12T23:22:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	are you using a network manager to connect, or the cli?
2011-10-12T23:24:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	can you explain more, 2 networks?
2011-10-12T23:25:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	so you are cabled to one, and trying to wifi to the other?
2011-10-12T23:27:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	are you using the computer to chat now?
2011-10-12T23:28:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	usually, when I plug in my network cable, the ethernet takes over, changing the routing table.
2011-10-12T23:30:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	what ip address does your wifi get?
2011-10-12T23:30:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	and your eth
2011-10-12T23:31:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	what does the routing table look like?
2011-10-12T23:33:00.000Z	Surkow|laptop	madmax_	did you receive the query?
2011-10-12T23:34:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	yes, try without the cable in, but disconnect and reconnect to the wifi after pulling the cable
2011-10-12T23:35:00.000Z	Surkow|laptop	madmax_	same thing
2011-10-12T23:36:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	did the routing table change?
2011-10-12T23:37:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	if the routing table didn't change, then that is why you cannot ping/connect
2011-10-12T23:38:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	check the nm, make sure things are set to auto, and no manual stuff is set
2011-10-12T23:38:00.000Z	Surkow|laptop	madmax_	everything is correct
2011-10-13T00:04:00.000Z	madmax_	Surkow|laptop	what is in /etc/network/interfaces
