2010-10-18T18:12:00.000Z	memory6	onryo	i thought as you but i think its about driver how can i change driver settings
2010-10-18T18:12:00.000Z	memory6	onryo	ubuntu 10.10
2010-10-18T18:13:00.000Z	onryo	memory6	? that is really weird? I know there was a problem with mixed mode when used with g/n but that was fixed
2010-10-18T18:13:00.000Z	onryo	memory6	have you tried uname -a
2010-10-18T18:14:00.000Z	onryo	memory6	maybe you have compiled some drivers once before and they are still left. If that is the case you need to black list them
2010-10-18T18:21:00.000Z	memory6	onryo	thanks for your advices i want to add that when i reboot with windows 7 it turns normal and what should i add to blacklist
2010-10-18T18:23:00.000Z	onryo	memory6	you need to make sure that only the mac(kernel) driver is activated. There is a black list that you can add the other diver that wants to take over
2010-10-18T18:25:00.000Z	onryo	memory6	you will find the blacklist here /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2010-10-18T18:29:00.000Z	memory6	onryo	thanks
