2006-07-08T09:29:00.000Z	wsjunior	narfmaster	hum.. let me try..
2006-07-08T09:30:00.000Z	wsjunior	narfmaster	still doesnt work. i can mount it normally but i cant see the icon at the desktop.
2006-07-08T09:30:00.000Z	narfmaster	wsjunior	it might be a nautilus setting
2006-07-08T09:31:00.000Z	wsjunior	narfmaster	could u help me to get it working?
2006-07-08T09:31:00.000Z	narfmaster	wsjunior	look at "/apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible" in gconf-editor
2006-07-08T09:32:00.000Z	wsjunior	narfmaster	it is checked.
2006-07-08T09:33:00.000Z	narfmaster	wsjunior	well that's the limit of my comprehension on the matter :p
2006-07-08T09:34:00.000Z	wsjunior	narfmaster	what i want to mount is in /mnt is it right? because when i plug an usb device it is mounted in /media...
2006-07-08T09:34:00.000Z	narfmaster	wsjunior	it doesn't really matter where you mount it
2006-07-08T09:34:00.000Z	wsjunior	narfmaster	as i thought....
2006-07-24T10:14:00.000Z	narfmaster	wsjunior	i don't think so
