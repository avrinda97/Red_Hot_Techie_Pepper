2007-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	igxmyzt	Why would he need to re-install Ubuntu?
2007-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	igxmyzt	Jordan_U	if all the disk space is partitioned to ubuntu, you'd have to repartition which means reinstalling os's
2007-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	igxmyzt	No it doesn't, you can re-size partitions
2007-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	igxmyzt	Does the default not work?
2007-06-16T13:00:00.000Z	igxmyzt	Jordan_U	no, default is my old card. i have 3 video cards
2007-06-16T13:02:00.000Z	igxmyzt	Jordan_U	i have my integrated disabled on windows, and use the other 2 on two monitors on windows.
2007-06-16T13:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	igxmyzt	As long as you reconfigure X once you install the new card there should be no problem

2007-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	igxmyzt	Jordan_U	what's the -phigh for?
2007-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	igxmyzt	Only asks "high" priority questions, in this case driver and resolution
