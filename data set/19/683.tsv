2011-10-27T10:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	when it goes black can you press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and get a console?
2011-10-27T10:15:00.000Z	Satanaa	ActionParsnip	nope
2011-10-27T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	are screensaver and power settings set to never dim etc?
2011-10-27T10:16:00.000Z	Satanaa	ActionParsnip	right now i have caffeine installed so my screen never goes to idle
2011-10-27T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	i know some server switches for xorg.conf. Kde still has sweet power/screensaver disabling ability
2011-10-27T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	i see. I always turn that stuff off
2011-10-27T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	are there bugs reported?
2011-10-27T10:20:00.000Z	Satanaa	ActionParsnip	i dont know
2011-10-27T10:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	i suggest you check. It may be a known issue for your make/model (assuming the system has one)
2011-10-27T10:22:00.000Z	Satanaa	ActionParsnip	i could try, but this is more something they should fix and send out
2011-10-27T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	why forced?
2011-10-27T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	what about suse, mandriva, fedora, xpud, puppy and so on?
2011-10-27T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	natty is still very supported, as is maverick.
2011-10-27T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	theyaren't bad at all
2011-10-27T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	they work just as well..
2011-10-27T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	and without actually looking, you wouldn't know either
2011-10-27T18:55:00.000Z	Satanaa	ActionParsnip	its not about me knowing hehe
2011-10-27T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Satanaa	both are equally developed and supported
2011-10-27T23:21:00.000Z	Satanaa	ActionParsnip	but 11.10 should have most of the focus hehe
