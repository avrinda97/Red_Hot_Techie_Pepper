2009-11-10T15:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	a tar compressed is just like a zip file. but it is unix compatible
2009-11-10T15:18:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	Ok, thanks, but I use Ubuntu Server so it has to be cli?
2009-11-10T15:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	i see. maybe something like rsnapashot ? http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/217
2009-11-10T15:21:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	Yea, maybe. Wouldn't it work to just zip a lot of files and then use the ordinary cp command together with a cron job?
2009-11-10T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	it will work. but use tarballs not zip. tar can store unix ownership and file modes etc...
2009-11-10T15:29:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	Aha, ok, that would be nice, would tarballs work using files in Ubuntu encrypted Home directory also or will it somehow remove the encryption?
2009-11-10T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	well that i really dunno. if you run from a cron job maybe the tar sees the encrypted files (becouse is not you who is running it) but i dunno
2009-11-10T15:33:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	I have heard that the files are mapped from encrypted to be seen decrypted after logging in, BUT that the files also are stored as encrypted. Then if I copy the encrypted (not decrypted) files from wherever they are stored then the encryption will stay on even in a tarball?
2009-11-10T15:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	i guess so. but can not tell never used enciption myself
2009-11-10T15:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	and i do not know how easy is to restore encrypted file from a tarball
2009-11-10T15:38:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	Ok, well, I have to give it a try then bedfore I schedule it.
2009-11-10T15:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	if the file is not corrupted. ther is no risk. What i fear is that the encrypted home solution may layout encrypted files in non standar way or something
2009-11-10T15:43:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	Aha, ok.
2009-11-10T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	if the filesystem you try to umount is in use you ca not umunt it.
2009-11-10T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	seems like you are trying to umount your home partition. You can only do that from single user mode (recovery mode)
2009-11-10T18:54:00.000Z	Valentina	erUSUL	Hm, I get confused, I hade sda1 and sdb1 before, then I iserted a new hard drive and booted. Hoe could sdc1 be in use?
2009-11-10T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	maybe the new disk changed the order of the disks. sdb is now sdc and viceversa
2009-11-10T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	that's why we use uuid
2009-11-10T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Valentina	yes it is
