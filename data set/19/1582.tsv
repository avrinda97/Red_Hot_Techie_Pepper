2011-03-09T02:00:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	OrangePeel	as i know blue rays are large files, isn't it?
2011-03-09T02:00:00.000Z	OrangePeel		No, they can be dumbed down, and they're not movies.
2011-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	OrangePeel	scriptwarlock	they can be compressed, and they're not movies.
2011-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	OrangePeel	now that you compressed what happened?
