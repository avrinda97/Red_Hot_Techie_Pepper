2007-09-04T16:22:00.000Z	brown_cat		heya! what is the average install time for ububtu
2007-09-04T16:23:00.000Z	jerichokb	brown_cat	not long, probably about an hour for it all to finish. depends on system specs of course
2007-09-04T16:23:00.000Z	brown_cat		reasonably crappy pc
2007-09-04T16:24:00.000Z	jerichokb		give yourself two hours just in case brown_cat. compared to the six hours it took to install win xp it's nothing :)
2007-09-04T16:24:00.000Z	brown_cat		you don't wanna know how ling vista took!!
2007-09-04T16:24:00.000Z	brown_cat		*long
2007-09-04T16:24:00.000Z	brown_cat		it took me hours
2007-09-04T16:25:00.000Z	jerichokb		haha i don't ever want to find out, installing xp was bad enough.
2007-09-04T16:26:00.000Z	brown_cat		ok, my pc has been sitting on a black screen for a while - I clicked install (it had ms 2000 and I wanted to write over it) - then it eventually loaded up the desktop. I selected the desktop "install" icon - it has done some stuff and the screen is blacxk
2007-09-04T16:28:00.000Z	jerichokb	brown_cat	doesn't sound good, should be able to carry on using the live cd while installing.
2007-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	brown_cat		huh?

2007-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	jerichokb		oh so you are in the live cd now?
2007-09-04T16:29:00.000Z	brown_cat		mhm
2007-09-04T16:30:00.000Z	brown_cat		:s i was mailed the cd
2007-09-04T16:30:00.000Z	brown_cat		i inserted it while booting
2007-09-04T16:31:00.000Z	jerichokb		you're on here from the live cd but the installation window is black, or the whole screen?
2007-09-04T16:32:00.000Z	brown_cat	jerichokb	the whole screen is dark
