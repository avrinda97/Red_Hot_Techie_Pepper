2012-03-20T23:25:00.000Z	JesseC		I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04, but my network card doesn't seem to be recognized. lspci returns the broadcom interface, but dmesg doesn't show anything related to the card at boot.
2012-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	JesseC		I have also ran all updates and upgraded to the latest kernel using apt-offline, because I figured the driver would be in the release, but that didn't help either.
2012-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	mcb_	JesseC	Install aditional driver. Go system -> Adminitration -> Aditional drivers. See if you have anything to install.
2012-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	JesseC	mcb_	it's ubuntu server
2012-03-20T23:27:00.000Z	JesseC		headless
2012-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	mcb_	JesseC	: $apt-get install b43-fwcutter
2012-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	JesseC		can't connect to the internet..
2012-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	JesseC		but I'll download the deb, sec.
2012-03-20T23:29:00.000Z	JesseC	mcb_	that also isn't the chipset of the driver I need, does that matter?
2012-03-20T23:29:00.000Z	mcb_	JesseC	In another machine thar connects. $apt-get install -d b43-fwcutter. copy the .deb and $dpkg -i package in the server.
2012-03-20T23:30:00.000Z	mcb_	JesseC	That is the only driver i used with broadcom. I dont know for sure.
2012-03-20T23:30:00.000Z	JesseC	mcb_	This one is, BCM57781
2012-03-20T23:31:00.000Z	JesseC	mcb_	doesn't seem to be covered under the BCM43xx list.
2012-03-20T23:32:00.000Z	mcb_	JesseC	You can always $apt-cache search broadcom and try to find something more specific for you.
2012-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	JesseC		It's not wireless
2012-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	JesseC		sorry]
2012-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	JesseC		This is just a gigabit onboard wired ethernet.
2012-03-20T23:35:00.000Z	mcb_	JesseC	There the package "bcm5700-source".
2012-03-20T23:36:00.000Z	JesseC	mcb_	Yes, reading up on it, but I've attempted to compile the driver by hand without success.
