2006-09-02T07:31:00.000Z	sris		Is it possible that installing ubuntu on a slave drive (ide) with a cd-rom as primary, could cause some weird problems?
2006-09-02T07:31:00.000Z	sris		master*
2006-09-02T07:32:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 i don'r see how it would cause any problem
2006-09-02T07:33:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	ok, im trying to figure out what i've done ;)
2006-09-02T07:34:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	because i cant close my cd-tray anymore and grub isn't working. just installed ubuntu for the first time ;)
2006-09-02T07:34:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 weird,  i did that  with another distro  while i was running windows and it worked fine,
2006-09-02T07:35:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 something  must have gone  screwie
2006-09-02T07:35:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	i think it's maybesomething with that, and the fact that i've got a lot of ide/sata disc in a nice mix ;)
2006-09-02T07:36:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 umm true,  have you though about making ur secondry  slave the master slave  and the cdrom  the secondry slave
2006-09-02T07:37:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	yeah, just hope i could work around it. but now i cant boot ubuntu at all ;)
2006-09-02T07:37:00.000Z	sris		so nothing changes except my cd readers all screwd up ;)
2006-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 yikes  that bad  hmmm  try  switching the  cabels  you might have to reinstall grub  someone  here might have another suggestion
2006-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	brendonjt		jaminpotato:  they are releasing edgy  that early  in the game>
2006-09-02T07:39:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	yeah guess i'll have to mix it up a little. that's why i asked about the install prompting grub stuff, because it all seemed to happen so fast and automagic
2006-09-02T07:41:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 i know what you mean  on that one,  umm
2006-09-02T07:42:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	i just hope i dont destroy my windows-install because then im screwd too ;)
2006-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 umm you can boot of your windows xp disk  and  go to the repair consol and type fdisk .mbr  and that will make it back to the default  ms config
2006-09-02T07:44:00.000Z	sris	brendonjt	oh, i didnt know that, thanks
2006-09-02T07:46:00.000Z	brendonjt	sris	 that ok,  just keep trying  to  install  ubuntu
