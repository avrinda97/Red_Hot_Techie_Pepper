2009-01-11T01:25:00.000Z	Galadx		i tried but i waited 2 hours and got nothing
2009-01-11T01:26:00.000Z	jim_p	Galadx	are you on ati??
2009-01-11T01:27:00.000Z	jim_p	Galadx	good luck with the alternative cd. ati and xorg 1.5 do not match. period!
2009-01-11T01:27:00.000Z	Galadx	jim_p	so i can't install it?
2009-01-11T01:28:00.000Z	jim_p	Galadx	you cant install if you use the normal live cd. and the same will occur if you install atis drivers after the installation on the hdd
2009-01-11T01:29:00.000Z	jim_p	Galadx	so either go to 8.04 or use another distro with xorg 1.4
2009-01-11T01:29:00.000Z	Galadx	jim_p	so use an older version then? 8.04?
2009-01-11T01:29:00.000Z	jim_p	Galadx	8.04 is safer if you dont have hardware that needs a newer kernel. that is a p45 chipset mobo and some new intel cpus and tons of wireless chipsets
2009-01-11T01:30:00.000Z	jim_p	Galadx	try the alternative first
2009-01-11T01:43:00.000Z	Galadx	jim_p	why does 8.04 come up as a rar file?
