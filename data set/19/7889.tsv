2008-08-23T04:30:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	IBM ThinkCentres have a system type and this is the model of the machine. Check for a sticker on the front of the machine or around the sides. On laptops its underneath the machine
2008-08-23T04:31:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	I just read read the channel log and are you having trouble booting the ubuntu cd on the think centre?
2008-08-23T04:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	yah first machine that has suprised me, the way the startup is layed out is confusing enough
2008-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	on the thinkcentre DESKTOPS you press F12 during POST to select which device to boot from
2008-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	on the laptops, the laptop keyboard will have a blue IBM button you press to interrupt normal boot and check the boot order
2008-08-23T04:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	frigging f12 is doing nothign but bios state it does that :/
2008-08-23T04:34:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	usb keyboard?
2008-08-23T04:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	i think uk
2008-08-23T04:36:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	I'm asking whether the keyboard is a PS/2 or a USB one. Not what language it is. To find out, look at the cable connector that is plugged into the PC and tell me whether its a round one or a rectangular one
2008-08-23T04:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	ShdwShinobi, beam_: what do i need to find on the inside that might help me identify the actual mob type i.e. model
2008-08-23T04:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	PS/2
2008-08-23T04:37:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	I already told you that IBM don't have a concept of models, the System Type value corresponds to a model/version
2008-08-23T04:37:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	Does the CDROM drive's light ever come on?
2008-08-23T04:38:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	also, lets take this to priv. msgs since following the channel is difficult for me
2008-08-23T04:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	everything works :'(
2008-08-23T04:45:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	This is the manual for your IBM thinkcentre: ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/pc/pccbbs/thinkcentre_pdf/13r9196.pdf   <--- See Page 101. It clearly states pressing F12 allows you to select startup device!
2008-08-23T04:47:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	yah i know the bios also states it but it didnt help, however after removing the CMOD battery and messing with the f keys i managed to open a menu option, im currently installing xubuntu even if i dont know how it happened :/
2008-08-23T04:47:00.000Z	thingy	Pirate_Hunter	right good luck with that then!
2008-08-23T04:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thingy	ty except ive got a second machine of this to install as well and this time kubuntu
