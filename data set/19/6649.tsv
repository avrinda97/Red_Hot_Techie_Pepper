2008-01-05T04:51:00.000Z	prav33n		Hello, all
2008-01-05T04:52:00.000Z	prav33n		I have a Thinkpad T60
2008-01-05T04:52:00.000Z	prav33n		I removed Windows XP and the recovery partition completly when I installed Linux on it
2008-01-05T04:52:00.000Z	prav33n		I now want to install Windows XP
2008-01-05T04:52:00.000Z	prav33n		I ordered and got the recovery CD from IBM
2008-01-05T04:53:00.000Z	prav33n		Does anyone know if I can install Windows from the rescue disk without losing existing partition layout?
2008-01-05T04:53:00.000Z	ronni1	prav33n	you doing a dual boot?
2008-01-05T04:53:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	Not yet
2008-01-05T04:54:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	I wiped out the preinstalled Windows when I installed my debian
2008-01-05T04:55:00.000Z	ronni1	prav33n	everyone does that, preinstalled is lame. if you do a dual boot though install windows first and leave space then use an altnernate ubuntu install disc
2008-01-05T04:55:00.000Z	ronni1	prav33n	grub will show both then
2008-01-05T04:55:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	Thanks
2008-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	I have used Linux since 1998
2008-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	I am aware of how to dual boot
2008-01-05T04:56:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	My question is if IBM rescue disk will erase the partition layout
2008-01-05T04:57:00.000Z	ronni1	prav33n	umm I thought it would be just like regularly installing windows, even if not you could try an ntfs resizing tool like gparted live cd
2008-01-05T04:58:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	IBM says that it will restore the HDD to the factory state
2008-01-05T05:00:00.000Z	ronni1	prav33n	if it doesn't let you specify paritions then you'll have to resize some say they can install linux first then windows but I think you have to mess with mbr or grub to do that and very annoying. Can't you backup files from the drive?
2008-01-05T05:01:00.000Z	prav33n	ronni1	Now-a-days these rescue disks are so dumb that they don't have any user control
