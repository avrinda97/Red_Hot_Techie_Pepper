2007-02-21T14:10:00.000Z	Emmett		I've got ubuntu running and it seems to recognize eth0 just fine. It can see the router, I can get to it from other machines on the local network, but it doesn't appear to have internet access.
2007-02-21T14:11:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	smells like DNS
2007-02-21T14:11:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	That's what I thought too, but it grabs an appropriate IP.
2007-02-21T14:12:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	DHCP != DNS
2007-02-21T14:13:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	http://64.26.155.12/pony-cd-cover.jpg
2007-02-21T14:13:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	see the pretty picture

2007-02-21T14:14:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	see the pretty picture?
2007-02-21T14:15:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	then your problem is, as i originally told you, DNS. ;)
2007-02-21T14:16:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	ensure the DHCP server is passing valid addresses
2007-02-21T14:16:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	It is.
2007-02-21T14:17:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	It's using the same nameserver as other machines on the network that can ping out just fine.
2007-02-21T14:18:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	nslookup cnn.com ip.of.known.nameserver
2007-02-21T14:19:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	Works in both places.
2007-02-21T14:20:00.000Z	mneptok	Emmett	then the DNS servers your Linux machine is using do not match what you think they are. reboot.
2007-02-21T14:21:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	Alrighty.
2007-02-21T14:23:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	Alright, rebooted. What now?
2007-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	I'm still getting the same response from the nslookup in both places.
2007-02-21T14:30:00.000Z	Emmett	mneptok	ping?
