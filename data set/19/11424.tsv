2006-01-24T09:46:00.000Z	jcuse		I could write to it on windows :(
2006-01-24T09:46:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	you can still write to it on windows
2006-01-24T09:46:00.000Z	jcuse	sethk	I dont use windows anymore
2006-01-24T09:46:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	then what possible use is there for NTFS?
2006-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	jcuse	sethk	I am switching from windows to ubuntu
2006-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	then reading should be fine, you shouldn't need to write
2006-01-24T09:48:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	sure, once you change it to a different type of file system.
2006-01-24T09:49:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	in ubuntu we mkfs, we don't format
2006-01-24T09:49:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	yes.  it means "make file system"
2006-01-24T09:50:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	really?  took me two minutes.
2006-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	I can't imagine anything easier.  I just brought up the dialog and selected the resolution.  Easier than windows, actually.
2006-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	very unlikely that you needed to.
2006-01-24T10:02:00.000Z	sethk	jcuse	you can create a shortcut which starts a file browser with that file system as the initial directory, if you like.
