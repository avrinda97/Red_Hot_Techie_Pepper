2005-04-10T05:53:00.000Z	black_nightmare		hmm if it returns me to the prompt again with no further text this means I wouldn't have it?

2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		someone want to explain this to me?? ....
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		Package acroread is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		is only available from another source
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		E: Package acroread has no installation candidate
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		*sighs*
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		airox..how do I do that in terminal now?
2005-04-10T05:56:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	Use the Synaptic package manager elsewise.
2005-04-11T07:00:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	You cannot access applications:// in hoary.
2005-04-11T07:01:00.000Z	black_nightmare	vixus	- so where the hell did synaptic download this emulator to when its not even in the applications :|
2005-04-11T07:02:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	Try typing the emulator name in bash?
2005-04-11T07:03:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	OR rather, the command that would  run the emulator
2005-04-11T07:03:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	Then get the <google>Gnome 2.10 Menu Editor</google> and add it yourself.
2005-04-11T07:07:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	Add a launcher to the gnome panel
2005-04-11T07:08:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	yes
2005-04-11T07:08:00.000Z	vixus	black_nightmare	Tick the run in terminal button if you have to.
