2006-10-31T14:12:00.000Z	silentdis		aargh, stupid lag, stupid tiny buffer....
2006-10-31T14:12:00.000Z	silentdis		ok... i think i see my problem.  I didn'g grab the restricted modules.  I can fix this, just need to know what to pick to get me back into X temporarily.  what is the safe driver called?
2006-10-31T14:13:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2006-10-31T14:13:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	what does that do?
2006-10-31T14:13:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	restores your xorg.conf
2006-10-31T14:14:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	as much as I'd like to do that, i've probably overwritten it 50 times trying to get it working by this point lol
2006-10-31T14:14:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	but you want your original again or what?
2006-10-31T14:15:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	no, i am just looking to choose a 'safe' or 'basic' driver for my xconfig, so I can grab some packages with synaptec that I missed.  I just am not sure what it's called lol
2006-10-31T14:15:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	ah sorry - thought you screwed up your xorg
2006-10-31T14:16:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	what card?
2006-10-31T14:16:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	I did, sort of lol.  forgot to grab the restricted modules.  needed for the nvidia driver
2006-10-31T14:16:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	nvidia Geforce 7600gs
2006-10-31T14:17:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	shouldn't it be just nvidia then as a driver?
2006-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	yes, if i had the restricted modules installed, this would be working just fine.  problem is, i forgot them, and need to grab them with synaptic.  i just need to get back into X long enough to do that.  just not sure what to pick for the driver in my config right now, as a 'safe' driver
2006-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	try Xorg -configure and see if that works
2006-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	thank you.  i am just not explaining my situation well it appears.  my apologies for the confusion.  I'll just tinker :)
2006-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	maybe i'm just up too shortly
2006-10-31T14:21:00.000Z	silentdis	zlack	timfrost: I fount it.  just tried a couple till one worked.  i'm on the vesa driver right now.  just needed to get in so I could use synaptic :)
2006-10-31T14:21:00.000Z	zlack	silentdis	cool
