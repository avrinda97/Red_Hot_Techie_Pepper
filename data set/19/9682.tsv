2006-10-16T15:09:00.000Z	SB|nblracer	LjL	it is not ntfs
2006-10-16T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	and what happens when you try to mount it
2006-10-16T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	so, "fdisk /dev/hdb" results in an error?
2006-10-16T15:11:00.000Z	SB|nblracer	LjL	yes, says unable to open
2006-10-16T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	well, of course you'd have to be root for that to work. are you?
2006-10-16T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	the right command to type is "sudo fdisk /dev/hdb"
2006-10-16T15:13:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	and, besides, perhaps you could use "sudo cfdisk /dev/hdb" instead, i find that more user friendly
2006-10-16T15:13:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	the bot just told you
2006-10-16T15:14:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	sudo is simply the command you use in Ubuntu to do things as root. please read the bot-provided document. it's an important thing to know.
2006-10-31T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	first you need to mount it
2006-10-31T17:59:00.000Z	SB|nblracer	LjL	it is mounted
2006-10-31T06:00:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	well then the problem is?
2006-10-31T06:00:00.000Z	SB|nblracer	LjL	from console how do i switch in to that drive
2006-10-31T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	"cd /media/hdc1" should work
2006-10-31T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	"cd" in general is the command that lets you move around directories. and since mounted drives, in Linux, are simply treated as directories...
2006-10-31T06:04:00.000Z	SB|nblracer	LjL	one more question right now that drive is owned by root, should i change it to my username so, i dont have to move files using sudo through console
2006-10-31T06:07:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	this page (and the paragraph that'll be shown by default specifically) should have some information for giving users access: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions#head-2a64a964ff8833576586c7216a1199f022c505a6
2006-10-31T06:07:00.000Z	LjL	SB|nblracer	don't know if that's doable through the Gnome GUI mounter, as well
