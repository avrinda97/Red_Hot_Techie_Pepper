2008-05-30T00:39:00.000Z	PdUb101		how would i configure each new window i open, opens on top of the rest of the open windows?? as in, if i have xchat open, and open firefox, firefox opens behind xchat
2008-05-30T00:40:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	are you by any chance running compiz ?
2008-05-30T00:40:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	yes i am
2008-05-30T00:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	there's a setting in the "general options" that you might check, i'll look it up, brb
2008-05-30T00:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	check "focus & raise behaviour" section, and please state what's in your "focus prevention windows" line
2008-05-30T00:43:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	very high
2008-05-30T00:44:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	oh i mean any
2008-05-30T00:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	if you want, try setting it to "off" and also state what's in the box right below, should be empty to have no window preventing a newly started one from obscuring it
2008-05-30T00:46:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	looks like that worked! thanks alot!
2008-05-30T00:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	had the same problem, it sounded familiar :)
2008-05-30T01:03:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	that's a tricky one, there's a wallpaper plugin for compiz but you'll have to compile that yourself as it isn't in any of the packages .. and don't forget to turn your present window managers desktop control "off" or it won't work
2008-05-30T01:04:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	any idea where i can find that?
2008-05-30T01:05:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	checking th ebookmarks, brb
2008-05-30T01:05:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	k thanks
2008-05-30T01:08:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	here goes --> http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?s=feacefb9dcb213bcb1b3d95b2e6b9df4&t=8121 .. not sure whether you'll be able to keep desktop icons though, i'm looking into that combo myself, more precies, it's on a rather long to-do list ;) gdluck
2008-05-30T01:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	I would try to 'simulate' desktop icons buy putting them on the compiz widget layer, but that's hardly the same functionality you might be looking for (trying to run a clean-desk as a chaotic isn't easy but trying is fun :p)
2008-05-30T01:15:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	thanks alot, i had multiple desktop wallpapers yesturday through gconfig-editor>apps>nautilus>preferences>show desktop (disable), but i couldn't use the desktop icons.. (no point in that)
2008-05-30T01:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	PdUb101	yes it seems complicated, please report back if you stumble onto anything that works :)
2008-05-30T01:17:00.000Z	PdUb101	glitsj16	i will defintily
