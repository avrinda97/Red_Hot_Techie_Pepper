2010-05-27T05:16:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	i get "bash: !grub2: event not found
2010-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	no-one told you to type that, read the message ubottu just sent you
2010-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	i went to the site provided it says grub2 should have been installed with my ubuntu installation,w hich it wasn't. so i'm at a loss.
2010-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	no it doesn't say that
2010-05-27T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	it gives you instructions on how to recover grub from a livecd onto your system
2010-05-27T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	you've not read the page
2010-05-27T05:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	when ubottu says "mememe please read the link I've sent you in a private message" in clear english, what does that tell you ?
2010-05-27T05:23:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	where in the page ubottu sent you - did it tell you to type "!grub2"
2010-05-27T05:23:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	i am sorry if i mistook that link as the same one someone had just given me and did not read it for what i thought would be a useless "second" time. please have some patience with me
2010-05-27T05:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	don't you dare tell me to have patience with me if you can't be bothered to read links that I'm giving you to help you
2010-05-27T05:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	no-one in this room told you to type "!grub2"
2010-05-27T05:25:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	someone did. i'm sorry if you missed it. and, again, i am SORRY i didn't follow the wiki link which i am now reading. thankyouverymuch
2010-05-27T05:26:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	I've just reviewed the logs of the channel - no-one told you to type !grub2
2010-05-27T05:26:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	that's not the link I gave you, so I'm not interested in what that link says
2010-05-27T05:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	where did I say "type that"
2010-05-27T05:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	that was me triggeing a bot to message you
2010-05-27T05:28:00.000Z	ikonia	mememe	as I've just said, that was me triggering a bot to inform you of the corrrect link
