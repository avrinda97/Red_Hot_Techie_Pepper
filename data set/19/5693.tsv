2008-05-16T00:45:00.000Z	NTpspE	mad_max02	i installed everything it asked me to, Ubuntu works fine, just wine that dosent
2008-05-16T00:45:00.000Z	mad_max02	NTpspE	thats all I can help you atm. I'm out and good luck with ur problem
2008-05-16T00:45:00.000Z	mad_max02	NTpspE	and yeah wine needs properly installed graphic drivers
