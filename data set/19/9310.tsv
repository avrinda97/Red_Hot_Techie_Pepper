2007-02-23T17:29:00.000Z	stork		!fluxbox
2007-02-23T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	stork	are you using gnome?
2007-02-23T17:29:00.000Z	stork	jrib	yeah, gnome
2007-02-23T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	stork	is nautilus managing your desktop (ie you didn't disable it from doing so)?
2007-02-23T17:29:00.000Z	stork	jrib	i think i closed the thing that handles right clicking on background + desktop icons.. how can i restart it?
2007-02-23T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	stork	how?
2007-02-23T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	stork	what does it say when you enter 'nautilus' in a terminal?
2007-03-11T14:51:00.000Z	jrib	stork	man update-rc.d
2007-03-11T14:53:00.000Z	stork	jrib	isn't that for start/stop scripts?
2007-03-11T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	stork	what exactly do you want to do?
2007-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	stork	jrib	execute two commands to start my RAID array on boot up so i can mount it on /home
2007-03-11T14:57:00.000Z	jrib	stork	you can use /etc/init.d/ and udpate-rc.d, you could also add it to /etc/rc.local maybe... I'm not sure when that gets executed though
2007-03-11T14:58:00.000Z	stork	jrib	but then i'd need to implement a stop command right?
2007-03-11T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	stork	I don't think so, see post 8 here http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/
2007-03-11T15:28:00.000Z	stork	jrib	think i got it working, i'll know when i reboot :)
2007-03-18T10:47:00.000Z	jrib	stork	sanityx: you're both offtopic, please take it somewhere else
2008-10-10T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	stork	how did you create the user?
2008-10-10T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	stork	you should use adduser instead
