2006-04-03T06:04:00.000Z	Healot		but I am not clear on how to do this...
2006-04-03T06:05:00.000Z	Healot		good
2006-04-03T06:05:00.000Z	Healot		because I am not familiar with that actually
2006-04-03T06:06:00.000Z	Healot		try compilign with intel's compiler instead :)
2006-04-03T06:07:00.000Z	Healot		sure... it focusing on the dl...
2006-04-03T06:08:00.000Z	Healot		renicing it would be okay... or risky... up to you
2006-04-03T06:09:00.000Z	Healot		read somemore of Vmware documentation
2006-04-03T06:11:00.000Z	Healot		what the hell are you trying to do anyways, kenas?
2006-04-03T06:12:00.000Z	Healot		it's on the dl site, ribbo
2006-04-03T06:13:00.000Z	ribbo	Healot	as I said, I get redirected - wget starts downloading the .iso
2006-04-03T06:13:00.000Z	Healot	ribbo	, click right on the link and save AS?
