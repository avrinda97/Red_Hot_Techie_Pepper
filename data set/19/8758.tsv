2009-05-20T21:14:00.000Z	livingdaylight_		can someone tell me why the laptop gets so hot with ubuntu?
2009-05-20T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	maybe your power managment is working so your fan is not kicking in
2009-05-20T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	"is not" working sorry
2009-05-20T21:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	how can i check that out?
2009-05-20T21:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	suspend works
2009-05-20T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	suspend is not power managment
2009-05-20T21:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	but when i openthe lid and start working after a while i have a microwave in my hands
2009-05-20T21:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	ahh
2009-05-20T21:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	when i go to powermanagement it seems to be where i configure and set suspend and various power saving features
2009-05-20T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	sorry I should be cleary that's "power saving" or profiles, I'm talking about apmd which controls things like fans when your machine is hot
2009-05-20T21:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	any way of fixing that, the heat coming off my laptof is rendering it unusable
2009-05-20T21:21:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	no? i was just looking at my system monitor. at least one of the cpu's is always 100% and i'm not even doing anything, other than irc right now
2009-05-20T21:22:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	look in top at what's using it
2009-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	in top of what?
2009-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	use the command "top"
2009-05-20T21:24:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	firefox it seems
2009-05-20T21:28:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	hi, yea, cpu use is down now and  i don't have a jet engine running sound going on as before
2009-05-20T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	livingdaylight_	great
2009-05-20T21:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	ikonia	should i try another browser?
