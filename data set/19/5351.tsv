2008-09-19T10:41:00.000Z	FAJALOU1		hi my computer has been freezing lately; i checked the memory and everything checks out fine.  i thought it was the gpu overheating, but to no avail seems how it just happened and the gpu temp is low...
2008-09-19T10:42:00.000Z	FAJALOU1		any other thoughts?

2008-09-19T10:48:00.000Z	yigal	FAJALOU1	other than the fact that it looks like your getting hacked, what does alsamixer give you?

2008-09-19T10:49:00.000Z	yigal	FAJALOU1	it looks someone is trying to get in at least
2008-09-19T10:49:00.000Z	yigal	FAJALOU1	but what about alsamixer or amixer for instance?
2008-09-19T10:49:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	yigal	 could it be  to the fact that i have two wifi cards ;) ?
