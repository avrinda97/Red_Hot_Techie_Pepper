2009-10-31T04:36:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	i have sound, it's just too buggy
2009-10-31T04:38:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	so how do i replace it?
2009-10-31T04:40:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	it needs to be fixed in a better way :(
2009-10-31T04:41:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	in Hardy i just switched all the dropdowns in System > Preferences > Sound to ALSA, but they're no longer ther ein Karmic - what's the equivalent?
2009-10-31T04:41:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	yes, problem is that karmic is pretty much pulse centric and there is no easy way to switch it off completely
2009-10-31T04:42:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	so put up or shut up (literally)?
2009-10-31T04:42:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	yeah or force-uninstall pulseaudio :)
2009-10-31T04:42:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	all you lose is the volume control applet and that can be worked around e.g. with alsamixer
2009-10-31T04:42:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	i may have already apt-get removed pulseaudio
2009-10-31T04:44:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	if pulseaudio is removed and my volume control applet is still working is it waiting for a restart?
2009-10-31T04:44:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	yes you can pkill -9 pulse to make sure
2009-10-31T04:45:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	well now that you tell me i can't have the applet i'd rather put up with pulseaudio
2009-10-31T04:45:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	that's what I ended up with as well
2009-10-31T04:46:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	argh, why make half-baked software mandatory
2009-10-31T04:46:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	it's also what I question..
2009-10-31T04:48:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	i suppose you could apply the same question to NotifyOSD and that envelope in the notification area
2009-10-31T04:48:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	yes but at least they just sit there and do little harm
2009-10-31T04:48:00.000Z	KenBW2	th1	apart from make simple operations take more clicks
2009-10-31T05:26:00.000Z	th1	KenBW2	you're better off getting the source for gnome-applets and building it with different configure options
