2011-04-05T02:39:00.000Z	braxton		Is there a 64-bit version of ubuntu?
2011-04-05T02:40:00.000Z	braxton		I am running a 32 bit version, but apparently my computer has a 64 bit width processor.
2011-04-05T02:40:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	yes
2011-04-05T02:43:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	type "free" how much memory does it say total
2011-04-05T02:45:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	what is your question?
2011-04-05T02:46:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	we answered your question now what do you want
2011-04-05T02:47:00.000Z	braxton	hwilde	I would like to have better performance and I think I would like to change to the 64 bit version, but I'm not sure if I should.
2011-04-05T02:47:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	64bit version lets you use more ram.  if you have a 64bit machine then go ahead and try 64bit version and more ram
2011-04-05T02:49:00.000Z	braxton	hwilde	Well, when I divided the total amount of memory I had in top by 1024, I got a non-integer, which is weird.
2011-04-05T02:49:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	you have 3Gigs
2011-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	braxton	hwilde	So switching to 64 bit wouldn't help me at all? That sucks.
2011-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	espeically if your performance is not currently ram-limited.
2011-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	braxton	hwilde	Well, for some reason I can't run minecraft and firefox at the same time.
2011-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	try google-chrome
2011-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	braxton	hwilde	Well, I can, but with severe frame rate cuts in mft.inecra
2011-04-05T02:52:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	get a desktop, get a better video card, duhh
2011-04-05T02:53:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	here is the solution for you:   get a desktop, get a better video card.  end of story bro
2011-04-05T02:53:00.000Z	braxton	hwilde	The problem occurs on chrome too, which now makes me think that the problem isn't related to the browser.
2011-04-05T02:53:00.000Z	hwilde	braxton	minecraft is eating all your video card.
