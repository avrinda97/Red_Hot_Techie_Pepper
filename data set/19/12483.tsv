2005-08-29T10:20:00.000Z	matrix79		ok
2005-08-29T10:22:00.000Z	fl	matrix79	ok, that's a "bondi blue" or rather "blue and white" G3
2005-08-29T10:23:00.000Z	matrix79		so: fl how do we get the ubuntu os to fire up
2005-08-29T10:23:00.000Z	fl	matrix79	this one has "Open Firmware", which you can access at boot with apple+alt+o+f
2005-08-29T10:23:00.000Z	fl	matrix79	ok, that means that you should be using the "yaboot" boot manager
2005-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	fl	matrix79	and, if you put the CD in, and press and hold "c" during the boot, your machine should start from the Ubuntu CD
2005-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	matrix79		so fl: I reboot the machine and hit apple+alt+o+f
2005-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	matrix79		ok
2005-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	fl	matrix79	sorry, type too slow.
2005-08-29T10:25:00.000Z	fl	matrix79	put in the Ubuntu CD, and press and hold "c" during the boot,  your machine should start from the Ubuntu CD
