2006-04-19T10:21:00.000Z	ub0ti		hi, i am getting the NAT error on azureus- i get my connection through a router connected to a cable modem- problem is, i cant connect to the D-link web interface (supposedly the address is 192.168.0.1) - what exactly could the problem be?
2006-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- can you ping 192.168.0.1 ?
2006-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	ub0ti		  (111) Connection refused
2006-04-19T10:23:00.000Z	fredl		junior - install streamtuner (apt-get install streamtuner)
2006-04-19T10:23:00.000Z	ub0ti		lemme check that...i really dont know how to describe the network- all i know is that the DNS address is 10.1.0.1 which is picked up automatically over DNS.
2006-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- you probably can't reach the D-link then since your primary address is probably like 10.x.x.x or something
2006-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	ub0ti		yes, i can ping 192.168.0.1
2006-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- hmm is you can ping it, you should be able to go to the web interface
2006-04-19T10:25:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- try typing in a terminal: telnet 192.168.0.1 80
2006-04-19T10:25:00.000Z	ub0ti		ok..just a sec
2006-04-19T10:25:00.000Z	ub0ti	fredl	connected-
2006-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- well then your browser should be able to connect to, just go to http://192.168.0.1
2006-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	ub0ti	fredl	i added the address to 'dns' names in network-admin...yes, i did that out of desperation- may be thats why i can ping the address, no?
2006-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	ub0ti		i really wissh if i can find a good book on linux networking :(
2006-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- huh? Well take it out of there it shouldn't be there :P
2006-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	fredl		*grin* the things people do :)
2006-04-19T10:29:00.000Z	ub0ti	fredl	yeah, its not there now...but i can still ping 192.168.0.1 and still no web interface- the router's instructions does say that i need to have java enabled...on opera, the java path shows up.
2006-04-19T10:29:00.000Z	fredl		a bug is serious?
2006-04-19T10:30:00.000Z	fredl	ub0ti	- well then install java.
