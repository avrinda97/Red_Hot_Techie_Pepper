2008-11-13T21:05:00.000Z	Jaymac		afternoon all - just upgraded to intrepid on my laptop (sony vaio sz3xwp) and noticed drastically reduced battery life.. running powertop gives me the following: A USB device is active 100.0% of the time:
2008-11-13T21:05:00.000Z	Jaymac		 - I have nothing plugged into my usb ports.. any ideas?
2008-11-13T21:06:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Try running from a LiveCD to see if its the Intrepid upgrade perhaps?
2008-11-13T21:06:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	sorry when I said upgrade, I meant a fresh install :)
2008-11-13T21:07:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Ah. :( Not sure then.
2008-11-13T21:07:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	this is the device: /sys/bus/usb/devices/4-2
2008-11-13T21:10:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Mhm.
2008-11-13T21:11:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Try killing it, filling battery, benchmark life of it.
2008-11-13T21:13:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	I killed bluetooth via the Services tab.. now I'm being told a USB device is active 0.2% of the time :)
2008-11-13T21:13:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	that's a better number
2008-11-13T21:13:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Success? :D
2008-11-13T21:13:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Wonderful then. :)
2008-11-13T21:13:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	nope, it's back again.. damn
2008-11-13T21:14:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	Then have Ubuntu disable/not use it.
2008-11-13T21:14:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	apart from disabling it in services, how do i do that?
2008-11-13T21:15:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	...Hrm, never used BlueTooth so I'm not sure?
2008-11-13T21:24:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	I filed a bug report.. well there already was one so I updated it.. removing btusb solves the problem
2008-11-13T21:25:00.000Z	Yuji1	Jaymac	:) There you go. Problem solved.
2008-11-13T21:25:00.000Z	Jaymac	Yuji1	well disabling bluetooth isn't much of a solution!
