2008-04-25T02:37:00.000Z	tanath	maco	k3b is the best, but if you want cdrecord, it's in the repo too
2008-04-25T02:37:00.000Z	maco	tanath	no its not. it's replaced by wodim.
2011-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	maco	tanath	you can turn off the maximise on screen edge by changing your screen edge bindings in compiz
2011-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	tanath	maco	thanks. i was wondering about that
2011-06-02T02:14:00.000Z	tanath	maco	no reason to think it's a virus. i do suspect rootkit though
2011-06-02T02:11:00.000Z	maco	tanath	if you rename the .wine directory and start with a clean one, the renamed one will be inert in the meantime (since wine will only look for the correctly named one), allowing you to pick through what's good/bad
2011-06-02T02:11:00.000Z	tanath	maco	yeah, and once you have a rootkit you can never be sure of being clean again
2011-06-02T02:12:00.000Z	tanath	maco	i know this. tried that... no good. seems to run any time wine runs
2011-06-02T02:12:00.000Z	tanath	maco	or possibly without wine
2011-06-02T02:12:00.000Z	maco	tanath	oh now thatd be interesting. first to report a new linux malware strain....
2011-06-02T02:13:00.000Z	tanath	maco	'tis certainly possible anyway
2011-06-02T02:13:00.000Z	tanath	maco	i'd rather do something i'm reasonably sure will get rid of stuff. scanning from live disc
2011-06-02T02:13:00.000Z	maco	tanath	well if its a new linux virus, there wouldnt be a definition for it yet....
2011-06-02T02:14:00.000Z	tanath	maco	spybot beta 2 has rootkit stuff and it found stuff in the vm, which is also infected
2011-06-02T02:14:00.000Z	tanath	maco	two things. one of which was MSE rootkit stuff (which i removed in ignorance) and the other unknown
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	tanath	maco	well all detections i've seen thus far have been generic trojan/rootkit stuff
2011-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	tanath	maco	that's what system monitor applet is for
2011-06-02T02:19:00.000Z	tanath	maco	does anyone actually think/claim that?
