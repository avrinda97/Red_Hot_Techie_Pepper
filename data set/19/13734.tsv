2005-02-19T08:00:00.000Z	jirwin		how do I know what device to mount
2005-02-19T08:00:00.000Z	jirwin		i looked at dmesg
2005-02-19T08:01:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	what is it about? a usb-device?
2005-02-19T08:01:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	probably /dev/sda
2005-02-19T08:03:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	have you tried 'mount'? at the cli?
2005-02-19T08:05:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	does it ask for it?
2005-02-19T08:08:00.000Z	jirwin	KlaasVaag	ok, I unplugged all my other devices, and then plugged in the mp3 player by itself, and now it says that /dev/sda doesn't exist
2005-02-19T08:10:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	i have that problem too sometimes.. still dont know what the exact problem is..
2005-02-19T08:11:00.000Z	jirwin	KlaasVaag	if this means anything, when I plug it in I run dmesg, and it tells me "usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using address 5"
2005-02-19T08:12:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	it does mean anything.. at least your device is found..
2005-02-19T08:13:00.000Z	jirwin	KlaasVaag	no neither of them work
2005-02-19T08:15:00.000Z	KlaasVaag	jirwin	have to get some sleep.. its 3am here..
