2005-12-18T16:43:00.000Z	ilba7r		duomaxwell have you tried openbox or fluxbox
2005-12-18T16:44:00.000Z	ilba7r		duomaxwell also for old sys with limited resources daminsmalllinux is good choice too
2005-12-18T16:45:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	yes, I know all about DSL, I tried it on an old 486, but thats x8, I'm trying to use PPC here
2005-12-18T16:51:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	nothing else better to do for one and 2, I kinda blew up the P4
2005-12-18T16:53:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	3rd would be that I can't always switch ppl to Macs, so I figured learn linux, Ubuntu and Linspire whenever I get the PC going again so I can support their switching
2005-12-18T16:54:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	comparing the same os on 2 arcatectures? I'm pretty sre it'd be trasnparent to the user like the difference between IDE and SATA, Intel vs AMD and ATI vs nVidia
2005-12-18T16:57:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	while there may be some difference to the trained geek, I doubt that joe 6 pack will care much so long as he has email and ready access to his free p0rn pix
2005-12-18T16:59:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	TCO? you gotta add the microsoft tax on any store bought PC, that and the tons of useless software they come with, the cost of time securing and teaching joe sixpac about windows security and why he shouldn't open those attachments
2005-12-18T17:01:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	while I'm no programmer I've heard from those who are that MAcs are pretty bad ass when it come to crunching numbers, on a forum like Broadband reports the guys running Macs on that distributed computing app are creaming the guys running anything else
2005-12-18T17:08:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	I wouldn't exspect the store clearks to know anything in the same way I wouldn't trust the car dealer to know one engine from another
2005-12-18T17:09:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	best thing to do is experiment, the apple store is very liberal in what you do, when the G5 came out they let me install every application I had to test them out on it
2005-12-18T17:11:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	I'm not running tiger, only at 10.2.8. I'm a bit of an electronics handyman and thus asked to fix wintels, I've switched a few to Macs, but not all want to buy a new machine. So I figure my best bet is to learn linux so I can teach them
2005-12-18T17:13:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	if you wanna try you're had at the comand line in OS X just open terminal under utilities in the applications folder or you can do it hardcore in single user mode by restarting the Mac and holding command s I think
2005-12-18T17:15:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	that will boot you to just the darwin BSD terminal with no OS X ontop. IBM should be using Macs, they make the G5 chips lol, it's based off their Power4(?) server chips
2005-12-18T06:17:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	its past my bedtime, I'm getting to impatient for doing, well anything lol
2005-12-18T06:20:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	I tried there months ago when I 1st recived an official ShipIt copy of 5.04, noone could figure out why my particular iBook wouldn't see the Ubuntu install CD as a boot volume or why the Live CD would crash halfway into the boot
2005-12-18T06:20:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	I don't have any wireless gear
2005-12-18T06:22:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	OS X is BSD based and theres atleast 25-30 projects that do PPC Linux, Yellow Dog being PPC only
2005-12-18T06:25:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	ilba7r	ok, I'm out. too tired to google for anything else for now
