2011-03-18T06:21:00.000Z	matt___		I don't know where to ask so I figured I'd ask this nice group of smart people. I want to utilize some sort of plugin/web software/etc to automatically sell something via paypal, after payment, automatically reach into a mysql database and email a unique PIN to the purchaser...
2011-03-18T06:23:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	make a php page to do that?
2011-03-18T06:23:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	Well....I was hoping for something already done, but I have been leaning towards just getting started on that. I'm not sure how it'd work verifying with paypal, but I guess that's the fun part;)
2011-03-18T06:25:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	me neither. maybe there's some open source code out there that does the job or similar. good luck!
2011-03-18T06:25:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	Well..I've found a thing or two...but really I'm wanting to get it to work within TomatoCart...this seems to be an awesome piece of stuff right there...
2011-03-18T06:27:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	tomatocart looks neat!
2011-03-18T06:28:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	It is based, I believe, on one of those OS's that runs in an internet browser...and it does everything. IF I can just get this to work, I can use it for my entire webstore. See...the problem with me and custom coding PHP is it will be different than the rest of my webstore....I want to use something like TomatoCart, OScommerce, ecwid, etc.
2011-03-18T06:30:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	Maybe the simplest thing to do would be to setup a "download" of instructions on what to do with the PIN, and then write a bash, etc on my desktop that all I have to do is enter email after email and it will grab the stuff from a mysql and email it from my desktop
2011-03-18T06:32:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	OR if I could have a system that just allows me to upload 500 images, each with a unique pin, and let 1 customer download 1 image after purchase, and then never download that image again....but I like the record keeping ability of mysql
2011-03-18T06:32:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	an OS can't run in an internet browser... but maybe a shell script with some php could do the job!
2011-03-18T06:32:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	http://www.eyeos.org/
2011-03-18T06:52:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	ohhh like a cloud / networked os1
2011-03-18T06:52:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	how exactly does eyeos work anyway?
2011-03-18T06:52:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	isn't it just mainly a cloud storage system?
2011-03-18T06:53:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	Not really sure...it is interesting
2011-03-18T06:53:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	yeah.. hahah
2011-03-18T06:53:00.000Z	matt___	fisix	I assume it is advanced;)
2011-03-18T06:54:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	know anything about penetration testing / network security stuff by any chance?
2011-03-18T06:54:00.000Z	fisix	matt___	haha probably
