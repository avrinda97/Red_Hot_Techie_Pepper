2011-12-25T07:13:00.000Z	schnuffle1	daulity	some peaces are missing. you have PC1-----Ethernet-----PC2---------Wireless/NAT-----Internet? And you want to reach PC1 from the internet?
2011-12-25T07:14:00.000Z	schnuffle1	daulity	There's no way you can rach PC1 one as it shouldn't have a occicial IP, only a private one. You can forward different ports to PC1 if you want

2011-12-25T07:21:00.000Z	schnuffle1	daulity	you mean the --to part? It's ther IP of PC1
2011-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	schnuffle1	daulity	before you change your setup make a backup of it
2011-12-25T07:36:00.000Z	daulity	schnuffle1	uh do i need a crossover cable for this to work?
2011-12-25T07:38:00.000Z	schnuffle1	daulity	no switch between PC1 and PC2? If so a cross connect would be necessary. Most modern PCs should have auto detect
