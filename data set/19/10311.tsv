2006-06-30T08:20:00.000Z	arapehl		Anyone know what repository I need to use to get Google's Picasa through Synaptic?
2006-06-30T08:21:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	yu can
2006-06-30T08:23:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	deb http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/ stable non-free
2006-06-30T08:24:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	You rock man... thanks!
2006-06-30T08:24:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	thank google
2006-06-30T08:24:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	I just figure it would be a lot easier to manage through synaptic than to just install manually... y'know?
2006-06-30T08:33:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	weird man... I just entered "deb http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/ stable non-free" into the apt line and hit "reload" and the app just disappeared (i.e. crashed ... I think)
2006-06-30T08:34:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	did you do it from the command line?
2006-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	You've got to understand, I'm like REALLY really new at this... I hit the "custom" button and there's a field you can enter it into.  That's where I entered it.
2006-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	I guess I can just as easily do it through the terminal huh?
2006-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	have you ever edited a text file on windows?...
2006-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	then gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	I'm in the file now (sudo -s asked for a pw, and I"m not logged in as root... I just hit enter and it brought me back to the prompt... that's okay?)... btw, I'm a noob at Linux (have a bit of knowledge, but just a bit) but I'm not a noob overall..
2006-06-30T08:38:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	heh, the line is in the file already... I guess it added it before it bombed...
2006-06-30T08:38:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	you are the sudo user if you are first user on system
2006-06-30T08:38:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	then do this...  apt-get update
2006-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	your password you use for the sudo user in other words
2006-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	arapehl	you have to sudo apt-get update...
2006-06-30T08:41:00.000Z	arapehl	nomasteryoda	 sh*t! I just found what bombed it... I previously entered only the URL and not "deb ..." so it just breaks when it hits that line
