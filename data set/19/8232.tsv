2007-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	Wymark		I'm not meaning to be a bother, but is anyone going to attempt to hlep me here?
2007-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	aarmenaa	Wymark	what's your question?
2007-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	Wymark		Ok, I try to install Ubuntu and it comes up with this error: Failed to start the X Server. (your graphical interface) It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?
2007-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	Wymark	aarmenaa	I'm using an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200.
2007-04-21T14:04:00.000Z	aarmenaa		This is on the computer you set it up on?  Because usually the only time I see this is when I install Ubuntu on a hard disk and then move it to another system.
2007-04-21T14:04:00.000Z	Wymark		Yes, this the computer I'm setting it up on.
2007-04-21T14:04:00.000Z	aarmenaa		Ok, gimme a sec to figure out the exact command line you need.
2007-04-21T14:05:00.000Z	Wymark		What is that?
2007-04-21T14:05:00.000Z	aarmenaa	Wymark	run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	Wymark		That will fix it?
2007-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	aarmenaa		It will let you reconfigure the xserver to work with your hardware.  You do need to know a bit about your computer.
2007-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	aarmenaa		LIke what resolutions, what driver, etc.
2007-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	Wymark		Ah shite..
2007-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	Wymark		Hmm, ok, so I'll just be doing some research tonight.
2007-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	Wymark		Yes?
2007-04-21T14:07:00.000Z	aarmenaa		Well, most of it's not bad.
2007-04-21T14:07:00.000Z	aarmenaa		It asks for your video driver(which you know - Nvidia), resolutions, refresh rates of your monitor
2007-04-21T14:07:00.000Z	aarmenaa		Go ahead and try and you can always ask in here if you get stuck.
2007-04-21T14:08:00.000Z	Wymark	aarmenaa	Which driver will I need to know about? Video card driver?
