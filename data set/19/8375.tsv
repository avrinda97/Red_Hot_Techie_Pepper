2009-10-24T05:40:00.000Z	True_TBird		Any ideas on HDD Regen?
2009-10-24T05:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	what does HDD Regen do ?
2009-10-24T05:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	chkdsk /R ---> fsck -options /dev/sdxx
2009-10-24T05:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	man e2fsck (to see the options aviable for ext3)
2009-10-24T05:42:00.000Z	True_TBird	erUSUL	Its a bootable CD that doesn't even mount the filesystem and checks for corruptions on the HDD and repairs them
2009-10-24T05:43:00.000Z	True_TBird	erUSUL	but does fsck work with NTFS partitions?
2009-10-24T05:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	no is for linux filesystems. for ntfs is better to use windows native apps
2009-10-24T05:44:00.000Z	True_TBird	erUSUL	I would love to do that, I know how to do it from Windows, but the drive won't boot to the Windows partition
2009-10-24T05:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	the only tool i know is ntfsfix from ntfsprogs but its capabilities are not great
2009-10-24T05:46:00.000Z	True_TBird	erUSUL	The issue is that I am not sure Ubuntu will be able to use the wireless card on this computer, its an old computer and uses a Cardbus wireless card
2009-10-24T05:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	do not think so.
2009-10-24T05:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	but you can run from the installed ubuntu ? the ntfs parition is umounted
2009-10-24T05:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	you can install things in the livecd
2009-10-24T05:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	sudo aptitude install ntfsprogs
2009-10-24T05:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	you are ircing from another computer...
2009-10-24T05:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	save the deb in pendrive ?
2009-10-24T05:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	ntfsprogs should have no hard dependencies
2009-10-24T05:59:00.000Z	True_TBird	erUSUL	Thanks for all the help
2009-10-24T06:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	True_TBird	no problem
