2005-11-01T16:09:00.000Z	kresten		How do I mount a cd-drive from the teminal?
2005-11-01T16:11:00.000Z	kresten		I installed from the drive, but it doesn't auto mount
2005-11-01T16:11:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	cat /etc/fstab and find your cdrom device (if it's detected; it should be there)
2005-11-01T16:12:00.000Z	kresten		Does it make any difference that it is a usb drive?
2005-11-01T16:13:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	tail -f /var/log/messages and plug the USB, it'll show you the device, if not; try tail -f /var/log/dmesg
2005-11-01T16:14:00.000Z	kresten		It shows up under "cat /etc/fstab"
2005-11-01T16:14:00.000Z	kresten		But under options it says " noauto"???
2005-11-01T16:14:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	if it's a CDROM, you can mount it: mount /media/cdrom
2005-11-01T16:15:00.000Z	kresten	boogieman	"/dev/scd0 does not exist"
2005-11-01T16:15:00.000Z	kresten	boogieman	it says...
2005-11-01T16:16:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	tell me, are you trying to mount a IDE CDROM or something else
2005-11-01T16:18:00.000Z	kresten	boogieman	tail gives "localhost kernel: [4367323.146000]  usb 4-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 24"
2005-11-01T16:18:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	vi the file and check that message block; it should give you the device name
2005-11-01T16:19:00.000Z	kresten	boogieman	sorry, I don't understand? (noob)
2005-11-01T16:21:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	edit (vi) your log files (/var/log/messages,dmesg) and search for the device name
2005-11-01T16:21:00.000Z	kresten	boogieman	ok, will do.
2005-11-01T16:22:00.000Z	boogieman	kresten	do this; tail -f /var/log/messages /var/log/dmesg; plug out the USB, and plug it back in .. it should show you the device
