2006-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	propheteer		i tried to apt-get upgrade to dapper, but now my system won't boot.  how can i recover it from this breezy live cd?
2006-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	propheteer		is there any way for me to complete the apt-get upgrade?
2006-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	propheteer		right now, when i boot up, it gets to "detecting pcmcia devices" and freezes.  i don't have a pcmcia device on this machine.
2006-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	boot from livecd, mount your root and then do chroot /therootdir
2006-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	propheteer	snowfaked	awesome
2006-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	you could also try to modify boot parameters
2006-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	add "hw-detect/start_pcmcia=false"
2006-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	(at least it works with debian;)
2006-05-20T06:48:00.000Z	propheteer	snowfaked	it would probably be good to complete the apt-get upgrade first.
2006-05-20T06:49:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	yep, you can do it by booting, mounting the root, chrooting the root and then just typing the apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-05-20T06:49:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	you can install macos on pc also ;)
2006-05-20T06:49:00.000Z	propheteer	snowfaked	how can i list my mountable volumes?  i'm brain dead tired right now.
2006-05-20T06:50:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	fdisk -l shows your partitions
2006-05-20T08:07:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	did you try the line i gave?
2006-05-20T08:08:00.000Z	propheteer	snowfaked	forgot to write it down. sorry.  could you repeat?
2006-05-20T08:08:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	"hw-detect/start_pcmcia=false"
2006-05-20T08:09:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	you could also try to boot from livecd once more and remove pcmcia-package
2006-05-20T08:09:00.000Z	propheteer	snowfaked	now THAT is genius!
2006-05-20T08:10:00.000Z	snowfaked	propheteer	no problem :)
