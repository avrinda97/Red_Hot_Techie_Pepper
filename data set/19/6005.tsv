2008-04-12T22:35:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	system bootable device disabled.
2008-04-12T22:35:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	your pretty much out of luck then...
2008-04-12T22:36:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	i figured.
2008-04-12T22:37:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	i was going to use treucrypt for  the usb drive, but also requires admin right to run
2008-04-12T22:38:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	you can boot puppy or dsl inside of windows using qemu. but i'm not sure that you'll be able to access external usb device. Maybe someone can confirm? Can you mount external hardware in qemu?
2008-04-12T22:40:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	does qemu have to be installed in windows to use or can be run from cd
2008-04-12T22:40:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	no.
2008-04-12T22:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	you would just run an exe which does not require admin rights.
2008-04-12T22:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	it won't install or affect the host machine in anyway
2008-04-12T22:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/qemupuppy/
2008-04-12T22:42:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	this could work
2008-04-12T22:42:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	basic have 2 partition on the usb drive, one with qemu/puppy and the other, luks
2008-04-12T22:43:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	correct.
2008-04-12T22:43:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	the one with qemu/puppy should be vfat
2008-04-12T22:44:00.000Z	cchild	Odd-rationale	i think you just answered my problem. but i have to figure out if qemu will be able to mount the usb drive/partition
2008-04-12T22:45:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	cchild	I'd be interested in trying this myself... why don't you /join #Odd-rationale and we'll discuss it in more detials. afterall, were no longer talking about ubuntu in particualr... :)
