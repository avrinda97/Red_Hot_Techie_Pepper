2008-03-20T03:56:00.000Z	yowshi		tbut maybe try alt+f2 and gksudo nautilus
2008-03-20T03:57:00.000Z	yowshi		same
2008-03-20T03:57:00.000Z	yowshi		yoshi@ubuntu:~$ sudo pcmanfm
2008-03-20T03:57:00.000Z	yowshi		sudo: must be setuid root
2008-03-20T03:58:00.000Z	yowshi		you didnt say whichsudo you just said usr/bin/sudo
2008-03-20T04:00:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	.... you have to use chown the sudo binary as root:root in rescue mode ...
2008-03-20T04:01:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	you have to be root ... thus a reboot into rescue is needed
2008-03-20T04:12:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	no, it's a ;
2008-03-20T04:17:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	you can use irssi in the recovery mode and then do it :-)
2008-03-26T01:47:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	he meant if the install you're on is in japanese .. if it's an english install you can use man fstab to read an english manual.
2008-03-26T01:47:00.000Z	yowshi	hischild	no i was making a point that amenado seems to be telling me to go read the man pages until i understand the terms in it. even though i dont understand the terms in the man pages
2008-03-26T01:48:00.000Z	yowshi	hischild	 in other words my only manual may as well be in japanese and he is telling me to read it until i know japanese
2008-03-26T01:48:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	if you ask us what the terms mean we can explain them. However we can't hold your hand and do it every step by the way.
2008-03-26T01:49:00.000Z	yowshi	hischild	amenado frag this thank you for providing an example of the futility of comming here
2008-03-26T03:27:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	you can insult us all you like. Both of us have offered to help you with terms you didn't understand, help which you refused.
2008-03-26T03:28:00.000Z	yowshi	hischild	you guys didnt offer to help. ylou told me to go fuck off and read a manual
2008-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	i offered you to explain any terms you didn't understand. You did _NOT_ come back to me with any questions after that. I have no idea what your problem is with me, but i'm not going to continue this discussion.
2008-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	yowshi	hischild	i dont NEED to know what utf-8 is do i? nor do i care what half the terms mean because they aint relevant to what i need. so blasting me with more irrelevant information ISNT going to help
2008-03-26T03:30:00.000Z	hischild	yowshi	as i said: i am not going to continue this discussion.
