2009-06-06T05:11:00.000Z	ewsubach		does browsing the internet generate incoming UDP packets? if so, on what ports?
2009-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	yes, tcpip runs on udp... sort of
2009-06-06T05:14:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	i want to only allow UDP through firewall on ports that browsing internet would need. do you know which ones I need to leave open?
2009-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	which ever ports are used, UDP is like TCPIP, not like http, so all ports are possbly the right one
2009-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	I have no idea. i'm using firefox, but it should only be using tcp! as soon as i disable any udp i get no connectivity to the internet
2009-06-06T05:19:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	OK if you have open the UDP to get TCP to work, so if you want access to the machine open TCP:80 and UDP:80... if you want to allow for a udp based torrent to work, only UDP, opening TCP only permits one way access. I forget which way
2009-06-06T05:20:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	thanks, i'll give that a try
2009-06-06T05:30:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	found out what it was. i thought udp for http came in on 53, but it actually goes out on 53 to a random port.
2009-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	thats your dns port, you may want to turn that off, mine is, you just need an internal dns server, that has nothing to do with udp
2009-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	what do you mean by an internal dns server, like BIND?
2009-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	thats what I use
2009-06-06T05:35:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	so BIND does the host lookups? from what i've read i don't really know what bind does
2009-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	my bind server has external dns server IPs, so from thoes IP adresses
2009-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	so you contact the bind server, which in turn contacts the dns servers, which respond back to bind, and bind reports it back to the service being used?
2009-06-06T05:40:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	it only needs one hit to get more remember
2009-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	what advantage is there to having it? why downside is there to the method it use? is it just the caching part?
2009-06-06T05:42:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	it depends on what your network needs are
2009-06-06T05:42:00.000Z	ewsubach	brig	don't think i need it, but thanks for the info. i'm glad I got my problem sorted out :)
2009-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	brig	ewsubach	cool
