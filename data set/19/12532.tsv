2005-09-12T08:46:00.000Z	omp342		the only thing gentoo is better at than ubuntu is ati drivers
2005-09-12T08:46:00.000Z	omp342		in gentoo i get ~4500 glxgears while in ubuntu i only get ~3500
2005-09-12T08:46:00.000Z	omp342		oh well :)
2005-09-12T08:47:00.000Z	omp342		what's a good mp3 player?
2005-09-12T08:47:00.000Z	omp342		xmms?
2005-09-12T08:48:00.000Z	aru	omp342	depends if you want just a simple program or something to library and take up your whole screen :)
2005-09-12T08:49:00.000Z	omp342	aru	all i need is a simple player because i don't like keeping playlists
2005-09-12T08:49:00.000Z	aru		for me, I'm not really looking at my OGG player unless I'm loading a song... so xmms or beep it is
2005-09-12T08:49:00.000Z	omp342	aru	i just have VERY organized folders :)
2005-09-12T08:49:00.000Z	aru	omp342	as do I... BMP or Beep Media Player would suit you fine :)
2005-09-12T08:50:00.000Z	aru	omp342	it's a lot like winamp 3
2005-09-12T08:50:00.000Z	omp342		i like winamp 2 the most :P
2005-09-12T08:50:00.000Z	aru	omp342	you'll probably feel right at home with BMP
2005-09-12T08:51:00.000Z	omp342	aru	okay, thanks :)
