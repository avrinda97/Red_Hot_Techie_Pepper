2010-09-17T11:29:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	did the problem start after installing the drivers?
2010-09-17T11:30:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	the farthest i got on that problem before uninstalling linux mint xfce and installing xubuntu was
2010-09-17T11:31:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	do an fdisk -l in the terminal to find your linux partition
2010-09-17T11:31:00.000Z	sas	elementzero	it means nothing could be done
2010-09-17T11:31:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	then do mount /dev/<your partition> <path to some random folder>
2010-09-17T11:33:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	anyways, mount your linux partition to some folder, browse to that folder, and then browse to etc/X11/ and open up xorg.conf
2010-09-17T11:33:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	change whatever "nvidia" to "vesa", i think
2010-09-17T11:33:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	open up /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-09-17T11:39:00.000Z	sas	elementzero	yes I managed to find that file and clicked it open, what next
2010-09-17T11:39:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	what's in it?
2010-09-17T11:39:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	is there's a line for "nvidia", change it to "vesa", i think
2010-09-17T11:42:00.000Z	sas	elementzero	I have that xorg.conf read only file open!
2010-09-17T11:42:00.000Z	elementzero	sas	does it say "nvidia" anywhere?
