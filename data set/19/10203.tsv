2007-02-21T06:13:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	grub remaps your drives to its own names
2007-02-21T06:14:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	you can look at /boot/grub/device.map (or something like that) to see what your drive is called in grub
2007-02-21T06:14:00.000Z	Dimensions	verbose	 if its not installed how can it tell me which one is mine ? ...
2007-02-21T06:15:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	what are you trying to boot? are you running off the cd currently?
2007-02-21T06:17:00.000Z	Dimensions	verbose	 yeah ... im on live cd ... and trying to install on sda flash drive ...
2007-02-21T06:19:00.000Z	Dimensions	verbose	 if i remove my flash drive both goes away ... if i do fdisk for them sda starts from sector 63 while sdb is 1 till 62 ...
2007-02-21T06:19:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	that's not right, it should be sda1 and sda2 for 2 partitions, not sda and sdb
2007-02-21T06:20:00.000Z	Dimensions	verbose	 normally there are no partitions on flash drive ... sda is whole disk and sdb is always with it having start of disk ...

2007-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	how about, unplug the drive then plug it back in and do `dmesg|tail`
2007-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	Dimensions	verbose	 sdb doesn't mount to any where but its in /dev only comes when i plug flash drive ...
2007-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	did you repartition the drive and put a linux fs on it?
2007-02-21T06:23:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	try to fdisk it again and remove all partitions
2007-02-21T06:26:00.000Z	verbose	Dimensions	did you unplug and replug it and see what dmesg said?
