2007-10-01T13:03:00.000Z	Fishscene		How do I navigate to the administrator desktop. I've tried using "cd .." which brings me to the home directory, but I can't seem to get anywhere else
2007-10-01T13:04:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	root's home?
2007-10-01T13:04:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	/root I think
2007-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	well, this is Linux, so we call it root :)
2007-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	/root is it
2007-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	are you trying to login as root? if so, please read the link here
2007-10-01T13:06:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	there's absolutely no reason to
2007-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	what 3rd party software? does sudo not do it for you?
2007-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	and I don't believe you can login as root anyway, unless you set the root pass?
2007-10-01T13:10:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	please read the link I gave you, it explains the Linux concept of security :)
2007-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	i guess you're still in /root, so cd ~/Desktop
2007-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	Linux is case sensitive
2007-10-01T13:13:00.000Z	scguy318	Fishscene	San Francisco you are from? cool
