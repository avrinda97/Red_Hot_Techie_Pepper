2009-04-06T12:08:00.000Z	Mocs		Greetings all... having some problems getting DNS to work on new install of 8.4 server... tried the forums, anyone care to lend a hand?
2009-04-06T12:10:00.000Z	Mocs		Anyone able to help with a DNS issue?
2009-04-06T12:11:00.000Z	Mocs		sheesh... I'm talking to a bot...
2009-04-06T12:12:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	You didn't ask a question.  All you said is "It doesn't work, can I ask?"
2009-04-06T12:12:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	You'd want to explain in what manner it fails to work.
2009-04-06T12:12:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	oh, sorry... can anyone help me figure out why DNS isn't resolving?
2009-04-06T12:12:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	I can access by IP, no resolution on names
2009-04-06T12:13:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	What is the nature of your internet supplier?
2009-04-06T12:13:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	cable modem, comcast, but I tried to switch to opendns and it still isn't resolving
2009-04-06T12:14:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	how did you switch?
2009-04-06T12:14:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	followed the forums, changed /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2009-04-06T12:15:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	after you get your internet running, check if /etc/resolv.conf looks good
2009-04-06T12:16:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	net is running fine, can ping by ip
2009-04-06T12:17:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf was set to the router, so I tried changing that to the first ip of opendns... that didn't work either
2009-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	Normally the router supplied by comcast would perform dhcp server.
2009-04-06T12:21:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	it is... for windows... for ubuntu I am getting no joy... dhcp is giving me a good ip, just no DNS
2009-04-06T12:22:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	Ok, so you know your router (192.168.1.1) is functional as a nameserver, so the problem is your ubuntu isn't using it properly.
2009-04-06T12:22:00.000Z	Mocs	doleyb	ayup... taht is about the size of it
2009-04-06T12:23:00.000Z	doleyb	Mocs	if it can't get fixed here, maybe #networking will aid you.
