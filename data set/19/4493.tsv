2009-02-17T16:43:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	I'm familiar with aMsn and can spank it's coders, what's the issue?
2009-02-17T16:43:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	As soon as I try to send a soundclip it gives me a reeeally annoying distortion
2009-02-17T16:45:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	send? when you send soundclip it shouldn't be playing it really
2009-02-17T16:45:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	Oh it doesn't, it's just when I play it up myself, or the reciever clicks it, it's like, my voice and a distinct "I just shoved the mic into the spinning fan" kind of sound
2009-02-17T16:46:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	and what is your default mediaplayer that aMsn tries to invoke?
2009-02-17T16:46:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	Good question, I have no clue :P
2009-02-17T16:50:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	How do I check ?
2009-02-17T16:51:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	let me have a look, moment
2009-02-17T16:53:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	hit Ctrl-P
2009-02-17T16:53:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	go to "other" tab
2009-02-17T16:54:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	look at sound server settings
2009-02-17T16:54:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	by default it uses aplay which probably sucks ass :)
2009-02-17T16:55:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	aplay $sound  is what it says
2009-02-17T16:57:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	 So what should I change to?
2009-02-17T16:59:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	hmm, could try that built-in tcl library to see if it will help any
2009-02-17T16:59:00.000Z	nagatzul	Favorit	It didn't
2009-02-17T17:00:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	to be honest with all due respect to Alvaro, TCL isn't the best language to write msn in ;)
2009-02-17T17:00:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	and if you type "aplay <thatfile.mp3>" or whatever you try to play in amsn, does it sound ok, or also with distortion?
2009-02-17T17:01:00.000Z	Favorit	nagatzul	i.e. type that in shell, not in amsn
