2012-10-21T16:31:00.000Z	theadmin	mongi	It's built-in and is called networkmanager ;) Wireless -> New -> Shared
2012-10-21T16:32:00.000Z	mongi	theadmin	but I was looking in google, it seems the one built-in can only share a wired internet trought the wi-fi...
2012-10-21T16:32:00.000Z	mongi	theadmin	is that correct?
2012-10-21T16:32:00.000Z	theadmin	mongi	Well you can't have the same device working both as the receiver and the broadcaster.
2012-10-21T16:32:00.000Z	theadmin	mongi	So yes, that's right, I'm not sure if you'll find anything that can
