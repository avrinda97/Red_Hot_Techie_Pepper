2009-01-03T22:50:00.000Z	powertool08		How do I kill an unkillable process? Even kill -9 isn't working
2009-01-03T22:50:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	tried "sudo pkill NAME" and "sudo xkill"
2009-01-03T22:52:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	Neither worked
2009-01-03T22:53:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	What is that application ?
2009-01-03T22:54:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	convert, I was going to convert a jpeg to png but the file is read only and I guess copyrighted so it crashed
2009-01-03T22:55:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	So, What is the app you want to kill ?
2009-01-03T22:55:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	its called "convert"
2009-01-03T22:56:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	do: "ps -aux | grep "convert"
2009-01-03T22:57:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	1000     15553  0.3  0.3  10392  3620 ?        D    11:10   0:08 convert /media/cdrom1/Pictures/a3.jpg /media/cdrom1/Pictures/a3.png
2009-01-03T22:58:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	I tried sudo kill -9 15553 without success
2009-01-03T22:58:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	"kill 15553"
2009-01-03T23:05:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	"killall convert"
2009-01-03T23:05:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	"killall -9 convert"
2009-01-03T23:06:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	"no process killed"
2009-01-03T23:07:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	"killall -9 *convert*", don't think * works but try
2009-01-03T23:10:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	n8tuser I used a paperclip to force the cd out, still can't kill it, I think a logout is the only answer
2009-01-03T23:11:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	may be "logout" the easiest answer, but i think there's a way to do that
2009-01-03T23:11:00.000Z	powertool08	abuyusuf_	A way to do what? Kill it?
2009-01-03T23:12:00.000Z	abuyusuf_	powertool08	yes, but i don't remember
