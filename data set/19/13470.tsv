2005-03-29T11:52:00.000Z	jason	tullinga	what wireless card?
2005-03-29T11:52:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	dwl-122, usb stick
2005-03-29T11:52:00.000Z	jason	tullinga	I got hostap to work dont think it supports usb
2005-03-29T11:53:00.000Z	jason	tullinga	i think if you download the kernel sources
2005-03-29T11:53:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	I did download the kernel source. But I dont know enough to compile the stuff or whatevere I need to do
2005-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	sorry did not get the last thing there
2005-03-29T11:59:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	yes it is
2005-03-29T12:00:00.000Z	jason	tullinga	I had troubles with both hostap and wlan-ng
2005-03-29T12:00:00.000Z	jason	tullinga	the method I stated worked for hostap
2005-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	jason	tullinga	you just need to have compiled the sources to build against
2005-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	i guess. but Im stumbling into so many errors and stuff its easy to give up.
2005-03-29T12:05:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	you mean I dont need the kernel for installing wlan-ng or?
2005-03-29T12:06:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	which means?
2005-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	ok. But the problem I get is happening when I do make config for the wlan-ng. during installation I get the error I pasted earlier
2005-03-29T12:12:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	the preview version. 5.04
2005-03-29T12:14:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	problem is I am in macos x now. I only have a wireless connection and need to reboot into ubuntu to do that. I have kernel version 2.6.10-4
2005-03-29T12:17:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	do that or not that?
2005-03-29T12:17:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	, got it
2005-03-29T12:18:00.000Z	tullinga	jason	yes it would be ppc. I will try it. back in an hour then :)
