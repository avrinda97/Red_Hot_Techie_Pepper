2011-12-03T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	the sevenmachines ppa is dead as 64bit flash is in the partner repo
2011-12-03T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	enable partner and install adobe-installer and you will get 64bit flash
2011-12-03T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	Adobe flash is Adobe flash, its proprietary
2011-12-03T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	sure, gnash, lightspark, swfdeck player
2011-12-03T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	lightspark isn't in the default repos
2011-12-03T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/12/flash-alternative-lightspark-0-4-5-released/
2011-12-03T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	in software, nothing is certain :)
2011-12-03T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	you can download the compressed archive for 64bit and copy the file to your browsers plugins directory
2011-12-03T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	the ppa is dead as the packages it gave are now given in the partner repo, so its a pointless ppa
2011-12-03T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	you can grab the 64bit compressed file, extract it and copy the libflashplayer.so (or watever its called) to your browser's plugins folder
2011-12-03T15:15:00.000Z	nicknefarious	ActionParsnip	Do I need to do anything with the other folders in the downloaded archive? Or just move libflashplayer to plug ins folders?
2011-12-03T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	you only need the plugin file, the rest is not needed
2011-12-03T15:18:00.000Z	nicknefarious	ActionParsnip	Can you tell me the specific folder in which it should be placed? The one the others will link to?
2011-12-03T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	which browser(s) do you use?
2011-12-03T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	most likely /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins
2011-12-03T15:21:00.000Z	nicknefarious	ActionParsnip	will that cover chrome and chromium - both are installed
2011-12-03T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	I don't use chrome, but I imagine it;s the same bag
2011-12-03T15:34:00.000Z	nicknefarious	ActionParsnip	Works for Chromium but not Chrome... any other ideas where I can find chrome folders?
2011-12-03T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicknefarious	as I said, I don't use the browser
