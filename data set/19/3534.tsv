2009-08-24T01:12:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	: small?? you can zoom it right?
2009-08-24T01:13:00.000Z	zvacet	apoleo12	: yes,sorry on disc 2 you have extended partition what are you trying to do with it
2009-08-24T01:15:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	Ok firstly I just want to know would that be pointed at (hd2,0) or (hd2,4)?
2009-08-24T01:15:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	the reason why im trying to figure out is to repair my grub problem
2009-08-24T01:17:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	and Ive been fiddling with menu.lst at no avail. I did searching for this but nothing seem to help or I must be overlooking soemthing
2009-08-24T01:17:00.000Z	zvacet	apoleo12	: I believe it will be (hd1,o)
2009-08-24T01:18:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	I thought so.... so now could you please see http://paste.ubuntu.com/258242/ what am I doing wrong?

2009-08-24T01:19:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	Hold on a second why is it (hd1,0) while linix is on hd2?
2009-08-24T01:21:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	 yeah I did folowed that thread but I keep getting incorrected errors
2009-08-24T01:21:00.000Z	zvacet	apoleo12	: sorry I was wrong you are refering to the 3th disc and then it is hda2
2009-08-24T01:22:00.000Z	zvacet	apoleo12	: just a min
2009-08-24T01:22:00.000Z	apoleo12	zvacet	so it would be (hd2,0) then? I just have to be sure because it keeps rebooting even I had it commented out in menu.lst
