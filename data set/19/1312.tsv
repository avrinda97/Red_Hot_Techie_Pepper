2011-06-29T14:26:00.000Z	bobweaver		hi there I would like to learn about the find command
2011-06-29T14:26:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	man find
2011-06-29T14:28:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	What exactly are you trying to do?
2011-06-29T14:32:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	find test -name 123456
2011-06-29T14:33:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	what if I want it to go up or down one number ? can I do that ?
2011-06-29T14:34:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	find test -name "12345[4-6]"
2011-06-29T14:35:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	Thank you you are awesom just the [] and what are the "" for
2011-06-29T14:35:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	what if I did not use the ""
2011-06-29T14:36:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	I could have used the "" in the first example too. It's safer to avoid any parsing of reserved chars by the shell.
2011-06-29T14:37:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	thanks you so much brb
2011-06-29T14:37:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	If you don't put the brackets in quotes your shell will try to expand the pattern itself.
2011-06-29T15:28:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	do you ever use Elinks in the terminal ?
2011-06-29T15:28:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	I did once. Why?
2011-06-29T15:29:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	I thought  you all where talking about webbrowser in bash is that one ?
2011-06-29T15:29:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	Yes, but we didn't ;-)
2011-06-29T15:31:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	is there a list of things that I should learn about bash regexp and what not is there a list that I should follow to learn more
2011-06-29T15:32:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	There's a list of punctuation characters that comes handy sometimes.
2011-06-29T15:35:00.000Z	vlt	bobweaver	I learned regexp from the PCRE documentation. Google for "perl regular expressions"
2011-06-29T15:36:00.000Z	bobweaver	vlt	I downloaded the cbt cource before I started linux 8months ago and it is for red hat and I like the the ubuntu family so some things do not work
