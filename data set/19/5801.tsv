2008-05-28T04:05:00.000Z	babolat		Is there a way in Ubuntu to determine which video driver I need to download without having to take out the card and look at the model number?
2008-05-28T04:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	envyng works on many ati and nvidia cards
2008-05-28T04:06:00.000Z	babolat	Jack_Sparrow	usser: X Window has been crashing since after some update. I don't know how to start fising it.
2008-05-28T04:07:00.000Z	babolat	Jack_Sparrow	what does envy do?
2008-05-28T04:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	HAve you changed any repos or added software manually etc..?  Just trying to figure out where it went wrong
2008-05-28T04:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	tries to get the right driver installed fr you
2008-05-28T04:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	I dont have the time needed to walk you through that.. someone will be able to help
2008-06-15T18:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	they are unlikely to have the same exact number of cylinders.. sudo fdisk -l   and compare to your drive specs
2008-06-15T18:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	You should also be able to see in post on boot which one is where in your setup
2008-06-15T18:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	Get the specs on your drive.. it isnt hard to do
2008-06-15T18:58:00.000Z	babolat	Jack_Sparrow	i was just wondering if i could find out which is which without having to reboot :)
2008-06-15T18:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	No, I dont know of any command that will tell you.
2008-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	as I said.. look at all of fdisk -l   the one you posted is not complets...  look up the specs on your drives and compare number of cyl heads etc
2008-06-15T19:01:00.000Z	babolat	Jack_Sparrow	it would be helpful if that particular function was included in Ubuntu right? if some joe didnt have his screwdriver handy, it'd be quite the hassle :)
2008-06-15T19:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	It could be figured out in less time than you have spent asking us
2008-06-15T19:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	If you had vbox or something you could run everest etc..
2008-06-15T19:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	babolat	You also have not done much to help us in getting you the naswer, like posting the full fdisk  or posting the make and model of your drives
2008-06-15T19:04:00.000Z	babolat	Jack_Sparrow	as i've said, i did_not_intend_it_as_a_slight to ubuntu. i was just saying, so there's no need for the lip
