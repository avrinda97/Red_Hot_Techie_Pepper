2007-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	the client will tell you how many seeds and peers
2007-08-08T10:51:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	i am trying to download a soundtrack file says 4 seeders
2007-08-08T10:54:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	mencoder or one of its front ends
2007-08-08T10:56:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	mencoder? never heard of it, is it torrent or firewall utility?
2007-08-08T10:57:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	A/V encoding utility
2007-08-08T10:58:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	im missing how it applies to solving my issue
2007-08-08T11:00:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	i must have misreplied to someone else.. someone was asking about cutting an mp3
2007-08-08T11:01:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	ahhhhh, i was starting to feel stupid for a second :P
2007-08-08T11:02:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	you having trouble with bittorrent?
2007-08-08T11:02:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	yeah
2007-08-08T11:02:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	gotta make sure you have static address and forward the right ports
2007-08-08T11:02:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	assuming you have a router with NAT
2007-08-08T11:02:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	no, modem to server to router to wifi to laptop
2007-08-08T11:03:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	i masq through a nix server
2007-08-08T11:03:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	oh, so all you should have to do is set up the server's firewall - I think
2007-08-08T11:04:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	you can't find the port your client is using?
2007-08-08T11:04:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	i log the firewall really heavy, level 7 on unknown input
2007-08-08T11:05:00.000Z	lockd	bobsumbody	do a port check on something like whatsmyip.com/ports
2007-08-08T11:06:00.000Z	bobsumbody	lockd	yeah i know that guy @ whatsmyip.org, he's got good toolz
