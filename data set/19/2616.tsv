2010-02-17T05:20:00.000Z	fsplinter		The one that's not showing up, I just unplugged and plugged back in. Dmesg reports nothing.
2010-02-17T05:21:00.000Z	fsplinter		Tell me this, is any running 8.04, has USB audio, a USB printer, and storage devices work fine for them?
2010-02-17T05:21:00.000Z	fsplinter		*anyone
2010-02-17T05:23:00.000Z	fsplinter		Hey, what can I do to troubleshoot a USB device not appearing with lsusb?
2010-02-17T05:24:00.000Z	fsplinter		Never happened to anyone here? :-)
2010-02-17T05:25:00.000Z	fsplinter		Got nothing from dmesg
2010-02-17T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 only when ive had bad usb devices/cables/ports
2010-02-17T05:27:00.000Z	fsplinter	Dr_Willis	thanks for at least responding, I'm completely stumped, but the hardware is good. I used both drives at work a little earlier. Only possiblility is a bad usb controller
2010-02-17T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 witht usb drives ive seen where it takes dmesg a few seconds to see it. run dmesg, wait about 10 sec.. run it again.. and see.. but that dot sound like your issue
2010-02-17T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 see if 'sudo fdisk -l' sees the device
2010-02-17T05:30:00.000Z	fsplinter	Dr_Willis	yea I did that too, I said the steps I've already take a couple minutes ago, but fdisk reports that it can't read the device (on one drive, I've got two that don't work; one visible with lsusb, the other not)
2010-02-17T05:30:00.000Z	fsplinter	Dr_Willis	not being snooty. just, if you want to see, the steps already taken are above.
2010-02-17T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 this is when i normally try the gizmo in a 2nd pc i got next to me. :)
2010-02-17T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 this is a usb flash drive or a usb hard drive?
2010-02-17T05:32:00.000Z	fsplinter	Dr_Willis	I really appreciate your help, because you've been more responsive than anyone else, but I know the hardware is good. Was using the same drives, not an hour ago.
2010-02-17T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 using the same drive in a differnt machine?  Ive had hard drives go bad while in use.
2010-02-17T05:33:00.000Z	fsplinter	Dr_Willis	it's a possibility, but a slim one I think. Theres two drives I'm trying to connect, and both were working on another machine. Maybe there are additional logs I can check, that I'm not aware of?
2010-02-17T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fsplinter	 not really noticed any other then dmesg. If thers any othe rlogs they would be in  /var/logs somewhere
2010-02-17T05:35:00.000Z	fsplinter	Dr_Willis	Well, I'm tired of messing with for now, but thank you again for trying to help
