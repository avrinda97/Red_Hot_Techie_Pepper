2011-04-06T18:51:00.000Z	cheryl		Could someone please help me get my printer working in Karmic??
2011-04-06T18:51:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	if it's working, it's all good
2011-04-06T18:52:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	It's not printing anything, so no, it's not working
2011-04-06T18:52:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	cups is boss
2011-04-06T18:52:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	127.0.0.1:631
2011-04-06T18:53:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	You mistook me for someone with more knowledge than I have!!
2011-04-06T18:53:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	The only cups I know are in my kitchen lol
2011-04-06T18:53:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	.. if you haven't already done, i suggest you install cups : 'sudo apt-get install cups'
2011-04-06T18:54:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	then on a browser, you set it up using http://127.0.0.1:631 (you'll need root password)
2011-04-06T18:55:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	the apt-get didn't work, cups may already be installed, just dunno how to use 'em.
2011-04-06T18:56:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	if cup is install it should ask for a password when you try to open this web page 127.0.0.1:631
2011-04-06T18:57:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	No it didn't, but there was some sort of problem when I ran the sudo apt-get install cups command
2011-04-06T18:59:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	sort of.. :) .. you may ask .. well litteraly command should be : 'sudo apt-get install cups'.
2011-04-06T18:59:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	if something goes wrong either you tell us the exact reply.. / output or you ask ubuntu affiliates.. i don't use ubuntu
2011-04-06T19:00:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	You don't want me to paste the error here, wot's the link for that please?
2011-04-06T19:01:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	Then I can give you the output I got running sudo-apt get install cups
2011-04-06T19:02:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	error message, only if it is not that big.. otherwise.. cutandpaste.org might be the right place
2011-04-06T19:04:00.000Z	cheryl	pmo5	I will try a few things 'n return later when it's quieter, thanks for your help. Will also try 'n get in touch with a friend using Ubuntu!
2011-04-06T19:04:00.000Z	pmo5	cheryl	cheers ;-)
