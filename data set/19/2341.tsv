2010-04-30T19:43:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	I know. But, if you remove nouveau, first, it is supposed to work.
2010-04-30T19:43:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	No, there is a newer version, as of this morning.
2010-04-30T19:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	did not know that
2010-04-30T19:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	still doubt it will work on Lucid though
2010-04-30T19:44:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	195.36.24
2010-04-30T19:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	and here i am running .15 which works?  Latest isn't always greatest guys.  But best of luck lukus, hope you find a fix (it may not be easy)
2010-04-30T19:46:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	Supposedly, the new driver supports some of the newer cards and also VDPAU acceleration.
2010-04-30T19:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	i have vpdau running just fine here
2010-04-30T19:47:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	Tell me how I can tell.
2010-04-30T19:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	the newer cards might be a good thing though!  I get it will show up in repo or the vpdau ppa soon enough

2010-04-30T19:49:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	Ok, now I get it.
2010-04-30T19:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	do you want vdpau support?
2010-04-30T19:49:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	I'm not even sure what it is.
2010-04-30T19:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ratcheer	it's 3d acceleration on nvidia cards for video files
2010-04-30T19:50:00.000Z	ratcheer	ZykoticK9	For, like, video games?
