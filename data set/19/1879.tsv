2011-04-17T00:43:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	I just got here. Whats the question?
2011-04-17T00:44:00.000Z	erealz	joshmc	nothing major i was watching a video on you tube  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqysa6oq80o how to split a terminal window
2011-04-17T00:47:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	consider byobu too, a wrapper for screen, which simplifies the window stuff by putting most of it on the F-keys. as for split windows, lemme work on that for a second.
2011-04-17T00:50:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	for the split use 'Ctrl+a shft+s' of course, but cycle to it with 'ctrl+a ctrl+i'
2011-04-17T00:51:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	switch panes with "ctrl+a ctrl+i" after that.
2011-04-17T00:58:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	did you try tmux or byobu?
2011-04-17T00:59:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	if you want to use a terminal multiplexer either one of those will suffice. byobu is built on screen as it is.
2011-04-17T00:59:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	they are both in repos :) just a sudo apt-get install away.
2011-04-17T01:01:00.000Z	joshmc	erealz	we all gotta learn! dont beat yourself up.
