2007-03-17T12:41:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	good luck. It's a neat environment,. To install it, type "sudo apt-get kubuntu-desktop" -- that's the easy way, anyhow.
2007-03-17T12:41:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	correction
2007-03-17T12:42:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	"sudo apt-get install kde-desktop" -- for got to put install in there. =D
2007-03-17T12:43:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	depending on your machine, it could take minutes or hours.
2007-03-17T12:44:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	it's likely to take awhile.
2007-03-17T12:53:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	don't ask the same questio over and over either. If somebody in the room was able to help you, they would have responded.
2007-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	if nobody can help you here, it's a good idea to check the archives of the Ubuntu Forums and make a new post if you don't find anything helpful.
2007-03-17T13:08:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	it's nice to see that the difficulties aren't turning you off. Keep at it!
2007-03-21T11:42:00.000Z	PirateHead	Andeh	no viruses, fine control over running environment and program choices, untied to corporate interests, the Bazaar development style ("release early, release often").
