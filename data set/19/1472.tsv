2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	inashdeen		anyone else on the sms through usb modem?
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	you need a mobile network provider for that
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	inashdeen	ikonia	: the modem is with a network provider. here's the prob. i used prepaid internet sim card on my usb modem. so when i want to recharge, i need to send an empty sms let say to 555. so how do i do that, since in windows, u can do it through the modem manager thingy
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	the modem should provide linux software to do this
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	if not contact the modem provider for it
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	inashdeen	ikonia	: too bad they dont, when i when to the office that day, they dont even know what's a linux :9
2011-12-06T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	ubuntu-tweak is not something I'd recommend
2011-12-06T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	you just remove the files you no longer want/need using the file manager
2011-12-06T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	what's in that directory
2011-12-06T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	are they taking up space ?
2011-12-06T15:45:00.000Z	inashdeen	ikonia	: not taking up space really , but i want my system to be smaller :)
2011-12-06T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	how much space would you get removing those files ?
2011-12-06T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	ok, so empathy is built into the unity desktop, do you really want to save 1MB of space that bad ?
2011-12-06T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	try removing the empathy package from the package manager, it should remove those files if they are not needed
2011-12-16T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	in what respect ?
2011-12-16T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	in what respect that, UPS is "uniterupted power supply"
2011-12-16T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	but if you give context we can be a bit more clear
2011-12-18T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	inashdeen	please don't advertise in this cahnnel
