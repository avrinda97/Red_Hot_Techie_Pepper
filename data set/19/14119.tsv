2005-01-07T16:01:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	why did you break the safety of your system with a root pw ?
2005-01-07T16:02:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	sudo -s
2005-01-07T16:04:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	you are wrong, there is _no_ root pw
2005-01-07T16:41:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	thats nothing new in here ;)
2005-04-26T11:27:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	breezy wont be usable in the nest weeks...
2005-04-26T11:27:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	there is not even half of it compiled on the buildd's
2005-04-26T13:00:00.000Z	Zotnix	ogra	You said Breezy won't be usable for a few weeks. Is there danger in using it meanwhile.. I mean will I be forced to downgrade than upgrade?

2005-04-26T13:01:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	nobody can predict what will happen

2005-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	imagine mount has a weird bug that wipes your partition on the first mount ;)
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	its really not something for systems with useful data on them

2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z	ogra	Zotnix	at least not the first weeks
