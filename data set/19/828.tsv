2011-10-02T16:41:00.000Z	donald_		hi guys, anyone know about hd streaming?
2011-10-02T16:42:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	what gpu is it?
2011-10-02T16:42:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	i said earlier, that I don't know how to find out :s
2011-10-02T16:43:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	lspci | grep VGA
2011-10-02T16:44:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	or glxinfo | grep render
2011-10-02T16:45:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	i'm sorry dude, what am i supposed to do with that?
2011-10-02T16:45:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	either of those should hint at the gpu
2011-10-02T16:45:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	glxinfo | grep render gives me: OpenGL renderer string: GeForce GTX 460 SE/PCI/SSE2
2011-10-02T16:48:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	ok. did you install the additional drivers?
2011-10-02T16:49:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	the only one ubuntu suggested yes
2011-10-02T16:50:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	yeah it's really slow now, it's quite disapointing
2011-10-02T16:50:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	is it 64 bit uubntu?
2011-10-02T16:51:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	yes it is
2011-10-02T16:52:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	you could try the proper 64 bit flash it might be faster
2011-10-02T16:52:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	if its unbearable i would try it
2011-10-02T16:52:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	what's ppa? sorry
2011-10-02T16:52:00.000Z	Gentoo64	donald_	you have to add them to get new software
2011-10-02T16:52:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	oh right
2011-10-02T16:54:00.000Z	donald_	Gentoo64	it's not that important, I got ubuntu on my desktop too and the hd works wonders, it's just my netbook for college that i'm trying to fix
