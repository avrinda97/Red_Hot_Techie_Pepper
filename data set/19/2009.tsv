2010-09-08T05:15:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		http://pastebin.com/KQy8H3gE    <---- This happens whenever I try to install Wubi. Also, question: Is it possible to install the full version of Ubuntu in the Wubi version?
2010-09-08T05:16:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	that paste tells you a different file to look for the exact error.  Can you paste from the file it says?
2010-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	this is the file you need to pastebin from your computer -> c:\docume~1\christ~1\locals~1\temp\wubi-10.04-rev189.log
2010-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	wherever you see a ~1 just match it against whatever starts before that
2010-09-08T05:41:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	so the first one (docume~1) will be: "Documents and Settings" or similar
2010-09-08T05:45:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	ok I don't know how to read that but now you have the correct file for someone who hopefully can!  So keep posting your situation every five minutes or so along with that pastebin link until someone answers.  ok?
2010-09-08T05:47:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	have you considered installing Ubuntu as a dual-boot system instead of using Wubi?
2010-09-08T05:47:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	nope not sarcastic at all face value - trying to help!
2010-09-08T05:50:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	to install Wubi-wise you insert the CD while Windows is running, to install dual-boot you insert the CD and ignore the Wubi message and reboot and then the computer should boot off the CD.  Sometimes you have to go into what is called your BIOS to select the CD to boot before the hard drive.  Booting off the CD there is also a "try" option so you can see if everything works before you commit to an ac
2010-09-08T05:53:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	wedwo says you have a bad cd, you should redownload the ISO, MD5 sum check it and reburn the disc.  Or if you still have the ISO skip directly to the MD5 sum to see if it is good and then reburn.
2010-09-08T05:54:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	this should help you to check the MD5Sum -> http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows

2010-09-08T06:14:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	the whole point of checking the MD5Sum by the way is that it is an error detection method.  By comparing what is published on the website against what gets calculated on your machine with the actual file you received you can tell if your download is corrupt or not.
2010-09-08T06:15:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	you need to generate an MD5Sum of the file you downloaded to compare against what is published on the web-site.
2010-09-08T06:17:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	http://download.cnet.com/MD5-Checker/3000-2092_4-10410639.html <- download.com is a safe download source for the program
2010-09-08T06:18:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	the MD5 checking program you run to compare what is published on the web-site against what it calculates from the file you downloaded.  Listen to wedwo now - too many cooks again ;)
2010-09-08T06:21:00.000Z	headkase314	Livin4Jesus	wedwo says your download is corrupt.  So you'll need to redownload.  Do the MD5Sum check again when your redownload is finished and then burn the new ISO to a CD-R
