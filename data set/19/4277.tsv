2009-02-15T10:49:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	are you still needing help?
2009-02-15T10:50:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	witth Audacity and my mic, yes.
2009-02-15T10:50:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	what version of ubuntu are you running
2009-02-15T10:51:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	this may seem like a basic thing to check but could you right click your speaker icon (top right of screen) and open volume controll, then click second tab and see if headset is checkmarked?
2009-02-15T10:53:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	wow, no tabs in my volume control
2009-02-15T10:54:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	 so perhaps its not registering your headset on the system?
2009-02-15T10:55:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	headset? I'm trying to record audio with a microphone?
2009-02-15T10:56:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	sorry i assumed it was a boom mic headset
2009-02-15T10:56:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	Nope, I wish!
2009-02-15T10:57:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	on the same note, are your front mic, and line in volume adjusted and unmuted?
2009-02-15T11:00:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	Yes, yes, and yes. Can the BIOS control a mother board sound card? Maybe the mic is disabled in BIOS?
2009-02-15T11:01:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	 If you have an older sound card, you may have a slider volume adjustment on the back of the card
2009-02-15T11:01:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	or is it onboard?
2009-02-15T11:02:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	onboarfd.
2009-02-15T11:09:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	Im really not sure if this will help your situation but theres someone with a simular issue. Although not specific to audacity. The website is http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-78155.html  . Note its the post by Ifrossati (5th down) with an option to solve the issue.
2009-02-15T11:10:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	its ok i saw your welcome :)
2009-02-18T18:45:00.000Z	illumin8	n2diy	isnt that only in kde environments?
2009-02-18T18:46:00.000Z	n2diy	illumin8	no, it works in gnome, but not as well as it used to. Worked fine in Dapper, but Hardy is a crap shoot.
