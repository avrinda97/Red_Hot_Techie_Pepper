2010-03-10T03:03:00.000Z	red		lol wtf :)
2010-03-10T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	red	control your language please
2010-03-13T19:31:00.000Z	ikonia	red	you can script that
2010-03-13T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	red	look at the secure log
2010-03-13T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	red	in that case, no, that doesn't exist at th emoment
2010-09-16T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	red	drop that attitude also
2010-09-16T13:20:00.000Z	red	ikonia	it was a fitting reply for a stupid joke :)
2010-09-16T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	red	no - it is totally unacceptable, please don't do it again
2010-09-16T13:21:00.000Z	red	ikonia	it would be totally unacceptable if I ment it literally which is not the case obviously
2010-09-16T13:21:00.000Z	ikonia	red	it's unacceptable to joke around in that way, so please, don't
2010-09-16T13:24:00.000Z	red	ikonia	I might be nitpicking now, but following the channels rules stated in the topic do stress being friendly, but unless that line is taken out of context it is not unfriendly imo, since it's an obvious oneliner joke
2010-09-16T13:25:00.000Z	ikonia	red	I started off asking you, so now I'll tell you, it's unacceptable, please don't do it again
2010-09-16T13:26:00.000Z	red	ikonia	you did not start off by asking either, your attitude actually felt quite unfriendly and abusive regarding the matter not being in any way serious. but fair enough, this is going way offtopic so I'll drop it.
2010-09-16T13:29:00.000Z	ikonia	red	doesn't chrome look in a different place for the library ?
2010-09-16T13:36:00.000Z	red	ikonia	I've tried to create the plugins dir for chrome aswell, copying libflashplayer.so there and starting chrome with --enable-plugins but did not help yet
2010-09-16T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	red	the flashplugin-nonfree should auto set that up
2010-09-16T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	red	as in flashplugin-nonfree package
2012-02-01T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	red	yes
2012-02-01T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	red	it should be releative to where you are
