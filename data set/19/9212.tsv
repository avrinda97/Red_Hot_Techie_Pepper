2007-02-18T10:08:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	he already did, and it looked like he is allowing access from 10.0.0.12 to 10.0.0.12 - rather lacking in functionality
2007-02-18T10:09:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	ah ok, missed that paste ;)
2007-02-18T10:30:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	:p
2007-02-18T10:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	what the ?
2007-02-18T10:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	it falls over the p-word ?
2007-02-18T10:35:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	that has never worked.. he doesn't want to create a *user*
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	"adduser user group" doesn't create a user :)
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	read the manpage of adduser before looking silly ;)
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	since when ? more *buntu "anti-generalisations" ?
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	since debian implemented it eons ago
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	don't confuse adduser and useradd
2007-02-18T10:37:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	I never look silly.. I punish those wh omake me :)
2007-02-18T10:37:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	then you should hit yourself right now 'cause you look very silly :)
2007-02-18T10:37:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	admit that squeezig that functionality into adduser looks like having a "grep" option that runs "free"
2007-02-18T10:37:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	totally unrelated, is what I'm referring to...
2007-02-18T10:38:00.000Z	Seveas	adaptr	just admit that you look silly :)
2007-02-18T10:38:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	nevah!
2009-01-08T15:52:00.000Z	adaptr	Seveas	some of the later applicances that support bidi parallel ports may provide some info, but the driver has to support that, obviously
