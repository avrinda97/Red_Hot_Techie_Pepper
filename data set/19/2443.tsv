2010-04-01T10:36:00.000Z	maginot	Whiskyy	try dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2010-04-01T10:38:00.000Z	maginot	Whiskyy	are you using KDE or Gnome?
2010-04-01T10:38:00.000Z	maginot	Whiskyy	try dpkg-reconfigure kdm
2010-04-01T10:42:00.000Z	maginot	Whiskyy	I think that's because you're inside Single mode...
2010-04-01T10:48:00.000Z	Whiskyy	maginot	I'm tryong to update but even in KDE with Wifi connected I can't browse. I have no connectivity. And this laptop is connected to the same network with windows and i'm online here but not there
2010-04-01T10:49:00.000Z	maginot	Whiskyy	start your system normally, when you get the problematic screen switch to a tty "CTRL+ALT+F2" and try dpkg-reconfigure kdm
2010-04-01T10:53:00.000Z	Whiskyy	maginot	It went to the problematic screen and when i did CTRL+Alt+F2 it sent me to another "Green"screen so I rebooted and it rebooted fine now it's asking for my password :/
2010-04-01T10:54:00.000Z	Whiskyy	maginot	But WiFi is still the same, it's connected but no access
2010-04-01T10:55:00.000Z	maginot	Whiskyy	okay, so now you problem is with the wifi not with the screen, right?
2010-04-01T10:55:00.000Z	Whiskyy	maginot	yes
2010-04-01T10:57:00.000Z	Whiskyy	maginot	I'm not really sure if it's gone because it just booted this time but I hope it's gone. Thanks :)
