2005-03-28T10:56:00.000Z	madstop		ok, update regarding Realplayer situation:  the problem may only affect hoary amd64.  Hoary on i386, no problem
2005-03-28T10:56:00.000Z	madstop		Good thing I have an extra computer
2005-03-28T10:57:00.000Z	madstop		I can run the 32 bit version of hoary without a problem on amd64, right?
2005-03-28T10:58:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Yes, you should be able to.
2005-03-29T08:23:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Much cheaper just to buy a enw Nvidia card. :-)
2005-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	madstop	DarthFrog	"security by obscurity"  -- I like that.
2005-03-30T11:55:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Nope.  Ubuntu is crunchy new. :-)
2005-03-30T11:58:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	And with Ubuntu being a great desktop Debian, it also promotes the ideals of Debian.
2005-03-30T10:48:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Having KDE available for Ubuntu was the thing that did it for me, too.
2005-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	What's flabbering your gasters now?
2005-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	madstop	DarthFrog	don't ask, I don't want to look like an idiot, singing a love serenade to a desktop manager!
2005-03-30T13:05:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	It's apokryphos' bot.
2005-03-30T13:52:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Yes, it'll be easier.  But he's 14.  Time to throw him in the deep end. :-)
2005-03-30T13:53:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Nope.  dselect!!!
2005-03-30T13:54:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	dselect is the single most hideous piece of software that it's ever been my misfortune to have to use.  Worse yet, I had to teach it to a class!
2005-03-30T13:55:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Just run it from a root console.
2005-03-30T13:56:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	Up to you. :-)
2005-03-30T13:57:00.000Z	madstop	DarthFrog	I'll try it on what I call my deathwish laptop...
2005-03-30T13:58:00.000Z	DarthFrog	madstop	dselect is a curses-based package manager for Debian systems.
