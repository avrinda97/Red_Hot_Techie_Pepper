2009-01-20T10:49:00.000Z	fromero691		hi guys I need some help with executing this file  virtualbox-2.1_2.1.0-41146_Ubuntu_intrepid_i386.deb
2009-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	what happens when you double-click it?
2009-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	is ot on your desktop?
2009-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	he means open a terminal and type in man dpkg
2009-01-20T10:53:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	.deb is not a tar.  Run this in a terminal: sudo dpkg -l ~/Desktop/virtualbox-2.1_2.1.0-41146_Ubuntu_intrepid_i386.deb
2009-01-20T11:22:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	it's perl, not python.  perl should be installed by default.  To run that file, do perl vmware-setup.pl
2009-01-20T11:23:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	you should probably use vmware-install.pl
2009-01-20T11:24:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	what folder is that file in?
2009-01-20T11:25:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	vmware-server-distrib?  is it on your desktop?
2009-01-20T11:26:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	do this in a terminal: cd ~/Desktop/vmware-server-distrib; perl ./vmware-setup.pl
2009-01-20T11:27:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	what is the output of the command cwd?
2009-01-20T11:28:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	it's a command.
2009-01-20T11:28:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	to run it, type "cwd" (without quotes) in a terminal
2009-01-20T11:30:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	oops.  I meant pwd
2009-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	type this: cd Desktop/vmware-server-distrib
2009-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	then type this: perl ./vmware-install.pl
2009-01-20T11:34:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	two separate commands
2009-01-20T11:34:00.000Z	sheep	fromero691	try sudo ./vmware-install.pl
