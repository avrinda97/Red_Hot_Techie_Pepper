2009-02-22T08:11:00.000Z	ETie		xfs? reiser?
2009-02-22T08:11:00.000Z	ETie		does buntu make its own swap space?
2009-02-22T08:11:00.000Z	ETie		!ops
2009-02-22T08:12:00.000Z	ETie		I did it already joot!
2009-02-22T08:12:00.000Z	ETie		so what should this ext3 mountpoint be
2009-02-22T08:13:00.000Z	ETie		okay steve!
2009-02-22T08:14:00.000Z	ETie		If you do not go back to the partitioning menu and assign a swap partition, the installation will continue without swap space.
2009-02-22T08:14:00.000Z	ETie		the thing never asked me for swap space
2009-02-22T08:15:00.000Z	ETie		well, i got 2 gb or ram here, will that be enough to run things without a SWAP?
2009-02-22T08:17:00.000Z	joot	ETie	chu. I think ubuntu adds swap by default in install
2009-02-22T08:17:00.000Z	ETie	joot	i doubt that if it actually told me i would be installling without aswap
2009-02-22T08:18:00.000Z	joot	ETie	OK I has never done that to me..
2009-02-22T08:21:00.000Z	joot	ETie	fdisk
