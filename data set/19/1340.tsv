2011-03-03T00:21:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	partitions have to be unmounted if you wish to edit them (grow, shrink, delete)
2011-03-03T00:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	when you unmount a partition you can't access it's data
2011-03-03T00:23:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	yes
2011-03-03T00:23:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	as long as the filesystem type is supported
2011-03-03T00:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	if you format your windows partition it will lose all its data
2011-03-03T00:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	if you want the recovery partition you can keep it, entirely your choice
2011-03-03T00:26:00.000Z	Hedgehog456	ThinkT510	I know
2011-03-03T00:26:00.000Z	Hedgehog456	ThinkT510	Will it still work?
2011-03-03T00:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	will what work? formattng the partition? yes. writing to it? depends what you format it as, but again should be yes
2011-03-03T00:30:00.000Z	Hedgehog456	ThinkT510	is it recommended to keep the windows reinstall partition?
2011-03-03T00:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	that entirely depends on whether you want to keep it, in my experience its always been a waste of space because i have windows install disks if i want to install windows
2011-03-03T00:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	you can do all that, it depends on what you're comfortable with
2011-03-03T00:48:00.000Z	Hedgehog456	ThinkT510	it looks better
2011-03-03T00:49:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	i hope you enjoy using ubuntu, i certainly prefer linux over windows
2011-03-03T00:49:00.000Z	Hedgehog456	ThinkT510	thanks
2011-03-03T00:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	yes, you can resize the partition later
2011-03-04T00:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hedgehog456	wine is free, no eula or microsoft liscence required
