2010-07-22T15:08:00.000Z	jaonmchristos	appamajig	 thanks
2010-07-22T15:09:00.000Z	appamajig	jaonmchristos	it's fixable, I think, just do some googling, like I am... has to do with I-frames? I've never used avidemux, so I don't know what that is...

2010-07-22T15:11:00.000Z	appamajig	jaonmchristos	I think that you need to choose smart copy...?
2010-07-22T15:12:00.000Z	appamajig	jaonmchristos	search the page for smart and you'll see what I saw
2010-07-22T15:13:00.000Z	jaonmchristos		i figured it out but it ruined my clip
2010-07-22T15:13:00.000Z	jaonmchristos		u have to cut at a keyframe
2010-07-22T15:13:00.000Z	appamajig		anyone up for maybe helping me with my USB microphone? not being detected, not shown in lsusb while it's plugged in... LED on the microphone does not stay on (for more than about 2-3 seconds)
2010-07-22T15:14:00.000Z	jaonmchristos		so i cant cut where i want
2010-07-22T15:14:00.000Z	appamajig	jaonmchristos	did you try the smart copy thing? or is it too late?
