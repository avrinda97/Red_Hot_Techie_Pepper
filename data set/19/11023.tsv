2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Bambino	wmv doesn't work easily on 64
2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	Bambino	tristanmike	Ok.. =( thats a shame
2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Bambino	blame microsoft, they haven't developed the codec for 64 as I understand it

2006-04-10T09:48:00.000Z	Bambino	tristanmike	what does it do
2006-04-10T09:48:00.000Z	tristanmike	Bambino	it will basically delete you entire computer while it's running
2006-04-14T11:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	Bambino	I had to change it to /dev/dsp1  iirc
