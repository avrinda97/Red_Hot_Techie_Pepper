2010-10-23T17:55:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12	almis	i cant do private. I'm on mobile irc client...sorry
2010-10-23T17:55:00.000Z	almis		oh ok... and when i write head it ask me write 10 things but i dont understand what is the result
2010-10-23T17:56:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		By default when you say head
2010-10-23T17:57:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		It expects you to input a file name
2010-10-23T17:57:00.000Z	almis		oa
2010-10-23T17:57:00.000Z	almis		lok
2010-10-23T17:57:00.000Z	almis		ok
2010-10-23T17:57:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		So for instance if you want to see the first 10 lines of a file named note.txt
2010-10-23T17:58:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		Type head note.txt
2010-10-23T17:58:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		If you type head alone
2010-10-23T17:58:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		The it prompts for file name which should then be notes.txt
2010-10-23T17:59:00.000Z	almis		that was really helpful tnx again
2010-10-23T18:00:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		Yu're welcome

2010-10-23T18:05:00.000Z	almis		<wisevoyager>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3TtF2f-x5g  I think this program is available and for linux... search it
2010-10-23T18:06:00.000Z	Ifewalter_12		You have to install proprietary drivers
2010-10-23T18:08:00.000Z	almis	Ifewalter_12	So what I can do?  If i download from the official site it will work?
