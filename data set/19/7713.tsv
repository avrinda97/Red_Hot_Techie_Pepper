2007-07-08T16:44:00.000Z	JKtheCJer		what happens when ubuntu versions run out of alphabet letters: Zingy Zebra ---> ?
2007-07-08T16:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	then we will have reached world domination, ubuntu will be perfect, and nothing further will be needed.
2007-07-08T16:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	no N
2007-07-08T16:46:00.000Z	JKtheCJer	PriceChild	i hope i did not offend you :-)
2007-07-08T16:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	you wouldn't be the first to spell it like that ;)
2007-07-08T16:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	have a go at tab completion.. type pri <tab>
2007-07-08T16:47:00.000Z	JKtheCJer	PriceChild	literally type that? im on windows at moment (installing feisty again) btw
2007-07-08T16:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	try it in that client you're using right now anyway...
2007-07-08T16:48:00.000Z	JKtheCJer	PriceChild	sweet it works
2007-07-08T16:49:00.000Z	JKtheCJer	PriceChild	i didnt make the connection that "pri" was the first three letters of your nick, i was thinking it enabled tab completion rather than use it
2007-07-08T16:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	hehe :)
2007-08-23T11:12:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	"module"? And what are you "really" trying to do?
2007-08-23T11:12:00.000Z	JKtheCJer	PriceChild	yes, "module" as in "device driver", im "really" trying to fix an unsuccessfully patched module
2007-08-23T11:13:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	use packages.ubuntu.com to find which package the file is in
2007-08-23T11:13:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	then use sudo apt-get install --reinstall <packagename>
2007-08-23T11:13:00.000Z	JKtheCJer	PriceChild	k, thank you
2007-08-23T11:19:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	you can search to see what package a file is contained in.
2007-08-23T11:20:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	hehe :)
2007-08-23T11:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	JKtheCJer	"unfortunately" ?
