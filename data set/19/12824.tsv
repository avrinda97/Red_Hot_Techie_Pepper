2006-05-22T10:30:00.000Z	jhenn		anyone have any experience geeting ralink cards working under ubuntu?
2006-05-22T10:31:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	I got one working under debian for a friend of mine; IIRC the module built without difficulty
2006-05-22T10:32:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	do you have to rebuild the entire kernel or just built the module and do modprobe?
2006-05-22T10:51:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	you still haven't got the ralink to work?
2006-05-22T10:51:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	no
2006-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	what's the problem?
2006-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	ubuntu doesn't see it on install
2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	you may have to get the source tarball and build it yourself
2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	which is not difficult
2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	okay can i just build the module and install it?
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	you'll need the kernel-headers package at least, if not the kernel source; I'd try with the kernel-headers first
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	well how am i going to download the kernel source if i don't have internet?
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	I built it on a machine with a kernel I built on it, so I had a full source tree anyway
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	you have no ethernet?
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	nope
2006-05-22T10:55:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	are kernel-headers on the install cd?
2006-05-22T10:56:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	the module source is small, you could just d/l that on another box and stick it on a usb stick
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	amphi	jhenn	what card is it?
2006-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	jhenn	amphi	i don't know what card it is?  will lspci tell me?
