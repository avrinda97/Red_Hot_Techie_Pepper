2012-09-15T05:31:00.000Z	MK`	drupin	yes, you can't alter a partition you are using.

2012-09-15T05:34:00.000Z	MK`		you made the first partition extended, drupin?
2012-09-15T05:35:00.000Z	MK`		in any event you should be able to merge it with the partition after it, just make sure to back up that partition
2012-09-15T05:35:00.000Z	drupin		i dont know what i did MK`
2012-09-15T05:36:00.000Z	drupin		point me any article MK`
2012-09-15T05:37:00.000Z	MK`	drupin	look up gparted, that's an excellent partitioning tool. It's on the liveCD
2012-09-15T05:38:00.000Z	drupin		i used it the swap was 1 Gb i reduced it to 500 MB to merge in main partition
2012-09-15T05:38:00.000Z	drupin		was unable but
2012-09-15T05:38:00.000Z	drupin		i just want to remove the swap now

2012-09-15T05:39:00.000Z	drupin		how i fix this extended one
2012-09-15T05:41:00.000Z	MK`	drupin	you'd need to repartition the whole drive, you can't really move an extended partition around, it'd be a bit risky.
2012-09-15T05:41:00.000Z	drupin	MK`	means mount and all stuff
