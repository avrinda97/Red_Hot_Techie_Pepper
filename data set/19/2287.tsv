2010-06-05T23:42:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	grub just needs to know where the kernel and initrd are, and to get passed a root device, so yes. you can even boot from grub to grub2 if you want
2010-06-05T23:43:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	that's the problem, I got Error 15: File not found
2010-06-05T23:43:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	probe around for the right (hd0,1) etc from the grub prompt
2010-06-05T23:44:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	ubuntu is currently in the push grub2 to everyone phase ;)
2010-06-05T23:44:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	yes, I did that too, at first the root line works fine, but the following kernel line just didn't give me anything
2010-06-05T23:45:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	oh tab completion was a no go in the grub prompt?
2010-06-05T23:45:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	tab should work, but I got messed characters
2010-06-05T23:47:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	skip the root line and try for like kernel (hd1,0)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-22-generic
2010-06-05T23:47:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	let me show you
2010-06-05T23:47:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	hd1 ?
2010-06-05T23:48:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	ActionParsnip please take a look ---> http://pastebin.com/RuqErpn1
2010-06-05T23:49:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	ActionParsnip when booting, it chose it to boot from grub menu and I got Error 15, File not found
2010-06-05T23:50:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	verify the boot device in the grub command line, the syntax looks good but sometimes linux and grub see things differently
2010-06-05T23:51:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	grub command line as in, at the menu it has, press c before you boot :)
2010-06-05T23:51:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	I know that
2010-06-05T23:52:00.000Z	Docteh_	Pip	what is hd(0,4)? sda5?
2010-06-05T23:52:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	yep
2010-06-05T23:53:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	correct syntax ?
2010-06-05T23:54:00.000Z	Pip	Docteh_	in kernel line, it says file not found
