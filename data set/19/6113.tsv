2008-03-13T23:31:00.000Z	nandasunu		how can I enable the window burning when I close a window?
2008-03-13T23:32:00.000Z	nandasunu		I can't figure out how the annotate plugin settings work
2008-03-13T23:33:00.000Z	nandasunu		is there a specific way to get it working?
2008-03-13T23:33:00.000Z	nandasunu		close
2008-03-13T23:35:00.000Z	artenius	nandasunu	look in ccsm, animations, goto the minimize tab and make sure "burn" is at the top
2008-03-13T23:35:00.000Z	artenius	nandasunu	it must be at the top of the list in there
2008-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	nandasunu	artenius	its at the top, but nothing
2008-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	nandasunu		do I need to set some window settings?
2008-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	artenius		what does it say for window type?
2008-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	nandasunu		the other effects have a bunch of stuff under "window match"
2008-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	nandasunu		(I remember this being a lot easier with beryl)
2008-03-13T23:37:00.000Z	artenius	nandasunu	I meant window match yes, it should have the same entries as the others
2008-03-13T23:37:00.000Z	nandasunu		ok, I'll try copying the settings
2008-03-13T23:38:00.000Z	nandasunu	artenius	Its working now :), I just copied the window match stuff from the other effects
2008-03-13T23:38:00.000Z	nandasunu		thanks
2008-03-13T23:38:00.000Z	artenius	nandasunu	good :) you're welcome.   I had problems with that too at first
2008-03-13T23:39:00.000Z	nandasunu		the old dialogue used to be much simpler
2008-03-13T23:39:00.000Z	artenius	nandasunu	if you have any other problems in compiz, try asking in #compiz-fusion | lots of people there to help
2008-03-13T23:40:00.000Z	nandasunu	artenius	I will, thanks
