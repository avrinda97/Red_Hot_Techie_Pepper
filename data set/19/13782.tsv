2005-08-21T12:26:00.000Z	vitriol		lspci says my wireless card is a broadcom
2005-08-21T12:26:00.000Z	vitriol		but it doesn't specify which one
2005-08-21T12:26:00.000Z	vitriol		Network controller: Broadcom Corporation: Unknown device 4318
2005-08-21T12:27:00.000Z	vitriol		oh! i didn't think to try the cd
2005-08-21T12:27:00.000Z	vitriol		but i currently don't have the right broadcom inf file either :)

2005-08-21T12:31:00.000Z	topyli	vitriol	it's not ready i just upgraded one box today, and it doesn't seem ready for production yet
2005-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	vitriol	topyli	does it use kernel 2.6.12?
2005-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	topyli	vitriol	yes
2005-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	vitriol		my ati chipset is better supported in that kernel
2005-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	vitriol	topyli	thats why i'm considering upgrading
2005-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	topyli	vitriol	upgrade the kernel rather
2005-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	vitriol	topyli	there's no 2.6.12 kernel in hoary
2005-08-21T12:33:00.000Z	vitriol	topyli	only 2.6.10.x and 2.6.11.x
2005-08-21T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	vitriol	no, you'd have to roll your own
