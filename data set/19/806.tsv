2012-03-17T13:44:00.000Z	selite		How do I find the external IP address of my router?
2012-03-17T13:44:00.000Z	selite		Anyone?
2012-03-17T13:45:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	http://www.whatismyip.com/
2012-03-17T13:47:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	you want your WAN IP or you want the LAN ip of your router?
2012-03-17T13:48:00.000Z	selite	iceroot	WAN IP.
2012-03-17T13:49:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	and you are at the moment in the lan connected to your router?
2012-03-17T13:49:00.000Z	selite	iceroot	Yeah. I have few addresses and I can get people's routers from my browser, but I don't know the IP address of mine lol.
2012-03-17T13:50:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	and why is www.whatismyip.com not what you want?
2012-03-17T13:50:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	that will show your WAN-IP
2012-03-17T13:50:00.000Z	selite	iceroot	Because I don't get the router page from that address.
2012-03-17T13:50:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	why you need the router page?
2012-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	that site shows your WAN IP
2012-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	use that ip to connect to your router
2012-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	also read the manual of your router how to enable the router to be reachable from the wan
2012-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	its disabled by default for a good reason
2012-03-17T13:51:00.000Z	selite	iceroot	Hmm. Meaning if it is reachable from WAN then I'd get the router config - page?
2012-03-17T13:52:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	from the wan, yes
2012-03-17T13:52:00.000Z	iceroot	selite	from the lan you will always get it
2012-03-17T13:52:00.000Z	selite	iceroot	Thank you.
