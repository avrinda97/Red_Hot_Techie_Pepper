2008-02-28T06:31:00.000Z	rhineheart_m		can you recommend DMZ setting to ubuntu box?
2008-02-28T06:31:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	DMZ settings?
2008-02-28T06:31:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	puff	yeah
2008-02-28T06:32:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	Meaning?
2008-02-28T06:33:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	The usage of the term "DMZ" that I'm familiar with is where you set up a semi-public network that you put your public webservers on.  Effectively you have:   internal net <-> internal firewall <-> DMZ server <-> external firewall <-> public internet.
2008-02-28T06:33:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	Is this what yo're talking about?
2008-02-28T06:34:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	You may find more #ubuntu-server more helpful, but I don't know if they would have anything specific to say.
2008-02-28T06:34:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	puff	yeah.. that's what I meant..
2008-02-28T06:34:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	As for an SSL cert, you can generate and issue your own SSL cert, but users will see a popup saying that the CA (Certificate Authority) is not a known CA (the browsers come with known CA certs installed).
2008-02-28T06:35:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	Maybe check the known CA certs in the firefox browser, see if they list a free CA.
2008-02-28T06:35:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	puff	thanks puff for that explanation. how about the DMZ thing?
2008-02-28T06:36:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	I don't have nor know of a standard set of recommendations for a DMZ.  The generally standard recommendation is to run only exactly what you need.
2008-02-28T06:37:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	#security might help, too.
2008-02-28T06:37:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	puff	okay. but it is an added security right?
2008-02-28T06:38:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	puff	the internet cannot access the private network if the DMZ has been enabled and all ports have been forwarded to one computer
2008-02-28T06:38:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	I am not sure what you mean.  The only use of "DMZ" in this context that I know of is as a general security concept, I don't know of a particular DMZ package or setting or anything.
2008-02-28T06:38:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	Ask on #ubuntu-server.
2008-02-28T06:38:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	puff	I am talking about demilitarized zone
2008-02-28T06:39:00.000Z	puff	rhineheart_m	yes, I know what DMZ means, and like I said, I'm familiar with usijng the term in discussing network security, but only as a general term.
