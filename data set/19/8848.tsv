2007-10-06T05:44:00.000Z	schopra		Folks, I've been trying to install pdfedit and keep getting some errors related to libc6
2007-10-06T05:44:00.000Z	schopra		I've tried three different installation methods (the recommended ones at the pdfedit page) and no dice
2007-10-06T05:46:00.000Z	schopra		I ran sudo to install libc6 but it insistst that libc6 is already the newest version
2007-10-06T05:46:00.000Z	stdin	schopra	are you compiling by any chance?
2007-10-06T05:47:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	No, I just ran the the two recommended sudos, then wget to get the package
2007-10-06T05:47:00.000Z	schopra		and then alien on on the rpm
2007-10-06T05:48:00.000Z	schopra		its a bit strange
2007-10-06T05:48:00.000Z	stdin	schopra	it's probably an old package or just has the wrong info in it. alien isn't a good way to install packages
2007-10-06T05:48:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	I've just been following the instructions here:
2007-10-06T05:48:00.000Z	schopra		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PDFedit
2007-10-06T05:49:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	what seems to be common to all three methods on that page is that when I follow them, the installation craps out at the last stage
2007-10-06T05:50:00.000Z	stdin	schopra	you may have to use the older package for now http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/pool/edgy/3v1n0/pdfedit_0.2.5-0+3v1ubuntu1_i386.deb
2007-10-06T05:50:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	Thanks, OK, let me try that
2007-10-06T05:51:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	back in a few
2007-10-06T05:51:00.000Z	stdin	schopra	when gutsy is out and you upgrade you'll get the newer package
2007-10-06T05:51:00.000Z	schopra		aha, that sounds right
2007-10-06T05:54:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	Are there any other pdf editors out there that would work?
2007-10-06T05:54:00.000Z	stdin	schopra	not sure, I never needed to edit a pdf, but I'm sure there's something in the repos
2007-10-06T05:55:00.000Z	schopra	stdin	OK, thanks very much, I'll check things out a bit more
