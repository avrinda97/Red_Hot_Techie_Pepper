2011-01-11T23:07:00.000Z	edbian	newbie872	There should be a non developer one but sure, try that
2011-01-11T23:07:00.000Z	newbie872	edbian	that doesn't fix the problem
2011-01-11T23:07:00.000Z	newbie872	edbian	i don't want to re-install the system
2011-01-11T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	newbie872	I don't think you have to.  Go to that folder, look for the file, perhaps it's just misnamed
2011-01-11T23:09:00.000Z	edbian	newbie872	there it is: sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8

2011-01-11T23:10:00.000Z	newbie872	edbian	doesn't exist
2011-01-11T23:10:00.000Z	edbian	newbie872	go to that folder, look at it
2011-01-11T23:12:00.000Z	edbian	newbie872	make a copy of it with the .8 at the end
2011-01-11T23:17:00.000Z	newbie872	edbian	how do i remove this symlink /usr/lib/libpcap.so.0 -> libpcap.so.0.8
2011-01-11T23:18:00.000Z	newbie872	edbian	i found a copy of libpcap in another folder copied it there. but i want to remove this symbolic link /usr/lib/libpcap.so.0 -> libpcap.so.0.8
2011-01-11T23:19:00.000Z	edbian	newbie872	sudo rm /usr/lib/libpcap.so.0
