2007-12-11T05:01:00.000Z	michelson		how does on install the PAE kernel module on an ubuntu feisty server?
2007-12-11T05:02:00.000Z	michelson		will my ubuntu machine use > 4 G ram if i don't have the pae kernel module instaled?
2007-12-11T05:04:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	the -server kernel does not have restricted drivers.
2007-12-11T05:05:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	 sorry, so if it doesn't have the restricted drivers, does that mean i can't use the ram > 4 G?
2007-12-11T05:05:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	it does, but it means that you probably can't use your ati/nvidia/wifi properly.
2007-12-11T05:06:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	well it is a server, so i don't need any of that
2007-12-11T05:06:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	then I'd use it
2007-12-11T05:06:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	the server install CD installs the -server kernel by default.
2007-12-11T05:06:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	  does that mean the server kernel will use all my ram >4 G?
2007-12-11T05:07:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	yes.
2007-12-11T05:07:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	but 'top' and 'free' only show less than 4G ram
2007-12-11T05:07:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	are you running the server kernel? does your processor support PAE?
2007-12-11T05:08:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	supports PAE, yes, I believe so, intel clovertown cpus, but PAE module isn't installed
2007-12-11T05:08:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	 `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep pae` should tell you
2007-12-11T05:08:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	yep, it's there :)
2007-12-11T05:09:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	what does uname -a say?
2007-12-11T05:09:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	 2.6.20-16-386 #2 Sun Sep 23 19:47:10 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
2007-12-11T05:09:00.000Z	Pici	michelson	Well, thats the problem. You are running the -386 kernel, not the -server kernel
2007-12-11T05:09:00.000Z	michelson	Pici	 shoot.  well thanks a lot for your help!   much appreciated!
