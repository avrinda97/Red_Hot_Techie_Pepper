2007-04-14T14:06:00.000Z	tjcarter		actually, I think once feisty is actually properly released, I would like to build a small server CD the Ubuntu way.  Think something like KnoppMyth, but applied to a small workgroup server.  Administration working something like MacOS X Server.
2007-04-14T14:08:00.000Z	tjcarter		Probably similar services too--apache, webdav and svn, a small, well-behaved ftpd for those who need that, jabber server, project collaboration, webmail, etc..
2007-04-14T14:08:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	is knoppmyth a stripped down bootable distro specifically for mythtv?
2007-04-14T14:09:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	yes, it's a Knoppix live CD that can install a mythtv server or run from the live CD as a mythtv frontend.
2007-04-14T14:10:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	in fact, I think probably a very similar goal is in order for this server disc I'd like to make with feisty.
2007-04-14T14:10:00.000Z	tjcarter		Though honestly, there is serious consideration that it ought to be done with Dapper since it's a LTS thing.
2007-04-14T14:10:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	that sounds really cool, that's actually my current objective (making a mythbox) i am working on the network card for my mythbox first
2007-04-14T14:11:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	I can offer you some suggestions on how to do it most effectively.
2007-04-14T14:11:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	i have a wireless pci card so that the mythbox doesn't need to be dragging ethernet across my living room
2007-04-14T14:12:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	I don't know if I would do that.  Run the wires if you have to.
2007-04-14T14:12:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	UNLESS, and I stress UNLESS, you have a standalone box and will never have additional frontends.
2007-04-14T14:12:00.000Z	tjcarter		wifi + streaming video breaks too easily.
2007-04-14T14:14:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	yeah, i was thinking that this box might be the all-in-one solution. not real sure just yet, just tinkering around with things for now, but it sounds like this knoppmyth warrants some investigation
2007-04-14T14:15:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	I have an ATI All In Wonder VE that i bought in college several years ago. not even sure if it will work
2007-04-14T14:15:00.000Z	tjcarter		you know, sooner or later, someone is going to have to create an addon for UCK with a probably obvious and childish name  ;)
2007-04-14T14:15:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	do you recommend trying something like TVTime first to see if the card even works?
2007-04-14T14:15:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	I would suggest tvtime just because it's trivial to try tvtime.
2007-04-14T14:16:00.000Z	tjcarter	jasonmarcell	Not exactly a major investment on your part.
2007-04-14T14:16:00.000Z	jasonmarcell	tjcarter	thanks, will do
