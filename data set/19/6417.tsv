2012-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	histo	uatever	you may have better luck using the driver directly from ati if you are continuing to experience issues with the one from hardware drivers. I'm not that familiar with ati hardware perhaps someone else has an idea
2012-08-28T02:41:00.000Z	histo	uatever	keep in mind that a lot of TVs have issues with the way the report over HDMI has been my experience

2012-08-28T02:47:00.000Z	histo	uatever	I would ask your question again about the resolution problem in one line so that others can see it. Someone else maybe able to provide more help.
