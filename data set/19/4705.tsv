2009-04-23T01:50:00.000Z	Labmonkey123		i have a graphics card that needs more power connectors, it needs 2, but I only have one. If i just buy a splitter cable will it work?
2009-04-23T01:50:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	no, you need a better power supply
2009-04-23T01:50:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	how many pins (sets of pins) on the video card?
2009-04-23T01:52:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	yes, then it likely needs 2 6-pin  or a 6-pin and 8-pin,  (i have a 9800gx2),  are you familiar with your PSU?  do you know the model #?
2009-04-23T01:53:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	likely you will need to upgrade your PSU if you don't have the pins necessary
2009-04-23T01:54:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	no.  video cards of this caliber needs adequate power
2009-04-23T01:56:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	they can range depending on the wattage required...  from 50 to 150 usd is common
2009-04-23T01:57:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	I would suggest contacting the video card manufacturer (evga, bfg, xfx or whoever) and give them the specs of the video card and your computer, and they will suggest the correct minimum power requirement
2009-04-23T01:58:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	for example,  a BFG 9800 gt oc 512MB  graphics card requires 400W PCI ExpressÂ®-compliant system power supply with a combined 12V current rating of 26A or more
2009-04-23T01:59:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	of course yours will be different specs
2009-04-23T02:00:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	i would suggest getting the information from the actual card manufacturer,  not the GPU manufacturer
2009-04-23T02:00:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	yes
2009-04-23T02:00:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	and has the pci-e supplimentary power connections you need
2009-04-23T02:01:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	ask who ever you plan to buy it from
2009-04-23T02:01:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	look at the number of pins needed
2009-04-23T02:02:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	the +12V amperage is good for what you need
2009-04-23T02:03:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	and the connectors are good:  , 6-pin PCI-E, 6/8-pin PCI-E
2009-04-23T02:03:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Labmonkey123	so I would say that should be a good choice
