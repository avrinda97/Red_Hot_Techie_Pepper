2007-03-20T13:35:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		Hi!
2007-03-20T13:35:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		I'm having a problem with removal of java, can someone help me out?
2007-03-20T13:35:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	how did you install it
2007-03-20T13:36:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	why didn't you use the repositories
2007-03-20T13:36:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	well generally, to remove something installed via source, you just delete all the files
2007-03-20T13:42:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	I didn't manage to find anything about removing java though :(
2007-03-20T13:42:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	figure out where it put things and just rm them
2007-03-20T13:43:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	I managed to install it to the desktop by mistake, and now I cant remove it using the rm command :(
2007-03-20T13:52:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	synaptics is for touchpad
2007-03-20T13:52:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	Hehe....true, I ment Synaptic package manager
2007-03-20T14:10:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	it isn't like that thing sits there all day and consumes cpu, it updates once a day or so and checks. you won't even notice it
2007-03-20T14:11:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	But when that list is so long it seems unorganized and I may be missing the important updates because of all the things I don
2007-03-20T14:11:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	it is a lot of work to do what you want because it isn't a positive thing where you tell it what to look for, it is a negative thing where you would have to go through every package you don't want
2007-03-20T14:11:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	just update it all, are you on dail up or something
2007-03-20T14:12:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	that's 250MB+ .....Would take forever on my line ;)
2007-03-20T14:12:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	40 min maybe
2007-03-20T14:13:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	I'm behind a proxy, things are like syrup when it comes to file transfer :
2007-03-20T14:17:00.000Z	bruenig	kaktuskatta	why don't you upgrade it at night or something
2007-03-20T14:20:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	bruenig	I guess I could...
