2004-11-29T08:25:00.000Z	wood1		How do I improve the speed of my PC, my system is very slow
2004-11-29T08:27:00.000Z	wood1		Well my PC has a Pentium II 350 MHz processor with 192 MB of Memory
2004-11-29T08:28:00.000Z	wood1		Well what I really don't understand is that Windows XP which is also installed on my System is much much faster than Ubuntu
2004-11-29T08:29:00.000Z	wood1		Well It is Nvidia TNT 2 with 32 MB of memory
2004-11-29T08:31:00.000Z	wood1		Well I don't have the idea about the Nvidia drivers
2004-11-29T08:33:00.000Z	wood1		Well how do I enable the Nvidia graphics drivers for faster speed ?
2004-11-29T08:35:00.000Z	wood1		Well forgive me for saying this, but Windows 9x/NT/2000 runs faster than Ubuntu Linux on "Older PCs)
2004-11-29T08:36:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	the gnome desktop is a bit chunky for a system like yours :/
2004-11-29T09:01:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	Ubuntu simply isn't targetted at machines that old
2004-11-29T09:01:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	use a more basic distro, frankly.
2004-11-29T09:06:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	a 2.2ghz celeron would be fine
2004-11-29T09:07:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	that depends what kind of applications you run
2004-11-29T09:07:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	the main difference is the P4 has more L2 cache, which will affect things like paint programs, 3D programs more than it will OpenOffice
2004-11-29T09:24:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	~2ghz
2004-11-29T09:24:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	lots of RAM is more important though than a super high clock speed
2004-11-29T09:27:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	I'd say get 512MB
2004-12-17T16:48:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	that's because the differences are internal, and the new features aren't exploited yet
2004-12-19T08:23:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	it depends on the exact job you are giving the cluster
2004-12-20T10:54:00.000Z	Ng	wood1	perhaps a distro better suited to openmosix then?
