2012-03-31T07:30:00.000Z	sparky-		shaun__: you like unusual stuff :-)  PAE?  (physical address extension).  you got a 32-bit system with lots of memory or something?
2012-03-31T07:30:00.000Z	sparky-		shaun__: you don't need PAE for that!
2012-03-31T07:31:00.000Z	sparky-		shaun__: it's if you want to address way more than 4GB with 32-bit system
2012-03-31T07:31:00.000Z	sparky-		shaun__: why not just install vanilla 3.0.17, no xen, no kvm, no pae :-)  plain
2012-03-31T07:33:00.000Z	sparky-		zoffix: you can install ubuntu (linux generally) on software raid fairly easily.  at what point is it not working for you?
2012-03-31T07:33:00.000Z	sparky-		zoffix: keep in mind grub can ONLY boot from raid-0 or raid-1 /boot partition, nothing else
2012-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	sparky-		shaun__: well, if it's not too much pain, i would reinstall linux on your server :-)  who knew what special-sauce ubuntu installed with your selected xen/pae option ;-)
2012-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	psusi	sparky-	not true... grub2 can boot from anything ;)
2012-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	sparky-	psusi	it can?
2012-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	psusi	sparky-	yep... it can boot from lvm on top of raid5
2012-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	sparky-	psusi	i mean the /boot partition
2012-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	psusi	sparky-	yep... don't even need a separate /boot partition
2012-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	sparky-	psusi	how in the heck can grub2 get lvm going?
2012-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	psusi	sparky-	because it is super slick? ;)
2012-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	sparky-	psusi	that seems too fantastical to believe :-)
2012-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	psusi	sparky-	it has modules for everything...
2012-03-31T07:43:00.000Z	sparky-	psusi	i think he's downloading the alternate installer ;-)
2012-03-31T07:52:00.000Z	psusi	sparky-	yea, but the array can rebuild in the background while you keep working... and raid10 instead of raid1 gets you twice the speed too
2012-03-31T07:52:00.000Z	sparky-	psusi	when you have 2000+ cpu, you don't care :-)
