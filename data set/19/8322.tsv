2012-06-21T23:11:00.000Z	Alumin		if I need a Java plugin for Firefox, I just need to install "icedtea-plugin" and its dependencies right?
2012-06-21T23:13:00.000Z	Alumin		I just get this "Downloading..." window with nothing in it and the standard Java unsigned applet warning
2012-06-21T23:13:00.000Z	Alumin		which is fine, but I can't click in the warning window because the "Downloading..." window is "in front of" it
2012-06-21T23:15:00.000Z	Alumin		ok, first you have to get the public key to the server...is that already done?
2012-06-21T23:15:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Sometimes that happens with code meant for "official java".  I've noticed that a fair amount with things that never get updated, like java on print-servers, crappy routers, etc.
2012-06-21T23:16:00.000Z	Alumin	kyle__	it's not even getting that far though
2012-06-21T23:17:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	I've got some dells with a remote java-console.  If I used openjdk or 64bit oracle-jdk, I get a downloading screen that doesn't move for 10 minutes, then it will magically connect, or just die.  You mean in the applet right?
2012-06-21T23:17:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Also, minimize your browser window, sometimes the allow-applet screens get hidden.
2012-06-21T23:17:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Heh.  64bit system?
2012-06-21T23:17:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Fscking dell.
2012-06-21T23:18:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Oh wow.  32bit official always works, openjdk/icedtea half the time..  It always works if I connect froma  mac, if that helps.
2012-06-21T23:18:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Of course it can't do cdrom/iso redirection from apples.  Thanks dell.
2012-06-21T23:19:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	I've got two chassis full of C5125s, and they're ALL like this.
2012-06-21T23:20:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	Yes.
2012-06-21T23:20:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	This is going to sound so lame.  32 windows xp in virtualbox.
2012-06-21T23:23:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	I think it's a java-web-start, so it actually downloads all the peices via an applet, before launching it in a less-restrivtive sandbox than an applet has.
2012-06-21T23:25:00.000Z	Alumin	kyle__	thing is, though, if I just run "javaws <uri>" at the console, I don't get that error
2012-06-21T23:25:00.000Z	kyle__	Alumin	You can run that against the file it grabs.  Sometimes it works.
2012-06-21T23:25:00.000Z	Alumin	kyle__	hmm good idea
