2005-12-06T15:44:00.000Z	Mabus06	oskude	when I closed down doom 3 (still had choppy sound) in the terminal it was having ALSA errors, implying OSS wasn't being used.

2005-12-06T06:41:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	sorry, never installed quake2...
2005-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	Mabus06	oskude	it really should be fixed in the next Ubuntu release... I installed quake2 and quake2-data without messing with anything and it does not work.
2005-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	yeah, quake2 is crusial for ubuntu :)
2005-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	you could mail the package maintainer and ask for help
2005-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	or if its so important for you, i could try to install it too and see...
2005-12-06T06:45:00.000Z	Mabus06	oskude	it's certainly a popular game for linux. And it's on the default ubuntu repos. So yeah, I think anything in there should work as intended.
2005-12-06T06:46:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	quake2 is in multiverse (and thats not ubuntu "default")
2005-12-06T06:57:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	did you read "apt-cache show quake2-data" but i admit i dont know how to use that :)
2005-12-06T07:01:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	try "dpkg-reconfigure quake2-data" :) (i read /usr/share/doc/quake2-data/README.Debian)
2005-12-06T07:02:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	but sadly it wont find anything on the shareware downloads...
2005-12-06T07:06:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	i now found a quake2 demo through google, ill try if that works...
2005-12-06T07:07:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	cot a crappy server, capped to 100kb/s... ~5min...
2005-12-06T07:13:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	are you still there ? my quake2 works :)
2005-12-06T07:14:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	get quake 2 demo somewhere (google) and then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure quake2-data" and read the instructions
2005-12-06T07:14:00.000Z	oskude	Mabus06	i got mine from here http://www.fileshack.com/file.x?fid=64
