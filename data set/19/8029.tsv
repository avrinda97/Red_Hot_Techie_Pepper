2008-02-24T02:49:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla		My unprivileged users are complaining about a missing "shutdown" button. Any suggestions?
2008-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	afaik it is not bug, but feature
2008-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	yeah, but this "feature" is adding to my trouble tickets
2008-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	you can report it as bug on www.launchpad.net and request availability to do that as wishlist request
2008-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	I googled for it but there is nothing about that, it could be bug too
2008-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	what version?
2008-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	Gutsy, running gnome
2008-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	there is no shutdown and restart buttons I guess then?
2008-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	you guess correctly
2008-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	damn, I am on Feisty can't reboot to verify that
2008-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	users login from gdm?
2008-02-24T02:57:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	could not they reboot/shutdown from kdm then? Just suggestion for workaround, I will check this feature/bug in Gutsy when I get there, so I will report bug if necessary
2008-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	oh, yeah, but that's not good enough for them... they "need" to shutdown from inside a gnome session
2008-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	if it was a simple permissions change or something, I do it and roll it out to all the clients
2008-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	I am afraid that it is intentionally, but I suggest you to check gnome-session gconf settings, maybe something is hidden there
2008-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	also, kdm could be to blame too, not sure though
2008-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	I started reading the gconf docs before I came here... there's a lot to read
2008-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	pecisk	hostf4cekilla	so far I can't find anything in gconf
2008-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	hostf4cekilla	pecisk	thanks for checking, man... I appreciate the interest
