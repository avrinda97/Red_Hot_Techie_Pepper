2008-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	kajo		I have searched in aptitude, and I cannot find it.
2008-05-14T14:40:00.000Z	kajo		I have no idea. xD Should I paste the short list of files that were in the readme?

2008-05-14T14:42:00.000Z	kajo		it's called "anki", if you type that into firefox's address bar, google's I"m feeling lucky will bring you to the homepage.

2008-05-14T14:42:00.000Z	kajo		That is a link
2008-05-14T14:43:00.000Z	kajo		The .deb has python dependency problems, so I tried to use the source.
2008-05-14T14:43:00.000Z	kajo		last 3 @ joaopinto
2008-05-14T14:45:00.000Z	kajo		I thought I said libqt?

2008-05-14T14:46:00.000Z	void^	kajo	the debian package doesn't work?
2008-05-14T14:48:00.000Z	void^	kajo	i've just installed the debian package, seems to work fine
2008-05-14T14:49:00.000Z	void^	kajo	gdebi-gtk anki_0.9.5.7-1_all.de
2008-05-14T14:53:00.000Z	void^	kajo	repository? i just downloaded the .deb and installed it. gdebi pulled in the dependencies from the repo, no problems. this on hardy.
2008-05-14T14:56:00.000Z	void^	kajo	well, on feisty you're probably missing some dependencies. using the source package might not help you either if it actually requires the versions the deb asks for.
2008-05-14T14:59:00.000Z	void^	kajo	sure you can update the dependencies manually, it's just a lot of work
2008-05-14T15:05:00.000Z	void^	kajo	you'd have to manually upgrade python-qt4 and python-sip4 since feisty has older versions of those. the easy fix is to upgrade your distro.
2008-05-14T15:08:00.000Z	void^	kajo	their official .deb works on hardy.
2008-05-14T15:08:00.000Z	kajo	void^	thanks.
