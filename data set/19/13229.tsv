2006-02-22T14:08:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: you still here?
2006-02-22T14:09:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	yes
2006-02-22T14:09:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: mplayer -vo help
2006-02-22T14:09:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	tried the help, and xv is listed
2006-02-22T14:09:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: ubuntu mplayer packages are broken, mplayerdev will tell you to use the current cvs version instead
2006-02-22T14:10:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: also make sure if you use xv that xorg is using the correct driver for your display card
2006-02-22T14:10:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: also try -vo sdl, works best
2006-02-22T14:10:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	then I have to build it myself?
2006-02-22T14:10:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	how do I make sure that xorg uses the correct driver?
2006-02-22T14:10:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: also you can add vo="sdl," into .mplayer/config to make it default
2006-02-22T14:11:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	sdl worked :-)
2006-02-22T14:13:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: xv is faster, but try xvinfo and run lspci to check what display card you have
2006-02-22T14:13:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: #mplayer is also usefull...
2006-02-22T14:15:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	xvinfo says: no adaptors present..
2006-02-22T14:41:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: run update-pciids
2006-02-22T14:41:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: and that output means you got new hardware not in your old database update-pciids will upgrade for you
2006-02-22T14:44:00.000Z	anders__	lsuactiafner	thanks. does this change the way things work, or does it just recognize the card?
2006-02-22T14:49:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	anders__	: just recognises the card
