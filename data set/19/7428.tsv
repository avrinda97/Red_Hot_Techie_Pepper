2008-07-16T19:28:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	no, did a sudo apt-get install envyng-core
2008-07-16T19:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	Very often that is due to unsupported hardware/monitor that does not identify correctly.  Verify your monitor config particularly the v/h rates
2008-07-16T19:30:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	Alright.  *doing the pastebin atm, so don't mind me*
2008-07-16T19:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)

2008-07-16T19:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	what video card
2008-07-16T19:33:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	nVidia Quattro, can't remember if a 460 or 560
2008-07-16T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	Would you mind trying this..  System... Admin... Scrteens and Graphics... click model...then scroll up to either CRT or LCD ... and set the screen... CLICK LCD OR CRT don't worry about finding 'your' screen...  ignore the manufacture part.. just the model part is what you want... so you probably want Generic LCD 1440x900
2008-07-16T19:48:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	No such function as system/admin/Screens
2008-07-16T19:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	Look around, I am on a gutsy box atm
2008-07-16T19:48:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	Under system/admin I have authorizations, nvidia x server settings, software sources, snaptic package manager, system log and system monitor
2008-07-16T19:49:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	under preferences I have screen resolution
2008-07-16T19:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	Please give me the clicks to that once you find it..  I need to have them on this box for future use
2008-07-16T19:53:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	System Display is how I got it.  DIdn't help, but I got it
2008-07-16T19:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	but you were able to set to generic lcd and restarted x
2008-07-16T19:54:00.000Z	Downix	Jack_Sparrow	No option to select CRT or LCD anywhere, just resolution and frequency
2008-07-16T19:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Downix	I will be back in a bit, I need to find one of my Hardy boxes.
