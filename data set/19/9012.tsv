2008-04-09T23:01:00.000Z	mdd4696	harushimo	It's a pretty vague error, you should probably provide more details.
2008-04-09T23:02:00.000Z	harushimo		mmd4696: that is exact error I just got
2008-04-09T23:02:00.000Z	harushimo		sorry I can't type today
2008-04-09T23:02:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	I just got it 5 mins ago
2008-04-09T23:02:00.000Z	mdd4696	harushimo	What are you trying to do? Just cd into the camera or what?
2008-04-09T23:02:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	I'm trying to import photos from my camera
2008-04-09T23:03:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	its not working
2008-04-09T23:03:00.000Z	mdd4696	harushimo	What do you mean by import? Copy the files off of it, or using a program?
2008-04-09T23:04:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	just transfer the photos from the camera to the hard drive
2008-04-09T23:04:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	using my usb cable
2008-04-09T23:04:00.000Z	mdd4696	harushimo	Can you ls the files on the camera?
2008-04-09T23:04:00.000Z	mdd4696		harushumo: Or are you using the gui?
2008-04-09T23:05:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	I was gonna use the gui if there is a way through the command line
2008-04-09T23:05:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	I would love to hear it
2008-04-09T23:06:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	if you can put the steps in the pastebin..I'll check it out
2008-04-09T23:06:00.000Z	mdd4696		harushumo: If you know what the device location is, you can just go to the location on the command line using the 'cd' command. 'cp' copies files. 'man cp' for documentation... I can't help with the error though, sorry.
2008-04-09T23:18:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	did you find a way to do it
2008-04-09T23:18:00.000Z	harushimo	mdd4696	I couldn't find one
