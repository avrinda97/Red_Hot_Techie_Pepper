2010-04-01T18:24:00.000Z	obiwan_		yayyy guys
2010-04-01T18:24:00.000Z	obiwan_		i solved all my sound issues uninstalling pulseaudio hehe
2010-04-01T18:24:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	That usually solves all my problems.
2010-04-01T18:24:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	That's the first thing I do on any linux install...rip Pulse out, stuff Alsa in.
2010-04-01T18:25:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	I hate Pulse with a psychopathic passion.
2010-04-01T18:25:00.000Z	obiwan_	BinaryFu	from now on, i'm a hater too ehehe
2010-04-01T18:26:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	Welcome to the IHPA group.  We'll be sending you your ID badge in the email.
2010-04-01T18:28:00.000Z	obiwan_	BinaryFu	actually i read about it somewhere. the developer made a lot of changes, and he argued that the rest of the developers haven't adapt their programs to it, so it's not his fault but other dev's who don't adapt their things to the new changes
2010-04-01T18:29:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	It's not the developers of Pulse's fault that their default sound volume doesn't work properly, causes crackling noises, that their server cannot handle multiple sounds without ramping up a memory bleed and maxing out CPU?
2010-04-01T18:30:00.000Z	obiwan_	BinaryFu	he said he enhanced a lot his product, but with the counterpart of not getting along too much with legacy programs
2010-04-01T18:31:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	I dunno, sounds like whining to me.  Everyone I know is drinking the PulseAudio Kool-Aid.  I just do a LOT with audio work, so...if it don't work, I don't use it.  Period.
2010-04-01T18:32:00.000Z	obiwan_	BinaryFu	was pulseaudio in jauny?
2010-04-01T18:32:00.000Z	obiwan_	BinaryFu	cause sound worked perfect for me in jaunty
2010-04-01T18:32:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	Yes.  It's been in Ubuntu since...ummm...Hoary I think?  I can't remember.
2010-04-01T18:33:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	It's never worked great for me.  I could get multi-sounds for about 5-10 minutes, then suddenly it'd start deciding to toss out some sounds and not others...or stop playing my music.
2010-04-01T18:36:00.000Z	obiwan_	BinaryFu	but since i switched to karmic omg, hobby nail, i've been craving to make sound work. i had so many problems with sound in browsers. i thought it was a flash isue, till today i tried to play counterstrike and sound problems again. then i just thought it could be a thing with pa and its sound multiplexing.
2010-04-01T18:37:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	Yeah, for me the final straw was when I was just trying to run a game in WINE, have my music running, and using voice chat at the same time and it just crapped itself completely.
2010-04-01T18:37:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	I then figured out how to rip its heart out and slapped ALSA in its place, suddenly everything worked - flawlessly.
2010-04-01T18:39:00.000Z	BinaryFu	obiwan_	Enjoy!  It's just mid-morning here.
