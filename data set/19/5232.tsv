2008-08-08T06:44:00.000Z	bobertdos	toodlepip	Alright, go into Firefox, type about:plugins and tell me if you see anything there for Java.

2008-08-08T06:45:00.000Z	bobertdos	toodlepip	Alright, bring up the terminal.
2008-08-08T06:46:00.000Z	bobertdos	toodlepip	You can PM me if you want for less noise.
