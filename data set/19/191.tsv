2012-07-07T07:22:00.000Z	sassas123		guys, could you help me wit non-working ethernet on my notebook on ubuntu 12.04?
2012-07-07T07:22:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	We can try.
2012-07-07T07:24:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	So you plugged in your cat5 cable, and you have no internet?
2012-07-07T07:26:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	yes, i plug it into and it's typing "getting network adress" after second "network cable disconnected"
2012-07-07T07:27:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	Did it work before Ubuntu? If so that would most likely eliminate a hardware issue.
2012-07-07T07:28:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	Or try a different cable - same idea.
2012-07-07T07:29:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	cable is working cause i use it on my PC (Xubuntu).
2012-07-07T07:29:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	Okay, so the cable is working but we don't know about a different install on the same computer that is 'broken'?
2012-07-07T07:31:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	i've installed windows xp and no result. but I'm downloading official windows 7 with new drivers support
2012-07-07T07:32:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	So we're waiting for that? If you want to try to troubleshoot in the mean time.. pastebin the output of "ifconfig" paste.ubuntu.com
2012-07-07T07:35:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	just a minute
2012-07-07T07:48:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1079067/
2012-07-07T07:51:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	definitely not connected. I can't imagine your card isn't supported but how about you paste the output of lspci for me
2012-07-07T07:52:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	I'm installing windows 7 now and after 40 minutes I 'll have to go, so I can do that later
2012-07-07T07:52:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	Okay.
2012-07-07T07:53:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	What's your timezone?
2012-07-07T07:53:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	I'll be back in Monday
2012-07-07T07:53:00.000Z	jthan	sassas123	Okay - track me down. If it doesn't work in windows you can likely assume it's a hardware issue.
2012-07-07T07:55:00.000Z	sassas123	jthan	my internet provider said it was problem with a driver. Bit I know Ubuntu has all the drivers
