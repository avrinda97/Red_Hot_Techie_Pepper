2007-11-30T00:57:00.000Z	NixonInnes		can anyone help me get the 3D acceleration working on my radeon 7500
2007-11-30T00:57:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	it should just work
2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	don't use fglrx
2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	when i run test it fails
2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	what test?
2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	cedega
2007-11-30T00:58:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	cedega sucks and there's nothing you can do. There is no other driver
2007-11-30T00:59:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	does "glxinfo|grep direct" say yes?
2007-11-30T00:59:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	yeah
2007-11-30T00:59:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	then it's working and cedega is just being stupid
2007-11-30T01:00:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	haha, ok, i've messed about with fglrx driver a bit, might have made it worse
2007-11-30T01:00:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	make sure that is not installed, because it will just break the open source driver :)
2007-11-30T01:01:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	when i try run EVE it closes after the splash screen
2007-11-30T01:02:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	i got the linux/ubuntu version, which  think is supported by cedega, would running the windows version under WINE be a better bet?
2007-11-30T01:03:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	the free driver isn't great for gaming, particularly not with windows games :/
2007-11-30T01:03:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	tell me about it :/
2007-11-30T01:04:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	are there any options i can shove in the xorg to help it?
2007-11-30T01:05:00.000Z	crdlb	NixonInnes	check that wiki page that Cpudan80 linked to
2007-11-30T01:05:00.000Z	NixonInnes	crdlb	I'll give it a go
