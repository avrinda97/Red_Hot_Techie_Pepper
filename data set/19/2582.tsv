2010-03-09T11:45:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	what do you mean by "isn't working?" what isn't it clearing?
2010-03-09T11:47:00.000Z	brijith	brjann	usually when I use this command 'history -c' and exit the terminal. and take it again there won't be any thing in the history of bash, ie when I press up key nothing will come ....
2010-03-09T11:47:00.000Z	brijith	brjann	But now its not clearing .
2010-03-09T11:48:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	you may also have to remove your history file, e.g. rm ~/.bash_history
2010-03-09T11:50:00.000Z	brijith	brjann	after removing that file.. ?
2010-03-09T11:50:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	that's not really a question...
2010-03-09T11:51:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	after removing that file, run history -c again, log out, log back in, and see if the history's gone.
2010-03-09T11:52:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	that would have been useful to know earlier :)
2010-03-09T11:53:00.000Z	brijith	brjann	as you know the bash history is kept in that file. on removing that file will clear the history. That I know..
2010-03-09T11:54:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	there's nowhere else the history could be stored. unless you have multiple terminals open and are only clearing the history of one of them.
2010-03-09T11:57:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	do you have any other terminals open?
2010-03-09T11:58:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	i'm out of ideas, then, sorry :(
2010-03-09T11:58:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	that's correct
2010-03-09T11:59:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	no. the .bash_history file remains intact, unless you specifically erase it. history -c only erases the current session history.
2010-03-09T12:02:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	that is not the case *unless* you specifically erase the .bash_history file.
2010-03-09T12:04:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	my system behaves exactly as yours does.
2010-03-09T12:08:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	maybe this will help explain a bit more. http://paste.ubuntu.com/391546/
2010-03-09T12:09:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	you can see that my .bash_history file starts out at 16061 bytes. after i clear the history, my *session* history is empty, but my .bash_history file is *still* 16061 bytes. so when I log in again with bash, my history is back.
2010-03-09T12:10:00.000Z	brjann	brijith	just run     history -c && rm -f ~/.bash_history     instead of just    history -c    and you should be fine.
