2011-01-21T22:42:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	How do you mean? Do you want to see the program on your screen or the remote screen?
2011-01-21T22:42:00.000Z	Verith		Remote screen undecim
2011-01-21T22:42:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	You need to know the DISPLAY variable of the remote screen
2011-01-21T22:43:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	From SSH, type "w" and look in the FROM column
2011-01-21T22:43:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	You should notice something like ":0" or ":1" on one of the lines
2011-01-21T22:43:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	Then you can type "export DISPLAY=':0'" or "export DISPLAY=':1'"
2011-01-21T22:44:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	and then any graphical programs you run will show up on the remote screen
2011-01-21T22:44:00.000Z	Verith	undecim	Okay, I type that after the command to run the application?
2011-01-21T22:45:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	No, type the export command first
2011-01-21T22:45:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	And if you want to close SSH without closing the program, you can add " & disown" to the end of it
2011-01-21T22:45:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	For example, "gedit & disown"
2011-01-21T22:46:00.000Z	Verith	undecim	Thanks
2011-01-21T22:46:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	If all you're using this SSH connection for is starting the program, you could even include all this on the SSH command
2011-01-21T22:47:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	For example: ssh user@remotehost "DISPLAY=:0 gedit & disown"
2011-01-21T22:47:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	That will run gedit on display :0 and then disconnect
2011-01-21T22:48:00.000Z	Verith	undecim	That's perfect thanks.
2011-01-21T22:49:00.000Z	undecim	Verith	If you setup private key authentication, you wont even have to type your password
