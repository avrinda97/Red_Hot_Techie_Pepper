2008-03-01T10:57:00.000Z	mikesa81		a question about partitioning. I would like to install ubuntu on one partition, and on another i wanted to install kubuntu with kde4, would i have problems if they were both to share a third partition /home ?
2008-03-01T10:57:00.000Z	mikesa81		i wanted to keep them physically seperated
2008-03-01T10:57:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	don't think so
2008-03-01T10:59:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	you could also install KDE4 in the ~ of a seperate user, though you'de be building from SVN not from installing the packages
2008-03-01T11:00:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	yeah.. dont really want to build anything
2008-03-01T11:01:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	yeah, it's a PITA. But if it's the time factor you're worried about, there are ways around that
2008-03-01T11:02:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	PITA?
2008-03-01T11:02:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	ah.. yeah packages are way too easy to bother :)
2008-03-01T11:04:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	the reason I point it out though is that KDE 4.0.1 packages are kinda terrible; most of the change for 4.0 is in kdelibs
2008-03-01T11:08:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	still huh? i keep hearing them talk about stability on the dot... i tried a live cd as soon as it was available, it was a live cd so.... i just wanted to poke around.
2008-03-01T11:09:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	well, I'm using the trunk right now... it's very nice, but unstable a\nd a bit patchy. Plasma in 4.0 is very bad and so is Kontact. The rest is probably acceptable
2008-03-01T11:10:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	would it be a bad idea to allow those buggy apps access to my /home?
2008-03-01T11:13:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	I don't think there'll be a problem. Even if something did happen, you could recover from your regular backups, right? :D In any case, I don't think anything bad would happen
2008-03-01T11:14:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	yeh.. :) i've been meaning to get that set up.. :) any suggestions for some automatic backup?
2008-03-01T11:16:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	I use rsync, though I use it to do simple things such as  "rsync -aPv /home/harry/ /mnt/voyager6/backup/"
2008-03-01T11:17:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	I had it as a cron job which would fail silently if my external drive was not connected
2008-03-01T11:18:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	kinda
2008-03-01T11:19:00.000Z	hdevalence	mikesa81	I made a custom wrapper script that ran it
2008-03-01T11:24:00.000Z	mikesa81	hdevalence	running trunk, does that update your machine pretty much daily? or you have to checkout from svn everytime and build everytime you want to update?
