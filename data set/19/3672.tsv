2010-03-13T08:42:00.000Z	kris__		Hi. Is there a CLI interface to NetworkManager?
2010-03-13T08:43:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	only one i know of is sudo apt-get remove network-manager && vi /etc/network/interfaces && /etc/init.d/networking restart
2010-03-13T08:43:00.000Z	kris__	dlynes	Thank you.
2010-03-13T08:43:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	I'm guessing you installed ubuntu without a gui?
2010-03-13T08:44:00.000Z	kris__	dlynes	No. Just need to re-install my graphics driver in order to get Xorg to work, yet I have to have X up in order to start NetworkManager ... Catch22.
2010-03-13T08:45:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	huh?  what does installing graphics drivers have to do with network manager?
2010-03-13T08:45:00.000Z	kris__	dlynes	I need the internet in order to run "apt-get install xorg-drivers" or whatnot.
2010-03-13T08:46:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	oh....and /etc/init.d/networking restart doesn't fix it for you?
2010-03-13T08:46:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	network manager is still a non-X daemon running in the background I think
2010-03-13T08:46:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	gnome-network-manager or something like that is the gui component
2010-03-13T08:47:00.000Z	kris__	dlynes	No. I need to be able to connect wirelessly, and to determine the wl AP.
2010-03-13T08:47:00.000Z	kris__		s/determine/select/
2010-03-13T08:47:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	oh...nasty
2010-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	it's possible from the command line...it's just a huge pain in the ass to do wireless from the command line
2010-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	kris__	dlynes	yah.
2010-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	type iwconfig --help
2010-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	and ifconfig --help
2010-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	kris__	dlynes	Got a reader's digest version? :-D
2010-03-13T08:51:00.000Z	dlynes	kris__	to scan, do iwlist scanning
