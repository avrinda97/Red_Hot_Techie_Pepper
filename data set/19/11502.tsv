2007-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	dfgas_		what happens when you do that
2007-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	dfgas_		hmmm
2007-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	dfgas_		sorry no idea then  :(
2007-06-30T12:07:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	Thanks for your intent anyhow. :_)
2007-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	dfgas_	borgista	be su or close out synaptic or update manager
2007-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	My problem is that I tried to install google-desktop-linux and it's been 'installing' for days now and I can't upgrade now. Any ideas?
2007-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	It asks me to run dpkg --configure -a but it just stays there forever.
2007-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	I downloaded the .deb off a google page.
2007-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	So, any tips on how to undo the process of "installing" google-desktop-linux to free up dpkg?
2007-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	dfgas_	borgista	installing it through synaptic?
2007-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	I installed it through dpkg -i google*.deb
2007-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	dfgas_	borgista	is there a see progress?
2007-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	not in the terminal no. I can't even open up Synaptic now.
2007-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	dfgas_	borgista	maybe ctrl+c
2007-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	I've tried re-booting but every time I try something with apt-get, synaptic, or dpkg it says to run 'dpkg --configure -a'
2007-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	so many circles.
2007-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	when i run that command it just says it's "Setting up Google (1.0.1....)"
2007-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	borgista	dfgas_	and it hangs there eating up 50% of my CPU.
