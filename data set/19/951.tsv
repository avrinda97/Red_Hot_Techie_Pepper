2011-07-07T20:19:00.000Z	Roneet		Sorry. While trying to boot with an ubuntu disk, i get a kernel panic error:
2011-07-07T20:20:00.000Z	jvgeli	Roneet	: are you able to specify further please. Are you installing from a CD?
2011-07-07T20:20:00.000Z	Roneet		yes
2011-07-07T20:21:00.000Z	jvgeli	Roneet	:  could be a bad burn. Try using a flash disk install or re-burn the image
2011-07-07T20:21:00.000Z	Roneet		i got the cd from ubuntu. Didnt burn it.
2011-07-07T20:22:00.000Z	jvgeli		Ronnet :  what are the specs of the machine you are installing into?
2011-07-07T20:23:00.000Z	jvgeli	Roneet	: I am assuming you have access to a computer now. Pop in the CD and make a Flash Installer with a 1GB flash disk. Use Unetbootin if you are on windows.
2011-07-07T20:24:00.000Z	Roneet		it's an old machine with no os installed. I am trying to bring it back to life.
2011-07-07T20:25:00.000Z	jvgeli	Roneet	: CD tray speed could too low. Use a flash install instead.
2011-07-07T20:25:00.000Z	jvgeli		*could be too low
2011-07-07T20:26:00.000Z	Roneet		1.2 ghz, 512 mb ram.
2011-07-07T20:26:00.000Z	Roneet		enough for 8.04, hmm?
2011-07-07T20:26:00.000Z	jvgeli	Roneet	: Yes, should be enough
2011-07-07T20:29:00.000Z	Roneet		so what do i do?
2011-07-07T20:30:00.000Z	jvgeli	Roneet	: you a computer now. Download and install Unetbootin. Grab a USB Flash disk (1GB will do) and pop in the CD . Create a flash disk installer.
2011-07-07T20:33:00.000Z	Roneet	jvgeli	i am trying to fix a friend's machine. only recources I have is an Ubuntu cd and my phone for irc
