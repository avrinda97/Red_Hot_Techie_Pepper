2009-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	there is no best
2009-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	funkycat90210	ActionParsnip	on centos/redhat, which is what i come from, they provide a neat /etc/init.d script that saves the state upon iptables save, then those are applied at boot
2009-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	one you configure iptables it sticks
2009-06-18T01:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	those are good, try a few
2009-06-18T01:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	i use transmission as it sings beautifully with my G1 phone :)
2009-06-18T01:26:00.000Z	funkycat90210	ActionParsnip	huh? I have an android phone, how would is sync with your phone, how is that useful?
2009-06-18T01:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	dude, its SIC!
2009-06-18T01:26:00.000Z	funkycat90210	ActionParsnip	how is it sick? Doesn't seem useful to me since you don't want to store 500MB files w/ your phone
2009-06-18T01:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	enable the web interface and get the app on your phone. I nearly fainted when i selected a torrent on my phone, it opened the transmission app on the phone and it told my server to start downloading the file
2009-06-18T01:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	sic = good
2009-06-18T01:27:00.000Z	funkycat90210	ActionParsnip	nice
2009-06-18T01:27:00.000Z	funkycat90210	ActionParsnip	so it's good if you have a server you want to control via your phone
2009-06-18T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	yes, you can also port forward to it and acces sit over 3g from anywhere worldwide. good times. I had to diable the usual daemon as I could not find the config file for it, my user has to run the app at boot so it's config is used and it sings amazingly :)
2009-06-18T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	btw, theres a pyton server for banshee which will let you controlbanshee too :)
2009-06-18T01:31:00.000Z	funkycat90210	ActionParsnip	so what's your favorite app w/ your android?
2009-06-18T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	doom !!!
2009-06-18T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	afaik, they are the same
2009-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkycat90210	ahh, it uses the Azureus engine
