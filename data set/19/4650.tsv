2009-01-27T00:19:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	You may also try gksudo nvidia-settings
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	Like oCean_ said its dpkg-reconfigure no spaces
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	Go through the process
2009-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	I am under the impression that this isn't going to work for you but it is the old way of fixing it. Depending on how your xorg is configured it will/will not work. Im thinking that reinstalling the nvidia drivers is the way to go, and not through the terminal. I would use the restricted drivers application, and make sure you update your system before you start it
2009-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	Its just part of the process
2009-01-27T00:27:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	Xorg saved keyboard information mouse information and screen information, most importantly the screen configuration settings
2009-01-27T00:27:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	Did it ask anything about configuring your monitor?
2009-01-27T00:28:00.000Z	phorensic1	s0101	Ok give it a try, do ctrl-alt-bckspce to re-log in.
