2011-08-15T12:11:00.000Z	acerz		has anyone got righ-click to work properly in ubuntu?
2011-08-15T12:12:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	It worked. Could it be your fancy high-tech mouse?
2011-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	acerz		I use a click pad (I believe they are called these days)
2011-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	acerz		an hp click pad
2011-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	acerz		or touch pad
2011-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	What hardware?
2011-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	Lasers		!hcl | acerz
2011-08-15T12:13:00.000Z	acerz		my machine is an hp probook and the problem is with its touchpad
2011-08-15T12:15:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	Specific hardware.
2011-08-15T12:15:00.000Z	acerz		it doesn't respond to right click commands and synaptiks doesn't even detect right click button
2011-08-15T12:15:00.000Z	acerz		sorry, I don't have specifics now... I'm not with my machine here
2011-08-15T12:15:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	I'm guessing your hardware is very new.
2011-08-15T12:17:00.000Z	acerz	Lasers	it is only a few months old and there is no hardware problem... everything workds well in windows 7 and in windows xp but when I switch to ubuntu, the problem shows up
2011-08-15T12:17:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	Well. Come back in when you're by your hardware.
2011-08-15T12:18:00.000Z	acerz		must be a driver issuew
2011-08-15T12:18:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	Otherwise we can't help much. You lack make/model specs. It's probably xorg issue if it didn't work out of the box fine.
2011-08-15T12:18:00.000Z	acerz		so no solution can be foud here?
2011-08-15T12:19:00.000Z	acerz		all the others online solve this issue but disable other feaures at the same time
2011-08-15T12:25:00.000Z	Lasers	acerz	You don't have your hardware. Usually it take a quick google "ubuntu, touchpad, solved, <your specs>" -- You'll find some good solutions.
