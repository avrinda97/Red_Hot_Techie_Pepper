2010-01-23T09:40:00.000Z	penguincentral		err
2010-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	penguincentral		does anyone know of an ubuntu distro that'll support a comp with a 600 MHz processor and 128 mb of ram?
2010-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	you could try installing -server then just install your own lightweight GUI
2010-01-23T09:42:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	that's what I did with a thin client.  You should be able to run 'dwm' which is a very efficient window manager.  make sure you read about how to use it first
2010-01-23T09:43:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	there are honestly more efficient distros for low CPU applications
2010-01-23T09:43:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	my 1000mhz Via Eden doesn't have enough graphics power to barely browse the web
2010-01-23T09:43:00.000Z	penguincentral	seanp8088	what do you suggest
2010-01-23T09:44:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	puppy linux, damn small linux, or ArchLinux / FreeBSD if you want to work a bit more
2010-01-23T09:44:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	is it i386 or i686? (does it support instructions like CMOV) ?
2010-01-23T09:45:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	you can find out by running "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags"
2010-01-23T09:45:00.000Z	penguincentral	seanp8088	its running win 2000
2010-01-23T09:46:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	try CPUZ:
2010-01-23T09:46:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	oops, http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php
2010-01-23T09:46:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	debian, for instance, is available in an i386 flavor, where as ubuntu requires i686
2010-01-23T09:47:00.000Z	penguincentral	seanp8088	i'm recycling this comp for my uncle that doesnt really know how to use one
2010-01-23T09:48:00.000Z	seanp8088	penguincentral	if it's a pentium III then it should be fine
2010-01-23T09:48:00.000Z	penguincentral	seanp8088	yeah it's a p3
2010-01-23T09:56:00.000Z	penguincentral	seanp8088	is there a novice user friendly lightweight distro that you like?
