2006-10-25T11:24:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	What type of file system is the hard drive?
2006-10-25T11:24:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	Are you using a live cd??
2006-10-25T11:26:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	Can you mount your hard drive with the live cd?
2006-10-25T11:27:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	Mounting is basicly making the drive available for access
2006-10-25T11:28:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	um....you would have to do that with a linux live cd unfortunately
2006-10-25T11:28:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	any live cd will work
2006-10-25T11:29:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	one sec i'm at work
2006-10-25T11:33:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	are you still there??
2006-10-25T11:35:00.000Z	LiN01	clearzen	?
2006-10-25T11:35:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	boot into a live cd and go to the terminal. THe command "mount" should show you the location of your harddrive (most likely hda) then once you have that type mkdir /mnt/hda   then  mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/hda
2006-10-25T11:36:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	one sec
2006-10-25T11:37:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	if it gives you errors while trying to mount that is most likely your problem with the install cds
2006-10-25T11:38:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	or qtparted on mandrivia i belileve
2006-10-25T11:39:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	yeah
2006-10-25T11:39:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	right
2006-10-25T11:39:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	just ry to mount it first and see what it tells you
2006-10-25T11:42:00.000Z	clearzen	LiN01	yeah
