2007-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	did you install ubuntu with a different video card?
2007-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	Citizin	crdlb	yes and no, I could install the alternate cd with my fx, but not with the live cd
2007-06-16T16:15:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	well in that last screenshot, it's trying to use the intel driver
2007-06-16T16:16:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	have you tried disabling the intel card in your bios?
2007-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	have you tried disabling the intel chip in the bios?
2007-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	Citizin	crdlb	yes
2007-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	what intel card is it?
2007-06-16T16:19:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	it uses that driver for all intel chips
2007-06-16T16:20:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	that chip can run beryl btw
2007-06-16T16:21:00.000Z	Citizin	crdlb	does Berly run poorly on this card? it only has 8MB of memory
2007-06-16T16:22:00.000Z	Citizin	crdlb	how can I enabled 3d acceleration on this card?
2007-06-16T16:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Citizin	it's possible you need to increase the amount of videoram allocated to it in the bios
2007-06-16T16:23:00.000Z	Citizin	crdlb	I did, it only allows me to select 1 or 8mb
