2012-09-17T23:14:00.000Z	Smrtz		yes.
2012-09-17T23:15:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	Just came in so missed your issue - still getting a log-in prompt after ssh-copy-id ? Is the remote encrypted home?
2012-10-04T01:29:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	Review "/var/log/syslog" for clues.
2012-10-04T01:30:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	ok, thans
2012-10-04T01:31:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	I'm not seeing anything about wireless here...
2012-10-04T01:32:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	which ubuntu release are you using? It could be in another log-file in /var/log/
2012-10-04T01:32:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	the latest, just ran an update and upgrade before asking here.
2012-10-04T01:34:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	OK, so 12.04 ... then the network logging should go to "/var/log/syslog". Are you using NetworkManager or some other tool?
2012-10-04T01:35:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	nope, can you give me a keyword to grep for?
2012-10-04T01:36:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	I can't, sorry. I'd be looking for wpa_supplicant though, and mentions of AES and I guess "wlan0" if thats the interface name
2012-10-04T01:38:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	Is it WPA2 EAP-TLS ?
2012-10-04T01:41:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	How about "pastebinit" ?
2012-10-04T01:42:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	thanks.
2012-10-04T01:43:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	paste.ubuntu.com/1258952
2012-10-04T01:44:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	Before we go too far. Have you had that Wifi device working on a different type of connection? WPA2-TKIP for example?
2012-10-04T01:45:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	because that log extract suggests to me a driver/hardware issue that some chipsets have and my next question is going to be, what is the Wifi device? "lspci -nn | egrep '(net|wire)'   "
2012-10-04T01:46:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	OK... let me know the device with that 'lspci' command and I can do some research
2012-10-04T01:47:00.000Z	Smrtz	TJ-	RTL8188CE
2012-10-04T01:47:00.000Z	TJ-	Smrtz	I need the device ID vendor:product
