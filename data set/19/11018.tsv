2008-11-25T16:04:00.000Z	dennda	Kalidarn	thanks
2008-11-25T16:05:00.000Z	Kalidarn	dennda	there's also http://code.google.com/p/pidgintex/
2008-11-25T16:05:00.000Z	Kalidarn		seems to be a newer fork
2008-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	Kalidarn	dennda	i'd recommend using that second one
2008-11-25T16:06:00.000Z	dennda	Kalidarn	Is that available in ubuntu repos? It needs to work on windows as well
2008-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	Kalidarn	dennda	there's a dll there for windows yes
2008-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	Kalidarn		and there's a .so file there built in debian by the looks of it
2008-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	Kalidarn	dennda	http://code.google.com/p/pidgintex/wiki/WindowsInstallation
2008-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	dennda	Kalidarn	It's not in the repos I suppose?
2008-11-25T16:10:00.000Z	Kalidarn	dennda	doesn't look to be
2008-11-25T16:10:00.000Z	dennda	Kalidarn	thanks
2008-11-25T16:14:00.000Z	dennda	Kalidarn	Can I just download that .so file and put it $somewhere?
2008-11-25T16:18:00.000Z	dennda	Kalidarn	works
