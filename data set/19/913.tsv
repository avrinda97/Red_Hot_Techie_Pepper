2011-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	michael12311		i have ubuntu server install, and i would like to stream my mpeg2(.mpg) movies over the internet to my school. what server application(or anything for that matter) would do this? i think it would need to be compressed.
2011-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	nc, mplayer, vlc, or more complex, webserver
2011-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	any suggestions on compressing it?
2011-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	preferably in place, so i don't have extra files lying around
2011-07-19T07:34:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	Compressing? ffmpeg and mencoder can do a lot, but rather not on fly.
2011-07-19T07:35:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	i just don't know if my internet connection will support a 6gb(total) stream
2011-07-19T07:36:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	Mirrors, or cheap vps?
2011-07-19T07:37:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	self hosted at my house. i would like to stream to my school.
2011-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	What upstream? There is many free webhostings with php, so easy to set proper steam, you need 100kbps for each connection and average video quality.
2011-07-19T07:41:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	i am happy with a 1mb upstream from the house to the school. won't mpeg2 take more than 100kbps?
2011-07-19T07:42:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	1 mega bit? It is 130 kile byte.
2011-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	yes 1 mbit/s. i've read that you need more like 2-4mbit/s for mpeg 2
2011-07-19T07:49:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	It is hard to provide high quality stream on home connection, best bet is to reduce quality, or get server with good connection.
2011-07-19T07:50:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	i will look into convert/stream. vlc might be able to do what i'm looking for. i just want to keep this accessible to only me and be somewhat easy to open up a movie whenever i feel like it. that way i can watch it wherever instead of having to throw it on an external
2011-07-19T07:50:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	thanks
2011-07-19T07:51:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	then you would be better with gzip and ssh
2011-07-19T07:52:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	i would have to wait for the download to watch it though?
2011-07-19T07:53:00.000Z	qin	michael12311	Not really, since you can open file in mplayer and vlc while downloading.
2011-07-19T07:54:00.000Z	michael12311	qin	i'll try it out! thanks
