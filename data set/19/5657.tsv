2008-08-25T07:21:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		why is it that one application can take down my entire desktop?
2008-08-25T07:22:00.000Z	perillux	phantomcircuit	what do you mean?
2008-08-25T07:22:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		i mean one process just caused me to have to do a control_alt_backspace
2008-08-25T07:23:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	perillux	VirtualBox brought my entire desktop to a grinding halt because a process in the virtual machine went crazy
2008-08-25T07:23:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		why is it able to do that?
2008-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	perillux	phantomcircuit	no idea.  did you try a kill -9 ?
2008-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		i couldnt get to a terminal :|
2008-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		the entire screen was completely unresponsive
2008-08-25T07:25:00.000Z	perillux	phantomcircuit	ya that happens to me sometimes when playing cs on WINE.

2008-08-25T07:25:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		maybe it's freezing up a kernel module
2008-08-25T07:25:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		bleh
2008-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		oh i think i know what it was
2008-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		it ran out of memory in the virtual machine
2008-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		started to use page file
2008-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		and the caused a kernel module to go nutz adding to the disk
2008-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		lame sauce
2008-08-25T07:27:00.000Z	perillux	phantomcircuit	how'd you come to realize that?
2008-08-25T07:45:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	perillux	because its the only thing that made sense in the slightest
