2005-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	danko123456		and he knew he could never do it huimself, so he made all his work public...and asked others using his code to do so as well.
2005-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	danko123456		taht is the linux side
2005-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	danko123456		the OS is GNU/Linux...
2005-05-13T08:32:00.000Z	danko123456		Linux is the kernel part, the software is GNU
2005-05-13T08:32:00.000Z	danko123456		and so on, goes the story.
2005-05-13T08:32:00.000Z	danko123456		:P
2005-05-13T08:33:00.000Z	danko123456		not sure I like your story...
2005-05-13T08:33:00.000Z	danko123456		g14...
2005-05-13T08:34:00.000Z	danko123456		does not explain it completely.
2005-05-13T08:34:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	well why don't you improve upon it instead of complaining
2005-05-13T08:34:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	I was giving a very very basic overview for someone who didn't understand why it is free
2005-05-13T08:35:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	Well why don't you quit complaining and say it in an easy to understand manner so the newb can understand it
2005-05-13T08:36:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	Ok, I don't mind critisizm.
2005-05-13T08:38:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	Happy now? :)
2005-05-13T08:41:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	How does that matter? Linus wrote linux and so he named it
2005-05-13T08:43:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	And there is more non linus / non FSF software on my computer than there is otherwise
2005-05-20T10:46:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	I might try that out, thanks. Do you know what file in the gnome login starts esd?
2005-05-28T09:43:00.000Z	g14	danko123456	Enlightenment has done that for years, and with pretty scroll effects
