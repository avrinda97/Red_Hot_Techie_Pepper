2007-04-15T05:14:00.000Z	tuvwx		where can i get gcc-4.0 and g++-4.0 for ubuntu?
2007-04-15T05:15:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	isn't there a package? gcc-4.0
2007-04-15T05:15:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	no
2007-04-15T05:16:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	there are only gcc and gcc-4.1, and both are version 4.1.1
2007-04-15T05:16:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	actually there is gcc-4.0, but there isn't g++-4.0
2007-04-15T05:16:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	and you need 4.0?
2007-04-15T05:17:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	exactly
2007-04-15T05:17:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	compile it yourself :)
2007-04-15T05:28:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	got a guide/howto for building gcc/g++?
2007-04-15T05:28:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	I have a makefile somewhere, to build cross-compilation chain
2007-04-15T05:29:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	never mind.. checking gcc.gnu.org
2007-04-15T05:29:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	I can send it to you if you want, it download/build everything
2007-04-15T05:29:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	one question.. do you know if it is possible to compile and run gcc/g++ from a local directory without a system-wide install?
2007-04-15T05:30:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	sure, it does that too
2007-04-15T05:31:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	when configuring, you need to use --prefix
2007-04-15T05:32:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	oh.. so 'make' alone is not enough.. i have to do 'make install'
2007-04-15T05:33:00.000Z	Faugn	tuvwx	you need to do the whole shebang: configure/make/make install
2007-04-15T05:44:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	oh.. so 'make' alone is not enough.. i have to do 'make install'
2007-04-15T05:44:00.000Z	tuvwx	Faugn	sorry.. had to take a shower
