2008-04-28T21:47:00.000Z	Ward1983		whats wrong with this syntax in a configure file please?
2008-04-28T21:47:00.000Z	Ward1983		AM_PATH_XMMS(1.2.4,,have_xmms=yes)
2008-04-28T21:48:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	Why are you compiling XMMS?
2008-04-28T21:48:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	im not compiling xmms, im compiling a plugin for g15deamon
2008-04-28T21:53:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	Most people here are probably not developers and don't have experience using autoconf
2008-04-28T21:53:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	well i was hoping someone would, but i know my chances wouldnt be great
2008-04-28T21:53:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	so please don't get angry with the entire channel and start insulting people because nobody answered your question
2008-04-28T21:54:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	still to start acting like that just because i ask something... man am i glad there are localised channels with normal people (so yesm i dont need you ikonia)
2008-04-28T21:55:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	My recommendation would be to try a developer-oriented channel
2008-04-28T21:55:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	thankyou i will
2008-04-28T21:55:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	I'd ask here for problems with *running* a configure script, but not for help with writing one  :-)
2008-04-28T21:56:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	LOL im not writing one :) as i explained im compiling a xmms plugin
2008-04-28T21:56:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	sorry if that didnt came across right
2008-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	You asked about syntax of:  AM_PATH_XMMS(1.2.4,,have_xmms=yes)
2008-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	yes thqt is the line out of the configure file
2008-04-28T21:58:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	OK; I thought you were writing a configure.ac file or something
2008-04-28T21:58:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	again: as i explained im compiling a xmms plugin for g15daemon, im talking about its configure file
2008-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	Wyzard	Ward1983	so you're getting an error when running ./configure (this wasn't clear previously)
2008-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	Ward1983	Wyzard	correct, sorry if it wasnt clear
