2011-11-23T03:22:00.000Z	Jonii		Anyone know a good channel that could help me save as much as possible from a damaged hard drive(possibly making it work again). It reports an error and an OS that tries to boot from it doesn't get far before it crashes and the computer reboots. Ubuntu diagnostics tell me I should try repairing it, neither filesystem on it mounts
2011-11-23T03:23:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	how is the drive hooked up?
2011-11-23T03:51:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	like I said, hook the drive up as a secondary drive
2011-11-23T03:52:00.000Z	Jonii	MeQuerSat	I didn't see you said that, but okay, thanks. Just one problem though: how do I do that?
2011-11-23T03:55:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	its not a hardware thing
2011-11-23T03:56:00.000Z	Jonii	MeQuerSat	told me to hook my hdd as a secondary drive, and I have no idea what that means
2011-11-23T03:56:00.000Z	Jonii	MeQuerSat	err, nope. I'm booting from an usb stick
2011-11-23T03:56:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	a thats great
2011-11-23T03:57:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	youve got a ntfs partition on there
2011-11-23T03:57:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	what else?
2011-11-23T03:57:00.000Z	Jonii	MeQuerSat	two ntfs-partitions
2011-11-23T03:57:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	what type of data do you want to retrieve?
2011-11-23T03:57:00.000Z	Jonii	MeQuerSat	dunno. I can't remember what was on that disk
2011-11-23T03:58:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	take a look here: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2011-11-23T03:59:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	and here: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec
2011-11-23T03:59:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	take a look at TestDisk
2011-11-23T04:02:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	cant you just hook it up to the windows machine?
2011-11-23T04:03:00.000Z	Jonii	MeQuerSat	yeah, I can. It's just that, it's this machine I'd have to boot
2011-11-23T04:03:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	Jonii	well then, do what I said and take a look at TestDisk
