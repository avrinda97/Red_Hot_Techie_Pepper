2007-11-27T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	apache is started automatically when you start it.  Check if it is running
2007-11-27T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	dpkg -S /etc/apache2   will tell you why
2007-11-30T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	why do you want to do that?
2007-11-30T17:23:00.000Z	SpeCon	jrib	because off this http://www.howtoforge.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9582&
2007-11-30T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	that's an issue with the script.  If it needs bash then it needs to specify that in the shebang line at the top.
2007-11-30T17:24:00.000Z	SpeCon	jrib	 ?
2007-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	no, the script uses bash-specific features, that is the problem.  The right way to fix it is to change "#!/bin/sh" to "#!/bin/bash" in the script.  Undo what you did above.  If you really want sh to be bash again, the proper (yet unnecessary) way to do it would be: sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
2007-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	SpeCon	jrib	: i did this mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.dash
2007-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	move it back
2007-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	SpeCon	mv /bin/sh.dash /bin/sh
2007-11-30T17:30:00.000Z	SpeCon	jrib	 okay so how to fix the problem for ispconfig?
