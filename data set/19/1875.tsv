2010-09-15T18:43:00.000Z	Sander^work		http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ <-- How do I add this to my sources.list ?
2010-09-15T18:43:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	it is not a proper PPA you cannot add it to your sources.list
2010-09-15T18:44:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	So its not possible to automaticly make sure that my distro are updated with the latest Linux kernel?
2010-09-15T18:47:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	not with the latest upstream versions no
2010-09-15T18:47:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	why do you need mainline kernels over the ubuntu offerings?
2010-09-15T18:48:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	because I want the latest hyperv LIC 2.1 which is included in 3.6.35.. 2.0 is included in 2.6.32
2010-09-15T18:48:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	so the maverick kernel is v2.6.35 based, you could try the lts-backports kernel
2010-09-15T18:49:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	but in general the mainline kernels are for testing only they are not recommended or supported for ongoing use; we do not even verify they boot
2010-09-15T18:51:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	philinux: cool.. where can I read about the lts-backported kernel?
2010-09-15T18:51:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	is lts-backported kernels tested.. that they boot?
2010-09-15T18:51:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	it is not yet officially in the archive, it cannot be until release but it does exist in the kernel-ppa user's actual PPA in launchpad
2010-09-15T18:52:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	the lts-backports kernel does indeed get tested as it is the maverick kernel
2010-09-15T18:52:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	ok.. whats the apt source line to use then?
2010-09-15T18:54:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	this is the PPA: https://edge.launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/ppa
2010-09-15T18:57:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	so its safe to use in production enviroment?
2010-09-15T18:57:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	where security updates also is critical.
2010-09-15T18:58:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	kernel security updates*
2010-09-15T19:04:00.000Z	apw	Sander^work	it has the same updates applied as maverick, though it may be 1-2 days behind
2010-09-15T19:05:00.000Z	Sander^work	apw	cool.. thanks for your help :-)
