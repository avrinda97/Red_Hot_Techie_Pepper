2008-06-13T22:47:00.000Z	linkmaster03		How can I take a still frame from my webcam on Ubuntu besides Cheese?
2008-06-13T22:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	I think Gimp will just treat it as a scanner
2008-06-17T23:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	is it perhaps still in use?
2008-06-17T23:40:00.000Z	linkmaster03	gordonjcp	no
2008-06-17T23:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	positive?
2008-06-17T23:40:00.000Z	linkmaster03	gordonjcp	yes. it's unmounted.
2008-06-17T23:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	ok
2008-06-17T23:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	what does "eject /dev/cdrom" do?
2008-06-17T23:41:00.000Z	linkmaster03	gordonjcp	it returns nothing
2008-06-17T23:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	weird
2008-06-17T23:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	can you mount and then unmount the drive?
2008-06-17T23:42:00.000Z	linkmaster03	gordonjcp	how can I mount it?
2008-06-17T23:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	mount /dev/cdrom maybe
2008-06-17T23:43:00.000Z	linkmaster03	gordonjcp	http://pastebin.com/m36f380e9
2008-06-17T23:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	hm, and eject /dev/cdrom just returns silently?
2008-06-17T23:44:00.000Z	linkmaster03	gordonjcp	yes
2008-06-17T23:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linkmaster03	I'm stumped, maybe someone else can think of something
