2005-02-10T06:06:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	but don't worry it will work for u in gnome
2005-02-10T06:15:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	*
2005-02-10T06:17:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	ok. type this exactly:
2005-02-10T06:18:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	sudo sed -e 's/^#//' < /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-02-10T06:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	btw, ^ means beginning of line
2005-02-10T06:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	and comment any line that contains 'deb cdrom'; you dont want those
2005-02-10T06:26:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	and don't add to the sources.list; rather clear it and paste (clear: edit > select all; and press delete)
2005-02-10T06:26:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	and then save it. after you have saved it, do: apt-get update && apt-get install pkg
2005-02-10T06:28:00.000Z	kbrooks	Peter	close it
