2011-05-03T04:13:00.000Z	ParkerR		Hello
2011-05-03T04:14:00.000Z	ParkerR		I installed XP and now when I upfate grub it does not find it. Any ideas?
2011-05-03T04:14:00.000Z	ParkerR		*update
2011-05-03T04:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	What is the output of "sudo os-prober"?
2011-05-03T04:15:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	I'll check
2011-05-03T04:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	I don't recommend using BURG. It's a one person fork that hasn't had a commit in 6 months (possibly abandoned).
2011-05-03T04:19:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	It works just fine. Neither grub nor burg see XP though
2011-05-03T04:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	Standard GRUB2 allows theming, though admitedly does not support all of the theming options of BURG.
2011-05-03T04:20:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	Mind if I PM?
2011-05-03T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	I'd prefer to stay in-channel.
2011-05-03T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	Since os-prober is finding Windows, GRUB2 should have no problem adding an entry for it.
2011-05-03T04:22:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	Before I abandon burg I'm going to try burg-manager
2011-05-03T04:40:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	Did you see my new qustion?
2011-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	Don't add that anywhere. Install standard GRUB2 and you should have no problem. BURG is not supported here. If you'd like help with BURG it has its own venues for support.
2011-05-03T04:42:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	There and IRC channel for it?
2011-05-03T04:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	There doesn't appear to be. But you can ask questions on launchpad here: https://answers.launchpad.net/burg
2011-05-03T04:43:00.000Z	ParkerR	Jordan_U	Thanks
2011-05-03T04:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	You're welcome.
2011-08-18T09:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ParkerR	Please watch your language.
