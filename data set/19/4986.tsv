2008-09-26T21:29:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Ipswitch	and how do you say that its not working... time depends upon your connection and the mirror at your country

2008-09-26T21:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Ipswitch	you should be able to access the net... See whether the boxes are ticked in System->Admin->Software Sources

2008-09-26T21:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Ipswitch	seems like your administrator has restricted your access... you are unable to reach the repo or the mirrors are down
