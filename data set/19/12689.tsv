2007-03-24T14:14:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	I wasn't aware that that was a problem
2007-03-24T14:15:00.000Z	sky_monkey007	variant	it can be an issue.  It all depends on who makes your battery module.  I run on an older Apple Powerbook G4, and that's what Apple recommends.
2007-03-24T14:15:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	apple sucks though ;)
2007-03-24T14:16:00.000Z	sky_monkey007	variant	I personally like their laptops.  They are far less clunky than most.  I've always been a fan of PPC.
2007-03-24T14:17:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	yeah, just kidding. ppc rocks and apple tend to make stylish systems.. i don't like the touch pad on some though
2007-03-24T14:17:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	indeed, who wants a closed white box (buy a refrigerator)
2007-03-24T14:18:00.000Z	sky_monkey007	variant	they aren't bad for server use, but for a personal system, I'd rather go beige-box :)
2007-03-24T14:18:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	hehe
2007-03-24T14:19:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	i work in a datacenter, not a mac in the entire place that i have seen
2007-03-24T14:24:00.000Z	sky_monkey007	variant	if your in a Windows centric environment then you probably have no real need for an Xserve.  We run a good deal of Mac clients, so I use the Xserve as an Open Directory (LDAP) server to manage my Mac client user and machine settings, and it also serves as a SMB and AFP file server, and Jabber IM server too.
2007-03-24T14:24:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	it's very heterogenous, but mostly windows (:/)
2007-03-24T14:25:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	just googled for xserve, had no idea apple made rackables lol
2007-03-24T14:25:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	I can't see it being overly populer tbh in the face of cheap commodity hardware
2007-03-24T14:27:00.000Z	sky_monkey007	variant	well when we priced out a similar Dell server with fiber-channel NIC and a 10.5TB RAID enclosure, an XServe with a 10.5TB XRaid was our most economical solution.
2007-03-24T14:27:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	really, they look very expensive
2007-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	sky_monkey007	variant	not as expensive as Dell was.  Our server cost us about 6.5K, and the XRaid costs us about 14K I think.
2007-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	nice
2007-03-24T14:29:00.000Z	variant	sky_monkey007	cool, we should probably not discuss it here though :)
