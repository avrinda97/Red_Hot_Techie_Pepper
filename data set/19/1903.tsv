2010-09-09T19:30:00.000Z	kalleth		hey, does anyone know where ubuntu/gnome puts its xorg.conf so i can try and fix my x not starting problem?
2010-09-09T19:31:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-09-09T19:31:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	that file doesn't exist :(
2010-09-09T19:32:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-09-09T19:33:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	Hold SHIFT at your PC's startup,, then select the recovery mode and go to the root console
2010-09-09T19:33:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	then do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-09-09T19:33:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	After that, do "startx"
2010-09-09T19:40:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	i've restarted it holding shift, found the grub bootloader, tried to start both of the kernels installed (24 and 26) in recovery mode
2010-09-09T19:40:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	but both of them black screen after they get to a certain stage on boot
2010-09-09T19:40:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	And?
2010-09-09T19:41:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	i can ssh to the machine fine, but i'm not getting any output on the monitor at all
2010-09-09T19:41:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	So did you wait a while or try CTRL+ALT+F1 and F7
2010-09-09T19:41:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	i've been mashing various keyboard combinations without success for the last 20 minutes :)
2010-09-09T19:41:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	obviously that's not all i've been doing, but :P
2010-09-09T19:41:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	just tried it again, and no response :(
2010-09-09T19:42:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	Very weard
2010-09-09T19:43:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	I think i've narrowed down the issue by looking at the log files to -something- to do with the kernel update ubuntu installed not playing nicely with the version of the nouveau drivers its using
2010-09-09T19:43:00.000Z	kalleth	JohnHeikkila	but i need to see an xorg.conf to fix that, and i can't find an xorg.conf on any of the disk
2010-09-09T19:44:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kalleth	That's why you need dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
