2012-02-03T06:04:00.000Z	grubbyone		boot info script says grub is installed to sda, how do I install it to sdf?
2012-02-03T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Can you boot from a GNU/Linux LiveCD?
2012-02-03T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Ok. What partition is Ubuntu installed to (the root filesystem)?
2012-02-03T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	OK. Run "sudo mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/ && sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev/ && sudo mount --bind /proc/ /mnt/proc/ && sudo mount --bind /sys/ /mnt/sys/ && sudo mount /dev/pts/ /mnt/dev/pts/ && sudo chroot /mnt/"
2012-02-03T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	After running that, your prompt should have changed to end with a '#' rather than a '$'. Tell me when your done.
2012-02-03T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	OK. Run "sudo mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/ && sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev/ && sudo mount --bind /proc/ /mnt/proc/ && sudo mount --bind /sys/ /mnt/sys/ && sudo mount --bind /dev/pts/ /mnt/dev/pts/ && sudo chroot /mnt/"
2012-02-03T06:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	(I fixed the bug in that command that I had earlier).
2012-02-03T06:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Just a second.
2012-02-03T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Since you've already done most of the mounting, we need to just continue where we left off with the error. Just run "sudo mount --bind /dev/pts/ /mnt/dev/pts/ && sudo chroot /mnt/"
2012-02-03T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	OK. Your prompt has changed?
2012-02-03T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Good. Now run "dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc".
2012-02-03T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	It will ask you some questions, I'll tell you how to answer.
2012-02-03T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	If you set your BIOS to boot from sda, then Ubuntu would boot properly. Re-installing Ubuntu is overkill, and we're almost done changing where grub's boot sector is installed.
2012-02-03T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	For the first two questions (asking about linux cmdline) just press Enter to continue leaving them at their default (one will be empty by default, that's fine).
2012-02-03T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Are you at the question about install devices now?
2012-02-03T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Wait.
2012-02-03T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	Did you see the question about install devices? Did you change that setting?
2012-02-03T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	OK, that should work then.
2012-02-03T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grubbyone	(as long as your BIOS is set to boot from sdf). Feel free to reboot.
