2005-11-08T17:11:00.000Z	runedude_		any reason for wireless to drop out like.. every 10 minutes?
2005-11-08T17:12:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	That can happen with bad set-ups, yes.
2005-11-08T17:12:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	(or crap hardware)
2005-11-08T17:12:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	new != good
2005-11-08T17:13:00.000Z	runedude_	cafuego	no
2005-11-08T17:14:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	Is the access point set to renew dhcp leases every 600 seconds?
2005-11-08T17:14:00.000Z	runedude_	cafuego	mmm i dont use dhcp
2005-11-08T17:14:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	Any chance it's going into power-save mode after 10 minutes?
2005-11-08T17:14:00.000Z	runedude_	cafuego	hmm.. not sure
2005-11-08T17:16:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	Sounds like it drops the link; are you using a native driver?
2005-11-08T17:17:00.000Z	runedude_	cafuego	just happened again.
2005-11-08T17:18:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	Yes.
2005-11-08T17:18:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	Due to HT bugs, it's disabled. To enable it, recompile your kernel.
2005-11-08T17:19:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	Hmmm...
2005-11-08T17:19:00.000Z	runedude_	cafuego	so, any reasons why this shit is happening?
2005-11-08T17:20:00.000Z	cafuego	runedude_	This goes against everything I believe in, but perhaps give ndiswrapper a try. if that works fine, the problem is the Linux driver.
2005-11-08T17:20:00.000Z	runedude_	cafuego	hmm :(
