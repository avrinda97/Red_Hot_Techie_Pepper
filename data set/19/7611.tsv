2007-07-29T13:27:00.000Z	JBandP		it's physically too much time to invest.  it sucks too because all i have left to do is my video and my wireless(so i can tuck this machine in the closet).
2007-07-29T13:28:00.000Z	JBandP		how do i go from my desktop gui back to command line?
2007-07-29T13:28:00.000Z	JBandP		is there a quit or something:?
2007-07-29T13:30:00.000Z	JBandP		since i cant get the gui working i might as well just hit command line (which feels like a really lame reason to only use command line)
2007-07-29T13:30:00.000Z	JBandP		but terminal still means xserrver is running, no? i want to quit it.
2007-07-29T13:30:00.000Z	ideogram	JBandP	do you know how to find and kill processes?
2007-07-29T13:31:00.000Z	JBandP		system-->qUIT
2007-07-29T13:31:00.000Z	ideogram		or maybe you need to do /etc/init.d gnome stop
2007-07-29T13:31:00.000Z	JBandP		i found it system-->quit
2007-07-29T13:31:00.000Z	ideogram		I mean sudo /etc/init.d gnome stsop
2007-07-29T13:31:00.000Z	ideogram		maybe someone here can help you get the gui working
2007-07-29T13:32:00.000Z	ideogram		what is the problem?
2007-07-29T13:32:00.000Z	JBandP	ideogram	i wanted to shutdown the gui and go command line only (since my gui doesnt work right).  i figured it out though
2007-07-29T13:32:00.000Z	JBandP		but i guess my problem overall is my wireless does not work and my resolution on my screen is screwed.
2007-07-29T13:33:00.000Z	ideogram		quiting the gui isn't going to help your wireless
2007-07-29T13:33:00.000Z	ideogram		switching your resolution takes editing your xorg.conf file which takes a little time
2007-07-29T13:33:00.000Z	JBandP		ideogram:i know. but my res it messed up and it's driving me crazy.
2007-07-29T13:34:00.000Z	ideogram		but it's not hard once you know how
2007-07-29T13:34:00.000Z	JBandP	ideogram	i found a modeline generator and configured it right from the manual of my monitor.  xorg crashed and wouldnt start gnome.
