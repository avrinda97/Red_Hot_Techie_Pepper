2010-10-10T17:14:00.000Z	NickyJ101		Please note, UK servers are very high at the moment
2010-10-10T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	do you have access to their bandwidth stats ?
2010-10-10T17:15:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ikonia	i get service messages telling me of issues
2010-10-10T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	from where?
2010-10-10T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	where are you getting an issue to tell you the UK servers are under load
2010-10-10T17:16:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ikonia	A friend of mine who is on task team in us
2010-10-10T17:16:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	who ?
2010-10-10T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	please check your private message window
2010-10-10T17:20:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ikonia	why does it matter
2010-10-10T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	because your making statements and I'm asking you who is giving you official information about the UK mirrors
2010-10-10T17:21:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ikonia	look, I just give advice, someone tipped me that the UK servers were looking high from the Oxford server base, not sure who, does it really matter that much?
2010-10-10T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	yes as if it's not official information please don't pass it out
2010-10-10T17:22:00.000Z	NickyJ101	ikonia	and to be honest, i bet it is in high load as are most servers during any major release
2010-10-10T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	NickyJ101	yes, I'm sure it is, but as I said, if it's not official please don't pass it out as fact
