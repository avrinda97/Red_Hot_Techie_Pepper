2006-06-04T13:08:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	don't delete those files; they're needed (created with each session) :)
2006-06-04T13:08:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: is there any place i can read some about them>
2006-06-04T13:09:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	I don't exactly know what they are, myself, sorry :)
2006-06-04T13:10:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: any clue about them , anything?
2006-06-04T13:11:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	sort of, a vague idea: they are created when you login to your Xsession. Bad things happen when you delete them. When new X apps start, they look for those files. But I should stop now before I say too many wrong things :)
2006-06-04T13:12:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: i guess you are right ( i thought about it myself) , but i can not log in now..... :(
2006-06-04T13:12:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	oh, if you can't login, then delete them and try again :)
2006-06-04T13:13:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	(login at a console -- hit ctrl-alt-f1, and type your username and password)
2006-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: and then what , cause i have already did that
2006-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	then try logging in to the X again. Doesn't that work?
2006-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: no
2006-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	hastesaver	kosnick	there's also the .Xauthority file...
2006-06-04T13:16:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: i ' ll try deleting them and see what happens , thx for your time anyway
2006-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	kosnick	hastesaver	: explain this to me , just one reboot and it works again...
