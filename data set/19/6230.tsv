2008-02-21T12:21:00.000Z	theTrav		I have a dual boot setup on my laptop, gutsy and XP.  I want my xp hdd (ntfs) to automatically be mounted every time I log in to ubuntu.  How can I get that done?
2008-02-21T12:22:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	you can write it in ur /etc/fstab
2008-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	in the /etc/fstab are the devices which are automaticly mounted on startup
2008-02-21T12:27:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	one moment
2008-02-21T12:28:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	the syntax is like this "/dev/sda7       /media/Windows               ntfs-3g    defaults,users 0 0"
2008-02-21T12:28:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	to find the right values try "cat /etc/mtab"
2008-02-21T12:28:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	in the mtab are the currently mounted devices
2008-02-21T12:32:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	try it, i can't see ur files from here
2008-02-21T12:36:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	yes when it is mounted the windows partition have the same folder in mtab and in the graphical filemanager? i mean /media/<thishere>
2008-02-21T12:38:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	it works?
2008-02-21T12:38:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	no "umount -a" and "mount -a"
2008-02-21T12:39:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	as root
2008-02-21T12:39:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	yes all filesystems in the /etc/fstab
2008-02-21T12:40:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	have it mounted the windows device?
2008-02-21T12:42:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	ahh sry, "/dev/sda7       /media/Windows               ntfs-3g    defaults,users 0 0" only change the devices and the mount point
2008-02-21T12:44:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	sry, the mountpoint is the /media/something directory
2008-02-21T12:45:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	and u said ur win devices is /dev/sda1
2008-02-21T12:47:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	hmm, normally this is the right way
2008-02-21T12:49:00.000Z	moveax1	theTrav	good idea, after school i try it with perl/tk
