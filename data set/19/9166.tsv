2006-12-17T11:26:00.000Z	hendrickvp		I know, but I can't figure out how to get those permissions
2006-12-17T11:28:00.000Z	hendrickvp		when I type ls -l  I get, total 4 .....next line..... -rw-r--r-- 1 bryan bryan 3515 2006-12-16 21:12 my.cnf
2006-12-17T11:29:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:30:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:32:00.000Z	hendrickvp		the only problem with that is... I can not write anything from my machine that I'm editing on
2006-12-17T11:33:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	hendrickvp		well, I should say that with mysql yes, with ssh no
2006-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	hendrickvp		k
2006-12-17T11:35:00.000Z	hendrickvp		I'm on a mac, using a text editor, the program I'm using is a GUI drag'n'drop called Fugu
2006-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	hendrickvp		yes
2006-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	sudo nano [filename] 
2006-12-17T11:39:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	that's ok.  You have access as bryan.
2006-12-17T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	whatever else you needed to run. sudo -i is a replacement for sudo su
2006-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	chances are your permissions aren't broken, 99% of the time changing permissions/owners just breaks stuff more
2007-01-16T06:45:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	I believe there's only php4 IM in the repositories
2007-01-16T06:45:00.000Z	hendrickvp	Flannel	would you know why it can not find php4-imagick either
2007-01-16T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	it's in universe, so unless you have universe enabled
2007-01-16T06:46:00.000Z	hendrickvp	Flannel	I'm a newb, how would I know?
2007-01-16T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	hendrickvp	if you haven't added any repositories (modified your /etc/apt/sources.list) then you havent.
