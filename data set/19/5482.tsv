2008-11-03T01:41:00.000Z	Killabeez		Hey guys and gals, I am making the switch to ubutnu
2008-11-03T01:41:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	good for you
2008-11-03T01:42:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	well first question.. I am on a windows machine using firefox, will my favorites port over?
2008-11-03T01:43:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	they don't port over automatically, but there is an easy way to copy them
2008-11-03T01:43:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	under windows export all your bookmarks to a .html file
2008-11-03T01:45:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	next question.. I want to save some of the files on my HDD before installing ubuntu. (such as WoW, pr0n, music, ect)... Should I partition some space on the drive, move the files there and format the partition i want ubuntu on? will ubuntu give me any trouble mounting a ntfs file system?
2008-11-03T01:46:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	ubuntu works perfectly with ntfs
2008-11-03T01:46:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	so just copy the porn to a ntfs partition and leave that partition untouched during the installation
2008-11-03T01:46:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	and you will be able to enjoy the blowjobs like a real nerd, under linux
2008-11-03T01:47:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	can you recommend a program i can use (in windows) to partition the drive like i want?
2008-11-03T01:48:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	i never partitioned a drive under windows, i suggest you run ubuntu in livecd mode, install gparted and partition it from there
2008-11-03T01:48:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	is there any problems with ubuntu and the radeon 3600?
2008-11-03T01:48:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	ahh sounds like a good idea
2008-11-03T01:49:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	there should be no problem, intrepid is really awesome when it comes to hardware recognition
2008-11-03T01:49:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	there are always proprietary drivers available should anything go wrong
2008-11-03T01:52:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	can i msg you ?
2008-11-03T01:53:00.000Z	Gallez	Killabeez	what do you mean "msg me"?
2008-11-03T01:53:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	whisper
2008-11-03T01:59:00.000Z	Killabeez	Gallez	no
