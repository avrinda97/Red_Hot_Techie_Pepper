2009-03-02T16:58:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	start/stop firewall is in /etc/init.d/ufw script
2009-03-02T17:03:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	it dosent work: sudo /etc/init.d/ufw stop
2009-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	using vi that's "vi +10" to start on 10th line. However guido is gone by now I see.
2009-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	I see
2009-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	edit /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
2009-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	to enable
2009-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	what is the utf actuelly? Im supposed to make a script for iptables in school soo I want the script to work on diffrent computers
2009-03-02T17:07:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	ufw is the 'naming' of the firewall rules. It actually starts iptables rules, see configs in /etc/default/ufw and of course /etc/ufw/* files
2009-03-02T17:10:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	so what i actuelly should do when it says stop iptables services Is that I would flush all rules?
2009-03-02T17:11:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	if stopped, then all rules are 'flushed' - if that's what you're asking?
2009-03-02T17:12:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	at any given time you can see the 'active' rules by "sudo iptables -L"
2009-03-02T17:12:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	yeah but I guess that ubuntu always has IPtables enabled, So if I would have a control in my script thats says "stop iptables service" it would actuelly just flush all rules
2009-03-02T17:13:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	not stop the service couse there is none
2009-03-02T17:14:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	I don't think I understand the question. The /etc/init.d/ufw is the controlscript (or 'service') for iptables firewall
2009-03-02T17:16:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	the kernel module iptable_filter stays loaded, all rules are flushed, leaving your system unprotected
2009-03-02T17:21:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	indeed. The 'stop' argument to ufw script does actually an flush, a delete (-F, -X) on existing chains and set policy to ACCEPT.
2009-03-02T17:23:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	So when the project paper says that my script should support <Turning on/off packet fultering> then it just meas that i shuld flush all rules? But that wouldnt do because then I woulnt be able to turn it back on
2009-03-02T17:25:00.000Z	oCean_	travian_geek	turning on/off *does* mean the capability of flushing rules. Flushing does *not* mean removing your definitions in the configuration file, but (re)setting the actual state of the active rules/chains
2009-03-02T17:27:00.000Z	travian_geek	oCean_	so i change ACCEPT On of for a specific rule/chain
