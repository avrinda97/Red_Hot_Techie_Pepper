2010-01-09T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	what version of ubuntu?  Make sure you rune « sudo aptitude update » first and try again.  If it still fails, pastebin the command you ran and its output as well as a copy of your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ ?
2010-01-09T18:00:00.000Z	naoshige	jrib	still nothing. I'm using
2010-01-09T18:01:00.000Z	naoshige	jrib	hardy 8.04
2010-01-09T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	ok, pastebin that information I asked about then
2010-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	naoshige	jrib	http://pastebin.com/m5ba94cda
2010-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	need your /etc/apt/sources.list*
2010-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	naoshige	jrib	it's empty
2010-01-09T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	that pretty much explains your error then, you have no repositories :)
2010-01-09T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	you need multiverse
2010-01-09T18:08:00.000Z	naoshige	jrib	apt-get install multiverse?
2010-01-09T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	nah, edit /etc/apt/sources.list and append " multiverse" to each line that has "universe" in it.  Then run « sudo aptitude update »
2010-01-09T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	no problem
2011-03-26T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	this channel is dedicated to ubuntu support only
2011-03-26T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	naoshige	how to cook chicken?  The recipe for chicken I am using is on my macbook that has ubuntu cd in cdrom ;)
