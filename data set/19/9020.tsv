2007-01-05T08:10:00.000Z	ebroder		hi - i have a machine i can't get to boot up. install (6.10 server) runs fine, but when i try to boot afterwards, it hangs. i've tried booting off a grub floppy, but that hangs on "GRUB Loading stage2......."
2007-01-05T08:11:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	can you be more specific.  at what point does ubuntu stop booting?
2007-01-05T08:11:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	the bios finishes its thing, then nothing happens
2007-01-05T08:12:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	that isn't a good sign... do you have a means to test your hard drive status?
2007-01-05T08:12:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	i tried running fsck from the installer. came up clean
2007-01-05T08:13:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	interesting; do you just have the one hdd connected to the computer or are you using a pci-ide card?
2007-01-05T08:13:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	i have a pci-ide card, but i disconnected it because it was causing problems - installer couldn't decide which drive was hda and which was hde. right now i have one hdd plugged into the motherboard
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	righto - I've had the same problem as you in the past - you'll be happy to know with some stuffing around and a 2.6.18+ kernel it works nicely these days :)
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	what exactly do you mean?
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	if you took the pci-ide card out after the last time you did grub-install you will haev to do it again
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	i did a complete reinstall after i pulled it
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	pci-ide drives hand on the wrong bios information to the kernel and it stuffs it :P
2007-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	oh...well that is a problem then
2007-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	any chance a different version of ubuntu would work?
2007-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	edgy
2007-01-05T08:17:00.000Z	bobby	ebroder	if the livecd uses the same kernel as edgy installed jump into that and check if dmesg detects your hdd and mobo correctly - there may be an issue with that specific kernel version
2007-01-05T08:18:00.000Z	ebroder	bobby	i could try that
