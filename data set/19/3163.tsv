2009-10-13T16:02:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	do you have a black screen after installing Ubuntu or right after starting from the CD?
2009-10-13T16:03:00.000Z	arkkado	hakaishi	no the install was good. but the devices are not fuctionning
2009-10-13T16:03:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	what ubuntu version did you install?
2009-10-13T16:09:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	did you try system->administration->hardwaredrivers (i'm not sure if thats exactly how the names are, cause I use the german version) ?
2009-10-13T16:12:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	if there is nothing more than the nvidia driver, then maybe you should try to look if your hardware actually is supported
2009-10-13T16:13:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	just a moment. I'll look for a link
2009-10-13T16:15:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	look here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
2009-10-13T16:17:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	this is the overview https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2009-10-13T16:17:00.000Z	arkkado	hakaishi	ok will it fix just the wireless? i have tried copying that 2 ucode file into the lid/firmware already
2009-10-13T16:18:00.000Z	arkkado	hakaishi	is it the same fix?
2009-10-13T16:19:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	I just want to know if your hardware is supported, I wasn't talking about a fix
2009-10-13T16:20:00.000Z	arkkado	hakaishi	sorry ok. at the links what am I looking for
2009-10-13T16:21:00.000Z	arkkado	hakaishi	I know I have the intel wifi 5100
2009-10-13T16:25:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	what does ifconfig (in terminal) give you?
2009-10-13T16:27:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	I think its not about your wlan. It must be the networkmanager...
2009-10-13T16:32:00.000Z	hakaishi	arkkado	I think there is a bug at work... http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg1459513.html
