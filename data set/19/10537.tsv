2006-10-15T15:45:00.000Z	webben		I'd like it to have a easy key combination i can press to get curly quotes just like on the Mac in all gnome apps... has anyone got any idea (or even better know a howto) for how to do that?
2006-10-15T13:07:00.000Z	webben		how could i remove and reinstall gnome?
2006-10-15T13:08:00.000Z	webben		(fluxbox loads ,.... but not gnome)
2006-10-15T13:08:00.000Z	webben		(not even failsafe gnome)
2006-10-15T13:08:00.000Z	ks1	webben	like how?
2006-10-15T13:09:00.000Z	webben	ks1	How does it fail? Usually brown screen with a big white rectangle at the top left
2006-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	webben	ks1	GDM loads fine, and I can load fluxbox or xterm failsafe from GDM. But not Gnome or Failsafe Gnome.
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	ks1	webben	try removing your .gnome .gnome2 .gconfd .gnome2_private .metacity .nautilus and related directories in your $HOME. you will loose customizations like panel settings etc
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	webben	ks1	isn't that equivalent to launching failsafe gnome?
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	ks1	webben	not sure.
2006-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	ks1	webben	that works also
2006-10-15T13:16:00.000Z	webben	ks1	nope using a fresh user got me a brown screen + white rectangle again
2006-10-15T13:18:00.000Z	ks1	webben	I would boot fluxbox and try to use apt-get or aptitude to download the latest updates or either dpkg-reconfigure gnome/ubuntu-desktop i suppose
2006-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	webben	ks1	my machine's already updated but i could try dpkg-reconfigure, thanks
2006-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	ks1	webben	idont know why you are having troubles, I downloaded the latest today and everything is fine. Do you have anything special running? like beryl
2006-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	webben	ks1	no
2006-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	webben	ks1	well, except i've been trying to get orca working
2006-10-15T13:20:00.000Z	webben	ks1	but i already tried apt-removing orca festival speech-dispatcher lsr
2006-10-15T13:20:00.000Z	webben	ks1	didn't make any difference
