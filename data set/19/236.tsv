2012-06-17T05:12:00.000Z	artie		how do I copy my entire desktop files and folders to a usb drive, using only the command line???
2012-06-17T05:14:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	something like: mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt && cp -a /home/user /mnt
2012-06-17T05:15:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	you'll probably want to either use a better fs on the flash drive (not fat32) or tar your home
2012-06-17T05:16:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	to keep the permissions i mean
2012-06-17T05:18:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	what operating system to you intend to plug the flash drive into after you copy your desktop files to it?
2012-06-17T05:21:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	does your system have graphical login?
2012-06-17T05:21:00.000Z	artie	wawowe3	I hope to copy files from my desktop that's stuck in command line mode, and then recopy them to another linux users account.
2012-06-17T05:23:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	are both accounts on the same machine?
2012-06-17T05:23:00.000Z	artie	wawowe3	yes, all users have graphical login....but after logging in, one of the users is taken to a command line interface....all the others get the standard afce desktop.
2012-06-17T05:24:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	cp -R /home/user1 /home/user2/Desktop/
2012-06-17T05:24:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	sudo cp -R /home/user1 /home/user2/Desktop/
2012-06-17T05:24:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	don't do it twice, just append sudo to the beginning of the first one
2012-06-17T05:25:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	then: sudo chown -R user2: /home/user2/Desktop/user1
2012-06-17T05:25:00.000Z	artie	wawowe3	you mean combine the 2 lines you sent, so it's only a single line???
2012-06-17T05:26:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	i mean only do this: sudo cp -R /home/user1 /home/user2/Desktop/
2012-06-17T05:28:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	yes, user1 = your cmdline only account    user2 = your gui account
2012-06-17T05:30:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	if you only what the files on the desktop then yes, the cmd i gave you will copy everything from the old account to the desktop on the new one though
2012-06-17T05:33:00.000Z	wawowe3	artie	no, anywhere will work
2012-06-17T05:43:00.000Z	artie	wawowe3	ty, it worked perfectly!!!! many many tnx!!!!!
