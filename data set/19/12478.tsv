2005-10-23T13:14:00.000Z	Danny|	nalioth	any way to change file permissions of a folder, all its subfolders and files so i can write to them? they are currently set to read only and its 3500 files.. cant go to each one and manually do it.. must be a better way?
2005-10-23T13:14:00.000Z	nalioth	Danny|	open a terminal and type "man chmod"
2005-10-23T13:22:00.000Z	Danny|	nalioth	ugh confusing >_< so to make all subfolders and files of a dir read and write I'd do this? chmod +rw /folder?
