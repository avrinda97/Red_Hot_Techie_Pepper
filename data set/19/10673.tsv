2006-08-08T07:21:00.000Z	Gumby		lol, so you got it to work with very little difficulty yet you complain at lack of options?
2006-08-08T07:21:00.000Z	Gumby		so, it works... it didnt confuse me with options, and I am pissed off at that
2006-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	Gumby		you just cant please some people
2006-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	Gumby		whats to be confused with?
2006-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	Gumby		if you dont use wep then dont input anything
2006-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	Gumby		you dont need to set a channel
2006-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	Gumby		the wireless scans all chanels and knows which channel a given access point is on
2006-08-08T07:23:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop	Gumby	not neccessarily true
2006-08-08T07:23:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop		oh you can also set channel to "auto"
2006-08-08T07:23:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop		seriously man iwconfig :P
2006-08-08T07:23:00.000Z	Gumby	Kyral_Laptop	the only case that would be true is if you had two ap's with the same essid on different channels.  but the odds of that are fairly low
2006-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	Gumby	Kyral_Laptop	indeed man iwconfig
2006-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop	Gumby	I like to define it whenever there are two WLANs in range just to be sure
2006-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop		oh btw, to scan for networks, iwlist <device> scanning as root
2006-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	Gumby		iwlist <device> scan
2006-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop		make sure the device is actually up first
2006-08-08T07:25:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop		I usually start my laptop with network devices off then manually bring them up
2006-08-08T07:25:00.000Z	Gumby	Kyral_Laptop	and in ubuntu you dont have to be root.  which I dont like much myself personally..  but its easy for a rookie
2006-08-08T07:26:00.000Z	Kyral_Laptop	Gumby	I know, but I use Archlinux
