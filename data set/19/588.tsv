2012-02-12T05:27:00.000Z	_numbers		just upgraded to 11.10 and in gnome3 when i go to system settings > display i get an error "Could not get screen information" "RANDR extension is not present"
2012-02-12T05:27:00.000Z	_numbers		so i go `sudo apt-get install xrandr` and i get an error "E: Package 'xrandr' has no installation candidate"
2012-02-12T05:28:00.000Z	_numbers		"However the following packages replace it:   x11-xserver-utils:i386 x11-xserver-utils"
2012-02-12T05:28:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	what are you trying to do with xrandr?
2012-02-12T05:28:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	you might try installing libxrandr
2012-02-12T05:29:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	aside from that, I don't know that xrandr can be installed by itself. and I'm pretty sure Xrandr is just a library.
2012-02-12T05:29:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	then you have it.
2012-02-12T05:30:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	but I'd try installing the packages that it lists that replace what you are trying to install.
2012-02-12T05:31:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	if it says they are installed, chance are you already have it.
2012-02-12T05:32:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	give me a second.
2012-02-12T05:33:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	ok, try installing "Grandr" then run Grandr when it's done.
2012-02-12T05:34:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	just so you know, Grandr is a GTK interface for Xrandr.
2012-02-12T05:34:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	ok, I'm stumped here, give me a second to google this.
2012-02-12T05:37:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	if tat's the case. I'd be careful with what you do, conflicting apps have the very real possibility of breaking a system, especially ones that integrate with an important part like X.org.
2012-02-12T05:38:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	try enabling it then.
2012-02-12T05:39:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	then reboot and see what happens. if anything goes wrong, come back here.
2012-02-12T05:41:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	sorry, can't help you there as I have no clue myself,
2012-02-12T05:41:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	keep telling myself to look that up.
2012-02-12T05:42:00.000Z	c_smith_	_numbers	you might try 'service lightdm restart'
