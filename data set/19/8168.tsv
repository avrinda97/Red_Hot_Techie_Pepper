2008-01-30T00:05:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	X window ?
2008-01-30T00:06:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	keep the posts to a single line please, did you just run a new install, and it didnt enter into Gnome, or why are you in a terminal ?
2008-01-30T00:06:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	once the new install is complete, it should load into Gnome (prompting you) automatically
2008-01-30T00:07:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	it never did ive been trying to get into it ever since, i guess my Xorg isnt running someone was trying to help earlier
2008-01-30T00:08:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	do you have a new/old card ?
2008-01-30T00:08:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	card?
2008-01-30T00:09:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	your video, as you said your xorg isnt running, thats related to your video card
2008-01-30T00:09:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	its a Ati Radeon Mobility
2008-01-30T00:10:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	did you atleast get the install complete?
2008-01-30T00:12:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	did you receive any errors? did you setup/adjust your xorg.conf ?
2008-01-30T00:12:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	i did the apt-get -s install xorg
2008-01-30T00:13:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	why did you do that, as it would already be installed during the Ubuntu installation ?
2008-01-30T00:13:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	is a re-installation of Ubuntu an option for you?
2008-01-30T00:14:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	i couldnt find it in /var/log
2008-01-30T00:15:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	i had trouble installing off cd so tried wubi that didnt work so i used unetbootin and now im here
2008-01-30T00:15:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	i have no idea what wubi nor unebootin are, but please answer the question
2008-01-30T00:17:00.000Z	new2linux	neverblue	yes probably could try again, very new to this, wubi and unetbootin install from iso or internet rather then cd.
2008-01-30T00:18:00.000Z	neverblue	new2linux	did you try both the Live and Alt. Ubuntu installation CDs ? im guessing the Alt. would work best for you
