2011-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	joshlegs		... idk reighnakj. to be honest im reallly new to the linux thing myself. i just remembered i had a problem with ubuntu 11.04 installing from cd ...
2011-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	joshlegs		sorry bud :(
2011-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	joshlegs		have you booted from cd before on your computer reighnakj? i know when i did that it took a while cuz i had a crappy system
2011-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	joshlegs		reighnakj so when you put the cd in and boot from it, it just goes to the loading dots and thats all ?
2011-07-09T08:03:00.000Z	joshlegs		reighnakj what does it do when you just let it boot from disc normally ??
2011-07-09T08:04:00.000Z	joshlegs		yeah try booting from hd and see what happens :S im not sure what its doing from the cd
2011-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	joshlegs		reighnakj thats what i did. i like it that way i have options of switching back and forth.

2011-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	thanks :)
2011-07-09T08:10:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	term open
2011-07-09T08:12:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	press CTRL+ALT+T when I get the term open? or was there a paste that i didn't catch?
2011-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	pasted, no error, no change.
2011-07-09T08:15:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	I also have been doing a bit of investigative poking, and with r-click on desktop,  applications -> settings -> XFCE manager, there's an icon for panel, but clicking it brings up no panel, nor a configuration menu/display.
2011-07-09T08:15:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	I did try the paste though,it appeared to do nothing.
2011-07-09T08:16:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	pkill gnome-panel executed.
2011-07-09T08:19:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	figured it out. I just had to run xfce4-panel, though your suggestion of gnome panel put me on the right track!
2011-07-09T08:20:00.000Z	Amy_	joshlegs	though, I do have to ask. How do I have that run permanently in the background. When I close the term, it kills the command
