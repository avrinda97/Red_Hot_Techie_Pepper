2009-04-21T03:39:00.000Z	Justin_		what about /boot?
2009-04-21T03:39:00.000Z	Justin_		100 or 200mb for that?
2009-04-21T03:39:00.000Z	Justin_		really? why not?
2009-04-21T03:39:00.000Z	Justin_		aah
2009-04-21T03:40:00.000Z	Justin_		well i was thinking of making /boot its own partition but if there really is no benefit, i might as well make it part of /
2009-04-21T03:40:00.000Z	Justin_		i was thinking 15-20gb /, and the rest of my 160gb hdd will be /home
2009-04-21T03:41:00.000Z	Justin_		yeah.. but the problem is.. i like a lot of KDE apps, but i prefer the gnome desktop, so i end up with a ton of libs
2009-04-21T03:42:00.000Z	Justin_		hmm... so taking into consideration how i prefer the gnome desktop but KDE apps, and the number of libs ill be using (32-bit OS) how well will 10gb cut it for /?
2009-04-21T03:43:00.000Z	Justin_		im using an intel atom processor.. so 32 bits for me
2009-04-21T03:43:00.000Z	Justin_		aah... damn it, but the OCD i am prefers things in multiples of 10
2009-04-21T03:43:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	I use KDE and Gnome with a 50 GB /   8% used so far.
2009-04-21T03:44:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	yes.  I like to use a LiveCD of 'gparted' to handle that.
2009-04-21T03:44:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	it does an incredible job of resizing partitions
2009-04-21T03:45:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	gparted will be able to resize it EASILY if you wanted
2009-04-21T03:46:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	It's just one partition of a couple on the hard drive, right?
2009-04-21T03:47:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	I moved my root, home, and swap in one gparted session multiple times and as long as you don't interrupted it while it's working, it will work just fine.  It is a 'use at your own discretion' deal, but it will work just fine.
2009-04-21T03:48:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	gparted will work for any of that you're trying to do.  It is NOT restricted to normal Linux partitions, either.  I've moved and resized NTFS as well
2009-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	don't worry about putting /boot on its own partition.  use / as the bootable partition
2009-04-21T03:50:00.000Z	Huufarted	Justin_	/boot is just REFERENCED when the system boots.  /boot itself is not booting
