2007-10-22T08:03:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	the fusion icon isn't in the ubuntu repos, aFAIK
2007-10-22T08:04:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	wait, is desktop-effects the desktop effects themselves, or is that the fusion-icon renamed?
2007-10-22T08:05:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	that ios what its called in the add/remove programs list
2007-10-22T08:05:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	why'd they rename it???
2007-10-22T08:06:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	: no idea, but when opened its titled compiz config setteings manager
2007-10-22T08:06:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	wow im tired, cant spell :P
2007-10-22T08:06:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	i know what CCSM is, but is "desktop-effects" the notification area icon that you can right click and pick CCSM or pick emerald settings or reload window manager or change window manager and all that?
2007-10-22T08:07:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	i have no icon, no, not like i did when i had beryl installed
2007-10-22T08:08:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	oh ok.  i didn't think the icon was packaged in ubuntu. i have it packaged in my ppa though
2007-10-22T08:09:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	if you'd like the icon, i can tell you how to get it
2007-10-22T08:10:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	no problem, i have the settings how i like them anyway, love my cube.. if i had an icon i would just fiddle more.
2007-10-22T08:11:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	hah i find it convenient for when emerald crashes (compiz is so stable, but emerald is still buggy :( ) so i can switch to gtk window decorator then back to emerald to fix my window borders
2007-10-22T08:12:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	havent tried emerald, is it any good? anyways, my hard drive currently has 50mb of space left, not in a hurry to install anything.
2007-10-22T08:12:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	oh it's the transparent window borders thing
2007-10-22T08:13:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	why such a small hard drive?
2007-10-22T08:13:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	or why so much torrenting?
2007-10-22T08:14:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	my vista install is on a 160gb drive with 1gb of space left, i had a spare 4gb drive from an old pc so i formatted it and put ubuntu on that, im getting a 500gb one delivered tomorrow, and its all going to be gutsys :)
2007-10-22T08:15:00.000Z	macogw	Alien18	i see.  i have an old pentium 2 with a 5gb hard drive, so i know how that is.  it just has debian, enlightenment, iceweasel, and open office.  i have a 2gb hard drive somewhere too in case that one gets too full ;)
2007-10-22T08:16:00.000Z	Alien18	macogw	always good to have a failsafe.
