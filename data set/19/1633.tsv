2011-02-16T05:41:00.000Z	hylian		hello, i goofed up my fstab, and so now i am in terminal. anyways, for some reason sudo nano /etc/fstab does not work, it is still write protected. I can't even chmod a+x /etc/fstab... please help
2011-02-16T05:42:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	paste /etc/fstab?
2011-02-16T05:42:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	i have no desktop, how?
2011-02-16T05:42:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	are you on the internet?
2011-02-16T05:41:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	sounds like the drive is mounted ro
2011-02-16T05:41:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	did you set the / drive to be mounted as ro?
2011-02-16T05:42:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	actually, i accidentally made 2 drives both /dev/sda1.
2011-02-16T05:43:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	um, no. ofcoarse i am, but only in tty, or terminal. how else would i be talking to you?
2011-02-16T05:44:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	well, if you can't edit it with sudo, it must be mounted as ro
2011-02-16T05:45:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	...I did that once :P
2011-02-16T05:45:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	it currently isn't mounted at all, or so i thought. but my problem isn't accessing the drive, my problem is editing fstab, which i can access, but cannot change
2011-02-16T05:46:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	try sudo mkdir /tester
2011-02-16T05:48:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	i can't umount that drive, but i can see the contents, and i can even open a file using nano, for instance.
2011-02-16T05:48:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	what drive? this isn't /?
2011-02-16T05:49:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	yes, it would be /
2011-02-16T05:49:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	then don't try to umount it, the drive you're running on
2011-02-16T05:50:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	and ricorx7 i'll be right back, im going to boot of the cd and change fstab, brb
2011-02-16T05:50:00.000Z	bencahill	hylian	yes, that's what you need to do
2011-02-16T06:10:00.000Z	hylian	bencahill	man, i appreciate the help, but how can you ask me if i am connected to the internet, when i am using an internet protocol to talk to you?
