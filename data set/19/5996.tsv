2008-04-03T08:06:00.000Z	fxjr		did you notice that when you press ctrl + alt + pgup or down
2008-04-03T08:06:00.000Z	fxjr		compiz changes workspaces?
2008-04-03T08:07:00.000Z	fxjr		but the problem is that this are the keyboard shortcut  to change tab in gedit
2008-04-03T08:07:00.000Z	fxjr		s/this/these
2008-04-03T08:07:00.000Z	fxjr		do you know how to disable that behavior from compiz?
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	fxjr		I didn't find anything in the compiz wall plugin to disable it.
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	nickrud	fxjr	I use clt-alt-paggeup/down in compiz to change gedit tabs
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	fxjr	nickrud	jrib where is this shortcut set?
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	fxjr		I even tried advanced search
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	fxjr		and couldn't find anything bind to it.
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	fxjr	it's default in my gedit, I've made no changes to those keybindings
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	fxjr	nickrud	yes. it is the default shortcut of gedit. the problem is that I want to disable in compiz
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	fxjr	erm, Ignore me for now, I'm doing this in beta
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	fxjr		because now I can't change tabs in gedit.
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	fxjr	nickrud	beta? 8.04?
2008-04-03T08:10:00.000Z	fxjr		I'm using 8.04 too.
2008-04-03T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	fxjr	. Can't discuss it here ;)
