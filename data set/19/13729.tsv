2006-06-06T13:25:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		doesnt ctrl+c/ctrl+p copypaste in linux?
2006-06-06T13:26:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	depends on the app
2006-06-06T13:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	GNU/Linux systems have 3 separate copy and paste buffers.  the first one is in text mode using a program called GPM.  the second one is in graphics mode (X) when you drag your mouse over any text, it is copied as soon as you highlight it, use Middle-click to paste that buffer
2006-06-06T13:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	the third buffer is the application one, which is up to the app how to assign.  most use Ctrl+C for that buffer to copy, and Ctrl+V to paste.
2006-06-06T13:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	if you try to paste into a terminal window, it normally only uses the second style of buffer, so Ctrl+V won't work.  use middle-click (or shift+insert ususally does the same)
2006-06-06T13:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	the only problem with that highlight-to-copy buffer is as soon as the window where it is highlighted is closed, the buffer is deleted
2006-06-06T13:29:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	there are also many apps that will automatically duplicate the two X buffers.  so if you copy with Ctrl+C, it copies it to the middle-click buffer, and vice versa
2006-06-06T13:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	and there are apps for Gnome and KDE which do the same at all times, by monitoring the buffers for changes and syncing them
2006-06-06T13:31:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	the older style buffer was the one that was always used, drag-to-copy, middle-click-to-paste .. but it is lost the instant that window closes.  so it is very annoying to work with (pop up an ID3 tag info in XMMS, copy the track title, close the dialog, try to paste it and you can't), so they started using the other method
2006-06-06T13:31:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	problem is many older apps, especially terminals, only support the drag-to-copy buffer
2006-06-06T13:32:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	another example is the old "xfontsel" app
2006-06-06T13:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	Ctrl+<any letter> is sent directly to the console.  it has to be, or you can't operate console based apps
2006-06-06T13:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	text mode relies heavily on control characters
2006-06-06T13:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	just configure one of the clipboard tools for Gnome or KE which will monitor your clipboards and synchronise them
2006-06-06T13:36:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	that way you can paste with middle-click or application-method at any time
2006-06-06T13:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	no.  as I said, either the application chooses the method (anything the app wants) for the application-buffer, or it is the drag-to-select/middle-click-to-paste
2006-06-06T13:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	those are the two copy/paste buffers
2006-06-06T13:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	get used to the drag-to-select method, it is far faster than Windows copy and paste methods, and works in nearly every app
2006-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Scorpmoon	if you need apps to only use Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V, then only use official Gnome or KDE apps, and set up the terminal to use Ctrl+V as a shortcut for paste
