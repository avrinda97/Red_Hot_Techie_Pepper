2006-08-22T11:24:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	yes
2006-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	Jenga	KrakensDen	how does it compare to Xfce?
2006-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	well, it may be a bit of a shock
2006-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	it has a root window menu and dock support
2006-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	Jenga		pretty bare eh?
2006-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	and that's about it ;)
2006-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	Jenga		no
2006-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	although it has a fairly cool feature where you can have dynamic menus
2006-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	Jenga		haven't use flux. heard it's clunky
2006-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	never really found a use for it though
2006-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	it's very, very minimalist. Try it if you don't scare easy
2006-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	right click gets you a menu, and download obconf too :)
2006-08-22T11:27:00.000Z	Jenga		I'm just looking for a way to stop hanging and crashing so much and I like a minimalist look
2006-08-22T11:27:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	it may be your hardware
2006-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	linux is very intolerant of bad hardware
2006-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	Jenga		Pretty sure it is the hardware but max memory is 256 and I have that already
2006-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	give it a try, you might like it
2006-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	Jenga		thanks. think I will now
2006-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Jenga	but 'some configuration needed' will apply ;)
