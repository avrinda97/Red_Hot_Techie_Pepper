2008-02-03T15:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	lollo	 only tings installed with the package manager will show up in the package manager. Dependign on where you isntalled the game to. You just delete its files.
2008-02-03T15:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	lollo	 if you installed it to  like your users home/games directory you cold just delete the install dir.
2008-02-03T15:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	lollo	  as far as i know. If your user isntalled then its all in your home somewhere.
2008-02-03T16:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	lollo	 you rarely need to 'clean; the hard disk, everyting is in your users home dir.. or else they are system files. and you should leave those alone.
