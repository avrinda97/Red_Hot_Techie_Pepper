2009-11-19T11:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Blue1	your way behind lol -- the one in the Ubuntu repo has been broken for weeks http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-facebookchat/ and install the 1.63 deb and you should be good to go.  OH YA, uninstall one from Repo first and you also have to logout after the new install before it seems to work?
2009-11-19T11:23:00.000Z	Blue1	ZykoticK9	okay so where am I getting the new version?
2009-11-19T11:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Blue1	from that code.google.com link i sent
