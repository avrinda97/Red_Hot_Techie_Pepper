2007-02-13T06:38:00.000Z	Zirg	kurt_	your permissions are borqd!  the dir is owned by root and you have no rights to it.
2007-02-13T06:38:00.000Z	Zirg	kurt_	unmount it, to begin with, change ownership, then mount it and lets see what we see.
2007-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	Zirg	kurt_	sorry, just saw that. Yes,  chown   is what you want.
2007-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	Zirg	kurt_	man chown  to see the syntax and capabilities.
2007-02-13T06:40:00.000Z	Zirg	kurt_	man chown    Bugs. :-)  Get used to looking at those MANual pages. It will save you a lot of grief later in life.
2007-02-13T06:42:00.000Z	Zirg	kurt_	good, remount the partition.
