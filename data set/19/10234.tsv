2008-12-02T18:40:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	Anyone what? :)
2008-12-02T18:57:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/OSX+Session+Login?content=68346
2008-12-02T18:57:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	I think this is the one you are looking for
2008-12-02T19:00:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	Download the file, extract it's contents, and copy the theme with it's directory to /usr/share/gdm/themes
2008-12-02T19:04:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	Ok, first, download the file. http://www.deviantart.com/download/104918045/Apple_Mac_OSX_Session_Login_by_onedread.gz ,
2008-12-02T19:05:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	Wait, you are right, something is not right
2008-12-02T19:05:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	it seems it is not a generic GDM theme, let me find out what it is
2008-12-02T19:05:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	ok, download the file first
2008-12-02T19:06:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	then run gzip -d Apple_Mac_OSX_Session_Login_by_onedread.gz
2008-12-02T19:06:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	you will get a file, named Apple_Mac_OSX_Session_Login_by_onedread
2008-12-02T19:06:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	This is a tar file
2008-12-02T19:06:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	you can extract the tar file using tar -xf Apple_Mac_OSX_Session_Login_by_onedread
2008-12-02T19:08:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	follow ndlovu's link... when you have the file, and ungzipped and untarred it, you will get a directory called "osx-login"... you8 have to copy this whole directory to /usr/share/gdm/themes
2008-12-02T19:14:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	move that directory to /usr/share/gdm/themes
2008-12-02T19:15:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	and please address your questions to a person using his/her name so your questions won't get lost...
2008-12-02T19:18:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	You again have forget to adress your questions directly to one person. You need to edit the file: /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
2008-12-02T19:19:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	No, sorry, edit /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom
2008-12-02T19:20:00.000Z	norbert79	alex_21	Modify the line: GraphicalTheme= and write the name after = osx-login. So the right entry will be: GraphicalTheme=osx-login
