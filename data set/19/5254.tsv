2008-12-09T11:54:00.000Z	n8tuser		peeps_-> and you just want to add another partition to be mounted at boot?
2008-12-09T11:54:00.000Z	n8tuser		creek23-> i dont really know the proper procedures, perhaps ask one of the ops here..
2008-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	n8tuser		CyBurnett-> how are you mounting it now? whats your command?
2008-12-09T11:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		peeps_-> then add them one by one, make sure you add your / and /home if they were in separate partitions
2008-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	n8tuser		CyBurnett-> a good time now to learn command line , do some linux tutorials  please
2008-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	n8tuser		peeps_-> not really, it has to be done manually
2008-12-09T11:58:00.000Z	n8tuser		CyBurnett-> doing a tutorial on linux is really helpful, if you want to be specific, look for mounting file system tutorials
2008-12-09T11:59:00.000Z	n8tuser		carrot9-> what? you meant your compiled kernel  does a kernel panic when you boot?
2008-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	n8tuser		CyBurnett-> maybe its quickest if you can do a search via goggle
2008-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	n8tuser		google*
2008-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	yes, enter a shell for /dev/diskbyuuid/ff0..... missing. But the disk_uuid works on 8.10 default kernel.
2008-12-09T12:01:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	I compiled the kernel 3 times,  even I do the config file default(unedited).
2008-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	yes, copy config-2.6.27.10-genric from /boot
2008-12-09T12:03:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	maybe the disk_uuid not supplied by ubuntu kernel config file?
2008-12-09T12:04:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	I do the make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers. I think it would install them by default?
2008-12-09T12:04:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	and dpkg -i *.deb
2008-12-09T12:05:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	u think I must copy the vmlinuz file ?
2008-12-09T12:07:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	And I have be compiling the kernel cost 4.3GB free harddisk space. It's right?
2008-12-09T12:08:00.000Z	carrot9	n8tuser	thanks. I'll try again. ^_^
