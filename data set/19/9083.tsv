2007-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	then back up all of your data
2007-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	why not?
2007-10-01T13:39:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	i'd suggest finding one beforehand then. if this data is that sensitive it NEEDS to be backed up
2007-10-01T13:40:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	if it's company data i'd back it up regardless of how unimportant it may be
2007-10-01T13:41:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	how much data is it you want to keep?
2007-10-01T13:49:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	ok look seriously. Wubi is not really going to help you. My best and only suggestion to you is to spend a few bucks to invest in a second hard drive to back up your data. Once you've done that I'd be willing to help you more.

2007-10-01T14:00:00.000Z	vulcanius	TV-VCR	no, it's commercial software
