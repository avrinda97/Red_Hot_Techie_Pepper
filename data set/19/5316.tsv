2008-07-24T09:03:00.000Z	pabix		[question] ! I am connected with “ssh -X” to a computer, but when I try to execute a graphical command, it displays “Error: no display specified”
2008-07-24T09:03:00.000Z	pabix		How do I know the number of my display?
2008-07-24T09:04:00.000Z	doje	pabix	probably the DISPLAY environment var isn't set properly
2008-07-24T09:04:00.000Z	pabix	doje	actually it is empty
2008-07-24T09:04:00.000Z	pabix		but I don't know what to set
2008-07-24T09:05:00.000Z	pabix		I have tried with DISPLAY=:0.0 firefox, and I guess it has displayed on the remote machine
2008-07-24T09:05:00.000Z	doje	pabix	google ssh and DISPLAY and you'll probably find it
2008-07-24T09:05:00.000Z	doje	pabix	I think you might need the target machine name in it
2008-07-24T09:05:00.000Z	pabix		oh, ok
2008-07-24T09:06:00.000Z	doje	pabix	I'm about 2 days new to ubuntu though
2008-07-24T09:07:00.000Z	doje	pabix	when I ssh -X and echo $DISPLAY  I get localhost:10.0
2008-07-24T09:07:00.000Z	pabix		ok
2008-07-24T09:08:00.000Z	pabix		I will try sth like this
2008-07-24T09:08:00.000Z	doje	pabix	not sure why it's "10" though
2008-07-24T09:08:00.000Z	pabix	doje	what happens if you type "who"?
2008-07-24T09:09:00.000Z	doje	pabix	what are you looking for ?  I have "me  :0  datetime (console)"
2008-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	pabix		I am looking for a :10
2008-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	doje	pabix	 and "me  pts/0  datetime (192.168.0.2)"
2008-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	doje	pabix	where 2.2 is the machine i'm at physically
