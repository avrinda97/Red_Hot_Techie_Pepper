2005-07-07T06:27:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	i have read that it's a bad idea to use backports as it can cause dependency problems
2005-07-07T06:27:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	I'm willing to take the chance. But at least I got newer versions of my software (example: GAIM)
2005-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	ok then.  just thought i'd point it out.
2005-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	 thnx though :P
2005-07-07T06:30:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	LOL
2005-07-07T06:47:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	don't spam the chan :)
2005-07-07T06:47:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	yeah, sorry :)
2005-07-07T06:52:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	he still wants the option of booting into a DE. :)
2005-07-07T09:35:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	i guess you don't get many movies with dutch subtitles?
2005-07-07T09:37:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	I also get a lot of dutch subtitles, but I rather read the english ones
2005-07-07T09:39:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	do you get those old kungfu movies dubbed in german/dutch?  i'm wondering if they are as badly dubbed as the english ones. :)
2005-07-07T09:43:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	I watched 1 kungfumovie once in german... for 1 minute.... I'd rather watch the english dubbed, or chinese subbed ("Unleashed" subbed was GREAT, by the way)
2005-07-07T09:54:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	i use it's sound fix everytime i reinstall....then again, i'm 100% certain on what it all means...
2005-07-07T09:55:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	what kind of 'sound fix' do you need? (and why do you say "everytime I reinstall".... that sounds nasty)
2005-07-07T09:56:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	hehe. multiple sounds etc.
2005-07-07T09:58:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	and about the reinstalls, one was my fault, one was when the packaging system completely borked, another was when i was having a logging out problem.
2005-07-07T09:58:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	damn. That's just plain evil. I thought reinstalling so much was a windows thingie
2005-07-07T10:00:00.000Z	reka	_SWAT_	well to be fair, with the exception of that packaging instance, i could probably have fixed the system if i was eager enough.
2005-07-11T07:12:00.000Z	_SWAT_	reka	the same thing happened to me. I wanted to install ubuntu, so I burned the cd myself. 1 Day later, the Ubuntu discs arrived :-/
