2008-10-13T23:47:00.000Z	amenado		paul68--> thats not overly difficult to do, two separate services, routing and dhcp serving
2008-10-13T23:48:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	 if you know how it is easy
2008-10-13T23:48:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	can I msg you?
2008-10-13T23:50:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	yes I do have them and both are installed under ubuntu
2008-10-13T23:51:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	my current config is a isp modem router server (with dhcp dns lamp fileserver webserver and ftp) and I want to change places withthe router and server
2008-10-13T23:51:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	ok
2008-10-13T23:53:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	I guess not since the eth0 is getting its IP from the isp
2008-10-13T23:54:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	its the gateway 192.168.1.1
2008-10-13T23:56:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	the router has currently a fix IP and then is the server running as dhcp the router is also controling the wireless part
2008-10-13T23:57:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	its 213.118.188.215
2008-10-13T23:59:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	if I understand you correctly the 213 is comming in that file
2008-10-14T00:01:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	what about the netmask
2008-10-14T00:03:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	what about the gateway does it stay the same? do I need to confugure the eth1 also in this file
2008-10-14T00:07:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	hold on not to fast
2008-10-14T00:11:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	ok
2008-10-14T09:46:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	can you check for me if the dhcp part of the next link (in my case 2 nics) is the correct way to set it up with a dns server thanks in advance http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=119787
2008-10-14T09:52:00.000Z	paul68	amenado	oeps my mistake got so many links and reading them first before taking action, but the first part of the dhcp config it lists out all the subnet and stuff, if modify my dhcp conf will it be sufficient for the dhcp part
