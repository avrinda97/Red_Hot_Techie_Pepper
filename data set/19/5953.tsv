2008-04-11T08:47:00.000Z	Shuggle		my laptop just powered down without notice. how can i find out what happened?
2008-04-11T08:47:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	ask it?
2008-04-11T08:48:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	seriously: was it running on battery and batt went dead?
2008-04-11T08:48:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	overheating?
2008-04-11T08:49:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	will it power back up?
2008-04-11T08:49:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	 yeah, i'm on it now
2008-04-11T08:50:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	it's like nothing happened
2008-04-11T08:50:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	I'd put my money on a hardware issue
2008-04-11T08:50:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	or was the laptop sitting idle when it happened?
2008-04-11T08:50:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	 i just got it replaced from the factory :(
2008-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	send it back
2008-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	no, i was watching something on flash and instant messaging
2008-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	how about putting any Linux cd in it, boot from it, and run a mem test? those are nice 'n lengthy, and make the system work
2008-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	see what happens
2008-04-11T08:52:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	i've done that once already (i don't trust cheap ram). do you think that it would change anything, other than heating it up?
2008-04-11T08:53:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	nope, mem-test won't affect hardware or software
2008-04-11T08:53:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	i meant, would you think that my ram might have gone bad since the test
2008-04-11T08:54:00.000Z	tuxus	Shuggle	It could be. Any hardware can fail, however, mem-test would not have CAUSED it to become bad
2008-04-11T08:55:00.000Z	Shuggle	tuxus	well, i guess i'll be gone for a bit. i'm really unhappy with hp laptops
