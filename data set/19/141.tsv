2012-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	robbie		how can I set up dhcp but still use a static ip? (static IP with dhcp for dns, etc)
2012-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	does ur router have address reservatio ?
2012-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	yes
2012-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	then use it, setup dhcp on the ubuntu box and have it reserve an address on the router
2012-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	its called "static ip address allocation" on my router
2012-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	I do that but the machine keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every few seconds
2012-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	that is *not* the right answer, ufortunately
2012-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	idk is it wifi ?
2012-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	nop :) thats where most of the help pages go though.. :)
2012-10-29T09:51:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	so no idea how to set up dhcp *with* static ip
2012-10-29T09:53:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	what is ur net connection, cable ?
2012-10-29T09:54:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	is ur connection to the net cable ?
2012-10-29T09:54:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	yes
2012-10-29T09:55:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	so then just use static, and for the dns address you use the routers IP
2012-10-29T09:55:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	no I cant do that, the router keeps hanging up if I do
2012-10-29T09:56:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	they just sent a replacement .. it cant be faulty
2012-10-29T09:56:00.000Z	Erin	robbie	is the router/modem one machine ?
2012-10-29T09:56:00.000Z	robbie	Erin	yes
