2006-02-19T17:48:00.000Z	foxpaul		does anyone have an idea what might be going wrong here? i'm trying to setup a mail server, but when ever i try to send mail to anywhere, the recipients server refuses the connection
2006-02-19T17:50:00.000Z	_mindspin	foxpaul	that's a little too unspecific
2006-02-19T17:51:00.000Z	_mindspin		mono?
2006-02-19T17:52:00.000Z	_mindspin		c# is .net isnt it?
2006-02-19T17:53:00.000Z	_mindspin		what else can run c#?
2006-02-19T17:54:00.000Z	_mindspin		;-)
2006-02-19T17:56:00.000Z	_mindspin		thought it goes like #c
2006-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	_mindspin		ignore is cool
2006-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	foxpaul	_mindspin	i'm not very useful at this level of linux admin :) which specifics do you think would help debug the problem?
2006-02-19T06:01:00.000Z	_mindspin	foxpaul	 "/var/mail.info" would be a start if you are using postfix
2006-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	_mindspin		what do want to with the mailserver
2006-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	_mindspin		oops "/var/log/mail.info
2006-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	_mindspin		oops "/var/log/mail.info"
2006-02-19T06:05:00.000Z	_mindspin		who's interface?
2006-02-19T06:05:00.000Z	_mindspin		:-)
2006-02-19T06:05:00.000Z	foxpaul	_mindspin	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8645
2006-02-19T06:06:00.000Z	_mindspin		interface is german?
2006-02-19T06:06:00.000Z	_mindspin		no his level in english says 14
2006-02-19T06:08:00.000Z	_mindspin	foxpaul	I have no glue on sendmail, I would switch to postfix...
