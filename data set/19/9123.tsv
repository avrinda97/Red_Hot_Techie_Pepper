2007-08-20T06:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dgeorge	then you don't have flash installed properly
2007-08-20T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dgeorge	download it from adobe.com and follow the instructions.
2007-08-20T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dgeorge	well, i can't tell you what you're doing wrong, because i've downloaded/installed off adobe's site a zillion times w/o issue.
2007-08-20T06:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dgeorge	are you using feisty or dapper/edgy?

2007-08-20T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dgeorge	to upgrade to feisty, you'd have to either do a clean install of feisty, or upgrade to edgy, then upgrade edgy to Feisty
