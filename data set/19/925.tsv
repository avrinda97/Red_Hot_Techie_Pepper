2011-12-07T08:56:00.000Z	danny	somsip	i am starting tomorrow
2011-12-07T08:57:00.000Z	somsip	danny	yeah, yeah, yeah :)
2011-12-07T08:57:00.000Z	danny	somsip	i dont no what language to learn first
2011-12-07T08:58:00.000Z	somsip	danny	what is your goal? I hear good things about python
2011-12-07T08:59:00.000Z	somsip	danny	then I might suggest PHP to get a founding in programming techniques. not very exciting though
2011-12-07T08:59:00.000Z	danny	somsip	ok i will try it
2011-12-07T09:02:00.000Z	somsip	danny	- can you touch type?
2011-12-07T09:02:00.000Z	danny	somsip	maybe if i knew what that is
2011-12-07T09:03:00.000Z	somsip	danny	typing without having to look at the keyboard. If you're going to program, it's a good skill to learn from the start.
2011-12-07T09:03:00.000Z	danny	somsip	lol yea i can do that
2011-12-07T09:32:00.000Z	somsip	danny	/me does something, but it's not really encourage on a support channel
2011-12-07T09:33:00.000Z	somsip	danny	yes. It does get offtopic around this time of day as I believe it's late in the west, but when it's busy, the ops don't tolerate chatter that makes it difficult to focus on support
2011-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	somsip	danny	hence polite requests for inconsiderates to avoid useless comments
2011-12-07T09:41:00.000Z	somsip	danny	hence polite requests for inconsiderates to avoid useless comments
2011-12-07T09:42:00.000Z	somsip	danny	#ubuntu-offtopic maybe?
