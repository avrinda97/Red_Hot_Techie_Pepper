2005-06-29T11:21:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	what media player do you use?  there are also ways to get totem to play imbeded media that work well.
2005-06-29T11:22:00.000Z	Jesse1	abbot45	i use totem at the moment but will change to any that lets me play the streams
2005-06-29T11:23:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	i use totem as well.
2005-06-29T11:26:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	look for a firefox extension called MediaPlayerConnectivity.  It will allow you to play web imbeded media in your media player outside of your browser.
2005-06-29T11:26:00.000Z	Jesse1	abbot45	ok ill look for that
2005-06-29T11:27:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	where you have a grey box will turn into a box that you click on which will play it in your media player.
2005-06-29T11:29:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	also, if you would rather keep the media embeded while using totem, this guide shows you how to set that up.  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=17727&highlight=totem+embeded
2005-06-29T11:30:00.000Z	Jesse1	abbot45	ok ill read that aswell
2005-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	Jesse1	abbot45	hey it seems to work but i get this error No URI handler implemented for "mms://a1319.v03264.c326.g.vm.akamaistream.net/7/1319/326/42837b1d/bmgent.download.akamai.com/326/rcarecords.com/foo_fighters/audio/best_of_you_96.wma"
2005-06-29T11:47:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	well, unfortunately linux doesnt handle windows media too well.  especially the newer stuff.  i dont know how to help you with that.
2005-06-29T11:57:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	you probably just need the codecs.
2005-06-29T11:59:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	are you using the w32codecs from the repository?  if you are then you need to make sure you are using totem-xine rather than just regular totem.
2005-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	^^^^
2005-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	Jesse1	abbot45	yea ive got the win32 codec's
2005-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	abbot45	Jesse1	those will only work with totem-xine.
2005-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	Jesse1	abbot45	i see
