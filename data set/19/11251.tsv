2006-03-03T08:22:00.000Z	SirGrok		Hello everyone. My wireless internet only works half the time (I am always within range), and I don't seem to be doing anything differently between each attempt. It will work for about a week, and then not work for a week.
2006-03-03T08:22:00.000Z	SirGrok		I am on KDE
2006-03-03T08:23:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	have you looked at the wireless tools such as iwconfig
2006-03-03T08:24:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	No, I've use wifi-radar, and that has given me success sometimes, but not all the time. I will check out iwconfig
2006-03-03T08:25:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	is iwconfig in the repositories?
2006-03-03T08:25:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	I think it's actually built in - try the command line
2006-03-03T08:26:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	see http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html
2006-03-03T08:27:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	thanks. It looks like it will be able to do the trick
2006-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	thanks for the help. I am going to go see if this works (will disconnect from IRC) I will be back in a bit. Thanks again.
2006-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	I get the error "Set fialed on device eth0; Opperation not permitted"
2006-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	what command gave that error?
2006-03-03T08:35:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	sorry I can't give you specific advice about that except to point you to Google
2006-03-03T08:35:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	Thanks for the help anywho
2006-03-03T08:36:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	I do have another question though..... If there is a Linux equivant to windows drivers, what are they, where can they be obtained and where are they on my system? (WOW that was a mouthful).
2006-03-03T08:36:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	Ubuntu is pretty smart about wireless.  I had a problem today that I thought was complicated but turned out I was connected to the wrong SSID
2006-03-03T08:37:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	I think that I am going to reformat and install an new wireless card (I have a new harddrive and wireless card next to me.... just ahven't gone through the effort)
2006-03-03T08:38:00.000Z	ttread	SirGrok	many wireless card drivers are loaded as modules, usually you find what you need in the repository if it's not installed already
2006-03-03T08:38:00.000Z	SirGrok	ttread	gracias mi amor. I am going to go work on fixing this now.
