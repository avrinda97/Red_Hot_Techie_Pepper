2007-02-19T09:10:00.000Z	kubota		Okay then.. Different question, Sound Juicer is only ripping my CD @ 1.2x ..It is supposed to be around 52x
2007-02-19T09:10:00.000Z	kubota		Is it possible to fix that

2007-02-19T09:10:00.000Z	kjon	kubota	try something like hdparm -d1u1 /dev/hdc
2007-02-19T09:10:00.000Z	kubota	kjon	I'm not sure
2007-02-19T09:11:00.000Z	kjon	kubota	as root, try hdparm -d1u1 /dev/hdc.
