2007-02-17T17:57:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	yes a really linux friendly one
2007-02-17T17:58:00.000Z	Quintin	iturk	what chipset
2007-02-17T17:59:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	Intersil Corporation Intersil ISL3890 [Prism GT/Prism Duette]  (rev 01)
2007-02-17T06:00:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	the driver for it its activated in the kernel
2007-02-17T06:00:00.000Z	Quintin	iturk	iwlist wlan0 scanning
2007-02-17T06:00:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	no results
2007-02-17T06:00:00.000Z	Quintin	iturk	and you are near an AP?
2007-02-17T06:01:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	people in my house are all conected to wireless
2007-02-17T06:01:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	i am the only one using cable now
2007-02-17T06:04:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	and the light of the board its green sometimes so the problem its not the pcmcia i think
2007-02-17T06:08:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	by the way i am using kernel 2.6.19 so wireless extensions its WE-19 so wireless-tools should work fine
2007-02-17T06:10:00.000Z	Quintin	iturk	I'm lost if you don't get anything from above..  sudo su and then iwlist scanning should show something
2007-02-17T06:12:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	after i install wireless-tools i dont have iwconfig working but iwlist its installed .. isnt it strange ?
2007-02-17T06:13:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	this doing make and make install of wilress-tools 28
2007-02-17T06:14:00.000Z	Quintin	iturk	building from source makes it a lot harder to give support
2007-02-17T06:15:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	from apt the version its 19 and my driver in the kernel its prepared to work with 21 but when i try to compile 21 i get 'C' stange errors
2007-02-17T06:15:00.000Z	Quintin	iturk	I can't support compiling stuff from source.  use the .debs
2007-02-17T06:16:00.000Z	iturk	Quintin	so i deceide to use the latest source 28 which didnt gave any errors in compiling
