2006-04-30T16:07:00.000Z	FearMoth		is there any way to compare two directories for any differences in file contents and directory structure?
2006-04-30T16:08:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	yes
2006-04-30T16:08:00.000Z	FearMoth	mwe	how?
2006-04-30T16:09:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	do you want it to show all files that differ?
2006-04-30T16:09:00.000Z	FearMoth	mwe	yeah, possibly how they differ too if possible
2006-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	^^
2006-04-30T16:11:00.000Z	FearMoth	mwe	??
2006-04-30T16:12:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	the diff command in a terminal shows how two files differ
2006-04-30T16:12:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	Do the files have the same names or should they all be compared mutually in all combinations
2006-04-30T16:13:00.000Z	FearMoth	mwe	well I'm going to make a backup of a directory, and install something and then compare the two and see what was modified or if anything was modified
2006-04-30T16:14:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	oh. you should probably use backup software for that
2006-04-30T16:15:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	what you want is called incremental backup
2006-04-30T16:15:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	I think
2006-04-30T16:15:00.000Z	FearMoth	mwe	any software you can recommend?
2006-04-30T16:16:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	tar

2006-04-30T16:16:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	read that and come back if you don't understand it
2006-04-30T16:16:00.000Z	mwe	FearMoth	gotta go, bbl
2006-04-30T16:16:00.000Z	FearMoth	mwe	I was wondering if there's anything that shows files that aren't in the original directory, and then for the rest that are in the directory, just diff them and report if there's any changes?
