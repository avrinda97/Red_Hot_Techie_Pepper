2004-11-09T14:51:00.000Z	will_1		I'm installing ubuntu linux right now and it's taking a really, really long time, 3 hours so far. I don't think it should take this long, I have an Athlon 2600+
2004-11-09T14:51:00.000Z	will_1		can anyone help me speed it up?
2004-11-09T14:52:00.000Z	will_1		at the second stage, the CD is already out
2004-11-09T14:52:00.000Z	will_1		it's doing all the package unpacking, it goes in little spurts
2004-11-09T14:52:00.000Z	will_1		they're all local, nothing is being downloaded
2004-11-09T14:53:00.000Z	will_1		this is the second time the install is running, I'm trying a different filesystem, but nothing is different
2004-11-09T14:54:00.000Z	will_1		the first time I stopped it after 1.5 hours, I said OK to download updates from the net. This time I did not
2004-11-09T14:55:00.000Z	will_1		yes, it's a 7200 RPM drive, seagate. i386
2004-11-09T14:57:00.000Z	stuNNed	will_1	just had a seagate drive die on my like yesterday
2004-11-09T14:57:00.000Z	stuNNed	will_1	ran the smart tests in windows, predicted failure
2004-11-09T14:57:00.000Z	will_1		I've had it for over a year, my windows XP runs off the same drive
2004-11-09T14:58:00.000Z	stuNNed		probly have better luck than me :)
2004-11-09T14:58:00.000Z	will_1		where did you run those tests?
2004-11-09T14:59:00.000Z	stuNNed	will_1	downloaded them from seagate website
2004-11-09T14:59:00.000Z	stuNNed	will_1	where? in windows, there is one for windows (not bootable floppy)

2004-11-09T14:59:00.000Z	will_1		I'm gonna stop it and try it out
2004-11-09T15:01:00.000Z	will_1	stuNNed	I'm just booting into windows to try this out....maybe it is the damn drive
