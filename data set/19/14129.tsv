2005-06-15T10:05:00.000Z	Howitzer		okay
2005-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	start 'synaptic package manager' from System > administration
2005-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	it's really easy to use
2005-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	just read what it tells you, and you'll be able to install anything your heart desires :)
2005-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	also
2005-06-15T10:07:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	but you can use it to install new software too
2005-06-15T10:07:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	just click around in it, you'll find it... also, read www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-06-15T10:07:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	very, very complete guide on 'how to pimp my ubuntu hoary'
2005-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	one word of caution though, it says somewhere to install the 'ubuntu backports' apt source, don't do that
2005-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	it'll probably wreck your system
2005-06-15T10:09:00.000Z	TMM	Howitzer	lucky for you I speak dutch :) there is also #ubuntu-nl
