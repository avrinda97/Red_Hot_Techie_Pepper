2010-04-18T16:51:00.000Z	inglor		Hey, Which is better banshee or rhythmbox? I currently use rhythmbox, is there any good reason to switch?
2010-04-18T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	there is no better or best
2010-04-18T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	its an opinion so is not concrete, why not just try the other player to see which you like
2010-04-18T16:52:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	yes, but the only pros and cons threads in the forums (that I found) were really old. They look really similar in interface
2010-04-18T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	like I said, there is no "better"
2010-04-18T16:53:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	I just want to know what are the pros and cons of each
2010-04-18T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	which is better, coke or pepsi?
2010-04-18T16:53:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	coke
2010-04-18T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	i like pepsi, its all opinion, neither is better than the other
2010-04-18T16:54:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	right, but do you know where I can get a list of objective pros and cons?
2010-04-18T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	you can have both installed, see which you like after a long test and then choose that
2010-04-18T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	developers website will list the features of both, you can see which matches your needs closer
2010-04-19T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	i believe you need timidity
2010-04-19T00:47:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	I got timidity, installed it, but it's giving me trouble
2010-04-19T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=268319 may help
2010-04-19T00:49:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	that's great and all, but my problem is that it doesn't play nice with ALSA
2010-04-19T00:49:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	or at all for that matter
2010-04-19T00:51:00.000Z	inglor	ActionParsnip	omg I feel so stupid right now... I forgot to uncomment the configuration that tells it to use alsa -_-
2010-04-19T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inglor	you got the gold at least dude :D
