2009-03-08T17:46:00.000Z	Kruxeer		hi all :)
2009-03-08T17:46:00.000Z	Kruxeer		I'm in tty1.how can i start a graphic application in tty7?
2009-03-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 you mean force an X app to launch on the X desktop? X is running on tty7 right?
2009-03-08T17:47:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	yeah doctor :)
2009-03-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 theres security settings taht may block that.. but what used to work.. login as same user, use 'export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0 ' then run the app ie: ' xterm & '
2009-03-08T17:49:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	it doesn't work!
2009-03-08T17:50:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	xterm Xt error: Can't open display: localhost:0.0
2009-03-08T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 yep. security stuff may be blocking it.
2009-03-08T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 try 'xhost +'  then the xterm & command..
2009-03-08T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 xhost + is a BAD security idea
2009-03-08T17:51:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	this error > "xhost:  unable to open display "localhost:0.0"
2009-03-08T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 looks like it may be locked down good.. unless you can run that 'xhost +' on the X desktop somehow  then try friom the console
2009-03-08T17:53:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	This error on X machine >"access control disabled, clients can connect from any host"
2009-03-08T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 thats not an error. its a warning :)
2009-03-08T17:54:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	still that error > "xterm Xt error: Can't open display: localhost:0.0"
2009-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 im out of ideas then.. could be the order you are doing the stuff in.. or somtjhing. that is such a security issue. i wouild not be suprised if it wasent locked down
2009-03-08T17:57:00.000Z	Kruxeer	Dr_willis	:-s
2009-03-08T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 try xhost +localhost
2009-03-08T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Kruxeer	 cant get it to do it here either.. been ages since i last tried
