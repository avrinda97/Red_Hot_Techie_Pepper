2007-08-27T12:20:00.000Z	arunkale		ha
2007-08-27T12:21:00.000Z	arunkale		ok, so can you recommend any easy to use IDEs? I mostly work with XHTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP
2007-08-27T12:22:00.000Z	arunkale		alright cosmodad. thanks :)
2007-08-27T12:23:00.000Z	arunkale		alright, will check it out
2007-08-27T12:24:00.000Z	arunkale		is Anjuta IDE good?
2007-08-27T12:25:00.000Z	deramin	arunkale	My favorite IDE.
2007-08-27T12:25:00.000Z	arunkale	deramin	really? should i install it?
2007-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	deramin	arunkale	worth a shot. if you don't like it you can always get rid of it. it's not bells and whistles like Eclipse, but it's fast, has wonderful syntax highlighting, and nicely intigrates the command line
2007-08-27T12:27:00.000Z	arunkale	deramin	that's what i want, i don't really want bells and whistles
2007-08-27T12:27:00.000Z	arunkale	deramin	andi really don't want to use java-based stuff :p
2007-08-27T12:28:00.000Z	deramin	arunkale	my teacher forced me. I begged to have my Anjuta back. it had some pluses (it's better on windows) but it still was too much. Anjuta's very customizable, too
2007-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	arunkale	deramin	how do i go about installing anjuta
2007-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	deramin	arunkale	it should be in add/remove under applications. Under programming. if not, change the "show" menu in the upper right corner to "all available applications" and it'll be there
2007-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	arunkale		alright
2007-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	arunkale		i read it's not in the repos so i didn't check, silly me
2007-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	deramin	arunkale	it is. I stumbled on it there when I first installed it
2007-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	arunkale	deramin	nice. what do you use it for?
2007-08-27T12:34:00.000Z	deramin	arunkale	c++ school projects. but now they force us to use Java and it's not as good as eclipse for large java projects. I want my c++ back....
