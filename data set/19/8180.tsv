2008-07-04T13:32:00.000Z	ripps		Can anybody here give me some bash scripting advice, or a channel where I can get it.
2008-07-04T13:32:00.000Z	unop	ripps	whats the question?
2008-07-04T13:33:00.000Z	ripps	unop	I'm trying to write a script that'll detect when my notification area is loaded before it will launch pidgin
2008-07-04T13:36:00.000Z	unop	ripps	 I'm not sure what the name of the process of the notification-area thingy is -- use ps aux | grep notification  to find out.  but..
2008-07-04T13:37:00.000Z	unop	ripps	this should do you.    while ! pidof notification-area-daemon; do sleep 1; done ; pidgin &
2008-07-04T13:38:00.000Z	ripps	unop	there is no notification-area-daemon in 8.04
2008-07-04T13:39:00.000Z	unop	ripps	i used it as an example - find out what the process is actually called
2008-07-04T13:39:00.000Z	ripps	unop	I can't figure out which one it is
2008-07-04T13:39:00.000Z	unop	ripps	  ps aux | grep -i notification   # how many results do you get returned?
2008-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	ripps	unop	nothing
2008-07-04T13:42:00.000Z	unop	ripps	are you writing a startup script?
2008-07-04T13:43:00.000Z	ripps	unop	pidgin always starts up before the notification area,a nd it fails to started in the system tray. But if it's started after the system tray is loaded, it will start directly as a tray icon.
2008-07-04T13:44:00.000Z	unop	ripps	if it is a startup script you are writing - then this ought to work.  while ! pidof gnome-panel; do sleep 1; done ;  sleep 5 && pidgin &
2008-07-04T13:45:00.000Z	unop	ripps	just make sure you disable pidgin from automatically starting up already - by some other means - otherwise you will have two instances of pidgin starting up
2008-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	ripps	unop	I plan on replacing it with the script.
2008-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	unop	ripps	right, that ought to do then
2008-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	ripps	unop	thanks, I'll check to see if this works with another program I can stop then start to see if it works.
2008-07-04T13:49:00.000Z	ripps	unop	it worked with the mixer_applet2. I'll check to see if it works with gnome-panel after reboot.
2008-07-04T13:58:00.000Z	ripps	unop	gnome-panel was too soon. I think i'll have it start up with the volume mixer. It seems to be one of the last programs to load
