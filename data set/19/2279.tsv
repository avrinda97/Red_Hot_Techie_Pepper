2010-05-11T05:20:00.000Z	bedwyr		someone, too
2010-05-11T05:20:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	bedwyr	darn! :( ubottu is not having a good day atm
2010-05-11T05:20:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	Hmm... maybe OpenAl is too new? I personally know nothing about it
2010-05-11T05:21:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	I have actually did my best to walk MistaDizz through the installation process, but beyond that is beyond my knowledge
2010-05-11T05:22:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	bedwyr	gotcha.  I'm hoping someone around is better with OpenAL than you or I :)
2010-05-11T05:23:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	hopefully there is! or maybe the forum/forum irc channel has
2010-05-11T05:30:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	maybe check this? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openal/+bug/194919
2010-05-11T05:31:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	bedwyr	he has libopenal1 NOT libopenal0
2010-05-11T05:32:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	well, I was merely looking to give you something to look into
2010-05-11T05:49:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	bedwyr	Torcs seems to exonerate OpenAL per se
2010-05-11T05:51:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	let me get my dictionary on that word "exonerate"
2010-05-11T05:51:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	oh, Torcs runs fine?
2010-05-11T05:52:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	bedwyr	yeah, sound and everything
2010-05-11T05:52:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	well, I really don't know what to say. i remember MistaDizz pasting something that mentionned background problem
2010-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	"Couldn't locate resource Examine Background in the current skin"
2010-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	bedwyr	that's a spurious message
2010-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	bedwyr	HTT-Bird	ack.
