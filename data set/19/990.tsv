2011-06-23T07:40:00.000Z	Padge		sorry if anyone answered and I was gone.  I have an Ubuntu box with two NICs, but only one interface is showing up with ifconfig
2011-06-23T07:41:00.000Z	Padge		My router is giving me shit, and I'm trying to get my Ubuntu box to do that job.
2011-06-23T07:41:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	Language, plz.
2011-06-23T07:41:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	So your router is giving you poop. :-)
2011-06-23T07:41:00.000Z	Padge	Corey	Sorry
2011-06-23T07:41:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	You using networkmanager?
2011-06-23T07:47:00.000Z	Padge	Corey	I have no such program, evidently
2011-06-23T07:54:00.000Z	Padge	Corey	I do'nt have networkmanager, I guess.  Should I get it during one of my brief connected periods?
2011-06-23T07:56:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	I'd not.
2011-06-23T07:56:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	Configure /etc/network/interfaces properly and it should "just work."
2011-06-23T07:57:00.000Z	Padge	Corey	I think I have a driver issue.  Would ifconfig show all my interfaces regardless of whether they're configured to be used?
2011-06-23T07:57:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	no, ifconfig -a might.
2011-06-23T07:57:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	And dmesg to a pastebin would help too.
2011-06-23T07:59:00.000Z	Padge	Corey	ifconfig -a only shows lo and eth0.  http://pastebin.com/3Nfv88Cs
2011-06-23T08:01:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	And lspci may help as well.
2011-06-23T08:01:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	Looks like it's only got eth0 configured.
2011-06-23T08:02:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	What's your desired goal?
2011-06-23T08:03:00.000Z	Padge	Corey	http://pastebin.com/xw3wgT86
2011-06-23T08:04:00.000Z	Corey	Padge	Yeah, all I see is that realtek controller.
