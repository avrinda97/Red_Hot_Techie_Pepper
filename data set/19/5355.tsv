2010-03-12T16:42:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	rt kernels are slower than normal kernels
2010-03-12T16:42:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	then what would make a kernel get more fps in wine?
2010-03-12T16:43:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	it mostly depends on the videocard driver
2010-03-12T16:43:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	no
2010-03-12T16:43:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	so for nvidia cards is there some secret driver that gets better fps?
2010-03-12T16:43:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	no
2010-03-12T16:44:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	no it dosent matter what the machine is
2010-03-12T16:45:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	realtime is just a guarante that you get stuff done in a certian ammount of time
2010-03-12T16:45:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	and by that is sacrifices things to get them done, meaning a slower overall system
2010-03-12T16:46:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	then would you have any recommendations?  maybe a really short timeslice?
2010-03-12T16:46:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	what nvidia driver are you using now?
2010-03-12T16:46:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	read the appDB entry for wow, that should give some hints
2010-03-12T16:47:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	tried everything from 185.x to the very latest which is 190.53
2010-03-12T16:47:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	I've been over that whole thing, tried all the advice there.
2010-03-12T16:47:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	what wine versions have you tried?
2010-03-12T16:47:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	latest version and the 1.x that is in the ubuntu repos
2010-03-12T16:48:00.000Z	rsk	nyaa	and have you tried cleaning .wine/ every now and then?
2010-03-12T16:48:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	I have not tried that, where's .wine/ at?  you mean kust in the home folder?
2010-03-12T16:49:00.000Z	nyaa	rsk	so how do you clean it out? what parts do you take out?
