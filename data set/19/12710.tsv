2005-07-23T08:35:00.000Z	giant		I'm working my way through Spidering Hacksy by Oreilly, and they recommend you contact the site before running your spider/scraper
2005-07-23T08:36:00.000Z	giant		would this include the sites used in the examples in the book?
2005-07-23T08:36:00.000Z	giant		it makes sence that Oreilly would have gotten permission from them beforhand
2005-07-23T08:38:00.000Z	giant		I'm having a problem playing .wmv's with mplayer
2005-07-23T08:39:00.000Z	giant		I've tried installing the codecs and that helped for .mpg's but totem is buggered and mplayer still won't play .wmv's

2005-07-23T08:41:00.000Z	giant	pax	the ones I figured were safe were the ones looking at Oreilly's site and Cpan...
2005-07-23T08:41:00.000Z	pax	giant	I would simply contact the person who wrote the book and ask
