2007-08-13T14:40:00.000Z	Durmant		where is the setting for changing the number of works spaces?
2007-08-13T14:41:00.000Z	Durmant		ya I have them enabled
2007-08-13T14:41:00.000Z	Durmant		but it says I only have 1 workspace
2007-08-13T14:42:00.000Z	Durmant		I have beryl installed
2007-08-13T14:42:00.000Z	Durmant		but now I dont have a title bar on any window :-/
2007-08-13T14:43:00.000Z	Durmant		damn I hate being a noob
2007-08-13T14:44:00.000Z	Durmant		well im going to try and uninstall it real quick.....is compiz like a equivelant?
2007-08-13T14:44:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	Type beryl --replace in a terminal
2007-08-13T14:45:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	if that doens't work, right click the Beryl Manager icon, and, pardon me, i forget the details, but in one of the little menu's, it might have an option for what Window Decorator to use
2007-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	Compiz is more stable, but lacks a few of the feautures Beryl has. HOWEVER, recently, Compiz and Beryl reunited, and formed Compiz-Fusion. I would define Compiz-Fusion as "kickass", but it's harder to install
2007-08-13T14:49:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	did my earlier messages help at all?
2007-08-13T14:50:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	Okay, here's your last ditch option.
2007-08-13T14:51:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	Which one do you want working, Compiz or Beryl?
2007-08-13T14:51:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	in that case, start Desktop Effects and see if it works
2007-08-13T14:55:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	To get the Window Manager working (assuming you have 3D capable video card), open up gConf-Editor with Alt-F2, and by typing "gconf-editor". Go under Apps > Beryl > General > plugins > decoration > allscreens > options, and on the right, for "command", enter gtk-window-decorator
2007-08-13T14:56:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	Then in my above post, change the word "beryl" to "compiz"
2007-08-13T14:59:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	then something's really not working :P restart X with Ctrl Alt Backspace, and don't use compiz or Beryl is all I can say
2007-08-13T15:07:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	the package of packages
2007-08-13T15:07:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Durmant	it wouldn't eliminate any of your data, but all your configurations and stuff would be restored to when you first installed
