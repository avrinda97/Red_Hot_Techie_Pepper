2005-12-07T17:03:00.000Z	khermans		I am running Ubuntu Server 5.10, but it is not upgrading my linux-image-686??  Any ideas?
2005-12-07T17:03:00.000Z	khermans		I have tried aptitude update and upgrade, but it still holds back linux-image-686 and linux-testricted-modules-686!!
2005-12-07T17:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	 what kernel are you running?
2005-12-07T17:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will update kernel image
2005-12-07T17:04:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	is that specific to Ubuntu-Server?
2005-12-07T17:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	 no its debian commands
2005-12-07T17:04:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	i have done it without dist-upgrade on my personal workstations
2005-12-07T17:05:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	i am running 2.6.12-9
2005-12-07T17:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	 im just telling you how i got it
2005-12-07T17:05:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	thats weird because it usually updates without dist-upgrade
2005-12-07T17:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	 if it doesnt upgrade what do you lose 3 secs?
2005-12-07T17:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	 alot has been weird with this kernel
2005-12-07T17:05:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	yes, the point is WHY it doesnt work with normal upgrade
2005-12-07T17:06:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	which kernel?
2005-12-07T17:06:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	maybe i wont upgrade
2005-12-07T17:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	i dont know and the 12-10 kernel
2005-12-07T17:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	 its fine now i think but i had grub issues and couldnt configure it so i reinstalled ubuntu and works fine now
2005-12-07T17:09:00.000Z	khermans	gnomefreak	passwd
2005-12-07T17:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	khermans	for sudo user not user
