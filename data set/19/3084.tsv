2009-10-30T01:41:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	same here
2009-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	checking it out here right now!
2009-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	ok i will be waiting
2009-10-30T01:43:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	my first attempt was a) installing all the propietary stuff with live cd then installing ubuntu --> got into troubles with network etc (can't really install etc)
2009-10-30T01:43:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	now 2nd attempt just finished installing, now checking
2009-10-30T01:48:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	any progress?
2009-10-30T01:50:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	works!
2009-10-30T01:51:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	ok, i *think* that the problem is if you select/activate the propietary drivers *before* installing ubuntu
2009-10-30T01:51:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	i activated only after installing ubuntu
2009-10-30T01:52:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	does it working in your system?
2009-10-30T01:52:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	another thing i changed was that i had a cable internet connection so the propietary driver install went different that time
2009-10-30T01:52:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	it does now, yes (after 2nd install)
2009-10-30T01:53:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	i too used cable connection for installing driver
2009-10-30T01:53:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	all fine now :)
2009-10-30T01:54:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	means i have to go for next install?
2009-10-30T01:54:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	i wasn't able to fix my first install
2009-10-30T01:54:00.000Z	Genscher_	binod	and i am an old ex-gentoo'er ;)
2009-10-30T01:55:00.000Z	binod	Genscher_	ok
