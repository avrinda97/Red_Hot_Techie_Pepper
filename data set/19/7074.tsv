2008-07-16T19:25:00.000Z	St-Lemur		gdm's broken again...it was running fine with the nvidia driver, then I rebooted and now I get the gdm startup sound but just a black screen
2008-07-16T19:26:00.000Z	St-Lemur		I tried replacing the xorg.conf with the xorg.conf.old but that didn't fix it
2008-07-16T19:26:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	nvidia kernel dirver loaded?
2008-07-16T19:26:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	How do I test that?
2008-07-16T19:27:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	with lsmod
2008-07-16T19:27:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	Yes, driver is there
2008-07-16T19:28:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	check your Xorg.0.log then. pastebin it
2008-07-16T19:28:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	Will be tricky, I'm on a text-only interface now.
2008-07-16T19:29:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	one can paste from CLI
2008-07-16T19:29:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	I don't know how to do that
2008-07-16T19:34:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	you don't. you can use a text mode browser to simply upload the file
2008-07-16T19:34:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	I don't understand, upload it to where?
2008-07-16T19:36:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	but for fileupload, pastebin.ca/upload.php
2008-07-16T19:38:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	OK, I figured out how to paste in, but how do I get the URL now? I selected the Paste! link and opened it
2008-07-16T19:42:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/27747/
2008-07-16T19:54:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	http://pastebin.ca/1073424
2008-07-16T19:57:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	Hm, that's odd...on closer examination it looks like gnome is displaying *something*, it's just all in a very very thin line across the top of the monitor
2008-07-16T19:57:00.000Z	wols_	St-Lemur	sync out of range?
2008-07-16T19:58:00.000Z	St-Lemur	wols_	I don't know what that is.
