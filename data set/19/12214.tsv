2007-02-06T06:35:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	don't say things like that, that's nonsense
2007-02-06T06:35:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	what do you mean
2007-02-06T06:35:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	what you just said about the linux sound architecture
2007-02-06T06:36:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	thats what i read? :P
2007-02-06T06:36:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	what you read is circa seven years out of date then.
2007-02-06T06:36:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	maybe so then :P
2007-02-06T06:36:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	i just heard that /dev/dsp cannot be shared
2007-02-06T06:37:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	and i know thats true with my system (becuase it frequently irritates me)
2007-02-06T06:37:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	that's right, but /dev/dsp is part of the OSS concept, which has *long* been overtaken by ALSA
2007-02-06T06:37:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	(although ALSA still emulates OSS)
2007-02-06T06:37:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	thats where AOSS comes in, no/
2007-02-06T06:38:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	you need to configure your sound applications to use ALSA backends instead of OSS/ /dev/dsp
2007-02-06T06:38:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	yes i know but i gave up on doing that - it's just a little annoyance ;)
2007-02-06T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	then don't let your laziness translate into disseminating rubbish about Linux's sound architecture.
2007-02-06T06:39:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	ooo harsh ;)
2007-02-06T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	yes, too harsh
2007-02-06T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	I apologize.
2007-02-06T06:40:00.000Z	Occasus	soundray	no need ;)
2007-02-06T08:09:00.000Z	soundray	Occasus	et cetera
