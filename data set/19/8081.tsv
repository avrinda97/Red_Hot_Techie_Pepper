2008-07-31T07:19:00.000Z	Fezzler		Can I plug guitar into mic or line-in and use Sound Recorder to make crude recording?
2008-07-31T07:19:00.000Z	Fezzler		Sounds muffled now
2008-07-31T07:20:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	it won't sound good, need an amp really
2008-07-31T07:20:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	How does Garage Band do it un-amped?
2008-07-31T07:20:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	Not great, but something
2008-07-31T07:21:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	you can do the same here, fiddle with levels etc, but you will never be very happy with it
2008-07-31T07:21:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	probably go into line-in and put full vol or near on that port
2008-07-31T07:22:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	What Sound Capture driver should I use?
2008-07-31T07:22:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	ALSA or Via
2008-07-31T07:22:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	default?
2008-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	I guess you are right.  You can't record a guitar
2008-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	not satisfactorily without a good input
2008-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	i use http://www.tascam.com/products/us-122.html
2008-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	Upon playback I hear hiss and sound of strings almost in background
2008-07-31T07:35:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	could try the mic input, watch levels
2008-07-31T07:35:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	You ever try a pocket recorder?
2008-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	Like Zoom or Boss
2008-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	ejer	Fezzler	pmed you
2008-07-31T07:38:00.000Z	Fezzler	ejer	I back off
