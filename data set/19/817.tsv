2011-08-20T00:00:00.000Z	Nvrnight		Anyone around that could help me with an ubuntu server problem by chance? I'm pretty sure I must be doing something dumb
2011-08-20T00:01:00.000Z	Nvrnight		ty
2011-08-20T00:02:00.000Z	Nvrnight		I have a script that does "apt-get install apache2", says it cannot find the package, but when I run the same command in the terminal, it finds it just fine
2011-08-20T00:03:00.000Z	Nvrnight		because I want to build my machine up from scratch easily
2011-08-20T00:04:00.000Z	Nvrnight		and possibly new machines identical for different environments
2011-08-20T00:04:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	if you are going to do that you should really use something like puppet or cfengine
2011-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	are you running the script as root? can you pastebin the script?
2011-08-20T00:10:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	I am using root, sudo su before running the script, and the entire script right now is just that one line I put into chat
2011-08-20T00:10:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	also if I add sudo to the command in the script, it doesn't change anything
2011-08-20T00:11:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	not even a shebang?
2011-08-20T00:12:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	the error I get is the same as the error that you would normally get if you spelled the package name wrong
2011-08-20T00:12:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	#!/bin/bash
2011-08-20T00:12:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	got that on the first line
2011-08-20T00:13:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	well apache2 is a meta package.. what about apache2.2-bin or whatever
2011-08-20T00:13:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	I will just apache2.2-bin and see where that goes
2011-08-20T00:14:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	what does "apt-cache search apache2" return?
2011-08-20T00:15:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	a lot of output came from the "apt-cache search apache2"
2011-08-20T00:15:00.000Z	SIFTU	Nvrnight	and is your package listed
2011-08-20T00:16:00.000Z	Nvrnight	SIFTU	don't quite know how to check that, if "apt-get install apache2" works in the terminal, doesn't that mean it is?
