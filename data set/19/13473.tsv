2005-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	dutch? whats it with dutch moving to australia? I've been hearing that a lot lately
2005-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	Holland is full.
2005-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	not where I live :-D
2005-06-06T07:56:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	you just shouldnt live in the cities, move to the countryside. we did that a year ago and it's great here. living in a small village near Amersfoort
2005-06-06T07:56:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	Ha. Where in holland can I drive for 2 hours and be somewhere without _any_ people (and still in holland?)
2005-06-06T07:57:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	Um, I've lived in a small town in de achterhoek for most of my life.
2005-06-06T07:57:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	I just need to take my bike for 20 minutes and I'm in the middle of the forest near Zeist, which is beautiful and silent :)
2005-06-06T07:57:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	ok, thats barren countryside as well :-D
2005-06-06T07:57:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	far more barren then where you are, but still full!
2005-06-06T07:58:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	ah well, I guess I'm just lucky at where I live. it's nice and peaceful here
2005-06-06T07:59:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	Just can't get away from people in holland. even if you find somewhere quiet, chances are someone else will also wander past within 30 mins.
2005-06-06T07:59:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	Drove my wife mental when we lived there :-)
2005-06-06T07:59:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	depends on the weather I guess. I walked around in the forest near Zeist two weeks ago with average weather and walked around for over an hour, not encountering anyone
2005-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	I've been in proper deseret outback now - *that* is proper silence.
2005-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	heh. alrighty
2005-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	yeah, politics has gone a little bit fascist here recently.
2005-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	But they'll probably let you migrate if you're white and educated.
2005-06-06T08:05:00.000Z	cthulfuego	skoop	it's only 4 hours away and nice & cheap ;-)
2005-06-06T08:05:00.000Z	skoop	cthulfuego	for you, yes :-D
