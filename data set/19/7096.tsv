2009-07-30T23:17:00.000Z	danhs		If I want to sync up my work and home computer, can I just have them rsync my /home directory?
2009-07-30T23:17:00.000Z	danhs		what's a *safe* way to do that
2009-07-30T23:17:00.000Z	danhs		especially since they're very different hardware
2009-07-30T23:17:00.000Z	jrib	danhs	I love unison for that
2009-07-30T23:18:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	did you find unison conflicts a pain?
2009-07-30T23:18:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	I used it for a while, but unison had strange conflicts always and it was like ugggh
2009-07-30T23:18:00.000Z	jrib	danhs	haven't really run into it no, I usually run unison as soon as I startup so it just pulls my latest changes
2009-07-30T23:19:00.000Z	danhs		hmmmm
2009-07-30T23:19:00.000Z	jrib	danhs	I'm using it to sync my desktop and laptop
2009-07-30T23:19:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	does it have rollback like subversion or other revision control?
2009-07-30T23:19:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	that'd be quite nice
2009-07-30T23:20:00.000Z	jrib	danhs	not aware of such a thing.  I do know you can tell it to perform automatic backups
2009-07-30T23:20:00.000Z	danhs		hmmm
2009-07-30T23:21:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	you don't have issues cause of diffferent hardware or anything like that?
2009-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	jrib	danhs	no, but I spent a good deal of time choosing the right ignores at first.  I don't even use the same distro ;)
2009-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	also, if I forget to sync before I leave home or leave work for the day....
2009-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	danhs		:-p
2009-07-30T23:23:00.000Z	jrib	danhs	but if you are just syncing your home, hardware shouldn't be an issue at all.  I can only think of a handful of files that you would have to ignore
2009-07-30T23:23:00.000Z	danhs	jrib	true
