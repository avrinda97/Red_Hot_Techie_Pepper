2011-09-20T19:00:00.000Z	sburwood1		What is the best choice in wifi in USB?
2011-09-20T19:00:00.000Z	sburwood1		and, if I'm on the wrong channel, tell me where to go for that question
2011-09-20T19:01:00.000Z	usr13	sburwood1	Is this a Desktop or Laptop?
2011-09-20T19:02:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	I have a desktop and an EEE PC.  I'm talking about the desktop, as I plan on forgetting wired connection - it costs too much where I live.
2011-09-20T19:02:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	And using the unprotected wifi in the area where I live
2011-09-20T19:03:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	Besides, the EEE has problems
2011-09-20T19:05:00.000Z	usr13	sburwood1	Why not use a PCI or PCIE wifi device.  (USB is not as good.)
2011-09-20T19:06:00.000Z	usr13	sburwood1	To tell the truth, I've not used any of the USB devices....
2011-09-20T19:06:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	Ok, I'm game, but what kind would work the best?  I bought a D-Link Wifi key (USB), but it doesn't work
2011-09-20T19:07:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	direct me towards something that is good but NOT expensive
2011-09-20T19:07:00.000Z	usr13	sburwood1	If you bought it on eBay, just sell it again and buy another.
2011-09-20T19:07:00.000Z	sburwood1		I got it from Pixmania
2011-09-20T19:07:00.000Z	usr13	sburwood1	PCI or PCIE ?
2011-09-20T19:07:00.000Z	sburwood1		I don't know
2011-09-20T19:07:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	hold on, I don't know if I have PCI-E
2011-09-20T19:08:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	I bought the quad core 2.4G computer on e-bay
2011-09-20T19:08:00.000Z	usr13	sburwood1	Look inside and see what kind of available shots it has.  (The long ones or short ones.)
2011-09-20T19:09:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	It's inside the desk slot.  Is there a command line thing to tell me what I have?
2011-09-20T19:12:00.000Z	sburwood1	usr13	in "System Profiler and Benchmark", it seems to say that I have PCIE, but is there a benefit between PCI and PCIE?
