2010-02-14T09:40:00.000Z	Sarah90		hey guys. im getting a blank screen after boot. i see the ubuntu logo but then screen just goes black. how do i fix this problem?
2010-02-14T09:41:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	Are you reaching till the login screen?
2010-02-14T09:42:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	no, i dont see it. the screen is blank. it was working perfectly this morning.
2010-02-14T09:43:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	why don't you try running a live cd and checking your grub file. Could be a problem there
2010-02-14T09:44:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	And did you reach the grub stage?
2010-02-14T09:44:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	yes, i did.
2010-02-14T09:45:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	Then choose a different kernel and try. Any upgrades you recently did?
2010-02-14T09:46:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	well i did an update this morning and i removed this program i forgot the name. after it went blank i tried a different kernel but no luck, its the same with all of them.
2010-02-14T09:46:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	so you suggest that i run the live cd and check the grub file?
2010-02-14T09:47:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	can't i boot the live and ask it to reinstall the drivers or wahtever is messing
2010-02-14T09:48:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	You need to install the whole distro.You wont lose your data if you have a seperate /home partition
2010-02-14T09:49:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	my /home folder is in the same partition as ubuntu partition, will i lose everything?
2010-02-14T09:50:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	i dont mind reinstalling ubuntu but i need to get my stuff out of the partition and i can't access to all folders when i boot from the live cd, why is that?
2010-02-14T09:51:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	You can access all the folders from  a live cd.
2010-02-14T09:51:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	oki doki, i will try them again.
2010-02-14T09:51:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	last Q. is there a chance that i can access them files in ubuntu from windows 7?
2010-02-14T09:52:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	Nope. Linux uses ext3/4 formats which are invisible to windows
2010-02-14T09:52:00.000Z	k4rt33k	Sarah90	There are some programs which do that but they are unreliable
2010-02-14T09:53:00.000Z	Sarah90	k4rt33k	ahh boohoo microsoft. well many thanks for helping me k4rt33k. really appreeshiyate it XOXOX
