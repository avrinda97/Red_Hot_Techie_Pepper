2011-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	sam_sam		can i set tty1 on my machine as another display for a machine connected through ssh ?
2011-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	yes
2011-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	sam_sam	rumpel__	can u tell me how ?
2011-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	search for "tty rungetty auto login bashrc"
2011-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	sam_sam	rumpel__	ty :)
2011-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	that's, if you want to start the ssh-terminal on startup
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	sam_sam		rumpel__:not on startup .. i just want to test when needed?
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	then it's far easier ^^
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	switch to tty1, log in, start ssh
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	sam_sam		rumpel__:rungetty ?
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	sam_sam		hmm i want GUI
2011-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	sam_sam		rumpel__:hehe i knew that
2011-01-07T15:09:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	hmm... you need gui? ... then start e.g. another x-server with "startx -- :1" ... hm..
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	sam_sam	rumpel__	i want to start X11 or whatever is needed to get a GUI for that machine
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	sam_sam		what does that argument ":1" means ?
2011-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	you can get GUIs with several methods... like Xforwarding for ssh
2011-01-07T15:11:00.000Z	sam_sam		rumpel__:let me try ...
2011-01-07T15:12:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	:1 is Xserver 1 ... when you have already running Xserver 0 (which is default)
2011-01-07T15:13:00.000Z	rumpel__	sam_sam	on the new xserver you probably need to start "gnome-panel & disown" for gnome-panels
