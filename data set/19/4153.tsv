2012-02-07T18:44:00.000Z	Lint		how make dpkg make colums wider?
2012-02-07T18:44:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	you resized your term and the output is still constrained horizontally?
2012-02-07T18:45:00.000Z	Lint	reisio	package name column is 14 symbols wide and useless
2012-02-07T18:46:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	good reason
2012-02-07T18:47:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	what's your preferred language?
2012-02-07T19:01:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	hrmm?
2012-02-07T19:01:00.000Z	Lint	reisio	need for root access to shutdown, mount disks and similar idiocy
2012-02-07T19:04:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	it won't of course, but with physical access there isn't much that can keep you secure
2012-02-20T09:59:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	become that package's author, then change the license and be a grump
2012-02-20T10:01:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	free software
2012-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	Lint	reisio	useless hardware
2012-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	yup, useless hardware that someone needed a driver to use
2012-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	Lint	reisio	why my 3 years old driver performs better than today's opensource? it's nonsence
2012-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	why do we have to compare it to the open source driver?
2012-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	if it's a nvidia or ati device, there are official drivers
2012-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	Lint	reisio	official drivers do not work on linux since 2009
2012-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	so you're happy to use 3-year-old drivers on Windows, but to do so on Linux... makes Linux lame?
2012-02-20T10:19:00.000Z	Lint	reisio	I CANNOT use 3 year old driver on Linux, it doesn't work
2012-02-20T10:19:00.000Z	reisio	Lint	of course it works
