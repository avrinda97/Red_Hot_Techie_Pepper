2007-01-30T14:41:00.000Z	rhainur		restart, and hope for the best?
2007-01-30T14:41:00.000Z	rhainur		well
2007-01-30T14:41:00.000Z	rhainur		the video card is an ATI Radeon x1400 Mobility Radeon
2007-01-30T14:41:00.000Z	rhainur		if I remember correctly
2007-01-30T14:42:00.000Z	rhainur		because it said so on the internet xD
2007-01-30T14:42:00.000Z	rhainur		which sounds like an incredibly naive reason
2007-01-30T14:42:00.000Z	rhainur		but seriously, all I did was google "resolution problem dell inspiron ubuntu" or something of the sort
2007-01-30T14:43:00.000Z	rhainur		and that's pretty much all I could guess from the results
2007-01-30T14:43:00.000Z	rhainur		so, someone care to tell me what I'm doing wrong?
2007-01-30T14:43:00.000Z	rhainur		apart from using the wrong driver
2007-01-30T14:43:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	could you do lspci
2007-01-30T14:43:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	that should tell you ur graphics chipset at least
2007-01-30T14:44:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	then thats definitely not a 915
2007-01-30T14:44:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	you need to install the ATI drivers
2007-01-30T14:46:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28ATI.29
2007-01-30T14:46:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	that has most of the stuff there that you'll need....just check out that page before you ask here again if you need something.
2007-01-30T14:48:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	you should see  How to install Graphics Driver (ATI): ->http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide <- the ATI / ubuntu wiki for how to install it.
2007-01-30T14:48:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	good.....or you could ditch that laptop and trade it for one with a nvidia chipset....much nicer.
2007-01-30T14:55:00.000Z	valehru	rhainur	it works?  whats the glxgears give you?
