2009-08-07T16:06:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	for a slightly toungue-in-cheek response, go check out the tips at: http://echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=43454
2009-08-07T16:07:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	another forum link :(
2009-08-07T16:07:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	I did prefix it with tongue-in-cheek, though :)
2009-08-07T16:09:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	Ok , I will once again go and check , do the steps and screw my system a bit more
2009-08-07T16:10:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	don't. *sigh* it wasn't an actual responed. I hoped to provide some comic relief, since flash support in linux in notoriously bad.
2009-08-07T16:11:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	do you have any flash support at all, or is it just slow and chunky?
2009-08-07T16:12:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	I dont know , how can I tell ?
2009-08-07T16:13:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	does anything show up when you open youtube? do you get the player with the play button, or is there just a notification that you need to "install a plugin" or somesuch?
2009-08-07T16:16:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	i do feel the pain too. in fact i switched to linux grinding my teeth and hoping nothing gets too broken. turned out better than I expected, but I sure do miss the suspend on my laptop, and indeed working plugin support in the browser.
2009-08-07T16:16:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	well , the youtube thumbnails of videos, when I click on the video to view, the new pages gets downloaded with all buttons, I can see that video is getting buffered as the GREYED red line moves forwared
2009-08-07T16:17:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	ok... but the video never starts then?
2009-08-07T16:17:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	but the video never gets displayed or any sound , all I see is black screen
2009-08-07T16:17:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	right
2009-08-07T16:19:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	right... I think I met the same problem once. if i remember correctly, i fixed it by chaning the flash plugin tha I used.
2009-08-07T16:20:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	i don't remember how i did it anymore, though (or in fact whether i actually did it)
2009-08-07T16:20:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	how ?
2009-08-07T16:22:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	It might have been trhough the packet manager, Synaptic. I probably searched for flash, and removed the one in use, replacing it with another.... but really, I don't know if you should do this, just providing some possibilities.
2009-08-07T16:23:00.000Z	Technocrat	Ileden	So even in linux we do things which we dont understand and sometimes they work
2009-08-07T16:24:00.000Z	Ileden	Technocrat	well... I do. :)
