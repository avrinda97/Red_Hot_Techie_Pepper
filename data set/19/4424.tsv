2009-01-31T10:04:00.000Z	bamhm182		what were you saying johnnyredl?
2009-01-31T10:05:00.000Z	bamhm182		alright, I'll give it a shot
2009-01-31T10:07:00.000Z	bamhm182		where's the repository? I used to know, but I forgot
2009-01-31T10:08:00.000Z	bamhm182		I downloaded the Ubuntu 8.10 iso, shouldn't it be on my desktop?
2009-01-31T10:08:00.000Z	bamhm182		or does Ubuntu move it somewhere when it's done downloading?
2009-01-31T10:10:00.000Z	bamhm182		where's the trash?
2009-01-31T10:10:00.000Z	bamhm182		nevermind, found it
2009-01-31T10:10:00.000Z	bamhm182		thanks
2009-01-31T10:11:00.000Z	bamhm182		ugh... This computer hates me
2009-01-31T10:11:00.000Z	bamhm182		now to go download Ubuntu 8.10 for the 3rd time :D
2009-01-31T10:11:00.000Z	phorensic	bamhm182	hmm maybe saving the iso or burning it to a disk is a good choice?
2009-01-31T10:13:00.000Z	bamhm182	phorensic	I downloaded it, forgot about it, than just went to go burn it and it was gone
2009-01-31T10:13:00.000Z	bamhm182		I downloaded it about 3 hours ago
2009-01-31T10:14:00.000Z	phorensic	bamhm182	thats not cool.. you did that twice?
2009-01-31T10:15:00.000Z	bamhm182		nah
2009-01-31T10:15:00.000Z	bamhm182		the first time I accidentally hit ctrl+alt+backspace when it was most the way through it
2009-01-31T10:17:00.000Z	bamhm182		I hate torrents, they're so insanely slow most the time
2009-01-31T10:17:00.000Z	bamhm182		you can find the occasional odd torrent that's quick, but overall they're slow
2009-01-31T10:17:00.000Z	phorensic	bamhm182	nah you gotta port forward properly and they are coo
