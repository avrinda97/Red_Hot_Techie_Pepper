2008-07-09T04:53:00.000Z	mynyml		i can't find a connection when i set a static lan ip in network admin. i can has halp plz?
2008-07-09T04:53:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	what ip address are you giving your self
2008-07-09T04:54:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	192.168.1.3 ... but tried 1.nn to, no luck
2008-07-09T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	is your router giving out dhcp addresses still ?
2008-07-09T04:55:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	yeah
2008-07-09T04:55:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	thats why then, that address conflicts with the dhcp range
2008-07-09T04:55:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	you need to shorten the dhcp range on your router, or reserve a set of addresses to that the router doesn't use them
2008-07-09T04:55:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	hmm. i remember i used to use 1.3 though .... weird
2008-07-09T04:56:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	i'll try that then, thanks
2008-07-09T04:56:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	1.3 ?
2008-07-09T04:56:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	192.168.1.3
2008-07-09T04:56:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	I see
2008-07-09T04:56:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	you can use them, if the router doesn't have a lease on that address,
2008-07-09T04:59:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	looks like dhcp is assigning addresses above 192.168.1.100 only
2008-07-09T05:00:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	so 192.168.1.3 should be available
2008-07-09T05:00:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	then the issue is either your subnet/gateway is wrong, or your router config is wrong
2008-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	the gateway address i know is right. guess it could be the router config. was hoping it was something tricky with the network-admin config - that's easier to get help for =#
2008-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	ikonia	mynyml	view it with ifconfig - check your factual config
2008-07-09T05:04:00.000Z	mynyml	ikonia	alright. i'll keep trying. thanks!
