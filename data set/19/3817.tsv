2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	crom09		Hello, recently installed ubuntu. Does the windows button in my keyboard do something?
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	Who	crom09	Yes,
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	crom09		who: what?
2009-05-22T21:08:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: you can also use it for other useful new shortcut keys. If you're running compiz and have the 'expo' plugin on then it will zoom out
2009-05-22T21:08:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: try holding the win key and scrolling
2009-05-22T21:09:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: also, if you install something like Gnome-do (which I strongly recommend!) then it uses <win>+<space> to start it
2009-05-22T21:09:00.000Z	crom09		who: I0m not running compiz (have some problems if I enable the propietary drivers of my card)
2009-05-22T21:09:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: It is often called 'Super' or 'Meta' on Linux, for obvious reasons ;)
2009-05-22T21:09:00.000Z	crom09		who: so right now, it isn't doing anything at all...
2009-05-22T21:09:00.000Z	crom09		oh
2009-05-22T21:10:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: I don't know, there are likely applications that _do_ use it. I don't think I use any except Compiz and Gnome-do
2009-05-22T21:10:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: I also use it for setting shortcut keys of my own, because it is not so often used
2009-05-22T21:10:00.000Z	crom09		who: so ther'es no harm in making it open the "start menu" like in windows
2009-05-22T21:11:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: well, I _think_ that if you do that you might loose the ability to make it a modifier key, but I am not sure about that, maybe have a little test
2009-05-22T21:11:00.000Z	crom09		ok
2009-05-22T21:12:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: good luck :)
2009-05-22T21:12:00.000Z	Who		chrom09: also, if you install gnome-do you'll never want to use the 'start menu' again ;)
2009-05-22T21:14:00.000Z	crom09	Who	ok, just configured to behave like windows. I'll watch out for any problems.
2009-05-22T21:14:00.000Z	crom09	Who	and I'll have a look at gnome-do (heard of it once, but not tried it yet).
