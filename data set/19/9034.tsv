2007-01-04T17:09:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		So does anyone here have a foolproof way of setting up a wireless network? ;)
2007-01-04T17:10:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		It's a Netgear WPN311, trying to connect to a Netgear WPN824 wireless router using 128bit WEP encryption
2007-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		wlan0
2007-01-04T17:13:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		Apparently i'm meant to have wlan0, but I don't. All I have is eth0, lo and ath0
2007-01-04T17:14:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		oh god.
2007-01-04T07:10:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		Hey o
2007-01-04T07:11:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		!wifi
2007-01-04T07:11:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		Hmm, thought there was more there last night.
2007-01-04T07:12:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		I've installed ndiswrapper, loaded my windows driver for my card, and I'd like to know how to stop my card using it's current driver and use the one NDIS loaded.
2007-01-04T07:13:00.000Z	pr0gress0r	NoEvidenZ	modprobe remove and blacklist the driver
2007-01-04T07:14:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	pr0gress0r	any chance you could give me more detail?
2007-01-04T07:14:00.000Z	pr0gress0r		also I did the whole ndiswrapper thing yesterday and im running edgy - I had to compile it from source - the one in the repos would not work
2007-01-04T07:14:00.000Z	pr0gress0r		what network card you have?
2007-01-04T07:14:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		wpn311
2007-01-04T07:15:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	pr0gress0r	I'm brand new to linux. How do I do the whole modprobe and blacklist thing?
2007-01-04T07:15:00.000Z	pr0gress0r		one sec
2007-01-04T07:15:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		ok, thanks.
