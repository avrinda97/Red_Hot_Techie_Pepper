2012-02-10T01:04:00.000Z	Companion		sweet! thats on a ubuntu dedi
2012-02-10T01:06:00.000Z	Companion		I have to find out with version it is so I can upgrade it :P
2012-02-10T01:07:00.000Z	holstein	Companion	i would backup and reinstall.. that could take a long time to get up to speed
2012-02-10T01:07:00.000Z	Companion	holstein	That server uptime is over 5 years :P
2012-02-10T01:08:00.000Z	holstein	Companion	at some point during this upgrade, you will want to restart that machine.. you can arguably waste a lot more time upgrading than just reinstalling
2012-02-10T01:08:00.000Z	Companion	holstein	ofc it gets rebooted at each upgrade :P
2012-02-10T01:09:00.000Z	holstein	Companion	and the last time was 5 years ago?.. the last upgrade?..
2012-02-10T01:10:00.000Z	Companion	holstein	its debian 0.8 Unstable
2012-02-10T01:12:00.000Z	holstein	Companion	everything meaning root kits?... kernel upgrades are something you might want to do more oftent than that for security reasons
2012-02-10T01:12:00.000Z	Companion	holstein	it wasnt my server
2012-02-10T01:12:00.000Z	Companion	holstein	its of an uni :')
