2010-04-01T19:33:00.000Z	acicula		upstart handles the starting of the scripts
2010-04-01T19:33:00.000Z	acicula		hmm thats still sysvinit i think?
2010-04-01T19:33:00.000Z	acicula		isnt it just init iterating through the runlevel dir?
2010-04-01T19:34:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	I think it's initrd he's talking about
2010-04-01T20:47:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	convert is cli - if the gimp is too advanced...
2010-04-01T20:47:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	gimp is an image manipulation program
2010-04-01T20:48:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	sorry - I use it to convert as well
2010-04-05T20:34:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	is g++ and such installed?
2010-04-05T20:34:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	yep - with build-essential
2010-04-05T20:35:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	probably need some more libs then just build-essential
2010-04-05T20:37:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	can't find which tho - it normally spits out which are missing - I get nothing like that - I'm guessing the compiler was built without something maybe
2010-04-05T20:38:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	well it says the linker does not support dynamic libs, which seems unlikely
2010-04-05T20:39:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	but it can't get past that - no mention of anything missing
2010-04-05T20:39:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	have a look in the readme for versions/required software, or check what the configure script is actually checkking?
2010-04-05T20:39:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	the next line is   checking dynamic linker characteristics... no
2010-04-05T20:41:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	what if you give it the exact path to ld?
2010-04-05T20:43:00.000Z	moetunes	acicula	how do I feed that to ./configure?
2010-04-05T20:43:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	./configure --help ;)
2010-04-05T20:43:00.000Z	acicula	moetunes	can you pastebin the configure script, also any reason for compiling from source as opposed to debs?
