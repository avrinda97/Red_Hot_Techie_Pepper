2011-05-02T21:23:00.000Z	roasted		Hey guys - has the Unity bug with dual screen monitors been fixed so I can have my right-side monitor as the main with Unity's bar on it?
2011-05-02T21:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	no don't think so
2011-05-02T21:24:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	bummer. :(
2011-05-02T21:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	altough to be honest  not that sure what bug your reffering to, but I guess since 11.04 is security updates only, no is the answer to your question
2011-05-02T21:24:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	when you are running 2 monitors, you can't move the unity bar anywhere else EXCEPT on the far far left.
2011-05-02T21:25:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	I want it on the left of my main screen (which is on the right)
2011-05-02T21:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	I think that's something that won't be fixed untill maybe the next release, for what your reffering to
2011-05-02T21:25:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	LOL. you gotta be kidding. Next release = fail if that's how long it will take.
2011-05-02T21:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	well 11.04 is security updates only as far as I know, so don't expect any Unity fixes in it
2011-05-02T21:26:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	I mean within a month or so would be nice to see the feature there... a feature that should have been there since day 1 if you ask me.
2011-05-02T21:26:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	I can understand being limited on feature set, but at least keeping the potion for dual screeners out there... that just *makes sense*
2011-05-02T21:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	well that's not how Ubuntu works, a release comes out, and useually only gets security updates after woulds
2011-05-02T21:27:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	that sounds so fail. hate to sound negative but, that's really bad.
2011-05-02T21:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	well Ubuntu isn't a rolling release like....  well there are people here who don't like other distro's being mentioned in here,  but one does come to mind, when it comes to getting security updates, but also proper later versions of programs when stable enough.
2011-05-02T21:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	of course as far as I  know Unity is pretty much Ubuntu only at the moment though, because of certain technical reasons
2011-05-02T21:30:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	well, I'm sure that has potential to change once ubuntu gets off of the guinea pig test-drive that they're currently doing with it.
2011-05-02T21:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	no it will probably remain a versions distro, that only tends to get security updates, for well many years to come yet
2011-05-02T21:31:00.000Z	roasted	sebsebseb	I have no idea what you just said. I'm referring to Unity on other distros.
2011-05-02T21:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roasted	well  a guy from Fedora tried to do just that and even get it into the main repo's, and another guy tried to provide it for OpenSuse, but yep some technical issues.  Anyway this is going off topic now.
