2007-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	Rex_		does anyone know what package contains glib-2.0? I have been looking for an hour and I need it for dependencies.
2007-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	what are you compiling?
2007-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	sorry... Awn
2007-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	you need the -dev package: libglib2.0-dev
2007-06-10T05:59:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	I installed that thinking that was it... still got a compile error. :( I will go read the PM now... thanks.
2007-06-10T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	feel free to pastebin the error and link to it
2007-06-10T06:03:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	and n2diy: it looks like it was build-essentials. Thanks for your help.
2007-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	apt-cache policy libglib2.0-dev
2007-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	run that in terminal and try again?
2007-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	show me the output
2007-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	http://www.pastebin.ca/554059
2007-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	sudo aptitude install libglib2.0-dev
2007-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	sweet... I looked high and low for that package... now there is another dep prob... http://www.pastebin.ca/554060
2007-06-10T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	now you do the same thing, run:  apt-cache search -n lib gtk dev   and you read the results and choose the appropriate one to install
2007-06-10T06:12:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	cool.. thanks. I learned something new. :)
2007-06-10T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	libgtk2.0-dev - Development files for the GTK+ library  would be the right one for that, the others should be straightforward
2007-06-10T06:14:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	sweet... looks like the install of libgtk2.0-dev will solve the other deps.
2007-06-10T06:19:00.000Z	Rex_	jrib	thanks for your help.. I gotta get to work... have a good one.
2007-06-10T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	Rex_	np, you too
