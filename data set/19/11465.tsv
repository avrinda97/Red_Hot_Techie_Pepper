2007-04-18T14:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	make a list with:   dpkg --get-selections > package.list
2007-04-18T14:21:00.000Z	sorcerer	thoreauputic	 once i gety the package list what happens next
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	that command will put it in a file called package.list
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	you can read that with a text editor
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	sorcerer	thoreauputic	umm it says permision denied
2007-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	you are in the wrong directory then - do the command in your $HOME dir
2007-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	 cd ~ ; dpkg --get-selections > package.list
2007-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	sorcerer	thoreauputic	 why does it always have to be in the home directory ?
2007-04-18T14:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	because in most directories outside $HOME you don't have write permissions without sudo :)
2007-04-18T14:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	/tmp is an exception
2007-04-18T14:25:00.000Z	sorcerer	thoreauputic	 ok mate well .. what happened the pakage liste .. what dfoes that contain and what can id o
2007-04-18T14:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	now that you have the list, have a look at it ( gedit packages.list )
2007-04-18T14:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	all the packages marked "install" are ones you have installed
2007-04-18T14:27:00.000Z	sorcerer	thoreauputic	ok mate .. it shows all the stuff i have installed how can i use it on my new system
2007-04-18T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	install all those packages :)
2007-04-18T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	you can feed it to  dpkg --set-selections
2007-04-18T14:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	this is all in the dpkg man page :)
2007-04-18T14:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sorcerer	as with most things in linux, there are several ways to achieve the same thing
