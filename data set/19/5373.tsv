2011-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	jordan_		lol, that seemed rather useless
2011-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	jordan_		i aske dmy question pretty clearly i thought
2011-02-24T07:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	the point is that you need to tell us what you're actually having troubles with when installing wine, not just asking for "anyone" who can setup wine
2011-02-24T07:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	what specific trouble are you having with the config page?
2011-02-24T07:08:00.000Z	jordan_	gaelfx	k, the first start up window when i click q4wine ask for 4 things, 3 of which are already filled in, the fourth is a wine libs : which i dont know what they want me to put there
2011-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	how did you install wine?
2011-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	jordan_	gaelfx	via the software center
2011-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	and what are you trying to do with it?
2011-02-24T07:14:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	you don't run wine, you install windows programs with it and then run them
2011-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	jordan_	gaelfx	it seems more a headache then a fix for now, and being i dont NEED it at the moment i will revoke my question about it
2011-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	in my experience, it's been pretty decent for running windows programs, have you tried installing any with it?
2011-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	jordan_	gaelfx	 no initially i was going to run the urbanterror game via wine but another person helped me get urbanterror running via the terminal
2011-02-24T21:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	 TightVNC is good for windows, if need be
2011-02-24T21:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	jordan_	if you want to swap files with windows, WinSCP is handy as well, works with ssh too
