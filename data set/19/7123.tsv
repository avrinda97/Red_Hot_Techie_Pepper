2009-04-02T19:38:00.000Z	ciphergoth		I'm sitting next to a laptop that I can't get to go online because I can't see the network icon in the notification area
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	is nm-applet running?
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ciphergoth		it's running Intrepid.  When me or Jess are logged in, we see the icon and we can get online, but Libby is logged in and she can't see it
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ciphergoth		zirroday: another user is running it
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	okay, is nm-applet running?
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	ah right, now I understand
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	what version of ubuntu?
2009-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	ciphergoth		Intrepid
2009-04-02T19:40:00.000Z	ciphergoth	ziroday	does the other user need to log out altogether, or can we run two instances of nm-applet?
2009-04-02T19:41:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	you should be able to use two together, but not sure
2009-04-02T19:41:00.000Z	ciphergoth	ziroday	it doesn't like it
2009-04-02T19:41:00.000Z	ciphergoth		it says it couldn't acquire the NetworkManagerUserSettings as it is already takne
2009-04-02T19:42:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/284596
2009-04-02T19:42:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	its a confirmed bug and is being worked on
2009-04-02T19:44:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	however I can understand its a pain, you might want to look at the other bugs (particularly the gnome one) for possible workarounds
2009-04-02T19:44:00.000Z	ciphergoth	ziroday	it worked - thanks!
2009-04-02T19:44:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	what worked?
2009-04-02T19:44:00.000Z	ciphergoth	ziroday	logging out both users then logging back in agian
2009-04-02T19:44:00.000Z	ziroday	ciphergoth	right
