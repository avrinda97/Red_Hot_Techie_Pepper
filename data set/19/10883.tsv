2006-04-27T16:17:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	install the gstreamer-plugins
2006-04-27T16:17:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	or install w32codecs
2006-04-27T16:18:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	you must enable the universe and multiverse repositories, try to do it in the synaptic installer
2006-04-27T16:19:00.000Z	jivah	eneried	where is system
2006-04-27T16:19:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	look at the top
2006-04-27T16:20:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	there are thre menus the third
2006-04-27T16:34:00.000Z	jivah	eneried	Warbo i installed "gstreamer" but i did not get the expected fun ... my xvid file don't work
2006-04-27T16:35:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	then install the gstreamer plugins
2006-04-27T16:35:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	and the multiverse plugins
2006-04-27T16:36:00.000Z	jivah	eneried	yes i selected all plugings and installed them
2006-04-27T16:37:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	wich totem do you have? there're two tomes totem-gstremaer, based on gstreamer and totem-xine, based on xine
2006-04-27T16:37:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	then shut down totem and open it again letim it to load again the codec list
2006-04-27T16:38:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	if you use totem-gstreamer, xvid codec is in gstreamer-plugins or gstreamer-plugins-multiverse
2006-04-27T16:39:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	if you installed totem-xine, you must install w32codecs instead of gstreamer-plugins, but a best solution is to install gxine for w32codecs, and totem-gstreamer for the other plugins we said
2006-04-27T16:40:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	so if tottem-gstreamer didint work you use gxine to view videos
2006-04-27T16:44:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	did you see it after with a different player?
2006-04-27T16:46:00.000Z	eneried	jivah	;) enjoy linux ;)
