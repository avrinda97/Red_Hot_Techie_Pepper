2006-12-07T11:09:00.000Z	jamesbrose		Hey, vmware or vmware-player wont install properly on edgy

2006-12-07T11:11:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	are you using the vmware player from the repos?
2006-12-07T11:11:00.000Z	jamesbrose	LjL	yes

2006-12-07T11:14:00.000Z	jamesbrose	LjL	and the error that keeps loopin' : http://rafb.net/paste/results/jRyLJ352.html
2006-12-07T11:14:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	did you try installing some other vmware flavor from a tar file, before trying the one from the repos?
2006-12-07T11:15:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	which did you try *first*?
2006-12-07T11:17:00.000Z	jamesbrose	LjL	repos
2006-12-07T11:17:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	type "dpkg -S etc/init.d/functions", outputs anything?
2006-12-07T11:17:00.000Z	jamesbrose	LjL	dpkg: *etc/init.d/functions* not found.
2006-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	as i thought. that file was installed by something external (likely a separate vmware installation); i don't have it on my machine, and it's what causing the trouble with your installation, at least the trouble that can be seen from your paste.
2006-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	jamesbrose	LjL	what do you think I should do then?
2006-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	try "sudo apt-get --purge remove vmware-player", then remove anything related to vmware that you can find, then try again installing
2006-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	i don't know... unless they come with an uninstall script, it will be guesswork mostly
2006-12-07T11:21:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	"find /etc | grep -i vmware" and "find /usr | grep -i vmware" will probably help
2006-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	LjL	jamesbrose	also are you sure your edgy is up to date? i.e. you have edgy, edgy-updates and edgy-security enabled for restricted, main, universe and multiverse, and you ran an upgrade recently?
