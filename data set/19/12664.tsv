2006-03-30T09:48:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	what did you try for the ati and fglrx drivers?
2006-03-30T09:49:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	I followed the ubuntu wiki for BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2006-03-30T09:49:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	ok 1st of all.  i don't know if it being a 64bit system matters.  have you check that?
2006-03-30T09:50:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	nope.  only reset to vesa and got it running that way so I could get online and try to figure it out.
2006-03-30T09:52:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	ok, let's assume it doesn't matter.  which one did you try?  the repos driver?  the ati.com driver? both?
2006-03-30T09:52:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	so far, just the repos driver.
2006-03-30T09:53:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	the repos driver didn't work for me.  the ati.com one did
2006-03-30T09:54:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	k. will try that next. thx.
2006-03-30T10:04:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	I am trying to follow the ati driver install instructions.  Small problem.  My resolution is currently set to 1024x768 which is as large as it will go.  The tool for the ati installer wont give me access to the buttons.
2006-03-30T10:05:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	hold alt, and click anywhere on the window to move it
2006-03-30T10:05:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	the buttons are off the bottom of the screen, I cant resize the window and the window is too big to see the bottom.
2006-03-30T10:06:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	yep that worked.
2006-03-30T10:11:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	brenner	sorry for all the questions.  Next issue is that the install wants the local kernel headers.  kernel running is the 2.6.12-10-amd64-generic.  ubuntu package list does not include headers for this kernel yet it appears.
2006-03-30T10:12:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	*nod* which was what i sort of feared at the start....maybe 64bit isn't supported?

2006-03-30T10:15:00.000Z	brenner	sbartleylinux	there's something about 64bit there
