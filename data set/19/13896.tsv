2009-05-15T19:43:00.000Z	kdoafk		I am trying unsuccessfully to install the mesa drivers for my computer
2009-05-15T19:44:00.000Z	kdoafk		yes
2009-05-15T19:45:00.000Z	kdoafk		I have ./compiled the files from the tar.gz 's
2009-05-15T19:45:00.000Z	kdoafk		intel
2009-05-15T19:45:00.000Z	kdoafk		the directions say to use make install but I keep getting errors
2009-05-15T19:46:00.000Z	kdoafk		there is no install file
2009-05-15T19:46:00.000Z	kdoafk		i am new to linux and command line
2009-05-15T19:47:00.000Z	kdoafk		I am trying to run graphics programs that ran on this machine when it was a windows machine but the graphics are all wonky now
2009-05-15T19:48:00.000Z	kdoafk		One of them is Blender and the other is Houdini for linux
2009-05-15T19:48:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	Depending on the program, you might have to sudo make install if you havent already
2009-05-15T19:49:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	And make sure you have build-essential installed :)
2009-05-15T19:49:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	Try sudo apt-get install build-essential if you haven't already.
2009-05-15T19:56:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	Er, build-essential I referred to to help you with your problem running make/make install etc
2009-05-15T19:56:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	I'd recommend running ./configure again from scratch
2009-05-15T19:56:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	And make sure it doesn't spew any errors at you
2009-05-15T19:57:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	Er, by looking :) It will say if there are libraries missing that it needs/etc
2009-05-15T19:59:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	No, you do ./configure .. then make.. then make install
2009-05-15T19:59:00.000Z	mattgirv	kdoafk	But you may have to do sudo make install if you have permission errors (with copying the files)
