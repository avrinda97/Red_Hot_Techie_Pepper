2008-01-21T12:00:00.000Z	gobbles414		Hi all: I am trying to solve how to make system-wide keyboard shortcuts to control VLC in Ubuntu. I need to know what to put in gconf-editor => metacity => keybinding_commands. For example, vlc --extrashort-jump-size -5 is for a five second rewind. It opens a new VLC window, but I want the command to execute on a currently playing file. Can anyone help?

2008-01-21T12:04:00.000Z	gobbles414		:P I am trying to solve how to make system-wide keyboard shortcuts to control VLC in Ubuntu. I almost have this problem solved. I just need help from someone who knows the command line a little better than I do! :'(
2008-01-21T12:05:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	have you looked at man loadkeys?
2008-01-21T12:06:00.000Z	gobbles414	n2diy	Didn't know about that. I will look and be right back. Thank you...
2008-01-21T12:09:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	sorry, what is an VLC?
2008-01-21T12:10:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	ah, sorry, I don't play with  VLC?
2008-01-21T12:12:00.000Z	gobbles414	n2diy	I think that I need to add a GENERIC modified to the command. Is there a modifier for the command line the tells programs to execute a command without opening a new window
2008-01-21T12:13:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	could be, I don't know?
2008-01-21T12:13:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	GL
2008-01-21T12:16:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	is there a vlcrc file in your home directorey?
2008-01-21T12:17:00.000Z	gobbles414	n2diy	Yes, in a folder called .vlc. And yes, I have already consulted vlc --help
2008-01-21T12:18:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	I would guess .vlc is the place to play?
2008-01-21T12:19:00.000Z	gobbles414	n2diy	I am actually trying to add the command using gconf-editor. None of the VLC files themselves need to be changed. I just need the correct syntax
2008-01-21T12:20:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	ok, roger that The syntax in the VLC files may give you a clue how to do that?
2008-01-21T12:26:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	start the program in backround mode, and then you can return to the command line and play.
2008-01-21T12:26:00.000Z	gobbles414	n2diy	background mode, what is that?
2008-01-21T12:29:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	wait, I'm having a brain cramp, and can't remember, let go ask in #bash.
2008-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	n2diy	gobbles414	run (command) &, and then you can play at the CLI will the program runs.
