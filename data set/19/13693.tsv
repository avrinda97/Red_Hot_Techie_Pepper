2005-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	christopher_		hey my network tools in applications/system has a problem
2005-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	christopher_		it askes me for my password and then i type my password it says wrong password
2005-03-05T17:37:00.000Z	christopher_		when i try to configure a network device like the one im using, it tells me the correct password is invalid
2005-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	christopher_		how do you share an internet connection
2005-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	christopher_		do you need a router?
2005-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	christopher_		i have 2 network cards
2005-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	christopher_		ethernet
2005-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	You don't need one, but it is far more convenient with one.
2005-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	christopher_	apokryphos	ok but it is possible with 2 ethernet cards?
2005-03-05T17:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	You just need to make a network, have one computer connecting to the Internet. The other will get the connection from the former.
2005-03-05T17:41:00.000Z	christopher_	apokryphos	ok you see its strange cuz when i try to configure network device in applications/system tools when it asks me for my password, itll tell me invalid pass, when its the right password
2005-03-05T17:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	What is this the password for? Accessing the network?
2005-03-05T17:42:00.000Z	christopher_	apokryphos	no its the sudo password its asking me for
2005-03-05T17:43:00.000Z	christopher_	apokryphos	when you run the applications/system/network tools then configure a network device what happens?
2005-03-05T17:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	Can't try, since I don't use Gnome.
2005-03-05T17:44:00.000Z	christopher_	apokryphos	gotcha damn... well it is telling me the right password is wrong... a little fustrating
2005-03-05T17:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	Right, I got the program. Doesn't request a password, but I can't configure anything neither.
2005-03-05T17:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	Any idea what the command is to run it?
2005-03-05T17:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	christopher_	I found another, probably related program. You might wanna try it... sudo network-admin
