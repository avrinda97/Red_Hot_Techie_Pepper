2011-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 whats the issue exactly? i missed it.
2011-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	xenland	dr_willis	its just a minor issue. The problem is when I go to program and open up a file it will show the most "recent files" that i worked with. this is very annoying as my folders go deep and this will cause me and extra 2 minutes per file open. the way it use to be is when press File -> open it would show the last directory i opened up a file. it doesn't do this any more it instead after the ubuntu updates shows the most rece
2011-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	xenland		ntly worked with files.

2011-10-15T13:14:00.000Z	xenland	dr_willis	now just to find the perfences for gnome to change this setting....
2011-10-15T13:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 actually just now in arista. it did just default back to the last directory i accessed...
2011-10-15T13:16:00.000Z	xenland	dr_willis	interesting... any thoughts what made the diff?
2011-10-15T13:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 seems like its some how defaulting to selecting 'recently used'   when i first opened it and there was no selection to make.
2011-10-15T13:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 this is in arista
2011-10-15T13:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 thats how it worked for me in gedit.. first time i open file.. went to recently used.. selected a file. hit open again. it defaulted back to where  that file was at
2011-10-15T13:18:00.000Z	xenland		dr_willis:thanks I'll try it out
2011-10-15T13:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 let me try selecting a file FROM the recently used list
2011-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 it defaulted to where the file was actually at.. not recently used that time also.
2011-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	xenland	 so it 'seems' to be working properly.
2011-10-15T13:20:00.000Z	xenland	dr_willis	that doesn't quite work but I think I will drag my working folders into the favs area for opening files that just work almost if not just as good as what i was doing before
