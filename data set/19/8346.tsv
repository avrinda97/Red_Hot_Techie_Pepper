2007-04-08T13:20:00.000Z	ignite|cotter		there is a way to run Ubuntu from CD correct?
2007-04-08T13:21:00.000Z	klock	ignite|cotter	there is a live cd for ubuntu
2007-04-08T13:21:00.000Z	ignite|cotter	klock	i tried that a few weeks ago, but was having trouble with it starting up, it would boot but wouldnt get to the 'desktop' the box in the middle was just a ll fuzzy and it just froze
2007-04-08T13:22:00.000Z	klock	ignite|cotter	sounds like if you made it that far it was having trouble with your video driver
2007-04-08T13:22:00.000Z	klock		x was having a heart attack
2007-04-08T13:22:00.000Z	ignite|cotter		ahhhh
2007-04-08T13:23:00.000Z	klock		inginte|cotter, what kind of video card do you have?
2007-04-08T13:23:00.000Z	ignite|cotter		nvidia 7800gt
2007-04-08T13:23:00.000Z	klock		heh
2007-04-08T13:23:00.000Z	klock		wootishi
2007-04-08T13:24:00.000Z	ignite|cotter	klock	,  wootish?
2007-04-08T13:24:00.000Z	klock	ignite|cotter	my best bet for you is to google "nvidia 7800 and ubuntu live cd" and add whatever version of live cd you have
2007-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	klock	ignite|cotter	shit gets nutty with the new cards
2007-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	ignite|cotter	klock	, ahhh okay, TY
2007-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	klock		ompall :0 didnt know this was a G-rated channel
2007-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	klock		my bad
2007-04-08T13:25:00.000Z	ignite|cotter	klock	, does the same problem exist if not using live cd?
2007-04-08T13:26:00.000Z	klock	ignite|cotter	quite possibly. I havent had much expierience with the new nvida cards, but the way they act with their drivers and their inclusion into ubuntu and kernel, I wouldnt be suprised if they are in a regular install also
2007-04-08T13:27:00.000Z	klock	ignite|cotter	google for sure will be a better buddy for this problem
