2009-03-26T21:03:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	are you sure that your wireless card is running, most laptops require wifi card to be enabled by a separate button if you get what I mean
2009-03-26T21:03:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	we all get in mess every now and then, that's how you learn :)

2009-03-26T21:04:00.000Z	gooy	dhruvasagar	i dont know
2009-03-26T21:04:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	as I said the laptops usually have a button to enable / disable the wireless adapter on the laptop
2009-03-26T21:06:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	hmmm yes I am here
2009-03-26T21:06:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	so did you find the network manager icon in the upper right corner of the screen? It is shaped as a computer
2009-03-26T21:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	alright
2009-03-26T21:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	gooy	it is there in the notification box which is usually in the upper panel in ubuntu on the right side
