2007-10-31T06:15:00.000Z	leladia		pls can someone tell me why http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/42768/ this program isn't working?
2007-10-31T06:15:00.000Z	ztomic	leladia	did you make it executable?

2007-10-31T06:17:00.000Z	leladia	ztomic	the program is suppose to take the first parameter after the progam name, assign it to the variable x and display the result
2007-10-31T06:18:00.000Z	ztomic	leladia	check that the first line is correct. it should be #!/bin/bash
