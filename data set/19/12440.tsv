2005-09-10T12:33:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		grip says it can't initialize /dev/scd0..anyone know what the problem could be?
2005-09-10T12:35:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		if beos had more apps, or if mac osx would be released on x86, i'd switch from linux.
2005-09-10T12:35:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		it's absurd that in an era like this, os choices are limited to such crap.
2005-09-10T12:36:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 frustration leads to disillusionment... why is linux so cr*p?
2005-09-10T12:38:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	the entire structure of any *nix is steeped in decades of legacy.
2005-09-10T12:38:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 DNS root hierarchy structure... seems to work fine imho.
2005-09-10T12:39:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	in beos, for instance, i had an dynamic-attribute-based 64-bit journalled file architecture.  never had to run any ckfs.  never had a search take longer than 1 second.
2005-09-10T12:40:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 i don't know anything about beos.
2005-09-10T12:40:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	it's amazing.
2005-09-10T16:35:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 what kernel are you rebooting on?
2005-10-29T13:33:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 install e:)
2005-10-29T13:33:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	it sucks.  i only like gnome, kde, and flux.
2005-11-01T14:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 normally the ugrade des that for you, no?
2005-11-15T15:22:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	depends if that is heavy or not ;)
2005-11-22T13:26:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 i.e; in a virtual desktop? no idea
2005-11-22T13:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	BROKEN_LADDER	 i can. i prefer kde to gnome....
2005-11-22T13:30:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	okay, but it's still ugly.
2005-11-22T13:30:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	i know kde has some features gnome doesn't.
2005-11-22T13:31:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	aftertaf	lol
