2007-12-04T02:16:00.000Z	javaJake	ragnar	what client are you using?
2007-12-04T02:17:00.000Z	javaJake	ragnar	ok, wherever you setup your NAT port, you should be able to test it
2007-12-04T02:17:00.000Z	javaJake	ragnar	if the test fails, your router is NOT properly configured
2007-12-04T02:19:00.000Z	javaJake	ragnar	mm, ktorrent can't, nvm
