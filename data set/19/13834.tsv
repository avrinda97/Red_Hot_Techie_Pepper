2005-01-08T14:37:00.000Z	whaaaaa		I have installed the drivers with ndiswrapper
2005-01-08T14:37:00.000Z	whaaaaa		so I can use "iwlist wlan0 scan" to scan the networks, and it sees them fine
2005-01-08T14:37:00.000Z	whaaaaa		I'm just wondering where to go from there
2005-01-08T14:38:00.000Z	whaaaaa		should I use sudo ifup wlan0?
2005-01-08T14:39:00.000Z	ogra	whaaaaa	use the network amanger app in the Computer menu
2005-01-08T14:40:00.000Z	ogra	whaaaaa	then set it up manually
2005-01-08T14:40:00.000Z	whaaaaa	ogra	actually it just showerd up
2005-01-08T14:41:00.000Z	ogra	whaaaaa	this app is a bit flaky, it will be replaced in hoary....
2005-01-08T14:41:00.000Z	whaaaaa	ogra	although last time that happened, my system froze.  should i be wary?
2005-01-08T14:43:00.000Z	ogra	whaaaaa	if it sees your device it should work.... else, in the wiki in the ndiswrapper howto is a good example for a /etc/network/interfaces file
