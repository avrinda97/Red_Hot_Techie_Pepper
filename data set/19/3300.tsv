2011-05-01T03:45:00.000Z	TrentonAdams		hey guys, I'm using ubuntu 11.04 my whole system is using the standard theme (dark title bars with orange X, etc.  But, my menu system uses it for just a little while, while logging in, then it switches back to an old windows 3.1 style super 3d buttons look.  Any ideas?

2011-05-01T03:48:00.000Z	coz_	TrentonAdams	 mm  ok I know nothing about ati,, I was hoping it was nvidia because then I would suggest uninstalling that driver then reinstalling since it most likely a different driver version..hoewver for ati I  have no idea
2011-05-01T03:48:00.000Z	coz_	TrentonAdams	 the problems with upgrades is many times old config files are left behind
2011-05-01T03:49:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	coz_	I deleted .gnome* and that did nothing.
2011-05-01T03:50:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	coz_	but if it was a "driver issue" then why the windows look fine, but the menu/task bar system don't?
2011-05-01T03:50:00.000Z	coz_	TrentonAdams	 good question ,,but I dont have a good answer for you ,, sorry
