2006-11-30T06:21:00.000Z	mcphail	poplars	have you tried wget -c to download the remainder of the file?
2006-11-30T06:21:00.000Z	poplars	mcphail	rapidshare doesn't allow it
2006-11-30T06:22:00.000Z	poplars	mcphail	I can't do a direct link, thye have some sort of protection against that
2006-11-30T06:22:00.000Z	mcphail	poplars	sorry - i type slower than i read :)
2006-11-30T06:22:00.000Z	poplars	mcphail	a nd I said I'm on dialup, I can't redownload it without waiting 8 hours :P
2006-11-30T06:22:00.000Z	poplars		so, does anyone know of a program that will attempt to extract corrupted zip files?
2006-11-30T06:23:00.000Z	poplars		erm
2006-11-30T06:23:00.000Z	poplars		winrar is far from the best.
2006-11-30T06:23:00.000Z	mcphail	poplars	some hosts just check the "referrer" header to limit direct downloads. This can be forged by wget.
