2011-10-15T18:23:00.000Z	iceroot		is there a reason why not all packages (e.g. terminator) have the "Supported: " entry? normally there is an info about the length of security-support
2011-10-15T18:25:00.000Z	arghx	iceroot	cause "terminator" is part of universe and universe has no security guarantee whatsoever
2011-10-15T18:26:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	so the community is managing universe instead of canocial?
2011-10-15T18:28:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	ok, short story is canocial is building the packages with security-updates when the community is providing the security-patches
2011-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	of course oracle is releasing java for linux
2011-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	its just not allowed to distribut it in an own package
2011-10-18T12:31:00.000Z	arghx	iceroot	which means it will be dead for all distros
2011-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	who cares
2011-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	most of the software is working with openjdk
2011-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	for the rest, download java from oracle
2011-10-18T12:33:00.000Z	arghx	iceroot	fsvo "most"
2011-10-18T12:33:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	dont blame me, blame oracle
2011-10-18T12:33:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	i dont care about oracle
2011-10-20T13:02:00.000Z	arghx	iceroot	not really :)
2011-10-20T13:02:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	dont come with pae
2011-10-20T13:03:00.000Z	arghx	iceroot	not even pae is necessary (not exactly a good solution either, but still doable)
2011-10-20T13:03:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	what is the other way without pae and without amd64?
2011-10-20T13:04:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	without amd64
2011-10-20T13:04:00.000Z	iceroot	arghx	using an amd64 kernel with 32bit userland is much more useless then pae...
