2009-12-14T03:00:00.000Z	Times_Witness		i don't know.  9.10. something broke and i have no idea how to fix :X im new to linux
2009-12-14T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	karmic isnt overly new
2009-12-14T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	tell us what happens after logon all on one line
2009-12-14T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	sounds like your video drivers are faulty
2009-12-14T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	boot to recovery root colnsole and run: lspci | grep -i vga
2009-12-14T03:09:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	the following line is printed, on lcpci:  01:00. VGA compatilble controller: ATI technologies Inc RV670PRO (Radeon HD 3850)
2009-12-14T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	ok then uninstall the proprietary driver and reboot, your system wil use the open driver and should be ok
2009-12-14T03:14:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	how can i do that ? :x Also, i did this to try to fix that issue, thinking it was X it was broken: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1324493, should i revert the original file back to there or leave that default one suggested in that thread?
2009-12-14T03:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	if you have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file it will be used, you should specify the driver as vesa so that you will get an x server
2009-12-14T03:17:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	i had a  /etc/X11/xorg.conf first time i looked, i didn't create one from scratch. i had to delete some lines to get it just like that one though. My question is if i just keep it like that one in the thread, or if i should restore the backup
2009-12-14T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	try both, its free to try
2009-12-14T03:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	_make sure you specify the vesa driver so it doesnt try to load any wierd ati drivers
2009-12-14T03:19:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	how do i do both: uninstal proprietary driver, and specify the vesa driver? I'm sorry i'm.. using linux for about a week now :p
2009-12-14T03:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	you will add a line in xorg.conf under the device section -0 Configured video device stating: Driver "vesa"    this will make it use that driver
2009-12-14T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	you can use jockey-gtk or synaptic to remove the driver
2009-12-14T03:25:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	i dont know what is jockey, but about synaptic i dont think i can access it from console. supposing you dont know the name of the package/s of those drivers, do you know how can i get those so i can 'apt-get remove <driver>' ?
2009-12-14T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Times_Witness	yes thats why you need to edit xorg.conf FIRST so you get a desktop
2009-12-14T03:28:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	ah. ok xD Thanks! on my way...
2009-12-14T04:10:00.000Z	Times_Witness	ActionParsnip	didn't work.. adding 'Driver "vesa"' under at device section ;S
