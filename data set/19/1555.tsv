2011-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	compdoc	[THC]AcidRain	Ive never used filezilla. Possible its some configuration problem
2011-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	compdoc	ive tried with firefox also. same issue
2011-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	compdoc	the thing is... i get this with every ftp server i use
2011-08-15T18:04:00.000Z	compdoc	[THC]AcidRain	running a firewall or iptables?
2011-08-15T18:04:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	compdoc	actually im pretty sure its because the user ftpuser doesnt have priviledges to view its home directory i have set
2011-08-15T18:04:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	compdoc	neither
2011-08-15T18:05:00.000Z	compdoc	[THC]AcidRain	what are the folder and file permissions? I use rsync, and if the permissions arent right, it doesnt work well
2011-08-15T18:08:00.000Z	compdoc	[THC]AcidRain	drwx------ limits it to one particular user, and nothing else
2011-08-15T18:09:00.000Z	compdoc	[THC]AcidRain	you prolly need to stop the ftp service before making changes
2011-08-15T18:09:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	compdoc	i tried that
2011-08-15T18:09:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	compdoc	i thought so

2011-08-20T18:47:00.000Z	compdoc	[THC]AcidRain	what network card you use? some can overheat
