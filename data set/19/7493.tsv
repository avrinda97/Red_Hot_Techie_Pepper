2008-03-24T09:12:00.000Z	RioMerc		Question: I have two monitors, a dual-head ATI card and fglrx. How do I go about setting up an extended desktop setup
2008-03-24T09:13:00.000Z	RioMerc		I've already tried BigDesktop, but phailure is the only thing that meets me. Every time.
2008-03-24T09:13:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	:  lol,,  i have a similar trouble
2008-03-24T09:13:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 what res are you running

2008-03-24T09:17:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 did you use the aticonfig tool???

2008-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 this program is ghey.  i can see the transfer but it sits at 0% with nothing to accept
2008-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 nice,   i'll have to use that site.   no worrys.  I have like 25 backups there now  lol.   I could just dpkg-reconfig too   ;)
2008-03-24T09:52:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	  do you know what the modeline section in doing???
2008-03-24T09:53:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 yeah,  im running the driver but i can get any res out of it.
2008-03-24T09:54:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	yeah  only has 2 options.  but when i use the xorg driver's or basic drivers I get 1024x768
2008-03-24T09:55:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	really odd
2008-03-24T09:56:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 Done that too.   There is a know issue with trying to run 1680X1050 but I should still get 280X1024
2008-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 I think I need to add some of those modeline entry's.  Do you know what the numbers represent after the resolutons and hz,  before the -rsync etc..
2008-03-24T10:00:00.000Z	TheViLliN	RioMerc	 yeah,  will try
