2011-04-13T06:47:00.000Z	WeThePeople		my right clicker is not working on my mouse, how would i access the panel to remove a icon
2011-04-13T06:49:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	are you trying to remove a file or folder from your desktop, or something from your menus?
2011-04-13T06:50:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	sorry, I got it now. the panel...
2011-04-13T06:56:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	I know how to remove something from the panel without right click. I wouldn't say it's the right way, and might leave some mess
2011-04-13T06:59:00.000Z	WeThePeople	Seven_Six_Two	what is it
2011-04-13T07:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	run gconf-editor in a terminal. go to apps >> panle
2011-04-13T07:01:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	Some things on the panel are applets and some are objects. Use this with caution, because it won't warn you if you do something dumb.
2011-04-13T07:07:00.000Z	WeThePeople	Seven_Six_Two	i dont think i can remove a specific icon from the editor
2011-04-13T07:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	you can, but it's not always obvious how. A safer option might be to try to use accessibility modes to fake a right click.
2011-04-13T07:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	or go and get a mouse with more than one button   ;)
2012-11-20T10:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	what "software"?
2012-11-20T10:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	you need to update and upgrade
2012-11-20T10:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	where did the kernel come from?
2012-11-20T10:12:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	reboot too.
2012-11-20T10:15:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-11-20T10:16:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2012-11-20T10:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	why would you be on lucid?
2012-11-20T10:19:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	are you trying to install from the old-releases.ubuntu.com server?
2012-11-20T10:20:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	WeThePeople	but that is an EOL distro, so the update servers have changed.
