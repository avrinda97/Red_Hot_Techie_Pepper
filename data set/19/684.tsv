2011-10-16T21:22:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	click the round icon next to your name ( settings )
2011-10-16T21:24:00.000Z	mamece2	Satanaa	whatever i click is useless, i just get the starting screen, the wallpaper in the background and that all
2011-10-16T21:24:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	oh you dont even see the login site?
2011-10-16T21:25:00.000Z	mamece2	Satanaa	i get to the login screen, i log in and then i can just see the wallpaper and the left bar, if i click them ican see the mouse cursor change but nothing happens
2011-10-16T21:27:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	that login window you do get to, right next to your username and password is a cog icon

2011-10-16T21:27:00.000Z	Satanaa		click on it
2011-10-16T21:30:00.000Z	mamece2	Satanaa	ok, what can i do there?
2011-10-16T21:32:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	isent there something called "ubuntu 2D" or classic etc?
2011-10-16T21:35:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	found it?
2011-10-16T21:35:00.000Z	mamece2	Satanaa	there " i fix it" but id really like to use ubuntu at it best
2011-10-16T21:36:00.000Z	mamece2	Satanaa	now its working, how can i use the other ubuntu? what does it has?
2011-10-16T21:36:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	then you have to fix compiz
2011-10-16T21:36:00.000Z	Satanaa		i cant help you there, i have never used compiz myself
2011-10-16T21:38:00.000Z	Satanaa	mamece2	but i have tested if compiz can run on my machine.. passes all tests... but if i try to login to ubuntu with it enabled i wount be able to login either.. i guess the ubuntu devs failed that one
