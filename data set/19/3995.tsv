2009-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	cdubya	JackWat	when I try to watch it with VLC, it crashes. As does totem, etc.
2009-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	cdubya	JackWat	how do I check that?
2009-04-21T08:04:00.000Z	JackWat	cdubya	compiz is what runs your desktop effects
2009-04-21T08:10:00.000Z	JackWat	cdubya	hi
2009-04-21T08:11:00.000Z	cdubya	JackWat	checked Hardware Drivers and noticed the fglrx driver hadn't been activated.....activated and restarted, and have video....
2009-04-21T08:11:00.000Z	cdubya	JackWat	but it's choppy like you asked.
2009-04-21T08:11:00.000Z	cdubya	JackWat	how do I disable compiz if that's causing the issue?
2009-04-21T08:11:00.000Z	JackWat	cdubya	are you using 8.10?
2009-04-21T08:12:00.000Z	JackWat	cdubya	:its fixed in 9.04 from what i understand
2009-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	JackWat	cdubya	i use compiz-fusion-icon to enable/disable compiz
2009-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	cdubya	JackWat	not quite ready to get to 9 yet.....last time I upgraded using the update manager I left Ubuntu for some time. Broke a bunch of stuff and I'm not willing to do that right now. Is there not an easy way to disable compiz?
