2005-05-13T13:18:00.000Z	efbie		but not for blender renders.

2005-05-13T13:21:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	apt-get install laptop-mode-tools
2005-05-13T13:21:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	apt-get install laptop-mode !! sorry :)
2005-05-13T13:22:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	-tools
2005-05-13T13:22:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	and then look at /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf
2005-05-13T13:23:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	CPU_MAXFREQ is think u need
2005-05-13T13:24:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	thing... sorry... i'm tierd... doing lot of mistakes :(
2005-05-13T13:25:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	play with config file :)
2005-05-13T13:25:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	CPU_MAXFREQ is by default "slowest"
2005-05-13T13:26:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	change it to max speed you would like it to bee when on battery
2005-05-13T13:27:00.000Z	ivoks	efbie	and then sudo /etc/init.d/laptop-mode restart
2005-05-13T13:29:00.000Z	efbie	ivoks	It doesn't work. In fact when i start rendering, it goes to 1.8Ghz, and then after a while it slows down to 800Mhz
