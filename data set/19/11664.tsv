2005-12-11T16:57:00.000Z	kbrooks		i wrote  a document in word with a table
2005-12-11T16:57:00.000Z	kbrooks		and when i open it in abiword
2005-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks		the table is enlongated
2005-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks		to a 2nd page
2005-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks		and i have 3 columns in this table
2005-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks		AND
2005-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	reupbert	kbrooks	abiword probably doesn't have full Microsoft Office .doc support
2005-12-11T16:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	reupbert	.. but abiword is open source!
2005-12-12T17:00:00.000Z	reupbert	kbrooks	you created the document it word, and opened it in abiword. abiword has to decode the closed-source .doc code
2005-12-12T17:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	reupbert	uh
2005-12-12T17:01:00.000Z	reupbert	kbrooks	.doc is a proprietary format made by Microsoft.
2005-12-12T17:01:00.000Z	reupbert	kbrooks	if you want to fix it, change the table in abiword.
2005-12-12T17:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	reupbert	no, i dont know how to without ruining the word document
2005-12-12T17:02:00.000Z	reupbert	kbrooks	try OpenOffice.org then
2005-12-12T17:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	reupbert	no, i switched over
