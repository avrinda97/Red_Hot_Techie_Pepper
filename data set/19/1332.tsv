2011-09-11T01:28:00.000Z	Jasonn		Hi, I just deleted everything in my /home/user folder by accident
2011-09-11T01:28:00.000Z	Jasonn		how do I get it back?
2011-09-11T01:29:00.000Z	Jasonn		:/
2011-09-11T01:29:00.000Z	Jasonn		I was not looking to do that
2011-09-11T01:30:00.000Z	Jasonn		and I dont have my ircd services file saved anywhere else
2011-09-11T01:30:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	again, please put the output of mount to a pastebin service
2011-09-11T01:31:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	but its not a separate partition
2011-09-11T01:32:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	do you have physical access to the machine?
2011-09-11T01:32:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	no
2011-09-11T01:32:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	if I did, I could do it
2011-09-11T01:33:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	then in the meantime make sure that no read/writes are performed on that partition and contact the service of your server provider
2011-09-11T01:33:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	creating an image of the partition is not a bad idea. Do you have any spare space on a different partition at hand?
2011-09-11T01:33:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	I have an hdd I can write it on
2011-09-11T01:34:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	Well, time to restart my IRC network. Again.
2011-09-11T01:34:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	then you should be able to perform dd over ssh
2011-09-11T01:35:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	you could still try extundelete on a mounted partition I guess  (assuming it was ext3 or ext4)
2011-09-11T01:35:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	^
2011-09-11T01:36:00.000Z	Jasonn	Fuchs	cant do it?
2011-09-11T01:37:00.000Z	Fuchs	Jasonn	not with the tool mentioned, no
