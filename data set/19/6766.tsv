2008-07-05T15:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	what doesn't work if you install it from the synaptic packages
2008-07-05T15:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	"doesn't work" doesn't mean anything to me, you need to be more specific
2008-07-05T15:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	and for plugin, you need to install java plugin, it's separate from the main java jdk
2008-07-05T15:49:00.000Z	plutarcus	Fryguy--	i've installed also the java-plugin package from synaptic. However, when i try to load an applet, the website says me that java isn't installed...
2008-07-05T15:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	is java listed in about:plugins
2008-07-05T15:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	you need to install it correctly.  Why are you creating symlinks? the installer does this for you

2008-07-05T15:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	what browser are you using
2008-07-05T15:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	did you restart firefox after installing the java plugin?
2008-07-05T15:55:00.000Z	plutarcus	Fryguy--	yes, i did it
2008-07-05T15:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	plutarcus	so now install java and you are all set
