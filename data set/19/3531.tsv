2009-08-08T08:07:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	that doesn't work :(
2009-08-08T08:13:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	doesn't work means?
2009-08-08T08:14:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	What you told me to do doesn't help
2009-08-08T08:14:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	does it reset your panels?
2009-08-08T08:15:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	yes it resets it but doesn't put icons back
2009-08-08T08:15:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	what icons are you missing? that reset put the panel back to its original state.
2009-08-08T08:16:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	when you go to applications, the dropdown shows. On the dropdown, there are no icons to the left of the text
2009-08-08T08:17:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	oh, you said panel. that is different than the drop down from applications.
2009-08-08T08:17:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	have you changed themes?
2009-08-08T08:21:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	I believe I have changed them before, but I am using the human theme now
2009-08-08T08:23:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	you could try a different theme to see if that makes a difference?
2009-08-08T08:24:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	I tried that as well
2009-08-08T08:26:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	gtk-update-icon-cache .. read the man page. it may help?
2009-08-08T08:27:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lukasoft	--validate in particular
2009-08-08T08:31:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	how do I use gtk-update-icon-cache? Nothing happens when I use it in console
2009-08-08T08:33:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	...I don't know where my 'theme' directory is
2009-08-08T08:41:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	well, thanks for the help anyways, but I have to go, bye
2009-08-09T02:35:00.000Z	lukasoft	bastidrazor	you here?
