2007-12-28T08:20:00.000Z	SingAlong		Hi guys.......
2007-12-28T08:21:00.000Z	SingAlong		I just installed Ubuntu Fiesty Fawn on my laptop. Its a Celeron M processor 1.73GHz with 512Mb RAM and 80GB diskspace
2007-12-28T08:21:00.000Z	SingAlong		I am a web developer.
2007-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	SingAlong		I would like to install apache, mysql and php on my laptop...
2007-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	SingAlong		Can the synaptic package manager do the job for me?
2007-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	nickrud	SingAlong	install apache2 , php5 , and mysql-server-5.0
2007-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	SingAlong	i don't have any kde at all, and it seems kubuntu-desktop wants about 221 megs downloaded
2007-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	SingAlong	nickrud	Can I install KDE from the Kubuntu CD?
2007-12-28T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	SingAlong	no, the releases don't match. Feisty is 7.04
2007-12-28T08:54:00.000Z	SingAlong	nickrud	Oh.. Thats what I was wondering about...   :)
2007-12-28T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	SingAlong	what kind of internet. wireless, me? hah

2007-12-28T11:57:00.000Z	nickrud	SingAlong	in a terminal, what does     route -n    say after you try sudo dhclient eth0 ?
2007-12-28T11:58:00.000Z	nickrud	SingAlong	possibly. Put the output of:     ifconfig      and    route -n     on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
