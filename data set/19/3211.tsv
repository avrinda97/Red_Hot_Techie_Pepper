2009-09-30T13:59:00.000Z	archy008		it fixed them but after reboot no sound.... :)
2009-09-30T13:59:00.000Z	archy008		:(
2009-09-30T14:00:00.000Z	archy008		does anybody know what to do to bring the sound and the sound settings back? i'm on ubuntu 9.04
2009-09-30T14:00:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	try doing apt-get update
2009-09-30T14:01:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	though your best bet may be to reinstall your desktop manager due to your unclean shutdown.
2009-09-30T14:02:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	then you can type: alsamixer in your terminal and see if ubuntu is recognizing your sound card. More than likely it will.
2009-09-30T14:04:00.000Z	archy008	godstar	thanks, sorry for the stupid question (not much of an expert yet) - reinstalling the desktop manager wouldn't affect somehow my files and etc..?
2009-09-30T14:05:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	As with any system changes, backing up your data is a good thing. In this case its okay to just reinstall your desktop manager without worrying your files will be affected.
2009-09-30T14:06:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	Anytime.
2009-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	Hmm. Try running Ubuntu from the live cd, if the sound works from there, you could just try to reload altogether.
2009-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	archy008	godstar	what does it mean to reload altogether?
2009-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	Else you could try to troubleshoot.
2009-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	Reinstall Ubuntu.
2009-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	do you have the medibuntu packages installed?
2009-09-30T14:47:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	try running the live cd to make sure your sound card is functioning. You may have to install, some packages for the mp3 to work.
2009-09-30T14:48:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	hmm. Multiple desktop managers will not affect your sound.
2009-09-30T14:49:00.000Z	godstar	archy008	you may want to download the latest ISO from ubuntu.com.
