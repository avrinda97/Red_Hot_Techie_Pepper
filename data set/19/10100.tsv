2006-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	omnid		but fails
2006-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	omnid		I fear so
2006-09-01T16:27:00.000Z	omnid		It's telling me to do a manual 'fsck' what is that?
2006-09-01T16:29:00.000Z	omnid		It says sda1 I think
2006-09-01T16:30:00.000Z	omnid		Also what is fs
2006-09-01T16:30:00.000Z	omnid		filesystem oh
2006-09-01T16:30:00.000Z	omnid		Allright I will try that
2006-09-01T16:31:00.000Z	omnid		I'll go into the boot live CD now
2006-09-01T05:32:00.000Z	omnid		Is there a way to skip the automatic fsck
2006-09-01T05:32:00.000Z	omnid		because of it it does not allow me to get into ubuntu
2006-09-01T05:33:00.000Z	longwave	omnid	you should just let fsck finish. if it doesn't continue into ubuntu afterwards, there is a problem with your drive, surely?
2006-09-01T05:33:00.000Z	omnid	longwave	yeah... I hope not...
2006-09-01T05:33:00.000Z	longwave	omnid	what does fsck say when it finishes? does it drop you into a root shell for recovery, or something else?
2006-09-01T05:35:00.000Z	longwave	omnid	does it continue after that, or are there still errors?
2006-09-01T05:36:00.000Z	omnid	longwave	there are still duplicate block errors after
2006-09-01T05:37:00.000Z	longwave	omnid	it sounds like the filesystem is pretty messed up. your drive may be failing, if it wasn't anything due to anything you did in ubuntu...
2006-09-01T05:39:00.000Z	longwave	omnid	check out those lists before you buy a laptop :)
2006-09-01T05:39:00.000Z	longwave	omnid	look at the links ubotu just said
2006-09-01T05:49:00.000Z	omnid	longwave	it works thanks lawl
