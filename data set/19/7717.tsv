2007-07-06T11:36:00.000Z	ImLukeEkblad		Hi
2007-07-06T11:37:00.000Z	ImLukeEkblad		Yes
2007-07-06T11:37:00.000Z	ImLukeEkblad		90% of people that use computers use windows
2007-07-06T11:39:00.000Z	ImLukeEkblad		Um, I have Ubuntu, and when I installed it, i irased vista home premium and office 07.    So, whats better bout ubuntu since thats all I can use now?
2007-07-06T11:39:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	It's free
2007-07-06T11:40:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	People don't make fun of you for using it
2007-07-06T11:42:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Most programs can be installed and uninstalled with a simple command
2007-07-06T11:42:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	It has a huge support base
2007-07-06T11:42:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	You can change anything about the OS that you want
2007-07-06T11:43:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Provided that you know what you're doing; otherwise you can make it crash really easy
2007-07-06T11:43:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	You'd have to ask someone else about that; I'm just beginning to get used to Ubuntu myself
2007-07-06T12:37:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Still having trouble getting it to see your 1280x800 res?
2007-07-06T12:45:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Exactly which card did you have?  Mine is intel integrated, too..
2007-07-06T12:47:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Mine is an Intel GMA 950, and it works on that
2007-07-06T12:53:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	I dunno if that'd work, 'cause it may be specific to the intel 950..
2007-07-06T12:54:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Here's what I did .. sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and added "universe" to the two main sources .. then sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install 950resolution .. then I rebooted X and I believe it worked
2007-07-06T12:54:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	However, they don't have 940 or 945resolution, so I dunno
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	Try restarting X and see if you can pick your res
2007-07-06T13:01:00.000Z	Truman_	ImLukeEkblad	yay
