2007-11-22T03:10:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp		hi guys, I'm using a bttv capture card connected to an analog camera and the video resulting from that camera is a bit weird:  the bottom half of the video is green and the top half is in grayscale.... anyone know how to fix?
2007-11-22T03:11:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	it sounds like you're using a wrong input setting. Are you using xawtv?
2007-11-22T03:12:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	I'm using "motion"
2007-11-22T03:12:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	I also tried it with ekiga and it looks similarly poopy
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	try with xawtv - it lets you set up the card properly and then motion and ekiga should work, too.
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	ok I'll try that... "sudo apt-get install xawtv" - right?
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	yes
2007-11-22T03:14:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	awesome thanks
2007-11-22T03:16:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	have you seen that motion has a -s option (for setup)?
2007-11-22T03:17:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	don't know what it does, but it sounds useful. Also, motion allows you to set input options via a config file.
2007-11-22T03:18:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	I've completely ignored that option...but I've been playing around with it's config file
2007-11-22T03:19:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	look at the input and norm options in there
2007-11-22T03:20:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	one of the options I noticed was "ffmpeg_deinterlace on" - which I'd like to have work but gives a "file not found" error in the console
2007-11-22T03:21:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	that's not an input option, though. I think your issue is on the input side of things
2007-11-22T03:23:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	you mean theres options for input besides defining "/dev/video0"
2007-11-22T03:24:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	the input and norm options in the motion config file
2007-11-22T03:24:00.000Z	soundray	Oni-Dracula|lapp	man motion
2007-11-22T03:24:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	oh yeah now I know what you're talking about
2007-11-22T03:30:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	soundray	the main differences I see in switching between inputs is the framerate.  Input 1 has a very fast framerate, whereas the others are extremely slow
