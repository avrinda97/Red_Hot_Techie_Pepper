2007-08-07T07:31:00.000Z	kost_		oh and i burned once with poweriso
2007-08-07T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	have you tried the Safe graphics boot option?
2007-08-07T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	no, if that was the problem, it would tell you. Try modifying the kernel command line (F6 I think) and add 'vga=ask'.
2007-08-07T07:51:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	I think you mean me. Look at the bottom of the boot screen, I think you have to hit F6
2007-08-07T07:51:00.000Z	kost_	soundray	yes.. i see and  then what will i see?
2007-08-07T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	the kernel boot command line. Append vga=ask to it
2007-08-07T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	mo, busy
2007-08-07T08:19:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	so you entered vga=ask, hit return and tried to boot with that?
2007-08-07T08:25:00.000Z	kost_	soundray	i typed vga=ask and then i hit space to continue.
2007-08-07T10:56:00.000Z	soundray	kost_	still here?
