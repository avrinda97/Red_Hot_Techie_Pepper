2007-01-21T17:54:00.000Z	goodgerster		oh smeg, thought you meant CMS as opposed to IDE
2007-01-21T17:55:00.000Z	goodgerster		to those concerned: emacs is popular but obscure
2007-01-21T17:57:00.000Z	goodgerster		ah, I saw "PHP" and went "CMS"

2007-01-21T06:08:00.000Z	owh	goodgerster	Have a chat with Angelus.
2007-01-21T06:26:00.000Z	goodgerster	owh	do you know if there was a good reason to not make alternate the default? everything was better in the days of warty
2007-01-21T06:27:00.000Z	owh	goodgerster	Well, the LiveCD-Installer is simpler to use for most people. The alternate CD is for people who want to fiddle.
2007-01-21T06:27:00.000Z	goodgerster	owh	the alternate CD is for people who don't wish to be patronised, it seems
2007-01-21T06:29:00.000Z	owh	goodgerster	No, the alternate CD asks lots of complicated questions that most end users don't need to know or want to know about.
2007-01-21T06:29:00.000Z	goodgerster	owh	such as?
2007-01-21T06:29:00.000Z	owh	goodgerster	LVM/RAID for one.
2007-01-21T06:29:00.000Z	goodgerster	owh	not really. it just displays the option
2007-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	owh	goodgerster	Well, as I said, I've installed Debian for years. I used the installer many times. I have it down to 5 minutes. Still, many people complain about it. The LiveCD or normal installer helps make Ubuntu usable for more people which is a great thing. The Alternate CD is not.
