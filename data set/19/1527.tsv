2011-01-02T18:42:00.000Z	mr_shed		ok, anyone know of a good +robust+ mediaplayer that can handle FLAC files and works well with network shares?
2011-01-02T18:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	if you you need is a plyaer then audacious is cool but there are others that do much more
2011-01-02T18:46:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	I'm struggling to get Rhythmbox and Amarok to work with my NAS shares, so I really just want something that is "guaranteed to work", don't require much more than playlists really.
2011-01-02T18:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	your shares have nothing to do with the players
2011-01-02T18:48:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	I find that Rhythmbox can't load files to the media library - reports an internal bug in the "g-stream" component -  and that Amarok gives me no access to the network folders through its menus.
2011-01-02T18:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	if you just mounted you shares as normal directory with your user that you now play with having normal access to them I wouldn't expect you would see this type of error
2011-01-02T18:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	fix your mounts first
2011-01-02T18:53:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	hmm how would I know if it is an issue with the mounting? what would I check?
2011-01-02T18:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	see if you can read and write to the directory you need to access
2011-01-02T18:55:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	that's the problem, I can w-r-x them perfectly well. I set up the shares months back and nothing was causing me any problems :(
2011-01-02T18:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	does that mean problem solved?  or not?
2011-01-02T18:57:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	nope, still not working well with Rhythmbox
2011-01-02T18:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	from what you wanted my audaciuos sounded good
2011-01-02T18:59:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	I'm going to try that thanks. I'm just not sure why Rhythmbox is having trouble with the NAS share folder. it puzzles me ... I could have made a mistake on the mounting, I'm sure, but I don't see any problems with it anywhere else.
2011-01-02T19:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	your NAS already have /etc/fstab entries I"m sure
2011-01-02T19:04:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	I just checked fstab and no, there are no entries there for the NAS, it just loads like links created at reboot. yet I can w-r-x on the NAS without a problem at all. Strange.
2011-01-02T19:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	mr_shed	and no wonder it don't work all the time
2011-01-02T19:07:00.000Z	mr_shed	sacarlson	indeed .. I guess I just assumed it should be mounted there because of the w-r-x actions I was allowed through Network Places > NAS
