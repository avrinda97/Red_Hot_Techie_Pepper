2010-02-07T21:20:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	I'll assume that you need to have MSN's outgoing and incoming mail server addresses.
2010-02-07T21:22:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	some mail servers require you to use your ISP's outgoing and incoming mail servers.  I use GoDaddy for mail and I have to use my ISP's outgoing server instead of GoDaddys.  Try that.
2010-02-07T21:22:00.000Z	Rush3d	Eremite	How do I find out my ISp's outgoing and imcoming mail servers?
2010-02-07T21:23:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	Im not so sure.  I had to Google mine by typing "ISP name + outgoing mail server" and then I looked through the results until I found something that looked legit.  Sorry I cant be of more assistance to you./
2010-02-07T21:25:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	you cant have your OWN account without having a mail server.  Basically rocket science for the uneducated in computer nonsense.  I use Thunderbird \, not evolution.
2010-02-07T21:28:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	what do you need to know about .bin files?
2010-02-07T21:39:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	what error?
2010-02-07T21:41:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	please type all of your statements in ONE line.
2010-02-07T21:42:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	you might have to install xulrunner
2010-02-07T21:46:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	type  "/join #channelname" without the quotes
2010-02-07T21:47:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	you need to stop asking the same questions so quickly.  Ask your questions all in ONE line of text, without hitting enter first.  We end up losing a lot of what you're saying because you break up your sentenes.
2010-02-07T21:57:00.000Z	Rush3d	Eremite	I get an error when I launch firefox (Error launching browser window:no XBL binding for browser)
2010-02-07T21:59:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	do you have any extensions installed in FireFox?  Start FF in safe mode and then disable allk extensions untill you find the culprit.
2010-02-07T22:00:00.000Z	Rush3d	Eremite	How do I start firefox in safe mode?
2010-02-07T22:01:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	open a terminal and type:  firefox -safe-mode
2010-02-07T22:01:00.000Z	Eremite	Rush3d	make sure that there is not any other firefox process running, even if you have closed all the visible firefox windows.
