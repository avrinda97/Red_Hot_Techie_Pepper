2006-09-04T12:40:00.000Z	holycow	canine_kouji	they all  belong to the proprietary cult
2006-09-04T12:40:00.000Z	holycow	canine_kouji	they have an inability to understand WHY publishing specs helps them, i agree
2006-09-04T12:40:00.000Z	canine_kouji	holycow	yes well, all I can wonder is what will happen is the GPLv3 is forced everywhere, especially IBM. Placing pressure on these corps to release their patents to public use.
2006-09-04T12:46:00.000Z	canine_kouji	holycow	well yeah, linux has more drivers than windows by default. When it messes up though, it really messes up

2006-09-04T12:51:00.000Z	holycow	canine_kouji	wow
2006-09-04T12:51:00.000Z	canine_kouji	holycow	its with most cards, same situation with the intel wireless drivers, but ubuntu includes them by default, even though they're closed source
