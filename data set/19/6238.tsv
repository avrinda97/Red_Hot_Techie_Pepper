2008-02-21T11:32:00.000Z	StaggerLee	n8tuser	i am back. cannot connect to irc.undernet.org either. All i get is an error message like, "Connection failed. Connection timed out" (my translation)
2008-02-21T11:34:00.000Z	StaggerLee	n8tuser	it retries, and fails again
2008-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	StaggerLee	n8tuser	ok i will try, but the same happens with this channel. i'll be right back :)
2008-02-21T11:41:00.000Z	StaggerLee	n8tuser	nope, wont connect to freenode either. it tries to connect to irc.freenode.net (1.0.0.0), on port 6667. Nothing happens until i am told connection has timed out. it tries again and times out again, ad lib
