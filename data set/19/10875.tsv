2006-08-09T10:53:00.000Z	Gumby	Sivik	I have that exact card and got it working without ndiswrapper.  I also got it working with ndiswrapper however I had to compile ndiswrapper from source.  it didnt like my driver for some reason
2006-08-09T10:54:00.000Z	Gumby	Sivik	not sure which driver it was.  Its been on my home partition for about a year now
2006-08-09T10:54:00.000Z	Sivik	Gumby	lucky, mine will finally work and then work like twice and then no longer work
2006-08-09T10:55:00.000Z	Gumby	Sivik	I havnt tested it much as far as changing locations etc yet
2006-08-09T10:55:00.000Z	Sivik	Gumby	my ap is within 3 feet of where i am
2006-08-09T10:55:00.000Z	Gumby	Sivik	well, mine can see and use my AP 100% of the time thus far
