2012-05-11T06:36:00.000Z	Floyd42		apoulos: considering you have 3gb total, i think that's sensible.  you shouldnt experience too much of a slowdown in your host OS as well.
2012-05-11T06:36:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	worst case scenario - whats the worst that would happen? I dont really want to try and work out a dual boot -
2012-05-11T06:38:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	ggolin Ghost_In_Zshell Rosetta stone isnt. its a windows program
2012-05-11T06:39:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	no. Ubuntu 12.04 is my host
2012-05-11T06:43:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	Ghost_In_Zshell I dont have any doubt the copy i have is free of any malware, but the last thing I need is to take the chance - which is why I considered either dualing or a VM. Which ever would be less stress on my PC
2012-05-11T06:44:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	Ghost_In_Zshell Boohbah its not pirated. Its custom built.   the only thing that's stopped me thus far
2012-05-11T06:49:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	too much for the processors. Its a dual core, but the way the ventilation is set up sucks.
2012-05-11T06:57:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	so running a VM with use of 1 of my 3GB of RAM isnt going to do any harm?
2012-05-11T07:00:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	shoot.. well - Im just hoping it wont fry my PC
2012-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	here's my computer's stats: http://pastebin.com/ufYUHrkQ
2012-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	let me know what you think about the VM idea
2012-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	based on my stats
2012-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	well, thats why I've been considering dual booting.
2012-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	whats exactly the worst case scenario in the sense that it would cause my PC to go overboard?
2012-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	would it just slow down and get heated and shutdown? or actually fry my system?
2012-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	as in critically melt something
2012-05-11T07:39:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	then I think I might just want to dual boot it instead of VM
2012-05-11T07:39:00.000Z	APoulos	Floyd42	my PC heats up quite a bit
