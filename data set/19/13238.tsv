2006-03-29T07:42:00.000Z	useruser	neo911	shouldn't do. you just have to worry about the feds
2006-03-29T07:43:00.000Z	neo911		i'm not really sure what am talkin about just want to be safe than sorry
2006-03-29T07:43:00.000Z	neo911		ha ha if i download that's not a problem right? if i share then thats the time the feds will go after me
2006-03-29T07:44:00.000Z	useruser	neo911	bittorrent shares while it downloads, as i understand it
2006-03-29T07:44:00.000Z	neo911	Frogzoo	i d/l this thing called bittornado client
2006-03-29T07:44:00.000Z	useruser	neo911	that's what makes it all work :)
2006-03-29T07:45:00.000Z	neo911		right, then if that's the case why does bittorrent still exist?
2006-03-29T07:45:00.000Z	useruser	neo911	not everything is illegal to share
2006-03-29T07:45:00.000Z	neo911		i have this thing called firestarter installed does that make my comp safer?
2006-03-29T07:46:00.000Z	neo911		i mean more secure?
2006-03-29T07:46:00.000Z	useruser	neo911	you could equally ask why http still exists...
