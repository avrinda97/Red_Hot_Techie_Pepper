2011-05-06T11:35:00.000Z	Guest96092		for old pc
2011-05-06T11:35:00.000Z	Guest96092		just not so powerfull
2011-05-06T11:36:00.000Z	Guest96092		in what package can I find network manager?
2011-05-06T11:38:00.000Z	Guest96092		i would like to install a usb modem stick on lubuntu and don`t know how
2011-05-06T11:38:00.000Z	Guest96092		it is very easy in Ubuntu but lUbuntu is not easy
2011-05-06T11:38:00.000Z	Guest96092		for me
2011-05-06T11:38:00.000Z	Guest96092		what is unetbootin
2011-05-06T11:39:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	so you want to "just use" and USB modem?
2011-05-06T11:40:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	unetbootin is bootable usb creation tool, so probably not related, unless you also want to have bootable usb stick
2011-05-06T11:40:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	I found (an open source, made with Python) usb stick utility from Vodafone site
2011-05-06T11:41:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	which pretty much just worked, not to mention connected about 10 times faster than network-damager
2011-05-06T11:42:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	but, you could try navigating vodafone site, to Linux driver downloads or something liek that
2011-05-06T11:47:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	how much ram is used depends on how many, and what, internet sites you have open...
2011-05-06T11:48:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	with Internet of todya, 512 may be a bit little for power using, but it's completely usable for sure
2011-05-06T11:49:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	note: the line between ubuntu and xubuntu is quite small, you can get xubuntu on any ubuntu by installing "xubuntu-desktop" package
2011-05-06T11:49:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	and if you use xubunut installer, you can get full gnome from "ubuntu-desktop" package
2011-05-06T11:50:00.000Z	arhyttin	Guest96092	so I'd start with xubuntu installer, I think it installs less stuff, and it's always easier to install more than clean up stuff you don't need
