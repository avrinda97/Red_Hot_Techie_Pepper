2009-01-11T01:55:00.000Z	wolter		i am not getting the app name autocomplete feature on the gnome-terminal
2009-01-11T01:56:00.000Z	unop	wolter	try sourcing  /etc/bash_completion
2009-01-11T01:56:00.000Z	wolter	unop	sourcing?
2009-01-11T01:56:00.000Z	unop	wolter	 source /etc/bash_completion
2009-01-11T01:57:00.000Z	wolter	unop	it worked!
2009-01-11T01:57:00.000Z	wolter	unop	will it work everytime i log in, or do i have to enter that command?
2009-01-11T01:58:00.000Z	unop	wolter	you'll have to run that command for every logon - to do that automatically - you'll need to put that command in your ~/.bashrc file
2009-01-11T02:21:00.000Z	unop	wolter	yes
2009-01-13T11:38:00.000Z	unop	wolter	probably but you don't want to do that -- you could backport the package tho
2009-01-13T11:39:00.000Z	unop	wolter	find out.  http://packages.ubuntu.com
2009-01-13T11:40:00.000Z	wolter	unop	ah, it isn't.
2009-01-27T00:13:00.000Z	unop	wolter	 i believe ubuntu already has that setup .. it's just a matter of logging out and logging back in
2009-01-27T00:13:00.000Z	unop	wolter	i.e. if your just created ~/bin
2009-01-27T00:14:00.000Z	wolter	unop	i dont know.. intrepid doesn't seem to have it.
2009-03-08T08:15:00.000Z	unop	wolter	File/Connect To Server - choose SSH there
2009-03-08T08:16:00.000Z	wolter	unop	i need to make a share on my computer and connect to it from a mac.
2009-03-08T08:16:00.000Z	unop	wolter	through ssh right?  just install the openssh-server package
2009-03-08T08:17:00.000Z	unop	wolter	i'm not sure how you mount a remote share on Mac OS X .. but I guess there's a mac channel somewhere if you don't know how.
2009-03-08T08:18:00.000Z	unop	wolter	you shouldn't need to install anything on the Mac, i don't think.  just figure out how to use ssh on it.
