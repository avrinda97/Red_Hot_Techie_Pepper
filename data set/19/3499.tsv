2009-09-22T08:27:00.000Z	innomen		hey all, anyone happen to know how to make open office or abiword save as xhtml?
2009-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	OOwriter File/export
2009-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	xhtml is not among the options
2009-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	Which version of OO?  On 3.0.1 it is the first export option.
2009-09-22T08:30:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	for me pdf is the first option... same version... this is odd
2009-09-22T08:30:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	i think i have it
2009-09-22T08:31:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	File/export not File/export as pdf
2009-09-22T08:33:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	it wont export from an htm, just fyi.
2009-09-22T08:34:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	Interesting.  Maybe save as odf first then export?
2009-09-22T08:35:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	copy pasted to a new file, now i'm having problems with the export function itself, first jre whining now cant save to file, i'm tinkiering
2009-09-22T08:36:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	"file could not be written"
2009-09-22T08:36:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	I have not used the xhtml export myself.
2009-09-22T08:38:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	Sorry to hear that.  OO 3.X has been working very well for me for some time now.
2009-09-22T08:41:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	thank you for your help :) I think abiword is going to be able to do it
2009-09-22T08:45:00.000Z	innomen	Cyrano_De	did you happen to solve the save error? *hope hope hope*
2009-09-22T08:46:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	innomen	I am looking at a fedora bug report that might have some clues.
