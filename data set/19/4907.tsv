2009-11-11T11:34:00.000Z	newmember		From the CLI, how can I get ubuntu to discover NIC changes?
2009-11-11T11:34:00.000Z	newmember		Right now ubuntu cant see my NIC
2009-11-11T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	Does your NIC show up in lspci?
2009-11-11T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	Yes ( do NOT paste the output from that command into the channel )
2009-11-11T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	Really? Are you sure you typed it correctly?
2009-11-11T11:40:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	lspci
2009-11-11T11:40:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	does that look right
2009-11-11T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	Yes
2009-11-11T11:41:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	I do see the e1000 in the dmesg
2009-11-11T11:42:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	I just changed the NIC
2009-11-11T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	It shouldn't matter, network interfaces are detected at boot
2009-11-11T11:43:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	I used minimal install so maybe I am missing a few things
2009-11-11T11:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	Ahh
2009-11-11T11:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	Do you have at least the "ubuntu-minimal" package installed?
2009-11-11T11:44:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	sure, it has been working great for the last week, until I went changed the NIC
2009-11-11T11:44:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	if by "installed" you mean do I have it running
2009-11-11T11:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	No, it's a package "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-minimal"
2009-11-11T11:53:00.000Z	newmember	Jordan_U	Yes ubuntu-minimal is installed
2009-11-11T11:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	newmember	You might want pciutils for lspci
