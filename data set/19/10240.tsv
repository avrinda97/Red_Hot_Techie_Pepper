2006-07-08T12:18:00.000Z	dadgumit		done*
2006-07-08T12:19:00.000Z	dadgumit		ok, I could not get dapper to install, many issues ACPI etc.. and none of the published fixes work (I thin it was an installer issue), I read that many had success by installing breezy and upgrading
2006-07-08T12:19:00.000Z	dadgumit		so trying that
2006-07-08T12:19:00.000Z	dadgumit		instal successfull, but, no X
2006-07-08T12:20:00.000Z	dadgumit		No Screens found, manually reconfigured, nosuccess
2006-07-08T12:21:00.000Z	dadgumit		anyone have any ideas?
2006-07-08T12:22:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	hrm... I don't know much about X, sorry
2006-07-08T12:23:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	you don't have ssh access to that machine?
2006-07-08T12:24:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	so when I'm trying to fix something on another machine that has linux installed, I connect to it with "ssh"
2006-07-08T12:25:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	it allows you to log into the other machine (assuming both are connected to the local network) and do admin stuff from there
2006-07-08T12:25:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	well, both machines need ssh installed (technically, one of them needs sshd)
2006-07-08T12:25:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	what's your situation?
2006-07-08T12:27:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	you still there?
2006-07-08T12:30:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	do you have a knoppix cd on hand?
2006-07-08T12:32:00.000Z	xuxa_	dadgumit	best of luck!
