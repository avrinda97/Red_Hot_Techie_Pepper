2012-04-24T23:29:00.000Z	JPeterso2		should i run do-release-upgrade as su?
2012-04-24T23:29:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	as root, (sudo or su)
2012-04-24T23:30:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	i ran it as a regular user and didn't get any warning as far as i can see
2012-04-24T23:30:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	perhaps your sudo status was still cached.
2012-04-24T23:31:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	If you can do 'do-release-upgrade' as a regular user something is wrong.
2012-04-24T23:31:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	but i still need to run it through sudo right?
2012-04-24T23:31:00.000Z	JPeterso2		regardless if the password is cached or not
2012-04-24T23:31:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	yes, I believe so.  Perhaps if you're not sudo and there is no upgrade it does not error.
2012-04-24T23:36:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	but there is a new version http://pastebin.com/xXJn5mB3
2012-04-24T23:37:00.000Z	JPeterso2		the paste show that do-release-upgrade as user 1000 gives no warning
2012-04-24T23:37:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	what the heck is '[screen is terminating]'  ??
2012-04-24T23:37:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	exiting the upgrader with x
2012-04-24T23:38:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	with x ??  This is on the command line.
2012-04-24T23:39:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	the do-release-upgrade subshell allow exit with input x
2012-04-24T23:39:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	what are you talking about?
2012-04-24T23:41:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	do you not understand? x means the button marked x on the keyboard
2012-04-24T23:41:00.000Z	JPeterso2		right of z
2012-04-24T23:42:00.000Z	deadmund	JPeterso2	Ahh, well, as I said before, it appears there was no upgrade to do so command exited with no errors because it didn't need root to finish.
2012-04-24T23:43:00.000Z	JPeterso2	deadmund	it might be that it warns later. i exited at the first prompt which is the ssh admonition
