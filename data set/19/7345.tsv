2008-07-19T10:17:00.000Z	gnub		I thought it was the other way around
2008-07-19T10:17:00.000Z	gnub		isnt /media for that
2008-07-19T10:19:00.000Z	gnub		I see
2008-07-19T10:21:00.000Z	gnub		What should my fstab entry look like for another ext3 partition
2008-07-19T10:21:00.000Z	gnub		I have /dev/sda5 /media/name but what do I put after that
2008-07-19T10:22:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	 UUID=<device uuid> /media/name ext3 defaults 0 2
2008-07-19T10:22:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	you can find the device uuid with   sudo blkid
2008-07-19T10:24:00.000Z	gnub	nickrud	What if the folder I created in /media has a space so its /media/Data 2
2008-07-19T10:24:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	/media/Data\040\2
2008-07-19T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	erm, /media/Data\0402 that is, no second slash
2008-07-19T10:26:00.000Z	gnub	nickrud	yep that did it
2008-07-19T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	if I may, I really suggest not using spaces in directories, they can be a pain
2008-07-19T10:27:00.000Z	gnub	nickrud	how so
2008-07-19T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	  like   cp <file>   /media/Data 2 won't work as you expect, you'd have to remember to use  /media/Data\ 2 every time.
2008-07-19T10:32:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	could be.  ls -l /dev/disk/by-label will show
2008-07-19T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	try closing firefox ,  mv ~/.mozilla ~/Desktop/mozilla-backup , and restart it
2008-07-19T11:24:00.000Z	gnub	nickrud	That did it, what else can you fix for me tonight? Can you tell me why YouTube videos don't have sound but other flash does lol
2008-07-19T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	nope :) flash sound is a tricky subject. I tried a fix for it myself, and because I got cocky and messed with other stuff, I've got other problems I'm trying to work out now myself ;)
2008-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	nickrud	gnub	if you have some bookmarks in the old config, you can find them in mozilla-backup/firefox/*.default/bookmarks.html. Import that.
