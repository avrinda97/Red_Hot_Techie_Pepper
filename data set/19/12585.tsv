2005-08-10T06:24:00.000Z	BTJustice		I got a little problem with GRUB.  I made a GRUB floppy boot disk.  When I try to boot from it, all it says is GRUB and nothing else and doesn't do anything.  I can't see any files on it in Windows XP (which I am on now).  What should I do so I can boot into my newly installed Kubuntu?
2005-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	does it say something like "grub>" ?
2005-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	You probably want to learn a few basic Grub commands ?
2005-08-10T06:26:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	But the simplest way would probably be to use a Knoppix or an Ubuntu boot cd to install Grub on your MBR
2005-08-10T06:26:00.000Z	BTJustice	lllmanulll	 I stick the floppy in, turn computer on, it read floppy, and all it says is GRUB with a cursor after it.  It does nothing else.  It asks me nothing.
2005-08-10T06:27:00.000Z	BTJustice		I can't install GRUB to MBR.  WIndows XP is on a SATA hard drive (C:)
2005-08-10T06:27:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	Yup, that looks like Grub all right :) It is like a mini-shell, there are commands you can run
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	I see... I don't know a lot about this...
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	Serial-ATA hard drive don't have MBR ?
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	BTJustice	lllmanulll	 It won;t ask me right off the bat if I want to boot Ubuntu?
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	Well it should
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	BTJustice	lllmanulll	 It won't right to its MBR for some reason.
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	But you probably need to install it on the MBR of your first drive...
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	BTJustice		Probably because the only way I can install Linux on my computer is to run "boot: linux pci-noacpi"
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	Sorry, I don't know much more than that
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	You can still try to learn a few basic GRUB commands
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	Should be able to find this with Google
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	But I find it weird it couldn't be installed onto the MBR
2005-08-10T06:32:00.000Z	lllmanulll	BTJustice	I guess Google might help you about this ("MBR" "SATA", etc.)
