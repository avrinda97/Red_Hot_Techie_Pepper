2007-04-21T11:01:00.000Z	verb3k	PriceChild	May I ask a question please?
2007-04-21T11:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	verb3k	what's up?
2007-04-21T11:01:00.000Z	verb3k	PriceChild	if I had a cybercafe and I want to use ubuntu (GNU/Linux in general) can I prevent the person who uses the system from downloading files and packages while maintaining a smooth web browsing experience?
2007-04-21T11:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	verb3k	you could make it so that they have no space to save anything in.
2007-04-21T11:04:00.000Z	verb3k	PriceChild	How to do that....I don't even want to allow any files (not packages ) such as images and the like to be saved through firefox? is there a simple way to do that ? and thanks
2007-04-21T11:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	verb3k	I'm not completely sure as I've never done it myself. I think there's a way to set quotas on users... sorry
2007-04-21T11:06:00.000Z	verb3k	PriceChild	Thanks :) I will do some research to discover that ...thanks for the time
