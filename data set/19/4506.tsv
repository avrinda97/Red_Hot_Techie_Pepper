2010-06-16T15:36:00.000Z	Kingsy101	smerz	- ok cool, thanks.. also one other thing.. whenever I start ubuntu after I type in my log in details it seems to take AGES to load my desktop .. even know I am running a quad core.. once its loaded its nice and fast it just takes a long time intially..
2010-06-16T15:37:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	can you give an indication from completed login to workable desktop in seconds?
2010-06-16T15:38:00.000Z	Kingsy101	smerz	- maybe 15 seconds?
2010-06-16T15:39:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	has it always been like this?
2010-06-16T15:40:00.000Z	Kingsy101	smerz	- on this computer.. yes
2010-06-16T15:42:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	hmm well it should. So it has always been like this for you. For me 15 sec is normal (dual core 2,5ghz). But i got stuff in autostart and a backup running often
2010-06-16T15:45:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	and SSD will give you _insane_ performance. I'd recommend the / partition (except /home) for the ssd (and swap maybe_
2010-06-16T15:46:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	"sudo apt-get install java-jre" should do it
2010-06-16T15:47:00.000Z	Kingsy101	smerz	- it says that it cant find the package java-jre
2010-06-16T15:47:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	hang on let me check which one i got :-)
2010-06-16T15:48:00.000Z	Kingsy101	smerz	- ok thanks
2010-06-16T15:48:00.000Z	smerz	Kingsy101	"sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
