2004-11-16T08:56:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	of course it does..
2004-11-16T08:57:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	if it's an X app you can run it..
2004-11-16T08:57:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	type the name ,see what kind of error message you get
2004-11-16T08:57:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	that doesn't make it "not work" with gnome
2004-11-20T08:46:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	you have to send a written, signed promise to daniels and fabbione that you'll buy them several items from their on-line wishlists... that might speed it up :)
2004-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	kensai	Treenaks	maybe some beers?
2004-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	only after they're done, of course
2004-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	kensai	Treenaks	yeah LOL
2004-11-28T07:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	kensai	you might have to enter your WEP key, but the rest shuold work automagically
