2007-09-16T15:32:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	I don't want to ignore ubotu
2007-09-16T15:33:00.000Z	Ashfire908	cdm10	lol i though you meant he was useing his own bot to spam you
2007-09-16T15:33:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	oh, no, he was using ubotu :)
2007-09-16T15:33:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	thanks for your concern, though
2007-10-21T03:56:00.000Z	Ashfire908	cdm10	he left already
2007-10-21T03:57:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	then he came back... I guess I'm a bit late.
2007-10-22T07:37:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	I'd use DSA, it's what most people use
2007-10-22T07:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	cdm10	but which is better?
2007-10-22T07:38:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	they're both cryptographically very secure
2007-10-22T07:39:00.000Z	Ashfire908	cdm10	well, i'm asking because apparently, dsa is betting but the key lenght is fixed and smaller than the rsa default
2007-10-22T07:42:00.000Z	Ashfire908	cdm10	...just use dsa?
2007-10-22T07:42:00.000Z	cdm10	Ashfire908	that's what I would do
2007-10-22T07:43:00.000Z	Ashfire908	cdm10	k
