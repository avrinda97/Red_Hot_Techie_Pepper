2007-04-02T06:35:00.000Z	eyeonus		I'm currently using the demo OS from the 6.06 install CD, when starting up, after mem check my computer displays a blinking '_' and nothing else. What can I do to fix this short of re-installing? I've attempted re-installing GRUB, as well as using the CD's 'boot from first hard drive' option, but neither works.
2007-04-02T06:35:00.000Z	eyeonus		Yes
2007-04-02T06:35:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Just the memcheck? nothing else? (If so Ram problem?)
2007-04-02T06:37:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Sounds really, really dumb, but leave it at the blinking cursor for a LONG time (like 24-48 hours) -- worked for a dead MythTV box some time ago.
2007-04-02T06:38:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Have you installed a new Hard Drive or have a USB stick/CD in?
2007-04-02T06:38:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Oh, OK. Master should be enough.
2007-04-02T06:39:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Maybe open the machine, unplug the slave and reboot?
2007-04-02T06:41:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	I got a new SATA and took 2 days to realise my machine was not SATA II compat -- one pin jumper change!  :)
2007-04-02T06:41:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Yes, goodluck!
2007-04-02T06:42:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	AhA! Windows XP and Vista re-write the boot sector on install?
2007-04-02T06:43:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	I read this in a nerd magazine.. wait...
2007-04-02T06:45:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	"If you install Windows Vista (or XP) ona machine already running Linux, it will overwrtie the Master Boot Record (MBR) without prompting. "  Linux Magazine Issue 75
2007-04-02T06:47:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Linux Mag article only says how to save the MBR before you install Windows. Yikes. Nothing on resetting. Maybe Grub re-install?
2007-04-02T06:49:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Sorry -- mis-read your earlier comments. :)
2007-04-02T06:50:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Maybe use knoppix to save your /home/ then upgrade to Fiesty? (Sorry, out of other ideas!)
2007-04-02T06:51:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Knoppix = LiveCD with k3b for burning disks of data....
2007-04-02T06:52:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	After trying all else -- !
2007-04-02T06:53:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	Maybe there's a Grub expert here? lHck..?
2007-04-02T06:54:00.000Z	duncan1	eyeonus	I trust you've visited the BIOS to check boot order?
