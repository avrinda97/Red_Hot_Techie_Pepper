2010-05-07T22:23:00.000Z	sweb		i want to get full access to fstab mount point ? which is options?
2010-05-07T22:23:00.000Z	sweb		umast=??? or etc
2010-05-07T22:24:00.000Z	sweb		umask*
2010-05-07T22:24:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	Just add the option "user" to the options for that mountpoint
2010-05-07T22:24:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	Also make sure you have correct permissions over the folder it will be mounted in
2010-05-07T22:25:00.000Z	sweb	edbian	i'm absolutly begginer in fstab options
2010-05-07T22:26:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	That's looking good
2010-05-07T22:26:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	dont' forget the dump and pass options
2010-05-07T22:26:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	0 and 2 out to do it
2010-05-07T22:27:00.000Z	sweb	edbian	can you give me all option, i don't really somevalue such as gid umask or etc
2010-05-07T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	You don't have to tell it all the options because if you don't specify it chooses the defaults.  I have an NTFS partition, my fstab is /dev/hda1  /mnt/xp  /ntfs-3g   defaults,user   0   2
2010-05-07T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	Except for that typo on the file-system type ;)
2010-05-07T22:30:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	Does that makes sense?  You should be able to edit fstab that way and then double click that drive in my computer.  The changes are instant
2010-05-07T22:30:00.000Z	sweb	edbian	thank and how can i find really file system
2010-05-07T22:30:00.000Z	sweb	edbian	fdisk -l
2010-05-07T22:30:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	I just ment there is no slash.  it's simply ntfs.  Ubuntu doesn't use ntfs-3g
2010-05-07T22:31:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	Does that makes sense?
2010-05-07T22:31:00.000Z	sweb	edbian	i'll be test now thank for timing :D
2010-05-07T22:32:00.000Z	edbian	sweb	No problem1
