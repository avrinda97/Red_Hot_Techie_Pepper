2012-05-10T17:26:00.000Z	xskydevilx		How would I upgrade the kernel on 11.04 easily to the newest one available? Like the new 3.x ones?
2012-05-10T17:27:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	backports
2012-05-10T17:28:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	I beg your pardon?
2012-05-10T17:29:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	check the backports repo?
2012-05-10T17:29:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	And how would I do that?
2012-05-10T17:30:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports etc
2012-05-10T17:31:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	No luck so far. Can't I just get a generic kernel and upgrade it manually?
2012-05-10T17:33:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	you can but that is sort of a mess, and if you don't know how to configure and compile a kernel then you will probably fail
2012-05-10T17:40:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	Well I don't have any proprietary stuff installed or anything like that so it should be relatively easy to install it using kernel ppa mainline, right?
2012-05-10T17:43:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	Also, what kind of graphics card are you using?
2012-05-10T17:44:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	oc'ed gxt460
2012-05-10T17:45:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	And there's no flickering or anything? I have a gtx 690, and it seemed to be unstable as hell on Precise.
2012-05-10T17:48:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	those two games are just silly browser/js stuff anyway so you can easily grab them by hand
2012-05-10T17:48:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	indeed
2012-05-10T17:49:00.000Z	Mion	xskydevilx	it's really just a publicity stunt by EA
2012-05-10T17:49:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	Could be.
2012-05-10T17:49:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	Granted if it were my favourite EA game "The Sims 3", that would really be something. But a shortcut to a browser game? Come on..
2012-05-10T18:24:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Mion	I have no idea how, but it seems I have upgraded the kernel to 3.5.5 and installed the proprietary drivers.
