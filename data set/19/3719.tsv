2010-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	jimi_		Does ubuntu support distro upgrades from within the package manager without using cds?
2010-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Yes
2010-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	But only from one version to the next.  (e.g. you can't upgrade directly from 7.04 to 9.10) because you have to skip 7.10, 8.04 and 8.10
2010-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	oh ok, can you point me at documentation for how to do that?
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Open the upgrade manager.  What version are you on?
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	I can just tell you.  It's easier :)
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	i am on 9.10
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Did you open the update manager in system->admin ??  Does it show a distribution upgrade available?
2010-07-12T05:34:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	ah ok, to 10.4 yes ty
2010-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	No problem!  Glad I could help.  Be warned.  It will take about 6 hours to download and upgrade the system.
2010-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	can i use it while its upgrading?
2010-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Yep
2010-07-12T05:36:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Linux is great like that! :)
2010-07-12T06:02:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	it says that support for a lot of my packages has ended, like bluetoth, etc
2010-07-12T06:02:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Be more specific.  How is this a problem for you?  What says that packages are no longer supported?
2010-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	the upgrade manager.
2010-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	So you can't upgrade or?  What?
2010-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	jimi_	edbian	i can upgrade, but i need bluetooth support
2010-07-12T06:04:00.000Z	edbian	jimi_	Well bluetooth is supported in the newer version of Ubuntu.  I can promise that.  I think it might be referring to the packages in your system right now?  I'm not really sure.
