2006-12-05T06:13:00.000Z	toodles		i jsut want something that will run better then xp on this lappy
2006-12-05T06:13:00.000Z	toodles		tony as in installing ubuntu server then install from there?
2006-12-05T06:14:00.000Z	toodles		dragen but are u running kubuntu on a shitty computer?
2006-12-05T06:14:00.000Z	toodles		from what ive read kubuntu seems less laggy then ubuntu due to the gnome or some shit
2006-12-05T06:15:00.000Z	toodles		well this question may make it easier will kubuntu and ubuntu both run faster then xp is running on the machine?
2006-12-05T06:15:00.000Z	toodles		back that is faster then what i have:)
2006-12-05T06:15:00.000Z	toodles		466mhz celeron 256megs of ram laptop is what i have
2006-12-05T06:16:00.000Z	toodles		hahah yeah
2006-12-05T06:16:00.000Z	toodles		well as i said im just looking for something quicker then xp
2006-12-05T06:16:00.000Z	toodles		so if kubuntu would be id rather just run that
2006-12-05T06:16:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	xubuntu is your ticket
2006-12-05T06:17:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	both gnome/kde are too graphic heavy imo for that laptop. xubuntu is much more light weight and should run best.
2006-12-05T06:18:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	you can customize the gui anyway you want.
2006-12-05T06:21:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	it's lightweight, not featureless
2006-12-05T06:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	dapper has LTS (long term support) and is more stable than edgy. edgy is 'bleeding edge' and has a lot of the newest software, thus is prone to more problems.
2006-12-05T06:27:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	dapper
2006-12-05T06:29:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	why would you want to install it from within xp? the install cd is a livecd by default and will bring you into ubuntu. you can play with it without even installing it. then, when you're ready to install there's an "Install" icon on the desktop that will walk you through the install process. It's quite easy.
2006-12-05T06:30:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	yes
2006-12-05T06:31:00.000Z	FirstStrike	toodles	it will run a little slower though because it's running off the cd
