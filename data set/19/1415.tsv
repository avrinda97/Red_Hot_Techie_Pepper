2011-02-01T02:19:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	system, preferences, sound then choose output tab, then at the bottom choose connector analog output
2011-02-01T02:20:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	does that fix your problem?
2011-02-01T02:22:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	there is only this radio button -- internal-analog-audio-stereo
2011-02-01T02:23:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	beneath that it says connector, drop down box choose analog output
2011-02-01T02:24:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	its already analog output
2011-02-01T02:25:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	open terminal type alsamixer and check if the channels are muted
2011-02-01T02:27:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	master 74<>74 ---- pcm 100<>100
2011-02-01T02:28:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	do the channels say MM at the bottom?
2011-02-01T02:28:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	no
2011-02-01T02:29:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	when did the sound stop working?
2011-02-01T02:29:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	after restarting
2011-02-01T02:30:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	was there sound at logon?
2011-02-01T02:31:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	ya it was there. The problem is that after putting headphones the sound also comes from the laptop speaker
2011-02-01T02:32:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	in addition to the headphone output
2011-02-01T02:32:00.000Z	g_o_o	sl33k_	ah ok and if you mute the laptops speakers what happens?
2011-02-01T02:33:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	mutes like normal
2011-02-01T02:38:00.000Z	sl33k_	g_o_o	i think i have disturbed the alsamixer settings, what are recommended/default values?
