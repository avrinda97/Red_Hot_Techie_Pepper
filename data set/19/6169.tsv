2008-03-23T02:02:00.000Z	odysseybmx		can someone tell me how to repair my installation with the Live CD?
2008-03-23T02:03:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	did you make /home a seperate partion?
2008-03-23T02:03:00.000Z	odysseybmx	obiwannekody	what?
2008-03-23T02:03:00.000Z	odysseybmx		I have 1 partition
2008-03-23T02:03:00.000Z	odysseybmx		I need to repair the installation
2008-03-23T02:05:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	if you have your /home directory on a different partion you can(if you are lazy like me) just do a clean install and re-use the /home directory
2008-03-23T02:05:00.000Z	odysseybmx		it's on the same partition
2008-03-23T02:05:00.000Z	odysseybmx		I know there's a way to repair the installation
2008-03-23T02:05:00.000Z	odysseybmx		but how do I go about it?
2008-03-23T02:06:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	what is broken? (everything?)
2008-03-23T02:06:00.000Z	odysseybmx	obiwannekody	X
2008-03-23T02:09:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	i'm sorry, i don't know enough about how ubuntu goes togeather to assist you there, although you could try editing your xorg.conf from the live cd
2008-03-23T02:31:00.000Z	obiwannekody		does anyone in here know if it is possible to set the editor in Eric4 to work like vi/vim?  (and if you do know how to, please let me know?)
2008-03-23T02:32:00.000Z	odysseybmx		how do I mount hda1 in terminal?
2008-03-23T02:32:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	sudo mount /dev/hda1 /path/to/mountpoint
2008-03-23T02:33:00.000Z	odysseybmx	obiwannekody	what doI fill in for mountpoint?
2008-03-23T02:33:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	where do you want to mount it?  you need a folder which doesn't have anything in it, and select that
2008-03-23T02:34:00.000Z	odysseybmx	obiwannekody	what?  I'm in the LiveCD
2008-03-23T02:34:00.000Z	obiwannekody	odysseybmx	ie sudo mkdir /hda  && sudo mount /dev/hda1 /hda  would mount it there
