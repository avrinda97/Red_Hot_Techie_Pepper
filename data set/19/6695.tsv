2008-02-24T13:11:00.000Z	Arelis		I think #ubuntu's being attacked!
2008-02-24T13:11:00.000Z	Arelis		Every time i join here, i get a segfault with all irc clients
2008-02-24T13:11:00.000Z	Arelis		after like 3 seconds
2008-02-24T13:11:00.000Z	Arelis		segmentation fault, a "crash"
2008-02-24T13:12:00.000Z	HinHin	Arelis	are you using xchat?
2008-02-24T13:12:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	yes, i was. I'm in irssi now
2008-02-24T13:13:00.000Z	HinHin	Arelis	Irssi doesn't have that bug
2008-02-24T13:14:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	Hmm.. my Ubuntu's been running for a day and a night (about 24 hours). If it isn't a bug in this channel, then my Ubuntu got unstable pretty fast, since i installed it 3 days ago.
2008-02-24T13:15:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	I remember "elisa" (media center) used to work. Now it gives this error: robin@robin-desktop:~$ elisa
2008-02-24T13:16:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	http://paste.ubuntu.com/4947/
2008-02-24T13:16:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	yesterday, elisa worked.
2008-02-24T13:18:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	Can you see what went wrong when you look at that paste?
2008-02-24T13:19:00.000Z	HinHin	Arelis	not sure... sorry :\
2008-02-24T13:20:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	How could that be, if it worked yesterday?
2008-02-24T13:20:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	Some fault in the harddisk?
2008-02-24T13:20:00.000Z	HinHin	Arelis	lol i sincerely doubt it ;)
2008-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	Well i had problems with my harddrive before, but i hoped to fix that with SpinRite and Western Digital's (harddrive manufactuer) tool that i used to "write zeros"
2008-02-24T13:30:00.000Z	Arelis	HinHin	Okay - so i have a broken Elisa. I'm wondering if a reboot will fix it. If it does, what has caused it?
2008-02-24T13:30:00.000Z	HinHin	Arelis	sorry i'm not the best person to ask about your problem... :\
