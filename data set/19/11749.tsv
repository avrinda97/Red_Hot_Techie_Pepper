2005-12-18T11:16:00.000Z	munzir		Sirs! Now I tried to install 3dchess and it said a dependency is not installable. Shouldn't all dependecies be on the CD
2005-12-18T11:17:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	no
2005-12-18T11:17:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	silly question, since you just told us the answer yourself.  :)
2005-12-18T11:17:00.000Z	munzir	sethk	!!
2005-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	munzir	sethk	what's the logic behind not having a dependency on the CD?
2005-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	not using more than one CD
2005-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	the other distros have anywhere from 2 to 4 CDs
2005-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	suse has even more.
2005-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	if you are connected to the 'net and have your repositories configured, it will install from the CD and fetch the missing dependencies for you automatically
2005-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	munzir	sethk	yes but it's much better IMHO if they include packages with full depndencies until the CD is full and then leave more packages on the net
2005-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	I don't necessarily disagree, but you can see the logic behind putting them on the CD
2005-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	that way they show up in the list of installable programs
2005-12-18T11:20:00.000Z	munzir	sethk	ok now I feel the universe repo is enable already, at least it show up in synaptic what do I need to do to make it work?
2005-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	the default settings should show you a dialog for you to confirm that because of dependencies more stuff will be installed (more than you requested)
2005-12-18T11:27:00.000Z	munzir	sethk	when I choose "mark for installation" it tell me you have unresolvable deps and the deps are not installable and I only have a close button!!
2005-12-18T11:27:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	then you need more repositories.  make sure that for each repository, you have one instance for binary and another for source
2005-12-18T11:28:00.000Z	munzir	sethk	ah! I don't know about this source, any doc to explain how to do this? any help:
2005-12-18T11:30:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	bring up the preferences dialog, repositories.  For each repository you see, click settings, and change it from binary to source.  Then click the add button and add the binary repository back to the list
2005-12-18T11:30:00.000Z	sethk	munzir	sorry, click edit, not settings
