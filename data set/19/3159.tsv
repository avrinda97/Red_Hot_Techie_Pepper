2009-10-15T04:24:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	I don't think it will install.

2009-10-15T04:25:00.000Z	fabiotheg8		?
2009-10-15T04:27:00.000Z	fabiotheg8		if i put adobe on ubuntu is that not ubuntu releated?
2009-10-15T04:27:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	you cannot put it in Ubuntu. It will not install.
2009-10-15T04:28:00.000Z	fabiotheg8	The_Doctor	yes it will, and i have it installed
2009-10-15T04:28:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	does it run?
2009-10-15T04:29:00.000Z	fabiotheg8		I don't know i can't figure out how to run that apps
2009-10-15T04:29:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	then it probably is not installed. You could type the name in a terminal or search your software but probably neither will work.
2009-10-15T04:30:00.000Z	fabiotheg8		it is installed, i have the application installer, and uninstaller in the applications menu
2009-10-15T04:31:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	if it won't start it probably is not really installed.
2009-10-15T04:32:00.000Z	fabiotheg8	The_Doctor	it does install
2009-10-15T04:33:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	then click on the icon and run it. You probably don't have an icon so it is not "really" installed. Type the name in the terminal -- that should make it start -- I'll bet that it doesn't.
2009-10-15T04:38:00.000Z	The_Doctor	fabiotheg8	I just did a Google search and yes you can install Adobe air in Linux. I also did another search on how to use it and found many sites.
