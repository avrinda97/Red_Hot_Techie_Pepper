2009-07-23T05:42:00.000Z	CapaH		Ok let me explain what I am trying to do. I want to create an ip address on *this* machine - like 192.168.1.12 or 10.0.4.1 or whatever -- I want it to be so that anything sent to *that* ip address, on port 22 --- goes to a different ip address, on port 99 --- how can I do that?
2009-07-23T05:43:00.000Z	CapaH		in this way I can ssh to blah@10.0.4.1 instead of ssh to blah@_other_ip -p 99   -- removes the need to specify port
2009-07-23T05:44:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	CapaH	/etc/hosts
2009-07-23T05:44:00.000Z	CapaH		... of course
2009-07-23T05:44:00.000Z	CapaH	Seven_Six_Two	: You can tell etc/hosts an IP address and PORT ?
2009-07-23T05:44:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		that I'm not sure of...
2009-07-23T05:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		squid?
2009-07-23T05:45:00.000Z	CapaH		ah thats what I need
2009-07-23T05:45:00.000Z	CapaH		I need the port
2009-07-23T05:46:00.000Z	CapaH		Is there a way to assign additional ips to this machine? If so I can modify ssh_config to use default ports
2009-07-23T05:46:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		I'm sure squid would do it, although I don't know how easy it is to set up
2009-07-23T05:46:00.000Z	CapaH		... aliases
2009-07-23T05:48:00.000Z	CapaH		yep got it - using alias + /etc/hosts -- got it working
2009-07-23T05:48:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	CapaH	how'd you do the alias part?
2009-07-23T05:49:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		oh nm
2009-07-23T05:50:00.000Z	CapaH	Seven_Six_Two	ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.2.1
2009-07-23T05:50:00.000Z	CapaH		Just creating an internal ip visible to just this machine
2009-07-23T05:50:00.000Z	CapaH		then I can do whatever port forwarding I want on it
2009-07-23T05:50:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	CapaH	nice
