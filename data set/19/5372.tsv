2008-07-18T03:01:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	wordpress requires a !LAMP setup (i.e. apache+php+mysql) -- why don't you install the package from the repositories?
2008-07-18T03:01:00.000Z	lazertek_		anyone know how to install wordpress on hardy
2008-07-18T03:01:00.000Z	unop		!info wordpress | lazertek_
2008-07-18T03:01:00.000Z	lazertek_		ah unop... i did it from the repos but its an older version and didn't install lamp
2008-07-18T03:02:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	any way to get 2.6 from repos or is there another repos for 2.6
2008-07-18T03:02:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	by LAMP i mean apache, mysql and php - installing wordpress automatically pulls these in
2008-07-18T03:03:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	i guess it did install that but how do i launch it now
2008-07-18T03:03:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	i dont see it in the menus
2008-07-18T03:03:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	2.3.3 is the latest in hardy - if you need a newer version, you need to install from source (svn as you mentioned)
2008-07-18T03:04:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	i did that too... guess all i can't figure out is how to launch it
2008-07-18T03:05:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	I'm not sure how you use wordpress either -- all i know is it's something that runs atop a webserver
2008-07-18T03:06:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	that what i read too... guess ill keep asking around if anybody might know
2008-07-18T03:08:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	did you compile anything after checking wordpress out from the SVN respository?
2008-07-18T03:11:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	no
2008-07-18T03:11:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	i though it installed it on its own
2008-07-18T03:11:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	no, that only downloads the source code, you need to do the usual build process as per the INSTALL / README file in the source folder
2008-07-18T03:12:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	hmmm... where would it be?
2008-07-18T03:13:00.000Z	unop	lazertek_	in the directory where you issued the SVN command
2008-07-18T03:14:00.000Z	lazertek_	unop	i found a how to for it... i'll give that a try
