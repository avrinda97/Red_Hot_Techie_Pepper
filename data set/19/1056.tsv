2011-05-27T05:51:00.000Z	nit-wit		! ot | thomb,
2011-05-27T05:52:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	 so asking an ubuntu-related support question is offtopic?
2011-05-27T05:53:00.000Z	nit-wit	thomb	no but the offtoptipc comments are. sigh double sigh
2011-05-27T05:53:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	I'm glad to see that the important things are being taken care of.
2011-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	nit-wit	thomb	the oimportant things are to realize that the world does not revolve around you my friend. Just adding extra comments with no substance is a bit selfish or am I wrong here.;)..
2011-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	Where is the correct place to ask my question?
2011-05-27T05:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	thomb	you were chastised by the launchpad group, back it up and reinstall, if you wangt a working stytem, is what I would do.
2011-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	the system has never bene installed. I'm trying to *install* it.
2011-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	and nobody "chastised" me; one person offered the unhelpful suggestions to run memtest and cd check.
2011-05-27T06:01:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	you are behaving extremely rudely.
2011-05-27T06:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	thomb	I'm sorry you feel that way.
2011-05-27T06:02:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	you have attacked me for saying *sigh* as if this is a major invasion.
2011-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	you then proceeded to incorrectly characterize a question, and offer an absolutely off-topic "answer" that showed that you hadn't paid any attention to it.
2011-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	so in a private message I said I thought you were being unhelpful
2011-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	and you chose to attack me twice again.
2011-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	this is not acceptible.
2011-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	thomb	nit-wit	only I'm entitled to the scolding I see.
2011-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	nit-wit	thomb	okay I would lety it go man we afre here to help each other.
