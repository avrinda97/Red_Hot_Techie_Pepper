2008-06-18T18:58:00.000Z	wgrant		We have official backports for a reason.
2008-06-18T18:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	how do they know its getdeb that caused them problems?.. i find your statement to be complete bs.. as all yuou're doing is downloading packages
2008-06-18T19:00:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Because the applications crashed, or whatever. Inevitably, they'll say "Oh, guess what version I'm using? GetDeb."
2008-06-18T19:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	i think thats more a user malfunction, than a getdeb problem.. Iv'e downloaded programs from there on many occasions, never an issue..
2008-06-18T19:01:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	I'm an Ubuntu dev. I know what I'm talking about, thanks.
2008-06-18T19:01:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Downgrading the package fixed it immediately.
2008-06-18T19:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	so because "you're a dev" i trust you immedately?.. you must be joking.. have you saw the bugs that relesaed in some of the latest versions?.. i wouldn't be bragging
2008-06-18T19:03:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Because I'm a dev, you should put more trust in me than random GetDeb people who like have nothing but animosity between them and Ubuntu developers.
2008-06-18T19:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	anybody on the internet can say anything.. i'll do as i want, and because some screen name who says they are dev, tells me otherwise, well, i'll take my chances, cuz its given me no issues at all
2008-06-18T19:04:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	At least don't suggest it here. Please.
2008-06-18T19:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	i will suggest what i want, when i want.. i've saw getdeb suggested many tiems here w/o issue...
2009-11-01T11:02:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Uh, why not?
2009-11-01T11:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	because of the train wreck the upgrade process has been for many.. i clean installed, and everything was fine
2009-11-01T11:03:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Most upgrades went fine.
2009-11-01T11:03:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Better to probably have a successful upgrade than to definitely reinstall.
2009-11-01T11:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	wgrant	i guess thats a matter of opinion, i'd rather jsut reinstall, rather than brick my system, then reinstall
2009-11-03T11:12:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Not necessarily.
2009-11-03T11:12:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	ipw3945 was shocking for ages.
2009-11-03T11:13:00.000Z	wgrant	IndyGunFreak	Awful.
