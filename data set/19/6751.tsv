2008-01-17T22:16:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	that may not be the real problem thought
2008-01-17T22:17:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	go to command line from that menu (there is a option i forget which) and type boot. and look at all the messages and spot something irregular
2008-01-17T22:17:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	yes you can use your HDTV with linux pretty well. many people with mythtv do that.
2008-01-17T22:17:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	that only works after your livecd is loaded.
2008-01-17T22:18:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	at the main live cd menu look for advanced or something to get the command line. and type boot.
2008-01-17T22:19:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	f6 it is. then look for something irregular in the messages that appeor
2008-01-17T22:19:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	look at the last message you see. may give you pointers.
2008-01-17T22:19:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	try that.
2008-01-17T22:19:00.000Z	sdakak	cnStarz	right
