2012-11-19T22:55:00.000Z	causative		is there any way to do a silent version upgrade?  it's seriously a pain to keep coming back to the upgrade in progress and find it has halted and wants me to click continue
2012-11-19T22:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	typically it should do that.  I think it is a bug if it doesn't
2012-11-19T22:57:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	well, not ask questions.
2012-11-19T23:02:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	it is just good to keep your responses to a single line as well, so other support can happen in this chat as well
2012-11-19T23:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	try: sudo lshw -C networking          see if a driver is loaded
2012-11-19T23:54:00.000Z	causative	ChogyDan	no results
2012-11-19T23:55:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	sudo lshw -C network
2012-11-19T23:55:00.000Z	causative	ChogyDan	I did that and got no results
2012-11-19T23:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	ok.  I posted the wrong command earlier.  I thought that was the issue.
2012-11-19T23:58:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	yeah, that's an issue
2012-11-20T00:02:00.000Z	causative	ChogyDan	results of sudo lshw -C network http://pastebin.com/ByTEdEzk
2012-11-20T00:02:00.000Z	causative	ChogyDan	so is this telling me I don't have the driver for it?  maybe the driver was removed as part of the upgrade?
2012-11-20T00:03:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	that's broadcom, not ath9k.  Right?
2012-11-20T00:04:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	I think so.  I would look into installing broadcom drivers.  I don't know about them; they seem to be a pain for folks
2012-11-20T00:04:00.000Z	causative	ChogyDan	you're right.  So I must have had broadcom drivers previously
2012-11-20T00:07:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	it doubt the upgrade deleted them, but you have a new kernel.  Maybe you just need to reinstall them since they aren't opensource.  I don't know about broadcom stuff.  Try installing linux-headers-generic, and see if you can install them in software sources (if you are running 12.10)
2012-11-20T00:09:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	have you tried booting from an old kernel?  that might work.  And sorry, I have NO experience with broadcom.  I'm just give general hints based on my exprience with nvidia drivers
2012-11-20T00:09:00.000Z	causative	ChogyDan	problem is now solved
2012-11-20T00:10:00.000Z	ChogyDan	causative	lol, ok.  Ya, something like that.
