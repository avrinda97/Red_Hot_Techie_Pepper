2007-06-24T06:10:00.000Z	kane77	Frogzoo	realy? then I'm going to switch to mysql I guess..
2007-06-24T06:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kane77	after about 1000 songs, it's a necessity
2007-06-24T06:11:00.000Z	kane77	Frogzoo	I have about 10 000 and was wondering if it gets any faster...
2007-06-24T06:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kane77	plus it's best to run all your databases on just the one dbms
2007-06-24T06:15:00.000Z	kane77	Frogzoo	so I install mysql-server package?
2007-06-24T06:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kane77	aye, then you'll need to create a user/password to access the db & plug that into amarok's settings
2007-06-24T06:16:00.000Z	kane77	Frogzoo	ok, thx
