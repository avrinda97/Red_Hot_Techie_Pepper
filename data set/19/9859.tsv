2008-05-18T15:43:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	this only delivers the kernel version
2008-05-18T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	uname -a
2008-05-18T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	it'll contain a string like '686' or 'ppc' or 'x86_64'
2008-05-18T15:44:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	what do you need this for?
2008-05-18T15:45:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	choosing the right options for my "make.congf"
2008-05-18T15:45:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	for that, I reckon you need the kernel architecture rather than the processor (if they even differ)
2008-05-18T15:47:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	no it has to be the cpu's, programms get compiled for the cpu, not the kernel
2008-05-18T15:47:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	that's wrong.
2008-05-18T15:48:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	no, a programm gets compiled to assembler code, which is executed by the cpu... not the kernel
2008-05-18T15:48:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	if you compile a program for a 64bit processor, it won't run on a 32bit kernel, even if it's running on a 64bit CPU
2008-05-18T15:49:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	do you even know what a kernel is?
2008-05-18T15:49:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	yes, but i think you run a kernel which fits your cpu architecture
2008-05-18T15:50:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	not necessarily, that's what I'm trying to tell you
2008-05-18T15:50:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	yeah, you told me, allright now
2008-05-18T15:50:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	you can run a kernel that only supports a subset of your CPU's features
2008-05-18T15:51:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	then those features won't be available to your program
2008-05-18T15:52:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	but if you compile your kernel it uses your "make.conf"
2008-05-18T15:53:00.000Z	soundray	trapdoor	are you compiling a kernel now, or a program?
2008-05-18T15:55:00.000Z	trapdoor	soundray	kernel first, recompiling some programs afterwards
