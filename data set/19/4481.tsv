2010-08-13T21:56:00.000Z	sarah32		<arrrghhh> ok
2010-08-13T21:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	wow glad I don't have a radeon video card I see alot of people complain about them
2010-08-13T21:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	I'm sure it is
2010-08-13T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	can't they just force the vesa drive on it to at least get it to boot?
2010-08-13T22:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	also look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-08-13T22:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	well I guess this at least proves your card can work http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKRps2gcGeM
2010-08-13T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	hay I just showing you what I found I thought it was very cool and all you need is hope
2010-08-13T22:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	I wonder if you look in system>administration>hardware drivers if it would show you anything?
2010-08-13T22:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	if not I found this: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.42&lang=English
2010-08-13T22:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	I see in synaptic xorg 1.7.5
2010-08-13T22:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	I would look in system>administration>hardware drivers  first that should be tested by ubuntu already
2010-08-13T22:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	oh but it won't boot now so how do you install it?
2010-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	and that works?
2010-08-13T22:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	sarah32	ok good luck
