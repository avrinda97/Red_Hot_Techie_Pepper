2010-02-23T02:47:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	read http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7568/1.html
2010-02-23T02:50:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	I think I get it now. The encryption key is stored in ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase and that file is encrypted by my user password?
2010-02-23T02:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	seems plausible - I haven't thought it completely through though
2010-02-23T02:51:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	It's important to understand how your computer is secured. :)
2010-02-23T02:52:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	make very sure to record the random generated passphrase though (like on a piece of paper)
2010-02-23T02:52:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	Why?
2010-02-23T02:53:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	Can I not unwrap the key from another system?
2010-02-23T02:53:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	I don't have anywhere secure to store the key. :(
2010-02-23T02:54:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	because its the only way to get to your data when something happens to your permissions on that file (a sure way for that would be to change your password with sudo password user
2010-02-23T02:54:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	not without the recorded passphrase - yoi
2010-02-23T02:54:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	Permissions aren't a problem if I mount the disk from another system, though.
2010-02-23T02:55:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	without the recorded passphrase your content will definitely be lost - believe me - been there done that with someone who didn' t believe it either
2010-02-23T02:56:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	Surely it's just a matter of extracting the passphrase from the wrapped-passphrase file using my user password as the key?
2010-02-23T02:58:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	but that file is within the encrypted part - not accessible - how secure would an encryption system be that could b "easily" cracked by mounting the disk into another system
2010-02-23T02:59:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	The encryption key is hidden inside the encrypted volume?!?!?
2010-02-23T02:59:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	I thought ~/.ecryptfs is an unencrypted directory?
2010-02-23T02:59:00.000Z	guntbert	Samuel-NotAFK	but its your choice - I'm off to bed :-)
2010-02-23T03:00:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	guntbert	Goodnight.
