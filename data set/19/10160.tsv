2006-11-05T16:59:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	to run a sh ./nameof.sh
2006-11-05T17:00:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	you said you had a file named linux-installer.sh so go to the directory its in and do ./linux-installer.sh
2006-11-05T17:01:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	open a terminal and cd to the directory that has the .sh
2006-11-05T17:07:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	do you know where the linux-installer.sh file is located?
2006-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	so using nautilaus can you see the full pathname for the file?
2006-11-05T17:10:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	so do cd /media/cdrom0 like what anto9us said and then after that do ./linux-installer.sh
2006-11-05T17:20:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	when you type "groups" in the terminal does is list cdrom?
2006-11-05T17:33:00.000Z	cpk1	Dab	just use synaptic to install graphics drivers
