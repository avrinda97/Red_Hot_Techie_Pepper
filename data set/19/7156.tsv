2007-12-13T17:38:00.000Z	asjad		yeah i did one thing i shared a folder
2007-12-13T17:38:00.000Z	kelsin	asjad	are you talking about windows computers on your network?
2007-12-13T17:38:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	yes
2007-12-13T17:39:00.000Z	kelsin	asjad	can you still see them by going to "Windows Network" (meaning are they only gone from the first "Network" screen, or are they gone all together?
2007-12-13T17:40:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	i am using ubuntu and when i go to network now i cant see other computers on my network but i can still acces them if i type smb://IP_ADDRESS
2007-12-13T17:40:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	but the network shows nothing
2007-12-13T17:40:00.000Z	kelsin	asjad	normall when you goto network you have an option called "Windows Network" as well as showing other computer directly, can you still access the windows computer by browsing through that or does that not show up?
2007-12-13T17:41:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	yes windows network is there
2007-12-13T17:41:00.000Z	kelsin	asjad	nothing at all?? ... hmmm I was wondering if your workgroup was changed when you started sharing, which is possioble but probably wouldn't cause that
2007-12-13T17:41:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	i double click it but nothing is inside
2007-12-13T17:43:00.000Z	kelsin	asjad	I would double check that your Domain Workgroup (the second tab of Shared Folders) is set to the same thing as the windows computers
2007-12-13T17:44:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	yep it is same MSHOME
2007-12-13T17:46:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	so man any siggestions :?
2007-12-13T17:47:00.000Z	kelsin	asjad	unfortunately no, don't know enough about samba, and unfortunately havn't had that problem
2007-12-13T17:47:00.000Z	asjad	kelsin	thanks anyways man
