2009-07-26T21:21:00.000Z	madagascar27		help I used the ubuntu live-cd and now all i have is a terminal and no interface
2009-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	press on ctrl+alt+F7
2009-07-26T21:25:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	i did but nothing happened just a blank screen
2009-07-26T21:27:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	You might need to install Gnome.
2009-07-26T21:27:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	However I think it's better to first open a post in the forums and see if some can help, if not come back to me and I'll explain to you how to install the Gnome.
2009-07-26T21:27:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	how
2009-07-26T21:27:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	sorry i am using a live dc will it still work?
2009-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	What will work, I don't get you?
2009-07-26T21:28:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	i am using the live CD i thought gnome is already installed
2009-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	You might have chosen not to install Gnome. I have tried the Live CD, I use minimal CD, so I'm not sure what you might have done.
2009-07-26T21:30:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	Get a piece of paper and I'll tell you what to do. OK?
2009-07-26T21:30:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	sure
2009-07-26T21:31:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	First you might want to isntall an IRC client incase if you had any problems. So write down sudo apt-get install irssi (To run it after installation just type irssi)
2009-07-26T21:32:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	Then now install the Gnome.
2009-07-26T21:33:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	how
2009-07-26T21:33:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	sudo apt-get -y instsall gnome-core gdm x11-xserver-utils gnome-utils
2009-07-26T21:34:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	*install
2009-07-26T21:36:00.000Z	madagascar27	moustafaza	thanks
2009-07-26T21:36:00.000Z	moustafaza	madagascar27	np
