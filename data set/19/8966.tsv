2007-01-14T11:47:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	How can I use the LIVE CD for AMD64 in my AMD64 X2 without freezing ?
2007-01-14T11:47:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	I had the same problem even with the 32 bit Live, I think more RAM is the answer
2007-01-14T11:48:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	after load daemons and see the blue screen of Kubuntu..... freaze!\
2007-01-14T11:48:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	same here with Live
2007-01-14T11:50:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	1Gb of RAM is not enought ??
2007-01-14T11:50:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	 I am not sure because I have had similar problems even with the 32 bit one
2007-01-14T11:51:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	you could try the forums
2007-01-14T11:51:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	I have NO problems with 32-bits
2007-01-14T11:51:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	ok... thanxs
2007-01-14T11:55:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	IIRC F6 gives you options
2007-01-14T11:56:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	right! a command line... so what must I write down there ?
2007-01-14T11:56:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	I'd like to peak another kernel
2007-01-14T11:56:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	when the CD starts to play it gives you a chance to select an option, just touch F6
2007-01-14T11:57:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	yes yes... and then ?
2007-01-14T11:57:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	its a command line! not a menu
2007-01-14T11:58:00.000Z	pollywog	Tiger_ar	I think you have a different CD than what I used
2007-01-14T11:59:00.000Z	Tiger_ar	pollywog	I ve both CD LIVE and ALTERNATE
