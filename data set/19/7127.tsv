2007-10-05T09:32:00.000Z	Alfadir_		how do I uninstall steam via wine so I can use it in crossover instead?
2007-10-05T09:33:00.000Z	Alfadir_		how do I do that? I just installed linux a few days ago
2007-10-05T09:33:00.000Z	Alfadir_		it just says steam, Pici
2007-10-05T09:33:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	why tho, i'm just curious because steam & css works perfect w/ wine for me.
2007-10-05T09:34:00.000Z	Alfadir_	pwnt-	I got no sound and lag in steam via wine:(
2007-10-05T09:34:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	strange, what version of wine do you have. "wine --version"
2007-10-05T09:34:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	you can uninstall from menu > wine > steam > uninstall
2007-10-05T09:34:00.000Z	Alfadir_	pwnt-	wine-0.9.46
2007-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	okay hm, look try this before uninstalling, give me some changes in the configuration and it might work
2007-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	write "winecfg" then go to audio, what do you checked there?
2007-10-05T09:36:00.000Z	Alfadir_	pwnt-	it said no audiodriver was selected so it selected OSS driver:P
2007-10-05T09:36:00.000Z	Alfadir_	pwnt-	but that dosnt explain the lag I experienced:/
2007-10-05T09:36:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	change that to ALSA
2007-10-05T09:37:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	maybe you havent followed a new installation guide when you start installing steam w/ wine
2007-10-05T09:37:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	there are few settings you need to follow, so that steam runs smooth. also depends on your hardware if its supported for the game...
2007-10-05T09:37:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	np. try ALSA sound, then try to run steam, see what will happen
2007-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	Alfadir_	pwnt-	no audio and I tried audio test in the cfg but it said failed on bouth ALSA and OSS
2007-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	I'd suggest you to follow an installation guide from the scratch. because it works perfect for me.
2007-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	pwnt-	Alfadir_	check your notice
