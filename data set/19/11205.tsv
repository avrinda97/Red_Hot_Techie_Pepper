2006-03-18T14:16:00.000Z	EBAR		How do I check to see if I'm affected by the recent security bug that was found?
2006-03-18T14:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	an upgrade will fix it
2006-03-18T14:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	grep user-password /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat   if I remember correctly
2006-03-18T14:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	if you've upgraded, there won't be anything there to worry about though
2006-03-18T14:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	URL for the slashdot article?
2006-03-18T14:22:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	gimme a sec, gotta find it
2006-03-18T14:23:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/03/13/0525254&from=rss
2006-03-18T14:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	it's OK - got it at the same momnet :)
2006-03-18T14:24:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	When I grep, I get permission denied. That means I'm patched? Or did I do it wrong?
2006-03-18T14:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	you're patched
2006-03-18T14:25:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	Ah fantastic, thank you.
2006-03-18T14:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	try sudo grep (the file has been made only readable by root
2006-03-18T14:26:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	ok
2006-03-18T14:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	and the clear text is removed
2006-03-18T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	I actually deleted the file before the patch was uploaded
2006-03-18T14:28:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	Yeah I saw that a lot of people were doing that. I had just finished installing Ubuntu onto my laptop. I still have to get to my desktop, but I won't be able to for a couple days.
2006-03-18T14:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	can you ssh to your desktop ?
2006-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	EBAR	thoreauputic	Well, I set it up with Apache just a couple days ago. But I haven't done anything with ssh, I'm still pretty new to linux. I don't have it running as a server quite yet though so it isn't on...thankfully.
2006-03-18T14:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	EBAR	ah, OK :)
