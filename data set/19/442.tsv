2012-10-03T07:17:00.000Z	L3top	unsobill	ivybridge... is a toothache. It can be made happy, for the most part... but... I dont have the novacane on hand and cannot search atm as I have to go back to dev work... but it is common.
2012-10-03T07:17:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	so just grind teeth and move on - great
2012-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	will it be stable on 10.4 ?
2012-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	or 9
2012-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	L3top	unsobill	I would love to walk you through it... but.. I dont have time atm. That should not be a condemnation of the OS fgs.
2012-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	if its lots of work fkit
2012-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	i just go install something more stable then this :(
2012-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	its just everything already setup and my lab is ready on buntu and i kinda started to like it
2012-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	L3top	unsobill	it is EASIER than widows... to do MORE than windows... with regard to reinstall
2012-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	didnt catched that hint - should i reinstall 32 version ?
2012-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	L3top	unsobill	you get to be... unfamiliar and walk away... but it IS easier and faster and amazing in contrast to windows... Windows, which really needs a good doucheing every 9 months if you use it...
2012-10-03T07:24:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	to be honest I'm usually running Freebsd so not fan of Windows but Win7 proved to be much stable on my hardware then 12.4
2012-10-03T07:25:00.000Z	unsobill	L3top	maybe i just need driver or patch who knows
