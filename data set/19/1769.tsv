2010-10-13T01:00:00.000Z	aphid		Hi - I updated to 10.10, now after authenticating I get a pretty desktop background and a mouse cursor that works.. but no UI or menu or anything else
2010-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	   try   ctrl+alt+F1     log in     sudo  restart gdm
2010-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	it sends me back to the authentication screen with (logged in) next to my username.  after I (re)authenticate it takes me back to the empty desktop :S
2010-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	 oooo
2010-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	that's a lot of vowels!
2010-10-13T01:04:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	  ok do  ctrl+a;t+F1  again   log in    then  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade     ...when that is finished     sudo restart gdm if anything installed
2010-10-13T01:07:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	it's downloading, will have the verdict in 10m or so
2010-10-13T01:07:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	 ok :)
2010-10-13T01:23:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	after the downloading - it did the same thing.  put me out to the authentication screen; after authenticating I'm back to the desktop-background image with a cursor but no menu/ui
2010-10-13T01:23:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	 mmm that is not good.   you installed this with live cd?
2010-10-13T01:24:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	no, distribution upgrade
2010-10-13T01:24:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	  mm  ...out of curiosity ...which video card do you have?
2010-10-13T01:24:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	it's a netbook, so something crappy :D
2010-10-13T01:25:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	 can you  alt+F2  on the desktop that has no menu?
2010-10-13T01:26:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	no but I can bring up the restart/shutdown/suspend/hibernate thing
2010-10-13T01:27:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	 ok  I am stumped then... I also never run netbook so my little experience is not going to help with this
2010-10-13T01:28:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	  stick around and ask again...someone here must have some troubleshooting techniques for this
2010-10-13T01:28:00.000Z	aphid	coz_	thanks for the help.  need to take off to a meeting so I will ask again when I get back.  peace
2010-10-13T01:29:00.000Z	coz_	aphid	  sounds like a plan :)
