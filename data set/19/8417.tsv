2007-04-14T11:45:00.000Z	davisc		Anyone have experience with LVM? Specifically having the root partition on LVM?
2007-04-14T11:45:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	Yes--Don't do it with 2.6.20-15-generic in feisty  ;)
2007-04-14T11:46:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	Ah fub :-(
2007-04-14T11:46:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	That's precisely the problem I'm working on right now.
2007-04-14T11:47:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	it can be done with 2.6.17-11-generic from Edgy still.
2007-04-14T11:47:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	No better solution? I really want to use feisty
2007-04-14T11:47:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	use feisty, just stick with edgy's kernel.
2007-04-14T11:48:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	It works for me with 2 servers and a 2.6.20-14 kernel. Just not on my home machine
2007-04-14T11:48:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	or wait for BenC to figure out what broke and fix it.
2007-04-14T11:48:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	Hah
2007-04-14T11:48:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	Might the lvm2create_initrd script help me for the moment?
2007-04-14T11:49:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	you'll need to have the initrd support lvm2, yes.
2007-04-14T11:50:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	Yeah, I figured that's the problem. And since the feisty 2.6.20-14 servers I have can correctly generate the initrd's, I'm guessing something in the 2.6.20-15 changes this
2007-04-14T11:53:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	I heard 2.6.20-14 broke for a lot of people too, so maybe I would have been better off using it.
2007-04-14T11:57:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	Could it be something to do with /dev/loop? Not showing up on my machine
2007-04-14T11:58:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	nope, those are loop devices..
2007-04-14T12:15:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	Any idea if it's a known bug that in rescue mode, the chroot enviroment can't write to some of the partitions?
2007-04-14T12:19:00.000Z	tjcarter	davisc	no, sorry..
2007-04-15T05:19:00.000Z	davisc	tjcarter	BTW, Feisty CD from 2007-04-10 works perfectly with LVM etc (except for the known delay). Won't be upgrading kernel for a while :-)
