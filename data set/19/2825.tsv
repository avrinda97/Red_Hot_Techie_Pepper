2009-12-24T06:10:00.000Z	neezer		so does anybody here know anythign about x11 port forwarding?
2009-12-24T06:10:00.000Z	neezer		I'm looking to remote desktop into my ubuntu server from my ubuntu laptop.
2009-12-24T06:11:00.000Z	neezer		I have ssh working with key authentication no problem.
2009-12-24T06:11:00.000Z	neezer		I can even use the -X tag and run gedit and firefox remotely.
2009-12-24T06:12:00.000Z	neezer		I would like to know how to get the remote desktop to show in a window.
2009-12-24T06:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	it has a desktop?
2009-12-24T06:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	id use nxserver
2009-12-24T06:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	its realy fast especialy over the internet
2009-12-24T06:21:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	i think you could query the display chooser but doing the whole desktop using ssh x11 forwarding might be dog slow, as i said it use nxserver from nomachine
2009-12-24T06:22:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	its realy fast and it tunnels the whole traffic though ssh
2009-12-24T06:27:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	i think there is freenx in the repos no idea how well that works, i allways use the debian packages from nomachine.com, but i would asume that freenx works too
2009-12-24T06:27:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	you need to install the server on your server and the client component on your laptop
2010-07-14T02:47:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	whats the error message and whats your setup?
2010-07-14T02:49:00.000Z	neezer	mgolisch	the error says that the connection was not probided by any settings service.....when I go to the network config -> VPN connections
2010-07-14T02:50:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	sure the stuff you entered there is correct? i never use that networmnagager thing, it never worked for me
2010-07-14T02:51:00.000Z	neezer	mgolisch	I'm not too sure...my server is a clearOS server, but it seems like to config would be on the client side. I really don't have any idea what I should have as far as a config is concerned, or even where it should be.
2010-07-14T02:52:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	do you have any files to connect to it? usualy youll have a config file and certificates
2010-07-14T02:55:00.000Z	neezer	mgolisch	it is pretty simple from what I read. the server system gave me options to download the key, the certification, and all that stuff. there was even a config file that I downloaded but it was a .ovpn file....i put them into /etc/openvpn after I did sudo apt-get install openvpn on the client.
2010-07-14T02:56:00.000Z	mgolisch	neezer	what configuration did you do in networkmanagers vpn thing?
