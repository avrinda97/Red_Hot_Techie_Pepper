2006-12-22T10:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	how much memory did you say the machine has?
2006-12-22T10:22:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	not a lot, 64 MB :(
2006-12-22T10:23:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	you'll need much more than that for gnome to run
2006-12-22T10:23:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	why not try a lighter Windows manager?
2006-12-22T10:27:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	can you boot into single user/recovery mode?
2006-12-22T10:27:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	not on the hd itself, but I can off the cd
2006-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	was grub not configured to add the "recovery" option for your current kernel?
2006-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	it acts the same way as the main boot
2006-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	are you asking me that or telling me that? :)
2006-12-22T10:29:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	I'm telling you that, sorry, it auto reboots also!
2006-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	well, does init tell you where it fails? does the boot get as far as init itself??
2006-12-22T10:33:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	Off the HD, it says ' starting the linux kernel' very fast and then reboots. The CD boots fine but has a terrible interface and can't find the CD for some odd reason.
2006-12-22T10:38:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	the recovery module doesn't work either, but just freezes. So i've got another question, is there anyway to get the 5.04 version working with the respitories...It fails on apt-get and can't get the files to 'update'
2006-12-22T10:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	you need to give me clues to work on :) the retrieval of lists could fail for any number of reasons ...
2006-12-22T10:40:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	are you adding any non-standard repos?
2006-12-22T10:41:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	yeah, I think I removed the commenting from the universal respitory...
2006-12-22T10:41:00.000Z	un_operateur	Jopie	err, what i mean is -- non-ubuntu repos
2006-12-22T10:42:00.000Z	Jopie	un_operateur	no, not at all
