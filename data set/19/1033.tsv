2011-06-05T08:52:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	did they? about time
2011-06-05T08:53:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	well, I don't think Shuttleworth's goal of 200m users will be achieved if ubuntu can't play a simple video
2011-06-05T08:55:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	it can play it with VLC
2011-06-05T08:55:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	 too choppy to watch.
2011-06-05T08:57:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	sylvyor_: It got worse when I installed kvirc and ktorrent
2011-06-05T08:59:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	what cant it handle
2011-06-05T09:00:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	just play one sound at a time
2011-06-05T09:00:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	sylvyor_: I have a hunch that when lots of processes are accessing it, it can't handle.
2011-06-05T09:01:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	even when I am only playing one sound, several process are still interacting with pulse.
2011-06-05T09:02:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	so it slows down, yes?
2011-06-05T09:03:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	it's not the hardware. it's linux
2011-06-05T09:04:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	yes, I understand that.
2011-06-05T09:04:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	and rage.
2011-06-05T09:05:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	natty works perfectly
2011-06-05T09:05:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	with what
2011-06-05T09:05:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	sylvyor_: natty works perfectly for a/v on the same hardware.
2011-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	 I thought it could be kernel modules too.
2011-06-05T09:08:00.000Z	TR4X	mrdeb	it's the first thing the boss will call me in to fix
2011-06-05T09:09:00.000Z	mrdeb	TR4X	tell him to reboot
