2005-01-28T09:57:00.000Z	mwh_		Hi, I just installed a custom kernel and noticed that automounting of usb-devices doesnt work, automounting cdroms do work though, also I can mount the usb-devices manually, anyone know what I should look for in the kernel to have automagic work for usb-devices?
2005-01-28T09:57:00.000Z	sladen	mwh_	why have you needed to install a custom kernel?
2005-01-28T09:59:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	do you know what I should look for?
2005-01-28T10:00:00.000Z	sladen	mwh_	out of interest, why did you need to compile a custom kernel---if there's something you need, we'd rather get it into the default kernel
2005-01-28T10:02:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	out of interest, do you know something about what might be wrong?
2005-01-28T10:02:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	plain yes or no
2005-01-28T10:08:00.000Z	sladen	mwh_	lots of people can probably help if you give more details.  One of the most useful things is an indication of anything you might have changed from the default config.
2005-01-28T10:10:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	its a kernel.org kernel, made from scratch
2005-01-28T10:10:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	hal and udev works nicely
2005-01-28T10:10:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	the device for the usb-key is created
2005-01-28T10:10:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	and hal displays it nicely in the device manager
2005-01-28T10:11:00.000Z	sladen	mwh_	forgive me.  What /doesn't/ work?
2005-01-28T10:12:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	the device is not mounted automagical and nautilus does not show the device
2005-01-28T10:15:00.000Z	sladen	mwh_	could be unrelated.  Is gnome-volume-manager running
2005-01-28T10:16:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	yes it is
2005-01-28T10:20:00.000Z	sladen	mwh_	can you flick back to a different kernel and see if the problem still shows up?  Then compare the output of the kernel messages/hotplug/udev/dbus for the two occasions
2005-01-28T10:22:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	yes I can do that
2005-01-28T10:22:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	two secs
2005-01-28T10:36:00.000Z	mwh_	sladen	hmm its hard to find the source of the problem, it will probably be a while before I find it, thanks for your help so far.
