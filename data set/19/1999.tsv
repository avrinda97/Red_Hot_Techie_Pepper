2010-08-04T01:04:00.000Z	MrJW		hello
2010-08-04T01:05:00.000Z	MrJW		i need helpcompiling something, anyone experienced care to help?
2010-08-04T01:07:00.000Z	MrJW		i have source code, it contains no make/makefile or configure file, the folder only contains *.h *.c and one *.rc file, how do I compile this?
2010-08-04T01:08:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	maybe ask in ##programming?
2010-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	i dont know i was hoping i can figure out what going on with it... it might have possible came form MS
2010-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	so it has nothing to do with the topic of this channel?
2010-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	i can't connect to #ubuntu-help it requires an invite
2010-08-04T01:10:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	what does your issue have to do with ubuntu?
2010-08-04T01:11:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	you are trying to *compile* ..that has nothing to do with ubuntu. Find the documentation on whatever it was that you downloaded, or contact the programmers
2010-08-04T01:11:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	I've read through a few tutorials online about compiling source on the internet, but they don't seem to connect with the source i have.. there is no make or configure files anywhere
2010-08-04T01:12:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	i know the programmer, he made a game engine (EXE) and released the source code, I'm trying to compile it in Ubuntu 9.10
2010-08-04T01:13:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	the programmer doesn't use Linux.
2010-08-04T01:13:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	that makes no difference. It's offtopic here. Contact the programmer. Stop asking here
2010-08-04T01:14:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	stop it now
2010-08-04T01:15:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	could you direct me where i could get some compiler help then?
2010-08-04T01:16:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	I did
2010-08-04T01:17:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	i must have missed your helpful advice,
2010-08-04T01:18:00.000Z	oCean_	MrJW	contact the programmer, does not matter if he uses windows. Or visit channel ##programming.
2010-08-04T01:18:00.000Z	MrJW	oCean_	thanks
