2005-01-27T07:57:00.000Z	bassinboy		are there any ubuntu packages for a newer firefox?
2005-01-27T07:57:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	in the development branch, sure. but warty is stable and supported, so gets security and high-impact bugfixes only.
2005-01-27T07:59:00.000Z	bassinboy	jdub	would it be ok to add dev sources on warty?
2005-01-27T07:59:00.000Z	bassinboy	jdub	my firefox is crashing :P
2005-01-27T07:59:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	no, it's not worth mixing repositories. more trouble than its worth.
2005-01-27T07:59:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	can you get a core file or something?
2005-01-27T08:01:00.000Z	bassinboy	jdub	core file?
2005-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	it's a big hunk of memory that process can dump out when they crash
2005-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	do ulimit -c 0
2005-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	and in the same shell, run firefox
2005-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	if it crashes, you'll get a core file in that directory
2005-01-27T08:03:00.000Z	bassinboy	jdub	the 0 dir?
2005-01-27T08:04:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	-c 0 means "let processes dump unlimited size core files"
2005-01-27T08:04:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	otherwise they don't dump at all
2005-01-27T08:10:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	a crt running at 60Hz will give you headaches or frustrate your eyes
2005-01-27T08:10:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	you should run at the highest refresh rate possible for your resolution/monitor
2005-01-30T17:17:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	switch to?
2005-01-30T17:18:00.000Z	bassinboy	jdub	HrdwrBoB, sorry, kdm is running by default
2005-01-30T17:19:00.000Z	jdub	bassinboy	apt-get install gdm :)
