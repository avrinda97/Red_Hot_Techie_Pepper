2007-05-07T11:13:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	that's what I thought, but it seems not working this way... any ideas? i could paste onto pastebin my 'interfaces'
2007-05-07T11:31:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	: thank u for support :)
2007-05-07T11:34:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	: i will check that way.... seems quite easy, give me some time to check if i can manage to do it alone he
2007-05-07T11:36:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 Yes, I understand that you already have it working on boot.
2007-05-07T11:46:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	: i cant find the package with "apt-get install ifplugd"
2007-05-07T11:47:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 Hmm...  I see it in synaptic.  You running Feisty?  I might have a repo or two that you don't enabled.
2007-05-07T11:48:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	: i am running server LTS edition (6.something)... yes the hard way :)
2007-05-07T11:48:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 It's in "universe".
2007-05-07T11:48:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 Ah...  Well, if it's a server, then don't unplug the cable!  :)
2007-05-07T11:49:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	: it's a server since i didnt have enough power for X .... i need to unplug the cable every some time (voip, game) and when i reconnect the internet should be back again
2007-05-07T11:50:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 I see.  Well, ifplugd does look like a possibility, but I have no idea which, if any, repository has it for LTS 6.x.  Answer posted a link a bit earlier, did you see it?  I didn't check it out, but it might have some good stuff.
2007-05-07T12:08:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 Good luck.
2007-05-07T12:26:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	Answer : no way, i need to type "pon dsl-provider" to get internet....
2007-05-07T12:29:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 (nod)  A quick peek looked like the interface stuff was for boot, but I didn't go over it carefully.  Mm...  probably, yes.  But I'm not the best person to ask about that.  I've been using Linux since it first existed, but Ubuntu - not so long.  You could probably find a .deb package and install it manually.
2007-05-07T12:37:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 While I've been using Linux since about the time it first existed, I'm fairly new to Ubuntu.  I don't frequent any Ubuntu forums at this time.  Hopefully someone else can point you at one. http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/i/ifplugd/  is where the .deb file for ifplugd lives.
2007-05-07T12:38:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 But you'll want to get with someone more familiar with Ubuntu's specifics before you manually install a service.  I could figure it out, but wouldn't want to use you as a test subject. :P
2007-05-07T12:40:00.000Z	Gaspro	YetiChick	: already installed some services (ftp server, ricompiled mldonkey, little things but i tried to follow guides... i'd gladly make a test subject for you if this makes my problem solved (bothering me by a month now ...) but i dont want u to waste considerable amount of time with me :)
2007-05-07T12:44:00.000Z	YetiChick	Gaspro	 You should be able to install ifplugd with dpkg if you download the latest file from the location I gave you.  "dpkg -i <filenae>".  But I'm not sure how much Ubuntu deviates from Debian's file structure, starup and the like.
