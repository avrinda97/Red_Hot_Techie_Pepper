2008-01-14T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	I copied files from a cd to a mounted folder and I can'T boot from that partiton anymore, , twice
2008-01-14T07:12:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	Pelo	my suggestion is try to mount/unmount that partition manually then try to boot from it
2008-01-14T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	trying but I don'T hold much hope
2008-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	I'll have to repair the xp install, I get some kind of blue screen during the boot process, it goes by to fast for me to read it
2008-01-14T07:17:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	Pelo	so u can mount that partition manually?
2008-01-14T07:17:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	that would be a yes
2008-01-14T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	but the problem came after I copied to it from within ubuntu ,  and this is the second time ( if not the third) that this has happened,  second today anyway
2008-01-14T07:18:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	Pelo	so just try to repair xp then, i dont have duo boot atm so i couldn't help
2008-01-14T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	I will,  I just needed to vent a bit,  I just sucks cause I spent 3hrs today resintalling windows from scratch and doing all the updates
2008-01-14T07:19:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	Pelo	i understand, im just saying that ntfs is actually a pretty solid fs, compare to windows
2008-01-14T07:20:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	my problem is with ntfs-3g ,  the linux diver to write to ntfs
2008-01-14T07:20:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	Pelo	my suggestion is make the xp partition smaller and creat a share partition for both os
2008-01-14T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	, it is being considered
2008-01-14T07:21:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	Pelo	so every time u just cp data to the share partition without touch the windows one
