2006-03-15T13:40:00.000Z	_21h_		hello. I'm from Russia. I'm new ubuntu user :)
2006-03-15T13:42:00.000Z	_21h_		DOS API function
2006-03-15T13:43:00.000Z	_21h_		why grub falls to death with usb-keyboard?
2006-03-15T13:44:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	because of the BIOS. You should enable legacy mode for USB.
2006-03-15T13:44:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	i know it. mode is truely setted
2008-09-12T23:13:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	no, that would be a grave mistake
2008-09-12T23:14:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	why?
2008-09-12T23:15:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	so you need to do this only for the files in a particular directory and its subdirectories?
2008-09-12T23:15:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	in all samba share
2008-09-12T23:15:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	'sudo chmod -R /path/to/shared/dir 777'
2008-09-12T23:16:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	yes I do. That's not what you asked about, though
2008-09-12T23:17:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	its not what i need
2008-09-12T23:18:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	after writing permissions on files must be 777
2008-09-12T23:19:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	you want to set a umask then. I'm sure there is an option for it in the samba config, but I don't know how to do it in detail. Start with ubottu's help link and search for umask.
2008-09-12T23:19:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	umask is not i need
2008-09-12T23:20:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	can you try to ask a proper question then, providing detail about your problem?
2008-10-09T00:13:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	check out gnokii
2008-10-09T00:14:00.000Z	_21h_	soundray	gnokii have pipe to evo?
2008-10-09T00:15:00.000Z	soundray	_21h_	I don't know, but you may need gnokii to communicate with it *at all*
