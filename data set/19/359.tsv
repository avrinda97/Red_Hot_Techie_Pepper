2012-06-26T23:21:00.000Z	rinzler		is there a simple volume control that drops down from the menu bar? If there is or was, i must have lost it somehow. PavuControl is getting a lillke too cumbersome
2012-06-26T23:21:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	There is "volumeicon" -- might not be in the repos but it's small

2012-06-26T23:25:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	Thanks!
2012-06-26T23:25:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	No problems
2012-11-07T11:58:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	Depends on your display manager
2012-11-07T11:59:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	xfce
2012-11-07T11:59:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	That's not a display manager, that's a desktop environment
2012-11-07T11:59:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	ubuntustudio is the flavor that I used.
2012-11-07T12:00:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	You can just hit Alt+SysRQ+K
2012-11-07T12:00:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	I don'
2012-11-07T12:01:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	nvm
2012-11-07T12:02:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	Well, generally speaking, sudo /etc/init.d/*dm restart
2012-11-07T12:03:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	how do I tell what my xserver is?
2012-11-07T12:04:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	You mean display manager. You are confused on your terms. A display manager is a tool managing user logins. X (server) is the core of any graphical interface. Finally, the desktop environment is all your panels and stuff, and the window manager is what draws window borders
2012-11-07T12:04:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	Generally, ls /etc/init.d/*dm will give you your display manager's name
2012-11-07T12:05:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	I'm gonna have to read up apparently. Apparently I have lightdm
2012-11-07T12:06:00.000Z	theadmin	rinzler	Ok, well you can use "sudo restart lightdm" then
2012-11-07T12:06:00.000Z	rinzler	theadmin	cool Thanks!
