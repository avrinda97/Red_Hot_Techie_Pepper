2011-05-22T07:53:00.000Z	ippos	ShadowBlade	why not use teamspeak?
2011-05-22T07:53:00.000Z	ShadowBlade	ippos	because my friend just set up a ventrilo server and he wants me to join it.
2011-05-22T07:54:00.000Z	ippos	ShadowBlade	tell them to ditch ventrillo :P or just download its exe chmod +x it and double click
2011-05-22T07:55:00.000Z	ippos	ShadowBlade	open the terminal   type chmod +x       then give a space and drag the exe icon in the terminal then find it and doubleclick on it
2011-05-22T07:56:00.000Z	ippos	ShadowBlade	first do the terminal thing then double click
