2009-07-09T09:54:00.000Z	guillaume		Hello everyone. I just installed an ubuntu Jaunty on an ibook g3 (powerpc) and I'm unable to read movie with mplayer neither totem because of some altivec flags... How can I solve that ?
2009-07-09T09:56:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	have you installed all the plugins?
2009-07-09T09:57:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	Try going to synaptic and installing all the plugins.
2009-07-09T09:58:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	which plugin ? mplayer does not have any and the needed for gstreamer segfault
2009-07-09T09:58:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	There should be 3 sets of plugins for gstreamer. Good, Bad and Ugly
2009-07-09T10:23:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	it does not help
2009-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	try vlc and see what happens.
2009-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	same thing, it crashs
2009-07-09T10:08:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	Illegal instruction ;) I allready googled it... There is lots of people talking about it on internet, but noone give a solution except "buy a new computer"
2009-07-09T10:10:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	theres always the wine option too
2009-07-09T10:10:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	wine ?
2009-07-09T10:11:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	have you any ideo how wine work ?
2009-07-09T10:12:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	well I use Crossover and it kinda just runs the exe files I need it to
2009-07-09T10:12:00.000Z	guillaume	JohnnyZero	you are on x86 ;)
2009-07-09T10:15:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	Unless you can find an old rpm and convert it with alien.
2009-07-09T10:16:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	Have you tried searching for an old rpm file that will install?
2009-07-09T10:21:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	have you looked at this?
2009-07-09T10:24:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	only other thing I can suggest is really delve into google to search for a deb
2009-07-09T10:26:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	guillaume	Its possible someone already did compile it from source.  Check here http://code.google.com/
