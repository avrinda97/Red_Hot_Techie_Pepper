2010-03-24T15:04:00.000Z	vladi		i'm trying to get my new Asus eee pc to work under crunchbang-ubuntu linux but i've got several problems with it... ethernet and wireless neither work (disabled, unclaimed) .. i think it's a problem with drivers, i've read on some forums that there is a solution for this, updating my kernel? or should i manualy set-up my network? ... btw. i think the graphics are not doing as they should too... any ideas anyone?
2010-03-24T15:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 you should proberly use a regular ubuntu, and add whatever light window managers you want to use.
2010-03-24T15:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 what airtonix  said is true also. :)
2010-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 install a lighter window manager and use that instead of gnome
2010-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	vladi	Dr_Willis	anyway...tnx for the help
2010-03-24T15:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 install a lighter window manager and use that instead of gnome   and whatever other tools you like
2010-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	  I just install fluxbox and use whatever wm i like.. and get the same stuff basically on ubuntu
2010-03-24T15:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 well you are using crunchbang..  and trying to do what exactly? Ive frogotten allready..  There is a new reelase of crunchbang out as of yeterday also
2010-03-24T15:47:00.000Z	vladi	Dr_Willis	i'm following a tutorial on their HP, stating that i need to download a bunch of packages in order to get my Atheros drivers working...i've downloaded them all except the one i can't find... i can paste you the URL to the tutorial and see for yourself
2010-03-24T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 I belive you can proberly just install 'build-essentials' and it will grab the proper gcc and g++ files
2010-03-24T15:48:00.000Z	vladi	Dr_Willis	btw. ubuntu 9.10 live-cd didn't have network either
2010-03-24T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 10.04 is due out soon  try it perhaps
2010-03-24T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 ive heard of some new netbooks not having bery good liux support yet.
2010-03-24T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 i imatgien the package you want is -> g++-4.3 - The GNU C++ compiler
2010-03-24T15:52:00.000Z	vladi	Dr_Willis	have you taken a look there?
2010-03-24T15:52:00.000Z	vladi	Dr_Willis	but in that page it's stated i need both...
2010-03-24T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 that guide is also for 'jaunty' it seems - so is old.
2010-03-24T15:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladi	 then the stuff should be in the crunchbang repos.  Im not using jaunty.
2010-03-24T15:55:00.000Z	vladi	Dr_Willis	well..it's not ;)
