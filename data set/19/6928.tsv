2012-06-01T20:34:00.000Z	bakarat		if i set up a static ip in /etc/network/interfaces, it works great...until i reboot, has something changed concerning static ips in 12.04?
2012-06-01T20:34:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	what happens when you reboot?
2012-06-01T20:35:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	well, in general it seems to uses dhcp again though a few days ago i had the weird effect of my pc telling me i had x.x.x.69 (while the fixed one is x.x.x.100) and i could still ping 69 &100
2012-06-01T20:35:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	but basically the system thinks (and acts) like it uses dhcp again
2012-06-01T20:36:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	how're you determining it's using dhcp again?
2012-06-01T20:36:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	well it's a guess based on the fact that it gets the same address it had before i made it static. I have not monitored actual network traffic to see dhcp requests going out
2012-06-01T20:36:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	also, if i restart the networking and network-manager (or combination thereof), it goes back to the static one
2012-06-01T20:37:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	so ifconfig doesn't show the IP you set it to be?
2012-06-01T20:37:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	indeed, until i restart the /etc/init.d/networking & network manager
2012-06-01T20:37:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	and then it is?
2012-06-01T20:38:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	ye seems to be ok then
2012-06-01T20:38:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	maybe networkmanager is getting in the way, hum
2012-06-01T20:38:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	any chance that network manager is doing something it shouldn't? (i have no clue how it works)
2012-06-01T20:39:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	is it actually used for anything else or would it be safe/possible to shut network manager down?
2012-06-01T20:39:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	mostly it's used for wireless network management
2012-06-01T20:39:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	you use wireless networks with this box?
2012-06-01T20:39:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	ah, it's on a desktop computer so not a problem
2012-06-01T20:40:00.000Z	reisio	bakarat	you could try disabling networkmanager from starting at bootup, reboot and see if that helps
2012-06-01T20:40:00.000Z	bakarat	reisio	ye will do, thanks :)
