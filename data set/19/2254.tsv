2012-08-08T21:32:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	which redirects you (this is explained on the ReportingBugs page)
2012-08-08T21:34:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	well it redirects most people
2012-08-08T21:34:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	Must be because I'm a bug-control member
2012-08-17T06:30:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	most of xubuntu is in universe
2012-08-17T06:30:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	Is it?!
2012-09-16T02:34:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	ougogo ^^
2012-10-01T22:48:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	Kikinaak is this what you are looking for? http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise-updates/linux-backports-modules-cw-3.3-3.2.0-31-generic
2012-10-01T22:49:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	Not exactly. Kikinaak needs to download the .deb that that package depends on, put them on a USB device, and move them to the PC with the bad Wifi (as it has no reliable net) . I'm ensuring Kikinaak has all the packages required, not just the virtual/meta packages
2012-10-01T22:50:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	the debs are at the bottom (amd64/i386)
2012-10-01T22:50:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	I know. But that package is virtual. I'm also making sure the dependencies are listed for Kikinaak
2012-10-01T22:51:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	it is not virtual
2012-10-01T22:52:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	It is listed as such in launchpad. Weird. It's only 2.6KB in the LP list
2012-10-01T22:52:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	and its only deps are linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic and dpkg
2012-10-01T22:54:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	maybe you found the meta package on lp?
2012-10-01T22:54:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	I think I did... I got lost in all the cross-references :D
2012-10-01T22:54:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	thanks for digging me out :p
2012-10-01T22:56:00.000Z	trism	TJ-	yes the linux-backports can be quite confusing (especially since you would think they would be in -backports but they are in -updates)
2012-10-01T22:56:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	I was cross-referencing directly into http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-meta/
2012-10-01T22:57:00.000Z	TJ-	trism	 those multiple kernel versions in package names made me dizzy
