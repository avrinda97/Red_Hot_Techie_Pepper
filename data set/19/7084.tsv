2007-11-20T10:37:00.000Z	alber1		well yeh
2007-11-20T10:38:00.000Z	alber1		incase u want to reference it later
2007-11-20T10:39:00.000Z	alber1		militant: i think that's to do with either cache it or flush the transactions
2007-11-20T10:40:00.000Z	alber1		creationist: you prolly need to change ur monitor type, or if that's already correct, change ur video mode list to have that value
2007-11-20T10:40:00.000Z	alber1		militant: lol, if you use flushed it's prolly safer, if u use cached prolly faster, but if power fails u might lose data
2007-11-20T10:41:00.000Z	alber1		kassah: have u tried the compiz settings manager app
2007-11-20T10:41:00.000Z	alber1		haemoth: shutdown -r now, hehe
2007-11-20T10:41:00.000Z	alber1		;)
2007-11-20T10:41:00.000Z	alber1		then write an angry letter
2007-11-20T10:41:00.000Z	alber1		sec
2007-11-20T10:42:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	Well, the monitor selected is correct (Generic LCD Panel 1400x1050), but it's running at 58hz refresh max.  My monitor requires 60hz at it's native resolution.
2007-11-20T10:43:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	What am I looking for?
2007-11-20T10:43:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	It can do 1400x1050x32 at 60hz
2007-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	Good point.
2007-11-20T10:47:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	Yes.
2007-11-20T10:48:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	Right now I have 1400x1050 selected and running at the max of 58hz refresh rate.
2007-11-20T10:48:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	That is my LCD's native.
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	Well, it's a plug-n-play monitor... doesn't need drivers.
2007-11-20T10:49:00.000Z	Creationist	alber1	It's worth noting that the native resolution works flawlessly with the OSS nvidia drivers.
