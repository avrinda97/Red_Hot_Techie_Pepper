2005-07-30T10:13:00.000Z	patrickj		hey guys whats the **best linux ditro?
2005-07-30T10:13:00.000Z	patrickj		in a collective opinion
2005-07-30T10:13:00.000Z	patrickj		for personal use and some webdesign
2005-07-30T10:14:00.000Z	patrickj		personal use and some webdesign
2005-07-30T10:15:00.000Z	patrickj		yes but I was wondering about other distrods
2005-07-30T10:17:00.000Z	patrickj		compiling and command like: yes
2005-07-30T10:17:00.000Z	patrickj		I do like command line lol
2005-07-30T10:17:00.000Z	patrickj		yes
2005-07-30T10:18:00.000Z	patrickj		well How long does it take to build a working gentoo system?
2005-07-30T10:18:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	unless you have a real fast system even though its going totake a few hours
2005-07-30T10:20:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	frankly I rec commend 'vidalinux'
2005-07-30T10:20:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	got very high scores from reviewers and its a real easy setup into gentoo
2005-07-30T10:21:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	you dont need to spend HOURS compiling ( youlll get a i686 system anyway) and can get the rest via soruce IF you wish )
2005-07-30T10:21:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	OR if you rather ....do it  regular way BUT choose stage3/GRP
2005-07-30T10:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	my opinions...you can also choose to do it long compile way IF you have relatively fast system &/or alot of spare time <G>
2005-07-30T10:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	bout same here
2005-07-30T10:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	you'll need several hours then as I did
2005-07-30T10:23:00.000Z	neighborlee	patrickj	unless you do the stage3/GRP route then not as many hours ;-)..or if you go  vida linux you can get it in like 45 minutes
