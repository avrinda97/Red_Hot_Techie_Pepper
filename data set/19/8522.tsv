2009-10-25T14:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	use aplications>accesories>disk use analizer
2009-10-25T14:40:00.000Z	ido_	erUSUL	I've used it but it omits a lot of usage information is there a more SERIOUS disk analyzer
2009-10-25T14:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	you will have to say what usage information you want to see.
2009-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	afaics disk analizer can give you a overview of disk usage and "zoom" in to any folder in the system
2009-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	ido_	erUSUL	 Thanks! I will try it now :-)
2009-10-25T14:45:00.000Z	ido_	erUSUL	Are you sure about the disk analyzer name? I can't google it.
2009-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	i was talking about the one in accesories
2009-10-25T14:47:00.000Z	ido_	erUSUL	no, I mean: afaics
2009-10-25T14:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	sorry ;) afaics <--> as far as i can see
2009-10-25T14:52:00.000Z	ido_	erUSUL	the disk usage analyzer only shows me 13.5 GB of the whole 105GB, and the df -h omits usage information just as well.
2009-10-25T14:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	press the "scan filesystem" button
2009-10-25T14:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	ido_ or scan folder and you will see
2009-10-25T14:55:00.000Z	ido_	erUSUL	that is what I did - "scan filesystem" only showed me a 13.5GB as my overall usage
2009-10-25T14:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	and ? is that worng ?
2009-10-25T14:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	you can then see where the space is being used using the tree view in the left pane
2009-10-25T14:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	you can click in each folder and see the size etc
2009-10-25T14:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	ido_	but only 13,5 giB are bien used? or there is a misunderstanding here ?
