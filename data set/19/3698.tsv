2009-12-23T09:33:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	look up rsync
2009-12-23T09:34:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	usually rsync -av /source /destination

2009-12-23T09:42:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	I'm pretty sure you'll want rsync, which compresses stuff bf sending it to remote computer. google for "rsync over ssh" or something like that
2009-12-23T09:46:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	this link disagrees with me. it says tar is faster than rsync when the destination doesn't have any of the files... in both cases, I think you're assumed to have setup ssh to tunnel everything thru it. so you'll have to google for how to setup an ssh tunnel properly and securely, than read up on how to use tar or rsync over ssh. here's the link http://oreilly.com/pub/h/38
2009-12-23T09:46:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	vajorie	i am reading and trying out this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=238672
2009-12-23T09:48:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	vajorie	 when i try this cat > /etc/cron.daily/remote_backup  in my terminal it gives an error permission denied
2009-12-23T09:48:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	that one's about doing scheduled back ups to a remote location. was that what you want?
2009-12-23T09:50:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	that one's about doing scheduled back ups to a remote location (over ssh that is). was that what you want?
2009-12-23T09:51:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	hmm, I'm asking because if this is a one-time copy, there is no need to deal with cat > ...cron ....
2009-12-23T09:51:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	vajorie	after that i will need to copy from the host onto my local desktop so.. :P
2009-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	in that block of commands that starts with cat and ends with ^D (ctrl+d), ignore everything but this command: rsync -e 'ssh -p 22' -avzp /some/dir remote_host:/var/backups/some_host Do everything it wants you to do for setting up an ssh tunnel, then use that rsync command as guide to send a few test files. if that succeeds, send out the whole thing.
2009-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	vajorie	its working i suppose it says building file list.. initially it was all permission denied.. now its working.. i think
2009-12-23T09:54:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	the cat > ,,,cron... is wrong, don't know why he used that.
2009-12-23T09:59:00.000Z	vajorie	sleepy_cat	here's a better guide trying to do the same thing (have scheduled rsync backups over ssh). useful *not* as a step-by-step guide for you, but as a guide or something... http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/rsync.htm
2009-12-23T10:00:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	vajorie	thanks.. now looking for imagewriter :)
