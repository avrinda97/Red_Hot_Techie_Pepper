2011-09-20T00:47:00.000Z	delinquentme		heres another question .. i go to install Sun- java .. and it seems that nautilus think im running a AMD 64 processor? and therefore wont let me install it?
2011-09-20T00:47:00.000Z	delinquentme		i know for a fact that im running an Intel i5??
2011-09-20T00:48:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	that is 64bit
2011-09-20T00:48:00.000Z	delinquentme	auronandace	so you cant install sun SDK on a 64 bi machine? . and why does it say AMD64/
2011-09-20T00:49:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	amd64 is just the name given to the architecture
2011-09-20T00:49:00.000Z	delinquentme	auronandace	ahh ok thanks
2011-10-06T22:09:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	ghmm?
2011-10-07T19:15:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	ah, sorry, just noticed you said non-repo
2011-10-07T19:17:00.000Z	delinquentme	auronandace	its cool ... this looks like a awesome tool .. so this will build up all the stuff i have installed and chunk it to a CD for easy reinstall?
2011-10-07T19:18:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	i only know of its existence, never used it myself but i'm guessing that you change the sources to include cd and then just install like normal
2012-04-15T22:35:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	or a vm
2012-05-08T19:24:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	better to stick to default repos
2012-05-08T19:25:00.000Z	delinquentme	auronandace	thats shitty advice. dont give it
2012-05-08T19:25:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	we can't support other repos here
2012-05-08T19:25:00.000Z	delinquentme	auronandace	did i ask for support ? or how to add one
2012-05-08T19:28:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	i was merely pointing out that if you add a repo then we can't support it, there have been countless issues here that have resulted from using 3rd party unsupported software
2012-05-08T19:28:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	i hope it works for you
2012-05-08T19:33:00.000Z	delinquentme	auronandace	sorry for blasting you then
2012-05-08T19:34:00.000Z	auronandace	delinquentme	no worries
