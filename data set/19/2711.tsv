2011-10-05T13:44:00.000Z	cutiyar		what to do ?
2011-10-05T13:46:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	short of putting a hold on every package currently installed, or disabling the update-manager, I think ubuntu will always tell you about available upgrades, probably because they could be security upgrades.
2011-10-05T13:47:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	i know about updates but its upgrades from 11.4 its not released its happen when i putted usb disk with 11.10 alpha release
2011-10-05T13:48:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	check /etc/apt/sources.list -- starminn is showing you to a gui that manages that file, but you may have repositories in there listed for oneric, not natty, which is 11.4
2011-10-05T13:49:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	in source.list all are changed to oneiric its my problem
2011-10-05T13:51:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	you need to change every instance of oneric to natty and update your package information. then only the versions available in 11.4 will be available to upgrade to. but if you started the upgrade process and stopped it somewhere along the way, it should have changed everything back to natty for you, if you stopped the upgrade cleanly, that is
2011-10-05T13:52:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	nothing upgraded was just in calculating changes
2011-10-05T13:52:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	when i canceled it
2011-10-05T13:52:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	ah. check in /etc/apt/ and see if it made a backup copy of your sources.list
2011-10-05T13:53:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	it may have also made backups in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ as well. you should be able to use those backups, and update your package information.
2011-10-05T13:54:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	there source.list.save and sources.list.d folder and sources.list.distUpgrade file
2011-10-05T13:54:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	so what should i do now?
2011-10-05T13:55:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	its contain natty
2011-10-05T13:55:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	wonderful. those are your backups.
2011-10-05T13:56:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	just change the name to source.list ?
2011-10-05T13:56:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	and dellte this sourcelist that contain oneiric?
2011-10-05T13:57:00.000Z	sammy	cutiyar	that should do it.
2011-10-05T13:58:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	ok thanks.
2011-10-05T13:59:00.000Z	cutiyar	sammy	Done thanks.
