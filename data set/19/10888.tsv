2009-07-19T02:39:00.000Z	a_		how do I change the default in grub?
2009-07-19T02:39:00.000Z	a_		no wait, I need grub not to come up at all.
2009-07-19T02:41:00.000Z	a_		no idea... I may not.  I must have xp on the internet for work.. and since I loaded ubutu, I can't get my nic card working.  very strange.  reloaded drivers, spent 1.5  hours on line with att today.
2009-07-19T02:43:00.000Z	a_		I was told that there was an occasional problem with ubutu creating a conflict with nic cards and windows xp, but I can't find any explication.  system worked very well before ubutu, and ubutu now will get on the net, but I can boot into windows and get on the net.   can anyone help me?
2009-07-19T02:45:00.000Z	a_		any pros here?  really need help
2009-07-19T02:47:00.000Z	a_		no idea, how do I check.  I just installed ubutu the normal way.
2009-07-19T02:47:00.000Z	a_		this is an ubutu problem.
2009-07-19T02:49:00.000Z	a_		no its is an ubutu problem.  system worked fine before ubutu.  I am on the net with they system now, when I go to windows xp it says the cable is unplugged.
2009-07-19T02:50:00.000Z	a_		I got ubutu because I want to suppor the linux community, but I need xp to make a living.
2009-07-19T02:50:00.000Z	coz_	a_	  did you install xp first and then ubuntu?
2009-07-19T02:50:00.000Z	coz_	a_	  and what is the issue  ...sorry I wasnt here earlier
2009-07-19T02:51:00.000Z	coz_	a_	 ok and is this on a single drive with partitions or two separate hard drives
2009-07-19T02:51:00.000Z	coz_	a_	 ok did you defrag xp before installing ubuntu?
2009-07-19T02:52:00.000Z	coz_	a_	 mm   that be an issue
2009-07-19T02:52:00.000Z	coz_	a_	  a complete defrag of windows is the first step
2009-07-19T02:52:00.000Z	coz_	a_	 that way you can be pretty assured that no windows files will be deleted  if they are way down on the drive or on the partitioni section for linux
2009-07-19T02:53:00.000Z	coz_	a_	 oh
2009-07-19T02:53:00.000Z	coz_	a_	 ok I didnt see that part
