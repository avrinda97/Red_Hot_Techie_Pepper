2007-04-22T06:52:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	its is possible to setup a VPN connection via ipsec, look into "vpnc"
2007-04-22T06:56:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	you want a server setup? ok look into pptpd
2007-04-22T06:56:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	sudo apt-get install pptpd
2007-04-22T06:57:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	i misunderstood your needs, use pptpd
2007-04-22T06:57:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	edit pptpd's config at /etc/pptpd.conf
2007-04-22T06:58:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	well you have a few options, pick one of ours and get back to us! lol
2007-04-22T06:59:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	try one heh
2007-04-22T06:59:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	ubuntu is about choice :p
2007-04-22T07:05:00.000Z	Ax4	mistaWAC	if you installed pptpd, the config will be located in /etc at /etc/pptpd.conf - you can edit it in terminal by running the command 'sudo nano -w /etc/pptpd.conf' or using the GTK text editor by 'sudo gedit /etc/pptpd.conf'
