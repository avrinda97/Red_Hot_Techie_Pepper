2009-06-11T08:32:00.000Z	fireball		oh c'mon, this has gotta be easy, and probably important. WHERE IS MY DESKTOP< WHAT IS WRONG WITH NAUTILUS? PLEASE. . .
2009-06-11T08:33:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Any clues in the system logfiles?
2009-06-11T08:34:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Usually in /var/log for system logs.
2009-06-11T08:37:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	That shouldn't keep the desktop from loading.
2009-06-11T08:38:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	What happens if you type, "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start" at the command line?
2009-06-11T08:39:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Does it load up to a a desktop environment?
2009-06-11T08:40:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	I see.  For some reason I thought you were stuck at a command prompt.
2009-06-11T08:41:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	What was the last thing you did before it stopped working?
2009-06-11T08:43:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Yeah you may want to follow up on the Nautilus errors you mentioned.  Try removing the addons.
2009-06-11T08:46:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	You can always add the Nautilus scripts back after you fix the problem.
2009-06-11T08:51:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Did you remove the addon scripts?
2009-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	That's nautilus crashing.
2009-06-11T09:08:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	What ended up being the thing that allowed it to load?
2009-06-11T09:09:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	I had stepped away from the computer for a few minutes...
2009-06-11T09:10:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Strange.  Oh well, glad your back up and running though.
2009-06-11T09:11:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	welcome
2009-06-11T09:14:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Did you add that extension or is it part of the normal package?
2009-06-11T09:16:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	Remove it then.  Maybe an updated (less buggy) one will be available soon.
2009-06-11T09:17:00.000Z	rob_p	fireball	You may even find that the writer of that extension has an updated one available to address that issue.
