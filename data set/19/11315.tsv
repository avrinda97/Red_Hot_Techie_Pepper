2006-03-01T10:43:00.000Z	eieiyo		how do you find out what kernel comes loaded with the regular ubuntu installation?
2006-03-01T10:44:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	http://packages.ubuntu.com/ shows you the version of all packages for each version of ubuntu, including "linux-image", the kernel
2006-03-01T10:44:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	thanks! ;)
2006-03-01T10:54:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	you can, but it's:  "sudo apt-get install kernel-image-2.4.27-2-386" if you're using dapper.  I'm not sure about breezy.
2006-03-01T10:54:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	and it will downgrade from 2.6 kernel to 2.4?
2006-03-01T10:54:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	I expect you can have both 2.6 and 2.4 installed as binary packages.  they won't conflict.
2006-03-01T10:54:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	ok
2006-03-01T10:55:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	no, you'll effectively be dual booting.  but I looked for breezy and couldn't find the 2.4 kernel, so I'm not sure.
2006-03-01T10:55:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	ok... i have never heard of dapper, so i am going to go look it up
2006-03-01T10:55:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	dapper isn't due for release until April 06
2006-03-01T10:56:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	what? ;) dang!
2006-03-01T10:56:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	it's still unstable...  (firefox broke a few hours ago for non-americans, for instance)
2006-03-01T10:56:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	it's available for testing if you want to try it, but it's very likely to break...
2006-03-01T10:56:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	well, is there any other distributions of linux that you know of that come with 2.4 kernel?
2006-03-01T10:56:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	I've only used ubuntu recently.
2006-03-01T10:56:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	ok
2006-03-01T10:58:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	unless I'm missing something, only warty and dapper have 2.4 kernels ( see here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=image-2.4&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all )
2006-03-01T10:59:00.000Z	dooglus	eieiyo	debian stable has the 2.4 kernel: http://pdo.debian.net/stable/base/kernel-image-2.4-686
2006-03-01T11:00:00.000Z	eieiyo	dooglus	thanks, i will just run debian...
