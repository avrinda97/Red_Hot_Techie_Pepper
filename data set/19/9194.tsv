2006-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	carzzz215		does anyone know why I get "configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables" when I try to compile my alsa sound driver?
2006-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	install build-essential
2006-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	from synaptic?
2006-12-12T07:22:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	yep
2006-12-12T07:37:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	ok...well i got passed that error, and now i have a new one...now i have these permission denied errors and i don't know why cause i used sudo
2006-12-12T07:37:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	put them on a pastebin
2006-12-12T07:39:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	ok...it's http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36527/
2006-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	what was the command that was run?
2006-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	i ran "./configure --with-cards=hda-intel --with-sequencer=yes;make;make install"
2006-12-12T07:42:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	make install needs to be run with sudo
2006-12-12T07:43:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	i'm sorry...i did run it with sudo....but i'll try again
2006-12-12T07:43:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	best to run each command separately (they are separated by ";" in that line) and see which one is producing the errors
2006-12-12T07:44:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	ok, i'll try
2006-12-12T07:44:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	also consider using checkinstall in place of 'make install'...
2006-12-12T07:50:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	ok...i think it was the make command that was starting the problem...do you want to see a paste again?
2006-12-12T07:50:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	i'll take a look, no promises though :)
2006-12-12T07:52:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	ok http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36533/ it's ok if you don't get it....i really appreciate the help regardless
2006-12-12T07:55:00.000Z	fatalcure	carzzz215	line 113 in that paste seems to be the nub of the issue, but I'm not sure what to do.  If no-one else here knows then perhaps do some Googling on the contents of that line
2006-12-12T07:56:00.000Z	carzzz215	fatalcure	ok thanks.  I'll see what i can do
