2010-04-24T22:21:00.000Z	ccherrett		I booted the first time with my nextwork cable installed and I get a connection. I then booted without it and then with it again and ubuntu has lost eth0
2010-04-24T22:21:00.000Z	ccherrett		any ideas?
2010-04-24T22:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	is it still in this state?
2010-04-24T22:25:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	yes
2010-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	in a terminal: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2010-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	no such device when trying ifup etho
2010-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	I did that
2010-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	ok, are you using network manager?
2010-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	no
2010-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	well possibly
2010-04-24T22:27:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	I am a gentoo guy lost in gui land right now :)
2010-04-24T22:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	heh, what does ifconfig show you, no eth0 there?
2010-04-24T22:27:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	it is not there
2010-04-24T22:28:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	it does not show with ifconfig -a
2010-04-24T22:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	wow. All you did was disconnect then reconnect an ethernet cable?
2010-04-24T22:28:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	yeah
2010-04-24T22:28:00.000Z	ccherrett	greezmunkey	well used the laptop without the connection
2010-04-24T22:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	you could try: sudo modprobe forcedeth0 - see what happens
2010-04-24T22:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ccherrett	sounds like the kernel module may have unloaded
