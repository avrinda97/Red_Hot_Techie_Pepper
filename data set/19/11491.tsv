2007-01-26T07:21:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. Is ubuntu running on an AMD64X2?
2007-01-26T07:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	Im sure it does www.ubuntu.com
2007-01-26T07:21:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	Thx
2007-02-14T07:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	yes'
2007-02-14T07:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	or get a edgy cd and do a fresh install
2007-02-14T08:00:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	What about my (ocnfig) data in /home? Can I just copy it? Will KDE (running kubuntu) work then?
2007-02-14T08:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	if you do a fresh install you can do a backup of /home and /etc first and then just replace after installation
2007-02-14T08:01:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	thx
2007-02-14T08:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	than your good to go
2007-02-14T08:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	just make sure you dont format that partition :)
2007-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	I dont see how the configs could differ so much as to make the apps not usable
2007-02-14T08:05:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	I just don't _know_ if they're different
2007-02-14T08:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	probably not . would not make sensde to change the format of configs from one version to next. we would be continuously having to re-enter that info at every update/ upgrade of a app
2008-02-22T06:33:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	Housefly7k: Sorry, didn't know that posting these short (funny) lines isn't tolerated here.
2008-02-22T06:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	short funny lines are distracting #ubuntu-offtopic is full of short funny lines if you like
2008-02-22T06:36:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	I'm really sorry. Just wanted to show pingu how it is like reading his messages ...
2008-02-22T06:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	understood :)
2012-05-17T02:59:00.000Z	vlt	IdleOne	gr33n7007hâ€™s question was about bug #1 from the Ubuntu bugtracker ;-)
2012-05-17T03:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	vlt	which is offtopic and not support related.
