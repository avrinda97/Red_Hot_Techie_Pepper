2010-06-11T02:12:00.000Z	micael		Hello does the server have a gui or is it just command
2010-06-11T02:13:00.000Z	micael		anyone here that knows something about ubuntu server
2010-06-11T02:15:00.000Z	micael		i dont know how to write in command
2010-06-11T02:16:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	if you want the standard ubuntu desktop you can run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2010-06-11T02:17:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	i have the server on a old pc now but it is only command line
2010-06-11T02:18:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	if you need a gui, get to a terminal and run the following command 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' this should set things up so that you have a gui
2010-06-11T02:26:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	will not my server be a ubuntu desktop then
2010-06-11T02:26:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	um, yes? it can still function as a server. the words 'server' and 'desktop' are kinda subjective, they just refer to what you use the server for
2010-06-11T02:27:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	use the *machine for
2010-06-11T02:28:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	ok thanks i was going to install the server in a hp mediaserver that have windows homeserver now
2010-06-11T02:30:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	ya, if you care about efficiency and need something more light weight, you can try xubuntu-dektop (which uses xfce), or set up something yourself
2010-06-11T02:32:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	well i like to have something like the windows home server that i have now
2010-06-11T02:33:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	hm, well, kde is probably most simmilar to a windows environment, so you could try kubuntu-desktop, though kubuntu/kde is probably the most resource intensive out of all your options
2010-06-11T02:34:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	also, I don't know how windows servers work, but most/all of the actual server configutation on linux is going to be done from a command line
2010-06-11T02:39:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	can you start ubuntu server from a nother computer
2010-06-11T02:40:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	erm, what do you mean?
2010-06-11T02:40:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	in my server i dont have for screen only usb and networking
2010-06-11T02:42:00.000Z	alecbenzer	micael	oo...well, you sort of need a screen to configure something I think, though if you can get a screen temporarily you can set up an ssh server and then access your computer from elsewhere like that
2010-06-11T02:43:00.000Z	micael	alecbenzer	ok thanks
