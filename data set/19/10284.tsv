2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	RShadow		can somebody explain to me the apache setup in Ubuntu? I wanted 2.2 but there is no simple way to tell apt-get that I already have apache installed.. so I have went with 2.0 in the repos
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	RShadow		the problem is now I don't know understand the layout.. what is with the sites-enabled sites-available stuff?
2006-07-07T08:08:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	the idea is that the relevant configs for each site/virtualhost go in a file in /etc/sites-available/ and the ones that are symlinked to /etc/sites-enabled/ are loaded when apache starts
2006-07-07T08:09:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	thats was I assumed, but upon a default install instead of getting the page I get a directory index with a folder for the "default" site.
2006-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	strange. you don't have to use them if you don't want to, you can just edit the /etc/apache2/conf/ files directly
2006-07-07T08:11:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	thats my plan.. sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2 and do my own the way the apache folks (and nearly everybody else) wants it done...
2006-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	Ubuntu's config layout is inherited from Debian. It does actually make sense and is way more granular than the default plan of chucking everything in one huge file
2006-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	actualy the 2.2 layout is very logical..
2006-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	it'll probably be in Edgy, but it depends how quickly it's moving into debian
2006-07-07T08:13:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	the one thing what I would love to see is a way to tell apt-get something is already installed.  With Gentoo this was too easy.. made my life easy.. now I'm banging my head trying to learn the "debian/ubuntu" way :(
2006-07-07T08:14:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	unfortunately I've forgotten the name of the package, but there is something that lets you make fake packages to satisfy dependencies
2006-07-07T08:14:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	generally it's just best to stick with packages of things, then you don't have a problem :)
2006-07-14T16:26:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	try moving your firefox profile out of the way too (it's in .mozilla/firefox/ in your home directory)
2006-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	ya.. just toasted that as well
2006-07-14T16:34:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	ya.. looks like profile was the problem.. which sucks :( now I have to go get all my plugins back
2006-07-14T16:34:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	it was probably a plugin or extension that caused it. you can move over individual files into your new profile (like history, bookmarks, passwords, etc.)
2006-07-14T16:35:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	what I can't figure out tho was that everything was working fine, and then today .. blah.. I didn't update anything didn't change anything..
2006-07-14T16:35:00.000Z	Ng	RShadow	hmm, strange
2006-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	RShadow	Ng	very.. only thing I can figure out is perhaps FS didn't shut down correctly or something and something got corrupt.. very strange.. I should have looking in the .mozilla folder before I actualy toasted it tho..
