2005-06-02T11:24:00.000Z	synd		how come FC3 is so much bigger than Ubuntu? ie. it takes 4 install discs
2005-06-02T11:24:00.000Z	nate__	synd	cuz its a bloated piece of poo
2005-06-02T11:25:00.000Z	synd	nate__	is it worth my time checking it out? more importantly is it worth the 4 black CDRs?
2005-06-02T11:25:00.000Z	nate__	synd	it is absolutely not worth your time, it wasn't even worth your time spent thinking about whether it was worth your time
2005-06-02T11:25:00.000Z	synd	nate__	i see. well i just thought about it because i have a few friends that swear by it
2005-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	synd	nate__	and ive yet to see it for myself.
2005-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	nate__	synd	ubuntu is far superior to fedora, i used fedora core 3 before this, and since i tried ubuntu, i will not go back to fedora
2005-06-02T11:27:00.000Z	synd	nate__	i see. maybe i should show them this : D
2005-06-02T11:27:00.000Z	nate__	synd	yes, have them install ubuntu on an extra hdd and see how superior it is to fedora
