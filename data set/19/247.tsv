2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	cordoval		no it is not a hardware problem this works perfect even on ubuntu before
2012-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	cordoval		so it hppens radomly
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	cordoval		i mean there has to be  a way or an explanation NewWorld
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	cordoval		ok i can leave it half way but that does not seem to be a solution
2012-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	cordoval		as it can be on but not recognized
2012-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	cordoval		it is as if ubuntu is lazy recognizing hardware, i think there have been times when i plug after a while and it recognizes it again
2012-05-25T02:32:00.000Z	cordoval		anyone knows what command to run to make ubuntu look for mouse on usb?
2012-05-25T02:33:00.000Z	cordoval		anyone knows how ubuntu recognizes hardwre on the usb ports?
2012-05-25T02:33:00.000Z	cordoval		why is it not working the way it should
2012-05-25T02:34:00.000Z	cordoval		if it is dead then why when i reboot it always works
2012-05-25T02:35:00.000Z	NewWorld_	cordoval	 sorry my internet died. Run dmesg and plug in the mouse , paste output
2012-05-25T02:36:00.000Z	NewWorld_	cordoval	 Now pull it out and paste output. For me it states my mouse disconnected
2012-05-25T02:38:00.000Z	NewWorld_	cordoval	 I think it may be a hardware problem
2012-05-25T02:39:00.000Z	cordoval	NewWorld_	i think it is ubuntu
2012-05-25T02:39:00.000Z	NewWorld_	cordoval	 Probably in the mouse, but I guess maybe the USB slot. Like the contact is bad so the electricity doesn't flow
2012-05-25T02:39:00.000Z	cordoval	NewWorld_	could be
2012-05-25T02:40:00.000Z	NewWorld_	cordoval	 If you want to be sure, try it on another machine
2012-05-25T02:40:00.000Z	NewWorld_	cordoval	 It's not uncommon. I had 2 logitech mice die. Before they died, they only worked if you positioned the wire in a special way
2012-05-25T02:40:00.000Z	cordoval	NewWorld_	lol
