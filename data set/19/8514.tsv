2007-04-15T12:59:00.000Z	neozen		hmm
2007-04-15T13:01:00.000Z	digitalhav0c	neozen	samba?
2007-04-15T13:01:00.000Z	neozen	digitalhav0c	yeah
2007-04-15T13:01:00.000Z	digitalhav0c		!samba
2007-04-15T13:02:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: that's one way
2007-04-15T13:03:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: other way is to stick an ftp server on the desktop... create an account that can access the usb drive.... and then connect to the desktop from your laptop's ftp client
2007-04-15T13:03:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: that's how I did it over here
2007-04-15T13:03:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: hell of a lot easier if you ask me
2007-04-15T13:04:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: downside is that the drive isn't actually mounted on your filesystem
2007-04-15T13:04:00.000Z	digitalhav0c	neozen	i wanted something transparent
2007-04-15T13:04:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: then you're probably going to have to use samba
2007-04-15T13:04:00.000Z	digitalhav0c		yeah
2007-04-15T13:04:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: sorry
2007-04-15T13:04:00.000Z	digitalhav0c	neozen	the destop runs ubuntu sometimes also
2007-04-15T13:05:00.000Z	digitalhav0c		what can i use to network them when using ubuntu on both
2007-04-15T13:05:00.000Z	digitalhav0c		!nfs
2007-04-15T13:05:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: well... then you'll have to stick a samba server on the desktop ubuntu as well
2007-04-15T13:05:00.000Z	neozen		digitalhavoc: you should be able to get away with just having the client on the laptop
2007-04-15T13:05:00.000Z	digitalhav0c	neozen	ok thanks
