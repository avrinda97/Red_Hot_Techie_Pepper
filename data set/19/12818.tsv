2005-07-03T14:50:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	you're lucky
2005-07-03T14:50:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	you missed the days where if you wanted X you compiled it yourself :P
2005-07-03T14:51:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	yeah, unless you planned ahead and bought a card that was known to work
2005-07-03T14:51:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	back then, there was none of this 'oh no, gotta have amazing 3d performance' so you just bought whichever 512k or 1MB card worked best with what you wanted to do :)

2005-07-03T15:53:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	i preferred the old console-switch key :(
2005-07-03T15:54:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	its also useful for kernel debugging, vaguely
2005-07-03T15:55:00.000Z	monchichi	nikkia	how so?
2005-07-03T15:55:00.000Z	nikkia	monchichi	alt-sysreq is the kernel debugging key
