2005-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	bdmp		I got another question the faq says put the plugin file in the plugins folder and then run " Go into your gaim/plugins dir in your extrated gaim source. Save unicode.c into that dir, make sure you have a ~/.gaim/plugins dir and then do $make unicode.so
2005-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	bdmp		$cp unicode.so ~/.gaim/plugins/
2005-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	bdmp		" but the firest command "make" comes back with "make: *** No rule to make target `unicode.so'.  Stop. What rule do I need?
