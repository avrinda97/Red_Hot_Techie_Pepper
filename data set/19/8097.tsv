2009-04-01T12:19:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	killasll nm-applet && nm-applet
2009-04-01T12:19:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	err s/killasll/killall
2009-04-01T12:20:00.000Z	psypher246	ziroday	nope still get network manager is not connected and this on the console: ** (nm-applet:17742): WARNING **: nm_client_get_devices: error getting devices: The name org.freedesktop.NetworkManager was not provided by any .service files
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	tried restarting?
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	psypher246		why?
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	psypher246		i shouldn't have to and i want to klnow how
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	psypher246		so annoying, it keeps changing every new ubuntu
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	sure, try do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	psypher246		done it already
2009-04-01T12:21:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	and its to find out if that error is even related to network manager running or not
2009-04-01T12:22:00.000Z	psypher246		shouldn't i be doing it with dbus>?
2009-04-01T12:22:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	are you an application?
2009-04-01T12:22:00.000Z	psypher246		all i did was restart hal according to a howto to get multitouch working and since then network manager is dead
2009-04-01T12:23:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	right, and its extrememly hard to get network manager working again. The simplest way is to restart
2009-04-01T12:23:00.000Z	ziroday	psypher246	what does nm-tool output?
2009-04-01T12:24:00.000Z	psypher246	ziroday	it's really dumb, such an important thing should be easily restarted
2009-04-01T12:28:00.000Z	psypher246	ziroday	NetworkManager appears not to be running (could not get its state).
2009-04-01T12:28:00.000Z	psypher246	ziroday	nm=tool
