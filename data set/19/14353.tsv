2005-04-23T12:32:00.000Z	keyvan__		hey folks i was hoping someone could lend a hand with burning an ISO in linux, apparently cdrecord is the key, and that only works with scsi devices (mine is ide), now it seems i need to add a line in the grub config file, but i dnot know where that is, as it is not the default path here in ubuntu, any help?
2005-04-23T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	keyvan__	it works fine with ATAPI drives
2005-04-23T12:32:00.000Z	keyvan__		ah
2005-04-23T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	keyvan__	cdrecord dev=/dev/hdX (replace X)
2005-04-23T12:33:00.000Z	keyvan__		then perhaps i am using hte wrong command? i used this command and it yielded in a bad disk after 10 seconds of "Fixating"
2005-04-23T12:33:00.000Z	keyvan__		ah okay, and it does track at once
2005-04-23T12:33:00.000Z	keyvan__		yeah debian3x, thats what i foudn while googling and thats why i asked about the grub config file path
2005-04-23T12:33:00.000Z	crimsun		it should not be necessary to use ide-scsi
2005-04-23T12:33:00.000Z	crimsun		cdrecord does support ATAPI natively
2005-04-23T12:34:00.000Z	crimsun		you might want to ensure that your ATAPI drive has DMA enabled
2005-04-23T12:35:00.000Z	keyvan__		sheesh
2005-04-23T12:35:00.000Z	keyvan__		alrighty, and crimsun, how do i make it use disk at once instead of track at once?
2005-04-23T12:35:00.000Z	keyvan__		there seems not to be a switch for that
2005-04-23T12:36:00.000Z	keyvan__	Debian3x	its very easy
2005-04-23T12:36:00.000Z	crimsun	keyvan__	-dao
2005-04-23T12:36:00.000Z	keyvan__		yeah? it didnt work crimsun i tried... maybe my cdrecord is outdated or something.. it says defaulting to tao when i do that...
2005-04-23T12:36:00.000Z	keyvan__		yeah
2005-04-23T12:36:00.000Z	keyvan__		is it because its CDrecord Clone?
2005-04-23T12:36:00.000Z	crimsun	keyvan__	if your burner supports BURNFREE or whatever, look at driveropts, too
