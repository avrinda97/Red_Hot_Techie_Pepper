2008-01-15T09:34:00.000Z	osiri1		sorry, alright here it is, i have to reconfigure xserver, and everything goes dandy, but when i get to selecting 24 bit color, 16, 15, etc. i choose 24(default that it is on) and the terminal comes up saying "postinst warning: overwriting possibility-customised configuration file; backup in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.(numbers
2008-01-15T09:34:00.000Z	osiri1		okay?
2008-01-15T09:35:00.000Z	osiri1		gekko, i think wubi works well, i believe it installs 7.04
2008-01-15T09:35:00.000Z	osiri1		what does it mean?
2008-01-15T09:35:00.000Z	osiri1		dang...anyone have ideas?
2008-01-15T09:36:00.000Z	osiri1		i can restart the whole xserver configuration, again..?
2008-01-15T09:36:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	what happens when you say "go"... and do it.
2008-01-15T09:38:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	is that an ati card?
2008-01-15T09:39:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	might be an intel card needing the i81x driver..
2008-01-15T09:40:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	ok.. like erawfish said.. use synaptic and search for i810
2008-01-15T09:40:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	?  what do you mean ?  are you familure with synaptic?
2008-01-15T09:43:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	check out erawfish line to me with dpkg etc..  do you see it.
2008-01-15T09:44:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	using the dpkg line?
2008-01-15T09:45:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	yes  select i810
2008-01-15T09:46:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	to name it?  not sure what you mean there...  no.. you might have to install the driver from synaptic.. you're in a terminal right?
2008-01-15T09:48:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	did you every have the gui loaded? if so to run the dpkg reconfigure option you had to get to a terminal.. like a dos box.
2008-01-15T09:48:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	does that ring a bell?  is that what you are in?
2008-01-15T09:49:00.000Z	scuizi	osiri1	ok.. try to right mouse click ... if a menu pops up choose "open new tab"
