2007-09-14T11:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	you may want to read up on the ubuntu packing system and apt-get. it makes it all rather easy once ya learn the basics
2007-09-14T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	i just pasted that easysource site that does the same thing.
2007-09-14T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	but most of the opackages you need are in the basic repo sites. Which are not all enabled by default.
2009-12-28T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	 formating is easy.. partiioning is the harder part
2009-12-28T18:34:00.000Z	axz	Dr_Willis	why?
2009-12-28T18:35:00.000Z	axz	Dr_Willis	because i want to use this HD just for storage music ect...
2009-12-28T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	 partioning a drive is a much different task then just 'formating'    the 2 are not the same thing. :)
2009-12-28T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	 you partition the disk into filesystems, then format the filesystems.
2009-12-28T18:43:00.000Z	axz	Dr_Willis	when my new HDDisk ask for table type is mddos recommended for regular linux usage?
2009-12-28T18:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	axz	 yes.
