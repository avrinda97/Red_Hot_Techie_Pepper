2006-11-04T15:56:00.000Z	Rappermas		and I can't figure out how to install the OpenGL header files
2006-11-04T15:56:00.000Z	Rappermas		which is unfortunate because the engine is quite capable
2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		this is about my, ahhh, hmmm, 7th distro since a year ago
2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		looks good and there is a lot of packages available
2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		but i can't seem to install the OpenGL development header files that I need
2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		but I know that other people have gotten it to work
2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		however, google isn't very helpful
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Rappermas		i don't know, i just figured that there would be someone here that does development in OpenGL
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Rappermas		i'm sure you guys wouldn't be too happy if I was working on a Windows DirectX engine :D
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Rappermas		!opengl
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Rappermas	 really?
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Rappermas	 cool... any progress...
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		yes, the graphics are amazing
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		running OpenGL
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		but since I switched Ubuntu I can't program anymore
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		I was going to do a few bug fixes and then work on audio today
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Rappermas	 well ... any games yet ?
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		but I can't even compile the engine
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas	effie_jayx	they're coming :d
