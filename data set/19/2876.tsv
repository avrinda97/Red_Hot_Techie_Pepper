2009-12-07T23:08:00.000Z	lyeeth		uh hey, im running ubuntu server 9.10 and i have problems with mounting a windows server 2008r2 smb as well as nfs shares. it applies to both. i can mount fine and everything works except that filenames (specifically special characters) are borked (example: schreibgeschützt shows up as schreibgeschÃ¼tzt) || mount -t cifs //ip/share /folder/folder -o user=user,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 is the command i use to
2009-12-07T23:08:00.000Z	lyeeth		 mount

2009-12-07T23:10:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	give me a minute
2009-12-07T23:11:00.000Z	grawity	lyeeth	(IRC tends to have a lot of problems with encodings.)
2009-12-07T23:11:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	well, what i wrote was utf8, and yeah, its supposed to look weird :P
2009-12-07T23:12:00.000Z	grawity	lyeeth	*shrug* I have utf8 too, but.

2009-12-07T23:17:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	left is as it should be, right is as it is
2009-12-07T23:17:00.000Z	grawity	lyeeth	I have a feeling that it is your terminal with UTF-8 disabled... Is it PuTTY?
2009-12-07T23:17:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	its not the terminal, its the same when i log in at the machine
2009-12-07T23:17:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	but yeah, its putty
2009-12-07T23:18:00.000Z	grawity	lyeeth	But still, try this... Ctrl+RightClick on the PuTTY window, choose "Change Settings". Go to Window --> Translation. Enter "UTF-8" as character set. Click Apply. Then run the 'ls' command again.

2009-12-07T23:19:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	i probably fixed it hours ago, i just never saw it :P
2009-12-07T23:19:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	thanks so much, ive been on this a week or so :(
2009-12-07T23:20:00.000Z	grawity	lyeeth	And even when you login locally, the GNOME Terminal has a "Character set" menu under Tools.
2009-12-07T23:20:00.000Z	lyeeth	grawity	its server, i dont have a gui :)
2009-12-07T23:20:00.000Z	grawity	lyeeth	Ah. Same applies to the text-mode console though - UTF-8 mode and ANSIsomething mode.
