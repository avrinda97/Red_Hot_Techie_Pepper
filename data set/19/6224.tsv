2008-05-08T01:39:00.000Z	dholbert	Lapinux	"mark for complete removal" in synaptic
2008-05-08T01:39:00.000Z	Lapinux	dholbert	that seems to leave stuff behind
2008-05-08T01:39:00.000Z	dholbert	Lapinux	what stuff behind
2008-05-08T01:39:00.000Z	dholbert	Lapinux	and are you sure you did complete removal?
2008-05-08T01:40:00.000Z	dholbert	Lapinux	rather than just "mark for removal"?
