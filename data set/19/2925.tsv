2009-11-24T12:27:00.000Z	mditto		After an update, my wifi doesn't work with WPA any more.  How can I diagnose WPA or figure out what the update did and undo it?
2009-11-24T12:28:00.000Z	teamcoltra	mditto	I had this issue: Try sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-karmic-generic
2009-11-24T12:28:00.000Z	mditto	teamcoltra	I'll try, thanks
2009-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	mditto	teamcoltra	"Couldn't find package..."
2009-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	mditto		oh, I guess I have to connect to a network... heh
2009-11-24T12:31:00.000Z	teamcoltra	mditto	you are using karmic right?
2009-11-24T12:31:00.000Z	mditto		I don't know, it's a brand new Dell A90n, Ubuntu 8.04
2009-11-24T12:32:00.000Z	teamcoltra	mditto	so you are not updated to karmic yet
2009-11-24T12:32:00.000Z	teamcoltra		Try updating to karmic first
2009-11-24T12:33:00.000Z	mditto	teamcoltra	 I guess Dell stays with LTS release, which would be fine with me if it works :)
2009-11-24T12:33:00.000Z	teamcoltra		Yeah... upgrade to the latest client
2009-11-24T12:33:00.000Z	teamcoltra		and it will probz fix any problem you are having
2009-11-24T12:34:00.000Z	teamcoltra		ooor go search the forum there may have been a patch
2009-11-24T12:34:00.000Z	mditto	teamcoltra	OK, thanks
2009-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	teamcoltra	mditto	you should be able to do it via the update manager
2009-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	teamcoltra		just change your settings from long term release to nromal
2009-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	teamcoltra		System -> Admin -> Software Sources
2009-11-24T12:37:00.000Z	mditto	teamcoltra	Software sources doesn't seem to list that option.  Tabs are Updates, Third-Party Software, and Authentication
2009-11-24T12:39:00.000Z	teamcoltra	mditto	you have a query from me
