2005-12-19T12:32:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	in cases like that, I complete the installation skipping the boot loader, and install grub manually
2005-12-19T12:32:00.000Z	amm60omy	sethk	how do i do that?
2005-12-19T12:32:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	the install let's you skip the boot loader, so that part's easy
2005-12-19T12:33:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	then you have to boot a rescue cd (or floppy)
2005-12-19T12:33:00.000Z	amm60omy	sethk	when do i get the chance to skip the boot loader?
2005-12-19T12:33:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	installing grub manually is very easy, especially if you can copy (recursively) the /boot directory from another ubuntu install (same version and architecture)
2005-12-19T12:33:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	in expert install it is right on the main menu.  Not sure on the default install, but I think it is just a prompt.
2005-12-19T12:34:00.000Z	amm60omy	sethk	ok cool, ill look for it, thank you
2005-12-19T12:37:00.000Z	amm60omy	sethk	one last thing, does it matter if im installing Ubuntu on a hd with my Windows xp partition
2005-12-19T12:38:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	of course that has to be reflected in the grub configuration file, but other than that, no.
2005-12-19T12:38:00.000Z	amm60omy	sethk	ok thank you
2005-12-19T12:39:00.000Z	amm60omy	sethk	could i install someother boot loader??
2005-12-19T12:39:00.000Z	sethk	amm60omy	yes
