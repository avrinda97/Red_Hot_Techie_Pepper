2010-03-20T10:46:00.000Z	Sath		I am getting prompted when I try to add/remove programs or update programs
2010-03-20T10:46:00.000Z	Sath		Appreciate it.
2010-03-20T10:47:00.000Z	Sath		It's a dell inspiron 910
2010-03-20T10:47:00.000Z	Sath		when I went to the user topic there was no password entered in any field, but to change it, it asked for a password -.-
2010-03-20T10:47:00.000Z	Sath		Yes
2010-03-20T10:48:00.000Z	Sath		I've only used windows before but I saw some cool math/science apps and was really looking forward to trying them out
2010-03-20T10:49:00.000Z	Sath		Well, I have 2 main windows PCs and my wife has a windows PC as well, but I'd heard linux was a better choice for a lot of things
2010-03-20T10:49:00.000Z	Sath		I tried the blank password already :(
2010-03-20T10:49:00.000Z	Sath		along with every password I've ever had in my entire life
2010-03-20T10:49:00.000Z	Sath		and all variations of them
