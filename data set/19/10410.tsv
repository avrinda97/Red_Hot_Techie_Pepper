2006-08-09T05:35:00.000Z	twobitspr1te		why can't I turn off num lock?
2006-08-09T05:35:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	because the key is broken?
2006-08-09T05:37:00.000Z	twobitspr1te	mwe	never mind... it's this stupid keyboard... it's one of those with things like "F-Key lock" and crap... I had to monkey around with some of the "special" keys...
2006-08-09T05:37:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	twobitspr1te: 
2006-08-09T05:37:00.000Z	twobitspr1te	mwe	whoa, how did you produce that character?
2006-08-09T05:38:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	twobitspr1te: 
2006-08-09T05:38:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	it's katakana TSU
2006-08-09T05:38:00.000Z	twobitspr1te	mwe	eh?
2006-08-09T05:39:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	a language. gucharmap can show them
2006-08-09T05:39:00.000Z	twobitspr1te	mwe	interesting...
2006-08-09T05:39:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	then I just bind it to alt+the 1/2 key
2006-08-09T05:40:00.000Z	twobitspr1te	mwe	I see
2006-08-09T05:41:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	xset -e 'keycode 49 = onehalf section threequarters paragraph kana_TSU paragraph' then alt+1/2
2006-08-09T05:41:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	at least for a danish keyboard. I think it will work for US layout too
2006-08-09T05:43:00.000Z	twobitspr1te	mwe	well... I don't have a 1/2 key, but I'm sure I can find something to bind it to
2006-08-09T05:43:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	yeah
2006-08-09T05:43:00.000Z	mwe	twobitspr1te	xev will show they keycodes
