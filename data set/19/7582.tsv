2008-10-14T01:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 what 'stuff'  ? forums and google is our friends.
2008-10-14T01:47:00.000Z	meoblast001	dr_willis	google cant fix my problems.. i asked A MILLION TIMES
2008-10-14T01:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 and if no one knows.. then no one knows..
2008-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 best thing to do wouldbe to write up a little web site/post/forum post with the details of the problem.. then every so often ask your question and refer people to the forum thread.  That way they can see all the details and see what others have suggested.
2008-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 im not even clear on what your actual problem is any more.
2009-03-17T01:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 just delete the parittion.. and remake it.. is one way
2009-03-17T01:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 or format it.. if you want the contents  gond
2009-03-17T01:31:00.000Z	meoblast001	dr_willis	is it typical that a FAT16 have a few kilos of stuff already on it when you create it?
2009-03-17T01:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 i would not be suprised at that.
2009-03-17T01:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 the way the fat table and stuff and other things take up space.. they never add up to how much you think they should be
2009-03-17T01:32:00.000Z	meoblast001	dr_willis	is it possible to make an ext3 flash drive that m system can boot?
2009-03-17T01:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 yes. you can have bootable ext2/3 usb thumbdrives with grub.
2009-03-17T01:32:00.000Z	meoblast001	dr_willis	the ext3 uses more space by default... a whole 30 megs
2009-03-17T01:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 thats because 5% is reserved for root and 'lost+found' - thats changeaable with tune2fs command
2009-03-17T01:33:00.000Z	meoblast001	dr_willis	oh
2009-03-17T01:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 its not taking up any space. :) its reserved.
2009-03-28T12:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	meoblast001	 whats the video card?
2009-03-28T12:50:00.000Z	meoblast001	dr_willis	nvidious
