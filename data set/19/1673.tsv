2011-03-11T10:13:00.000Z	epicenter		It looks like /boot/grub/grub.cfg is what I want to work with

2011-03-11T10:13:00.000Z	epicenter	nit-wit	I see where memtest86's image loads and I figure I want to imitate the format of that except specify my win7 iso
2011-03-11T10:14:00.000Z	nit-wit	epicenter	not sure I understand you
2011-03-11T10:14:00.000Z	epicenter	nit-wit	I am trying to reconfigure grub to add a boot option to load an iso image off my hard disk. in this case, a windows 7 install disc

2011-03-11T10:17:00.000Z	epicenter	nit-wit	Correct; the BIOS cannot boot a USB device. It has some weird fault.

2011-03-11T10:17:00.000Z	epicenter	nit-wit	Once, I used Grub to boot a W7 ISO. I just do not remember how
