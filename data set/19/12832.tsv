2006-01-10T14:24:00.000Z	morphix		hrm.
2006-01-10T14:25:00.000Z	morphix		how the heck do i install mplayer or gmplayer.. according to apt there IS NO installation package for it :/
2006-01-10T14:26:00.000Z	morphix		i have multiverse opened.
2006-01-10T14:26:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	search for mplayer. apt-cache search mplayer
2006-01-10T14:27:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	install the one for your arch.
2006-01-10T14:27:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	mplayer is not a package, that is right, mplayer-386|k7 and so on are packages
2006-01-10T14:28:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	do you find mplayer-386 as a package? did you update?
2006-01-10T14:30:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-01-10T14:32:00.000Z	morphix	dabaR__	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6637 -- actually i dont have multiverse in there... :/
2006-01-10T14:32:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	add.
2006-01-10T14:33:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	why use those mirrors?
2006-01-10T14:35:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	sweet. added multiverse?
2006-01-10T14:35:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	do you need help?
2006-01-10T14:36:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	you need to put a # on the first line. on the next line with text, add "universe multiverse", save and close the file, then sudo apt-get update. the first line is the CD, so comment that out is best I think.
2006-01-10T14:36:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	comment out being that # I told you to put.
2006-01-10T14:36:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	and when you are adding those two, no ""
2006-01-10T14:40:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	try a different window border, or a different window manager, I use openbox, which is slick.
2006-01-10T14:42:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	as anything else. it is in universe. there are good threads on it on the forum if you search "openbox stormy"
2006-01-10T14:43:00.000Z	dabaR__	morphix	see the forums first, cause they show screenshots. or http://icculus.org/openbox
