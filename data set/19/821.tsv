2012-09-01T22:58:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	who's crontab are you putting that in?
2012-09-01T22:59:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	the one that comes standard with the install did not changed nothing
2012-09-01T22:59:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	can your normal user run that command wihtout permission problems?
2012-09-01T23:00:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	lets try again
2012-09-01T23:00:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	yes it can
2012-09-01T23:01:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	can you pastebin your crontab   just crontab -l to see it's contents
2012-09-01T23:01:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	well get rid of 's
2012-09-01T23:02:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	rid of what?
2012-09-01T23:02:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	the ' <----
2012-09-01T23:02:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	okay then what is the problem?
2012-09-01T23:03:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	no idea... gonna try something a bit more complicated
2012-09-01T23:04:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	use crontab -e to edit your file also you are logged in as root so you are making changes to root's crontab
2012-09-01T23:04:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	exactly and that is what i want to do
2012-09-01T23:05:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	then the proper way would be sudo crontab -e
2012-09-01T23:05:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	I can try with that aswell but is the same thing basically
2012-09-01T23:06:00.000Z	histo	Neptu	sudo bash is not proper. If you want to get to a root prompt sudo -i
2012-09-01T23:06:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	is not executing nothing more than an echo
2012-09-01T23:07:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	seems to be some diferent let w8 to the next minute
2012-09-01T23:11:00.000Z	Neptu	histo	seems to work sometimes...
