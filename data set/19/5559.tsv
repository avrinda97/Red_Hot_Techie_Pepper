2010-05-20T00:05:00.000Z	alexs		does anyone know how i can install ubuntu to a new hard drive from within window or ubuntu?
2010-05-20T00:06:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	what do you mean?
2010-05-20T00:07:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	I have a windows/ubuntu box, i have a new HD. I would like to install ubuntu on that new HD.
2010-05-20T00:08:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	Just put the install CD, and in the step where it asks about partitions, there should be an option, I think
2010-05-20T00:08:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	I dont have any CDs
2010-05-20T00:09:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	Ohh, you installed Ubuntu through Wubi?
2010-05-20T00:09:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	yes
2010-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	well, I think you should burn that image
2010-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	I cant!
2010-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	why? :O
2010-05-20T00:12:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	ohh :P Well, there is a way to move your wubi virtual partition to a real one… let me search it for you
2010-05-20T00:15:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	I think wubi is for installing ubuntu inside windows as a virtual file, so it's normal that it doesn't have an option for a full install outside windows
2010-05-20T00:16:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	and yes, LVPM should probably do the job of moving your Wubi install to the other disk
2010-05-20T00:17:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	Here's a tutorial: http://blip.tv/file/331947/
2010-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	seems like my cunning plan of using vmwareplayer wil work :)
2010-05-20T00:20:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	but that won't be a full install! :P         well, good luck with that ;)
2010-05-20T00:20:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	wont be full? how?
2010-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	NinoScript	alexs	err… I meant… it won't be running natively, I thought that's what you wanted, full speed :)
2010-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	alexs	NinoScript	I will then take the HD and stick it in my other computer
