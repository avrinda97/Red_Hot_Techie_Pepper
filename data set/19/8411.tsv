2007-03-31T10:03:00.000Z	mimid		this is my first time here
2007-03-31T10:03:00.000Z	mimid		wanted to ask a question about fonts in ubuntu
2007-03-31T10:04:00.000Z	mimid		i downloaded the msttf package and i have tahoma on right now
2007-03-31T10:04:00.000Z	mimid		but it doesnt look as crisp as in windows xp howcan i make it crispier
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	predaeus	mimid	are you using an LCD screen? if so check if subpixel smoothing is enabled under System/Preferences/Font
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	mimid		yes it is and yes its a laptop
2007-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	mimid		96dpi
2007-03-31T10:07:00.000Z	predaeus	mimid	probably also check the Details... settings in that config screen
2007-03-31T10:08:00.000Z	predaeus	mimid	and set Hinting to Full.
2007-03-31T10:08:00.000Z	mimid		smoothing is subpixel and hinting is full subpixel order is RGB
2007-03-31T10:10:00.000Z	mimid		i am using beryl does it matter?
2007-03-31T10:10:00.000Z	predaeus	mimid	hm then I do not know what else you could set to improve font appearance. You should not need to change the "order" option but you could try. Maybe it is also a matter of drivers.
2007-03-31T10:11:00.000Z	mimid	predaeus	thank you for trying i am gonna try to play around with it
2007-03-31T10:12:00.000Z	predaeus	mimid	could be beryl also. there is an ubuntu eye candy channel here you could ask there.
2007-03-31T10:12:00.000Z	predaeus	mimid	its #ubuntu-effects
2007-03-31T10:12:00.000Z	mimid	predaeus	: how do i get there
