2012-06-19T15:55:00.000Z	Guest76054		hi, i get a kernel panic when booting ubuntu. I have about 10 other old kernels, and i get a kernel too when i try to boot with those.. any ideas on how i can fix this?
2012-06-19T15:56:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	May be a hardware problem.
2012-06-19T15:56:00.000Z	Guest76054	usr13	i can boot with a very old installed kernel
2012-06-19T15:57:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	What got upgraded?
2012-06-19T15:58:00.000Z	Guest76054	usr13	i just upgraded with the package manager .. i didnt see which packages.. the recommended ones
2012-06-19T15:58:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Look at the dates.
2012-06-19T15:58:00.000Z	Guest76054	usr13	 the dates of what?
2012-06-19T16:01:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Packages:  ls -ltr /var/lib/dpkg/info/
2012-06-19T16:04:00.000Z	Guest76054	usr13	what should i look for in that list? are those the dates of package upgrades?
2012-06-19T16:04:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Package upgrades are same as installed packages.  (You are looking for date/time of upgrade.)
2012-06-19T16:05:00.000Z	Guest76054	usr13	do you have any idea how i can see or log the output of the bootup of my system? i would like to see what the kernel panic is but i can only see the end of the stack and cannot scroll
2012-06-19T16:05:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	From that output you should be able to see which packages were upgraded at the particular time you pulled the triger on the update.
2012-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Do you see the date?
2012-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	Guest76054	usr13	 the problem is.. it started failing 10 upgrades ago.. i upgrade regularly to see if the new upgrade fixes the problem.. it usually doesnt, and i kept booting with an old kernel.
2012-06-19T16:08:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Oh, I see.
2012-06-19T16:10:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	You might try looking for the latest kernel in that list, (ls -ltr shows latest last), and re-install that kenrnel.
2012-06-19T16:11:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Or uninstall and re-install, (maybe even using purge).
2012-06-19T16:11:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	Or just any of the latest ones that have recently been installed.
2012-06-19T16:12:00.000Z	usr13	Guest76054	It sounds like it is a kernel module that is being loaded into the running kernel.  If you watch closely as it boots a broken one, you may be able to see it.
