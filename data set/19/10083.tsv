2007-05-14T11:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	 Are you running gnome and have you installed any kde apps that use the kde sound system?
2007-05-14T11:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	 I use Kalarm and this happens to me.  Sometimes the sound control/mixer for KDE loads and mutes the gnome mixer.  Sometimes not. Do you have two "speaker" icons by the clock?
2007-05-14T11:55:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	no i dont have 2 speaker icons near the clock ... and the tutorial a other guy gave to me uses commands, which i dont have installed !?
2007-05-14T11:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	by other commands.. do you mean alsamixer?
2007-05-14T11:56:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	no .. that are commands like:  --purge
2007-05-14T11:57:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	and -snd
2007-05-14T11:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	 If you check your "System Monitor" (appelate I've got loaded on top bar) do you have any services loaded like kded or kdeinit or klauncher?
2007-05-14T11:58:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	no .. i just have skype, gaim and now amarokh
2007-05-14T12:00:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	cant i use amarok ??.. or do i have to uninstall it temporarly
2007-05-14T12:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	 You can uninstall without removing everything just as a test to see how the volume reacts...I'm not sure if this will actually do anything but if a KDE app is causing the issue this might let you know.
2007-05-14T12:02:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	i hate things like that .... im now going to remove all KDE software from Synaptic ...
2007-05-14T12:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	 another question.... was this card working before?
2007-05-14T12:03:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	i worked very well with ubuntu 6.06
2007-05-14T12:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	or just sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and try kde in a session to see what happens.
2007-05-14T12:04:00.000Z	Garnol	Scunizi	oh .. nearly 500MB  .. this could take a while ...
2007-05-14T12:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	Garnol	500mg
