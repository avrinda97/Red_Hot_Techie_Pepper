2006-07-11T13:46:00.000Z	philipsmith		I want to know if it is worth it to upgrade to Dapper from Badger on my P-IV machine. I put Dapper on my AMD-64 machine and found that some of the applications I need and want are not available for Dapper on ADM-64. For example, Real Player. Will I loose functionality in migrating from Badger to Dapper on my P-IV?
