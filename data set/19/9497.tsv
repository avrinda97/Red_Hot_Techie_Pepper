2008-09-01T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	What are the permissions on /var/www/test?
2008-09-01T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	er, /var/www/test/?
2008-09-01T12:15:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	i use sudo cp ...; but i have changed it to drwxr-xr-x
2008-09-01T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	can you verify that it's 755?
2008-09-01T12:16:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	sorry. i see. it is drwxr--r-- ... change in a sec ..
2008-09-01T12:20:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	now works. sorry. me problem :)
2008-09-01T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	no problem. Sometimes it takes nothing more than a second set of eyes
2008-09-01T12:21:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	i saw it was r-x but actually it was r-- :)
2008-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	sudo cp mydb to ~mysql/mydb : now the owner|group=root|root ; how can i change to: mysql - MySQL Server|mysql ?
2008-09-01T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	er... what?  chown changes owners.  But, for the record, you (almost) never need to sudo to copy something to your homedirectory.
2008-09-01T12:37:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	i'd like to chown /a/*.* =>newuser, howto ?
2008-09-01T12:38:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	currently are root
2008-09-01T12:38:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	it's hard to chown one by one of all the 200 files
2008-09-01T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	Er.... Why are you chowning all those files?
2008-09-01T12:39:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	they should be user: mysql; because sudo cp, so they are curretnly root
2008-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Happy	Can you easily copy them again?
2008-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	Happy	Flannel	ah.easy: i just did: sudo chown mysql *
