2011-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	fatih		so my real aim is learning of C
2011-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	fatih		But i dont know where i will start
2011-08-14T14:22:00.000Z	fatih		everyone says a language

2011-08-14T14:23:00.000Z	fatih		Ä° wondered that if i start with C
2011-08-14T14:24:00.000Z	fatih		how can i setup it this Ubuntu ?
2011-08-14T14:25:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	you can start with sudo apt-get install build-essential
2011-08-14T14:26:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	the compiler for c is called gcc and is included in that package. you can also use the c++ compiler (g++) to compile c code
2011-08-14T14:27:00.000Z	fatih	milamber	how can i use gcc
2011-08-14T14:29:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	i would recommend starting with c++, there are more current tutorials available - see cplusplus.com
2011-08-14T14:37:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	you have already been told to start with: sudo apt-get install build-essential
2011-08-14T14:44:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	then you have gcc available to you. that is the compiler, now you have to find a c and/or c++ tutorial on the web
2011-08-14T14:44:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	programming support in #programming
2011-08-14T14:45:00.000Z	fatih	milamber	i wrote gcc and it gave me "gcc: no input files"
2011-08-14T14:46:00.000Z	milamber	fatih	the syntax is: gcc <yourfile.c> -o <yourexecutablename>, but as i said, find a tutorial on the internets - there are many available
