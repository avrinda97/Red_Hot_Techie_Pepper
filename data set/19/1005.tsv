2011-06-16T22:54:00.000Z	metadan		ok, so i'm back in win7 i have the disk manager open but I cant make an extended partition?
2011-06-16T22:55:00.000Z	metadan		I have 2 'unallocated' sections on the disk, a 130.52gb bit and an 64.45gb bit
2011-06-16T22:56:00.000Z	metadan		anyone any idea how i make an extended partition to install into?
2011-06-16T22:57:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	can you create an extended partitioni? Meaning do you have free space and dont have 4 primary partitions already?
2011-06-16T22:58:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	I have free space and 3 partitions
2011-06-16T22:59:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	use gparted to free up the free space, the free space MUST be in the last partition, once you free up space  you can then use that free space as an extended partition
2011-06-16T23:00:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	so if i stick all the unallocated space into a partition i should be able to the use that?
2011-06-16T23:02:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	youre getting confused, you cant "stick" all the unallocated space into a partition, the unallocated space needs to be at the end of the 3 primary partitions and contiguous -- you can use that free space to create an extended partition
2011-06-16T23:02:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	yeah thats what i thought... i may be buggered then because i have a drive in the middle of the unallocated space that i need to keep
2011-06-16T23:04:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	if i extend drive that exists to include all the free space and then shrink it again i don't suppose that'll work will it?
2011-06-16T23:05:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	if youre drive and your data, feel free to try whateer you want
2011-06-16T23:05:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	ITS **your** drive...
2011-06-16T23:05:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	indeed
2011-06-16T23:06:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	anytime I use gparted I always backup my stuff first, i've never had a drive fail on me but you never know, hard drives are physical devices and dont last forever
2011-06-16T23:08:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	dr_willis now going to do the shrink and hope it moves everything to the beginning of the changed partition
2011-06-16T23:09:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	if you created an extended partition you can now create as many partitions you want on that extended parttion
2011-06-16T23:09:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	what effect will that have on the data on that partition?
2011-06-16T23:11:00.000Z	tucemiux	metadan	youre confusing yourself -- youre not supposed to have any data on that partition, it should look like this-->[partitionONE][PartitionTWO][partitionTHREE][Extended partition->|a||b|]
2011-06-16T23:12:00.000Z	metadan	tucemiux	ok, yeah i misunderstood you. thanks
