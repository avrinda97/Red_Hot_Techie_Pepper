2009-05-07T12:27:00.000Z	mib_f1t8oaba		Ok.. Im back, getting the exact same errors with the new username as i did with mark...
2009-05-07T12:27:00.000Z	mib_f1t8oaba		and it forgot the display configuration for mark when i logged back in
2009-05-07T12:28:00.000Z	mib_f1t8oaba		Sudo wont let me modify anything
2009-05-07T12:28:00.000Z	mib_f1t8oaba		mark is an admin but sudo doesnt recognize the username
2009-05-07T12:29:00.000Z	mib_f1t8oaba		So no way to just kill sudo all together?
2009-05-07T12:30:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	why would you want to do that? if you don't like sudo so much, you could do sudo su and then become root
2009-05-07T12:33:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	great so you will not be root
2009-05-07T12:33:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	which puppy?
2009-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	once you do sudo su, you become root, then you no longer need sudo as long as you are root
2009-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	you should not be able to use su
2009-05-07T12:35:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	su expects the root's password, which you do not know
2009-05-07T12:35:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	if you want to be root, you have to do sudo su, not su
2009-05-07T12:37:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	hmmm
2009-05-07T12:40:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	it looks like you are not in the sudoers list
2009-05-07T12:40:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	you might have to reboot, go to the recovery boot option, drop as root and add yourself to sudoers
2009-05-07T12:41:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	you won't be able to do it from your account, you will have to drop into the root shell through the recovery
2009-05-07T12:41:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	that is what I think
2009-05-07T12:41:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	as i said you won't be able to edit/save that file
2009-05-07T12:42:00.000Z	sonali	mib_f1t8oaba	you can reboot, go to recovery mode, drop the root shell and then edit the same
