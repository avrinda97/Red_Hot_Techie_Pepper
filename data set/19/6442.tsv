2008-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Oh. It seems that pastebin,com has fallen over. I have a problem mounting some partitions. The details are at http://pastebin.ca/1260081. I have used volume labels to identify the partitions. I have done this on another machine with no problem so I dont understand why its not working here.
2008-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	odev, nosuid  (space)
2008-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	same with the other line
2008-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	troubled	You mean I need a space after nosuid instead of a tab?
2008-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	relatime, nodev, nosuid  -> relatime,nodev,nosuid
2008-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	whitespace is used to determine fields, so spaces are screwin it up
2008-11-18T11:35:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	troubled	Thanks.
2008-11-18T11:35:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	np, all good?
2008-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	troubled	Now when I type sudo mount -a it says mount: special device /dev/disk/by-label/Home does not exist but I am hoping thats because I am doing this on a running system so my home partition is already mounted. Only way to find out is to reboot once I have sorted out grubs menulist
2008-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	look around in /dev/disk/by-label/
2008-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	I dont use that method to mount, so im not sure if it gets refresh immediately after labeling a partition
2008-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	troubled	There is no shorcut in ï»¿/dev/disk/by-label/. I am hoping thats because the partition is already mounted
2008-11-18T11:40:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	my /boot is labeled boot and it is showing up fine for me here, and its mounted
2008-11-18T11:41:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	a quick label on my rootfs isnt showing up immediately either. perhaps a reboot is needed
2008-11-18T11:43:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	I should mention that reboot may not work for you with errors :)
2008-11-18T11:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	troubled	What do you mean "with errors"? What sort of errors? If I have something wrong I will boot on a livecd
2008-11-18T11:44:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	ahh, long as you are prepared. if you depend on your fstab to mount your OS i mean and you have errors
2008-11-18T11:45:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	troubled	Oh I see. No I can sort it out on reboot if necessary from the grub console
2008-11-18T11:45:00.000Z	troubled	JonathanEllis	since its udev controlled, you may be able to reload udev somehow, but I cant seem to get it to trigger here
