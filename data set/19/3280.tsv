2010-03-02T18:08:00.000Z	Stargaze		i'm unable to decrypt gpg-files
2010-03-02T18:09:00.000Z	Stargaze		it says: There is no application installed for PGP/MIME-encrypted message header files
2010-03-02T18:10:00.000Z	Stargaze		solutions i found on google do not help me
2010-03-02T18:10:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	Uh, guess you removed your PGP client. try "gpg -d /path/to/file.gpg"
2010-03-02T18:12:00.000Z	Stargaze	theadmin	that gives me a lot of unreadable ascii on the screen
2010-03-02T18:12:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	Uh, are you sure that's normal PGP file? I mean, it might be damaged or something.
2010-03-02T18:15:00.000Z	Stargaze	theadmin	not better with another encrypted file
2010-03-02T18:15:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	Oh wait wait, i got it
2010-03-02T18:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	It outputs the decrypted contents to stdout, thinking it's a text file... so try "gpg -d /path/to/encrypted/file.gpg > /path/to/decrypted/file"
2010-03-02T18:19:00.000Z	Stargaze	theadmin	you rule :)))
2010-03-02T18:21:00.000Z	Stargaze	theadmin	how can I make nautilus do this?
2010-03-02T18:21:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	I dunno, in 9.04 we had a graphical GPG client called "seahorse"
2010-03-02T18:21:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	Ah, it's still there. Try just telling it to open .gpg files with it
2010-03-06T20:58:00.000Z	Stargaze	theadmin	type /join ubuntu-servers
2010-03-06T20:58:00.000Z	Stargaze	theadmin	type /join #ubuntu-servers
2010-03-15T16:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	Yes, however a lot less
2010-03-15T16:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	If it's hibernated, then no
2010-03-18T15:57:00.000Z	theadmin	Stargaze	Huh, i'm in the other 3%, i guess
