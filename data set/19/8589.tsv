2007-10-03T12:20:00.000Z	_Johny		Does anyone can recommend me a good app for making screenshots under Ubuntu? I'm using XFCE
2007-10-03T12:21:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	there are some command line ones like scrot, xfce probably has its own screenshot util though
2007-10-03T12:22:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	that's not right
2007-10-03T12:22:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	What is the name of the tool you just mentioned?
2007-10-03T12:22:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	it's handled by metacity
2007-10-03T12:22:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	scrot
2007-10-03T12:23:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	I'm using fmv not Metacity
2007-10-03T12:23:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	FMW it's the default window manager in XFCE
2007-10-03T12:23:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	i was just pointing out that gnome doesn't run a daemon for that sort of stuff
2007-10-03T12:24:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	Ah...missunderstood
2007-10-03T12:25:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	I'm installing scrot now...just eager to see what happens
2007-10-03T12:26:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	you run it like scrot -d 5 -c
2007-10-03T12:27:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	Fine, thank you
2007-10-03T12:31:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	Sorry, but it doesn't work look --> johny@johny-laptop:~/Desktop$ scrot -d 5 -c operaTaking shot in 5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1.. 0.
2007-10-03T12:32:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	weird, i just noticed that too... are you running gutsy? it must be a regression
2007-10-03T12:34:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	No, Feisty
2007-10-03T12:35:00.000Z	eck	_Johny	well i'm going to file a bug on it, i'm not sure what other programs there are... maybe you should ask in the xfce channel to see what they are using
2007-10-03T12:36:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	Resolved :) I just added *.jpg* extension to the output file and it worked
2007-10-03T12:37:00.000Z	_Johny	eck	So, the output format must be specified
