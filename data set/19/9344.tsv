2009-12-07T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	this looks interesting.. http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-12737.html
2009-12-07T02:04:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	I that file - http://pastebin.com/m44035f4a - is corrupt and I'm not sure how to remove it, other than how I have done there. Anything you know that I can try?
2009-12-07T02:05:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	did you read the thread from the ubuntu forums I gave you the link for?
2009-12-07T02:08:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	how can I get dpkg?
2009-12-07T02:08:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	dpkg should already be installed
2009-12-07T02:08:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	how can I edit dpkg?*
2009-12-07T02:10:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	I mean, how can I get dpkg to remove information from the file that's preventing me from installing things?
2009-12-07T02:10:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	EDIT dpkg, not get. keep mispelling.
2009-12-07T02:12:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	I'm not really sure.. the error message from apt-get is not very helpful when it comes to finding out which file it's complaining about
2009-12-07T02:15:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	is it possible to access some files from synaptic via on offline source?
2009-12-07T02:16:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	not really sure what you mean by that
2009-12-07T02:16:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	For example, downloading from a PC wit internet, then putting them onto a flash drive or CD, then using an a computer without a connection.
2009-12-07T02:17:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	try the !offline factoid too.. it might be useful
2009-12-07T02:17:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	you can also use the menu option "create download script" in syanptic
2009-12-07T02:19:00.000Z	Ryann	Slart	The installer file/driver files I am specifically looking for are the ones that the b43-fwcutter downloads, do you know how I could get those?
2009-12-07T02:19:00.000Z	Slart	Ryann	nope, no idea
