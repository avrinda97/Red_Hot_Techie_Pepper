2008-12-16T04:34:00.000Z	magikid_		Can anyone help me with my SSH config?  I can't login now.
2008-12-16T04:35:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	pastebin it and i'll take a look at it
2008-12-16T04:35:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	http://paste.ubuntu.com/85832/
2008-12-16T04:36:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	I'm trying to disable the password and only allow logins with public key auth
2008-12-16T04:38:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	didn't, I'll give it a shot now.
2008-12-16T04:39:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	did you have it working with passwords before you started messign with it
2008-12-16T04:39:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	yeah before I started messing, it would accept passwords or pub key
2008-12-16T04:40:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	alright
2008-12-16T04:40:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	so we can say the key pair is fine
2008-12-16T04:41:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	should be, I generated a new key pair just for this
2008-12-16T04:42:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	did you test the keypair before you started editing teh config?
2008-12-16T04:43:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	No.  It honestly didn't occur to me.
2008-12-16T04:44:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	well, did you back up the config file, the keys may be installed incorrectly, check /var/log/auth, or /var/log/soemthing if its set up to go somewhere other htan auth
2008-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	duh, it helps if I turn off my firewall on port 22. palm->face
2008-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	thanks for all your help
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	i take it it all works now?
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	santor	magikid_	i should have suggested that first
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	yeah
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	magikid_	santor	since UFW doesn't have a gui I always forget when I leave it running
