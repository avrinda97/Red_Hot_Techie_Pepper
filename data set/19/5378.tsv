2012-05-07T14:29:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	I assume you already tried reverting to the previous options oon the client?
2012-05-07T14:31:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	I didn't save them and can't remember :/
2012-05-07T14:31:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	doh! *whispers* cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup :)
2012-05-07T14:32:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	not sure if this will help ---   192.168.2.18:/home/wylde/print/Print /home/wylde/PDF nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0
2012-05-07T14:33:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	that works for my nfs mount
2012-05-07T14:34:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	ah, it's not nfs4? The ubuntu documentation says to mount it as type nfs4 with options _netdev,auto (but says not to use _netdev on wifi). Maybe it needs updating
2012-05-07T14:35:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	yeah it is supposed to be nfs4, however using that as FS wouldn't mount
2012-05-07T14:35:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	thanks, I'll try it and bbs
2012-05-07T14:35:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	alrighty :)
2012-05-07T14:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	no dice, I guess maybe I have to check if I really did add my client's hostname to the server's list
2012-05-07T14:39:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	ahh alrighty. :(
2012-05-07T14:40:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	crap, I'm an idiot
2012-05-07T14:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	while we were talking, I guess it got mounted :P
2012-05-07T14:41:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	uht-oh that doesn't sound good lol
2012-05-07T14:41:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	lol :)
2012-05-07T14:42:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	it does seem to load the file lists incredibly slowly, although when I open a video it plays more or less fine
2012-05-07T14:43:00.000Z	wylde	gaelfx	ahh there may be a difference in performance not being nfs4, I don't need an real performance sine that nfs mount of mine is just a dropbox for pdf's that need to be printed :)
2012-05-07T14:44:00.000Z	gaelfx	wylde	gotcha
