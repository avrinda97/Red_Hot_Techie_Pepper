2012-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		hi folks
2012-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		i have a problem with my dualboot install
2012-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		i tried to install lubuntu alongside to my existing win7 installation
2012-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		i tried this before in a virtual box without any problems
2012-03-01T14:36:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		but nowwhen i am booting from a cd the installer only offers me to erase the whole disk
2012-03-01T14:36:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		instead of finding my existing windows
2012-03-01T14:36:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		whats the problem?
2012-03-01T14:36:00.000Z	UnknownCoder		have i done anything wrong?
2012-03-01T14:38:00.000Z	n00gie	UnknownCoder	is there an option for manual partitioning?
2012-03-01T14:38:00.000Z	UnknownCoder	n00gie	yes
2012-03-01T14:39:00.000Z	UnknownCoder	n00gie	but i thought it will be more secure if the installer founds both by itself
2012-03-01T14:41:00.000Z	UnknownCoder	n00gie	i have allready created an empty partition
2012-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	n00gie	UnknownCoder	you need to create a 'swap' partition and a '/' partition, IIRC. make sure you leave the windows partition untouched
2012-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	UnknownCoder	n00gie	the problem is, that the partition manager shows me that the whoole disk is empty
2012-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	n00gie	UnknownCoder	hmmm. something is wrong then.
2012-03-01T14:47:00.000Z	n00gie	UnknownCoder	unmount the filesystem before you start the installer
2012-03-01T14:48:00.000Z	n00gie	UnknownCoder	it lists the entire drive as unpartitioned?
2012-03-01T14:55:00.000Z	UnknownCoder	n00gie	thank you for your help so far, but i have to leave. i'll come back later if i need further help
2012-03-01T14:55:00.000Z	n00gie	UnknownCoder	sure.
