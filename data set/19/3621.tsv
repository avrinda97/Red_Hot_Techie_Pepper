2011-07-04T18:02:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	yes
2011-07-04T18:02:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	how can i do that? :)
2011-07-04T18:03:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	Same way you did it before.
2011-07-04T18:04:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	ehm, i just made the image of my hd, now i want to put that image on another hd... how can it work the same way?
2011-07-04T18:06:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	It will end up as a smaller partition, but you can use gprted to enlarge it.  Or you can use g4u  See: http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/
2011-07-04T18:13:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	sorry i still don't get it, what's the command to put the file.img in the hd?
2011-07-04T18:15:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	dd if=file.img of=/dev/sda  #Where sda is the HD you really want to put it on. That will take a wile tho.  There are ways to speed it up. See:  man dd
2011-07-04T18:16:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	thank you
2011-07-13T17:25:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	What was your solution?
2011-07-13T17:26:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	places -> network :)
2011-07-13T17:26:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	btw is there a way to see shares by command line?
2011-07-13T17:26:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	Ok good.  I was thinking if it were nfs you'd find them in /etc/exports
2011-07-13T17:27:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	cat /etc/exports  ?
2011-07-13T17:27:00.000Z	dyd	usr13	the shares are from another server
2011-07-13T17:28:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	less /etc/fstab
2011-07-13T17:28:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	Just guessing.  Don't know how you have them mounted.
2011-07-13T17:29:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	mount
2011-07-13T17:30:00.000Z	usr13	dyd	Do you see them in the output of mount ?
