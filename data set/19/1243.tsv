2011-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	chuwiey		Hi, i'm running 10.10 and i can't get a nvidia 8600gt detected - can someone help?
2011-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	what do you mean can't get it detected
2011-03-26T14:38:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	ie. isn't recognized.. - i downloaded the drivers from nvidia.com and after running them it says no relevant hardware detected
2011-03-26T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	why did you download drivers from nvidia.com when ubuntu packages  supported drivers
2011-03-26T14:40:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	usually, when i install an nvidia card on ubuntu it will ask me whether i want to install proprietary 3rd party drivers. I didn't get this message, and when searching for additional drivers it didn't find any, so i went and did it myself...
2011-03-26T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	pastebin the output of lspci
2011-03-26T14:42:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/VZY1mGnS thx
2011-03-26T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	no nvidia card in that list, just an intel
2011-03-26T14:44:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	yeah, i know... that's my problem.. it's in the motherboard, the fan is running... and yet, isn't detected?
2011-03-26T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	dead
2011-03-26T14:45:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	ok. :( ... one more question.. i'm trying to install boxee but software center says there is an error with apt... ?
2011-03-26T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	what's the error
2011-03-26T14:47:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	unhandlable error. "there seems to be a programming error with aptdaemon..."
2011-03-26T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	I've never seen that, is boxxee in the ubuntu repos
2011-03-26T14:48:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	nope. however, it had no problems installing in the past... (not necessarily this ver.)
2011-03-26T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	I'm wondering (without looking in detail) if the package version is the issue, or th erepo
2011-03-26T14:50:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	i wouldn't know.. since this isn't from repo i would go with package version.. any way to check?
2011-03-26T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	chuwiey	install something else from an ubuntu repo, if it works you can have reaosnalbe confidence the package manager is fine
2011-03-26T14:51:00.000Z	chuwiey	ikonia	thanks for your help. have a great day.
