2010-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	VP1	the flash plugin is installed that package is optional...
2010-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	VP1	erUSUL	Thanks a lot friend!
2010-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	VP1	erUSUL	I've installed some versions of Ubuntu i.e. from 7.04 upto 10.04 but I don't know the actual size to keep for all such folders as home, root, boot etc. Pl help
2010-06-26T16:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	VP1	i have a 512 boot partition 15 GiB root (/) and the rest for home (/home)
2010-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	VP1	erUSUL	OK. but there should be some criteria i.e. depending on the system's conf etc. Isn't it?
2010-06-26T16:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	VP1	well i have a desktop computer... for a server i would do things differently
2010-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	VP1	also in case of a laptop/dektop one plans to suspend to disk you have make swap == ram
2010-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	VP1	erUSUL	Somebody told me that for good performance one should keep swap=2*RAM
2010-06-26T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	VP1	that's a *really* *old* meme from when computers have 8, 16 or 32 MiB of RAM
2010-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	VP1	erUSUL	So for a 2 GiB Laptop what should be the size of swap?
2010-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	VP1	as i said if you plan to suspend to disk make it 2 GiB
