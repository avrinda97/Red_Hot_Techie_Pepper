2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		guys.. someone please help me with this X window system problem..
2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		I'm completely stuck here
2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		I've just upgraded to breezy and i still can't get X to run
2005-09-23T06:48:00.000Z	kuru		and I get the same error
2005-09-23T06:49:00.000Z	kuru		error:  could not open default font 'fixed';
2005-09-23T06:51:00.000Z	kuru		breezy is badly broken
2005-09-23T06:52:00.000Z	cef	kuru	I'm having no problems apart from this
2005-09-23T06:52:00.000Z	kuru	cef	I've got problems from hell :(
2005-09-23T06:52:00.000Z	kuru	cef	well, I think I've got a problem that no one seems to have :(
2005-09-23T06:53:00.000Z	cef	kuru	what card?
2005-09-23T06:53:00.000Z	kuru	cef	not a card issue.. a font issue
2005-09-23T06:53:00.000Z	kuru	cef	worked fine with hoary
2005-09-23T06:54:00.000Z	kuru	cef	upgraded to breezy and all hell broke lose
2005-09-23T06:54:00.000Z	cef	kuru	have you installed ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop ??
2005-09-23T06:54:00.000Z	kuru	cef	no..
2005-09-23T06:55:00.000Z	cef	kuru	try that.. they depend on all the packages that are necessary.. people have commented that during upgrades you need to install them.. I didn't, and had issues.. but managed to get around it by installing those
2005-09-23T06:58:00.000Z	kuru	cef	i doubt ubuntu-desktop would do anything for my problem
2005-09-23T06:59:00.000Z	cef	kuru	sure? may depend on all the necessary fonts
2005-09-23T07:13:00.000Z	cef	kuru	interesting that I can see a lot of true type fonts that ubuntu-base depends on
