2010-12-14T22:32:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	i think iptables is on by default.
2010-12-14T22:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	it's not
2010-12-14T22:33:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	you mean that the policy is set the accept but it still is on
2010-12-14T22:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	there is NO firewall turned on in Ubuntu (by default) - please trust me on this one.
2010-12-14T22:36:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	trust is a luxury i can not provide :-)
2010-12-14T22:36:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	but you might be right none the less
2010-12-14T22:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	"apt-cache policy iptables" does show it as installed (and I'm assuming that's from default install), but it's certainly NOT enabled in anyway by default.
2010-12-14T22:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	ok you win :-)
2010-12-15T00:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	FYI c+a+backspace was changed to alt+sysrq+k a few releases ago
2010-12-15T00:37:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	good to know. thx
2011-01-15T13:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	with a PPA i guess it is possible in 11.04
2011-01-15T13:10:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	so you have to choose at compile time?
2011-01-15T13:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	i don't understand what you just asked?
2011-01-15T13:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	11.04 will have Unity with Compiz (instead of current mutter) AND there will be a 2d version
2011-01-15T13:12:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	ok. thx.
2011-01-17T03:39:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	if it would be smooth, yes. but it stutters. yuck ;-)
2011-01-17T03:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	runs pretty smoothly here?  (Mind you, i have seen what you mean)
2011-01-17T03:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sam-_-	the video is from VBox so not as good as real life
2011-01-17T03:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	ZykoticK9	ah, ok.
