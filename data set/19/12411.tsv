2005-10-12T14:51:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	was that for me?
2005-10-12T14:51:00.000Z	joe_alf	carthik	nope
2005-10-26T11:08:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	right click on the dvd's icon on the desktop and try eject
2005-10-26T11:09:00.000Z	joe_alf	carthik	there is no dvd icon on my desktop
2005-10-26T11:10:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	hmmm try pmount /media/<Whatever-your-dvd-drive-is-mounted-as> and then just press the hardware eject button
2005-10-26T11:10:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	pumount, even
2005-10-26T11:10:00.000Z	joe_alf	carthik	i'll try that, wait
2005-10-26T11:11:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	note the /media/ not /dev/ :)
2005-10-26T11:14:00.000Z	joe_alf	carthik	when i use pmount it mounted but same error again when try to eject doesn't work
2005-10-26T11:15:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	you had to use pumount to unmount
2005-10-26T11:15:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	try pumount -f or -l to lazily unmount it
2005-10-26T11:16:00.000Z	joe_alf	carthik	still did not work, the dvd is still inside
2005-10-26T11:16:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	alright mate, just use a paperclip for now :)

2006-04-11T13:41:00.000Z	carthik	joe_alf	what does that do, add a new repository to your list, or just plain enable one that is in your list?
2006-04-11T13:43:00.000Z	joe_alf	carthik	in fedora it just enable the repo because you can add repo and make it off by default then if you want to install something which is in that repo you can just enable it at the command
