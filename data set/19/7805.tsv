2007-09-17T12:01:00.000Z	brad016		what is the command to run wine in the terminal?
2007-09-17T12:01:00.000Z	Whack	brad016	wine <exefile>
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	brad016		are you sure?
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	Whack		yes
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	brad016		thanks
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	Whack		also, you can associate exe files with wine
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	Whack		so you can double click to launch them from nautilus
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	brad016	Whack	this did not work/
2007-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	Whack		did you get an error?
2007-09-17T12:03:00.000Z	brad016	Whack	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
2007-09-17T12:03:00.000Z	Whack		hmm, what was the command you gave it?
2007-09-17T12:04:00.000Z	brad016	Whack	wine <exefile>
2007-09-17T12:04:00.000Z	brad016	Whack	just like you gave m
2007-09-17T12:04:00.000Z	Whack		without the < and >, right?
2007-09-17T12:04:00.000Z	Whack		like wine MyApp.exe?
2007-09-17T12:04:00.000Z	brad016		okay
2007-09-17T12:04:00.000Z	brad016	Whack	no
2007-09-17T12:06:00.000Z	Whack	brad016	if you want wine to run a file called MyApp.exe, then you would type wine MyApp.exe
2007-09-17T12:06:00.000Z	brad016	Whack	no, how do i run "wine" the base program?
