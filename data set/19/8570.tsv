2007-03-15T06:34:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	wait a bit, i'm getting thing together, maybe something with hardware/software cursoe
2007-03-15T06:38:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	ok, ececute that command, under the "Section Screen" add this line: Option "HWCursor" "1"
2007-03-15T06:39:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	nothing else i know
2007-03-15T06:40:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	wait, nvidia-settings
2007-03-15T06:40:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	you can do that with the livecd if you know where the installation is mounted
2007-03-15T06:41:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	uhm, you can't edit the cd
2007-03-15T06:43:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	also after you have installed, there's the nvidia's own driver that you can select
2007-03-15T06:43:00.000Z	Rooy	blamethrower	try it to see if that make a difference first
