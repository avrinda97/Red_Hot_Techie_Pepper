2010-08-17T03:23:00.000Z	C_Okie		Does Ubuntu let to explore the innings of a computer more, like other open source linux dist... or does the ease of ubuntu make much of the ability to edit stuff be negated?
2010-08-17T03:24:00.000Z	C_Okie		Even the Wubi version
2010-08-17T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 its all linux underneeth you can dive under the hood and break stuff if you want. :)
2010-08-17T03:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 i find it trivial to do. :)
2010-08-17T03:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 why ask why...
2010-08-17T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 my big systems i see that / rarely gets above 10gb..
2010-08-17T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 Huh? In linux the users stuff are all in their /home/USERNAME   the actual  Name of the dirs dont matter much
2010-08-17T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 its not c:\my docs.. theres a 'users' layout now in windows..    You can easially in linux put /home/ on its own partition, or even on a NFS share..
2010-08-17T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 time to read up on 'mounting filesystems' :) theres lots of neat tricks you can do.
2010-12-17T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 i always scan the windows drives. then defrag them.   do the resize.. then have them scan again
2010-12-17T22:07:00.000Z	C_Okie	Dr_Willis	 you scan the windows partition before you resize or move stuff too?
2010-12-17T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 Most of the time - i let windows resize its own partitions. it can do it faster then gparted i find.
2010-12-17T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 if i do let ubuntu do it. I scan defrag, resize, scan again.
2010-12-17T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 you could have all of linux stuff on extended partitions if youw anted.
2010-12-17T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 typical layout here --> (Primary Windows)(Primary /) (primary /home) (primary swap)
2010-12-17T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 i have noticed that many windows7 setups are allready using 4 primaries  by default. that can be a pain.
2010-12-17T22:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 i would say that most all of them have such features. its only the 'im' progrms that do irc 'on the side' that are often lacking features
2010-12-17T22:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	C_Okie	 i always set up a seperate /home/ often on its own hard drive.
