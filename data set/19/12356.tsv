2006-03-09T12:22:00.000Z	lisi		I've got a wine question - can anyone help out? unfortunately, I do need to use IE to check web pages I design but have run into trouble
2006-03-09T12:23:00.000Z	cwillu	lisi	what's the trouble?
2006-03-09T12:24:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	- I've ben able to install IE and can run other apps as well, but they cannot connect to the Internet even though it's runnign and Linux has no prob with this
2006-03-09T12:27:00.000Z	cwillu	lisi	in ubuntu, try visiting localhost
2006-03-09T12:29:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	it says connecting to localhost but nothing is loading (FF)
2006-03-09T12:33:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	any other ideas?
2006-03-09T12:35:00.000Z	cwillu	lisi	can you open a cmd terminal?
2006-03-09T12:37:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	oh, thought you meant a linux terminal - no, tried wine cmd and got wine: cannot find 'cmd'
2006-03-09T12:42:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	yep, still here
2006-03-09T12:46:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	dont see anything about dll files, but it's trying to load --debugmsg warn+all as the website so I obviously didn't enter this correctly
2006-03-09T12:47:00.000Z	cwillu	lisi	put it before the command your running
2006-03-09T13:11:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	still there?
2006-03-09T13:20:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	this version of wine only has system, that's where I put it - the other version I had tried had both system and system32 and I put it in both just in case, also no go
2006-03-09T13:21:00.000Z	cwillu	lisi	however, I may just not have a working ubuntu when I come back :p
2006-03-09T14:37:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	u here?
2006-03-11T12:02:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	you there? it's me with the wine probs :)
2006-03-11T12:18:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	hi - not too bad, but still can't install IE
2006-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	lisi	cwillu	you mean uninstall and reinstall, or just clear out the dir (ie rename or something)?
2006-03-11T12:32:00.000Z	cwillu	lisi	paste me the output of ifconfig
