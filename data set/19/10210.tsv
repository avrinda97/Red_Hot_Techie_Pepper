2006-07-20T08:13:00.000Z	Dimensions		guys how can i install ubuntu on brand new hdd which has never been used ?
2006-07-20T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	just like normal
2006-07-20T08:14:00.000Z	Dimensions	Flannel	 new hdd can't be booted like normal because on normal it stores live cd data ... while new one has no partition on it etc
2006-07-20T08:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	I dont understand what the problem is.
2006-07-20T08:16:00.000Z	Dimensions	Flannel	 i have a new hdd which nvr been used bfore ... connected on usb ... i want to make an image on it from hdd using dd command but first have to mount it as its new it can't be mounted without partitions etc
2006-07-20T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	er, So, you're not trying to install ubuntu on it, you're trying to mirror another drive?
2006-07-20T08:20:00.000Z	Dimensions	Flannel	i tried to install ubuntu on it ... didn't work it gave an error ... synci some thing and i have to do installation on more than one hdd one is new other are old ... i was told if i could mirror it from hdd (two of hdd has errors therefore ) it will be bootable copy and should work ..
2006-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	instead of dealing with mirroring, you're probably better off just installing straight to it.  The CD should have no preference as to whether you have a HD even.
2006-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	er, you only need ubuntu once per computer
2006-07-20T08:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	you'll be better off using the CD on each.  Get the alternate CD, you boot straight into the installer, instead of having to go through the liveCD.
2006-07-20T08:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	you'll want to let hardware detection do it's thing.
2006-07-20T08:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	get the alternate CD, then take that to each machine, and install.  You want to allow hardware detection to detect the machines.  Its a lot easier.
2006-07-20T08:27:00.000Z	Dimensions	Flannel	 alternate CD ?
2006-07-20T08:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	a different iso, instead of the "desktop" one, alternate.  It boots straight to the installer, and gives you a lot more flexibility.  If youre installing on a bunch of machines, it's the way to go (no waiting for liveCD to boot, etc)
2006-07-20T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	yep, same place you downloaded the desktop iso.
2006-12-10T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	first link there
2006-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	Did you read that page?  it covers multiple installation methods
2006-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Dimensions	sounds good ;)
