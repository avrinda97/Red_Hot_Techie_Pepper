2005-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	Coily		i have 2 free space partitions, a 20gb once which is part of an extended partition and a 50gb partition when has never been formatted. how do i 'merge' this free space?
2005-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	Coily		err once=one
2005-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	in Windows, you could use Partition Magic..
2005-04-25T08:08:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	I didn't have too good experience with qtparted.. I recommend partition magic..
2005-04-25T08:08:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	once i get it installed, what will i do next
2005-04-25T08:09:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	the program is realy easy to use.. no need to read manuals..
2005-04-25T08:10:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	thats the problem. theyre not
2005-04-25T08:13:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	what command should i use to list the partition table (fdisk -l just shows the formatted partitions)
2005-04-25T08:14:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	but yuo asked me to tell you what they are
2005-04-25T08:16:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	there is Windows PE Iso floating around with good system software like partition magic.. no need to install Windows
2005-04-25T08:20:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	that probably won't be possible...since partition has to be in contigous sector.
2005-04-25T08:23:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	same time.. just move important stuff to CD/DVD or another drive..
2005-04-25T08:26:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	but thats not what i want to do, i need to backup an xp partition with the freespace
2005-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	if you just want to backup, I recommend Norton Ghost.. I am pretty sure there is linux equivalent, so help.
2005-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	no its not to backup, its to use for booting
2005-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	Gurum	Coily	also I think you'll run into problem if you really mess your parttion with Win XP...
2005-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	well maybe someone can get it working
2005-04-25T08:32:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	partimage
2005-04-25T08:33:00.000Z	Coily	Gurum	no. it can copy an ubuntu partition
