2010-10-24T19:44:00.000Z	elgh		How do I access a folder in Ubuntu from my VirtualBox OS Win XP?
2010-10-24T19:46:00.000Z	elgh		I remember I did it once, and it was really simple. I just wish I remember how to. ^
2010-10-24T19:48:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	rigved : In Guest choose the VM-menu 'devices'>'Shared Folders' and choose then map you made in ubuntu
2010-10-24T19:50:00.000Z	elgh	CyberGabber	I did that. But I guess I have to make something in VirtualBox to open that filder.
2010-10-24T19:52:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	rigved Now in guest(XP), open 'networkneighbourghhood', that's : My Networklocations> FullNetwork> VirtualboxShardFolders, than open the \\ map you made in ubuntu
2010-10-24T19:55:00.000Z	elgh	CyberGabber	Doesn't help I'm sorry. ^
2010-10-24T19:56:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	Did you install the 'VirtualBox Guest Additions' in your guest?  (See the VM-menu of your guest-machine)
2010-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	elgh		Yes, I did.
2010-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	Your 'host' is ubuntu ?
2010-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	elgh		I use Ubuntu. And Windows XP in VB.
2010-10-24T19:58:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	OK, Step1, make a map in e.g. your homedir, called 'virtmap'.
2010-10-24T19:58:00.000Z	elgh		Did that.
2010-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	In XP-guest, choose the VM-menu 'devices' > 'shared folders'
2010-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	elgh		Done.
2010-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	elgh		I also added the folder I would like to share in Ubuntu there.
2010-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	CyberGabber	elgh	Can you 'ping' you host from within guest-XP ? I think it's an network-setting in Vbox
2010-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	elgh		Nope, can't. ^
2010-10-24T20:04:00.000Z	elgh	CyberGabber	works to ping now..
2010-10-24T20:12:00.000Z	elgh	CyberGabber	Did you fall asleep?
