2011-05-10T19:36:00.000Z	schure		dear all, i am here wondering how to deactivate the ATI/AMD propietary FGLRX graphics driver. My main problem is that I don't even get command line access when I boot. I am booting from usb...
2011-05-10T19:37:00.000Z	Harith	schure	I have same problem of yours, what's you card model?
2011-05-10T19:38:00.000Z	schure	Harith	I am not sure.
2011-05-10T19:38:00.000Z	schure	Harith	It is whatever comes with the hp tm2t
2011-05-10T19:39:00.000Z	Harith	schure	I have ATI Radeon HD 5470 Intel HD Graphics embedded in core i3
2011-05-10T19:39:00.000Z	schure	Harith	I think it is a radeon hd 5450
2011-05-10T19:39:00.000Z	schure	Harith	oh, no, mine is not a core i3; it's the older version that came iwth a core 2 duo
2011-05-10T19:40:00.000Z	Harith	schure	ahaa, and I'm here to find a solution, but no one actually responds 0_0
2011-05-10T19:40:00.000Z	schure	Harith	one solution is to reinstall everything...
2011-05-10T19:40:00.000Z	schure	Harith	which i would leave for next week
2011-05-10T19:41:00.000Z	Harith	schure	i already tried that several times
2011-05-10T19:42:00.000Z	schure	Harith	what do you mean? you booted from usb and installed everything, asking the installer to format your drive, and you still had the driver installed afterwards?
2011-05-10T19:44:00.000Z	Harith	schure	I intalled the system, now when it comes to intall the ATI, which I install it manually by downloading the binary file, then after restarting my computer, system doesn't boot, and yes, I install it from USB which has nothing to do with our issue
2011-05-10T19:45:00.000Z	schure	Harith	believe me, you will enjoy your computer more if it works.
2011-05-10T19:46:00.000Z	Harith	schure	what is it?
2011-05-10T19:47:00.000Z	Harith	schure	where is it? where can I get it from? what's the installation process?
2011-05-10T19:48:00.000Z	Harith	schure	I'm listening...
2011-05-10T19:48:00.000Z	schure	Harith	i think i will try doing some stuff, but i must boot...
2011-05-10T19:49:00.000Z	Harith	schure	ok
