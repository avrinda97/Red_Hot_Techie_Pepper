2008-06-12T17:00:00.000Z	camason		hi guys. I removed wine and deleted ~/.wine... how can I remove the menu items under *applications* ?
2008-06-12T17:01:00.000Z	lejon	camason	thru the menu editor in system>preferences>menu editor
2008-06-12T17:02:00.000Z	camason	lejon	it worked this time. I tried to remove it before and they just stayed there
2008-06-12T17:03:00.000Z	lejon	camason	good, just dont do the mistake I did and delete the wine entry in the menu and just disable it, atm I dont have that menu entry for wine anymore even tho I reinstalled wine :P
2008-06-12T17:03:00.000Z	camason	lejon	uh oh, i just deleted it
2008-06-12T17:04:00.000Z	lejon	camason	if you find a way to get it back, tell me :P
2008-06-12T17:04:00.000Z	camason	lejon	ahh, **** :/
2008-06-12T17:06:00.000Z	lejon	camason	Try to go to their homepage and see if you find anything in their faqs or forums, I haven't put a effort in to really looking on how to get it back but it should be somewhere there

2008-06-12T17:07:00.000Z	camason	lejon	although I'm back to square 1 now... I have some old programs from a previous WINE install that I want to remove from the menu... right click -> delete doesn't work
2008-06-12T17:08:00.000Z	lejon	camason	If they are installed with wine you have to remove them with the wine uninstaller (typ "wine uninstaller" in terminal)
2008-06-12T17:09:00.000Z	camason	lejon	they're not any more... i removed wine, then rm -rf my .wine folder
2008-06-12T17:09:00.000Z	lejon	camason	then they shouldn't be there anymore either :P
2008-06-12T17:10:00.000Z	camason	lejon	they're being stubborn :)
2008-06-12T17:10:00.000Z	camason	lejon	I fixed it... remove all *.desktop files from ~/.local/share/applications
2008-06-12T17:11:00.000Z	lejon	camason	sweet ^^
2008-06-12T17:11:00.000Z	camason	lejon	thanks for your help
2008-06-12T17:13:00.000Z	lejon	camason	No problem, glad I could help :P
