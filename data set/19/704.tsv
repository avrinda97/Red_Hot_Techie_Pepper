2011-10-10T00:43:00.000Z	Leothlon		Hi guys, my flat mate got a problem installing ubuntu :/
2011-10-10T00:44:00.000Z	Leothlon		with 11.04 he gets stuck at load screen, using the nomodeset "fix" he gets into a terminal, now he tried the same thing with ubuntu 10.04 and he gets error copying files to hdd... anyone know what the problem might be+
2011-10-10T00:46:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	need more hardware info
2011-10-10T00:47:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	hybrid graphics?
2011-10-10T00:48:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	and which version does he want to run?
2011-10-10T00:49:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	then please answer my question
2011-10-10T00:49:00.000Z	Leothlon	arghx	he is not really sure
2011-10-10T00:49:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	then he should make sure
2011-10-10T00:52:00.000Z	Leothlon	arghx	the GT 130M supports Hybrid-SLI (only HybridPower). HybridPower is a technique to choose between the integrated and dedicated graphics core,
2011-10-10T00:53:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	I didn't ask about hybrid sli or hybrid power but hybird graphics in general. in this case: is there an intel videocard in the system as well? and which one is set to be uesd via BIOS?
2011-10-10T00:56:00.000Z	Leothlon	arghx	 cant find any info on it in bios:/
2011-10-10T00:57:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	run via nomodeset and start X and check the Xorg log
2011-10-10T00:57:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	and check via lspci what hardware you actually have
2011-10-10T01:03:00.000Z	Leothlon	arghx	 dont seem to be any intel card in there, just the nvidia 130m card
2011-10-10T01:03:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	what cpu?
2011-10-10T01:07:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	boot with nomodeset and then start X and there install the restricted drivers for your nvidia chip
2011-10-10T01:14:00.000Z	Leothlon	arghx	 startx gives output: /usr/bin/x: error while loading shared libraries: /usr/bin/libpciaccess.so.0: cannot read file data: input/output error
2011-10-10T01:14:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	do a _long_ SMART test for your harddisk. it could be a defect harddisk
2011-10-10T01:16:00.000Z	arghx	Leothlon	until you have tested every single sector of your harddisk you above statement is simply uninformed and useless. have a nice day
