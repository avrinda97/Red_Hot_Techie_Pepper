2007-10-31T07:53:00.000Z	genii	secleinteer	Use cups/cupsd, a brief tutorial is here http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-480039.html

2007-10-31T07:54:00.000Z	genii	secleinteer	Yer welcome
2007-10-31T08:02:00.000Z	secleinteer	genii	i followed the steps and restarted cups, and i can't pick up the printer on this machine
2007-10-31T08:04:00.000Z	genii	secleinteer	Sorry for lag, running a gutsy update, a bit bogged
2007-10-31T08:05:00.000Z	secleinteer	genii	no prob; do you know the issue though?
2007-10-31T08:05:00.000Z	secleinteer	genii	it says at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu that you just have to edit the "Listen" line

2007-10-31T08:07:00.000Z	genii	secleinteer	Are you able to ping the print server by ip from one of the client machines?
2007-10-31T08:07:00.000Z	secleinteer	genii	never mind, i got it; i also had to make a modification from the gui
2007-10-31T08:07:00.000Z	genii	secleinteer	Ah, good
