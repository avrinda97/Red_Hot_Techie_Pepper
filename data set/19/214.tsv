2012-06-19T21:50:00.000Z	nyuck		I
2012-06-19T21:50:00.000Z	nyuck		m having a massive issue on multiple machines all basedi n Ubuntu.
2012-06-19T21:52:00.000Z	nyuck		When using a laptop for everyday tasks occasionally the computer will completely lock up, mouse will not move, can't change to a different tty, only option is a  hard reboot. This affects MY laptop, this affects my WIFE laptop, which is a completely different manufacturer, this affects my FRIENDS laptop which makes me look bad because I installed Linuix on there. I am running Pinguy 12.04, my wife is running Ubuntu 12.04, and my friend is using Linux Mint 12
2012-06-19T21:52:00.000Z	nyuck		.04. All are identical issues despite completely different hardware setups.
2012-06-19T21:53:00.000Z	nyuck		We're also using different DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS, I'm using XFCE, my wife is using Unity, and my friend is using Cinimon
2012-06-19T21:53:00.000Z	nyuck		oh shut up, did you not even read the goddamn statement?
2012-06-19T21:55:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	are all PC on the same network and does it happen when you take your laptop somewhere else?
2012-06-19T21:57:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	okay so no physical impact that would reach all the PCs. Have you checked the kernel logs after the failures to find a cause ?
2012-06-19T22:00:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	of course as much info possible helps. Did all PCs were fine before you installed Linux on them?
2012-06-19T22:01:00.000Z	nyuck	schnuffle	I can't say for my machine, I did not boot into any other OS with it, I just plopped the CD in as soon as I had it. Their machines had OTHER issues when they ran Windows, nothing similar to this, all very common virus/spyware issues.
2012-06-19T22:03:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	So its more of 3 different PCs all of them not running as the should. So you should not search for a common cause but for the specific problems of each of them. Sounds like to had a meeting with Murphy :)
2012-06-19T22:04:00.000Z	nyuck	schnuffle	The common applications would be Google Chrome, Skype (different versions, however) Network MAnager, and uh... any other very common programs that come with these OS.
2012-06-19T22:05:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	To go further we would need some info about the logs and dmesg the next time it crashes.
2012-06-19T22:06:00.000Z	nyuck	schnuffle	I found one log on my friends computer relating to a kernel crash....
2012-06-19T22:10:00.000Z	nyuck	schnuffle	I just thought of something we all have in common, we're all running similar partition schemes.
2012-06-19T22:11:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	any special setup?
2012-06-19T22:28:00.000Z	nyuck	schnuffle	A 10-15 gb root partition, a swap partition twice the size of the ram, and the rest dedicated to /home . All are ext3
2012-06-19T22:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	nyuck	enough space on all partitions?
