2008-10-31T08:48:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin		can anyone help me? in intrepid I can connect to and ping other computers on the network but I can't use the internet
2008-10-31T08:49:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	default route
2008-10-31T08:49:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	how are you getting your ip address?
2008-10-31T08:50:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	netstat -rn
2008-10-31T08:50:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	 check /etc/resolv.conf has an appropriate name server
2008-10-31T08:51:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	hmm this is weird, my net has started working again, this happened before too, it just randomly starts working and then stops
2008-10-31T08:52:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	you have a dodgey router or network switch...
2008-10-31T08:52:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	everything worked fine until i upgraded to intrepid, and the internet works fine on other computers on the network
2008-10-31T08:53:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	are you using network manager to do your networking?
2008-10-31T08:53:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	yes
2008-10-31T08:53:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	configure your network manually for dhcp
2008-10-31T08:54:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	see if that helps
2008-10-31T08:54:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	what do you mean? do you mean using a static ip address?
2008-10-31T08:55:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	no, use dhcp... hmm... that's right intrepid doesn't let you configure manually...
2008-10-31T08:56:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	So any ideas on what to do?
2008-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	have you got wireless as well?
2008-10-31T08:58:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	nope, right now I'm using another computer as a proxy to access the internet
2008-10-31T09:00:00.000Z	Faithful	shad0w0fsin	check your syslog/messages to see if your nic is going up and down
2008-10-31T09:02:00.000Z	shad0w0fsin	Faithful	What should I be looking for, I see some messages about DHCP but thats it
