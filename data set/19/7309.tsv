2008-04-27T23:23:00.000Z	heartsblood		Is the nonfree macromedia flash plugin available through synamptic or do I have to get it from adobe?
2008-04-27T23:24:00.000Z	heartsblood		I tried searching for it but the only one I can find is the opensource one
2008-04-27T23:24:00.000Z	heartsblood		ah ok
2008-04-27T23:25:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	it's  flash-nonfree or something like that
2008-06-01T06:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	you need to change the perms for the folder.
2008-06-01T06:04:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	read "man chmod"
2008-06-01T06:04:00.000Z	heartsblood	Ashfire908	I know how to use the command
2008-06-01T06:05:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	are the other users in the group that the folder is set to?
2008-06-01T06:06:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	no.
2008-06-01T06:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	perms always take immediate effect.
2008-06-01T06:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	are the folders that contain the folder set to the right group/perms?
2008-06-01T06:12:00.000Z	heartsblood	Ashfire908	you were wrong sir.  I had to log each user out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
2008-06-01T06:13:00.000Z	heartsblood	Ashfire908	it works fine now
2008-06-01T06:13:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	what?
2008-06-01T06:13:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	how are you accessing the folder?
2008-06-01T06:15:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	you shouldn't need to logout to do it.
2008-06-01T06:15:00.000Z	heartsblood	Ashfire908	I'm just telling it that is what fixed it.  In fact i'm sitting on the last user account (has not been logged out yet) and he can not enter the folder
2008-06-01T06:16:00.000Z	heartsblood	Ashfire908	after a quick relog he can now cd to the directory just fine.
2008-06-01T06:16:00.000Z	Ashfire908	heartsblood	whatever.
