2006-05-24T05:27:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	Oh
2006-05-24T05:29:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	kbrooks: Terminus: i suppose i lost him with that question?
2006-05-24T05:30:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	Yes.
2006-05-24T05:42:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	i /msg'ed it to forget to prevent spamming.
2006-05-24T05:42:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	Aha.
2006-05-24T05:42:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	I had to check ;)
2006-05-24T05:43:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	and setting up a YAMP
2006-05-24T05:44:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	You've got to be joking./
2006-05-24T05:44:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	i am not.
2006-05-24T05:45:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	ok, fine

2006-05-24T05:46:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	;)
2006-05-24T05:47:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	it does help for some things. for example, I once messed up abiword by uninstalling it then quitting then reinstalling it. I had to reboot to fix it.
2006-05-24T05:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	Couldn't just switch to runlevel 1 and then back again?
2006-05-24T05:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	Though maybe that's too complicated for most. Reboot is less painful ;)
2006-05-24T05:48:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	I wrote up a whole bug report and everything for a serious bug, but then rebooting fixed it. I don't know... rebooting is almost as fast. Maybe a file was left open by the kernel.
2006-05-24T05:56:00.000Z	Shadyman	unfo	Wrong person?
2006-05-24T06:35:00.000Z	unfo	Shadyman	non-free! non-free! shoot all the drivers!
