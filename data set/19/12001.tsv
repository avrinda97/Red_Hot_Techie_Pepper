2007-06-03T09:36:00.000Z	ubunt1		HI men
2007-06-03T09:37:00.000Z	ubunt1		enter in #gaim and they will tell you
2007-06-03T09:37:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	The package still exists, in Feisty. Pidgin, Gaim's successor, will be in Pidgin
2007-06-03T09:37:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	Pidgin is a wee bit different from Gaim
2007-06-03T09:37:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	Different UI and whatnot; so it's not just a name change
2007-06-03T09:38:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	You can download Pidgin packages from http://getdeb.net, but not from the repositories
2007-06-03T09:38:00.000Z	ubunt1	MenZa	before 3 days is not there
2007-06-03T09:39:00.000Z	ubunt1	MenZa	amd maybe they are putting it .
2007-06-03T09:39:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	I don't understand you
2007-06-03T09:39:00.000Z	ubunt1	MenZa	i know getdeb before there didn't have pdgin
2007-06-03T09:43:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	No, the steam executable is a .msi
2007-06-03T09:44:00.000Z	MenZa	ubunt1	Installer, that is
2007-06-03T09:44:00.000Z	ubunt1	MenZa	i have the msi on the e-maikl
