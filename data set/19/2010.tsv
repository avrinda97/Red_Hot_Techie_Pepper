2010-09-08T00:54:00.000Z	DarkSector		What is the terminal command for volume control, I think it was alsa something... ?
2010-09-08T00:56:00.000Z	DarkSector		btw jeng,  doesn't that open a GUI, I need a terminal command that will or reduce the volume by one unit
2010-09-08T00:56:00.000Z	headkase314	DarkSector	alsamixer is console based, I think it uses ncurses for a text "gui"
2010-09-08T00:58:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	no, I meant if I wanted to boost volume by one command, what can that be in the terminal, I am trying to make a arduino based IR volume remote control app and I need to know how to boost or decrease volume using a single command to be executed in the shell , Paddy_NI, jeng

2010-09-08T01:01:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	yes I think this might work, let me get back to you in a few minutes
2010-09-08T01:01:00.000Z	headkase314	DarkSector	ok
2010-09-08T01:11:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	hey I tried using amixer and this is the command I am using amixer -c 0 set PCM 1%+ and the problem is even after the value being 255 i.e maximum the sound doesn't escalate to maximum
2010-09-08T01:12:00.000Z	headkase314	DarkSector	sorry then - I'm not an expert, I found that link with a google search.
2010-09-08T01:12:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	oh thank you for your time in that case
2010-09-08T01:12:00.000Z	headkase314	DarkSector	you're welcome.  Keep going - you'll get it.
2010-09-08T01:12:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	hope so
2010-09-08T01:13:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	sorry to bother you again, it just hit me, is it possible to use the commands bound to hotkeys directly ?
2010-09-08T01:13:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	like, the one you can see in the keyboard shortcuts  menu ?
2010-09-08T01:14:00.000Z	headkase314	DarkSector	if you have Compiz enabled I know there are shortcuts available there.
2010-09-08T01:14:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	yeah I have compiz, ok, lemme check this
2010-09-08T01:21:00.000Z	DarkSector	headkase314	I think, that's not a valid option, anyway let me ask in the channel
2010-09-08T01:21:00.000Z	headkase314	DarkSector	ok
