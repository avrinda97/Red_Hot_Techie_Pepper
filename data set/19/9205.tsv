2007-01-10T16:23:00.000Z	z9999		Our printer ceased sending text to the page, the printer works fine on another system so we suspect we have corrupted something. Using Ubuntu 6.06, and have uninstalled and re-installed the drivers, but are still unable to print text. A blank page is ejected after a wait. Any help would be appreciated.
2007-01-10T16:24:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	does the printer have any kind of self-diagnosis ?
2007-01-10T16:25:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	The printer is fine as we tested it on another system.
2007-01-10T16:26:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	how did yo uinstall it, what kind of printer is it, what does the cups error log say, etc etc etc
2007-01-10T16:27:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	We installed, removed, and re-installed using the synaptic package manager. It's an HP-656C inkjet printer.
2007-01-10T16:27:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	installed what > how ?
2007-01-10T16:28:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	by "installed" one menas: USB, parallel, or Ethernet ?
2007-01-10T16:31:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	We installed, using the package manager, hpijs and hplip drivers, and initially the printer worked fine. Recently it ceased to print on the page, but ejects a page after an amount of time equivilent to having printed the text. All we have done is allowed all the updates recommended be applied, none of which we can attribute to the printer.
2007-01-10T16:35:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	and you did not configure cups at all ?
2007-01-10T16:36:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	Where do you configure cups?
2007-01-10T16:36:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	well, it is the printing system used in ubuntu, so the menu's printer setup does some of it
2007-01-10T16:42:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	Very few settings are available there, but what exists appears to be set properly. And the printer worked fine prior to applying the recommended Ubuntu updates, which  there were many, but nothing we noticed associated with the printer.
2007-01-10T16:42:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	did you reboot after the updates ?
2007-01-10T16:45:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	We've been working on this for over a week now and have rebooted numerous times.
2007-01-10T16:46:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	sorry to hear that... to investigate this further you'll likely have to dive into CUPS and hplip/hpiij configuration
2007-01-10T16:46:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	have you visited linuxprinting.org yet ?
2007-01-10T16:47:00.000Z	z9999	adaptr	We'll give them a try.
2007-01-10T16:48:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	I'd be glad to help, but HP printing is rather hmm.. difficult at times, even from Windows
2007-01-10T16:48:00.000Z	adaptr	z9999	I do however, know CUPS and stuff, and the linuxprinting site should be able to help you out some
