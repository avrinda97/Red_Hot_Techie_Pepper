2008-09-09T00:30:00.000Z	TheCount		hello :)
2008-09-09T00:30:00.000Z	TheCount		how can I fix font handling in ubuntu? the system doesn't seem to use the truetype fonts I've installed, or xfs for that matter :(
2008-09-09T00:31:00.000Z	jrib	TheCount	what do you mean?  Are they just not available to your applications?
2008-09-09T00:32:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	hmm, yes
2008-09-09T00:33:00.000Z	jrib	TheCount	how did you install them?
2008-09-09T00:33:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	but apparently my problem is that I expect Lucida Console to be available, which doesn't seem to be the case
2008-09-09T00:33:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	in that particular case, apt-get install sun-java6-fonts
2008-09-09T00:34:00.000Z	jrib	TheCount	did you restart the application?
2008-09-09T00:34:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	even restarted X
2008-09-09T00:36:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	but it seems more like I've been convinced to have fonts in my systems which I don't have
2008-09-09T00:37:00.000Z	jrib	TheCount	where are you checking for the fonts?  I'll try to install them here
2008-09-09T00:37:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	I'm just installing msttcorefonts (*cough*)
2008-09-09T00:37:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	maybe that helps
2008-09-09T00:38:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	I've been searching with xfontsel
2008-09-09T00:38:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	and I'd be wanting to use them in firefox/prism
2008-09-09T00:43:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	found the problem, thanks for being my sounding wall
2008-09-09T00:43:00.000Z	jrib	TheCount	heh, no sweat.  What was the issue?
2008-09-09T00:43:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	-ESTUPIDUSER ;)
2008-09-09T00:44:00.000Z	TheCount	jrib	if I expect X to be working with msttcorefonts I should have them installed ..
