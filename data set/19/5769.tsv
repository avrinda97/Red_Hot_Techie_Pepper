2010-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	BlowAway		"Failed to start the fire wall The device eth2 is not ready" <------ what the freak is that I'm using Internet trough it?!
2010-04-02T04:36:00.000Z	BlowAway		Also I have another ppp0 connection which seems to have the almost the same traffic up/down. What do?
2010-04-02T04:37:00.000Z	BlowAway		I can't get firestarter to work. It returns an error
2010-04-02T04:37:00.000Z	BlowAway		I says device isn't ready but I'm using the internet trough it

2010-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	BlowAway		What is that utility?
2010-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	BlowAway		yes already
2010-04-02T04:39:00.000Z	BlowAway		I followed it 3 times already this week :p
2010-04-02T04:40:00.000Z	BlowAway		how?
2010-04-02T04:41:00.000Z	BlowAway		It's monitoring all my devices
2010-04-02T04:41:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	what are you connecting with over the net? wlan0?
2010-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	I would use ufw.  Firestarter isn't being maintained if I recall correctly
2010-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	install gufw
2010-04-02T04:38:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	nvm didn't recognize the message
2010-04-02T04:39:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	Change the option so it's not monitoring eth2
2010-04-02T04:40:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	check firestarter setting/options to see what it's monitoring (eth0, wlan0, etc)
2010-04-02T04:40:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	sounds like its monitoring eth2
2010-04-02T04:44:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	sorry, where are you now with your firestarter issue?
2010-04-02T04:51:00.000Z	judgepg	BlowAway	find out what active connection you're using, and set firestarter to monitor that connection.  Does that not work?
