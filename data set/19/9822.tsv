2006-09-12T05:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	what name do you want it to have?  label
2006-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	any string you like
2006-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	compu73rg33k	eyequeue	what label did you give your / partition ?
2006-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	root
2006-09-12T06:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	well, similar i guess
2006-09-12T06:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	"anything the user wants" :)
2006-09-12T06:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	i [ersonally like /var separate too, as it likes to overfill
2006-09-12T06:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	someone in this channel just wiped out his / because of mysql filling /var (which was on his single ext3)
2006-09-12T06:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	:)
2006-09-12T06:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	you want my real advice then, with all that?
2006-09-12T06:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	make all the separate partitions the installer offers you, even if /home is a bot cramped ... run it until late october when edgy is released
2006-09-12T06:08:00.000Z	compu73rg33k	eyequeue	what's edgy?
2006-09-12T06:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	then, run "df -h" and see what YOU really use, with your usage patterns, and do a fresh install with those numbers
2006-09-12T06:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	version 6.10, successor to dapper
2006-09-12T06:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	give things a bit of extra room to breathe then of course
2006-09-12T06:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	late october
2006-09-12T06:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	compu73rg33k	you may be a mail spool freak, or may run news servers, others may collect huge pron videos in /home, heh
2006-09-12T06:11:00.000Z	compu73rg33k	eyequeue	I will be using it as a home server, run a blog on it, MAYBE DNS and definitely a asterisk server
