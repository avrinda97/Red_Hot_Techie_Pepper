2008-06-28T11:07:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	dont repeat so often
2008-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	did you try changing the resolution
2008-06-28T11:21:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	you want to resize the ntfs partition?
2008-06-28T11:24:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	you want to erase that ntfs partition (delete) or resize it
2008-06-28T11:25:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	yes
2008-06-28T11:27:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	you have to be very careful with gparted.
2008-06-28T11:27:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	are your files backed up?
2008-06-28T11:28:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	you might consider getting the gparted livecd; not backing up is seriously risky though.
2008-06-28T11:31:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	gparted is for resizing, deleting or creating new partitions
2008-06-28T11:44:00.000Z	bazhang	PseudoBob	mounted partitions cant be edited
