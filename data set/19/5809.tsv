2008-05-29T20:21:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		why does df /boot not give me a partition with /boot? it gives me one with just /
2008-05-29T20:21:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	df -h | grep boot
2008-05-29T20:22:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	did you actually set a separate /boot though? There's none by default.
2008-05-29T20:22:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	I don't know. I'm trying to fix grub since it broke my linux and windows partition.
2008-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	fdisk -l output to paste.ubuntu.com please.... also /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-05-29T20:26:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	http://paste.ubuntu.com/15560/
2008-05-29T20:28:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	strange... but ok... can I see your /boot/grub/menu.lst also please?
2008-05-29T20:31:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	menu.lst http://paste.ubuntu.com/15563/
2008-05-29T20:32:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	see the title Windows 95/98/NT/2000 example? you want to use that... but set it to (hd0,2) ... remove the #'s infront too.
2008-05-29T20:33:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	make sense?
2008-05-29T20:34:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	editing the file from my linux partition will keep the changes? editing it from grub didn't.
2008-05-29T20:34:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	yup.
2008-05-29T20:34:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	ok, thanks. I'll take a look.
2008-07-31T16:57:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	Why are you wanting to use XMMS? Try audacious maybe? (fork of old xmms)
2008-07-31T16:59:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	because I don't know how to find the good apps. I'll try that one.
2008-07-31T17:00:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	fde	Thanks. This thing is more like WinAmp. I can actually play files instead of having to navigate through ID3 tags of every single song I have.
2008-07-31T17:00:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	yw
2008-11-24T17:35:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	XAMPP sounds like its X-based LAMP... there is an apache configuration tool that would make it easier, but just dive in if you know what you're doing
2008-11-24T18:17:00.000Z	fde	Chaotic_Descent	should be localhost:80
