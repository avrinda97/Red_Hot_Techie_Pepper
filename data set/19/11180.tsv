2010-05-23T05:22:00.000Z	compaq		you know, my cpu is idle, before, I had compiz and nvidia card with proprietary drivers, and my cpu was all maxed out, spent hours shopping online for a new computer, and then I removed the nvidia card, and am using onboard intel with just metacity, and my cpu is barely even used up
2010-05-23T05:24:00.000Z	compaq		I don't know if it was compiz or nvidia proprietary driver that was killing my cpu.  Anyway, i am going to turn on compiz in a bit and check again, then I will tell you if the proprietary drivers were too heavy or compiz
2010-05-23T05:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	souldn't be.. I just came in so missed a lot of your issue.. did you "upgrade" or fresh install?
2010-05-23T05:26:00.000Z	compaq		scubacuda, my cpu is idle, before, I had compiz and nvidia card with proprietary drivers, and my cpu was all maxed out, spent hours shopping online for a new computer, and then I removed the nvidia card, and am using onboard intel with just metacity, and my cpu is barely even used up
2010-05-23T05:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	which driver did you use 173 or the "other" that has no version number?
2010-05-23T05:28:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	I can't remember, it is an nvidia 128mb old card, let me see 1 sec
2010-05-23T05:28:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	I am pretty sure it was gforce or something like that
2010-05-23T05:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	naw.. what I was asking is when you enabled the drivers, which one did you pick.. on my system there were 2 to choose from
2010-05-23T05:29:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	there weren
2010-05-23T05:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	none? so was this a fresh install?
2010-05-23T05:29:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	it didn't give me the option, just the one proprietary came up, and asked to enable it and I said yes
2010-05-23T05:30:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	yeah
2010-05-23T05:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	ok.. 2 things.. right after a fresh install I always "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade".. that brings in all the newer packages since the release.. then go to System>Admin>Hardware Drivers and look there for your options.. most likely you'll have 2.  On my laptop it enabled the 173 driver which tends to overheat my computer.. the other didn't. On my desktop machines I typically use the driver
2010-05-23T05:32:00.000Z	Scunizi		 direct from Nvidia.. but that's another issue..
2010-05-23T05:32:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	no, there were none there
2010-05-23T05:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	did you do all the updates though?
2010-05-23T05:32:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	there were none there
2010-05-23T05:33:00.000Z	compaq	Scunizi	yeah, well I did a few install tries and I installed all the updates once, it doesn't make much of difference in my opinion, the release was just a few weeks ago
2010-05-23T05:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	compaq	it can.. there are several versions of 10.04 that will happen.. 10.04.1 10.04.2  10.04.3 .. depends on the devs.. but there's continuous updates that's why the long string for updating.. it catches all that needs to be cought
