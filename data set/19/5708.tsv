2008-06-21T00:32:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	Oh, i thought the point of what you said was that i shouldnt be running it in vm

2008-06-21T00:32:00.000Z	Andeh		bleh. anyone else?
2008-06-21T00:32:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	I said you can run it in the VM if you want, but really you should start getting away from Windows more :)
2008-06-21T00:33:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	MSN.
2008-06-21T00:33:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	:)

2008-06-21T00:33:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	And its lovely handwriting tool.
2008-06-21T00:33:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	 you could try audacity in Wine as well :)
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	Eww
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	also Windows Live Messenger apparnatlly works well in Wine 1.0
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	It's buggy enough on linux!
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	not tryed yet myself
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	Andeh	SebNaitsabes	Ive missed a lot in the 4 months i was offline
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	 the WIne you get from Ubuntu repo is an older one, but no Wine 1.0 is much better
2008-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	the instructions are on the Wine site for getting Wine 1.0 and it is much better now
2008-06-21T00:35:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	it's worth another try
2008-06-21T00:36:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Andeh	 this is how it should be for Windows apps in Linux.  run them in Wine, if no luck even after messing around and really got to have that app fine  an XP VM
