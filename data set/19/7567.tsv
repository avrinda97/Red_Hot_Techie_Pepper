2007-08-03T09:50:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	does everyone need to use it?
2007-08-03T09:50:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	which one?
2007-08-03T09:51:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	Most of the students want to use Ubuntu rather than Windows
2007-08-03T09:51:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	well, why not get one system as a terminal server for windows, and rdp in for that app?
2007-08-03T09:51:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	no that app is  not for Win
2007-08-03T09:52:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	even better. sae idea though
2007-08-03T09:52:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	for that app they have a dual boot with FC3, if that works on Ubuntu then we will have Ubuntu and only Ubuntu
2007-08-03T09:53:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	definately terminal server them.
2007-08-03T09:53:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	but how to do it?
2007-08-03T09:54:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	server install and things. i'd suggest RTFAing since i haven't done it before. its the way to go though. have a server, and connect with an X client....
2007-08-03T09:55:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	do you mean the server should run FC3?
2007-08-03T09:55:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	yeah, or FC3 in VMware
2007-08-03T09:56:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	thats a great idea, but will see NigelS has said he will check out with that software if he gives a solution it will be better or else, terminal server or vm
2007-08-03T09:56:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	if your admin is halfway competant he'd know what i'm talking about ;)
2007-08-03T09:57:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	as far as GNU/Linux is concerned he is not even half way competent
2007-08-03T09:58:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	in that case, FC3 VMware server... less chance of ****ing up ;p. then connect using X i think ;)
2007-08-03T09:59:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	 yeah ok we will try with that also once and see what NigelS suggests
2007-08-03T09:59:00.000Z	Geek_	eRazor	if nothing else, its damn fun to play with ;p
2007-08-03T09:59:00.000Z	eRazor	Geek_	he he
