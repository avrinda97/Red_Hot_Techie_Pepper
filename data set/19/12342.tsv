2005-09-20T09:25:00.000Z	pr0tocol		is it necessary to have OPTION "UseFBDev"   "true" there?
2005-09-20T09:26:00.000Z	durt	pr0tocol	try posting at nvnews
2005-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	durt	pr0tocol	did you comment out load "dri" and load "GLcore"?
2005-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	yup
2005-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	nothing to do with it, though.  Even before all that the NVIDIA logo was appearing.
2005-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	durt	pr0tocol	what model card do you have?
2005-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	it is saying something about the libfb.a
2005-09-20T09:30:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	GeForce 5600 FX

2005-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	durt	pr0tocol	use nvidia-glx
2005-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	tried it. Nothing.  And it's funny because the log reports absolutely NO errors that should be stopping the modules to load
2005-10-10T09:04:00.000Z	durt	pr0tocol	run "modprobe nvidia"
2005-10-10T09:04:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	lol I did all of that
2005-10-10T09:05:00.000Z	durt	pr0tocol	so whats the problem?
2005-10-10T09:05:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	honestly, the error I get Signal 11 crap! thats all
2005-10-10T09:07:00.000Z	pr0tocol	durt	anymore ideas?
