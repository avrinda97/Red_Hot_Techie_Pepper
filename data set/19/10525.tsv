2006-06-06T15:28:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		depends what kind of internet connection you have whether you use snat or masquerade doesn't it?
2006-06-06T15:29:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		So no one has any idea about my NIC not working with the new kernel in dapper?
2006-06-06T15:30:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		nah, the NIC just doesn't send or receive any data
2006-06-06T15:30:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		its on a static ip, and it works fine when i boot with the old kernel
2006-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		<tom^> sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	cartur25	Adrian_NZ	How do I overwrite xorg.conf with xorg.conf_backup?
2006-06-06T15:34:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		<tom^> You shouldn't have to reboot, just press ctrl + alt + backspace (i think) tp restart the xserver
2006-06-06T15:34:00.000Z	cartur25		thanks bderrly
2006-06-06T15:36:00.000Z	cartur25		What is the terminal code to backup my xorg.conf file
2006-06-06T15:38:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ		<cartur25>: cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup
2006-06-06T16:01:00.000Z	cartur25		Is GTF already installed in Dapper?
2006-06-06T16:01:00.000Z	cartur25		"The GTF XFree86 modeline generator is a utility for calculating VESA GTF modes."
2006-06-06T16:01:00.000Z	cartur25		"This utility is already distributed with XFree86 4.3; if you have XFree86 4.3, then you probably already have gtf installed on your system"
2006-06-06T16:01:00.000Z	cartur25		Does that include dapper?
2006-06-06T16:02:00.000Z	cartur25		Oh ok
2006-06-06T16:02:00.000Z	cartur25		Where can I download the binary package for GTF?
2006-06-06T16:06:00.000Z	cartur25		Super noob question: How do I check repositories?
2006-06-06T16:09:00.000Z	cartur25		What would happen if I ran "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2006-06-06T16:12:00.000Z	Adrian_NZ	cartur25	Thanks for pointing out the bug report page, i found a fix for my NIC troubles!
