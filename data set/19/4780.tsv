2008-11-05T06:41:00.000Z	Out_Cold		what's the easiest way to convert 30 000 .ogg files to mp3?
2008-11-05T06:41:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	why not just leave them as ogg?
2008-11-05T06:42:00.000Z	Out_Cold	scunizi	as far as i know most music players don't like ogg files
2008-11-05T06:42:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	ah.. there is a converter in synaptic.. it'll take a while though.
2008-11-05T06:45:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	you might be able to do it from terminal with "lame"
2008-11-05T06:46:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	there's also Nautilus-script-audio-convert
2010-01-25T10:31:00.000Z	Out_Cold	scunizi	wine is Not an emulator :p
2010-01-25T10:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	yep.. or a "substitute" :)
2010-01-25T10:58:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	I've never found that with nvidia.. lately the newer cards might have issues because the driver available in ubuntu is pretty far behind the power curve
2010-01-25T10:59:00.000Z	Out_Cold	scunizi	i've seen a fair bit of issues especially with overscanning and new drivers failing to support old cards..
2010-01-25T11:00:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	new drivers and old cards don't mix well.. that's why there are 3 primary drivers for nvidia cards.. New .. Old.. and Older
2010-01-25T11:00:00.000Z	Out_Cold	scunizi	agreed but try telling that to the auto-updater
2010-01-25T11:01:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	yep.. I never use the auto updater.. in fact I use the drivers from nvidia's site.. I just plan on reinstalling them on a kernel upgrade
2010-01-25T11:02:00.000Z	Out_Cold	scunizi	but that's where i see the issues with users.... that and overscan is one hellova ***
2010-01-26T09:37:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	I've started but it isn't returning anything
2010-01-26T09:38:00.000Z	Out_Cold	scunizi	did it resolve?
2010-01-26T09:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	oops.. it did..
2010-01-26T09:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Out_Cold	I'll see if I can pastebin
