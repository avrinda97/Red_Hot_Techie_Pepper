2011-10-06T21:05:00.000Z	PsychoX75		Steve Jobs actually DID pick linux
2011-10-06T21:05:00.000Z	PsychoX75		only thing is that he threw another GUI over it.

2011-10-06T21:06:00.000Z	PsychoX75		ocean: did u actually see my question that i asked like 3 times already?
2011-10-06T21:08:00.000Z	PsychoX75		ehh... guys?  Dont be mad at me, ok?   I'm pretty new at Ubuntu. If i can't ask that here, where should i ask that? I just wanna know something that can actualy play movies in Ubuntu which i can tweak a little.
2011-10-06T21:09:00.000Z	PsychoX75		that's all i needed. Simply a 'name' of the players... I'm gone configuring and installing. Thanks.

2011-10-06T21:11:00.000Z	PsychoX75	cheako	i've seen VLC a couple of times in windows. Gonna try it.
2011-10-06T21:12:00.000Z	PsychoX75		wow
2011-10-06T21:12:00.000Z	cheako	PsychoX75	Yeah, vlc did'nt work vary well on my machine.  It had problems doing full-screen.  On my box the window boarders would always show and funky things happened if the window was resized or moved.
2011-10-06T21:12:00.000Z	PsychoX75		Kitty: i meant that for cheako
2011-10-06T21:12:00.000Z	PsychoX75		:)
2011-10-06T21:14:00.000Z	cheako	PsychoX75	Plus it has only a freaction of the featurs you'll find in mplayer...  though it's a got a GUI to configure it.
2011-10-06T21:15:00.000Z	PsychoX75	cheako	the problem i have is that my GPU is a cheap videocard. But my CPU is a quadcore. So when playing blu-ray it can't handle it. I'm trying to 'tell' the mediaplayer to just let the CPU do the job.
