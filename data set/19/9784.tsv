2006-09-17T13:25:00.000Z	Yngve1981		kitche:Don't know, but I can't online wireless!
2006-09-17T13:25:00.000Z	Yngve1981	kitche	get that is
2006-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	ok so does your wireless use any type of encryption
2006-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	Yngve1981		Kitche: Well, when I was using xp I only typed in the wepkey and was online!I'm really new to ubuntu
2006-09-17T13:27:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	ah ok you probably don't have your wep key in ubuntu go to System>Networking
2006-09-17T13:28:00.000Z	Yngve1981	kitche	yupp, I'm there
2006-09-17T13:28:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	does that see your wireless card by chance?
2006-09-17T13:29:00.000Z	Yngve1981		Kitche: It just says wireless connetction eth1 is not active
2006-09-17T13:29:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	ok so it sees it click on that card then go to properties
2006-09-17T13:30:00.000Z	Yngve1981		Kitche: I've done that and typed in the wepkey but still it's dead
2006-09-17T13:30:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	well click on the card then activate it :)
2006-09-17T13:30:00.000Z	Yngve1981		Nickspoon: Dunno what that is
2006-09-17T13:30:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	it's not active so it can't be used to use your network
2006-09-17T13:30:00.000Z	Yngve1981		Kitche: Hmm..done so several times but nuttin happens
2006-09-17T13:31:00.000Z	kitche	Yngve1981	well ubuntu for me is slow to actually do stuff though the net for some reason takes me 5 minutes just to load a page
