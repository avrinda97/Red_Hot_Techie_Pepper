2008-08-11T00:25:00.000Z	Neku	rafa__	im in system prefrences but it aint thr would i need to restart pc?
2008-08-11T00:25:00.000Z	rafa__	Neku	it should be in system > preference
2008-08-11T00:25:00.000Z	rafa__	Neku	no restart should be required. linux doesnt need to restart everytime you install something like in windows, only kernel changes and driver installations require restarts
