2010-06-30T00:16:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	you may want to disable the splash screen to see whats actualy going on
2010-06-30T00:42:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	still trying to do that
2010-06-30T00:42:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	I think the grub is already partly installed during a previous install that went wrong.
2010-06-30T00:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	that thing is totaly unrelated to your problem
2010-06-30T00:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	or do you have ubuntu installed allready?
2010-06-30T00:46:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	it is related, because it exaclty the error I get
2010-06-30T00:46:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	I think my situation is as follows: HD with windows XP, Pendrive with ubuntu and a broken GRUB
2010-06-30T00:48:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	& Black_Prince: my internal cd-drive is broken, that's why I use a pendrive
2010-06-30T00:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	whats is that hdd? sata ide scsi?
2010-06-30T00:55:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	ATA
2010-06-30T00:55:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	what is diskutility?
2010-06-30T00:56:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	The build in Disk Utility of Ubuntu
2010-06-30T00:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	it probably has some of its partitions mounted
2010-06-30T00:59:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	but I can;t see to unmount it
2010-06-30T01:01:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	if you open a terminal does the mount command show any mounted filesystems on that disk?
2010-06-30T01:07:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	any filebrowsers open?
2010-06-30T01:08:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	also are you sure its the disk and not the stick?
2010-06-30T01:08:00.000Z	bluntu	mgolisch	yeah, my disk is 40gb and the usb only 4gb. I want to unmount the harddisk
2010-06-30T01:16:00.000Z	mgolisch	bluntu	did you try the lsof on the mountpoint? alternatively you can just write a new partitiontable with fdisk and reboot from the stick
