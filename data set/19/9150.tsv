2006-12-23T08:19:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	he'd get ntldr missing, if that's the case
2006-12-23T08:20:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	thats always how i've dual booted
2006-12-23T08:20:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	how do you do it?
2006-12-23T08:21:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	i have a 100 MB service/boot/grub partition ... somewhat to complex to explain in 2 lines
2006-12-23T08:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	thats what i mean too -- C:\ as 100Mb -- E:\ as say 20GB -- linux boot next and / after that -- XP installs to E:\ but writes boot.ini to C:\ and NTLDR to boot sector -- ubuntu installs normall on /boot and / but overwrites the bootsector -- if it is then configured properly to boot windows off of C: and linux off of /boot it ought to work
2006-12-23T09:08:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	you dont need a firewall if you use a router??
2006-12-23T09:09:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	if your router is is only worth 2 cents it's got it's own firewall in it. Thta'S were it belongs
2006-12-23T09:10:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	that almost like saying -- you dont need anti-virus protection on your PC as long as your mail-server takes care of it
2006-12-27T13:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	xubuntu-desktop is a meta package, so thats quite likely to purge very little
2006-12-27T13:48:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	that's by intention :-)
2006-12-27T13:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	all the xfce/xubuntu packages are still going to be around anyway
2006-12-28T08:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	port forward works with auto-assigned IPs too -- but there's no guarantee the port-forward will remain so forever because the IP address of the machine may change
2006-12-28T08:40:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	that's the long version, which i was to lazy to type :-)
2006-12-28T08:41:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	better to have said - port-forwarding on non-fixed IP's is not a good idea ..
2007-01-12T15:54:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	cool way of avaoding awk :-)
2007-01-12T15:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	what's awk? :p
2007-01-12T16:04:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	i hope you arent implying perl can't do UTF8? :)
2007-01-12T16:19:00.000Z	un_operateur	stefg	I have a feeling those are flags passed to one of the post-install scripts of xserver-xorg
2007-01-12T16:19:00.000Z	stefg	un_operateur	me 2 ... so i like to know the real tricks :-)
