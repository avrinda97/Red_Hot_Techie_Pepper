2012-07-20T00:17:00.000Z	burckley		Hi
2012-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	burckley		I need help mounting a ntfs partition device
2012-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	burckley		the ntfs config tool doesn't have the option:
2012-07-20T00:18:00.000Z	burckley		enable write support for itnerna; device
2012-07-20T00:19:00.000Z	burckley		how to install ntfs-3g
2012-07-20T00:19:00.000Z	burckley		?
2012-07-20T00:19:00.000Z	escott	burckley	sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
2012-07-20T00:21:00.000Z	escott	burckley	have you tried "udisks --mount /dev/sdX#" where X# is the correct device and partition number
2012-07-20T00:22:00.000Z	burckley	escott	Mount failed: Error mounting: mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2012-07-20T00:23:00.000Z	escott	burckley	you might want to boot into windows and run chkdsk
2012-07-20T00:23:00.000Z	burckley	escott	i can't it's password protected
2012-07-20T00:24:00.000Z	escott	burckley	then you shouldn't be using ntfs. you should only use NTFS when you have a valid copy of windows to fix any issues that come up
2012-07-20T00:28:00.000Z	escott	burckley	what do you mean password protected? like an encrypted partition or just a normal windows boot that you cannot login to because you dont have the system passwords
2012-07-20T00:29:00.000Z	escott	burckley	yes, just sudo mkdir /mnt/mountpoint first
2012-07-20T00:33:00.000Z	escott	burckley	you have to run some kind of ntfs checking/fixing utility. chkdsk in windows is recommended you can try the ntfsfix utility in linux
2012-07-20T00:33:00.000Z	burckley	escott	dcullen ntfsck ^
2012-07-20T00:34:00.000Z	escott	burckley	i'm recommending you figure out a way to boot windows (safe mode maybe, perhaps they have a variant of recovery mode?) maybe dcullen has some magic way of dealing with this
2012-07-20T00:39:00.000Z	escott	burckley	i would think you can just hit shift on boot and select something from the windows boot menu to get it to chkdsk
