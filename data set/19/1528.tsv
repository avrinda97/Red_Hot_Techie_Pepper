2011-08-25T16:11:00.000Z	xander		Hi everyone, I can't update my system because download of one update archive gets stalled midway.
2011-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	xander		The offending file is http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nvidia-graphics-drivers/nvidia-current_280.13-0ubuntu1~maverick~xup1_amd64.deb
2011-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	what is the error msg you are getting
2011-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	what is the error msg you are getting
2011-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	are you able to download the other packages?
2011-08-25T16:14:00.000Z	xander	abhishekpathak	Already doing that.
2011-08-25T16:14:00.000Z	xander	abhishekpathak	Update manager, apt-get, all of 'em
2011-08-25T16:14:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	so just update all the other packages and leave this offending package alone
2011-08-25T16:15:00.000Z	xander	abhishekpathak	Even a wget on that file in a terminal atalls midway through the download.
2011-08-25T16:16:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	register a bug report complaining about this to the ppa maintainer
2011-08-25T16:17:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	you can always get other versions of nvidia and noveau drivers for the time being
2011-08-25T16:17:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	maybe the server handling the ppa is refusing persistent connections
2011-08-25T16:17:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	or maybe the problem is from your network
2011-08-25T16:23:00.000Z	abhishekpathak	xander	 lol.wierd situation you are in.
2011-08-25T16:24:00.000Z	xander	abhishekpathak	Thank BSNL for that. :-D
