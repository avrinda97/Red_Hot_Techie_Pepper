2008-07-06T00:27:00.000Z	enigmata		Need help setting up network with Samba. I can't login
2008-07-06T00:27:00.000Z	enigmata		Fryguy: tried it. Still can't login.
2008-07-06T00:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	then you don't have your share set up correctly.  make sure you are logging into the correct workgroup or domain
2008-07-06T00:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	and turn off ntlm v2 in vista
2008-07-06T00:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	use group policy editor to do it
2008-07-06T00:31:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	did you install the kernel headers package
2008-07-06T00:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	yes
2008-07-06T00:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	first google result for me: http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/linux-kernel-headers
2008-07-06T00:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	/usr/bin/passwd is an executable, your password is stored in /etc/shadow
2008-07-06T00:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	use the passwd command to change it
2008-07-06T00:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	and?
2008-07-06T00:45:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	if you are su, just type "passwd <username>" to set a new passwd for that user
2008-07-06T00:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	then your workgroups are probably messed up
2008-07-06T00:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	change workgroups so they match
2008-07-06T00:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	both on same subnet?
2008-07-06T00:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	firewall?
2008-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	so.. same subnet or no?
2008-07-06T01:02:00.000Z	Fryguy--	enigmata	then figure  out what firewall you have on vista that is preventing you from pinging, as that is probably the cause of your other networking problem
