2005-05-21T13:39:00.000Z	Nalioth	nderjm	the question is, how badly do YOU want to keep playing xbox360 games?

2005-05-21T13:40:00.000Z	Nalioth	nderjm	if you have read the latest, if you never connect to xb0x-live, then you can do waht you like with it

2005-05-21T13:43:00.000Z	nderjm	Nalioth	I installed it on a B&W G3/400.  It runs sweeeet doesnt it :D
2005-05-21T13:49:00.000Z	Nalioth	nderjm	yes it does. i like the freedom (which OSX doesnt give you)
2005-05-21T13:50:00.000Z	nderjm	Nalioth	I've always been a Mac user.  Its just works.  So it remains my main desktop os.  it give me enough freedom to keep me happy.
