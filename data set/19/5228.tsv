2008-10-11T07:33:00.000Z	venkat_partha		hello, looking for some help.
2008-10-11T07:34:00.000Z	venkat_partha		wanted to know how to enable applications like Pigdin & Firestarter to start up when logged on
2008-10-11T07:36:00.000Z	venkat_partha		Hello, how do i start up the Firestarter & Pidgin @ startup ?

2008-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	venkat_partha		jenal: tried that, every time gives the message "insufficient privilages"
2008-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	venkat_partha		@ nataneal: no such options in the system > admin menu
2008-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	there is ...
2008-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	system -> preferences -> sessions
2008-10-11T07:39:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	and if your trying to  run firestarter, and it's not providing a gksudo prompt then your obviously not the admin of that machine
2008-10-11T07:40:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	if you are the admin, then try running it via the run-dialogue(alt+f2 : then type : gksudo firestarter )
2008-10-11T07:45:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	this isnt a recommended way of using firestarter. i take it you want this so people can see when incoming traffic is being blocked?
2008-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	it is, firestarter is just a gui. it controls the firewall called iptables
2008-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	have you put pidgin in the session list?
2008-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	yep, everysingle firewall gui you see for ubuntu is almost always going to be a frontend.
2008-10-11T07:49:00.000Z	venkat_partha	airtonix	no did not have pidgin program in the list. am adding that now. Thanks for clearing up that. I thought firestarter was a firewall itself.
2008-10-11T07:49:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	nope, it may appear to be because of certain wording in the app itself, but its just a interface...iptables is horrid to learn directly
2008-10-11T07:51:00.000Z	airtonix	venkat_partha	ufw is a good terminal based iptables frontend, i recommend it if your going to need to control a ubuntu server that has no screen or desktop enviroment
2008-10-11T07:55:00.000Z	venkat_partha	airtonix	Thanks & have a great day. Bye
