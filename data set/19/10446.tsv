2007-05-05T11:40:00.000Z	needhelp		Hi, I've just set up Apache. Now Im trying to get perl to work too.  If I try to run the .cgi file from localhost, the .cgi file shows up as a textfile instead of being executed. I've added AddHandler cgi-script .cgi, but still it wont work. Help?
2007-05-05T11:40:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	you restarted apache?
2007-05-05T11:40:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	sure
2007-05-05T11:45:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	cleared the cache in your browser?
2007-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	also, you have it in the right place?  (you might need to do ExecCGI on the directory)
2007-05-05T12:20:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	did you catch my last question?
2007-05-05T12:22:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	was it if i did restart Apache? yes i did restart
2007-05-05T12:23:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	no, did you set "Options +ExecCGI" on the directory where you have the cgi script?
2007-05-05T12:26:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	basically, http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/cgi.html
2007-05-05T12:27:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	yes I have +ExecCGI in apache2.conf. I just cleared the cache in firefox. Now I get a different errormessage: forbidden - no permission. Ive manually chmod'ed all files to 777, but still same result
2007-05-05T12:28:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	you check permissions on the parent directories?
2007-05-05T12:30:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	I have set chmod -R 755 to all dirs and files under the root beginning at /var/www/
2007-05-05T12:31:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	I don't know then.  You can post your apache2.conf if you want, but someone in #apache may recognize your problem faster
2007-05-05T12:31:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	ok, thanks so far
2009-04-30T19:24:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	hold down the 4, does your mouse move?
2009-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	yes it moves
2009-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	jrib	needhelp	press ctrl-shift-numlock
2009-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	needhelp	jrib	Thank you!
