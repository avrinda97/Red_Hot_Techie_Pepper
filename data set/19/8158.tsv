2007-04-28T15:34:00.000Z	witchery		    Pelo       i guess that i will just play all my vidoe's using Windows XP Pro, there are no restrictions there
2007-04-28T15:36:00.000Z	eck	witchery	all (video) dvds are encrypted
2007-04-28T15:37:00.000Z	eck	witchery	it is illegal to decrypt them without purchasing a license; that is the reason you cannot play them out of the box in license
2007-04-28T15:38:00.000Z	eck	witchery	see the pm from ubotu
2007-04-28T15:40:00.000Z	eck	witchery	what are you using to play the dvds?
2007-04-28T15:41:00.000Z	witchery	eck	nothing right now because im trying to figure what to put in the command line in the removable media tab
2007-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	eck	witchery	i believe the default setting (totem %m) will work fine, you can also use mplayer or vlc (or somethingelse) if you prefer one of those applicatoins
2007-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	witchery	eck	thank you i will see if that works
2007-04-28T15:50:00.000Z	witchery	eck	it opens the player but all there is is just a blank screen
2007-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	eck	witchery	do you have mplayer installed?
2007-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	witchery	eck	yes
2007-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	eck	witchery	if you do, if you try to play the dvd from the command line in mplayer it will print out a bunch of text to the terminal that would indicated any problems
2007-04-28T15:52:00.000Z	witchery	eck	it is just a blank screen meaning it just hangs
2007-04-28T15:53:00.000Z	eck	witchery	i think you just run mplayer dvd:// or something like that (i don't actually have a dvd player so i'm not positive)
2007-04-28T15:53:00.000Z	eck	witchery	do it from the console so you can see the text that it prints out
2007-04-28T15:53:00.000Z	witchery	eck	please tell me how
2007-04-28T15:53:00.000Z	eck	witchery	as i said before, mplayer dvd://
2007-04-28T15:56:00.000Z	witchery	eck	do you know if fedora core 4 or 5 will play DVD's
2007-04-28T15:57:00.000Z	eck	witchery	it should be basically the same with them (install libdvdcss or whatever it is called, and then it just works)
