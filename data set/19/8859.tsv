2008-02-26T20:06:00.000Z	nikitis		anyone know where i can download sun-java6-plugin?  My friend shows other java6 stuff, but the plugin doesn't show up for some reason
2008-02-26T20:07:00.000Z	nikitis		ah yes
2008-02-26T20:08:00.000Z	nikitis		I need java for my browser
2008-02-26T20:10:00.000Z	nikitis		that's not a fix
2008-02-26T20:10:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	Then there is no solution currently.
2008-02-26T20:10:00.000Z	nikitis	sarah	doh
2008-02-26T20:10:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	You could poke SUN. :-)
2008-02-26T20:12:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	To add on what jrib said, you will not gain any performance increase unless you're running major graphic processing most likely.
2008-02-26T20:12:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	Highly unlikely.
2008-02-26T20:13:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	We're talking video processing here like batch movie editing :)
2008-02-26T20:13:00.000Z	nikitis	sarah	oh ok
2008-02-26T20:15:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	Well, there's nothing wrong with running it in a 32 bit chroot or with 32 bit firefox I believe
2008-02-26T20:15:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	But if yo absolutely won't suffer firefox 32bit I don't see a great solution unfortunately. =/
2008-02-26T20:16:00.000Z	nikitis	sarah	even if it's not recognizable, it matters imo
2008-02-26T20:16:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	You said nano, not I. :-)
2008-02-26T20:20:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	There a free java RE's out there, but none have quite the features of the Sun JRE I believe.
2008-02-26T20:21:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	It's a question of who owns the code really. Since the official Sun JRE is not public domain we really couldn't do anything even if we had the code.
2008-02-26T20:21:00.000Z	nikitis	sarah	the java6-jre is available for 64bit, just not the browser plugin
2008-02-26T20:21:00.000Z	sarah	nikitis	Oh I see. :)
