2012-11-27T19:29:00.000Z	bhenry		where would i find the output of this cron job? … /bin/pwd 2>&1
2012-11-27T19:29:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	the mail of the user that it ran as.
2012-11-27T19:30:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 how do i check that?
2012-11-27T19:30:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	type mail
2012-11-27T19:30:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 command not found.
2012-11-27T19:31:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	less /var/spool/mail/yourusername
2012-11-27T19:33:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 there must be something i need to turn on? there is nothing in /var/spool/mail
2012-11-27T19:34:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	are you sure your cron job ran? is this root's crontab? (also, whats the point of running pwd in a cronjob?)
2012-11-27T19:35:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 i'm debugging. cron seems to be running but my script won't run. i know /bin/pwd works, but need a place to direct output where i can check it after.
2012-11-27T19:35:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 after i get pwd running right i can substitute my bash script back in its place
2012-11-27T19:36:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	just do /bin/pwd/ > /some/location 2>&1
2012-11-27T19:36:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	that'll send output to /some/location and also push stderr to the same place stdout is going.
2012-11-27T19:36:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 i can just forget about the 2>&1 if i do that right? i'd much rather have control over where my script output goes anyway
2012-11-27T19:37:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	If you forget 2>&1, then stderr will go nowhere (or it should go to your mail, but we've shown that might not be working properly).
2012-11-27T19:38:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	As a habit, I use 2>&1 for all of the cronjobs that I have setup.
2012-11-27T19:38:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 does stderr mean if there is no error nothing would be there? it would make sense that pwd wouldn't error
2012-11-27T19:38:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	Correct.
2012-11-27T19:39:00.000Z	bhenry	Pici	 also is it the root mail folder ? owner of the cron file… or the user mail folder? the user specified in the cron file.
2012-11-27T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	bhenry	If you're using /etc/crontab its the user listed. If your using a user's crontab, its that user.
