2007-07-19T14:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	Has anyone helped you yet?
2007-07-19T14:03:00.000Z	iulian		no :)
2007-07-19T14:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	Okay, what FTP program are you using? SFTP? FTP? Other?
2007-07-19T14:04:00.000Z	iulian	ladydoor	ftp
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	I don't mean this in a rude way, but the best first step is always to read the manual. So do "man ftp"
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	iulian	ladydoor	thanks, I'll have a look.
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	meanwhile, go ahead and try to get connected by typing ftp host.whatever
2007-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	You might be able to do user@host
2007-07-19T14:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	I'd be glad to give you random tips if you need more
2007-07-19T14:07:00.000Z	iulian	ladydoor	I can connect bu I don't know how to transfer a file from /home/user/file to ftp path
2007-07-19T14:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	okay, once connected typing help will get you a list of commands. typing "help cp" (or whatever) will give you help on that command...let me see here...
2007-07-19T14:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	try this: put local-file-name remote-file-name
2007-07-19T14:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	(without the newline)
2007-07-19T14:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	and if you need to change the directory on your computer (not the server), try lcd newdir
2007-07-19T14:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	Did that help?
2007-07-19T14:10:00.000Z	iulian	ladydoor	scuse me for the delay; yes, put was exactly what I needed
2007-07-19T14:11:00.000Z	iulian	ladydoor	thank you
2007-07-19T14:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	Sweet.
2007-07-19T14:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	iulian	No problem.
