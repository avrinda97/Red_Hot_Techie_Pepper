2010-12-20T02:32:00.000Z	Gnimsh		Would someone please watch this video illustrating the video issue I have with 10.10 and let me know if they've encountered it? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0req-d9jXAk
2010-12-20T02:33:00.000Z	Gnimsh		It does however dissipate after 5 minutes and then stops completely
2010-12-20T02:33:00.000Z	Gnimsh		It also happens randomly
2010-12-20T02:34:00.000Z	Gnimsh		no cable, it's a laptop
2010-12-20T02:34:00.000Z	Gnimsh		It doesn't happen every time i start the laptop

2010-12-20T02:38:00.000Z	izinucs	Gnimsh	looks kinda like the wrong refresh rate. are you running nvidia?
2010-12-20T02:39:00.000Z	Gnimsh		no izinucs, ati
2010-12-20T02:40:00.000Z	Gnimsh		ati x1600 actually
2010-12-20T02:40:00.000Z	izinucs	Gnimsh	if you type xrandr in a terminal you
2010-12-20T02:40:00.000Z	Gnimsh		supposed to have better opensource support
2010-12-20T02:40:00.000Z	izinucs	Gnimsh	you'll see what the card is currently set at
2010-12-20T02:42:00.000Z	Gnimsh	izinucs	if it were a refresh rate issue wouldn't it always do that, instead of stopping after a few minutes?
2010-12-20T02:42:00.000Z	Gnimsh		i don't know how to tell which one is the refresh rate
2010-12-20T02:44:00.000Z	izinucs	Gnimsh	k. ati isn't my preferred card choice.. I really don't know much about how to configure it.. xrandr handles the configuration for resolution and refresh rate.. if the refresh is close but not correct the card might be trying to compensate.. if it's a separate card and not built into the motherboard then it might be worth the effort to pull it out and put it back to reseat it.. just shooting in the dark here.
