2011-01-03T10:07:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	what is the make and model of your wifi-card
2011-01-03T10:08:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	system -> administration -> additional drivers
2011-01-03T10:08:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	and you need to be connected to internet with ethernet to be able to download drivers
2011-01-03T10:09:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	you dont's see what?
2011-01-03T10:09:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	it's under system menu
2011-01-03T10:10:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	which version you are running?
2011-01-03T10:10:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	ubuntu?
2011-01-03T10:10:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	oh that's the reason
2011-01-03T10:12:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	you can find additional drivers from somewhere in xubuntu aswell, i just don't recall what is correct menu for that
2011-01-03T10:14:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	you can find the same menu from xubuntu aswell, just browse thru menus
2011-01-03T10:14:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	check under settings or something
2011-01-03T10:14:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	so you have active ethernet-connection there now?
2011-01-03T10:14:00.000Z	gobbe	geek__	if yes, just install ubuntu-desktop metapackage
