2006-05-29T14:16:00.000Z	puff		so I'm here in winxp because ubuntu for some reason doesn't see the wireless here.
2006-05-29T14:17:00.000Z	puff		I suspect that it may be that it's latching onto one of the secured wireless etworks in the area and not onto the public network.
2006-05-29T14:17:00.000Z	puff		What can I do to control this?
2006-05-29T14:18:00.000Z	puff		So speaking of human beings, any advice on my wireless question?
2006-05-29T14:19:00.000Z	amphi	puff	does iwlist scan show several networks?
2006-05-29T14:19:00.000Z	puff	amphi	 Yes.
2006-05-29T14:20:00.000Z	amphi	puff	so configure the essid channel etc with iwconfig
2006-05-29T14:20:00.000Z	puff	amphi	hm, Okay, I'll give that a shot.
2006-05-29T14:21:00.000Z	amphi	puff	once associated, dhclient <iface> or ifconfig <iface> to configure the interface
2006-05-29T14:24:00.000Z	amphi	puff	you could write a shell func
2006-05-29T14:24:00.000Z	puff	amphi	 Yeah, would probably be a good idea.
2006-05-29T14:25:00.000Z	amphi	puff	or ~/shell_trash or whatever, perhaps - /tmp gets cleaned up at boot time IIRC
2006-05-29T14:26:00.000Z	amphi	puff	er, ~/.shell_trash
2006-05-29T14:44:00.000Z	puff	amphi	Well, that didn't work.
2006-05-29T14:44:00.000Z	amphi	puff	what didn't work?
2006-05-29T14:45:00.000Z	amphi	puff	essid channel/freq mode etc are correct?
2006-05-29T14:45:00.000Z	amphi	puff	channel? mode?
2006-05-29T14:47:00.000Z	amphi	puff	perhaps you have something like waproamd running that's trying to associate to the wrong network?
2006-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	amphi	puff	the gui network config prog may be interfering?
