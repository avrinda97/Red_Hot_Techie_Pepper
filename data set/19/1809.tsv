2010-10-01T07:09:00.000Z	x0rs_ha		If I do a search using aptitude and there is a capital A before the name of the package, does that mean it's already installed?
2010-10-01T07:10:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	"A" means that it's automatically installed as a dependency of some other package. "i" is the generic indicator for installed.
2010-10-01T07:11:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	the package i was looking at is build-essential, I heard it is a prerequisite if I want to compile programs with success... Anyone know what I need to do to install it? aptitude install doesn't work
2010-10-01T07:12:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	"sudo aptitude install build-essential" doesn't work?
2010-10-01T07:12:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	nope
2010-10-01T07:12:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	since it has an A on it, i'm thinking i am suppose to install something else to get it
2010-10-01T07:12:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	which error do you get?
2010-10-01T07:12:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	does it have an "i" next to that "A"?
2010-10-01T07:13:00.000Z	x0rs_ha		no i
2010-10-01T07:13:00.000Z	x0rs_ha		and no error, just says 0 packages to install and 0 installed
2010-10-01T07:14:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	run "apt-cache policy build-essential", copy the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com/, link the page it creates here.
2010-10-01T07:14:00.000Z	x0rs_ha		ok
2010-10-01T07:16:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	i;m sorry I see it now, says "build-essential is already newest version" and the output of that last file says it is installed
2010-10-01T07:16:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	not sure why there is no i when I search it
2010-10-01T07:17:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	me either. but hey, problem solved.
2010-10-01T07:17:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	yep, thanks so much for the help
2010-10-01T07:22:00.000Z	x0rs_ha		should I upgrade my 10.04 to 10.10? or should I wait for official release?
2010-10-01T07:22:00.000Z	rww	x0rs_ha	you should wait
2010-10-01T07:22:00.000Z	x0rs_ha	rww	ok thanks
