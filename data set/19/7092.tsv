2007-10-31T00:26:00.000Z	Odd-rationale		QUESTION: In System ->Preferences -> Sessions, what is the command to have the network manager start up? Thanks!
2007-10-31T00:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	nm-applet
2007-10-31T00:27:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	Thanks!
2007-10-31T00:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	there's an additional parameter - hang on
2007-10-31T00:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	nm-applet --sm-disable
2007-10-31T00:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	What does the 2nd part do? Is it defualt?
2007-10-31T00:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	it's default , and I have no idea :)
2007-10-31T00:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	That should do, Thanks!
2007-10-31T00:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	looks like "session manage disable " or something
2007-10-31T00:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	Alright, can hardly go wrong with the default.
2007-10-31T00:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	well, I seem to recall doing it without --sm-disable and that worked OK, so try noth if one doesn't work
2007-10-31T00:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	Alright. Ubuntu Studio did not have anything for the NM! So I forgot what the command was.
2007-10-31T00:35:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	Can i start the applet from alt+f2?
2007-10-31T00:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	I don't know - just do this in gnome-terminal :  nm-applet --sm-disable & disown %1
2007-10-31T00:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	then save your session
2007-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	if nm-applet doesn't pop up, run  sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart
2007-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	thoreauputic	actually, i found out I don't have NM installed. :) Thanks for your help anyways!
2007-10-31T00:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	well, having it installed would help, yeah ;p
2007-10-31T00:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Odd-rationale	and you're welcome :)
