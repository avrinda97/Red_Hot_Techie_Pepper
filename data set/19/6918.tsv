2008-01-30T17:01:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	nope
2008-01-30T17:01:00.000Z	Nermal	albec1	try rmmod'ding the module and modprobing it again
2008-01-30T17:02:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	the network driver module?
2008-01-30T17:02:00.000Z	Nermal	albec1	yeah
2008-01-30T17:03:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	i cant figure out which module it is
2008-01-30T17:04:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	lsmod :D
2008-01-30T17:04:00.000Z	Nermal	albec1	can you paste the output of dmesg to pastebin ?

2008-01-30T17:14:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	did you get my pastebin?
2008-01-30T17:16:00.000Z	Nermal	albec1	yes - all I can see is your gigabit network card being eth0
2008-01-30T17:17:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	and when it crashes its not leaving anything in the log files
2008-01-30T17:18:00.000Z	albec1	Nermal	id like to restart the module though
