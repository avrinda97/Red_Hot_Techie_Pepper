2004-10-14T11:39:00.000Z	visik7		maybe I found the problem
2004-10-14T11:39:00.000Z	visik7		if I run 2.6.8.1 with normal parameters it start to say temperature too high shuting down
2004-10-14T11:39:00.000Z	visik7		and I'm forced to use acpi=off 
2004-10-14T11:40:00.000Z	visik7		and than I cannot load the acpi modules
2004-10-14T11:40:00.000Z	visik7		obviously
2004-10-14T11:40:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	never mind acpi, for me 2.6.8.1 broke apm
2006-05-27T15:37:00.000Z	visik7	amphi	I've corrected some of them following guides found on internet
2006-05-27T15:31:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	did you decompile, correct, and recompile your dsdt? ;)
2006-05-27T15:32:00.000Z	visik7	amphi	I haven't an acer, but helped many friends of mine to fix that crap
2006-05-27T15:33:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	loads of errors trying to recompile it?
2006-05-27T15:33:00.000Z	visik7	amphi	sorry ?
2006-05-27T15:34:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	the dsdt on the acer on which acpi was completely broken
2006-05-27T15:34:00.000Z	visik7	amphi	... yes
2006-05-27T15:36:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	could you correct them? I mucked about with my dsdt, just out of curiosity, but it compiled without error
2006-05-27T15:37:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	cool - did some things then work?
2006-05-27T15:38:00.000Z	visik7	amphi	I don't understand if you are joking or what ?
2006-05-27T15:39:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	no, I'm interested; were you able to correct the dsdt in such a way that you fixed some acpi probs?
2006-05-27T15:40:00.000Z	visik7	amphi	http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/ here there are almost all info that you need
2006-05-27T15:41:00.000Z	amphi	visik7	thanks; my dsdt seems ok, I was just interested in how much success you had futzing with it
