2005-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	Which mouse would work?
2005-04-25T10:26:00.000Z	Cybo-Mobile	Fazer	the one you have in xorg.conf
2005-04-25T10:26:00.000Z	Cybo-Mobile	Fazer	a trick to use is to plug both in at install time, that way both or either will work
2005-04-25T10:26:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	Can you help me tell me why USB isn't working with Ubuntu
2005-04-25T10:27:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	USB mouse and other USB devices don't work ( can get power but no functionality)
2005-04-25T10:28:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	"usb 1-1: New low speed USB device using ubci_hcd and address 4"
2005-04-25T10:29:00.000Z	Cybo-Mobile	Fazer	 your usb seems to be working
2005-04-25T10:29:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	So, should I try with my USB mp3 player (removable hard drive) then?
2005-04-25T10:30:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	SO I can get the drivers in for my wifi card? Ethernet just won't work, eventhough the lights blink and shit and I can get IP address, i can't access anything.
2005-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	So, now I get this: "New full sppeed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 9"
2005-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	"khubd timed out on ep0in and also on ep0out"
2005-04-25T10:32:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	"Dvice not accpeting adres s9, error -110"
2005-04-25T10:32:00.000Z	Fazer	Cybo-Mobile	So, what should I do....
