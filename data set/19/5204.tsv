2008-08-12T21:41:00.000Z	mps002		I rebooted Ubuntu and now it says no network devices were found, what do I do to get them back??
2008-08-12T21:41:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	lspci
2008-08-12T21:42:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	paste that to paste.ubuntu.com
2008-08-12T21:42:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	I can't, I'm on a different computer
2008-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	then no way to troubleshoot it; come back when you are on it.
2008-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	I can't connect on that computer because there is no way to connect if it thinks it has no network devices...
2008-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	you can still copy the relevant lines and paste to paste.ubuntu.com ; use a flash key
2008-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	I have no flash key
2008-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	until you provide that info you are stuck.
2008-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	lspci shows my ethernet controller but not my wireless, but neither shows up in network manager
2008-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	we need to know the chipset of the wifi; is is usb pcmcia or internal
2008-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	internal, it's broadcom, it worked before rebooting, but now it doesn't
2008-08-12T21:48:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	I've been using the restricted driver for it, it seems that perhaps todays updates screwed it
2008-08-12T21:48:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	what was updated? what kernel are you using?
2008-08-12T21:49:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	2.6.24-19-generic, I can't remember what exactly updated, but I know the updates were first available today in the repos
2008-08-12T21:50:00.000Z	bazhang	mps002	how did you get the broadcom working? ndiswrapper the fw-cutter or other
2008-08-12T21:51:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	I just used the restricted drivers from the administration menu
2008-08-12T21:51:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	it was probably fw
2008-08-12T21:57:00.000Z	mps002	bazhang	so any ideas?
