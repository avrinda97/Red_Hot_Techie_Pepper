2007-01-02T17:18:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	you downloaded the normal install CD? the one with a live CD on it too. right?
2007-01-02T17:18:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	ok, I haven't seen that particular error before but there is an alternat install cd that perhaps works better
2007-01-02T17:19:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	I don't have the url.. but it's on the offical ubuntu site
2007-01-02T17:20:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	mm.. as I said.. I don't what that that error means.. but you could try the alternate install cd... it solves problems for a lot of people
2007-01-02T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	then perhaps it works.. perhaps...can't promise anything
2007-01-02T17:22:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	here's one link.. http://ftp.ds.karen.hj.se/pub/os/linux/ubuntu-iso/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
2007-01-02T17:23:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	there are probably faster mirrors closer to you.. but then you'll have to check the site yourself... this one is in sweden
2007-01-02T17:23:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	only difference is that this one is text-based.. no live cd.. and it mostly works ;)
2007-01-02T17:24:00.000Z	Slart	lhkjhkjh	as I said.. I can't guarantee this will fix your problem.. but it's worth a try
