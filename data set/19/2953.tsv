2010-05-17T20:45:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	but it can render some machines unbootable
2010-05-17T20:45:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	which doesnt destroy your data
2010-05-17T20:46:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	i know but its a pain in the ass to repartition then reinstall a distro again to access /home
2010-05-17T20:46:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	repartition? why?
2010-05-17T20:46:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	also, language
2010-05-17T20:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	move the /home partition (if it is in one) to the end and create a new partition in ext3/4 to install the distro again
2010-05-17T20:47:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	why?
2010-05-17T20:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	in case it isn't already at the end of the table
2010-05-17T20:48:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	why would it need to be? why would it even need to be on its own partition at all?
2010-05-17T20:48:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	keep in mind ubuntu has not deleted /home when reinstalling to a single-partition system in at least 2 years
2010-05-17T20:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	its just for those who dual boot, makes it easier to manage
2010-08-09T03:22:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	its still the same disk. not much of a backup
2010-08-09T03:23:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	and its still only one copy
2010-08-09T03:23:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	plus, ubuntu's installer has an option that doesnt overwrite directories named "home" when you reinstall
2010-08-09T03:23:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	really? wow ubuntu has changed alot since i used it
2010-08-09T03:24:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	in the manual install thing, you can choose to not format a partition before installing. that keeps /home
2010-08-09T03:24:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	er  manual partition thing, i mean
2011-04-18T22:11:00.000Z	maco	aeon-ltd	id ask that in #ubuntu-ops
2011-04-18T22:11:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	maco	thanks
