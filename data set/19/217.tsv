2012-06-26T11:48:00.000Z	vampirnata		I've but a SATA hdd that has SMART capability into a USB enclosure and now it seems that the I can't get info using SMART. Is this a limitation of the enclosure or USB?
2012-06-26T11:49:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad	vampirnata	the enclosure won't translate low-level stuff like that across a USB. it's basically a mobo emulator with a hotplug USB connection
2012-06-26T11:50:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	thank you for the clarification. No way around it then?
2012-06-26T11:51:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad	vampirnata	nope. you'll either have to plug it into a real mobo or cope
2012-06-26T11:51:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	alrighty. Thank you :)
2012-06-26T11:52:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	any idea regarding my previous question about lm-sensors?
2012-06-26T11:53:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	apparently a USB3 enclosure supports SMART...
2012-06-26T11:53:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad	vampirnata	never had much success with the hard sensors in my boxen, sorry. if I'm concerned about heating, I have a laser thermometer
2012-06-26T11:54:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad	vampirnata	all the ones I've seen that let you plug your own drive into them were pretty simple. Apparently they've gotten better since the last time I bought one
2012-06-26T11:55:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	ahh okay. I'm not too concerned but I was curious about the GPU temp. The board came with a very noisy little fan on the intel GPU. I removed it and put a decent 120mm fan on the outside of the case instead. The CPU temp went from 39degrees to 20degrees, so I hope the gpu temp also decreased :)
2012-06-26T11:57:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad	vampirnata	what's xsensors say?
2012-06-26T11:58:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	don't have x, running cli.
2012-06-26T11:58:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad		then sensors
2012-06-26T11:58:00.000Z	vampirnata		only coretemp readings. core0 and core1
2012-06-26T11:58:00.000Z	vampirnata		however the motherboard tech specs say it has more.
2012-06-26T11:59:00.000Z	vampirnata		running sensors-detect finds another module and loads it but doesn't display anything
2012-06-26T11:59:00.000Z	Nerf_Jihad		acpi -tf says what?
2012-06-26T12:00:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	installing it quick
2012-06-26T12:01:00.000Z	vampirnata	Nerf_Jihad	no output
