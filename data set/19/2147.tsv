2010-06-16T18:36:00.000Z	jmestrada		it seems to me that Ubuntu LiveCD has problem to start on SATA or High capacity HD, it is finding problems to work with the drives, anybody knows something about it?
2010-06-16T18:38:00.000Z	jmestrada		any recommendation? I don't want to install Win 7 or any other Win version, has anybody experienced something similar?
2010-06-16T18:38:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	experienced what, exactly?
2010-06-16T18:39:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	I can't install Lucid on a brand new pc
2010-06-16T18:40:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	here's how a help channel works: you supply us with as much information as possible, and then we try to figure out what's causing your problem. currently, we're stuck at step 1...
2010-06-16T18:43:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	can you boot from the live cd, without trying the installer?
2010-06-16T18:44:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	I am booting from LiveCD
2010-06-16T18:45:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	process stops before showing any installation interfase at all
2010-06-16T18:46:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	might be worth verifying the cd image
2010-06-16T18:47:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	might you have another machine to test it on?
2010-06-16T18:47:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	if you mean to checksum the ISO file, I did it
2010-06-16T18:48:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	no, i meant verify that the disk itself was burned correctly
2010-06-16T18:48:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	I installed Ubuntu 10.04 on another machine already with the same CD
2010-06-16T18:49:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	I thought that it could be dued to 32-bit Lucid LiveCD I was using first, so I downloaded 64-bit version, but i didn't work neither
2010-06-16T18:50:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	interesting. and you say it won't even boot? any other errors logged to the console?
2010-06-16T18:50:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	a lot of error and logs, all related to drives
2010-06-16T18:51:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	do you have another operating system running on the machine?
2010-06-16T18:51:00.000Z	sipior	jmestrada	might simply be that the disk is going
2010-06-16T19:10:00.000Z	jmestrada	sipior	I saw people messages on the Web about this installation problem, or at least with the same error message "Unexpected exit with status 0x0009", one of the them was related to ACPI issues on a laptop and stuff like that
