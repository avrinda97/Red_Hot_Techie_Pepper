2007-05-26T08:04:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	you probably have to extract, run ./configure, make, then make install
2007-05-26T08:04:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	that's not the best idea if you can use apt-get
2007-05-26T08:05:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	you can google for a HOWTO on this subject. Someone's probably written documentation about this.
2007-05-26T08:06:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	right
2007-05-26T08:07:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	there wouldn't be - you probably have to compile it
2007-05-26T08:07:00.000Z	Notchnick	javaJake	 I googled.. and I endup having another problem
2007-05-26T08:07:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	what version of Ubuntu do you have?
2007-05-26T08:07:00.000Z	Notchnick	javaJake	 7.04
2007-05-26T08:07:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	OK... gimme a second...
2007-05-26T08:08:00.000Z	Notchnick	javaJake	 tyt
2007-05-26T08:08:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	there's this... http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/install-vmware-tools-on-ubuntu-edgy-eft/
2007-05-26T08:09:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	it should work
2007-05-26T08:09:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	more googling produced this as well: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=421904
2007-05-26T08:10:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	it appears you might have to make a small edit for the VMWare tools to work properly
2007-05-26T08:10:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	however I wouldn't try that last link until you tried the first all the way through
2007-05-26T08:11:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	if you ask someone else for help, showing them these two links, and saying you followed them, will help your "helper" better understand your situation.
2007-05-26T08:13:00.000Z	Notchnick	javaJake	 I had a mount problem .. while trying to mount ubuntu disc using the first link... I'll try to use a disc and use that command again
2007-05-26T08:13:00.000Z	Notchnick	javaJake	 thanks anyways.. will see how it goes
2007-05-26T08:14:00.000Z	javaJake	Notchnick	ok, wish you luck!
