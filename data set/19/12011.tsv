2005-11-04T11:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	i mean, on at least one machine
2005-11-04T11:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	what linux are you running now? if you can mount the CD, you can fairly easily check it
2005-11-04T11:52:00.000Z	qwerrttyy	HappyFool	Breezy
2005-11-04T11:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	so it's running ok?
2005-11-04T11:53:00.000Z	qwerrttyy	HappyFool	on a different machine, however, I think it froze on install on this machine too and I had to try twice or thrice
2005-11-04T11:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	hmm. odd. anyway, put the install cd into this machine, and mount it (it should auto-mount)
2005-11-04T11:53:00.000Z	qwerrttyy	HappyFool	done and done
2005-11-04T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	ok, start a terminal, and type 'cd /media/cdrom'
2005-11-04T11:54:00.000Z	qwerrttyy	HappyFool	done
2005-11-04T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	then 'md5sum -c md5sum.txt|tee ~/md5results.txt' -- that will scroll info and write it to a file md5results.txt in your home dir
2005-11-04T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	if there are any 'FAIL' entries, there's a problem; if not, the files should be OK
2005-11-04T12:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	what sort of machine is it?
2005-11-04T12:15:00.000Z	qwerrttyy	HappyFool	lowend generic, mmm 500mhz amd-k6-2, with 192mb ram, two PCI slots, two ISA slots, and AT-type plugin for other devices
2005-11-04T12:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	did you have a similar error on the other machine? you said it froze once or twice?
2005-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	well, if it's the same error on a different machine, that is odd
2005-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	qwerrttyy	i'm not sure of all the possible causes but i would guess 1) faulty hardware, 2) unsupported hardware and 3) bug in installer
