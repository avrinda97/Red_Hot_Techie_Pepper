2007-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	jasin		Hi
2007-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	jasin		I got wpa working in ubuntu :)
2007-04-15T10:18:00.000Z	jasin		lancelot, sounds like that library is corrupt or missing.
2007-04-15T10:19:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 but in which package is that? 'cause i've already installed Libar2
2007-04-15T10:19:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 i just removed it and installed again using apt-get
2007-04-15T10:20:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 do you know in which package is that library in?
2007-04-15T10:30:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 i'll try to reinstall libart-2.0.2
2007-04-15T10:33:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 Setting up libart2 (1.4.2-32) ...
2007-04-15T10:34:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 after remove and install libart2 with apt-get im still receiving the error msg
2007-04-15T10:37:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 do you know what can be happening over here? once i've already installed libart2 using apt-get ?
2007-04-15T10:40:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 so, damm it.. maybe it could be a bug at Ubuntu sources?
2007-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 can u send me your libart_lgpl_2.so.2 ??
2007-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 ok, i'll search for that..
2007-04-15T10:42:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 which one do u use?
2007-04-15T10:44:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 ok, thanks!
2007-04-15T10:47:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 i have photoshop on my Ubuntu =)
2007-04-15T10:48:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 ok, i'll try to reboot here after trying to remove and install again "Libart2"
2007-04-15T10:48:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 yes, but it seems to be a bug, im trying to write on a image, but the smallest font appears the biggest one... i dont know why =/
2007-04-15T10:52:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	jasin	 i found 2 files called libart_lgpl_2.so.2 on the same dir... thats weird
