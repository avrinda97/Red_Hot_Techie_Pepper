2011-03-15T03:33:00.000Z	chamunks		Anyone got any information on setting up ATI / AMD video cards Catalyst driver and Xorg.conf?
2011-03-15T03:34:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	should be fairly automatic. what card do you have, and which version of ubuntu are you running?
2011-03-15T03:35:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	Heh its never straight forward with newer hardware. I'm rockin two AMD Sapphire HD6850's and I want to get my dual monitors working again or at least the darn catalyst driver.
2011-03-15T03:35:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	you're right; that's far from straightforward lol
2011-03-15T03:35:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	afraid i've never attempted what you are in linux, sorry but i don't think i'd be helpful
2011-03-15T03:36:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	I figured since sapphire doesent supply a driver that I could maybe cheap out and go with the amd driver for the HD6850.
2011-03-15T03:36:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	I
2011-03-15T03:37:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	i always go with standard amd drivers
2011-03-15T03:37:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	fwiw
2011-03-15T03:37:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	I'm thinking that my biggest issue is xorg.conf  If I can figure out how to build a barebones xorg.conf that will recognize my video card's and their identifiers that would be best.
2011-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	lol gentoo much?
2011-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	I dont really need spoonfeeding but any suggestions or possible research might help.
2011-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	Actually have never touched gentoo past an early version like 10 years ago when I first tried using linux.
2011-03-15T03:39:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	i really hate to say it but besides snarky humor i probably won't be much help
2011-03-15T03:39:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	its alright I was hopeful :P
2011-03-15T03:39:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	I have no idea how to address a video card at all lol.  But I know that xorg.conf wants me to do so.
2011-03-15T03:40:00.000Z	cchildress	chamunks	it's just a section in xorg.conf...it's been 3-4 years since i hand-configed an xorg.conf myself
2011-03-15T03:41:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	hmm its all good I should probably sleep on this problem and be content with the fact that my computer is working lol... :S grumble grumble.
2011-03-15T03:41:00.000Z	chamunks	cchildress	well thanks for your time and attention either way.
