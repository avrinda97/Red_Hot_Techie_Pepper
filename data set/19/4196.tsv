2009-04-26T04:51:00.000Z	bacon1989		Hello, how do I find out what disk resembles what hard drive number ex. hd 0,0?
2009-04-26T04:52:00.000Z	bacon1989		yes, I know that
2009-04-26T04:52:00.000Z	bacon1989		but i want to know what hd resembles which?
2009-04-26T04:52:00.000Z	bacon1989		does it depend on it's bootorder in the bios?
2009-04-26T04:53:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	/dev/sdXY -> X is a letter, Y is a number (X corresponds to drive, Y partition), convert X to a number (a=1, b = 2,etc) and then subtract one from each.
2009-04-26T04:53:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	No, but it may be slightly different if you're mixing SATA and PATA drives.  Your BIOS will do all of one type, then all of the other type.
2009-04-26T04:53:00.000Z	bacon1989	Flannel	so boot order in the bios does not have any effect on it's numbering?
2009-04-26T04:54:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	Not usually, no.
2009-04-26T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	What partition does linux think its on?
2009-04-26T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	(sudo fdisk -l)
2009-04-26T05:10:00.000Z	bacon1989	Flannel	I tried rootnoverify(hd0,1) \n makeactive \n chainloader +1
2009-04-26T05:10:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	What sort of harddrives do you have in this?
2009-04-26T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	Try hd1,1 then.
2009-04-26T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	or hd2,1
2009-04-26T05:17:00.000Z	bacon1989	Flannel	when I use (hd,0,1) it sits at "Starting Up ..."
2009-04-26T05:17:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	That means you've passed the thing on to Widnows, and windows is freaking out about something.
2009-04-26T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	You may have to map your partitions/drives, or fiddle with boot.ini (fiddling won't likely be required, mapping is better)
2009-04-26T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	bacon1989	map (hd0) (hd1)\n map (hd1) (hd0) will swap hd1 and hd0 for the OS it boots, etc.
2009-04-26T05:26:00.000Z	bacon1989	Flannel	I think I have a good idea. i'm gonna go into winxp recovery console and do a fixboot
