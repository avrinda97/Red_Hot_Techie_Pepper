2007-03-03T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	mig	are you trying to use xinerama or the ati functionality for dual screen
2007-03-03T14:05:00.000Z	mig		The aticonfig settings.
2007-03-03T14:06:00.000Z	mig		I tried Xinerama and others but no luck.
2007-03-03T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	mig	whats "others
2007-03-03T14:06:00.000Z	mig		MergedFb was the other.
2007-03-03T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	mig	I suggest you either hit #xorg - or #ati (probably ati as xorg hates chatting about nvidia/ati) for detailed config help
2007-03-03T14:07:00.000Z	mig	ikonia	Will try those then.
2007-03-03T14:46:00.000Z	mig	ikonia	Managed to fix things, nearly. Any idea why the mouse cursor would be showing up as a massive image?
2007-03-03T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	mig	overall screen resolution ??? no idea
2007-03-03T14:47:00.000Z	mig	ikonia	Resolutions and everything is sorted out, just have a large weird image instead of mouse cursor on second monitor.
2007-03-03T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	mig	ahhh now that you mention it, it just clicked there WAS a problem with the mouse and ati drivers earlier on, a few people have mentioned it. There is/was no fix for it. Search launchpad for the bug
