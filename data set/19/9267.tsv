2006-12-05T11:59:00.000Z	A3n		how do i get dhcp to work with my wireless? "wireless tools for linux" can scan all AP's including my own but i dont seem to be able to get dhcp from it
2006-12-05T12:00:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	what encryption are you using?
2006-12-05T12:01:00.000Z	A3n		none
2006-12-05T12:02:00.000Z	A3n	w3ccv	iwscan finds my ap and iwconfig sets my ap and all that everything is fine, but dhclient just cant find dhcp
2006-12-05T12:02:00.000Z	A3n	w3ccv	and i have no idea why
2006-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	can you look at the AP, the log should tell if you connected
2006-12-05T12:04:00.000Z	A3n	w3ccv	what log? dmesg?
2006-12-05T12:04:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	the AP log, you will need to connect to it's admin interface
2006-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	A3n		well i cant get to the AP log when i'm in ubuntu because i dont have internet in ubuntu lol
2006-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	A3n		ow nvm tha
2006-12-05T12:05:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	thught you may have another way in.
2006-12-05T12:06:00.000Z	A3n	w3ccv	well i dont remember being a log there
2006-12-05T12:06:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	tail dmesg or tail -f /var/log/messages to see what your connection is doing
2006-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	 my linksys and dlink have logs. not real detailed and not always helpful
2006-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	A3n		omg i think i know what the problem is
2006-12-05T12:07:00.000Z	A3n		i'm in my router config
2006-12-05T12:08:00.000Z	A3n		it says DHCP to my dads, moms and sis pc but to me it says reserved
2006-12-05T12:08:00.000Z	A3n		lol
2006-12-05T12:08:00.000Z	w3ccv	A3n	ah ha!  most problems should be that simple
