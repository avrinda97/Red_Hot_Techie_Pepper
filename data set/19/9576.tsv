2006-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	BubbaTheLoveSpon	anyway i have another problem too, can not call with skype. So I can hear the presons but they can not hear me. I think it is a driver problem, my sound card is a rare one I use a Dell Inspiron 1300 laptop. And I can not configure my microphone at all. I use the latest version of skype
