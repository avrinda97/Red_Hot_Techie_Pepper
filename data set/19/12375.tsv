2006-08-13T16:21:00.000Z	idontknow		can someone help me please? my forum has all the sudden... started acting really strange
2006-08-13T16:21:00.000Z	idontknow		some topics come right up... but most of them... take around a minute to load
2006-08-13T16:22:00.000Z	idontknow		nothing has been changed..
2006-08-13T16:22:00.000Z	idontknow		the server is ubuntu...

2006-08-13T16:22:00.000Z	idontknow		someone boot that dude for flooding...
2006-08-13T16:23:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	you havent given us nearly enough information to diagnose anything
2006-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	so... 'nothing has changed', lets see, obviously, something has changed.  So, now we try and figure out what.  I imagine the forum uses SQL, and... who knows, somethig else.  it won't load for me.  I imagine its a SQL issue.  Bad data in your queries or whatnot.
2006-08-13T16:29:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	no, the SOFTWARE hasnt changed.  something mustve changed.  whether it's data, or something else.
2006-08-13T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	looks like the topics with those orange images are problematic.  And the more, the longer it takes
2006-08-13T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	and yes, wine.getyadda doesnt load
2006-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	right, but *that* appears to be causing your problem
2006-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	Those images are the problem.  Look through your code, take a look at the other site.  And, clean up your html, you have a webpage in a webpage.
2006-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	the ones without those orange banner images load fast
2006-08-13T16:38:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	yes, the little... 100 x 15px  orange image things
2006-08-13T16:39:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	no.  the orange image.  http://eb.sszones.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=313 has one  http://eb.sszones.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=305 has one  http://eb.sszones.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=241 has none
2006-08-13T16:40:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	well, something changed.  Lamenting about it here isn't going to do anything.  It's not an ubuntu problem, suggest you take it up with the server people, or the forum people.  And as I already said, clean up your html.  complete pages don't go inside of table cells.
2006-08-13T16:41:00.000Z	Flannel	idontknow	then it's not the database, not your server.  must be that other site, the one with the orange images.
