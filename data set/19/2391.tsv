2010-07-06T09:14:00.000Z	lucas-arg		if i do update-manager -d and upgrade everything, is upgrade going to be the lastest ubuntu? im asking this since i dont want to loose all configurations and software installed and start all over again... is it possible? is it ok to do this?
2010-07-06T09:14:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	-d means it takes you to the deveopment version
2010-07-06T09:14:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	itll take you to 10.10 alpha 2
2010-07-06T09:15:00.000Z	lucas-arg	maco	but when final release is out, if i do that that will take me to lastest ubutnu, am i right?
2010-07-06T09:15:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	no it ALWAYS means development version if you use -d
2010-07-06T09:16:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	if you just want a stable release, thatll show in the top part of update-manager normally
2010-07-06T09:16:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	if youre on a LTS release itll only show the next LTS by default. you change that in system -> administration -> software sources
2010-07-06T09:16:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	no
2010-07-06T09:17:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	no
2010-07-06T09:17:00.000Z	lucas-arg	maco	so if i set it to normal releases and wait until 10.10 is out, i can upgrade to that version with synaptic?
2010-07-06T09:17:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	yes
2010-07-06T09:17:00.000Z	lucas-arg	maco	so its "kinda" rolling release... i mean... i can have lastest version anyways and not loose all what ive done...
2010-07-06T09:18:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	it's not rolling, no. the closest you get to rolling is constantly running the devel version
2010-07-06T09:18:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	its just that it allows upgrade-over-the-internet
2010-07-06T09:18:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	the release names in /etc/apt/sources.list will still be updated for example
2010-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	yes you will
2010-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	its called an online upgrade
2010-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	maco	lucas-arg	or a dist-upgrade
2010-07-06T09:21:00.000Z	lucas-arg	maco	great... thanks, i was thinking on moving to rolling release distro, but i see now how it works...
