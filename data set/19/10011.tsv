2006-08-12T11:47:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	you will need at least the xserver-xorg package to get an X server
2006-08-12T11:54:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	Ok, now I've installed xserver-xorg, but when trying to run "startx" it fails, giving me errors of it cant open /dev/wacom and some fonts, then it says: "Fatal server error:", "could not open default font 'fixed'", "XIO: fatal IO error 104 (connection reset by peer) on X server ":0.0" after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining."
2006-08-12T11:55:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	you need some of the xfonts packages installed too
2006-08-12T11:55:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	is there any reason you can't just install one of the -desktop packages to get all the dependencies?
2006-08-12T11:56:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	its a low-end computer with limited resources and hard-drive..
2006-08-12T11:56:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	what about xubuntu? that's what it's designed for..
2006-08-12T11:56:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	installing xubuntu-desktop then remove xfce and install fluxbox instead if you want that, probably will be easiest
2006-08-12T11:57:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	I also want to learn a little more of how a distro is built, so just taking 2 flies in one smack :)
2006-08-12T11:58:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	but do you know the names of the xfont packages?
2006-08-12T12:00:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	there are quite a few, "apt-cache search xfonts" to see them
2006-08-12T12:01:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	what was the command for scrolling trough lots of input in console?
2006-08-12T12:02:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	you can pipe it to less, so "apt-cache search foo | less" will let you scroll up and down with the cursor keys
2006-08-12T12:02:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	i mean output of course, i remember i pressed a button and the next chunk of output was displayed..
2006-08-12T12:02:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	"apt-cache search foo | more" will do that
2006-08-12T12:03:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	but "less" is better because it lets you scroll back up as well :)
2006-08-12T12:07:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	chaddy: PierreTramo: Thanks a lot, now I got it working :)
2006-08-12T13:41:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	"checkinstall" is a quick and dirty way of making a .deb from source
2006-08-12T13:41:00.000Z	longwave	rubuntus	otherwise read the ubuntu and debian packaging guides to build more complex packages
2006-08-12T13:41:00.000Z	rubuntus	longwave	ok :) thanks again =)
