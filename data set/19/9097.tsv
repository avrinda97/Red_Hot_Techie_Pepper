2006-12-27T14:19:00.000Z	eitan		hey guys, i just installed ubu on a new sony vaio laptop...everything works great except for the SD card slot.  This slot works in winxp but when I put in a sd card while running ubu nothing happens.  How can i troubleshoot this?  I searched on the problem already.  Thanks!
