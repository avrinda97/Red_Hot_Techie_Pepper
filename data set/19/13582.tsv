2005-03-02T10:24:00.000Z	michele		How can I change screen resolution to one not showed in the menu ?
2005-03-02T10:26:00.000Z	kreiger	michele	i was trying to do the same thing
2005-03-02T10:26:00.000Z	kreiger	michele	in sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 are some options supposedly
2005-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	kreiger		Carthik, what did your ubuntu let you sit at?
2005-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	kreiger		and what did knoppix run at?
2005-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	michele		The problem is that i have a notebook with an external monitor and the notebok panel not support the resolution 1280x but the external monitor yes
2005-03-02T10:28:00.000Z	michele	carthik	this is good idea because knoppix allow me to set the resolution that i want
