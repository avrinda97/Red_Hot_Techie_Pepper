2007-07-23T15:18:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	use file to find out what it is
2007-08-03T13:46:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	try avidemux for a simple yet powerful getting started app
2007-08-03T13:48:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	that's simple and easy: when you want more, /join #mplayer
2007-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	avidemux didn't work?
2007-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	you can /join #mplayer
2007-08-04T06:44:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	arwen is very helpful.. you must just be misunderstanding
2007-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	jetscreamer	unagi	you use mencoder... :p
