2009-01-03T11:55:00.000Z	fweet		huh?
2009-01-03T11:55:00.000Z	fweet		you talking about PAE?
2009-01-03T11:55:00.000Z	fweet		if i install PAE, are there any problems i iwll face?
2009-01-03T11:56:00.000Z	fweet		okay so ,  how stable is Debian on PAE kernel
2009-01-03T11:56:00.000Z	fweet		ok, how compatible is it
2009-01-03T11:56:00.000Z	fweet		with other apps
2009-01-03T11:56:00.000Z	fweet		like WINE
2009-01-03T11:57:00.000Z	fweet		does wine run out of the box on 64-bit?
2009-01-03T11:57:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	#debian would probably be a better place to ask that. if you would like to support all 8gigs, you should give 64-bit a shot.
2009-01-03T11:59:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	64-bit Ubuntu can detect and use 8 gigs of ram.
2009-01-03T12:05:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	why? 32bit can do 4gigs
2009-01-03T12:06:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	no, it might only detect 3.2 off the bat, but you can make it do 4
2009-01-03T12:09:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	it's already there, did you check out the website links i gave you?
2009-01-03T12:10:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	what cpu do you have?
2009-01-03T12:13:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	you may find this helpful: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=94172
2009-01-03T12:16:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	there's wine, crossover (for professional applications) and cedega (for games), which are all based on wine
2009-01-03T12:18:00.000Z	Gnea	fweet	no, but it's not expensive
