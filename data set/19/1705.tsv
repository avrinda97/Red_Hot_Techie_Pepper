2011-01-06T20:32:00.000Z	Weazel		hey guys, it drivers me crazy, everytime i watch youtube my screen dims after about 2-3minutes, is there anything that i can do so ubuntu notice activity when using flash ? <--
2011-01-06T20:34:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	Move your mouse around when in youtube, else turn up the settings a little, since gnome checks activity with movement or key presses. Flash can't be detected normally.
2011-01-06T20:35:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	yea well thats what i do so far, but its really a bugger if i wanna just lay back and watch smt :/
2011-01-06T20:36:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	Then you'll change to get a wilress mouse, or extend the time to something like 10 to 15 minute?
2011-01-06T20:37:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	Thouhg I'm not sure how yet.. you could potentially have a script which toggels between watching videos which increases your timeouts and normla mode?
2011-01-06T20:37:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	frogballs prob is i'm at work with this laptop, and i want it to lock up every 30 sec, so no one checks my computer if i'm away from it and forgot to lock it, and sometime i'm alone and want to watch some youtube, so i was looking for a solution where i can keep the settings as it is, and can watch youtube without the need to move or press anything while i watch smt
2011-01-06T20:38:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	thats sounds like a fair workaround, but i have no knowledge with scripting i'm afraid :/
2011-01-06T20:39:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	I need to find a way to edit gnome settngs live from the command line first.. can't be that hard after that is found out.
2011-01-06T20:54:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	which could be a flash advertisment no ?
2011-01-06T20:54:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	Looking at that links, it detects for a running flash library.
2011-01-06T20:55:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	True.. I'm not sure if that can be gottten around.
2011-01-06T20:55:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	smt had been said in the comments there, but not sure what it does ><
2011-01-06T20:58:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	They first comment might be useable, but I have no idea..., you could awalys detect how much cpu is being used by flash and only block the screen saver is flash is running & cpu is high usage?
2011-01-06T20:59:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	being an only gui noob i have no idea how to even check that ><
2011-01-06T20:59:00.000Z	Weazel	Dcite	hey but i have a pretty decent theme going on ! XD
2011-01-06T21:00:00.000Z	Dcite	Weazel	Great, atleast something went right with your experience.
