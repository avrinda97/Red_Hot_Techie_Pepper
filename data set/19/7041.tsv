2007-12-02T10:51:00.000Z	nnotonekind		Someone helped me a little bit ago
2007-12-02T10:51:00.000Z	nnotonekind		someone helped me a little bit ago, told me to recover my windows partition. are you still here?
2007-12-02T10:52:00.000Z	nnotonekind		I REALLY need to find the person that was helping me get my files back after the PC recovery
2007-12-02T10:54:00.000Z	nnotonekind		Can anyone help me? I just loaded Ubuntu and it stopped seeing my C drive
2007-12-02T10:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	I wasn't that person, but ask your question.
2007-12-02T11:05:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Sure. So you are dual booting widows XP and ubuntu 7.1?
2007-12-02T11:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Sorry, I know someone was helping you. But I don't understand the backstory. Can you tell me about your setup and what happened. I see what you've tried, but I still need some more info.
2007-12-02T11:08:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	From the live dc right? And keep the explanations on one line.
2007-12-02T11:09:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	ok... when when you copied those files over did you do anything special? Or just boot the live cd and copy the files?
2007-12-02T11:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	But otherwise, it's an entirely XP system? That's the only thing on there?
2007-12-02T11:11:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Home or Pro?
2007-12-02T11:17:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Are you able to boot windows?
2007-12-02T11:18:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	If you can boot windows, can you not log into your account?
2007-12-02T11:19:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Ok... I feel like we're making progress here. When you say there's 90GB of files you can't access.... what do you mean?
2007-12-02T11:21:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	And you've searched Windows XP help channels? I just ask because, it's possible that an Ubuntu Live cd will recover your files, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first step.
2007-12-02T11:24:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Don't worry about it nnotonekind. I realize the files are still there... probably.. and that ubuntu saw them. What I'm saying is, you're asking Ubuntu to mess with XP and NTFS. Both are closed source and the Open Source community has had to do its best to work with it without MS cooperation. So, what i'm saying is if a MS solution is availabe, it's probably best to try that first.
2007-12-02T11:27:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Let's go to a PM... I'd like to try and help you, but I'm not sure the OPS will allow this kind of thing here. This seems like XP trouble.
2007-12-02T11:29:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	No, but I sent you one. What client are you using>
2007-12-02T11:30:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	nnotonekind	Forget it, just type "/join #nnotonekind
