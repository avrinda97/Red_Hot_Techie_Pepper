2005-03-30T16:38:00.000Z	aspuru		Hi all, what is the comand for 're-configuring X' in ubuntu (dpkg-reconfigure ____ ?)
2005-03-30T16:38:00.000Z	aspuru		I am getting an error when installing the nvidia module:
2005-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	aspuru		Error: your X configuration has been altered.
2005-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	aspuru		This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
2005-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	aspuru		not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
2005-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	aspuru		command:
2005-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	sysrq	aspuru	doesn't matter
2005-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	aspuru		thanks guys... trying :P
2005-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	sysrq	aspuru	what part of the error msg it gave you did you not understand
2005-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	aspuru		Shall I use the kernel framebuffer interface?
2005-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	aspuru		(With 'nvidia' driver?)
2005-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	aspuru		Thanks Gandalfar
2005-03-30T16:43:00.000Z	aspuru		For nvidia, I shall not use glx right?
2005-03-30T16:43:00.000Z	aspuru		(dpkg-reconfigure asks a lot of questions :P)
2005-03-30T16:43:00.000Z	sysrq	aspuru	have you read the nvidia README like you should have?
2005-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	aspuru	sysrq	I have read it, and also the ubuntulinux pages
2005-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	aspuru		but I was getting a dark black screen
2005-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	aspuru		that I attributed tdo the fact that hoary is still in testing
2005-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	sysrq	aspuru	I doubt that because it states weather you need glx loaded or not
