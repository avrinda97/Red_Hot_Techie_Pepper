2010-02-07T14:20:00.000Z	yorick		help...my system is crashing about every other bootup
2010-02-07T14:21:00.000Z	yorick		the crashes happen like this: every application shuts down, usually in the order I started them, until the system hangs
2010-02-07T14:21:00.000Z	yorick		and then when I reboot, it is perfectly fine
2010-02-07T14:21:00.000Z	yorick		this usually happens about 5 minutes after bootup
2010-02-07T14:22:00.000Z	yorick		I suspect this is not entirely an ubuntu problem, as it has been happening when the system had XP
2010-02-07T14:22:00.000Z	yorick		and also before I replaced my motherboard and memory
2010-02-07T14:23:00.000Z	llutz	yorick	thermal issues
2010-02-07T14:24:00.000Z	yorick		Yorvik: grrr...
2010-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	yorick	llutz	hmm...how would thermal issues affect this then?
2010-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	llutz	yorick	check cpu/board temperatures
2010-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	llutz	yorick	run memtest to make sure, memory is OK
2010-02-07T14:26:00.000Z	yorick	llutz	sys: 30.0C, cpu: 55.5C, AUX: 50.5C
2010-02-07T14:26:00.000Z	yorick	llutz	memtest has repeatedly shown no errors
2010-02-07T14:30:00.000Z	yorick	llutz	there it happened again
2010-02-07T14:31:00.000Z	yorick	llutz	this time, it dropped me into the login screen after some garbage was shown on the screen
2010-02-07T14:31:00.000Z	yorick		and restart just hanged
2010-02-07T14:31:00.000Z	llutz	yorick	you'd better ask in some hardware-related channels
2010-02-07T14:31:00.000Z	yorick	llutz	you know any?
2010-02-07T14:31:00.000Z	llutz	yorick	no, sorry
