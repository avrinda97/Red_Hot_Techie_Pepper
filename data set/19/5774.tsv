2012-05-23T20:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stueng	 your users name is media? how.. weird.
2012-05-23T20:50:00.000Z	stueng	Dr_Willis	its a xbmc box
2012-05-23T20:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stueng	 that looks right. but you could use the ls -R command to see what files are actually changed. most likely its just one or 2 of them
2012-05-23T20:51:00.000Z	stueng		"there are stopped jobs" someone remind me how to fall back to them pls
2012-05-23T20:51:00.000Z	stueng		its been a while :P
2012-05-23T20:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		bg/fg commands are for job controll normally
2012-05-23T20:52:00.000Z	stueng		ty thats it
2012-05-23T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		saw a neat guide once on bash job control ;)
2012-05-23T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		but i rarely use 1%  of bash's features it seems
2012-05-23T20:56:00.000Z	stueng		startx as the user still results in blank screen Dr_Willis
2012-05-23T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stueng	 move all their config and other files to some subdir perhaps. to eliminate it being a setting issue.
2012-05-23T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stueng	 they have a .dmrc file? if so check whats in it also.
2012-05-23T20:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		what a long prompt. ;)
2012-05-23T20:59:00.000Z	stueng	Dr_Willis	cat .dmrc - no file
2012-05-23T21:00:00.000Z	stueng		I deleted .Xauth*
2012-05-23T21:00:00.000Z	stueng		rebootoing and trying again
2012-05-23T21:01:00.000Z	stueng	Dr_Willis	deleting .Xauth* fixed hte problem
2012-05-23T21:01:00.000Z	stueng		this is weird its sluggish when launched as a normal user
2012-05-23T21:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stueng	 thats a main X security file . so that makes sence
