2008-07-07T07:45:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	is the volume turned up, is the sound card detected, is the driver installed, what applications have you used to test sound
2008-07-07T07:47:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	analog or digital output
2008-07-07T07:47:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	find out
2008-07-07T07:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	look at the plug
2008-07-07T07:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	do you have a sound card in your computer as well
2008-07-07T07:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	ubuntu is probably getting confused at having 2 sound cards then, and is trying to use the wrong one.  Go to the system menu under sounds and play around with mixer choices and stuff there until you get a configuration that works
2008-07-07T07:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	that doesnt mean anything
2008-07-07T07:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	then maybe ubuntu doesn't support your usb sound card.  Try googling for specific information about the usb sound card and speakers you are using
2008-07-07T07:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	i've told you want to do, i have nothing else to add. sorry
2008-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	you said earlier it was
2008-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	connected through usb = usb sound card
2008-07-07T08:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	is it optical, digital coax, or a noraml headphone like jack
2008-07-07T08:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	i have no idea
2008-07-07T08:40:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Guest29846	i've told you numerous times already. I have no idea
