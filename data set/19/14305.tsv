2004-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	whiprush		I think alienware offers raid on a laptop
2004-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	i'm sure that gets great battery life
2004-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	whiprush	subterrific	heh, "10 battery modules, expect life, 10 minutes".
2004-10-03T07:24:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	they should call them "Tether"
2004-10-03T07:26:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	totally, what is with the giant laptops these days. it seems silly to me. i'd rather treat a laptop as a terminal to a powerful desktop
2004-10-03T07:31:00.000Z	whiprush	subterrific	I'm pricing out a fuji laptop at the moment, it's teeny.
2004-10-03T07:33:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	yeah, its a rip off though. its like $300 worth of hardware for $3K
2004-10-04T08:18:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	me too, its slick
2004-10-04T08:23:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	dmix should work fine if you change gstreamer to use ALSA
2004-10-04T08:25:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	my guess is that you've got gstreamer set to use OSS. thats the default for some crazy reason
2004-10-04T08:26:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	me too
2004-10-04T08:26:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	i have totem-xine too...hmm
2004-10-04T08:27:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	yeah, its at work though and we just moved offices today and the new office doesn't have internet yet, so i can't give you my .asoundrc
2004-10-04T08:29:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	what cpu?
2004-10-04T08:34:00.000Z	whiprush	subterrific	probably best to just post it to the list then
2004-10-04T08:34:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	well i've already helped like 10 people with ALSA on irc
2004-10-04T08:55:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	can you give it a try too? http://subterrific.net/~jason/intel8x0_asoundrc
2004-10-04T08:57:00.000Z	whiprush	subterrific	works for me
2004-10-04T09:39:00.000Z	subterrific	whiprush	yeah seems find is totally hosed in firefox PR
