2006-11-16T06:10:00.000Z	rolando		hola
2006-11-16T06:10:00.000Z	rolando		is it possible to set a different language for a different account in my pc?
2006-11-16T06:11:00.000Z	rolando		under system-languages it sets a global language so things like FF or amule are in the same language in different accounts
2006-11-16T06:11:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	even
2006-11-16T06:12:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	or just different language settings for each account
2006-11-16T06:13:00.000Z	rolando	ailean	system-languages
2006-11-16T06:14:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	select the languages you want to be supported
2006-11-16T06:15:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	then on the login screen, you can select which language to use for each user
2006-11-16T06:18:00.000Z	rolando	ailean	that is easier said than done, i selected and installed then languages i want to be supported, but then dont know where to chose what language for what user
2006-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	you choose it when they are logging in, i believe
2006-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	rolando	ailean	ok, but i think nie, ill keep looking through the menus, but im starting to think that it not possible
2006-11-16T06:20:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	yes, it is
2006-11-16T06:20:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	i've done it
2006-11-16T06:20:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	just as you can select whether you want Gnome or KDE when logging in, you can select language
2006-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	rolando	ailean	maybe, are you using gdm or kdm?
2006-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	gdm
2006-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	ailean	rolando	you looking to change to lithuanian or something?
