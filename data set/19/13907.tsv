2005-01-01T14:30:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs	how did you get this idea ? ubuntu is debian under the hood....with a lot improvements debian will see way later....ever tried a custom install of ubuntu ?
2005-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs	you get a slim (200mb) base system, nothing else, then you can add your server stuff
2005-01-05T16:48:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs	it doesnt matter its an assumption that tries to scare ppl
2005-01-05T16:48:00.000Z	Ribs	ogra	You should know better, however. Crackers != Hackers.
2005-01-05T16:49:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs	no matter how you name them in a unproven statement that is fud in my eyes
