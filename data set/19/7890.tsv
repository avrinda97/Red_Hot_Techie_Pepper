2010-05-05T01:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		wondering if anyone has a fix for this bug found in denyhosts - http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2898723&group_id=131204&atid=720419
2010-05-05T01:23:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	the chances of someone knowing what that is with no relational data is slim, even on here
2010-05-05T01:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	huh, did you even look at the link, not saying you didn't but there is plenty of information on their explaining about the bug, which has to do with the denyhosts resyliant downloads
2010-05-05T01:24:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	ok, don't take my constructive criticism... just mock it and hang out waiting. GL!
2010-05-05T01:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	I guess you didnt understand me and got the wrong idea...
2010-05-05T01:28:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	so are you saying you have upgraded to python 2.6 and modified your sync.py (line 47 to read timestamp = long(timestamp.strip())? and are still seeing what?
2010-05-05T01:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	in lucid that line is already changed I dont have to do anything and I still get that and yes 2.6 is installed by default
2010-05-05T01:32:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	did you compile from source? 2.6 of denyhosts? or are you using it from repo's?
2010-05-05T01:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	repo wouldn't think that would make that much of a difference
2010-05-05T01:34:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	maybe yes or no, I would recommend compile from source though... possibly running "wireshark" or another such util to sniff while tailing your output log, see what corresponds for errors and network access
2010-05-05T01:35:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	sorry, wireshark = ethereal
2010-05-05T01:38:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	I would go that route on the basis that you don't know what is the problem... process of elimination, just on a ps. Why not just have a batch that adds people to the hosts.deny(colleague just suggested)
2010-05-05T01:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	I am making use of tcp wrappers hosts.deny and allow, however another front of protection is always welcomed even if it may not be necessary, will  check that rout out
2010-05-05T01:42:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	ok, well I would certainly suggest poking around with ethereal(should be simple enough) from the basis of your experience you prolly read this better then me. that would allow you to eliminate some things....
2010-05-05T01:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	since whereon the subject of sniffers I've looking into snort would you advise me otherwise to stick with wireshark (considering havent looked at what it offers) or something better
2010-05-05T01:45:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	I suggest wireshark(which is just a graphical front) as its derived from ethereal and provides you with EVERYTHING... so its extremely thorough for sniffing your packets, and being native usually gets my vote. Nice to have in your arsenal.
2010-05-05T01:47:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	will go with what you said since im non-the-wiser and you said graphical hope it does contain the ability for command line and is much easier than snort to install specially from source :s
2010-05-05T01:49:00.000Z	tyler_d	Pirate_Hunter	and to back up the point on source and compiling, alot of things from source don't have versioning, so the check is simply to meet the dependance (has python) or (has kernel) then grabs generic and installs... when compiling you are actually using and referencing system specifics ie. Python v. 2.6 and Kernel blah blah blah..... Just my thoughts though, Good Luck :)
2010-05-05T01:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	tyler_d	no problem will definitely take a look at wireshark and make some comparison, on the note for denyhosts will check out the source and compile it under vm first see if I can note down any problems, thanks for the info
