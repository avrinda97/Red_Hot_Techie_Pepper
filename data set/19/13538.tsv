2005-04-27T16:01:00.000Z	goron		I installed ubuntu, but I heard last weekm that after you installed it, you will only get bug-fixes. I want the equivalent of Debian Unstable. Does Ubuntu has that?
2005-04-27T12:38:00.000Z	goron		How's Ubuntu update policy? Thus will I get updates for ever when I install Hoary? Or will I only get the bugfixes of that release?
2005-04-27T12:40:00.000Z	ups	goron	only security fixes and critical bug fixes i believe, no new stuff
2005-04-27T12:40:00.000Z	goron	ups	So, there's no Unstable equivalent?
2005-04-27T12:41:00.000Z	ups	goron	there is - breezy
2005-04-27T12:42:00.000Z	goron	ups	So with breezy I don't ever need to change /etc/apt/sources.lst?
2005-04-27T12:43:00.000Z	goron	ups	Or should I change it every six months?
2005-04-27T12:43:00.000Z	ups	goron	you do, breezy will stabilize in 6 months
2005-04-27T12:43:00.000Z	ups	goron	yes
2005-04-27T12:44:00.000Z	goron	ups	Well, in that case, I will deinstall Ubuntu again. I don't want to spend time with such useless details. And probably updating from one arch to another will kill the system anyway.
2005-04-27T12:44:00.000Z	ups	goron	what useless details?
2005-04-27T12:45:00.000Z	ups	goron	and you're only upgrading from one version of ubuntu to another, so why would that kill anything?
2005-04-27T12:47:00.000Z	goron	ups	Well, it's the same as upgrading from testing to unstable in Debian. Now, imagine you don't update for a year. Chanches are pretty high some stuff will break. And I don't think Ubuntu knowledge is that high (compared to Debian). Also, I am not a real desktop user, more a workstation like user.
2005-04-27T12:48:00.000Z	ups	goron	i believe the official support lasts for 18 months for each release, so you dont really need to update that much if it's an issue. you'll still get security fixes.
2005-04-27T12:49:00.000Z	ups	goron	as for knowledge, you should know that a lot of ubuntu devs are debian devs too
2005-04-27T12:50:00.000Z	goron	ups	Yeah, I understood that company buys a lot of developers from Debian.
2005-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	ups	goron	i dont think it's wise to believe absolutely everything that appears on slashdot ;)
2005-04-27T12:52:00.000Z	ups	goron	ubuntu just synced from debian sid, and now they'll apply some polish and fixes, add some cool features and release the next version :)
2005-04-27T12:53:00.000Z	ups	goron	ofcourse it's not as simple as i try to make it sound ;)
