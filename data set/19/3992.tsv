2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	gm|lap		lemme have a look
2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	gm|lap		what does it try to remove?
2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	gm|lap		erm, sudo apt-get remove evolution
2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	gm|lap		that is
2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	gm|lap		but yeah
2009-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	gm|lap		oh, right
2009-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	gm|lap		all i have is evolution-alarm-notify
2009-04-25T06:56:00.000Z	gm|lap		i have desktop 8.10 i386
2009-04-25T06:56:00.000Z	gm|lap		(despite this being a 64-bit arch, i just don't have the x86-64 version)
2009-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	gm|lap		/etc/rc2.d is probably the one you want to have a look into
2009-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	mikechelen	gm|lap	is there a gui editor for that?
2009-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	gm|lap		if there's an S??evolution-whatever, change the S to a K
2009-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	gm|lap	mikechelen	there might be, they're called runlevels
2009-04-25T06:59:00.000Z	gm|lap		System -> Administration -> Services, perhaps?
2009-04-25T06:59:00.000Z	gm|lap		i know
2009-04-25T07:00:00.000Z	gm|lap	mikechelen	/ storrgie: System -> Administration -> Services, perhaps?
2009-04-25T07:01:00.000Z	mikechelen	gm|lap	that has a bunch, yet does not include common services such as tor and mpd
2009-04-25T07:02:00.000Z	mikechelen		!offtopic | vapor
2009-04-25T07:02:00.000Z	gm|lap	mikechelen	looks like they half-assed the services thing... i remember mandrake 8.1 / redhat 7.1 in about 2003 or 2004 or something
