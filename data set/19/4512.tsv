2009-06-04T00:06:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	Are you copying from your mounted root partition?
2009-06-04T00:07:00.000Z	deany	ferret_	yes.  mounted and running
2009-06-04T00:07:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	That's not a particularly good idea.  It'd be better to boot from an optical disc and do the copy then.
2009-06-04T00:09:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	If not, the safest way to copy a partition is to do something like: mkdir /mnt/root; mount -o bind / /mnt/root; cp -av /mnt/root/* /mnt/dest/
2009-06-04T00:09:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	And if possible, close down things that might write to the disk... otherwise you may end up with inconsistencies in those programs' data
2009-06-04T00:09:00.000Z	deany	ferret_	a simple cp -av will duplicate it?
2009-06-04T00:10:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	coreutils 7+'s cp -a correctly duplicates all kind of files (and does a jolly good job with sparse files)
2009-06-04T00:10:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	Before version 7 it would always expand sparse files
2009-06-04T00:11:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	But you probably don't have any sparse files, in any case
2009-06-04T00:14:00.000Z	deany	ferret_	id have to install grub on it too?
2009-06-04T00:15:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	This would just copy your root partition.  If you want to copy your boot partition also, do it in a separate step
2009-06-04T00:15:00.000Z	deany	ferret_	its all the same partition
2009-06-04T00:15:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	But yes, if it's a new hard disk replacing the old one, you will need to install grub on it
2009-06-04T00:15:00.000Z	deany	ferret_	so its good to go after that.
2009-06-04T00:17:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	The exact steps you need to use to restore grub differs  depending on whether you plan to move the new hard disk to the old hard disk's slot afterwards
2009-06-04T00:17:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	If you're not going to do that, the instructions above should be fine
2009-06-04T00:17:00.000Z	deany	ferret_	I will be
2009-06-04T00:20:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	OK, the important thing to understand is that when you install grub, you need to tell it two things; where to write the bootloader stage1 right now, and where to tell that stage1 to look for more files when it's actually booting
2009-06-04T00:21:00.000Z	ferret_	deany	The second thing is the ''root'' command in the grub shell, so if your old disk is (hd0) and your new disk is (hd1) you'll probably want: root (hd0,0).  The first thing (where to write the bootloader stage1) is the ''setup'' command in the grub shell, and in the example I am giving you would say: setup (hd1)
