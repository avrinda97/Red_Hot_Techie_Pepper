2005-08-04T08:43:00.000Z	MartenH		I need an GUI ftp client with support for SSL, any suggestions?
2005-08-04T08:45:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 JFTP from www.jmethods.com
2005-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	ok I'll look at that
2005-08-04T08:48:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 it requires java, but its the only SSL enabled ftp client i've found with a GUI
2005-08-04T08:49:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	might have to stick to windows for that then :/ darn
2005-08-04T08:50:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 nah, JFTP works, and you have the PFTP which uses ncurses
2005-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 ncurses is the blocky - "DOS gui" thingie
2005-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	ah ic
2005-08-04T08:52:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 well, i've been thinking of developing a FTP client just for fun, so i think i'll make a gui-ssl client now
2005-08-04T08:56:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	If you finish it let me know! I'd be dying to get hold of it! And if you need assitance testing of feedback on GUI design etc let me know. Sadly I'm not very versed in C/C++
2005-08-04T08:57:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 sure will :)
2005-08-04T08:58:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 but did you try JFTP ?
2005-08-04T08:59:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	no not yet. busy doing other things right now, just collecting the intel for later :) Tonigt perhaps
2005-08-08T15:10:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 gftp seem to have ssl support if you compile it from source (not apt-get it)
2005-08-08T15:11:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	really? Interesting! I don't know if I dare get into combiling again, just went trhrough hell compiling a driver.. did manage to get it working in the end though =)
2005-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 compiling drivers is way different from just compiling a small app ;)
2005-08-08T15:13:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	have you tried it? (gftp with ssl i mean)
2005-08-08T15:13:00.000Z	kemik	MartenH	 im going to now, either gftp or iglooftp
2005-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	MartenH	kemik	ok, then I'll let you play guineepig and you can report back to me when you're done =)
