2007-09-10T14:39:00.000Z	Linux4909		automatix did some good for me. it helped me find out it's not good. and i would not have learned that if it werent for the install of this IRC which lead me to you all.
2007-09-10T14:39:00.000Z	Linux4909		thanx
2007-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	Linux4909		why would you regret that?
2007-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	Linux4909		i gave mines about 7GB
2007-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	yeah, if you have installed automatix already, but have removed it, i still think that it would be best to skip doing the download distro upgrade.
2007-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	i've learnt my lesson too :)
2007-09-10T14:51:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	how long have you been using ubuntu?
2007-09-10T15:10:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	lol.  my little sister loves the games on ubuntu.  I let her use my gutsy alpha live cd (previously feisty stable cd) to play games from time to time, she loves it
2007-09-10T15:10:00.000Z	Linux4909	penguincentral	i'm the only person using my linux.
2007-09-10T15:11:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	same with me.  even still she won't use it for everything else :(  I also get ridiculed by ignorent others because i use linux.  xp sucks
2007-09-10T15:13:00.000Z	Linux4909	penguincentral	they may see it as an inconvenience and not understand why we us it because there are more steps to do ing simple things, but they dont know we like the whole learning part of it. adn just being on a computer for more than just email and myspace is what we love
2007-09-10T15:17:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	with gutsy, yes
2007-09-10T15:27:00.000Z	penguincentral	Linux4909	try gparted.  run these commands: sudo apt-get install gparted, then to run it sudo gparted (it needs root access).  It might work, it might not, then otherwise there is partition magic
