2008-02-15T04:20:00.000Z	highvolt		Can anyone help me get the progress-bar for boot to show up? My screen has no output between grub and GDM
2008-02-15T04:21:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	that might have something to do with /boot/grub/menu.list
2008-02-15T04:22:00.000Z	highvolt	giantmidget	i added vga=795 (795 is for my color depth and resolution) and it does not work
2008-02-15T04:22:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	exactly
2008-02-15T04:23:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	ive had problems with that, too. just remove the vga setting
2008-02-15T04:23:00.000Z	highvolt	giantmidget	the vga setting wasnt there. i added it, according to a thread on the forums
2008-02-15T04:23:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	i understand what you say, but vga has not worked for me either in gutsy
2008-02-15T04:24:00.000Z	highvolt	giantmidget	have you managed to get it to work?
2008-02-15T04:24:00.000Z	highvolt		heres a link to the thread i used http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=584205&page=3
2008-02-15T04:24:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	every time i try to specify a vga setting, my tty's are all garbled and theres no feedback until gdm steps in
2008-02-15T04:25:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	i couldnt figure it out, no. but im sure thats causing your problem
2008-02-15T04:25:00.000Z	highvolt	giantmidget	yeah. im sort of determined to get this to work. i wish it was more straightforward
2008-02-15T04:26:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	i tried posting on the forums once, but nobody gave me any answers...
2008-02-15T04:26:00.000Z	highvolt	giantmidget	hmm...i found another post about editing yet another thing in the menu.lst so ill try that out
2008-02-15T04:27:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	can you give me the address please?
2008-02-15T04:27:00.000Z	giantmidget	highvolt	earlier with gutsy i was hoping its a kernel problem, but updates didnt solve it
2008-02-15T04:29:00.000Z	highvolt	giantmidget	i posted the link to the forum thread, but here it is again: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=584205&page=3
