2006-05-16T15:34:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	sudo apt-get install xine and then run totem - its the quickest hack I can think of
2006-05-18T16:45:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	read the message fro the bot, and please do not paste in this channel, that is what paste.ubuntu-nl.org is for
2006-05-19T05:34:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	why not install the cyrillic fonts that come with ubuntu
2006-05-19T05:35:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	first give yourself the most of everything
2006-05-19T05:36:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	well no those that don't need to be translated - you should have a look on the wiki about that
2006-05-19T05:37:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	add  the repos that the bot tells you about and then --- use System Administration Synaptic Package Manager to search for fonts or cry and then install away
2006-05-19T05:42:00.000Z	blaze	ompaul	i've selected almost all of xfonts that have "koi" in the name :D
2006-05-19T05:42:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	I am no font expert, why not join your national channel - and get into translation :)
2006-05-27T05:25:00.000Z	ompaul	blaze	^^ up a line again
