2011-04-12T14:09:00.000Z	k_sze		LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager, no?
2011-04-12T14:09:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Si.
2011-04-12T14:16:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	slaeya is not certain. However, try "sudo vgscan" -- "sudo vgchange -ay"
2011-04-12T14:17:00.000Z	k_sze	red2kic	command not found. Where are they usually?
2011-04-12T14:18:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	lvm2 -- What is this hard drive? What did you do with it?
2011-04-12T14:19:00.000Z	k_sze	red2kic	It's an upgrade process that got interrupted in a very very bad way.
2011-04-12T14:19:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Okay. How was the 9.04 installed in first place?
2011-04-12T14:20:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Alternative disc?
2011-04-12T14:20:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Use a LiveCD. Try to recover your hard drive. I hate upgrades.
2011-04-12T14:21:00.000Z	k_sze	red2kic	I *am* using the 10.10 LiveCD
2011-04-12T14:21:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Okay. You can't see your hard drive? It's usually under Places --> (Whatever HDD).
2011-04-12T14:22:00.000Z	k_sze	red2kic	it's there and it's not there: only the grub partition is there.
2011-04-12T14:23:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Install lvm2 cryptsetup
2011-04-12T14:23:00.000Z	k_sze	red2kic	is that from Ubuntu Software Center?
2011-04-12T14:24:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Open a terminal.  "sudo apt-get install lvm2 cryptsetup"
2011-04-12T14:25:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	How are you online? Get this machine an Internet, stats!
2011-04-12T14:27:00.000Z	red2kic	k_sze	Okay. I understood your situation. Meanwhile, you're stuck until we get your computer on Internet. If you don't want to, you got USB sticks around?
2011-04-12T14:29:00.000Z	k_sze	red2kic	it's not urgent. so I'll just come back when I move into a bigger house and a monitor.
