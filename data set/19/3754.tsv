2009-06-02T23:49:00.000Z	ari5av		oh good
2009-06-02T23:51:00.000Z	ari5av		jaunty, relatively new install.  audio is intel IHC7, using snd_intel8x0 as driver.  pulseaudio is installed and I have it selected.  output is through my headphones, and sound works, it's just distorted - sounds like I'm listening through a tunnel.  it sounds like I'm missing a channel
2009-06-02T23:51:00.000Z	ari5av		is there a tool I can use to plug an mp3 in and see if it's got a center channel that my audio system is ignoring?
2009-06-02T23:51:00.000Z	ari5av		because I have some stereo flacs that sound good
2009-06-02T23:51:00.000Z	ari5av		and some that aren't
2009-06-02T23:52:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	what are your settings in Gnome Sound preferences?
2009-06-02T23:52:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	you're running Ubuntu, right?
2009-06-02T23:53:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	ok, can you change the input to Alsa?
2009-06-02T23:55:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	is the sound coming from one channel on one or more apps?
2009-06-02T23:57:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	you mentioned the sound comes out from only one of the speakers, right? And is that happening with all apps or just one?
2009-06-03T00:00:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	oh, dang, I just re-read your question, and noticed I was fixated in the (missing channel part), lol
2009-06-03T00:00:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	right, is the sound distorting even with low volume?
2009-06-03T00:00:00.000Z	ari5av	chocobanana	affirmative.
2009-06-03T00:01:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	is the sound coming distorted from any app or just one or two?
2009-06-03T00:02:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	are u also using the Pulse Audio controls in the Volume manager?
2009-06-03T00:04:00.000Z	chocobanana	ari5av	I gotta go make dinner. Have a look at this in the meanwhile and see if it is of any help: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sound-solutions-for-ubuntu-904-jaunty-users.html
