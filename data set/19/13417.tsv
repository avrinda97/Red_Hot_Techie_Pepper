2012-06-13T22:14:00.000Z	blackbit		rob, are you looking for a temporary or a permanent solution to see init messages?
2012-06-13T22:14:00.000Z	blackbit		rob: there was a line to add in the grub menu
2012-06-13T22:15:00.000Z	blackbit		rob: ubuntu 12.04?

2012-06-13T22:16:00.000Z	blackbit		rob: basically, you remove 'quiet splash' from the grub menu entry of ubuntu, and then do sudo update-grub
2012-06-13T22:17:00.000Z	blackbit		rob: let me check
2012-06-13T22:18:00.000Z	blackbit		rob: menu should be in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2012-06-13T22:20:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	i think that file is generated from /etc/default/grub
2012-06-13T22:14:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	permenant
2012-06-13T22:14:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	i want to turn off the splash so i can see all the services starting
2012-06-13T22:15:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	any ideas what? :)
2012-06-13T22:15:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	yeah
2012-06-13T22:16:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	ok cool but where is the grub menu file? dont you have to use /etc/default/grub or something?
2012-06-13T22:21:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	i see all the kernel messages but i dont see any of the init messages, it's quite annoying...
2012-06-13T22:23:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	have edited that file but those parameters didnt exist there, that's where i added noquiet, nosplash and debug and then if i run grub-update i can see the changes reflected in /boot/grub/grub.conf
2012-06-13T22:25:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	correct
2012-06-13T22:32:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	this might work: http://virtual-drive.in/2012/05/20/ubuntu-12-04-text-boot/
2012-06-13T22:34:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	hooray! it works..
2012-06-13T22:36:00.000Z	rob_	blackbit	cheers
