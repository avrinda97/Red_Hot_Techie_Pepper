2006-11-27T14:32:00.000Z	gbrent		I accidently took my name off of the suddoers list and cant do any sudo commands. Any idea how to get back on it?
2006-11-27T14:32:00.000Z	gbrent		or am I screwed?
2006-11-27T14:33:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	visudo
2006-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	If you can't ssh in as root or another account that has sudo ability, you're pretty much toast...
2006-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	Advice:  Always have a back door of some sort.
2006-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	gbrent	TSWoodV	Yeah that is what I was figuring. So once I boot in recovery I use visudo to edit the suddoers file correct?
2006-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	Right.
2006-11-27T14:36:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	Yep.  Use the "visudo" command.  It'll pick the right file and handle any concurrency issues (not that you'll have any in recovery mode, however).
2006-11-27T14:43:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	What were you trying to do with these changes you've made?
2006-11-27T14:44:00.000Z	gbrent	TSWoodV	Lam_: I figured it out... the admin group looks like this: admin:x:114:  and I need to make it look like this admin:x:114:gbrent
2006-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	That's correct.
2006-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	gbrent	TSWoodV	I was trying to make me apart of the root group also or something. It was a week ago and I just left it alone for a while
2006-11-27T14:46:00.000Z	gbrent	TSWoodV	is this action also going to require the recovery console?
2006-11-27T14:46:00.000Z	gbrent	TSWoodV	can I just boot off a live cd and change it?
2006-11-27T14:46:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	You weren't far off, if you were running a distro like Fedora.  But for a sudo-based distro that typically doesn't assign a password directly to root, however, the key is the admin group in /etc/sudoers, as you now know.
2006-11-27T14:47:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	Yep.  Just mount the / filesystem (if the live distro doesn't do that for you) and fix it.
2006-11-27T14:47:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	Either a Ubuntu Live CD or Knoppix or any other live and/or recovery distro should work.
2006-11-27T14:47:00.000Z	gbrent	TSWoodV	cool thanks man. Im doing that over lunch when i get home.
2006-11-27T14:48:00.000Z	TSWoodV	gbrent	You're welcome.
