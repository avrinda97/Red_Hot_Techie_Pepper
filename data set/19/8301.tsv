2008-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	deserteagle		hello :)
2008-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	deserteagle		does anyone know why WINE keeps saying there is no configured c drive?
2008-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	deserteagle		ok
2008-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	deserteagle		but that still doesn't solve my problem
2008-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	deserteagle		:P
2008-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	deserteagle		i do
2008-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	deserteagle		yet there are still times (such as with powerpoint presentations or embedded macros) when i need office
2008-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	deserteagle		yes
2008-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	deserteagle		and thats when i get the message
2008-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	macd	deserteagle	when you removed wine, did you do it with 'apt-get remove --purge' ?
2008-05-15T09:59:00.000Z	deserteagle	macd	first i just erased drive_c
2008-05-15T09:59:00.000Z	macd	deserteagle	then do that, 'sudo apt-get remove --purge wine && sudo apt-get install wine'
2008-05-15T10:03:00.000Z	deserteagle	macd	nothing
2008-05-15T10:03:00.000Z	deserteagle	macd	it still says "You do not have a C drive, this is not good" every time i launch winecfg
2008-05-15T10:03:00.000Z	macd	deserteagle	even after issuing the command I gave you earlier?
2008-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	deserteagle	macd	yup
2008-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	macd	deserteagle	hmm, Im out of ideas then, you might try #wine if noone here knows.....
2008-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	deserteagle	macd	lol, is there like a channel for every app in linux? :P
2008-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	macd	deserteagle	ahh you see the beauty of opensource ;)
