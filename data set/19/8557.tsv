2007-03-14T06:15:00.000Z	xtknight		ah hamachi , used that before
2007-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	xtknight		!ask | Jetfighter
2007-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	 it might be better to have him change the "howmany" line to 2 (keep last 2 kernels) and run update-grub
2007-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	interesting never knew about it.  how would it affect the windows lines?
2007-03-14T06:17:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	 It didn't in my case, nor did it affect my debian lines.  It only affects the lines in the "automagically generated" section.
2007-03-14T06:17:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	ahh cool.  yeah perhaps he should check it out.  |caicai| ^^^^
2007-03-14T06:18:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	 I'm also not sure of the howmany value gets reset to "all" on the installation of a new kernel, but if it *doesn't* I keep mine at 2, so I'd have the new (potentially bad) kernel, and the old (definitely working) kernel.
2007-03-14T07:01:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	 what exactly are you doing when you write things like "!upgrade | whomever" ?
2007-03-14T07:01:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	using the bot's preset responses and directing them towards a user
2007-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	 does she need "universe" on line 32?
2007-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	i dont know, it doesnt belong on 33 tho
2007-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	looks like universe is already on line 29
2007-03-17T07:48:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	aha, she may want it on line 30, in case she ever checks out source code
2007-03-17T07:59:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	Is that Core 2 Duo problem there with all of those PCI/IDE controllers?
2007-03-17T08:00:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	it's actually not a core 2 duo problem at all, but most core 2 duo platforms just happen to use JMicron for IDE
2007-03-17T08:01:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	ah, alrighty.  I wish more retailers/manufacturers would give detailed chipset info
2007-03-17T08:12:00.000Z	xtknight	JohnPhys	or maybe they all had sata drives hooked up to the intel ich8
2007-03-17T08:13:00.000Z	JohnPhys	xtknight	...good point, I think it is a sata in that machine
