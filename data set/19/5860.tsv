2008-04-25T16:12:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	actually there is harm in that, but not in a desktop scenario I guess
2008-04-25T16:13:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	No you're going to make him doubt me :P
2008-04-25T16:15:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	do they even exist :P
2008-04-25T16:15:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	they used to >_>
2008-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	Evince does that for me
2008-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	not sure how the Ubuntu folks did that, probably using moz-plugger
2008-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	Why doesn't it do it for me :( ubuntu 8.04
2008-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	not sure, what happens when you click on a PDF?
2008-04-25T16:31:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	It just brings up the save as dialog
2008-04-25T16:31:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	I had a very delayed response there, girlfriend rang :P
2008-04-25T16:32:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	do you have Evince installed? was your system upgraded or clean-installed? did you use that same home directory with other systems/versions?
2008-04-25T16:33:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	when in doubt, make the clean-user test, make a new clean Ubuntu user with an empty home, log into it and see how it behaves
2008-04-25T16:33:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	Was upgraded unfortunately but I keep it pretty clean. Although it being due to the upgrade makes sense.
2008-04-25T16:34:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	could be mozilla-plugin related settings in your home dir, do the clean user test
2008-04-25T16:35:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	I'll worry about it later cause I should be drawing a java class diagram for uni. But test user sounds like a good idea.
2008-04-25T16:35:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	have fun diagraming... what are you using for that btw?
2008-04-25T16:36:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	Nothing as of yet... I was in the middle of asking if anybody knew of any good software for UML diagrams... I usually just draw them in GIMP or something stupid like that.
2008-04-25T16:36:00.000Z	ifireball	Boredom_inc	try dia
2008-04-25T16:37:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	ifireball	Thanks
