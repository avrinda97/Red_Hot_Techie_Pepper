2006-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	in irc you can type the first couple letters of a persons name and hit tab (afaik)
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	jordan	Mordof	thanks
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	jordan	Mordof	first time ever
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	in that case, welcome to the wonderful world of irc :)
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	jordan	Mordof	thanks
2006-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	what is your problem exactly?
2006-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	gmail works perfect on dialup, just loads slower..
2006-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	jordan	Mordof	it used to work, like last week, just this weekend and today it wont, but it did in links, a text mode browser, just not in firefox, should I reinstall firefox?
2006-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	worth a shot
2006-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	jordan	Mordof	ok, I'll try
2006-02-19T10:09:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	if it works for everything but firefox, it would seem to be that firefox isnt working properly.. but i dunno it could be something else. ruling out possibilites is the only way to solving a problem though ;)
2006-02-19T10:09:00.000Z	jordan	Mordof	yeah, I will reinstall with synaptic now
2006-02-19T10:19:00.000Z	Mordof	jordan	i know what you mean... i stopped using linux while i was on dialup
