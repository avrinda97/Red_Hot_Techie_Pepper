2012-01-04T09:39:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		like from 10.04 to 11.10
2012-01-04T09:39:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		right
2012-01-04T09:40:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		but if i were to backup my fstab
2012-01-04T09:40:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		could i copy it into a fresh installation?
2012-01-04T09:40:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		well, mostly i need to go from 64bit to 32
2012-01-04T09:40:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		the upgrade is rather irrelevant
2012-01-04T09:41:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		hmm
2012-01-04T09:41:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		this is for a media server
2012-01-04T09:41:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		so i really am trying to avoid changing my 4 tb of data
2012-01-04T09:43:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon		is there a way to go from 11.4 64bit to 11.10 32bit without changing the partitions?
2012-01-04T09:43:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	no
2012-01-04T09:43:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	no
2012-01-04T09:44:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	you need to re-install
2012-01-04T09:45:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	why would you have to change the partition size ?
2012-01-04T09:45:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	it's just a re-install, nothing more
2012-01-04T09:46:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon	ikonia	thats what I was asking. I have an fstab that is setup to automatically merge some drives, took me a while to get that working. and if i could avoid that work again after a re-install, that would be swell
2012-01-04T09:47:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	that will need to be re-written as part of the install
2012-01-04T09:47:00.000Z	ikonia	eyeothemastodon	just take a backup copy of the fstab and use the parts you can on the new install
2012-01-04T09:47:00.000Z	eyeothemastodon	ikonia	thank you, thats the confirmation i was looking for
