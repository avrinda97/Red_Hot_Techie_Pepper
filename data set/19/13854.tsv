2005-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	Aoi		I have 3 lan cards, eth0 eth1 (network) are sis and eth2 (internet) via. I had setup only eth2, how can I bring up eth0 and eth1? (I would like to setup a gateway using firestarter and I failed ifconfig)
2005-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	Aoi		hi ya, I can't figure out how to setup my home network. I would like ubuntu act as my internet gateway for another 2 boxes. I have eth0 internet (sis), eth1(sis) and eth2(via). witch ip I need to set on eth1?
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Aoi		Blacwell what do you think use a nat router and setup firestarter?
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	Use a class C adress, like 192.168.1.1
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	how can I do it? eth1 192.0.0.1 and my windowz box 192.0.0.2 ? (crossed over)
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	you need the 192.168 part, but otherwise ok
2005-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	I can't figure out, ipconfig eth1 192.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 ? then I need to forward ipv4 ?
2005-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward i believe
2005-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	oh just only it? wow nat rlz lol
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	Are you sure you want nat and not just ip masq?
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	bring eth1 up first
2005-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	eth1 up but not active let me test
2005-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	hmm
2005-01-02T17:22:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	yeah, stable releases of software does not go in stable ubuntu
2005-01-02T17:24:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	yeah weird world lol. Just a question, do you know where the hell ubuntu is chaging  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 0 as default?
2005-01-02T17:24:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	/proc is the kernel filesystem... it doesn't remember settings over reboots
2005-01-02T17:25:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	witch script ubuntu load by first?
2005-01-02T17:25:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi	I'm not sure where ubuntu wants the commands to be run at boot to be placed
2005-01-02T17:28:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac	hm, I'll check out kernel, thanks by the way
