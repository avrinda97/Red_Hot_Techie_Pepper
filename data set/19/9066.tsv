2007-01-02T11:53:00.000Z	peanutb		does anyone know why a dual processor computer would appear as only haveing one in bot windows and ubuntu?
2007-01-02T11:55:00.000Z	peanutb		h3ris, its not a core issue, its two processors.
2007-01-02T11:55:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	ok, are there two processors recognized in the boot messages?
2007-01-02T11:56:00.000Z	peanutb		yes, it says it has two p3 processors, at 550 MHZ
2007-01-02T11:57:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	also, do "uname -a" and look for "SMP" in the middle
2007-01-02T11:59:00.000Z	peanutb	doviende	nope nothing like that, it says it has a Seimens Multiprocessor Interrupt Controller, does that have anything to do with it?
2007-01-02T11:59:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	do "uname -a" and paste it here
2007-01-02T11:59:00.000Z	peanutb	doviende	in gnome device manager
2007-01-02T11:59:00.000Z	peanutb		Linux p3-dual 2.6.15-26-386 #1 PREEMPT Thu Aug 3 02:52:00 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
2007-01-02T12:00:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	ok, your kernel can't do multiprocessors
2007-01-02T12:00:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	you need to upgrade
2007-01-02T12:00:00.000Z	peanutb	doviende	how do i ?
2007-01-02T12:00:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	are you on dapper?
2007-01-02T12:00:00.000Z	peanutb		yes
2007-01-02T12:00:00.000Z	doviende		anyone know which dapper kernel has SMP?
2007-01-02T12:01:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	you can do "aptitude search linux-image" to find which kernel packages are available
2007-01-02T12:01:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	and then "sudo aptitude install linux-image-whatev-12345" once you decide on one to install
2007-01-02T12:02:00.000Z	peanutb	doviende	thanks
2007-01-02T12:02:00.000Z	doviende	peanutb	np
