2008-01-25T04:06:00.000Z	ThipThip		Sorry, I meant What causes a partition to or not to be listed with the command ls /dev/disk/by-uuid -alh?
2008-01-25T04:07:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  blkid does not list the partition in question.
2008-01-25T04:07:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  sure does.  About 270GB worth.
2008-01-25T04:09:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  I cannot get to it.  I tried to change the permissions on it, not realizing that I needed to do that in fstab.
2008-01-25T04:10:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  It is sata.
2008-01-25T04:11:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  No.  It is one of two drives.  The drive has two partitions, the smaller of which is my linux filesystem, which I'm using right now.
2008-01-25T04:13:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  precisely.
2008-01-25T04:14:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi: Failed to access '/dev/disk/by-uuid/621C7C841C7C554F': No such file or directory
2008-01-25T04:16:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  Where does a uuid come from?
2008-01-25T04:17:00.000Z	ThipThip		scunizi:  What does mount -a do?  I tried commenting it out but mount -a doesn't do anything.
2008-01-25T04:18:00.000Z	benanzo	ThipThip	'mount -a' will mount everything listed in /etc/fstab
2008-01-25T04:55:00.000Z	ThipThip	benanzo	 I made the mistake of logging in as root and trying to change the permissions on an NTFS permission instead of using fstab.  Now that partition will not mount.  What can I do?
2008-01-25T04:56:00.000Z	benanzo	ThipThip	hang on just a sec
2008-01-25T04:58:00.000Z	benanzo	ThipThip	you need to install 'ntfsprogs' and run 'ntfsfix /dev/sdaX' to fix the permissions corruption
2008-01-25T05:00:00.000Z	ThipThip	benanzo	 Mounting volume... Failed to startup volume : Invalid argument
2008-01-25T05:01:00.000Z	benanzo	ThipThip	this isn't really an NTFS problem then.  You have a corrupted filesystem.
2008-01-25T05:01:00.000Z	ThipThip	benanzo	 How can this be?  I was using this drive all day today?  It wasn't until I tried to change the permissions that this started.
2008-01-25T05:03:00.000Z	ThipThip	benanzo	 Are you telling me that simply trying to change the permissions on a partition can corrupt the entire partition?!
2008-01-25T05:04:00.000Z	benanzo	ThipThip	it really depends on what happened, how clean the filesystem was to begin with and how old the disk is, but yes
