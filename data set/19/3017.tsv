2009-11-15T03:32:00.000Z	eatloaf		my sendmail went bust during the upgrade to 9.10. can someone help?
2009-11-15T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2009-11-15T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	does it work with the maintainer's /etc/mail?
2009-11-15T03:34:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	sorry, what do you mean?
2009-11-15T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	I don't think I've ever installed sendmail, but I presume like most packages it has a default config that gives you some sort of basic setup.  If that's true of sendmail, did it work before you used your /etc/mail?
2009-11-15T03:39:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	i think the sendmail is fine. i'm not sure how to evaluate it but seemed ok.  it's getting it to forward local mail to my gmail account with domain masquerading that's the tricky part.
2009-11-15T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	you might want to try the #sendmail channel to see if there were some configuration changes as well
2009-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	ocean_: thanks. so mail.log shows this:Nov 14 14:40:16 monstr sendmail[23439]: nAEMdmbg023438: SYSERR(root): hash map "authinfo": unsafe map file /etc/mail/auth/client-info.db: Permission denied
2009-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	that just means the old file had the uid that mysql now has
2009-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	have any idea who should own authinfo.db ? root?
2009-11-15T03:45:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	nope, you don't have your old /etc/passwd?
2009-11-15T03:47:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	i seem to not have an old /etc/passwd.
2009-11-15T03:51:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	don't know.  What user does sendmail run as?
2009-11-15T03:55:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	you may use « find »
2009-11-15T03:55:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	the #sendmail channel could probably tell you exactly what you need to do if you give them your error
2009-11-15T03:56:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	use find and with -exec and chown
2009-11-15T03:56:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	thanks. i'll fix the permissions and move there. can you give an example?
2009-11-15T03:58:00.000Z	jrib	eatloaf	for example: find /some/directory -user olduser -exec chown newguy '{}' \;     (you should run the command without -exec first to make sure it doesn't do something stupid)
2009-11-15T03:59:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	TY
