2008-09-07T22:11:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		Is it possible to remove orphaned packages that were only installed due to being dependancies for another package, which has now been removed anyway, with APT?
2008-09-07T22:11:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		Like emerge --depclean
2008-09-07T22:11:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	apt-get autoremove
2008-09-07T22:12:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	danbh_intrepid	Yay, thank you!
2008-09-07T22:12:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	works for anything installed after the initial install
2008-09-07T22:12:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		Hmm...
2008-09-07T22:12:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		That ddin't work :-(
2008-09-07T22:13:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		Though I may have installed them with aptitude or synaptic
2008-09-07T22:13:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	what are you running, vanilla ubuntu?
2008-09-07T22:13:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	danbh_intrepid	xubuntu with ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop installed
2008-09-07T22:14:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	wow, thats everything.  go for gtkorphan
2008-09-07T22:15:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		﻿ danbh_intrepid: cheers
2008-09-07T22:15:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		﻿ danbh_intrepid: I only seem to have 2 orphaned packages, even though I removed ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop.
2008-09-07T22:16:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	you need to understand how to use gtkorphan, and be careful
2008-09-07T22:16:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		ah k
2008-09-07T22:17:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	there is an option that you need to check, but once you check that, it lets you removing anything and everything
2008-09-07T22:18:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre	danbh_intrepid	I think I'll do a fresh install - would it be sane to copy over /var/cache/apt/archives/* over?
2008-09-07T22:18:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirre		And will that probably contain every package I've ever downloaded, or will it only contain some?
2008-09-07T22:19:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	deepfriedsquirre	maybe, I don't know, what are you trying to get to?  xubuntu?
