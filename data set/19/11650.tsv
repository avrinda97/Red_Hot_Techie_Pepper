2005-12-15T11:22:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	sudo is an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a nutshell.
2005-12-15T11:24:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	rhymes with maneudo, the weird boy band from the early 90s
2005-12-15T11:24:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	what's the problem
2005-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	coz	shaggydoo	I was wondering if anyone has tried installing cinelerra
2005-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	elaborate.
2005-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	what are the errors? they're usually not program-specific
2005-12-15T11:28:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	use apt-get to install those libs
2005-12-15T11:29:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	name one of the libs
2005-12-15T11:30:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	make sure you have the universe respository if you are looking for other libs
2005-12-15T11:43:00.000Z	coz	shaggydoo	I understand your concern but if  you don't download things outside of synaptic how will you learn to fix problems?
2005-12-15T11:43:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	I mean, for example, xmms is available in synaptic which will download + install, no hassle (that's the point of synaptic)
2005-12-15T11:44:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	but if you need to build some sort of third party driver or some software unavailable in synaptic, you go and download it.
2005-12-15T11:48:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	doesn't matter. he'll rejoin and learn to pastebin from now on
2005-12-15T11:57:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	did you try to install it with alien?
2005-12-15T11:57:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	sudo apt-get install alien
2005-12-15T11:58:00.000Z	shaggydoo	coz	use alien on the RPM package, it'll make a DEB file, use dpkg -i on the new deb file
