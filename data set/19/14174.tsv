2005-04-05T10:24:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	how did you manage to get into this state?
2005-04-05T10:25:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	i.e. what did you change ?
2005-04-05T10:26:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	the system doesnt reboot itself, despit hardware errors
2005-04-05T10:27:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	you must have done something to cause that....
2005-04-05T10:27:00.000Z	jack__	ogra	I came back after locking the screen, and the resolution was weird, but then I unlocked it
2005-04-05T10:28:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	what did you type there ?
2005-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	that really sounds like a HW issue, is your disk full or did the system overheat ? is it a desktop or a laptop ?
2005-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	anything WAS wrong if yur system rebooted without you telling it
2005-04-05T10:31:00.000Z	ogra	jack__	lets find the reason and we can solve the prob
