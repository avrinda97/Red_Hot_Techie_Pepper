2007-08-30T11:31:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	Thanks
2007-09-03T07:21:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	I just use the gnome system monitor applet;
2007-09-03T07:21:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	Where's that at?
2007-09-03T07:21:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	it has a quick link to the system monitor as well. Right click panel, add to panel
2007-09-04T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	for feisty, you can add  the deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu fiesty-commercial main repo and download it
2007-09-04T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	the commercial repo has vmware 1.0.3 available, that's what I'm using
2007-09-04T09:28:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	So I just apt-get install vmware once I put the commercial repo's in my sources?
2007-09-04T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	yes
2007-09-04T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	vmware-server I believe is the package name
2007-09-04T09:29:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	IndyLucian: Thanks
2007-09-04T10:01:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	Not in mine.. weird
2007-09-04T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	maybe it uses both, that's the syntax I've been using long time now
2007-09-06T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	right click the iso, and select burn
2007-09-06T11:26:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	It's a daa file
2007-09-06T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	k3b is the most accomplished cd burner, check that one out
2007-09-06T11:26:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	Is that for KDE?
2007-09-06T11:27:00.000Z	nickrud	z0rz	uses kde libs, but runs fine in gnome. Don't let on, but most gnomer's have it installed
2007-09-06T11:28:00.000Z	z0rz	nickrud	K.. thanks
