2010-06-16T10:33:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 doesn't sound like the ping command is what you are looking for
2010-06-16T10:34:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 this is one computer you want to manipulate, correct>
2010-06-16T10:36:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 aha, you have serverA with a connection to the internet and serverB that wants to connect directly to serverA and access the internet?
2010-06-16T10:36:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 follow the above link. that require iptables rules
2010-06-16T10:37:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 typically you'll plug your laptop into a router/switch and dhcp will give you an address
2010-06-16T10:38:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 in the situation you describe you need to manually set serverB's IP address and route
2010-06-16T10:39:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 the fix is simple.  you just need to set an iptables jump route for the serverB computer. google, or firestarter can help you make those configs. in reality it is a one line iptables command
2010-06-16T10:40:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 the default gw on serverB is the the same default gw that server1 has
2010-06-16T10:42:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 I don't have the command handy. what I am saying is you need to make an iptable rule that forwards traffic from the same network you serverB is on to the default gw on serverA
2010-06-16T10:43:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 you probably need to add the route also. google will help you, I can't
2010-06-16T10:45:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 you must setup an iptables rule on serverA to forward traffic to the default gateway from serverB's network
2010-06-16T10:45:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 iptables is beyon the scope of my help here
2010-06-16T10:46:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 but you should be able to google up a solution
2010-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 did you check your /var/log/samba/ logs?
2010-06-16T10:55:00.000Z	AAA	stupidnics	 you mentioned slave computers, I assumed those are samba shares?
