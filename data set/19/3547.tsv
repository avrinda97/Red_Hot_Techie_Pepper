2009-07-21T21:50:00.000Z	SealV	rob____	looks like a driver issue, are you using restricted?
2009-07-21T21:50:00.000Z	SealV	rob____	like nvidia or ati?
2009-07-21T21:51:00.000Z	SealV	rob____	try turning those off, and operating either on an earlier driver or the default driver
2009-07-21T21:52:00.000Z	SealV	rob____	 turning off the restricted drivers should get you back to the default included driver
2009-07-21T21:55:00.000Z	SealV	rob____	go to system>>administration>>hardware drivers
