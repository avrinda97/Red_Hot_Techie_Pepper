2009-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	tsrk		uh
2009-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	tsrk		with less ram wouldn't you want more swap?
2009-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	well sometimes that'strue
2009-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	if you don't have enough disk space swap won't help
2009-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	tsrk	booksbuggy	but usually ram runs out before disk :P
2009-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	swap space can't be substituted completely with swap because they load slower and may damage i think
2009-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	i am running this system off 256 rams :P
2009-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	tsrk	booksbuggy	"swap space can't be substituted completely with swap because they load slower and may damage i think" <-- What?
2009-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	normal harddisk is not meant to be used completely for swap
2009-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	i tried before
2009-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	tsrk	booksbuggy	what do you mean completely?
2009-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	I attempted to make about 2 gb of swap before in windows
2009-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	it didn't work and i had to reinstall the system
2009-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	tsrk	booksbuggy	but that was windows
2009-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	well i have been busy with school work so i didn't try ubuntu out yet
2009-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	tsrk	booksbuggy	oh, i assumed that's what you were talking about considering the channel name :P
2009-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	i haven't used too many of windows lately
2009-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	booksbuggy	tsrk	nearly all the time i am on ubuntu
2009-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	tsrk	booksbuggy	oh
