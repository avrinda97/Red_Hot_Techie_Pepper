2009-06-06T23:40:00.000Z	Guest67592		Me, i am trying to make ubuntu use the entire external hard drive, yet when i tried it once, it wiped me external and everything went blacnk...
2009-06-06T23:41:00.000Z	Guest67592		it also wiped my internal as well
2009-06-06T23:41:00.000Z	Guest67592		yes, the full hard drive, not a partition like wubi
2009-06-06T23:43:00.000Z	Guest67592		well my internal has windows vista and full use now, and im trying to make my external just to be able to boot to an external device into ubuntu
2009-06-06T23:44:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	are you on a laptop?
2009-06-06T23:39:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	not sure what you are trying to do exactly.
2009-06-06T23:41:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	so you are trying to have the os on the external drive?
2009-06-06T23:42:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	why not install the drive internal as a slave?
2009-06-06T23:43:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	the problem you are having is the external usb is not yet loaded when grub looks for it.
2009-06-06T23:44:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	how many drives in the desktop?
2009-06-06T23:45:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	that's ok.  you can install the drive internally as a slave, so two drives in the case.   then the pc would see both drives and be able to boot from the slave drive from grub.
2009-06-06T23:47:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	ok, try this.   when you boot go into the BIOS and see if the pc will boot from usb.  if it can then maybe you can make the external drive bootable.
2009-06-06T23:48:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	if your pc is old then maybe not.  but you can remove your external drive from the case and install inside your pc as a slave, then install ubuntu on it.
2009-06-06T23:51:00.000Z	lennyf	Guest67592	ok, then you should be able to choose the external drive when you install ubuntu.  I am now wondering if the problem is vista.  I have heard that vista has issues with grub.
2009-06-06T23:53:00.000Z	Guest67592	lennyf	I am messaging you can you please respond...
