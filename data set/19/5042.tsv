2010-10-21T21:13:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK		hey everyone question, how do I dd all the data off a hard drive to an iso image?
2010-10-21T21:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 you really dont do it that way.
2010-10-21T21:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 you can use other commands/tools/ but not dd normally for that task
2010-10-21T21:13:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	I have to copy every bit of data from the drive to a file
2010-10-21T21:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 and how big  is this drive?
2010-10-21T21:13:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	60GB
2010-10-21T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 so you are going to backup a HD via dd to some 15 DVD disks?
2010-10-21T21:14:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	what are you suggesting?
2010-10-21T21:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	  use a backup tool like fsarchiver, or other tools.
2010-10-21T21:15:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	no I need it to copy the data sector-by-sector as-is to an ISO FILE
2010-10-21T21:15:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	no I need it to copy the data sector-by-sector as-is to an ISO FILE
2010-10-21T21:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	   why?
2010-10-21T21:15:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	why does it matter?
2010-10-21T21:16:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	the why really has no bearing on how to do it
2010-10-21T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 good luck then..  fromw hat i know your idea. wont work.
2010-10-21T21:16:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	Dr_Willis	I was told the command to dd the data off the drive to an ISO FILE drivedata.iso
2010-10-21T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 that will not make an iso filesystem. that will make a data dump of whatever filesystem is on the partition. it wont handle splitting it into 4gb parts either.. and how will you restore it?
2010-10-21T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	  dd wont make it an iso file. it will make a 'raw' image file of that part of the hard drive. thats not an iso file.
2011-04-17T01:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	THE_GFR|WORK	 is it even supported by cups? check cups.org?
