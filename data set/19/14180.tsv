2005-02-03T09:49:00.000Z	samurai		does anyone know how to set the default size of gnome-terminal without using a shell-wrapper
2005-02-03T09:50:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	--geometry
2005-02-03T09:51:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	gemoetry works fine if you create from another window or want a shellwrapper, but when I right click in the desktop and select open terminal it would be nice to be the right size
2005-02-03T09:52:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	ah, I see what you mean. not sure then, sorry ;)
2005-02-03T09:52:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	thanks anyway... it should be easy to do and find, but it hasn't been so far
2005-12-15T06:59:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	yep I see both
2005-12-15T07:00:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	I'm using archive.ubuntu.com
2005-12-15T07:00:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	I wasn't talking to you, but generally you don't want to be using dapper
2005-12-15T07:01:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	then you'll be perfectly ok fixing whatever problems you have yourself :)
2005-12-15T07:01:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	ie, dapper is unsupported :)
2005-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	I'll give it a try, but my question now relate to the repository
2005-12-15T07:04:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	is there a more appropriate place to ask about the dapper repositories?
2005-12-15T07:06:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	I don't mean to seem rude, but unsupported means unsupported. If you can't make it work, it isn't for you. That might seem harsh, but it's a development branch for developers, not curious users :/
2005-12-15T07:06:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	you misunderstood my question
2005-12-15T07:07:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	 you misunderstood my questions I'm just curious if archive.ubuntu.com is the proper place... I know about the unsupported nature... no need to apologize... just having a hard time finding out if the repo has changed
2005-12-15T07:07:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	like I said, I've seen no activity in weeks
2005-12-15T07:08:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	thanks for your help though
2005-12-15T07:08:00.000Z	Ng	samurai	I seriously doubt it has changed
2005-12-15T07:08:00.000Z	samurai	Ng	that was my thoughts... if nothing has been heard here then its something on my end... thats all I needed... thanks
