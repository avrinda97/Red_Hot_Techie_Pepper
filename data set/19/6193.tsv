2010-09-30T13:28:00.000Z	Inferus		i have ubuntu server installed, want to put xubuntu on it, and have it boot to the gui automatically on start up
2010-09-30T13:28:00.000Z	Inferus		is there a howto?
2010-09-30T13:28:00.000Z	Inferus		:)
2010-09-30T13:29:00.000Z	Inferus		Is it just, sudo apt-get install xubuntu
2010-09-30T13:29:00.000Z	Inferus		Is it just, sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2010-09-30T13:29:00.000Z	Inferus		even

2010-09-30T13:30:00.000Z	darkdelusions		that will walk you threw it step by step
2010-09-30T13:30:00.000Z	darkdelusions	Inferus	which is pretty much apt-get install xubuntu-desktop :)
2010-09-30T13:31:00.000Z	Inferus		erm, i want to have a xubuntu desktop as my linux-fu is weak at the moment, so whilst i learn more about it, it's easier for me to do some tasks in gui
2010-09-30T13:31:00.000Z	Inferus		:)
2010-09-30T13:31:00.000Z	Inferus	st__	maybe they are busy? :)

2010-09-30T13:32:00.000Z	Inferus		is kubuntu better then?
2010-09-30T13:32:00.000Z	Inferus		i have ubuntu on my laptop, fancy seeing what kde is like
2010-09-30T13:32:00.000Z	Inferus		:D
2010-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	darkdelusions	Inferus	 kubuntu \ ubuntu are pretty much the same it just personal pref
