2006-08-13T11:44:00.000Z	davidjohnston		yea I see the security precautions but if you manager your system well then su shouldn't be a problem
2006-08-13T11:44:00.000Z	davidjohnston		and I'm sorry if I missed it but did anyone say if it's possible to do a network install of Ubuntu Server
2006-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	davidjohnston		i read you couldn't...I would love to know how
2006-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	davidjohnston		oh so load the cd from one cd
2006-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	davidjohnston		or from another machine
2006-08-13T11:47:00.000Z	davidjohnston		ok well I'll check it out and see if I can get anything anyway...I appreciate it
2006-08-13T11:48:00.000Z	davidjohnston		the last link didn't load
2006-08-13T11:49:00.000Z	davidjohnston		anyway ubuntu has gotten so much hype for a while I decided to attempt a switch...these are just my personal machines for home and testing
2006-08-13T11:49:00.000Z	davidjohnston		anyway, do you think ubuntu is worth the switch...i'm moving from a SuSe system
2006-08-13T11:50:00.000Z	davidjohnston		i still don't know much about apt
2006-08-13T11:51:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	I come from a Red Hat background going back to 1996 (having used Linux since 1994) and recently moved to Ubuntu.  I'm born again when it comes to Debian style package management.
2006-08-13T11:51:00.000Z	davidjohnston	gdb	 so you prefer apt then
2006-08-13T11:51:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	By far!
2006-08-13T11:51:00.000Z	davidjohnston	gdb	 so honestly I have never used a debian based system...is apt just a software manager or more
2006-08-13T11:53:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	Well, to be fair, the analogue to rpm is really dpkg, not apt.  But to clarify, while they are both "package managers" the dpkg system keeps track of far more information (with an exception I'll get to) in regards to package "state" information on disk.  For example, dpkg will keep track of what are called "selections" which refers to packages that are installed, partially installed, have been remove, have been purged (there is a difference fro
2006-08-13T11:55:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	Because of this "state information" you're able to take "snapshops" (sans version information) of your installed software, allowing you to move from one set of installed software to another with a few simple commands.  The only feature missing from dpkg/apt/etc that I found useful in rpm is the rpm -v command to verify the installed files against what's installed by the package itself.
2006-08-13T11:57:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	Packages that have been "removed" have the program files removed, but the configuration files are left in place.  This allows you to reinstall a package with your configuration already in place.  To purge a package also removes those configuration files.  A package that is "partially installed" has been unpacked into the filesystem but has not been set up either via a postinst script or via user intervention.  A package that has been partially 
2006-08-13T11:58:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	One problem with removing packages that dpkg/apt does not handle (and neither does rpm, unless they're part of the package) is the removal of what are called 'dangling symlinks', symlinks which are in the filesystem but do not point to anything.  This is really the fault of package maintainers that do not remove these files in their postrm scripts.  You can install the package "symlinks" and run the command "sudo symlinks -dr /*" after removing
2006-08-13T12:02:00.000Z	gdb	davidjohnston	If you're really serious about investigating or performing a migration from SuSE to Ubuntu (and thus a Debian system) then I'd highly recommend the Martin F. Krafft book "The Debian System: Concepts and Techniques" which covers not only some of the nity grity of what makes a Debian operating system uniquely "Debian" but also delves into the politics and behind the scenes work that goes into engineering a Debian based operating system (in this c
