2005-11-04T07:45:00.000Z	chenel		yeah when i try to install mplayer or totem-xine it tries to install them
2005-11-04T07:45:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	back up first of course
2005-11-04T07:41:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	i had the same problem..I just downloaded the tar.gz and uzipped to /usr/lib/win32...
2005-11-04T07:41:00.000Z	chenel	ubenguin	yes i did that
2005-11-04T07:42:00.000Z	chenel	ubenguin	but it still wants to install the package w32codecs because the apt system doesn't know that i have installed it myself
2005-11-04T07:42:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	then to stop apt from trying to install everytime um...somebody help me with this I think its apt-get -f ?
2005-11-04T07:43:00.000Z	chenel	ubenguin	is there no way to lie to apt and tell it you installed something?
2005-11-04T07:43:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	oh ya..had to do that too. let me see if I can remember
2005-11-04T07:45:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	edit /var/lib/dpkg/status
2005-11-04T07:47:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	;)
2005-11-04T07:50:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	I told you what to do man
2005-11-04T07:51:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	edit /var/lib/dpkg/status and type ok for the program that is trying to install w32codecs
2005-11-04T07:51:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	apt will think everything installed correctly and will never try to install w32 again!
2005-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	where is says totem in that file, you'll see it says half complete or something like that, change it to ok
2005-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	chenel	ubenguin	ok i think i got it
2005-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	chenel	ubenguin	i actually just changed w32codecs to installed
2005-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	chenel	ubenguin	thank you very much
2005-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	ubenguin	chenel	ok...that'll work too
