2009-10-21T23:30:00.000Z	mneptok	dragon	next to impossible, if you want a warrantee that covers Ubuntu
2009-10-21T23:31:00.000Z	mneptok	dragon	if you install Ubuntu on a machine sold with Windows, 99% of OEMs immediately void your warrantee.
2009-10-21T23:32:00.000Z	dragon	mneptok	That's something I don't want him to know.
2009-10-21T23:33:00.000Z	mneptok	dragon	better to buy from a vendor that ships with Ubuntu (System76/Zareason/Dell) or build your own.
