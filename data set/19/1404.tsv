2011-02-01T10:48:00.000Z	ubuser		so if you unmount a flash drive, its usually in the folder dev/disk?
2011-02-01T10:50:00.000Z	ubuser		i assume it isnt the same name as when it was mounted either?
2011-02-01T10:50:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	You can specify size in MB in gparted
2011-02-01T10:54:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	You can also look in the sidebar in nautilus
2011-02-01T10:54:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	"sudo apt-get install firefox"
2011-02-01T10:55:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	I installed 10.10 on my flash drive a few minutes ago using usb-creator. I partition my flash drive using disk utility, and install ubuntu on the second partition. With the first for data, as Windoze can only see the first partition on a drive.
2011-02-01T10:56:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	You can use lili on windows, and disk-creator for linux. As for mac, nobody seems to care about that.
2011-02-01T10:57:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	You can use gparted. It specifies size in MB
2011-02-01T10:58:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	You can also repartition it too.
2011-02-01T10:59:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	Go in gparted, and go to the right side, and find your device
2011-02-01T11:12:00.000Z	sorandomname	ubuser	you can download ubuntu 10.10: http://www.ubuntu.com/get-ubuntu/download
