2008-05-14T06:58:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	i still dont get it, ubottu ignores me in pms, how do people discover triggers and factoids?
2008-05-14T06:59:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	you need to /msg ubottu keyword (eg ati) and he will give you links info etc
2008-05-19T06:12:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	first shut down compiz
2008-05-19T06:12:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	then open a terminal and type top
2008-05-19T06:15:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	what am I looking for exactly?  i spend alot of time in top, its how i noticed compiz was eating my processor to begin with
2008-05-19T06:15:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	how many plugins you have enabled in compiz
2008-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	i dont get why you are ignoring me, im looking for any help i can get
2008-05-19T06:16:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	that is not the issue, it happens any time compiz has to render anything in the cube.  I have even reformatted and reinstalled hardy just for this.  just the cube gears by themselves take my CPU from 30ish to 90ish%
2008-05-19T06:17:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	you know the issue then have at it
2008-05-19T06:20:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	no its not that im not open to suggestions but ive been dealing with this for a long time and have experimented with taking out and removing things very intensely and already know its the things that render that are causing the cpu to go up, also nvidia GPU powermizer tab says my GPU performance is 0.  direct rendering is on  do you think my vid card is defective maybe?
2008-05-19T06:21:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	does that Nvidia settings > GPU >powermizer  tab give an accurate display of how much work the GPU is doing?
2008-05-19T06:23:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	did i offend you?  i was merely saying that i had tried that approach already.  I know the things that cause the problem i just dont know why they do or how to fix it
2008-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	I have been a bit busy; please ask the channel
2008-05-19T06:28:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	ok, i understand you are a volunteer and busy, but i have been asking the channel every couple hours every day for about a month and its rare to even get someone to respond about it.  as well as posting on the ubuntuforums extensivly and the compiz forums
2008-05-19T06:29:00.000Z	bazhang	xim	I really know very little about compiz (never use it)--> best bet is the compiz channel imo
2008-05-19T06:30:00.000Z	xim	bazhang	ok, i have been asking in there too as well as #nvidia but thanks anyway
