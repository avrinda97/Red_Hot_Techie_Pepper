2010-06-05T05:46:00.000Z	john725		hey guys could anyone recommend the best theme/package to make ubuntu (10.04) look like mac os X? is mac4lin the best? Also, what do you recommend, docky do or AWN (avant window manager)? Thanks
2010-06-05T05:47:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	there are many themes out there that can make your desktop look just like OSX, docky is probibly the best as far as docks go. CairoDock is really fancy if you like that kinda thing
2010-06-05T05:48:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 however, I think there are many gnome themes that put osx to shame.
2010-06-05T05:48:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	if I were you I would check out www.gnomelook.com and check out some of the themes there and why copy apple if you can make something that is alot more awesome
2010-06-05T05:49:00.000Z	john725	abuayyoub	thanks. could you please explain what you mean about cairodock being fancy? Also, I would love it if you could recommend some themes (which one is your fave)?
2010-06-05T05:51:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 Cairodock ( or XGL dock i think its called now ) it has all kinda nifty compiz features, the icons spin and burst into flame and jump all over the place if you into that kinda thing CairoDock is what you want. If you want just a simple dock that looks good and is stable go with Docky. I love Docky but it is stil buggy, they are all buggy actually AWN never really did anything for me. I actually find myself using DockbarX which is a windows 7
2010-06-05T05:51:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	basically, cairo dock has a whole hell of a lot of features. you can spend hours configuring it
2010-06-05T05:53:00.000Z	john725	abuayyoub	mmm thanks. ill look into. yeah, i saw the dockbarx on the gnome-look site and it looks real good. Another quick question, hopefully you can help me out. if i want to customize my desktop environment so that i can have multiple desktops and use a 3d cube or soemthing, do i need compiz fusion or is there something better?
2010-06-05T05:56:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	for all the cool effects like the cube and such all you have to do is download CCSM (compiz config settings manager ) you can get it from the software center just search for it. It lets you enable all the cool little effects.
2010-06-05T05:59:00.000Z	john725	abuayyoub	thanks so much for all the help. it's nice to be back #ubuntu , people here are so much nicer and more helpful (not to mention smarter) than the generally d1cks over at #mac
2010-06-05T06:02:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 It used to be that linux was behind in the game but with this new release of Lucid and the upcoming releases of Gnome and Gnome_shell, windows & Mac are gonna be playing catch-up linux is the future man seriously.
2010-06-05T06:04:00.000Z	john725	abuayyoub	yeah, id been using ubuntu for like 2 years, but then I bought a macbook pro for college (for the resale value) and havent really run ubuntu natively on it since over at #mac an apple tech tells me he fixes fried/over heated boards allegedly caused by natively running OSes other than mac os x...
2010-06-05T06:05:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 he's a fanboiii
2010-06-05T06:07:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 I started using linux off and on for the last 10 years, went to a windows machine then a mac then back to a windows machine, starting using ubuntu from Daper Drake and fell in love. Lucid tho is amazing I lvoe this distro man friggin fantastic
2010-06-05T06:08:00.000Z	john725	abuayyoub	lucid seems nice, just installed it today on my desktop, going to try and sell my mbp
2010-06-05T06:10:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 noone can argue that apple has the sickest hardware, osx is good too dont get me wrong I do like it.  but Linux just gives you freedom ( for better or worse ) that you just dont have on osx and windows.  OsX is a good OS IMO and Windows 7 ( shoot me for saying it ) is actually ALMOST decent, but really nothing beats ubuntu these days for people who really love computers.
2010-06-05T06:11:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	 Ubuntu on a MBP = Win in my opinion
2010-06-05T06:13:00.000Z	john725	abuayyoub	yeah the would be amazing, in my opinion no other manufacture makes laptops as sexy as macbook pros, but their specs arent that great and i think there is a lot of truth behind what the main guy (branes) over at #mac says, there problem has something to do with this apple propertary  power management thing i forget what its called
2010-06-05T06:16:00.000Z	abuayyoub	john725	not sure. OSX is based on Unix and it uses intel chips so I dont see how there could be a problem. But Thats a question for someone alot smarter than me lol
