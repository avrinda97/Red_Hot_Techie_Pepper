2010-08-23T09:16:00.000Z	Rummage		Hello, I'm having trouble with what windows terms "Internet Connection Sharing", in that my ubuntu laptop is connected via an ethernet cable to my WinXP tower, which is in tern connected via modem to the internet. It worked for about five hours, but has suddenly ceased functioning and I cannot think of anything having been done which could have caused a problem.
2010-08-23T09:16:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	Are you talking about some type of file server? Take a look at samba or nfs (both have great tutorials online)
2010-08-23T09:17:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	If you right click on a directory while in the gnome desktop environment, you should be able to select 'share this file' or some such.
2010-08-23T09:17:00.000Z	Rummage		No, that's not really what I'm on about.
2010-08-23T09:17:00.000Z	mek||malloc		Oh, you want your windows box to act as a router
2010-08-23T09:18:00.000Z	mek||malloc		Sorry*, Rummage: You want your windows machine to act as a routeR?
2010-08-23T09:18:00.000Z	Rummage		Windows has this feature called Internet Connection sharing, where Computer B on a network, say LAN, can use computer A's internet connection.
2010-08-23T09:18:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	I wouldn't trust windows for anything. Especially networking. I suggest asking the windows folks.
2010-08-23T09:18:00.000Z	Rummage		I'm betting windows is at fault, but I still can't figure out why it would quit suddenly with no changes.
2010-08-23T09:19:00.000Z	Rummage		I mean, I actually managed to use it to update Synaptic and install VLC :\
2010-08-23T09:19:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	I don't know why you're asking a car mechanic to fix your broken television set.
2010-08-23T09:20:00.000Z	Rummage		Because there are car mechanics around, and the TV repairman show's up days late and with terrible advice.
2010-08-23T09:20:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	Fine, fair enough. My suggestion is to format that windows machine and but some flavor of GNU Linux on it.
2010-08-23T09:21:00.000Z	Rummage	zzzed	It looks like that's my only recourse.
2010-08-23T09:21:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	You haven't tried restarting the machine?...
2010-08-23T09:21:00.000Z	Rummage		mek: It's a thing of last resort, as you may be familiar, windows machines are terribly ornery when it comes to rebooting.
2010-08-23T09:22:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	I think that's the first thing I'd retry.
2010-08-23T09:22:00.000Z	Rummage		Well, see, it takes longer to reboot than it has taken to ascertain that's the only idea we've got here.
2010-08-23T09:22:00.000Z	mek||malloc	Rummage	Either that or ipconfig /release all and then try to renew your network information
