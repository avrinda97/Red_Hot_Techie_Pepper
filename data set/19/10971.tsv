2007-01-11T13:06:00.000Z	facugaich		What web server/database do tou recommend to use with RoR?
2007-01-11T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	Apache and... whatever DB you're comfortable with
2007-01-11T13:09:00.000Z	facugaich	Flannel	But what about FastCGI?
2007-01-11T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	fastCGI is compatable with apache.
2007-01-11T13:10:00.000Z	facugaich	Flannel	I've read it's outdated and has many flaws
2007-01-11T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	then why are you interested in using it?
2007-01-11T13:12:00.000Z	facugaich	Flannel	Because cgi alone is too slow. Do you know any alternative?
2007-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	I actually have never heard of any problems with FastCGI. You might double check your sources on that
2007-01-11T13:15:00.000Z	facugaich	Flannel	Maybe they we're referring to Windows version, I don't know, thanks anyway. Another question, what are the latest working versions of apache/mysql for dapper? 2.3/5.0?
2007-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	2.0.55 and... well, SQL5, no idea about minor version, you can check : packages.ubuntu.com
2007-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	facugaich	Flannel	Ok, thanks
2007-01-27T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	in what?

2007-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	facugaich	Flannel	sed probably, thanks
2007-10-20T04:37:00.000Z	Flannel	facugaich	There are.  What torrent are you looking for?
