2007-07-05T07:44:00.000Z	`Nick		hey, are their any particular graphics issues on a Dell Inspiron 1150?
2007-07-05T07:46:00.000Z	`Nick		my Dell Inspiron 1150 makes a bunch of weird lines on the bottom half of the screen, and it wont work in normal or 'safe graphics' mode
2007-07-05T07:46:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	- what graphics card do you have in the inspiron 1150?
2007-07-05T07:47:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	um, i got no idea - it's used, and nothing has worked on it since i got it, and i dont see anything about it :(
2007-07-05T07:47:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	- I;m dealing with some weird crashing issues with X on an older inspiron laptop with the ATI rage 128 card
2007-07-05T07:48:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	hm... any ideas on how to possibly make it work?
2007-07-05T07:49:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	- what exactly is the problem, sorry?
2007-07-05T07:49:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	well, parts of the screen show random lines instead of a picture - and the whole screen is never filled at once
2007-07-05T07:50:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	try Fn + F7
2007-07-05T07:50:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	nothing
2007-07-05T07:51:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	no...
2007-07-05T07:51:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	but i just freakin BURNED myself on my laptop o.o
2007-07-05T07:52:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	- sorry - I get a weird line thing happening on the screen too every reboot. Something to do with screen scaling fixed it for me, but I have to do it each time. Some people on inspirons have reported only higher resolutions working. try to set it up to 1400x ??? and see if it works
2007-07-05T07:52:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	now i'm more worried about it being hot enough to burn me =\
2007-07-05T07:53:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	any ideas how to make it run cooler?
2007-07-05T07:53:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	- maybe you should figure out your heating problem first. is the fan running? is anything blocking air flow?
2007-07-05T07:54:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	i dont see anything, but live CD isn't even warm so it's not that
2007-07-05T07:56:00.000Z	bloke	`Nick	- don't forget to unplug it first
2007-07-05T07:57:00.000Z	`Nick	bloke	it's been unplugged, but thanks for watchin out for me :)
