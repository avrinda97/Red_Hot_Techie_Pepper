2006-12-27T14:28:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	freebsd with linux binary support
2006-12-27T14:29:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	well there is a pcbsd its easy but id say a bit harder than ubuntu
2006-12-27T14:31:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	second slackware if you dont want a debian distro
2006-12-27T14:33:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	its likely youll have to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst  id do that rather than letting the other distros install a boot manager to mbr
2006-12-27T14:34:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	of course you can always recover mbr really easily with livecd
2006-12-27T14:48:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	imo gentoo and ubuntu channels are some of the friendliest on freenode
2006-12-27T14:58:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	recommend ktorrent even in gnome..
2006-12-27T15:25:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	what is the problem?
2006-12-27T15:26:00.000Z	pike_	toulouse	ls ~/.Trash  if no files show up its empty
