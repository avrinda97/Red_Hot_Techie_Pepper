2011-05-10T11:31:00.000Z	kalivos		is your numberlock key lit?

2011-05-10T11:31:00.000Z	kalivos		that might be why
2011-05-10T11:32:00.000Z	kalivos		let me know if togling numlock fixes that
2011-05-10T11:32:00.000Z	kalivos		windows does it automatically
2011-05-10T11:33:00.000Z	kalivos		its off by default in linux]
2011-05-10T11:34:00.000Z	Mrokii	kalivos	Is there a way to let Ubuntu do that automatically after each start?
2011-05-10T11:34:00.000Z	kalivos	Mrokii	im assuming that once you turn it on ubuntu "remembers" that you enabled it when you restart
2011-05-10T11:38:00.000Z	kalivos	Mrokii	i havent forgotten about you
2011-05-10T11:39:00.000Z	Mrokii	kalivos	thank you
2011-05-10T11:39:00.000Z	Mrokii	kalivos	I am currently looking on google for a solution for the numlock-key
2011-05-10T11:42:00.000Z	kalivos	Mrokii	 what is your "Keyboard model" set to?
2011-05-10T11:43:00.000Z	Mrokii	kalivos	Generic 105-key (Intl) PC
2011-05-10T11:43:00.000Z	kalivos	Mrokii	im guessing layout is USA?
2011-05-10T11:47:00.000Z	Mrokii	kalivos	Me neither, but it's worth a try. Thanks for your help, kalivos. At least I know now how to enable it manually. I never thought about the numlock-key because I only ever used the settings, heh.
2011-05-10T11:47:00.000Z	kalivos	Mrokii	did you see ward1234 's comment?
2011-05-10T11:48:00.000Z	kalivos	Mrokii	look around in your bios for a numlock option that can be toggled
