2006-11-24T12:48:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	check out ndiswrapper.  you'll have to confirm your driver, but if it has windows drivers you can usually load it.
2006-11-24T12:48:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	just saw your url... brb
2006-11-24T12:48:00.000Z	jml	quinnster	where would I get windows drivers?
2006-11-24T12:49:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	do you dual (or more) boot?
2006-11-24T12:49:00.000Z	jml	quinnster	no. at the moment I am only running OS X. I tried using Ubuntu on my powerbook then gave up after I couldn't get wireless working.
2006-11-24T12:51:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	oh! i guess that would make it hard to get windows drivers.  :) i have no experience with apple, but go to the website and see if you can find a driver download for win32.  there are 2 files among them that ndiswrapper can use.
2006-11-24T12:52:00.000Z	jml	quinnster	you mean, go to the apple website?
2006-11-24T12:52:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	no, try whoever makes the card... broadcom?  i'm checking around, too
2006-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	you still here?
2006-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	jml	quinnster	always.
2006-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	check out -- http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List -- search for 'BCM4306' and it shows a link for downloads from acer-euro.com.
2006-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	quinnster	jml	your chip is listed in there multiple times.  one of them has the link.  it might not be the easiest to install, but it definately looks like other people are getting it to work.  i have to go, but best of luck and let me know how it goes or if you need help next time you see me! :)
2006-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	jml	quinnster	thanks
