2009-10-12T12:08:00.000Z	linux_trojan		Question:  has Ubuntu made it impossible to INIT3 and close down X-windows?
2009-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- not that I am aware of
2009-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	linux_trojan	Bluey	  so how do you close down x windows and just operate from a console?
2009-10-12T12:09:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	-- I use that in SuSe - but ubuntu seems happy with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-10-12T12:10:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	== there's always sudo init 1
2009-10-12T12:11:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	-- you can do ctrl+alt+f1 to get to the console
2009-10-12T12:12:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- init 3 doesn't work in ubuntu
2009-10-12T12:13:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- yes that will do the equiv. of init 5/init 3
2009-10-12T12:34:00.000Z	linux_trojan	Bluey	are you still there
2009-10-12T12:35:00.000Z	linux_trojan	Bluey	 INIT 1 worked, now I have one more question
2009-10-12T12:35:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- shoot
2009-10-12T12:36:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- I don't know the answer to that - sorry
2009-10-12T12:37:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- private message okay?
2009-10-12T12:39:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- what kind of video card do you have? what browser ru using?
2009-10-12T12:39:00.000Z	linux_trojan	Bluey	 I dont see how that is relevant?
2009-10-12T12:39:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	- it's relevant if it doesn't work in x
2009-10-12T12:40:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	-- sorry
2009-10-12T12:41:00.000Z	Bluey	linux_trojan	can you do cat /proc/cpuinfo and pastebin it?
