2011-08-24T19:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	You did or someone else. At least acording to the screenshot
2011-08-24T19:47:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	That file is PPA free, so there muist be a file inm /etc/apt/sources.list.d
2011-08-24T19:48:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	can reset your system with ppa-purge. That will uninstall the repository and set every package to the one from the origin rep
2011-08-24T19:48:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	its a directory
2011-08-24T19:51:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	you can try to fix it with ppa-purge ppa:exaile-devel-ppa-natty
2011-08-24T19:51:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	Yes
2011-08-24T20:00:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	whats up?
2011-08-24T20:00:00.000Z	CoolCoder	schnuffle	http://pastebin.com/57uG2apK
2011-08-24T20:00:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	try sudo ppa-purge ppa:exaile-devel/ppa
2011-08-24T20:03:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	Okay then the hard way. just sudo mv exaile-devel-ppa-natty.list exaile-devel-ppa-natty.list.old
2011-08-24T20:03:00.000Z	CoolCoder	schnuffle	ok\
2011-08-24T20:05:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	You can still run into problems with packages that are still installed from that repo
2011-08-24T20:05:00.000Z	CoolCoder	schnuffle	hmm
2011-08-24T20:06:00.000Z	schnuffle	CoolCoder	But that can normally be solved by uninstalling these packages when it happens
2011-08-24T20:07:00.000Z	CoolCoder	schnuffle	now we renamed it. correct?>
