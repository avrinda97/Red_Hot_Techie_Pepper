2008-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	mib_it19z3		well, for some reason my hard drive doesnt show when i try to install ubuntu...
2008-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	what disk controller?
2008-08-07T15:23:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	lspci -nn
2008-08-07T15:23:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	I asked something
2008-08-07T15:26:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	can you finally tell us what disk controller you have?
2008-08-07T15:27:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	I TOLD you!
2008-08-07T15:27:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	lspci -nn
2008-08-07T15:28:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	we don't care about windows. we only care about ubuntu
2008-08-07T15:29:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	boot a livecd and tell us the output of "sudo fdisk -l"
2008-08-07T15:32:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	x-chat or irssi
2008-08-07T15:34:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	for the last time: I asked you several times to do some diagnostics. either you do them or we cannot help. end of story. we need more information
2008-08-07T15:34:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	that is NOT what I asked.
2008-08-07T15:35:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	no one cares about your BIOS: last time: what disk controller? lspci -nn to find out
2008-08-07T15:45:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	and it never will unless you answer. you said it showed you a lot of stuff. so pastebin that output
2008-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	wols	mib_it19z3	that controller is supported for ages. use sudo fdisk -l to see what partitions there are
