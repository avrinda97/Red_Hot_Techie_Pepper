2011-12-12T03:46:00.000Z	silentnights		I have my laptop overheat, is there a way to make my fan run faster?? I think I need toconfigure /etc/sensors.d/sensors.conf but I am not sure what to add there
2011-12-12T03:46:00.000Z	silentnights		here is the output of sensors command http://paste.ubuntu.com/767382/
2011-12-12T03:48:00.000Z	silentnights		can someone help me with my laptop overheat problem?
2011-12-12T03:49:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	if it's software issue, we can, if it only needs a new fan, then you know what to do
2011-12-12T03:50:00.000Z	silentnights	apwbdjp	It's a software issue for sure, cause the fan is running slow and It goes faster when the heat goes up, but I think It needs calibration
2011-12-12T03:51:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	the fan is usually controlled by the bios, I never heard about an uncalibrated fan. Is CPU usage too high from the moment you start the machine?
2011-12-12T03:51:00.000Z	silentnights	apwbdjp	here is output of sensors command : http://paste.ubuntu.com/767382/    as you can see the temperature is 79, and the fan is not running at full speed yet
2011-12-12T03:53:00.000Z	silentnights	apwbdjp	no, the cpu is not too high.. I don't think so... From what I read throw googling I might need to edit /etc/sensors.d/sensors.conf and set low and high values for the fan. but I am not sure.
2011-12-12T03:54:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	as I said, the fan is (usually, on all hardware that I dealt with) controlled by the bios, not by the os
2011-12-12T03:54:00.000Z	silentnights	apwbdjp	I don't know how to debug the issue, if you can suggest anything it would be great, btw my fan goes faster when the temperature goes higher like 85 or something
2011-12-12T03:55:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	did you try burning the cpu until it shuts down? See at which temperature is dies? (make sure you've got enough security on your cpu before doing this)
2011-12-12T03:56:00.000Z	silentnights	apwbdjp	no, I did not try to, but my laptop hangs sometimes when it goes overheat.
2011-12-12T04:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	some BIOS's do show temperature, in the setup settings, did you check that?
2011-12-12T04:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	if temperature doesn't get high, there, then it's either cpu usage goes too hard for some reason, or sensors is screwing with you
2011-12-12T04:07:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	that's not controlled by the OS, generally, the fanspeed is a BIOS matter.. and I still have the feeling that sensors is lying to you
2011-12-12T04:08:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	you say that it does show you over 90Â° and the machine keeps running. Wouldn't an i5 go into security shut down, at this temp?
2011-12-12T04:13:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	how about it's temperature? (clic the SMART Status to have a full report)
2011-12-12T04:35:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	if on all the distros you'll be testing temp with sensors, then think of trying Windows too
2011-12-12T04:36:00.000Z	apwbdjp	silentnights	it's probably faulty hardware, but it's still worth checking before shipping it back
