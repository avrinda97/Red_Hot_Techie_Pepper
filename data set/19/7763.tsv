2007-09-16T14:21:00.000Z	Nido		anyone here experience with nested subversion repositories?
2007-09-16T14:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	nested?
2007-09-16T14:22:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	yes. /foo is a repository; /foo/bar is another repository
2007-09-16T14:22:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	nested working copies you mean
2007-09-16T14:22:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	no; different repositories
2007-09-16T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	Those directories are on your local machine, right?  You did a svn checkout repos1 /foo and svn checkout repos2 /foo/bar
2007-09-16T14:24:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	yup; just like that
2007-09-16T14:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	right, those are working copies, not repositories
2007-09-16T14:24:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	sorry. In that case; nested working copies
2007-09-16T14:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	Anyway, what did you have a question about?
2007-09-16T14:25:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	I've got a few subversion working copies, and I want to subversionise my whole homedir. Does that mean I can just make a repository out of that and everything will go fine and dandy or does it spell trouble with the other repositories
2007-09-16T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	You don't really want to put your whole home folder in version control.
2007-09-16T14:26:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	eventually yes; I plan not to have any media files etc. in there then
2007-09-16T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	what it means is you'll have to add everything *except* those folders to your repository.
2007-09-16T14:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	You'll use twice the space though.
2007-09-16T14:28:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	I got a few spare GB's. And it'd be handy to sync my homedir between laptop/desktop/uva/whereever and keep a record of it's history
2007-09-16T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	alright, well, if you're intent on it, you just don't add ~/foo and ~/foo/bar to your repository, and youll want to put add them to svn ignore, so you don't get messages about them later on, but that's technically not required
2007-09-16T14:29:00.000Z	Nido	Flannel	Okay. Thank you for that. I'm gonna think a bit on how I'm going to realise this
2007-09-16T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Nido	Check out the svn book, its online, and a great reference.
