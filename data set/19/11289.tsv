2006-03-11T12:54:00.000Z	lint		Still having the same problem, can play videos off of youtube and google video, but not any wmv files nor no quicktime files. I've installed w32codecs, mplayer, etc
2006-03-11T12:55:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	did you install mozilla-mplayer ?
2006-03-11T12:55:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	yep
2006-03-11T12:56:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	newest version as well
2006-03-11T12:56:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	try http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/test.html ; there's a bunch of test links there, possibly you can narrow down what's working, what's not
2006-03-11T12:59:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	it failed every test
2006-03-11T12:59:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	in firefox location box, type about:plugins
2006-03-11T13:00:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	yeah it only shows shockwave and futuresplash
2006-03-11T13:00:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	i know it should show the others i've installed, but it doesn't
2006-03-11T13:00:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	that is most strange; are you using firefox 1.5?
2006-03-11T13:03:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	look at !ff1.5 ; the page referenced there tells you how to get the plugins working
2006-03-11T13:05:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	i've run that before, but i'll do it again
2006-03-11T13:06:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	it's the linking that counts:  sudo ln -s /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/* from your firefox plugin directory
2006-03-11T13:10:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	next, I'd change my mplayer config, see $wiki/MplayerInstallHowto
2006-03-11T13:13:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	Edited the config file as the website specified, same problem still
2006-03-11T13:14:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	I'm not sure what your problem is, then. I had other issues with 1.5, so I switched back to 1.0.7 in breezy. I don't have an install to play with
2006-03-11T13:15:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	im in dapper
2006-03-11T13:15:00.000Z	nickrud	lint	I'm on dapper, and everything works well. I'll see you in #ubuntu+1, by some miracle, maybe I can help 
2006-03-11T13:15:00.000Z	lint	nickrud	hey i appreciate all the help thus far man
