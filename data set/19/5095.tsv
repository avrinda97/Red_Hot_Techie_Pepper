2009-04-05T07:23:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	lemmie give you a link
2009-04-05T07:23:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	what is your bootloader?
2009-04-05T07:24:00.000Z	LavaHot		right now it's grub
2009-04-05T07:24:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	well.. this is what I did...  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=991987
2009-04-05T07:24:00.000Z	LavaHot		I <3 you space_cadet
2009-04-05T07:24:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	i wrote that :)
2009-04-05T07:26:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	basically the only difference, windows 7 will destroy your grub...
2009-04-05T07:27:00.000Z	LavaHot	space_cadet	I already read through that. this is on a single drive laptop. I'll need to repartition then install 7, but i don't quite know how to do that.
2009-04-05T07:27:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	so is mine...
2009-04-05T07:27:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	that's all on one drive...
2009-04-05T07:28:00.000Z	LavaHot		... okay, I'll re-read that then
2009-04-05T07:28:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	the way I am thinking should happen...   install windows 7   (your grub will be destroyed..)
2009-04-05T07:28:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	restore grub, but you have no way to boot to windows 7
2009-04-05T07:29:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	boot to vista, and follow the guide..
2009-04-05T07:29:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	it *should* be enough to get you going..
2009-04-05T07:30:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	from what I figured out, when i did all that, i had vista installed then win7 then ubuntu..   windows' boot loader was on the win7 partition..
2009-04-05T07:32:00.000Z	LavaHot	space_cadet	so when I install win7, will it just automatically partition space for itself or do I have to do it manually?
2009-04-05T07:44:00.000Z	space_cadet	LavaHot	make space..
