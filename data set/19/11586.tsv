2006-01-19T06:48:00.000Z	shadox_		can some help me with my removal problem? i can't delete xorg.conf.backup3 :s
2006-01-19T06:49:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	 sudo rm /path/to/xorg.conf.backup3
2006-01-19T06:49:00.000Z	shadox_	selinium	mwe, i tried already, but it doesn't work
2006-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	it will, you must be getting the path wrong
2006-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	where is the xorg.conf.backup3 file?
2006-01-19T06:52:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	it is probably sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup3
2006-01-19T06:52:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	 But it depends where you put the backup!
2006-01-19T06:53:00.000Z	shadox_	selinium	mwe    =>  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7143
2006-01-19T06:54:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	BIg X in X11
2006-01-19T06:55:00.000Z	shadox_	selinium	ok, i'll try and if it not works, i'll try mwe 's solution
2006-01-19T06:55:00.000Z	selinium	shadox_	it will! :) The file structure is case sensitive
2006-01-19T06:57:00.000Z	shadox_	selinium	didn't work
