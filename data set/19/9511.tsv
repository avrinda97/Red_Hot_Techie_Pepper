2007-07-22T16:03:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	Thanks, I'll try that.
2007-07-22T16:03:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	Still returning the same :(
2007-07-22T16:04:00.000Z	compengi	CPF_	do you have synaptic opened?
2007-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	I have now...
2007-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	compengi	CPF_	then close it and try that command
2007-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	I tried that command with synaptic closed...
2007-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	CPF_		I'll go to some pastebin, and paste the error there, you'll see what I mean :)
2007-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	compengi		!paste | CPF_
2007-07-22T16:07:00.000Z	CPF_		Lol, do I have to use that one?
2007-07-22T16:07:00.000Z	compengi	CPF_	nope ;)

2007-07-22T16:09:00.000Z	compengi	CPF_	i don't see anything of what you posted
2007-07-22T16:10:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	http://pastebin.com/m661c75e1 Should do it... :-/
2007-07-22T16:13:00.000Z	compengi	CPF_	well i have no idea about that issue, but i surely know that during install if a package is interrupted or failed running "apt-get install -f" would fix the problem. try to ask someone that has a clear view about this issue
2007-07-22T16:14:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	Can you refresh?
2007-07-22T16:15:00.000Z	compengi	CPF_	after you pasted the last link i saw your post but i have no idea of that issue
2007-07-22T16:15:00.000Z	CPF_	compengi	Refresh, I've viewed the whole command, and the result of it...
