2010-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		i just got out of dep-hell
2010-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		in hardy.
2010-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		i want a working system again
2010-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		I'm sorry, I tried that to start with and some users of the channel couldn't follow.
2010-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		I temporally separated parts of the statement so that they could more easily follow.
2010-07-05T09:48:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		I just got out of dep-hell.  I'm on hardy, I am 'upgrading' all still-installed packages to latest.  To get out of dep-hell, I had to remove X and gnome and gtk and gdm.
2010-07-05T09:49:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get reinstall ubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-07-05T09:50:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mneptok	did you read my question at all?
2010-07-05T09:51:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	yes, you removed requisite elements of ubuntu-desktop. reinstalling it will pull in all its dependencies like X, gdm and gnome
2010-07-05T09:51:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	and that's exactly what i answered.
2010-07-05T09:52:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	the "all that" line and saying "i want a working system" sort of implies you want Ubuntu back the way it ships.
2010-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mneptok	right, and this shipped with ubuntustudio-desktop not ubuntu-desktop :)
2010-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	well, do i need to edit the line i gave you or are you clever enough to figure it out yourself?
2010-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mneptok	I'm looking for a direct answer to the question I asked, not someone to try interpreting it as something completely unrelated
2010-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	so seek advice elsewhere. i'm done.
2010-07-05T09:56:00.000Z	mneptok	tonsofpcs	BTW. Ubuntu Studio is not an official Ubuntu derivative, so we do not support it here.
2010-07-05T09:56:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mneptok	actually, ubuntustudio was added to the official repos in hardy.
