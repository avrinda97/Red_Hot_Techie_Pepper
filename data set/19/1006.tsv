2011-06-19T04:37:00.000Z	andrewS		complex question: why are all applications not simply coded and run as portable applications? why bother registering with the operating system at all?
2011-06-19T04:37:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Because applications have to do things like 'open this file' and that depends heavily on the OS.  Not all OS's are written the same.
2011-06-19T04:38:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Simple example: C:\Windows\Some\Stupid\Folder vs /home/ed/great/stuff/goes/here/
2011-06-19T04:39:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Well from version to version things rarely change.  But from OS to OS there are big changes.
2011-06-19T04:41:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Well to make them portable they have to put in checks for which OS is running to act differently.  Those checks make it slower.  Additionally it has to wait for the OS to respond.
2011-06-19T04:41:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	I gave you the example of different path names.  If you wanna open a file right away you have to use a path which is OS specific.

2011-06-19T04:42:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	That's ok
2011-06-19T04:44:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Any more questions?  I can explain further :)
2011-06-19T04:45:00.000Z	andrewS	edbian	i just don't understand the application installation process in ubtuntu
2011-06-19T04:45:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	It puts certain files in certain places.  That's really all there is to it.  binaries usually go into /usr/bin/
2011-06-19T04:45:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	What is confusing specifically?
2011-06-19T04:47:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	cya
2011-06-19T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Does that second router have a public access?
2011-06-19T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	It must have a different IP address than 192.168.1.1  right?
2011-06-19T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	What address does it have?
2011-06-19T06:47:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	... that's not the whole thing
2011-06-19T06:47:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	Can you go to 192.168.2.1 ?
2011-06-19T06:47:00.000Z	edbian	andrewS	it's worth a shot.  I'm not really sure it will work.
