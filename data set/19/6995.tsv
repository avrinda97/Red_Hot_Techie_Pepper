2007-12-10T06:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	lol

2007-12-10T06:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	oh, you need help w/ Ubuntu, on an intel mac.
2007-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	no way to get into the bios?
2007-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	Junkie`	IndyGunFreak	nope
2007-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	there has to be online instructions to boot a intel mac from CD drivee
2007-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	Junkie`	IndyGunFreak	Yes, you are supposed to press 'c', but that isn't working
2007-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	and changing the boot ini tab didn't work?
2007-12-10T06:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	look at #16   http://www.ethicalhack.org/howto/triple_boot_howto.html
2007-12-10T06:57:00.000Z	Junkie`	IndyGunFreak	i did as it said, but holding down c did nothing and it just went to the windows boot loader
2007-12-10T06:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	i really don't know... sorry.
2007-12-10T06:59:00.000Z	Junkie`	IndyGunFreak	I added it and when i select it i get an error saying it didn't have access to the harddisk
2007-12-10T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Junkie`	i don't have the first idea.. sorry
