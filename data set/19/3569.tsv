2009-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	EEoar		Hi- mounting question..... if I'm adding a secondary disk to a server (and logging in as a "user") how do I give every user r/w access to the mounted disk?
2009-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	EEoar		is there a wiki for that somewhere/
2009-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	http://wiki.ubuntu.com
2009-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	EEoar	adam7	Yea, thanks... that's specific
2009-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	it answers your question; you asked if there is a wiki somewhere.
2009-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	sorry, missed the first line
2009-07-14T08:54:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	/etc/fstab and then you can chmod the mount point I think
2009-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	EEoar	adam7	I have it in /etc/fstab (I wish there was a disk utility like there is in WIndows (please don't shoot me) )
2009-07-14T08:56:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	what is the mount point?
2009-07-14T08:57:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	sudo chmod 777 /Disk1
2009-07-14T08:57:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	that will give *everyone* r/w and execute privs on that disk
2009-07-14T08:57:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	or at least in the root dir
2009-07-14T08:58:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	ok... that didn't work?
2009-07-14T08:58:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	ok, cool :)
2009-07-14T09:00:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	it won't show up in nautilus (AFAIK) unless it is mounted automatically, maybe someone in here knows how to fix that
2009-07-14T09:00:00.000Z	EEoar	adam7	I added it to /etc/fstab to auto-mount... I got it now
2009-07-14T09:00:00.000Z	adam7	EEoar	awesome
2009-07-14T09:01:00.000Z	EEoar	adam7	Thanks... things worked out in the end, w00t
