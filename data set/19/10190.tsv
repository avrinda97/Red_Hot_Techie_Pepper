2006-07-30T08:26:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		hey guys im getting strange noises coming from my secondary hdd and i was wondering if there are any checks i can perform on it in ubuntu
2006-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<jpatota> how would i go ablout that
2006-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	go to the manufacturers website, acquire the diagnostic tools and run them
2006-07-30T08:28:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	then get powermax from maxtors website.
2006-07-30T08:30:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	there is a cd .iso that you can boot
2006-07-30T08:30:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	Maxblast is windows only, powermax is a bootable cd
2006-07-30T08:31:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	boot the cd that you download, then see if it finds it, if not then no
2006-07-30T08:35:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	possibly, but no garuntee
2006-08-07T05:37:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	boot from live cd
2006-08-07T05:38:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-08-07T05:38:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	follow that guide and it will work
2006-08-07T05:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	frying_fish	im in the live cd, i already tried a guide which brought the old bootloader back with win still on it, it doesnt work
2006-08-07T05:39:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	thats because it will be using the menu.lst from before, after re-instaling grub
2006-08-07T05:41:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	the guide I linked tells you all you need
2006-08-07T05:46:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	frying_fish	cheers man an answer thats an answer and not another question great stuff
2006-08-07T05:58:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	frying_fish	Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time. (its still doing this)
2006-08-07T05:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	frying_fish	how long roughly athlonxp 1.9 512 ram 60 gig hd
2006-08-07T05:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	frying_fish	im just not sure if its actually doing anything
2006-08-07T07:32:00.000Z	frying_fish	Paddy_EIRE	how do you mean?
