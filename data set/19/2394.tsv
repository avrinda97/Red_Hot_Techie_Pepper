2010-10-27T19:05:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis		Hello. I've been having an issue with my laptop ever since upgrading to Ubuntu 10.10 from 10.04. Whenever I boot the latest kernel (the one that came with 10.10) I don't see anything on the screen. The system appears to be booting normally (judging by hard disk activity), it's just that I never get anything on the screen. The only way to boot my system (and have a display) is to use an old kernel left over from 10.04. My system
2010-10-27T19:05:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis		is a laptop (HP Elitebook 2730p) running intel graphics.

2010-10-27T19:11:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	my system doesn't use an nvidia card, and neither of those two solutions worked.
2010-10-27T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	it works with other chips too.
2010-10-27T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	if you boot to root recovery mode, then run: su foo    replace foo with your username, then run:   startx    do you get a desktop?
2010-10-27T19:13:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	Recovery mode shows me some text on the screen for a bit, then goes blank.
2010-10-27T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	ok then run:  less /var/log/Xorg.0.log     it will give clues
2010-10-27T19:17:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	I should add that I've tried the latest mainline kernel builds, and the current mainline (2.6.35.4, that matches the current Ubuntu kernel) also does not work, but the next kernel (2.6.35.7) does work.
2010-10-27T19:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	use the 35.7 kernel then :)
2010-10-27T19:18:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	but then my VGA out does not work.
2010-10-27T19:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	then get an xorg.conf file rocking and it will :)
2010-10-27T19:25:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	what would my xorg.conf have to do with anything when if I change kernels it works fine? Like I said, when I use the old kernel from 10.04 everything works just fine.
2010-10-27T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	if your video card doesn't work, it may be udev failing to detect the settings. So you can use an xorg.conf file to TELL the system what to use and it should work
2010-10-27T19:26:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	How can I do that?
2010-10-27T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	you cn run:   sudo Xorg -configure   then run:  sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf    then read online to find sample files / code
2010-10-27T19:31:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	ActionParsnip	When I try Xorg -configure, I get "Server is already active for display 0". The system is running right now with the display not working and I'm accessing it via ssh.
2010-10-27T19:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	i believe it makes the file in $HOME
2010-10-27T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rigorm0rtis	either way, you need the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf to be setup nice
