2007-11-18T22:19:00.000Z	bulmer		ttt-> read up on udev, man udev
2007-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	bulmer		ttt-> okay good luck
2007-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	bulmer		frank23-> one way to check is  sudo iptables -n -vL  to see if any rules are active and policies
2007-11-18T22:22:00.000Z	bulmer		whats a good interactive app between remote people collaborating, as in like one on one tutorial of kid learning math?
2007-11-18T22:22:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	That sounds really interesting.
2007-11-18T22:22:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	mmm; probably msn xD
2007-11-18T22:23:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	If you can get msn working under emulation; you could use it's picto-chat like ability; then use Skype for Voice over IP.
2007-11-18T22:23:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	It's super hax though.
2007-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	I really want to know what you find out; it sounds interesting.
2007-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	Vnc wouldn't be the best thing IMO.
2007-11-18T22:26:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	Just do it on their system; have them get the Vnc server; you get the vnc client.
2007-11-18T22:26:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	*Get my last message? I misspelled your name.
2007-11-18T22:27:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	I go to school; They're pretty paranoid. :D
2007-11-18T22:27:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	Getting them to run msn won't work either...
2007-11-18T22:30:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	When you figure out how to set up a tutoring application; right a tutorial on the ubuntu wiki :)
2007-11-18T22:30:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	I'm really interested in it.
2007-11-18T23:03:00.000Z	Phill	bulmer	no.
