2008-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	adrock358		hello all.  ahve a question for you.  just rendered my os (vista) unusable.  I enlarged the partition, then could't boot from it.  i've tried everything.  and my question is, if i install vista on another partition (install it again), will I be able to browse my primary partition from there, transfer my data to my new vista os, and save the day?
2008-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	is your vista partition also your primary partition?
2008-04-03T16:27:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 yes
2008-04-03T16:28:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	did you back up before resizing the partition?
2008-04-03T16:28:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 of course not.  otherwise i wouldn't be here in the forum
2008-04-03T16:28:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	ack.
2008-04-03T16:28:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 i know.
2008-04-03T16:28:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 what
2008-04-03T16:29:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	what was your setup prior to repartitioning?
2008-04-03T16:29:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 what's the best way to recover my data?  i tried the data recovery progs on hiren, but they ll seem very time consuming and confusing.
2008-04-03T16:30:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 i tried the vista recovery tools, didn't work.  tried to rebuild mbr, that didn't work.  tried to use hiren, that didn't fix it.
2008-04-03T16:31:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	sorry. i had a similar problem in november and wasn't able to recover anything. :(
2008-04-03T16:31:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	ubuntu-vista dual boot.  then i resized vista (enlarged it.  then I reinstalled ubuntu.  now, my computer won't boot to anything.  nothing loads.
2008-04-03T16:32:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	if you repartitioned and did an install after the partition, you may have overwritten the files.
2008-04-03T16:33:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 but my vista os, still shows up as an os.  i didn't overwrite the files at all.  they are all still there, I am sure of it.  it's just that my os won't load for some reason.
2008-04-03T16:35:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	plug in ethernet?
2008-04-03T16:35:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 that's in my dad's room.  it's too early to go in there.  7:00am or so here.... :)
2008-04-03T16:36:00.000Z	sunbird	adrock358	hurm. live cd is the best bet. wish i could give you better advice. it's so frustrating dealing with potential data loss.
2008-04-03T16:38:00.000Z	adrock358	sunbird	 no prob.  Thanks a lot man.
