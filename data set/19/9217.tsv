2006-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	wyld		I like the Ubuntu login sound wtf is it supposed to be?
2006-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	twb	wyld	an orangutan exploding into the front carriage of a steam train
2006-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	wyld	twb	Sounds plausible to me
2006-12-28T13:56:00.000Z	twb	wyld	ext3 = ext2 + journaling
2006-12-28T14:09:00.000Z	twb	wyld	you need a partition, a POSIX-compatible filesystem on it, and a bootloader that can boot a Linux OS on that filesystem.
2006-12-28T14:09:00.000Z	wyld	twb	can i boot linux off an extended partition?
2006-12-28T14:10:00.000Z	twb	wyld	I assume you're talking about peecee partition tables
2006-12-28T14:11:00.000Z	wyld	twb	what else does extended mean?
2006-12-28T14:12:00.000Z	twb	wyld	I don't know
2006-12-28T14:13:00.000Z	twb	wyld	24 GiB of what?
2006-12-28T14:15:00.000Z	twb	wyld	no
2006-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	twb	wyld	at least, not without a little fiddling.
2006-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	wyld	twb	ok, good thing I din't try then
2006-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	twb	wyld	when you install Ubuntu, it should offer to `just use my disk however you like.'
2006-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	wyld	twb	I need to keep two partitions
2006-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	twb	wyld	what I would do, then, is fire up gparted, delete all the partitiosn except the two you want to keep, and *then* run the installer
2006-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	twb	wyld	it should offer to `use free space as you see fit'
2006-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	wyld	twb	I have a primary windows partition, a primary media partition, an unknown thingie (looks like a backup thingamajjiger that toshiba put on there) and i need to install ubuntu on the rest
2006-12-28T14:21:00.000Z	wyld	twb	the only problem is that i can only have 4 primary partitions
