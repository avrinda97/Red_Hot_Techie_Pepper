2007-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	usr13	dag-eivind	What do you need to do?  Just get a wireless router set up and sharing your Internet Connection?  Or what?
2007-10-01T09:39:00.000Z	dag-eivind	usr13	-> Set up a wireless Internet-card.
2007-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	usr13	dag-eivind	What card is it?
2007-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	usr13	dag-eivind	Cisco, Linksys, Netgear etc. etc.
2007-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	usr13	dag-eivind	If it is fully supported, you just install it and boot up and it should work.
2007-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	usr13	dag-eivind	Have you installed it yet?
2007-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	dag-eivind	usr13	-> D-Link DWL-G510
2007-10-01T09:42:00.000Z	dag-eivind		It is supported by Ubuntu...
2007-10-01T09:42:00.000Z	usr13	dag-eivind	I think you will need ndiswraper for that one
