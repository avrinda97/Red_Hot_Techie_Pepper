2007-09-06T09:43:00.000Z	Meyvn		hey all, I'm having some trouble installing ubuntu on my laptop, when I try to install it it halts and drops me into a terminal Busy Box 1.3 (initramfs)
2007-09-06T09:43:00.000Z	Meyvn		I think it can't find a filesystem, I previously installed OpenSuse, then deleted the partition, I think my .mbr is gone.
2007-09-06T09:43:00.000Z	Meyvn		can I restore that with my Vista CD?
2007-09-06T09:45:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	its looking for the suse partition namely /boot/grub on suse partiion id just use ubuntu to rewrite the mbr pointing to the ub part
2007-09-06T09:45:00.000Z	dyrne		!mbr | Meyvn
2007-09-06T09:45:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	thank you
2007-09-06T09:48:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	I can't do that since I can't get it installed, I guess I'll have to make a GRUB rescue disk?
2007-09-06T09:49:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	it depends on what you want to do. are you looking to get rid of all linux and just back to windows?
2007-09-06T09:50:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	or fix grub
2007-09-06T09:50:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	I'm trying to install ubuntu on my laptop, I'm on my desktop machine now
2007-09-06T09:50:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	the installer is failing too?
2007-09-06T09:50:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	which has Vista on it and previously OpenSuse, I deleted the OpenSuse partition
2007-09-06T09:50:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	yes
2007-09-06T09:51:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	what is the prob with installer? just blank screen or what
2007-09-06T09:51:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	it drops me into a terminal Busy Box 1.3 (initramfs)
2007-09-06T09:51:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	easisest thing may be to use alternate install cd available on ubuntu.com
2007-09-06T09:51:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	it says it can't access tty
2007-09-06T09:55:00.000Z	dyrne	Meyvn	thats a fairly common error from what ive seen on ubuntuforums.org. id consider the alt cd or maybe even debian or the gutsy installer. some links: http://www.utheguru.com/solution-ubuntu-linux-binsh-cant-access-tty-job-control-mode-off-error https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/78380
2007-09-06T09:55:00.000Z	Meyvn	dyrne	thanks a bunch
