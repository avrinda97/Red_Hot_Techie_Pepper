2012-02-17T03:53:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	it says DIsk is healthy
2012-02-17T03:53:00.000Z	harry7		in green
2012-02-17T03:53:00.000Z	psusi	harry7	hrm.. you might want to run the long self test just in case
2012-02-17T03:54:00.000Z	psusi	harry7	and check the output of dmesg for errors
2012-02-17T03:54:00.000Z	harry7		ok
2012-02-17T03:57:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	do you want to paste the output of dmesg on pastebin?
2012-02-17T03:57:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	the file is long
2012-02-17T03:57:00.000Z	psusi	harry7	sure
2012-02-17T04:01:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	i got this two lines that might be interesting
2012-02-17T04:01:00.000Z	harry7		  162.424794] EXT4-fs (sda3): re-mounted. Opts: errors=remount-ro,commit=0
2012-02-17T04:01:00.000Z	harry7		[  167.708477] EXT4-fs (sda3): re-mounted. Opts: errors=remount-ro,commit=0
2012-02-17T04:01:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	all the rest seems no error
2012-02-17T04:02:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	cause i can tell that there is something that prevent this os to load. as soon as it unblocks itself i can see the hdd led light iluminated and that means the OS is loading
2012-02-17T04:04:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/845114/
2012-02-17T04:18:00.000Z	psusi	harry7	you didn't get the whole thing pasted... try just pasting from /var/log/kern.log, but the error you mentioned certainly sounds like the problem is a bad drive
2012-02-17T04:19:00.000Z	harry7	psusi	if this is the case, what can help me?
