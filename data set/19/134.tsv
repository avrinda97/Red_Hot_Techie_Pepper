2012-08-20T04:01:00.000Z	KM0201	idonthaveaname	what is the "normal installation procedure?"... that is causing your syustem to crash.
2012-08-20T04:02:00.000Z	idonthaveaname		Installing it. from a pen drive
2012-08-20T04:02:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	pendrive installation
2012-08-20T04:03:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	with grub.
2012-08-20T04:03:00.000Z	KM0201	idonthaveaname	thats not an install fail, thats a user fail
2012-08-20T04:03:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	well thanks. It's just that what I do is nothing, I just let it in there, and it shuts down.
2012-08-20T04:04:00.000Z	KM0201	idonthaveaname	so you're trying to install ubuntu, onto a USB, or are you trying to put an ISO on a USB, so you can install to a hard drive?  for what its worth, ubuntu writes to disk a lot, so don't expect a thumb drive to have a lot of life if your'e installing there.
2012-08-20T04:05:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	I am trying to install ubuntu, from a USB, to a USB.
2012-08-20T04:05:00.000Z	KM0201	idonthaveaname	ok.. most likely grub is getting put on the wrong disk, and thats why you're having this problem.
2012-08-20T04:05:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	persistant install
2012-08-20T04:06:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	No, no, I'm sure it boots
2012-08-20T04:06:00.000Z	idonthaveaname	KM0201	It shuts down during installation
2012-08-20T04:06:00.000Z	KM0201	idonthaveaname	i dunno, seems like an awful strange problem.
