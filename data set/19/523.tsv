2012-01-15T22:00:00.000Z	Radvendii		hey guys, i created a live USB with ubuntu on it from my mac, but now when i restart it doesn't let me boot from it...
2012-01-15T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	did you MD5 test it?
2012-01-15T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	the ISO, that is
2012-01-15T22:01:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	what does that mean? how do i do that?
2012-01-15T22:03:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	for creating it, i followed all of the directions on the ubuntu website
2012-01-15T22:10:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	it's this one: ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso
2012-01-15T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	thats the ISO, you will generate a hash for it then compare to the hash on the hashes page
2012-01-15T22:11:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	the really long string of numbers and characters?
2012-01-15T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	yes, thats the hash
2012-01-15T22:12:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	what do i do with the hash?
2012-01-15T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	the hashes page I made ubottu give you has the hashes of healthy complete files, if yours is different it is a corrupted download and you will need to redownload it
2012-01-15T22:14:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	it is the same...
2012-01-15T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	ok, it is healthy thenm
2012-01-15T22:15:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	so i think it is a problem with mac os x that it can't boot from the USB...
2012-01-15T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	what video chip does the system use?
2012-01-15T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	add the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
2012-01-15T22:16:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	how do i do that? where?
2012-01-15T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Radvendii	instead of immediately asking for clarification, try websearching a little for what is saif, you'll learn a little then :)
2012-01-15T22:17:00.000Z	Radvendii	ActionParsnip	yeah, sorry
