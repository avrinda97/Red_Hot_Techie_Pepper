2006-03-07T14:13:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha		anyone know how to get programs to appear in your applications menu after they are installed via terminal?
2006-03-07T14:14:00.000Z	oskude	OmegaAlpha	only if they have a "definition" file for the gnome menu
2006-03-07T14:15:00.000Z	oskude	OmegaAlpha	then they should appear right away, or do "sudo kill gnome-panel" (but some taskbar icons may dissappear)
2006-03-07T14:18:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	oskude	i installed this program before on a previous ubuntu installation and it appeared in the apps menu but now it wont
2006-03-07T14:19:00.000Z	oskude	OmegaAlpha	did you try to relog ?
2006-03-07T14:19:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	oskude	but nothing i download and install appears in the menus..
