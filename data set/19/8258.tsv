2007-04-19T14:37:00.000Z	phil8080		Can anyone help me with my sound on my Acer laptop, sound driver seems to be ok but no sound from the speakers!
2007-04-19T14:39:00.000Z	djm62	phil8080	I have an acer, and I'll try to help.  have you checked for things being muted by default?
2007-04-19T14:40:00.000Z	phil8080	djm62	yes I have the device is HDA Nvidia
2007-04-19T14:41:00.000Z	djm62	phil8080	have you had any noises out of it at all from ubuntu?
2007-04-19T14:41:00.000Z	phil8080	djm62	no, i'm running 7.04 by the way
2007-04-19T14:42:00.000Z	djm62	phil8080	is there a volume control applet in the top right of your screen (picture of a speaker)?
2007-04-19T14:42:00.000Z	phil8080	djm62	yes
2007-04-19T14:44:00.000Z	djm62	phil8080	I'll presume it's set to a reasonable volume.  let me have a dig around.  Can you go through the menu  "System->Preferences->Sound" and try the test buttons
2007-04-19T14:45:00.000Z	phil8080	djm62	yep, and test gives no sound
2007-04-19T14:47:00.000Z	djm62	phil8080	if you click on the box to the left of the test button you should have a choice of devices; I don't have the same hardware as you, so I can't tell what will be there, but can you try those options and test?
2007-04-19T14:53:00.000Z	phil8080	djm62	nothing, no sound
2007-04-19T14:54:00.000Z	djm62	phil8080	oh bum. what is the exact model of laptop?
