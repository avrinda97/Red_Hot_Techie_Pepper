2009-11-09T08:25:00.000Z	klem_	tryingtoboot	go to System --->Preferences----->Remote Desktop
2009-11-09T08:26:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	Thanks
2009-11-09T08:31:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	It only says I can share my desktop over local network.
2009-11-09T08:32:00.000Z	klem_	tryingtoboot	well, you need to share it on one machine, the on the other, go to Applications ----->Internet---->Remote Desktop Viewer
2009-11-09T08:33:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	What about Empathy?
2009-11-09T08:33:00.000Z	klem_	tryingtoboot	Not sure, let me look
2009-11-09T08:33:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	I want to do a support for someone who's not on my desktop
2009-11-09T08:33:00.000Z	tryingtoboot		you know, like TeamViewer, or iChat desktop share
2009-11-09T08:35:00.000Z	klem_	tryingtoboot	I don't see any option in Empathy about remote desktops
2009-11-09T08:35:00.000Z	tryingtoboot		Well it's a feature
2009-11-09T08:36:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	and it's a menu thing
2009-11-09T08:36:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	You right click a contact and it says "share my desktop"
2009-11-09T08:36:00.000Z	tryingtoboot	klem_	it just is grayed out
2009-11-09T08:37:00.000Z	klem_	tryingtoboot	well, I don't know then. I've never done it that way. I would use VNC or something.
