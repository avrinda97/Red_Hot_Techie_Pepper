2007-12-11T15:42:00.000Z	earlmred		you'd think the kernel would compile faster on a dual core 3.2 =\
2007-12-11T15:43:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	make -j8 ;)
2007-12-11T15:43:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	any way to include that in make-kpkg ?
2007-12-11T15:43:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	i'm relatively new to the whole "ubuntu" way of doing things.
2007-12-11T15:44:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	man make-kpkg
2007-12-11T15:45:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	you can "export CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=4"
2007-12-11T15:45:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	that should give you 4 threads
2007-12-11T15:45:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	apparently the -j option is dangerous in kernel builds"
2007-12-11T15:46:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	the man pages are your friends
2007-12-11T15:46:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	eh it's already going, i'll just let it do it's thing
2007-12-11T15:46:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	"man man" to get started
2007-12-11T15:47:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	yet there's no man woman.
2007-12-11T15:47:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	the mose useful thing to learn when using man pages is the "/keyword" style search
2007-12-11T15:47:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	then you can press "n" to find next occurrence
2007-12-11T15:48:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	i said i was new to ubuntu, not a retard =P
2007-12-11T15:48:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	right... not always clear from context whether people are new to linux or just to the ubuntu distro.. just trying to help ... ;)
2007-12-11T15:49:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	<3
2007-12-11T15:49:00.000Z	kling0n	earlmred	on the other hand, the fact you're building a kernel might have been a hint :D
2007-12-11T15:49:00.000Z	earlmred	kling0n	need stupid SLAB support for this creative module to /maybe/ work.
