2009-02-23T05:05:00.000Z	cappiz		someone knows of a utility that can read s.m.a.r.t data from a file?
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	you can't read SMART data from a file.. but the utility smartctl will give you the info for a drive.
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	smartctl -a /dev/hda
2009-02-23T05:06:00.000Z	cappiz	MoTec	i have the data in a file
2009-02-23T05:07:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	good luck
2009-02-23T05:09:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	if you can't read it with a text file i'm not sure what smart data you have..
2009-02-23T05:09:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	what i see generally looks like:  http://www.3ware.com/kb/attachments/smartmonexampleoutput.txt
2009-02-23T05:12:00.000Z	cappiz	MoTec	ah thanks :)
2009-02-23T05:12:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	is it just text? :)
2009-02-23T05:13:00.000Z	cappiz	MoTec	i get the status, temp etc.
2009-02-23T05:14:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	not sure.. sounds like it.
2009-02-23T05:15:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	the tools report on only one drive at a time, maybe that's why
2009-02-23T05:15:00.000Z	cappiz	MoTec	ok
2009-02-23T05:18:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	hehe, yep
2009-02-23T05:18:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	/dev/twa0 is the raid controller, or the virtual device the system sees that array as, I suppose.
2009-02-23T05:19:00.000Z	cappiz	MoTec	twa0 would be the unit on the controller :)
2009-02-23T05:20:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	yeah, but twa0 represents more than one drive.. thats's what the /device=3ware,1 ,2 is about
2009-02-23T05:21:00.000Z	cappiz	MoTec	yeah twa0 is the raid unit, and the --device=3ware,[N] would be the port on the controller and the disk attached to the [N] port :)
2009-02-23T05:22:00.000Z	MoTec	cappiz	makes sense :)
