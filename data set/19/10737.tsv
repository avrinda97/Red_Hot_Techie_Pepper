2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	untung	read your pm from ubotu
2006-06-25T14:14:00.000Z	Flannel	untung	it's 5.10, not 5.1, and gksudo update-manager should ask you if you want to upgrade, provided youre up to date
2006-06-25T14:15:00.000Z	untung	Flannel	I have downloaded the cd. how do i upgrade? just put a dics and install?
2006-06-25T14:15:00.000Z	Flannel	untung	well, you don't need the disk actually, it can do everything via apt/downloads

2006-06-25T14:16:00.000Z	untung	Flannel	how do i check the version of my current ubuntu?
2006-06-25T14:19:00.000Z	Flannel	untung	gksudo update-manager should ask you about upgrading.
2006-06-25T14:21:00.000Z	untung	Flannel	It's starting. Will it erase my data?
2006-06-25T14:22:00.000Z	untung	Flannel	Do you think it will be faster if i upgrade by cd instead of downloading from internet?
2006-06-25T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	untung	depends on your download speed, of course.  If you upgrade via apt, youll be completely up to date afterwards, via the CD, you'll still need to update some stuff.
2007-08-03T10:30:00.000Z	Flannel	untung	7.10 is still in alpha stages, 7.04 is the latest stable
