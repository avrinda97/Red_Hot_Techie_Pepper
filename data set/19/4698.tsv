2008-11-19T16:54:00.000Z	DaveKong		Is there some way to get better ATI graphic card support than just installing the proprietary driver? Such as using wine to run the windows drivers?
2008-11-19T16:54:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	Not really. Emulating almost never has any luck with hardware rendering
2008-11-19T16:55:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	Proprietary is best your going to get. You could also try the bleeding edge SVN versions but not worth the effort
2008-11-19T16:59:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	nVidia
2008-11-19T17:00:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	is your ATI _that_ bad ?
2008-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	movies are pretty choppy and look more Pixelated than they should, haven't tried playing any 3d intense games
2008-11-19T17:02:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	are the movies flickering ?
2008-11-19T17:03:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	yes they do now and then
2008-11-19T17:03:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	 not constantly
2008-11-19T17:03:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	Did you try disabling desktop effects ?
2008-11-19T17:04:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	I had them disabled before, I have them set to "Normal" atm
2008-11-19T17:05:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	I have problems with movies on my ATI card when effects are enabled
2008-11-19T17:05:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	ok I will try turning them off
2008-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	give it a go
2008-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	Turning down all the 3d settings and turning off effects seems to have improved videos though still skips a frame here and there
2008-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	Humm, I only have the problem with the effects enabled
2008-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	can't help you anymore than that :(
2008-11-19T17:09:00.000Z	DaveKong	daveStyle	ok your help is appreciated
2008-11-19T17:09:00.000Z	daveStyle	DaveKong	:)
