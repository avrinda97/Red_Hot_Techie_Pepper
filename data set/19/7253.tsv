2007-10-05T09:16:00.000Z	MrPink		can someone help a newb with his first tries at a mini shell script ?  Somehow it wont work right
2007-10-05T09:16:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	#bash for shell scripts
2007-10-05T09:17:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	I am not sure if it is the script problem... that is why I am here
2007-10-05T09:17:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	if your running a script and its not working - its a script problem
2007-10-05T09:17:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	when I run the script, it says that I don't have permission to edit the file... but chmod is set to 777
2007-10-05T09:18:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	put the script in a pastbin
2007-10-05T09:18:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	ok one sec
2007-10-05T09:19:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/m1c384759  as I said its not much of a script... it basically is supposed to downsize all images in the folder to half the size
2007-10-05T09:20:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	your missing "do
2007-10-05T09:28:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	so
2007-10-05T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	no, "jpg; do sudo convert blah blah"
2007-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	you wrote it
2007-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	your changing the size of all the jpeg images
2007-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	Yeah that is what it should do, but the size is the same as before
2007-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	run convert manually against one file then see what it does
2007-10-05T09:38:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	when I do it on one file it works...
2007-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	http://pastebin.com/m21fa12fb
2007-10-05T09:43:00.000Z	MrPink	ikonia	so it doesn't work to just replace the old files ?
2007-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPink	no idea, just took a glance at the man page, the new files should be resized for you
