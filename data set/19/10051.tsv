2006-08-05T07:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr		does anyone know if pdf is a format that can be "stretched" without distortion?
2006-08-05T07:08:00.000Z	|thunder	fyrestrtr	if you put a vector format image in it. yes
2006-08-05T07:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	|thunder	I've got to send this large poster type thing for printing, and its pdf. I wonder if that's good enough.
2006-08-05T07:09:00.000Z	|thunder	fyrestrtr	 is it just a full page in acrobat ?
2006-08-05T07:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	|thunder	yeah, and everytime I try to print it, it never prints "borderless" on my printer.
2006-08-05T07:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	|thunder	its a large linux oriented poster 'Anatomy of a Linux System' :)
2006-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	|thunder	fyrestrtr	is it this one ?  ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/poster/oreilly_linux_poster.pdf
2006-08-05T07:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	|thunder	yeah I think it is.
2006-08-05T07:16:00.000Z	|thunder	fyrestrtr	the text will be crisp. but the raster image in the middle will not
2006-08-05T07:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	|thunder	I can live with that.

2006-08-10T14:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	|thunder	you can set that up easily, I remember I had it going like that (although I quickly turned it off because I kept triggering it by mistake)
