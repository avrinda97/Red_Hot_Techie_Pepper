2007-11-22T04:06:00.000Z	Olde	ikonia	I have an external ZIP 100 drive...
2007-11-22T04:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	ok
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	mount it read-write
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	is it automounting ?
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	does it have a fat32 file system on it
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	Olde	ikonia	yes it does
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	ok, so it has no permissions on it, so its being mounted read only, re-mount it read write as a test with the mount -o rw options instead of mount
2007-11-22T04:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	mount -o rw rather than "mount"
2007-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	Olde	ikonia	so the text I type is /mount /dev/blahblahblah -o rw?
2007-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	not quite mount -o rw blah blah not the other way around
2007-11-22T04:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	you shouldn't have, ubuntu doesn't use root
2007-11-29T19:15:00.000Z	Olde	ikonia	you're helpful. is there a pluto client for ubuntu? if so what is it and where can I get it? :D
2007-11-29T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	no idea. never heard of pluto
2007-11-29T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Olde	irssi
