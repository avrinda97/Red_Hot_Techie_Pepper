2008-03-10T01:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 you did install the samba service? YOu do realize you normally dont want to have samba running over the internet?   as for the website. You did install the webserver?
2008-03-10T01:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 NOW you are giving some real info. :)   - does the services work locally?
2008-03-10T01:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	  sounds like the router, or firewall is blocking things then.
2008-03-10T02:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 you sure it aint somthing simple like the router gave the machne a different ip# recently?
2008-06-22T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 for spamming?
2008-06-22T19:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 you are refering to logging off of IRC?
2008-06-22T19:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 could be X crashing and restarting.
2008-06-22T19:15:00.000Z	lensy	Dr_Willis	is there anything i can do to stop x from crsching?
2008-06-22T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lensy	 check your video card/drivers/forums for the specific card for others with similer issues.
