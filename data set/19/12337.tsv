2011-03-16T19:36:00.000Z	e-head		hi, anyone here use rsync for backups?
2011-03-16T19:36:00.000Z	e-head		Particularly... for backing up the /home directories?
2011-03-16T19:37:00.000Z	sipior	e-head	what's your question, exactly?
2011-03-16T19:37:00.000Z	e-head		I was just wondering if anyone had a good exclude file that would leave out all the extraneous junk from the home directories.
2011-03-16T19:38:00.000Z	sipior	e-head	i tend to use "rm" to deal with extraneous junk in my home directory.
2011-03-16T19:38:00.000Z	e-head		I'm getting all sorts of warnings and errors about files that look like they are locked by the X-window system or something else.
2011-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	e-head		files like:  smb-network:-b2342e20
2011-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	sipior	e-head	this is in .gvfs?
2011-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	e-head		/gvfs-metadata/sftp:host=tabletennis.net,user=ebone
2011-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	e-head		yeah, that is a particularly problematic directory
2011-03-16T19:40:00.000Z	e-head	sipior	should I just basically look through the output and add stuff methodically to the --exclude switch?
2011-03-16T19:41:00.000Z	sipior	e-head	up to you what you want to keep. the .gvfs stuff can certainly be tossed. another possibility is just to whitelist the stuff you *do* want to keep. matter of taste.
2011-03-16T19:41:00.000Z	e-head		there are several .cache directories too.
2011-03-16T19:41:00.000Z	e-head	sipior	yeah, that's true.
2011-03-16T19:42:00.000Z	e-head		I was hoping someone had done all this for already and would have a nice exclude file I could include.
2011-03-16T19:42:00.000Z	e-head		;)
2011-03-16T19:42:00.000Z	e-head		Somebody probably has one posted on a blog somewhere, if I could only find it.
2011-03-16T19:43:00.000Z	sipior	e-head	well, the canonical backup blog entry: http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html
2011-03-16T19:43:00.000Z	e-head	sipior	awesome, thanks. I'll check it out.
