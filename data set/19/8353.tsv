2008-01-06T08:27:00.000Z	grekkos	Xintruder	were you planning on compiling something?
2008-01-06T08:28:00.000Z	grekkos	Xintruder	it was probably for the "emerge" utility on Gentoo
2008-01-06T08:28:00.000Z	grekkos	Xintruder	but i'm not positive i haven't used gentoo in a while

2008-01-06T08:36:00.000Z	grekkos	Xintruder	ok... from my personal experience i've never been able to get any programs working on there -- that's why i suggested dual boot. If you get it working though please tell me I'd like to try it out myself as well
