2004-09-11T08:33:00.000Z	thom	lamont	sawfish is written in lithp, so i'm sure you could work something out
2004-09-14T09:26:00.000Z	lamont	thom	why not just binNMU libapache2_mod_python?
2004-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	thom	lamont	need to sync apache2 anyway
2004-09-14T09:29:00.000Z	thom	lamont	subversion needs fixes from a2, so that should be fixed. and i'd prefer to keep python and php in sync whilst we still can
2004-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	lamont	thom	I _had_ DDR RAM, so I didn't buy more than the minimum when I bought the box.  sadly, that'd be registered vs unregistered or some such - my DDR was no good in the box...
2004-09-19T09:24:00.000Z	thom	lamont	eh? we don't want the Defaults <user> timeout=0 bit from base config
2004-09-19T09:24:00.000Z	lamont	thom	that's not what was actually done.
2004-09-24T15:19:00.000Z	lamont	thom	see - fat pipes just make you want _MORE_...
2004-09-25T16:25:00.000Z	lamont	thom	interesting
2004-09-25T08:09:00.000Z	lamont	thom	don'
2004-09-25T12:01:00.000Z	lamont	thom	there's a dfference?
2004-09-25T12:01:00.000Z	thom	lamont	according to base-config
2004-09-26T09:23:00.000Z	thom	lamont	yes
2004-09-26T13:02:00.000Z	thom	lamont	bog standard install
2004-09-26T13:02:00.000Z	lamont	thom	thought so.
2004-09-26T09:38:00.000Z	lamont	thom	are being fixed
2004-10-03T06:58:00.000Z	thom	lamont	elmo had to fix it first ;-)
2004-10-03T06:59:00.000Z	thom	lamont	it was the wrong key, previously
