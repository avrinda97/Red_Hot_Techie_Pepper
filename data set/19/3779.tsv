2009-05-30T15:49:00.000Z	midnajt	hippo	well for now I'm able to listen to tracks from Germany xD
2009-05-30T15:51:00.000Z	hippo	midnajt	Then be happy ! Maybe it's still free in Germany too. For me (Canada), it would cost $3/month now.

2009-05-30T15:52:00.000Z	midnajt	hippo	but affordable
2009-05-30T15:53:00.000Z	hippo	midnajt	actually, it's not free anymore, but in some countries, they consider that the publicity will pay enough, not here unfortunately.
2009-05-30T15:55:00.000Z	midnajt	hippo	con't you even listen to radio stations
2009-05-30T15:57:00.000Z	hippo	midnajt	we can still listen 30 songs/month for free ... as far as I know.
2009-05-30T15:58:00.000Z	midnajt	hippo	ok so then it could be that it ain't free here to cause I#m at 5th song right now
2009-05-30T16:00:00.000Z	hippo	midnajt	correct. My wife listens at work all the time and received an email today from lastfm. telling her that it was over for this month. They'll tell you.
