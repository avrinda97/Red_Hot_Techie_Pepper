2006-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	you need to fix those names... they aren't really linux friendly.  Try: cp -- foo bar
2006-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	follow cp by --, your dashes are confusing it
2006-04-05T08:39:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	url?
2006-04-05T08:43:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	that should work, try 'sudo umount /dev/sda2 && sudo mount /dev/sda2'
2006-04-05T08:50:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	what do you mean when you say you try to open it directly?
2006-04-05T08:53:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	in a terminal does it work if you do 'head /path/to/that/file/you/were/talking/about' ?
2006-04-05T08:56:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	ok well that means you can read the data fine.  Does 'file:///path/to/file' in firefox's url bar display it?
2006-04-05T08:59:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	hrmm it should work when you double click in nautilus, strange that it doesn't
2006-04-05T09:00:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	no
2006-04-05T09:01:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	it's working for me on my partition.  What url does firefox have in the address bar when you double click on the file?
2006-04-05T09:03:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	what is the difference between that one and the one you typed?
2006-04-05T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	when you double click, it doesn't work right?
2006-04-05T09:06:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	ok so can you paste both the url that works when you type it in yourself and the url that firefox has when you doubleclick?
2006-04-05T09:08:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	I mean here, so we can compare
2006-04-05T09:09:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	but the content of the address bar is exactly the same?
2006-04-05T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	mackey743	when you double click, somethign automatically gets inserted into the address bar.  Have you comapred what gets inserted with what you type in manually?
