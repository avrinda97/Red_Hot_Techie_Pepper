2011-05-31T23:06:00.000Z	boba		my ubuntu live cd does not recognize the existing partition table
2011-05-31T23:06:00.000Z	plum	boba	have you tried using testdisk? might need to recover your partitions
2011-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	boba	plum	is it available in the live cd
2011-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	plum	boba	it is not found there, no, but you can find the binary here: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2011-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	boba	plum	is it in hriens
2011-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	boba	plum	is it in hirens
2011-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	plum	boba	it needs to be run from terminal
2011-05-31T23:08:00.000Z	plum		not sure what you mean by hirens
2011-05-31T23:09:00.000Z	boba	plum	its only 64 bit for linux
2011-05-31T23:09:00.000Z	boba	plum	sorry my fault
2011-05-31T23:10:00.000Z	plum	boba	it works fine on my 32 bit ubuntu install, did you try it out?
2011-05-31T23:24:00.000Z	boba	plum	the thing is already formatted my previous ubuntu partition and now i cannot boot into an operating system, and tried to run the testdisk from the ubuntu live cd
2011-05-31T23:24:00.000Z	boba	plum	i formatted it using hirens
2011-05-31T23:25:00.000Z	plum	boba	so you are trying to recover your data?
2011-05-31T23:25:00.000Z	boba	plum	i am trying to install a newer ubuntu
2011-05-31T23:25:00.000Z	boba	plum	on the formatted previous ubuntu partion
2011-05-31T23:26:00.000Z	plum	boba	gotcha, so the issue you are having is ubuntu is not seeing that partition. is that correct?
2011-05-31T23:26:00.000Z	boba	plum	but i do not want to lose the windows partition and the data partition which are there but the ubuntu live cd does not see them
2011-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	plum	boba	so you didn't touch the windows partition when you formatted, correct? if so, testdisk should be able to detect the Windows OS on there
