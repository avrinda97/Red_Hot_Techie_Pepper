2011-05-04T02:16:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor		I need desperate Ubuntu help
2011-05-04T02:16:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor		I'm having some severe video driver issues
2011-05-04T02:16:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor		I installed a driver for my ATI card last night via command line
2011-05-04T02:16:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor		And, being a noob
2011-05-04T02:16:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor		I want to know how to remove it
2011-05-04T02:16:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	What's wrong?
2011-05-04T02:17:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	Is it a Debian package?
2011-05-04T02:18:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	It's OK, as long as you try to remember not to... Now, as for that video driver, do you know if it was a Debian package (.deb file)?
2011-05-04T02:20:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	Well, that's not good...
2011-05-04T02:20:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	I'll go do a bit of research and bet back to you.
2011-05-04T02:22:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	I found some instructions that might help. The first step is to run sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*
2011-05-04T02:23:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	Did you run that command that I told you to yet?
2011-05-04T02:24:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	OK. Please wait a second.
2011-05-04T02:26:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	OK. Please run the four commands specified here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602997/
2011-05-04T02:27:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor	cheapie	I'm getting "No such file or directory" with the first command
2011-05-04T02:28:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	That's OK. Just keep going with the others. Ignore any errors.
2011-05-04T02:31:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor	cheapie	Got errors on every single one of those commands.
2011-05-04T02:31:00.000Z	cheapie	TheBritishEditor	That's OK. Try rebooting and see if your issues go away.
2011-05-04T02:31:00.000Z	TheBritishEditor	cheapie	Alright.
