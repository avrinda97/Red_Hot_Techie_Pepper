2004-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	sly_alien		is the package servers down or something? :S
2004-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	sly_alien		hmm
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	sly_alien		well i cant seem to access them :/
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	TheMuso	sly_alien	You seem to be having the same prob as I did. You know there are australian Ubuntu package mirrors now?
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	sly_alien		there are?
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	sly_alien		:)
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	TheMuso		http://mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/ubuntu
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	sly_alien		nice thanks
2004-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	sly_alien		i'll try that out
2004-10-29T16:51:00.000Z	TheMuso	sly_alien	There may be others, but I know only of that one, as it is a free quota source for me.
2004-10-29T16:51:00.000Z	TheMuso		That should be quota free.
2004-10-29T16:52:00.000Z	sly_alien	TheMuso	yeah i've used that mirror before for other linux and it is fast for me :)
2004-10-29T16:53:00.000Z	sly_alien		should i even bother trying to install ati drivers?
2004-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	TheMuso		Depends on whether you want/need 3D acceleration. I am using the dsriver that comes with X on my laptop, as I don't need 3D.
2004-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	sly_alien		hmm i cant even get to the security mirror :/
2004-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	TheMuso		I simply used the pacific line I gave you before for security as well and that seemed to work.
2004-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	sly_alien		ah i can use that aswell ok
2004-10-29T16:55:00.000Z	sly_alien	TheMuso	what would the mirror for security be?
2004-10-29T16:56:00.000Z	TheMuso	sly_alien	Just replace the security.ubuntu.com portion of the line with mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/ubuntu
