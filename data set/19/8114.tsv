2007-05-03T05:35:00.000Z	rbs-tito	concord	You need to be more specific ;)
2007-05-03T05:36:00.000Z	concord	rbs-tito	It's an issue with the " gksu "update-manager -c -d"
2007-05-03T05:36:00.000Z	concord	rbs-tito	it gives me a gpg error.
2007-05-03T05:40:00.000Z	rbs-tito	concord	Go for a clean install, the download is just as big
2007-05-03T05:40:00.000Z	concord	rbs-tito	you mean save my /home directory and just install over?
2007-05-03T05:41:00.000Z	rbs-tito	concord	Pretty much
2007-05-03T05:53:00.000Z	concord	rbs-tito	it looks like my /home directory is not on a separate partition.  Got any ideas?
2007-05-03T05:54:00.000Z	rbs-tito	concord	Erm, back it up to anything.
2007-05-03T05:56:00.000Z	rbs-tito	concord	Yeah, tar it if you want. Or set up a temporary dual boo
