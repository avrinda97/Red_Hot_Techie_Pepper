2008-05-21T11:32:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	icecast
2008-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	broadcasts like shoutcast?
2008-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	i'm not sure, maybe
2008-05-21T11:34:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	thanks, dude, i'll check it out, peace
2008-06-05T14:06:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	it's a linux kernel that's compiled for modern processors, both single-core and multi-core. that's why. the -386 version is made to run on 386 processors and so on.
2008-06-05T14:07:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	"symmetric multi processing", support for more than one core
2008-06-05T14:07:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	I have a quadcore, should i check that out?
2008-06-05T14:08:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	the -generic kernel is installed by default unless you do something to change it
2008-06-05T16:46:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	the server kernel image optimizes your quad-core performance just as much as the -generic kernel, really.
2008-06-05T16:49:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	it was suggested, in that it optimized the communication between the hardware and the kernel
2008-06-05T16:49:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	the "generic" kernel does that too. why would anyone disable such a feature?
2008-06-05T16:49:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	how would that disable it?
2008-06-05T16:50:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	you don't. it's not disabled. really.
2008-06-05T16:50:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	the generic kernel is on the distro CD's so that it has a broader compatibility range
2008-06-05T16:52:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	myself having a x86/64bit  quadcore setup, would it not be more beneficial? my question is, will that affect x or kde?
2008-06-05T16:53:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	neither the -server or the -generic will assume a quad-core system. they both will detect your type of processor and support and adjust too it. the -server kernel is SLOWER for desktop use and will make kde slower to focus on the network server tasks.
2008-06-05T16:53:00.000Z	theFATMAN	magnetron	http://beginlinux.com/index.php/desktop_training/ubuntu/ubfile_m/ub_kernel
2008-06-05T16:57:00.000Z	magnetron	theFATMAN	how many times must i answer your question before you trust me? Ubuntu does NOT try to make your computer slower by installing the -generic kernel. REALLY. the -server kernel will run slower on your desktop computer. instead it wil focus on server tasks, as serving web pages.
