2007-02-10T17:23:00.000Z	tha_toadman		question for the gallery....why would my ubuntu 6.10 alternate ISO have trouble detecting a SATA hard drive?
2007-02-10T13:02:00.000Z	tha_toadman		i'm trying to run ubuntu on a sata but the drive isn't detected...should i be safe and use an IDE drive??
2007-02-10T13:02:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	 check the bios I would think
2007-02-10T13:03:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: i have the bios in 'compatiblity mode' on and it proceeds in the install but when it gets to the drive, nothing works...
2007-02-10T13:04:00.000Z	tha_toadman		i've even used 'achi' and 'ata_piix' modes...which sata drives are suppose to work with but it still dies on the install at that point
2007-02-10T13:04:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	 try this,  open up the comp and unplug the ide drive, leaving only the sata,  see if it gets detected and you can proceed with the install
2007-02-10T13:05:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: i have an ide dvd+r drive (pata) and a WD hard drive (sata)
2007-02-10T13:05:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: i need the dvd+rw drive to install linux on it
2007-02-10T13:06:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	 sorry from what you were saying I thouht you had two drives ? what's the ide one then ?
2007-02-10T13:06:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: the ide one is my dvd+rw, the sata drive is my hard drive
2007-02-10T13:07:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	so you are telling me that your hd isn'T being detected for installation ?
2007-02-10T13:07:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: i'm frustrated to the point where i think i'm going to just use an IDE hard drive instead...nothing works but i've heard that linux has bad sata suppose
2007-02-10T13:07:00.000Z	tha_toadman		*support
2007-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: yes - that's correct
2007-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	 I have ubuntu isnatlled on a sata drive and I have no problems
2007-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	 in  the live cd goto  menu > system > admin > gparted and check if your sata drive is being recognises
2007-02-10T13:09:00.000Z	tha_toadman	soundray	that's what i don't get - i have an ICH7 northbridge but i'm not sure about the controller
2007-02-10T13:09:00.000Z	tha_toadman		pelo: i was using the alternate ISO
2007-02-10T13:09:00.000Z	Pelo	tha_toadman	 this is over my head then
