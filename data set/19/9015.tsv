2012-07-26T03:04:00.000Z	studio		nkei0:can i unite  a flash usb drive and a harddrive to perform as one thing?
2012-07-26T03:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 one thing? you mean have one file system that spans both devices?
2012-07-26T03:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 dare we ask why?
2012-07-26T03:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 why are you wanting to 'combine' the filesystems? You do realize you can just Mount the USB to any directory you want to.. and access it as if it was a normal directory?
2012-07-26T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 'take the file' ? reading a file will take time.. USB is much slower then a hard drive..
2012-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 Im not clear on why you are wanting to do all this..   You want to Install an APP to your usb flash.. install how exactly?
2012-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 what app?
2012-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	  photoshop is a windows app.. If you are wanting to use wine to start it. You would put the photoshop exe on the flash and use 'wine /path/to/flash/whatever.exe'  normally
2012-07-26T03:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 the usb gets mounted to a directory on the system like /media/USB-DISK  use it as you would any other folder.
2012-07-26T03:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 or extract/install it in your .wine directory by default and copy the install dir over to the usb perhaps. I dont use phtoshop.
2012-07-26T03:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 I think you are confuseing things...
2012-07-26T03:29:00.000Z	studio	Dr_willis	why's that
2012-07-26T03:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 i think you need to clarify EXACTLY what you are trying to do.
2012-07-26T03:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 you plan on removeing the USB flash at some time?
2012-07-26T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 i dont see what you are planing on gaining by all this.. or what you are accessing that needs this to be done.
2012-07-26T03:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 use a live cd like the 'gparted' live cd - to do disk resizeing that way no filesystems are mounted.
2012-07-26T03:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 also windows7 can shrink its own partitons faster i find then the linux tools can.
2012-07-26T04:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 located to? if you open it.. its getting read from the NTFS partition..
2012-07-26T04:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	studio	 if you mean wheres the NTFS filesystmes mountpoint.. if  its mounted on the fly by the user via gnome. it should be in the .gvfs directroy somewhere
