2011-08-19T16:26:00.000Z	zagibu		but this is old info, so maybe it has changed lately
2011-08-19T16:27:00.000Z	zagibu		hmmm, it's interesting, though, they are currently looking for a senior software dev to port games to linux...
2011-08-19T16:29:00.000Z	zagibu		and maybe it only covers the server parts of the games, which are already running under linux for some
2011-08-19T16:29:00.000Z	zagibu		maybe you should loosen your undies a bit, they seem to fit too tightly
2011-08-19T16:31:00.000Z	zagibu		download a 32bit live cd and see for yourself
2011-08-19T16:32:00.000Z	zagibu		personally, i still get odd problems with 64bit linux from time to time
2011-08-19T16:33:00.000Z	szal	zagibu	such as?
2011-08-19T16:34:00.000Z	zagibu		really strange things, such as really bad wifi reception on a fresh install, some 3d programs that crash a lot, etc
2011-08-19T16:34:00.000Z	zagibu		and yes, the wifi reception is much better on a fresh install of the exactly same distro but the 32bit version

2011-08-19T16:35:00.000Z	zagibu		inode is a trademark of apple, please don't use it in public chat
2011-08-19T16:36:00.000Z	szal	zagibu	you gotta be kidding..
2011-08-19T16:36:00.000Z	zagibu		sure, man
2011-08-19T16:37:00.000Z	zagibu	Traintop	well, I'm not sure, i think it mainly has to do with drivers...at least all my problems seem to involve some dedicated hardware like network adapters, gpu or audio device
2011-08-19T16:37:00.000Z	zagibu		i'd say if you don't have over 4gb ram, there is not much benefit from 64bit
2011-08-19T16:38:00.000Z	szal	zagibu	in practice the limit seems to be 3 GB
2011-08-19T16:38:00.000Z	zagibu		yeah, you lose a bit of your 4gb, but not that much
2011-08-19T16:39:00.000Z	szal	zagibu	apart from that, PAE exists, extending RAM addressability to 64 GB
