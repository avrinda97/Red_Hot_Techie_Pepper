2009-01-22T08:13:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	the latest one? (1.1.0)
2009-01-22T07:59:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	ask away and if people know the answer they will probably answer...
2009-01-22T08:05:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	they can still detect the type of trafic it is from examining the packets
2009-01-22T08:05:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	so, is there any way to avoid this?
2009-01-22T08:08:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	you could try forcing the use of encryption, but there are still ways that they can guess what the packets are or they could simply shape everything but a whitelist set of packets (and it might not even be the problem)
2009-01-22T08:09:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	I'm using encryption, and in windows, I get great speed.  I think my ISP osn't to blame.  Also, I've called about port forwarding, they even helped me set it up, surprisingly.  It's DSL, and my bandwidth is personal, it wouldn't affect anyone else.
2009-01-22T08:11:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	did you catch my last post?
2009-01-22T08:12:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	the speed is also dependant on the ratio of seeders to leachers - are you comparing similar torrents? and what client are you using?
2009-01-22T08:13:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	 it appears that I don't have the repository for it either, cos it never updated
2009-01-22T08:14:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	the one is the repository is ancient and there is no repository for it as far as i know - just download the .deb package from the site (thats what ive done and i dont have any speed issues)
2009-01-22T08:15:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	thanks, I'm trying it now.
2009-01-22T08:18:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	i tried installing the .deb for ubuntu ibex amd64 and got a failed to install error.
2009-01-22T08:19:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	what error do you get?
2009-01-22T08:20:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	it wouldn't let me copy the code in the terminal :?
2009-01-22T08:21:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	don't know why it does that...
2009-01-22T08:24:00.000Z	miranda_psi	unused_bagels	deluge is the bets one I have found to date and i am always trying different ones - the next best is ktorrent and you can always resort to utorrent under wine
2009-01-22T08:25:00.000Z	unused_bagels	miranda_psi	I liked utorrent in windows.  _Vi_ : Why won't it let me update the program? I keep trying to install the new package.  Should I uninstall?
