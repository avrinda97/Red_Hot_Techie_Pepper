2008-04-05T09:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 its should be a normal /dev/sd## type device. Mount it as you would an ide drive.
2008-04-05T09:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!mount | happis
2008-04-05T09:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 if its a ntfs filesystem check out  the following
2008-04-05T09:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!ntfs-3g | happis
2008-04-05T09:14:00.000Z	happis		its not formated
2008-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 is it even partioned?
2008-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	happis		Maybe in shop
2008-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 you dont mount a filesystem thats not formated. since its not a filesystem yet. :)
2008-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	happis	Dr_willis	it works at windows
2008-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 then it IS formated for windows...
2008-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	happis		Yes
2008-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 if its a ntfs windows filesystem, you can use the ntfs-3g stuff to read/write to it.
2008-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	happis		how
2008-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!ntfs-3g | happis
2008-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!mount | happis
2008-04-05T09:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	happis	 an example fstab entry for MY ntfs drive is -->  UUID=96240BAE240B9103 /media/vistaboot ntfs    defaults,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
