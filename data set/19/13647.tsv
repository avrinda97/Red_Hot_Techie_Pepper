2005-03-11T10:16:00.000Z	delltony		is there a way to roll back to a another kernal image if one doesn't work?
2005-03-11T10:16:00.000Z	delltony		yeah :(
2005-03-11T10:17:00.000Z	delltony		well ig uess it got deleted
2005-03-11T10:17:00.000Z	delltony		cause i only have 686 in there
2005-03-11T10:17:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	hit 'esc' when it asks during boot... and choose another?
2005-03-11T16:16:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	just use the command line tool  :)
2005-03-11T16:17:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	no... 'mplayer'
2005-03-11T16:17:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	configure via '/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf'
2005-03-11T16:24:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	its in multiverse
2005-03-11T16:26:00.000Z	delltony	lunitik	you have the exact thing to add to sources.list by chance? all i see in terms of multiverse is the backports
2005-03-11T16:27:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	the line that states 'universe' in sources.list... add multiverse
2005-03-11T16:29:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	should work... I don't usually have the 'us' part though  :/
2005-03-11T16:30:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	yup... that works
2005-03-11T17:42:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	almost all mplayer GUI's are crippled at the moment (gmplayer, kplayer, kmplayer)
2005-04-09T14:32:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	it depends on the HSync and VSync values...
2005-04-09T14:32:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	look into those
2005-04-09T14:34:00.000Z	delltony	lunitik	i have this
2005-04-09T14:35:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	eh... this isn't something you can guess... look into your monitor manual...
2005-04-09T14:36:00.000Z	lunitik	delltony	also, please note its considered bad for your eyes to have greater than 60mhz ...
