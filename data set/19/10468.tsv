2006-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	Gradius9		what about firewalls in ubuntu it has a stanard built in and its on from installation?
2006-06-12T10:10:00.000Z	rapha	Gradius9	Ubuntu doesn't need a firewall in its default config since there are no services enabled whatsoever.
2006-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	rapha	Gradius9	when you install servers it is assumed that you also know how to install a firewall.
2006-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	Gradius9	rapha	going to open up for samba externally / vnc internally / ssh externally
2006-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	Gradius9	rapha	Just know the ON button i windows
2006-06-12T10:12:00.000Z	rapha	Gradius9	feel safe in Ubuntu unless you've knowingly installed a web server or something.
2006-06-12T10:12:00.000Z	Gradius9	rapha	thanks, guess I will figure it out when I am at it.. just preparing for the install...
2006-06-12T10:12:00.000Z	rapha	Gradius9	if you're a sucker for security you might want to build up a dedicated firewall box using OpenBSD (openbsd.org)
2006-06-12T10:13:00.000Z	Gradius9	rapha	My router has a pretty ok firewall also...
2006-06-12T10:13:00.000Z	rapha	Gradius9	in that case :-)
2006-06-12T10:13:00.000Z	Gradius9	rapha	and the network is only between my own machines.
