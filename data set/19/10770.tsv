2010-08-05T21:42:00.000Z	scott__		ok this thing can't be any more difficult. I can't get my recovery console to show because the frakking graphics won't work. Xorg is hosed and I can't get to any point ppl are telling me to fix it. HELP!!!! I am stuck in 800x600 resolution on a 1920x1600 screen!!!!!!
2010-08-05T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	that low resolution is usable to fix the issue
2010-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	first of all, what video card do you have ?
2010-08-05T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	what exact video card do you have
2010-08-05T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	ok - so this is a laptop ?
2010-08-05T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	ok, can you open a terminal on your messed up resolution ?
2010-08-05T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	(I assume this is a 10.04 install)
2010-08-05T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	great, first to "ls -la /etc/X11/xorg.conf" does it return a file ?
2010-08-05T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	that's good
2010-08-05T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	so what you need is a very basic xorg configuration and then to force the xorg.conf to use the "intel" driver
2010-08-05T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	if you do an "sudo init 1" it will drop you into single user mode and you can then do your xorg -configure line
2010-08-05T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	correct
2010-08-05T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	in that case hang on
2010-08-05T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	darn, I've not got my intel one to hand, you need someone in here with a generic /etc/X11/xorg.conf to pastebin it fo ryou, so you can put it on your box and use it as a bass
2010-08-05T21:59:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	you may also get one from the guys in the #xorg channel
2011-02-14T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	#ubuntu+1 for 11.04
2011-02-14T02:38:00.000Z	scott__	ikonia	okay, I'll go to that channel.  Thanks
2011-05-01T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	scott__	it may be talking about a different package, not the one you are trying to install
2011-05-01T17:52:00.000Z	scott__	ikonia	when I scrolled through the details, I got this " dpkg: error processing grub-pc (--configure):
