2009-04-25T00:46:00.000Z	schmrz		Hello everyone. Just a small question... How do you set the network interface in the dsl-provider file?
2009-04-25T00:46:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	"dsl-provider file"?
2009-04-25T00:47:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	yes the peer file configured for a dsl connection
2009-04-25T00:47:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	Do you mean you want to edit /etc/network/interfaces ?
2009-04-25T00:47:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	No I want to edit /etc/ppp/peers/dsl-provider
2009-04-25T00:48:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	schmrz I don't know of a dsl-provider file.
2009-04-25T00:49:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	What are  you trying to do?  Establish pppoe connection?  or....?
2009-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	I know how to configure a pppoe connection using pppoeconf, but I have a weird cable modem and I can't detect any Access concentrators. That is why I need to manualy edit the provider file (/etc/ppp/dsl-provider)
2009-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	vim /etc/ppp/dsl-provider
2009-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	sudo vim /etc/ppp/dsl-provider
2009-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	Are you joking me?
2009-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	No
2009-04-25T00:55:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	I know how to open the file but I don't know how to set which interface is going to be used for the connection...
2009-04-25T00:57:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	Maybe you should start by telling us what it's doing (or not doing).
2009-04-25T00:58:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	I think that those that can help allready know what peers files are for...
2009-04-25T01:00:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	Well, you would have to provide more information. We can not answer a question as general as "How do I edit my /etc/ppp/dsl-provider file"
2009-04-25T01:00:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	You didn't read my question properly.
2009-04-25T01:00:00.000Z	usr13_	schmrz	How would you answer a question like that?  You will need to provide more specific information, or ask a specific question.
2009-04-25T01:01:00.000Z	schmrz	usr13_	You should really read the question first...
