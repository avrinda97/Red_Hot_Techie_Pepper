2010-04-02T11:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	You won't be using your WAN (public internet) address for file sharing ;)
2010-04-02T11:49:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	Not quite sure what that means...
2010-04-02T11:50:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	will you be using any windows pcs?
2010-04-02T11:51:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	Maybe eventually.  I'm most concerned with my ubuntu laptop, but it'd be fun to set it up for my roommates, too (a mac and a windows pc).  This is mostly for music sharing.
2010-04-02T11:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	On the Host, the machine with the external hdd, how do you connect to the Internet?
2010-04-02T11:53:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	Ethernet directly into wireless router.
2010-04-02T11:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	You feel like doing some reading?
2010-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	Sure.  Especially if it's directions.  My tech-speak-fu ain't that great.
2010-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	look here first: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
2010-04-02T11:56:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	 Already did that.  I can get into Windows Network, but it says "Unable to mount location.  Failed to retrieve share list from server.
2010-05-24T08:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	is the file executable?
2010-05-24T08:45:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	Yes.  I can run it from the src/ directory.  How can I run it from the command line?
2010-05-24T08:46:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	yeah, ls -la the file you are trying to execute, you should see rwx-rx-rx or sume such...
2010-05-24T08:46:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	 it's the x's that count.
2010-05-24T08:47:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	-rwxr-xr-x  And it's green.
2010-05-24T08:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	then you should be good. I have to log out of r a minute or two - libnotify erros
2010-05-24T08:49:00.000Z	Monona	greezmunkey	Yeah, I just want to be able to run from command line.  Thank you, tho.
2010-05-24T08:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Monona	sorry about that...
