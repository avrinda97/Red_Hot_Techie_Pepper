2012-05-05T19:34:00.000Z	minas		hi. I recently upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04. After upgrading, the "hibernate" option has dissappeared... Does anyone know a fix for that?
2012-05-05T19:36:00.000Z	stefg	minas	first check that /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume has the UUID for your swap partition (get that by sudo blkid)
2012-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	minas	stefg	That's what I get: /dev/sda1: LABEL="SYSTEM" UUID="58E82BA8E82B837C" TYPE="ntfs"
2012-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	minas		/dev/sda2: LABEL="WINDOWS" UUID="181E32711E324850" TYPE="ntfs"
2012-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	minas		/dev/sda5: UUID="57a2b277-23b7-46a4-8173-c692dd0dc6e7" TYPE="swap"
2012-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	minas		/dev/sda6: UUID="0465889c-8bbe-4f44-88bd-8c48874d91f0" TYPE="swap"
2012-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	minas		/dev/sda7: UUID="60631435-2cfb-444c-8c26-969db9b5ea75" TYPE="ext4"
2012-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	minas		/dev/sda8: UUID="0ba45e58-ce46-4ba3-a772-38e737bf8a91" TYPE="swap"
2012-05-05T19:38:00.000Z	stefg	minas	i doubt there's any sensible reason in having 3 swap partitions on the same disk ...
2012-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	minas	stefg	I'm sorry, I don't even know what a swap partition is
2012-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	stefg	minas	you should have a complete backup of your windows and linux installation and clean up the mess before going any further
2012-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	minas		ActionParsip: Oh, I see
2012-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	minas	stefg	Ok, so do I have to remove the two of the three?
2012-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	stefg		!swap | minas
2012-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	stefg	minas	right ...
2012-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	stefg	minas	how much ram do you have ?
2012-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	minas	stefg	Ok, I will read the link that obuttu has sent me for now
2012-05-05T19:56:00.000Z	minas	stefg	It seems that I have three partitions (although I don't know if they are partitions or files) but the total size is 3.9 GB (same as my RAM). I think that's ok right?
2012-05-05T19:57:00.000Z	minas	stefg	(for swap)
