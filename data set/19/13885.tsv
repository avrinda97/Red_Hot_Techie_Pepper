2004-12-23T14:50:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	i used to use timidity, you can compile it
2004-12-23T14:51:00.000Z	Quest-Master	paradoxmo	Were you able to find any solution for the many threads I posted here?
2004-12-23T14:53:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	can you tell me how you get to the ftp server through nautilus?
2004-12-23T14:54:00.000Z	Quest-Master	paradoxmo	Just do it like this
2004-12-23T14:56:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	i think it should have something called ftp with login?
2004-12-23T14:56:00.000Z	Quest-Master	paradoxmo	Still opens everything in read-only
2004-12-23T14:59:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	i don't. it works for me.
2004-12-23T14:59:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	do you know what kind of FTP server it is?
2004-12-23T15:00:00.000Z	Quest-Master	paradoxmo	Nope. It worked fine a few days ago and still works fine in Windows.
2004-12-23T15:00:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	wow. a few days ago. did you upgrade anything?
2004-12-23T15:01:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	that is so odd.
2004-12-23T15:03:00.000Z	Quest-Master	paradoxmo	I desperately hope this works.
2004-12-23T15:08:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	that's so. odd. i have no idea.
2005-01-04T16:04:00.000Z	paradoxmo	Quest-Master	eject mount-point
