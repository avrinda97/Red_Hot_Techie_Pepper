2009-09-21T22:16:00.000Z	Snerf		I have 9.04 desktop setup, and I am trying to disable the screen saver from kicking in, and no matter what options I set, it comes back in 2 hours, any help appreciated
2009-09-21T22:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 i recall having to disable dpms ages ago to get that effect.. but i dont recall the details.
2009-09-21T22:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	  could try '   xset -dpms  '
2009-09-21T22:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 is it the screensaver kicking in.. or the monitor powering off?
2009-09-21T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 dpms hsa several modes.. it could be kicking in a low power mode.. befor it powers off.
2009-09-21T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 try that setting and see I guess.  it wont hurt.
2009-09-21T22:21:00.000Z	Snerf	Dr_Willis	when doing 'xset -dpms' it returns saying "unable to open display"
2009-09-21T22:26:00.000Z	Snerf	Dr_Willis	when doing 'xset -dpms' it returns saying "unable to open display"
2009-09-21T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 run it as the user that ran X.. not as root or any other user I guess
2009-09-21T22:27:00.000Z	Snerf	Dr_Willis	, same error
2009-09-21T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 it works fine here..
2009-09-21T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 open a new terminal and try it?
2009-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	Snerf	Dr_Willis	, ok, ran it in a terminal and that ran fine.
2009-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 how else were  You trying to run it? from the console? that wouldent work. :)
2009-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 unless you set the DISPLAy variable first..
2009-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 X fundamentals.
2009-09-21T22:41:00.000Z	Snerf	Dr_Willis	. so is that all I need to do, and just want and see?
2009-09-21T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Snerf	 unless you can think of some othet way to test it. :) i sure cant.
