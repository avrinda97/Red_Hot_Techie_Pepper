2011-12-03T08:21:00.000Z	Vosko		Does anyone here have experience installing ubuntu through PXE?
2011-12-03T08:21:00.000Z	Vosko		Because I am having problems :((
2011-12-03T08:23:00.000Z	Vosko		Ubuntu loads through PXE, says install ubuntu, loads a new interface where it says Select your language. And there it's stuck.
2011-12-03T08:23:00.000Z	boolean	Vosko	r u getting an IP from bootp or the option to add an ip manually?
2011-12-03T08:23:00.000Z	Vosko		bootp
2011-12-03T08:24:00.000Z	Vosko		why boolean?
2011-12-03T08:25:00.000Z	boolean		if i am correct, it might not downloaded the full install from network ... therefore it might be loosing its ip address and the load of the install failes
2011-12-03T08:25:00.000Z	boolean		by obtaining the ip address of the device you are trying, you can continuously ping it to rule it out
2011-12-03T08:26:00.000Z	Vosko		err...
2011-12-03T08:27:00.000Z	boolean		isnt there an install shell that runs paralel to X installer? ... you ALT over to that and see if you have access
2011-12-03T08:33:00.000Z	Vosko	boolean	so what do you suggest (Sorry i lost connection)
