2012-09-27T16:58:00.000Z	Pazzie		hi all, i have a small thing with samba, i created a share with samba and no i want to open it on my windows system but it keeps asking me for a username and password, and i dont want that
2012-09-27T17:00:00.000Z	excervo	Pazzie	yu can automount it with username and password remembered
2012-09-27T17:01:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	that is not what i want, i want to keep it very simple (since i am the only person using it) i dont want to use a username and pass
2012-09-27T17:02:00.000Z	excervo	Pazzie	where is samba shared located?
2012-09-27T17:03:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	hold on i will make a pastbin for you so you will understand it better
2012-09-27T17:05:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1230372/
2012-09-27T17:19:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	are you still here?
2012-09-27T17:22:00.000Z	excervo	Pazzie	do u want to access samba folder without credentials?
2012-09-27T17:22:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	yes like this: http://www.debuntu.org/guest-file-sharing-with-samba
2012-09-27T17:24:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	nevermind i have solved it allready
2012-09-27T17:24:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	thnx anyway
2012-09-27T17:26:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	no i had to do security = share instead of user that was the trick
2012-09-27T17:26:00.000Z	excervo	Pazzie	ok thanks
2012-09-27T17:28:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	now i can access the data on my unbuntu system without credentials (since its my private network)
2012-09-27T17:28:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	and because i am lazy offcourse ;)
2012-09-27T17:30:00.000Z	excervo	Pazzie	that was a good idea
2012-09-27T17:32:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	thnx
2012-09-27T17:34:00.000Z	Pazzie	excervo	now i can copy my data, because i want to change from windows media server to ubuntu media server (because i think it will preform even better then my windows system does, with less resources
2012-09-27T17:40:00.000Z	excervo	Pazzie	you're right linux is faster
