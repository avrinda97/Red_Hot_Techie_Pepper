2006-11-26T09:01:00.000Z	stdundon		Hi, anybody have experience with both Gentoo and Ubuntu?
2006-11-26T09:01:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	yeh
2006-11-26T09:01:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	How does upgrading in Ubuntu work out?
2006-11-26T09:02:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	I know that they release every 6 months, but can you just do an 'emerge -auvD world' kind of thing?
2006-11-26T09:02:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	Alot easier/faster than gentoo, although im not so sure about upgrading from one release version to another
2006-11-26T09:03:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	You update your repositories (basicly emerge --sync) then use synaptic to update the newer packages
2006-11-26T09:03:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	but still as flexible?  If I can just upgrade all of my packages, I guess I don't care about what it's named
2006-11-26T09:03:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	great.  So, as a desktop you would recommend it over Gentoo?
2006-11-26T09:04:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	(I'm already downloading the iso
2006-11-26T09:04:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	Yeh, gentoos updating is rairly unstable and because its source it takes ages to compile
2006-11-26T09:04:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	Gentoo does have alot of newer packages and its much more customizable
2006-11-26T09:05:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	very true.  My libraries got screwed up toady, b/c I had to use a 32bit chroot to install flash with firefox.  Now I'm ready for something new
2006-11-26T09:05:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	sounds great.  Well, I'm off to watch Blade Runner while I d/l, but I thank you for your experience
2006-11-26T09:05:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	take care
2006-11-26T09:05:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	I recomend avoiding amd64 based Ubuntu, although i did manage to get flash running with nppluginwrapper
2006-11-26T09:06:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	stdundon	nps
2006-11-26T09:06:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	lol
2006-11-26T09:06:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	well, heck, I think it's recommended to avoid using a Linux desktop on amd64, no1 seems to do it well yet, but I'll give it a try
2006-11-26T09:08:00.000Z	stdundon	H3g3m0n	lol. exactly
