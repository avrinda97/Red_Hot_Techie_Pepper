2005-12-20T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	the msg you just got should help with reading your ntfs partition
2005-12-20T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	try hitting clt-l
2005-12-20T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	check to be sure you got the right deb from opera
2005-12-20T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	I did aptitutde install libqt3-mt xlibs , and opera*shared*etch installed fine
2005-12-20T10:11:00.000Z	Nameeater	nickrud	wierd, i haev both those packages and it still died :)
2005-12-20T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	and opera sure looks different to me now :)
2005-12-20T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	not by default, no
2005-12-20T10:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	add multiverse to every line that has universe in it
2005-12-20T10:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	the package I got for ubuntu was opera_8.51-20051114.6-shared-qt_en_etch_i386.deb

2006-03-23T07:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	see above ^
2006-03-23T07:32:00.000Z	Nameeater	nickrud	thanks, its locking up the sytem when it runs, tho I'm wondering if the HDD is on the blink :/
2006-03-23T07:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	I start work at 7:30, which is when anacron starts up updatedb ; personally it's an annoyance until I alter anacron's start time but it never locked up anything
2006-03-23T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	maybe, um a silly question: you do have dma enabled (I get bit by this on every install)
2006-03-23T07:38:00.000Z	Nameeater	nickrud	I have no idea, but it hasnt done this before and I think it is doing it on windows now
2006-03-23T07:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	check out smartmontools , they report potential disk failures
2006-03-23T07:42:00.000Z	Nameeater	nickrud	thanks
2006-03-23T07:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Nameeater	may you have the same results I did: nothing wrong :)
