2005-11-23T07:08:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	exactly
2005-11-23T07:08:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	thats what im tryting to tell Brunellus , ext3 is more stable
2005-11-23T07:13:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	a filesystem contributed to the kernel by Silicon Graphics. It works best with extremely large files
2005-11-23T07:13:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	ah ok, thanks
2005-11-25T06:52:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	You don't want to copy /usr if you reinstall. Different versions are not guaranteed to keep binary compatibility
2005-11-25T06:53:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	ah i see thats too bad
2005-11-25T06:53:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	keep /home on a different partition and that will keep most app settings.
2005-11-25T06:53:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	yes
2005-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	I have hda3 as /home. but and if my hda1 crashes or gets wiped, I can reinstall breeze and have system run as before?  Yet I would lose all new apps that I had installed?
2005-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	You would lose all additional apps you installed before, yes
2005-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	But the main system doesn't change much
2005-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	hmm ok thanks
2005-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	ok
2005-11-25T06:55:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	And it's a simple apt-get or point click in synaptic away
2005-11-25T06:55:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	I guess I could make a folder and rsync the whole drive to it as  backup :)
2005-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	SEJeff	lightbright	Use this: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbackup/
2005-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	ok ty
2005-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	lightbright	SEJeff	what I am doing is I created 2 partisions on my hdb.  Then I am going to rsync the whole hda1 to hdb1 and hda2 to hdb2, and if something goes wrong, I simply rsynv back and restore :)
