2010-02-11T19:24:00.000Z	crunchbang		hi Seveas
2010-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	crunchbang		thanx for the advice
2010-02-11T19:26:00.000Z	crunchbang		is crunch the same as ubuntu? as in under the hood?
2010-02-11T19:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 I belive so
2010-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 you can install normal ubuntu pacakges  on it.
2010-08-16T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 watch out for grub1 and grub2 differances..  if you did a clean install of 9.04 you should be using grub2.
2010-08-16T17:56:00.000Z	crunchbang	Dr_Willis	its Crunchbang linux with 9.04..
2010-08-16T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 normally first hd is hd0, first partition used tio also be # 0. BUT with grub2 it changed to 1. I think..
2010-08-16T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 so how many hard drives do you have?
2010-08-16T17:57:00.000Z	crunchbang	Dr_Willis	one for Linux, then a second for Win7
2010-08-16T17:58:00.000Z	crunchbang	Dr_Willis	so I guess its (hd0,1) ?
2010-08-16T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 I mean Hard Drives.. not parittions.. if you have 2 actual hard drives.. the first one should be hd0 second hd1
2010-08-16T17:58:00.000Z	crunchbang	Dr_Willis	only one harddrive :)
2010-08-16T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	   if you have 1 hd.. then whats the issue? Oh you need the PARITTION # then. :)   if its partitioned like windows, linux, swap. then linux would be on hd0,1 yes.
2010-08-16T17:59:00.000Z	crunchbang	Dr_Willis	No, its Linux, Swap, Windows I think
2010-08-16T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 check 'sudo fdisk -l'  output. :) actually the grub command line has a way to look also..
2010-08-16T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	crunchbang	 first hd/parittion is hd0,0 then.
2010-08-16T18:01:00.000Z	crunchbang	Dr_Willis	I figured it out.. Windows is hd0,2
