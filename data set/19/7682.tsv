2007-08-02T12:54:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Well. I'm back. Not even 5 minutes gone and I have another question. How do I dual-boot WIndowsXP if I have Ubuntu installed already? All guides I see are if I have Windows installed first.
2007-08-02T12:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	after you install xp, you'll need to pop a live cd in and recover grub
2007-08-02T12:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	check out the first link ubotu spat out
2007-08-02T12:55:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	Yeah but will my Ubutu partition be touched?
2007-08-02T12:56:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	nope
2007-08-02T13:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	right.
2007-08-02T13:03:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	So...partitioning this section. How do I go about?
2007-08-02T13:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	partition which section? for Win?
2007-08-02T13:04:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	Yeah the section for WindowsXP. I need an empty partition, right? How do I go about partitioning it?
2007-08-02T13:05:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	i'd use gparted, if you have it. preferrably the live cd version (which you can find by googling, easily).
2007-08-02T13:05:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	I have gparted, but I'm not sure if it's the LiveCD version.
2007-08-02T13:06:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	the live CD version of gparted is... just gparted on a cd. nothing else.
2007-08-02T13:07:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	Ah then, no, I don't have the LiveCD version. And since I am currently out of empty CD-Rs, I probably won't be obtaining it soon.
2007-08-02T13:09:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	ok, no biggie. if youre not using a ubuntu live CD, pop one in and you can run gparted from that.
2007-08-02T13:09:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	I jsut realized the dilemma I am in. In order to partition this drive I need to unmount it, and in doing so, will shut down Linux, yes?
2007-08-02T13:09:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	I have 4 Ubuntu Feisty LiveCDs. gparted is on them?
2007-08-02T13:09:00.000Z	riotkittie	ThanatosDrive	yep
2007-08-02T13:10:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	Okay well I'll go for it some other day then. Right now I'm busy.
2007-08-02T13:10:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	riotkittie	Flannel, Jordan_U, ntbnnt, astro76: Much thanks, all of you! You're all great!
