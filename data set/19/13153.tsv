2005-07-13T11:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	hell no, VLC is teh way to go ;)
2005-07-13T11:42:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	that's slightly better, but its interface isn't as simple as it could be, either.
2005-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	I suggest anyone who idolizes interfaces that much to go shower themselves in syrup, and not wash
2005-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	I don't idolize interfaces. I like consistency.
2005-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	I realise some people do like the eye candy.
2005-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	well, my consistency lies in the curses of the terminal
2005-07-13T11:44:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	sure. that's where I spend most of my time. I was speaking about application-specific themes
2005-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	what window manager do you use? :)
2005-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	(if any)
2005-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	KDE... it looks good as a background ;)
2005-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	hmm. ever tried ion, or ratpoison? :)
2005-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	never heard of the former, was considering the latter
2005-07-13T11:46:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	ratpoison is even more barebones than ion, ion (ion3 to be specific) has floating windows optionally, and I like its keys better.
2005-07-13T11:46:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	I was also considering E
2005-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	enlightement?
2005-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	the one and only
2005-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	last time I tried it, it looked like an RPG game interface from 1994
2005-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	wolverian	check the screenshots
2005-07-13T11:48:00.000Z	wolverian	Razor-X	not the kind of I'm talking about. :) and those screenshots look nice.
