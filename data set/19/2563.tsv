2010-06-24T15:42:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	which terminal program?
2010-06-24T15:42:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	applications > terminal
2010-06-24T15:42:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	using gnome?
2010-06-24T15:43:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	true
2010-06-24T15:44:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	Edit->Profiles->Edit->Background
2010-06-24T15:44:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	actually, the color is one tab left of background, the colors tab
2010-06-24T15:45:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	always the first thing i change in terminals, i have to have a black background :)
2010-06-24T15:45:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	it is 'solid color' there in that place where you asked me to look, but neither I know how to change or what it currently is, nor I really want tochange it, it's white bg by default in new terminal windows, it's ok, just these text browsers being nasty
2010-06-24T15:46:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	actually go one tab to the left,  the 'Colors' tab.  Unclick 'use colors from system theme'
2010-06-24T15:46:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	then choose a background color
2010-06-24T15:46:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	the colors tab says "use system colors" but again, default terminal setting is completely ok for me
2010-06-24T15:48:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	the color is white, now, but links2 still has grey one, and lynx the dark one, these text browser are still being nasty
2010-06-24T15:49:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	the thing is they were designed to work with a black background, so thats how they will look.  They were developed for console usage as opposed to terminal emulators
2010-06-24T16:04:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	"They were developed for console usage as opposed to terminal emulators" yeah, I want them be in text, like the terminal, can't they just use terminal bg color (white)? links2 even  has it as an option, but I don't see it take any effect
2010-06-24T16:05:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	i mean that w3m and lynx and links were written in the early 90's
2010-06-24T16:05:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	w3m actually maybee the late 90's
2010-06-24T16:06:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	but they were all written to be run outside of an X environment, where the console is pretty much black no matter what
2010-06-24T16:27:00.000Z	Gryllida	ddilinger	can I force these text browsers to use my terminal's default background color?
2010-06-24T16:27:00.000Z	ddilinger	Gryllida	dont think so, as i mentioned they were written a long time ago
