2008-09-10T09:20:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	that command you entered doesn't make any sense. what are you trying to do?
2008-09-10T09:21:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	just use the package name, you don't specify a path with that command
2008-09-10T09:21:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	the package knows where to install
2008-09-10T09:22:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	compiz is the cube and wobbly windows and desktop effects. beryl is the window decoration (the frame around the window) ... you can use them together or not it is up to you
2008-09-10T09:29:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	cat /etc/lsb-release
2008-09-10T09:29:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	you sure you are on dapper or edgy? those are getting kinda out of date
2008-09-10T09:31:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	then that is the "hardy" (codename) relase  - the current version
2008-09-10T10:09:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	maybe you have more than one program trying to install? you can't do an apt-get install while synaptic is open, for example
2008-09-10T10:11:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki1	patrick_	that's not going to work. you have have "root" permissions to install something. to get this permission you have to use "sudo" in front of the command
