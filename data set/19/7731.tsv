2008-02-10T05:05:00.000Z	Green		Does anyone know if there's programs for linux to erase permanently or rewrite over the files on a hard drive ? OR EVEN FILES PRIVATE FILES???
2008-02-10T05:06:00.000Z	LjL	Green	shred, wipe
2008-02-10T05:07:00.000Z	Green	LjL	I though you still can recover files...
2008-02-10T05:07:00.000Z	Green	LjL	is shred complete rewritten the files /hd and unable to recover ?
2008-02-10T05:07:00.000Z	LjL	Green	after using shred or wipe? definitely not without expensive equipment
2008-02-10T05:07:00.000Z	LjL	Green	used on ext3, both can be problematic
2008-02-10T05:07:00.000Z	LjL	Green	at least ext3 with some flavor of journal
2008-02-10T05:09:00.000Z	LjL	Green	probably equivalent
2008-02-10T05:09:00.000Z	LjL	Green	wipe is more versatile
2008-02-10T05:10:00.000Z	LjL	Green	shred is installed by default
2008-02-10T05:11:00.000Z	LjL	Green	... try typing "shred" in a shell
2008-02-10T05:13:00.000Z	LjL	Green	err yeah, it means you need to provide it with arguments. have you never used command-line programs before? i'll give you some pointers.
2008-02-10T05:22:00.000Z	LjL	Green	no. even assuming your filesystem is not journaled, someone with the right equipment can still perform data recovery. there are companies specializing in that.
2008-02-10T05:25:00.000Z	LjL	Green	read shred's man page.
2008-02-10T05:34:00.000Z	LjL	Green	the more iterations you make it do, the lower the chances of recovery. assuming your filesystem is not journalled again.
2008-02-10T05:35:00.000Z	LjL	Green	i really cannot say if shred will work properly on NTFS. on ext3, again, it will work if not in data=journal mode
2008-02-10T05:40:00.000Z	LjL	Green	all programs will work equally well or equally badly as far as NTFS goes. it depends on how the filesystem works, and i haven't really a clue
2008-02-10T05:45:00.000Z	LjL	Green	seems like clearly a windows program to me
2008-02-10T05:47:00.000Z	LjL	Green	i already answered best i could
