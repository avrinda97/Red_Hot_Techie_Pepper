2009-08-12T12:59:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		yeah I have md 192.168.1.65 in my hosts
2009-08-12T13:00:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		and then if I ping md or 192.168.1.65 it doesnt work
2009-08-12T13:01:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	type arp and see if your brother's ip is in there... some one has a brain dead implementation of arp
2009-08-12T13:01:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	it says md                               (incomplete)                              wlan0
2009-08-12T13:02:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	this is what mine says
2009-08-12T13:02:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	how would I correct it in there?
2009-08-12T13:02:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	it has my info
2009-08-12T13:03:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	do you know how I can update it?
2009-08-12T13:03:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	is this wireless
2009-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	yeah it doesnt work over eth either though
2009-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	is this wireless in ad hoc mode?
2009-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	no
2009-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	what mode is it
2009-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	I think it is managed or infrastructure
2009-08-12T13:05:00.000Z	bucky	fuzzybunny	both computers?
2009-08-12T13:06:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	we both connect to the same router
2009-08-12T13:12:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	hey I think I got it
2009-08-12T13:12:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	thanks so much for your help
2009-08-12T13:20:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	bucky	I rebooted and it lost it again after I updated the arp table with the correct MAC address do you know how I can get it so that it has the correct mac address after a reboot?
