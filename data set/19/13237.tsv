2006-10-29T07:25:00.000Z	Raskall		no more free CD's of ubuntu. :( Really not a problem with my 6 mbit dsl, but it IS easier to convert people with a branded cd than a home-burned one.
2006-10-29T07:25:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	You _can_ pay.
2006-10-29T07:26:00.000Z	Raskall	javaJake	I know. :) but I won't. I'm not working with linux any more, so my level of missionary work has dropped drastically.
2006-12-02T16:47:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	System -> Administration -> Keyboard
2006-12-02T16:48:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	System -> Preferences -> Keyboard
2006-12-02T16:48:00.000Z	Raskall	javaJake	erm.. I only have command line access to the system
2006-12-02T16:48:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	Ah, well now, that's a different matter altogether...
2006-12-02T16:49:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	let me do some googling...
2006-12-02T16:49:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	do you know about lynx, and centericq?
2006-12-02T16:49:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	those are excellent browser and IM programs for the command-line
2006-12-02T16:50:00.000Z	Raskall	javaJake	I know about both, yes. :)
2006-12-02T16:50:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	setxkbmap <layout>
2006-12-02T16:50:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	That'll do it.
2006-12-02T16:50:00.000Z	Raskall	javaJake	ahh.. thanks.
2006-12-02T16:50:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	just need to know the name of the layout
2006-12-02T16:51:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	need that too?
2006-12-03T17:08:00.000Z	Raskall	javaJake	my problem was in the nx client. I had to set the keyboard layout in the nx client.
2006-12-03T17:08:00.000Z	Raskall	javaJake	and then I managed to get xfce running too. :)
2006-12-03T17:09:00.000Z	javaJake	Raskall	Oh, OK.
