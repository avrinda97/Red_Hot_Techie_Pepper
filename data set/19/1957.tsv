2011-04-10T21:05:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_		hi guys, im having trouble getting "gtk-redshift" to autostart. it is in the autostart menu and is checked, i have even set the entries as executable just incase that was the problem, but it is still not working. Any ideas?
2011-04-10T21:06:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	could you paste the exact command you have put in autostart?
2011-04-10T21:06:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	sure, one sec while i find it
2011-04-10T21:07:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	/home/b3rz3rk3r/.config/autostart gtk-redshift
2011-04-10T21:08:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	thanks; /home/.../autostart is a directory, it shouldn't be part of the command
2011-04-10T21:08:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	you should just use "gtk-redshift" (without the quotes)
2011-04-10T21:09:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	im running kubuntu, the location was under properties of the command
2011-04-10T21:10:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	its actually just "gtk-redshift"
2011-04-10T21:12:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	does running gtk-redshift from the terminal work?
2011-04-10T21:12:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	it does
2011-04-10T21:13:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	actually, i think you might be onto something there, i may need to edit the command to give location settings. im going to try that and reboot to see if it works. thanks for the thought!
2011-04-10T21:13:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	could you open the right .desktop file in .config/autostart and pastebin it?
2011-04-10T21:14:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	ok
2011-04-10T21:17:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/592211/
2011-04-10T21:18:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r_	candrea	im thinking if i change the exec command to include the location data then it might work
2011-04-10T21:18:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	well, if 'gtk-redshift' works in a terminal, the it must work in autostart too
2011-04-10T21:19:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	I suspect that the cases here are two: either gtk-redshift depends on some other process started by autostart, or it depends on some environment variable that your shell sets automatically
2011-04-10T21:21:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	however, try including the location data as you proposed
2011-04-10T21:26:00.000Z	candrea	b3rz3rk3r_	according to the manpage of gtk-redshift, I see that you need to set the -l and -t options; I'm wondering why it works with the terminal
