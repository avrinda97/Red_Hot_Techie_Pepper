2005-07-16T06:17:00.000Z	tats`away		wonders if i'd break something if i uninstalled open office
2005-07-16T06:19:00.000Z	tats`away		same thing
2005-07-16T06:19:00.000Z	tats`away		yep

2005-07-16T06:22:00.000Z	tats`away		shrugs most i've seen from M$ are for rightys.
2005-07-16T06:22:00.000Z	tats`away		esp their tracballs heh.
2005-07-16T06:22:00.000Z	tats`away		k well thats good to know.
2005-07-16T06:23:00.000Z	tats`away		if i uninstall OOo, it wants to uninstall ubuntu-desktop... wtf is that
2005-07-16T06:23:00.000Z	tats`away		most mice i've seen use the wheel as the 3rd button
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	tats`away		meta package? whats that mean
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	Danar	tats`away	a fake package that depends on a group of other packages
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	tats`away	cafuego	only if you're on a mac heh in which case you're screwed.
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	tats`away		fake? lol ok
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	tats`away		k thx.
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	tats`away		ya really
2005-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	Danar	tats`away	not "fake" just that it doesn't have anything of it's own. it exists to depend on other packages
2005-07-16T06:25:00.000Z	tats`away		macs come with mice with no buttons or just 1
2005-07-16T06:25:00.000Z	tats`away		some mac mice "tilt" to make a click.
2005-07-16T06:25:00.000Z	Danar	tats`away	hence 'metapackage'
