2004-11-13T17:02:00.000Z	chibifs		Gaim with IRC takes up less memory than Gaim and Xchat at once. :P
2004-11-13T17:02:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	i agree, i've started using gaim for irc lately too
2004-11-13T17:11:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	i just uninstalled rhythmbox :)
2004-11-13T17:21:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	google for a handy script called "getwinex"
2004-11-13T17:27:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	oh man. that's sad
2004-11-13T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	sudo there
2004-11-13T17:30:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	sudo is not exactly a ubuntu invention. on any distro you should set it up first thing
2004-11-13T17:31:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	good for you
2004-11-13T17:44:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	i believe you. root doesn't need breaks :)
2004-11-13T17:44:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	might as well run windows 95
2004-11-13T17:58:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	kde is quite nice too, for those who like that sort of thing. k3b could never be in gnome anyway, it's not very compliant to the HIG :)
2004-11-13T06:00:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	we need the functionality, but we definitely need a better UI. coaster might do it once the library is working
2004-11-13T06:08:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	i guess patrick might be wise to not support gnome. he's such a lonely rider. how much can a man do?
2005-01-31T16:32:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	on another xserver
2005-01-31T16:34:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	gaim can live on a remote box, but it needs your local x i'm afraid
2005-01-31T16:36:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	i'd run irssi in that situation
2005-01-31T16:37:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	i sometimes run remote irssi on my phone :)
2005-01-31T16:41:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	lunar?
2005-01-31T16:43:00.000Z	topyli	chibifs	they do have some good news on their site: "e17 lives!" :)
