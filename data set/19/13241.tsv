2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	stas		same with cedega
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	frank	stas	it can only work through a chroot
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	frank	stas	AFAIK
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	stas		I saw a how-to for a 32-bit chroot
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	stas		but it's like 4 pages long

2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	stas		would it be easier to just scrap this and install the i386 version of ubuntu
