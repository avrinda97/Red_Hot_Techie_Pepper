2006-05-31T08:05:00.000Z	QPAD|warlock		mkdir: cannot create directory `/var/cpanel/gameserv_saved/': No such file or directory
2006-05-31T08:06:00.000Z	Bladesonfire	QPAD|warlock	try running mkdir with the -p option
2006-05-31T08:07:00.000Z	QPAD|warlock	Bladesonfire	huh ?
2006-05-31T08:08:00.000Z	Bladesonfire	QPAD|warlock	sudo mkdir -p /var/cpanel/gameserv_saved/
2006-05-31T08:10:00.000Z	QPAD|warlock	Bladesonfire	so im supposed to make all the folders that's didnt get created?
2006-05-31T08:11:00.000Z	Bladesonfire	QPAD|warlock	parent folders are only created with the -p option
2006-05-31T08:11:00.000Z	Bladesonfire	QPAD|warlock	(if they don't already exist)
2006-05-31T08:13:00.000Z	QPAD|warlock	Bladesonfire	what im saying is: I ran a script, and it's cPanel, and it's supposed to make its own dirs and add the files in the dirs it created, and not that im supposed to make the dirs manually and THEN run the install script.
2006-05-31T08:14:00.000Z	Bladesonfire	QPAD|warlock	I would ask the script creators about how the script works
2006-05-31T08:15:00.000Z	Bladesonfire	QPAD|warlock	Hmmmmm, don't know what the problem could be, then
