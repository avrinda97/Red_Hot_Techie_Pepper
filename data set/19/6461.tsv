2010-05-27T04:24:00.000Z	i3luefire		im trying to install ubuntu 10.4 but i want my root fs to be btrfs. can anyone here help me?
2010-05-27T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	use custom partitioning
2010-05-27T04:25:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	so the partitioner will format btrfs if i do custom?
2010-05-27T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	if its an option, yes. You can always install an extra package or option to get the filesystem
2010-05-27T04:28:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	i added the btrfs tools thru synaptic & gparted still doesn't have that fs
2010-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	remove old kernels is a great way to free space
2010-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	also remove apps you don't use, also run: sudo apt-get clean
2010-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	there are no old kernels
2010-11-15T06:04:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	or apps i dont use its almost a fresh install
2010-11-15T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	also install bleachbit, close as many apps as you can and run it as user and root to clean files (watch options for browser or it'll cleat settings you want as avoid options which say they will take a long time
2010-11-15T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	also you can remove openoffice and install abiword if you only need a word processor
2010-11-15T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	probably temp stuff, bleachbit will sort that, also your emails may use a lot with attachments
2010-11-15T06:09:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	ty i will try that
2010-11-15T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	yes lots will be hidden
2010-11-15T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	like ~/.mozilla if you use firefox will have all the temp internet files
2010-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	49MB thats it
2010-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	its that sort of thing
2010-11-15T06:16:00.000Z	i3luefire	ActionParsnip	isnt there some way to get like the last 5kb of the file to open in gedit without opening the whole thing?
2010-11-15T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	i3luefire	run:   head filename
