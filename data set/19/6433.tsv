2009-05-07T10:24:00.000Z	cgkades		i like my 8.10
2009-05-07T10:25:00.000Z	cgkades		wouldnt expect that to be a problem lol
2009-05-07T10:25:00.000Z	cgkades		i'm not doing the upgrade
2009-05-07T10:25:00.000Z	cgkades		every time i've tried the upgrade feature, it's bricked my system
2009-05-07T10:26:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	release upgrade or just upgrade? =)
2009-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	cgkades		sergey: anytime i've tried to do the upgrade via the update manager
2009-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	cgkades		in any linux distro
2009-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	cgkades		i had to fix a co-workers computer
2009-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	cgkades		he upgraded, and it bricked
2009-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	weird... may be I should disable my automatic security updates =)
2009-05-07T10:27:00.000Z	cgkades		sergey: no, updates are different
2009-05-07T10:28:00.000Z	cgkades	chris8	have you tried the ubuntu forums?
2009-05-07T10:28:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	hope so =) Although I've done quite a few upgrades (through apt-get) and still working fine... =) May be I'm lucky...
2009-05-07T10:29:00.000Z	cgkades		sergey: i'm talking about the upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04
2009-05-07T10:29:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	tried that too, and worked =) although not on production system =)
2009-05-07T10:30:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	and only once =)
2009-05-07T10:30:00.000Z	cgkades		sergey: yeah, i've never had it work on a configured and tweaked system. i just wait till it's "necessary" then back up everything, note what programs i want, and then do a fresh install
2009-05-07T10:30:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	but will know for future reference that I need to make an image before doin that...
2009-05-07T10:31:00.000Z	Sergey	cgkades	yeah, that can take some time...
