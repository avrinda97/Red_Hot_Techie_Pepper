2011-01-04T15:39:00.000Z	wazz		Hi
2011-01-04T15:41:00.000Z	wazz		Anyone here who knows about networking stuff?
2011-01-04T15:42:00.000Z	wazz		Well, I have a small case with my "network"
2011-01-04T15:43:00.000Z	wazz		I have 1 server and one normal PC (running ubuntus). They are connected to a switch and that switch is connected to a wall.
2011-01-04T15:43:00.000Z	wazz		I'm getting IP addresses for those two by dhcp, but I also would need some static IP for connecting them.
2011-01-04T15:44:00.000Z	wazz		Problem is that I'm scared that using alias ip will make some traffic "over" my own switch
2011-01-04T15:45:00.000Z	wazz		No
2011-01-04T15:45:00.000Z	wazz		ahh.. not for u ubottu, sorry :)
2011-01-04T15:47:00.000Z	wrd	wazz	do you have your own switch?
2011-01-04T15:48:00.000Z	wazz	wrd	yes. It's stupid switch (cannot make any settings)
2011-01-04T15:50:00.000Z	wrd	wazz	it shouldn't be. the switch should be automatically learning your ip addresses and mac addresses and then forwarding local traffic to local machines.
2011-01-04T15:51:00.000Z	wazz	wrd	I know it should be like this, but still i feel that it's not really going like that :D
2011-01-04T15:51:00.000Z	wazz	wrd	also the thing with speed. When I were transfering data over sftp it was much faster with ip addresses from dhcp
2011-01-04T15:54:00.000Z	wrd	wazz	well, are you sure that the problem is really from the ip addresses and not some random external issue?
2011-01-04T15:55:00.000Z	wazz	wrd	I'm not. I think it might be this alias ip, maybe it's slower by nature.
2011-01-04T15:57:00.000Z	wrd	wazz	have you tried setting up a static ip and running the same tests? can you use your own switch?
2011-01-04T15:57:00.000Z	wazz	wrd	I haven't done that. I will test it out when I'm going home
2011-01-04T15:58:00.000Z	wazz	wrd	do you know if arp request is going trought this switch what isnt mine.
2011-01-04T16:00:00.000Z	wrd	wazz	well sniff traffic. if you are really keen you could have a look how long it takes to get an arp response. if you've got access to the arp table that could be helpful.
