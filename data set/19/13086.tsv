2005-11-26T14:27:00.000Z	nalioth	bl3ssing	you're using xubuntu ?
2005-11-26T14:27:00.000Z	nalioth	bl3ssing	then you need "adept"
2005-11-26T14:28:00.000Z	nalioth	bl3ssing	adept is in your menus
2005-11-26T14:28:00.000Z	nalioth	bl3ssing	adept is kubuntus pkg manager, if you want synaptic, install it

2005-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	nalioth	bl3ssing	if you are using kubuntu, perhaps you should ask in #kubuntu
