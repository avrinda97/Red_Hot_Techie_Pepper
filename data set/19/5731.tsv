2008-05-15T14:01:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	first run the kernel in profiling mode once
2008-05-15T14:01:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	did?
2008-05-15T14:01:00.000Z	yit41	clusty	err.. i dont know what is profiling mode
2008-05-15T14:01:00.000Z	yit41		and kernel..
2008-05-15T14:02:00.000Z	yit41		how do i make that?
2008-05-15T14:02:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	when grub is booting press "e" to edit the boot line
2008-05-15T14:03:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	where you see some stuff like splash add "profile" (without "")
2008-05-15T14:03:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	then press b to really boot. this will grind disk and figure out what files are being loaded and they get precached
2008-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	once you reach the login screen reboot
2008-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	clusty		and boot normally
2008-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	yit41	clusty	that seems very complicated
2008-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	dud you are dealing with linux
2008-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	its a g33k OS
2008-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	you can't make it faster without know what you are doing
2008-05-15T14:05:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	bear with it, learn the ropes and then fiddle with it
2008-05-15T14:05:00.000Z	yit41	clusty	lol guess i'm not geek enough. is there anyway like linux version of msconfig or something?
2008-05-15T14:05:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	you get lots of that stuff in gnome
2008-05-15T14:06:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	funny_circle->system->administration
2008-05-15T14:06:00.000Z	clusty	yit41	just make sure you aint borking everything. google around to see what does each thing do
