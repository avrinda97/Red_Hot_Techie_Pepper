2005-04-20T08:48:00.000Z	stew2		It's setup with a fixed IP. Is there some way I can check what DNS it's using through the shell?
2005-04-20T08:49:00.000Z	stew2		thanks. I'm in ireland, the computer is in portland oregon
2005-04-20T08:49:00.000Z	stew2		DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
2005-04-20T08:50:00.000Z	stew2		So what do I edit it with, then?
2005-04-20T08:51:00.000Z	stew2		Oh, I'm not using DHCP on this machine.
2005-04-20T08:51:00.000Z	stew2		You know what, I wonder if aptitude didn't overwrite the resolve.conf file when it updated something???
2005-04-20T08:53:00.000Z	stew2		I have an /etc/resolveconf folder. Does that mean anything?
2005-04-20T08:53:00.000Z	stew2		acidwolf kill -9 6273
2005-04-20T08:54:00.000Z	stew2		so I just add a 'nameserver 21.43.54.32' or whatever the ip address is on a line in resolve.conf?
2005-04-20T08:56:00.000Z	stew2		dreamer3 okay, i found an example on google.com/linux
2005-04-20T08:56:00.000Z	delire	stew2	desktop environments like Gnome or KDE have graphical user interfaces for manipulating /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf
2005-04-20T08:57:00.000Z	stew2	delire	OF COURSE! :) I'm in Dublin though, and the computer is at a non-profit in Portland, Oregon. If there's any way for me to run a remote desktop, that sounds like lots of fun! for now, I have an ssh session though..
2005-04-20T08:57:00.000Z	delire	stew2	you've looked into X Forwarding?
2005-04-20T08:58:00.000Z	stew2	delire	nope, thanks.
2005-04-20T08:58:00.000Z	stew2	delire	i gotta fix this box first...
2005-04-20T08:59:00.000Z	delire	stew2	tommyboy: there likely is already a camera that works. i use a logitech webcam (phillips chipset) but i needed to compile a module to use it.
2005-04-20T09:27:00.000Z	delire	stew2	apt-get clean if you want to clear the package cache
2005-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	delire	stew2	does 'apt-get update' work?
2005-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	delire	stew2	'dpkg -P aptitude' would have worked as well ;)
