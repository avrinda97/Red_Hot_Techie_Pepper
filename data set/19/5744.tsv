2009-04-23T19:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb		how do I upgrade 8.04 to 8.10 on another computer, when it refuses  to download some packages and gives me 404 not found messages?  I guess I can always change the sources myself and do it the old way, if nessarey
2009-04-23T19:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	you are most likely getting an overloaded or incomplete mirror, you should not do it manually, there are specific upgrade conditions only covered by the update manager
2009-04-23T19:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	such as?
2009-04-23T19:09:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	I don't know the details, i just know there are distro upgrade conditions covered by the update manager, which are not part of the regular package upgrades process
2009-08-17T16:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	I think that  probably depends  on  what problem they are trying to solve,  plus  they will still have the old one installed unless they remove it themselves.
2009-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	Why do you think it's a bad idea?
2009-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	because there could be userland applications not compatible with the newest kernel, and also 3rd party modules that you may use
2009-11-08T23:10:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	if you are not familiar with the Karmic sound issues please do not reply, that will just get the user frustrated
2009-11-08T23:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	you dont need to clearn install to have the final !
2009-11-08T23:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	well sure, but you can't quarranttee that you have the proper final
2009-11-08T23:13:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	yes you can, that is how upgrades work
2009-11-08T23:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	when applying upgrades from development versions, upgrades not always install properly
2009-11-08T23:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	upgrade mail fails on unplanned circunstances, that does not invalited the upgrade process as recommended
2009-11-08T23:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	I have been testing Karmic since alpha 4,  I haven't done the final just yet, and oh yes I need to really.  I still have boot up issues for example.   So no it's not just as simple as  upgrading from a development version, that is not how it works.   With the beta it might,  with alphas nah.
2009-11-08T23:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	your statement is incorrect, you may get issues from the upgrades, that does not invalidate the fact that you are running the final version,
2009-11-08T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	I coudn't even just get the last lot of updates since it woudn't let me download them, but  whatever  not that long now, and  I will be doing a nice clean install.  Oh I might be able to change where it is getting updates from and then get them, but  I can't be bothered, since will be clean installing anyway.
2009-11-08T23:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	According to what you were saying this install is probably the beta.
2009-11-09T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joaopinto	he just wants help to do an md5sum and his attitude is a bit bad
2009-11-09T03:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	sebsebseb	with such attitude he doesn't need help he needs education first
