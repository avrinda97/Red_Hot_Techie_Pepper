2005-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	afaik		I'm a command line commando
2005-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	afaik		and I was curious, how can I watch movies from the CLI?
2005-10-02T05:56:00.000Z	afaik		I done it before... it "upgraded" my ubuntu box to a debian box :)
2005-10-02T05:56:00.000Z	afaik		"Fourth Level, passed!"
2005-10-02T05:56:00.000Z	afaik		I kid, I kid :)
2005-10-02T05:56:00.000Z	afaik		it could
2005-10-02T05:56:00.000Z	afaik		or it could be better
2005-10-02T05:57:00.000Z	afaik		well, I dont see how he would break his box doing a dist-upgrade to Debian Sid
2005-10-02T05:57:00.000Z	afaik		it would turn his box into debian
2005-10-02T05:57:00.000Z	afaik		thats all
2005-10-02T05:57:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	yeah so as we said break it ;)
2005-10-02T06:00:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	his box may not break but could become a pain in the ass to use
2005-10-02T06:32:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	I talkd to rohal
2005-10-02T06:32:00.000Z	afaik	Nikopol	"plz tll me why freebsd is grt!?" isn't trolling?
2005-10-02T06:33:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	well from my talk with him he wasn't
2005-10-02T06:33:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	he was more curious about what makes a distro good
2005-10-02T06:34:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	he doesn't use Gentoo apparatnly
2005-10-02T06:35:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	hey I thought he was windinf us up at the beginnign too ;)
2005-10-02T06:35:00.000Z	Nikopol	afaik	I think just the mere mention of Gentoo sets off my alarm bells for flamebait
