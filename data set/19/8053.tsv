2007-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Do you have a mysql server installed?
2007-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Did you set a root password?
2007-05-11T09:49:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	I don't know if you have the right syntax there, I'm not exactly a guru with mysql... try this. "mysql -u root -h localhost" and see if you get a login screen.
2007-05-11T09:52:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Try 'dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server*
2007-05-11T09:57:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	sudo apt-get autoremove --purge mysql-server-5.0
2007-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Did you remember the asterisk?
2007-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	My bad. Try this...
2007-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	sudo apt-get autoremove --purge mysql*
2007-05-11T10:02:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	I've had these problems before... I think you've changed the root password somewhere.
2007-05-11T10:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Did you reset the root password?
2007-05-11T10:03:00.000Z	FantaOrange	rukuartic	it worked, now should i reinstall it?
2007-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Does cowbell work now?
2007-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	My bad, wrong person.
2007-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Yeah try uninstalling now.
2007-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	sudo apt-get install mysql-server-4.0 or 5.0, whichever you like better
2007-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	No, but I've installed things similar to it.
2007-05-11T10:10:00.000Z	FantaOrange	rukuartic	do u know how to setup mysql?
2007-05-11T10:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	FantaOrange	Barely. But I need to go in the next few minutes.
