2005-07-23T08:32:00.000Z	stuNNed		anyone use wpa_supplicant on a lappie?
2005-07-23T08:33:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	yes
2005-07-23T08:34:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	sometimes do you have to run 'dhclient ath0' because ubuntu's wpa_supplicant doesn't assign and ip fast enough?
2005-07-23T08:34:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	wpa_supplicant can call out to a dhcp client?
2005-07-23T08:35:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	my normal course of action is to wait for wpa_supplicant to do the crypto stuff and then run ifup ath0
2005-07-23T08:35:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	mmmk, shouldn't the ifup ath0 be auto?
2005-07-23T08:36:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	this is how i've always done it
2005-07-23T08:36:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	i'd like open the lid on my sleeping laptop plug in the pcmcia card and wpa_supplicant does the rest, not you?
2005-07-23T08:37:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	oh, indeed, but i don't care enough to make it so
2005-07-23T08:37:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	lazy!=running ifup ath0 ;)
2005-07-23T08:38:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	incidentially, are you using WPA or just WEP? because I couldn't get WPA working...
2005-07-23T08:38:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	WPA and Open i'm using
2005-07-23T08:39:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	did you try running wpa_supplicant in debug mode?  it is very useful.
2005-07-23T08:39:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	yes, not useful enough...it's a known problem which i don't think has been fixed
2005-07-23T08:40:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	haven't seen that here but have been having general problems with wireless at my uni, affects windows too though
2005-07-23T08:42:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	wpa_supplicant is coming along nicely though imho
2005-07-23T08:42:00.000Z	teferi	stuNNed	well, i'm on wired ethernet here at work anyway, so it doesn't really matter right now :P
2005-07-23T08:43:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	i don't think wpa_supplicant handles the ip layer from what i'm hearing.
2005-07-23T08:45:00.000Z	stuNNed	teferi	thanks for your input :)
