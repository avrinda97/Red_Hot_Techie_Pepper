2006-03-17T17:56:00.000Z	IdleOne		BBHoss>  simple reason is Ubuntu could install EVERYTHING by default but it would take 5 cd install is that what you want?
2006-03-17T17:58:00.000Z	IdleOne		Celestianpower>  happy to hear :)
2006-03-17T17:58:00.000Z	cwillu	IdleOne	if you ever hear somebody else with the same problem, hit up !1.0.0.0
2007-09-25T06:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	two screens 1 kb/mouse
2007-09-25T06:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	I think what he wants is to have 4 desktops split onto 2 seperate monitors. being able to look at desktop3/4 from monitor 1 and so on
2007-09-25T06:33:00.000Z	cwillu	IdleOne	Rageon:  turning off xinerama would do it then, as long as you don't care about dragging stuff between screens
2007-10-22T04:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	ohvoy?
2007-10-22T04:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	well if it doesnt work when plugged in to the outlet perhaps the outlet is burned out :/
2007-10-22T04:40:00.000Z	cwillu	IdleOne	I know, I'm just anticipating AllyUnion's reaction :p
2007-10-22T04:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	first step is check the wires right? well what if all the wires are ok? then check where you plug them in :)
2007-10-22T04:41:00.000Z	cwillu	IdleOne	is it turned on, is it plugged in, I know :p
2007-10-22T04:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	:P that is 1000 points for me
2007-10-22T06:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	it doesnt . just the kiddies who use irc suck
2008-01-09T09:03:00.000Z	cwillu	IdleOne	thanks
2008-01-09T09:04:00.000Z	cwillu	IdleOne	although you confused me there, was wondering why I had asked about it in #ubuntu :p
2008-01-09T09:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	cwillu	you didnt but had I done it in +1 it would of given package info for +1 :)
