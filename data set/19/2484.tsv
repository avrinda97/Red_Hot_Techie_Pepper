2010-06-10T20:36:00.000Z	p1l0t		I am upgrading my server (has gui) and halfway through the process I put the terminal window down... I have no taskbar though and alt-tab is not working since I started the upgrade... HELP
2010-06-10T20:37:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	ha ha, silly little problem
2010-06-10T20:38:00.000Z	p1l0t	edbian	not really because I need THAT terminal window where it is halfway thru the process...
2010-06-10T20:39:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	Ummm, use the other terminal to create a new gnome panel, then add the window switcher to the gnome panel
2010-06-10T20:39:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	Will that work?
2010-06-10T20:40:00.000Z	p1l0t	edbian	I can right-click and get many of the xfce options still... can I get it back that way?
2010-06-10T20:41:00.000Z	p1l0t	edbian	although when I click on panel manager nothing happens
2010-06-10T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	Oh, you're on xfce.  I'm not that familiar with it but the same trick should work, create a new xfce panel, add a window switcher
2010-06-10T20:43:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	alt + tab, AND super + tab don't work?  You could go to the keyboard shortcut settings in xfce and turn them back on.
2010-06-10T20:44:00.000Z	p1l0t	edbian	there is nothing under keyboard shortcuts, I will have to add them. What is the name of program that switches windows again?
2010-06-10T20:45:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	There isn't a program that switches your windows.  It's a feature in your window manager.
2010-06-10T20:45:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	Apparently in your case that's xfce
2010-06-10T20:46:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	Try alt + f8
2010-06-10T20:46:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	middle click on the desktop
2010-06-10T20:47:00.000Z	p1l0t	edbian	window manager is FAIL too :(
2010-06-10T20:47:00.000Z	p1l0t	edbian	MIDDLE CLICK FTW! thank you so much that worked
2010-06-10T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	I think you might be SOL.  If you don't have any software to manage your windows then you can't very well expect to be able to.
2010-06-10T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	oh good. :)
2011-07-12T05:24:00.000Z	edbian	p1l0t	You need to install an add-on for that I think.
