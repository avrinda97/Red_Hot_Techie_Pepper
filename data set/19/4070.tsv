2009-03-30T23:46:00.000Z	Nithrin		I have a Ubuntu installation problem. Anyone help please?
2009-03-30T23:48:00.000Z	Nithrin		I downloaded Ubuntu 8.10, and I burned the iso to a DVD and then restarted my computer and on reboot it just does not recognize the CD. I did go in and change the boot order, so I know that is not it. Perhaps I am not rebooting from DVD or whatever properly
2009-03-30T23:48:00.000Z	Nithrin		What is that? Apparently not
2009-03-30T23:50:00.000Z	Nithrin		I'll try that. Thanks
2009-03-30T23:51:00.000Z	Nithrin		Dell XPS M1530
2009-03-30T23:51:00.000Z	Nithrin		Rather new
2009-03-30T23:51:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	ooho, i have the same laptop
2009-03-30T23:52:00.000Z	Nithrin	Sapta	How does Ubuntu work with your keyboard?
2009-03-30T23:52:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	fine, although the touchpad went crazy
2009-03-30T23:52:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	I have to check drivers for it
2009-03-31T00:01:00.000Z	Nithrin	Sapta	How did you reboot from DVD on your laptop?
2009-03-31T00:03:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	I used the Ubuntu live cd to install and it booted right from it. You can press F12 to boot from cd
2009-03-31T00:04:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	I downloaded the same thing, only wrote it on CD
2009-03-31T00:04:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	Did you burn it as data DVD?
2009-03-31T00:14:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	Did you burn the iso as image or data?
2009-03-31T00:14:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	In the second case, it won't be a bootable disk
2009-03-31T00:14:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	use a software like Nero burning ROM
2009-03-31T00:15:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	XP has the small but great Alex Feinamn or sth image burner
2009-03-31T00:15:00.000Z	Sapta	Nithrin	I think you made it a data DVD, hence it's not bootable. I hope you've the .iso image
