2011-06-30T07:16:00.000Z	Sorinan		it's before, it doesn't load the menu
2011-06-30T07:17:00.000Z	Sorinan		what grub is default, 1 or 2?
2011-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	Sorinan		ok, lemme try it
2011-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	That error message means that you have a different version of grub in the mbr+embedded area than in /boot/grub/. Do you have more than one hard drive?
2011-06-30T07:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Try changing the boot order in your BIOS, or as ActionParsnip suggested re-install grub from a LiveCD (making sure that you install it to the drive you're BIOS is booting from, or to all drives).
2011-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	Sorinan	Jordan_U	I found the problem: installer put GRUB on pendrive, and was trying to boot from there
2011-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	How did you determine that? Can you file about it?
2011-06-30T07:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Once you're booted into Ubuntu can you pastebin the output of "debconf-show grub-pc"?
2011-06-30T07:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Your sentences are not clear (to me at least). Can you boot Ubuntu sucessfully right now or not?
2011-06-30T07:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	OK. Have you tried changing the boot order (among your internal drives) yet?
2011-06-30T07:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Ubuntu's USB Startup Disk Creator will re-install syslinux to the mbr automatically.
2011-06-30T07:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Once you're booted from the LiveUSB again please run boot info script and pastebin the RESULTS.txt it produces.
2011-06-30T08:00:00.000Z	Sorinan	Jordan_U	what would be the best debian way to reinstall grub2?
2011-06-30T08:08:00.000Z	Sorinan	Jordan_U	now it booted and its working. still wnat boot info?
2011-06-30T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Yes.
2011-06-30T08:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	And by working do you mean you're currently able to boot the installed system? If so, how did you fix it?
2011-06-30T08:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sorinan	Can you pastebin the output of "debconf-show grub-pc"?
2011-06-30T08:21:00.000Z	Sorinan	Jordan_U	any idea?
2011-06-30T08:27:00.000Z	Sorinan	Jordan_U	im having a strange problem now, it does login but does not load Unity menus, altought the mouse moves, I see the background and I can change to VT. Im using a RV770 based card (Radeon HD4870). it is supposed to work?
