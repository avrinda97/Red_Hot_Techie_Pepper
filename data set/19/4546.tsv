2008-12-24T09:59:00.000Z	hashbrowns		I just installed ubuntu in a dualboot scenario and windows still automatically boots.  What can I do about this>
2008-12-24T10:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	What did you use for your bootloader?
2008-12-24T10:02:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	well I dont know if it installed GRUB or not. I'm guessing not since windows still auto boots.  How can I install grub without having to install ubuntu again?

2008-12-24T10:15:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	I did what that link said and it didnt work.
2008-12-24T10:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	How many hard drives?
2008-12-24T10:16:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	3 all sata. 2 are 250GB and 1 is 500GB
2008-12-24T10:17:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	Are you sure you installed it to the same hard drive that BIOS boots from?
2008-12-24T10:18:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	no im not sure. How do I check this?
2008-12-24T10:18:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	You'd have to boot into BIOS and look around, it's usually under like "Standard CMOS features" or something similar
2008-12-24T10:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	Make sure the boot order tells it to boot to the drive with grub first
2008-12-24T10:20:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	yes it is.
2008-12-24T10:20:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	And you installed grub to the MBR?
2008-12-24T10:21:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	I think so.  Thats what that link you gave me said that would do and I followed the guide to the T.
2008-12-24T10:22:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	Do you have any other installations of linux on any partitions except the one you just installed?
2008-12-24T10:22:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	no not of linux.
2008-12-24T10:22:00.000Z	dmsuperman	hashbrowns	Then honestly I'm not sure why it's booting to the windows bootloader
2008-12-24T10:23:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	dang.  I've been having this issue for like 2 days now.
2008-12-24T10:23:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dmsuperman	no one has been able to help me fix it.
