2012-02-20T13:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	I assume your browser on the same system is working due to proxy?
2012-02-20T13:34:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	No, i´m not using a proxy
2012-02-20T13:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	what browser?
2012-02-20T13:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	some browser have auto proxy
2012-02-20T13:35:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	midori
2012-02-20T13:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	when you say you don't have cli access to internet, does that mean that wget a page fails?  maybe just port 80 works on your isp?
2012-02-20T13:42:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	can´t ping either..
2012-02-20T13:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	ping is not port 80 and most windows systems mask ping
2012-02-20T13:43:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	If i can´t ping google...
2012-02-20T13:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	again ping is not port 80,  what about wget ?
2012-02-20T13:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	wget will use port 80
2012-02-20T13:44:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	I can´t install packages, doesn´t that include port 80?
2012-02-20T13:45:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	Wait, what? :| wget on google works... mind=fucked
2012-02-20T13:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	my work also filtered only let out and in on port 80
2012-02-20T13:46:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	But, i could install packages yesterday.. and at my other ubuntu box...
2012-02-20T13:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	you can setup your home system to have ssh open on port 80 then you can connect to that and access the world from work
2012-02-20T13:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	that's what we did to watch porn from work
2012-02-20T13:50:00.000Z	K-4U	sacarlson	no.. it´s weird, i couldn´t install packages a couple of minutes ago, now i can..
2012-02-20T13:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	K-4U	well packages can still be installed on port 80 so take out the repository that don't us port 80
