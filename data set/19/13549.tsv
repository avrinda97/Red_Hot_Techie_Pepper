2005-05-13T16:38:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	yeah
2005-05-13T16:38:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	Hmm..
2005-05-13T16:33:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	you can type ctrl-alt-bksp
2005-05-13T16:34:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	The keylogger can simulate this.
2005-05-13T16:34:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	this will restart the X server
2005-05-13T16:34:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	so, it can't.
2005-05-13T16:34:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	X doesn't allow capturing that combination?
2005-05-13T16:36:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	I understood Windows reserves ctrl + alt + del, so no application can cut in the middle. Windows 2k also encourages to do so by not showing the login until ctrl + alt + del has been pressed.
2005-05-13T16:37:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	sorry, back
2005-05-13T16:37:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	Well....
2005-05-13T16:37:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	It could remap the KB
2005-05-13T16:38:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	It could?
2005-05-13T16:38:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	I honestly don't see a completely safe way
2005-05-13T16:39:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	There is always hw-keyloggers.
2005-05-13T16:39:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	well, of course
2005-05-13T16:39:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	But any act to help with the problem is good.
2005-05-13T16:39:00.000Z	cyberix	toresbe	So this should be discussed somewhere
2005-05-13T16:39:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	I'm asking in #ubuntu-devel
2005-05-13T16:40:00.000Z	toresbe	cyberix	feel free to join
