2008-04-07T19:22:00.000Z	shjordan		-ERR Unable to find folder inbox on remote server
2008-04-07T19:24:00.000Z	DJones	shjordan	i've not come across that error before, but as a thought, how old is your hotmail email address? I know MS changed hotmail so that only accounts which are paid for, or are about 5-6 years old can use smtp, that could be the reason why it won't work
2008-04-07T19:25:00.000Z	shjordan	DJones	but i use Live Hotmail... it have 4+ years old...

2008-04-07T19:27:00.000Z	DJones	shjordan	have you ever been able to access hotmail via smtp on windows?  There's also a setting in your hotmail profile that you have to configure to allow smtp/pop3, although I can't remember where it is, I've got a feeling that your hotmail account might be too new to allow it though, I'm sure its older accounts than that
2008-04-07T19:28:00.000Z	shjordan	DJones	Yes, I always used it...
2008-04-07T19:28:00.000Z	shjordan		send and receive e-mails
2008-04-07T19:31:00.000Z	DJones	shjordan	I haven't got an answer for you, all I can suggest  is asking in the channel to see if anybody else can help, and double checking that all teh settings in the walkthrough are correct
2008-04-07T19:31:00.000Z	shjordan		=/
2008-04-07T19:32:00.000Z	shjordan	DJones	 is there any evolution channel?
2008-04-07T19:35:00.000Z	DJones	shjordan	There is, but its on a different server I don't know if there's a specific evolution channel
2008-04-07T19:35:00.000Z	DJones	shjordan	There's a channel list on here that may be able to help http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/
