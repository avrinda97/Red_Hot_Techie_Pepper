2008-12-17T08:21:00.000Z	dva5912		i dont know. maby its something with my networking.
2008-12-17T08:21:00.000Z	dva5912		doubt it though every thing else works
2008-12-17T08:22:00.000Z	dva5912		 * ALERT: exim paniclog /var/log/exim4/paniclog has non-zero size, mail system possibly broken
2008-12-17T08:22:00.000Z	dva5912		that might be my problem
2008-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	dva5912		where is the log that exim makes when it processes a request?
2008-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	dva5912		2008-12-16 21:25:50 socket bind() to port 25 for address 127.0.0.1 failed: Address already in use: waiting 30s before trying again (2 more tries)
2008-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	dva5912		   This is a frequent item in the list looks like a problem. What is wrong?
2008-12-17T08:28:00.000Z	dva5912		what command can i use to see wahts using port 25
2008-12-17T08:29:00.000Z	dva5912		omg. can anyone see what im typing
2008-12-17T08:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	i think it's  /var/log/mail or something
2008-12-17T08:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	i think it's  /var/log/mail.log
2008-12-17T08:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	there's several log files in there.... mail.warn, mail.log, mail.info, and... the big one... mail.err
2008-12-17T08:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	i can't be much help with that really. but i thought i'd at least let you know we can see you typing in here! :-) perhaps there is a #exim or #exim4 channel if you don't get help in here? i don't know tho
2008-12-17T08:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	i have an idea
2008-12-17T08:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	take a look at your /etc/hosts file... you might need to set it up so that your system is an FQDN in it
2008-12-17T08:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	you still here?
2008-12-17T08:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	you still here?
2008-12-17T08:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dva5912	where did you go?
