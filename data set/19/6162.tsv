2008-03-04T05:11:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> which interface name of linus is the one thats connected to the switch? and you set it in promiscous mode?
2008-03-04T05:13:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> now does linux eth0 have an ip address assigned? can you ping it from the wired client?
2008-03-04T05:15:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> really? you would not be able to assign an ip address to eth0? i would think you could, as the brctl interface br0 is different from eth0.. i may be wrong but that is how my thoughts are
2008-03-04T05:16:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> i thought they use the same tcp/ip stack now..but i could be wrong too..
2008-03-04T05:16:00.000Z	amenado		hooper82-> what is the issue?
2008-03-04T05:17:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> i see, i didnt know that dhcpd would not bind to eth0 if its a bridge..
2008-03-04T05:18:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> you really meant dhcp not dhcpd ?
2008-03-04T05:19:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> you got an interesting setup there..
2008-03-04T05:20:00.000Z	amenado		tominglis-> you compiled a kernel module and you put it where?
2008-03-04T05:21:00.000Z	amenado		hooper82-> what is the issue?  i missed your response if any
2008-03-04T05:21:00.000Z	tominglis_	amenado	/lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/kernel
2008-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	tominglis_	amenado	both ubuntu/media/usbvideo and drivers/media/video/usbvideo
2008-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	tominglis_	amenado	but i should have put it in /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/ubuntu/media/usbvideo, which i've now done, but should i just delete the two old files?
2008-03-04T05:23:00.000Z	amenado	tominglis	yes, you can delete those kernel modules you put in the wrong directory
2008-03-04T05:24:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> you are bridging your wireless card to his AP? and his AP is in bridge mode?
2008-03-04T05:24:00.000Z	tominglis_	amenado	ace, is there anything else i need to do, someone said i should change the makefile back to the bad addresses and sudo make uninstall but that doesn't work
2008-03-04T05:25:00.000Z	amenado		tominglis-> i would not touch the Makefile..or if you have to, modify the install target instead
2008-03-04T05:25:00.000Z	amenado		sdfewfs-> thats what i want to know, you are using his AP or your own AP?
2008-03-04T05:26:00.000Z	tominglis_	amenado	thanks loads
