2006-01-07T08:06:00.000Z	alexwillmer		than your version of gtkpod can handle
2006-01-07T08:07:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	real    0m17.434s
2006-01-07T07:54:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	I wait no time, once the icon disappears I consider it safe
2006-01-07T07:56:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	how is your stick mounted? sync?
2006-01-07T07:57:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	whatever the defaults are
2006-01-07T07:57:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	is it a fat stick?
2006-01-07T07:58:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	erm?? The device is a 60GB 2.5" USB 2 HD, with a VFAT partition
2006-01-07T07:59:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	but you can't tell if you copy let's say 50 MB and then click eject it's unmounted in a second and all data is written ?!
2006-01-07T08:00:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	I've always treated it as something that, 'Just Works'
2006-01-07T08:01:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	then I suppose your hd is mounted sync or something like that... My stick takes about 20 seconds to unmount after having copied 50 mb
2006-01-07T08:01:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	I've copied large files and then unmounted and unplugged without delay, I've not noticed corruption
2006-01-07T08:01:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	your stick will be flash, which is slow to write to, perhaps my HD has the same behaviour, but the dely is smaller
2006-01-07T08:02:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	same behaviour with my usb disk
2006-01-07T08:02:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	disk as in spinning platter with magnetic read head?
2006-01-07T08:03:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	no one of those harddisks with a usb port
2006-01-07T08:04:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	that didn't enlighten me
2006-01-07T08:04:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	wait. I'llt tell you the time it takes when I umount my USB FLASH stick after a 50 mb copy process
2006-01-07T08:11:00.000Z	alexwillmer	ppd	ouch. I assumed the icon was there until sync was complete. Beyond the length of the delay, which is likely flash write or usb 1.0 bus speed, I can't suggest anything
2006-01-07T08:13:00.000Z	ppd	alexwillmer	hyakuhei, thank you very very much ! I think is clearly a usability bug... :-/
