2012-08-22T04:46:00.000Z	critt		Why Can't Ubuntu Leave you personal settings alone when we do upates?
2012-08-22T04:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	it does
2012-08-22T04:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	the settings in $HOME are untouched
2012-08-22T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	maybe the old config is not compatible with the old settings
2012-08-22T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	try launching it from terminal, it may give clues
2012-08-22T04:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	what is the issue then?
2012-08-22T04:52:00.000Z	critt	ActionParsnip	It stopped launching at startup after I did a system update
2012-08-22T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	try removing the startup item and readd it
2012-08-22T04:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	you may need to make a small script to run the dock if compiz is not loaded fast enough
2012-08-22T04:53:00.000Z	critt	ActionParsnip	can try that.
2012-08-22T04:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	I can bash you one out, what is the command to run cairo?

2012-08-22T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	ah, then modify the command to:  cairo-dock
2012-08-22T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	obviously delete the current startup item
2012-08-22T04:59:00.000Z	critt	ActionParsnip	the command is cairo-dock already
2012-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	critt	ActionParsnip	created the script gonna go give it a try.. Thanks
2012-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	np, its not a hard script at all, as you can see
2012-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	critt	its nothing you don't know how to do
