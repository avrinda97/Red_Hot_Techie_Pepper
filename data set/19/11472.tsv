2006-01-16T10:10:00.000Z	lysis		HELP! what bootloader will allow me to type something simple like "boot into dapper drake"?   i do a lot on my pc from work, so i'd like to be able to reboot into my other distros i have installed if possible.
2006-01-16T10:11:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	I don't think I understand your question. Most bootloaders, lilo, grub, should do that.
2006-01-16T10:12:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	Wouldn't it be the same as booting into windows or linux? Am I missing something?
2006-01-16T10:12:00.000Z	lysis	veganpops	i have 3 separate ubuntu partitions.  one is my primary, one is my testing (so i don't break the primary haha) and one is dapper drake to check it out.    i have to modify /boot/grub/menu.lst and change the default partition to boot into while i'm SSH'd into my box from away
2006-01-16T10:13:00.000Z	lysis		all of my partitions have SSH installed, and i'd like to be able to do work on all of them while away.
2006-01-16T10:13:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	You like to make life hard for yourself. :)
2006-01-16T10:14:00.000Z	lysis	veganpops	i am trying to get E17 working, so i am doing it on my testing ubuntu before i do it live.   i've had to re-install ubuntu 3 times within a week because i effed up E17 everytime.
2006-01-16T10:15:00.000Z	lysis	veganpops	so because of this, i'd like to figure out how to do "reboot into Testuntu" (what i called testing)          i know SUSE has something similar from what i've heard . . .  PC-BSD has a grpahical interface at the login screen that lets you reboot into a different partition without going through the bootloader.
2006-01-16T10:15:00.000Z	lysis	veganpops	so basically i'm trying to make my life easier. =)
2006-01-16T10:16:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	Perhaps you could write a script do quickly swap menu.lst files and install.
2006-01-16T10:16:00.000Z	lysis	veganpops	i don't know how. =)    could you direct me where i can learn about writing scripts?
2006-01-16T10:17:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	Sorry, I don't know of a pre-packaged solution for this.
2006-01-16T10:17:00.000Z	lysis	veganpops	that's fine.  i want to learn how to do it. =)
2006-01-16T10:17:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	You can basically make a script just by putting the same commands you type at the command prompt into a file.
2006-01-16T10:17:00.000Z	lysis		hmmm.
2006-01-16T10:18:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	Then make the file executable. chmod +x myfile
2006-01-16T10:18:00.000Z	lysis		hmm.   i'll look into this
2006-01-16T10:18:00.000Z	lysis		thanks guys!
2006-01-16T10:19:00.000Z	veganpops	lysis	I would try something like making menu.lst a soft link.
