2009-04-23T10:47:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		!ipod | ela_
2009-04-23T10:48:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		argh
2009-04-23T10:48:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		lol
2009-04-23T10:48:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		its probably intended
2009-04-23T10:49:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		cp -r
2009-04-23T10:50:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		u may want to mv the existing .firefox file to .firefox.bak just incase
2009-04-23T10:52:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		thats not going to work paul68 because those . file come as u install those apps.. u would need to build a exact replica of ur packages to even try that
2009-04-23T10:53:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade		example i dont believe .eclips is a default package.. therefore the .eclipse folder would be useless,, and even when u installed eclipse i believe it would just write its own
2009-04-23T10:53:00.000Z	paul68	BladeNBrocade	its just for thunderbird that I want to do this to make sure that I don't have to rebuild my folder structure and rules that I have set
2009-04-23T10:53:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	paul68	that may work..
2009-04-23T10:54:00.000Z	paul68	BladeNBrocade	ok thanks
2009-04-23T10:54:00.000Z	paul68	BladeNBrocade	is there a way to export rules from thunderbird?
2009-04-23T10:55:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	paul68	good question,, i would check the menu,,there is a defined import submenu.. possible there u would see.. it sounds like something do able.. i would imagine that would be the GUI port to doing exactly what u are trying to do manually..
2009-04-23T10:56:00.000Z	paul68	BladeNBrocade	ok thanks
2009-04-23T11:01:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	paul68	looks like thunderbird has an extension for this as well
2009-04-23T11:30:00.000Z	paul68	BladeNBrocade	we have a service level of 95% to be solved directly on first call and we are actually at 99%
2009-04-23T11:31:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	paul68	awesome... our competitors are people like IBM,,, we just partnered with Cisco because they dont support applications.. the work flow just increased by alsmost 250% .. yes @ the central office i can only say we have 80 people at most..
2009-04-23T11:32:00.000Z	paul68	BladeNBrocade	ouch thats a lot of work lol
