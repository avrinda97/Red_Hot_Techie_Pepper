2009-06-08T11:50:00.000Z	loof		confuseduser945: it's not as easy as backing up the files in terms of restoring to the exact same state you were in before, if you want to do that, then you should do a drive image with a tool meant to do that. if you just wanna save your files though, like your images and movies and work files, just back those up and when you reinstall windows you can just drop them in place
2009-06-08T11:51:00.000Z	loof		eevee: woops, typo on my part, i meant how do you slow stuff down in dosbox, using dosbox .73

2009-06-08T11:59:00.000Z	simplexio	loof	they say that i7 is too expensive an i5 good enought for market
2009-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	loof	simplexio	can't run sli on an i5 though
2009-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	loof	simplexio	i5'll be decent but it's meant to be a cutdown i7, and it's not coming out for a while still, anyways
2009-06-08T12:02:00.000Z	simplexio	loof	yeah.. i have heard that i7 is faaast.. so i hope i get money to buy one before they stop selling it

2009-06-08T12:04:00.000Z	simplexio	loof	my friends got one few weeks ago. he told that comparing to opteron 165 (sam as i have) its feels like 10 times faster, and he didnt get 100% processor use when he first tested it
