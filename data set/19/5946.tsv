2008-05-14T03:47:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	iptables doesn't need refreshing.. if you changed something it's changed when the command returns
2008-05-14T03:47:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Slart	the changes i've made haven't been put into effect, the commands were valid and showed up on status as working
2008-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Slart	but they don't work when i have a client test them
2008-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	are you working directly on the iptables then? not using some other firewall software?
2008-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Slart	yes, just iptables
2008-05-14T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	what kind of commands have you tried?

2008-05-14T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	looks correct.. but I haven't messed with iptables for a long time.. you're running this on a computer directly connect to the internet?
2008-05-14T03:51:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Slart	no, through a router with firewall disabled
2008-05-14T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	setting up port forwarding for something? are you sure the ports are forwarded properly?
2008-05-14T03:52:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Slart	port forwarding isn't needed in the router, the firewall is disabled
2008-05-14T03:54:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	well.. as I said.. afaik iptables works instantly.. no need to "activate" the rules or "refresh" anything..
2008-05-14T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	but iptables are messy to work with.. hundreds of ways of making a mistake =)
2009-01-24T02:09:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	I don't think there is.. you'll need to run windows for that
2009-02-01T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	I guess you can use a theme that has really small borders, or none at all
2009-10-23T23:48:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	not really sure how this works these days.. but on earlier versions of ubuntu you could just insert the cd and you'd get a popup asking if you wanted to use it to update from
2009-10-23T23:50:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Slart	thank you; i remember using an alternative installation cd to do this once :D
2009-10-23T23:50:00.000Z	Slart	D3RGPS31	you're welcome.. I think both the alternate and the desktop cd's did this..
