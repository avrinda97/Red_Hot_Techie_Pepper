2009-12-24T05:41:00.000Z	forceflow		never used the launcher again ...
2009-12-24T05:43:00.000Z	forceflow		yeah
2009-12-24T05:43:00.000Z	forceflow		a pro for the UNR is that it comes with less applications
2009-12-24T05:43:00.000Z	forceflow		no evolution, cd burner, ...
2009-12-24T05:43:00.000Z	forceflow		but you can achieve that just as easily by removing them from regular ubuntu
2009-12-24T05:43:00.000Z	forceflow		it's all up to you :)
2009-12-24T05:44:00.000Z	forceflow		I've got an eeePC 1005HA
2009-12-24T05:44:00.000Z	forceflow		and I'm okay with ubuntu
2009-12-24T05:45:00.000Z	forceflow		UNR comes without the desktop tracker thing too
2009-12-24T05:45:00.000Z	forceflow		so less services, less apps
2009-12-24T05:45:00.000Z	gawk	forceflow	I have a 900HD, have you encountered anything like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi/+bug/433729 ?
2009-12-24T05:45:00.000Z	forceflow		I like to start with less, instead of removing stuff :)
2009-12-24T05:46:00.000Z	forceflow	gawk	yeah, sometimes
2009-12-24T05:46:00.000Z	forceflow		my wireless-repair script is just sudo rmmod ath9k and sudo modprobe ath9k
2009-12-24T05:46:00.000Z	forceflow		usually solves wireless quirks after suspend/hibernate :)
2009-12-24T05:47:00.000Z	forceflow		I get 7 hours on Ubuntu 9.10 with wifi on
2009-12-24T05:47:00.000Z	forceflow		and about 10-11 with wifi off
2009-12-24T05:47:00.000Z	gawk	forceflow	it doesn't like to wake up :p
2009-12-24T05:47:00.000Z	forceflow	gawk	you got that right
