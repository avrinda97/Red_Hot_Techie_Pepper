2005-03-15T10:56:00.000Z	xed	mebaran151	So my point was valid..
2005-03-15T11:01:00.000Z	mebaran151	xed	why are you going to a windows set up
2005-03-15T11:01:00.000Z	xed	mebaran151	Going to create a dummy NTFS partition, and then go back to set up for Ubuntu and destroy that partion, and use it for UBuntu
2005-03-15T11:02:00.000Z	xed	mebaran151	Yeah, but I want to use Windows for gaming. =|
2005-03-15T11:02:00.000Z	xed	mebaran151	Even so, I have seperated Windows from the files I need..onto a different partition
2005-03-15T11:03:00.000Z	mebaran151	xed	how did you do that?
