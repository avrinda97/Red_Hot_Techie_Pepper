2011-06-12T10:53:00.000Z	Drone4four		i lost my wirless connection to my router and thus to the internet.  the error message simply says: wireless is disabled by hardware switch.  i googled it and came across this ubuntu forum thread to which i replied and included the input and output of various commands: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1779676
2011-06-12T10:54:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	Have a switch/button/etc. somewhere on your lapto to enable/disable wireless?
2011-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	Or a function key combo.
2011-06-12T10:57:00.000Z	Drone4four		as a matter of fact, rationalOgre, i do have a function key which looks like an i with waves emanating from it like a radio tower
2011-06-12T10:57:00.000Z	Drone4four		i was playing with that function key
2011-06-12T10:58:00.000Z	Drone4four		and just tried pressing it, but i still can't connect to the internet
2011-06-12T10:58:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	Did you chord the key? Most keys like that you have to hold another key to activate it.
2011-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	Drone4four	rationalOgre	what do you mean by chord?
2011-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	See the Fn key between your CTRL and Windows keys?
2011-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	Drone4four		yes
2011-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	rationalOgre		Hold it and hit the key with the wireless icon
2011-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	Drone4four		that's what i did
2011-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	Drone4four		there, it worked
2011-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	Drone4four		i just had to hold it down for 5 seconds
2011-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	Sometimes you have to hit it a time or two.
2011-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	Drone4four		thanks rationalOgre
2011-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	You're welcome.
2011-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	Drone4four		=D
2011-06-12T11:01:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Drone4four	For future reference, hitting keys in tandem is called chording.
