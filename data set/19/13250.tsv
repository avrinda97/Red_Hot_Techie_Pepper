2008-04-27T10:22:00.000Z	m1dn1ght		Can anyone please tell me how about increasing the maximum resolution on my screen?  I seem to be stuck with 800x600 as the max when I try and change it
2008-04-27T10:23:00.000Z	m1dn1ght		oh - I thought this was a temporary thing.  I assumed once I had ubuntu up and running I could download the appropriate drivers maybe?
2008-04-27T10:24:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	what video chip do you have?  lspci | grep -i vga will tell you
2008-04-27T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	m1dn1ght there's a driver for it, I gotta remember
2008-04-27T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	install xserver-xorg-video-sis (duh)
2008-04-27T10:32:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	  sudo apt-get install  xserver-xorg-video-sis , then log out and back in. If X is as smart as it's supposed to be now, it should recognized the driver
2008-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	sounds like you have it.   do   gedit /var/log/Xorg.0.log , and copy and paste to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	nope, no change
2008-04-27T10:37:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	ok, it sees the sis chip but is using the vesa driver.  now show us /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-04-27T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	see cky above ;)
2008-04-27T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	no, that's a different hardware issue (probably)
2008-04-27T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	do:   cd /etc/X11 && sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.beforenickrudmuckedabout && sudo gedit xorg.conf   , then edit vesa to sis. Save, log out and back in
2008-04-27T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	not sure then. I've never used the sis chip. Let me do a little googling
2008-04-27T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	that was a 771/671 , right?
2008-04-27T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	what chips set do you have again?
2008-04-27T10:58:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	the chip numbers, 761/771 ? was that right?
2008-04-27T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	  lspci | grep -i  vga
2008-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	the only thing I could find was http://gabrielstein.org/?p=201 , but your mileage may vary. I did see a gentoo post that seemed to do the same thing.
2008-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	m1dn1ght	the gentoo post didn't have the link to the driver, though so I'm not sure if he used the same one
