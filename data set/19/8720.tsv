2008-10-17T20:08:00.000Z	soho		compiz is great!
2008-10-17T20:08:00.000Z	soho		how can i find out what version my compiz is?
2008-10-17T20:08:00.000Z	LjL	soho	apt-cache policy compiz
2008-11-18T04:08:00.000Z	LjL	soho	"vuln"?
2008-11-18T04:08:00.000Z	LjL	soho	yes, it's exploitable.
2008-11-18T04:09:00.000Z	LjL	soho	the probability that some yet to be discovered exploit exists for your Ubuntu release approaches 100%.
2008-11-18T04:09:00.000Z	LjL	soho	you cannot prevent it.
2008-11-18T04:09:00.000Z	LjL	soho	you can also realize, however, that if you keep your system updated, safe from physical intrusion and perhaps behind a NAT'ing router, chances of anything bad happening are pretty low.
2008-11-18T04:10:00.000Z	LjL	soho	nonsense.
2008-11-18T04:11:00.000Z	LjL	soho	there's no such thing as the "best way" to make something "secure" in general. security is a compromise that depends on your needs.
2008-11-18T04:11:00.000Z	soho	LjL	is it possible
2008-11-18T04:11:00.000Z	LjL	soho	if you don't know what compromise you're looking for, then you're probably best off just using Ubuntu as provided by default, as the developers strive to make it very secure for the average user.
2008-11-18T04:11:00.000Z	LjL	soho	yes. it's also strongly discouraged.
2008-11-18T04:11:00.000Z	soho	LjL	how come?
2008-11-18T04:12:00.000Z	LjL	soho	because the packaged kernel that comes with your Ubuntu release was tuned and tested for it. months have been spent doing that.
2008-11-18T04:12:00.000Z	LjL	soho	if you want to roll your own kernel, you'll actually *miss any pushed security updates*, for a start, which would *open* your system to very serious security risks.
2008-11-18T04:25:00.000Z	LjL	soho	if you use weak passwords.
2008-11-18T04:33:00.000Z	LjL	soho	how do you know it's still there?
2008-11-18T04:37:00.000Z	LjL	soho	then that's because you removed the package but the program is still running in memory. either reboot, or type "sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 stop"
