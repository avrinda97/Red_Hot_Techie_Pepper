2012-02-23T00:15:00.000Z	Canadian1296_		umm hasan: Could be a physical problem with the disk
2012-02-23T00:17:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	windows started acting crazy all of a suddon, i could not run a defrag, or virus scan, or browse the internet.........things took about 5hrs to show up with an error...........so, i stupidly did a check disk with repair and it 'repaired' TONS of files then upon restart, the os was gone
2012-02-23T00:18:00.000Z	Canadian1296_	ummhasan	Sounds suspciously like a virus to me...
2012-02-23T00:18:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	i put in my recovery disk but it also cant see the os........so i decided to run some fixmbr, fixboot, etc........nothing worked............so i decided to see if i can put ubuntu on the drive since windows is no where to be found
2012-02-23T00:19:00.000Z	Canadian1296_	ummhasan	You'll have to wipe the disk...
2012-02-23T00:19:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	ok, can u tell me how to do that ........... gparted cant see any devices
2012-02-23T00:20:00.000Z	Canadian1296_	ummhasan	in terminal try "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt"

2012-02-23T00:42:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	ok thanks i'll try again
2012-02-23T00:47:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	i tried both
2012-02-23T00:47:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	with the lowercase l, it just takes me to the next line
2012-02-23T00:48:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	a blank command line and when i ran the command you said before running the one llutz said, it gave me what i posted in the link
2012-02-23T00:51:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	sorry for seperating my comments - let me be clear.  1. i ran the command u said with a lowercase L not a number 1 and it gave me what i linked to, 2. i then tried it with a number 1 and it gave me 'mount -t command not found', 3. then i ran the command llutz said first with a number 1 and then with a letter lowercase L.....
2012-02-23T00:53:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	when i ran the command llutz gave, with the number 1 i got 'fdisk invalid option -1'..........i then tried the lowercase L and got a new command line
2012-02-23T00:54:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	that gives me the new command line
2012-02-23T00:57:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	with sudo
2012-02-23T01:01:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296_	allright..........thanks for your time..........i have to leave...........i suppose i'll just put another hard drive in the computer and go from there.
