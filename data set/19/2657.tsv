2011-02-21T23:38:00.000Z	sirninja		My laptop isn't suspending (but only sometimes) this is a new issue so I'm guessing something I installed is causing it, where can I find the log that would tell me what is preventing it from suspending?

2011-02-21T23:41:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	do you have cgroup-bin installed?
2011-02-21T23:42:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	no I don't. I remember that causing me problems in the past though
2011-02-21T23:43:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	I was logged into a tty at the time, think that could be related?
2011-02-21T23:46:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	well it does cause suspend failures due to how it moves kernel threads around (cgroup-bin), being logged in on a terminal shouldn't matter
2011-02-21T23:47:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	theres a page on the ubuntu wiki about troubleshooting suspend, basically you can simulate it to see if any separate part of it fails to work; and if any of those lock it up or cause an oops it should be visible, if not you can use netconsole to send the messages during suspend to another computer, both are to narrow down where it happens
2011-02-21T23:48:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	In my pm-suspend.log file, the last line is showing: "Mon Feb 21 11:40:13 CST 2011: performing suspend". So does that mean that it might be a kernel issue or something?
2011-02-21T23:49:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	well that's only one message of many, the one that made it to a log; there are actually a lot more that you wont see depending on where it fails
2011-02-21T23:50:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	any advice. The reason this seems strange to me is suspend had been working perfectly for about a year now. And it seems that even if I go back to older kernels, the issue persists
2011-02-21T23:52:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	yea i had some of my own problems like that; one was the intel video drive for a time, the rest was cgroup-bin; you should try going into the bios and using the "restore defaults" thing, but figuring it out yourself you'll need more logging information
2011-02-21T23:54:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	I'll give that a try. It would be much easier to track down the issue if it happened consistently, but currently it just seems random. :/
2011-02-21T23:54:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	yep, it's annoying; the intel thing was like that, are you running 10.04?
2011-02-21T23:55:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	I'm on 10.10. I do have an integrated intel video card though if that's what you're talking about
2011-02-21T23:56:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	right, you might try the xorg-edgers ppa, it has updated drivers. but i haven't seen the failure as you describe it here in a long while; the patches were pushed into the regular driver
2011-02-21T23:57:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	Hmm. Do you know if there's a process that's eating up the cpu and can't be killed if that could possibly be causing this?
2011-02-21T23:57:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	not likely, if you're talking about what i think you're talking about it's a kernel thread and will drain on suspend, is it kworker or something?
2011-02-21T23:58:00.000Z	ohsix	sirninja	rather, kslowd*
2011-02-21T23:59:00.000Z	sirninja	ohsix	I recently installed one program that has occasionally stopped working and starts eating up cpu.. it's just been buggy in general, I may see if that's part of it
