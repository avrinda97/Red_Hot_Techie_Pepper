2009-09-07T20:37:00.000Z	kd		I dont want to go back to RHEL
2009-09-07T20:37:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	I don't think it's a system issue, maybe your monitor cable or something else is causing the issues
2009-09-07T20:29:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	What's your problem, maybe someone can help you if you tell us where you need help first :)
2009-09-07T20:31:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	??
2009-09-07T20:32:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	Did you install the newest Graphiccard drivers using the Ubuntu driver tool?
2009-09-07T20:33:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	According to what I observed, my graphics are sharper than previous versions... however, I do observe lot of flikerings
2009-09-07T20:34:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	Did you set the monitor refresh rate according to your monitors manual ?
2009-09-07T20:35:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	Well, then I have no Idea besides hardware issues :/
2009-09-07T20:36:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	so far system testing has shown everything positive.. I wonder wht could possibly be the issue... coz... my ram is 2 GiB, HDD is spacious, Processor is good
2009-09-07T20:38:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	when exactly do the problems occur ?
2009-09-07T20:40:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	when I am on ubuntu and not on windows dual boot....
2009-09-07T20:40:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	so your monitor is only flickering when you're using ubuntu ?
2009-09-07T20:45:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	are you using an opensource X.org driver or the gpu vendor's driver?
2009-09-07T20:46:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	Sidewinder1 I have just installed and updated my ubuntu about 2 hours ago
2009-09-07T20:47:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	That's why I'm asking wich driver you do have installed
2009-09-07T20:47:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky123	kd	If it worked before it must be a driver or software issue
2009-09-07T20:49:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	Sidewinder1 Before means, I used hardy heron server edition and installed gnome on it.... and it was perfect... this is my desktop edition... of JJ... I am not using HH
2009-09-07T20:52:00.000Z	kd	KaffeeJunky123	Sidewinder1 Thank you for your help... i think I will go back to ubuntu server or old RHEL... I am loosing clients for new servers... cannot waste time... thnk u anways... god bless :-) bye
