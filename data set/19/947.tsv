2011-07-24T22:27:00.000Z	zenon		can i get ubuntu help in this channel?
2011-07-24T22:28:00.000Z	zenon		i have 11.04 running. and everything was fine. then one day, some updates got installed, and now it won't boot up.   it gets to the ubuntu logo with 4 dots.  the dots fill up, as in its finishing loading, and that's it
2011-07-24T22:28:00.000Z	zenon		just gets stuck there
2011-07-24T22:29:00.000Z	zenon		it doesn't
2011-07-24T22:29:00.000Z	zenon		doesn't do anything
2011-07-24T22:29:00.000Z	zenon		i thought it would remove the logo screen and show me the bootup process, but doesn't
2011-07-24T22:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	zenon	you might want to test if nomodeset makes a difference
2011-07-24T22:30:00.000Z	zykotick9		!nomodeset | zenon
2011-07-24T22:30:00.000Z	zenon		ok, so in grub i'll remove nomodeset
2011-07-24T22:30:00.000Z	zenon		maybe when a new kernel got installed it added it by default?
2011-07-24T22:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	zenon	do you already have nomodeset?  If you do, I wouldn't recommend removing it.
2011-07-24T22:30:00.000Z	zenon		let me check grub file
2011-07-24T22:31:00.000Z	zenon		i don't get why they moved the config files between grub and grub2
2011-07-24T22:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	zenon	"cat /etc/default/grub | grep nomodeset"
2011-07-24T22:32:00.000Z	zenon	zykotick9	don't have nomodeset in there
2011-07-24T22:32:00.000Z	zenon		right now i'm booted into recovery mode, with log graphics
2011-07-24T22:32:00.000Z	zenon		but if i boot into normal mode, gets stuck
2011-07-24T22:32:00.000Z	zenon		i guess i'll try booting with quiet off
2011-07-24T22:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	zenon	i'd test to see if it makes a difference, it likely won't.  I'd consider Kre10s_ suggestion of removing quite splash so you can see what's happening
