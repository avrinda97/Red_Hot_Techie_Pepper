2008-11-22T01:32:00.000Z	Reenen		sorry cyball, my bash is rusty beyond...
2008-11-22T01:34:00.000Z	Reenen		I *think* MS office is pretty well supported by wine
2008-11-22T01:35:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	i thought OO3 support reading of XP files but writes 2003 format, for the sake of backward compatibity?
2008-11-22T01:41:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	use SNMP with mrtg
2008-11-22T01:41:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	so I should install mrtg?
2008-11-22T01:42:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	lookup mrtg.
2008-11-22T01:52:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	yes, I think you're right
2008-11-22T02:00:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	we use mrtg at work to measure in/out traffic using snmp traps.
2008-11-22T01:58:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	mrtg seems to be something different, though can possibly do what I want
2008-11-22T01:59:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	I am on a 3g phone, and just want to see that what I am charged as using in terms of MB is similar to what I have logged that I've used
2008-11-22T02:01:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	I don't understand what that means, but can it do what I want it to do?
2008-11-22T02:01:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	but ithink mrtg will be a overkill for you, use vnstat
2008-11-22T02:02:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	in terms of vnstat... how do I set it to be "on" everytime I use my connection?
2008-11-22T02:03:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	call it inside your connection script? or something similar?
2008-11-22T02:04:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	or run vnstat all the time and set it to measure a certain interface
2008-11-22T02:04:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	thanks, I think I get it... now I must just figure out how to use vnstat, but "man vnstat" should work fine
2008-11-22T02:04:00.000Z	Reenen	jotil	I'd want it to run the whole time
2008-11-22T02:04:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	vnstat documentation will be able to guide you better.
2008-11-22T02:05:00.000Z	jotil	Reenen	to start vnstat at startup - you can put in on your rc.local
