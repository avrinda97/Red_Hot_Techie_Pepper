2009-02-07T01:40:00.000Z	Manix1		bizzle: can you help me with Nvidia GTX 280 driver installation?
2009-02-07T01:40:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	Try installing Envy-ng
2009-02-07T01:42:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	There's a front end for it, check synaptic and search for nvidia
2009-02-07T01:44:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	Front end, gui, graphical interface..
2009-02-07T01:49:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	It's blizzle.. try typing blizz <tab> And you want envyng-qt
2009-02-07T01:50:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	sorry I'm in low graphic mode right now because ubuntu wont load properly. I can barely read the chat
2009-02-07T01:53:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	No worries, it's just hard to see your responses when my name's not highlighted.
2009-02-07T01:54:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	is there a faster way to download this? it's going between 20-40kb/s
2009-02-07T01:56:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	Um, what are you downloading again, and from where? If it's an official repository, you might want to open Synaptic and select repositories, and do a test for the fastest one.
2009-02-07T02:01:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	much better thank you :)
2009-02-07T02:04:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	I tried installing the nvidia drivers from the nvidia website but during installation it said something about Xen kernal not being supported or something... what does that mean?
2009-02-07T02:06:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	Xen is a hypervisor. How that pertains to nvidia's drivers I know not :/
2009-02-07T02:08:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	well installed the recommended driver... wish me luck time for a reboot
2009-02-07T02:08:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	Bonne chance!
2009-02-07T02:42:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	 the Drivers are working but when I try to save a resolution change in the Nvidia x server settings app I get, "Failed to parse existing X config file /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2009-02-07T02:43:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	Check your xorg.conf file for syntax issues, perhaps.
2009-02-07T02:44:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	 again.. kinda new here :D How do I do that?
2009-02-07T02:47:00.000Z	Manix1	blizzle	how do I check my xorg.conf file for syntax issues
2009-02-07T02:48:00.000Z	blizzle	Manix1	This is the point in the conversation where I hand you over to google :)
