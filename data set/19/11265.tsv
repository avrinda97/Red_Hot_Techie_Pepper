2009-08-07T14:00:00.000Z	shreymech		i don knw how to use IRC
2009-08-07T14:00:00.000Z	shreymech		can any1 help me
2009-08-07T14:00:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	I suggest you to read the help pages of your IRC client
2009-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	so your problem is a wireless chipset? if so pastebin your lspci output into pastebin
2009-08-07T14:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	yes, but did you pastebin your lspci output?
2009-08-07T14:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	and why are you using older ubuntu for?
2009-08-07T14:06:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	generally no but I don't recommend it if you are on newer computer (most are) and that you aren't familiar with linux yet
2009-08-07T14:08:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	well, ok lets skip that, I need to know your wireless chipset or I can't help you.. so pastebin your lspci output
2009-08-07T14:08:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	be prepared to take on some challenges thoughã€€:P
2009-08-07T14:11:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	I see it and which kernel are you running? (uname -r)
2009-08-07T14:12:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	hmm.. I still recommend you to try latter version of ubuntu because of your wireless chipset
2009-08-07T14:13:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	yeah
2009-08-07T14:14:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	there is technically but only if you're up for the challenge, that is to get the driver and kernel headers (probably better if sources) and compile, modprobe it
2009-08-07T14:16:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	I wouldn't recommend ndiswrapper, the device is supported natively under linux and should generally work its weird that you're not getting interfaces from it.. are you sure you have wireless button on?
2009-08-07T14:18:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	you can try your luck here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=765647
2009-08-07T14:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	lol if it doesn't work I suggest you to get latest stable one :) that kernel version is rather ancient in wireless world
2009-08-07T14:25:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	lol up to you
2009-08-07T14:26:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	shreymech	that chipset is well supported from 2.6.24 onwards.. 2.6.24 is where they started trialling out a new wireless stack and I think its also where they have broken backward compatibility
