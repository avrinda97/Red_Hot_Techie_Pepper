2008-08-14T00:26:00.000Z	ratpoison		hello! is there anyway to learn my ip from bash?
2008-08-14T00:26:00.000Z	ratpoison		(not the lan ip)
2008-08-14T00:27:00.000Z	ratpoison		no, my external ip, the one I have on teh internets
2008-08-14T00:27:00.000Z	ratpoison		yeah, but I do have a widget that can show me that
2008-08-14T00:27:00.000Z	ratpoison		what command does this use, I wonder
2008-08-14T00:28:00.000Z	GleepGlop	ratpoison	wget http://Www.whatismyip.com -O - -o /dev/null | grep '<TITLE>' | sed -r 's/<TITLE>WhatIsMyIP\.com \- //g' | sed -r 's/<\/TITLE>//g'
2008-08-14T00:28:00.000Z	ratpoison		yeah, neither do my ports. but I can do nmap (insertip) -p (insertport) -PN and find out if my ports are open
2008-08-14T00:29:00.000Z	ratpoison	GleepGlop	thnx, not exactly convenient though

2008-08-14T00:36:00.000Z	ratpoison		well if a noob can conjure up a simple bash script in seconds, then what do you call one who can't? :p
