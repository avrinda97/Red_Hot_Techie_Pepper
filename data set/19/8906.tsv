2007-01-18T15:11:00.000Z	CThoma		hi@all
2007-01-18T15:13:00.000Z	CThoma		Could someone help me with ubuntu 6.10 server please? i have problems getting gnome or kde installed
2007-01-18T15:15:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	what problems you having?
2007-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	That's fine.  You can switch it to a Desktop real easy.  This is going to be a desktop computer?
2007-01-18T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	(really there's no distinction, you couldve installed with a regular Desktop CD, and still installed all your servers)
2007-01-18T15:17:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	No, it should only be used as server for our printers, files and fax (and maybe a small Apache and ftp)
2007-01-18T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	er, why are you installing a desktop on it then?
2007-01-18T15:18:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	Because my boss wants to saying "If you are not in the office i want to be able to handle linux"
2007-01-18T15:19:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	I am not so deep familiar with linux, so i thought server-edition sounds good
2007-01-18T15:19:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	alright, you'll ultimately have to decide which kernel you want (PREEMPT on (regular kernel) or off (server kernel))
2007-01-18T15:19:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	but, apart from whether PREEMPT is on or off, there's no difference in the system.
2007-01-18T15:19:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	And what exactly is PREEMPT?
2007-01-18T15:21:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	PREEMPT makes preemption (when one task interrupts another) easier/quicker.  When you have a lot of user input (desktop environment) it makes it more responsive
2007-01-18T15:22:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	oh, thx! Now i begin to understand
2007-01-18T15:24:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	anyway, the method you
2007-01-18T15:24:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	Should i use desktop or server now? Im confused...
2007-01-18T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	the method you'll install a desktop with, is simply "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" or swap "ubuntu-desktop" for "kubuntu-desktop" or "xubuntu-desktop"
2007-01-18T15:25:00.000Z	CThoma	Flannel	Ok, this way i get a desktop on my server system... thanks a lot
2007-01-18T15:27:00.000Z	Flannel	CThoma	and, if you ultimately decide to swap kernels to the regular one, install "linux-generic" and then remove "linux-server" and "linux-image-server"
