2009-06-08T01:46:00.000Z	bjjblue		this is so strange though... i literally shutdown the system, put it in my car, drove 15 minutes, and now it doesn't boot.
2009-06-08T01:47:00.000Z	bjjblue		that makes sense

2009-06-08T01:55:00.000Z	bjjblue	fccf	 i'm going to close it up and try ctrl-alt-f3
2009-06-08T01:58:00.000Z	bjjblue	fccf	ctrl alt f3 doesn't do anything
