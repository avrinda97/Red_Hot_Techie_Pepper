2006-05-21T11:18:00.000Z	rob_		if was to buy a new computer in the next few months, where should i look that would be a great system for dual booting?
2006-05-21T11:18:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	any machine that runs windows
2006-05-21T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	a year old machine is better
2006-05-21T11:19:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	how come a year old machine, my refurbished dell laptop has been a big problem with drivers
2006-05-21T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	a year old, to give the free guys a chance at it.
2006-05-21T11:20:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	would linux be able to utilize dual graphics cards?
2006-05-21T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	i don't think they have the dual pci-e (terminology?) for nvidia working, but who can without support from the manufactureres?
2006-05-21T11:23:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	but xinerama has a working technique
2006-05-21T11:23:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	okay
2006-05-21T11:23:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	what is that?
2006-05-21T11:24:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	a means of combining multiple cards/monitors onto a unifed desktop
2006-05-21T11:25:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	something that works in ubuntu?
2006-05-21T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	it's worked in my previous installs. I don't have that exact hardware in front of me, so I won't say it works now, except it has worked
2006-05-21T11:26:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	okay thanks
2006-05-21T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	this machine will be running breezy for a year yet, I expect to hear that same question close to a year from now :)\
2006-05-21T11:43:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	but isn't part of using linux tinkering it and updating and stuff
2006-05-21T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	well, there's another take: makde this damn machine work, and do it's job well. Who cares what version of software, as long as it's secure & does the job
2006-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	rob_	gmplayer from the cli
2006-05-21T12:26:00.000Z	rob_	nickrud	ahh now my video's don't show up, just audio
