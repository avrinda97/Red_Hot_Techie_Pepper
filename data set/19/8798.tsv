2007-06-11T10:41:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	you can't create an iso
2007-06-11T10:41:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	you can create an image of the partition though, although I dunno how
2007-06-11T10:42:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	sure you can
2007-06-11T10:42:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	but you can't create ISOs of a hard disk
2007-06-11T10:43:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	there's no way to create a Windows install CD from an installed Windows copy.
2007-06-11T10:43:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	you can however create an image file of the entire disk, although it won't fit on a CD
2007-06-11T10:45:00.000Z	cables	gamecheif	well this is not the place to ask that.
