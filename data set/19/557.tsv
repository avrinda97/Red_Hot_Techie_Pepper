2012-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	folsto		I am trying to run unetbootin. But it asks for password. Even if I enter correct passsword it says incorrect password.
2012-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	folsto		I also tried "gksu unetbootin". Same thing.
2012-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	folsto		I also updated the PPA to the one specifed in the website. And installed the new version. Same thing.
2012-01-10T23:35:00.000Z	folsto		Any suggestions? I need to copy a bootable iso to a usb. Are there any other tools which does similar function?
2012-01-10T23:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 dozens of tools at the pendrivelinux site. also it depends on which iso/disrto you are using.. ubuntu 11.10+ can use dd to put the iso image on a usb
2012-01-10T23:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	  the androud-x86 homepage may have guides on what tools to use. or try the pendrivelinux site.
2012-01-10T23:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 usb-creator i think is for ubuntu iso's only
2012-01-10T23:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 or just trry dd'ing the iso to a pendrive as a test.
2012-01-10T23:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/embedded/hwsw/software/android-installation-guide
2012-01-10T23:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 that url gives directions  using a tool from pendrivelinux
2012-01-10T23:47:00.000Z	folsto	dr_willis	It links to windows executable "Universal USB Installer". but I need to do in linux so I can copy the iso to *ext3* only usb drive
2012-01-10T23:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 the pendrivelinux site has directions and tools for linux as well..
2012-01-11T00:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 because the usb is an 'iso' filesystem. its also the exact size of the iso. (55mb i think)
2012-01-11T00:16:00.000Z	folsto	dr_willis	So isn't there a way to copy that iso to usb as other tools should do like unetbootin?
2012-01-11T00:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 i just did it with a tool from pendrivelinux. but i need to tweak the syslinux config file. it did a common error.
2012-01-11T00:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	folsto	 im not even sure how useable android on an i86 is at this time. It may be easier to just test it in virtualbox
2012-01-11T00:19:00.000Z	folsto	dr_willis	No I tried ICS 3.0.1 on a usb of fat32, its higly usable, multitouch, sound, wifi works. I have x86 tablet so it is very  handy.
2012-01-11T00:19:00.000Z	folsto	dr_willis	Meanwhile I am trying "live-usb-install" from pendrivelinux
2012-01-11T00:21:00.000Z	folsto	dr_willis	Thanks for the help, good night.
