2007-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Google it, im sure someone has got them working
2007-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	yep i just havent really found the time i've been more hoping for a simple solution to fall on me for that since its not that high up in my prioritys as my res is :S
2007-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Whats up with your res?
2007-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	just workin it out with premier on how to fix it but i seem to max my res out at 1024x768 which is a bother on my 22inch hd lcd
2007-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Did you try the good old adding them to xorg.conf?
2007-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	that will be my next step
2007-05-13T10:18:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	That should be your first step when it comes to res fixing
2007-05-13T10:18:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	well im flipping through "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-05-13T10:19:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Have you tried adding them? Theres no point in reconfigging it, you should just try adding them, I had to do it
2007-05-13T10:19:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	im not entirely sure where to add them just yet
2007-05-13T10:19:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Okay, in terminal type 'gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2007-05-13T10:20:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	let me finish what im doin and ill ping you when im done it wont take more than 4 mins or so
2007-05-13T10:21:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Honestly pal, why bother reconfigging, just add them so much easier
2007-05-13T10:22:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	ok im rdy
2007-05-13T10:22:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	i just had a few other settings i had changed aswell outside of just the monitor stuff that i wanted to finish with
2007-05-13T10:22:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	Okay, in terminal type: gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	rdy
2007-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	flapster	chamunks	If you scroll right to the bottom, you'll see a whole section with resolutions like "1204x768", simmply add your resolution at the start of them, usually on the 24 one
2007-05-13T10:26:00.000Z	chamunks	flapster	is there anything else i should also change before i go down for restart
