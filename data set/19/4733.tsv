2009-07-20T19:03:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		mazda01-  actually, in another interesting turn of fate, after logging in, i get avout a page of -bash: /dev/null: permission denied befre being greeted with a prompt
2009-07-20T19:03:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 did you use "ifconfig -a"?
2009-07-20T19:04:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		oskar--  no, ifconfig -a shows me eth0 and lo, but there's no ip for eth0
2009-07-20T19:05:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 did you use dhcp before?
2009-07-20T19:06:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	oskar-	yes, i have perviously and successfuly used dhcp, including during install
2009-07-20T19:09:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	oskar-	?
2009-07-20T19:10:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 can you log into gnome and configure the network interface to dhcp? or is it set this way?
2009-07-20T19:11:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 you also mentioned a problem with /dev/null. is it still there?
2009-07-20T19:11:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	oskar-	neither x nor gnome are installed, but i could set it to dhcp from the cli. though i thought it was automatically set to use dhcp. and yes, when i log in i get that message
2009-07-20T19:12:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 maybe these have to do with a problem in udev (?)
2009-07-20T19:12:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	oskar-	-bash: /dev/null: Permission denied
2009-07-20T19:12:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		oskar--  udev, i am not familiar with udev
2009-07-20T19:14:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	oskar-	okay, google is my friend, but i still don't have enough information to help me solve this problem
2009-07-20T19:15:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 sorry, i am also not familiar with udev... maybe https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/63031 give a solution for at least one of the problems
2009-07-20T19:15:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		oskar--  can a user access /dev/null by default? also, if udev is broken, why can i see my network hardware, and why isn't anything else broken?
2009-07-20T19:15:00.000Z	oskar-		yes
2009-07-20T19:15:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		oskar--  looking at that link
2009-07-20T19:17:00.000Z	oskar-	StrangeCharm_	 my idea is, that some startup scripts not run by root fail to connect their commands /dev/null and therefore for example "dhclient" fails
2009-07-20T19:18:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	oskar-	i see, i'll read this bug report in more detail to find out if i can get a solution
