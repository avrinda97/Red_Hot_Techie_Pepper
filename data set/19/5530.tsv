2009-07-31T01:23:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	i want to watch
2009-07-31T01:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	you want to watch a label ?
2009-07-31T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	you want to watch a sticky label on ubuntu ?
2009-07-31T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	do you mean print ? or do you really mean watch?
2009-07-31T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	you want to watch the DVD ?
2009-07-31T01:25:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	no. i want to watch the label, the text you name a disc...
2009-07-31T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	that makes no sense, you want to watch the lable
2009-07-31T01:27:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	what's non sense? when you write to a disc you can put a textual label on it, so the disc will have a name right?
2009-07-31T01:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	ahh you want to know what the lable is ?
2009-07-31T01:27:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	bingo
2009-07-31T01:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	when you put the disk in and it auto mounts you'll see the label name as the disk mount point
2009-07-31T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	hang on I can't remember the command, let me grab it
2009-07-31T01:31:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	maybe it's "volname"?
2009-07-31T01:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	don't think so
2009-07-31T01:32:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	it worked. it is volname
2009-07-31T01:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	well done
2009-07-31T01:33:00.000Z	Ddorda	ikonia	but volname doesn't support Hebrew.. do you know anything that support it?
2009-07-31T01:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Ddorda	wow, not sure about language support
