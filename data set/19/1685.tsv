2012-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	explosive would require me paying for it then :P
2012-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	if I return the drive, I'm off the hook
2012-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	oh, there's usually enough nice stuff in kitchens and cleaning rooms
2012-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	swap is normally = to the RAM size (for hibernation purposes)
2012-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	not all computer hibnerate, so? 256 GB diskspace wasted for swap?
2012-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	i'm glad i made my own rules 10 years ago for swap
2012-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	GB? MB...
2012-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	when i say GB, i mean GB
2012-04-25T00:15:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	I'm a little confused. Is this box running 256 GB of RAM?
2012-04-25T00:16:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	yes
2012-04-25T00:17:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	I suppose it depends what you're doing. I would never match swap on a server. Who hibernates a server? On the flip side, my home desktop I treat differently.
2012-04-25T00:17:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	it's not a server, it's just a workstation
2012-04-25T00:17:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	a work station with 256 GB of RAM?
2012-04-25T00:17:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	yes, 48 cores and some tb diskspace
2012-04-25T00:17:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	that's quite a work station.
2012-04-25T00:17:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	one among many
2012-04-25T00:18:00.000Z	roasted	tarzeau	match swap to whever you desire (as you seem you already do). Typically for home users, matching swap is the most logical way to go in case they do end up hibernating.
2012-04-25T00:18:00.000Z	tarzeau	roasted	i'm glad if it just works and i don't have to kick..err..touch it to work properly again
