2012-11-04T18:15:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	try running 'jockey-gtk' from the command line to see what the errors actually are?  (not sure I have a good grasp on the problem)
2012-11-04T18:16:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	i'll do it in a while

2012-11-04T18:29:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	ahah it's wonderful!! I hope it will be the same for me
2012-11-04T18:49:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	after updating/upgrading the system, jockey-gtk is working and (i hope) properly installing the nvidia drivers. Still I get one error on startup but I don't know what it is because the windows hat pops up doesn't show any info
2012-11-04T18:50:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	you might take a look at your logs to see if there's anything that jumps out at you
2012-11-04T18:51:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	I used to believe that there are many logs across my system... which one?
2012-11-04T18:51:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	I would start with /var/log/syslog
2012-11-04T18:54:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	unfortunately, now that i installed (via jockey) the nvidia-current and rebooted, my desktop won't load.......
2012-11-04T18:54:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	do Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to a terminal
2012-11-04T18:55:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	yes and what should I do to fix? apt-get remove nvidia-current??
2012-11-04T18:55:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	do 'lsmod | grep nouveau'
2012-11-04T18:56:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	empty
2012-11-04T18:59:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	maybe look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log for EE or WW messages that might provide more information?
2012-11-04T19:01:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	no errors in xorg. But in syslog many WARNINGS about too fast respawning of compiz.desktop
2012-11-04T19:02:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	ah - well there you go (don't know what to suggest about that, though)
2012-11-04T19:03:00.000Z	quatar	yeats	to go back to the previous situation, apt-remove nvidia-current could help?
2012-11-04T19:05:00.000Z	yeats	quatar	yes
