2012-05-08T16:10:00.000Z	rabbi1	solofight	no modification is required, important to take backup of your data......
2012-05-08T16:10:00.000Z	solofight	rabbi1	how to back up my data ? its not even booting in
2012-05-08T16:11:00.000Z	rabbi1	solofight	that's difficult. ..... should ask an expert then ....
2012-05-08T16:12:00.000Z	rabbi1	solofight	try to solve you current problem as much as possible, fresh installation will not harm you data (most of the time, as claimed) but you never know. i screwed up, but i was able to take a backup before that..... :D all the best ..
2012-05-08T16:15:00.000Z	rabbi1	solofight	you can even take help of a friend who has linux, make your harddisk accessible by his system and take a backup, in case your data exceeds the usb drive capacity ...
