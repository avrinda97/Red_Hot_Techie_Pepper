2011-05-04T18:15:00.000Z	newubuntu		hey anyone here running a wubi-installed copy of ubuntu???
2011-05-04T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2011-05-04T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	if you fix the time, when is it incorrect again?
2011-05-04T18:17:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	after rebooting of course
2011-05-04T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	replace the cmos battery?
2011-05-04T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	well replace the battery and rule it out
2011-05-04T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	does the issue present itself if you boot windows, shutdown, boot windows again?
2011-05-04T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	I'm trying to.  But can only do so if you answer questions
2011-05-04T18:28:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	sry ur last wues got lost in the group...and no there is no problem when i boot windows, shut down, and boot windows again
2011-05-04T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	make linux use local time: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Make%20Linux%20use%20%27Local%27%20time
2011-05-04T18:29:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	tx, checking ur link out...
2011-05-04T18:40:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	ur solution didnt quite work :(
2011-05-04T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	in what way?
2011-05-04T18:41:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	the link told me to set my clock to 'local time' if its on 'ust' time, but its ALREADY set to 'local time'
2011-05-04T18:41:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	well try the other option
2011-05-04T18:41:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	what other option?
2011-05-04T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	if it currently says "no", then change it to "yes"
2011-05-04T18:42:00.000Z	newubuntu	jrib	exactly what i tried to do, but ubuntu says i dont have permission to make changes in the file
2011-05-04T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	newubuntu	use "gksudo gedit /etc/default/rcS"
