2008-07-02T17:04:00.000Z	lobs_		ext3 is where the system files will stay?
2008-07-02T17:04:00.000Z	lobs_		is there a way to put my "home" folder in a ntfs partition?
2008-07-02T17:06:00.000Z	lobs_		how much gb the swap partition should have? should it come after or before ext3?
2008-07-02T17:07:00.000Z	lobs_		omg... there goes 4gb of my hd :P
2008-07-02T17:09:00.000Z	lobs_		Ok. Thanks.
2008-07-02T17:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	are you dual booting
2008-07-02T17:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	add one more partition for /home
2008-07-02T17:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	no
2008-07-02T17:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	at least as big as your ram or expected ram expansion
2008-07-02T17:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	at todays prices that amounts to about $1 worth of space
2008-07-02T17:09:00.000Z	lobs_	Jack_Sparrow	:P. Should swap come after or before ext3?
2008-07-02T17:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	I usually put them at the end as they are seldom used
2008-07-02T17:11:00.000Z	lobs_	Jack_Sparrow	i'm installing ubuntu aiming a dual boot
2008-07-02T17:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	there is a 4 primary partition limit... you will need to create an extended partition
2008-07-02T17:12:00.000Z	lobs_	Jack_Sparrow	I don't got it... Can you explain it again?
2008-07-02T17:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	there is a limit of 4 primary partitions on a drive.  so if you need more than that you need to use what is called an extended partition which will allow up to 256 logical partitions inside the extended partition
2008-07-02T17:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	great
2008-07-02T17:16:00.000Z	lobs_	Jack_Sparrow	I can use 4 partions plus extended partitions?
2008-07-02T17:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lobs_	no, one of the 4 primaries is the extended
