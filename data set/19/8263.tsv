2007-04-24T14:57:00.000Z	fbn		how can I export evolutions address book into a format that mac's address book can understand?
2007-04-24T14:58:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	can mac understand vcard?
2007-04-24T14:59:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	yes it does, but the vcard export from evolution seems to be strange because after the import all characters are chinese signs ...
2007-04-24T15:00:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	ubuntu uses UTF-8 by default, maybe Mac OS doesn't use that?
2007-04-24T15:01:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	if i open the export on ubuntu in vim I have a lot of ^M (at the end of every line) is that normal?
2007-04-24T15:01:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	i don't know, does the rest of the characters look OK?
2007-04-24T15:02:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	yes the rest is ok, but the field names are strange they have x-evolution in their names
2007-04-24T15:03:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	all of the fields have x-evolujtion in them?
2007-04-24T15:04:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	no, but the mobile phone for example
2007-04-24T15:04:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	i suspect a character encoding problem
2007-04-24T15:05:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	TEL;TYPE=CELL;X-EVOLUTION-UI-SLOT=1:017574370
2007-04-24T15:05:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	and I don't think that mac can read/understand this
2007-04-24T15:06:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	that should not be any problem, the x-evolution is just redundant data. you have to transfer the vcf file in ascii mode
2007-04-24T15:06:00.000Z	magnetron		!caps
2007-04-24T15:08:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	I send the vcf file per mail to the mac, how can I control if it's ascii mode?
2007-04-24T15:09:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	i don't know. maybe you could zip it first? or another compression and choose text mode explicitly
2007-04-24T15:10:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	i don't see an option to select text mode with gnome archiver ...
2007-04-24T15:10:00.000Z	fbn	magnetron	but i'll try zip
2007-04-24T15:12:00.000Z	magnetron	fbn	another option would be to convert the file in Mac OS X from UTF-8 to the native macosx format (iso latin-1?)
