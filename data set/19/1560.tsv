2010-12-25T04:59:00.000Z	tc1100		hello
2010-12-25T05:01:00.000Z	tc1100		say, could someone help me access my windows 7 shared files from my kubuntu laptop?
2010-12-25T05:01:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	did you install samba?
2010-12-25T05:02:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	and I probably messed up m y smb.conf by #ing out things
2010-12-25T05:03:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	You should be able to see them if the shares are on the same network...
2010-12-25T05:03:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	Just insert correct password and username...
2010-12-25T05:03:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	I see them but it asks for a user and password and I cant figure out what it wants
2010-12-25T05:04:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	I dont really have a password on my windows 7 shares
2010-12-25T05:04:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	Insert the user who owns them...no password...
2010-12-25T05:04:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	tried that
2010-12-25T05:05:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	did you try giving the user a password and try again?
2010-12-25T05:06:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	I've tried setting up a user and giving it permistions to the files and having a password but its not working
2010-12-25T05:07:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	On the W7 pc right?
2010-12-25T05:07:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	yes
2010-12-25T05:10:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	I don't know anything else you can try...sorry :)
2010-12-25T05:11:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	 at least I know I'm not crazy, I'm sure I'm missing something stupid thanks anyway
2010-12-25T05:11:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	You could try to reinstall sambe...might just work...
2010-12-25T05:11:00.000Z	tc1100	Ryu_Kurisu	good idea
2010-12-25T05:12:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	tc1100	did you see country0129 posts?
