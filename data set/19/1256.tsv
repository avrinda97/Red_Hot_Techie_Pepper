2011-03-23T12:47:00.000Z	critical_max		syria, often your Apache logs have the answer for that kind of problem. access.log and error.log both.
2011-03-23T12:48:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 Where are those files located?
2011-03-23T12:48:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	/var/log/apache2 on ubuntu
2011-03-23T12:48:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 Thnx, I will see whats going on there.
2011-03-23T12:48:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	"sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log" then reproduce the problem and watch the log in realtime :)
2011-03-23T12:54:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 Is this normal? http://paste.ubuntu.com/584185/
2011-03-23T12:55:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	nothing scary in there, you might have to dig in the access log to figure out what's going on
2011-03-23T12:56:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	I also see an "other_vhosts_access.log" which your webserver might be writing too, I'm not sure of your config
2011-03-23T12:57:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	check both of those if they exist, tail -f while reproducing the problem to make the correlation if possible
2011-03-23T12:58:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 is this one helpful http://paste.ubuntu.com/584186/ ? this the access.log
2011-03-23T12:59:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	I can't troubleshoot your php app for you, but I bet the info you need might be in that access log, since it's showing your pages loading. Good luck.
2011-03-23T12:59:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 Thank you. :)
2011-03-23T13:00:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 Just one more question please. removing phpmyadmin and re-installing it can solve the problem?
2011-03-23T13:01:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	try it and find out, I guess. One more tip: don't be root in the terminal. Use sudo for things that require root privileges in the terminal.
2011-03-23T14:34:00.000Z	Syria	critical_max	 i have removed phpmyadmin using this command apt-get purge-- remove phpmyadmin and after installing it again i couldn't login. :(
2011-03-23T14:35:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	the phpmyadmin docs are going to be your best resource
2011-03-23T14:35:00.000Z	critical_max	Syria	or someone else that is running it.
