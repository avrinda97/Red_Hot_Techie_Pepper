2011-01-12T07:40:00.000Z	zaery		Does anyone know if there's a d-link irc channel? wifi drops every time a computer on the network shuts down.
2011-01-12T07:42:00.000Z	zaery		LOL, you both asked eachother the same question at the same time XD
2011-01-12T07:43:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	No.
2011-01-11T03:36:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	you sure you got the right password? (disclaimer, i have no knowledge of how home folders are encrypted in ubuntu)
2011-01-11T03:36:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	Yes.
2011-01-12T07:43:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	does banshee recognize that it's an iPod, even if ubuntu doesn't?
2011-01-12T07:44:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	what ipod/generation do you have?
2011-01-12T07:44:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	That shouldn't matter as it just worked. Nano 4G.
2011-01-12T07:47:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	ubuntu recognizes it as a mass storage device, then?
2011-01-12T07:47:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	No.
2011-01-12T07:47:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	I had to manually mount it.
2011-01-12T07:48:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	after you mount it, can you see your music?
2011-01-12T07:49:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	No.
2011-01-12T07:49:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	The only reason I have to believe that it works at all is that I can ls /media/henry (my iPod's mountpoint) and see iPod_Control and stuff.
2011-01-12T07:50:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	do you have another computer, possibly with another OS to try it on?
2011-01-12T07:50:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	Yes. It works on Ubuntu.
2011-01-12T07:54:00.000Z	zaery	m1ndvirus	did you install/uninstall/update anything between when you could access your ipod and now?
2011-01-12T07:54:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	No idea.
2011-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	zaery	"Resetting" my iPod fixed it, it seems.
