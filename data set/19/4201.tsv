2009-03-03T11:27:00.000Z	Antioch		gnu c compiler
2009-03-03T11:27:00.000Z	Antioch		sudo aptitude install build-essential
2009-03-03T11:28:00.000Z	Antioch		should give you everything you need to compiler basic things
2009-03-03T11:28:00.000Z	Antioch		compile*
2009-03-03T11:29:00.000Z	Antioch		lol why?
2009-03-03T11:29:00.000Z	Antioch		I compile things on Ubuntu all the time. C, C++, C#, Java (if you consider the last two "compiled")
2009-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	Antioch		you could compile & build your own package before installing it
2009-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	Antioch		then you'd be able to remove it and upgrade it safely
2009-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	Antioch		;)
2009-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	paulSterio	Antioch	 ok took your advice to build-essential. I'm still getting this gcc issue when I try and easy_install reportlab
2009-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	paulSterio		http://dpaste.com/5050/
2009-03-03T11:32:00.000Z	paulSterio		why is it doing this on ubuntu 8.10?
2009-03-03T11:32:00.000Z	Antioch		Not loading, but I'll bet there's some package xyz-dev youre missing
2009-03-03T11:32:00.000Z	Antioch		or some lib-dev
2009-03-03T11:33:00.000Z	Antioch		There ya go!
2009-03-03T11:33:00.000Z	Antioch		Too bad dpaste isnt loading for me or I woulda beat you to it!
2009-03-03T11:33:00.000Z	paulSterio		are you serious
2009-03-03T11:34:00.000Z	paulSterio		yea I've already started the process
2009-03-03T11:34:00.000Z	Antioch	paulSterio	That's the first thing to check when building something new. Make sure you've got the right libraries and dev pacakges :)
