2005-11-01T10:39:00.000Z	william_		do you think it could break anything
2005-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	william_	nalioth	do you think it could break anything?
2005-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	nalioth	william_	the only think i recommend is that you use "checkinstall" isntead of "make install"
2005-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	nalioth	william_	and i dont send folks URLs that are harmful
2005-11-01T10:42:00.000Z	william_		haha okay, just checking thank you nalioth
2005-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	nalioth	william_	if you are not familiar with checkinstall, you should be, it makes your self compiled programs easier to track
