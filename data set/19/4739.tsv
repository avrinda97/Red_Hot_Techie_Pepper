2008-12-01T16:28:00.000Z	aeosynth		I just found out that my processor is 64 bit, do I need to make another Live CD or is there an easier way to install from within the 32 bit version I'm using right now?
2008-12-01T16:28:00.000Z	aeosynth		to install the 64 bit version of Ubuntu*
2008-12-01T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	if you use < 2Gb ram and its a desktop system i'd suggest 32bit
2008-12-01T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	if its for desktop stuffs then not really
2008-12-01T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	if its for server things then 64 bit can be advantageous
2009-01-13T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	make a small bash script to run sudo shutdown -h now
2009-01-13T17:06:00.000Z	aeosynth	ActionParsnip	how would I do that?
2009-01-13T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	or alias it in ~/.bashrc
2009-01-13T17:06:00.000Z	aeosynth	ActionParsnip	I'm new to linux, never made a bash script before
2009-01-13T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	simple text file. 1st line: #!/bin/sh    2nd line: sudo shutdown -h now
2009-01-13T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	save and exit, chmod +x the file and its ready to go, actually, use gksudo instead
2009-01-13T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	you will be shown a password box to type your password in and the system will turn off
2009-01-13T17:15:00.000Z	aeosynth	ActionParsnip	is chmod +x the same as setting 'allow executing file as program' in nautilus? using that and sudo, i only see the password prompt if i run it in a terminal. is there a way to shutdown without having to enter a password? how does the panel applet do it?
2009-01-13T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	its not just nautilus, its everywhere, it marks it as executable
2009-01-13T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	you can add the shutdown command to the list off apps the dont require sudo but im not sure ow to do that personally, have a websearch around
2009-01-13T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	i think ikonia may have a clue or 2
2009-01-13T17:16:00.000Z	aeosynth	ActionParsnip	i meant, I set that property through the nautilus gui, is that the same as doing chmod +x?
2009-01-13T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	as long as the owner can execute it its fine
2009-01-19T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeosynth	sudo apt-get --reinstall install gdm
