2007-10-31T08:14:00.000Z	Jimdb		those of you that use awn, are you successful in getting the notification applet to work?  i see only a white vertical line where the notification applet should be.
2007-10-31T08:15:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	you have to make sure your real system tray is closed too.
2007-10-31T08:15:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	if it's open in your panel, it can't be open in AWN, so close that one, then restart your AWN.
2007-10-31T08:16:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	 ok, going to give it a try
2007-10-31T08:18:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	any luck?
2007-10-31T08:19:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	 that worked except it has this overly large white background
2007-10-31T08:19:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	I have it too, haven't found a workaround yet for that though... if only I could alpha blend the icons themselves...
2007-10-31T08:20:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	it gets less noticeable as time goes on trust me.
2007-10-31T08:20:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	have you found out how to get rid of that "no name" icon that seems to be there every time awn starts?
2007-10-31T08:21:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	I don't have that.. check your applets maybe..
2007-10-31T08:21:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	been over it a hundred times, including editing the xml code.
2007-10-31T08:22:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	All of my applets are named and work perfectly (main menu, desktop, weather, launchers, windows,trash,quit, system tray)
2007-10-31T08:23:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	yeah, they all work for me to, now that the notification area is set up.  but I have this no name icon that appears every time i start awn.  i can just choose to close it, which i do.  i just want to get rid of it for good.
2007-10-31T08:24:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	that's odd. I've not heard of that before. Which repo did you download from?
2007-10-31T08:25:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	 I don't recall but i compared mine to someone elses on here last night and we had the same version.  they appear to be the latest.
2007-10-31T08:26:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	 is there a way to get rid of the last gnome panel since this awn?  since awn does it all for me.
2007-10-31T08:26:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	I removed everything from my panel except the main menu, and hid it underneath of my AWN (transparent) so that way I can't see it, but if AWN crashes, it's there.
2007-10-31T08:28:00.000Z	Jimdb	wheredidrealityg	 make sense. did that just now.
2007-10-31T08:28:00.000Z	wheredidrealityg	Jimdb	:)
