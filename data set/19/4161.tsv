2010-03-13T21:55:00.000Z	hmw		An unknown program suddenly and quite quickly has filled my hard drive. "100% used" - what can I do to find out, what happened?
2010-03-13T21:56:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	baobab can tell you whats using a lot of disk space
2010-03-14T00:11:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	pretty sure nautilus uses key bindings and these arent hard coded in the source
2010-03-14T00:16:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	I didn't see it in the preferences of Nautilus. The terminal at least lets me view the settings. Should I be expecting  to find some tool in the Administration menu of the top panel, for changing these? Timo_: Try CTRL+PageUp/PageDown
2010-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	you have to tinker with the bootscritps a bit to change the text and colors these output
2010-04-01T19:28:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	manipulating init-functions sounds like a decent place to do it
2010-04-01T19:29:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	i want to have the "if log_use_fancy_output; then" to trigger... i cant find that function
2010-04-01T19:30:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	im sure its possible, but cant be specific on where you should look
2010-04-01T19:31:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	well does the boot sequence echo ok to begin with?
2010-04-01T19:32:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	the init scripts return 0 on success. if they return anything else, it ends up in [fail] or something. i don't know, where the calling script is.
2010-04-01T19:33:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	i have jaunty
2010-04-01T19:34:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	i can't remember
2010-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	sender: one cannot unmount /home, if they sudoed themselves to root. Therefore my root account has a password.
2010-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	heh yeah that poses a problem
2010-05-09T03:55:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	really? thought that appliead to GPUs only
2010-05-09T03:55:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	let me rephase, No recent cpu will reach 130
2010-05-09T03:59:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	130W power dissipation you mean? if you read out the sensors it will probably say tjunction max is 110 or 100?
2010-05-26T01:40:00.000Z	acicula	hmw	that may actually not work very well because those are started with the same privs as the user that is loging in
2010-05-26T01:41:00.000Z	hmw	acicula	that was my idea :)
