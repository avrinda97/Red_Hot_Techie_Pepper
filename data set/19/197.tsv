2012-07-03T12:43:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	Detailed description oftheproblem http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2010190
2012-07-03T12:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	 last issue i had with a nic was 6+ years ago.
2012-07-06T12:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	 with a router.. the modem/isp will never see you reboot.. the router will get the ip and info and be always on.
2012-07-06T12:47:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	That sounds cool. Only when I restart the router will teh address gets changed right?
2012-07-06T12:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	 yep.  and my rrouter rarely restarts.. :)
2012-07-06T12:47:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	and compdoc: Does that also mean that I can have more than one computer connected ot the router
2012-07-06T12:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	  i got like 10 devices going to my router
2012-07-06T12:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	 the routers docs....
2012-07-06T12:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	 i just plug all mine in... and power up..
2012-07-06T12:49:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	Thanks. LOL. that would be cool :) I have an old DSL modlem cum router. idont think i can use that for this
2012-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	compdoc: thanks for your time :)
2012-07-08T19:02:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	I have a dynamic IP from the ISP and I dont have a router
2012-07-08T19:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	gRAVIty_	 unless they change your ip# again? ;P
2012-07-08T19:27:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	haha. The router thing is promised by the ISP.  I am asking can I have a static IP when I put a router
2012-07-08T19:28:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	But that does not effect the IP on my laptop. or does it?
2012-07-08T19:31:00.000Z	gRAVIty_	dr_willis	hmm. thats confusing. I was thinking the IP gets assigned to the router and the IP on my laptop will be assigned by the router. Is that correct?
