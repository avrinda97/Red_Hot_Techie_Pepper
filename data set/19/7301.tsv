2008-06-05T00:24:00.000Z	Slice`		I've got a quick question
2008-06-05T00:24:00.000Z	Slice`		To be totally honest with you guys - I didn't mean to install Ubuntu at first.
2008-06-05T00:24:00.000Z	Slice`		Infact, I've had next to no Linux experience in my life.
2008-06-05T00:24:00.000Z	Slice`		I actually installed Ubuntu because I couldn't install XP since I have a SATA HDD
2008-06-05T00:25:00.000Z	Slice`		so, my question is this -
2008-06-05T00:25:00.000Z	Slice`		I installed WINE
2008-06-05T00:25:00.000Z	Slice`		and I installed Steam successfully
2008-06-05T00:25:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	you can install XP to SATA
2008-06-05T00:26:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	does your network work?
2008-06-05T00:26:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	internet access
2008-06-05T00:26:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	you could use another computer side by side
2008-06-05T00:26:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	how should i know
2008-06-05T00:27:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	You could use another computer for that
2008-06-05T00:27:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	two comps side by side perhaps a laptop even
2008-06-05T00:27:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	like i said, i have no way to know
2008-06-05T00:27:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	just ruling out options dude
2008-06-05T00:28:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	i dont know it could be wine issue
2008-06-05T00:28:00.000Z	manoff	Slice`	Wine does not work very well on all apss
