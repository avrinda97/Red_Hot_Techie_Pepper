2012-07-02T03:55:00.000Z	jetole		Hey guys. I just installed ubuntu 12.04 yesterday and I am getting some apt errors when I try to install libgtk-3-dev from apt-get, aptitude or symantec. The errors are referring to unmet dependencies and the error is E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. Posting full output @ http://pastebin.com/XEwZUK74. Does anyone know how I can fix this?
2012-07-02T03:56:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	sudo apt-get install -f
2012-07-02T03:57:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	thanks. Let me see how that works out
2012-07-02T03:57:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	synaptic ;)
2012-07-02T03:58:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	same output. I have also run "apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get upgrade" and I have also run "dpkg --configure -a" based on some forum posts. I notice the first line of the Depends: is saying the version I have installed is newer then the version required too which I find odd
2012-07-02T03:59:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	where's your error again?  (sorry too lazy too look through the scrollback)

2012-07-02T04:00:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	you should use paste.ubuntu.com too many ads on pastebin.
2012-07-02T04:00:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	if I use aptitude, the first suggestion is it wants to keep packages as is and not install the program I asked for. The next suggestion is downgrading packages which just seems wrong
2012-07-02T04:01:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	oh I use adblocker so I didn't even know they were there

2012-07-02T04:03:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	did you yo do an `apt-get install -f libgtk-3-dev` or `apt-get install -f`
2012-07-02T04:03:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	oh I did `apt-get install -f libgtk-3-dev`. should I do it without the package name?
2012-07-02T04:05:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	listen to bz.
2012-07-02T04:06:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	will do. btw, thanks for the help so far
2012-07-02T04:06:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	he's right, -f is to 'fix broken packages', I misread your error.
2012-07-02T04:07:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	it's ok. I still appreciate the help
2012-07-02T04:08:00.000Z	three18ti	jetole	no problem, didn't really do much ;)
2012-07-02T04:08:00.000Z	jetole	three18ti	you paid attention and offered support. That counts ;-)
