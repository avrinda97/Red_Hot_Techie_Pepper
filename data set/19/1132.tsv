2011-05-02T11:32:00.000Z	tbf		how again do i re-arrange launchers in the sidebar?
2011-05-02T11:32:00.000Z	tbf		...thought i've done it once, but cannot remember how
2011-05-02T11:33:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	- do you have Ubuntu Tweak installed
2011-05-02T11:34:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	wtf... ubuntu also comes with such mess now?
2011-05-02T11:34:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	- if you have Ubuntu Tweak then make sure you have show desktop icons checked
2011-05-02T11:36:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	you can re-arrange all launchers by dragging them off and then replacing them where you want
2011-05-02T11:37:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	"dragging off".... hmm.... let's see
2011-05-02T11:37:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	that was the trick! thanks alot!
2011-05-02T11:39:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	- try right-click to remove launcher, then open the application and pin the launcher again ?
2011-05-02T11:40:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	don't have a desktop file for this app... but let's try
2011-05-02T11:41:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	no, that's the wrong instance
2011-05-02T11:42:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	(not surprisingly) took the app it found in path (or however) - not the shell script
2011-05-02T11:43:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	- try this thread - half way down - http://bit.ly/msZLwR
2011-05-02T11:50:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	feared i'd have to manually create a .desktop file. well. ok.
2011-05-02T11:52:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	- if you right click desktop and use 'Create Launcher' it's simpler - then you just need to move the launcher created into .local/share/ applications, and then drag it out of that location into the dock - it works
2011-05-02T11:52:00.000Z	kezzawd	tbf	for dock read launcher lol (OSX !!!)
2011-05-02T11:53:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	thank you
2011-05-02T11:59:00.000Z	tbf	kezzawd	thanks for all your help. i am happy for the moment :-)
