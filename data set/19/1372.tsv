2011-02-12T21:29:00.000Z	t4tm0h		can anyone help my resolution issue?  I'm using backbox linux,  it's an ubuntu based distro.   I cannot seem to create a higher resolution than 1024x800 and i know my card/monitor supports it.
2011-02-12T21:29:00.000Z	t4tm0h		backbox creates no xorg.conf file either
2011-02-12T21:30:00.000Z	t4tm0h		XFCE ?
2011-02-12T21:30:00.000Z	t4tm0h		i think thats what it uses
2011-02-12T21:30:00.000Z	t4tm0h		i went to their channel and they said i should be here
2011-02-12T21:31:00.000Z	t4tm0h		lspci | grep VGA
