2009-05-17T10:57:00.000Z	Gnea		if you can mount it read-only, I'd start backing important data up off of it ASAP
2009-05-17T10:57:00.000Z	Gnea		well, most people don't, so good to know that you do
2009-05-17T10:59:00.000Z	Gnea		always been an upgrade from previous 8.10 or earlier

2009-05-17T11:01:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	Think you can help me with my issue? I have the same error as HDFAIL.
2009-05-17T11:02:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	is it a laptop hd as well or..?
2009-05-17T11:02:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	It's a laptop with Ubuntu on a USB External HD.
2009-05-17T11:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	oi... yeah, running any OS off of an external USB harddrive carries a certain risk with it... if it was a flashdrive, that'd be a different story (no time differential to moving parts, etc)
2009-05-17T11:04:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	it worked fine for Ubuntu 8, just fails for 9.
2009-05-17T11:04:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	have you tried jumping back to 8.10?
2009-05-17T11:06:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	I'm just wondering if this is fixable, I'd rather use 9.04.
2009-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	I.. don't really know.  are all of the ports usb 2.0 and the cable is 2.0 capable?
2009-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	If it worked on UB8, wouldn't it work in UB9?
2009-05-17T11:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	UB9 has had a lot of issues - the nice thing is, it works for the most part. did you instlal UB9 from the get-go or upgrade it from a UB8 installation?
2009-05-17T11:10:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	Both ways.
2009-05-17T11:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	that's just baffling....
2009-05-17T11:12:00.000Z	Jar	Gnea	Do you think if I download Ubuntu 9 and install that would turn out different than my current method of installing? (using a ShipIt free live CD)
2009-05-17T11:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Jar	it might... it might not
