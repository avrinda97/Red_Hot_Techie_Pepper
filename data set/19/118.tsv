2012-09-03T10:35:00.000Z	fragmachine		yes I think so, how do I check?
2012-09-03T10:36:00.000Z	wolfric	fragmachine	 try applications menu and under the "other" heading
2012-09-03T10:36:00.000Z	fragmachine		I don't have an applications menu
2012-09-03T10:36:00.000Z	wolfric	fragmachine	did you previously have a systems menu..?
2012-09-03T10:37:00.000Z	fragmachine	wolfric	no I just installed ubuntu, I remember it being there on 11
2012-09-03T10:38:00.000Z	wolfric	fragmachine	not here any more, try click the top right part of the screen
2012-09-03T10:38:00.000Z	wolfric		the power button
2012-09-03T10:38:00.000Z	wolfric		should be a settings bit there
2012-09-03T10:38:00.000Z	wolfric		going by memory, don't use unity so i may be a little off
2012-09-03T10:38:00.000Z	fragmachine		yea there is a icon there that lets me go to system settings
2012-09-03T10:38:00.000Z	wolfric		the "applications places system" menu was a different desktop enviroment called gnome. The default has now switched to unity
