2006-06-14T06:54:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	I feel your pain :(  This Xdmcp problem is driving me bonkers.
2006-06-14T06:55:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	ah video card driver problems are always bad.
2006-06-14T06:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	yeah when the damn card lies to you :(
2006-06-14T06:56:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	I'm just pissed that no one else seems to have my problems.
2006-06-14T06:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	whats the issue?
2006-06-14T06:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	depends on the package (how it was installed)
2006-06-14T06:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	sudo apt-get remove --purge packagename
2006-06-14T06:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	or sudo dpkg -r packagename
2006-06-14T06:57:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	I'm looking at completely removing any of the X11 related packages, trying to get it to a clean condition.
2006-06-14T06:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	removing xserver-xorg should remove all other X packages with it
2006-06-14T07:00:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	so everything that depends on xserver-xorg will get cleaned out too, right?
2006-06-14T07:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	should i might use aptitude remove purge to be sure   im not sure how aptitude handles a purge parameter though you might want tto refer to man aptitude to find out
2006-06-14T07:01:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	how is aptitude different then apt-get?  I thought they were the same :)
2006-06-14T07:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	aptitude handles depends better than apt-get
2006-06-14T07:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	apt-get will suggest packages for you aptitude will install them automaticly
2006-06-14T13:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	lsb_release -a
2006-06-14T13:34:00.000Z	Gambit--	gnomefreak	NoUse, nope, not found.  It's a 2.4.27 kernel, and it has apt-get style programs, but no lsb_release
2006-06-14T13:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Gambit--	sounds like debian
