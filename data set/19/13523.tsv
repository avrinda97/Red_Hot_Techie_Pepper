2005-05-07T11:34:00.000Z	holycow		i would say totem-gstreamer is the right way and the future, totem-xine simply outperforms gstreamer today.  the gstreamer codecs don't seem to be able to decode efficiently (weren't the w32 codecs dervied from the original dlls or some such?)
2005-05-07T11:34:00.000Z	holycow		to stretch an analogy
2005-05-07T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		this whole discussion is moot
2005-05-07T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		your suggestin some strange and bizarre solutions to something that simply isn't free and never will be
2005-05-07T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		those codec haveto basically be purchase
2005-05-07T11:36:00.000Z	holycow		i don't see a problem with ubuntu offering a LEGAL player that has paid up whatever rights for the codecs and allow users to pay for them ...
2005-05-07T11:36:00.000Z	holycow		that gives those supporting ubuntu a real answ3er, for those that don't want to buy a legal player, they will find how to download this stuff anyway
2005-05-07T11:37:00.000Z	holycow		you cannot skirt copyright laws if you wish others to respect yours is sort of the idea
2005-05-07T11:37:00.000Z	drspi1	holycow	the problem with that is it eliminates freedom of choice -- which linux provides by it's very nature -- why ruin that?
2005-05-07T11:44:00.000Z	holycow	drspi1	actually no, check your windowsxp licence
2005-05-07T11:44:00.000Z	holycow	drspi1	unfortunately your windows xp licence tells you how you can or cannot use them
2005-05-07T11:44:00.000Z	holycow	drspi1	you may have some extra 'fair use' rights and such under your countries copyright laws tho
2005-05-07T11:45:00.000Z	drspi1	holycow	right -- I don't give a damn... I live in a 'free' coutry - I paid for them and I WILL use them how and when I please... period
2005-05-07T11:45:00.000Z	drspi1	holycow	;)
2005-05-07T11:48:00.000Z	drspi1	holycow	I agree
2005-05-07T11:49:00.000Z	drspi1	holycow	I'm sure m$ has that covered
2005-05-07T11:49:00.000Z	holycow	drspi1	maybe ;)
2005-05-07T11:55:00.000Z	holycow	drspi1	exponential growth of information is a little overstated imho
2005-05-07T11:55:00.000Z	drspi1	holycow	if you want servers run BSD -- exponential growth in information sharing
