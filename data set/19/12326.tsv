2007-05-17T09:15:00.000Z	tin		linux-headers is just the headers, you'll need it to build modules and other things that need to talk to the kernel
2007-05-17T09:15:00.000Z	tin		linux-sources is the actually sources for the kernel. you'll need it and -headers to build a new kernel
2007-05-17T09:16:00.000Z	tin		or just reboot ;-)
2007-05-17T09:18:00.000Z	tin		how'd you get to the command line?
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	tin		if you log out, GDM you give you an option to restart the X server
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	tin		if not, logout, then hit ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	tin		that'll kill X, and GDM will restart it for you
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	tin		then you just log in again
2007-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	thanks for the answer... I'm curous tho. Why didn't they include -headers in -sources?
2007-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	tin	rukuartic	because you don't need -sources just to build 3rd party kernel modules
2007-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	So you've got the .o files, and the .h just provides the implementation?
2007-05-17T09:21:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	.h is headers, .c is sources?
2007-05-17T09:21:00.000Z	tin	rukuartic	yes, but headers provide interface, and sources provide implementation
2007-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	My mistake... ...So the (package)-dev things (for example... ...uh, firefox-dev if it exists) contains the headers _and_ the source?
2007-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	tin	rukuartic	i think the -dev packages just contain headers
2007-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	Well then how would I go about compiling a software package like firefox from source?
2007-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	What package would I go for if I was to build it from source then?
2007-05-17T09:24:00.000Z	tin	rukuartic	i think first yu have to tell synaptic or adept to include the sources repository
2007-05-17T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	tin	Gotcha.
