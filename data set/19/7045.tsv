2007-10-19T22:05:00.000Z	x938		stray 77: are you on firefox ubuntu?
2007-10-19T22:06:00.000Z	x938		oh ok
2007-10-19T22:07:00.000Z	x938		from 7.04 image
2007-10-19T22:07:00.000Z	x938		or make a seperate partition
2007-10-19T22:07:00.000Z	x938		and have a dual boot linux system 7.10/7.04
2007-10-19T22:09:00.000Z	x938		lavender dream: go to EDIT>CONTENT>CONFIGURE FILE TYPES>MANAGE from here you can setup how firefox handles certain files and what it does automatically
2007-10-19T22:10:00.000Z	x938		lavender dreams: you might also want to setup your default download options to save to a specific place auomatically without asking, then you can have autoplay and autodownload without asking
2007-10-19T22:11:00.000Z	x938		lavender dreams: if your on a windows system it might be in c:\program files\vlc player\vlc.exe
2007-10-19T22:12:00.000Z	x938		lavender dream: on desktop right click> select "create launcher" type in command "vlc player" (or whatever its called) and save this then point firefox to this launcher
2007-10-19T22:12:00.000Z	x938		lavender dream: this is a work around since im not sure where your VLC player installed
2007-10-19T22:13:00.000Z	Pici	x938	`which vlc`
2007-10-19T22:13:00.000Z	x938	Pici	?? which vlc?
2007-10-19T22:13:00.000Z	Pici	x938	`which vlc` will tell you where the vlx executable is
2007-10-19T22:14:00.000Z	x938	Pici	vlc player, it depends on how the user has it installed. if hte program name is "bitchx" then you make a launcher with command "bitchx" and point firefox to handle .irc files with bitchx launcher
2007-10-19T22:14:00.000Z	Pici	x938	right, but this is a solution to your workaround
2007-10-19T22:14:00.000Z	x938	Pici	can you please repeat the solution i missed i
2007-10-19T22:15:00.000Z	Pici	x938	the command 'which appname'  will tell you where the exectuable for that app lives.
2007-10-19T22:15:00.000Z	x938		ah
2007-10-19T22:15:00.000Z	x938	Pici	ah thank you :)
