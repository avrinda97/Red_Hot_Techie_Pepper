2008-08-20T12:47:00.000Z	hano		i burned an 8.04 iso image on a cd, but there's no autoload when rebooting the computer
2008-08-20T12:47:00.000Z	hano		how can I start the installation?
2008-08-20T12:47:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	You probably need to adjust your BIOS boot list
2008-08-20T12:48:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	The CD is not supposed to be used in windows
2008-08-20T12:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	You put the CD in and reboot the PC, it will start from the CD
2008-08-20T12:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	But you may need to adjust the boot priority order
2008-08-20T12:49:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	i'm currently using 6.10
2008-08-20T12:49:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	Oh, there is no direct upgrade path from 6.10 to 8.04
2008-08-20T12:50:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	You either re-install, or you have to incremental upgrade it to 7.04, then 7.10, then 8.04
2008-08-20T12:50:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	yes, that's why i saved all my files and tried to install 8.04
2008-08-20T12:50:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	i did as you said, put in the CD and rebooted - but it's not starting from the cd
2008-08-20T12:50:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	Like I said, you will need to go into the BIOS and make sure the CD is the first boot prioirity
2008-08-20T12:51:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	Have you tried the CD on another computer?
2008-08-20T12:51:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	no - maybe I have to set some "boot flags" when burning it to make clear that's supposed to be a boot-cd?
2008-08-20T12:51:00.000Z	SuperQ	hano	not if you did a direct ISO burn
2008-08-20T12:52:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	yes, I did. hm ok.. now, when booting the pc, GRUB starts
2008-08-20T12:53:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	maybe I'll have a look in the bios, though i'm not familiar with it..
2008-08-20T12:54:00.000Z	hano	SuperQ	I'll try. thank you
