2009-09-21T22:45:00.000Z	ltcabral		hey... can anyone help me with this problem? my ubuntu was working until i restart it... it displayed some message about resolution and moved screen a bit to the right. Now it doesnt even display log in screen, just some weird colored lines and freezes... this is my Xorg.0.log? http://pastie.org/624815
2009-09-21T22:45:00.000Z	Alexia	ltcabral	did you recently try to install or compile a new video driver?
2009-09-21T22:45:00.000Z	ltcabral	Alexia	dont think so...
2009-09-21T22:46:00.000Z	Alexia	ltcabral	did the update manager update anything before the restart
2009-09-21T22:46:00.000Z	ltcabral	Alexia	no it didnt
2009-09-21T22:46:00.000Z	ltcabral	Alexia	i think i changed something related to metacity - emerald... but not sure if it was the reason
2009-09-21T22:46:00.000Z	Alexia	ltcabral	thats probably what it was
2009-09-21T22:47:00.000Z	Alexia	ltcabral	did you try to enable compiz?
2009-09-21T22:47:00.000Z	ltcabral	Alexia	hm... maybe
2009-09-21T22:47:00.000Z	ltcabral	Alexia	actually it was enabled arleady... i remember the wolby windows
2009-09-21T22:47:00.000Z	Alexia	ltcabral	the log you posted shows that direct rendering failed
2009-09-21T22:48:00.000Z	Alexia	ltcabral	so that would definitely cause some problmes
