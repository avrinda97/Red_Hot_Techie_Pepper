2009-03-28T02:07:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		it still doesn't let me move folders onto it
2009-03-28T02:07:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		even after the chmod 777
2009-03-28T02:07:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		no
2009-03-28T02:07:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		?
2009-03-28T02:08:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		ok
2009-03-28T02:08:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		how do i change that
2009-03-28T02:09:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		arrgh, yes i did ls -al
2009-03-28T02:09:00.000Z	sadaiyappan		now what do i do
2009-03-28T02:09:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	does it say root ?
2009-03-28T02:04:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	I'ts probably in /mnt OR /media somewhere...
2009-03-28T02:07:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	Have you checked if it actually did anything?
2009-03-28T02:08:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	It might be that you don't have permission to change the permissions.
2009-03-28T02:08:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	ls -al      should give you some insight in the current permissions.
2009-03-28T02:09:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	look at the output.
2009-03-28T02:10:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	Then you are probably in a folder that is owned by root.
2009-03-28T02:10:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	It's probably not so wise to just put stuff in there.
2009-03-28T02:12:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	ah , you mounted an external hard-drive?
2009-03-28T02:13:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	Life can be that easy. :P
2009-03-28T02:13:00.000Z	imme-emosol	sadaiyappan	depends , but in general: not really.
