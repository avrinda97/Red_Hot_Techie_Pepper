2009-05-23T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		tab works for man bash completion here it seems.. well some what. :)
2009-05-23T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		man l
2009-05-23T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Display all 134 possibilities? (y or n)
2009-05-23T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		i did a tab after the l like --> l<tab>
2009-05-23T08:29:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	is that after typing "man" ?
2009-05-23T08:11:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	:)
2009-05-23T08:15:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	one doubt: if there is a directory in PATH, are the subdirectories also part of the PATH env ?
2009-05-23T08:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rangzy	 nope.. not that i have ever noticed..
2009-05-23T08:17:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	okay. so, for the script you mentioned, is it enough if we just do an ls on each of the dir in the PATH env ?
2009-05-23T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rangzy	 theres other ways to glob the files in a dir.
2009-05-23T08:20:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	oh is it ? do you mean similar to this: http://perl.about.com/od/filesystem/qt/perlglob.htm ?
2009-05-23T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rangzy	 just 'echo /bin/*' will get a list also. :) of that dir
2009-05-23T08:25:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	stbtra wants to do a grep. wouldnt it be better to do a ls -l ? (one file per line)
2009-05-23T08:31:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	wow. whats the version there ?
2009-05-23T08:32:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	I understand.. so, if I do man SPACE iwc SPACE <tab>, does it suggest iwconfig ?
2009-05-23T08:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rangzy	 no space after the iwc... logical eh>
2009-05-23T08:34:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	yes I understand the space issue! and, nice to know this thing works. I wanted this feature back in 2004. and then almost forgot about it. it didnt work for me in 8.10 yest.
2009-05-23T08:35:00.000Z	rangzy	Dr_Willis	good night.
