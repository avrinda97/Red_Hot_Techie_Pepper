2006-12-08T08:42:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	don't repeat
2006-12-08T08:42:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	if someone knew, they would tell you
2006-12-08T08:44:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	if you're very lucky, you can fix this with a rescue function from a Windows boot disk. This isn't the best forum to ask about that, though
2006-12-08T08:48:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	lemonsCC's instructions won't work for you
2006-12-08T08:49:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	because you didn't overwrite your MBR, you overwrote your hda1 boot sector.
2006-12-08T08:50:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	what I told you before. Recover with a Windows boot CD
2006-12-08T08:51:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	is this an NTFS partition?
2006-12-08T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	you could try the utility testdisk
2006-12-08T08:53:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	I have never used this, though, and won't be able to help
2006-12-08T08:54:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	then your partition is borked and you'll have to reinstall Windows.
2006-12-08T08:55:00.000Z	soundray	Omarpb	I can't see a way. You could still ask for help in ##windows
