2012-10-14T08:50:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		there will be an update to pae to enable up to 128gb of ram because there is so little difference between 32 bit and what people refer to as 64 bit (which in reality is only 38 bit dwords running in a 48bit enviornment) 32 bit runs 32 bit dwords in a 48 bit enviornment so all you actually see is a 10-20% speed increase in best case scenarios
2012-10-14T08:50:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		in fact real 64 bit hasnt been used since 2001
2012-10-14T08:51:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		in most cases you will see performance actually decrease in 64 bit mode
2012-10-14T08:51:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		since the dwords being written to the ram have to be twice the size
2012-10-14T08:52:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		which is coming to 32
2012-10-14T08:52:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		wrong again
2012-10-14T08:52:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		because 32 bit applications can run in 4gbs of ram
2012-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		once you get beyond real bit addresses you can run in 6-8gb even if you dont specify def(0)~(9)
2012-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		right
2012-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior		32 bit mode for usage of older hardware
2012-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	and what do you mean by "upgrade", I have been running PAE for 3-4 years already.
2012-10-14T08:54:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior	SwedeMike	in the kernel it will be enabled to see 128 and 256gb of ram
2012-10-14T08:55:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	it already supports 64 gig so I don't think most people have a problem with that anyway. And if you have that kind of machine you should run 64bit because then it's probably because you have applications that need to address a lot of memory.
2012-10-14T08:56:00.000Z	poedragonwarrior	SwedeMike	again not true I use a lot of virtual machines that use 3gb of ram each say I want to run 4 and still have the OS available to me
2012-10-14T08:57:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	let me get this straight. you're advocating people to not run 64bit at all?
2012-10-14T08:59:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	well, let me just on the record say that I don't agree with you, saying 64bit isn't needed. I'd agree that "it depends", but saying it's not needed it bull. There are people who need it.
2012-10-14T09:00:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	now you're just trolling. you seem to lack the understanding of the different modes a modern x86 processer works in.
2012-10-14T09:02:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	because that's the unix standard.
2012-10-14T09:06:00.000Z	SwedeMike	poedragonwarrior	yeah, the fix is to move to 64bit counters for seconds since 1970 probably.
