2006-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	HymnToLife		all of them are good
2006-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	HymnToLife		my personal favourite is VLC
2006-05-03T05:24:00.000Z	HymnToLife		RehanSAlvi> this is not a problem with Ubuntu but with your VM, I don't think it's wise to use it if you're a "complete newbie"
2006-05-03T05:24:00.000Z	HymnToLife		better free some space on your actual hard drive and install on it
2006-05-03T05:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife		born_>  assume thee is and ask the eal question :)
2006-05-03T05:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife		real*
2006-05-03T05:26:00.000Z	HymnToLife		well, that's a HTML file, not PHP
2006-05-03T05:27:00.000Z	HymnToLife		that's weird
2006-05-03T05:27:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	well i'm a complete newbie to ubuntu :)  Has anyone been able to get it to work in VM environment with internet?
2006-05-03T05:27:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	how can I check to see if ubuntu has activated the network card?
2006-05-03T05:31:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	I'm only seeing the modem connection
2006-05-03T05:33:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	suppose I wasn't using VM and my ethernet adaptor wasn't being detected, what would you recommend I do?
2006-05-03T05:35:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	If I wasn't using VMware, and just had a stock ubuntu install and my NIC wasn't being detected, what would you recommend?
2006-05-03T05:36:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	network card = nic
2006-05-03T05:38:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	is that for me?
2006-05-03T05:52:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	here's a screenshot of my ifconfig :  http://img86.imageshack.us/img86/1444/untitled14az.jpg
2006-05-03T05:54:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	weird, it just started working on its own
2006-05-03T05:55:00.000Z	RehanSAlvi	HymnToLife	thanks for being so patient with me! :)
