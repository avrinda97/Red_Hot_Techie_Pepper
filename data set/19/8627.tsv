2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		no, i dont want the bootloader :)
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		that's why I want to "clean up" =)
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		should work fine?
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		oh :s
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		oke, so how to rebuild the MBR to make it go to windows (or the first bootable partition?)
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		I cant get into windows anymore, cause GRUB trys to run my linux partition
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		but I removed the linux partition
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	alitrix		so grub is looking to a "empty" partition
2007-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	at the grub prompt, rootnoverify (hd0,0)<enter> chainloader +1<enter> boot<enter>
2007-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	alitrix	ali1234	well, I can't get the boot menu , so I cant get in the grub prompt anymore
2007-03-22T07:40:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	you installed grub into the active partition instead of mbr? okay, just boot dos/knoppix and set the active partition to windows drive
2007-03-22T07:40:00.000Z	alitrix	ali1234	no, I installed grub on /dev/hda, and /boot/grub/* was on /dev/hdaxx
2007-03-22T07:41:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	you dont need that menu.lst to boot from grub. you can just manually type the commands
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	i did exactly the same thing accidentally about 5 days ago :)
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	alitrix	ali1234	I can't get in the prompt
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	then you have hosed it. just get a bootdisk of any kind
2007-03-22T07:46:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	in a push you could even pull the HD and put it in another machine to reset the active partition and maybe mbr
2007-03-22T07:46:00.000Z	alitrix	ali1234	I have a kubuntu dvd here, is there a way to the windows hd from it?
2007-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	ali1234	alitrix	look for the option that gives you a basic grub prompt
