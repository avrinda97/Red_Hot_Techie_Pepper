2007-02-02T15:01:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	what do you mean doesn't let you?
2007-02-02T15:02:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	hrm, maybe the mirror is down?
2007-02-02T15:04:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	huh that's strange
2007-02-02T15:05:00.000Z	Bug2000	ademan	If I try to do so via shell it tells me pack not found.
2007-02-02T15:06:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	i assume you've got universe and multiverse installed?
2007-02-02T15:06:00.000Z	Bug2000	ademan	If you mean by uncommenting, yes.
2007-02-02T15:06:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	have you done a sudo apt-get update     ?

2007-02-02T15:08:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	yeah have you tried pinging the mirrors?
2007-02-02T15:09:00.000Z	Bug2000	ademan	DNS is broken there.
2007-02-02T15:09:00.000Z	Bug2000	ademan	How do I refresh it?
2007-02-02T15:10:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	dunno, sorry
2007-02-02T15:23:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	did you follow the directions on winehq.com ?

2007-02-02T15:25:00.000Z	ademan	Bug2000	so what's the error?
2007-02-02T15:28:00.000Z	Bug2000	ademan	Something about package points to another one that doesn't exsist.
