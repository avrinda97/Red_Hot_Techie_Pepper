2005-02-07T16:33:00.000Z	swim		hay folks you know when gnome starts and it shows the splash, is there a way to change the color of the screen behind the splash?
2005-02-07T16:35:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	I can probably call xsetroot during or before that splash yeah
2005-02-07T16:36:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	what would that do?
2005-02-07T16:36:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	You can make xsetroot repalce the default X background
2005-02-07T16:37:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	how?
2005-02-07T16:37:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	now *that* is the million dollar question.
2005-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	ah got it :) xsetroot -solid brown for example
2005-02-07T16:51:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	Are you implying I'm meaner on #debian then here?
2005-02-07T16:51:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	yes! yes I am! it's your falt completley! ;P
2005-02-11T11:08:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	alien -t foo.deb
2005-02-11T11:08:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	cool thx
2005-02-11T11:09:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	should alien work on a non deb distro?
2005-12-20T12:02:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	dpkg -x
2005-12-20T12:03:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	it's highly likely not what you want, though.,
2005-12-20T12:04:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	Im trying to replace some files in baghira with moded ones... and then to make a deb again... im having trouble building baghira from source (at least with the moded files in it)
2005-12-20T12:05:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	How is it failing when you add modded files?
2005-12-20T12:07:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	like this: http://pastebin.ca/33745
2005-12-20T12:09:00.000Z	cafuego	swim	Looks like your mods broke the code.
2005-12-20T12:09:00.000Z	swim	cafuego	oh hmm
