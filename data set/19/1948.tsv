2010-08-21T16:15:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	Use aptitude in the future. It'll be a lot easier.
2010-08-21T16:15:00.000Z	kish	mgt_90	aptitude instad of apt-get?
2010-08-21T16:16:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	Yes. If you use aptitude to install a metapackage like Kubuntu, aptitude can remove the metapackage and all of its individual packages as well.
2010-08-21T16:16:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	It's a lot more aggressive in tracking dependencies.
2010-08-21T16:18:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	It only works if you installed with aptitude as well.
2010-08-21T16:19:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	If you used apt-get, you have to remove each package individually.
2010-08-21T16:20:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	No real need for that. Some folks gave you a link to a command you ought to be able to just copy and paste.
2010-08-21T16:21:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	It's a really long command, but you can just paste and run.
2010-08-21T16:21:00.000Z	kish	mgt_90	oh, with all the packages? great.
2010-08-21T16:21:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	Yeap.
2010-08-21T16:38:00.000Z	mgt_90	kish	Keep the faith.
2010-08-21T18:00:00.000Z	kish	mgt_90	found a way to remove everything apt-get install kubuntu-desktop installed.
