2010-03-03T21:27:00.000Z	gothran	cellofellow	I thing I have some problem with audio
2010-03-03T21:23:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	AVI and WAV file formats are both based on RIFF, but that doesn't mean that they're compatible.
2010-03-03T21:24:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	what is it you specifically want to do?
2010-03-03T21:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	video editting programs, I've used AviDemux, OpenMovieEditor, Cinelerra, and PiTiVi. My favorites are AviDemux for small jobs and Cinelerra for large ones.
2010-03-03T21:25:00.000Z	gothran	cellofellow	just merge audio and video but seems I cannot do that on my kk
2010-03-03T21:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	"merge audio and video" meaning add an audio track to a video file?
2010-03-03T21:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	does the video file already have an audio track? if so, do you want to replace it or mix with it?
2010-03-03T21:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	what format and codec is the video file?
2010-03-03T21:28:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	that's the format, what about codec?
2010-03-03T21:29:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	you can find the codec by right-clicking the file and looking at the Properties. It's in the Audio/Video tab.
2010-03-03T21:29:00.000Z	gothran	cellofellow	the codec is motion jpeg
2010-03-03T21:30:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	this is pretty easy with ffmpeg.
2010-03-03T21:31:00.000Z	gothran	cellofellow	could be that Gnome alsa mixer and jack control go in conflict?
2010-03-03T21:32:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	something like ffmpeg -i videofile.avi -i audiofile.wav -vcodec copy -acodec copy -map 1.0 -map 2.0 outfile.avi
2010-03-03T21:32:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	could be done with avidemux. Avidemux is basically an ffmpeg frontend dressed up like a non-linear editor.
2010-03-03T21:33:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	try the ffmpeg command
2010-03-03T21:34:00.000Z	gothran	cellofellow	where it is?
2010-03-03T21:34:00.000Z	cellofellow	gothran	I'll send it in a private message
2010-03-03T21:35:00.000Z	gothran	cellofellow	ok
