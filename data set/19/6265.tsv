2008-07-21T23:47:00.000Z	arthurmaciel		hi there.
2008-07-21T23:48:00.000Z	arthurmaciel		Don't know why, but after updating some packages, whenever I press a keyboard key, the mouse cursor is centered on the screen. How can I disable that?
2008-07-21T23:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	Any changes in your sources.list
2008-07-21T23:48:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	no. I have not messed with that.
2008-07-21T23:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit                      (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2008-07-21T23:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	what version or release of linux are you running
2008-07-21T23:50:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.stgraber.org/13071
2008-07-21T23:53:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	all the desktop effects are pretty weird now (application switch window is slow, sometimes windows borders disappear)
2008-07-21T23:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	Your sources list looks to have been modified and retouched.
2008-07-21T23:55:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	oh, when I change in the program add/remove the source.list is modified, right? Yes, I've added some sources. How can I fix it now?
2008-07-21T23:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	Adding your own sources can get you want you want for the moment but then an upgrade comes along and spoils your fun.
2008-07-21T23:57:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	but removing the new sources, how can I make the system keep programs only from the original sourcers?
2008-07-21T23:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	Going back is very difficult.  all the more reason we try to get people to do backups and have seperate /home directories
2008-07-21T23:58:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	I do have separate home directory, but I really do not want to format or reinstall it. I'll see what I can do. Thanks
2008-07-22T00:01:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	is it possible to update from 7.10 to 8.04 without reinstall?
2008-07-22T00:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	sure but if your system is messed up it may not work
2008-07-22T00:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arthurmaciel	IS there not a box to click in system.. admin..update manager to get you to hardy
2008-07-22T00:08:00.000Z	arthurmaciel	Jack_Sparrow	_ZeuZ_ and genii: thanks. it is working
