2010-09-04T21:25:00.000Z	jstoone		Hi everyone, can you guys tell me how I can get sun-java6 as default instead of OpenJDK?
2010-09-04T21:25:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	sudo update-alternatives --config java
2010-09-04T21:28:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	the way i do this is simply remove any other jvms
2010-09-04T21:31:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	you can type "which java" and "java -version" to verify
2010-09-04T21:35:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	When I type "which java" it outputs '/usr/bin/java'...  -   and when I do "java --version" it outputs the three different with 1)'java version "1.6.0_20"' - 2)'Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02)' - 3)'Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 16.3-b01, mixed mode)'
2010-09-04T21:36:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	It doesn't seem that i've done it right does it?
2010-09-04T21:36:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	actually, it does
2010-09-04T21:37:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	incandenza: Great, I'm glad, now I'll go on and configure Eclipse (:
2010-09-04T21:37:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	"java -version" tells you what actual java is. since file returned by "which java" is a symlink, you can see where to it points by recursively executing "file `which java`"
2010-09-04T21:39:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	I must admit I didn't fully understand the "file 'which java'" part :S
2010-09-04T21:40:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	if you wish, you can read "man file"
2010-09-04T21:42:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	Ah, ok (: well some tutorials on the internet says that i have to put a line in the jvm file.. but it doesn't seem to exist any longer?
2010-09-04T21:43:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	it should be located at /etc/jvm
2010-09-04T21:43:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	does anything require /etc/jvm?
2010-09-04T21:45:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	no but I was just slightly confused because I just follow the instructions from a-z.
2010-09-04T21:46:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	consider your java configured. eclipse should work. had it complained about not having /etc/jvm or anything else, come back and state your problem ;)
2010-09-04T21:47:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	Hey, everything works now, and thank you so much for you patience (:
2010-09-04T21:47:00.000Z	janisozaur	jstoone	you're welcome
2010-09-04T21:47:00.000Z	jstoone	janisozaur	and no Eclipse does not complain at all (:
