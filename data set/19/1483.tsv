2011-01-11T19:03:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha		My mouse is messed up. Right-click grabs a window (does not click in it), center-click resizes it (does not paste), etc. This after a 3 year old decided to help out. Anyone have any ideas how to get back to normalcy?
2011-01-11T19:03:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	sounds like alt is stuck
2011-01-11T19:03:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Check your keyboard
2011-01-11T19:04:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	Checked, with xev and  xinput. No keys are reported as "down"
2011-01-11T19:05:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Hm.. have you tried checking xev and xinput for the mouse itself?
2011-01-11T19:05:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Do you have another computer you can compare them to?
2011-01-11T19:06:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	I can fish out a laptop I think.
2011-01-11T19:07:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	I'll try that and pop back in if I still can't figure it out.
2011-01-11T19:08:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Mines literally says "Button one"
2011-01-11T19:13:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	using xev of xinput?
2011-01-11T19:18:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	what was the issue?
2011-01-11T19:19:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	what do you see on the screen?
2011-01-11T19:19:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	can you ssh/telnet in?
2011-01-11T19:21:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	when it's blank. I had a problem like that on one of my laptops with the nvidia driver, alt-sysreg-b did not work, but I could ssh in. Otherwise the machine looked dead. It was a dual GPU setup though. Any of this sound familiar?
2011-01-11T19:25:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	And you've tried to remove and regenerate the xorg.conf (backing it up of course) in recovery mode?
2011-01-11T19:25:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	yes, several times
2011-01-11T19:25:00.000Z	Tamale_	Mr_Copro_Encepha	I've even had success rotating with xrandr
2011-01-11T19:26:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	Maybe the hack here is to put xrandr into your startup applications under gdm. I don't have any better suggestions now.
2011-01-11T19:29:00.000Z	Mr_Copro_Encepha	Tamale_	Not sure, but you can add an entry in /etc/sudoers to allow just xrandr to be run by your user with NOPASSWD.
