2009-07-27T18:20:00.000Z	warden		i like xubuntu over the remix.. on my eee 701 the remix ran slower then xubuntu
2009-07-27T18:20:00.000Z	warden		or go crunchbang for good speed
2009-07-27T18:21:00.000Z	warden		or if you have an eee 701 ... eeebuntu is still the best
2009-07-27T18:21:00.000Z	warden		yes and the eee kernel
2009-07-27T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	puppy is good too

2009-07-27T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	both great for the 7 series
2009-07-27T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	thats pretty bloated, puppy is about 100Mb
2009-07-27T18:29:00.000Z	warden	ActionParsnip	ya i hear ya but I have never liked puppy's installer
2009-07-27T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	doest matter, once its installed you never see the installer again
2009-07-27T18:31:00.000Z	warden	ActionParsnip	ya i dig puppy but i am an ubuntu fanboi these days don't really look at puppy much anymore. :)
2009-07-27T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	check xpud if you are impress by boot times

2009-07-27T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	not really, the functionality is quite limited, but hey..its boot time that matters right
2009-07-27T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	answer = no
2009-07-27T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warden	theres even a boot image you can plonk in /boot and add a line to meu.lst
