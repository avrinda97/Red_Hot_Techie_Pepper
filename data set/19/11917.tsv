2005-11-22T11:55:00.000Z	wx9j		connect to server has no smb option to allow me to talk to my win box, any ideas why ?
2005-11-22T11:56:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	just use nautilus with smb://192.168.x.x
2005-11-22T11:56:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	or Places -> Network Sevrers
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	wx9j	khermans	you got me there , this has been making me nuts for days
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	you mean it worked for you ?
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	khermans		good
2005-11-22T12:00:00.000Z	wx9j	khermans	the browser did, got the shared folders showing in the browser
2005-11-22T12:00:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	:-)
2005-11-22T12:00:00.000Z	wx9j		but the damm thing wont let me look in the folder :)
2005-11-22T12:02:00.000Z	wx9j	khermans	the places -netowrk servers sets me in an endless loop of asking for password
2005-11-22T12:02:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	save it -- and if that fails just click cancel on the following screens
2005-11-22T12:02:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	it will still let you ine
2005-11-22T12:03:00.000Z	wx9j		I will try that
2005-11-22T12:03:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	best thing to do is mount your shared stuff in /etc/fstab
2005-11-22T12:05:00.000Z	wx9j		well khermans , still no luck, but thanks for the help.
2005-11-22T12:06:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	you sure you have the user and password and dmoain correct
2005-11-22T12:07:00.000Z	wx9j		the domain is correct although it keeps defaulting to some MSHOME crap, this is a test sys to the passwd is same on both box
2005-11-22T12:11:00.000Z	wx9j	khermans	when I select connect to server, the service type has no SMB option, am I missing some code somewhere
2005-11-22T12:12:00.000Z	khermans	wx9j	dunno
