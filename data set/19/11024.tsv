2006-04-12T16:17:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	What's up?  Problems with crypto-disks?
2006-04-12T16:18:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	yes.
2006-04-12T16:19:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	What's not working?
2006-04-12T16:20:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	Devmapper is just not there, the error is Incompatible libdevmapper 1.01.03 (2005-06-13)(compat) and kernel driver.
2006-04-12T16:20:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	Did you install dm-crypt?
2006-04-12T16:21:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	it is installed. This worked for a year untill today.
2006-04-12T16:22:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	I see!  What have you done recently, that might have caused it?
2006-04-12T16:22:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	removed some things fron init and installed ubuntu-desktop.
2006-04-12T16:23:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	I added those things, no change.
2006-04-12T16:23:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	Do you sill have /etc/init.d/cryptdisks startup script?
2006-04-12T16:26:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	the error: http://paste.lisp.org/display/18726
2006-04-12T16:27:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	What about symlinks for that startup script, in rc0.d and rc6.d?
2006-04-12T16:28:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	they are there, but symlinks won't solve the problem.
2006-04-12T16:29:00.000Z	rob_p		Do you have dm-crypt listed in /etc/modules?
2006-04-12T16:30:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	as I expected, a mssing module was the problem (but I did't now its name): dm-med
2006-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	Yeah, I was going to ask next about dm-mod.
2006-04-12T16:33:00.000Z	rob_p	sandra	 So ya got it figured out then?  Hope so anyway. :-)
2006-04-12T16:34:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	yes, I still has some clean up to do.
2006-04-12T16:35:00.000Z	sandra	rob_p	thank you for your help!
