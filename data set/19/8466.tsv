2007-11-25T21:24:00.000Z	Ashfire908		with the alternate/server cd's recovery mode, what would "reinstalling grub" do?
2007-11-25T21:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	reinstall grub ?? ;) i guess it set ups ggogle on your mbr (for example what you need to do after installing windows)
2007-11-25T21:28:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	no clue what you just said. i'm trying to install grub to a jump drive to avoid installing it on the computer. (this is only going to be used temporaryly)
2007-11-25T21:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	maybe it is better to use a grub flppy disk? (if the machine still has floppy ;))
2007-11-25T21:29:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	nope no floppy (#%^#% WHY DO THEY NO LONGER PUT FLOPPY DRIVES IN???)
2007-11-25T21:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	or boot with the livecd (it has an option called boot from hard drive)
2007-11-25T21:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	which is pointless because it does the same thing as not haveing the cd in the drive in the first place
2008-03-09T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	if yiou use ULOG target to /var/log/ulog/* if not to syslog afaik
2008-03-09T20:40:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	i don't see it in syslog
2008-03-09T20:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	then dunno I use firehol wich in turn has an option tu use ulog and thats what i use
2008-03-19T20:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	that's a normal msg. There is no need to worry about it. The ipv6 routers is normal too
2008-03-19T20:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	i didn't get anything about ipv6.
2008-03-19T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	sorry then forget the second sentence
2008-03-19T20:05:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	so it's normal to get that after the "Loading Please Wait..." message?
2008-03-19T20:08:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	it's just the kernel has been freezing and the screen showing garbage when i try to boot the cd sometimes
2008-04-19T22:25:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	syslinux is a project
2008-04-19T22:26:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	ignore my last message
2010-09-07T20:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ashfire908	try running « reset » on the terminal
2010-09-07T20:48:00.000Z	Ashfire908	erUSUL	I tried that already, and I tried it again. No effect.
