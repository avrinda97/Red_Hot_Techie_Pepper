2012-02-11T11:09:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	what package is farkles installed in
2012-02-11T11:11:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	I can't find the farkles package. did you install that from a 3rd party repo or even a 4th party repo?
2012-02-11T11:13:00.000Z	cryptodira	jetole	now that you have had your fun.... do you have a solution to the problem with upgrading?
2012-02-11T11:14:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	nope. sorry
2012-02-11T11:14:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	someone else might though
2012-02-11T11:26:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	oh I have done the upgrade on some server systems which works well and the same process applies to desktops
2012-02-11T11:26:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	let me see if I can find the url
2012-02-11T11:27:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	which version of ubuntu are you using
2012-02-11T11:27:00.000Z	cryptodira	jetole	currently 10.10 fully patched
2012-02-11T11:28:00.000Z	cryptodira	jetole	amd/64 10.10
2012-02-11T11:28:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	I know the versions say something different then what you have but try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades#Network_Upgrade_for_Ubuntu_Servers_.28Recommended.29
2012-02-11T11:29:00.000Z	cryptodira	jetole	Thanks!   i will give that a try.
2012-02-11T11:30:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	hope it helps
2012-02-11T11:34:00.000Z	cryptodira	jetole	that link was no different than what i have already been doing...after clicking to upgrade, we get no further instructions because the system is NOT downloading the release notes.... it hangs at that error.
2012-02-11T11:35:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	if you had to click to upgrade then you didn't follow the directions on the link I gave you
2012-02-11T11:36:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades#Network_Upgrade_for_Ubuntu_Servers_.28Recommended.29
2012-02-11T11:43:00.000Z	cryptodira	jetole	you were correct!   i failed to do the server route.... This appears to be working.... Thank YOU for your time and effort!!
2012-02-11T11:44:00.000Z	jetole	cryptodira	no worries. glad it worked
