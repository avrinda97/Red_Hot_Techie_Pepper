2006-08-17T10:05:00.000Z	wallison		anyone got bcm43xx working on ppc?
2006-08-17T10:05:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	plenty of people have, but frankly, I'm unsure that Ubuntu can do it.
2006-08-17T10:06:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	I got it to scan, but wouldn't join
2006-08-17T10:06:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	seeing as how most successes come from Gentoo/ppc users...
2006-08-17T10:07:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	maybe i'll check out their forums, not tonight though, been messing with it for days!
2006-08-17T10:08:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	I suggest asking in #bcm-users.
2006-08-17T10:08:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	ok, thanks
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	i'll try again in a couple days, for now Ubuntu's madwifi is working with my pc card
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	thanks for the suggestions
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	np.
2006-08-17T10:28:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	you back?
2006-08-17T10:29:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	thought we better discuss in here before we got flamed in #gentoo!
2006-08-17T10:30:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	nah, it's fine.
2006-08-17T10:30:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	just don't want to give 'em a reason!
2006-08-17T10:31:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	they're pretty bad sometimes in #debian too
2006-08-17T10:31:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	mm. Well, we try to keep it reasonably friendly in there, but I understand the main gentoo chan isn't all that friendly.
2006-08-17T10:32:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	cool, it's been a while since i've used linux and been in any channels, going off couple of years ago
2006-08-17T10:34:00.000Z	silverpower	wallison	I'm afraid I won't be of much help on Ubuntu-specific issues - this is a temporary install until Gentoo finishes rebuilding, and I wanted to see how far they'd come. I'm impressed.
2006-08-17T10:34:00.000Z	wallison	silverpower	yeah, me too. Long time slacker here
