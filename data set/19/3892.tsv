2009-05-09T09:59:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	what are the permissions on ~/.config/ ?
2009-05-09T09:59:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	or .config/openbox/
2009-05-09T10:01:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	on I see your pastebin. looks like it's crashing. could be something to do with your theme. you could try manually changing the theme and trying to run obconf again.
2009-05-09T10:02:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	hang on
2009-05-09T10:03:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	edit rc.xml and look for the opening <theme> tag
2009-05-09T10:03:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	~/.config/openbox/rc.xml
2009-05-09T10:06:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	for <theme> make it <!--theme> and for </theme> make it </theme-->, then restart openbox. if it doesnt start, edit that file and remove the !-- and -- to get it to start again.
2009-05-09T10:06:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	not sure if this will let you open obconf, just a hunch
2009-05-09T10:09:00.000Z	ShazbotMcNasty	bc	no it dodn't work, I now have a blue theme and it didn't open.
2009-05-09T10:09:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	ok change it back, one sec
2009-05-09T10:10:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	if you `sudo su` then run obconf, does that open?
2009-05-09T10:11:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	if this isn't you, then check this out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=839978
2009-05-09T10:12:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	it probably is a theme issue according to that thread
2009-05-09T10:14:00.000Z	ShazbotMcNasty	bc	thanks
2009-05-09T10:14:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	did you get it werkin?
2009-05-09T10:15:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	if you can't tell which theme it is, backup all of them and only put your theme in there, then start it. if ti starts, add them one by one until you figure out which one is the culprit :D
2009-05-09T10:16:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	or maybe just single out the compressed ones. bz2, gz, etc
2009-05-09T10:23:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	you got it
2009-05-09T10:26:00.000Z	bc	ShazbotMcNasty	you're welcome type thing :D
