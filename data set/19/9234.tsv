2007-02-19T09:17:00.000Z	rbil		I just upadated my system from Dapper to Edgy. I see now that Edgy is using UUID to designate harddrives. I keep a cloned backup of my hd on another hd. Will I have problem booting if the UUID doesn't work on the different hd?
2007-02-19T09:19:00.000Z	rbil		I can see maybe using UUIDs for removable drives, but this is a real step backwards to force it into Grub
2007-02-19T09:20:00.000Z	rbil		anyone know if I'd break things using /dev/ instead of UUID in Grub?
2007-02-19T09:22:00.000Z	rbil		UUID's shouldn't be used in Grub for the very reason I've cited. This completely screws up disk cloning.
2007-02-19T09:23:00.000Z	rbil		it's worse than DRM as far as i'm concerned!
2007-02-19T09:24:00.000Z	rbil		what developer with Ubuntu is responsible to for this change to UUID in Grub and how to I reach him?
2007-02-19T09:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	rbil	The one with the evil eyes. If you find a way to reach him through the screen, tell me too. :)
2007-02-19T09:25:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	make fun if you want. but this is really serious and crippling
2007-02-19T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	rbil	You can use the old format if you want. Just change it manually.
2007-02-19T09:26:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	after making changes to menu.lst do I just reboot or is something else required?
2007-02-19T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	rbil	Nope, just reboot. Grub reads that file every time.
2007-02-19T09:27:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	thankyou
2007-03-01T10:43:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	of course! only when adding a new line to fstab will mount -a by itself work
2007-03-06T09:47:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	yes with a nautilus script
2007-03-06T09:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	rbil	Any way that works by default?
2007-03-06T09:48:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	don't know what u mean?
2007-03-06T09:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	rbil	Something that works with a default nautilus. Something that doesn't have to be configured.
2007-03-06T09:49:00.000Z	rbil	arrenlex	there wouldn't be an addon script if it already existed, would there?
2007-03-06T09:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	rbil	Well that's what I was asking.
