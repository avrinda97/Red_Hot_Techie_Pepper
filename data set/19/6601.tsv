2009-02-05T08:45:00.000Z	Rodolfo		Hi! I'm trying to install Ubuntu (any 8.04 or 8.10 {32 and 64}) on a computer that I have just build, but it hangs at " loading, please wait" after rebooting from another OS and choose "install" . I have been waiting for as long as 30 minuts and nothing else happens. Any ideas. Thanks.
2009-02-05T08:46:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	does it work when you choose "boot livecd" instead of install?
2009-02-05T08:47:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	no same message "loading, please wait"
2009-02-05T08:47:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	did you check the cd for integrity?
2009-02-05T08:48:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	hrm... well, could be anything really... you can try an alternate boot cd, see if that works out better for you.
2009-02-05T08:49:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	thanks!
2009-02-05T08:49:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	hope that helps.. good luck :)
2009-02-05T08:52:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	thanks again. But in a quick watch to all those differents kinds of intall methods, that one looks complicated. Do you think maybe it could cause my CPU is not recognized by the kernel?
2009-02-05T08:53:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	unless you have something really exotic, that wouldn't be the problem...
2009-02-05T08:54:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	haha no, I dont think it is a really exoctic one. it's a Phenom II
2009-02-05T08:55:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	should be ok... could be anything else though. if you built your own comp, often poor memory seating causes problems. did you run the memtest?
2009-02-05T08:55:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	or just bad chips, too
2009-02-05T08:56:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	I'm afraid that the second choice could be the one (foxconn A7DA S)... maybe that... ok I'll see
2009-02-05T08:57:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	the boot cd also has a memory test option - so try running that. might take a while, but it's worth it to run that on a freshly built com.
2009-02-05T08:57:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	*comp
2009-02-05T08:59:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	ok looks like I should try that... even if same rig have W7 beta running on it without any problems...maybe linux kernel is as much picky like that!! I will try the mem test though!!
2009-02-05T09:00:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	ok, give that a shot, and see what it reports. :) could be all good, you know... no guarantees that that's the problem.
2009-02-05T09:01:00.000Z	Rodolfo	nanotube	cool!!
2009-02-05T09:01:00.000Z	nanotube	Rodolfo	good luck :)
