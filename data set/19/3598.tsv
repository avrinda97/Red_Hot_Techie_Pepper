2009-07-10T21:37:00.000Z	richardcavell		Hi everyone. I just did sudo gparted and created a new partition in ext3 format. The owner of this partition is root. I need to change the partition and all its contents to be owned by me. I tried sudo chown -R /media/mypartition and it changed everything except the partition itself. What do I need to do?

2009-07-10T21:38:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	Huh?
2009-07-10T21:38:00.000Z	jrib	richardcavell	pastebin a series of commands that shows you running chown -R and then checking permissions
2009-07-10T21:43:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	Never mind, it seems that it wants to work now.
2009-07-17T15:43:00.000Z	jrib	richardcavell	wfm with no issues, try #winehq
2009-07-17T15:44:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	I can't really debug it because it makes my computer to strange things. It's certainly not the sort of thing that should tax my system performance-wise.
2009-07-17T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	richardcavell	strange thing to say, but ok
2009-07-17T15:46:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	The opening videos don't play (seems to be a common issue with Wine/Half-life), I get mad flickering, incorrect zoom, can't change video options, get sound repeating itself, and that's only up to the first menu!
2009-07-17T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	richardcavell	well you can change the video options with the command you use to execute it (as in appdb)
2009-07-17T15:47:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	I know. But I seriously end up having to do a hard reset half the time and it really tests my patience.  I've spent days trying to get it to work.
2009-07-17T15:48:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	I want to see if I can get it installed on Windows 7
2009-07-17T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	richardcavell	they work after extracting the firmware (instructions on wiki)
2009-07-17T15:59:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	I don't understand what that's about - how does the camera firmware have to be installed in Ubuntu?

2009-07-17T16:02:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	thanks for link. I will study it and test it thoroughly on my machine.
2009-07-18T17:04:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	Why'd you ban Capt_Planet?
2009-07-20T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	richardcavell	/me foo
2009-07-20T05:49:00.000Z	richardcavell	jrib	thanks
