2006-04-27T09:49:00.000Z	delliott		ARGH, which java returns nothing now.
2006-04-27T09:49:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	what are you trying to do?
2006-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	Install Java1.5 on PPC.
2006-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	so I take it using java-package did not work?
2006-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	Just trying to follow the wiki.
2006-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	there are javadebs available if you would rather use them instead of creating your own
2006-04-27T09:52:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	The problem arises when I try sudo update-alternatives
2006-04-27T09:52:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	what happens when you do that?
2006-04-27T09:53:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	http://rafb.net/paste/results/27JXL284.html
2006-04-27T09:54:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	ugh does the wiki really suggest you alien an rpm?
2006-04-27T09:56:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	ok, want to try to remove that and use this instead: http://www.giannaros.org/buntu/breezy/ppc/ ?
2006-04-27T09:57:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	Ok.
2006-04-27T09:59:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	still not working after the new package?
2006-04-27T09:59:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	Just working on it.
2006-04-27T10:21:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	That worked :D
2006-04-27T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	yeah you should avoid alien as much as possible if you can
2006-04-27T10:23:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	go for it
2006-04-27T10:24:00.000Z	delliott	_jason	Should I link the .deb from your site?
2006-04-27T10:25:00.000Z	_jason	delliott	that sounds fine, just make a note at the top that a deb is available which is better than alien'ing the rpm and link to it and provide the dpkg -i command
