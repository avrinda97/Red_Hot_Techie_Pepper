2011-01-14T04:36:00.000Z	bballard		hi folks, wonder if someone can help.  when connecting an external USB drive i get "waiting for device to settle before scanning" under 10.04 LTS.  any ideas?
2011-01-14T04:36:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	 wait... should stop scanning w/in 30 secs
2011-01-14T04:37:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	thanks, but it doesn't
2011-01-14T04:37:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	drat
2011-01-14T04:38:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	have you successfully mounted this drive on the computer before?
2011-01-14T04:41:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	yes i've managed it in the past.  what has changed is i've gone from 10.10 to 10.04 LTS (clean install)
2011-01-14T04:42:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	I'm assuming you've installed all updates
2011-01-14T04:43:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	yes i have.  i fear something may have changed in the kernel used or a configuration file but i'll be damned if i can find what it is via google
2011-01-14T04:53:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	thanks for trying to help.  looks like i'm going to have to restart laptop everytime i want to plug a usb drive in
2011-01-14T04:54:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	might have to do w/ how you unmount
2011-01-14T04:55:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	recall there being two selections in 10.04 one being "Eject" and the other being "Safely Remove"
2011-01-14T04:55:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	either by device notifier (kde user), umount
2011-01-14T04:56:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	ah, I'm talking about stock ubuntu w/ nautilus, "Safely Remove" seemed to remove the ability of that drive to show up in the file manager at all..... hope they fixed that
2011-01-14T04:56:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	never failed to cause the g/f to swear when she hit the wrong one by mistake and had to reboot
2011-01-14T04:57:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	this is before the desktop environment.  dmesg never shows the inserted device as having an in /dev/
2011-01-14T04:58:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	I gotcha
2011-01-14T04:59:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	if its true..... that kind of blows that one must reboot.... known issue fixed in 10.10?
2011-01-14T04:59:00.000Z	neozen	bballard	might be specific to the drives you have
2011-01-14T05:00:00.000Z	bballard	neozen	might be fixed in 10.10 but 10.10 broke so many other things i didn't get to find out.  and given i have 3 different brands of USB sticks, 4 different ext hard drives that all work if they're the first device plugged in i'm puzzled
