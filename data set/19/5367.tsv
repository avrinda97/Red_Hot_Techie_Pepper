2009-09-04T09:57:00.000Z	Getaway		hey guys, i just made a virtual machine in virtualbox with ubuntu. how do i go about adding video drivers or something so i can get higher res than 800x600
2009-09-04T09:58:00.000Z	Getaway		how?
2009-09-04T09:59:00.000Z	Getaway		is the guest package in ubuntu or virtualbox?
2009-09-04T10:00:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	LucidGuy: its called "Guest Additions", start the Virtual Machine in vbox and click on "Devices" than "Install Guest Additions" and it will mount the virtual CD ROM Image in the Virtual Machine
2009-09-04T10:02:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	are you running XP in the virtual machine?
2009-09-04T10:03:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	well it should show a CD ROM device on the desktop.. like a disc.. double click it and run the <filename>.run file
2009-09-04T10:11:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	did you get the guest additions installed mate?
2009-09-04T10:12:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	you installed it via "sudo sh" right?
2009-09-04T10:13:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	Guest addtions needs to be installed with admin privileges.. so if your installing it from the terminal it would be "sudo sh <filename>.run" where the filename is vboxguest something something
2009-09-04T10:15:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	have you ever used the terminal?
2009-09-04T10:18:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	ok, so if your in the guest now.. go to Applications > Accessories > Terminal
2009-09-04T10:20:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	after you do, and the Guest Additions CD mounts inside the guest.. in the terminal type, "cd /media/cdrom0" then do a "ls" to make sure your in the right directory
2009-09-04T10:21:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	do you see the contents of the CD in the terminal? after the "ls" command?
2009-09-04T10:22:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	unless your running an amd64 guest..
2009-09-04T10:22:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	but it should be "sudo <filename>.run" or "sudo sh <filename>.run" I cant remember
2009-09-04T10:28:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	basically, linux can NOT get infected with a Windows virus.. but it can distribute infected files to Windows clients.
2009-09-04T10:29:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	therefore, if you have sharing between the host & guest operating systems, than yes. The guest linux machine can infect the host windows machine with a virus by file sharing (of already infected files)
2009-09-04T10:30:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	yes, in the same sense that if you dont turn on your computer you dont have to worry about virus's...
2009-09-04T10:32:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Getaway	well, at first look I would say your right.. but to get more specific, I think it would depend on the way the virtual machines network adapter is configured.. NAT or Direct Access... I simply do not know enough about the VM to answer that 100% truthfully, but its a sound theory.
