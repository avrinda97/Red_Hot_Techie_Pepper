2007-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	ccooke		The biggest problem I have with 64bit atm is the lack of a java browser plugin. There is *no* 64-bit plugin for *any* architecture that's worth using.
2007-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	ccooke		if either sun or someone else came up with a compliant and reliable plugin, I'd be using 64bit now
2007-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	ccooke		The lack of a 64-bit plugin is... a serious misstep. It's been in their ticketing system since (IIRC) 2003... and there's no progress whatsoever

2007-09-27T07:58:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	That doesn't include the browser plugin

2007-09-27T08:02:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	Think "gamers". It's not unusual to have 2G on a new system these days - or even 4.
2007-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	|Torg|	ccooke	having 4G and NEEDING 4G are two differnt things
2007-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	Quite true. Right now, most people who have 4g don't need it. Now, this time *next* year? Or the year after?
2007-09-27T08:05:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	on a 32-bit system, any one process is limited to a total of 4G memory that it can see. There are ways to extend that, but they are cumbersome and usually use some sort of memory window - mapping a segment of larger memory onto a region of the process' space, then repeatedly remapping the window
2007-09-27T08:06:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	The most common ones will be games, certainly
2007-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	hmm. I've seen a load of games that *recommend* you have 2G of RAM in the last 18 months or so
2007-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	The real point is - there *are* good reasons to go to 64-bit, which is why it's frustrating that the environment (java, as I complained) isn't ready.
2007-09-27T08:10:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	(if you're using mysql/innodb, having a very big buffer pool is lovely. Being able to allocate 11G and then realising you database runs entirely in RAM? That's *nice*)
2007-09-27T08:11:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	... several dozen. I'm a sysadmin and so are many of the people I hang out with :-)
2007-09-27T08:12:00.000Z	|Torg|	ccooke	I deal with mythtv users, I assue you most people cant even read a SQL statement let alone know how to use mysql
2007-09-27T08:14:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	... how does the fact that "most people" don't understand SQL (which is a fact I'm quite familiar with) make all the people who *do* need more than 4G somehow vanish?
2007-09-27T08:15:00.000Z	ccooke	|Torg|	IIRC, we started this with a discussion about whether 64-bit was a useful thing or not... I've given you several examples of people who *need* it now and several examples of people who either need or *will* need it in the near future...
2007-09-27T08:15:00.000Z	|Torg|	ccooke	I just mean most common users of mysql (say for a php website, or loading in mythtv configureations) dont need large pools.  Only whn you get into commercial usees of databases (well currently) does is happen
