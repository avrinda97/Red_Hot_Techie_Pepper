2008-12-30T06:03:00.000Z	Jangari		in setting up program launchers, or configuring 'opens with' configurations for filetypes, is there a way to make a file open in a tab in a program rather than initialising another instance of the program?
2008-12-30T06:03:00.000Z	Jangari		i'm running oxygen as a java program and 'opens with' opens a new oxygen window each time
2008-12-30T06:04:00.000Z	Jangari		i can drag into it from nautilus, so it certainly supports tabs, it's just a matter of 'opens with' looking for previous instances of oxygen
2008-12-30T06:04:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	how annoying! oxygen maintainers may not have provided a file-opener dispatcher
2008-12-30T06:05:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	what i called a 'file opener dispatcher' is what zsquareplusc called a remote
2008-12-30T06:05:00.000Z	Jangari	hdon	it could be that I'm running the 'all platforms' version, the pure java one
2008-12-30T06:05:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	only if the maintainers haven't implemented a remote/dispatcher for the pure-java implementation
2008-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	Jangari		hmm, where do these remotes sit?
2008-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	in between the typical invocation path (the command that gets run when you open the program with or without filenames for opening) and the actual program binary
2008-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	Jangari		i had to create my own by 'run a custom command: /usr/local/bin/oxygen/oxygen.sh'
2008-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	the remote/dispatcher will either open a new instance of the application, or it will just tell the currently running one to open something new
2008-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	Jangari		right,
2008-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	you'll need to ask the maintainers of the program if there is a reason this doesn't exist or isn't properly configured for your system in the pure java version
2008-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	Jangari		is there a flag or something that i can add to that terminal command to open the specified/selected file in a new tab of a current instance?
2008-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	depends on the application
2008-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	hdon	Jangari	you'll need to ask the developers or look into the code yourself -- i wouldn't know about implementing such a remote/dsipatcher in java personally
2008-12-30T06:08:00.000Z	Jangari		okay, i'll send oxygen support an email
2008-12-30T06:08:00.000Z	Jangari		thanks guys
2008-12-30T06:08:00.000Z	Jangari	hdon	specifically
