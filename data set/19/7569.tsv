2007-08-09T12:05:00.000Z	godzirra		I'm trying to get ubuntu installed on my laptop, but its been sitting at the screen that says "Ubuntu" and has the little orange bar moving back and forth underneath for about 20 minutes.
2007-08-09T12:05:00.000Z	godzirra		a gig
2007-08-09T12:06:00.000Z	godzirra		Yup.
2007-08-09T12:06:00.000Z	godzirra		bleh.. ok.  I've got to download it first.
2007-08-09T12:06:00.000Z	godzirra		I was afraid you'd say that.
2007-08-09T12:07:00.000Z	godzirra		<flamewar>Thats because ubuntu's pretty awesome and fedora sucks.</flamewar>
2007-08-09T12:08:00.000Z	godzirra		I'd have answered you already if I didn't find you so annoying. ;)
2007-08-09T12:09:00.000Z	godzirra		Hmm.
2007-08-09T12:09:00.000Z	godzirra		Where's the laptop compatibility list?  I didnt realize there even was one.
