2010-04-30T15:26:00.000Z	sam204475		Hey where is compiz on 10.04>?  it says installed but i cant find it
2010-04-30T15:28:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 you'll prolly want to install the "compizconfig-settings-manager"  or whatever it's called, might have a hyphen in the wrong place
2010-04-30T15:32:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 gparted
2010-04-30T15:33:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 then how can you possibly remove windows?
2010-04-30T15:34:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 what koshari said
2010-04-30T15:34:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 just use gparted, like i said
2010-04-30T15:37:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 gparted has everything you need to know... how many partitions does it show, what's on each of them, and how large is each one??
2010-04-30T15:38:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 i don't use wubi, and neither should you if you don't use windows... i'd also get rid of that windows recovery partition as well
2010-04-30T15:39:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 don't use wubi is all you need to know
2010-04-30T15:40:00.000Z	sam204475	grndslm	Great help....
2010-04-30T15:40:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	yes, you already answered your own question
2010-04-30T15:41:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 anything is possible
2010-04-30T15:41:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 what was it that you said you should do, again?
2010-04-30T15:41:00.000Z	sam204475	grndslm	 thats not true. having sex with a dinosaur is impossible.
2010-04-30T15:41:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 i just raped my gecko yesterday
2010-04-30T15:41:00.000Z	sam204475	grndslm	close enough for me.
2010-04-30T15:42:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 what is google?
2010-04-30T15:42:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 some questions are best left to google
2010-04-30T15:42:00.000Z	grndslm	sam204475	 learning how to research is the first part to becoming a man instead of a bot
