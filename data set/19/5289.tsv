2008-07-30T21:57:00.000Z	soundray	cashngo	essentially, you have to follow the instructions for dialup now, except that you substitute your device name (try out which one).
2008-07-30T21:57:00.000Z	soundray		!dialup > cashngo
2008-07-30T21:58:00.000Z	soundray	cashngo	it's also worth stfw, e.g. http://my.opera.com/owais_lone/blog/how-to-connect-gprs-on-ubuntu
2008-07-30T21:58:00.000Z	soundray	cashngo	(searching the fine web)
2008-07-30T21:59:00.000Z	cashngo	soundray	but why i cant use networkmanager? it is supposed to support gprs?
2008-07-30T22:00:00.000Z	soundray	cashngo	you can try connecting with network manager. Use the 'Dialup Connections' entry you get when you left click on nm-applet
