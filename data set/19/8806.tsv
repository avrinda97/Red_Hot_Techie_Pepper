2007-05-31T11:39:00.000Z	misfit		It runs well on ubuntu, I'm using it right now.
2007-05-31T11:40:00.000Z	misfit		Kevin, you know how some programs minimize into the panel, but others minimize into icons near the date/time?  Well, those icons don't  appear anymore, so when I minimize a program I know it's running for sure, but I can't see it anymore.
2007-05-31T11:41:00.000Z	misfit		I believe so, Kevin, it's the upper-right most part of the taskbar by default.
2007-05-31T11:42:00.000Z	misfit		Let me see if it's there, what's it for?
2007-05-31T11:44:00.000Z	misfit		My God, it worked!  Thanks man, you're a genius.
2007-05-31T11:45:00.000Z	misfit		One more thing Kevin... I miss the ctrl-alt-delete feature in windows, does Linux have anything similar?
2007-05-31T11:46:00.000Z	misfit		@Me22, I've used the system manager but does it have a keyboard shortcut to bring it up?
2007-05-31T11:47:00.000Z	misfit		if a program freezes, I don't want to ctrl-alt-backspace, it restarts everything...
2007-05-31T11:47:00.000Z	cables	misfit	just hit the X button, it'll come up with a force-quit dialog
2007-05-31T11:48:00.000Z	misfit	cables	you mean ctrl-alt-x?  @dawn_chorus: thank you, I'm checking it right now.
2007-05-31T11:49:00.000Z	cables	misfit	if you hit the X button on the top right of a window that's frozen, a dialog will pop up after a few seconds that will let you kill it. And unlike the End Task thingy that does that in Windows, it actually works.
2007-05-31T11:51:00.000Z	misfit	cables	yeah, I've noticed that about Ubuntu, it's been awesome.  The only problem I had was getting my geforce ti 4600 running with the desktop effects...
2007-05-31T11:53:00.000Z	cables	misfit	I didn't send you that
2007-05-31T11:54:00.000Z	cables	misfit	it was dawn_chorus
2007-05-31T11:55:00.000Z	cables	misfit	hit PrintScreen
2007-05-31T11:55:00.000Z	cables	misfit	it'll open a thingy
2007-05-31T11:56:00.000Z	cables	misfit	or you can go to Applications>Accessories>Take Screenshot
2007-05-31T11:56:00.000Z	cables	misfit	go to Applications>Accessories>Take Screenshot, like I said.
2007-05-31T11:57:00.000Z	cables	misfit	yeah, that lets you choose what window to screenshot.
