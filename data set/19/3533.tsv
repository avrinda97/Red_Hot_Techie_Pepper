2009-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	Mike94287		Can someone tell me how to restart xorg, I think that may be the problem
2009-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 hit ctrl-alt-F1, that will take you to a console, log in, then type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, then type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start. that should restart you xorg, you may have to hit ctrl-alt-F7 but I don't think so.
2009-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	Okay I'll try that, thanks.
2009-07-23T11:49:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	That didn't seem to fix my problem, my window controls aren't showing, my windows are going over my panels and I can't move anything.
2009-07-23T11:50:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 r you using compiz? try to run this: metacity from a command prompt
2009-07-23T11:51:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	Yes I'm using compiz but it's not working either right now, also I don't know how I can access Terminal because this chat window is blocking my menus and I can't move it out of the way
2009-07-23T11:52:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 hit ctrl-F2, that'll bring up a run box, type in gnome-terminal
2009-07-23T11:53:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	Nothing opened, however I tried running metacity in Ctrl Alt F1 and it said it was unable to start the window manager
2009-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 hitting ctrl-F2 didn't open a  little run box?
2009-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	Nope
2009-07-23T11:55:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	Normally it does but ever since this happened I can't get it to open
2009-07-23T11:55:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 it should. i am not sure and I have to get to bed now. sorry to all.
2009-07-23T11:56:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	Okay thanks for your help
2009-07-23T11:58:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 one last suggestion would be to restart your machine. gotta go now.
2009-07-23T11:58:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	I tried that and it didn't work
2009-07-23T12:00:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 wait, did you try ctrl-alt-F7, that should take you to the gui session. ctrl-alt-F1 thru F6 are just tty's consoles.
2009-07-23T12:01:00.000Z	Mike94287	mazda01__	ctrl alt f7 doesn't do anything
2009-07-23T12:09:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 you can't run metacity from tty1 bcause X isn't running on that console. you ahve to run metacity from tty7.
2009-07-23T12:10:00.000Z	mazda01__	Mike94287	 because you're most liekly already in tty7
