2008-11-24T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	Are you using 8.10 or 8.04 and if 8.10 did restricted manager offer to download firmware or was it simply enabling a driver?
2008-11-24T10:42:00.000Z	somethingclever	Jordan_U	im using 8.04, got it to say it was enabled (FINALLY) but it says not in use, i want it to be in us
2008-11-24T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter, if it is already installed make sure that it has downloaded and extracted the firmware by doing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure b43-fwcutter"
2008-11-24T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	You need to be connected to the internet for it to download the firmware ( it's not in the .deb file for legal reasons )
2008-11-24T10:49:00.000Z	somethingclever	Jordan_U	TY!!!
2008-11-24T10:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	np :)
2008-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	somethingclever	Jordan_U	it says Broadcom STA Wireless driver , enabled, but OT in use
2008-11-24T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	Try running "sudo modprobe b43"
2008-11-24T10:55:00.000Z	somethingclever	Jordan_U	that did nothing
2008-11-24T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	np, it will probably work without manually running modprobe from now on, if not then add "b43" to /etc/modules
2008-11-24T10:58:00.000Z	somethingclever	Jordan_U	should i add it to be safe?
2008-11-24T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	somethingclever	I wouldn't
