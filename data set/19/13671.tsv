2005-02-14T17:25:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	what are you trying to do?
2005-02-14T17:25:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	To get SSH running (so I can connect from remote locations)
2005-02-14T17:26:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	apt-get openssh-server
2005-02-14T17:27:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	I did; still can't connect from rmote locations
2005-02-14T17:27:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	/etc/init.d/ssh restart
2005-02-14T17:27:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	I did reboot the machine too
2005-02-14T17:28:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	ssh -vvv yourbox
2005-02-14T17:29:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	where is it stopping?
2005-02-14T17:30:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	Not stopping; the install went fine both times
2005-02-14T17:30:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	ssh -vvv yourbox
2005-02-14T17:30:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	where is it stopping?
2005-02-14T17:30:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	I just wasn't able to connect via SSH after installing openssh
2005-02-14T17:31:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	if you're running ssh in debug mode you can't see any output at all?
2005-02-14T17:33:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	why are you reluctant to ssh in debug mode?
2005-02-14T17:33:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	I would, but the machine is busy mid-install of Ubuntu
2005-02-14T17:39:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	hoary does
2005-02-14T06:01:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	then onto ssh-agent
2005-02-14T06:04:00.000Z	jpwain	snowblink	I see there's an app for OS X (which I'm using here) called SSH Agent that appears to manage ssh-keys and such. Is that what you meant?
2005-02-14T06:05:00.000Z	snowblink	jpwain	dunno on mac os x
