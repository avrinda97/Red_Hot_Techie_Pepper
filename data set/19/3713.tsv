2009-06-06T06:11:00.000Z	TomTommy		im using a Logitech USB HEADSET. I can hear ok, but it seems my headset microphone doesnt get picked up. What can I do>
2009-06-06T06:11:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	make sure it isn't muted
2009-06-06T06:12:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	where do I check that?
2009-06-06T06:12:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	volume control
2009-06-06T06:13:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	not muted.. still no microphone.. surely this is basic needs Ubuntu needs to address :(
2009-06-06T06:15:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	run something like sound recorder
2009-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	it picks up my voice, but when I play back, its delayed, pauses every 1 second in my microphone
2009-06-06T06:29:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	Your x-lite settings are wrong.  x-lite is a PITA to configure
2009-06-06T06:30:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	x-lite is a PITA to configure in Windows too
2009-06-06T06:32:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	no way!! I got x-lite working in Vista in 1 mins
2009-06-06T07:11:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	Try listening to people when they give you answers.  You need to configure it properly.
2009-06-06T07:11:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	its configured... but it says "firewall blocked...."
2009-06-06T07:17:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	/whois me - consider how many times I've configured x-lite.  When I tell you your configuration is wrong, there is a reason for it.
2009-06-06T07:20:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	If you would listen to what I am telling you, you can avoid this whole mess.  It is NOT an Ubuntu firewall issue.
2009-06-06T07:21:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	why then does it give me messages about firewall block?
2009-06-06T07:22:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	You are behind NAT.  I've said this twice now.  I'm done though.
2009-06-06T07:22:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	no im not.. I dont have a NAT modem.. in fact Im using a wireless USB stick modem.. NO NAT
2009-06-06T07:23:00.000Z	TomTommy	Qwell	ive tried to tell you this twice now
2009-06-06T07:23:00.000Z	Qwell	TomTommy	yvonne, who has never used Linux got wireless working in 1/10th the time you've been here.  Think about that.
