2009-06-03T09:50:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		Does anyone know why Starcraft/My Monitor is doing that and how to fix it?
2009-06-03T09:51:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		I am running it with Wine.
2009-06-03T09:52:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		nvidia
2009-06-03T09:53:00.000Z	Orest	PuzzledPenguin	does your monitor support 640x480? that's what starcraft is running at.
2009-06-03T09:53:00.000Z	Orest		i'm pretty sure yes
2009-06-03T09:53:00.000Z	Orest		well it is very old :)
2009-06-03T09:54:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		I can change the resolution to 640x480, but my monitor will say Input Singal out of range; Recommended Settings blah blah
2009-06-03T09:54:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		It even does that when I try to play Counter Strike at 640x480.
2009-06-03T09:55:00.000Z	Orest		I think you're monitor might not support it then.
2009-06-03T09:55:00.000Z	Orest		You can still play starcraft in a window if you use a virtual desktop in wine.
2009-06-03T09:55:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		I can change the resolution to that, but it looks like crap and has that annoying box still.
2009-06-03T09:55:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		Sorry, I am not very good with computers.
2009-06-03T09:57:00.000Z	Orest	PuzzledPenguin	do you mean you can run it at a higher resolution but with a large area of the screen simply black?
2009-06-03T09:58:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		No, whenever I change my resolution to anything other than 1024x768 it "Auto Refreshes" and sometimes will say "Input Singal out of range; rec. settings 1024x768 60hz."
2009-06-03T09:59:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		If I change my screen res to 640x480 that annoying box pops up and says that but will disappear and everything will be all pushed together, and even when I start SC is will keep the box there saying that until I exit.
2009-06-03T10:00:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		How do I reduce colors?
2009-06-03T10:02:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin	darlek	How do I reduce colors?
2009-06-03T10:02:00.000Z	PuzzledPenguin		Okay
2009-06-03T10:02:00.000Z	Orest	PuzzledPenguin	in any case you should check the winehq site for starcraft: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=149
