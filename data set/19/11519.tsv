2011-05-06T14:50:00.000Z	mateusz		I would like to have old gnome 2.32 desktop
2011-05-06T14:50:00.000Z	beli	mateusz	so define that you want to use gnome2 on login screen
2011-05-06T14:50:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	oh.. am I not using gnome2?
2011-05-06T14:50:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	I thought it is still gnome2
2011-05-06T14:51:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	I did not install gnome3 just upgraded to 11.04 Ubuntu
2011-05-06T14:51:00.000Z	beli	mateusz	11.04 is using unity
2011-05-06T14:51:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	ok thanks... this compositing things are slow and annoying
2011-05-06T14:51:00.000Z	beli	mateusz	define "eye-candy-stuff"....... :) ther are many new things with 11.04
2011-05-06T14:52:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	yeah the compositing, shadows, slow but eye-candy transparent alt+tab
2011-05-06T14:52:00.000Z	beli	mateusz	System>preferences>appearance>"Visual Effects" Select no effects.
2011-05-06T14:52:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	where to find it in unity ?
2011-05-06T14:53:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	no such a thing there, just theme,background,fonts
2011-05-06T14:53:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	that's all
2011-05-06T14:53:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	or is it not available for unity?
2011-05-06T14:54:00.000Z	mateusz	beli	ok I am going to switch to gnome2 this is too slow and reminds me gnome3 horror... a desktop completly not usable for work
