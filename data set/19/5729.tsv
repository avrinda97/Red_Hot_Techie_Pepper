2010-03-05T06:50:00.000Z	Izinucs		Can the region a dvd player is set to use be changed?
2010-03-05T06:50:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 it can yes
2010-03-05T06:50:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 hold on
2010-03-05T06:50:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	thanks.. holding :)
2010-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 in terminal type     regionset
2010-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	is that also a way of checking what it's set for?
2010-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 ah not sure I havent used that for some time now
2010-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 but let me check hold on
2010-03-05T06:52:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 not sure about that ...cant seem to find anyting regarding check region set
2010-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 which region do you need?
2010-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	well for various reasons I think that my dvd drive region has been "reset" to something other than the U.S... with libdvdcss2 installed I still can't play dvd's and it won't mount blank dvd's but will cd's..
2010-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 which media player?
2010-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	doesn't matter.. mostly with k3b trying to burn and almost any player you can think of I've thrown at it.
2010-03-05T06:56:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	so does regionset simply prompt you for the region you want to set? or does it tell you what it's set for now before making a change?
2010-03-05T06:57:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 as I recal it prompts for you to set  dvd region
2010-03-05T06:57:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	  I believe you have three attempts  but I am not sure it actually resets  the dvd chip
2010-03-05T06:58:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	I tried it and without a cd/dvd in the drive it error's out.. I guess it looks at the dvd and determins what the dvd is set for.
2010-08-20T07:38:00.000Z	Izinucs	coz_	that's the wrong way to do it anyway
2010-08-20T07:39:00.000Z	coz_	Izinucs	 mm always worked for me  but  fine   I wont bring it up in the future
