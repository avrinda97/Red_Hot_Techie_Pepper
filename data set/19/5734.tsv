2008-05-10T01:13:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	probably a raid/scsi bios
2008-05-10T01:18:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	so can my bios problem be fixed? it use to be setup for raid but it isn't any longer... what would be your suggestion
2008-05-10T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	what bios problem ? I don't see a bios problem
2008-05-10T01:19:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	the one that says its not installed
2008-05-10T01:20:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	ok well its causing one "emifreq-applet, action "start" failed."
2008-05-10T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	what is the error ?
2008-05-10T01:21:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	you said it could be a raid/scsi bios causing it to tell me that it isn't installed
2008-05-10T01:22:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	my error is here: http://pastebin.com/m7f8e805f
2008-05-10T01:22:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	no, I said thats what the warning was telling you about
2008-05-10T01:23:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	thats nothing to do with your raid controller bios
2008-05-10T01:24:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	i know that; its CPU frequency. I need to get into my bios to see if scaling is enabled
2008-05-10T01:24:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	ok, so press F2 or F12 on boot up, what ever your bios key is
2008-05-10T01:24:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	it tells me its not installed
2008-05-10T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	no it doesn't thats your raid controller bios
2008-05-10T01:26:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	BIOS not installed.
2008-05-10T01:26:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	I read that, and I've answered it, that is your raid controller bios, and it's not installed because you are not using raid - thats a good thing
2008-05-10T01:27:00.000Z	blo0dBeast	ikonia	that doesnt answer anything really... :)
2008-05-10T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	blo0dBeast	yes it does
