2007-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	haxx0r		need help
2007-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	haxx0r		get a blank screen with my geforce 6800
2007-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	Define blank... and when does this happen?
2007-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	i installed nvidia-glx[-new] , ran nvidia-xconfig, startx prints no error and then the screen is blank/black
2007-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	What card do you have?
2007-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	a geforce 6800 gt chipset, i can't tell the manufacturer, sorry
2007-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	Have you tried Ctrl-Alt-Backspace when it goes blank?  Is the entire system locked up, or just no video?
2007-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	locked up...nothing would happen
2007-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	You running Feisty?
2007-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	i am
2007-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	Okay, try completely removing all the nvidia packages you installed.
2007-06-29T12:22:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	Then reboot the computer.  When you get into Gnome, enable the desktop effects... it should automatically download, install, and configure the proper drivers for your card.
2007-06-29T12:22:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	Works wonders for most people that do it that way.
2007-06-29T12:23:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	shall i remove the nvidia-kernel-module-files, too?
2007-06-29T12:23:00.000Z	TheCreationist	haxx0r	Did you install them?  If so, then I would say yes.
2007-06-29T12:24:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	i'll try...thanks - see you in a minute (or two ;)
2007-06-29T12:44:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	same result
2007-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	haxx0r	TheCreationist	it works - added nvagp options to xorg.conf
