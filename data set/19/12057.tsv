2008-04-05T16:22:00.000Z	coachz		hi,  with these apps like parallels or vmware (or something else),  is there a way to have my computer boot up with both XP AND Ubunto loaded automatically and toggle between them without me having to open a dialog box each time and start up the "2nd" OS everytime I boot up?

2008-04-05T16:25:00.000Z	coachz	gogeta	and what happens during boot up, both OS's get loaded at the same time ?
2008-04-05T16:25:00.000Z	gogeta	coachz	vmware can then boot lets say the xp partation from linux your using both your real installs vs a image
