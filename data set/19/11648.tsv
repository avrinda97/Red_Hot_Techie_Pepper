2005-12-15T09:07:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	hm i was getting "cannot remaining packages to disk" and now i'm rewriting the cd at 16x, is that ok?
2005-12-15T09:08:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	is your iso image correct? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Verify
2005-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	are you running linux or windows?
2005-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	what do you mean if it is correct... i downloaded i today ;] 
2005-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	visit the URL i sent you please
2005-12-15T09:10:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	i did and it says This page does not exist yet.
2005-12-15T09:10:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	Kujila: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto
2005-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	um.. i can't manage ;]  would you explain me how to verify the iso
2005-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	the verify page wasnt helpful?
2005-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	get this console app from here and follow the steps on the wiki http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/
2005-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	right, thanks i'll try that now
2005-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	i still didn't manage to follow those steps, but i downloaded the files and this is what i get when i drag n drop the iso over the md5: ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso              100% 126751a2dc5528c2f9044d9e4ee36d61
2005-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	so visit the download page where you got the iso, click on "mdgsums" and compare
2005-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	my download manager downloaded the file from manny mirrors at once, so what i do
2005-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	:) i finally did it. it is correct
2005-12-15T09:33:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	now burn it as slowly as you can, not using Disk Utility
2005-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	i already burned another cd at 16x (.. i could 8 but didn't want to wait) with nero6 (=disk utility?)
2005-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	nalioth	dido`	then go for it, but we've seen a lot of problems with higher-speed iso burning
2005-12-15T09:36:00.000Z	dido`	nalioth	k:) i'l try to install it again.. thanks for the help ;]
