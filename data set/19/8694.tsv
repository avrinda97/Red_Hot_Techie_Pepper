2007-02-23T16:53:00.000Z	SamePaulNB		Why I can't see wlan0 even if driver loaded?
2007-02-23T16:53:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	see it? with ifconfig -a?
2007-02-23T16:54:00.000Z	SamePaulNB	mwe	No! Just with lsmod
2007-02-23T16:54:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	lsmod doesnt show interfaces
2007-02-23T16:54:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	only loaded drivers
2007-02-23T16:54:00.000Z	SamePaulNB	mwe	I know. But previously I didn't have even this :)
2007-02-23T16:54:00.000Z	mwe		have what?
2007-02-23T16:55:00.000Z	SamePaulNB	mwe	driver
2007-02-23T16:55:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	and now it's loaded?
2007-02-23T16:55:00.000Z	SamePaulNB	mwe	At least lsmod shows it
2007-02-23T16:55:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	then ifconfig -a and iwconfig
2007-02-23T16:55:00.000Z	mwe		see if it shows
2007-02-23T16:56:00.000Z	SamePaulNB	mwe	they don't. ifconfig does not list and iwconfig can't see wireless extension
2007-02-23T16:56:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	then something went wrong. wrong driver maybe
2007-02-23T16:57:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	check dmesg and /var/log/syslog
2007-02-23T16:57:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	what driver/card are you using?
2007-02-23T16:58:00.000Z	mwe		I've got a 40GB drive dedicated for linux. only about 7GB is used
2007-02-23T16:59:00.000Z	mwe		I have 1GB of ram and 1GB of swap. no swap is ever used
2007-02-23T16:59:00.000Z	mwe	SamePaulNB	what driver?
