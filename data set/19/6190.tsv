2008-03-01T00:08:00.000Z	hischild		any chance that there is someone who can help me get me my tv output working? currently i've tried to use twinview and a seperate X, yet they either don't work (blank screen) or black and white (twinview) ...
2008-03-01T00:09:00.000Z	hischild		master_o1_master, thank you :-)
2008-03-01T00:09:00.000Z	hischild		my bad :p
2008-03-01T00:09:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	black and white probably works except for some NTSC-PAL issue or Component/s-video output issue
2008-03-01T00:10:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	that sentence didn't make much sense... but you're probably only missing some option with twinview
2008-03-01T00:36:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	did you try this option in Device    Option          "TVOutFormat" "Composite" #or SVIDEO etc
2008-03-01T00:37:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	are you connected with composite?
2008-03-01T00:38:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	one RCA cable (often uses a s-video to rca adapter)
2008-03-01T00:41:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	i don't know what a SCART plug is...
2008-03-01T00:42:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	try the s-video option instead of composite maybe?
2008-03-01T00:42:00.000Z	hischild	frank232	one of those wide plugs for your tv ... the same thing you can connect a video or a dvd player with (just noticed... you have an extra 2 behind your name ... sorry for mistyping)
2008-03-01T00:42:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	I just checked what SCART is and it's only popular in Europe ;)
2008-03-01T00:43:00.000Z	hischild	frank232	yeah .. i was afraid of such a thing ... yet my tv only supports SCART :(
2008-03-01T00:45:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	did you try the s-video instead of composite in your xorg.conf
2008-03-01T00:46:00.000Z	hischild	frank232	i think i did that in the first place ... let me check without it
2008-03-01T00:47:00.000Z	hischild	frank232	unfortunately still a no :(
2008-03-01T00:48:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	I don't know... maybe there are Europeans here who would have a better idea
2008-03-01T00:49:00.000Z	hischild	frank232	still thanks :-)
2008-03-01T00:49:00.000Z	frank232	hischild	np
