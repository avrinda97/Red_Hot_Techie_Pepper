2007-12-10T23:36:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	native?
2007-12-10T23:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	whats your question?
2007-12-10T23:35:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	Im trying to make it so that my program within WINE can see the files I want it to play (in this case.. using CCCP in WINE, when browsing to open video file, it doesn't see them)
2007-12-10T23:35:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	tryed using the configuration manual on how to and evidently I failed
2007-12-10T23:35:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	why are you using wine for it? use a native linux video player
2007-12-10T23:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	like totem, or xine, or mplayer, or vlc
2007-12-10T23:37:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	Ive bashed my head trying to use totem for the past 2 days... don't like VLC and it cant render soft subs worth crap.. mplayer is giving me issues
2007-12-10T23:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	well you will have more problems trying to run videos through wine than to fix the problems with your players
2007-12-10T23:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	seen those links yet?
2007-12-10T23:39:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	Im new to linux.. Ive used CCCP for years. it's the best out there for windows.. I know how to work it >>
2007-12-10T23:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	yea but its not a linux program, so its probably not going to be the best solution
2007-12-10T23:40:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	I want 1 player to play everything.. mplayer isnt good for .mkv's and ogm's and vlc isnt good for soft subs...
2007-12-10T23:41:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	to each his own, but like i said its going to be ugly to try and run your defautl media player through wine...icky i would never try and do it lol
2007-12-10T23:42:00.000Z	kuropon	MasterShrek_	than what is the purpose of WINE? >>
2007-12-10T23:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	kuropon	for programs that you have no other option to run but under windows api, i woudlnt use it for day-to-day tasks, although it may work, its not really the best way to do it
