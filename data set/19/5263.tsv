2009-01-12T15:15:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		while using apache is /var/www the only place to put webfiles .... can inidvidual users have their own directory ?
2009-01-12T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	Yeah, ~/public_html/
2009-01-12T15:18:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	how will it be accessed from the browser ?
2009-01-12T15:18:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	http://localhost/~username/
2009-01-12T15:20:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	i created a public_html folder in my home folder and put an html file but browser says 404 not found
2009-01-12T15:21:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	Alright, do this: sudo a2enmod userdir && sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2009-01-12T15:21:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	Also, chmod a+x ~/public_html, and also chmod +r the html file
2009-01-12T15:22:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	enabling the module worked fine
2009-01-12T15:22:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	thanks
2009-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	Looks ... sort of like DejaVu Sans?
2009-03-22T09:39:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	no .. that is too light
2009-03-22T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	or Bitstream Vera Sans
2009-03-22T09:41:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	bitstream vera sans resembles this one ... but not perfectly this
2009-08-19T10:12:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	"GB" is 1 billion bytes when concerned with harddrives.
2011-06-07T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	Yeah, you can install "around" a home partition
2011-06-07T11:46:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	I have 2 ext4 partitions , on 1 I have ubuntu 9.10 and on 2 I have backup data , I will install ubuntu 11.04 on partition 1 and want to put /home on partition 2 , so would the existing data on partition 2 be ok ?
2012-01-27T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	silv3r_m00n	It already does remember the password for a little.  I think the default is 15 minutes.
2012-01-27T11:42:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Flannel	I have an entry in the kde menu which is gksudo app , it asks for password everytime
