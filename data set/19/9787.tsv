2009-04-26T01:06:00.000Z	python_user		kubuntu jaunty doesn't show any hardware or common control panel style options.. any idea why? was this a design decision?
2009-04-26T01:06:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	start panel > applications > system
2009-04-26T01:07:00.000Z	python_user	Skapare	yeah, theres nothing there like "mouse and keyboard settings"
2009-04-26T01:07:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	I found hardware drivers there ... guess you gotta look around ... different concepts than gnome
2009-04-26T01:07:00.000Z	python_user	Skapare	I'm not looking for drivers
2009-04-26T01:07:00.000Z	python_user		I wanna config the mouse
2009-04-26T01:07:00.000Z	python_user		and a few other things
2009-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	python_user		they should be in the "systems settings" like the screenshots show, but I have nothing.. or very little
2009-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	there were some other things I saw labeled preferences and administration (didn't find drivers there so I moved on)
2009-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	maybe mouse stuff is in those
2009-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	python_user	Skapare	I've looked for over 2 hours now, I seriously cant find anything
2009-04-26T01:09:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	*shrug* ... maybe #kde knows
2009-04-26T01:09:00.000Z	python_user		this is really bad from an end users perspective, when I find them I'm gonna submit a patch to kde to get this fixed
2009-04-26T01:09:00.000Z	python_user	Skapare	lol, #kde didnt know
2009-04-26T01:10:00.000Z	python_user		This looks like some ubuntu design decision to me
2009-04-26T01:10:00.000Z	python_user		no one has any clue
2009-04-26T01:10:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	well, unfortunately, I don't (yet) since I didn't need to configure mouse ... and I'm going back to gnome because konqueror is borked
2009-04-26T01:10:00.000Z	python_user	Skapare	also trying to find where to change to double click for icons
2009-04-26T01:11:00.000Z	Skapare	python_user	no idea, sorry
