2007-06-24T07:15:00.000Z	raintree		Help please :(  I'm new to Ubuntu and i'm having a horrible time setting up wireless.  Whenever I try to launch ndisgtk it quits after briefly showign the window for about 1 second, then it shuts down.  It used to work.  I think i may have selected the wrong driver or something... any ideas? :(
