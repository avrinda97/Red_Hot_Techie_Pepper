2011-08-22T23:27:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	Yes sir. The promt '$' shows that to you.
2011-08-22T23:27:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	I beg your pardon?
2011-08-22T23:30:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	'~$ sudo service mysql start; start: Job is already running: mysql.' --  Is this all right?
2011-08-22T23:48:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	Thank you very much for your help.
2011-08-22T23:57:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	Hopefully not that evil. But please investigate on that.
2011-08-23T15:10:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	why do you need to kill it ? a zombie process is basically already dead
2011-08-23T15:04:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	you can't kill a zombie process, unless you kill its parent (which is usually init, so no you can't kill it...)
2011-08-23T15:08:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	'~$ pstree' tells me that the parent process of tilda is not init but gnome-session.
2011-08-23T15:08:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	then that process will die when gdm session ends, if you really need to kill it, restart gdm
2011-08-23T15:09:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	I meant gnome session
2011-08-23T15:09:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	so you would just have to log out and back in
2011-08-23T15:09:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	I wished to kill this one tilda zombie process but not to kill another running tilda process.
2011-08-23T15:17:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	There is somthing wrong with my Tilda. Tilda is sometimes stubborn and somtimes it crashes. I have not yet found out what is wrong with my configuration. --  Tilda works ok on antoher test user account.
2011-08-23T15:19:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	well I'm not familiar with tilda so I won't be able to help you on that, but still is there a particular reason you want to kill that process ? (which as I said you won't be able to do anyway without restarting gnome-session)
2011-08-23T15:24:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	I'd like to kill it for analytical purposes only.
2011-08-23T15:25:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	then you got your answer :)
2011-08-23T15:25:00.000Z	bullgard4_	glebihan	Right. --  Thank you.
2011-08-23T15:25:00.000Z	glebihan	bullgard4_	you're welcome
