2005-11-21T14:43:00.000Z	zxsykco		I'd have it all squared away if hotplug, etc, didn't notice the i810 driver onboard.. I've though about removing it from the kernel. But damn I'm lazy and am hoping for a work around.
2005-11-21T14:44:00.000Z	zxsykco		blacklist?
2005-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	zxsykco		Hmmmn, that would work perfectly, I'd gather.
2005-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	zxsykco		man hotplug?
2005-11-21T14:46:00.000Z	zxsykco		Well, I can go into CLI with the ati I can't start the xserver.
2005-11-21T14:46:00.000Z	zxsykco		If I had an xorgconfig that would do, as I could specify which driver for the xserver to use.
2005-11-21T14:47:00.000Z	zxsykco		Or if I knew the proper crap to change I could edit xorg.conf manually, but I don't know the names.
2005-11-21T14:48:00.000Z	zxsykco		Does anyone remember the old xf86config and Xorgconfig? Does ubuntu have any equivalent?
2005-11-21T14:48:00.000Z	zxsykco		Something that walks you through generating an xorg.conf file?
2005-11-21T14:49:00.000Z	zxsykco		Yes.
2005-11-21T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	zxsykco	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

2005-11-21T14:50:00.000Z	zxsykco	rob_p	I am trying to get my ati radeon working with xorg.
2005-11-21T14:50:00.000Z	zxsykco		And I have an onboard i810 that gets in the way of the autmagic conf generatin.
2005-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	zxsykco		No not yet.
2005-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	zxsykco		Should it?
