2011-01-31T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	then its a hardware issue, as grub is not even loaded at that point
2011-01-31T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	use your backups to work on another system (if you have access to one)
2011-01-31T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	why not, isn't the data important/
2011-01-31T21:12:00.000Z	farooki	ActionParsnip	its not imp after thursday
2011-01-31T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	people will learn the hard way about backups
2011-01-31T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	you can boot to USB and get a desktop that way
2011-01-31T21:14:00.000Z	farooki	ActionParsnip	no i cant boot at all, i tried inserting bootable cds etc, none worked. it jut hangs at this screen http://pickledpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hp_splash1.jpg and its the first screen that comes up when u iht power button
2011-01-31T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	if it doesn't boot at all I suggest you ask in ##hardware
2011-01-31T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farooki	its not an ubuntu issue
