2011-03-26T05:59:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		hey guys, how to i install a game from a .run?
2011-03-26T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 you 'run' the  file by making it an executable...
2011-03-26T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		!backup | abahkaiyisah
2011-03-26T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 chmod +x foo.run, then ./foo.rin
2011-03-26T06:03:00.000Z	sgt_hagger	Dr_Willis	i made it executable and clicked it and says veryfing integrity then uncompressing installer
2011-03-26T06:03:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		then return to exit
2011-03-26T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 use teh command line.. not double clicking.. look for error messages
2011-03-26T06:06:00.000Z	sgt_hagger	Dr_Willis	 just says uncompressing then all good?
2011-03-26T06:09:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		?
2011-03-26T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 did it make somtning when it uncompressed?
2011-03-26T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 theres a reason you dont see .run or other 'self installing executables  for programs' :) theres just to many things to go wrong and they can get broken easially with new versions of linux..
2011-03-26T06:15:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		whats the alternative with linux?
2011-03-26T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		!apt
2011-03-26T06:15:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		ah right
2011-03-26T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 with UBUNTu - the apt package manager system is the way to 'do things'  related to installing/removeing software
2011-03-26T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 what game do you have that even came as a .run  file?
2011-03-26T06:16:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		just a python game, i am learning python and wanted to see what it can make
2011-03-26T06:17:00.000Z	sgt_hagger		seems i cant though :)
2011-03-26T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sgt_hagger	 in that case check the .run file and see what its doing.. see if it extracted some files to some dir...
