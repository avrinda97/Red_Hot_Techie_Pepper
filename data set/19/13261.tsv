2005-05-24T07:47:00.000Z	klaas		Clarki: Then it's not.
2005-05-24T07:47:00.000Z	klaas		Clarki: Can you go to http://localhost:631

2005-05-24T07:51:00.000Z	klaas		Clarki: If i understand correctly the printer is connected to the ubuntu machine, and you want to connect wit xp.. right?

2005-05-24T07:52:00.000Z	Seveas	klaas	because it is better to avoid having a root password
2005-05-24T07:54:00.000Z	Seveas	klaas	read RootSudo on the wiki
2005-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	klaas	Seveas	There's a couple of really good points, however I prefer to enable the root account anyway (partly because I use kerberos authentication with an ldap backend for normal users).  I definitely agree that users should _NEVER_ login with X as root.
2005-05-24T08:01:00.000Z	Seveas	klaas	ok, but the ubuntu way is sudo, so please try to avoid using a root account when explaining things to newbies if it can be done otherwise.
2005-05-24T08:02:00.000Z	klaas	Seveas	Allright, I will ;-)
2005-05-24T08:05:00.000Z	Seveas	klaas	thnx!
