2005-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	ifZZ	soundray	Well.. it is real? :D
2005-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	soundray	ifZZ	that modem driver is commercial, closed software. Ubuntu people cannot support it.
2005-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	ifZZ	soundray	stop! but it is work with 14/4 for free :)
2005-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	soundray	ifZZ	this is all you're going to get from me, sorry.
2005-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	ifZZ	soundray	okey, thx :)

2005-12-24T07:30:00.000Z	ifZZ	soundray	U know it is unreal ;)
2005-12-24T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	ifZZ	if you have a problem with Ubuntu, ask here. If you have a problem with commercial software, ask the vendor of that software.
