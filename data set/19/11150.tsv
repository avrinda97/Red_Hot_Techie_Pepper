2008-01-03T10:33:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey what do u mean
2008-01-03T10:35:00.000Z	zero88		purpzey ah ok i know what you are saying. yes i will do that. solid_liquid will do, thanks for the link
2008-01-03T10:37:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	read it?  how do you mean?
2008-01-03T10:37:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	well ive tried gedit /bin/ls but it says something about the coddec
2008-01-03T10:37:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	for the code, you'll have to get the source package
2008-01-03T10:38:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	that's compiled C code, so it's machine code
2008-01-03T10:38:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	ahhh
2008-01-03T10:38:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	so you'll have to get the C source code...  try     apt-get source coreutils
2008-01-03T10:38:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	ok, well if I made a bash script and put it in bin, and named it lsp, would simply typing lsp in terminal also work?
2008-01-03T10:39:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	yeah, except you'd first have to do:     chmod +x /bin/ls
2008-01-03T10:39:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	ok sweet thanks alot
2008-01-03T10:39:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	that sets the execute bit, so that linux will recognize it as being a file it can execute somehow
2008-01-03T10:39:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	and you may have to ensure the permissions are correct
2008-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	ok
2008-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	so:    ls -l /bin/ls*
2008-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	and make the permissions of lsp match those of ls
2008-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	man chmod      and       man chgrp      to learn about that
2008-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	zero88	solid_liquid	ok
2008-01-03T10:41:00.000Z	solid_liq	zero88	or maybe a google for "linux file permissions" may give you something easier to read
