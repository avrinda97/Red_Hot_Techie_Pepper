2005-04-04T07:21:00.000Z	fangorious		hrm .. "failed to initialize HAL"
2005-04-04T07:21:00.000Z	fangorious		C loaded means X loaded
2005-04-04T07:23:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	what's your problem with i810?
2005-04-04T07:23:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	oh
2005-04-04T07:24:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	what resolution are you running at?
2005-04-04T07:24:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	daniels 1024x768, 24 bpp
2005-04-04T07:25:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	try editing xorg.conf and adding the following two lines:
2005-04-04T07:26:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	those go in the Display section
2005-04-04T07:26:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	if it doesn't work, try bumping the 52 in HorizSync down to 51 or up to 53
2005-04-04T07:28:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	I asked about bootsplash. ;)
2005-04-04T07:29:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	yes, but I'm trying to solve your X problem as well without needing to use vesa
2005-04-04T07:29:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	the Display subsection of the Screen section?
2005-04-04T07:29:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	(i'm the xorg maintainer, and would rather like it if it worked out of the box everywhere)
2005-04-04T07:30:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	actually, the top-level Monitor section, sorry
2005-04-04T07:30:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	looks like it's working
2005-04-04T07:32:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	is there a gui xorg.conf config tool (other than gvim)?
2005-04-04T07:32:00.000Z	daniels	fangorious	not really, sorry
2005-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	no big deal, if it's working it's working
2005-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	fangorious	daniels	any hint why the i915 kernel module loaded instead of the i830 module? you think that might explain the problem?
