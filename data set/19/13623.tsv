2005-07-28T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	the same reason that it does not 'just work' in sarge
2005-07-28T13:33:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	well, I suppose I should have said Woody, but yeah, it's easy
2005-07-28T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	:-) perhaps, but there is a situation where one should have some understanding why something is not 'free' in the RMS sense, after all there are those that would love to make the ownership of Linux illegal, look at the patents thing for one, the mpg encumberment, if nothing else that comes to the fore, at that point can choose to think in a political way or not, but if it just works then they do not have a chance
2005-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	oh, WAV is unfree?  funny, i never heard that before
2005-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	hey, if there were some sensible reason for it not to work I wouldn't be so peissed that it doens't  :-)
2005-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	apt-get install oggdec might help
2005-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	yeah, i guess it's time to start trying one thing s, then another...
2005-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	I typically go for all the oggvorbis stuff to start
2005-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	ogg is useless to me, I'm afraid
2005-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	that codec does wav
2005-07-28T13:40:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	codec, check.  what interface works with it?
2005-07-28T13:40:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	totem should pick it up with little or no prompting
2005-07-28T13:41:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	if it does it will be the first time totem has done anything right for me.  BTW, aptitude finds nothing matching oggdec.  any idea what it's called?
2005-07-28T13:42:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	heck, never though of throwing totem at it - it says there "movie player"
2005-07-28T13:42:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	I listens to lots of stuff with precious totem :)
2005-07-28T13:43:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	np
2005-08-06T11:52:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	you could look at animation as a setting, I believe it to be the route of removing the effect about which you type
2005-08-06T11:52:00.000Z	maney	ompaul	where would I find that?  if I'd seen anything labeled "animation" I'd have been all over it
2005-08-06T11:58:00.000Z	ompaul	maney	I am looking for it, I found something that aluded to that a while ago
