2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		heh
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		what about patching it for ubuntu?
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		actually
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		what about using the feisty .20
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		right
2007-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	starz		do you have dns setup in ipv6 nanothief?
2007-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	nanothief	starz	what do you mean by that?
2007-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	starz	nanothief	it still needs something to translate the google.com >>> ipv6
2007-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	nanothief	starz	I'm confused. I though you could completely disable ipv6 so that google.com >>> ipv4 always
2007-02-15T15:05:00.000Z	starz	nanothief	your trying to get ipv4 to work
2007-02-15T15:06:00.000Z	nanothief	starz	no ipv4 always works perfect, ipv6 never works, my network doesn't support ipv6, and I want to completely destroy ipv6
2007-02-15T15:06:00.000Z	nanothief	starz	I've been to that link and many others but they don't work :(
2007-02-15T15:07:00.000Z	starz	nanothief	how did it get activated in the first place?
2007-02-15T15:07:00.000Z	nanothief	starz	It has always been active, internet doesn't even work with a ubuntu 6.10 live cd
2007-02-15T15:08:00.000Z	starz	nanothief	research your hardware from a sudo lspci -v > somefile.txt
