2007-09-16T14:07:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	 why did u put the drive on /media ?
2007-09-16T14:09:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	I made a typo.  That was suppose to say it is not in media.  What I meant was I added that line to my fstab file which I though would mount the drive and if that happened it would show up in the media folder.  That has now happened
2007-09-16T14:09:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	that has not happened
2007-09-16T14:10:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	Someone else told me to do that and I noticed my other hd and cdroms are listed in media
2007-09-16T14:11:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	but I don't care I would be happen to get it working
2007-09-16T14:11:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	ok .. no biggie i gather you see the drive, but jsut can't write to it
2007-09-16T14:13:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	try this... sudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME /media/mynewdrive
2007-09-16T14:13:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	I see the drive if I go to places>File system but If I double click on it it says "Cannot mount drive" before I added that line to /etc/fstab it said something like "the internal drive requires administrative password for security reasons please enter your password"
2007-09-16T14:13:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	sounds like just root can touch it, try that cmd
2007-09-16T14:15:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	that drive is not displayed in media.  I think that is the problem
2007-09-16T14:15:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	oh...
2007-09-16T14:15:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	what cmd again did u put in /etc/fstab?
2007-09-16T14:15:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	/dev/sda1 /media/OSnet vfat umask=000 0 0
2007-09-16T14:16:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	yes
2007-09-16T14:16:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	try this then... /dev/sda1    /media/mynewdrive   vfat    defaults     0        0
2007-09-16T14:17:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	okay I am going to reboot
2007-09-16T14:29:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	That didn't work either.  Now the drive is not showing up in Places>Computer
2007-09-16T14:29:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	maestrojed	i'm out of suggestions, my apologies
2007-09-16T14:30:00.000Z	maestrojed	Bossmanbeta	NP. Thank you for all your help
