2008-03-02T11:46:00.000Z	kittykitty		anyone have time to help me understand what i'm doing wrong?
2008-03-02T11:48:00.000Z	kittykitty		following instructions on "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router" whenever i start up the bridged network, i am unableto use any network (network unreachable)
2008-03-02T11:49:00.000Z	kittykitty		i've tried to set the default gateway manually by using the route command
2008-03-02T11:50:00.000Z	kittykitty		it still doesnt work, and even using dhclient messes it up when the bridge network is up
2008-03-02T11:51:00.000Z	kittykitty		ok, heres a question someone might beable to answer, why do i keep getting 192.168.0.1 in my resolv.conf when i use dhclient ?
2008-03-02T11:52:00.000Z	obfusco	kittykitty	probably from your router
2008-03-02T11:54:00.000Z	kittykitty		my router is 192.168.1.1, and it is passing the proper dns server and dhclient is sticking in the other ip for some un-known reason
2008-03-02T11:55:00.000Z	obfusco	kittykitty	pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file
2008-03-02T11:57:00.000Z	kittykitty		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58072/
2008-03-02T12:00:00.000Z	obfusco	kittykitty	might be as a result of the settings on eth0?  try making everything static, if that doesn't cause too much trouble
2008-03-02T12:01:00.000Z	kittykitty		if i just setup both networks, then bridge them using the brctl commands, it still breaks the networking
2008-03-02T12:01:00.000Z	obfusco	kittykitty	why bridging?
2008-03-02T12:01:00.000Z	kittykitty		cause i have other computers that arn't wireless and i'm borrowing internet from down the street
2008-03-02T12:02:00.000Z	obfusco	kittykitty	i would say it would be easier to use ssh as a socks proxy by using the -D option
2008-03-02T12:04:00.000Z	kittykitty		just setting up this box as a router from the wireless -> wired network, would be alot easier for the other people, so they don't have to do stupid "login" crap that they're to retarded to do anyways
2008-03-02T12:08:00.000Z	obfusco	kittykitty	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=111972 looks like the sort of thing you want
2008-03-02T12:10:00.000Z	obfusco		!ask | oiboy
2008-03-02T12:12:00.000Z	obfusco		!sudo | oiboy
2008-03-02T13:15:00.000Z	kittykitty	obfusco	thanks for the help, i finally got it working
