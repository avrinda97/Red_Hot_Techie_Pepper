2008-01-12T07:04:00.000Z	bltzfsck		been trying to make a lan with xp and vista work for a week.  loaded the ubuntu live cd on the xp machine and EVERYTHING WORKS out of the box
2008-01-12T07:05:00.000Z	bltzfsck		sheesh
2008-01-12T07:07:00.000Z	bltzfsck		havent used linux in a while, but i remember passing boot paramaters that gave me much smaller fonts in text mode
2008-01-12T07:07:00.000Z	bltzfsck		is there a way to pass that paramater to a live ubuntu cd?
2008-01-12T07:08:00.000Z	bltzfsck		i think it was vidmode or summat
2008-01-12T07:09:00.000Z	bltzfsck		can i put the boot stuff on a memory stick and make a free partition into the root partition?
2008-01-12T07:11:00.000Z	bltzfsck		instead of rearranging my whole boot sector on this windows machine, can i just make a usb memory stick the boot device, and mount a free partition from my h/d?
2008-01-12T07:12:00.000Z	bltzfsck		half my harddrive is an empty partition
2008-01-12T07:13:00.000Z	bltzfsck		how big a partition does a full install of ubuntu require?
2008-01-12T07:13:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	i wouldnt go smaller than 5gb
2008-01-12T07:14:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	4gb is plenty, especially if you want to run it off the thumb drive
2008-01-12T07:15:00.000Z	bltzfsck	mather	you in texas?
2008-01-12T07:16:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	yah, howd you guess
2008-01-12T07:17:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	do you want to run it off the thumb permanently? or just install it from the thumb?
2008-01-12T07:20:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	im confused with all the harddrive talk... you wanna run ubuntu from the thumb drive, so whats the harddrive got to do with it? or were you talking to someone else?
2008-01-12T07:21:00.000Z	bltzfsck	mather	not enuf room on a thumb drive for a good /
2008-01-12T07:21:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	either way, running from the thumb drive full time is practical if you plan on tinkering around with ubuntu once a week, imho
2008-01-12T07:22:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	IS practical if you dont plan on using it full time
2008-01-12T07:23:00.000Z	mather	bltzfsck	i have my ubuntu installation on 30GB of space, its about a year old and ive installed countless programs... still have 30% of drive left (that includes countless mp3s and videos etc)
