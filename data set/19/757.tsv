2011-09-08T08:34:00.000Z	crash1hd		Is there an easy way to remove all nvidia software on my ubuntu box (I upgraded the motherboard and the new video card is an ati so I no longer require the nvidia software)?
2011-09-08T08:34:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	you can probably search for nvidia and select the packages to remove either in the software center or synaptic
2011-09-08T08:36:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	hmm ok I was kinda hoping there was something shell based cause when I do the package manager it seems to ask me if I want to remove things like ubuntu-desktop? which I worry about not sure what that is?
2011-09-08T08:37:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	don't remove it if it says it is going to remove ubuntu-desktop. that is like everything. basically. not just the invidia packages.
2011-09-08T08:37:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	hold on a second and i'll see what i can do to answer your question.
2011-09-08T08:37:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	ok :) thanks
2011-09-08T08:38:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	did you install additional drivers in ubuntu or are you using the free ones?
2011-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	i don't believe you can remove the Nouveau package. you can remove the unified NVIDIA drivers though...
2011-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	ok
2011-09-08T08:44:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	maybe a better question is why do you want to remove these drivers?
2011-09-08T08:44:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	well I am no longer using an nvidia card
2011-09-08T08:45:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	and there is an option in the settings that makes reference to them
2011-09-08T08:45:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	i wouldn't worry about it if it isn't negatively impacting you.
2011-09-08T08:46:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	its not and i know I could just hide the menu item.  On that note when I do install the custom ati driver I get a warning about unsupported ati driver as a little image in the bottom right corner of the screen
2011-09-08T08:46:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	you can disable the driver if you want to do that.
2011-09-08T08:46:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	I have done that already (that removed the warning) and all seems to be working but I am not trying to do anything complicated either lol
2011-09-08T08:47:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	go to system -> administration -> additional drivers (10.04)
2011-09-08T08:47:00.000Z	axi93	crash1hd	i actually wanted to do what you are trying to do at one time to shrink the size of a ISO which contained a mini version of ubuntu. unfortunately the way things are packaged you just can't.
2011-09-08T08:48:00.000Z	crash1hd	axi93	ok :) makes sense the driver it wants me to use is the ATI/AMD prop.. FGLRX graphics driver
