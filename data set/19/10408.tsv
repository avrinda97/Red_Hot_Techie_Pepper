2006-06-16T12:35:00.000Z	rob138		if apt-get is taking a really long time to set up something(flashplugin), is there a way to check if it is actually doing anything or just froze?
2006-06-16T12:35:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	no new text on the screen?
2006-06-16T12:36:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	and why aren't you using synaptic?
2006-06-16T12:36:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	quickness
2006-06-16T12:38:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	it is doing the same thing in synaptic (preparing... in the gui, and setting up in the terminal portion)
2006-06-16T12:38:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	yeah, afaik Synaptic won't give you any more info than apt, it's just easier to use.
2006-06-16T12:39:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	is it possible it just takes a while to setup?
2006-06-16T12:39:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	yes, especially if you have a relatively under-powered machine.
2006-06-16T12:39:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	under-powered?
2006-06-16T12:40:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	relatively slow, not a lot of memory.
2006-06-16T12:40:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	3ghz and 1 g ram
2006-06-16T12:40:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	how long has it been taking?
2006-06-16T12:40:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	minutes...
2006-06-16T12:41:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	I'd just leave it alone (no serious stuff running) for ~10 minutes.
2006-06-16T12:41:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	if it won't be done by then... something's probably wrong.
2006-06-16T12:41:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	okay, cool
2006-06-16T12:44:00.000Z	rob138	omodo	so it finished... then i got a popup error: E: Not locked and that was it
2006-06-16T12:46:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	you might have tried/touched the files being updated.
2006-06-16T12:46:00.000Z	omodo	rob138	definitely if you tried doing the same thing with both Synaptic and APT simultenously.
