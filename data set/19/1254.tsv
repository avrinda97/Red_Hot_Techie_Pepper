2011-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	kerneloops_		Why do I need to run sudo alsamixer in Ubuntu Server via SSH????
2011-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	terry_	kerneloops_	The use is not in audio group probably
2011-03-25T05:10:00.000Z	kerneloops_	terry_	does that mean that I can't play audio files?
2011-03-25T05:10:00.000Z	terry_	kerneloops_	The use is probably not in audio group
2011-03-25T05:10:00.000Z	terry_	kerneloops_	Means you need to add that user to audio group.
2011-03-25T05:10:00.000Z	terry_	kerneloops_	vim /etc/group
2011-03-25T05:11:00.000Z	terry_	kerneloops_	And then log out and back in so that the new permissions take effect.
2011-03-25T05:11:00.000Z	kerneloops_	terry_	now what do I do?
2011-03-25T05:12:00.000Z	kerneloops_	terry_	it shows audio:x:29:pulse
2011-03-25T05:12:00.000Z	terry_	kerneloops_	Change to  audio:x:29:pulse,kerneloops
