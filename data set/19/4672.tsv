2008-11-24T17:58:00.000Z	gonzalo_		hello, maybe its a silly question, but how can i "downgrade" my kernel version.. i need to install the same kernel "kind" i have, but a different version. (i have 2.6.26 and i need 2.6.22 or 2.6.20)
2008-11-24T17:58:00.000Z	gonzalo_		i want to do that the "ubuntu" way
2008-11-24T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.22 (press tab here a few times)
2008-11-24T18:01:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	mm it doesn't do anything... maybe i doesn't have in my "packages list"
2008-11-24T18:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	what command did you run?
2008-11-24T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	you can type a partial package name and tab complete just like in here
2008-11-24T18:02:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	apt-get install linux-image-2.6.2 (tab tab)
2008-11-24T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	did any packages appear
2008-11-24T18:02:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	no..
2008-11-24T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	try: apt-cache search 2.6.20
2008-11-24T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	you can then install any of those packages useing sudo apt-get install
2008-11-24T18:04:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	there's only two packages ( linux-patch-xenomai  and iotop )
2008-11-24T18:04:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	i need to add some package source to my apt sources.list ? becouse i dont have other kernels..
2008-11-24T18:08:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	could you tell me how can i add more "packages" to my packages list?
2008-11-24T18:08:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	becouse i dont have that packages when i use apt
2008-11-24T18:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	the kernels are in the standard repos, if the repos ave removed the old ones you will need to find other repos which still have them
2008-11-24T18:12:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	yes you are right i must add an old "repo version" to my sources.list, then update the package list, install the old kernel image, and then remove the old repo from my list and do an update again
2008-11-24T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gonzalo_	sound like a plan
2008-11-24T18:19:00.000Z	gonzalo_	ActionParsnip	thanks!
