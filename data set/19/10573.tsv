2006-06-02T06:15:00.000Z	Nothus	r0bby	*grins* There's a "shouldn't" in there :-) I've managed to break most distros.. And then I'm one of these stubborn people who turns off gnome and uses FVWM, so it's going to hate me for that.. And I have an xterminal doing XDMCP to this desktop as well, I imagine it will blow that away..
