2005-09-01T16:34:00.000Z	dpowers		is there an unstable version that i should know about?
2005-09-01T16:34:00.000Z	dpowers		and a webpage that details some of that info?
2005-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	dpowers		right now, i have the community maintained universe updates
2005-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	dpowers		is that the most unstable?
2005-09-01T05:11:00.000Z	dpowers		hmm, i am having a problem with apt
2005-09-01T05:11:00.000Z	dpowers		when i try to do an update, it is telling that it can't update gaim, because gaim has a dependency on gaim-data that is not in my apt database
2005-09-01T05:12:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	gaim-data is in main
2005-09-01T05:13:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	you should have it available
2005-09-01T05:13:00.000Z	dpowers	_frank_	i have it available, it's just i have the wrong version
2005-09-01T05:13:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	what version of gaim did you install? from what repository?
2005-09-01T05:14:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	you're right... gaim-data is missing from backports
2005-09-01T05:14:00.000Z	dpowers	_frank_	i have lots of entries in /etc/apt/sources.list, how do i now which one it's choosing?
2005-09-01T05:15:00.000Z	dpowers	_frank_	others too, gimp, mozilla, etc
2005-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	backports is having problems. you can download what you need manually from http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net/dists/hoary-backports/main/binary-i386/
2005-09-01T05:16:00.000Z	dpowers	_frank_	thanks glad it's not me
2005-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	and install with dpkg.
2005-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	dpowers	_frank_	do i need to let anyone know?
2005-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	I think they know.
2005-09-01T05:17:00.000Z	_frank_	dpowers	The backport forums are full of this problem
