2007-08-18T10:15:00.000Z	fsdsa	bruenig	so i have to find another better distribution
2007-08-18T10:15:00.000Z	bruenig	fsdsa	those are kernel issues, not debian/centos issues

2007-08-23T13:41:00.000Z	bruenig	fsdsa	no
2007-08-23T13:41:00.000Z	bruenig	fsdsa	you can have it execute a script that will run a command every 10 seconds
