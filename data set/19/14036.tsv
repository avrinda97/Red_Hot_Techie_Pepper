2005-02-02T12:19:00.000Z	proudhon		unoffical ubuntu guide mentions the ipv6 problem
2005-02-02T12:19:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	oh. Great, thanks.
2005-02-02T12:25:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	I couldn't find anything related to apache2 IPv6 problem. I disabled the support from Firefox but that didn't solve it.
2005-02-02T12:25:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	as it seems that apache2 is binding to IPv6 address.
2005-02-02T12:26:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	yea np :)
2005-02-02T12:28:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	no problem. This problem is strange though.. I have not made any changes and still it binds to wrong address apparently.
2005-02-02T12:35:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	:)
2005-02-02T12:35:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	this might not be Ubuntu business anyhow..
2005-02-02T12:37:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	huh?
2005-02-02T12:41:00.000Z	Cred	proudhon	naah. I already have like 5 IRC servers and around 15 channels..
