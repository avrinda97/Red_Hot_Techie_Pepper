2011-01-06T00:38:00.000Z	steve34		I'm looking for help getting into an old IDE hard drive.  My hard drive has Ubuntu 8.10 on it.  I forgot my password.  Anyone wanna help me find my way into my hard drive?

2011-01-06T00:40:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Check it out and let me know if you can follow iup.
2011-01-06T00:42:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Did you get the link?  That will allow you to reset your root password and from there you can reset the passwords for any of your accounts.
2011-01-06T00:43:00.000Z	steve34	mactimes	I did look at it, but I'm a slow reader
2011-01-06T00:44:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Ok.  That is a step-by-step procedure.  I've written that because many people already asked that.  So, if you need any help with that, just let me know.
2011-01-06T00:44:00.000Z	steve34	mactimes	thx
2011-01-06T00:44:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	np.
2011-01-06T00:48:00.000Z	steve34	mactimes	I'm in live cd.  The computer doesn't seem to find the hard drive.  There are no jumpers to tell it that it's master, slave, or what
2011-01-06T00:49:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Oh, sorry, I thought you wanted to regain access to the accounts in an already installed system.
2011-01-06T00:49:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Ok, start up a console then and we'll take if from there.
2011-01-06T00:50:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Applications --> Accessories --> Console
2011-01-06T00:50:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	I mean, Applications --> Accessories --> Terminal
2011-01-06T00:51:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	Let me know when you're ready.
2011-01-06T00:51:00.000Z	steve34	mactimes	I had figured that out.  Btw, I'm restarting the computer with only the old hard drive through live cd
2011-01-06T00:52:00.000Z	steve34	mactimes	I haven't yet folowed your counsel, but I have bookmarked it
2011-01-06T00:53:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	That won't be of any use for you now.  That's for root access recovery.
2011-01-06T00:53:00.000Z	mactimes	steve34	That works in case you've lost access to your local accounts.  It's a procedure to reset your root account password so that you can manage the other accounts in the computer.
2011-01-06T00:54:00.000Z	steve34	mactimes	I understand that.  I was root on that hard drive.  Had bad block issues and replaced the 120GB with a 250GB
