2008-12-31T09:09:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	i do, its kinda a pain, but it works
2008-12-31T09:12:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	it wont mount or what?
2008-12-31T09:13:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	its checked under Devices -> USB
2008-12-31T09:14:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	does it show up with 'sudo fdisk -l'?
2008-12-31T09:16:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	yes, when not checked in virtualbox
2008-12-31T09:17:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	hmm itzhero if you're external is mounted, vbox should have no prob using it
2008-12-31T09:18:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	it detects the iPhone, and when i run fdisk -l when its checked in vbox, it does not show up in the list, neither does the iPhone which is in use on the vbox
2008-12-31T09:19:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	i question that its even mounted then. have you checked in /media/?
2008-12-31T09:20:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	no, it unmounts when i enable it under vbox devices
2008-12-31T09:20:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	ah, wow ok im not sure then
2008-12-31T09:21:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	it can only be mounted to one or the other, correct? not both?
2008-12-31T09:22:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	well first you need to figure out why things are not mounting before you do anything with Vbox
2008-12-31T09:22:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	guest editions are installed.
2008-12-31T09:23:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	i followed this tutorial to get it working thusfar: http://maketecheasier.com/sync-ipod-touch-with-win-xp-vm-in-ubuntu-intrepid/2008/12/16
2008-12-31T09:23:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	i wouldnt worry bout that right now, you need to figure out why mounting is buggy
2008-12-31T09:24:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	not sure man, i dont use 8.10
2009-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	eseven73	itzhero	99% of the commands people tell you to run here, should be put in a terminal :)
2009-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	itzhero	eseven73	yeah i figured, but i mentioned cups so i wasn't too sure
