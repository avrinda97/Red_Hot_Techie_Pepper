2009-04-28T02:28:00.000Z	losher		narcolepsy: "went down", or crashed/panicked?
2009-04-28T02:30:00.000Z	losher		you too, Mc-Kay
2009-04-28T02:31:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	i do alot of backups, its the only way for me, to clone HDs
2009-04-28T02:32:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	you understand that hotplugging IDE drives is unsupported as far as I know, both by the hardware and software, or do you know something I don't?
2009-04-28T02:33:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	Sata ones, I have a push in drive caddy on the first of this box.
2009-04-28T02:34:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	might work with SATA, I'd have to research it. But we were talking IDE/PATA
2009-04-28T02:35:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	no kidding. "I've gotten away with it in the past" isn't nearly the same as "it's supported"
2009-04-28T02:36:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	I run a hosting company, its not like you can turn anything off, ive had ide drive from the cases too
2009-04-28T02:36:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	ive even changed a GFX card :D
2009-04-28T02:38:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	you got lucky, so far. But I don't think it's fair not to warn 'fool' that hotplugging IDE cards is totally not recommended. Of course, if the hosting company is paying for the hardware, maybe I'd be more cavalier about hardware...
2009-04-28T02:38:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	that's apparent...
2009-04-28T02:40:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	so when you hotplug a drive, how do you know which device it will show up as/
2009-04-28T02:40:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	yes, i check the drive ID, then just unmount it
2009-04-28T02:42:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	ok, that's not so bad. Mobos and software generally have to be able to cope with a drive disappearing due to an unexpected hardware failure (like there's any other kind), but 'foo' implied he'd added a brand new drive rather than replaced an existing one. That's very scary....
2009-04-28T02:45:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	ever month I have to make sure all the drives here are replaced, it takes 30mins to backup a 1TB drive, with 20 drives on a server, 10 are backups, all i do is rotate the drives from new to old.
2009-04-28T02:49:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	the think the upsets me is the stuff we throw out every month, its crazy.
2009-04-28T02:49:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	I understand why that works, to the system it just looks like the drive's went offline for a while. It's not the same case the 'fool' described though. http://linux-ata.org/software-status.html says that all sata devices are hotplug capable, though not all controllers support it.
2009-04-28T02:50:00.000Z	losher	Mc-Kay	please send me some drives :-)
2009-04-28T02:51:00.000Z	Mc-Kay	losher	dunno, i could see them
