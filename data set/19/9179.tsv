2007-04-10T12:39:00.000Z	mneptok	mistone	MS OS licenses to OEMs dictate that all OEMs *MUST* provide hard-copy installation media. call HP and ask for your Vista install disk. if they hesitate, ask to speak to their MS lidcensing unit.
2007-04-10T12:40:00.000Z	mneptok	mistone	they all do. that does not fulfill their contractual obligation to provido original media.
2007-04-10T12:41:00.000Z	mneptok	mistone	think "i replaced my hard drive and ...."  ;)
2007-04-10T12:41:00.000Z	mistone	mneptok	what?
2007-04-10T12:42:00.000Z	mneptok	mistone	no no. but if someone replaces a drive, that SOOOPER SEKRIT OOOO VISTA partition is as useless as a whistle on a squid
2007-04-10T12:44:00.000Z	mistone	mneptok	oh so you are saying because I resized the drive it thinks I replaced the drive and it wn't work now
2007-04-10T13:02:00.000Z	mneptok	mistone	no
