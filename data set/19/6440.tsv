2008-01-18T07:02:00.000Z	creeed		hello, I should export Proxy-configurations to connect from a proxy at work, I wrote some lines too in /etc/profile to do this. Now I removed the lines from /etc/profile but apt-get still use the proxy-configuration!! I want now just to desactive the proxy-configuration and go back to direct internet connection. can someone help please?

2008-01-18T07:03:00.000Z	erawfish	creeed	also what does "env" say?

2008-01-18T07:06:00.000Z	creeed	erawfish	you mean logged out an in back, yes
2008-01-18T07:06:00.000Z	erawfish	creeed	I asked you more than that
2008-01-18T07:07:00.000Z	creeed	erawfish	I copied what env about proxy says because the output of env is long!

2008-01-18T07:15:00.000Z	erawfish	creeed	somewhere in a file there is a HTTP_PROXY on yout siystem set. either in ~ or in /etc. if not: then you didn't really log out
2008-01-18T07:16:00.000Z	erawfish	creeed	and that would mean you lied to me. I want to think good things about people so I'd say you didn't lie. for now
2008-01-18T07:19:00.000Z	creeed	erawfish	if you want to help me so do that if not or you cant so pls stop say everything!
