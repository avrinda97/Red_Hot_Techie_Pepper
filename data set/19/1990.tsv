2010-08-07T12:30:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	you don't specify modules in grub; are you just trying to install grub on another partition?
2010-08-07T12:35:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	darolu, actually i have xp on sda1, rhel5 on sda2 and ubuntu on sda3. And i just want to use chainload in RHEL's grub 0.97. RHEL's grub is in /dev/sda and thats why i was trying to install grub2 of ubuntu in /dev/sda3 but it says "Auto-detection of the filesystem module failed. Please specify the module with the option `--modules' explicitly."
2010-08-07T12:37:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	you don't need to install grub to sda3 if you are chainloading...
2010-08-07T12:37:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	but grub 0.97 doesn't support ext4 filesystem.
2010-08-07T12:38:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	Ah: there's the rub... Now I see your dilema
2010-08-07T12:39:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	hehe.....finally you got my problem....:)
2010-08-07T12:41:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	upgrading RHEL to grub 2 not an option?

2010-08-07T12:47:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	insmod {module} should work...
2010-08-07T12:48:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	thanks bro......:)
2010-08-07T12:49:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	i m trying, if i am successfull in that then will notify you....:)
2010-08-07T12:49:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	hopefully, it will work. Cool
2010-08-07T13:02:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	is there any command to check filesystem of the current system??
2010-08-07T13:03:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	fdisk -l
2010-08-07T13:05:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	it doen't show the filesystem but i get info by checking the partition  properties...:)
2010-08-07T13:07:00.000Z	jasonwryan	AMAN_1987	my bad - that would be mount :)
2010-08-07T13:08:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	yeah it happens sometimes....:) but you stil a PRO....:)
2010-08-07T13:09:00.000Z	AMAN_1987	jasonwryan	ok buddy i m going for reboot.....bbye...:)
