2007-03-12T14:44:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	detection of what?
2007-03-12T15:09:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	I already asked you. What are you missing? Sound card? Video Card? What?
2007-03-12T15:09:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	I'm not missing anything.... what do you mean?
2007-03-12T15:10:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	Pay attention to your own question. Please
2007-03-12T15:12:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	How are u installing? Using a cd or via net?
2007-03-12T15:13:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	CD
2007-03-12T15:13:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	have you checked cd integrity?
2007-03-12T15:14:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	Yes I have... no errors..
2007-03-12T15:14:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	clean up with water the cd
2007-03-12T15:15:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	It already happened with me and it was only a matter of cleaning
2007-03-12T15:16:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	There's nothing wrong with the CD. I'm obsessed when it comes to keeping CDs and DVDs clean.
2007-03-12T15:17:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	Percise if there is something blocking ROM from reading the CD, integrity scan would detect it.
2007-03-12T15:17:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	have you tested it in another machine?
2007-03-12T15:18:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	Well, I tested it on this one few months ago; it went well then (same CD). I added a TV card since then.
2007-03-12T15:23:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Andy_Alpha	sorry. But there must be something wrong with the cd. Try the alternate
2007-03-12T15:26:00.000Z	Andy_Alpha	GaiaX11	I'm downloading alternate... :) thx
