2008-04-23T05:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	anything will run - what you need to know is whether you can run a GUI.
2008-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	perhaps Fluxbox will, or Enlightenment.  Lots of options.
2008-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	Yes sorry i want a gnome or dke desktop enviroment i forgot to specisize
2008-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	Gnome and KDE aren't going to work, sorry.
2008-04-23T05:13:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	Ok is their anyother versions besides command line that will?
2008-04-23T05:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	Like I said, try flux or E, or openbox/blackbox/matchbox, or icewm
2008-04-23T05:15:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	Ok thanks alot
2008-04-23T05:18:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	Openbox is a .deb package how does that work?
2008-04-23T05:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	you should install it through the package manager built into the system.  /msg ubotu software for details.
2008-04-23T05:20:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	So i have to install ubuntu or something first?
2008-04-23T05:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	Correct - you can use the !alternate CD to install a minimal system and install openbox from there.
2008-04-23T05:22:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	So when i get to ubuntu terminal if the download link is http://bah.com/openbox.deb id just type in sudo wget install http://bah.com/openbox.deb
2008-04-23T05:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	no, you don't get it from that site at all - you use apt-get.
2008-04-23T05:23:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	No that was a example url openbox has a wiki with a link to a .deb package
2008-04-23T05:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	Regardless, you won't be using any link at all - it's all built into the system.
2008-04-23T05:24:00.000Z	vendeta	tonyyarusso	 Ok so how to i start synpatics package manager from terminal?
2008-04-23T05:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vendeta	Synaptic is a graphical application, and not available from terminal-only installations.  Use apt-get instead.
