2007-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	topher_kris		Hey, whats the best way to mount media shares in fstab.. Whats the best protocol
2007-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	media shares?
2007-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	topher_kris		just shares on another box.
2007-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	topher_kris		NFS, or SMB.. that is the question.
2007-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	well i use places>connect to server
2007-05-06T07:49:00.000Z	topher_kris	Schalken	what protcol does that use?
2007-05-06T07:49:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	whatever protocol you tell it to use.
2007-05-06T07:49:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	smb, ftp, nfs...
2007-05-06T07:49:00.000Z	topher_kris		oh, wow.  Is there a way to store that in your session info or something
2007-05-06T07:50:00.000Z	topher_kris		i just want to make sure that when it boots, it connects.
2007-05-06T07:50:00.000Z	topher_kris		what the hell is going on here.
2007-05-06T07:50:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	it doesnt connect on boot. it just gives you an icon on your desktop and in your nautilus bookmarks.
2007-05-06T07:51:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	actually, maybe it does... (hance "connect to server" :P )
2007-05-06T07:51:00.000Z	topher_kris		yah, i'm kinda old school linux, so i was just thinking of doing it in fstab ..
2007-05-06T07:51:00.000Z	topher_kris		but i really dont need to it connect unless i'm in X
2007-05-06T07:52:00.000Z	topher_kris		so if there is a way to set it up in my session, that'd work.  I guess i could just create an .xsession script, or whatever its called now
2007-05-06T07:52:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	thats too hacky. theres an interface.
2007-05-06T07:53:00.000Z	Schalken	topher_kris	try the "connect to server..." and if it only "connects" when you open it up, then look at the ubuntu guide about mounting shares.
2007-05-06T07:53:00.000Z	topher_kris	Schalken	i cut my teeth on slackware -- but realized how awesome ubuntu is
