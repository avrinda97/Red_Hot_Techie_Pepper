2006-06-29T07:34:00.000Z	d-s-d		How can I change the resolution after booting from the liveCD?
2006-06-29T07:35:00.000Z	d-s-d		The ScreenResolution-Tool only displays "640x480" which sucks.
2006-06-29T07:35:00.000Z	compengi	d-s-d	go to system then preference then screen resolution
2006-06-29T07:37:00.000Z	compengi	d-s-d	is your vga driver installed?
2006-06-29T07:38:00.000Z	compengi	d-s-d	btw did you choose a correct live cd for your pc?
