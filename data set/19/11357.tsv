2006-02-19T16:13:00.000Z	jhons2		Hi all- can anyone take a installation question>
2006-02-19T16:15:00.000Z	jhons2		Can you choose which harddrive you want to install to in the installer?
2006-02-19T16:16:00.000Z	jhons2		ok because I was installing Kubuntu and I dont think it ever did
2006-02-19T16:17:00.000Z	jhons2		Can you choose which harddrive you want to install to in the installer fo Kubuntu? ( I forgot to say i was installing Kubuntu)
2006-02-19T16:18:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	yes, but imo 5.04 (Hoary) seems a little buggy, so physically unplug either the power cable or the data cable off the other hard drives before approaching installation and you should be set
2006-02-19T16:19:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	do i need to worry about that with 5.10?
2006-02-19T16:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	not sure, give it a try, if at boot it does not seem to work, then you can try my method
2006-02-19T16:24:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	would there be any risk in formatting my windows drive?
2006-02-19T16:25:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	are you planning to make it a linux only install or dualboot?
2006-02-19T16:26:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	dual boo, but i have two hard drives
2006-02-19T16:27:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	it shouldn't really affect it imo, but there might be a chance that it will.. I mean ubuntu/kubuntu not booting up. With dualboot it should not affect it
2006-02-19T16:28:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	so i just need to unplug my primary(windows) drive?
2006-02-19T16:29:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	that's only if it does not work
2006-02-19T16:31:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	ok as long as i will have a HD choice during the installation of Kubuntu 5.10  I tried installing it but it went into installation, and i rebooted and windows had an error and i had to rollback
2006-02-19T16:31:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	hopefully your bootloader is grub, and I don't see how that would have a major affect on dualbooting part
2006-02-19T16:32:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	i thought that grub was included in the kubuntu install
2006-02-19T16:34:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	it is, but it also has lilo bootloader as a fallback installation for bootloader. Some people can get lilo bootloader to work with windows, other's can't, your mileage may vary
2006-02-19T16:35:00.000Z	jhons2	hatake_kakashi	thanks for your help
2006-02-19T16:35:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	jhons2	np
