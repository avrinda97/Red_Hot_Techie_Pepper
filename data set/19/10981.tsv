2006-06-01T13:50:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	How do I do that ? :(
2006-06-01T13:51:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
2006-06-01T13:51:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	then try ping 192.168.1.1
2006-06-01T13:51:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	Ok. Btw, why does ppp0 become inactive when I bring up eth0 ?
2006-06-01T13:52:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	That would only usually happen if you have two default routes (the dhcp will provide a default route which will replece the one which is thru ppp0
2006-06-01T13:53:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	If it is on 192.168.0.1 then set the address to 192.168.0.2
2006-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	ping ?
2006-06-02T06:07:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	Hello
2006-06-04T05:27:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	Is the router working now ?
2006-06-04T05:32:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	Yes. Load 'dmfe' instead of 'tulip' and it works automagically :)
2006-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	Is that a bug in the hardware detection of ubuntu then ?
2006-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	Heh, I made a wiki page that people might run across when having issues with it
2006-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	Yes, reported it :)
2006-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	I think so ... But AFAIK upgrading to eft is not a good idea as of now because lots of stuff will break :-/
2006-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	ubuntu+1 has opened again though, you might want to ask there
2006-06-10T07:39:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	n/m, you're already there ...
2006-06-10T07:39:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	Exactly no I was just thinking that !upgrade should be changed
2006-06-10T07:40:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	neutrinomass	I am not willing to try it but someone may not read !upgrade properly and blindly run the command
2006-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	neutrinomass	h3sp4wn	I guess you're right... I'm not sure how it can be changed though ...
