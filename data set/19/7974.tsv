2007-05-29T08:20:00.000Z	mroc		i need help with nautilus - it's freezing up and i don't know how to solve this problem.  please?
2007-05-29T08:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	can you repeat the freezes doing certain actions?
2007-05-29T08:22:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	 yeah, trying to open any window from the standard menu bar or launching from terminal.   i have a couple folders on my desktop, and double-clicking on them seems not to freeze anything
2007-05-29T08:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	what error so dyou get frmo the terminal?
2007-05-29T08:23:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	 i've been launching from the termnal using the command "nautilus" and it doesn't give an error - it just returns the prompt and launches a window - which loads no icons and freezes
2007-05-29T08:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	and gives absolutely no feedback?
2007-05-29T08:28:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	hwilde55:    so where should i go from here?
2007-05-29T08:39:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	 ideas on how i should fix things then?
2007-05-29T08:44:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	 just want to make sure i didn't get forgotten - any ideas on how to fix my gnome / nautilus troubles?
2007-05-29T08:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	i don't know sorry
2007-05-29T08:45:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	 i don't mind reinstalling gnome if that's likely to fix the problem (overkill as it may be).  can you tell me the best way to reinstall it?
2007-05-29T08:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	I don't think it will fix it
2007-05-29T08:46:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	  ok - i appreciate the help you were able to give though.  thanks.
2007-05-29T08:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	I suggest creating a new user, logging in with them and seeing if their fresh defaults work.
2007-05-29T08:47:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	dr_willis:    ok, i'll give that a shot.   thanks.
2007-05-29T09:03:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	so that tells us there's no reason for reinstalling gnome, its your own configuration ;)
2007-05-29T09:04:00.000Z	mroc	PriceChild	  how would i go about finding what's causing the problem?
2007-05-29T09:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	I don't know sory
2007-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	PriceChild	mroc	rmdir
