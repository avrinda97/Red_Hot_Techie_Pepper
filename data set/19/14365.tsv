2004-09-28T15:56:00.000Z	highvoltage		does anyone know if future versions of ubuntu will give you an option of installing lilo?
2004-09-28T15:56:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	highvoltage	extremely unlikely
2004-09-28T15:56:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		why?
2004-09-28T15:56:00.000Z	highvoltage		I like lilo
2004-09-28T15:56:00.000Z	highvoltage		been using it forever
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	highvoltage		now I have to learn all the grub stuff
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	highvoltage	I liked lilo to until I used grub :)
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	highvoltage		why is grub better? I'm not arguing, I just want to educate myself
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	highvoltage	grub knows about the filesystem
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		if you screw it up
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		and get the wrong file
2004-09-28T15:57:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		it'll still boot
2004-09-28T15:58:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		if you recompile the kernel
2004-09-28T15:58:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		and name it the same
2004-09-28T15:58:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		it'll still work
2004-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	highvoltage		ah ok
2004-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	highvoltage		I'll read some more documentation and stuff
2004-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	highvoltage	azeem	I like to fiddle
2004-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	highvoltage	any question that is asked in the installer *NEEDS* to be asked
