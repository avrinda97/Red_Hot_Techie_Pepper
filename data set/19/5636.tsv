2011-10-12T13:33:00.000Z	meco		Is it possible to amplify the volume in the headphones, using software, beyond what I get from using pavucontrol?
2011-10-12T13:33:00.000Z	reisio	meco	pavucontrol should be enough...
2011-10-12T13:33:00.000Z	reisio	meco	you might try mplayer -af volume=10 though
2011-10-12T13:33:00.000Z	reisio	meco	start with 10, it's a lot
2011-10-12T13:35:00.000Z	reisio	meco	well you could download it with downloadhelper and play it, but yeah potentially inconvenient
2011-10-12T13:35:00.000Z	reisio	meco	pavucontrol doesn't produce any change?
2011-10-12T13:35:00.000Z	meco	reisio	I already have pavucontrol at maximum
2011-10-12T13:35:00.000Z	reisio	meco	but it did make a difference?
2011-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	meco	reisio	Well, no, since it was already at maximum before the current need arose...
2011-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	reisio	meco	okay... so if you lower the volume it changes?
2011-10-12T13:37:00.000Z	meco	reisio	Sure, pavucontrol works
2011-10-17T00:54:00.000Z	reisio	meco	yes
2011-10-17T00:55:00.000Z	reisio	meco	what is the media source
2011-10-17T01:12:00.000Z	reisio	meco	a deb file of what?
2011-10-17T01:12:00.000Z	meco	reisio	TeamViewer
2011-10-17T01:12:00.000Z	reisio	meco	oh okay :p
2011-10-17T01:13:00.000Z	reisio	meco	for almost anything else I would've suggested not installing from a random .deb, but teamviewer is okay :p
2011-10-17T01:13:00.000Z	reisio	meco	personally I'd use the tar.gz instead of the deb, though
2011-12-29T00:49:00.000Z	reisio	meco	lspci | grep -i vga
