2007-12-04T04:06:00.000Z	RuanE_		Hey
2007-12-04T04:07:00.000Z	RuanE_		Just asking for some help with Ubuntu 7.10 x60
2007-12-04T04:07:00.000Z	RuanE_		*x86
2007-12-04T04:08:00.000Z	RuanE_		I can ping domains, get traceroutes succesfully onto the interwebs, but I cannot browse in Firefox
2007-12-04T04:08:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	check your proxy settings for firefox
2007-12-04T04:09:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	can you telnet to port 80 on a host?
2007-12-04T04:10:00.000Z	RuanE_	Ubmin	Not overly sure how to do that, could you guide :)
2007-12-04T04:10:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	open a terminal, type:  telnet yahoo.com 80
2007-12-04T04:13:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	should be working fine then
2007-12-04T04:14:00.000Z	RuanE_	Ubmin	It's not :/
2007-12-04T04:14:00.000Z	RuanE_	Ubmin	just says the connection has timed out
2007-12-04T04:15:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	do you have a lot of important bookmarks saved?
2007-12-04T04:15:00.000Z	RuanE_	Ubmin	I seem to recall having the same issue with an earlier version of Kubuntu, and never solved the issue
2007-12-04T04:15:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	i'm running kubuntu on this system :)
2007-12-04T04:16:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	ok, quit firefox, open a terminal and type:  rm -rf .mozilla/
2007-12-04T04:16:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	then run firefox again
2007-12-04T04:17:00.000Z	RuanE_	Ubmin	No, Mozilla still seems to be full of Lack
2007-12-04T04:23:00.000Z	Ubmin	RuanE_	what website did you try to go to?
2007-12-04T04:26:00.000Z	RuanE_	Ubmin	Everyone I have spoken to, even the supreme Ubuntu gods are now completely stumped :(
