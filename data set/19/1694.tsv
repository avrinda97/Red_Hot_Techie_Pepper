2010-10-31T23:24:00.000Z	lea123	Dr_Willis	Are you saying the ubuntu installer would still need to be given the original partions 125 each so that it partitions in the linux format
2010-10-31T23:24:00.000Z	lea123		125 GB
2010-10-31T23:24:00.000Z	mrnelson1986		 know how to automatically connect to wifi? like before login so that if I reboot a cpu from teamviewer i will be able to connect via ssh and login? using ubuntu 10.10
2010-10-31T23:26:00.000Z	lea123	Dr_Willis	I understand that , but do I need to re-partion it in linux is my question for the same sizes thats the thing that I am trying to understand
2010-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	lea123	Dr_Willis	. Thats the thing I don't want to make it smaller I am happy to give it all the 125 GB it has in C and D.  Do you see my point ?
2010-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	lea123		I meant I don't want to resize D at all
2010-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	lea123	 you want to eliminate your windows partition?
2010-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	lea123		NO I don't want to eliminate it
2010-10-31T23:30:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	lea123	you have a C: with the OS (windows) on it already, and a D: with space that you want to use for linux?
2010-10-31T23:30:00.000Z	lea123		Thats it Mrnelson1986 Thats what I wanted to tell all along :)
2010-10-31T23:32:00.000Z	lea123		I will go with the former option asking Linux to use all of D
2010-10-31T23:32:00.000Z	lea123		How ??
2010-10-31T23:32:00.000Z	lea123		data as in ?
2010-10-31T23:33:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	lea123	you will want ot move whatever is on the D: partition to your C: partition so you don't lose your data (if any), second step is to boot into the live cd, use an application called gParted under administration-->system and delete the partition D: using gParted, third step is to install ubuntu and tell it to install side by side with existing OS
2010-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	mrnelson1986		 know how to automatically connect to wifi? like before login so that if I reboot a cpu from teamviewer i will be able to connect via ssh and login? using ubuntu 10.10 anyone?
2010-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	lea123		OK I don't have any files or data in D : MrNelson1986 why delete D ??
2010-10-31T23:35:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	lea123	because if you delete it, then it will be "unallocated" space, and ubuntu will automatically choose it to install the linux partition formatted at ext instead of NTFS
2010-10-31T23:36:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	lea123	 use either my method or Dr_Willis method, they both will accomplish what you want and both do essentially the same thing, i just personally prefer gParted to windows tools
