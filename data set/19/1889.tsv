2011-06-29T12:54:00.000Z	ttiicc		Im fine with apt but just wonder why aptitude is not included from the start with ubuntu
2011-06-29T12:56:00.000Z	ttiicc		could someone answer the question I just asked?
2011-06-29T12:57:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	about default package installation? good luck
2011-06-29T12:57:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	what do you mean?
2011-06-29T12:57:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	sorry i thought your question was about aptitude not being installed by default or something
2011-06-29T12:58:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	yeahh I wonder why aptitude dosn't come default installed with ubuntu
2011-06-29T12:58:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	you will not really be able to get that sort of question addressed here, IMHO
2011-06-29T12:59:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	hehehe okej, do you know why?
2011-06-29T13:00:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	pure speculation: apt-get is more basic, less things can go wrong. aptitude is a bigger package, more complex, more things could go wrong. idk just guessing
2011-06-29T13:01:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	okej thanks
2011-06-29T13:01:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	thought that ubuntu maybe never installs per default twp packages that does the same job
2011-06-29T13:02:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	that probably also
2011-06-29T13:02:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	okej thanks, Im new with ubuntu, Im used to use debian. there both apt and aptitude comes as default
2011-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	i recommend going back to debian. i dont' like ubuntu.
2011-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	ah ok. hope you enjoy it then :)
2011-06-29T13:09:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	As Im going to do what you already have done, wonder which parts of ubuntu do you think is not good compared to debian
2011-06-29T13:10:00.000Z	hdon	ttiicc	many small issues. it seems they are very negligent of features that coders / "power users" use. i have had problems with ALT+TAB, for instance
2011-06-29T13:11:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	ok then I know
2011-06-29T13:13:00.000Z	ttiicc	hdon	which language do you program in?
