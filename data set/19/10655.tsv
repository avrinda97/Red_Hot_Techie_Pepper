2006-06-21T06:51:00.000Z	vanberge		would somebody please offer me help playing avi files with totem?   i've done the restricted formats tutorial off the wiki and still cannot play these files
2006-06-21T06:51:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	try vlc or mplayer
2006-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	vanberge	rixxon	i'd rather fix the underlying issue vs. trying different apps...  :-(
2006-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	pf. :(
2006-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	vanberge	rixxon	there must be some reason why it is not working, right?
2006-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	sure you did everything in RestrictedFormats? seems to work for most other people
2006-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	vanberge	rixxon	yes.... because i could play this same movie file yesterday
2006-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	vanberge		but i cannot today
2006-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	oops :)
2006-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	vanberge	rixxon	i even went back through and re-did the steps
2006-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	uh *stupid idea* perhaps something screwed up the packages, try reinstall them? :S
2006-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	oh
2006-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	vanberge	rixxon	 would installing totem-xine package mess up something?
2006-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	vanberge		i think thats where it went wrong
2006-06-21T06:55:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	it might? i mean i guess it is possible?
2006-06-21T06:55:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	anyways, i doubt i'll be able to help you, i'm basically a beginner
2006-06-21T06:55:00.000Z	vanberge		thank you rixxon.  :-)
2006-06-21T06:56:00.000Z	vanberge		does the restrictedformats tutorial include Xvid encoded videos??
2006-06-21T06:57:00.000Z	rixxon	vanberge	sure you read it? :P
