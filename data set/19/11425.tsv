2006-01-24T17:51:00.000Z	Sohmc		How do I get ubuntu to start a service at boot-time?  (e.g. httpd, sshd, etc.)
2006-01-24T17:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Sohmc	you install "boot up manager" bum
2006-01-24T17:52:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	thanks!  installing now
2006-01-24T17:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Sohmc	of course you will have to install the correct program to have it kick off when you start the machine
2006-01-24T17:53:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	what do you mean?
2006-01-24T17:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Sohmc	if you want to start or stop a web server with it you will need to install such a webserver
2006-01-24T17:54:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	heheh..thanks..  I was aware of that..  I'm switching from fedora core to ubuntu and don't know what translates to what
2006-01-24T17:55:00.000Z	Sohmc		on fedora, it's configure-services-something or other
2006-01-24T17:56:00.000Z	ompaul	Sohmc	it all translates as different, feels similar, but much, much better :-) the most important thing is to get used to sudo - su will ruin your life if you use it (maybe not your life but it could ruin your days
2006-01-24T17:56:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	Yeah, I got the sudo speech yesterday
2006-01-24T17:57:00.000Z	Sohmc		I've been considering a distro change for a while...held off because, well, old habits die hard
2006-01-24T17:57:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	I haven't been able to get sudo to work correctly
2006-01-24T17:57:00.000Z	Sohmc		it says that I'm not entering the write password, when su works fine
2006-01-24T17:58:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	bum is really taking a long time to load...is that normal?
2006-01-24T17:58:00.000Z	ompaul	Sohmc	yes
2006-01-24T17:58:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	it just finished...lol
2006-01-24T06:00:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	how do I fix sudu so that I don't have to su anymore??  when I try to sudo, it says that I have the wrong password when my password is the same
2006-01-24T06:01:00.000Z	ompaul		!tell Sohmc about sudo
2006-01-24T06:04:00.000Z	Sohmc	ompaul	I'm still having problems.  My user is in the admin group and the admin group is in /etc/sudoers and sudo still doesn't work
