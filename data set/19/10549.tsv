2006-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	you have done something wrong if all you can do is log in as root - that is not default behaviour for Ubuntu and it seems to be a little strange to me (but that is just me)
2006-06-13T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	have you asked in #kubuntu?
2006-06-13T16:08:00.000Z	DarkRavenMixage	ompaul	yes
2006-06-13T16:09:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	well they are the kde experts we are in the land of gnome ;-) ergo I asked, what puzzles me is that you can log in as root, that should not be possible
2006-06-13T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	couple you wait about 15 minutes between asks, it seems that no one knows the answer at this time
2006-06-13T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	how come you got a root password that I find curious
2006-06-13T16:15:00.000Z	DarkRavenMixage	ompaul	go to the
2006-06-13T16:18:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	that is not really a good idea, log out, then log into a console (Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get there) and do this, cd ~yourusername ; chown -R username:username .*
2006-06-13T16:19:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	I guess that you have changed the permissions to log in as you - cos you used something you don't need - root see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo  to disable root
2006-06-13T16:20:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	please put all your comments on one line - your current activity is spamming the channel
2006-06-13T16:21:00.000Z	ompaul	DarkRavenMixage	log out, then log into a console (as root) (Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get there) and do this, cd ~yourusername ; chown -R username:username .*
2006-06-13T16:21:00.000Z	DarkRavenMixage	ompaul	how can i give privileges of a directory and his subdirectories to an user via console?
