2007-10-22T22:39:00.000Z	FluxD	kevinO	system - preferences- keyboard shortcut
2007-10-22T22:42:00.000Z	kevinO	FluxD	the shortcut is there, it just wont work
2007-10-22T22:44:00.000Z	FluxD	kevinO	Preferences -> Keyboard -> Layout Options -> Alt/Win key Behavior. Then I changed the Default to "Alt and Meta are on the Alt keys (default)"
2007-10-22T22:48:00.000Z	kevinO	FluxD	, that did not do it either, i tried changeing the shortcut to ALT+F3 and that worked, but i cannot change it back to F2 or F1
