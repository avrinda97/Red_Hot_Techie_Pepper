2007-07-23T11:43:00.000Z	anathematic		how do i enable the root account on my server? :)
2007-07-23T11:44:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	'sudo passwd root'
2007-07-23T11:44:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	 that enables it? :)
2007-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	it's already enabled.  The password for root is missing or locked.  'sudo' allows you to execute 'passwd' as root. Changing root's password also unlocks it.
2007-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	i'd like to login as root if i coudl?
2007-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	'sudo -s'
2007-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	 thank you :)
2007-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	what's the command to just disable it again sorry?
2007-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	'sudo passwd -l root' locks root.
2007-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	 thank you :)
2007-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	if you really want to disable it (no chance to change your mind) disable sudo.  bad idea.
2007-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	 well i just want to disable access to login in from that account afterwards like it's default =)
2007-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	just 'sudo passwd -l root' .. you can verify this in /etc/shadow where there's an exclamation mark in front of the encrypted password for root.
2007-07-23T11:49:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	also, you can 'init=/bin/sh' in grub to gain access to a locked system.
2007-07-23T11:50:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	'sudo pa
2007-07-23T11:50:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	 haha thanks :)
2007-07-23T11:51:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	 thanks no more questions now ;)
2007-07-23T11:51:00.000Z	tetonca	anathematic	It should be clear that Linux cannot be secured if the intruder has physical access to the machine, and time -- except via encryption.
2007-07-23T11:52:00.000Z	anathematic	tetonca	i m aware of that thank you =)
