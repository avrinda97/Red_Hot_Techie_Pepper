2007-02-09T15:39:00.000Z	tuskernini		Question: NetworkManager applet lets me connect to wlan with key but not without key? why is that?
2007-02-09T15:40:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 because it's quite silly to use wlan without a key -- it's almost never advised/done
2007-02-09T15:40:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	i know, at home i have a key, and in the city we have a free one, i can not connect to the "open" one but i can connect to mine ofcourse and to a freinds which has a key
2007-02-09T15:41:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	that means i can only connect to a network, needing a key? should not be like that hey?
2007-02-09T15:43:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 well, i could suggest this (it may not work) .. edit the /etc/network/interfaces file and use a blank WEP/WPA key and then restart networking like this - sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2007-02-09T15:44:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	aha... but then the network manager will not work untill i change it back hey?
2007-02-09T15:44:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	thanks i will try that sometime...
2007-02-09T15:45:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 errm, it probably will let you use it when you need to connect back to the secured network
2007-02-09T15:45:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 IIRC, the network-admin lets you create profiles you can use -- you can create a profile for the secured network at home and another one for the unsecured wireless one at work -- and then switch between themw hen you need to
2007-02-09T15:46:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	aha that is also a good idea thanks.. but then i will not need network manager applet...
2007-02-09T15:47:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 i'm not so familiar with the netman applet -- maybe it lets you switch profiles, maybe not -- but yea, you'll know what to do :)
2007-02-09T15:48:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	thank you for your time
2007-02-11T15:11:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 on the server -- nc -v -L t -p 666 -- on the client - nc servername 666
2007-02-11T15:11:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	 thank you will try it out
2007-02-11T15:12:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	as we spoke just read it on http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/lofiversion/index.php/t11812.html
2007-02-11T15:13:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	 yea, it's probably where i copied that command from too (a few years ago)
2007-02-11T15:15:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	wierd with the nc -v -L t -p 666 i get a invalid option -- L
2007-02-11T15:17:00.000Z	unop	tuskernini	try -l instead there
2007-02-11T15:17:00.000Z	tuskernini	unop	will do
