2007-11-28T03:28:00.000Z	asymptote		i have a wine question
2007-11-28T03:29:00.000Z	asymptote		how do you start an application after it has been installed with wine ?
2007-11-28T03:29:00.000Z	asymptote		I installed Battlefield 1942 seamlessly but I don't know where to go to actually start Battlefield 1942
2007-11-28T03:30:00.000Z	asymptote		Jack can you clarify a little please
2007-11-28T03:30:00.000Z	pike_	asymptote	wine stuff is in ~/.wine/drive_c
2007-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	pike_	asymptote	liar!
2007-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	lol
2007-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	there's nothing in Program Files
2007-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	even if I type ls -a
2007-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	pike_	asymptote	run maybe winecfg and check path i dont have alot of exp with wine other than getting a few games working
2007-11-28T03:32:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	after you installed a game, how did you get it to start ?
2007-11-28T03:33:00.000Z	pike_	asymptote	drive_c is pretty much like c:\ i just navigated to program files\Eve\ Online or whatever and ran the executable like wine eve.exe  <-- i dont really play eve but as an example
2007-11-28T03:33:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	i understand that but as I said - there's nothing in there
2007-11-28T03:33:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	and I know battlefield 1942 installed because when I re-ran wine with the installer file
2007-11-28T03:33:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	it prompted me to UNinstall 1942
2007-11-28T03:34:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	indicating that it was already there
2008-03-14T00:31:00.000Z	pike_	asymptote	in the properties i guess just have it run gksu appname
2008-03-14T00:31:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	renfrew is it gksu or gksudo ?
2008-03-14T00:33:00.000Z	asymptote	pike_	renfrew thank you - however it didn't solve my problem :(
