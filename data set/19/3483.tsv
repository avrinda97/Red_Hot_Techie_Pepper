2009-07-31T19:19:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	just "man mysqldump" to see what order things should go in
2009-07-31T19:23:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	fire up mysql, and run statement "show databases;" to get a list of dbs.
2009-07-31T19:25:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	so, "mysqldump --databases vboki > mydumpfilename"
2009-07-31T19:26:00.000Z	garymc	nanotube	that code doesnt include username and password
2009-07-31T19:27:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	see what iceroot has posted :) -u username, etc.
2009-07-31T19:30:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	the file should have been created in the directory from which you ran mysqldump. probably your home dir?
2009-07-31T19:30:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	well, there it should be, then.
2009-07-31T19:32:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	it should be in the dir where you executed mysqldump - just "ls -al ." to list contenst.
2009-07-31T19:33:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	but yes, you can also find it with "find / -name mysqldump.sql" (or whatever filename you made)
2009-07-31T19:35:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	good work :)
2009-07-31T19:36:00.000Z	nanotube	garymc	yea, 73000kb is 73mb
