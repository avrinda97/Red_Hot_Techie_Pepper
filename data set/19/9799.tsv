2006-09-13T08:32:00.000Z	ebogart	exs	i don't have sound... completely :)
2006-09-13T08:32:00.000Z	exs	ebogart	 probably muted... if not you just need to go into the sound thingy.. forgot it's name now, haha.
2006-09-13T08:33:00.000Z	ebogart	exs	haha.  i can get some media players to work, and others claim there's no sound card!  java being a particular offender
2006-09-13T08:34:00.000Z	exs	ebogart	 go into  System > places > multimedia systems selector and check out that
2006-09-13T08:34:00.000Z	exs		 ebogart:  go into  System > prefrences > multimedia systems selector
2006-09-13T08:35:00.000Z	exs		(ignore first one)
2006-09-13T08:35:00.000Z	ebogart	exs	i don't actually have multimedia systems selector there.  only 'sound'

2006-09-13T08:45:00.000Z	ebogart	exs	the real issue for me is that some applications recognize and can output audio, others cant
