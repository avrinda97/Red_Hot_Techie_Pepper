2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	Macca		(ubuntu 7.04)

2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	Macca		seemingly nothing special
2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	Macca		browsing, etc
2007-09-09T10:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	how much ram do you have in that pc
2007-09-09T10:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	how much ram do you have in that pc
2007-09-09T10:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	Also check how much you are swapping to disk
2007-09-09T10:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	using a lot of ram?  any idea what for?  is that a gig you have and almost all is used?
2007-09-09T10:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	Are you also running desktop effects and such?
2007-09-09T10:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	You are having lockups and slow-downs right... you are using a lot of ram and that may be where you will find an answer
2007-09-09T10:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	What all do you have open...?
2007-09-09T10:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	You need to be looking at that when you are having problems
2007-09-09T10:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Macca	If onboard video, you may also want to see how much it is using
