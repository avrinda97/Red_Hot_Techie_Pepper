2006-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	PunjabiFLOYDIAN	um, that something is not working and you shouldn't install xgl, probably...
2006-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	PunjabiFLOYDIAN	I have no idea, I don't run XGL.
2006-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	PunjabiFLOYDIAN	ask on #ubuntu-xgl, that is the best channel to find out what's broken

2006-09-25T13:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	PunjabiFLOYDIAN	you know that Ubuntu doesn't play mp3 out of the box, right?
