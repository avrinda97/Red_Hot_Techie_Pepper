2007-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	wendell		My disk has been partitioning for over 1:30 hours and i'm worried it's frozen or something... should i quit or wait?
2007-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	wendell		My hard drive activity light isn't blinking
2007-03-16T06:11:00.000Z	wendell		heeelp!!
2007-03-16T06:11:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	well if you touch it, can you feel it seeking?
2007-03-16T06:12:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	what kind of drive is it?
2007-03-16T06:13:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	this is in the ubuntu install that you get stuck on partitioning?
2007-03-16T06:14:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	maybe you should kill it and try to come up in the livecd environment.  if it (ubuntu) is gonna be compatible with your hardware, maybe you can try partitioning and formatting from the live install session to see if it works there
2007-03-16T06:15:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	what options did you choose for partitioning?  is it resizing a windows partition?
2007-03-16T06:16:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	that can take a long time
2007-03-16T06:16:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	if it is resizing and you kill it, be aware that you may lose that partiton and all the data.  just be forewarned that it is not at all considered a safe thing to do
2007-03-16T06:18:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	that is up to you and your patience weighted against how much you value the existing data and whether reinstalling it all from scratch is a viable option for you (in case the worst happens)
2007-03-16T06:18:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	to be honest though, resizing in the first place is always to be considered a risky maneuver and should never be done to a partition with critical data (until you've backed it up)
2007-03-16T06:19:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	resized partitions you mean?
2007-03-16T06:19:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	partitioning can be quite fast.. resizing involves shuffling data
2007-03-16T06:19:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	then well maybe it is b0rked after all.
2007-03-16T06:20:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	i mean the resize operation.. it could be that it has been sitting there doing nothing, and your data *could* be just fine.  no guarantees.
2007-03-16T06:21:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	well like i said, it is up to you and your patience versus your willingness to deal with outcomes
2007-03-16T06:22:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	if you are fed up waiting and have no faith it's doing anything (no lights, no noticable seeks), then well maybe you are at that point of cancelling
2007-03-16T06:22:00.000Z	mojo	wendell	good luck
