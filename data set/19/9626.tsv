2006-10-14T11:18:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 the orange asterisk thingy?
2006-10-14T11:18:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	yes.
2006-10-14T11:18:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 double-click it it should open up update manager
2006-10-14T11:19:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	Nope.. doesn't seem to do anything.
2006-10-14T11:19:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 i assume you're comfortable at the command line?    sudo aptitude upgrade  should do the same thing.
2006-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	Doesn't seem to be doing anything. ps doesn't show aptitude running either.
2006-10-14T11:24:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	  make sure you don't have a CD line in  /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-10-14T11:24:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	I tried su'ing, instead of sudo'ing... it seems to be working now. Seems like maybe I am not in sudoers?
2006-10-14T11:25:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 the first user created during install is setup in the admin group and has full sudo access
2006-10-14T11:25:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 if you're not in the admin group that may have been the prob
2006-10-14T11:25:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	good info. No CD in sources.list. I will check admin group. Thanks.
2006-10-14T11:27:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	seems I am not in the admin group. I am in adm.
2006-10-14T11:28:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	There is no group admin. Do you mean adm?
2006-10-14T11:28:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 this is the line in my /etc/sudoers   %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL    the group is admin.
2006-10-14T11:29:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 i'm not sure what part of the install process does this but that's how it's supposed to be set up :] 
2006-10-14T11:29:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	Weird, no such line in my sudoers, and no group admin in /etc/groups.
2006-10-14T11:30:00.000Z	wastrel	jkcashin	 what version of ubuntu did you install?
2006-10-14T11:31:00.000Z	jkcashin	wastrel	10.1  I believe
