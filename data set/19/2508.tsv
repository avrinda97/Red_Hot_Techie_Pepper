2010-03-16T17:53:00.000Z	IMoM		is there an Ubuntu kernel config/compile channel?
2010-03-16T17:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	use the ubuntu cnfig file
2010-03-16T17:59:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	that will not help for what I require...  I need to prevent the kernel scramming my video chipset on boot
2010-03-16T18:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	but you can use the config as base then only change the one thing that needs changing
2010-03-16T18:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	if not is easy to make a no working kernel
2010-03-16T18:01:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	I am on my 3rd compile now... changed all parts that look like it could mess my video..  currently took out NLS
2010-03-16T18:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	what is the problem with your video card and why you think a kernel option is the culprit?
2010-03-16T18:03:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	other kernels, like CentOS default kernel works in RL3 with no problem..
2010-03-16T18:03:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	Ubuntu kernel kicks something before I even  get a login
2010-03-16T18:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	tried booting withot the quiet and splash kernel options ?
2010-03-16T18:05:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	yes..  nothing of use..  looks like it is still in initrd, not done a switchroot yet
2010-03-16T18:05:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	then my LCD just "whites out"
2010-03-16T18:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	passing a vga= parameter does not help either?
2010-03-16T18:07:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	didn't try that...  usually that takes effect earlier...  Worth a shot after the compile is completed..  thanks
2010-03-16T18:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	recovery mode
2010-03-16T18:13:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	should it be CLI still? no X?
2010-03-16T18:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	and if you want you can modify upstart and init to make a runlevel to suit your needs
2010-03-16T18:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	IMoM	yes recovery mode is single user mode
2010-03-16T18:14:00.000Z	IMoM	erUSUL	I am so used to using telinit  to bounce between 3 and 5 for testing X configs..  something to play with when I return from work.. thanks chaps
