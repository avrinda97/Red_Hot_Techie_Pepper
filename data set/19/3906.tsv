2009-05-07T19:21:00.000Z	neodragon_		I have Jaunty install on this PC and I have VNC setup using Vino, but when I connect from my work, I can't open anything by clicking with the mouse.
2009-05-07T19:21:00.000Z	neodragon_		I can see my desktop and I can move the mouse but it will not let me click or open anything, Help?

2009-05-07T19:24:00.000Z	neodragon_		I already have it set so I can control my desktop remotely as well
2009-05-07T19:25:00.000Z	pqpq	neodragon_	system > preferences  > remote desktop > x allow other users to control desktop
2009-05-07T19:26:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	I already have it set to allow others to control the desktop
2009-05-07T19:27:00.000Z	pqpq	neodragon_	how about , "you must confirm each access to this machine"
2009-05-07T19:27:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	I made sure to uncheck that option
2009-05-07T19:28:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	I set a password for myself and it connects just fine, I just can't click on anything even though it will let me move the mouse.
2009-05-07T19:30:00.000Z	pqpq	neodragon_	what  vnc client do you use ?
2009-05-07T19:31:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	realvnc from work although I did try tightvnc as well and got the same results.
2009-05-07T19:33:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	if it makes any difference my work uses all windows XP PC's.
2009-05-07T19:33:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	I was able to do it with Hardy just fine using realvnc, but ever since I upgraded to Intrepid and then Jaunty It doesn't work right
2009-05-07T19:35:00.000Z	pqpq	neodragon_	i'd try to disable desktop effects
2009-05-07T19:36:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	you think that might be lagging the connection
2009-05-07T19:38:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	the desktop effects never messed with the connect when I did on Hardy, why would it effect it on Jaunty?
2009-05-07T19:41:00.000Z	pqpq	neodragon_	do you have nvidia card ?
2009-05-07T19:42:00.000Z	neodragon_	pqpq	yes, nvidia geforce 7600gs 512MB AGP 8x
2009-05-07T19:54:00.000Z	pqpq	neodragon_	unless you turn off desktop effects it wont work, there is known bug in jaunty when using nvidia-restricted driver and compiz desktop
