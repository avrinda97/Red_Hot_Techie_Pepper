2007-04-18T11:35:00.000Z	tommytom	variant	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto this is more for just accessing existing data. how do i install from a live cd. sorry, im reading all this stuff but its not making any sense to me. i ahve empty space on the raid0 setup. 2 partions and 20gb of empty space. it sees the drives but not as raid0 (sees them as 2 seperate drives, unpartitioned)
2007-04-18T11:38:00.000Z	variant	tommytom	i am probably not the best person to ask, am going out now anyway. good luck. seeya
2007-04-18T11:49:00.000Z	tommytom	variant	if you are still there https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto this thing is spot on. learning alot. finally found a post from google "dmraid raid" that linked to that guide
