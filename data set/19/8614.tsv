2007-03-05T16:04:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	what media player? If you're using totem, either install totem-xine or alot of gstreamer0.10-plugins
2007-03-05T16:05:00.000Z	meezyfuh	abelstr	it is totem. can you tell me how to install the codecs?
2007-03-05T16:05:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	sudo aptitude install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly mpg321 vorbis-tools gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-gl libxine-main1 libxine-extracodecs gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse gstreamer0.10-pitfdll
2007-03-05T16:06:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	you'll need the universe and multiverse repositories enabled though.
2007-03-05T16:06:00.000Z	meezyfuh	abelstr	i don't know what that is.
2007-03-05T16:07:00.000Z	abelstr		!sources
2007-03-05T16:07:00.000Z	abelstr		!EasySource
2007-03-05T16:08:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	open a terminal, type in 'sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list' and delete the # signs at the beginning of each line containing 'deb' and an URL.
2007-03-05T16:08:00.000Z	meezyfuh	abelstr	i already started the install thingy you pasted. can i do that after this stuff installs?
2007-03-05T16:09:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	if it's already installing, that's fine, you don't need to do anything else.
2007-03-05T16:09:00.000Z	meezyfuh	abelstr	so i don't need to sudo nano thing?
2007-03-05T16:09:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	no, if it's busy installing the bunch of packages, you don't need to.
2007-03-05T16:09:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	because that means the universe and multiverse repositories are already enabled, so you don't need to enable them anymore.
2007-03-05T16:10:00.000Z	meezyfuh	abelstr	it's still saying it can't play it.
2007-03-05T16:10:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	is the command finished? and may I ask, what type of stream is it?
2007-03-05T16:10:00.000Z	meezyfuh	abelstr	can we go pm if you don't mind?
2007-03-05T16:10:00.000Z	abelstr	meezyfuh	ok
