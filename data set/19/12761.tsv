2005-07-10T13:25:00.000Z	nickrud		kolas you need to make your partition an option user in fstab
2005-07-10T13:26:00.000Z	kolas	nickrud	so, w/dev/hda5       /mnt/stock      ext3    defaults        0       2
2005-07-10T13:26:00.000Z	kolas	nickrud	sorry, how to change this line then : /dev/hda5       /mnt/stock      ext3    defaults        0       2 ?
2005-07-10T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud		kolas 'defaults,user' is the only change you should need i think
2005-07-10T13:27:00.000Z	kolas	nickrud	thanks
2005-07-10T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud		kolas that's from memory, I think it works
2005-07-10T13:28:00.000Z	kolas	nickrud	it means that it would appear on any user's desktop, and being read-writable, right ?
2005-07-10T13:30:00.000Z	nickrud		kolas without testing it again, yes I do believe that is correct
2005-07-10T13:31:00.000Z	nickrud		kolas hm, actually, I think it would be read writeable to the original mounter, actually
2005-07-10T13:32:00.000Z	nickrud		actually :)
2005-07-10T13:35:00.000Z	nickrud	HrdwrBoB	a question: all things relative, is it worth my money buying a 64bit top end, or staying with a 32bit top end?
2005-07-10T13:36:00.000Z	nickrud		do you run 64bit, and do you have a chroot for the 32 bit stuff?
2005-07-10T13:38:00.000Z	nickrud		but, my question really revolves around getting the 32bit stuff on a 64 bit system. And, since I have not had any chance to keep over the last 6 montsh
2005-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	nickrud		hm, so, 32 bit is still the best bet so far, you think.
2005-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	nickrud		so, to keep on the cutting edge (not bleeding) 32bit on 64bit is still the most productive, then
2005-07-10T13:42:00.000Z	kolas	nickrud	it didn't work
2005-07-10T13:43:00.000Z	nickrud		kolas yes.
2005-07-10T13:44:00.000Z	nickrud		My thinking was for a single user, I'm not sure how to make a partition show up on the gnome-desktop for every user on a box
2005-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	kolas	nickrud	do you know another solution ?
