2008-09-01T15:06:00.000Z	BonezAU		but I can describe the hardware
2008-09-01T15:07:00.000Z	BonezAU		OK i will reboot and come back on irc on my laptop shortly
2008-09-01T15:08:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	use grep. ie lspci | grep Ethernet
2008-09-01T15:12:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	nvidia nforce chipsets were very good
2008-09-01T15:54:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	ok, i will try that, thx
2008-09-01T15:46:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	video drivers?
2008-09-01T15:47:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	its a fresh install, as in, i took out the cd and rebooted.
2008-09-01T15:47:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	IIRC nvidia cards dont support multiple screens with the free driver ,
2008-09-01T15:48:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	I would have expected that the default behavior would be to just bring up 1 monitor, like a fresh install of windows... strange that I have to unplug one of the monitors completely?
2008-09-01T15:49:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	i prolly agree but with regard to computers (any OS) i never assume
2008-09-01T15:49:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	ok so I will install the proprietory driver and see what happens
2008-09-01T15:50:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	i take it it is a nvidia card?
2008-09-01T15:50:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	yes, 9600GT rev 161 / 512mb
2008-09-01T15:50:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	ok i think the prop drivers will do the trick for you
2008-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	do you recommend the ones in the repos or using something like envyng? or the actual nvidia driver?
2008-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	plus the nvid gui is a lot easier to config 2 screens than wrestling with the xorg file
2008-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	repo
2008-09-01T15:52:00.000Z	BonezAU	koshar2	it says "nvidia_new" ENABLED, NOT IN USE
2008-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	koshar2	BonezAU	i also found a bug installing the prop drivers via the restricted driver applet, i prefer to install them through apt/synaptic.
