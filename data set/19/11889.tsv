2005-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	flibble		image even
2005-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	flibble		including all the empty space
2005-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	flibble		no compression
2005-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	flibble		so, you have 40gig image
2005-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	flibble		lol
2005-11-06T06:15:00.000Z	flibble		useless
2005-11-06T06:16:00.000Z	flibble		so what? all you need is the files
2005-11-06T06:16:00.000Z	flibble		dd is great for somethings
2005-11-06T06:16:00.000Z	flibble		i think you miss the point of a *backup*
2005-11-06T06:17:00.000Z	flibble		you don't want a backup that is the same size as your system
2005-11-06T06:17:00.000Z	edddi3	flibble	people can get .tar.bz2 it... compression isn't a problem
2005-11-06T06:19:00.000Z	edddi3	flibble	don't do `dd if=/dev/hd*' but `dd if=/mount/*' or whatever you want
2005-11-06T06:20:00.000Z	flibble	edddi3	let's ay you have a 200gig drive... dd will make a 200gig image of the drive.. which then you want to tar. i'm suggesting that a tar of the files on the 200gig drive, say 20gig of files... will be a lot smaller
2005-11-06T06:20:00.000Z	edddi3	flibble	thats if you dd the actual /dev/* address
2005-11-06T06:21:00.000Z	flibble	edddi3	you'll still be imaging all the empty space when you if=/mount/*
2005-11-06T06:21:00.000Z	edddi3	flibble	I'll try it some time and return it back to you :)
2005-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	edddi3	flibble	I think you're right, because dd won't let me dd a folder
2005-11-06T06:26:00.000Z	flibble	edddi3	dd is great for perect images
2005-11-06T06:27:00.000Z	edddi3	flibble	do you know any channels that offer programming support?
