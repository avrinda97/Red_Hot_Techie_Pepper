2010-08-07T22:11:00.000Z	theredundant		hi there, is there a way i could login as root? (linux nub here)
2010-08-07T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	do not login as root
2010-08-07T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	do not login as root if you don't know what you're doing
2010-08-07T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	ubuntu has put a lot of effort into the sudo security model
2010-08-07T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	what file ?
2010-08-07T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	then you don't need to be root, as the file is owned by you
2010-08-07T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	don't use sudo -s to create files
2010-08-07T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	then the permissions will always be the users
2010-08-07T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	you should never create files in /
2010-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	what are you trying to edit
2010-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	why ?
2010-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	no you don't
2010-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	what instructions
2010-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	can you please show me the URL you are following
2010-08-07T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	ok - you're using 10.04 yes ?
2010-08-07T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	ok, so the line that says 10.04 does not support java 5 is not alarming to you
2010-08-07T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	that guide is telling you to add repo's from an old ubuntu version (totally unsupported with 10.04)
2010-08-07T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	I would strongly advis eyou not to add that line if you want to keep your system usable
2010-08-07T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	theredundant	no idea, but that guide is giving out dangerous information
