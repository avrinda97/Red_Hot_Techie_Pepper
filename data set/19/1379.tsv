2011-02-09T08:04:00.000Z	RealNewNow		can someone point me in the right direction on finding sound drivers for this card:   ATI Technologies Inc Manhattan HDMI Audio [Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series]
2011-02-09T08:05:00.000Z	vesayth	RealNewNow	ATI HD 5000 series audio drivers are really buggy
2011-02-09T08:05:00.000Z	vesayth		even if you get it working it will likely be quiet sound
2011-02-09T08:06:00.000Z	RealNewNow	vesayth	thanks.  are there *any* drivers available that you knnow of?
2011-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	vesayth		realnewnow: I played with it before and tossed it when i realized they were crap, but hold on i'll see if i can look it up again real quick

2011-02-09T08:08:00.000Z	RealNewNow		ok, this is going to sound real noobieish, but how do I turn off the joins/parts in xchat?
2011-02-09T08:08:00.000Z	RealNewNow		be gentle with me.
2011-02-09T08:09:00.000Z	RealNewNow		yikes.  can't even follow the conversations

2011-02-09T08:10:00.000Z	vesayth		realnewnow: I just realized something - what kind of cable are you using?
2011-02-09T08:11:00.000Z	vesayth		is it HDMI-HDMI or DVI-HDMI?
2011-02-09T08:11:00.000Z	RealNewNow		cable?
2011-02-09T08:11:00.000Z	vesayth		or are you using a DVI-HDMI adaptor + HDMI cable
2011-02-09T08:12:00.000Z	vesayth		theanarchist: msdos or guid, i suggest msdos though
2011-02-09T08:12:00.000Z	vesayth		unless you plan on hackintoshing..
2011-02-09T08:13:00.000Z	RealNewNow	vesayth	 OH, no neither one.  It's on my hp pavillion dv7-4177nr notebook.  the irc command you gave me is giving me no joy.
2011-02-09T08:13:00.000Z	vesayth		realnewnow: how are you connecting your audio then? is it directly into the laptop?
