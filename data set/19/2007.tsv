2010-08-01T06:07:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	where do you get stuck?
2010-08-01T06:08:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	Well I was using proftpd, and it all worked but I was locked to my users area, i couldn't go to /var/www.  I tried changing the DocumentRoot but it didn't work, it still wouldn't let me in.
2010-08-01T06:09:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	you talk in riddles
2010-08-01T06:11:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	I installed the ProFTPD server, it all worked fine and I could connect to it, however I was jailed to my home directory, I couldn't change to /var/www (which is where I want to go).  I tried changing the DocumentRoot in proftpd.conf, but that didn't help at all.
2010-08-01T06:14:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	take a look at DefaultRoot and DefaultChdir
2010-08-01T06:14:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	 I changed DefaultRoot, but it didn't work at all.
2010-08-01T06:14:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	restarted ftpd and logged in again?
2010-08-01T06:15:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	Yes
2010-08-01T06:16:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	drop the statements
2010-08-01T06:17:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	What do you mean?
2010-08-01T06:17:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	and did you change them on the right section?
2010-08-01T06:17:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	I changed DocumentRoot to /var/www/ in proftpd.conf
2010-08-01T06:18:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	turn debugging on and see which decisions proftpd takes
2010-08-01T06:18:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	how do I do that?
2010-08-01T06:19:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	sudo apt-get install proftpd-doc
2010-08-01T06:21:00.000Z	gotroot	hspaans	Now everytime I connect it says my password is incorrect...
2010-08-01T06:21:00.000Z	hspaans	gotroot	read the logfiles
