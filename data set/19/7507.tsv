2007-09-07T16:49:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong		How do I get permission to unzip a file into a root folder?
2007-09-07T16:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	unzip as root via sudo
2007-09-07T16:50:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong	scguy318	What's the exact command, please?
2007-09-07T16:51:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	gksudo file-roller for the GUI
2007-09-07T16:53:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong	scguy318	It still says I don't have permission to extract archives even after using gksudo.
2007-09-07T16:53:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	hmmm, sudo -s, then file-roller?
2007-09-07T16:54:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong	scguy318	I'm sorry, I'm a total newbie...can you please spell it out for me? What exactly would I type into the terminal?
2007-09-07T16:54:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	sudo-s, then file-roller :)
2007-09-07T16:54:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	its the GUI for archive extraction, isn't it?
2007-09-07T16:54:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	what's the command that you are using to extract?
2007-09-07T16:55:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong	scguy318	That's what I'm asking you! lol
2007-09-07T16:56:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	you asked how to extract with root permission, just do gksudo file-roller and then open the archive from it
2007-09-07T16:56:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong	scguy318	We're not speaking the same language, here.....
2007-09-07T16:58:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	okay, tell me what you are doing when you encounter the root permission issue?
2007-09-07T16:58:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	I would simply do Alt-F2, gksudo file-roller, enter pass, open archive, extract to w/e
2007-09-07T16:59:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	sudo unzip zipfile.zip -d/whereveritis?
2007-09-07T16:59:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	or just launcher gksudo file-roller to get GUI with root permission
2007-09-07T05:01:00.000Z	Evilbadwrong	scguy318	Thank you, that worked. Sorry for the misunderstandings.
2007-09-07T05:02:00.000Z	scguy318	Evilbadwrong	np, we're here to learn :)
