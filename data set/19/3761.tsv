2009-06-17T00:59:00.000Z	TinFury		Someone help! :| I've installed UBUNTU on an old laptop....A sony X505.... ub version 9.04 everything is working great but files I copy to the system get corrupted..
2009-06-17T01:00:00.000Z	TinFury		I think they are mostly large files but I'm not sure. Someone give me advice on checking what's wrong
2009-06-17T01:00:00.000Z	TinFury		johathan... Well I copied a movie to it via FTP... then when I got home I tried to DL the file via FTP again.... xfer stops half way thru
2009-06-17T01:01:00.000Z	TinFury		Reports IO error
2009-06-17T01:01:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	just how old is this laptop?
2009-06-17T01:02:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	try a different, smaller file and see if it is corrupted or stop halfway through
2009-06-17T01:04:00.000Z	TinFury	cabrey	yea I did the small file.... transfered to ubuntu and back.... everything seems ok
2009-06-17T01:05:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	ok then it is probably the FTP server dropping it. how big is the file?
2009-06-17T01:06:00.000Z	TinFury	cabrey	the file was 650mb
2009-06-17T01:06:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	try d/l'ing the ubuntu ISO & see if it corrupts/stops, how fast is your connection? I don't want  to waste your time
2009-06-17T01:07:00.000Z	TinFury	cabrey	my connection is not that fast.... it would prob take about an hour.
2009-06-17T01:07:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	what ftp client are you using?/
2009-06-17T01:07:00.000Z	TinFury	cabrey	 I have another linux box here. I could DL a large file from a local server?
2009-06-17T01:08:00.000Z	TinFury	cabrey	bulletproof ftp
2009-06-17T01:08:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	yes try that & it *might* be the client. i always used nautilus or filezilla, I'm not familiar with that client
2009-06-17T01:15:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	it sounds like the HDD has bad sectors that the FS hasn't marked yet
2009-06-17T01:15:00.000Z	TinFury	cabrey	how can I get FS to mark them?
2009-06-17T01:16:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	you reboot in recovery mode & the menu will have something about the disk or file system check
2009-06-17T01:16:00.000Z	cabrey	TinFury	I forget what it is exactly
