2008-03-03T12:38:00.000Z	bullgard4		What is the default unit of measurement of storage size in the du command? I could not find the answer in 'man du' version 5.97 (September 2007).
2008-03-03T12:38:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	du -ha
2008-03-03T12:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	"bullgard4, du -ha" is an answer but not the answer to the question that I have put.
2008-03-03T12:41:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	it's in bytes like everything in unix
2008-05-12T16:43:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	what does xkb do

2008-08-03T22:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	Thank you very much for your help.
2008-09-16T09:23:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	is it mysql
2009-01-26T23:52:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	that is what type of encapsulation the packets have, typically Ethernet.  or Local loopback
2009-01-26T23:57:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	I do not understand you very well. What does 'Link encap: Ethernet' mean? That the packets flowing through this interface are encapsulated in Ethernet frames? And what does ' Link encap:Local Loopback ' mean then?
2009-01-26T23:58:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	it doesnt really matter - what is not working for you?
2009-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	In contrast to your opinion it does matter. --  My T42 does not thaw properly after resuming it in a local Ubuntu club and thawing it in my LAN at home.
2009-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	thaw?  like it was frozen ?
2009-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	In contrast to your opinion it does matter. --  My T42 does not thaw properly after hibernating it in a local Ubuntu club and thawing it in my LAN at home.
2009-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	Yes.
2009-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	Never heard of?
2009-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	that is a condensation/electrical issue and has nothing to do with the encapsulation
2009-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	bullgard4	hwilde	Your Linux education is insufficient. --  Thanks for a nice try.
2009-01-27T00:02:00.000Z	hwilde	bullgard4	guaranteed your problem has nothing to do with link encap.
