2006-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	rcrook	ozfrog	Bugger, I can see you can setting it in KDE, but I am not finding the numlock setting in gnome. hmmm. another reason I use KDE.,,, LOL

2006-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	ozfrog	rcrook	- I'm not racist - I am willing to switch :)
2006-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	ozfrog	rcrook	If only I knew how - some preference somewhere obviously
2006-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	rcrook		in KDE you can set it in kcontrol its under Peripherals > Keyboard
2006-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	rcrook		in KDE you can set it in kcontrol its under Peripherals > Keyboard ozfrog
2006-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	rcrook		in gnome you need to look under Settings > Keyboard
2006-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	ozfrog	rcrook	- soory - I meant choosing between gnome and KDE at boot
