2005-06-03T08:07:00.000Z	xf`		How can I disable all oss modules loaded and enable all of my alsa modules?
2005-06-03T08:07:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	that should happen by default.  hotplug is loading oss modules ahead of alsa ones?
2005-06-03T08:09:00.000Z	xf`	bob2	I get...Failed to load output plugin "alsa".  Trying defaults.
2005-06-03T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	what sound card do you have?
2005-06-03T08:10:00.000Z	xf`	bob2	What I'm really after is having my apps share sound or mix the sound
2005-06-03T08:11:00.000Z	xf`	bob2	A refund on my sound card?  It's onboard.
2005-06-03T08:11:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	not you
2005-06-03T08:11:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	what does "lsmod | grep ac97" print?
2005-06-03T08:12:00.000Z	xf`	bob2	...
2005-06-03T08:12:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	so, you have the alsa modules loaded
2005-06-03T08:12:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	if you "pkill esd", that program should work

2005-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	is the device in use?
2005-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	xf`	bob2	Nothing is running that would be using it.
2005-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	fuser -v /dev/{dsp,mixer,audio} /dev/snd/*
2005-06-03T08:25:00.000Z	bob2	xf`	ignore aoss then, and just use aplay or something
