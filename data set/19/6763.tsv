2007-12-13T17:26:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/doc/contrib/ProFTPD-mini-HOWTO-Umask.html
2007-12-13T17:27:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	did you read that document? It describes the proftpd settings for what permissions to give to new files
2007-12-13T17:27:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	about to read now
2007-12-13T17:33:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	The proftpd daemon always starts with a base mode of 0666 when creating files. Note that Umask can only be used to "take away" permissions granted by the base mode; it cannot be used to add permissions that are not there. -->  http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/doc/contrib/ProFTPD-mini-HOWTO-Umask.html
2007-12-13T17:33:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	in my proftpd, the default directory mask is 755, how can i make it automatically 775?
2007-12-13T17:34:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	yeah so proftpd can't make files executable, so you can still solve your problem by making the proftpd umask 0002
2007-12-13T17:34:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	ok ignore the "x", at least make the rw for group also set.  at least 664
2007-12-13T17:35:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	wait, i'll read further :-)
2007-12-13T17:35:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	yeah so with umask 0002 proftpd will make new files 664 and new dirs 775 (at least from that document, I don't use it myself)
2007-12-13T17:36:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	depending on your system you can also set the global umask in /etc/profile but clearly this leads to other security implications and I honestly don't know if proftpd resets it anyway
2007-12-13T17:37:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	there i see it now in gproftd configuration.  Umask 022
2007-12-13T17:37:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	make that 002 and you should be good
2007-12-13T17:40:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	what is the name of the variable mode? i can't seem to find it in configuration file, i only found the variable Umask 022 in the config file,    "Thus, with a mode of 0666, and a umask of 0022"
2007-12-13T17:42:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	The proftpd daemon always starts with a base mode of 0666 when creating files.  777 for directories.  hmm.. "always" seems this is by design? cannot be changed? :-)
2007-12-13T17:42:00.000Z	kelsin	chronosx	that's what that document says, like I said I don't use proftpd so I wouldn't know
2007-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	chronosx	kelsin	thanks, it works now, you're a god :-)
