2009-01-21T04:39:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz		what's the easiest way for me to isntall java?
2009-01-21T04:39:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz		install*
2009-01-21T04:40:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	by using synaptic or even aptitude
2009-01-21T04:40:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz		I tried using synaptic but it still says I don't have it.
2009-01-21T04:41:00.000Z	kitche		!version | freeflowcauvery
2009-01-21T04:42:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz	kitche	what one is it in synaptic?
2009-01-21T04:42:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	well there is sun-java but you do know you have java installed already correct?
2009-01-21T04:43:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz		from what I've read yes
2009-01-21T04:44:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz	kitche	but the java site is even saying that I don't have it installed.
2009-01-21T04:44:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	that's because openjdk is not Sun Java really
2009-01-21T04:44:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	you want to install a sun-java package which is in the repos
2009-01-21T04:45:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz	kitche	would that be "sun-java6-javadb?
2009-01-21T04:45:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	nope
2009-01-21T04:46:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	either jdk or jre
2009-01-21T04:46:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	also the -plugin
2009-01-21T04:46:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz	kitche	I installed sun-java6-bin and jre last night, that hasn't seemed to do anything.
2009-01-21T04:47:00.000Z	kitche	Milk_Rulz	you installed sun-java6-bin? not plugin?
2009-01-21T04:47:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz		I'm not sure,
2009-01-21T04:51:00.000Z	Milk_Rulz	kitche	Thank you, I got it now.
