2010-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	archa	Losha	and if i want to cancel it ?
2010-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	archa	Losha	just close the terminal window ?
2010-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	Losha	archa	the -P means to power down, the +15 means in 15 minutes. sudo shutdown -c to cancel (I've never tried this)
2010-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	archa	Losha	closing the terminal window will not harm my computer because a command is running ?
2010-04-29T07:36:00.000Z	Losha	archa	you probably need to keep the terminal you're using for the shutdown open...

2010-04-29T07:37:00.000Z	Losha	archa	a pleasure...
