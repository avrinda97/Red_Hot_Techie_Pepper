2006-11-06T08:39:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	is zonealarm configured by default to allow windows file-sharing?
2006-11-06T08:39:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	you might check the firewall log
2006-11-06T08:40:00.000Z	geokok	netpython	what am I looking for there\?
2006-11-06T08:42:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	if anything got blocked :-)
2006-11-06T08:42:00.000Z	geokok	netpython	everything.......maybe i should open ip range instead of ip adddress in zone alarm?
2006-11-06T08:43:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	yes or maybe zonealarm has preconfigured settings
2006-11-06T08:44:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	but in the log you ought to see the specific port that got blocked asweel
2006-11-06T08:44:00.000Z	geokok	netpython	I see ubuntu's ip with various ports all blocked...how can i open them?
2006-11-06T08:45:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	zonealarm is blocking them i presume?
2006-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	tcp/udp ubuntu ip port 445
2006-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	geokok	netpython	?what?...what should I do with that?
2006-11-06T08:48:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	you should open a port in your zonealarm in order for the ubuntu box to communicate with your windows box where apparantly zonealarm is installed,however you might know we can't possibly support non ubuntu issues :-)
2006-11-06T08:49:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	have a look at http://myy.helia.fi/~karte/samba-quickstart.html
2006-11-06T08:54:00.000Z	netpython	geokok	being able to ping is not enough:-)
