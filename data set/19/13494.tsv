2005-03-24T17:30:00.000Z	airox	agabus	Or put a line in fstab for it.
2005-03-24T17:30:00.000Z	airox	agabus	Then it will be mounted at startup.
2005-03-24T17:31:00.000Z	agabus	airox	- thanks, ill try it and then report back
2005-03-24T17:31:00.000Z	airox	agabus	ok.
2005-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	agabus	airox	- do i need to
2005-03-24T17:33:00.000Z	airox	agabus	yes, in ubuntu you have to.
2005-03-24T17:33:00.000Z	airox	agabus	If a normal user could do it then it would be bad, would it ?
2005-03-24T17:35:00.000Z	airox	agabus	You should know it :)
2005-03-24T17:35:00.000Z	airox	agabus	but you can check with cfdisk
2005-03-24T17:35:00.000Z	airox	agabus	or check which devices there are available in /dev
2005-03-24T17:36:00.000Z	agabus	airox	- mount: /dev/hdb already mounted or /media/fat32 busy
2005-03-24T17:37:00.000Z	airox	agabus	Well, do a `df` to check if it's already.
2005-03-24T17:37:00.000Z	agabus	airox	- ok how do i use df?
2005-03-24T17:37:00.000Z	airox	agabus	in your console
2005-03-24T17:38:00.000Z	agabus	airox	- ok i done it, but hdb is not in there
2005-03-24T17:38:00.000Z	airox	agabus	Does the fat32 partition reside on the same hard disk ?
