2010-12-29T08:45:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		the site is free but i think books might be better
2010-12-29T08:47:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		hope it won't take so much time to learn, i already know some c++
2010-12-29T08:48:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		yea i already met them :P but
2010-12-29T08:48:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		are they 8 bytes?
2010-12-29T08:49:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		lol ok
2010-12-29T08:49:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		are you guys pointers to books? :p
2010-12-29T08:49:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		well thanks a lot
2010-12-29T08:50:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		i'll start from the bible of c :p
2010-12-29T08:50:00.000Z	maco	stefanoDuf20	if you already know c++...just take away the STL and new(), add in malloc() and free() and you're done
2010-12-29T08:51:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		really?
2010-12-29T08:51:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		but
2010-12-29T08:51:00.000Z	maco	stefanoDuf20	pretty much....  C++ is a pile of macros on top of C
2010-12-29T08:51:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		ok just one question, do i use structs as objects?
2010-12-29T08:52:00.000Z	maco	stefanoDuf20	yep
2010-12-29T08:52:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		oh..
2010-12-29T08:52:00.000Z	maco	stefanoDuf20	technically its not supposed to be object oriented since it's C, but.... well, apparently you shouldnt inform the GNOME project of that ;-)  they use GObject all over the place
2010-12-29T08:53:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20	maco	hehe
2010-12-29T08:54:00.000Z	stefanoDuf20		anyway i think i'll buy the book anyway, for reference and, just to be sure that i don't miss anything ^^
2010-12-29T08:55:00.000Z	maco	stefanoDuf20	even seasoned C programmers should have k&r
