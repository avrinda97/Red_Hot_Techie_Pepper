2008-11-02T02:52:00.000Z	perlmonkey		greetings
2008-11-02T02:53:00.000Z	perlmonkey		I have a dual core system..do I need to install any special version of Ubuntu or set any options, to take advantage of the dual core processor?
2008-11-02T02:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	no; smp is supported by default
2008-11-02T02:55:00.000Z	perlmonkey	erUSUL	cool, thanks
2008-11-02T02:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	if you do not know just install 32 bit
2009-03-10T01:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	just configure grub to boot them
2009-03-10T01:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	you have to manually configure grub to boot the second installation
2009-03-10T01:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	mount the partition of the second hd and take a look
2009-03-10T01:05:00.000Z	perlmonkey	erUSUL	doh, obvious thanks, I think my brain is switched off tonight =)
2010-02-18T01:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	only a kernel developer can make sense of that traces. report them as bugs
2010-02-18T01:12:00.000Z	perlmonkey	erUSUL	so that is a kernel bug?
2010-02-18T01:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	yes; a kernel error
2011-04-03T21:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	what version of ubuntu ?
2011-04-03T21:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	probably .26 does not support ext4; too old
2011-04-03T21:11:00.000Z	perlmonkey	erUSUL	if I want to create a new fs, do I need to format the usb drive to remove the old one first?
2011-04-03T21:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	mkfs .... /dev/sdxx
2011-04-03T21:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	or use gparted
2011-04-08T15:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	should show up as any other disk /dev/sdxx
2011-04-08T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	perlmonkey	do « tailf /var/log/messages » and plug the disk.
