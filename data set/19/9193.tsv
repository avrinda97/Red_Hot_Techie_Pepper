2006-12-12T13:34:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	you should add it to your start up scripts normal in /etc/rc*
2006-12-12T13:37:00.000Z	sivik	rapid	which rc#.d folder and what file
2006-12-12T13:37:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	do you have a rc.local in there?
2006-12-12T13:37:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	put what ever you need in there
2006-12-12T13:38:00.000Z	sivik	rapid	what if i need to run it as sudo, is that a problem if i log in as a normal user?
2006-12-12T13:39:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	whatever in there, should be run as sudo, I presume, I am not ubuntu orientated that much.
2006-12-12T13:40:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	I have some commands running on start up that only will be run as root and they are in my rc.local running fine
2006-12-12T13:40:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	not at the moment, only a user
2006-12-12T13:52:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	didn't work?

2006-12-12T13:56:00.000Z	sivik	rapid	like a script that says "sudo mythbackend"
2006-12-12T13:57:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	I don't use sudo, so I can't help, soryr.
2006-12-12T13:57:00.000Z	sivik	rapid	what do you use instead?
2006-12-12T13:57:00.000Z	sivik	rapid	then how do you run stuff as admin without doing either sudo everytime you run a command or doing sudo su
2006-12-12T13:58:00.000Z	rapid	sivik	i su - every time
