2006-09-26T05:05:00.000Z	Happu_		Hello. How do I unmount cdrom driver? It won't open.
2006-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	Happu_		foglight: it says that umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
2006-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	Happu_		I have 2 other CD drives but they aren't mounted for some reason...
2006-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	janitor_x	Happu_	try sudo umount /media/cdrom0 ... then eject
2006-09-26T05:08:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	tried already it doesn't work :(
2006-09-26T05:09:00.000Z	janitor_x	Happu_	 could be a jammed drive?
2006-09-26T05:10:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	dunno. I can read it after all...
2006-09-26T05:10:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	it would help if the other driver would mount.
2006-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	but for somereason I don't know how to mount it
2006-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	janitor_x	Happu_	then try to mount it...
2006-09-26T05:11:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	should I try sudo mount /media/cdrom2/ ?
2006-09-26T05:12:00.000Z	janitor_x	Happu_	if the cdrom2 shows on the media directory.. then you can use that command
2006-09-26T05:13:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	mount: can't find /dev/cdrom# in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2006-09-26T05:13:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	Ok so the problem is that I don't have the cdrom in fstab... Can you tell me how to add it there?
2006-09-26T05:14:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	and I tried to replace # with numbers but it didn't wokr.
2006-09-26T05:14:00.000Z	janitor_x	Happu_	change the # to the number assignment of your drive :)
2006-09-26T05:15:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	it says the same with every number so I guess I need to add them in fstab or mtab?
2006-09-26T05:16:00.000Z	janitor_x	Happu_	i havent tried doing that yet... my system always automatically detects my drives :)
2006-09-26T05:17:00.000Z	Happu_	janitor_x	well I'll try to survive. Thanks for help :D
