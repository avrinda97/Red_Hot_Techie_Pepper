2008-04-02T01:35:00.000Z	UnSuNgLoSeR		need help people
2008-04-02T01:36:00.000Z	UnSuNgLoSeR		help required
2008-04-02T01:36:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	you have to ask a real question. I've told you this already. But I've investigated while you were gone, and might have a solution for you.
2008-04-02T01:36:00.000Z	UnSuNgLoSeR	XiXaQ	yeah wat do u have for me?
2008-04-02T01:37:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	first, install kppp.
2008-04-02T01:37:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	it's an application used for connecting to dialup networks.

2008-04-02T01:41:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	I don't know. I'm fairly sure it won't automatically connect though.
2008-04-02T01:42:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	you're connected to the modem, but has the modem logged into your internet providers network?
2008-04-02T01:42:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	have you installed kppp yet?
2008-04-02T01:43:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	kppp?
2008-04-02T01:44:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	as I said before, I don't have any experience with this, but I'll tell you what I've been told.

2008-04-02T01:47:00.000Z	UnSuNgLoSeR	XiXaQ	dude i cant run ubuntu at extra graphics!whenever i try to switch to extra graphics, it gives an error message
2008-04-02T01:48:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	that's probably because you haven't installed any drivers that supports 3d. But that's a completely different issue. Don't you think it would be wise to solve one problem at a time?
2008-04-02T01:49:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	if you include the nickname of the person you're talking to, it's alot easier to notice your messages.
2008-04-02T01:50:00.000Z	XiXaQ	UnSuNgLoSeR	I don't understand how fancy animated desktop effects is necessary in order to use ubuntu without problems. I'd think it's much more important to get connected to the internet.
2008-04-02T03:46:00.000Z	UnSuNgLoSeR	XiXaQ	am back
