2010-07-27T17:00:00.000Z	gogeta1	madrid	a updated version of linux is pretty hard to brake into
2010-07-27T17:02:00.000Z	gogeta1	madrid	just never say never there has been a few unix baddys out there all dead now
2010-07-27T17:02:00.000Z	gogeta1	madrid	but the chances are very slow
2010-07-27T17:04:00.000Z	gogeta1	madrid	well the chances are pretty darn slim and are incomptable of any windows ones
