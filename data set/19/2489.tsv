2011-06-11T07:30:00.000Z	LekeFly		I have created a startup script that should run in terminal.. how can i see the output?
2011-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	depends, do you want the output in a file?
2011-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	LekeFly	smw	no i just want to see it live : )
2011-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	or you could have the script started in a gnome-terminal
2011-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	gnome-terminal -c "path/to/script"
2011-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	LekeFly	smw	this is what i have.. but its not doing anything :p gnome-terminal -e "bash --rcfile /home/user/miner1.sh"
2011-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	however, it will quit when the script quits
2011-06-11T07:33:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	maybe it is starting and then quiting?
2011-06-11T07:35:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	gnome-terminal -x /home/user/miner1.sh
2011-06-11T07:35:00.000Z	LekeFly	smw	Just did gnome-terminal -c "path/to/script"    with " < right? didnt work here :p
2011-06-11T07:36:00.000Z	LekeFly	smw	i can run the script fine by doing ./blabla.sh
2011-06-11T07:36:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	ok
2011-06-11T07:36:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	try with -x blabla.sh
2011-06-11T07:37:00.000Z	LekeFly	smw	Do i need the path if its in my home folder?
2011-06-11T07:38:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	in theory no
2011-06-11T07:38:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	can't hurt
2011-06-11T07:38:00.000Z	smw	LekeFly	gnome-terminal -e top works for me
2011-06-11T07:44:00.000Z	LekeFly	smw	Thanks got it working now : )
