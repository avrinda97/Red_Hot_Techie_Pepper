2010-03-18T04:58:00.000Z	ilovethislinuxst		1357 people and no one can tell me how to hook up yahoo voice to a ubuntu os?
2010-03-18T05:00:00.000Z	ilovethislinuxst		i guess you have to be a smart linux person to get answers here.
2010-03-18T05:01:00.000Z	ilovethislinuxst		ubuntu linux for humans, yeah right.
2010-03-18T05:02:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	we're volunteers and we just don't know the answer. Have you tried empathy yet? perhaps it knows how to do yahoo with voice
2010-03-18T05:02:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	have you checked the forums yet?
2010-03-18T05:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	Have You Tried Empathy Yet? Have You Tried Searching The Forums For An Answer?
2010-03-18T05:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	are you ignoring the answers you're getting on purpose? there's people who are trying to help you, including me
2010-03-18T05:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	you could atleast acknowledge that the suggestions you've been given you've already tried, so people know not to suggest them again.
2010-03-18T05:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	it might just be that there is *no* app that does yahoo voice. I've not heard of a one.
2010-03-18T05:24:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	this is IRC we help several people at a time. If you want exclusive help, use forums, as I've suggested before, or pay someone to help in your problem.
2010-03-18T05:25:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	we're volunteers and we can't do magic and special tricks for you. If there is no application that does yahoo voice on linux, then we can't magically help you
2010-03-18T05:26:00.000Z	Myrtti	ilovethislinuxst	for what?
