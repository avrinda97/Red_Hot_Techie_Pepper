2008-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	Leefmc		What is a good audio editing software?
2008-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	Leefmc		Note that i personally dislike soundforge heh.. or did in the paste

2008-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	Audacity?
2008-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	Erm, sorry, thats the name. Audacity. I dislike the program
2008-06-20T05:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	that's pretty much the extent of it as far as I know...more than that and you're looking at professional grade software which costs, and they usually don't make linux ports
2008-06-20T05:55:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	k
2008-06-20T05:56:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	Audacity definitely doesn't have the quality to sound, as Blender does to 3D
2008-06-20T05:56:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	you haven't played with it enough. Audacity is a bit confusing, but it's very powerful
2008-06-20T05:56:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	It causes some bad card problems a while back for a different comp for me.
2008-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	Horrid, bad bad joojoo. IIRC, it basically broke the audio card.
2008-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	give it another try, it's a great software :D
2008-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	Any piece of software that has that neglect, i consider bad. Note that this was neglect, because it was a known bug.
2008-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	And imo, the feature or even ability to use the program, should be taken away, if they _know_ it will break the card.
2008-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	you're in the wrong channel...there have been known (major) bugs in ubuntu for a while. it's a matter of time
2008-06-20T05:58:00.000Z	Leefmc	dmsuperman	I'm in the wrong channel?
2008-06-20T05:58:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	as with firefox, and many other open source softwares. it really depends on the community developing it
2008-06-20T05:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	not ignore...just don't have time to fix
2008-06-20T05:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Leefmc	or if it's lesser used hardware it goes low on the priority list. It's all about priorities
