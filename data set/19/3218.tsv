2009-10-24T02:31:00.000Z	Mariandroid		so there is no way to reset the entire system short of a new install
2009-10-24T02:31:00.000Z	Mariandroid		?
2009-10-24T02:32:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> what was the problem? i just came in
2009-10-24T02:33:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> are you logged into it? which dir you changed perms on?
2009-10-24T02:33:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> are you logged into it now?
2009-10-24T02:34:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	 oki, I'll prefix my lines
2009-10-24T02:34:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> well if you hve managed to change several dirs under /  it will be a bit cumbersome to change it back
2009-10-24T02:35:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	so... reinstall ?
2009-10-24T02:36:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> yes, shouldnt be that long.. btw, you have your /home in a separate partition?
2009-10-24T02:36:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	yes
2009-10-24T02:36:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> then it will not be too bad to re-install, should be around 25 mins or so
2009-10-24T02:37:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	I'll keep my settings ?
2009-10-24T02:38:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	Oki, that was greek to me, but I figure I'll just go for it then
2009-10-24T02:38:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	thank you =)
2009-10-24T02:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> read the ubottu paste again, its not difficult
2009-10-24T02:41:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	there are four users...
2009-10-24T02:42:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> perhaps you can take care of that first, change the perms of respective owners of /home/username1 for example
2009-10-24T02:42:00.000Z	Mariandroid	n8tuser	guntbert: I'll try
2009-10-24T02:42:00.000Z	n8tuser	Mariandroid	-> do all four of them one by one
