2011-09-12T22:08:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	it failed to load NVIDIA kernel module
2011-09-12T22:08:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	I have nvidia-glx-185 installed... not sure how to go about configuring it though
2011-09-12T22:09:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	ok, give me a second.
2011-09-12T22:09:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	thanks
2011-09-12T22:13:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	still looking... :)
2011-09-12T22:13:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	modprobe nvidia results in FATAL error... if that means anything
2011-09-12T22:13:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.32-28-generic/modules.dep: No such file or directory  being the exact message
2011-09-12T22:14:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	hm... can you do "$ uname -a" and paste that?
2011-09-12T22:14:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	http://pastie.org/2522269
2011-09-12T22:16:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	well, but it uses the same kernel that is used normally, right?
2011-09-12T22:17:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	mangdood: http://pastie.org/2522276
2011-09-12T22:18:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	i just try to figure out if it even trys to load the correct modules for the correct kernel. So I compare 2.6...
2011-09-12T22:18:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	mangdood this may be more relevant: http://pastie.org/2522287
2011-09-12T22:18:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	and then, I just look for an apt-get way to uninstall all your nvidia stuff and reinstall it... :) But never done it with apt-get, myself... :)
2011-09-12T22:20:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	I think I did that. and that's what brought me to this state :p
2011-09-12T22:20:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	"system's kernel log", maybe that says more... but mangdood is probably right, try the open source version...
2011-09-12T22:20:00.000Z	rullie	ichbinder	mangdood http://pastie.org/2522303
2011-09-12T22:21:00.000Z	ichbinder	rullie	mangdood says it: the nvidia drivers are proprietary and not allowed. Possible that you screwed it up trying to install those instead of the default ubuntu open source ones... :)
