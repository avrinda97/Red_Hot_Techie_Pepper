2006-04-26T14:27:00.000Z	Sh33pi3s		When is 6.10 out ???
2006-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	In october
2006-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	The second number is the month, the first the year (20xx)
2006-04-26T14:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	ATI aren't as supportive as Nvidia, but they're both getting better
2006-04-26T14:34:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Maybe because they're both seeing potential of mobile stuff which Windows is too bloated for :)
2006-04-26T14:35:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Only lack of support from non-free people (like macromedia)
2006-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Ask XP users :)
2006-04-26T14:37:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Basically you get the same "problems" running Ubuntu on amd64 as you do with PowerPC. They are not Ubuntu's problems, they are third paty's
2006-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	Sh33pi3s	Warbo	 so it`s down to the 3rd party apps and if the vendors decide to make then 64 bit ?
2006-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Basically there is no 64bit Flash because Macromedia ahven't made it and there is no 64bit (PC) Quicktime because Apple haven't made it
2006-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	Sh33pi3s	Warbo	but if you can get the source .... see my point ?
2006-04-26T14:40:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Yes, that's the idea. You can make a 32bit system inside your 64bit system just to run these apps. It's in a Wiki somewhere
2006-04-26T14:40:00.000Z	Sh33pi3s	Warbo	i didn`t think that was possible ?
2006-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	You can run 32bit progs on 64bit PC. By installing a basic 32bit system in chroot you can make links to them in your 64bit system.
2006-04-26T14:42:00.000Z	Sh33pi3s	Warbo	i`m guessing it`s time to visit wiki to find out about if it`s worth it at this time.
2006-04-26T14:42:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	I would say it is worth it, just so you don't have to redo everything in the future. I will find the Wiki for you
2006-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	Sh33pi3s	Warbo	thanks. u can understand my reluctance to go fully with regards to not being able to run 32 bit stuff inside 64bit OS
2006-04-26T14:44:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	This is what I got from Google that is Ubuntu specific: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575
2006-04-26T14:48:00.000Z	Warbo	Sh33pi3s	Type server when installing
