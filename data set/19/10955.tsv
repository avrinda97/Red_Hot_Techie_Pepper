2006-05-13T07:35:00.000Z	babo		Hi guys, can anyone have a look at my apache virtual host config for me ... ? All my domains point to my default domain. I don't know what's wrong. I've checked the docs and everything. If some apache wizard out there could  take a peek it'd be much appreciated ... :-)
2006-05-13T07:35:00.000Z	arrick1	babo	did you post it yet?
2006-05-13T07:36:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	I sent you a message ...

2006-05-13T07:43:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	I have no idea how to do that dude ... :-(
2006-05-13T07:44:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	I click on the pastebot link - nothing happens ...
2006-05-13T07:44:00.000Z	arrick1	babo	I think all you need is to remove the :80 cause they go default to 80 no matter what
2006-05-13T07:45:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	tried that as well, it just tells me it can't establish connection .... :-(

2006-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	ok tried it ... still not working though ... :-(
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	arrick1	babo	do you have the apache2.conf pasted anywhere?
2006-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	just a sec ...
2006-05-13T07:54:00.000Z	babo	arrick1	it's a remote server and I just have a terminal installed. So I can't really just cut and paste it. I can copy it locally though if you think it'd help. I've also posted a copy of my httpd -S output ... http://pastebin.com/704595
2006-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	arrick1	babo	are you accessing through windows?
