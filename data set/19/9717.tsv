2006-09-25T08:14:00.000Z	wetduck		I just istalled Java on my Ubuntu but I cannot access javac command, does anyone here have any idea about it ?
2006-09-25T08:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	maybe you instaled the jre not the jsdk
2006-09-29T11:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	only if you install in oem mode. and you only do that if you have a good reason
2006-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	Ok, I did that, don't know why, and I worked in it per almoust a week. Today I decided to start my *official* account and all folders I used to have in /Desktop are gonne. Do you have any idea about there it could be?
2006-09-29T12:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	you used the oem accaunt untill today? and now created a new user and you are using it. the files you created so far are still afaics in the oem home folder
2006-09-29T12:00:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	yes, more or lass like that.
2006-09-29T12:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	as i said the files must be in the oem home folder
2006-09-29T12:01:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	in fact I dont need to create a new account but access my acount.
2006-09-29T12:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	make a search in the whole system for the files they must be somewhere
2006-09-29T12:02:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	I did that. Nothing found in the hole system.
2006-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	i've never set up a oem install so i do not know what may have happened maybe when you created the new user the oem accaunt got deleted....
2006-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	maybe the only way to access those is login as oem, but that doesn't work anymore tha way it used to work before I activate this account I am in now.
2006-09-29T12:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview have you runned 'sudo oem-config-prepare'?? becouse that deletes the oem account
2006-09-29T12:06:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	yes I run 'sudo oem-config-prepare'
2006-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	then as the wiki page says the oem account get deleted and your files probably are gone :( sorry
2006-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	My lord I used to have important stuff there. Is there a way to log as root in Ubuntu?
2006-09-29T12:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	'sudo -i' gives you a root shell but i'm afraid that will not be of much help...
2006-09-29T12:11:00.000Z	wetduck	erUSUL	yes, I am not trying to recover that files through that. I just want to open some extra painesl that an oem account have.
2006-09-29T12:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	wetduck	 apt-cache search undelete try this utilities i've never done so myself but may be the only thing you can do
