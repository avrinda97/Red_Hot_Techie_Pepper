2008-10-18T20:27:00.000Z	thomasite		I'm using a laptop. It's an Acer Aspire 5570ANWXCi.
2008-10-18T20:28:00.000Z	thomasite		With an Intel Core Solo Processor T1350 (1.86GHz, 533 MHz FSB) and 1.5Gigs RAM
2008-10-18T20:28:00.000Z	thomasite		So it's just all right? Thanks. I'd been thinking 50-55 Celsius is harmful already.
2008-10-18T20:29:00.000Z	thomasite		Aside from lm-sensors, what other software that measures CPU temperature can you recommend?
2008-10-18T20:29:00.000Z	thomasite		thanks, goat|lappy.
2008-10-18T20:29:00.000Z	thomasite		speedfan is another software that measures cpu temperature?
2008-10-18T20:31:00.000Z	thomasite		It doesn't mention coretemp, HymnToLife.
2008-10-18T20:31:00.000Z	thomasite		There's an "acpi" on the sensors tab, though.
2008-10-18T20:32:00.000Z	thomasite		I just typed in "sensors" in the terminal and it said: The program 'sensors' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install lm-sensors.
2008-10-18T20:32:00.000Z	thomasite		This is very odd, considering that I have already installed lm-sensors.
2008-10-18T20:32:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	what does "apt-cache policy lm-sensors | grep Installed" say?
2008-10-18T20:33:00.000Z	thomasite	LjL	It says Installed: none.
2008-10-18T20:34:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	then you did not install lm-sensors
2008-10-18T20:35:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	"sensors", just as you were trying to do earlier
2008-10-18T20:35:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	you might need to configure your sensors first, though
2008-10-18T20:36:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	so do that
2008-10-18T20:37:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	i suggest so
2008-10-18T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	you can never really be sure the readings are accurate
2008-10-18T20:48:00.000Z	LjL	thomasite	there might be a way to configure the applet to use the lm-sensors modules data rather than ACPI
