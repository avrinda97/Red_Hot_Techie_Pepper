2008-09-25T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	considering we are doing this for kicks and free you cant actually moan
2012-10-26T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	for a browser issue, I wouldn't go for a reinstall
2012-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	 I didn't. But apparently no one knew how to fix the issue with the download dialog box not showing up
2012-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	did you rename ~/.mozilla/firefox ?
2012-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	no because that would have erased all my preferences
2012-10-26T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	It doesn't erase anything, note the word RENAME
2012-10-26T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	you can restore favourites from backup etc, or sync to the web and you have no issues
2012-10-26T01:31:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	it creates a new profile and thus all your extentions and favourites and stuff
2012-10-26T01:32:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	it was an easy fix nonetheless
2012-10-26T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	yes, but the old stuff would be in the folder you renamed to, wouldn't it?
2012-10-26T01:32:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	it's still a tedious task to move from one profile to another my solution was easier
2012-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	 echo > ~/.mozilla/firefox/downloads.sqlite
2012-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	ahhhh
2012-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	I don't have that issue, I use Chrome, all synced up. Log in and the settings flow in
2012-10-26T01:34:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	I use chrome too
2012-10-26T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	chromium  isn't chrome :)
2012-10-26T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	why 2 browser?
2012-10-26T01:35:00.000Z	afallenhope	ActionParsnip	I'm a developer I need to know what a site looks / functions on both browsers
2012-10-26T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	afallenhope	makes sense, I always ask when folks have multiple browsers :)
