2006-01-08T07:05:00.000Z	kemik	thegladiator	 my browsers used to crash frequently.. my RAM was bad
2006-01-08T07:05:00.000Z	thegladiator	kemik	i have to chcek my RAM
2006-01-08T07:06:00.000Z	kemik	thegladiator	 mmh, better run memtest a few runs
2006-01-08T07:06:00.000Z	thegladiator	kemik	how ?
2006-01-08T07:06:00.000Z	kemik	thegladiator	 no necessarily, it sometimes frooze my comp, sometimes just shutdown apps on random
2006-01-08T07:07:00.000Z	kemik	thegladiator	 it's an option in your grub-menu when you restart your computer
2006-01-08T07:07:00.000Z	thegladiator	kemik	whats the command from terminal ? for memtest ?
2006-01-08T07:07:00.000Z	kemik	thegladiator	 it cant be run from command, you have to restart and run it "exclusively" (since nothing can be loaded in rAM whilst testing)
2006-01-08T07:18:00.000Z	kemik	thegladiator	 i dont think a re-installation should be neccessary
