2011-02-04T08:34:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	dont' you have to use htat key thing
2011-02-04T08:35:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	when you frist encrypt the drive it gives you some long key or something I thought.
2011-02-04T08:35:00.000Z	ryan-c|w	histo	it does.  I didn't record it.
2011-02-04T08:35:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	well you need that not your login passphrase
2011-02-04T08:36:00.000Z	ryan-c|w	histo	ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase unlocks the mount passphrase with the login password
2011-02-04T08:37:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	hrm..
2011-02-04T08:37:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	yeah if it's mounted

2011-02-04T08:38:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	so it stopped mounting on boot?
2011-02-04T08:39:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	do you not know all your other pass phrases?
2011-02-04T08:39:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	sorry all your old passwords?
2011-02-04T08:40:00.000Z	ryan-c|w	histo	I tried all my old passwords and then remembered that i'd initially set my current password with a slight case variation which i changed to make it easier to type
2011-02-04T08:41:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	is your whole drive encrypted or just hte private folder?
2011-02-04T08:42:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	so you can decrypt the .ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase  then?
2011-02-04T08:43:00.000Z	histo	ryan-c|w	can't not can
2011-02-04T08:44:00.000Z	ryan-c|w	histo	Yes, i can decrypt .ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase
