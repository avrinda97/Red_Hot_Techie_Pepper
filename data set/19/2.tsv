2005-04-18T13:47:00.000Z	fsapo		please where can i find a basic tutorial to write a simple shell script for converting files?
2005-04-18T13:48:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	what do you need to do exactly?
2005-04-18T13:49:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	just take something.mpc decode it to temp.wav then encote temp.wav to mp3 using lame
2005-04-18T13:49:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	i have the mpc decoder.. but to make it one by one would take ages =/
2005-04-18T13:50:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	i dont know how tho get the filenames and using loop in shellscript =/
2005-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	man bash
2005-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	in the documentation search for "for"
2005-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	but how i m going to find out how to get the file names?
2005-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	also.. you can look at some scripts in /etc/init.d/ as an example
2005-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	the same way you do in shell
2005-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	thanx i ll take a look
2005-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	a script is nothing more than a defined sequence of commands that you would run manually
2005-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	yes i know it.. but i dont know how shell script takes the filenames
2005-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	it depends if you want N file names or one file names.. it really depends on what you need to do
2005-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	i need it to convert all files in a dir like music01.mpc music02.mpc and output music01.mp3 music02.mp3
2005-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	start with this:
2005-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	^^
2005-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	fabbione	fsapo	from there you can expand and change as much as you want
2005-04-18T14:01:00.000Z	fsapo	fabbione	thanx :D
