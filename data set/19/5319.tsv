2008-10-01T20:36:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	sorry didn't see it
2008-10-01T20:36:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	where do I type    man wodim     and enter???
2008-10-01T20:37:00.000Z	LjL	DavidCanarias	in a console
2008-10-01T20:37:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	will try now in terminal, thks
2008-10-01T20:40:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	blank only refers to CD's and not DVD's, the same in most programs I've tried like K3b
2008-10-01T20:42:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	thanks, but it's only for deleting CD's aparently!!!
2008-10-01T20:44:00.000Z	LjL	DavidCanarias	i do believe that even though the manpage only mentions CD, it should work for DVD too
2008-10-01T20:46:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	No it doesn't work. It recognises a DVD and doesn't allow you to start..... .back to square one!
2008-10-01T21:13:00.000Z	LjL	DavidCanarias	it does say "The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+RW driver is auto-selected whenever a DVD+RW medium is found in an appropriate writer. [...] Note that for unknown reason, the DVD-Plus alliance does not like that there is a simulation mode nor a way to erase DVD+RW media."
2008-10-01T21:17:00.000Z	LjL	DavidCanarias	there is a thread at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=623889 , not that it seems very informative
2008-10-01T21:19:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	Thks again..... My heads spinning as I am using a DVD-RW. I've discovered some plugins are missing. One called growisofs which I will try. I have it downloaded in a tar.gz file and need to find out how to install it? Any help your end?
2008-10-01T21:20:00.000Z	LjL	DavidCanarias	do NOT try to install tarballs. growisofs is available in the dvd+rw-tools package, "sudo apt-get install dvd+rw-tools"
2008-10-01T21:22:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	Thks for some positive news and will go thru the terminal. I'll keep u all informed!!!
2008-10-01T21:24:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	I did the install and retried Braser and it says the same thing about the plugins!!!! What a problem eh???
2008-10-01T21:27:00.000Z	LjL	DavidCanarias	try perhaps dvd+rw-format -blank /dev/whatever
2008-10-01T21:28:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	LjL	I tried that, but nothing!!!!! Seems to be the solution just overwriting as beli and Pici say
