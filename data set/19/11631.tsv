2005-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell		Hello, anyone here versed in Ubuntu for PPC?
2005-12-18T16:06:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell		Can someone please tell me how I can get my iBook late 2001 to see any ubuntu install CD?
2005-12-18T16:07:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell		I can mount them on th desktop, but I can't get the damn thing to see it as a boot device
2005-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	Jaymac	DuoMaxwell	You haven't done what I once did and copied the iso to the disc rather than burned it?  That one made me go a bit red :O
2005-12-18T16:09:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	Not that new lol
2005-12-18T16:10:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	I tried the startup disk prefs, the holding of command C on boot and holding alt on boot to bring up the list of bootable devices
2005-12-18T16:11:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	I always use toast
2005-12-18T16:11:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	yes, the 5.04 live CD, but it ceased every time halfway through boot
2005-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	I've tested a few linuxs in the last few months, but I still know nothing of it, but I have managed to boot Linspire 5-0 live CD in VirtualPC
2005-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	nothing I can make out. I get lost fast in the command line since I haven't used one in like 6+ years
2005-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	and that was DOS
2005-12-18T16:22:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	exactly what I was thinking lol
2005-12-18T16:27:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	I thought you had to pay for that one
2005-12-18T16:28:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	I know theres quite a few PPC linuxs now, I saw a list not to long ago
2005-12-18T16:38:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	no prob man, I'll try some other stuff, maybe that homwbre of slackware for Macs Slackintosh will boot this thing
2005-12-18T16:42:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	I haven't tried Kubuntu, I wonder if it may work, but I think I heard that KDE doesn't handle older systems to good
2005-12-18T17:16:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	Since when? How much did I miss since I've been working this job where I have no time?
2005-12-18T17:17:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	What? the switch to intel?
2005-12-18T17:28:00.000Z	DuoMaxwell	Jaymac	whats baffeled me is that I remember seeing that Apple and IBM worked with AMD on the Athlon64 and I wouldn't mind seeing a dual core Optron running OS X, hell even Sun is using them
