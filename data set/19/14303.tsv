2004-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	cef_work		anyone done an install of ubuntu amd64 on a dual opteron?
2004-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	doing one on a single opteron at the moment, why?
2004-11-02T08:14:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	cos I have a dual one here. just creating an iso at the moment *grin*
2004-11-02T08:14:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	btw: hi
2004-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	how many NICs does the box have?
2004-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	3
2004-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	hi, btw :)
2004-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	all onboard
2004-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	Intel based ones?
2004-11-02T08:16:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	onboard whatever ships on the tyan serverworks boards.. so I'm pretty sure it's intel's.. 2 x GigE, 1 x 10/100
2004-11-02T08:17:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	i've got some e1000 patches you might want to grab that, when I was running the same box with preview, latency was a killer.
2004-11-02T08:17:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	new office server. thought I'd try ubuntu on it.. *grin*
2004-11-02T08:17:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	will definitely keep that in mind
2004-11-02T08:18:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	although, i'd say the same issues will apply to final, given all the patches cleanly apply without offset to 2.6.8.1-16 :(
2004-11-05T08:18:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	morning :)
2004-11-05T08:21:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	got that dual opteron installed.. btw: the dual gigE's are broadcom's. the 3ware 9xxx card caused an install issue that I'm filing a bug about, with a work-around *grin*
2004-11-05T08:28:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	nice, I spent the last two days getting things running on the dual-celeron instead, between ACPI lockups and isapnp bugs, then having two out of the six maxtors in the machine failing miserably ... i've got a new meaning of hatred for the installer.
2004-11-07T13:19:00.000Z	ultrafunk	cef_work	dude, that could have described quite a few people :)
2004-11-07T13:19:00.000Z	cef_work	ultrafunk	shush you.. mr cream guy!
