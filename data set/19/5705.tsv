2008-05-14T02:30:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux		is there an easy way to get ubuntu to recognize the second hard drive?
2008-05-14T02:31:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	ok.. did u attach the harddrive to computer?
2008-05-14T02:31:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	yes
2008-05-14T02:31:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	it's in there
2008-05-14T02:32:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	did you mount it?
2008-05-14T02:32:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	iit was working in another distro... I tried mounting it but didn't see what I expected
2008-05-14T02:32:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	try looking at your syslog
2008-05-14T02:33:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	there is a very good wikipage about mounting on wiki.ubuntu.com
2008-05-14T02:33:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	i usually just say "mkdr /mnt/seconddrive" and then "mount /dev/hdb /mnt/seconddrive"
2008-05-14T02:33:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux		also... it sems like there would be a aguii for ths
2008-05-14T02:33:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	read the wiki it explains it a bit better.. but that does sound right. What is the file system? NTFS? EXT3? FAT32?
2008-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	you could also try to add it to your fstab and then mount -a
2008-05-14T02:34:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	it's some sort off linux parrtitioin... probably ext something
2008-05-14T02:35:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	ok try reading your syslog and see if it says anything about your harddrive :)
2008-05-14T02:36:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	where's that?
2008-05-14T02:37:00.000Z	harm	trumpetmic-linux	/var/log/syslog if iam right :)
2008-05-14T02:38:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	nthing interesting in the syslog
2008-05-14T02:38:00.000Z	trumpetmic-linux	harm	I visited your link... not seeing anything about hd stuff... did a searc htoo
