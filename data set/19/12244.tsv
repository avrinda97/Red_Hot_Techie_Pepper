2005-09-30T05:20:00.000Z	Hfuy		Whatever next, Calamitous Kangaroo?
2005-09-30T05:21:00.000Z	Hfuy		Ubuntu Linux 10.5 - Pandemic Panther.
2005-09-30T05:23:00.000Z	Hfuy		It's at times like this I wish I could just go out and BuUY
2005-09-30T05:23:00.000Z	Hfuy		...er, BUY ubuntu.
2005-09-30T05:25:00.000Z	Hfuy		Seriously, how is it possible that I'm downloading Ubuntu at 80Kb/sec on 512Kbit DSL.
2005-09-30T05:25:00.000Z	Hfuy		...which usually maxes out at about 52.
2005-09-30T05:26:00.000Z	Hfuy		Are you near some source of magnetism, such as a loudspeaker?
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Hfuy		oly: Er.
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Hfuy		You know, what I really should do is to make this laptop dual-boot win2k and Ubuntu.
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Hfuy		Is this possible?
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	the installer sets that up for you
2005-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	Hfuy	Seveas	If I wanted dualboot, which would I set up first?
2005-09-30T06:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	try http://releases.ubuntu.com
2005-09-30T08:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	if that is a script, switch it off. If it isn't: #ubuntu-offtopic is the place for you
2005-09-30T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	you are using a stupid mirror
2005-09-30T08:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	the preview has been superseded by colony 4
2005-09-30T08:59:00.000Z	Hfuy	Seveas	Wonderful. I've been downloading it for so damn long, it's out of dat!
2005-09-30T09:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	it's a development release, it's out of date the moment you install...
2005-09-30T09:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Hfuy	given that you're the only one with probs, i'd say the error is on your side.
