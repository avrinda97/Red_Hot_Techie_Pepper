2008-11-12T03:54:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	it was working good, but suddenly it changed
2008-11-12T03:56:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	ibex
2008-11-12T03:58:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	everything seems to be ok
2008-11-12T03:58:00.000Z	DasEI	gonzaloaf_laptop	tried the dpkg  ?
2008-11-12T03:59:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	it is running
2008-11-12T03:59:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	what is it doing really?
2008-11-12T04:00:00.000Z	DasEI	gonzaloaf_laptop	it sets basic system specs, the keyboard, too
2008-11-12T04:02:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	its like regenerating system specs
2008-11-12T04:02:00.000Z	DasEI	gonzaloaf_laptop	yup, reconfiguring
2008-11-12T04:05:00.000Z	DasEI	gonzaloaf_laptop	did it help ?
2008-11-12T04:06:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	still running
2008-11-12T04:20:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	it didnt help
2008-11-12T04:22:00.000Z	DasEI	gonzaloaf_laptop	hm , if dpkg-reconfigure console-setup  also doesn't help, I have no idea, maybe a mechanical defect
2008-11-12T04:25:00.000Z	gonzaloaf_laptop	DasEI	solved just re-logging! but it isnt a good solution
