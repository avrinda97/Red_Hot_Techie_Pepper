2005-04-16T13:54:00.000Z	Misogynist		Windows is a bit of a strange beast in that there are very few applications on the platform that seem "native".
2005-04-16T13:55:00.000Z	Misogynist		Yeah, Fedora is okay now that they finally caught up with a halfway-decent package manager
2005-04-16T13:55:00.000Z	Misogynist		But the upgrade process still kind of sucks
2005-04-16T13:55:00.000Z	Misogynist		It's basically "back up, flatten, install new version"
2005-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	Misogynist		Certainly less convenient than apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	Misogynist		Yeah, SuSE 7.3 was my first distro
2005-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	Misogynist		Though in hindsight there wasn't much reason for me to use it since I basically jumped in the deep end after installing it anyway
2005-04-16T13:57:00.000Z	Misogynist		Three days in I had a custom-compiled kernel and I had recompiled KDE for anti-aliased fonts
2005-04-16T13:57:00.000Z	Misogynist		Breaking damn near my entire system in the process but it was a learning experience :)
2005-04-16T13:57:00.000Z	Misogynist		I'm more excited about Cairo/Glitz hopefully not making GTK+ stupidly slow
2005-04-16T13:58:00.000Z	holycow	Misogynist	i'm excited about the whole stack
2005-04-16T13:58:00.000Z	holycow	Misogynist	gtk2? you mean gnome?
2005-04-16T14:05:00.000Z	holycow	Misogynist	lol
2005-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	Misogynist	holycow	Correct
2005-07-07T10:26:00.000Z	Misogynist	holycow	I don't think you've ever touched Internet Explorer's box model
2005-07-07T10:27:00.000Z	holycow	Misogynist	correct, you avoid that which is a: wrong and b: doesn't work
2005-07-07T10:27:00.000Z	Misogynist	holycow	People like you are why the world doesn't take Linux and its users seriously. Drop the zealotry, and we'll continue this conversation. Otherwise, goodbye.
2005-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	holycow	Misogynist	on the other hand, people like me drop cross browser websites out that work everywhere, and clients love us
2005-07-07T10:29:00.000Z	holycow	Misogynist	indeedy, i wish itwere otherwise and we could drop the tables forever
