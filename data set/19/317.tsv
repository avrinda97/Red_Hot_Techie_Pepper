2012-06-12T05:50:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_		The command "sudo chmod -R 775 /home/xxx/Documents" doesn't seem to work as I continuously have to put a new document there as sudo...
2012-06-12T05:51:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	(a) you shouldnt need sudo with chmod, only with chown. (b) you need to change your umask or (c) setuid/setgid on the folder
2012-06-12T05:52:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	that was a lot of new things..
2012-06-12T05:52:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	I need sudo when root is the owner lol:P
2012-06-12T05:53:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	would you mind explaining how to do those things then..?:)
2012-06-12T05:53:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	why does root own files in your folder?
2012-06-12T05:55:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	no idea..
2012-06-12T05:56:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	my home folder is owned by the user (sirriffsalot)... but I moved the files within with "sudo cp -rp" so I have no idea..
2012-06-12T05:56:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	can you help me fix this?
2012-06-12T05:56:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	why would you move files with sudo?
2012-06-12T05:57:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	because otherwise a few files could not be moved. But I did -recursive preserve, so they should not be this way
2012-06-12T05:57:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	can you help me or not??
2012-06-12T05:57:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	i think you are in the "i dont understand how things are working so I'm throwing sudo into the mix pattern" which means that now you have sudo problems on top of your original problem
2012-06-12T05:58:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	nvm, I'll spend more time finding out myself
2012-06-12T05:58:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	so first you should "sudo chown -R username:username ~/Desktop" and anywhere else in your home directory that you have used sudo cp into
2012-06-12T05:58:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	that will change ownership so that the files are yours
2012-06-12T06:04:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	thank you.:)
2012-06-12T06:05:00.000Z	escott	sirriffsalot_	if you have some folder you cant move files out of ask the channel, don't go dumping sudo in front of everything that gives you trouble
2012-06-12T06:05:00.000Z	sirriffsalot_	escott	shall do, appreciate your time!
