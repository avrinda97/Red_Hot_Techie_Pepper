2010-07-25T14:34:00.000Z	ravibn		I have a strange help with my printer HP deskjet F300 any help is appreciated
2010-07-25T14:34:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	what's the problem?
2010-07-25T14:37:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: so what do you think abt this problem ?
2010-07-25T14:37:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	try printing an ubuntu test page from the printer manager
2010-07-25T14:37:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	if that works then it's not your printer
2010-07-25T14:38:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	the printers not your problem that is
2010-07-25T14:38:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	:  where is this printer manager
2010-07-25T14:39:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: ????
2010-07-25T14:39:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	currently using the dreaded XP... at a guess I'd say System>Preferences? or maybe Administration
2010-07-25T14:40:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: that is only printer configuration
2010-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: I used win XP to print on the same printer and it does the job so there is no problem with the printer at all
2010-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	there should be an option to print a test page in the printer preferences (sorry, I'm currently using XP, therefore don't have my ubuntu install to reference)
2010-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	oh ok
2010-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	what exactly are you trying to print?
2010-07-25T14:42:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: any document you take and print it just ejects a blank page after moving the printer head
2010-07-25T14:43:00.000Z	tr33m4n	ravibn	try deleting the printer from the print manager, and add it again
2010-07-25T14:45:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: I hv given the print the test page let me see what comes out
2010-07-25T14:47:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: in the printer Q it displays as processing
2010-07-25T14:51:00.000Z	ravibn	tr33m4n	: it completed the printing job but a blank paper
