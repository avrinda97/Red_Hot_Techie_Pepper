2006-06-08T10:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	I don't use proftp, but there's a tone of packages for it. have you searched synaptic for proftp?
2006-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	where to searh synaptic for proftp??
2006-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	clt-f , for find
2006-06-08T10:57:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	I install server dapper, and I cant see any GUI on it, and cant use clt-f
2006-06-08T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	ah.
2006-06-08T10:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	here's a command to remember: apt-cache search . I did apt-cache search proftp
2006-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	nothing happen !!
2006-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	you mean, apt-cache search found nothing, right?
2006-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	Ar2No		no, there is noting happened after I'm typing it
2006-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	that means you don't have access to proftp, most likely. replace /etc/apt/sources.list with the contents of http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 if you are using dapper.
2006-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	is that official source list from dapper??
2006-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	no it is not. (me bites his tongue over official sources)
2006-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	but they are very good, reliable sources anyway
2006-06-08T11:10:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	thanks
2006-06-08T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	Ar2No	np. good sources are necessary.
2006-06-08T11:37:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	now I can use apt-cache search ppssssxxx
2006-06-08T11:37:00.000Z	Ar2No	nickrud	then what should i do next?
