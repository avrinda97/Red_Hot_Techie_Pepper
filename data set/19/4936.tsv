2009-11-07T17:59:00.000Z	fcn		my legacy bios doesn't support booting from usb, and dumb dvd-rom doesn't read cd's (it reads dvds. dumb.). Even I have a floppy driver but don't have any floppies. Is there any method left that I can still try to install Karmic?
2009-11-07T18:01:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	my dvdrom quit reading cds too...samsung here...what're you using ?
2009-11-07T18:01:00.000Z	fcn	pronoy	mine is a fujitsu-siemens laptop
2009-11-07T18:02:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	oh laptop user...completely different platform but completely same problem :) laawl btw you could create a bootable usb thumb drive
2009-11-07T18:02:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	using that iso
2009-11-07T18:03:00.000Z	fcn	pronoy	i already created one but my dumb laptop doesn't boot from usb...
2009-11-07T18:03:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	change the boot options
2009-11-07T18:04:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	every machine having a usb port should be able to do so
2009-11-07T18:04:00.000Z	fcn	pronoy	no it's an old machine and doesn't have an option for booting from usb
2009-11-07T18:04:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	ooh...well then i guess writing that dvd is your best shot
2009-11-07T18:06:00.000Z	fcn	pronoy	is there another iso for dvds or can I just burn the 700mb iso on a dvd?
2009-11-07T18:09:00.000Z	fcn		how can i format a usb stick? (jaunty)
2009-11-07T18:10:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	select all the folder and delete em
2009-11-07T18:11:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	then show hidden files, if any delete em too
2009-11-07T18:11:00.000Z	fcn	pronoy	i wrote a bootloader on it, it's not mine so i have to make it like before
2009-11-07T18:11:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	yes, mount it and delete everything on it
2009-11-07T18:12:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	do it using command line if gui's the problem
2009-11-07T18:12:00.000Z	fcn	pronoy	will the bootloader be gone?
2009-11-07T18:12:00.000Z	pronoy	fcn	it will be "empty"
