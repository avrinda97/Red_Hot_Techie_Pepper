2011-03-30T19:43:00.000Z	Billbawb	adi11	The tool i have is called "Plop Boot Manager"
2011-03-30T19:43:00.000Z	adi11	Billbawb	what it does?
2011-03-30T19:44:00.000Z	adi11		the bios i have does not have the option "boot from usb"
2011-03-30T19:44:00.000Z	Billbawb	adi11	You boot it from the floppy, then use it to boot the usb
2011-03-30T19:44:00.000Z	adi11		you mean the floppy diskette?
2011-03-30T19:45:00.000Z	adi11	Billbawb	the diskette its missing eather.
2011-03-30T19:45:00.000Z	Billbawb	adi11	you boot the floppy, then you are presented with mediums to boot from, including usb even on computers without integrated usb boot support
2011-03-30T19:46:00.000Z	adi11		i dont have a floppy cd drive and the bios dont have option to boot from usb
2011-03-30T19:47:00.000Z	adi11		cd drive is missing. floppy disk is missing, and no boot from usb.
2011-03-30T19:47:00.000Z	Billbawb	adi11	oh, you don't have something like a 3.5 inch diskette drive, if not my mistake
2011-03-30T19:47:00.000Z	adi11	Billbawb	no.
