2011-03-31T00:25:00.000Z	llutz	keyUp	directories should be 7. 5 or 1 but not 6, 4
2011-03-31T00:26:00.000Z	keyUp	llutz	how you mean 5 or 1 but not 6 , 4 i dont understand anything i am afraid :S i am new to liux
2011-03-31T00:29:00.000Z	llutz	keyUp	no, giving full write-access to the web-server isn't a good idea
2011-03-31T00:29:00.000Z	keyUp	llutz	 so what  to do?
2011-03-31T00:30:00.000Z	keyUp	llutz	you suggest to give write permision only in directories needed?
2011-03-31T00:30:00.000Z	llutz	keyUp	keep permissions as limited as possible, yes
2011-03-31T00:31:00.000Z	llutz	keyUp	and on directories, use 755/775 but not 766/776. read "man chmod" why
2011-03-31T00:35:00.000Z	keyUp	llutz	polah thanks ill read chmod man
2011-03-31T14:28:00.000Z	keyUp	llutz	ok but when visitor open pages basiclly he executesfiles on my server through 'others' or through apache user on my server?
