2010-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	kruzztee		just select the older kernel on grub2 screen
2010-07-08T12:17:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	No luck. Still not finding the wireless adapter. lspci lists it as BCM43XG... iwconfig shows "no wireless extensions"
2010-07-08T12:17:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	try to browse the openwrt for your specific BCM
2010-07-08T12:19:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	it was BCM43XG?
2010-07-08T12:20:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Yup.
2010-07-08T12:37:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Found a USB stick that finds the network now... but it won't connect. Not sure if that's a step forward or a jump back now...
2010-07-08T12:37:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	it listed wireless networks around right?
2010-07-08T12:38:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	I currently browse this http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=239922
2010-07-08T12:40:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Giving that a shot.
2010-07-08T12:42:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	have you try broadcom-wl
2010-07-08T12:43:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	I think so. I've tried various things, but that does sound familiar.
2010-07-08T12:48:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	have you uninstalled the ndiswrapper?
2010-07-08T12:55:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	ndiswrapper removed, blacklist has nothing listed, and retrying what you have on your site.
2010-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	kruzztee	Achr	if it fails? You might want to use these steps http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1390979
2010-07-08T13:09:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Gonna give it a shot. Be back in a minute. :)
2010-07-08T13:18:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Negative. Still nothing.
2010-07-08T13:24:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	thanks for the help so far. Appreciated.
2010-07-08T13:31:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Which way do you think I should try first?
2010-07-08T13:42:00.000Z	Achr	kruzztee	Nope. Followed what you had on your site. Going to try the compiling suggestion.
