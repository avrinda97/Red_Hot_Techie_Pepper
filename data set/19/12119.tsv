2005-10-14T08:21:00.000Z	tyler_durden		ok heres what it said:unable to find the kernel source tree for the current running kernel

2005-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	tyler_durden		i believe so
2005-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	tyler_durden		E: Couldn't find package kernel-headers-2.6.12-9-386
2005-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	tyler_durden		kernel-package - A utility for building Linux kernel related Debian packages.
2005-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	tyler_durden		linux-kernel-headers - Linux Kernel Headers for development
2005-10-14T08:24:00.000Z	tyler_durden		i jsut did that, says 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2005-10-14T08:24:00.000Z	tyler_durden		so i already have it
2005-10-14T08:25:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	AND kernel-source as well?
2005-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	Do you have kernel source and headers installed?
2005-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	apt-cache search kernel-headers
2005-10-14T08:24:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-headers
2005-10-14T08:25:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	Since I assume this is against a new nvidia driver install?
2005-10-14T08:26:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	Meaning that the trouble you are having is in reference to trying to get a new nvidia kernel module compiled
2005-10-14T08:33:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	apt-cache search nvidia
2005-10-14T10:27:00.000Z	egon_spengler	tyler_durden	Run the uninstall script nvidia provides
2005-10-14T10:28:00.000Z	tyler_durden	egon_spengler	where is that?
