2009-10-26T18:24:00.000Z	kubanc		when i'm booting into ubutnu, 2 things failed to success. how can i see which one failed to load ?
2009-10-26T18:26:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	you can use dmesg
2009-10-26T18:26:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	to see the errors that happened during boot up
2009-10-26T18:27:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	with dmesg, i cannot define what went wrong, bacause there's lots of stuff
2009-10-26T18:28:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	is there any possibility to see the same stuff as it was happening when booting into ubuntu?
2009-10-26T18:28:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	fine..but atleast you can go through the error messages and I guess that would help to figure out what exactly went wrong
2009-10-26T18:33:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	did you look at those log files someone mentioned... /var/log/messages ?
2009-10-26T18:34:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	yes I did
2009-10-26T18:34:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	that dint help either?
2009-10-26T18:35:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	if from these logs we can figure what went wrong with samba...
2009-10-26T18:35:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	as i said it's hard to determine what wen't wrong, because if I search for daemon, i cannot find anything
2009-10-26T18:36:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	okey...
2009-10-26T18:37:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	then i dont have any idea how to figure that out...somehow we have to have that information..then only we can fix the problem
2009-10-26T18:38:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	yes i agree, but how can i see in those /var/log/messages. how do i search for that error, that is the same as the error in booting process?
2009-10-26T18:41:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	yeh you're right...sorry no idea on that ...
2009-10-26T18:42:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	hm, so i'm stuck at this two errors :D, not a good day for ubuntu :)
2009-10-26T18:43:00.000Z	kubanc	^mNotIntelligent	or is there any posibillity to pause the booting process?
2009-10-26T18:43:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	someone else will help you out .... :-)
2009-10-26T18:44:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	kubanc	i've never come across something like this....i mean the 'pause' thing...
