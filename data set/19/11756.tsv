2005-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	korhalf		how do i make xbindkeys launch in gnome every session?
2005-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	korhalf		i know usually its .xsession, but i think gnome ignores that

2005-12-09T06:07:00.000Z	korhalf	Seveas	I don't have a .gnomerc in my home directory, is it okay to just create one? and also, what syntax does it follow?
