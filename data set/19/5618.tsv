2008-06-10T21:56:00.000Z	linuxkrn		does hardy come with a tool to browse wifi-networks? (without having to apt-get since I don't have connectivity yet)
2008-06-10T21:57:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	the network manager comes with a simple browser
2008-06-10T21:58:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	is that under system->Administration->Network ?
2008-06-10T21:58:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	it's the network-icon thingy in the systray
2008-06-10T21:59:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	if I left click on it I see the available wireless networks
2008-06-10T21:59:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	hum, I start it and see "network settings" but no where to browse, even after unlocking
2008-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	is your wireless networking stuff working? I just left-click on that icon and the roll down menu shows the networks.. together with the wire networks
2008-06-10T22:01:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	this is kind of the way it looks, http://kirsten.urbanzone.com/blog/uploads/misc/ubuntu_network_manager.png
2008-06-10T22:01:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	well having problems with it, but I installed other tools and they seem to see networks (kismet, wifiradar, etc)
2008-06-10T22:01:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	so maybe there is a problem with mine then... I have a intel 4945 chipset
2008-06-10T22:02:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	I can't really help you setting it up... I'm just happy it worked out of the box with my laptop..
2008-06-10T22:08:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	strange, it's working now, just like that picture you sent. (roll eyes)
2008-08-15T00:41:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	I think you can "pin" them in some way
2008-08-15T00:41:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	to keep them from updating
2008-08-15T00:41:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	wouldn't have a link on that? :)
2008-08-15T00:42:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	hmm.. nope.. or wait.. hang on
2008-08-15T00:42:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	problem I have is they were installed via apt-get and don't appear on the gui package list (that you can "lock")
2008-08-15T00:43:00.000Z	linuxkrn	Slart	thanks
2008-08-15T00:43:00.000Z	Slart	linuxkrn	you're welcome
