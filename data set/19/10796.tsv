2012-09-27T22:30:00.000Z	edora		one more que icannot able to copy video files from cd/dvd on ubuntu why?
2012-09-27T22:32:00.000Z	edora		<ClientAlive> by defsult they all are in gnome desktop do a fresh install
2012-09-27T22:34:00.000Z	edora		<ikonia> installing gnome shell from ubuntu official repo do fine job and better stability
2012-09-27T22:34:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	I didn't say it wouldn't but your statement does depend on the user liking gnome-shell
2012-09-27T22:35:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	yes, video card
2012-09-27T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	what ?  user has asked why his machine appears slow, I've stated it's most likely a visual thing from his video card being poorly configured
2012-09-27T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	why are you asking what a "video" card has to do with thiat, it's pretty obvious
2012-09-27T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	what ?
2012-09-27T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	I suggest you stop talking if you are trying to say this about a video card
2012-09-27T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	what are you talking about ???
2012-09-27T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	I dont know why you are telling me this
2012-09-27T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	no-one else is talking about ram
2012-09-27T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	edora	I don't know why you are telling me this
