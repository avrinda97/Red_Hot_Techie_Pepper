2006-06-06T16:27:00.000Z	yonkeltron		anyone have a dell inspiron 6000?
2006-06-06T16:27:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	I do
2006-06-06T16:27:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	using dapper?
2006-06-06T16:28:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	does suspend work for you?
2006-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	Ummm I believe so, I've actually only tried HIbernate and that worked
2006-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	I've used that several times already -- hibernate
2006-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	hibernate worked for me too. took ages but it worked.
2006-06-06T16:30:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	could you save everything and try suspend? if it doesn't work, you may need to hard reboot.
2006-06-06T16:30:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	before hard power down, try switching to a console
2006-06-06T16:31:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	I switched over to a console, ctrl+alt+F7 fine
2006-06-06T16:32:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	i meant you should do that if suspend doesn't work before hard powering down
2006-06-06T16:33:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	I'll keep it in mind, but I don't suspend too often.  usually just hibernate and that's why I don't even know if it works right now.  The weird thing is, the keys stopped working for me, but they used to work.  Like Fn+hibernate and stuff like that
2006-06-06T16:34:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	they worked in the past, but not this time.  Weird.
2006-06-06T16:34:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	fn+f1 never worked but fn+esc still works fine for stuff
2006-06-06T16:35:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	check for sure,  alsa-oss I had no sound in Flash just like that.  Installed that one package.  bam worked.
2006-06-06T16:35:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	what worked?
2006-06-06T16:35:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	the Fn+hibernate didn't work for me on Breezy, but totally worked with Dapper
2006-06-06T16:35:00.000Z	yonkeltron	lampshade	just the opposite with me
2006-06-06T16:35:00.000Z	lampshade	yonkeltron	oh and that alsa-oss message was not for you whoops haha
