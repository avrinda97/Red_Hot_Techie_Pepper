2012-10-11T17:55:00.000Z	paulens12		i really need help?
2012-10-11T17:55:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 then you've come to the right channel
2012-10-11T17:57:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 that's not an ubuntu error
2012-10-11T17:58:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 can you boot ubutu  from a live cd/usb ?
2012-10-11T18:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 as soon as someone can help, they most certainly will
2012-10-11T18:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 what have you tried in the mean time?
2012-10-11T18:09:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 what other steps, trying to find out what's wrong?
2012-10-11T18:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 can you boot from the hard disk?
2012-10-11T18:13:00.000Z	paulens12	MonkeyDust	i didn't install it..
2012-10-11T18:13:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 what was on the pc, before you tried to install ubuntu?
2012-10-11T18:14:00.000Z	paulens12	MonkeyDust	i was gonna install it on a spare partition.
2012-10-11T18:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 yes, but what system is or was installed on it, before you tried ubuntu?
2012-10-11T18:15:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 ok, then boot the other partition and check the not-working partition from there
2012-10-11T18:15:00.000Z	paulens12	MonkeyDust	I WAS BOOTING FROM USB, NOT FROM PARTITION
2012-10-11T18:16:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 ok, but how did you use the pc, before you tried to boot from usb?
2012-10-11T18:18:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	paulens12	 i remember, MS invented something in the bios or so, so you cannot boot from anything other than windows
2012-10-11T18:20:00.000Z	paulens12	MonkeyDust	i think i could have wrongly set up the usb drive...
