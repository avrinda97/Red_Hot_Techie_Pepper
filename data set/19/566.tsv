2011-12-18T06:33:00.000Z	joe335		been trying to convince the parents to get wireless for ages but i'm the only one here who needs it
2011-12-18T06:33:00.000Z	joe335		so I have no chance!
2011-12-18T06:34:00.000Z	joe335		I used to connect it to this same laptop when it had windows as the os
2011-12-18T06:34:00.000Z	joe335		yeah, think I should.
2011-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	joe335		Yumbo, it does give windows an aditional brownie point over ubuntu for me.
2011-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	joe335		as windows never had this problem
2011-12-18T06:36:00.000Z	joe335		back to hijacking the neighbours wifi then till I can afford a router.
2011-12-18T06:37:00.000Z	joe335		thanks so much for your time though yumbo, wish i'd mentioned it was a modem earlier, could have prevented wasting your time.
2011-12-18T06:38:00.000Z	joe335		I don't really get how it would work on the same laptop in windows and not ubuntu though?
2011-12-18T06:38:00.000Z	joe335		yeah that's acceptable
2011-12-18T06:38:00.000Z	zpb0103_	joe335	its the same mac address to your ISP, so there isnt any reason why it shouldnt work
2011-12-18T06:38:00.000Z	joe335		it doesn't
2011-12-18T06:39:00.000Z	joe335		so it's more to do with the fact that windows are sneaky buggers rather than them being better
2011-12-18T06:40:00.000Z	joe335		tbh, i preferred older versions of ubuntu. had ubuntu on my old laptop and it was perfect.
2011-12-18T06:41:00.000Z	joe335		what's the router you'd reccomend Yumbo?
2011-12-18T06:41:00.000Z	joe335		and you reckon it'd be easy to set up?
2011-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	zpb0103_		what model modem do you have joe335
2011-12-18T06:44:00.000Z	joe335	zpb0103	I have a SmartAX MT882
2011-12-18T06:46:00.000Z	zpb0103_	joe335	thats got a built in router
