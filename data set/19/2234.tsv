2010-05-22T12:40:00.000Z	histo	cab00m	remove the nvidia driver and see if the system continues locking up.
2010-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	histo	cab00m	or disable it in the system > admin > hardware drivers
2010-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	histo	cab00m	it could be something else causing the problem
2010-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	cab00m	histo	ok, and for 3d (if this works)?
2010-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	histo	cab00m	well we'll have to figure that out if the nvidia driver is int he repos perhaps you can download one from nvidia.com
