2006-12-02T17:30:00.000Z	|thunder		Does anyone have qsopcast or gsopcast working on dapper or edgy ? I just CAN'T get it to build. And the only packages I can find are rpms's in chinese. And it's a really cool promgram for watching live tv via the bit-torrent protocol. It is here 'http://lianwei3.googlepages.com/home2'
