2011-09-10T04:20:00.000Z	RB2		Good Evening. I've run into a problem and it's made me a little nervous. After mounting an NTFS partition in Ubuntu and copying some data, I booted into Win 7. It wanted to run checkdisk and after that, the partition was no longer readable by Windows or Ubuntu. I'm currently doing data recovery, but I'm not sure what caused the issue.
2011-09-10T04:21:00.000Z	RB2		Some googling revealed people with similar problems with a drive that moved from Ubuntu to Win7 and back again, but no solutions or insights into what caused it.
2011-09-10T04:22:00.000Z	RB2		I've never had this issue with my WinXP/Ubuntu 10.10 dual-boot setup, just the Win7/Ubuntu 11.04 setup.
2011-09-10T04:22:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	interesting
2011-09-10T04:23:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	what does ubuntu say when it refuses to mount it?
2011-09-10T04:23:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	if I do it from Nautilus, I get that it exited with a code 2... from the prompt, no errors, it just doesn't mount.
2011-09-10T04:26:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	how are you mounting that partition on terminal?
2011-09-10T04:28:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	then you should let windows check the disk
2011-09-10T04:29:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	my plan is to let it do the checkdisk after the data is safe on a removable drive. I've had checkdisk make a bad problem worse in the past.
2011-09-10T04:30:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	if you are just accessing your files on Linux for reading, mount your ntfs read-only then
2011-09-10T04:31:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	I'm still trying to get to the bottom of why it occurred in the first place. I don't know if it was ntfs-3g or Win7 that caused the issue, so I'm hesitant to plug anything into my machine now. :(
2011-09-10T04:33:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	without any info, we cannot tell
2011-09-10T04:33:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	indeed. Just wondered if anyone has seen anything similar happen.
2011-09-10T04:34:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	but if you mounted it on linux and then a shutdown was forced without umounting it
2011-09-10T04:34:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	that might cause the partition to be marked unclean and prompt for checks to be done on it
2011-09-10T04:36:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	I've been in and out of the Live CD for a few days.. it's possible. Still doesn't explain why Windows ran the checkdisk and then I couldn't access the data. But, If I figure it out, I'll definitely come back and share anything interesting.
2011-09-10T04:37:00.000Z	mkanyicy	RB2	was the whole drive inaccessible or your data? were you able to create new files or folders into it or not?
2011-09-10T04:39:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	the first ntfs partition is fine, the second ntfs partition couldn't be mounted or accessed by Windows... Windows even still assigned it a drive letter...
2011-09-10T04:41:00.000Z	RB2	mkanyicy	I can't do much with it at the moment anyway, it's restoring 331GB to an external drive via USB 2.0.. :-S I didn't have an eSATA cable handy.
