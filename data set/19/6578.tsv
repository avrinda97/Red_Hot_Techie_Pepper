2008-01-28T16:36:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		what is wrong with the setup for encrypted volumes?
2008-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		is there any documentation on how to set up encrypted volumes with the 7.10 installer?
2008-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemHowto
2008-01-28T16:40:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	that page just seesm to say 'it works in 7.10' when my experiences disagree
2008-01-28T16:41:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	there's the expected debian-like interface on the installer, but when it's finished, it just doesn't boot
2008-01-28T16:41:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	well you asked for documentation, I personally use truecrypt on a seperate harddisk and don't encrypt any main partitino
2008-01-28T16:42:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	'feature supported' is not documentation
2008-01-28T16:42:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	well on that page was a link to a bunch of how-tos
2008-01-28T16:43:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	all of which are not designed for 7.10
2008-01-28T16:43:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	I see
2008-01-28T16:45:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	7.10 is the first version of ubuntu to allegedly support encryption out-of-the-box. except that my experience is that it doesn't work like expected, so i'm looking for the documentation that explains how it *does* work
2008-01-28T16:45:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	looks like you have to use the alternate install cd and set up lvm in it to get to the encrypted options
2008-01-28T16:46:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	i've been playing with the alt-cd for a few weeks; i've found encryption options, i've set them up the way that i'd expect it to work, with or without lvm, but when all is said and done, my systems never boot
2008-01-28T16:49:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	well I can't find anything on it, so well sry
2008-01-28T16:49:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	thanks for trying
2008-01-28T16:50:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	I find personally that encrypted the root partition slows stuff down, it might be better to have a seperate home partition encrypted
2008-01-28T16:50:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	and there are a lot of tutorials to do that floating around
2008-01-28T16:52:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	travisat	and i have worked out how to do that. however, i want a certain measure of protection from analysis of my install
2008-01-28T16:53:00.000Z	travisat	StrangeCharm_	ah well good luck on it
