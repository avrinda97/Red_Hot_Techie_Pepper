2007-01-05T13:33:00.000Z	Aggort		Can anyone help me?
2007-01-05T13:33:00.000Z	Aggort		...
2007-01-05T13:35:00.000Z	Aggort		I need some serious help. If any way possible can someone help me wipe out my hard drive?
2007-01-05T13:35:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	that's fairly simple usually.
2007-01-05T13:36:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	Through Ubuntu?
2007-01-05T13:37:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	if you're in a real fix, try "rm -rf /" as root (or via sudo).  This will wipe EVERYTHING and you will need to install from scratch.  It's famously the most risky command on linux.
2007-01-05T13:37:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	why is is so risky? I don;t even have Ubuntu instaled yet, and I pretty much ruined my windows partition by resizing it
2007-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	oh, right. The command I gave you was a linux command. It's risky because it's so simple to type, but wipes EVERYTHING on all partitions.
2007-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	So it will make my hard drive like new?
2007-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	if you want to wipe your hard drive, you should try the suggestion earlier with the livecd.
2007-01-05T13:39:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	Gparted?
2007-01-05T13:39:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	alternatively, when installing ubuntu you can choose to wipe the drive as part of the installation process.
2007-01-05T13:39:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	Yea I know, but I need Windows and isn't it wiser to install Windows first?
2007-01-05T13:40:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	it's generally simple to install windows first, yes.  I think in the windows installation you can chose to install over evertying also :-)
2007-01-05T13:41:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	The problem right now is I can't even access the install without the PC locking up altogether
2007-01-05T13:43:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	do a google search for installing windows after linux.  See if that looks too complicated for you, if so install windows first.
2007-01-05T13:43:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	if you're new to linux - it;s wiser not to install linux first if you want to install windows afterwards.
2007-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	Aggort	Lunar_Lamp	right. Alright, so I use Gparted to clear the ahrd drive then?
2007-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Aggort	yeah
