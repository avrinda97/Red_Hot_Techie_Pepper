2007-06-12T13:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		yeah tried that
2007-06-12T13:01:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		<bezak> this is what I get as a respose: Error "Invalid parameters" while copying "/home/adils... Linux.txt".
2007-06-12T13:02:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		what do you mean in the gui, I have copied the text file and tried to transfer it and what is cli?
2007-06-12T13:04:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		I have to unmount the USB to actually write?? the concept of that seems to be wrong but than ive just been using windows... so how do i do that
2007-06-12T13:06:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		<knifepoint> i can't copy that is what ive been trying to say the device is mounted I cna see all the files there but I can't copy this file through ubuntu
2007-06-12T13:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		<knifepoint> coul it be because the file system for the USB is FAT and not EXT but than it is a .txt file it wouldn't make a difference the OS would just convert it
2007-06-12T13:09:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		<knifepoint> nope will do so tell you soon what it is
2007-06-12T13:10:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		<knifepoint> nope no write permission here and I can't change it
2007-06-12T13:11:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		well im the admin if thats what you're asking and yeah I cna't write to USB im restricted to a lot in Ubuntu

2007-06-12T13:03:00.000Z	knifepoint	Pirate_Hunter	you have to unmount the USB drive to actually write the files to the drive
2007-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	knifepoint	Pirate_Hunter	Right click the USB drive on the desktop and press unmount
2007-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	knifepoint	Pirate_Hunter	After you have copyed the files to the device that is
2007-06-12T13:08:00.000Z	knifepoint	Pirate_Hunter	Nope FAT is supported have you checked the permissions of the USB drive
2007-06-12T13:09:00.000Z	knifepoint	Pirate_Hunter	Right click the drive properties>permissions and make sure you have write and delete permissions
2007-06-12T13:11:00.000Z	knifepoint	Pirate_Hunter	hmm well thats your problem how was the usb mounted, automatically?
