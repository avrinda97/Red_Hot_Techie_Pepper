2010-03-25T23:49:00.000Z	GUcko		guys how can I change the password for the power user?
2010-03-25T23:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	you don't
2010-03-25T23:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	change your own
2010-03-25T23:49:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	how to do that?
2010-03-25T23:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	there is no set password for the root, root account isn't used. First user gets sudo permissions which allows running applications as root
2010-03-25T23:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	several ways, either user management (System - admin - users and groups) or by commandline (passwd)
2010-03-25T23:50:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	I want to change the password of sudo! So how to do that?
2010-03-25T23:51:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	I tried them all, none changed the password!
2010-03-25T23:51:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	they gave me that the process was successful but it doesn't work after that!!
2010-03-25T23:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	you're not telling me anything that would help me to help you. What did you do, what happened then?
2010-03-25T23:53:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	System>Admins>Users and Groups>unlock>My username>Properties>Change password
2010-03-25T23:53:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	that what I did...it says it was successful, but when I try it to open Synatpic with the new password, it says it's wrong@
2010-03-25T23:54:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	have you had the permission to run synaptic before?
2010-03-25T23:55:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	do you mean cached password?
2010-03-25T23:55:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	no, I mean are you the first user of that machine and have you been able to run applications that require the usage of sudo before
2010-03-25T23:55:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	are there other users to that machine that have had accounts on it before you
2010-03-25T23:56:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	yeah sure! I'm travelling and I want to give the desktop to my sister, but the current password is for my email as well ;)
2010-03-25T23:56:00.000Z	GUcko	Myrtti	no only me
2010-03-25T23:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	GUcko	have you tried logging out and back in yet? what you could try as well is to try to change your password on the commandline with passwd
