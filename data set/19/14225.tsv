2004-10-14T15:00:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	does no one realize cd burning is broken with that kernel?
2004-10-14T15:00:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	yes :D
2004-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	Ubuntu is still pre-release
2004-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	there are some things still to be worked out before final
2004-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	will not be available till later this year
2004-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	ah, thanks
2004-10-14T15:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	just go ahead and install it what are you waiting for :)
2004-10-14T15:15:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	nah I got a nice debian unstable setup here
2004-10-14T15:15:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	I just want to try it out to see if I can recommend it to friends who want to switch to linux
2004-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	ahh
2004-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	it should be easier for them, but I can still help being familiar with the underlying system and all.  I am hesitant to tell people who ask me about linux to install debian
2004-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	Ubuntu uses debian installer from sarge
2004-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	ah, I've used the new installer, quite nice
2004-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	yes it is awesome, once a gui is written for it it will be easier for folks moving from Windows
2004-10-14T15:19:00.000Z	kaplanfx	LinuxJones	I think its better without a gui, people are just scared to realize its good
2004-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	kaplanfx	yes but people turn white if they have to go to a dos prompt in windows
