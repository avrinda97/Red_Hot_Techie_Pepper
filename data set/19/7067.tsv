2007-10-19T12:19:00.000Z	jotil		i am in the recovery mode and i don't have networking capabilities, which run level should i use? telinit 3 is taking me to gui and "sh /etc/init.d/networking start" is not bringing up my eth0
2007-10-19T12:19:00.000Z	volk	jotil	just setup network from the console using ifconfig
2007-10-19T12:29:00.000Z	jotil	volk	worked. thanks.
2007-10-19T12:34:00.000Z	jotil	volk	which run level does recovery mode run on?
2007-10-19T12:35:00.000Z	volk	jotil	not sure, i think its 3
2007-10-19T12:37:00.000Z	jotil	volk	not 3. telinit 3 brings x.org and gdm up.
2007-10-19T12:39:00.000Z	volk	jotil	runlevels are just fast way to stop a lot of services and start them again when you need them, you don't usually need to switch runlevels... sure switching is advertised in different tutorials where you for example install nvidia drivers, but I just use "killall gdm" and then restart it when im done..:D
2007-10-19T12:40:00.000Z	volk	jotil	what are you trying to do?
2007-10-19T12:44:00.000Z	jotil	volk	i am trying to install nVidia graphics driver. there seems to be an issue. xorg starting on recovery mode. so figuring that out. but i needed my eth0 to connect the internet. that's why i asked. i was thinking about adding networking capabilities to the recovery mode because i like being lazy. but no big deal. i can type two lines of commands.
2007-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	volk	jotil	well just go to one of the virtual consoles, do a killall gdm/killall X, then dhclient eth0 if you have dhcp, download the driver, run the bin file and start gdm :D
2007-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	volk	jotil	or if you are lazy you use envy to install the latest driver :D
2007-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	jotil	volk	yeah. done that right after. i am connected using ifconfig.
2007-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	volk	jotil	http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
2007-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	jotil	volk	i don't like envy :P thanks though
2007-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	volk	jotil	i dont like its feature that updates your x config, messing it up completely, but otherwise envy is great :)
2007-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	jotil	volk	you surely can use it to clean the restricted modules. the restricted modules are always causing trouble. everytime you upgrade distro, the nVidia binary breaks and then you have to go the same process over and over again.
2007-10-19T13:03:00.000Z	volk	jotil	you set up a wiki and write tutorials, that way after six months you can use your own tutorial to install something :D
2007-10-19T13:06:00.000Z	jotil	volk	see? i just did it and i simply forgot. my memory needs upgrade.
2007-10-19T13:07:00.000Z	volk	jotil	:P
