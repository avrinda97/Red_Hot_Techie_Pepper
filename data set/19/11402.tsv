2006-01-27T07:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	pastebin your sources.list
2006-01-27T07:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	It's also in the topic.
2006-01-27T07:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	Try kubuntu-desktop_0.63?
2006-01-27T07:44:00.000Z	asaee	tonyyarusso	what ?
2006-01-27T07:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	Try specifying a version with your command.  I'm just guessing from browsing your mirrors pool.  The other thing you can do is apt-cache search kubuntu, and tell us what comes up.
2006-01-27T07:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	apt-get update, then try again.
2006-01-27T07:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	Wait, never mind.
2006-01-27T07:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, then uncomment the line under ## Uncomment the following two lines to fetch updated software from the network
2006-01-27T07:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	Yes.
2006-01-27T07:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	And on the one with universe, add multiverse on the end.
2006-01-27T07:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	Yeah.  uni/multi are way fun on dialup.
2006-01-27T07:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	Correct.
2006-01-27T07:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	asaee	You too.  (btw, to start KDE, logout, and select it from the Sessions menu, and log back in)
