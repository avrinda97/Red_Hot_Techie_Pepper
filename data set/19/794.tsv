2011-10-06T00:07:00.000Z	antnash		Anyone know if it would be faster to boot from an SD card or a 5400RPM drive?
2011-10-06T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	the 5400RPM will be waaay faster
2011-10-06T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	class 6 is 6Mb/s    5400rpm drive is 3Gb/sec
2011-10-06T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	try it. I'd rather the 5400rpm drive

2011-10-06T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	compare booting SD card to live install environment compared to an installed OS
2011-10-09T19:28:00.000Z	antnash	ActionParsnip	it's not actually hanging at the DMI pool
2011-10-10T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	do you get prompted for username / password
2011-10-26T20:57:00.000Z	antnash	ActionParsnip	where would I find my xinitrc file?
2011-10-26T20:57:00.000Z	antnash	ActionParsnip	or, do you know how xubuntu starts an xfce session? exec xfce-session ?
2011-10-26T20:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	I believe the login manager will kick that off, not sure tbh
2011-10-26T21:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	you still get a logn screen though right?
2011-10-26T21:02:00.000Z	antnash	ActionParsnip	No, not with my vnc server. Just logs right in to my user with an xfce4 session. I wanted to get it loaded with the xubuntu defaults as it looks nicer.
2011-10-26T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	does it connect to the logged in session then?
2011-10-26T21:04:00.000Z	antnash	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I've set it so that it logs in to a session as my user automatically. I'm getting what I believe to be gksudo permission issues though. Standard sudo is fine, but any graphical interface like update manager or software center won't actually install anything
2011-10-26T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	not sure there dude. I don't use VNC. I think its vulgar
2011-11-16T05:16:00.000Z	antnash	ActionParsnip	how would I pass the results of   'dpkg --get-selections | grep firefox'  to   'apt-get purge' ?
2011-11-16T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	I believe its:   | apt-get purge -
2011-11-16T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	antnash	could ask in #bash
