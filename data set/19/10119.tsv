2009-05-04T08:08:00.000Z	Severian		sebastien, I think they are important.  Any are usable in a pinch.  It depends on what is important to you.  I usually use JFS or XFS.  I never use ext3 or ext4
2009-05-04T08:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	why JFS or  XFS?
2009-05-04T08:11:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	that last post was for you.  I did not put your name on it.
2009-05-04T08:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	it may be a silly reason to choose a file system really for a clean install, but  as I was testing  9.04,   Ext4 was the talk and all that.   so  now I want to get rid of this   install I was testing with, whic has some minor issues left from Alpha6, and  put 9.04 final on and  do Ext4
2009-05-04T08:15:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	I try out filesystems.  There is nothing silly about your trying ext4.  Put it on a system, and use it for a while.  But, don't trust it with anything you only have one copy of.  It is too easy to corrupt.
2009-05-04T08:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	why is it so easy to corrupt?
2009-05-04T08:18:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	google for that to find details.  There are multiple failure modes, which may get patched over time.  One has to do with writes that are cached at the time of a power failure.  The filesystem comes back up corrupt.  Loosing writes is one thing.  Corrupting the filesystem is much worse.
2009-05-04T08:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	well if it won't let me boot into it loads
2009-05-04T08:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	I can always get rid of Ext4 and do something else
2009-05-04T08:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	it's time for me to move on from Ext3
2009-05-04T08:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	Ext3 is slow  disk checking,  I heard Ext4 has much faster disk checking,  and  every now and again my Ext3 partitions have needed to be fixed
2009-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	the failure modes of ext4 are not common.  For testing, it is fine.  I would just be careful about keeping any data just there.  That's all.
2009-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	yeah I already knew there were possible dataloss issues, so  i'll just have stuff  somewhere else to
2009-05-04T08:26:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	I always recommend JFS as the default choice.
2009-05-04T08:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	why?
2009-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	I told you before that I studied the filesystems.  ext3 is basically a hack.  JFS and XFS are well thought out filesystems.
2009-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	and  Ext4 is just Ext3 with some changes?
2009-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Severian	ok well  another time  I guess I  try out  JFS and XFS,  or at least one of them.   if  I try  differnet file systemes in vm's would I get the advantages?
2009-05-04T08:32:00.000Z	Severian	sebsebseb	JFS is the safest to recommend.  XFS is a well tested system, but I believe there is an intermittent bug if you use it for the root filesystem and boot with GRUB.
