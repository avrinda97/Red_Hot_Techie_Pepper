2005-07-25T12:45:00.000Z	h08817		ok well i am installing ubntu with a server install
2005-07-25T12:45:00.000Z	h08817		and i am not sure after it is installed if it will have openoffice
2005-07-25T12:45:00.000Z	h08817		so i wanna know how to install openoffice
2005-07-25T12:45:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	sudo apt-get install openoffice.org
2005-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	it's already installed - or should be
2005-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	it's part of ubuntu-desktop.
2005-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	h08817	jasoncohen	i am installing server though
2005-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	sudo allows you to gain administrative access by entering your user password. it's an alternative to having a root account
2005-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	why do you want openoffice on a server?
2005-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	h08817	jasoncohen	no regular install i have limited disk space
2005-07-25T12:47:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	if you want openoffice then you'll need a window manager and X
2005-07-25T12:47:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	no, sudo apt-get install openoffice.org will do the install for you
2005-07-25T12:47:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	how big is your HD?
2005-07-25T12:48:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	have you tried the live cd?
2005-07-25T12:50:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	where do you live?
2005-07-25T12:50:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	look at the seagate drives on outpost. there are many great deals with $40 and $50 mail in rebates that'll allow you to get a 160 GB HD for $50 or a 200 GB for $70!
2005-07-25T12:51:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	lol- i would go with seagate. they have the highest rating for drive reliability that i've seen. maxtor has had some issues
2005-07-25T12:51:00.000Z	jasoncohen	h08817	but it's personal choice. WD caviar are good as well
