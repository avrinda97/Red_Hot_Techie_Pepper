2008-10-24T23:58:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		Hmm, can anyone tell me please how to set a higher dpi for desktop fonts in ubuntu?
2008-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		I figured out :)
2008-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		THank you very much mgolisch
2008-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		I just reached that page
2008-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		I never for one second thought about looking at fonts
2008-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		I was trying to find dpi, lol :)
2008-10-25T00:02:00.000Z	hypn0	blue_mushroom	it should be under screen resolution shouldn't it
2008-10-25T00:02:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	hypn0	that's where I looked first
2008-10-25T00:02:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		It appears it isn't there
2008-10-25T00:02:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		it's under Apearance/Fonts
2008-10-25T00:03:00.000Z	hypn0	blue_mushroom	I meant it shouldn't be under fonts :-)
2008-10-25T00:03:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		Yeah. it shouldn't
2008-10-25T00:03:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		That's where it's intuitive to be under display.
2008-10-25T00:04:00.000Z	blue_mushroom		Or if not a link in display that leads to the one in fonts
2008-10-25T00:04:00.000Z	hypn0	blue_mushroom	file a bug with gnome I think :-)
