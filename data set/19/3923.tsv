2009-08-17T11:22:00.000Z	mikeciance		ploooop: well i tried the Dell Mini 10v first, but i had keys getting stuck and coming off and all sorts of crap
2009-08-17T11:23:00.000Z	mikeciance		ploooop: it's actually a very nice piece of hardware, and the wifi is the only thing not currently working
2009-08-17T11:25:00.000Z	mikeciance		ploooop: yeah, i may give in and spend some more money.  just hurts after dishign out the money for the laptop
2009-08-17T11:27:00.000Z	mikeciance		ploooop: is this the kind of thing that is supposed to configure on install?
2009-08-17T11:28:00.000Z	mikeciance		ploooop: meaning, if i install again from my SD u think it might work?
2009-08-17T11:29:00.000Z	peedy	mikeciance	does your netbook have ethernet? try setting up NetBoot from another computer and install via ethernet. connecting a usb cd drive and booting the cd is another option.
2009-08-17T11:29:00.000Z	mikeciance	peedy	yeah, the usb cd drive is another thing i am being cheap on right now lol
2009-08-17T11:30:00.000Z	peedy	mikeciance	you can connect ur pc's drive using a IDE to USB cable
2009-08-17T11:33:00.000Z	mikeciance	peedy	well, i think my goal for tomorrow is to try the "backports" package thing
2009-08-17T11:33:00.000Z	mikeciance	peedy	i'll see where I go from there
2009-08-17T11:36:00.000Z	peedy	mikeciance	you might even try making the usb drive using UNetBootin. give unetbootin the iso image of ubuntu live cd, connect the flash drive and wait till it makes it bootable
2009-08-17T11:37:00.000Z	mikeciance	peedy	i had the image on the USB, it just wouldnt boot from it
2009-08-17T11:38:00.000Z	peedy	mikeciance	how did you get the image on usb?
2009-08-17T11:40:00.000Z	peedy	mikeciance	like what program did ya use?
