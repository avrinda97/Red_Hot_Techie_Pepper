2008-12-22T05:40:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun		Anyway when typing sudo it grants you the root powers for some time.
2008-12-22T05:40:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun		Thats pretty strange
2008-12-22T05:42:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun		Anyone who knows how to make some XP/Ubuntu dual boot ?
2008-12-22T05:42:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	install  ubuntu first, leave unpartitioned space at the start of the drive, install windows to there, then reinstall grub froma live cd
2008-12-22T05:45:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	you'll have to add windows to your grub list
2008-12-22T05:45:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	there's no way for it to automatically detect it
2008-12-22T05:46:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun	nagchampa	Everytime i installed Ubuntu it detected Windows automatically =)
2008-12-22T05:46:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	perhapss, but if you install ubuntu first, it's not there for it tto detect
2008-12-22T05:46:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	it's not grub detecting xp, it's the ubuntu installer
2008-12-22T05:47:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	if you listen to me i'm trying to explain it to you
2008-12-22T05:47:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun	nagchampa	No, because it detected it in the "import settings" thing
2008-12-22T05:47:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	yes, that's part of the ubuntu installer
2008-12-22T05:47:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun	nagchampa	It did with 8.04
2008-12-22T05:47:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	that wasn't grub doing it
2008-12-22T05:48:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun	nagchampa	ASULutzy : It is there
2008-12-22T05:48:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	ubuntu would have been detecting it atg some stage and automatically updating your menu.lst file
2008-12-22T05:50:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun	nagchampa	Thanks for the link, i'm trying that
2008-12-22T05:53:00.000Z	nagchampa	Tanuki-kun	windows uses two locations for different parts of its' bootloader
2008-12-22T05:55:00.000Z	Tanuki-kun	nagchampa	I'm reading the tutorial, im trying to fix it =D
