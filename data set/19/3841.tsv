2009-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	no, even though when I boot with Vista I am still not able to open them
2009-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	oh dear
2009-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	Oops, don't tell me
2009-05-17T09:21:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	The files are thre with thier original icons. I am not able to open them
2009-05-17T09:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	do  Windows first,  Ubuntu  second
2009-05-17T09:21:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	what do you mean?
2009-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	I mean  get your files open in Windows first,  then you can  open stuff up in Ubuntu to probably
2009-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	as long as Windows partitions are shut down properly, Ubuntu should be able to just use them
2009-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	the problem is that I am not able to open them in windows too
2009-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	,but maybe you got a currupted partitiion
2009-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	yes exactly, which means  you have problem all written over it
2009-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	if you can get them working in Windows,  then  they should just work in  Ubuntu as well, as long as that partition was shut down properly
2009-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	,but something has happended,  and it's a Windows partition and all that, so  makes sense to ask in ##windows
2009-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	I understand..
2009-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	Guest29625	sebsebseb	Ok.
2009-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest29625	if you can get it working in Windows properly,  what I said about Ubuntu
