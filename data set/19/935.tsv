2012-11-02T15:59:00.000Z	food1		Can i remove Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS \n \l from issue and issue net? I just want to hide all the banner for security reason
2012-11-02T16:00:00.000Z	food1		And add anything there Like "UnknowN LinX 00 \n \l"
2012-11-02T16:00:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	what?
2012-11-02T16:01:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	I mean deleting the text "12.04.1 LTS \n \l" from /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net ...
2012-11-02T16:03:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	and why would you want to do that???
2012-11-02T16:04:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	I don't want anyone see my System Information, version etc
2012-11-02T16:04:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	"anyone" as in... ?
2012-11-02T16:04:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	The Nasty Hacker?
2012-11-02T16:05:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	I guess if a hacker is able to access a file in you /etc dir, you have bigger problems then he knowing what you system version is :P
2012-11-02T16:06:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	When Someone connecting to my ssh or trying to logging locally i am not front of my pc. A hacker can go so far if the version he can know
2012-11-02T16:06:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	Is it safe to remove that line?
2012-11-02T16:07:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	that is absurd! First, to connect via ssh you must have ssh server enabled. Second, one needs a user and password there. Third, there are zillions of other ways to find out your OS version other than those files
2012-11-02T16:09:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	Well, Ubuntu boot in text mode then startx. So before logged in anyone can see the banner ... right ? Also I am trying to make it hardened
2012-11-02T16:10:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	no hacker would see your ubuntu booting before he can *connect* to your machine.
2012-11-02T16:11:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	And if he accessed to my computer room and tried turn on it?
2012-11-02T16:11:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	then /etc/issue is the least of your problems
2012-11-02T16:12:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	So i can remove that line ... Is it safe ? or Am i n00b?
2012-11-02T16:13:00.000Z	MestreLion	food1	IMHO you are completely uneducated about what "security" is
2012-11-02T16:13:00.000Z	food1	MestreLion	Right
