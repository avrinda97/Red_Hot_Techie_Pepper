2011-05-25T23:57:00.000Z	JoeR1		I ask again, Can anyone give me assistance with installing the 64-bit Flash Player Plugin?
2011-05-25T23:58:00.000Z	JoeR1		Really, not one person has an answer for me?
2011-05-25T23:59:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	Just keep posting if no one listens, I miss a lot of stuff that scrolls past
2011-05-25T23:59:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	- I have been, but I must admit it gets a bit frustrating
2011-05-26T00:00:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	I agree, no one has answered my question about my brightness flicker issue yet
2011-05-26T00:00:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	Try asking on /r/ubuntu
2011-05-26T00:00:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	- well I have had a lot of experience with video settings perhaps I can help maybe I can help you
2011-05-26T00:01:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	I have an Nvidia graphics card
2011-05-26T00:01:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	what is the screen refresh rate at? just out of curiosity
2011-05-26T00:02:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	are you using the nvidia driver or the experimental driver?
2011-05-26T00:02:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	It only happens when the screen is dimming to go to sleep, and I can't change the brightness, it's as if something is forcing it at 100%
2011-05-26T00:02:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	Proprietary drivers
2011-05-26T00:03:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	- so it doesn't actually dim to sleep it just flickers instead?
2011-05-26T00:03:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	As the screen fades to black it flickers back to 100% brightness while it's dimming, once it's fully black it's fine
2011-05-26T00:04:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	well that is a unique problem, there should be three drivers listed for your card perhaps you could try another one and see if the resolves the issue
2011-05-26T00:04:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	other than that I am not sure I can help, that is a pretty odd problem
2011-05-26T00:05:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	It's like something is forcing it to 100% brightness
2011-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	JoeR1	kwikshot	I know, it reminds me of a problem my roomy had with Zoom Player in windows but I doubt my knowledge base on that will be of any help
2011-05-26T00:06:00.000Z	kwikshot	JoeR1	Also I am using f.lux
