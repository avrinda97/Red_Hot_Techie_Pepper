2008-02-26T03:51:00.000Z	Cyntrox		When installing Ubuntu: How do I choose what partition to use for SWAP?
2008-02-26T03:53:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	the installer will give you a choice, if you choose manual/guided partitioning
2008-02-26T03:53:00.000Z	Cyntrox	mkquist_	I'm going manual, because I've had a lot of problems
2008-02-26T03:54:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	or you could just run partition editor from live cd and set it up there, just tell the install which to use as swap...
2008-02-26T03:54:00.000Z	Cyntrox	mkquist_	I'm using the alternative CD.
2008-02-26T03:55:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	dont think its much diff, if memory serves, just not that 'pretty'
2008-02-26T03:56:00.000Z	Cyntrox	mkquist_	My problem is that I don't know how to tell the install which one to use as swap >.>
2008-02-26T03:59:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	in the partitioner? edit and mount as swap?
2008-02-26T04:00:00.000Z	Cyntrox	mkquist_	Mount as swap... I see two relevant options: mount point and mount choice or something like that (using Norwegian installer)
2008-02-26T04:00:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	why are u using the alternate install cd?
2008-02-26T04:01:00.000Z	Cyntrox	mkquist_	Because the normal one gives me errors
2008-02-26T04:04:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	yes
2008-02-26T04:05:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	where are u in the install process
2008-02-26T04:05:00.000Z	Cyntrox	mkquist_	I'm in the part where I select partitions. Hold on, I'll take some pictures
2008-02-26T04:05:00.000Z	mkquist_	Cyntrox	k
