2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	regress		is there an irc channel to go to to get support for gnumeric?
2007-04-18T08:07:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	ask your question
2007-04-18T08:08:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	if its in ubuntu you can ask
2007-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	what are u trying to achieve
2007-04-18T08:10:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	so u have some rows in those columns that dont have text?
2007-04-18T08:13:00.000Z	regress	fiery_cleric	http://rafb.net/p/PfkLkM41.html
2007-04-18T08:15:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	so there are 2 columns .... so u want to sum the 2nd column?
2007-04-18T08:16:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	but they all contain strings ... u mean two words?
2007-04-18T08:16:00.000Z	regress	fiery_cleric	well, two strings that I choose
2007-04-18T08:17:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	ok so u  want to conditionally sum the column if the cell to the left contains certain strings?
2007-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	look at the sumif function
2007-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	regress	fiery_cleric	thanks!
2007-04-18T08:21:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	but yeah it would probably be easiest with a perl script
2007-04-18T08:22:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	the sumif might not work coz it looks a the cell themselves not the cell to the left
2007-04-18T08:25:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	yeah u cant use sumif... what u want to do is make a third column with an "if" function in it .... then sum the 3rd column... at this point i stop using an gnumeric thing a use a perl  script
2007-04-18T08:28:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	do cat file | grep "string1" |grep "string2" | ... then some how sum the last number
2007-04-18T08:28:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	have u got a file u can post?
2007-04-18T08:28:00.000Z	regress	fiery_cleric	haha, that's exactly the solution I'm doing right now
2007-04-18T08:29:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	regress	yeah
