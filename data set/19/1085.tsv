2011-05-14T13:33:00.000Z	_Anomaly		is there a way to tell Ubuntu that a certain IP is already taken and to choose another?
2011-05-14T13:34:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	static IPv4 addressing
2011-05-14T13:36:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	I tried static and got a connection but still couldn't ping google
2011-05-14T13:36:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	sounds like you forgot gateway/DNS info
2011-05-14T13:37:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	nope I know not to miss anything and I checked and rechecked all ip #'s
2011-05-14T13:38:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	I have had SuSE running on the same netwerk and other machines plugged into my system
2011-05-14T13:39:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	what exactly is the problem? DHCP is giving you an address that is in use? Theres only 3 things that could cause that, Duplicate MAC addresses, DHCP Leases being too short and Someone assigning a Static IP that is in the DHCP lease range
2011-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	good list of questions.... I can't figure it out either and I am a netwerk speciallist with WinBlows
2011-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	I will eventually finger this out..... I was just seeing if it was a simple mistake that I was making
2011-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	a static address should work, if its not working then theres something more than a duplicate IP involved
2011-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	ok thank you.  I can't finger this out atm but I will
2011-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	and at that, a dup IP will work intermittently
2011-05-14T13:45:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	very true
2011-05-14T13:49:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	Thank you for your help
2011-05-14T13:49:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	good luck
2011-05-14T13:58:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	think I should also install wicd?
2011-05-14T13:58:00.000Z	pfifo	_Anomaly	no in your case i would uninstall both and configure by hand
2011-05-14T13:59:00.000Z	_Anomaly	pfifo	I configured by hand earlier today..... lol she was really cute too
