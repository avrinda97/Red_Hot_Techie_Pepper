2006-10-17T15:41:00.000Z	morla		hi alltogether. I'm desperate :)  I need a certain application for school that simply will not compile, I believe it could be because missing dev files, but how do I find out which ones I need??
2006-10-17T15:41:00.000Z	LjL	morla	you could use apt-file for that
2006-10-17T15:41:00.000Z	LjL	morla	anyway, what application is that?
2006-10-17T15:42:00.000Z	morla	LjL	ocs/opal
2006-10-17T15:42:00.000Z	morla	LjL	it's not in the repositories. will apt-file still work?
2006-10-17T15:43:00.000Z	LjL	morla	yes, apt-file is intended to tell you which package contains a file. so, if you don't know which -dev package you need to compile, apt-file might help.
2006-10-17T15:43:00.000Z	LjL	morla	if you're really desperate, there's also auto-apt
2006-10-17T15:44:00.000Z	morla	LjL	aha I see. I tell apt-file a .so and it tells me the package?
2006-10-17T15:44:00.000Z	LjL	morla	yes. or a .h, more likely
2006-10-17T15:44:00.000Z	LjL	morla	of course the basic requirement is that you *know* what the file you need is... hopefully configure, or make, are telling you that
2006-10-17T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	morla	if they aren't, you might go for auto-apt, but be careful, because it'll try to install packages that you don't really need
2006-10-17T15:45:00.000Z	morla	LjL	unfortunately not.. it complaines about missing files in /tmp
2006-10-17T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	morla	that sounds more like a broken configure than anything else...   but, can you paste the error on the pastebin?
2006-10-17T15:46:00.000Z	morla	LjL	I'll google a bit for auto-apt
2006-10-17T15:46:00.000Z	morla	LjL	ok. one moment
2006-10-17T15:54:00.000Z	morla	LjL	the console output: http://www.ubuntuusers.de/paste/4390/  and the make install output: http://www.ubuntuusers.de/paste/4388/  and the configure.log: http://www.ubuntuusers.de/paste/4389/
2006-10-17T15:56:00.000Z	LjL	morla	looks horrible, wouldn't know where to start troubleshooting
2006-10-17T15:58:00.000Z	morla	LjL	it's messy isn'T it :)  I know that it will compile on dapper though..
2006-10-18T16:07:00.000Z	morla	LjL	thanks for the help, I give up for today :)
