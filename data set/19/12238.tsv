2005-10-01T09:43:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX		again
2005-10-01T09:44:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX		Is there a manual/bible/guide to using the terminal?
2005-10-01T09:44:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX		I have an rpm file that I am unable to install, and I how do I run executables?
2005-10-01T09:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/ perhaps?
2005-10-01T09:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 ubuntu is .deb-based, not .rpm-based, try finding a .deb instead (man alien) ... running can be ./foo
2005-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 no idea what it is ... ./filenamehere as an example
2005-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX	eyequeue	it says permission denied, and I ran it as root and the account it belongs too
2005-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 did you chmod +x filename, first?
2005-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	try that
2005-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	i sure hope this thing is safe to run, no guarantees if it's not, heh
2005-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX	eyequeue	it is
2005-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 first, are you sure it's a bash script?
2005-10-01T10:17:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX	eyequeue	 yes
2005-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 head -1 foo.sh
2005-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 k.  chmod +x foo.sh ; ./foo.sh
2005-10-01T10:21:00.000Z	IceDrag0nLX	eyequeue	every time I chmod it says file cannot be located
2005-10-01T10:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 is it in your current directory?  home directory?
2005-10-01T10:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	IceDrag0nLX	 okay
