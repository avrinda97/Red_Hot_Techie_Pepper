2008-02-27T15:19:00.000Z	Arelis		Can somebody help me get Compiz Fusion to work on Ubuntu with an ATI Radeon 9600 video card and the propietary ATI drivers, the version which is in the Ubuntu repositories?
2008-02-27T15:20:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	: use the latest the work much better. I'll grab a link to a great guide for getting the drivers working.
2008-02-27T15:20:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	alright :)
2008-02-27T15:21:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_Guide
2008-02-27T15:22:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	what about this one?: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI#head-99489608eb537a1a0346cdd3ad34209d7887714a
2008-02-27T15:25:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	what about this guide?: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI#head-99489608eb537a1a0346cdd3ad34209d7887714a
2008-02-27T15:26:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	that guide should be fine
2008-02-27T15:29:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	must I first uninstall the old one?
2008-02-27T15:30:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	use this guide because I know it can go over the old one. http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_Guide
2008-02-27T15:30:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	uses the same mechanics.
2008-02-27T15:31:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	Then either shoud be fine.
2008-02-27T15:42:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	it worked! now i can game and have compiz, and it's not even slow (compiz isn't slow. nexuiz is..) thanks! :)
2008-02-27T15:42:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	compiz will run on most things fairly well. :)
2008-02-27T15:44:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	why were people complaining that this was slow?
2008-02-27T15:44:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	it's faster than 'radeon'
2008-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	what? but i need to watch video's
2008-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	you can temporarily stop compiz to watch them or watch them fullscreen instead.
2008-02-27T15:47:00.000Z	Arelis	menisk	mplayer -vo sdl path/to/movie.avi does the trick :)
2008-02-27T15:48:00.000Z	menisk	Arelis	I remeber finding a way to make mplayer work with compiz but it screwed the aspect ration and made people look skinny. I don't watch videos under linux much.
