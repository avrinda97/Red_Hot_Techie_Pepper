2010-09-25T23:53:00.000Z	Clemens		Does anyone know where I can change settings so that I can hear sounds using headphones ?
2010-09-25T23:53:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	Do you mean the speaker icon in the bottom right?
2010-09-25T23:54:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	I don't have a speaker butten on the bottom.
2010-09-25T23:54:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	Or top, where ever your system tray is.
2010-09-25T23:55:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	yes, but I can't find where I can change (or whatever I have to do) the device to use for sounds
2010-09-25T23:55:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	Or headphones are not in the list
2010-09-25T23:55:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	Are you talking about system souhnds or general sounds?
2010-09-25T23:55:00.000Z	Ryen		*sounds
2010-09-25T23:56:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	General sounds. I looked at "Sound preferences"
2010-09-25T23:56:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	It works when I not use the headphones
2010-09-25T23:56:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	Just click on the speaker icon, and drag it down, that should lower the sound.
2010-09-25T23:57:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	I don't want to lower the sound, I want to hear something. I don't hear anything
2010-09-25T23:57:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	Are you sure that your 3.5mm jack is not messed up?
2010-09-25T23:58:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	No, I'm not sure. What is that ?
2010-09-25T23:58:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	I tried two different headphones
2010-09-25T23:59:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	The port you are plugging your earphones in. What you can also try is go under output, and see if pushing that slider to the right even more does anything.
2010-09-26T00:00:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	Doesn't help.
2010-09-26T00:00:00.000Z	Clemens	Ryen	Thanks anyway
2010-09-26T00:00:00.000Z	Ryen	Clemens	No problem, I'm sorry I coulf not figure it out.
