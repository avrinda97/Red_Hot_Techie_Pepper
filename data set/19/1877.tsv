2010-09-14T20:26:00.000Z	KAL		hello guys, tell me how can i listen on single port and read all crap which came through it?
2010-09-14T20:26:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	netcat
2010-09-14T20:27:00.000Z	KAL	undecim	ok I'll try
2010-09-14T20:27:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	for example, listen to port 1234: "nc -lp 1234"
2010-09-14T20:27:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	You can record it, too: "nc -lp 1234 | tee port.1234.log"
2010-09-14T20:34:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	Ah, you don't want to listen on a port, you want to sniff packets. You will need tcpdump or wireshark for that.
2010-09-14T20:35:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	Though with SSH, everything is encrypted, so it will just look like random data
2010-09-14T20:35:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	If you have the private keys of the both the server and the person connecting to SSH, you can decrypt it with some work
2010-09-14T20:35:00.000Z	KAL	undecim	it doesn't matter, what I want to get is that knowlege that there is any movement on that port
2010-09-14T20:36:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	Well, there should be and sshd log
2010-09-14T20:36:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	like if you want to see if there are any failed login attempts
2010-09-14T20:36:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	You can also run "w" to see if anyone is logged int and from where
2010-09-14T20:41:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	Try connecting to it using your internet IP. (get from http://wimi.com)
2010-09-14T20:42:00.000Z	KAL	undecim	how can i connect to this port?
2010-09-14T20:43:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	For example, if you have SSH listening on port 2345 (you should never have it listening on the default port if its connect to the internet) you could try "ssh -p 2345 6.7.8.9" where 6.7.8.9 is the IP address reported by wimi.com
2010-09-14T20:44:00.000Z	KAL	undecim	i have ssh on 22 port and nothing on that port which i want to check
2010-09-14T20:45:00.000Z	KAL	undecim	but i figured out that thing: I have my app which is client of a simple game, so i put there my internet IP and this port and tried to connect, and i opened tcpdump -nnv... on server and nothing appered. is that mean that there is no port open there or what?
2010-09-14T20:46:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	The client would have complained about not being able to connect. If you don't get anything from tcpdump, then that means the port is either closed or just not mapped to your server
2010-09-14T20:48:00.000Z	undecim	KAL	If you are just trying to test a service like SSH, just use the SSH command. If you are checking a port you plan to use later, use nc to start listening on the port and then use another nc to connect to it and see if you can transfer text between the two nc's
