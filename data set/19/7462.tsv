2007-08-27T11:45:00.000Z	NMajik		Why would I be prevented from using chown while root?
2007-08-27T11:45:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	it's not root's file to chown?
2007-08-27T11:46:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	The folder permissions look like it is
2007-08-27T11:47:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	so root has write permissions?
2007-08-27T11:47:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	I believe so. I can read and write to the folder as root.
2007-08-27T11:48:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	care to pastebin the output of ls -l and chmod whateveryouwantedtodo ?
2007-08-27T11:49:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	Just let me figure out how to use pastebin...

2007-08-27T11:51:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	Specifically Shared
2007-08-27T11:52:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	I take it you're trying to chmod 'disk' ?
2007-08-27T11:52:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	Shared
2007-08-27T11:52:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	so what does chmod give you, and what command are you running?
2007-08-27T11:53:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	I was using chown. The errors run off the screen because I used the -R switch
2007-08-27T11:53:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	Should I use chmod instead?
2007-08-27T11:53:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	well then paste some of it
2007-08-27T11:56:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35280/
2007-08-27T11:57:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	clearly, there are some other files that root does not own
2007-08-27T11:59:00.000Z	Adlai	NMajik	you'd be better off rethinking whether you really need to chown -R that, and I'd be better off in the shower, so good luck
2007-08-27T11:59:00.000Z	NMajik	Adlai	OK thanks
