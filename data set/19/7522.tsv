2008-05-29T17:28:00.000Z	ompaul	KOJV	that is not what you want as far as I can see - it is build for a previous generation I have tried looking up fans on google what kind of hardware have you got?
2008-05-29T18:17:00.000Z	KOJV	ompaul	I've got a Dell Inspiron 8200 with new, 2-wire fans (no yellow wire connected) and I need a software to make them run upon boot.
