2007-12-03T21:33:00.000Z	onats		hi, is ubuntu x64 and ubuntu i386 considered as different distributions?
2007-12-03T21:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	not really.
2007-12-03T21:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	if you want to be pedantic, they should be, but they're almost the same in practice.
2007-12-03T21:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	x64 uses packages compiled for x64, and i386 uses packages compiled for i386.
2007-12-03T21:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	some packages are i386 -only though, so there's some disparity.
2009-03-11T04:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	how much memory do you have?
2009-03-11T04:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	... uh, right?
2009-03-11T04:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	you have 8 Gb of memory and you want to save it?
2009-03-11T04:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	what.
2009-03-11T04:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	and why does that matter?
2009-03-11T04:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	are you running out of memory?
2009-03-11T04:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	you know, firefox uses memory when it's available so it's FASTER.
2009-03-11T04:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	unless it's using something completely ridiculous (like 700 MB right after launch) or exhibiting otherwise weird behaviour, stop worrying :)
2009-03-11T04:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	well that might be a problem.
2009-03-11T04:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	unlikely :P
2009-03-11T04:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	unless firefox is going haywire
2009-03-11T04:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	which would be a bug in firefox.
2009-03-11T04:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	but go ahead and try other browsers if you want
2009-03-11T04:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	onats	epiphany is fine
