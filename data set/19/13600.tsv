2005-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	mono
2005-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	search for mono in name and description? ;P
2005-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	 I found it .. Marked it for updating and applied it. It did the download and update.. BUT i don't know where it is??
2005-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	me either; i don't know what it installs.
2005-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	use dpkg -c <name of mono package> to see what it installs.
2005-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	: : Where do I use this
2005-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	in a terminal
2005-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	well, if the package is installed, you should be good to go if you can figure out which files it installs.
2005-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	h/o a sec...
2005-02-24T13:47:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	in synaptic, right-click on the package, go to properties and go to "installed files"
2005-02-24T13:48:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	look for anything in /usr/bin in particular...
2005-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	Then what?
2005-02-24T13:55:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	run anything in /usr/bin... i don't really know, but you could probably ask on #mono
2005-02-24T13:56:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	is there #mono???
2005-02-24T13:56:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	yup.
