2007-03-11T10:03:00.000Z	depesz		hi. i've got a problem. just installed kubuntu on a laptop, and it does something strange with wireless - brings eth1 up, but without ip nor anything. i have to manually: sudo ifdown eth1; sudo ifup eth1 and then it works
2007-03-11T10:03:00.000Z	depesz		do you have any ideas on what could i screw to make it that way?
2007-03-11T10:03:00.000Z	depesz		all config is in /etc/network/interfaces as usual.
2007-03-11T10:03:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	Please pastebin the contents of your /etc/network/interfaces
2007-03-11T10:04:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	pasting.
2007-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	any ideas?
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	Hmm, that seems like it ought to work.  (Then again, my wireless fails to configure on boot, too.)
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	any idea on what to do to make it working automatically?
2007-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	it works "by hand"
2007-03-11T10:08:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	I have the same problem, my friend.  I wish I knew what the deal was.
2007-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	Try looking through /var/log/syslog, /var/log/daemon.log and dmesg for output from dhclient during boot.  It may give you some hints.
2007-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	do you start it by hand yourself?
2007-03-11T10:10:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	I do.
2007-03-11T10:10:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	Well, I "sort of" do it by hand.  I wrote a script that runs when I login.
2007-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	:( thanks anyway
2007-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	I can help you get it to automatically configure your wireless when you *log in*, but not when you boot up
2007-03-11T10:14:00.000Z	depesz	Tonren	i can write a small script myself. this is not a problem.
2007-03-11T10:14:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	Ahh.  Ok.  Yeah, it sucks.  I can't figure out how to get it to configure on bootup.
2007-03-11T10:14:00.000Z	Tonren	depesz	It used to work for me, but not anymore.  It's an awful hassle.
