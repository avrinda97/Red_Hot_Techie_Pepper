2012-01-28T12:50:00.000Z	zarbula		ubuntu, looking for a good easy guide to setting up my own name servers.. my Bind server isn't working and the default ubuntu guide isn't really helping
2012-01-28T12:51:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	is bind installed?
2012-01-28T12:51:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	yes
2012-01-28T12:52:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	is it answering queries from the localhost?
2012-01-28T12:52:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	Also will this be an authoritative only name server or Recursive?
2012-01-28T12:52:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	I thought I set the master zone correctly, with a record for ns1.example.com, and ns2.example.com (not the true domain of course)
2012-01-28T12:53:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	authritative, the goal is to host a few domains
2012-01-28T12:53:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	try dig @localhost example.com ns
2012-01-28T12:54:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL,
2012-01-28T12:55:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	try this one: dig . ns @localhost
2012-01-28T12:56:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	could you pastebin your named.conf
2012-01-28T12:56:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	will do
2012-01-28T12:57:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	http://pastebin.com/qAnKx7kn
2012-01-28T13:00:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	mine looks like: http://pastebin.ca/2106984
2012-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	Do you have additional sections in there?
2012-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	Its not from an ubuntu system, so the paths might be different
2012-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	I used the ubuntu guide to get to where I am now.
2012-01-28T13:03:00.000Z	treshoem	zarbula	Do you have named.conf.options and named.conf.local as well?
2012-01-28T13:03:00.000Z	zarbula	treshoem	I might not, I'm not sure.
