2008-07-08T19:21:00.000Z	Tita1		Well, my main question, is after you get a tar.gz file how do you run it? I know you have to extract it, but then what? I try runnung the makefile and nothing happens

2008-07-08T19:25:00.000Z	Wolphie	Tita1	have you checked the restricted drivers?
2008-07-08T19:25:00.000Z	Wolphie	Tita1	System > Administration > Restricted Drivers
2008-07-08T19:25:00.000Z	Wolphie	Tita1	Usually nVidia drivers appear they by default if your card is detected
2008-07-08T19:29:00.000Z	Wolphie	Tita1	Welcome
2008-07-08T19:30:00.000Z	Wolphie	Tita1	If you want additional settings for your card, sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
2008-07-08T19:30:00.000Z	Wolphie	Tita1	Although your card may not support it
