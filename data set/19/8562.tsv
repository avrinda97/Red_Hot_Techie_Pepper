2008-02-14T03:38:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	have you been reading what I said? It won't work, regardless.
2008-02-14T03:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	No, I was looking at my notes on how i GOT MY SOUND WORKING THIS AM
2008-02-14T03:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	It taht a bug just for the nvidia sound chips?
2008-02-14T03:40:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	yes.
2008-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	well, errr, this specific soundcard yeah.
2008-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	Do you have a link handy
2008-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	not all will fail, only some, as said previously.
2008-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	not atm.
2008-02-14T03:42:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	and i've pretty much come to this conclusion myself ;)
2008-02-14T03:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	What all did you try so far? alsa-driver-1.0.15rc3.tar.bz2    is what I used from the alsa project this am to get mine going
2008-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	you don't have the same soundcard as this guy.
2008-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	Understood, but did you try the newest alsa driver
2008-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	of course.
2008-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	Not obvious from here. :)
2008-02-14T03:45:00.000Z	eth01	Jack_Sparrow	no, it failed.
2008-02-14T04:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eth01	Is your nvidia an HD sound card?
