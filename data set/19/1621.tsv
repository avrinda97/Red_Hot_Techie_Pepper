2011-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	jon_athon		I can save .doc files in openoffice.org, but I can't open them. I just uninstalled and re-installed oo.org writer
2011-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	jon_athon		still no love
2011-01-31T22:42:00.000Z	jon_athon		This is my homework I'm doing, too...so i need a fix, or at least a bandaid
2011-01-31T22:43:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	id work on it in .odt format in the meantime then just swap it to .doc to send to your teacher, in that case
2011-01-31T22:43:00.000Z	jon_athon	maco	I already saved it to .doc and closed it
2011-01-31T22:47:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	google docs?
2011-01-31T22:47:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	personal package archive
2011-01-31T22:48:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	one of the ubuntu devs have a repository for libreoffice which is a new fork of openofice
2011-01-31T22:48:00.000Z	jon_athon	maco	gpc, libre... sounds spanish?
2011-02-21T11:37:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	if you raise the niceness, it becomes nicer about yielding resources. so thatd be like "nice 10 <pid>"
2011-02-21T11:37:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	if you lower it (this requires root) it becomes meaner / refuses to give up resources. that's "sudo nice -5 <pid>"
2011-02-21T11:37:00.000Z	jon_athon	maco	yielding system resources = more run time?
2011-02-21T11:37:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	yielding = giving up
2011-02-21T11:38:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	nicenss ranges from -20 to 19, iirc. DO NOT make something lower than like -15 or important system things will stop working
2011-02-21T11:39:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	ah sorry, i shouldve said renice for the command
2011-02-21T11:39:00.000Z	maco	jon_athon	"nice" is for use when starting a /new/ process
2011-02-21T11:39:00.000Z	jon_athon	maco	gotcha, thanks
