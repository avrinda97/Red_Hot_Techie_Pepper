2012-02-14T02:35:00.000Z	Innxis		Any tips on how to do that?
2012-02-14T02:36:00.000Z	Innxis		I'm not trying to install according to a tutorial, I'm a freelancer.
2012-02-14T02:37:00.000Z	Innxis		Look, I'm just trying to get GRUB configured to boot my from my partition (hda0,3) without installing it in the MBR

2012-02-14T02:40:00.000Z	Innxis		I only ask for an expiation on how to configure GRUB form a Live CD or from the GRUB Command Line.
2012-02-14T02:41:00.000Z	Innxis		I did, doesn't work.
2012-02-14T02:42:00.000Z	zykotic10	Innxis	don't edit menu.lst - it's not how grub2 works.
2012-02-14T02:42:00.000Z	Innxis		Actually, I used update-grub from the live CD and copied the menu.lst to the grub on the disk.
2012-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	Innxis		No results.
2012-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	zykotic10	Innxis	did you chroot before running update-grub?  see "/msg ubottu grub2" for assistance.
2012-02-14T02:44:00.000Z	Innxis	Zillow	-r = recursive, -f = force
2012-02-14T02:45:00.000Z	Innxis	Zillow	you can stack them by: cp -rf
2012-02-14T02:46:00.000Z	Innxis		I have grub 1.9 downloaded from the repositories using apt-get
2012-02-14T02:46:00.000Z	Innxis		installed using install-grub
2012-02-14T02:47:00.000Z	zykotic10	Innxis	grub 1.9 = grub2 (strange i know)
