2010-06-05T13:20:00.000Z	C-Otto		hi there
2010-06-05T13:20:00.000Z	C-Otto		oh, this is a large channel
2010-06-05T13:21:00.000Z	C-Otto		I'm administrating one of the mirrors for ubuntu and wonder about the traffic. Is it correct that users first need to update their sources.list manually or download a new release where our mirror is selectable in the installer?
2010-06-05T13:22:00.000Z	C-Otto		stated differently: what do you as an ubuntu user need to do to use a new mirror?
2010-06-05T13:23:00.000Z	C-Otto		with opensuse, mozilla, vlc, eclipse the answer is: nothing :)
2010-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	Edit sources.list, or if you are an official mirror go to souftware sources and choose the mirror from the extended list there..
2010-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	okay, thanks - I guess there's not much need to do these steps as long as everything works
2010-06-05T13:40:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	It does not in Lucid.
2010-06-05T13:40:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	hm, thanks
2010-06-05T13:41:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	the name is "RWTH Aachen University", maybe hidden in that?
2010-06-05T13:42:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	There is vest.informatik.rwth-aachen.de, but not the one you specified.
2010-06-05T13:42:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	k, thanks. do you know if that list is updated automatically?
2010-06-05T13:44:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	I would guess that it may be defined by a package, by which case it is likely froozen as of the release of an ubuntu version (possibly updated later on if need be, but far from automatically... my guess)
2010-06-05T13:44:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	okay, so we need to wait for N* N*...
2010-06-05T13:45:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	Why not Maverick?
2010-06-05T13:45:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	i think we got official (again) after the release of maverick
2010-06-05T13:46:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	Maverick is not released yet and is still undergoing heavy changes, so I would assume if you are official it is highly likely that you might get in there
2010-06-05T13:47:00.000Z	C-Otto	arand	oh, i see. like squeeze? :)
2010-06-05T13:48:00.000Z	arand	C-Otto	Kind-of, Maverick is somewhat of a rolling release at the moment, but in time for 2010-10 it will get "frozen" and released.
