2009-02-27T18:08:00.000Z	jesus_		how does on deactivate the 'smart' (stupid) bash completion? That is, the one that must look at file endings.
2009-02-27T18:09:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	Are you talking about tab-completion?
2009-02-27T18:10:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	yeah.
2009-02-27T18:12:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	bu tnot the usual one, which gentoo and other systems usually use. But the "smart" (or what I would call stupid) that ubuntu uses.
2009-02-27T18:12:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	I have no idea what Ubuntu does differently with bash than any other distro.  (It certainly doesn't have anything to do with file extensions...)
2009-02-27T18:12:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	Can you tell me what the behavior is that you're seeing that is bothering you and how it's different?
2009-02-27T18:14:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	yes it does. When I write "$ evince " press tab I do not get any completion options unless there is a file named .pdf or .dvi or any other filename that it recognize. But I use arxiv,org in my work and their naming of pdfs are not .pdf but just YYMM.XXXX and I cant tabcomplete them!
2009-02-27T18:15:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	Huh, you're right. :/  I stand corrected.
2009-02-27T18:15:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	and you dont know how to fix this windows-like feature? (win-like as in, it is a bad feature)
2009-02-27T18:16:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	Calm down, it takes me a few minutes to google things just like anyone else
2009-02-27T18:16:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	You can fine-tune it in /etc/bash_completion
2009-02-27T18:17:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	oh, I thought you just knew. Most people on IRC either knows or says "you google it". I'll take a look at that file. thnx.
2009-02-27T18:17:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	or turn it off entirely by commenting out the lines with "bash_completion" in /etc/bash.bashrc
2009-02-27T18:17:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	but doen't that disable bash_completion entirely?
2009-02-27T18:18:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	I still want the usual completion, just not the ubuntu-one.
2009-02-27T18:18:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	If you disable the bash_completion stuff entirely, it should still tab-complete, but based only on what you've started typing.  e.g. "cd D[tab]" should complete anything that starts with "D" whether it's a directory or not
2009-02-27T18:19:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	so my leaning would be to edit /etc/bash_completion to get rid of the PDF settings rather than turning it off entirely, but it's obviously up to you
2009-02-27T18:20:00.000Z	jesus_	fader	ok. thanks for clearing things up for me.
2009-02-27T18:20:00.000Z	fader	jesus_	no problem :)
