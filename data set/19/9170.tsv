2007-02-14T17:22:00.000Z	nevron		how can i get a channel list?
2007-02-14T17:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	With the amount of channels, it'd likely flood you off the network.
2007-02-14T17:23:00.000Z	nevron	ardchoille	do you know of a channel about soundcards
2007-02-14T17:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	No, sorry
2007-02-16T15:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	Which type of theme are you trying to use?
2007-02-16T15:44:00.000Z	nevron	ardchoille	what do you mean by that this error message appears on any theme i use since the installation
2007-02-16T15:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	That kind of error message usually means you don't have the engine that the theme needs to use.
2007-02-16T15:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	Have yo been deleting files with sudo lately?
2007-02-16T15:45:00.000Z	nevron	ardchoille	:) no
2007-02-16T15:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	Is there anything in /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/engines ?
2007-02-16T15:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	You're on Edgy?
2007-02-16T15:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	You should have some libpixmap.* files in there
2007-02-16T15:49:00.000Z	nevron	ardchoille	under /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines$ i do not have a libpixmap enigne
2007-02-16T15:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	Ok, sounds like a theme is trying to use the libpixmap engine but you don't have it.
2007-02-16T15:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	apt-cache policy gtk2-engines-pixbuf   and see if that is installed or not
2007-02-16T15:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	gtk2-engines-pixbuf provides the libpixmap engines
2007-02-16T15:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	Pastebin the error?
2007-02-16T16:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	nevron	Sorry can't help with sound.. I don't use sound.
2007-02-16T16:01:00.000Z	nevron	ardchoille	:) thanks anyways
