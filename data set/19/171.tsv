2012-07-20T05:02:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	did you activate an additional driver for the vid card?
2012-07-20T05:02:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	yes
2012-07-20T05:02:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	twas a nvidia driver
2012-07-20T05:03:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	sounds like the driver is having issues
2012-07-20T05:03:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	In the Additional Drivers section I've tried using both of the 2 Nvidia drivers available.  They both do the same thing.
2012-07-20T05:04:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	try going back to the original driver that Ubuntu used when you installed
2012-07-20T05:04:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	It still happens with that
2012-07-20T05:05:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	which video card is it?
2012-07-20T05:05:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	In Gnome the text artifacts actually scroll up and down.  In Unity the text artifacts are refreshed/cleared when the page is scrolled. Go figure
2012-07-20T05:06:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	sounds like youve made a lot of modifications
2012-07-20T05:07:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	No I've made none, except install the latest Gnome 3, but the glitches happened before that
2012-07-20T05:08:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	do you use nomodeset in grub?
2012-07-20T05:08:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	I don't know, whatever the default is.   Should I?
2012-07-20T05:09:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	the glitch doesn't always happen, only about once or twice an hour while editing in vim.
2012-07-20T05:09:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	no, if you didnt add it to grub, I dont think it will fix this
2012-07-20T05:10:00.000Z	compdoc	mrich_	vim is vi?
2012-07-20T05:10:00.000Z	compdoc		why do you use that?
2012-07-20T05:10:00.000Z	compdoc		ever try nano?
2012-07-20T05:11:00.000Z	mrich_	compdoc	vim is an iMproved vi
