2009-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	anahata		my local lug doesn't meet anymore, according to their site
2009-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	anahata		at least i have this
2009-03-06T10:48:00.000Z	anahata		my one acquaintance online tried to talk me into bsd instead of ubuntu
2009-03-06T10:49:00.000Z	anahata		are you all really happier on linux than on windows?
2009-03-06T10:50:00.000Z	anahata		is it really better or am i having grass-is-greener syndrome?
2009-03-06T10:50:00.000Z	constantine_	anahata	it is better
2009-03-06T10:50:00.000Z	constantine_	anahata	there's a learning curve but most don't remember that they had one with windows too
2009-03-06T10:51:00.000Z	anahata	bazhang	ok... i was starting to ramble
2009-03-06T10:51:00.000Z	constantine_		and the support is waaaay better...look around
2009-03-06T10:51:00.000Z	constantine_		for free
2009-03-06T10:52:00.000Z	anahata		(yes, but the local linux geeks don't seem as nice, honestly, for me)
2009-03-06T10:52:00.000Z	anahata		these ubuntu rooms seem unbelievably helpful though
2009-03-06T10:52:00.000Z	anahata		i'll take this to the offtopic room now
2009-03-06T10:52:00.000Z	constantine_		I am a bit concerned with how often these new versions come out though, and whether I'll have to continually reinstall them
2009-03-06T10:53:00.000Z	constantine_	anahata	if you get a book and start with the basics, it will make it easier for them to answer you
2009-03-06T10:53:00.000Z	anahata		a linux book or an ubuntu book?
2009-03-06T10:53:00.000Z	anahata		constantine: i have 3 linux books
2009-03-06T10:53:00.000Z	constantine_	anahata	many are into linux and programming and think logically so they expect you to have googled or tried to look
2009-03-06T10:54:00.000Z	constantine_	anahata	get the ubuntu pocket guide which is free or paperback or get ubuntu kung fu
