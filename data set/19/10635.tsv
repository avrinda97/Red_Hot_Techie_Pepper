2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		i just bought a new AMD64 machine and i've got problems installing linux (amd64 bits versions of course)
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 4 Bank 4: b200000000070f0f
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		TSC 3eb4f7a737
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		Kernel Panic - not syncing: Machine check
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		_
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		that's it
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		given a certain pint, it hangs up with that
2006-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		i think i have to disable the 'mce'
2006-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		 i think i have to disable the 'mce' at the booting process of the installation, but i write 'linux nomce' and it keeps happening
2006-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		plz i need help :p
2006-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	MachineCheckExce	I'm not sure you can turn off MCE like that, and generally it indicates a fault with the system
2006-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	MachineCheckExce	does your machine run a 'memtest' okay? (and does the 386 linux have a problem booting)
2006-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce	RandolphCarter	the memtest didn't find any error
2006-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	MachineCheckExce	hmm, which amd64 cpu is it?
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		and, i've been unable to boot a 386 kernel. I'm new to 64 bits, is that even possible?
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce		uhm one sec
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	MachineCheckExce	yeah, I'm using a 32-bit linux with a K7 kernel here atm, it saves hassle with things like flash and w32codecs
2006-05-30T08:02:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce	RandolphCarter	CPU AMD SEMPRON 3100+ SK754
2006-05-30T08:03:00.000Z	MachineCheckExce	RandolphCarter	it can be a possible solution to use a 32-bit linux, is it easy to do so?
