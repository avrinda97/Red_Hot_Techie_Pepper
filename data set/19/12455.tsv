2005-09-01T08:45:00.000Z	redguy	Ignignoktt	if you tell us what the problem is we might try to help
2005-09-01T08:46:00.000Z	Ignignoktt	redguy	excellent suggestion, but you see this is like my first day, so i just have a bunch of files waiting in a folder to be installed
2005-09-01T08:47:00.000Z	redguy	Ignignoktt	It seems that you downloaded amule source. Why dont you install it through synaptic?

2005-09-01T08:53:00.000Z	Ignignoktt	redguy	yes it is
2005-09-01T08:54:00.000Z	Ignignoktt	redguy	should i remove the repos that i have added
2005-09-01T08:54:00.000Z	redguy	Ignignoktt	read the link ubotu sent you and make your sources.list like these. amule is in the universe repository
2005-09-01T08:56:00.000Z	redguy	Ignignoktt	if that was your *whole* sources.list file it means that you have disabled all ubuntu repositories. No security updates, no nothing.
2005-09-01T08:56:00.000Z	redguy	Ignignoktt	read the synaptic wiki as well if you haven't read it already
2005-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	Ignignoktt	redguy	ty man, succesful installation, your like a noobs god
2005-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	redguy	Ignignoktt	hah, I didn't write those wikis you know :-)
