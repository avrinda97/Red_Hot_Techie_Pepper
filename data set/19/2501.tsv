2010-04-07T12:42:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	actually if you pastebin, paste everything: "cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log"
2010-04-07T12:43:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	Here it is http://pastebin.com/MRASU9GB
2010-04-07T12:43:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	you are using driver "vesa"
2010-04-07T12:44:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	which is an standard graphics drive that support 1024x768 resolution (maybe more?)
2010-04-07T12:44:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	: how can I change that it to the one supplied by intel ?
2010-04-07T12:44:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-04-07T12:45:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	look where is vesa and change to intel, if you are going to use any driver supplied by their site so you must follow their instructions
2010-04-07T12:46:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	there is no xorg.conf under /etc/X11
2010-04-07T12:46:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	that is the default behavior
2010-04-07T12:47:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	and if you are using vesa then it was configured automatically already
2010-04-07T12:47:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	: Intel supplies some device drivers for this motherboard so I wanted to install that
2010-04-07T12:48:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	these are linux drivers ? So follow their instructions/installer
2010-04-07T13:07:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	: lspci listed the driver it is currently using
2010-04-07T13:07:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	, no, lspci showed your hardware
2010-04-07T13:08:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	: it is not the driver currently it is using huh!
2010-04-07T13:09:00.000Z	maginot	ravibn	no, its is not. You can get even more information with lspci -vvv && lsusb, etc
2010-04-07T13:12:00.000Z	ravibn	maginot	: just give me idea to uninstall this and reinstall the driver supplied by intel
