2005-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	Moof		is there a program I can use to recode filenames?
2005-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	calc	Moof	recode how?
2005-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	Moof		well
2005-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	Moof		I've been movin files with non-acii filenames between machines with deffrent locale encodings, as you do. I now have filenames in cp850, iso-8859-1 and utf-8. I'd rather like them all to be in utf-8
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	calc	Moof	oh hmm, not sure how that works
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	calc		linux doesn't store filenames by default in unicode?
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	Moof		this is one thin windows got right. we shoudl just store filenames in some unicode standard on disk as standard and then transcode for the current locale.
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	calc		er utf-8 i mean
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	Moof	calc	nope
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	Moof	calc	linux just stores strings
2005-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	calc		so how can you tell which format its stored in?
2005-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	Moof		it's up to your locale as to how they are displayed
2005-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	Moof	calc	I can't.
2005-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	calc		ah fun :\
2005-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	Moof		I just happen to know which ones are which
2005-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	Moof	calc	hoary will store it all in unicode by default.
2005-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	Moof		yeah
2005-01-18T16:48:00.000Z	calc	Moof	oh ok, since the default locale using utf-8 it encodes into utf-8 then?
2005-01-18T16:48:00.000Z	Moof	calc	exactly
