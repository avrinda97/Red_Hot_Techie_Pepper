2008-12-12T17:46:00.000Z	kamizu		phew
2008-12-12T17:46:00.000Z	kamizu		i turned my comp off at the power switch and turn it back on and it works now
2008-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	kamizu		umm..... how can i back up my entire drive? i want to unraid my drives.......
2008-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	hmm, but you want a backup that will then be readable under linux?
2008-12-12T17:51:00.000Z	kamizu	Radtoo	nope, i'm going to install windows again
2008-12-12T17:51:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	yes, it should work if you do it right
2008-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	Agreed. From the linux point of view, you just should keep in mind that you want to have some unpartitioned space after putting the backup back. :)
2008-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	kamizu	Radtoo	but can i put it on my unraided drives and then boot from it?
2008-12-12T17:55:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	You can mostl likely do that but probably not without moving the data off the raid first. Caveats may apply depending on windews version. ##windows might know. :)
2008-12-12T17:56:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	might work with a linux called "clonezilla"
2008-12-12T18:01:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	windows never made it compatible. :)
2008-12-12T18:01:00.000Z	Radtoo	kamizu	There's a things that work between BSD, Solaris, Linux, OSX and more that won't work with windows, either. :D
