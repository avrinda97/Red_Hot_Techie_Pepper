2010-05-08T07:08:00.000Z	techzg	acerimmer	yes, I did that. I clicked on 'test' and nothing happened
2010-05-08T07:09:00.000Z	acerimmer	techzg	Pretty sure your camera isn't recognized by ubuntu.  might need to check the webcam site for a linux driver
2010-05-08T07:09:00.000Z	techzg	acerimmer	It did work earlier though but, I don't why it doesn't work now.
2010-05-08T07:10:00.000Z	techzg	acerimmer	skype does show that I have a webcam
2010-05-08T07:10:00.000Z	acerimmer	techzg	worked with earlier ubuntu?
2010-05-08T07:10:00.000Z	techzg	acerimmer	yes

2010-05-08T07:11:00.000Z	acerimmer	techzg	internal or external cam
2010-05-08T07:11:00.000Z	techzg	acerimmer	internal cam
2010-05-08T07:12:00.000Z	acerimmer	techzg	google the cam manufacturer and see if there's an updated linux driver.  sorry can't help more.  My upgrde went embarrassingly smooth.
