2009-02-15T06:45:00.000Z	ashlessburn		ishmeal:i use lilo for backtrack if it wasnt for that i would have never used it
2009-02-15T06:46:00.000Z	ZiRiS	ashlessburn	I have been changing first boot drive from linux drive (ide) to vista drive (eSATA) when I want to go back and forth. GRUB has never been on the  vista drive.
2009-02-15T06:46:00.000Z	ashlessburn		well doign that u are asking for trouble try reading up on the grub part, u can actually boot vista and ubunut off grub
2009-02-15T06:48:00.000Z	ZiRiS	ashlessburn	I also booted to the Kubuntu live cd, and ran the grub utility from there. It returned some sort of exit error 1, there must have been an error. and won't load GRUB to the mbr.
2009-02-15T06:48:00.000Z	ashlessburn		ishmeal: unfort u are correct u have to open the lilo.conf fill to run other part in the same aspect or it will error out
2009-02-15T06:48:00.000Z	ashlessburn		hmm seems u might want to look into rebuilding ur grub platform
2009-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	ZiRiS	ashlessburn	I also booted to the ubuntu live cd and tried to reinstall grub from the apt utility.
2009-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	ashlessburn		i run backtrack 3 ubuntu and debian 4.0 off grub tried lilo and was unsucceful on my 64bit but on 32bit i had no issues
2009-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	ashlessburn		and?
2009-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	ashlessburn		i find that platforms are a real issue with grub and lilo
2009-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	ashlessburn		using seprate bt parts
2009-02-15T06:52:00.000Z	ZiRiS	ashlessburn	I can try lilo from the supergrubdisk, see what happens.
