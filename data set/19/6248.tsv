2008-02-22T14:49:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	u know sir how to access root file?
2008-02-22T14:50:00.000Z	dgjones	Jigs	I don't know what format the .reg file is, but you could try "gksudo gedit /root/.wine/user.reg", that might work, I'm only guessing though
2008-02-22T14:50:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	k i'll try it
2008-02-22T14:50:00.000Z	dgjones	Jigs	if its a plain text file, I would think it'll work, do a backup copy before you change it though just in case
2008-02-22T14:52:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	i think the file is hidden
2008-02-22T14:52:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	is file hidden cant access?
2008-02-22T14:53:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	is hidden file cant access?
2008-02-22T14:53:00.000Z	dgjones	Jigs	if you open nautilus and you /home folder, there's an option to show hidden files & folders
2008-02-22T14:53:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	k i'll try it now
2008-02-22T14:55:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	i see the file is there... but cant access.. hmm i think that file is too shy to show/popup
2008-02-22T14:56:00.000Z	dgjones	Jigs	have you got wine running or an application running that uses wine? maybe the file is locked
2008-02-22T14:57:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	o i c, perhaps... ok i'll chk it out
2008-02-22T14:57:00.000Z	dgjones	Jigs	I don't use wine so can't help much more, maybe its worth you asking in #winehq - thats the main channel for wine queries
2008-02-22T14:57:00.000Z	Jigs	dgjones	u dont used wine? what program u are using?
2008-02-22T14:58:00.000Z	dgjones	Jigs	i don't run any windows apps
