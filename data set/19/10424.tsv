2012-11-14T06:54:00.000Z	Chain		This being the official support channel.. I assume indept and detailed questions are generally accepted?
2012-11-14T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	yes, just ask on one line (use a pastebin if you need to include logs, errors, and such)
2012-11-14T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	what did you want if it wasn't edubuntu?
2012-11-14T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	I'd probably just reinstall then with the iso I wanted
2012-11-14T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	no need to uninstall, just make sure that when you install you choose to overwrite the existing edubuntu install
2012-11-14T07:02:00.000Z	Chain	jrib	Alright, that's probably what I'll do.  I'm guessing somewhere in the installation process it will ask me about overwriting the existing edubuntu installation?
2012-11-14T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	maybe. You might need to choose "manual partitioning" and then just choose the partition that got used last time.  Not sure if there's some more straightforward "overwrite the last install" button
2012-11-14T07:04:00.000Z	Chain	jrib	Alright, well you said there isn't a need to uninstall.. is there a simple way to do it?  I feel as though that'd be an easier way for me not to miss something.
2012-11-14T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	your other option is to just delete the partitions eduubuntu is using and then have the installer use the free space
2012-11-14T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	(I don't think this is much easier)
2012-11-14T07:09:00.000Z	Chain	jrib	You're probably right.. um.. more information I thought I should include and might be important; for installation I went on the ubuntu website and just downloaded "Ubuntu Desktop Windows Installer" 12.10.  Is that what I should be doing?
2012-11-14T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	I'm not familiar with that.  I would just burn a disc and then boot from that
2012-11-14T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	actually, maybe you used wubi?
2012-11-14T07:11:00.000Z	Chain	jrib	I have no idea what wubi is.. I feel like this lack of knowledge is where my problem is coming from.
2012-11-14T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	yeah the "windows installer" seems to be wubi.  Wubi will just create a file on your windows partition instead of creating a separate partition for ubuntu.  Here's the uninstall procedure: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#Uninstallation
2012-11-14T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	going to bed now; others here can help if you have more questions
2012-11-14T07:12:00.000Z	Chain	jrib	Thanks for the help.  Now that I sortof understand what I should be doing, I'm gonna go give this a try.  Much appreciated!
2012-11-15T01:55:00.000Z	Chain	jrib	What you suggested was definitely part of my problem, I got it uninstalled and installed from a CD.
2012-11-15T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	Chain	cool
