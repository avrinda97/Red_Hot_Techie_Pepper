2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ph8		i've never found the cause
2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ph8		usb keyboard?
2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		ps2
2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ph8		not a cheap microsoft one by any chance if so?
2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ph8		is it a cheap microsoft ps2?
2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ph8		i think i have a ps2/usb adapter back here
2007-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		a previooous installation of ubunttttttu DIDN'T have this prrrroblem on the same pc and keyb
2007-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		it's just a standard cheapo keyb
2007-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		unbranded
2007-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	ph8		ah i see, it's obviously happening regularly for you as well rather than my seldom errors
2007-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		yup
2007-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	ph8		what are your preferences -> keyboard settings like?
2007-01-04T09:13:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		seems fine but maybe i hhhhave some sort of accessibility thing on by mistake
2007-01-04T09:14:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		nope
2007-01-04T09:14:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		keyboard settings seem normal
2007-01-04T09:15:00.000Z	Gothfunc_		i can't seem to replicate the error by tapping one key a lot or even mashing lots of keys... weird
2007-01-04T09:18:00.000Z	Gothfunc_	ph8	weird.. after loading keyb preferences and closing them again, the problem hasn'''''t appeard since...  oh...  i thought it had gone :(
