2005-08-26T16:05:00.000Z	redarrow		this might sound kinda dum.. but how do I install ubuntu onto hdd from the "live cd" ??
2005-08-26T16:05:00.000Z	redarrow		oh?
2005-08-26T16:06:00.000Z	redarrow		great
2005-08-26T16:08:00.000Z	redarrow		so .. uh .. it's positivley impossible then?? I cant copy the kernel image onto hdd as well as all the data files?
2005-08-26T16:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	it's not designed to be installed from; maybe you can hack it, but I have no idea how. Probably more trouble than it's worth
2005-08-26T16:10:00.000Z	redarrow	HappyFool	*oh well* - I wonder why they don't put the install disk on those "toasters"
2005-08-26T16:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	i thought they did (not that i've used one). Which one did you use?
2005-08-26T16:11:00.000Z	redarrow	HappyFool	Port Elizabeth.. It's only got the live CD
2005-08-26T16:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	oh, i see you're right. that is very silly
2005-08-26T16:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	there aren't even any requests for it here: http://www.freedomtoaster.org/?q=node/29
2005-08-26T16:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	oh, hang on. if i look at this page: http://www.freedomtoaster.org/?q=node/29   the implication is that the hoary CD is there
2005-08-26T16:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	"Ubuntu Warty, Hoary and Hoary Live CD" -- i read that as everything but Warty Live CD
2005-08-26T16:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	i've never used one, as i said, so i don't know. my suspicion is that you did miss something. Not having the install CD would be a very odd, given who is funding the toaster.
2005-08-26T16:19:00.000Z	redarrow	HappyFool	Yea I guess...  I'll go have another look as soon as I get the chance
2005-08-26T16:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	i'm waiting for breezy to be released to try it
2005-08-26T16:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	fairly easy to use? general impressions?
2005-08-26T16:20:00.000Z	redarrow	HappyFool	Oh yes, something like an ATM, just poke, poke, insert cd, and zip!
2005-08-26T16:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	redarrow	cool. i'm tempted to go just to try it out ;)
2005-08-26T16:22:00.000Z	redarrow	HappyFool	Actually that's probably why I iniatially went ;)
