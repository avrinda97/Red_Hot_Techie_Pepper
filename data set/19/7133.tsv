2007-10-24T20:56:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	mumble is in the repos
2007-10-24T21:03:00.000Z	thechef	GodOfWalmart	Which repository? I can't find a mumble package. Can you pass me a deb-src line?
2007-10-24T21:03:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	it's been a while sense I installed it, I think it's in the repos
2007-10-24T21:04:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	if not, they should have the deb on their website
2007-10-24T21:04:00.000Z	thechef	GodOfWalmart	yes, they have debs. But I really need a source package.
2007-10-24T21:05:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	it looks like i might have installed it from a deb i got from sourceforge, you can get the source from sourceforge. If the don't have the tar.gzip they'll have a subversion repo that you can get it all from
2007-10-24T21:06:00.000Z	thechef	GodOfWalmart	mmh, do you know a way how i can create a source package using the source and the information inside the binary package?
2007-10-24T21:07:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	I don't think that's possible, you mean get the source code from the binary? Unless you decompile it, no
2007-10-24T21:07:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	if you mean package it to a deb, yes. But I don't know how
2007-10-24T21:07:00.000Z	thechef	GodOfWalmart	No, no decompilation. But there is dependency information and so on, that i can use. Source seperately.
2007-10-24T21:08:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	the deb should find the dependencies automatically when attempting to install
2007-10-24T21:09:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	http://pastebin.com/m57eca398
2007-10-24T21:09:00.000Z	thechef	GodOfWalmart	I want a mumble source directory where I can just type: fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage
2007-10-24T21:10:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	that pastebin tells you the dependancies
2007-10-24T21:10:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	you can add the subversion as a repository
2007-10-24T21:10:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	I'm not exactly sure how, but I've seen it done before
2007-10-24T21:15:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	did you find it?
2007-10-24T21:17:00.000Z	thechef	GodOfWalmart	I didn't find what I need
2007-10-24T21:18:00.000Z	GodOfWalmart	thechef	I know there's a way to set a sourceforge subversion as a repository
