2007-01-28T12:30:00.000Z	Alpha232		ok... can someone help with building apache2 on ubuntu? there is no make file or anything
2007-01-28T12:30:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	configure script?
2007-01-28T12:31:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	i did apt-get source apache2
2007-01-28T12:31:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	perl makefile?
2007-01-28T12:31:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	nope...
2007-01-28T12:31:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	um, pastebin the directory?
2007-01-28T12:33:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	would you pastebin an ls of the source directory?
2007-01-28T12:34:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	which pastebin do you guys use
2007-01-28T12:35:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/3171/
2007-01-28T12:37:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	yeah exactly
2007-01-28T12:37:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	get it from apache.org
2007-01-28T12:39:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	but i need it to be built the way ubuntu's is
2007-01-28T12:57:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	they provide source mostly so you can build the package natively, i think
2007-01-28T12:57:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	natively as in what?
2007-01-28T12:57:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	natively as in, not just some generic i386 package, but optimized for your system
2007-01-28T12:58:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	but seriously, you should just build from apache.org's sources... apache doesn't need to integrate that much with other stuff
2007-01-28T13:00:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	watch the language, you'll get kicked in a moment
2007-01-28T13:10:00.000Z	graft	Alpha232	you got apache2_2.0.55.orig.tar.gz?
2007-01-28T13:11:00.000Z	Alpha232	graft	no that didn't come down with the source.. i have apache2_2.0.55.orig.tar.gz and apache2_2.0.55-4ubuntu2.1.diff.gz
