2010-07-12T16:14:00.000Z	darth_tux71		first off are you using a stupid password?
2010-07-12T16:14:00.000Z	darth_tux71		I used a 40 key random hit WPA3
2010-07-12T16:14:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	WPA3 doesn't exist ;)
2010-08-21T12:50:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	considering that this is an Ubuntu channel, and thus Sabayon is offtopic for it... try #sabayon or something?
2010-08-21T12:51:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	It doesn't matter what kernel they use. It's not Ubuntu, it isn't supported here.
2010-08-21T12:54:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	then your 12-hour ago self can get support help here.
2010-08-21T12:54:00.000Z	darth_tux71	rww	please
2010-08-21T12:54:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	#debian doesn't support Ubuntu, #ubuntu doesn't support random other distros, random other distros' channels don't support Ubuntu or Debian.
2010-08-21T12:55:00.000Z	darth_tux71	rww	and that is the problem with Linux the dist wars no one wants to just be open to the OS it has to be this or that dist or you're sol
2010-08-21T12:55:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	It's not a matter of distro wars, it's a matter of there being subtle differences between different distributions that confuse support help.
2010-08-21T12:56:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	then go to your distribution channel or ##linux. Not here.
2010-08-21T12:56:00.000Z	darth_tux71	rww	kiss my ass ill go where I want
2010-08-21T13:01:00.000Z	rww	darth_tux71	"violating the channel guidelines" and "no reason" are somewhat different
