2007-04-14T07:04:00.000Z	dj-fu		launcher for what
2007-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	a launcher for xampp
2007-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	dj-fu		and what's asking for a password, xampp?
2007-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	which you have to run as root, but i'd rather not have to type the password every time i open xampp
2007-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	dj-fu		are you launching it via sudo?
2007-04-14T07:06:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	yes, and i was wondering whether i can add something to the launcher to automatically pass it
2007-04-14T07:06:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	yep
2007-04-14T07:06:00.000Z	dj-fu		you can configure sudo so it doesn't require a password for a certain command.
2007-04-14T07:07:00.000Z	NBrepresent		can i just add a second command after the first? because really all i need to do is pass some characters to the terminal window
2007-04-14T07:07:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	i mean, a second command, within the same launcher?
2007-04-14T07:07:00.000Z	dj-fu	NBrepresent	I'd do it via the sudoers file.
2007-04-14T07:07:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	ok, where can i find that file?
2007-04-14T07:08:00.000Z	dj-fu		something like %admin ALL = NOPASSWD: /path/to/xampp/file/that/is/being/launched
2007-04-14T07:08:00.000Z	dj-fu		type visudo
2007-04-14T07:08:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	great, where do i find the sudoers file?
2007-04-14T07:08:00.000Z	dj-fu		type visudo
2007-04-14T07:10:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	does :wq save and quit?
2007-04-14T07:12:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dj-fu	NessieLiberation, thanks, that's done the trick.
2007-04-14T07:12:00.000Z	dj-fu	NBrepresent	in vi, esc; shift+zz to save
