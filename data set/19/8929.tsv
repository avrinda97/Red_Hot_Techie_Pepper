2007-02-04T15:47:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 echo $HOSTNAME
2007-02-04T15:47:00.000Z	imbecile	unop	 thanks
2007-02-04T15:47:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 or even hostname
2007-02-04T15:50:00.000Z	imbecile	unop	 i'm tryying to setup tightvnc I type my hostname inbut it isnt working.. I think i may be doing it wrong. any idea?
2007-02-04T15:50:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 have you got a vnc server instance running under your user account on the server?
2007-02-04T15:51:00.000Z	imbecile	unop	ive got a tight vnc session running under win and im trying to log in
2007-02-04T15:53:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 ok, first try logging into vnc from the windows machine itself -- try logging into 127.0.0.1:1
2007-02-04T15:53:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 actually? does the windows machine happen to run windows XP pro?
2007-02-04T15:53:00.000Z	imbecile	unop	 yes
2007-02-04T15:54:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 why dont you use the windows remote desktop then?
2007-02-04T15:54:00.000Z	imbecile	unop	 hehe i spose i could
2007-02-04T15:56:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 if you use tsclient/rdesktop you can access your windows machine provided it's allowing remote desktop connections
2007-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 probably -- try it out
2007-02-06T13:56:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 yes and no .. linux+ is focused on installing and administering for the use in business networks -- but linux on the otherhand doesnt cover a niche, it's just not confined that way
2007-02-06T13:57:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 there are some ubuntu certifications that probably hold more credibility than the linux+, you probably also learn more (about ubuntu)
2007-02-06T14:04:00.000Z	imbecile	unop	do you know the names of any ubuntu certs?
2007-02-06T14:05:00.000Z	unop	imbecile	 have a read here http://lwn.net/Articles/178373/
