2009-01-29T21:12:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	what software are you looking for?
2009-01-29T21:13:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	do you need the operating system on cd/dvd? See the shop: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu
2009-01-29T21:14:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	how would anyone know what collection you want on such a dvd?
2009-01-29T21:14:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	other than creating it yourselves... (like what ikonia said)
2009-01-29T21:18:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	that's about 80GB
2009-01-29T21:18:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	oh, 70GB according to ikonia.
2009-01-29T21:20:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	as I told you, you cannot just have a part of the repository.
2009-01-29T21:22:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	no, that's not how the repos work
2009-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	please elaborate. Explain what it is that you want to accomplish
2009-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	changes like what?
2009-01-29T21:28:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	sure, no one will stop you from doing that
2009-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	but probably few will help you if you do
2009-01-29T21:30:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	there is no procedure
2009-01-29T21:34:00.000Z	oCean_	amanu	you may want to join one of the development or kernel channels on irc.
