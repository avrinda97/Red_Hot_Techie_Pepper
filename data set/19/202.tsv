2012-06-30T09:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	gparted is on the ubuntu cd.. why do you need a new CD making?

2012-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	croz	ActionParsnip	I am on a Live CD and in gparted when I double click the extended partition that contains the logical partition it says (At least one logical partition is mounted). How can I fix this so I can increase the size of my linux partition
2012-06-30T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	run:  mount    and check
2012-06-30T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	its umount, not unmount
2012-06-30T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	mount on it's own shows the currently mounted file systems
2012-06-30T09:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	run:  gksudo gparted   then and it will be ok
2012-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	you can unmount in cli then
2012-06-30T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	croz	what partition can you not unmount in the GUI?
