2006-08-24T05:28:00.000Z	neuroe		hello
2006-08-24T05:29:00.000Z	neuroe		i think i broke something
2006-08-24T05:30:00.000Z	neuroe		can someone help me?
2006-08-24T05:31:00.000Z	neuroe		i tried to move a folder and now my start up themes stoped working, everything looks like it did before but the theme chooser is coming up blank
2006-08-24T05:32:00.000Z	npodges	neuroe	what theme?
2006-08-24T05:32:00.000Z	npodges		folder**
2006-08-24T05:32:00.000Z	neuroe		the startup themes
2006-08-24T05:32:00.000Z	neuroe		usr/share/gdm/themes
2006-08-24T05:32:00.000Z	neuroe		nothing moved
2006-08-24T05:33:00.000Z	neuroe		i used the command sudo mv -t EarthLights /usr/share/gdm/themes
2006-08-24T05:33:00.000Z	npodges		you should install the theme using the gui
2006-08-24T05:33:00.000Z	npodges		in system>admin>login window
2006-08-24T05:33:00.000Z	neuroe		yea i noticed that but it's too late
2006-08-24T05:34:00.000Z	neuroe		the folders are all still there i don't understand what happened
2006-08-24T05:35:00.000Z	neuroe		both the folder i tried the move and the folders that were in the directory i tried to move them too
2006-08-24T05:35:00.000Z	npodges		are you sure thats what broke it then, neuroe?
2006-08-24T05:36:00.000Z	neuroe		the theme chooser has no themes to choose
2006-08-24T05:36:00.000Z	neuroe		i'm afraid if i reboot that there will be no theme at the login screen and i won't be able to log in
2006-08-24T05:39:00.000Z	neuroe	npodges	do you know what that command did?
