2011-11-07T05:49:00.000Z	MagBo		the matter is that it doesn't respond to keypresses
2011-11-07T05:51:00.000Z	MagBo		:((
2011-11-07T05:52:00.000Z	MagBo		no cds or anything
2011-11-07T05:53:00.000Z	MagBo		worst thing is that it's 3AM here
2011-11-07T05:53:00.000Z	strix_	MagBo	what you are trying to accomplish?
2011-11-07T05:53:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	I need ubuntu live usb with the following stuff:
2011-11-07T05:54:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	as I have already told, my setup is Win7 PC and 2GB usb stick
2011-11-07T05:54:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	what I face is irresponsive "GRUB" line upon boot
2011-11-07T05:55:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	can I try to use wubi to install ubuntu on usb stick? :D
2011-11-07T05:56:00.000Z	strix_	MagBo	you could use 11.10 on usb stick through pendrivelinux.com installer + 700 Mb or what's left for persistent storage, then boot ubuntu and apt-get the rest
2011-11-07T05:58:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	I tried to. but I'm facing irresponsive "GRUB" that's printed on screen w/o any chance to put kernel and initrd lines in
2011-11-07T06:01:00.000Z	strix_	MagBo	:(
2011-11-07T06:53:00.000Z	strix_	MagBo	so you have Ubuntu usb flash drive, you just can't boot from it?
2011-11-07T06:54:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	yes. :(
2011-11-07T06:54:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	anyway, atm I already have archlinux usb flash drive that's bootable :D
2011-11-07T06:56:00.000Z	strix_	MagBo	in that case, did you properly setup BIOS to boot from usb?
2011-11-07T06:57:00.000Z	MagBo	strix_	yes I have. see, I have already booted from archlinux :D
2011-11-07T06:58:00.000Z	strix_	MagBo	ah, ok
