2009-05-14T15:53:00.000Z	juxta		i'd like to modify my install so that i boot from a USB drive, which runs my initrd etc, and mounts my encrypted filesystems. does anybody know of any information which might point me in the right directtion?
2009-05-14T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	use the alternatie install CD and you can do that within the install routine
2009-05-14T15:53:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	the system is already setup, hehe :)
2009-05-14T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	you can manually do it then,
2009-05-14T15:54:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	yep, thats what I want to do, but I'm not too sure where to start :)
2009-05-14T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	first thing is make your boot partition and test and get that working
2009-05-14T15:54:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	on the usb drive you mean?
2009-05-14T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	where ever you want
2009-05-14T15:57:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	ok, i will give it a go. I'm trying to get my head around how it should work - grub etc will reside on the USB drive i'm guessing, and the initrd on the drive will take care of mounting all the filesytems, etc? then once they're mounded, the boot will be passed off to the mounted filesystems?
2009-05-14T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	sounds sensible, assuming you can boot from usb
2009-05-14T15:57:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	yeah - there's hardware support to boot from USB
2009-05-14T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	sounds good then
2009-05-14T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	you'll need to put grub on the boot sector of the usb drive too
2009-05-14T15:59:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	ah, right - good point
2009-05-14T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	as long as your fstab is correct won't be any problem
2009-05-14T16:01:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	the USB drive will need to be inserted to do kernel updates and the like though, wont it?
2009-05-14T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	usb drive will need to be inserted for any access to /boot
2009-05-14T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	juxta	which includes kernel updates
2009-05-14T16:07:00.000Z	juxta	ikonia	sorry to keep bugging you. if i go ahead and do this, when I encrypt the root fs, will the /etc/cryptab somehow be incorporated into the initrd image?
