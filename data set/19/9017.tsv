2007-02-17T12:54:00.000Z	user_		have you tried to google setup-ubuntu-full.exe ?

2007-02-17T12:56:00.000Z	user_		i'm just gonna ignore you
2007-02-17T12:56:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Likewise... oh, and welcome to Linux :)
2007-02-17T12:51:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	.exe files can only be used on Windows-based systems... I have no clue why Ubuntu would have any kind of .exe file.
2007-02-17T12:52:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	It won't.  Where did you get it?
2007-02-17T12:53:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Uhm, you're the one trying to install Linux from within Windows...  you came here for help.  Don't bother insulting those willing to help ... you won't get very far.
2007-02-17T12:55:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Why would I?  I'm not the one having the problem.
2007-02-17T12:55:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Installing Ubuntu works just perfectly setting up dual boot... I've never needed a Windows program to do it for me.
2007-02-17T12:56:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Well, you've been unsuccessful in your endeavor, have you not?
2007-02-17T12:57:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Uhm, was this a torrent file that you downloaded?
2007-02-17T13:01:00.000Z	elyon225	user_	Then do it already.
