2007-03-18T10:30:00.000Z	JAyRULE		how do i enable a printer using 6.06 ubuntu server?
2007-03-18T10:30:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	you turn the printer on first
2007-03-18T10:31:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	thanks, but whats the command to print
2007-03-18T10:31:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	lpr
2007-03-18T10:34:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	well how do i install the printer. lpr asks for a name of the printer)
2007-03-18T10:35:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	im using 6.06 lts server, so im dealing with just the terminal
2007-03-18T10:35:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	you go to Systems -->Printing
2007-03-18T10:35:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	i dont have the gui installed
2007-03-18T10:36:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	then you need to google for the tutorial, i cant remember all the LPD stuff, which config files and such..but its not overly difficult
2007-03-18T10:38:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	yeah thats why i showed up here, because my searches display how tos, assuming a desktop gui is installed
2007-03-18T10:39:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	umm i dont think you need the gui, the dpkg will install the necessary stuff for printing, just need to find out which package the printing manager is on
2007-03-18T10:39:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	so first thing is find out which package is for the printingmanager or maybe it is called cups...
2007-03-18T10:40:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	yeah, i installed cups because i would eventually like to print from other pc's on the same network.
2007-03-18T10:41:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	however, i dont know how to access the printer locally
2007-03-18T10:42:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	i already told you lpr    if not sure still, do this  apropos  printer and you see bunch of printer related commands
2007-03-18T10:43:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	well yeah, i tried lpr, but it's asking for the name of the printer
2007-03-18T10:44:00.000Z	bulmer	JAyRULE	you can dpkg install cups and use a web browser to manage it , its port 631 to manage it
2007-03-18T10:45:00.000Z	JAyRULE	bulmer	ahh okay ill give that a shot.  thanks
