2007-05-06T10:06:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	No!
2007-05-06T10:11:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Check your xorg.conf
2007-05-06T10:13:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Okay then, it didn't get around to writing it.
2007-05-06T10:15:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	You chose the fglrx driver?
2007-05-06T10:16:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	If you chose the fglrx driver, reboot now and you should be okay.
2007-05-06T10:18:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Weird.
2007-05-06T10:22:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2007-05-06T10:23:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Wait until Xorg asks you to look at the output.
2007-05-06T10:26:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Yeah.
2007-05-06T10:27:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Why not?
2007-05-06T10:27:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Well, then boot into recovery mode.
2007-05-06T10:28:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Try and start X as normal.
2007-05-06T10:30:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Don't know, it's variable...
2007-05-06T10:32:00.000Z	SeveredCross	^Erasmus^	Not that I know of.
