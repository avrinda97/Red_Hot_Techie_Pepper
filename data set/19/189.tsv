2012-07-09T05:32:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Ops
2012-07-09T05:33:00.000Z	Griffrez_		What was the code I had to put so it runs on Terminal, again?
2012-07-09T05:34:00.000Z	chu	Griffrez_	You want the bash she-bang again?
2012-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Yeah
2012-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	chu	Griffrez_	#!/bin/bash
2012-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Sorry. I closed IRC. :|
2012-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Thanks
2012-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	Griffrez_		So, I just have to put that as the first line
2012-07-09T05:35:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Then under that, type the code, right?
2012-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	chu		Yeah, but you also know you need to change the bit flag (err, I may have the wrong terminology here) to executable, right?
2012-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	chu	Griffrez_	That message was for you.
2012-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Oh
2012-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	Griffrez_		Yeah
2012-07-09T05:36:00.000Z	Griffrez_	chu	The file's properties?
2012-07-09T05:37:00.000Z	Griffrez_	chu	I've done that. Thanks for the help. :)
2012-07-09T05:37:00.000Z	Griffrez_	chu	Ah. Minecraft on 100FPS. I think I never did that on Windows. xD
2012-07-09T05:38:00.000Z	chu	Griffrez_	To change it to executable, you run "chmod +x <file-name>" but it's probably possible through the file properties dialog, so I will assume you know what you're doing :)
2012-07-09T05:38:00.000Z	Griffrez_	chu	Yeah. It's working fine. :)
2012-07-09T05:38:00.000Z	Griffrez_	chu	Thanks, though. :D
