2007-08-01T11:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	you don't keep backups?
2007-08-01T11:07:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	you should always keep backups of important files. Windows or Ubuntu. Please watch your language.
2007-08-01T11:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	that's not ubuntu's fault if windows faults.
2007-08-01T11:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	see ##windows for windows support
2007-08-01T11:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	have you closed and restarted gnucash perhaps?
2007-08-01T11:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	you never know....?
2007-08-01T11:12:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	you might want to talk to Anlar about those backups :)
2007-08-01T11:12:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	try a server install, then install fluxbox or something light like that
2007-08-01T11:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	you're running a custom kernel?
2007-08-01T11:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	Ruled	Please stop trolling.
