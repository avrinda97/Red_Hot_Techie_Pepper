2007-03-24T10:34:00.000Z	davidfetter		i just burned a 7.0.4beta CD, and i'd like to try it out on my macbookpro
2007-03-24T10:34:00.000Z	davidfetter		how do i get the aforementioned machine to boot from CD?
2007-03-24T10:35:00.000Z	davidfetter		anybody?
2007-03-24T10:36:00.000Z	aoirthoir	davidfetter	dont know sorry
2007-03-24T10:36:00.000Z	davidfetter	aoirthoir	any ideas where i might look?
2007-03-24T10:36:00.000Z	aoirthoir	davidfetter	you can test it in a virtual machine..dont know how that works on macbook
2007-03-24T10:36:00.000Z	aoirthoir		david..kinda like the thing you use to run windows on mac
2007-03-24T10:36:00.000Z	davidfetter	aoirthoir	i was thinking it might be possible to boot off an iso...
2007-03-24T10:36:00.000Z	davidfetter	aoirthoir	ok, i'll start looking. thanks :)
2007-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	aoirthoir	davidfetter	if your macbook pro allows booting directly from CD....
2007-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	aoirthoir	davidfetter	you could put it on CD and tell the mac to boot from cd ..see if it recognizes it..I assume you got the iso for macs?
2007-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	davidfetter	aoirthoir	that's what i'm looking for the way to do.
2007-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	davidfetter	aoirthoir	it's an intel mac, so i got the intel cd
2007-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	aoirthoir	davidfetter	dont know how it works in the mac world..never used one..but in a pc it is in your CMOS..
2007-03-24T10:38:00.000Z	davidfetter		k
2007-03-24T10:38:00.000Z	davidfetter	aoirthoir	thanks for the help :P
