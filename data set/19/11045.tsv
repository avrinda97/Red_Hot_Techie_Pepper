2006-04-19T08:15:00.000Z	jramsey		help with the tar cmd to extract the kernel source?? i have tried tar -xf linux-source-2.6.12.tar
2006-04-19T08:16:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	tar -xvf linux-source I would think, try tossing a sudo in front
2006-04-19T08:16:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	man tar I bet would help
2006-04-19T08:16:00.000Z	jramsey	NickGarvey	been man'ing ... but ur cmd did it ... it's untarring like mad ty ...
2006-04-19T08:17:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	I think it was working before, but just didn't show you that it was working
2006-04-19T08:17:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	the v is verbose I assume
2006-04-19T08:17:00.000Z	jramsey	NickGarvey	probably; it's a huge tar and the v gives me some comfort
2006-04-19T08:19:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	that tells you the version number
2006-04-19T08:19:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	:)

2006-04-19T08:20:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	uh no idea, but you can do a find command,  "find -name *headers*
2006-04-19T08:21:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	or something along those lines heh

2006-04-19T08:26:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	I don't totally understand.
2006-04-19T08:27:00.000Z	jramsey	NickGarvey	ok in C source there are includes like #include <linux/math.h> is "linux" a sumbolically linked folder? u know what i mean?? with ln?
2006-04-19T08:29:00.000Z	NickGarvey	jramsey	yes I understand, but I know nothing about the compiler, I don't program although I know some of the very basics of C
