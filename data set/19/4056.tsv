2009-04-02T15:45:00.000Z	micca		the day linux offers a platform for the regular user (in this case ' gamer' ) to add that to linux.. the ocmpanies will seriously start lending thought to that area I think
2009-04-02T15:47:00.000Z	micca		I guess for excitement, instead of civ 4 or something.. i'll just squeeze and twist my nipples a bit then ^^

2009-04-02T15:52:00.000Z	micca		thank you clearscreen
2009-04-02T15:53:00.000Z	micca		one more question in that relation clearscreen : when I update all these packages.. and want to keep my system backed up (i.e. I would reinstall and didnt want to go through the whole rememebring what to download, configuring etc), how do I go about and saving all?
2009-04-02T15:55:00.000Z	clearscreen	micca	user specific settings are saved in your homefolder, they are often hidden folders though (starting with a .) ... just open nautilus, browse to your home folder, and hit CTRL+H
2009-04-02T15:55:00.000Z	clearscreen	micca	those are just settings though, I'm afraid you're gonna have to redownload the packages again
2009-04-02T16:01:00.000Z	clearscreen		!ask | maniere
2009-04-02T16:01:00.000Z	micca	clearscreen	I lately was using somethign called WAIK in vista.. to slipstream it.. and also used a audit mode to install everything as I want it... (like all the basic programs and updates) booted back into oobe (out of box final state) and made a 'recovery' image.. is there not a way to do this in linux somewhat similarly in principle?
2009-04-02T16:01:00.000Z	clearscreen	micca	probably, I wouldn't know how though :P
