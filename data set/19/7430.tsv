2007-10-21T04:36:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	my mouse pointer works fine for a while, then starts randomly disappearing when different pointers are used. If I disable HWCursor, it works fine, but then I can't use COmpiz.
2008-04-20T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cdm10	 thers dozens of converters and scripts out to do that task.  :)
2012-05-06T10:45:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	I've had some significantly screwy files, mostly from torrents and expanding VM images, which almost INEVITABLY get fragmented if they're not preallocated.
2012-05-06T10:46:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	you mean extents?
2012-05-06T10:46:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	for something like a VM image file, which will expand bytes at a time, that does very little.
2012-05-06T11:02:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	that's not HUD, you'd need to hit Super/WinKey -- or you just search items in current app's menu!
2012-05-06T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cdm10	  alt key is hud - i belive.
2012-05-06T11:03:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	right, but that searches the current app's menus, not the entire system.
2012-05-06T11:04:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	really... I thought that's what dash was for...
2012-05-06T11:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cdm10	 hud i belive is integerated witht he global menu stuff. so it  has a farther reach then dash
2012-05-06T11:07:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	looks to me like that only searches the menu of the app you're in! It's dash that searches your system's apps. Unless somehow we're both running different Ubuntus :P
2012-05-06T11:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cdm10	 it definatly does not search just the app you are in.. Those entries are at the top however i noticed. if theres any similer
2012-05-06T11:08:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	whoops, looks like I was wrong.
2012-05-06T11:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cdm10	 :) in xchat now. alt -> 'add' ->    >> Hardware > addational-drivers   (first item)
2012-05-06T11:09:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	weirdly, I don't see that, though I do see things for other apps. Oh well.
2012-05-06T11:10:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	what I found completely bizarre was that apparently an auto-hiding dock by default was too mysterious and confusing for regular users, according to the UI designers, but hiding all the menus by default unless you mouseover them was just fine.
2012-05-06T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cdm10	 i always set the panel to never hide. :)  people have been trained to know menus are at the top..  but not that apps are at the left...
2012-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	cdm10	Dr_willis	only mac users, I'd think... and not those new to computers at all... actually, autohiding dock by default would be silly, but I wish we had that behavior from older Unity (I think) which only autohides the dock if there's a window that also wants to be there.
