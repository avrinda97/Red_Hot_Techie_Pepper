2008-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	Bkid		8 years?
2008-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	Bkid		something like that
2008-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	Bkid		actually I do use it for gaming, timandtom
2008-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	Bkid		this laptop is currently dual booted with ubuntu and xp
2008-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	Bkid		:P
2008-05-01T05:36:00.000Z	Bkid		sour: xchat and xchat-gnome are both in there (applications -> internet)
2008-05-01T05:36:00.000Z	Bkid		what is the real difference?
2008-05-01T05:37:00.000Z	Bkid		i wouldn't even know where to begin when uninstalling :P
2008-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	Bkid		o
2008-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	Bkid		so for the record, I wonder why I was having trouble compiling xchat
2008-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	Wyzard	Bkid	Why were you compiling xchat when it's packaged already?
2008-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	Bkid		no no i'm not
2008-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	Bkid		i'm just saying
2008-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	Bkid		i DID try that before and it didn't work
2008-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	Wyzard	Bkid	well, "having trouble compiling" isn't enough info for anyone to be able to suggest what the problem might've been
2008-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	Wyzard	Bkid	but in general you should avoid compiling stuff from source, and stick with packages
2008-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	Bkid	Wyzard	yeah I know
2008-05-01T05:40:00.000Z	Bkid	Wyzard	but to avoid future problems, I'm assuming I should get gettext on here
2008-05-01T05:40:00.000Z	Wyzard	Bkid	That's packaged too, and things which need it will pull it in automatically
