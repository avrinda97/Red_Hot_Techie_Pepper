2011-09-07T00:19:00.000Z	TeleportLisa		Hello everyone. I just installed 11.04 and it does not seem to recognise my cd-rom at all. Any thoughts?
2011-09-07T00:20:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	eject   #Tell us what happens
2011-09-07T00:20:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	or what error you get...
2011-09-07T00:23:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	What type of CDROM is it?  IDE?  or...?
2011-09-07T00:23:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	Is this a desktop computer or laptop or...?
2011-09-07T00:25:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	ls -l /dev/cdrom | pastebinit
2011-09-07T00:25:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	or just tell us what   ls -l /dev/cdrom    says.
2011-09-07T00:29:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	Have you done updates yet?
2011-09-07T00:30:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
2011-09-07T00:34:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	pastebinit /proc/scsi/scsi
2011-09-07T00:35:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	Well, I don't know.  You might reboot and see if it comes up.
2011-09-07T00:38:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	It might be broke.
2011-09-07T00:55:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	Could be that your video card is overheating.
2011-09-07T00:56:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	Maybe your PC needs a good cleaning?
2011-09-07T00:57:00.000Z	TeleportLisa	usr13	is there some way to check if it's overheating? and by cleaning do you mean like physically with alcohol or something, or cleaning up files and things
2011-09-07T00:58:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	I mean physical cleaning.  Is this a Desktop or Laptop computer?
2011-09-07T00:58:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	Yea, the motherboard could be overheating.
2011-09-07T00:59:00.000Z	usr13	TeleportLisa	But that is just one of several possibilities, but is the most-likely one.
2011-09-07T01:00:00.000Z	TeleportLisa	usr13	what is a way to solve that? not running two OS?
