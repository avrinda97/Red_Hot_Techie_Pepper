2007-08-16T09:54:00.000Z	slavik`lap		mbr lies outside of any partition you can create
2007-08-16T09:56:00.000Z	slavik`lap		grub installs itself to the mbr ...
2007-08-16T09:57:00.000Z	slavik`lap		mbr grub has enough info to mount the /boot partition and read the rest of the stuff (and load it's other piece)
2007-08-16T09:57:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	and genefitz: I'm back
2007-08-16T09:57:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	I don't know you
2007-08-16T09:57:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	I was the one talking about .Net with you... (knoppix)
2007-08-16T09:58:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	the .net code, is it for windows systems?
2007-08-16T09:58:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	what do you mean?
2007-08-16T09:58:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	do you write C# for primary use on windows systems or for everything?
2007-08-16T09:59:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	Of course it depends, that's like asking if I write C++ cross platform or platform dependent, it depends on the project of course
2007-08-16T10:00:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	here's a question regarding gathering info on a windows computer ... any faster way to do it than running msinfo32?
2007-08-16T10:02:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	haha what's that got to do with anything? If it's just off topic, I don't know honestly man
2007-08-16T10:03:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	because we had this piece of software developed in house and I even had to write a perl script to deliver same output from macs ... was out of curiousity (since I don't write C# code)
2007-08-16T10:04:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	well if you're wondering from an end-user point of view, I honestly don't know, I've never looked into it, from a programmer's stand-point, there are specific API calls you can do, but I'm not an expert in that, I'm sure you can look into WMI or something
2007-08-16T10:04:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	I had to use wmi through vbscript, not pleasant
2007-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	haha, that's because you chose vbscript
2007-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	I didn't choose it, phb did... I had to learn it
2007-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	BlankDenim	slavik`lap	oh well
2007-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	slavik`lap	BlankDenim	it was for logonscripts in AD
