2005-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	no such process... wierd.
2005-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	rj_	ernstp	exactly -- thats crazy..
2005-05-19T10:05:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	telnet .... 22 ?
2005-05-19T10:06:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	right, something is really broken! connect() doesn't work on you rsystem? but xchat is?
2005-05-19T10:07:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	ah.
2005-05-19T10:07:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	does elinks work?

2005-05-19T10:07:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	go ahead :-P
2005-05-19T10:08:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	only, rebooting never fixes anything on linux. but you can't stop trying
2005-05-19T10:08:00.000Z	rj_	ernstp	no, i've had it fix things.. like kernel panics
2005-05-19T10:10:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	would be cool if you could kexec reboot, so the system thought it rebooted but the power never went off...
2005-05-19T10:16:00.000Z	rj_	ernstp	doing a reboot worked
2005-05-19T10:16:00.000Z	rj_	ernstp	:/
2005-05-19T10:18:00.000Z	ernstp	rj_	eh... well... nice!
