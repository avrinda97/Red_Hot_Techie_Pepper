2007-06-16T11:47:00.000Z	eljak		anybody tried virtualbox?
2007-06-16T11:48:00.000Z	ny00123	eljak	yes, me
2007-06-16T11:48:00.000Z	ny00123	eljak	they've just released a version for 64-bit Linux hosts so I can install it (again; after having 32-bit Ubuntu Feisty before).
2007-06-16T11:48:00.000Z	eljak	ny00123	do you recommend it like for example as an alternative to vmware and xen?
2007-06-16T11:48:00.000Z	ny00123		Well, I haven't tried xen. I think that VirtualBox is better suited for running 'another desktop' than xen
2007-06-16T11:49:00.000Z	ny00123		VMWare Player is another possibility, though you might care as it's much less open source (very little portions of it are)
2007-06-16T11:49:00.000Z	eljak	ny00123	ok thank you
2007-06-16T11:50:00.000Z	ny00123		I wanted to install a KDE-based system in a virtual machine, preferlly not Kubuntu nor 64-bit.
2007-06-16T11:50:00.000Z	ny00123		PC-BSD and DesktopBSD both failed, had problems with qemu when I wanted to use kvm (kqemu in the installation, at least)
2007-06-16T11:51:00.000Z	ny00123		finally switched to VirtualBox after finding out it works on 64-bit Linux hosts.
2007-06-16T11:53:00.000Z	eljak	ny00123	it seems not listed in repositories i thought it was
2007-06-16T11:54:00.000Z	ny00123	eljak	you can download a deb  from virtualbox.com (org?)
2007-06-16T11:54:00.000Z	ny00123		or add their own repository
2007-06-16T11:54:00.000Z	ny00123		http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2007-06-16T11:54:00.000Z	eljak	ny00123	ah i see thank you :)
2007-06-16T11:54:00.000Z	ny00123		Note that it includes a few non-free additions like USB support
2007-06-16T11:54:00.000Z	ny00123		but only in case you care ;)
2007-06-16T11:55:00.000Z	ny00123		(It's free for non-commercial usage)
2007-06-16T11:55:00.000Z	eljak	ny00123	i just want to try lfs on virtual machine
