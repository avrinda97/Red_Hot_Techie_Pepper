2008-01-29T10:57:00.000Z	mkquist		ok, i have sound, (thought i didnt) but cant open alsamixer...  any ideas?
2008-01-29T10:57:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	try amixer
2008-01-29T10:59:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	try amixer
2008-01-29T10:59:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	no such device
2008-01-29T11:00:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	and alsa is installed? wierd amixer comes with alsa in ubuntu afaik
2008-01-29T11:01:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	i even uninstalled and reinstalled it... trying to fix. no go
2008-01-29T11:01:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	never seen amixer before
2008-01-29T11:01:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	hmm thats odd. i have no clue
2008-01-29T11:09:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	you probly dont have the ncurses library
2008-01-29T11:10:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	where would they be located?
2008-01-29T11:11:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	or, i guess more importantly - what are they?
2008-01-29T11:11:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	any idea how to install them?
2008-01-29T11:12:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	if gnome-alsamixer works there shouldnt be a need to
2008-01-29T11:13:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	i was just gonna say, gnome-alsamixer is just a gui version of alsamixer, so i would think one works, the other underlying one works too
2008-01-29T11:14:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	the gnome-alsamixer is the gui and alsamixer runs in terminal using ncurses which is a sort of text based gui
2008-01-29T11:15:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	i think the configuration files for alsamixer are futzed up....
2008-01-29T11:15:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	probly, but sound does work right
2008-01-29T11:16:00.000Z	mkquist	soldats	yep, so not the biggest deal
2008-01-29T11:16:00.000Z	soldats	mkquist	ok well id suggest using the task bar app for volume management. i really have no clue what do do to get it back
