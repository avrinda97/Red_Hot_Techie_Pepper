2006-03-03T16:31:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	have a look at ifup and ifdown don't know if it will get you out of the place you are though
2006-03-04T17:41:00.000Z	dejx	ompaul	you're still online
2006-03-04T17:42:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	according to rumour that is false :-)
2006-03-04T17:42:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	yes

2006-03-04T06:25:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	apt-cache search and when you want to know more apt-cache show
2006-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	please use paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-03-05T06:17:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	okay you may have done that we don't encourage people to do that - sudo kjust works and enabling the root password has side effects
2006-03-05T06:19:00.000Z	ompaul	dejx	only the first user that is on the machine
