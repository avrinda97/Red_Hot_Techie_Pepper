2007-09-03T05:38:00.000Z	Azerial		I dual booted with XP Pro, and Ubuntu 7.04, I made a partition of my harddrive and installed XP on it, then I ran the LIve CD of 7.04 Ubuntu, and installed it, at the partitioner, I made a 256mb Swap File, and the rest was made as a partition of Linux and I installed it on that partition, and I dual booted just fine
2007-09-03T05:40:00.000Z	Azerial		Can someone help me get Linux to recongize the existance of my CD Drive?
