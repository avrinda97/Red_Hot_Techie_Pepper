2009-04-26T17:18:00.000Z	traskbt		Does anyone know if I can upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04 BUT hold back the kernel?
2009-04-26T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	traskbt	I wouldn't advise going down that route
2009-04-26T17:21:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	either I use 8.10 or upgrade to 9.04 and hold back kernel :\

2009-04-26T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	traskbt	sorry - not you
2009-04-28T14:27:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	thanks
2009-04-28T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	traskbt	give that a go, then we can work through the problems
2009-04-28T14:29:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	looks like it was encrypted, thanks.
2009-05-01T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	traskbt	it's reporting a broken package - thats the problem
2009-05-01T14:09:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	okay, so it's not just me?
2009-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	I'm getting similar broken packages for a lot of things. Sun Java, gstreamer plugins, etc.
2009-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	traskbt	there you go see fde's comment
2009-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	okay, but apparently I can't use a synced mirror..
2009-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	traskbt	when you do sudo apt-get update - do you see the "new" mirror addresses or your old mirror address
2009-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	new.
2009-05-01T14:12:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	fde, trying osuosl mirrors now.
2009-05-01T14:13:00.000Z	traskbt	ikonia	fde, osuosl doesn't cut it either.
