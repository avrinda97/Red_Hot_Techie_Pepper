2006-08-25T16:01:00.000Z	anthony_		I'm following this walk-through: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=13576, and as soon as I get to step five it says "sudo mv ipw2200-fw-2.2.tgz /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/ is not a directory: No such file or directory".  what shall I do?
2006-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	anthony_		I just installed emacs21 with the synaptics package manager, and I don't know where it's gone! can anyone help?
2006-08-25T08:26:00.000Z	AWOSDev	anthony_	run "whereis emacs"
2006-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	thanks!  now how do I run it, and why didn't it go into the "applications" menu like everything else has done?
2006-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	AWOSDev	anthony_	it probably says "/usr/bin/emacs", right?
2006-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	yeah it does
2006-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	sorry I've only just installed this.  having a few teething issues!
2006-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	AWOSDev	anthony_	then just type "emacs" it should work, or "/usr/bin/emacs" if it doesn't
2006-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	many thanks
2006-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	AWOSDev	anthony_	no problem
2006-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	AWOSDev	anthony_	also you should be able to right-click on "Applications" then find your way to the Menu Editor and add eMacs
2006-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	ah sweet.  so usr/bin/ is similar to Program Files in Windows?
2006-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	AWOSDev	anthony_	Yep
2006-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	Nice one.  One more thing before I go to bed.  I need an html editorm similar to jEdit
2006-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	* with similar highliting to jedit
2006-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	anthony_	AWOSDev	I'm colour-blind, you see!
