2006-03-14T09:23:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	have you installed the packages? (tomcat5, tomcat5-admin, tomcat5-webapps)
2006-03-14T09:23:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	i did not find any of these packages. mom, i will look again for them
2006-03-14T09:23:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	oops, sorry, those exist for dapper only at the moment.
2006-03-14T09:25:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	i do not know which packet i have to download on tomcat.apache.org
2006-03-14T09:26:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	it would be a lot easier if you could use Ubuntu packages. You don't want to test the prerelease version of Ubuntu, by any chance?
2006-03-14T09:26:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	how should i come to deb-packets?
2006-03-14T09:28:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	they are in the dapper repositories. I reckon you could download the dapper sources and make your own breezy packages.
2006-03-14T09:31:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	have you seen http://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingSoftware ?
2006-03-14T09:32:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	i did see this on the german wiki ;)
2006-03-14T09:32:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	but is this no problem when i install software from dapper in my breezy? i mean because of the dependencies
2006-03-14T09:34:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	your English is ganz prima. Installing dapper packages in breezy will cause you more problems than installing dapper outright...
2006-03-14T09:36:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	also check out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompilingSoftware -- what's missing in there, though, is apt-get source
2006-03-14T09:36:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	do you know about apt-get source ?
2006-03-14T09:37:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	no i don't. i do not download the source from the repos. and i have commented it out in the sources.list
2006-03-14T09:37:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	i am not that good in compiling linux -.-
2006-03-14T09:39:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	if you can live with an unstable & still buggy system, your best bet is to upgrade to dapper. I'll have a quick look at upstream, though. Hold on...
2006-03-14T09:40:00.000Z	ice-t	soundray	oh, no i do not have a flatrate. this would explode my data-transfer-limit
2006-03-14T09:45:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	my dapper upgrade download was less than 1GB on a fairly complete system...
2006-03-14T09:46:00.000Z	soundray	ice-t	from looking at the Apache Tomcat pages, it appears to be a fairly complex project to install.
