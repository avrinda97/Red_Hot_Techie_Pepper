2010-08-17T12:23:00.000Z	etherealite		pretty sure that if all your doing is playing movies with Linux, then region doesn't matter at all.
2010-08-17T12:24:00.000Z	etherealite		unless your using commercial DVD playinga and burning software, I don't see what the problem is
2010-08-17T12:24:00.000Z	etherealite		don't use cyberlink, its awful.
2010-08-17T12:24:00.000Z	etherealite		why would yo uwant to?
2010-08-17T12:26:00.000Z	etherealite		software you never should have paid for
2010-08-17T12:26:00.000Z	etherealite		or use
2010-08-17T12:28:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	region code nowadays is implemented in the DVD hardware, so it applies to Linux too, sorry, complain to Hollywood ;)
2010-08-17T12:28:00.000Z	etherealite	yacc	you mus be kidding me
2010-08-17T12:28:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	nope, the fact that it's done in hardware has been mandated nowadays for quite some time, ...
2010-08-17T12:29:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	so some people end up with having multiple DVD drives.
2010-08-17T12:29:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	well, I personally dislike hardware media anyway, prefer to rip it to my dreambox, anyway.
2010-08-17T12:29:00.000Z	etherealite	yacc	so you can't rip the image at all without proper region?
2010-08-17T12:30:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	yeah, it all depends slightly on the hardware, not every vendor implements it as hardcore, but yes.
2010-08-17T12:31:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	not really, the sad part is that with a 100mbit cable connection, dvds start to be so yesterday, ...
2010-08-17T12:31:00.000Z	etherealite	yacc	who has 100mbit in the usa
2010-08-17T12:31:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	well, what shall I say, in Europe you can usually only get it in cities, ...
2010-08-17T12:32:00.000Z	etherealite	yacc	can you steal it like in the USA?
2010-08-17T12:32:00.000Z	yacc	etherealite	e.g. my dad in the suburbs can get only 50mbit or so.
