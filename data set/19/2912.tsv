2009-11-26T22:25:00.000Z	dimi		folks, I'm using a Dell Mini10 running ubuntu, and something changed recently, as I'm trying to install libusplash-dev but it's complaining about
2009-11-26T22:25:00.000Z	dimi		The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2009-11-26T22:25:00.000Z	dimi		  libusplash-dev: Depends: libusplash0 (= 0.5.19netbook3) but 0.5.19netbook4 is to be installed
2009-11-26T22:25:00.000Z	dimi		eam: Broken packages
2009-11-26T22:26:00.000Z	dimi		is anyone aware of this problem, and how can it be fixed?
2009-11-26T22:27:00.000Z	coz_	dimi	  what are you trying to install?
2009-11-26T22:28:00.000Z	dimi	coz_	libusplash-dev
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	coz_	dimi	 mmm let me check here
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	dimi		it worked afew days ago...
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	dimi		I think the dep is broken:
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	dimi		libusplash-dev: Depends: libusplash0 (= 0.5.19netbook3) but 0.5.19netbook4 is to be installed
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	dimi		shouldn't that be >= 0.5.19netbook3 maybe?
2009-11-26T22:30:00.000Z	coz_	dimi	 ok it installed here.... are you in synaptic?
2009-11-26T22:30:00.000Z	coz_	dimi	 go to  Edit menu  ..  fix broken pacakges
2009-11-26T22:33:00.000Z	dimi	coz_	I tried that, it didn't work
2009-11-26T22:33:00.000Z	dimi		how is "Fix broken..." supposed to work?
2009-11-26T22:35:00.000Z	coz_	dimi	  mmm  that should have taken care of it
2009-11-26T22:38:00.000Z	dimi	coz_	I think I figured out how to downgrade libusplash0 to prev version, that should fix it.
2009-11-26T22:39:00.000Z	coz_	dimi	  ok although that doesnt sound like the best solution  since libusplash.dev installed here on karmic
