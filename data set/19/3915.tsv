2009-05-17T05:28:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK		is anyone familiar with: Dependency is not satisfiable: libgnome2.0-cil (>= 2.16.0) ?
2009-05-17T05:28:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK		or atleast know a solution
2009-05-17T05:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	you need a version of libgnome2.0-cil newer than or equal to 2.16.0
2009-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK	lstarnes	and how am I able to get the package name?
2009-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	aptitude show libgnome2.0-cil
2009-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK	lstarnes	Not a real package
2009-05-17T05:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	try looking in the PPAs for it
2009-05-17T05:35:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK	lstarnes	S partitions

2009-05-17T05:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	sounds like whatever you're installing has outdated dependencies
2009-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK	lstarnes	anyway to downgrade?
2009-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	it would be better to find a better version of the package
2009-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK	lstarnes	guess there isnt any, + there isnt a source available
2009-05-17T05:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	report the bug to the package maker?
2009-05-17T05:43:00.000Z	AmnesiaUK	lstarnes	I could.... though I guess they wont be bothered:p
2009-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	it's basically the display server
2009-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	it can draw simple windows, but window managers like compiz and metavity actually manage the windows and decorate them
2009-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	windows doesn't use X or anything like it.  almost everything is in explorer or the windows kernel
2009-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	AmnesiaUK	vista does have dwm as well
