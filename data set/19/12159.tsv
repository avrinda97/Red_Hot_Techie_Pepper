2007-04-16T14:40:00.000Z	albert_		hi, does anybody know, how i can set a system-wide /CHARSET ISO-8859-15
2007-04-16T14:40:00.000Z	albert_		?
2007-04-16T14:41:00.000Z	eck	albert_	i think it depend on your filesystem... afaik the charset of ext3 is always utf8
2007-04-16T14:41:00.000Z	eck	albert_	if you look at the mount man page you can see the options for mounting various filesystems with different character sets
2007-04-16T14:42:00.000Z	albert_	eck	k
2007-04-16T14:43:00.000Z	albert_	eck	sorry for bugging you, but i'm very new to linux and don't really get the point ;)
2007-04-16T14:44:00.000Z	eck	albert_	you are trying to mount your filesystem with another character set, right?
2007-04-16T14:44:00.000Z	albert_	eck	ye
2007-04-16T14:44:00.000Z	eck	albert_	or just change the encodings of the files on it?
2007-04-16T14:44:00.000Z	albert_	eck	i just want to get my charset straight ;)
2007-04-16T14:45:00.000Z	eck	albert_	your linux filesystem will be utf8 encoded. you can mount an ntfs/fat partition with another character encoding, which is set as a mount parameter. however, none of this has anything to do with the character encoding of the files themselves on the filesystem, only the encoding used for the file names
2007-04-16T14:46:00.000Z	albert_	eck	i figured it was sth about the keybord-layout
2007-04-16T14:46:00.000Z	albert_	eck	i think i get the point
2007-04-16T14:47:00.000Z	eck	albert_	changing the encoding of the filesystem is generally only useful if a windows partition has a weird nonstandard character encoding and the file names are mangled
2007-04-16T14:47:00.000Z	albert_	eck	ye, i get this, but that's not the point, really
2007-04-16T14:49:00.000Z	albert_	eck	k, but that's not my concern, cause i don't use windows, it's just that my xchat output of   is weird
2007-04-16T14:49:00.000Z	eck	albert_	that kind of stuff is generally application specific... maybe the people in #xchat can help
2007-04-16T14:50:00.000Z	albert_	eck	k, thank you for your help. i didn't make myself fully clear, so sorry about it
2007-04-30T15:39:00.000Z	eck	albert_	sudo umount /where/you/mounted/it
