2006-02-26T14:56:00.000Z	curley_sue		HELP - does anybody know how to start SKYPE as AWAY (automatically)?
2006-02-26T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	timing out is not good enough?
2006-02-26T15:00:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	I'm not sure I understand...
2006-02-26T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	you can go to Tools-Options and set the time until it shows you as "Away".
2006-02-26T15:04:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	thanx, but somehow it does not work...
2006-02-26T15:04:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	it waits until you are inactive (ie. not using the mouse and keyboard)
2006-02-26T15:06:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	well, I wanted something that did not need me off the computer... thanx anyway
2006-02-26T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	it's something you can ask Skype support.
2006-02-26T15:09:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	u r write only it does not appear in their manual/FAQ/google... (as far as I tried)
2006-05-05T08:39:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	first, unplug the drive if it is pluggable.
2006-05-05T08:41:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	you may be able to undelete files from DOS/Windows.
2006-05-05T08:42:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	how is that done (I am using a dual-boot with XP) haven't rebooted since the deletion (of about 15G)
2006-05-05T08:43:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	was XP on the partition you deleted?
2006-05-05T08:44:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	no, XP is on a third partition (NTFS), the one deleted using rm is a FAT32 (used for archives) and I have a linux partition which is ext3 I belive (Dapper)
2006-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	deleting in fat filesystems works by removing the first two bytes from the filename in the fat (file allocation table) entry. So there is a chance to recover. I don't know about any linux utilities that do this though.
2006-05-05T08:47:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	is there a way ,after deleting using linux, to recover using XP?
2006-05-05T08:48:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	earlier versions of Windows had an undelete utility. I don't know about XP. You can probably mount your XP partition and search for a file with undel in the name.
2006-05-05T08:51:00.000Z	curley_sue	soundray	sbassett516, is it for linux or XP, is it free, how is it used, is it safe to reboot without risking loosing the deleted file? (sorry for the loads of Qs)
2006-05-05T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	curley_sue	you can probably find the kind of tool you need on the ultimate boot cd (http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/)
