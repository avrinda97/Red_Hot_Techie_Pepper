2009-11-30T06:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	yes uhmm
2009-11-30T06:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	there seems to be an issue
2009-11-30T06:12:00.000Z	mitrovarr	sebsebseb	 So this has been seen before?  Any idea if there's anything I can do about it?
2009-11-30T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	ok just checked with the guy  who  told me about the issue,  last night or whenever it was now, he put this in reply to me:  synaptics regression yeah.. but check the bug tracker it may have been fixed
2009-11-30T06:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	he only knows that it was a problem when 9.10 was initially released
2009-11-30T06:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	by the way the release notes mention common issues, for Ubuntu versions, and sometimes or a lot of the time provide solutions
2009-11-30T06:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	I guess your issue is mentioned, but I don't want to load up the notes right now
2009-11-30T06:16:00.000Z	mitrovarr	sebsebseb	 Thanks, I'll see if I can find anything there.
2009-11-30T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	you can also put 9.04 on, or even another distro, if the issue bothers you a lot in 9.10 and you can't get it fixed
2009-11-30T06:18:00.000Z	mitrovarr	sebsebseb	 I'm not sure, but I think 9.04 might have had it too.  I ran it live a couple of times, and I thought it was laggy at the time... the issue can easily be misinterpreted as lag (since you click and nothing happens, but you might click later and have it work.)
2009-11-30T06:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	oh I think someone  experienced such an issue on a lap top he returned to the shop soon after,  that he tried 9.04 on hmm
2009-11-30T06:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	or 8.10 or whatever hmm
2009-11-30T06:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	well if your issue is there in previous versions such as 9.04, 8.10, or 8.04, hmm,  maybe it's a general Linux distro issue, or it's not and you don't get the issue in another Linux distro
2009-11-30T06:21:00.000Z	mitrovarr	sebsebseb	 It's not in 8.10.  That's what I installed over, and it didn't have it.
2009-11-30T06:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	8.10 is a good release, but unfortunatly the support for it is running out, but when it does 10.04 will have been released, which is also the next Long Term Support release
2009-11-30T06:22:00.000Z	mitrovarr	sebsebseb	 I guess I hadn't really anticipated this sort of bug from updating.
2009-11-30T06:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	already said this earlier to someone or something rather similar, but i'll do it again,   the ethernet in 8.10 woudn't work on the other computer, but other then that 8.10 has been a good release, but then I wanted Ext4 so bye bye 8.10
2009-11-30T06:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	sometimes hardware that worked fine, doesn't work in a later release, take that other computer for example, ethernet no problem in 8.04,  woudn't work in 8.10
2009-11-30T06:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mitrovarr	then hopefuly an even later release fixes the issue,  which happended in this case, since it works fine in 9.04,  not sure about 9.10 though since not tried from Live CD  yet even on there
