2005-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	Nameless1	jasoncohen	im tryin to use noatun but its not giving me sound
2005-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	if you have xine instaleld with w32codecs it can play all your quicktime, divx,/xvid, mpeg etc. movies
2005-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	Nameless1	jasoncohen	does xine come with a gui tho?
2005-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	yes
2005-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	as does totem and kaffeine
2005-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	Nameless1	jasoncohen	considering i have codecs that DO WORK installed for nautun will i have to setup codecs with this other thing?
2005-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	and xine is extremely fast to startup & use- it supports DVD menus & subtitles with a nice menu interface
2005-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	it's easy
2005-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	and you can also use totem-xine which will use xine's codecs
2005-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	if you have backport & backport-extras just apt-get install xine-ui totem-xine w32codecs
2005-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	kaffeine is also quite nice
2005-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	Nameless1	jasoncohen	 i dont have them
2005-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Nameless1	and you'll want mozilla-mplayer or kaffeine-mplayer for firefox
