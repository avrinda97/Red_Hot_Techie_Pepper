2011-04-26T21:23:00.000Z	scorch_	Promille	ubuntu networking or something
2011-04-26T21:23:00.000Z	scorch_	Promille	 I quicky hit deny
2011-04-26T21:24:00.000Z	Promille	scorch_	probably something, but im not certain. if your afraid someone has root access or worse, you can allways install snort. It could be so much. Update all programs with update-manager, and stay out of bogus sites.
2011-04-26T21:26:00.000Z	Promille	scorch_	I would recommend you install snort, and with that program you can have alot more control over what happens when your connected to the internet, i.e. who tries to connect. it also keeps log, and its really neat. http://www.snort.org/
2011-04-26T21:27:00.000Z	Promille	scorch_	But its a little hard to say what it was now. Probably harmless, but its a good idea to be in control.
2011-04-26T21:29:00.000Z	scorch_	Promille	ok i am installing, and it is asking the ip range of my local network.   I am connected dirrectly to the isp, no router, so what do i put there?

2011-04-26T21:31:00.000Z	Promille	scorch_	hm. probably 127.0.0.1 or the standard gateway(check with ifconfig) but theres alot of good guides on the internet, check with google or theire site
2011-04-26T21:32:00.000Z	Promille	scorch_	i.e. http://www.snort.org/assets/113/Snort_2.8.4.1_Ubuntu.pdf
