2011-09-16T16:52:00.000Z	parapan		hi fellows > I have this problem > I cannot see the router index page when browsing from ubuntu server ( terminal mode ) with either w3m or lynx ....they display some d234.gif information but I cannot see that pictures ...even so ..I think this is graphical from the frames but not the real content of the page ....what can I do ???
2011-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	bare in mind that neither of those browsers support javascript, which most of router UIs use.
2011-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	grrrrr > thanks for the tip .....any workaround ?
2011-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	hm, well lynx has a basic support for frames... but workaround... hm, not that I know of.
2011-09-16T16:54:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	if your router supports ssh maybe handle things that way?
2011-09-16T16:55:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	if it would :D but is not the case .....it's a D-link product ....with proprietary firmware
2011-09-16T16:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	Can you be specific on what you want to do with your router?
2011-09-16T16:56:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	is there any version of X .....something light which I can use as "virtual" system .....?
2011-09-16T16:56:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	I miss some info like the IP of one specific computer on the network .....and I want to "see" the configuration page :D
2011-09-16T16:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	Well, in theory (since I never done it), you can install VBox or KVM and then connect through ssh tunnel to a remote desktop.
2011-09-16T16:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	But it's a pain.
2011-09-16T16:58:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	I don;t know if it works ...VBox needs X to be installed .....if I'd had this on the server I would not need the virtualisation .....
2011-09-16T17:02:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	I just found out that Elinks and Links2 support javascript. Check them out.
2011-09-16T17:02:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	cool man > thanks for that info ...let me check
2011-09-16T17:02:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	Not sure how they managed to do that :) though.
2011-09-16T17:03:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	I'll let you know in a minute
2011-09-16T17:09:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	Nope ...none of them does-it ....................grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2011-09-16T17:09:00.000Z	MeanEYE	parapan	Then the problem might not be in JavaScript support.
2011-09-16T17:09:00.000Z	parapan	MeanEYE	could be . . .
