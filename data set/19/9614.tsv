2006-10-15T06:42:00.000Z	Bladegash		Here's my problem: lately I've had a hard time logging onto SSH by remote. Sometimes the connect dies after giving pw, sometimes after displaying "last login" but before the prompt. Is this just SSH being unstable?
2006-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	Bladegash		Should I set up something like automatic restart of ssh in crontab, or will that not help, you think?
2006-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	someone might be knocking at your door massively
2006-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	Bladegash	rpc	would that do it? I am running a few torrents from time to time, are those enough to kill ssh?
2006-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	nope
2006-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	what i can advice you is to change the default ssh port to something different and see then
2006-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	my bet is that the problem disappeares at once :)
2006-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	Bladegash	rpc	nope, I already am running on a nonstandard port
2006-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	oh i see
2006-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	so perhaps it's time to change the port?
2006-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	linux boxes never degenerate :)
2006-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	that's what i think, i change the port everyday...
2006-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	yes they will
2006-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	that's why you should use port knocking if you really care about security
2006-10-15T06:50:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	check pm please
2006-10-15T06:50:00.000Z	Bladegash	rpc	I did
2006-10-15T06:55:00.000Z	rpc	Bladegash	i had that before when i was short on space in /var
2006-10-15T06:56:00.000Z	Bladegash	rpc	I have ubuntu installed on its own hard drive, and there's still over 100gig free on that
2006-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	Bladegash	rpc	so what is this about PAM you mentioned?
