2008-02-27T22:03:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		how do i update a software in ubuntu?
2008-02-27T22:03:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	'sudo apt-get install packagename'
2008-02-27T22:10:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	yes. I've found it to be finicky whenever I tried something not standard
2008-02-27T22:12:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	the version i had refused to restore a ntfs partition
2008-02-27T22:12:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	it said "cannot read block 0"
2008-02-27T22:17:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	'dpkg -S /some/file/from/the/package'
2008-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	just curious: what imaging tool have you tried?
2008-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	partimage only (version 0.6.4)
2008-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	okay... you may have to look into dd
2008-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	nope
2008-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	is it better?
2008-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	it's very low-level, but there are tutorials and ubuntuforums discussions about using it for your purpose
2008-02-28T20:30:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	sounds very instresting
2008-02-28T20:30:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=159182 and stfw ;)
2008-02-28T20:39:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	am i supposed to find "dd" in the synaptic package manager?
2008-02-28T20:40:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	it's a standard system tool -- you have it already
2008-02-28T20:40:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	comes with the coreutils package
2008-02-28T20:40:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	soundray	oh, how come other software like ghost and partimage even exist for linux if dd is built in to do the job?
2008-02-28T20:41:00.000Z	soundray	Bo^Dick	because dd is very low-level. Many tools like that have optional and exchangeable front-ends
