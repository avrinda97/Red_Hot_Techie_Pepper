2005-02-04T11:01:00.000Z	Mamorook		I just installed Ubuntu and am having difficulty getting my ubuntu box to communicate with my winxp box
2005-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	Mamorook		It's not a samba problem.
2005-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	Mamorook		I haven't gotten that far.
2005-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	Mamorook		My windows box and my linux box can't ping each other.
2005-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	Mamorook		I'm at my windows box.  But my linux box is right beside me.
2005-02-04T11:03:00.000Z	Mamorook		Says it is.
2005-02-04T11:03:00.000Z	Mamorook		Er...  I mean it shows up under ifconfig.
2005-02-04T11:03:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	ifconfig -a; netstat -rn
2005-02-04T11:06:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	/etc/init.d/networking restart
2005-02-04T11:07:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	can you get your networking app open?
2005-02-04T11:08:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	yup
2005-02-04T11:08:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	check your network settings in there. Possible you missed setting a gateway.
2005-02-04T11:11:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	do you have DHCP on your network?
2005-02-04T11:11:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	HUB or crossover?
2005-02-04T11:12:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	set the gateway to the winxp IP address
2005-02-04T11:13:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart; netstat -rn
2005-02-04T11:14:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	good. Try pinging to the winxp box
2005-02-04T11:18:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	you also need to check the networking on your windows box
2005-02-04T11:55:00.000Z	snowblink	Mamorook	Just a thought. Can you ping the interfaces on their own machines?
