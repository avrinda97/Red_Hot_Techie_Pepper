2005-09-27T13:09:00.000Z	derek[] 	qt2	how much do you have to install more to upgrade? (in case you had done it) ..coz if its going to be a lot.. I'd rather get breezy directly
2005-09-27T13:09:00.000Z	qt2		derek[] : breezy isnt stable yet, it breaks easily.
2005-09-27T13:10:00.000Z	derek[] 	qt2	okay
2005-09-27T13:11:00.000Z	qt2		derek[] : it'll probably be another month or two before breezy hits stable.
