2007-07-10T13:58:00.000Z	xoRock		so its easier to unrar things

2007-07-10T14:00:00.000Z	xoRock	kwtm	thx i'll look into it
2007-07-10T14:00:00.000Z	kwtm	xoRock	It's just that it will also install a bunch of KDE libraries, so if that's the only KDE program you're using, it will take up a bunch of space.  But if you have other KDE programs running, then those other programs will use the KDE libraries anyway, so you might as well install them.
2007-07-10T14:02:00.000Z	kwtm	xoRock	Funny you say that --today I found out that there *is* Nero for burning CD Roms.
2007-07-10T14:03:00.000Z	xoRock	kwtm	lol* i mean open source dud
2007-07-10T14:03:00.000Z	kwtm	xoRock	Let me find the web site for you.  However, you might as well use K3b, which is the KDE CD burner.  I hear it's better than Gnome-toaster, but I haven't tried Gnome-toaster.
2007-07-10T14:03:00.000Z	kwtm	xoRock	K3b is one of the programs known for its user friendliness.  (AmaroK is another.)
2007-07-10T14:03:00.000Z	xoRock	kwtm	dud thx i appreciate tat
2007-07-10T14:04:00.000Z	kwtm	xoRock	But if for some reason you'd rather pay $25 for a program, you can check out http://www.linux.com/feature/115215 which is a review of Nero.
2007-07-10T14:04:00.000Z	kwtm	xoRock	Apparently you can download a working version that asks you for money after 30 days.
2007-07-10T14:05:00.000Z	xoRock	kwtm	na, i stick with open source, kinda love it this way, im d/l ing k3b right now
