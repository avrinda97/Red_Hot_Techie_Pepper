2005-01-26T13:58:00.000Z	noda		fglrx-driver won't work with X.org, right?
2005-01-26T13:59:00.000Z	mz2	noda	it will, with a bit of fiddling
2005-01-26T14:00:00.000Z	mz2		but the current dri driver is getting actually quite good, if you're not running one of those best, newest models :)
2005-01-26T14:01:00.000Z	noda	mz2	I'm on a mobile thing... I'd like to be able to put drop-shadows, but they're too slow with the DRI driver (unless it's improving quickly)
2005-01-26T14:01:00.000Z	noda	mz2	Is there a URL somewhere which describes that "fiddling"? I'm not going to bother if I'm treading uncharted territory :)
2005-01-26T14:02:00.000Z	mz2	noda	ah... well, don't bother with the fglrx driver anyways because the composite extension's damn slow with it
2005-01-26T14:02:00.000Z	mz2		and unstable
2005-01-26T14:02:00.000Z	noda	mz2	Faster with DRI?
2005-01-26T14:02:00.000Z	mz2	noda	wouldn't really know, i actually haven't tried with dri at all
2005-01-26T14:03:00.000Z	noda		Hrm. So basically, drop-shadows aren't gonna happen? :)
2005-01-26T14:03:00.000Z	mz2		i'd presume it is faster on the fglrx anyways, but still, it's not going to be pleasant, i at least managed to crash X on my laptop's radeon 9000 several times with the composite extension on
2005-01-26T14:04:00.000Z	mz2		but yes, the fiddling instructions should be somewhere on the net, it was some sort of patch you had to run
2005-01-26T14:05:00.000Z	noda	mz2	That's too hardcore for the amount I actually care about getting it working :)
2005-01-26T14:05:00.000Z	noda		Actually, these drop-shadows *do* seem to be rather quick.
2005-01-26T14:05:00.000Z	noda		They were slower before, I swear :)
2005-01-26T14:06:00.000Z	noda		Now, if only Debian had xorg, so I could have windows fading in/out on my desktop.
2005-01-26T14:06:00.000Z	noda		(fade in/out is too slow on the laptop)
2005-01-26T14:06:00.000Z	mz2	noda	well exactly... just wait for a few months to let first of all ATi release drivers for X.org, then a few months that the composite extension starts to work stably and then a few until window managers can take some use of it sensibly :)
2005-01-26T14:06:00.000Z	noda	mz2	lol
