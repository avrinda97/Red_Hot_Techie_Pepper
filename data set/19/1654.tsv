2011-06-07T23:41:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf		Has anyone got Access to run under PlayOnLinux?
2011-06-07T23:42:00.000Z	celthunder	CyborgSmurf	how about an error when you try installing it might be more useful
2011-06-07T23:43:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	celthunder	the thing is that it installs fine, no errors whatsoever, but it just didnt include Access
2011-06-07T23:48:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	celthunder	are you still there?
2011-06-07T23:49:00.000Z	celthunder	CyborgSmurf	yes
2011-06-07T23:50:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	celthunder	My answer before was...the thing is that it installs fine, no errors whatsoever, but it just didnt include Access

2011-06-14T12:25:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	celthunder	it was probably created earlier, but a friend gave me this, I had a small HDD (37,5Mb) so I could either have windows 3.1 (12Mb) or that one(15Mb)
2011-06-14T12:25:00.000Z	celthunder	CyborgSmurf	idk plan9 os2 vax bsd lfs are pretty much your choices
2011-06-14T12:26:00.000Z	celthunder	CyborgSmurf	theres probably others but those are the ones i know of from 95

2011-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	CyborgSmurf	celthunder	btw I guess one of the best screensavers are "johnny cast away" ;)
