2007-05-25T11:50:00.000Z	jazzrocker		hi, does the Ubuntu installer automagically resize a hard drive for you?
2007-05-25T11:50:00.000Z	jazzrocker		i know that it will do essentially what partition magic does
2007-05-25T11:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	Yes, it should.
2007-05-25T11:54:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	If I remember correctly, it will automatically resize, based on your preference....I am not 100% on that
2007-05-25T11:55:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	k, the question is will it both automatically resize *and* create the swap partition too
2007-05-25T11:56:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	I am 99% sure it will do both...I don't want to say yes for absolute positive....I am sure someone KNOWS...I just am pretty sure
2007-05-25T11:59:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	I am almost certain, I just don't want to send you the creek, shold on some off chance, I am mistaken.
2007-05-25T12:00:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	Not only will it partition, but a toaster will attach itself to your computer.
2007-05-25T12:02:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	FreeBSD runs on a toaster... no joke
2007-05-25T12:02:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	whoops, NetBSD sorry
2007-05-25T12:03:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	Wow, good thing you changed that, I was going out to buy a toaster.
2007-05-25T12:03:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	seriously though, no joke: http://www.embeddedarm.com/news/netbsd_toaster.htm
2007-05-25T12:03:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	well, actually a pretty big joke... but not just totally for fun... more for the pride i think :)
2007-05-25T12:06:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	I think it was just the standard Fiesty install guide
2007-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	I am absolutely not trying to be argumentative, but he has the laptop...he is trying to make it work.
2007-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	Cronos i'm just informing you of the reality because Cronos you said "I am dissapointed with Ubuntu" when in reality you should not be disappointed with Ubuntu you should be disappointed with your laptop
2007-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	I follow...I was just saying it doesn't help him now. . .that's all.
2007-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	jazzrocker	PurpZeY	but it can help in the future
2007-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jazzrocker	This is true.
