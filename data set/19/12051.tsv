2006-12-01T17:32:00.000Z	php-freak		hey guys why don't my text look as clear as what it does on windows, like when i make it smaller under firefox?
2006-12-01T17:33:00.000Z	php-freak		maybe its cause I need to put a clearer font on
2006-12-01T17:33:00.000Z	php-freak		no
2006-12-01T17:33:00.000Z	php-freak		how can i get the msfonts
2006-12-01T17:34:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
2006-12-01T17:44:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	is that what you try to do?
2006-12-01T17:49:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	don't use it
2006-12-01T17:50:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	it's best to only install packages from the ubuntu repos
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	really, you should install it through synaptic. So use the pages ubotu sent you
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	yes it does
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	if you install phpmyadmin through synaptic it works great
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	installing manually is a lot of work and probably it wont work after all
2006-12-01T17:53:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	install the msttcorefonts pacakge
2006-12-01T17:53:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
2006-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	it's in the multiverse repo so
2006-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	chech what ubotu said
2006-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	again, look at what ubotu says
2006-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	yes. you have to enable the multiverse repo. And how to do that is in the reply from ubotu
2006-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	KenSentMe	php-freak	so read that first
