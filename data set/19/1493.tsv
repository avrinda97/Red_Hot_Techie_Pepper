2011-01-09T02:48:00.000Z	sam-_-	boatingbum23	hmm. is minecraft a native application or do you run it via wine or sth.?
2011-01-09T02:48:00.000Z	boatingbum23	sam-_-	its a native application that runs in the java-jre
2011-01-09T02:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	boatingbum23	could either be that minecraft needs a better graphics card or the drivers for your card aren't mature enough yet.
2011-01-09T02:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	boatingbum23	did you try it in windows?
