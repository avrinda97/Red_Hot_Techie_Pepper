2011-08-01T09:16:00.000Z	mcurran		Or have any hints on how I can fix my microphone?
2011-08-01T09:16:00.000Z	mcurran		what's your graphics card or chipset frozenpacket?
2011-08-01T09:17:00.000Z	frozenpacket	mcurran	its stalk had windows XP on it before that ran good but put Ubuntu on and the graphics are messed up
2011-08-01T09:19:00.000Z	frozenpacket		McPeter: AGP8X
2011-08-01T09:19:00.000Z	mcurran	frozenpacket	 I will need to know the graphics card make/model in order to provide any help.
2011-08-01T09:19:00.000Z	frozenpacket	mcurran	its AGP8X
2011-08-01T09:20:00.000Z	mcurran		that's irrelevant (ati, nvidia, intel?)  run the following command in terminal and paste the output here:  "lspci | grep video"
2011-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	frozenpacket		it has intel
2011-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	mcurran		actually type this "lspci | grep VGA
2011-08-01T09:23:00.000Z	mcurran	frozenpacket	 It seems there's a lot of other users having issues with your chipset and unity.  You should probably follow a ubuntu forum solution identified on the web.  Try searching for "ubuntu 865G solved" w/ google.
2011-08-01T09:27:00.000Z	frozenpacket	mcurran	what was that command again?
2011-08-01T09:28:00.000Z	mcurran	frozenpacket	 The command was "lspci | grep VGA".  I think your chipset is 865G
2011-08-01T09:28:00.000Z	mcurran		don't you know how to scroll back?
2011-08-01T09:28:00.000Z	mcurran		:)
