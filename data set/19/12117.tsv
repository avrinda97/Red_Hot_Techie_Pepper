2005-10-16T06:18:00.000Z	HedgeMage		why do people ask a question, then leave before there's time to answer it?
2005-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	HedgeMage		What is the slowest/oldest computer you folks think a default install of ubuntu would run comfortably on?
2005-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	if you use the 'server' install you can run it on a pentium 133
2005-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	no Gnome or anything tough
2005-10-16T06:19:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	I was thinking for a newbie's desktop
2005-10-16T06:20:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	it's gnome that worries me a bit, I'm used to super-light wm's like fvwm or occassionally flux
2005-10-16T06:20:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	right, flux will run on virtually anything.. drop gnome and you're fine
2005-10-16T06:21:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	a Linux newbie should learn how to do stuff with the command line anyway.. Gnome is more of a Windows replacement
2005-10-16T06:21:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	I don't think I'm going to sell that idea to my technophobic little-old-schoolteacher mom
2005-10-16T06:22:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	if she's technofobic then all she cares about is the button to start the browser.. I imagine a nice clean interface like openbox would actually help
2005-10-16T06:22:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	the thing is, I will be talking her through installing it herself... I'm hoping for as few steps as humanly possible.
2005-10-16T06:23:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	what machine does she have?
2005-10-16T06:23:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	also, does she have broadband?
2005-10-16T06:23:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	she will have broadband by the time she gets her CD (theoretically)
2005-10-16T06:24:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	she has an old 400mhz something with an unknown amount of RAM
2005-10-16T06:24:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	you can tell her to do the 'server' install, which should only prompt for a few things, then you ssh in and configure the thing
2005-10-16T06:24:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	for the install the trickiest part is the drive partitioning
2005-10-16T06:25:00.000Z	HedgeMage	tga	that sounds good.  I wish I were there to do it for her in person, but that's 2000 miles!
2005-10-16T06:25:00.000Z	tga	HedgeMage	my suggestion -- get her to use something simple like openbox or xfwm4 tops.. she'll have less trouble using it
