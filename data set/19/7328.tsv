2007-10-18T07:52:00.000Z	thev	Voodoo_John	- how would I export frames/video?
2007-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	Voodoo_John	thev	you never said anything technical but you can export by saving as a .gif
2007-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	thev	Voodoo_John	- I don't think that would work... I would probably have hundreds of frames
2007-10-18T07:54:00.000Z	thev	Voodoo_John	- I will look at Cinelerra again... the interface is so horrendous though
2007-10-18T07:55:00.000Z	Voodoo_John	thev	yes, LIVES is a bit.. better though
