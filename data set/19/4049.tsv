2009-04-19T04:57:00.000Z	patapouf_		I post the same question earlier today: I'm looking for an alternative to Unison File Synchronizer
2009-04-19T04:57:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	grsync maybe
2009-04-19T04:57:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	I will look into it
2009-04-19T04:58:00.000Z	eseven73		it's a GUI for rsync :)
2009-04-19T04:58:00.000Z	eseven73		also, gnome-schedule is a GUI for cron stuff
2009-04-19T04:59:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	how does it react if there modification on both side ?
2009-04-19T05:01:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	it syncs data between them and figures out which is older/newer, im not a guru on with rsync so about all I could help with, maybe man rsync for more info :)
2009-04-19T05:01:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	I will look into it
2009-04-19T05:03:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	 you trying to back stuff up? sbackup is really nice too, once intalled you'll see it in system> administration Simple Backup Config, it has a gui, can schedule backups, has exclusions, and differential stuff too.
2009-04-19T05:04:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	well, I'm trying to sync data for 3 differents computers. Each one may change over time...
2009-04-19T05:05:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	yeah rsync or unison then
2009-04-19T05:05:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	yep, I'm using unison at this time.. but the user interface get me confused
2009-04-19T05:05:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	there's an gui for unison too unison-gtk I believe it is
2009-04-19T05:06:00.000Z	eseven73		yeah I don't care for Unison's interface either
2009-04-19T05:06:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	yep, I'm using this GUI, but it's not userfriendly at all ..
2009-04-19T05:07:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	I try to make modification to it, but seriously, it's will take less time to rewrite it from scratch.
2009-04-19T05:08:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	haha true :)
2009-04-19T05:08:00.000Z	eseven73	patapouf_	what about bacula? I think I spelled that correctly
2009-04-19T05:08:00.000Z	patapouf_	eseven73	just the fact that it's use ocaml ! wow what a confusing language compare to c and java
