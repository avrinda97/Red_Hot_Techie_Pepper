2010-11-09T02:04:00.000Z	Roasted_		troll!
2010-11-09T02:04:00.000Z	Roasted_		I really hate skids who think they are all ub3r and 1337 if they use Debian. lol
2010-11-09T02:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	Roasted_	don't add to the trolling please
2010-11-23T21:05:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	basically. I have a folder on myd esktop, and in terminal I assigned each of them to a different user that isnt me - root, www-data, etc.
2010-11-23T21:05:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	the idea is, I want a GUI method of chmod -R.
2010-11-23T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	dolphin (as root) does this fine. nautilus (as root) fails, and has failed since 2005....
2010-11-23T21:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	Roasted_	file a bug
2010-11-23T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	I'm just wondering if I'm doing something wrong or if I need to enable some sort of a setting within gconf-editor to allow that to happen.
2010-11-23T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	because I've found some features of nautilus are hidden until you enable them to prevent users from self destructing their systems, and re-assigning ownership recursively via gui is one of htem I suppose.
2010-11-23T21:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	Roasted_	it may be hidden, I really am not sure but I have a button that says " Apply to all files in folder " at the bootom of the properties window.
2010-11-23T21:08:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	that will apply permissions recursively, but not ownership or group changes.
2010-11-23T21:08:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	that being said, if jason/jason owns EVERY SINGLE FOLDER within my target folder, I can re-assign perms accordingly. but I cannot change the owenrship or anything below that.
2010-11-23T21:09:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	this gets annoying when I use external hard drives from 1 linux system to another. Sometimes it comes up as owned by user 999 or whatever, you know... users that dont exist. So I need to take over ownership and resorting to terminal for something simple is kinda. really??
2010-11-23T21:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	Roasted_	doesn't seem there is a free version, there is a 30 day trial. I recommend you try clamav
2010-11-23T21:45:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	I have clamav. Does clamav do spyware too? Kaspersky just sounded to be a little more well-rounded.
2010-11-23T21:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	Roasted_	it may be more feature full but it is not free. as for clamav doing spyware also i don't know
2010-11-23T21:47:00.000Z	Roasted_	IdleOne	maybe Ill jsut stick to the rescue disk they have. IT seems to have gotten great reviews, even on a list of 15 competitor applications it scored very high.
2010-11-23T21:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	Roasted_	we are going into offtopic realm now.
