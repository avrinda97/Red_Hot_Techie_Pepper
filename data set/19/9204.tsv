2007-01-10T16:52:00.000Z	freakabcd		i don;t know how it works without xinerama. the mouse will not move over to second screen without it
2007-01-10T16:53:00.000Z	freakabcd		err.. i've never done it myself. so would be nice if you can tell me how the heck you got the input devices to be active on the second screen
2007-01-10T16:53:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	he just said he didn;'t :)
2007-01-10T16:55:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	tha's weird - it should just activate when you click the taskbar button...
2007-01-10T16:57:00.000Z	freakabcd	adaptr	actually i tried with just plain X as well.
2007-02-18T09:52:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	then do so ?
2007-02-18T09:52:00.000Z	freakabcd	adaptr	well i was looking for a solution that wouldn't require me to *restart* X
2007-02-18T09:53:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	chicken-and-egg impossible
2007-02-18T09:53:00.000Z	freakabcd	adaptr	no. it is possible. just the method is unknown at the moment
2007-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	whatever you like
2007-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	you'll have to exit your Gnome session, which is tantamount to logging out
2007-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	as long as you're inside the session, ~/.gnome will be locked
2007-02-18T09:54:00.000Z	freakabcd	adaptr	yeah i'm aware
2007-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	nautilus settings are in /.gnome-private, or something, or perhaps gnome2
2007-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	gtk2, even
2007-02-18T10:18:00.000Z	freakabcd	adaptr	hell is not family friendly ?
2007-02-18T10:18:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	it's unnecessary
2007-02-18T10:26:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	what should I do with that ?
2007-02-18T10:26:00.000Z	adaptr	freakabcd	not really, I never use it
