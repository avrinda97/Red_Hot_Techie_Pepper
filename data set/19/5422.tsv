2010-04-28T07:11:00.000Z	shayne		any one here know about WindowsXPUnderQemu
2010-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	I use virtualbox to run windows most of the time
2010-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	easy setup
2010-04-28T07:13:00.000Z	shayne	hololight	is that able to run world of warcraft?
2010-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	doubtful, as would qemu.... but wine runs wow well for me (at least in the past
2010-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	there is very little to no support for 3d in any of the virtualization products right now
2010-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	hololight		although there is a bit of opengl (which wow supports... or did) in at least virutalbox
2010-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	shayne	hololight	i tried wine and it installed wine itself but evrytime i tried to install wow it wouldnt work, just lock up the installtion all the time, something with the graphics. i researched it and i can run wow using qemu
2010-04-28T07:16:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	i never installed wow in wine... just copied (or ran in place) from where it was installed in windows.
2010-04-28T07:17:00.000Z	shayne		did that work good?
2010-04-28T07:17:00.000Z	shayne	hololight	did that work good?
2010-04-28T07:17:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	yeah, wine doesn't care
2010-04-28T07:18:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	for a while i ran it in opengl mode... then at some point something changed and directx (default) ran bvetter
2010-04-28T07:19:00.000Z	shayne	hololight	maybe ill try installing it to a protable hardrive on a windows computer then coppying it to ubuntu
2010-04-28T07:19:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	For the most part, you couldn't tell the difference between running it native and running it in wine
2010-04-28T07:19:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	I had it on a second partition, but its the same idea.... remember its over 8 gigs
2010-04-28T07:20:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	there are a few howto's (one in the community docs) that show some options to set
2010-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	shayne	hololight	well i dont have a windows partition on any of my computers but my mom has it on her computer
2010-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	hololight	shayne	just copy the current wow directory to something and drop it in your home folder, or anywhere
