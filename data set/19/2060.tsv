2010-08-01T11:41:00.000Z	Janus5		Question: Is there a way to adjust the size of one's Swap Partition?
2010-08-01T11:42:00.000Z	Janus5		Ah, so poor idea. When I originally installed Ubuntu, I WAY overdid the size of my Swap.
2010-08-01T11:42:00.000Z	Janus5		I tried Kubuntu a long time ago, but had problems finding software.
2010-08-01T11:44:00.000Z	Janus5		I tried Googling about 'resize swap space', but what I found tended to be about live disks. Unless maybe I NEED a live disk to perform such an operation.
2010-08-01T11:44:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	why do u need to resize swap
2010-08-01T11:49:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	theoretically your swap shouldn't exceed 1.5x the size of physical memory but i don't know as if it will really slow the system that much.  still, if i had to resize it, i think i'd boot off a livecd, delete the swap partition, and make a new one.  i can't see how you'd recover the lost space, it won't be part of any partition
2010-08-01T11:51:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	use gparted to do that - which might not be on the livecd.  so after you boot the livecd, go to a shell and "apt-get install gparted".  or you could use fdisk if you are more comfortable with that
2010-08-01T11:52:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	the problem is if you get into using the swap, having an excessively large space defined can make your system slow.
2010-08-01T11:52:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	you cannot remove the swap space on system that is using it
2010-08-01T11:53:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	make it 1.5 physical ram
2010-08-01T11:53:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	windows also uses swap but they don't give you options to config at setup time
2010-08-01T11:54:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	1.5 times physical ram.  if you have 4g of ram, make your swap 6g
2010-08-01T11:54:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	then 3g is a fair number
2010-08-01T11:55:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	the 1.5 is not a hard and fast rule
2010-08-01T11:56:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	linux is extremely efficient with ram - 2g ram is not enough to run any windows version but more than enough for any linux
2010-08-01T11:56:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	better to be too big than too small!!!
2010-08-01T11:56:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	do you know what swap is?
2010-08-01T11:58:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	when your system runs low on physical ram, it writes out part of its memory to swap to free it up for other things.  when the running program whose memory has been swapped starts running again, its memory copy is read back in off of disk.  if you run out of swap you will crash
2010-08-01T12:00:00.000Z	blitzo	Janus5	when you start running low on both physical and swap, your system will thrash - copying back and forth between swap and physical memory quickly, the harddisk goes berserk and system slows to a crawl.  you don't want to get to that.  use enough swap.  1.5 times to 2 times physical ram is about right
