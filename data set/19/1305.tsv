2011-03-05T06:31:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	clear the existing database and relist
2011-03-05T06:31:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	Tried that, about 3 times
2011-03-05T06:32:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	how did you do that
2011-03-05T06:32:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	Highlighted all (ctrl + a), then went to edit -> remove
2011-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	what about completely purging it
2011-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	What do you mean?
2011-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	rhythmbox
2011-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	Hm>?
2011-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	purge it and reinstall
2011-03-05T06:34:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	Does that mean uninstall/reinstall?
2011-03-05T06:34:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	go into synaptic package manager and do it from there
2011-03-05T06:35:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	trying another music player such as audacious (very light) or banshee as well.
2011-03-05T06:35:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	Would Audacious work with my PSP?
2011-03-05T06:36:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	doubtful, banshee would more likely (audacious is very bare bones)
2011-03-05T06:37:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	What do you prefer? Between Rhythmbox and Banshee?
2011-03-05T06:38:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	neither, I use audacious
2011-03-05T06:40:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	I don't see a 'purge' option in the Synaptic Package Manager
2011-03-06T07:55:00.000Z	bazhang	iCyrus	how does this relate to ubuntu
2011-03-06T07:55:00.000Z	iCyrus	bazhang	I'm on Ubuntu, didn't know if it was a problem with Ubuntu or not
