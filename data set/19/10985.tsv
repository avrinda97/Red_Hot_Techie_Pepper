2006-06-03T07:10:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	nm-tool output doesn't mention the ath0 interface?
2006-06-03T07:16:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	In that case, you should file a bug at http://launchpad.net
2006-06-03T07:10:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	Open terminal, type 'nm-tool' and look at the output.
2006-06-03T07:11:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	"The regular one"? What are you using?
2006-06-03T07:12:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	You say the regular one sees it.
2006-06-03T07:12:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	Oh.
2006-06-03T07:13:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	You can always try to restart networkmanager:     /etc/dbus-1/event.d/25NetworkManager restart
2006-06-03T07:15:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	And this is just plain Ubuntu? You haven't installed anything extra or fiddled with anything?
2006-06-03T07:19:00.000Z	wubrgamer	shawarma	what is that ?
2006-06-03T07:20:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	universe is free stuff. Multiverse isn't.
2006-06-03T07:29:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	do this: sudo killall NetworkManager ; sudo NetworkManager --no-daemon
2006-06-03T07:29:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	Oh, wait.
2006-06-03T07:30:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	Did you get that? Yo uneed to remove all info about ath0 from /etc/network/interfaces
2006-06-03T07:56:00.000Z	shawarma	wubrgamer	It's already installed.
