2007-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	ive tried that, and i have no idea how it updates :|
2007-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	Just install sun-java6-jre or whatever
2007-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	will it take over my old 1.4 installation?
2007-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	How did you install 1.4?
2007-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	er, wait.  What version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	I'm using Ubuntu studion 7.04 (fiesty)
2007-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	How on earth did you get 1.4 on that?
2007-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	I'm not sure... i think it was a plugin...
2007-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	a plugin?  What have you done so far?  plugin for what?
2007-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	well im not sure honestly, to my memory i think it actually did come with 1.4 i dont recall installing java at all
2007-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	Do you mean 4.1?  7.04 doesn't have java.  You should ask in #ubuntustudio, see if theyve got any java by default.  gcj (the open source java) is version 4.1, and it's installed by default (I believe)
2007-06-24T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	whats the package name?
2007-06-24T12:41:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	its not a package in synaptic i think its a firefox plugin im not sure tho, lemme browse around and check it
2007-06-24T12:50:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	ok so its the firefox plugin for sure, i just need to remove that and update it with the newer plugin i suppose
2007-06-24T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	that page has instructions on isntalling the new java, as well as the FF plugin
2007-06-24T12:51:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	do i have to remove the old one? or does the new one update it if i install it?
2007-06-24T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	PIPBoy	Remove the old one, yes.
2007-06-24T12:51:00.000Z	PIPBoy	Flannel	Awesome thanks for putting up with me :)
