2010-01-26T03:55:00.000Z	DreamDemon|compi	happy	If I get a good compile this time I'm gonna be soooooo annoyed with git
2010-01-26T03:55:00.000Z	happy	DreamDemon|compi	compiling a kernel with next to nothing in it is hard. I tried that :-\
2010-01-26T03:56:00.000Z	DreamDemon|compi	happy	Thats what I'm doing now.  Stripped out all the crap that isnt even in my machine nor connected to it ( or ever will ) ... like token ring, atm, etc
2010-01-26T03:57:00.000Z	happy	DreamDemon|compi	I tried to strip out everything that was not needed for a vm
2010-01-26T03:58:00.000Z	DreamDemon|compi	happy	amusing how I havent gotten nearly the error msgs from vanilla as I did from git so far
2010-01-26T03:58:00.000Z	happy	DreamDemon|compi	I suggest starting with the ubuntu sources. They are patched to work with ubuntu
2010-01-26T03:59:00.000Z	DreamDemon|compi	happy	I did and it puked every time.  Something to do with merged config files.  Tired of it puking and manually force feeding it to work like it's supposed to
