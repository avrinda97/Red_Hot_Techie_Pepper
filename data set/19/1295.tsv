2011-03-08T16:24:00.000Z	Krahmer		Hello, I am trying to set up a hostname script that sets hostnames according to their MAC address. This list of MAC address and respective hostnames is derived from a properly formatted text file. The script works, we just need to have it working upon startup, any ideas?

2011-03-08T16:26:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	if you mean running it upon startup, call it in the ~/.bashrc file
2011-03-08T16:26:00.000Z	Krahmer		If you aren't losing much, save time and just reinstall
2011-03-08T16:27:00.000Z	Krahmer	callaghan	We got it running on startup, but it says but it doesn't read the file.
2011-03-08T16:27:00.000Z	Krahmer		We are using a while read
2011-03-08T16:29:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	but it works when you run it manually? it's a bash script I suppose?
2011-03-08T16:29:00.000Z	Krahmer		Yes to both
2011-03-08T16:29:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	what's the error message? ;)
2011-03-08T16:30:00.000Z	Krahmer		It doesn't give an error, it just doesn't change the hostname, we did some debugging and established that it does not read the file
2011-03-08T16:32:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	maybe the script is executed as a user who does not have read access to the file?
2011-03-08T16:33:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	or the file is located on a drive that is mounted after your script executes
2011-03-08T16:34:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	but it's very strange there is no error, that'd indicate the file it reads is in fact empty :/
2011-03-08T16:37:00.000Z	Krahmer		Could it be because the path name of the file it reads to get the addresses is relative and not absolute?

2011-03-08T16:38:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	it's possible, the working directory has to be the same (pwd)
2011-03-08T16:40:00.000Z	Krahmer	callaghan	We got it, path needed to be absolute
2011-03-08T16:40:00.000Z	Krahmer		Thanks a lot for your help, much appreciated.
2011-03-08T16:40:00.000Z	callaghan	Krahmer	:) no problem
