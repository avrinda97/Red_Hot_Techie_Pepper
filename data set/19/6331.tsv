2008-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	drpcken		geni, you're right
2008-02-08T08:24:00.000Z	drpcken		geni, says its a Linux system
2008-02-08T08:24:00.000Z	drpcken		i'll do what you said
2008-02-08T08:25:00.000Z	drpcken		also, i always disable system beep with rmmod pcspkr, but when i reboot the system beep returns
2008-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	create a file in /etc/modprobe.d/ named pcspeaker, and add the line   blacklist  pcspkr     to it. That will prevent it being reloaded on boot
2008-02-08T08:29:00.000Z	drpcken	nickrud	it won't let me create a file in /etc/modprobe.d/
2008-02-08T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	you have to do    sudoedit  /etc/modprobe.d/pcspeaker , you need admin privs to write in /etc
2008-02-08T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	apt-cache policy <packgname>
2008-02-08T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	isn't 1.4.7 the latest in the repos?
2008-02-08T09:07:00.000Z	drpcken	nickrud	yes you are right, i just checked and mines 1.4.7
2008-02-08T09:08:00.000Z	drpcken	nickrud	oops :)
2008-02-08T09:08:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	but you were right, that's the correct way to get the latest _supported_ amarok ;)
2008-02-08T09:08:00.000Z	drpcken	nickrud	second day using Ubuntu, i'd say that was pretty good advice ;)
2008-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	install gsynaptics , add the line   Option "SHMConfig" "1" , restart X and you'll have a gui tool under prefs
2008-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	add that line to the touchpad part of /etc/X11/xorg , that is
2008-02-24T08:43:00.000Z	drpcken	nickrud	I did that and used the GUI for Touchpad, but it doesn't work after i set the settings
2008-02-24T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	a sec, I need to reset that again myself. brb
2008-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	ok, the gui works for me, but it doesn't control touchpad speed.
2008-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	nickrud	drpcken	the sensitivity controls how hard I have to touch the pad to make it work (and I turned off tap click, I'd almost adapted but since I can easily...)
