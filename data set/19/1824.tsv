2011-07-03T00:29:00.000Z	kwtm2		How do I know what the root password is for my MySQL system?
2011-07-03T00:30:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	if you installed it from the repos, it asks you to set one when installing
2011-07-03T00:30:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	Okay ... and how do I know what that is?
2011-07-03T00:30:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	well, try to remember?
2011-07-03T00:30:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	Do I need to have recorded that password?  Also, assuming I did not install it from repos, how do I know?
2011-07-03T00:30:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	(I think it was part of the Amarok installation, present by default)
2011-07-03T00:31:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	assuming you did not install it from the repos, it's not supported here. The mysql documentation shows how you can recover from lost root password
2011-07-03T00:31:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	Thank you.  Which MySQL documentation?  I google for it, or is there man mysql?
2011-07-03T00:31:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	Wait, what do you mean it's not supported here?  It's v 10.04 --it should be long-term support, no?
2011-07-03T00:32:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	yes, there's plenty mysql documentation. I said that "if it was not installed from the repos" - meaning it's 3rd party software, then it's not supported here
2011-07-03T00:32:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	My ultimate purpose is that I'm trying to do a fresh reinstallation of mythtv, but "apt-get purge mythtv" did not work (after reinstalling, it still said password was wrong)
2011-07-03T00:33:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	Okay, so if it was installed from the repos, but I did not install it from the repos, what then?
2011-07-03T00:33:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	meaning if the installation was there by default and I had no hand in installing it?
2011-07-03T00:33:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	what now?
2011-07-03T00:33:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	in that case you should aks the person that did install it
2011-07-03T00:34:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	Well, I installed it from the live DVD but I don't recall it asking me for a password -- I just let it run, and it came up with a working Ubuntu system.
2011-07-03T00:34:00.000Z	oCean	kwtm2	are you talking about password for ubuntu or mysql?
2011-07-03T00:34:00.000Z	kwtm2	oCean	MySQL.  I need it to fix MythTV, apparently.
