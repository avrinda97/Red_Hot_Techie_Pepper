2010-07-27T20:27:00.000Z	Varazir		Hello I got this from a nother channel how can I check it " your ubuntu machine probably turned on iptables firewall by default"
2010-07-27T20:28:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 sudo iptables -L
2010-07-27T20:28:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 pastebin the output
2010-07-27T20:28:00.000Z	Varazir	EvilPhoenix	it was empty
2010-07-27T20:29:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 did it say "(policy DROP)" without the quotes anywhere

2010-07-27T20:30:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 there's nothing blocking anything on your system locally.
2010-07-27T20:30:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 so iptables might not be your issue, but it IS there
2010-07-27T20:30:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 its just not filtering anything.  its letting everything in to your system
2010-07-27T20:30:00.000Z	Varazir	EvilPhoenix	The problem is that I have a server that is arping all my system 60 times /h
2010-07-27T20:31:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 and i'm on a network that gets over 200 ARP hits every minute
2010-07-27T20:31:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 i wouldnt worry about it unless you really want to filter out ARP
2010-07-27T20:31:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 which is a pain and not a good idea
2010-07-27T20:32:00.000Z	Varazir	EvilPhoenix	ok, just I'm running a splunk server and after I installed it I keep getting more arp req
2010-07-27T20:32:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 how do you know you're getting those ARP requests... using wireshark or something?
2010-07-27T20:33:00.000Z	Varazir	EvilPhoenix	my router logs them, and Splunks is a indexing server
2010-07-27T20:33:00.000Z	Varazir	EvilPhoenix	the last H I have 2369 arps
2010-07-27T20:33:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	Varazir	 ah, i dont think its anything to really worry about, i get 100s of ARP requests either my IP or just normal traffic on my network all the time.  ARP requests arent really going to pwn you
2010-07-27T20:34:00.000Z	Varazir	EvilPhoenix	ok
