2010-04-27T00:58:00.000Z	RumblePure		i'm on kubuntu. cant change ip-number on eth1. its ip-number keeps jumping back when i bring up the interface
2010-04-27T00:59:00.000Z	RumblePure		I do: sudo ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up.
2010-04-27T00:59:00.000Z	RumblePure		But after the command, ip-number has jumped back
2010-04-27T01:00:00.000Z	RumblePure		How do i change ip-number on kubuntu?
2010-04-27T01:00:00.000Z	osaris	RumblePure	http://pastebin.com/ add whats in    cat /etc/network/interfaces
2010-04-27T01:01:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	It doesnt look good: http://pastebin.com/NBZ6RcFy
2010-04-27T01:02:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	I want to temporarily change ip number in order to reach my modem
2010-04-27T01:05:00.000Z	osaris	RumblePure	i can create a config file for you but i prefer you do it with your gui
2010-04-27T01:06:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	no problem. what gui?
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	I think the default networkmanager in kubuntu is junk.
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	I'm on kubuntu.
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	kubuntu desktop.
2010-04-27T01:07:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	I think it is the networkmanager that is causing me my headache
2010-04-27T01:17:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	I cracked it. I must say I'm extremely frustrated with the amount of time that I lost, but I should not allow that to come in the way of some proper courtesy: thx osaris.
2010-04-27T01:18:00.000Z	osaris	RumblePure	np i wanted to show you how to static set it but then also saw some interesting config parameters in the dhcp3 config file which would work good temporary
2010-04-27T01:20:00.000Z	RumblePure	osaris	the problem was that I am using a gui network manage right? It really didnt matter what I did through the prompt, the gui manager would override my settings, right?
2010-04-27T01:22:00.000Z	osaris	RumblePure	i am not sure. have only set this on servers
2010-04-27T01:23:00.000Z	osaris	RumblePure	i think it does overwrite it
