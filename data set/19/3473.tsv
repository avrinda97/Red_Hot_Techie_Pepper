2010-05-28T10:31:00.000Z	sain		hello
2010-05-28T10:33:00.000Z	sain		Can any one help. how do you add "open folder in terminal" option to right click menu?
2010-05-28T10:34:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	For that, enter this command in terminal: sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
2010-05-28T10:38:00.000Z	sain	rocket16	i installed nautilus -open-terminal. what do i do next?
2010-05-28T10:39:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Just right-click anywhere inside a folder, now select "Open Terminal Here"
2010-05-28T10:40:00.000Z	sain	rocket16	"open in terminal" is not among the right click menu options
2010-05-28T10:41:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Well, go to the Desktop once, and in any blank area, right-click, now is there anything in the menu like "Open in Terminal"?
2010-05-28T10:41:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Sure, you can use Nautilus-Scripts. An easier way is to use Ubuntu-Tweaks tool, which can do it via GUI.
2010-05-28T10:42:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Does the menu-entry come now?
2010-05-28T10:44:00.000Z	sain	rocket16	i'm still trying to figure out how to find it in Ubuntu tweaks
2010-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	under personal group, there us an entry "manage scripts". Enter there to edit nautilus scripts.
2010-05-28T10:52:00.000Z	sain	rocket16	i got to Manage scripts, but there is no option to open folder in terminal
2010-05-28T10:53:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Yes, it is difficult to set such one. Is the Nautilus-open-terminal script installed?
2010-05-28T10:53:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	I believe, the Package is not installed properly, :(
2010-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	sain	rocket16	i'll try to restart machine and reinstall nautilus
2010-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Sure,
2010-05-28T10:55:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	Just go to a terminal, and type: killall -user username (username is your username there) and it will serve as same like Restart
2010-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	sain	rocket16	thanks. it works like a champ.
2010-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	rocket16	sain	You are welcome, friend, :)
