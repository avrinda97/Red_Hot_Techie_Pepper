2011-08-05T13:40:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	i simply want to reassign alt+1 in xterm
2011-08-05T13:36:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	man xrdb
2011-08-05T13:37:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	i looked it up online as well
2011-08-05T13:38:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	that's probably xkb..
2011-08-05T13:38:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	it's not a novice topic..
2011-08-05T13:39:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	is there a channel more appropriate?
2011-10-12T08:58:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	u talking about "apt-cache policy <packagename>" ?
2011-10-12T08:58:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	no, I don't think so
2011-10-12T09:03:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	you're having a problem with a meta key?
2011-10-12T09:03:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	setxkbmap won't undo
2011-10-12T09:03:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	meta key is Ctl, alt, SHift, ...
2011-10-12T09:03:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	since you're using vbox.. vbox probably interferes with a meta key (i know in vmware it can)
2011-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	I'm trying to use all default stuff
2011-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	check in ur vbox settings..
2011-10-12T09:05:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	that may be a meta key for vbox.. vbox may be interfering with that..
2011-10-12T09:05:00.000Z	cypha	yagoo	it's not
2011-10-12T09:19:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	LOL
2011-10-12T09:20:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	you said you were going to try cli!! LOL.. you can't?!!
2011-10-12T09:22:00.000Z	yagoo	cypha	try using tape with the ctl key :)
