2005-04-13T11:59:00.000Z	malte		could anyone please run grep -c '^Package' available and tell me what number they get?
2005-04-13T11:59:00.000Z	malte		ehm
2005-04-13T11:59:00.000Z	malte		grep -c '^Package' /var/lib/dpkg/available
2005-04-13T11:59:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	1894. Why?
2005-04-13T12:00:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	thanks, mine seems to be b0rk :)
2005-04-13T12:01:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	the number of lines in your available file that starts with "Package:"
2005-04-13T12:02:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	i'm not sure :) i'm trying to figure out what's supposed to be there
2005-04-13T12:08:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	Cause I was just thinking if you can alter that number by flushing your local repositories by apt-get clean.
2005-04-13T12:08:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	oh
2005-04-13T12:09:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	But don't take my word on that, I have been documentedly wrong before. :)
2005-04-13T12:11:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	Take a loot at here: http://www.educ.umu.se/~bjorn/mhonarc-files/debian-user-small/msg01977.html
2005-04-13T12:11:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	ah, that was my guess! thanks
2005-04-13T12:12:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	Np. Glad to be of help.
2005-04-13T12:14:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	btw, isn't your 1894 a tad small then?
2005-04-13T12:16:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	I suppose. I have Hoary main/universe/multiverse/security in my sources.list.
2005-04-13T12:16:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	same here. but mine is about 10 times yours :)
2005-04-13T12:21:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	Thanks for pointing that out, I have to look up on that later. Now I go -> sauna. :)
2005-04-13T12:22:00.000Z	malte	AstralJava	hehe, enjoy ;)
2005-04-13T12:22:00.000Z	AstralJava	malte	Thanks, sure will. :)
