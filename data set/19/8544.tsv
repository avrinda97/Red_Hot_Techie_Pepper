2012-05-14T04:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryguy_	The fact that you can't find anywhere else does *not* mean that you can ask offtopic questions here.
2012-05-14T04:12:00.000Z	bryguy_		what part of my question defines "off-topic"?
2012-05-14T04:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryguy_	Your discussion of mint is off topic, even if it's not in the form of a question.
