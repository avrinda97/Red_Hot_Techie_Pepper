2005-10-21T13:15:00.000Z	flask-		Hi I was wondering if someone could please help me diagnose my sound issues on Breezy?
2005-10-21T13:16:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	what's the issue?
2005-10-21T13:17:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	cat /proc/asound/modules
2005-10-21T13:18:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	no such file or directory
2005-10-21T13:18:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	then ALSA wasn't loaded properly. What's the output from: lspci -v|grep -i audio
2005-10-21T13:19:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	0000:00:07.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 50)
2005-10-21T13:19:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	lsmod|grep ^snd_via82xx
2005-10-21T13:19:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	scroll up, already said dmesg reports it's fine
2005-10-21T13:19:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	#2: VIA 82C686A/B rev50 with ICE1232 at 0xa000, irq 9
2005-10-21T13:20:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	that has nothing to do with the command I just gave you.
2005-10-21T13:20:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	ah my bad. i'm not using modules, so that command doens't apply.
2005-10-21T13:21:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	using your own kernel? How can we possibly support manual configurations? There are a plethora of possible screwups.
2005-10-21T13:21:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	i'm not asking for the ubuntu team to support it, i came here looking for community support/advice
2005-10-21T13:22:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	if you don't the standard kernel, it's difficult to know where things could have gone wrong.
2005-10-21T13:22:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	it worked fine w/ the same kernel under hoary
2005-10-21T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	the same kernel? And which one is that?
2005-10-21T13:23:00.000Z	flask-	crimsun	i built it from vanilla sources
2005-10-21T13:24:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	so post your .config somewhere. You really need to help the troubleshooting process...
2005-10-21T13:29:00.000Z	crimsun	flask-	ping me when you're ready.
