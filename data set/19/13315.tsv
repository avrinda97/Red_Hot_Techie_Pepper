2005-04-21T09:50:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	yeah, it's bewitched.
2005-04-21T09:51:00.000Z	archangel_X19	pauldaoust	do I need a priest or a manual?
2005-04-21T09:51:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	try a priest ^_^
2005-04-21T09:51:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	unfortunately, I have no idea. what were you doing when it ejected?
2005-04-21T09:51:00.000Z	archangel_X19	pauldaoust	I know a guy who knows a guy that knows Constantine.  I'll see whats up.
2005-04-21T09:52:00.000Z	archangel_X19	pauldaoust	cedega is running when it happens most but then it will just kind of pop out when I leave it idle
2005-04-21T09:55:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	sorry, my brain is just friend from all the conversation wheeling by... what did you say most recently?
2005-04-21T09:56:00.000Z	archangel_X19	pauldaoust	cedega is running most of the time but sometimes when there is a cd in the first drive it will randomly eject after I wake up from a nap
2005-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	so it's connected to the nap in some way... hmmmm... ^_^
2005-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	archangel_X19	pauldaoust	lol why did that not come to me?
2005-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	because it's a dumb idea ^_^
2005-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	pauldaoust	archangel_X19	I'm full of them...
2005-04-21T09:58:00.000Z	archangel_X19	pauldaoust	I just mean I never expect it and, suprise! my drive it open!
