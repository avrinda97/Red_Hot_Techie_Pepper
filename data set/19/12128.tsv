2006-04-16T06:34:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	nrg2iso
2006-04-16T06:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	Ah, thanks.
2006-04-16T06:35:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	what the heck is .daa?
2006-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	I'm not sure, but it seems to be similar to an iso.  Something I downloaded came as that.
2006-04-16T06:37:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	filext.com says it's poweriso format
2006-04-16T06:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	So now the question is just what that actually means.
2006-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	"DAA is a format for an image file, which supports some advanced features, such as compression, password protection, and splitting to multiple volumes (similar to .RAR and other compression formats)."
2006-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	Does that give any hints as to what I need to deal with it?
2006-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	I'd say windows ;)
2006-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	All right, that is actually a possibility.  Off to search for a Windows proggy to convert it to plain old iso I guess.
2006-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	you can be the first to create a tool that's capable of converting from this crappy format into iso ;)
2006-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	And once again my answer has to be "If I had any useful programming knowledge I would".
2006-04-16T06:41:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	never too late to learn and reverse engineer without documentation :)
2006-04-16T06:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	Could you put those in some appropriate factoid?
2006-04-16T06:54:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	the links?
2006-04-16T06:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	Yeah, comes up sometimes, so might be useful.
2006-04-16T06:54:00.000Z	CosmoDad	tonyyarusso	unfortunately, I don't know how to create factoids and I haven't even tested the tools
2006-04-16T06:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CosmoDad	Point.
