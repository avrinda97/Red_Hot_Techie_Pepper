2012-01-25T21:01:00.000Z	hjack76		sup guys, i'm having a nvidia-related resolution issue, can anybody lend me a hand? i get no response from #nvidia...
2012-01-25T21:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	what is the issue?
2012-01-25T21:02:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	i can't set a specific resolution, 1600x900
2012-01-25T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	does nvidia-settings give an error when it's launched/
2012-01-25T21:03:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	i'm on a philips HDTV, i know it can do it and i can even set it to 1080p
2012-01-25T21:03:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	no, it actually just won't display that res in nvidia-settings
2012-01-25T21:04:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	i tried adding the mode using xrandr
2012-01-25T21:04:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	it "kinda" works, but parts of the screen are missing
2012-01-25T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	if you run:   gksudo nvidia-xconfig; gksudo nvidia-settings     set the res to something and click "save to x config file". Close nvidia-settings and run:  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     and change the resolution in the screen section to what you desire and rebot
2012-01-25T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	if you get no display, drop to root recovery mode and rename or delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf    and reboot. Note the X in X11 is CAPITALIZED, Linux is case sensitive
2012-01-25T21:07:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	gonna try it now, ty in advance
2012-01-25T21:36:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	hey dude, it's the guy with the resolution problem again
2012-01-25T21:37:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	didn't work, i got black screen
2012-01-25T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	dang
2012-01-25T21:38:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	i assume it's EDID-related... after all i'm not having high-res limitation, it's just the res that i want that doesn't show in nvidia-settings
2012-01-25T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	yea, sounds like your screen isnt reporting it/ Good screens do that
2012-01-25T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	you'll need to fight the xorg.conf file til it plaus nice
2012-01-25T21:41:00.000Z	hjack76	ActionParsnip	fact is, there's a point when i can get 1600x900_60 to work, but parts of the screen go missing
2012-01-25T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hjack76	here is mine:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/816638/   my screen sets a stupidly high res with insane DPI resulting in huge text and tony everything else
