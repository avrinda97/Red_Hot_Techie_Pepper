2007-11-05T01:32:00.000Z	elliottcable		I downloaded Ubuntu desktop edition 64bit, 7.10
2007-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	elliottcable		and burned to a CD
2007-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	elliottcable		then booted to it
2007-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	elliottcable		it took FOREVER to boot, I though it had just frozen, but it finally came to a pixelated Ubuntu window
2007-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	elliottcable		I chose boot or install, the first option, first time
2007-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	elliottcable		and that ended up at a black screen with a blinking underscore
2007-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	elliottcable		tried OEM install
2007-11-05T01:34:00.000Z	elliottcable		that did the whole loading linux kerlen thing
2007-11-05T01:34:00.000Z	elliottcable		then ended up at a black scren with a blinking underscore
