2006-12-05T08:38:00.000Z	Kervan	jrib	i have compiled my projects before but i am not familar with patching
2006-12-05T08:39:00.000Z	Kervan	jrib	which file to patch i dont know
2006-12-05T08:39:00.000Z	jrib	Kervan	man patch is pretty readable, but in general:  patch -p num < file.patch    where num is explained better in man patch than I can do, but basically strips /'s from the paths in the diff so the directory structure matches up
2006-12-05T08:40:00.000Z	jrib	Kervan	if it is just one file, you can omit -p.  Just do patch < file.patch  .  You can read the file.patch in a text editor to see the file it is patching, let me dig up a good link for you
