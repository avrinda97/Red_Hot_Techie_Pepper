2011-03-27T06:49:00.000Z	guampa	eps	what card? radeon is working fine, newest kernel tho- why don't you upgrade the kernel?
2011-03-27T06:50:00.000Z	eps	guampa	ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M6 LY rev 0
2011-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	eps	guampa	what kernel do you recommend for Lucid?
2011-03-27T06:52:00.000Z	guampa	eps	try to make-kpá¸±g the newest vanilla or otherwise get the newest (for lucid) from kernel.ubuntu.com
2011-03-27T06:57:00.000Z	eps	guampa	Thanks for your help. I didn't know about kernel.ubuntu.com (or #ubuntu-kernel).
2011-03-27T06:58:00.000Z	guampa	eps	good luck, and also try with catalyst if other options fail..though radeon is getting better in 2.6.38
2011-03-27T07:00:00.000Z	eps	guampa	this is old hardware -- and a laptop, so replacing the video card isn't an option.
2011-03-27T07:00:00.000Z	guampa	eps	with catalyst i meant the propietary driver for your card
2011-03-27T07:01:00.000Z	eps	guampa	I'm not using proprietary drivers, and ATI doesn't support old h/w nearly as long as nVidia
2011-03-27T07:03:00.000Z	guampa	eps	then you are mostly going with radeon and a new kernel, try to get the last one, its working good here since its been out
2011-03-27T07:10:00.000Z	eps	guampa	unofficial ATI wiki says "Unless you run an ancient distro, using the open source drivers is your only option."
2011-03-27T07:13:00.000Z	guampa	eps	lucid isn't "ancient" ... i know that driver runs in Lucid but everything depends also on Catalyst (fglrx) supporting your chipset
2011-03-27T07:27:00.000Z	eps	guampa	Interesting. kernel-package was demoted to universe beginning with Lucid.
2011-03-27T07:28:00.000Z	guampa	eps	https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=lucid
2011-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	eps	guampa	"untrusted PPA?" That sounds ominous.
2011-03-27T07:30:00.000Z	guampa	eps	lol, i had the courage and accepted it, still alive and kickin :P}
2011-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	guampa	eps	it's a well known repo, not 100% sure but i think the official kernel maintainers are there too
2011-03-27T07:32:00.000Z	eps	guampa	I'm just wondering why kernels don't find their way into lucid-backports
2011-03-27T07:33:00.000Z	guampa	eps	i don't know, i don't tend to use backports, even less for new kernels. i go with this ppa or directly compile a fresh one from kernel.org
