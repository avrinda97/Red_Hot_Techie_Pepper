2006-11-01T10:02:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	change your source.lst so dapper says edgy
2006-11-01T10:03:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-11-01T10:03:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	But the wiki warns NOT to do that
2006-11-01T10:03:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	"Upgrading using apt-get -- NOT RECOMMENDED"
2006-11-01T10:04:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	then download the cd if you want to feel safe downloading the iso is good also
2006-11-01T10:05:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	So the only way is to run the update script from the alternate cd?
2006-11-01T10:05:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	yeah if you want to feel safe
2006-11-01T10:06:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	Thanks.
2006-11-02T06:19:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	think launchpad has a section for webiste
2006-11-02T06:20:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	Thanks, I should have checked first :)
2006-11-04T09:57:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	well I know you can't mount /dev/sda
2006-11-04T09:58:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	He was asking about modules, not mounting
2006-11-04T09:58:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	is that why he said I m trying to mount /dev/sda but what must I modprobe to get that
2006-11-04T09:59:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	He never said that
2006-11-04T09:59:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	is that why it says 22:53 < Agent_bob> it seems i forget from one time to the next how sorry ubuntu really is.   </rant>   i'm trying to mount /dev/sda but there is no device node   (sda does not exist)    what do i have to modprobe to make that ?
2006-11-04T10:00:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	And if sda dose not exist, niether does sda1
2006-11-04T10:01:00.000Z	kitche	jordan	sure it does I don't have a sda device but got bunch of sda1-10
2006-11-04T10:01:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	Ok, mabe you'r right, I admit I hadn't seen his previous comment before you mentioned it.
2006-11-04T10:02:00.000Z	jordan	kitche	And I do have a /dev/sda
