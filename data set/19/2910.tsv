2010-01-08T22:52:00.000Z	BrodeurPC		is the GeForce2 MX video card no longer supported with ubuntu 9.10?
2010-01-08T22:53:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	you probably have to isntall the correct restricted driver , it it's an older card it,s the  nvidia 173 driver I beleive
2010-01-08T22:55:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	it detected the driver as the nvidia 96, i installed it but now when it boots up it tells me that its running in low graphics mode because settings could not be detected
2010-01-08T22:55:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	hmm,  let me check
2010-01-08T23:02:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	about your driver  the best suggestion I can offer is to check the nvidia.com website see which driver is recommended for your card , and if it is different then the one available on ubuntu , use the one from the website
2010-01-08T23:03:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	ok thank you for the help, if i can't get it to work i'll just throw the card out and get something newer
2010-01-08T23:03:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	throw it out in my general direction I do wonders with old hardware
2010-01-08T23:05:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	its a pulled card from an old Dell and I know that Dell usually has versions of nVidia cards made for them, could this cause any problems with the ubuntu suggested driver?
2010-01-08T23:06:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	most companies work like that,   it's the chipset of the card that is important,  that's what the driver is for
2010-01-08T23:08:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	yeah the chipset on the card says GeForce2 MX, it doesnt even have a heat sink on it, must be a badly low end card
2010-01-08T23:08:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	it'S possible it's no longer supported
2010-01-08T23:09:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	no big loss if it isnt
2010-01-08T23:10:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	if youcan use it wth the vesa driver why not just use it like that,   I doub'T a card that old would let you run all the compiz candy anyway
2010-01-08T23:11:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	the computer its in has onboard video as well, ill just put it back to the on board and use the card in something else
2010-01-08T23:12:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	if you like old hardware you would have a field day in my basement
2010-01-08T23:17:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	do ".run" files work with Ubuntu
2010-01-08T23:17:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	yes, they are bin installers
2010-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	Pelo	BrodeurPC	you'll hve to quit x to install that driver,   sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-01-08T23:18:00.000Z	BrodeurPC	Pelo	Dr_Willis. sounds good thank you for the help
