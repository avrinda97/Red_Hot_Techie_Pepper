2009-10-11T18:19:00.000Z	almagest_divine		how can i find the com port number of my usb port to which my device is connected? it shows my device in lsusb and dmesg
2009-10-11T18:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	is a usb to serial converter??
2009-10-11T18:21:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	what is that?
2009-10-11T18:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	what type of device is the one you are talking about ?
2009-10-11T18:21:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	its a mobile phone
2009-10-11T18:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	dmesg should tell you the /dev/ttyUSBx it gets
2009-10-11T18:23:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	yes. but i want the com port number. is tht com port number?
2009-10-11T18:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	linux uses device files.
2009-10-11T18:24:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	but my software wants com port number
2009-10-11T18:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	what software is that ?
2009-10-11T18:25:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	its webcam software
2009-10-11T18:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	o.0 how is a webcam software supposed to work with a mobile phone ???
2009-10-11T18:27:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	its like that. i just have to enter the com port number. it works in windows though
2009-10-11T18:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	i do not think you can make a mobie phone act as webcam in linux. at least i do not know how
2009-10-11T18:28:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	i just wanted to know if there was a way to find the com port number?
2009-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	in linux "com port number" does not make any sense. that's a DOS (windows) concept
2009-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	almagest_divine	in linux you have device nodes/files
2009-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	yes
2009-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	almagest_divine	erUSUL	ok thanks
