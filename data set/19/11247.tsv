2006-03-06T08:26:00.000Z	delmar		So what ubuntu type apps are there for cpu temp monitoring?
2006-03-06T08:27:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	there's a system monitor gnome-panel app
2006-03-06T08:28:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	whats the app called?
2006-03-06T08:28:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	one moment
2006-03-06T08:30:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	sudo apt-get install sensors-applet <- has support for all your hardware sensors
2006-03-06T08:31:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	nope.. that package isnt available... apt-cache search sensors only shows a couple of lib packages and lm-sensors etc.
2006-03-06T08:31:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	have you enabled the security, backports and other repositires in synaptic/apt-get?
2006-03-06T08:32:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	everything in sources.list is untouched and default.
2006-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	its a fresh install, plus just did online updates etc.
2006-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	that is the problem
2006-03-06T08:33:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	go into the /etc/apt/sources.list and remove all the comment-outs from the sources, except the deb-src entries
2006-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	wait is your syustem hoary or breezy?
2006-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	all other sources refer to hoary.
2006-03-06T08:35:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	what is breezy? testing kinda deal?
2006-03-06T08:36:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	breezy is the offical release now
2006-03-06T08:38:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-03-06T08:38:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	done that already.
2006-03-06T08:38:00.000Z	delmar	ssstormy	but i need to change the sources.list first i guess.
2006-03-06T08:39:00.000Z	ssstormy	delmar	look in your pm window
