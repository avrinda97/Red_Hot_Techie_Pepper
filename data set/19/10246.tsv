2012-05-09T00:13:00.000Z	darkfrog		Hey guys, I just upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 and it would appear NS lookups are failing now...it can't find google.com but if I type the ip address manually it can ping just fine
2012-05-09T00:13:00.000Z	darkfrog		anyone know what would cause that?
2012-05-09T00:14:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	did you ever manually edit resolv.conf?
2012-05-09T00:14:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	no
2012-05-09T00:14:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	just checked it and it's empty
2012-05-09T00:14:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	OK, and are you using DHCP or static IP?
2012-05-09T00:15:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	static
2012-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	you edited /etc/network/interfaces to get that static IP?
2012-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	yes
2012-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	do you know the IP address of the DNS server you want to use?
2012-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	http://pastebin.com/AcevQbYh
2012-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	it's an internal server
2012-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	same as the gateway?
2012-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	yeah
2012-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	try this - http://pastebin.com/YDLXjkVi
2012-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	restart networking before testing the changes.
2012-05-09T00:22:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	that seems to have fixed it
2012-05-09T00:22:00.000Z	mneptok	darkfrog	exmohlent.
2012-05-09T00:23:00.000Z	darkfrog	mneptok	thanks for the help. :)
