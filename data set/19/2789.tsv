2010-01-04T11:19:00.000Z	timfrost	desynch	are other programs able to do DNS lookups correctly?  Are you using a web proxy (and if so, is it correctly configured in BOTH synaptic AND in System->Preferences->Network Proxy)?

2010-01-04T11:25:00.000Z	timfrost	desynch	the error message you posted  ("Could not resolve 'archive.ubuntu.com'") suggested DNS issues.  Your pastebin of sources.list looks good.  What does the command ' host archive.ubuntu.com' report (it should list 4 IP addresses)?

2010-01-04T11:38:00.000Z	timfrost	desynch	failure to fetch a translation file isn't usually fatal (there aren't en_NZ translations, because en_NZ is close enough to en_UK).

The worrying thing is 'Failed to fetch http://ubuntu.mirrors.tds.net/pub/ubuntu/dists/karmic-security/Release.gpg  rename failed.
