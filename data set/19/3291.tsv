2009-10-17T18:37:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	post the output of mplayer on pastebin
2009-10-17T18:37:00.000Z	psinetic	cousin_mario	uh....huh?
2009-10-17T18:38:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	try `mplayer yourfile.avi` and copy what it says on pastebin.com
2009-10-17T18:41:00.000Z	psinetic	cousin_mario	what the....i typed "mplayer" and then dragged the file into terminal so it'd have an exact location and it said it couldn't find the file. so then i tried to cd to the drive and specific folder, and it said it couldn't fine it. wtf?
2009-10-17T18:42:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	where is it located?
2009-10-17T18:42:00.000Z	psinetic	cousin_mario	it's located in: /media/My Book/Icons/
2009-10-17T18:43:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	cd /media/My\ Book/Icons

2009-10-17T18:48:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	the binary codec doesn't seem to be available: did you install non-free-codecs ?
2009-10-17T18:48:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	and, are you on 32 or 64 bit?
2009-10-17T18:49:00.000Z	psinetic	cousin_mario	i did what bazhang told me to do. i'm using 64 bit
2009-10-17T18:49:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	I wasn't here yet when he told you, anyway I've encountered this issue myself
2009-10-17T18:49:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	there is no 64 bit version of the indeo codec, so merely installing the codec pack won't cut
2009-10-17T18:50:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	I never solved it, I suppose you'll have to run the 32bit version of mplayer and also install w32codecs, but it's hypotetical
2009-10-17T18:51:00.000Z	psinetic	cousin_mario	how do i get the 32 bit version of mplayer? :S
2009-10-17T18:51:00.000Z	cousin_mario	psinetic	you'll have to tinker with apt, but I'm no expert on the matter
