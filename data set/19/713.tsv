2011-12-01T05:11:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Well Mint is somewhat of a fork of Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:12:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		the packages are compatable with Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:12:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		The install process is identical to Ubutnu
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		I'm quite sure it is. That's why my question concerned Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Which secretly addressed a Mint issue ;-)
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Yes, it is.
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Ubuntu DOES install language packs without permission
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		which is carried over to mint
2011-12-01T05:15:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		To quote myself: (6:06:18 PM) Foxhoundz: Is there any reason why Ubuntu (and its derivatives) download/install language packs for no reason
2011-12-01T05:15:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		My question stated Ubuntu as the issue
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	pangolin	Foxhoundz	Please stop. Mint is not supported here. go ask in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.net
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		For the 4th time (+) , my question concerned Ubiquity + Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		I only mentioned Mint because it was based on Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		let's not get carried away people
2011-12-01T05:17:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	mbeierl	Thank you for your answer
2011-12-01T05:17:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		That actually helped.
2011-12-01T05:18:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		It would be nice if someone close to the devs could drop a suggestion to change this behavior
2011-12-01T05:18:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Its not pretty when you're on a metered bandwith
2011-12-01T05:18:00.000Z	pangolin	Foxhoundz	file a bug on launchpad.net
