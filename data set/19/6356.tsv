2008-02-01T21:22:00.000Z	csb0		(this is probably a dumb question, but that can't be helped.) i have just set up an ubuntu LAMP server. if critical patches for apache2 etc comes out, will my box be automatically patched? if not, what do i need to do to accomplish this?
2008-02-01T21:23:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	critical patches will be offered to you from the gutsy-security repo, make sure that it's enabled in the updates tab of system->admin->software sources
2008-02-01T21:23:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	thanks, but i only have ssh access. how do check that this is enabled (and if it isn'
2008-02-01T21:24:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list , remove the # from any line with gutsy-security in it
2008-02-01T21:24:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	thanks!
2008-02-01T21:26:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	just a final question to make sure i get this important part right: merely uncommenting that line will make sure patches are automatically installed once they are released? i don't have to run some update command with cron or somesuch?
2008-02-01T21:26:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	the default is offering, but you'd have to manually install the updates. You can change that to automatically updating apache2 from the security repo by editing /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
2008-02-01T21:28:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	um, I'm not sure if the server runs a regular check for updates automatically though.
2008-02-01T21:29:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	i don't have any 50unattended-upgrades file in that directory. i have 01autoremove, 01ubuntu, 05aptitude, and 70debconf
2008-02-01T21:29:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	what would be the command to check for updates, then? so i can put it as a cron job
2008-02-01T21:29:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	there's a package called unattended-upgrades (just found it) that's what you want
2008-02-01T21:32:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	i just installed it via aptitude. no idea if it works, but thanks. indeed it seems to be what i want
2008-02-01T21:34:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	if you look at that 50unattended-upgrades it will show you what's being done.  /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz  has the full options
2008-02-01T21:48:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	configure-index is empty and 50unattended-upgrades tell me nothing about how often this is run. is there any other way i can see this?
2008-02-01T21:53:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	looking
2008-02-01T22:00:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	I'm not real good at reading python but I *think* you need to add /usr/bin/unattended-upgrade to a cron. beware of this advice, check it out
2008-02-01T22:02:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	ok, thanks. for some reason there is very scant information on unattended-upgrade on the net.
2008-02-01T22:02:00.000Z	nickrud	csb0	not suprised really. I'd look on wiki.ubuntu.com for info, and in the bugs.launchpad.net database for inferential info
2008-02-01T22:09:00.000Z	csb0	nickrud	thanks. from just running /usr/bin/unattended-upgrade it doesn't seem like there's too many options you can give it. i think i'll stick it in a cron file and hope for the best.
