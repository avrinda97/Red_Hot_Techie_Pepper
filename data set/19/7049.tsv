2008-01-25T09:58:00.000Z	macogw	zcat[1]	unofficially, yes

2008-04-06T12:25:00.000Z	macogw	zcat[1]	and as bsd. osx uses one like GoboLinux
2008-04-06T12:25:00.000Z	zcat[1]	macogw	same basic layout, yeah..
2008-04-06T12:40:00.000Z	macogw	zcat[1]	like 90% of people dont know trackpoint's the right name.  but they know that slang name.
