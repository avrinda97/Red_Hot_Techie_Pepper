2006-01-12T10:51:00.000Z	Vivaldi		hello
2006-01-12T10:52:00.000Z	Vivaldi		how much time has passed since the last version of ubuntu went out?
2006-01-12T10:52:00.000Z	Vivaldi		is there any other newer famous distribution?
2006-01-12T10:53:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	5.10 stands for year 2005 month 10 release
2006-01-12T10:54:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	root password is not set in ubuntu. you need to use sudo instead
2006-01-18T16:01:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	I didn't use expert install. what you explain sounds odd though
2006-01-18T16:03:00.000Z	Vivaldi	mwe	yeah, it's odd.. this is why i am here
2006-01-18T16:04:00.000Z	Vivaldi	mwe	try an expert installation and try to add packages trhough a graphical tool.
2006-01-18T16:04:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	I'm not questioning what you're experiencing. just wondering too
2006-01-18T16:05:00.000Z	Vivaldi	mwe	are you able to install packages through a graphical tool with your current installation?
2006-01-18T16:07:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	I didn't do the expert install
2006-01-18T16:07:00.000Z	Vivaldi	mwe	that's the point i guess.. but please answer to my question
2006-01-18T16:08:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	I didn't do expert install. the gui tools work fine
2006-01-18T16:09:00.000Z	Vivaldi	mwe	ok you say they work fine. i suppose they ask for a password..right?
2006-01-18T16:09:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	yeah. the user password
2006-01-18T16:09:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	if the user is in the admin group or it wont work
2006-01-18T16:10:00.000Z	Vivaldi	mwe	you did anything by yourself to add yuour user to the admin group?
2006-01-18T16:11:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	the default user is in the group already
2006-01-18T16:11:00.000Z	mwe	Vivaldi	you'll probably need to fix sudoers as far as I can tell though
