2010-02-25T04:00:00.000Z	bombel		(My OS: Ubuntu 9.10 ) Hi everyone. Does anyone know the answer for this issue? I get it when I try to extract a concrete .zip file. By the way, this zip file was generated in windows. http://pastebin.com/zGNXFER8
2010-02-25T04:01:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	   to 'this' issue?   which one?
2010-02-25T04:06:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	   to 'this' issue?   which one?
2010-02-25T04:06:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	the issue is: When I try to extract the file I get an error. Normaly it doesn't happen. I believe this is happening because it was generated in windows - just a guess
2010-02-25T04:07:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	here is the issue: http://pastebin.com/b5zRKdva
2010-02-25T04:07:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	   shouldn't matter, .zip is a standard enough format these days, I've made .zip in windows and they work elsewhere
2010-02-25T04:08:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	  tried running ark for it?
2010-02-25T04:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	   what that message means, is that the .zip file is not a stand-alone-archive  rather than a spanned archive, meaning one off many.... like .rar makes say   file01.rar file02.rar  and such, when  you have several 'spanned' .zips like file01.zip file02.zip  ... usually you start with the last one, and the last one 'threads' the rest to unzip the whole set
2010-02-25T04:11:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	   the same applies to .rar ones too, you start with the last 'spanned' one
2010-02-25T04:12:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	  try opening with 'Ark' to see if it prompts you for the other 'files'
2010-02-25T04:14:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	ark does not work either
2010-02-25T04:16:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	   run file on the file, to see what it says -> file ola.zip
2010-02-25T04:19:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	this is the output of $file ola.zip -> ola.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
2010-02-25T04:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	    and I assume 'tar -zxvf ola.zip' isn't working either?
2010-02-25T04:22:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	this is the output of tar: -> http://pastebin.com/AaHy42xk
2010-02-25T04:24:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	  then it might be the way it was 'zipped'   I  know some archivers have some exotic options   like using 64bit blocks or    custom blocks and other compression options which aren't standard
2010-02-25T04:31:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	I thought the problem could be the name of the file, so I changed it to a more simple one: ola.zip
2010-02-25T04:36:00.000Z	Typos_King	bombel	  it opens[sorta] in PeaZip, it shows a blank content, and when tried to Extract, it prompts me for a password
2010-02-25T04:38:00.000Z	bombel	Typos_King	I dont understand why it would ask for a password. But It will be solved dor sure, soon.
