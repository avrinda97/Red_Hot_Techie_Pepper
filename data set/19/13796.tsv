2005-01-28T11:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	thenuke	apt-get install manpages ought to work

2005-05-24T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	thenuke	xmms works fine here. have you installed the required mp3 decoder library?
2005-05-24T12:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	thenuke	however, i use rhythmbox ('Music player') to play mp3s
2005-05-24T12:01:00.000Z	thenuke	HappyFool	yes, I followed ubuntuguide.org and installed every codec there was suggested
