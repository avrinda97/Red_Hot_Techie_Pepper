2007-10-14T06:30:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i've localized that this file does indeed exist! /media/disk-1/boot/grub/stage1
2007-10-14T06:30:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		but when i write "find / media/disk-1/boot/grub/stage1" from the grub prompt it says "File not found" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2007-10-14T06:31:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		pleeeeez enlight me what the F*CK is going on
2007-10-14T06:32:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i've only got one ext3 partition besides the swap
2007-10-14T06:33:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		it appears to be /dev/sda from the gnome partition manager
2007-10-14T06:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		sorry, correction here, it's /dev/sda2
2007-10-14T06:34:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	That will never work as you haven't even loaded the kernel yet at that stage
2007-10-14T06:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i've running the ubuntu live cd
2007-10-14T06:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		that's supposed to be able to restore grub right
2007-10-14T06:36:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	You need to load the rescue image on the install disk and then mount your root file system and then chroot it to / and then you can re install grub from there
2007-10-14T06:37:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	mechdave	would that be as simple as "mount /dev/sda2 /"?
2007-10-14T06:37:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	No, your rescue image should automatically mount your file system on /mnt/sysimage (I think)
2007-10-14T06:38:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	mechdave	i do indeed have access to my old filesystem on /dev/sda2 where it is visible in /media/disk-1
2007-10-14T06:39:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	You have got the rescue image up already?
2007-10-14T06:42:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	No rescue disk on my dvd either!!
2007-10-14T06:43:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	what is the error you get when you try and boot Grub?
2007-10-14T06:50:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	Try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows and I think the heading that is the most use to you would be https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2007-10-14T06:51:00.000Z	mechdave	Bo^Dick	Oops!! Try this heading --> Using the Desktop/LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader
