2010-01-23T23:36:00.000Z	Wipster		if I am making a livecd and I need to run a customised kernel do I need to build it in the chroot or elsewhere? my cd size ends up huge
2010-01-23T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	custom kernels are not supported
2010-01-23T23:37:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	yeh I know but is that how you would build it? its the process I'm having issue with
2010-01-23T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	within the chrooot
2010-01-23T23:39:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	ok thanks is there a way I can aptitude purge all modules installed to be able to compile the kernel once its done? or will I have to write them all down?
2010-01-23T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	remove them manually
2010-01-23T23:40:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	ouch - ok thanks for your help I'l see how I get on
2010-01-23T23:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	sorry
2012-05-10T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	why is a usb key looking at a pxe config ?
2012-05-10T15:19:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	doing a disk self check before I attempt to install
2012-05-10T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	ok, so don't worry about pxeconfig as your not using pxe
2012-05-10T15:22:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	as the self check fails on that package how do I know the rest is fine? Will this problem be corrected in the next ico packing?
2012-05-10T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	no idea what you're talking about "next iso packaging", if the iso verify's the md5sum you should be fine
2012-05-10T15:23:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	but it fails its self test which is worrying
2012-05-10T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	depends what that self test is checking for, you're using the netboot option, I'm not sure how well that CD is put tgother
2012-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Wipster	either way, you're not using the pxeboot stuff, so you shouldn't have a problem
2012-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	ok cheers, shall just go for it then
2012-05-10T15:54:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	apparently there is a problem with the base-packages the installer fails
2012-05-10T15:55:00.000Z	Wipster	ikonia	this is with the standard ubuntu-12.04-server-i386 image
