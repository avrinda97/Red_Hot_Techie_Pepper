2010-02-19T05:57:00.000Z	Rtk		@tim, 3 dongle worked great for me.
2010-02-19T05:59:00.000Z	Rtk		Remove the package via Synaptic, then install the old one.
2010-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	Rtk		dns.*****
2010-02-19T06:00:00.000Z	Rtk		Such as?
2010-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	Rtk		It's every 6 months they release, hence why it's always .04 or .10
2010-02-19T06:03:00.000Z	Rtk		Do not remove ubuntu desktop, seriously.
2010-02-19T06:05:00.000Z	Rtk		I'm not sure. What if you didn't mark for removal instead of complete removal?
2010-02-19T06:06:00.000Z	Rtk		What program is it?
2010-02-19T06:08:00.000Z	Rtk		Did you burn the contents of the .iso or the .iso file?
2010-02-19T06:09:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	no i did not burn it yet. just tested with vb
2010-02-19T06:08:00.000Z	Rtk	teage	any errors?
2010-02-19T06:08:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	no errors, just says "no bootable media found"
2010-02-19T06:09:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	i checked the files compaired to a iso all ready made and there identical
2010-02-19T06:10:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	ubuntu 9.10 and i made the iso file using k3b
2010-02-19T06:12:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	really? i will try brasero. btw, interesting enough i thought maybe i did something wrong in making the livecd, so just as a test i extracted an already made iso to a file and remade the iso and still, same problem
2010-02-19T06:14:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	i know, i made a customized version, really the only thing different is the casper files
2010-02-19T06:15:00.000Z	Rtk	teage	Well, I don't think I can help, sorry.  I've never done what you're trying to do.
2010-02-19T06:17:00.000Z	teage	Rtk	thats ok, i have done this with windows using imageburn. i will see if i can run imageburn under wine and maybe problem solved
