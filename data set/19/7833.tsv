2007-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	rockets		IceCrew, ruby, python, c?
2007-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	rockets		IceCrew, well if you plan to submit packages to ubuntu, canonical prefers you submit python based packages
2007-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	IceLink	rockets	is python difficult?
2007-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	rockets		IceCrew, not nearly as difficult as C
2007-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	rockets		IceCrew, and in that case you just need the pythong gtk bindings
2007-07-24T16:45:00.000Z	IceLink	rockets	and you should give up call me IceCrew, one day he'll beat you up
