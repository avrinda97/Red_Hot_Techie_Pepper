2006-11-13T12:22:00.000Z	wd		Flannel because i had a bad experiance with linux, so i deleted partition, on reboot i got grub error, couldn't start windowsxp. after reinstall, i learned to use fix /mbr  or fdisk /mbr, which sometimes didn't work, just want to keep security blanket..
2006-11-13T12:23:00.000Z	tom47	wd	security blankets are one ting ... the'windows-as-a-virus" is probably anything but :D
2006-11-19T08:03:00.000Z	tom47	wd	a little while back i did
2006-11-19T08:04:00.000Z	wd	tom47	hey thanks for the answer, i want to use conky and gdesklet, but it's saying i need lm sensors, is diff. to install or activate, in windows (oops curse word) it's just a simple prog. i'm trying to show off my linxu box to unbelievers.
2006-11-19T08:06:00.000Z	tom47	wd	have only used lm sensors in linux
2006-11-19T08:06:00.000Z	wd	tom47	yes i would like to also, what r ur thoughts on lm sensors? is it diff to install for linux?
2006-11-19T08:07:00.000Z	tom47	wd	i never found it hard to install .... the setting up can be a bit tricky and you need to spend some time on it but is always seemed REASONABLT straightforward
2006-11-19T08:08:00.000Z	wd	tom47	what's involved?
2006-11-19T08:08:00.000Z	tom47	wd	install it with apt-get, or more easily, synaptic
2006-11-19T08:09:00.000Z	wd	tom47	it's in our distro? oh duh.. lol   i thought i had to do some serious kernel moding or something.
