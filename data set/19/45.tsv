2012-11-10T02:22:00.000Z	sneakyimp_		I have a question about what appears to be a bug.  Is it customary to chit-chat before asking a question?
2012-11-10T02:24:00.000Z	sneakyimp_		i've asked it twice already which is why i ask again.  I just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 (which I believe is Unity).  Previously, hitting Alt-Tab allowed me to cycle through my open windows.  It still seems to do so, but occasionally it results in all of my menus disappearing (including the launcher) and I must logout/login in order to get the menus back.  Until I do, I cannot launch, move, or...
2012-11-10T02:24:00.000Z	sneakyimp_		...close any windows.  Is this a "feature" or is it a bug?
2012-11-10T02:25:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	any reason you haven't upgraded to 12.04 or 12.10?
2012-11-10T02:26:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	 the OS has not prompted me to do so -- also, I am reluctant because I'm running a variety of systems for software development and dread the prospect of these systems failing after a major version upgrade
2012-11-10T02:27:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	but you said you just upgraded to 11.10
2012-11-10T02:27:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	I cannot afford the downtime should Eclipse stop working, for instance
2012-11-10T02:27:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	I did -- and am regretting it as we speak
2012-11-10T02:27:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	anyway, I don't use unity, but my understanding is that many improvements were made in 12.04 (and presumably in 12.10 as well)
2012-11-10T02:28:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	if I were in your shoes, I'd go to 12.04.  It's LTS and, like I said, I seem to recall people claiming many improvements to unity
2012-11-10T02:29:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	 ok i suppose I must then.  As I mentioned before, the OS has not yet prompted me -- how to initiate this?  Also, is 12.10 not LTS?  that's a bit confusing.
2012-11-10T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	I think shuttleworth's blog post speaks about what basically happens
2012-11-10T02:48:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	 he doesn't address what sort of information is shared: "We are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Donâ€™t trust us? Erm, we have root. You do trust us with your data already. You trust us not to screw up on your machine with every update. You trust Debian, and you trust a large swathe of the open source...
2012-11-10T02:48:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	he dodges the question
2012-11-10T02:50:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	i don't like the lack of transparency.  anything we can do to find out more?  i.e., does removing the lens stop the tracking? this sounds obtrusive to me.
2012-11-10T02:50:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	what "tracking"?
2012-11-10T02:50:00.000Z	sneakyimp_	jrib	exactly my question
2012-11-10T02:50:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	I'm not aware of any tracking
2012-11-10T02:51:00.000Z	jrib	sneakyimp_	there's also a toggle in the settings that disables all lenses that access the internet iirc
