2008-03-10T18:37:00.000Z	lunaphyte_		from what i've read, for released versions, apt-get dist-upgrade generally consists of only security updates - is that right?
2008-03-10T18:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	no
2008-03-10T18:40:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	i've read that - i didn't see anything regarding my question.  i've read the individual upgrade pages too, but apt-get dist-upgrade isn't for upgrading between versions, is it?
2008-03-10T18:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	yes
2008-03-10T18:43:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	it is?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FeistyUpgrades says to use some program called do-release-upgrade.
2008-03-10T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	apt-get dist-upgrade - upgrades the entire system to a newer release.   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto    What version are you running now
2008-03-10T18:47:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	hmm, weird.  i just did apt-get dist-upgrade on a server that's been running 6.10 for close to a year without any updates, and i was surprised to see how little it updated.  running lsb_release -a after doing that still shows edgy/6.10
2008-03-10T18:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	It is easier on the newer release
2008-03-10T18:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	Did you chage sources to feisty from edgy?
2008-03-10T18:49:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	no, i haven't - i was wondering about that, but nothing i read seemed to indicate i should do that.  i was expecting that maybe do-release-upgrade included that step as part of whatever it does.
2008-03-10T18:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	I need to look at the upgrade pages...  gimme a sec..  or 10
2008-03-10T18:50:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	no worries - much appreciated.
2008-03-10T18:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	sudo apt-get install update-manager-core && sudo do-release-upgrade                         is the way I read it for your setup
2008-03-10T18:57:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	thanks.
2008-03-14T16:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	that gutsy was not our gutsy.. must be one of the variations
2008-03-14T16:29:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	it was on official install disc from ubuntu.com
2008-03-14T16:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	If you were surprised that it installed lilo then you obiviously did not specifically tell it to setup lilo.. was it the alternate cd?
2008-03-14T16:31:00.000Z	lunaphyte_	Jack_Sparrow	no, the regular one.  i'm looking at the iso file sitting on my computer - the file name is ubuntu-7.10-server-i386.
2008-03-14T16:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lunaphyte_	server is the key...   grub is the default for livecd desktop...  server has both available  last time I checked
