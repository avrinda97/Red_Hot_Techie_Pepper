2006-01-17T16:19:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	that's a non harmful ubuntu bug
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	ubuntu scripts are broken as they try to use setkeycodes exx 256 and 255 is the highest allowed number
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: so my problem doesn't have to do anything with this as it seems right?
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	I don't think so
2006-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: thanks
2006-01-17T16:24:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	is your layout broken in X or the console?
2006-01-18T06:03:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	so just fix it at every boot :)
2006-01-18T06:03:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: reinstalling X at every boot?
2006-01-18T06:04:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	yeah
2006-01-18T06:04:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	why would you reintall X to fix keyboard layout?
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	wish I knew why
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	you mean the layout in X I take it then
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: yeah and in KDE
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: setxkbmap command is for both
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	in kde it can be fixed in kcontrol
2006-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	mwe	hawking	for X in general xorg.conf
2006-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: not if setxkbmap is working
2006-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	hawking	mwe	: both fails then
