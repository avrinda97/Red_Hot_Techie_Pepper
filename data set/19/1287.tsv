2011-06-09T05:44:00.000Z	Skaperen		well, it seems that Ubuntu downloads updates during install even if I don't check the box to allow that (I never do)
2011-06-09T05:44:00.000Z	Skaperen		but the bad part about it is that it is loading a bad video driver
2011-06-09T05:45:00.000Z	Skaperen		if I unplug the network while installing, I get a system that works fine ... except the unity won't run ... don't care about that
2011-06-09T05:45:00.000Z	Skaperen		but if the network is plugged in, it changes the video driver from nouveau (which works) to nvidia (which is broken)
2011-06-09T05:46:00.000Z	mrdeb	Skaperen	leave cable unplugged in install, then later intsall the driver
2011-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	why ... the driver is bad
2011-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	I need to avoid installing it ... I guess that means I need to avoid upgrades
2011-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	mrdeb	Skaperen	what is wrong with the driver and which ubuntu are you using
2011-06-09T05:48:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	11.04 amd64 ... the bad driver (nvidia) results in major bit splatter over the video display
2011-06-09T05:48:00.000Z	mrdeb	Skaperen	oh ok. how about installing from nvidia
2011-06-09T05:48:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	if I install w/o network, I get "nouveau" instead of "nvidia" ... nourveau works fine
2011-06-09T05:50:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	I want to run with the nouveau driver because it works
2011-06-09T05:50:00.000Z	mrdeb	Skaperen	ok, so use it for now and dont installn nvidia
2011-06-09T05:50:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	is there a way to configure video to always stay with that driver even if I upgrade the system?
2011-06-09T05:51:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	one guy at work at the same issue ... he does upgrades about every day and got nailed with a bad driver
2011-06-09T05:51:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	to avoid getting the bad driver, something has to be set to make it not happen
2011-06-09T05:51:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	or else I can't do any upgrades at all
2011-06-09T05:52:00.000Z	Skaperen	mrdeb	but I'm not sure how to do that because it's a different package, not just a different version
2011-06-09T05:52:00.000Z	mrdeb	Skaperen	there must be a way to configure apt to avoid installing the driver update. try in synaptic settings also?
