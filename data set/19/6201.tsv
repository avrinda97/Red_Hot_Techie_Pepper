2008-03-16T08:27:00.000Z	tux97		i was wondering can u edit a startup file for this os to put a command so it can start my wifi when the puter is turned on?
2008-03-16T08:27:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	are you using ndiswrapper?
2008-03-16T08:28:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	do you have to modprobe ndiswrapper each time you boot?
2008-03-16T08:28:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	ok.. just a sec
2008-03-16T08:30:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	on the commandline type "sudo nano /etc/init.d/boot.local" and enter your password, then at the end of the file type "modprobe ndiswrapper" then hit ctrl-x and save changes. reboot, and it should work
2008-03-16T08:32:00.000Z	tux97	bluewraith	nothing in the file yet is it only suppose to be for this only command?
2008-03-16T08:32:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	hrm.... hang on a sec then. lemme see if i can remember where i put it on mine.
2008-03-16T08:35:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	ah... now i remember. the file is "/etc/modules" sorry about that. you should see fuse, lp, and sbp2 in there as well. key in "ndiswrapper" to the end of that file and save, and it will work
2008-03-16T08:35:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	the boot.local was for suse... :/
2008-03-16T08:36:00.000Z	tux97	bluewraith	what do i need to edit?
2008-03-16T08:37:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	"sudo nano /etc/modules" and add ndiswrapper to the end of the file
2008-03-16T08:38:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=537132  thats where i got that information from
2008-03-16T08:39:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	did you save a copy of it?
2008-03-16T08:40:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	"cd etc" and then "sudo rm -i boot.local" should do the trick
2008-03-16T08:41:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	"cd etc/init.d", sorry
2008-03-16T08:43:00.000Z	tux97	bluewraith	ty
2008-03-16T08:45:00.000Z	tux97	bluewraith	thank you so much
2008-03-16T08:46:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	not a problem. it was fairly fresh in my memory, as i had to do the same thing to get this laptop running earlier today. (only mine was a lil more difficult, as I was building up from server without a wired connection)
2008-03-16T08:47:00.000Z	bluewraith	tux97	no need to be sorry. I like breaking things and fixing them. heheh   see ya
