2006-06-27T08:50:00.000Z	bina		Hi, i have /dev/hdb1 mounting to /Downloads, /Downloads is 755 and i own it and am in its group.  I still can't write to the drive though.  I tried putting uid=1000 in the fstab options but that was a bad option aparrently
2006-06-27T08:50:00.000Z	bina		the drives ext3
2006-06-27T08:51:00.000Z	Cas	bina	what is the line in fstab?
2006-06-27T08:51:00.000Z	bina	Cas	/dev/hdb1       /Downloads              ext3    defaults,user   0       1
2006-06-27T08:52:00.000Z	Cas	bina	you don't need user because that's only if you want a user to mount it, it should work tough
2006-06-27T08:53:00.000Z	bina	Cas	ok. hmm
2006-06-27T08:53:00.000Z	Cas	bina	no errors if you mount it?
2006-06-27T08:53:00.000Z	bina	Cas	ill try remounting it see what happens
2006-06-27T08:53:00.000Z	bina	Cas	no, only with that uid option
2006-06-27T08:56:00.000Z	bina	Cas	its odd, "/dev/hdb1 on /Downloads type ext3 (rw)" is whatwhat "mount -v /Downloads" says
2006-06-27T08:57:00.000Z	Cas	bina	can root write in it? `sudo touch /Downloads/file`
2006-06-27T08:57:00.000Z	bina	Cas	yeah
2006-06-27T09:01:00.000Z	Cas	bina	vmware is not an emulator, it's a virtual machine
2006-06-27T09:01:00.000Z	Cas	bina	any luck with 777?
2006-06-27T09:02:00.000Z	bina	Cas	oh right :)
2006-06-27T09:02:00.000Z	bina	Cas	nope, nowt :)
2006-06-27T09:04:00.000Z	bina	Cas	thanks to you too :)
2006-06-27T09:05:00.000Z	Cas	bina	you can umount the drive and see if you can write there then, if not, you can't have the permissions right.
2006-06-27T09:05:00.000Z	bina	Cas	didnt have the permissions i thought i did
