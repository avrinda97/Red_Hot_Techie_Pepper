2010-01-06T08:36:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	 have you tried renaming the session file and logging out and back in?
2010-01-06T08:42:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	click "Run"
2010-01-06T08:48:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	try hitting alt + f2 and typing metacity --replace
2010-01-06T08:48:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	then reboot
2010-01-06T08:52:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	you could try installing fusion-icon then make sure you are using the correct window manager and decorator by right clickng the icon
2010-01-06T08:57:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	after it's done installing you can run it by typeing fusion-icon.  You'll probably also want to add it to your start up applications.  System>Preferences>Startup applications.

2010-01-06T09:53:00.000Z	EastDallas	Ilmatic	When you need help search ubuntuforums.org.  I'm no command line Ninja, but I've learned a ton about CLI from making changes as instructed in the forums.
