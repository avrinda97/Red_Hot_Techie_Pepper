2011-12-29T17:24:00.000Z	Guest87522		hello
2011-12-29T17:25:00.000Z	Guest87522		need some help
2011-12-29T17:26:00.000Z	Guest87522		I am having trouble removing ubuntu 11.10 from my compaq presario cq61 and installing windows xp
2011-12-29T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	so you want rid of ubuntu? How did you install ubuntu?
2011-12-29T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	then use the install CD to remove the partitions you made, its part of the XP installation process
2011-12-29T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	then how do you intend to install XP without the XP CD?
2011-12-29T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	you don't need the ubuntu one, the partitions are standard so the XP CD can remove them
2011-12-29T17:30:00.000Z	Guest87522	ActionParsnip	when I boot from the xp cd I get nothing but a black screen
2011-12-29T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	I suggest you ask in ##windows for taht
2011-12-29T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	windows isn't supported here, your windows CD boot issue will be helped in ##windows
2011-12-29T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	i dunno a lot of people are mixing on open source now

2011-12-29T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	sure, you can delete the partitions there as long as they are not mounted
2011-12-29T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	gparted can also unmount partitions if you right click them
2011-12-29T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	are you booting to liveCD or liveUSB?
2011-12-29T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	make sure you are manipulating the right device, not the live usb
2011-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	its part of the standard live environment
2011-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	if you run:  sudo fdisk -l     you will see all partitions, you can now verify your internal drive is /dev/sda
2011-12-29T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest87522	you need the live cd, you cannot format the data used to run the OS, think about it
