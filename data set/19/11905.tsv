2006-01-03T13:09:00.000Z	bread		every so often, my ubuntu 5.10 (using gnome) Xorg will crash
2006-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	bread		and i can only use the computer by sshing in and restarting gdm/killing Xorg or rebooting the puter
2006-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	bread		there are no errors in ~/.xsession-errors, none in Xorg.0.log and none in gdm.log :(
2006-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	bread		anyone have any idea what it happens?
2006-01-03T13:10:00.000Z	bread		when i run top, Xorg which has supposedly crashed is using 99% of the cpu
