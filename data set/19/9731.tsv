2008-06-23T11:43:00.000Z	nubuntu		god, i don't know whats happening to my computer.  now i have no more panels as of today when i turnd it on... i figured out how to go in thru the filesystem to usr/bin to find programs, but what a pain.  all this started when i tried to upgrade my video card driver for an installation of google earth.  anyone else having such a prob?
2008-06-23T11:43:00.000Z	nubuntu		my screen resolution is all goofy too, i don't really know what it is rendering at, but it ain't very high i can say.
2008-06-23T11:44:00.000Z	wols_	nubuntu	what videocard do you have exactly?
2008-06-23T11:44:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	tnt2 i believe
2008-06-23T11:44:00.000Z	wols_	nubuntu	don't "believe", it's not an article of faith. CHECK instead
2008-06-23T11:45:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	i checked, the system detects tnt2,  i say i bilieve, cause i wasn't sure if it was accurate
2008-06-23T11:46:00.000Z	wols_	nubuntu	pastebin your lspci output
2008-06-23T11:47:00.000Z	wols_	nubuntu	if you have a cli you already have a terminal...
2008-06-23T11:49:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	any idea where i find the terminal in the filesystem?  its not listed as terminal in usr/bin ... ?
2008-06-23T11:50:00.000Z	wols_	nubuntu	you said you are starting the programs via terminal. so you already have one
2008-06-23T11:52:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	no, i said i was launching by clicking on the filesystem icon on the desktop
2008-06-23T11:59:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	i can't copy/paste from the xterm apparently, but the output says : vga compat controller: nvidia NV%M^$ (RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro)(Rev 15)
2008-06-23T12:02:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	that's NV5M64

2008-06-23T12:12:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	you still here?
2008-06-23T12:19:00.000Z	nubuntu	wols_	you still here, i don't know i think i was knocked off, everything just reset on chatzilla
