2011-08-29T00:11:00.000Z	Shimotsukei		I was wondering if anyone would be able to assist me with recovering of a hdd, a friend told me to run a live cd but didnt explain much in the way of programs for recovering it
2011-08-29T00:13:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	When the hard disk has phaysical errors, I'd advise making a clone copy of it first before mounting anything.
2011-08-29T00:15:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	I'd do the following: Boot a live CD (ubuntu or even better: something like grml.org), run ddrescue to another device (external hd, for example), then try to mount any file systems on the image or run tools like testdisk to recover some files ...
2011-08-29T00:16:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	Detect what?
2011-08-29T00:35:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	Again, the device is shown by "fdisk -l"?
2011-08-29T00:36:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	What does "blkid <device>" look like?
2011-08-29T00:38:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	Replace <device> with the actual device name, without the <> brackets.
2011-08-29T00:40:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	The same terminal you ran "fdisk -l" in. o_O
2011-08-29T00:43:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	If blkid doesn't find anything then no valid file system (header) was found on the disk.
2011-08-29T00:44:00.000Z	Shimotsukei	vlt	 i think i failed at trying to run it >.>
2011-08-29T00:44:00.000Z	Shimotsukei	vlt	yeah it doesnt show up
2011-08-29T00:45:00.000Z	Shimotsukei	vlt	 is there a way to fix that?
2011-08-29T00:47:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	I don't know whether there are tools that are able to restore file system (tables, headers or whatever). But I know that tools like testdisk and foremost will try to find anythink that looks like data files on the disk.
2011-08-29T00:48:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	*anything
2011-08-29T00:48:00.000Z	Shimotsukei	vlt	 well my files are all there, now i need to figure out how to get them
2011-08-29T00:49:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	Where are they?
2011-08-29T00:51:00.000Z	Shimotsukei	vlt	 is there a way to move the data off?
2011-08-29T00:52:00.000Z	vlt	Shimotsukei	There must be a testdisk option to tell it where to save the restored files.
2011-08-29T00:57:00.000Z	Shimotsukei	vlt	 trying to find it
