2008-11-18T06:01:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	you dont understand, i have been at this networking issue for 9 nights, its due to network manager, I just need someone who understands how it works
2008-11-18T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	No harm in asking your question, pastebin it if you don't want to keep typing an explanation over and over
2008-11-18T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	What is your question about network-manager? I am by no means an expert but I do know a bit about it
2008-11-18T06:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	Network manager 0.7 should support multiple devices being active at once, Is the gigabit connection static or is one host providing DHCP ?
2008-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	the gigabit is static, the wlan is dhcp. the gigabit is crossover
2008-11-18T06:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	Are both set to connect automatically?
2008-11-18T06:23:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	yes they are, ofcourse the eth0 connects first because it doesnt need to get an ip from the dhcp
2008-11-18T06:24:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	i think if the wlan connected first then i would be ok... but thats not the only problem... when my lease runs out on the wlan Ip NM will rewrite my routing table and /etc/resolv.conf as if the wlan isnt there
2008-11-18T06:24:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	this causes me to loose internet
2008-11-18T06:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	Are you setting up the routs within network-manager?
2008-11-18T06:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	Seems like a bug to me, have you filed a bug report?
2008-11-18T06:28:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	dont know how, I posted that post in ubuntu forums and I emailed the network manager mailing list
2008-11-18T06:30:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	what should I even call this bug?
2008-11-18T06:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	Like someone suggested in the forum one work around might to be to set up the main box's ethernet connection as "shared"
2008-11-18T06:30:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	they each need to have internet
2008-11-18T06:31:00.000Z	storrgie	Jordan_U	they run independently quite a bit of the time
2008-11-18T06:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	You might ask in #ubuntu-bugs for advice on how to word the bug report
2011-11-29T00:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	storrgie	Rather than switching away from GPT, why not just create a BIOS Boot Partition?
