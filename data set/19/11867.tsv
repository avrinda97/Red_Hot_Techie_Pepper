2006-05-29T13:42:00.000Z	jrsims		shit. how do I uninstall nvidia-glx packages if all I have is a command line?
2006-05-29T13:42:00.000Z	jrsims		great
2006-05-29T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	apt-get remove [whatever] 
2006-05-29T15:48:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	why not just wait?  and no.
2006-05-29T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	nah, just upgrade.  It's fine.
2006-05-29T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	as long as you haven't installed anything without going through apt/(whatever frontend), you're good
2006-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	of course, it is still beta software.  So, you may wish to hold off until it's finalized.
2006-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	I did install the proprietary nvidia driver
2006-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	through the repositories?
2006-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	no, I downloaded it fron nvidia's site
2006-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	oh, why not just use the one in the repositories?
2006-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	it was giving me problems
2006-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	fair enough.  How did you install it?
2006-05-29T15:55:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	had to also install make, gcc 3.4, the kernel source tree, and then the install compiled a kernel module from that.
2006-06-01T07:52:00.000Z	Flannel	jrsims	does gnome safe mode work?
2006-06-01T07:52:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	hmm. have not tried!
2006-06-01T07:53:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	I get GDM, and login works, then it tries to open gnome and I get just a mouse pointer and the background color. I can move the mouse, but nothing else loads.
2006-06-01T07:54:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	k. back in a bit!
2006-06-01T08:05:00.000Z	jrsims	Flannel	ok, I tried logging in in safe mode, still no go. Doesn't work for root either.
