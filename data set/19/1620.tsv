2011-04-03T19:10:00.000Z	DrPoO		I'm trying to ssh into my desktop with my correct username/password but I am getting a "Failed password for invalid user...." in my /var/log/auth.log. Any ideas?
2011-04-03T19:12:00.000Z	bonjoyee	DrPoO	are you using the proper "ssh username@ipaddress" format? or just "ssh ipaddress"?
2011-04-03T19:12:00.000Z	DrPoO	bonjoyee	for either case it failes
2011-04-03T19:12:00.000Z	DrPoO	bonjoyee	however i am able to login to my computer locally, its ssh the problem
2011-04-03T19:13:00.000Z	DrPoO	bonjoyee	its also happens for all users on the computer... not just mine
2011-04-03T19:14:00.000Z	bonjoyee	DrPoO	can you connect to ssh on that machine using "ssh user@localhost"?
