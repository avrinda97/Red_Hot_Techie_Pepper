2005-06-17T15:39:00.000Z	tkiesel		Does anyone know how to link two mono channels together in Gnome Volume Control?
2005-06-17T15:39:00.000Z	sobersabre	tkiesel	i think you should use jackd
2005-06-17T15:40:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	JACK will allow me to do that, and have a nice little volume slider desktop widget?
2005-06-17T15:41:00.000Z	sobersabre	tkiesel	i don't about nice/not nice. you will be able to do whatever you want. route audio etc. with realtime scheduling.
2005-06-17T15:42:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	*nods*  I've got jack going for Ardour and such. Maybe I'll have that be my default even during casual listening.
2005-06-17T15:43:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	The only need for the linked channels was to make on the fly adjusts easier during my casual listening time. Right now, with my M-Audio Delta 410, left and right of the stereo mix have separate volumes. Heehee.
2005-06-17T15:44:00.000Z	sobersabre	tkiesel	 you use delta 410 ? :)
2005-06-17T15:44:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	Yep. Just installed it a few days ago.
2005-06-17T15:44:00.000Z	sobersabre		why don't u use native ice24 mixer ?
2005-06-17T15:44:00.000Z	sobersabre		there's something ... i don't remember the app name... look at alsa site
2005-06-17T15:45:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	Dropped it in, and it started working without a hitch. Just some issues with ESD adn ALSA not playing nice with each other, but I think that's a general Hoary issue.
2005-06-17T15:45:00.000Z	sobersabre		they've got a nice app to control delta etc. cards... i don't rememeber it is envy or ice
2005-06-17T15:45:00.000Z	tkiesel		I remember seeing the kernel module on the ALSA site, but not a mixer app.
2005-06-17T15:46:00.000Z	sobersabre	tkiesel	what is your audio settings for gstreamer ?
2005-06-17T15:46:00.000Z	sobersabre		split...
2005-06-17T15:46:00.000Z	sobersabre	tkiesel	you've here, right ?
2005-06-17T15:46:00.000Z	sobersabre		i mean you're
2005-06-17T15:46:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	That I am.
2005-06-17T15:46:00.000Z	tkiesel	sobersabre	For gstreamer? I don't know. Don't think I ever messed with them.
