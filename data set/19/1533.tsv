2010-12-31T22:38:00.000Z	findeds		hi ilovefairuz, I've been using Ubuntu 3 days from now. Can you give me some advise? :)
2010-12-31T22:39:00.000Z	findeds		I'm really confused in switching from Windows..
2010-12-31T22:40:00.000Z	findeds		Windows is BIG, a ton of applications..I switched to Linux bcoz I'd red a lot of blogs saying this is a better OS to use for programming
2010-12-31T22:40:00.000Z	findeds		sorry for the bad english, not my 1st language
2010-12-31T22:42:00.000Z	findeds		I'm looking for a better computer programming environment..
2010-12-31T22:42:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	findeds	learn to use the shell (bash) .. it will help a lot
2010-12-31T22:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	findeds	ubottu is a bot, not a real human
2010-12-31T22:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	findeds	you can use tab for autocompleting nicks (names) on IRC
2010-12-31T22:50:00.000Z	findeds	ilovefairuz	how?
2010-12-31T22:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	findeds	type the first few letters of the name and press tab
2010-12-31T22:54:00.000Z	findeds	ilovefairuz	ah ok..when I type the first letter does not autocomplete, It must be at least twice.hehe
2010-12-31T22:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	findeds	just enough letters to get to a specific nick
2010-12-31T22:55:00.000Z	findeds	ilovefairuz	thanks :)
