2007-07-14T16:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	you can use tune2fs from a live disk
2007-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	that's what I was gonna do but I was worried about the system not booting
2007-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	read the man page for tune2fs, it explains how to go about it
2007-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	no, can't do it on read only
2007-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	probably a good idea to go into single-user mode?
2007-07-14T16:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	no, use a live disk.
2007-07-14T16:54:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	why the hell would I wanna do that?
2007-07-14T16:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	because otherwise you end up with a .journal file in / ; immutable, but why not hide it completely?
2007-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	you're right, just read the man, apparently e2fsck must be run from a rescue floppy (or live disc) in order for the inode to be placed.
2007-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	there's an interesting paragraph there, the last one under -j.
2007-07-14T16:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	not sure I'd trust it, I'm paranoid
2007-07-14T16:57:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	so do tune2fs and e2fsck from a live cd and reboot?
2007-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	yes. back when ext3 got stable, that's how I switched
2007-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	so it's as simple as those two commands? just make sure that the fs is mounted r/w
2007-07-14T16:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	leave the partition unmounted
2007-07-14T16:59:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	alright, thanks for your help. didn't wanna do it wrong.
2007-07-14T16:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	np.
2007-07-14T05:00:00.000Z	Josie1	nickrud	just for good measure, the Kubuntu live cd should have both of these right? if it doesn't what a shitty livecd
2007-07-14T05:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Josie1	I'd say that'd be a good description :)
