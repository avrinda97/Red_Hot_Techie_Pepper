2006-03-23T10:04:00.000Z	slink		how am i supposed to edit anything with a black screen
2006-03-23T10:04:00.000Z	sline_crecature		hmm...good question
2006-03-23T10:04:00.000Z	sline_crecature		did you setup telnet or ssh on it?
2006-03-23T10:05:00.000Z	sline_crecature		or you can ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a terminal
2006-03-23T10:05:00.000Z	sline_crecature	slink	if you only messed with your xorg the text terminals should still work
