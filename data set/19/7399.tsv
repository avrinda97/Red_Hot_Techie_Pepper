2007-10-12T10:06:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	cheers 4 the headsup
2007-10-12T10:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito	np
2007-10-12T10:09:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	is there any livedisc with that on?
2007-10-12T10:09:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	it won't install as dpkg fails to open package
2007-10-12T10:09:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito	sudo apt-get install testdisk??
2007-10-12T10:10:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	thats what I did :0|
2007-10-12T10:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito	are u running off livecd? what was your error output
2007-10-12T10:11:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	had to manually run a load of fsck's during boot time recently after system crashes.  plus my drive goes into read-only mode?!
2007-10-12T10:11:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	not a livecd
2007-10-12T10:11:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	i wondered if there was a livecd with testdisk already on
2007-10-12T10:12:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	I'm 99.9% sure my disk is f**k*d
2007-10-12T10:12:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito	im not sure about a livecd with testdisk already on it
2007-10-12T10:13:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	don't think I need the confirmation now as I'm resigned to the fact I need a new HDD & Power Supply
2007-10-12T10:14:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito	you can test for bad sectors with any windows disk too i believe
2007-10-12T10:14:00.000Z	Evanlec	keito	might also wanna try super grub disk
2007-10-12T10:15:00.000Z	keito	Evanlec	I think its the power supply that is knackering these disk's as this is the 3rd one in 1 year (though one got sent back and returned which is probably the same one zero-filled and sent back to me)
