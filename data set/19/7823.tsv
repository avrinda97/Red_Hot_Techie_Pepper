2007-06-24T06:02:00.000Z	rabidweezle		how can I create a launcher to launch a url in firefox?
2007-06-24T06:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	set the command to : firefox <url>
2007-06-24T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	Looks like you can just drag the URL bar to the desktop also
2008-12-27T15:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	You should file a bug report, it's obviously a memory leak
2010-06-06T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	What GFX card?
2010-06-06T10:42:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	 Nvidia 8200M G laptop
2010-06-06T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	Well, easiest way to get a full resolution framebuffer is to uninstall the proprietary drivers then. But I assume you want to keep 3D acceleration :)
2010-06-06T10:43:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	I had a working terminal until I set the console to 1024x768 in the ubuntu control center app (UCC)
2010-06-06T10:44:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	exactly
2010-06-06T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	I rarely trust third party configuration scripts like UCC.
2010-06-06T10:48:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	you know how I can "default" the framebuffer mode back to the old?
2010-06-06T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	Can you pastebin your /etc/default/grub and your /boot/grub/grub.cfg to try to figure out what it did?
2010-06-06T10:49:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	sure one moment
2010-06-06T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	Remove the "vga=791" from line 10
2010-06-06T10:52:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	should I just remove the entire line?
2010-06-06T10:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	You can, but the line is there by default, (to make it easy to see how to add kernel parameters)
2010-06-06T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	Yes
2010-06-06T10:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rabidweezle	You're welcome.
2010-06-06T11:05:00.000Z	rabidweezle	Jordan_U	glad to see my console again =)
