2010-01-07T11:57:00.000Z	Xfact		why people gives 'LTS' much priority.... now I am feeling like LTS is nothing but a simple old version of ubuntu!!!!
2010-01-07T11:57:00.000Z	Xfact		I am talking about hardy
2010-01-07T11:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	the LTS versions are designed to be more stable and last longer
2010-01-07T11:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	not to have the newest of everything
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	they are only supported officially for 18 months
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	the LTS releases are supported for 3 years (5 years for servers)
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	and the regular releases are more likely to get mahjor changes that break things
2010-01-07T12:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	I would recommend 9.04 over 9.10
2010-01-07T12:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	it is more stable
2010-01-07T12:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	and I have heard of many issues in 9.10
2010-01-07T12:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	alternatively, if you want something that is always up to date without needing to upgrade every 6 months, consider a "rolling relase" distribution such as arch, gentoo, or debian unstable
2010-01-07T12:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	I was using 8.03
2010-01-07T12:06:00.000Z	Xfact	lstarnes	 you were...or you still use 8.04?
2010-01-07T12:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	I was using it
2010-01-07T12:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	but I switched to arch a couple weeks ago
2010-01-07T12:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	why not?
2010-01-07T12:07:00.000Z	Xfact	lstarnes	 it's doesn't support many progs and it's like 'unstable' to me :(
2010-01-07T12:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	Xfact	how is it being unstable?
2010-01-07T12:08:00.000Z	Xfact	lstarnes	 like, after installation...some program is no working or closing unexpectedly in middle of usage... etc...
