2005-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	sorush20	kuraia	you don't have to type my name everytime you can just type a little of my name and press tab then that will fill out the rest of the name..
2005-12-11T07:11:00.000Z	sorush20	kuraia	I think you can use the sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server command and change the setting of your monitor
2005-12-11T07:11:00.000Z	sorush20	kuraia	are you using kde?
