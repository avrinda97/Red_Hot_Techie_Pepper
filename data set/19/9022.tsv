2007-01-04T16:27:00.000Z	linux_kid	eitan2	go to system->administartion->shared folders then click "add" and it should prompt you if you want to use samba or unix file sharing.  if you choose samba, it will install itself
2007-01-04T16:29:00.000Z	eitan2	linux_kid	it doesn't ask... it just defaults to nfs and doesn't let me add samba
2007-01-04T16:29:00.000Z	linux_kid	eitan2	hold on, ill find somthing...
2007-01-04T16:31:00.000Z	linux_kid	eitan2	http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/installing-samba.html ...that should walk you through the whole process!
2007-01-04T16:32:00.000Z	eitan2	linux_kid	I already did that... samba is installed and has been installed... it just doesn't give me a choice of that in the shared folder settings
