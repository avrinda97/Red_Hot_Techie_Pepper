2011-05-19T01:14:00.000Z	escott	bfig	can you drag and resize windows?
2011-05-19T01:14:00.000Z	bfig	escott	nope :(
2011-05-19T01:15:00.000Z	escott	bfig	do you have the window decorations (the border you would use for dragging or are they missing?)
2011-05-19T01:16:00.000Z	bfig	escott	i have the down-right corner, and the scrollbar. other than that no
2011-05-19T01:16:00.000Z	bfig	escott	for the terminals they don't have a menu bar
2011-05-19T01:16:00.000Z	escott	bfig	compiz isn't working then, was it working before?
2011-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	bfig	escott	yes... till i manually opened and force-closed unity with ctrlc
2011-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	escott	bfig	or at least compiz is partially working (because alt-f2 is working) but compiz isn't doing its job as a window manager
2011-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	bfig	escott	i attribute this to a massive key misconfiguration, that's why i wanted it to go back to factory settings
2011-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	escott	bfig	i would nuke your .compiz directory then
2011-05-19T01:19:00.000Z	bfig	escott	if i make it explode, will it reconfigure everything automagically?
2011-05-19T01:19:00.000Z	escott	bfig	yes, those folders will be recreated
2011-05-19T01:19:00.000Z	bfig	escott	where can i find this? home folder?
2011-05-19T01:20:00.000Z	escott	bfig	yes there is ~/.compiz as well as ~/.config/compiz and ~/.config/compiz-1
2011-05-19T01:21:00.000Z	escott	bfig	you will only lose whatever customizations you may have made. if they are extensive then it may be worth being more discrete
2011-05-19T01:21:00.000Z	escott	bfig	the gconf folders control assorted application customization, so i would remove it as a last resort
2011-05-19T01:23:00.000Z	escott	bfig	it will make those folders again with the default contents
2011-05-19T01:29:00.000Z	bfig	escott	yigal, windows haven't returned :|
2011-12-04T04:04:00.000Z	escott	bfig	im not sure you can change an existing one, but you can just create a new one with usb-creator-gtk
