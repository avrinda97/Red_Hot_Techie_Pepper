2005-08-31T14:41:00.000Z	cyphase		anyone know of a web based ssh system that i can install on my server?
2005-08-31T14:42:00.000Z	spola	cyphase	web based ssh ??? what excactly do you want cause this makes little sense to me
2005-08-31T14:42:00.000Z	cyphase	spola	a web based client i can install on a server that will let me log onto ssh
2005-08-31T14:44:00.000Z	spola	cyphase	i think you'll want to google for a java applet
2005-08-31T14:45:00.000Z	cyphase	spola	i was looking for something besides a java applet..
2005-08-31T14:46:00.000Z	spola	cyphase	hmm that would be pretty cool but i haven't heard of any of those ... i'd have a hard time believing some kid hasn't hacked it together on ruby on rails tho
2005-08-31T14:47:00.000Z	cyphase	spola	i would do it, but i don't have the time :(
2005-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	cyphase	spola	1.0.2 is kinda old..
2005-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	cyphase	spola	are you on warty?
2005-09-29T06:18:00.000Z	cyphase	spola	good luck
