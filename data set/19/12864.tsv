2005-06-24T10:50:00.000Z	brett	chombee	from what I've read in the forums, the default ndiswrapper should work for that card.
2005-06-24T10:52:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- what do you mean? that doesn't seem to match with the nidswrapper instructions on the site, explain?
2005-06-24T10:52:00.000Z	brett	chombee	the instructions are written for specific .inf file, but you can substitute the proper .inf for your driver
2005-06-24T10:53:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- so what is the procedure?
2005-06-24T10:54:00.000Z	brett	chombee	Instructions here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25683 but substitute in the proper .inf file name for your driver.
2005-06-24T10:55:00.000Z	brett	chombee	if that doesn't work, you'll need to compile ndiswrapper from source.  But compiling from source will prevent you from installing updates to the linux-image package
2005-06-24T10:56:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- hmm... thanks
2005-06-24T12:09:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- how do I find the correct .inf file for my wireless card?
2005-06-24T12:30:00.000Z	brett	chombee	did you `sudo modprobe ndiswrapper'?
2005-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- yeah, and it gives that message, operation not permitted
2005-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	brett	chombee	apparently it's not uncommon.  But I really don't know why that happens
2005-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- a google search reveals a few people who've had it, but no solution. Does anyone know about modprobe ndiswrapper 'giving operation not permitted'?
2005-06-24T12:47:00.000Z	brett	chombee	have you tried running everything (carefully) thru a root-terminal?
2005-06-24T12:47:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- why? I was using sudo?
2005-06-24T12:48:00.000Z	brett	chombee	just a thought is all ;] 
2005-06-24T12:51:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- tried, same result
2005-06-24T12:52:00.000Z	brett	chombee	it causes problems later on with updating linux-image (kernel) packages, but you may need to compile ndiswrapper from source
2005-06-24T12:54:00.000Z	chombee	brett	- I'm going to try another card, D-Link DWL-650+, it is detected at wlan0 but seems unsupported, ifup does not activate it
2005-06-24T12:56:00.000Z	brett	chombee	good luck to you!
