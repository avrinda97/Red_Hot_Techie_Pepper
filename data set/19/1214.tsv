2011-05-22T05:53:00.000Z	Nintet		anyone here know about clustering?
2011-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	do exist different kind of clustering
2011-05-22T05:56:00.000Z	Nintet	pmo5	if i set up a cluster will it speed up apps other than mpi apps?
2011-05-22T05:57:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	no, if you cluster with mpi..
2011-05-22T05:57:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	only applications making use of mpi, will benefits from clustering..
2011-05-22T05:58:00.000Z	Nintet	pmo5	so basically if i need to speed up DraftSight there is no way to run that as an mpi app?
2011-05-22T06:00:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	mpi // message passing that is the way you make use of the whole potential of your cluster.. if Dark.. doesn't make use of mpi.. hence it will not scale..
2011-05-22T06:01:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	there is different kind of cluster.. some make use of mpi, others work differently.. but for all, there good work to do on all your computers to make them work together..
2011-05-22T06:02:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	to tell you most application as i know, doesnt make use of mpi.. usually people making use of mpi / clustering.. reprogram their own application to make use of mpi..
2011-05-22T06:04:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	hence you will need to build another kind of cluster..
2011-05-22T06:04:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	Dark.. is a windows program ?
2011-05-22T06:06:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	i don't know your program.. i don't know Dark.. maybe there is a release adapted to clusters.. with mpi or sometghing else
2011-05-22T06:06:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	or working on very specific machines.. far more powerfull then a PC..
2011-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	cloud computing / high bandwidth
2011-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	your engineers make use of mpi to use Dark.. ?
2011-05-22T06:19:00.000Z	Nintet	pmo5	no they generate impossible to edit cad files
2011-05-22T06:21:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	other clusters can be of help.. if your application forks..
2011-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	Nintet	pmo5	what other clusters are there?
2011-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	pmo5	Nintet	plenty.. long time since i looked.. Mosix
