2007-04-16T05:44:00.000Z	kofler		I have a dual-boot setup on ~30 clients. These machines can be booted into either Windows or Linux. I want them all to update Ubuntu at a specific time, but in case the computers are either off or not booted into Ubuntu, how would I get apt to smartly grab the packages?
2007-04-16T05:44:00.000Z	kofler		Is there a program that does that already or must I write a script to hack it up?
2007-04-16T05:45:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	probably write a script and put it in anacron
2007-04-16T05:49:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	There isn't a program that already does this?
2007-04-16T05:49:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	I'd imagine there are a lot of other sysadmins out there that don't like the idea of hacking up scripts on their machines.
2007-04-16T05:50:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	anacron is a program that does it
2007-04-16T05:50:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	hacking up a script? the script could be one line long, you don't even necessarily need a script, just put the command in anacron
2007-04-16T05:51:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	Well, I want all the machines up-to-date. Windows does this already, so why can't Linux.
2007-04-16T05:52:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	it does, it is called the update-manager
2007-04-16T05:54:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	Do you understand what I'm trying to do? Am I being clear? I need all the clients to be all equally updated. If thsi is to be automated, I can't be running a GUI without a *severe* hack.
2007-04-16T05:55:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	if adding an entry to cron is a severe hack for you, perhaps you ought to resign and save your employer from the incompetence he employs
2007-04-16T05:56:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	It's not merely a matter of adding a cron line. You don't get it. I need to update all the machines with all the same packages. I want a homogenous environment at all times.
2007-04-16T05:56:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	Also, please reserve the flames for /dev/null
2007-04-16T05:56:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	so long as they have the same repositories, simply cronning up apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade will do
2007-04-16T05:57:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	No, if the machine isn't booted into Linux when the cron is supposed to run, the machine won't get updated properly.
2007-04-16T05:57:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	Unless you're proposing * * * * * updating, which is ridiculous.
2007-04-16T05:57:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	hence anacron, scrolls up for the 5 times already mentioned
2007-04-16T05:57:00.000Z	kofler	bruenig	How does anacron help? Cron in general doesn't help.
2007-04-16T05:58:00.000Z	bruenig	kofler	"man anacron"
