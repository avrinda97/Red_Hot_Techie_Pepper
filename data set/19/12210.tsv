2006-03-29T10:18:00.000Z	michael__		My network speed seems to be capped at ~300k, I tried another NIC, already disabled ipv6. Nothing helps. I read a couple of posts about probs with the new 2.6 kernel so i upgraded to dapper, no help. Can anyone help me?
2006-03-29T10:20:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	what kind of network are you connected to, and how?
2006-03-29T10:21:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	i am on my home netwerk, using a router. Any other machine in the house has normal connection speeds. It's a wired 100mbit full duplex connection
2006-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	is it a PCI NIC?
2006-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	yes, a 3com. Also tried a realtek
2006-03-29T10:23:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	are you using CAT5 cable? Tried switching that?
2006-03-29T10:23:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	dmesg sais that it loaded:  3Com PCI 3c905C
2006-03-29T10:23:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	it's cat5 cable, but there is also no packet loss
2006-03-29T10:24:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	is it connected to the same point as the machines that have normal speed?
2006-03-29T10:26:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	every othermachine in the house uses wireless... they outperform wired at the moment
2006-03-29T10:27:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	what's at the other end of the patch cable?
2006-03-29T10:28:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	at the other end there is a drayteck vigor 2600G router.
2006-03-29T10:28:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	so that shouldn't normally give any problems
2006-03-29T10:28:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	have you tried connecting another machine to that router via a cable?
2006-03-29T10:29:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	i will try that now
2006-03-29T10:30:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	thanx so far btw. I am going to test the same cable using my notebook. So i'm going offline from this machine. I'll be back in a couple of mins
2008-07-29T19:25:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	i had it installed, and then how should config the php.ini file. I only find info about it on windows, but not on linux.
2008-07-29T19:26:00.000Z	soundray	michael__	have a look at /usr/share/doc/php5-sqlite3
2008-07-29T19:26:00.000Z	michael__	soundray	skarface: I'll have a try first. Thank you.
