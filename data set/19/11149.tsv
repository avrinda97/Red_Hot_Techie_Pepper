2006-03-22T07:46:00.000Z	katarot		okay please help me  i have connected my laptop directly to my modem and yet still no internet
2006-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	DSL modem?  Actiontec from Qwest?
2006-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	is it an Actiontec or not?  Who is your broadband provider?  Qwest?
2006-03-22T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	the reason I ask is that its DHCP server doesn't properly set dns servers, so you have to prepend or supersede them in the dhcp client config files
2006-03-22T07:50:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	how would i do that
2006-03-22T07:52:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	well, we're not sure that's your problem yet, but you'd edit your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf (man dhclient for details)
2006-03-22T07:53:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	i set it up in network so does that not mean that i should work
2006-03-22T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	you can setup a network, and still not have DNS configured properly
2006-03-22T07:55:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	how do i know what to change
2006-03-22T07:56:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	we need to figure out if DNS is the problem before you try to change anything
2006-03-22T08:01:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	how would i know if dns  is the problem
2006-03-22T08:02:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	can you please describe the problem in more detail?
2006-03-22T08:06:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	that is exactly what i do
2006-03-22T08:06:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	doesn't your DSL model have a dhcp server?
2006-03-22T08:08:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	i will go and boot up ubuntu and try it with dhcp
2006-03-22T08:19:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	:)
2006-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	build a new kernel for what?
2006-03-24T15:16:00.000Z	katarot	tritium	emm to get a native driver for ubuntu
2006-03-24T15:18:00.000Z	tritium	katarot	which driver?
