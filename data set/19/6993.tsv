2011-01-24T06:31:00.000Z	nucc1		how do i get awstats viewable in a browser?
2011-01-24T06:32:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	go to http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/awstats.pl
2011-01-24T06:32:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	like thanks. how did you get that info?
2011-01-24T06:33:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	i use awstats on my server
2011-01-24T06:33:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	like where is the config located? so i can change the location :)
2011-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	now i have permission issues, it can't access the log in /var/log/apache2
2011-01-24T06:35:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	oh if you're using apache2, make sure you change in /etc/awstats/awstats.conf the LogFormat= line to be LogFormat=1
2011-01-24T06:37:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	that's done, but do you have any suggestion as to what to do aabout the permission issue?
2011-01-24T06:37:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	looking
2011-01-24T06:38:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	my /var/log/apache2/access.log is permissions 640 root:adm
2011-01-24T06:39:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	adm is a group you created yourself?
2011-01-24T06:39:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	no
2011-01-24T06:39:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	hmmm, mine is the same permissions too.
2011-01-24T06:42:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	i'll just change the file to world-readable
2011-01-24T06:50:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	what does a "visit" mean? pardon me :)
2011-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	someone coming to your site. each site visit may involve one or more page views
2011-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	ok, so it's just a unique IP address?
2011-01-24T06:51:00.000Z	maco	nucc1	yep, though i suppose with a timeout since return visitors are also measured
2011-01-24T06:52:00.000Z	nucc1	maco	thanks.
