2008-04-06T01:50:00.000Z	blahblahx		I have made my own distro based off ubuntu 7.10. when you run the test iso, ubiquity seems to act funny. if you choose a language other than english to install with, then after install you get the error "language failed with exit code 127". However, the language is installed and works, just I can't figure out why the error pops up. What does it mean?

2008-04-06T01:53:00.000Z	binarical-app	blahblahx	maybe if you could tell us a bit more about the problem.....
2008-04-06T01:53:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	my distro is very similar to ubuntu, just basically some different software and settings. but this is an ubiquity problem
2008-04-06T01:53:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	what else do you wanna know?
2008-04-06T01:53:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	i wasnt sure how specific to be initially
2008-04-06T01:54:00.000Z	binarical-app	blahblahx	why dont you give a shot at searching the specific errors you see popping up in google
2008-04-06T01:54:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	done already. no results of any use.
2008-04-06T01:54:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	the error i get is what i said, its not more specific than that
2008-04-06T01:55:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	thats all it says, but it still works
2008-04-06T01:55:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	if you knew anyway to make ubiquity shut up with the errors, that would solve the problem
2008-04-06T01:56:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	the only problem is the error, it doesnt actually cause anything elser
2008-04-06T01:56:00.000Z	binarical-app	blahblahx	one moment please
2008-04-06T01:56:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	okay wanna join the ubuntu installer channel and we can talk there about this? less traffic there, so it will be easier
2008-04-06T01:56:00.000Z	binarical-app	blahblahx	nice post man
2008-04-06T01:58:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	so you wanna go to the #ubuntu-installer channel?
2008-04-06T01:58:00.000Z	binarical-app	blahblahx	im there
2008-04-06T01:58:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	alrighty im leaving this channel
2008-04-10T03:32:00.000Z	blahblahx	binarical-app	i figured out what was causing it, which is why im asking this new question. i had added a special folder in an effort to make the ubiquity release notes change, and according to the syslog was causing the problem (i think)
