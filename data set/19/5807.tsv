2009-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	juanbond		when creating partitions, do most people just allocate their hd and set the mount point to / ?  or are there any recommendations?
2009-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	do you plan on dual booting or doing separate homes?
2009-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	*separate home folder
2009-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	juanbond	iMatter	yes, i suppose dual (multiple boot) would be ideal ... advantages to separate home directories?
2009-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	when you need a fresh install, or something happens to your Ubuntu you just reinstall to the "/" partition
2009-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	juanbond	iMatter	probably have a WindowsXP and Windows7 boot.  Then virtual machine everything else
2009-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	yep, a partition for "/home"
2009-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	meaning you can install new non-official upgrades to ubuntu or a new OS that supports /home entirely and not mess with your data in your /home making it pain free
2009-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	maybe 4-10GB
2009-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	 a fresh Jaunty install is like 2-3GB itself
2009-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	juanbond	iMatter	I have a 1TB drive so be conservative?
2009-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	O.o, 10GB should be enough if not you can always resize it, also yes make partition for your Windows7 and Vista and XP
2009-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	maybe 15-20GB then
2009-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	juanbond	iMatter	I'll make it 50GB :)
2009-07-18T08:25:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	i highly doubt you'll use that much for "/" but ok :P
2009-07-18T08:25:00.000Z	juanbond	iMatter	I guess in my case, disk space is cheap, so use whatever i can.....
2009-07-18T08:30:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	i doubt it but they'll tell you that you do need one just make it like 1GB
2009-07-18T08:34:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	your help
2009-07-18T08:34:00.000Z	iMatter	juanbond	err your welcome
