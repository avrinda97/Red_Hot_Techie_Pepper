2008-03-16T04:13:00.000Z	amenado		scone-> nVidia for ethernet? those are normally video chips..are you sure?
2008-03-16T04:15:00.000Z	amenado		soneil-> is it really? sad if they cant make it work though
2008-03-16T04:16:00.000Z	amenado		scone-> can you paste your /etc/network/interfaces file and ifconfig; and route -n  in pastebin please
2008-03-16T04:18:00.000Z	scone	amenado	I'm using wifi right now so the route table won't be acurate for my ethernet

2008-03-16T04:25:00.000Z	scone	amenado	only one I cut off was the ifconfig, i'll output all of it
2008-03-16T04:27:00.000Z	scone	amenado	everytime I restart and ubuntu increments my eth up one. The only work around I found was to change it in the interfaces everytime i restart
2008-03-16T04:30:00.000Z	scone	amenado	> right now I am connected via wireless using madwifi drivers. I believe that's where the ath0 comes from but i'm not positive.
2008-03-16T04:31:00.000Z	scone	amenado	> Ethernet wise I plug straight into my modem, nothing else on the network.
2008-03-16T04:32:00.000Z	scone	amenado	> yeah it does
2008-03-16T04:40:00.000Z	scone	amenado	> am I right to that auto eth0 should come before the iface line?
2008-03-16T04:43:00.000Z	scone	amenado	may I open a Private chat with you?

2008-03-16T04:48:00.000Z	scone	amenado	> kill by just typing kill and that address?
2008-03-16T04:51:00.000Z	scone	amenado	> I got the same output, do i kill /var/run/dhcdbd.pid or /var/run/dhclient.eth0.pid
2008-03-16T04:52:00.000Z	scone	amenado	I just killed that because it's the one you said haha
