2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	rikkimaru		is there a way I can run lucid on a vm on top of karmic?
2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	Yes... it's called VirtualBox
2010-06-12T05:40:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	fat32 filesystem?
2010-06-12T05:45:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	is there a way to restore the partition table?
2010-06-12T05:45:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	it only shows 512 kB in windows, when the card is 4GB
2010-06-12T05:47:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	FAT32 has tendency to mess-up free space... run scandisk on it (from windows)
2010-06-12T05:57:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	scandisk ended instantly and seemingly did nothing. Now when i open the drive and let windows format it says "Unknown capacity" and still fails
2010-06-12T05:58:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	do you know which filesystem is on sd card?
2010-06-12T05:58:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	i partitioned it and put quite a few on it
2010-06-12T05:58:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	and then ran mkntfs on one of them
2010-06-12T05:59:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	hm, and gparded sees all paritions?
2010-06-12T05:59:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	it did until i mkntfs'd
2010-06-12T06:00:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	I think that killed other partitions... not sure though
2010-06-12T06:00:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	is there a way to tell if the card is broken or just formatted incorrectly?
2010-06-12T06:01:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	anything important on the card?
2010-06-12T06:01:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	nope
2010-06-12T06:01:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	then just erase everything and try making new paritions...
2010-06-12T06:02:00.000Z	rikkimaru	MeanEYE	how do i "erase everything", when i open it in fdisk it shows 512Kb total with 0 partitions
2010-06-12T06:05:00.000Z	MeanEYE	rikkimaru	there's a mkfs.vfat command...
