2008-06-11T00:20:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	is that an ExpressCard?
2008-06-11T00:20:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	what do you mean?
2008-06-11T00:21:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	it's a normal laptop intel wireless card :)
2008-06-11T00:21:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	I mean, are you on a laptop?
2008-06-11T00:21:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	yes
2008-06-11T00:21:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	and is it inbuilt or a card?
2008-06-11T00:21:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	inbuilt, it's an hp pavilion dv1000
2008-06-11T00:22:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	ah OK I thought you may have had the same issues I had with an ExpressCard
2008-06-11T00:22:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	presumably you've searched for installation guides regarding linux on a dv1000?
2008-06-11T00:22:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	so.. ?
2008-06-11T00:22:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	things worked on ubuntu 7.10 but not on ubuntu 8.04
2008-06-11T00:22:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	I was thinking if it was the same error I had, I could help. But now maybe not
2008-06-11T00:23:00.000Z	andrewboktor	wiijii	okay, thank you
2008-06-11T00:23:00.000Z	wiijii	andrewboktor	sorry I can't help more
