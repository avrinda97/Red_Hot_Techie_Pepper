2012-08-19T11:48:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Internal error? Oh, there's an option to submit a report. I'll do that…
2012-08-19T11:48:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Precise is no longer under development. Huh? Oh, there's a convenient “I don't know what to do” option.
2012-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Link to a website…
2012-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Hmm.
2012-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Why doesn't it just submit a bug report like OS X does? 6_9
2012-08-19T11:50:00.000Z	Moonlightning		I don't really want to go to a website and follow through a bunch of stuff…
2012-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Anyway, I have a few problems here still.
2012-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	Moonlightning		1. display is borked. Not sure how to describe it, but the /entire/ thing looks like the wallpaper in http://cl.ly/IqDo .
2012-08-19T11:53:00.000Z	Moonlightning		2. I'm always typing `Linux nomodeset` at the yaboot prompt, and I'd like to know how to automate that.
2012-08-19T11:54:00.000Z	Moonlightning		3. The system beep in tty's is /really/ loud, and I'd like to turn its volume down.
2012-08-19T11:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Moonlightning	yaboot is a OS am I right?
2012-08-19T11:55:00.000Z	Moonlightning	wilee-nilee	no, the OS is Ubuntu.
2012-08-19T11:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Moonlightning	ah oh well nomodeset is easy in grub, lol.
2012-08-20T22:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Moonlightning	yes if the drive has a OS and a bootloader.
2012-08-20T22:53:00.000Z	Moonlightning	wilee-nilee	yes if the /disc/ in the drive has an OS and a bootloader?
2012-08-20T22:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Moonlightning	can you explain more what exactly your trying to do.
2012-08-20T22:55:00.000Z	Moonlightning	wilee-nilee	install Ubuntu from a CD|DVD. The computer in question has a broken internal (optical) disc drive, though, so...
2012-08-20T22:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Moonlightning	use a usb.
2012-08-20T22:55:00.000Z	Moonlightning	wilee-nilee	might not have one. We'll check, though.
