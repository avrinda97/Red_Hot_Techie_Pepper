2008-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	Kalamansi		hello guys is it okay to use my isp's dns to my pc2? my pc1 is my server ubuntu acting as my gateway. i dont have a router.. ubuntu is my router server..
2008-01-15T16:28:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Yes, it is.
2008-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	Kalamansi	lmnts	what if someone will make fun with my dns? like they will dos or whatever term they call that.. putting your isp's dns is totaly okay? i will not dc especially my server?
2008-01-15T16:35:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Dont worry about it. Unless you are making trouble for other ppl, they wont bother to DoS your machine.
2008-01-15T16:43:00.000Z	Kalamansi	lmnts	no other way?
2008-01-15T16:43:00.000Z	Kalamansi	lmnts	how about you will set a proxy to the firefox and IE? im not sure if its possible
2008-01-15T16:44:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	What do you mean? You have two choices, either use your own DNS or your ISP's. Dont worry about DoS.
2008-01-15T16:44:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Of course that's possible. But you need a proxy somewhere to connect to.
2008-01-15T16:44:00.000Z	Kalamansi	lmnts	how to use my own dns?
2008-01-15T16:46:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Uhm, you configure your machine to use your own DNS. That is /etc/resolv.conf.
2008-01-15T16:47:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	I don't know everything, no idea. :)
2008-01-15T16:48:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Sure. That's what it's there for.
2008-01-15T17:03:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Ok, now... there is no such thing as a "fake" DNS.
2008-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	192.168.5.0 would be your network address, and not a specific machine. That will not work.
2008-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Changing your resolv.conf will not mess up the installation in any way. Just change back if it doesnt work.
2008-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	Use the nameserver that your ISP provides for you.
2008-01-15T16:58:00.000Z	lmnts	Kalamansi	This has nothing to do with scripting. Assigning a non-existant (fake?) DNS is possible, but you will only be able to communicate with the internet using IP addresses and not names. www.hotmail.com for example is not accessible, since the computer cannot look up the IP of the name.

2008-01-15T17:06:00.000Z	Kalamansi	lmnts	ikonia : pvh_sa|wrk: i tried to change my resolv.conf like for example my isp's dns is 12.34.234.12 .. i change it to 192.168.5.0 and i use it to pc2 workstation and the result is failed.. pc2 cannot connect to internet if i use 192.168.5.0 dns.. but if i use the dns of my isp i pc2 can connect to internet... how to setup a fake dns to resolv.conf?
