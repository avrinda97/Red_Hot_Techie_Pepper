2011-04-08T05:41:00.000Z	doomrobo		Do Macbook Pros have good 64-bit support?
2011-04-08T05:42:00.000Z	doomrobo		Because I have a Core i7 with 8GB RAM and I have a 32 bit installation with pae
2011-04-08T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	64 bit support is just as good for Ubuntu on a macbook pro as it is for Ubuntu on any other 64 bit PC.
2011-04-08T05:44:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	but there are many programs that aren't available for 64-bit machines
2011-04-08T05:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	There are very few programs available for 32 bit Ubuntu which are not available for 64 bit Ubuntu.
2011-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	last time, I couldn't even get firefox to work on 64-bit. Has that really changed so much within a year?
2011-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	In what way did firefox not work?
2011-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	Mozilla had no official 64-bit Firefox port
2011-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	Firefox is installed by default in Ubuntu.
2011-04-08T05:50:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	I forgot
2011-04-08T05:50:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	but that wasn't all, there were plenty of programs I could get working
2011-04-08T05:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	And Ubuntu has been shipping 64 bit firefox with 64 bit Ubuntu since the very first release of Ubuntu in 2005.
2011-04-08T05:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	Like?
2011-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	On a Macbook Pro you'll need to use the +mac iso image to be able to boot from the install CD. Looking for a link to it now.
2011-04-08T05:52:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	only for 64-bit?
2011-04-08T05:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	Correct. Because only the 64 bit iso has EFI support, which causes problems with Apple's firmware. The +mac image has EFI support removed.
2011-04-08T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/10.10/release/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso or if you don't want the Desktop CD use any of the other +mac images from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/10.10/release/.
2011-04-08T05:56:00.000Z	doomrobo	Jordan_U	thank you very much
2011-04-08T05:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	doomrobo	You're welcome.
