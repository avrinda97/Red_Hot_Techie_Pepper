2007-12-18T12:17:00.000Z	b0rsuk		I'm doing it by zcat > boot.img.gz > /dev/sdf1
2007-12-18T12:17:00.000Z	b0rsuk		The USB drive is 2GB and formatted to fat16
2007-12-18T12:17:00.000Z	b0rsuk		As soon as I copy stuff with zcat , it strangely becomes 16MB and I can't fit the .iso on it !
2007-12-18T12:18:00.000Z	b0rsuk		Anyone ?
2007-12-18T12:19:00.000Z	b0rsuk		It has only 1 partition , /dev/sdf1 .
2007-12-18T12:19:00.000Z	b0rsuk		Before doing zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sdf1 , the partition is 2.0GB big
2007-12-18T12:19:00.000Z	b0rsuk		after doing zcat, it magically becomes 16MB
2007-12-18T12:20:00.000Z	b0rsuk		I did it this way with Debian before, and it worked. And I'm following a guide from help.ubuntu.com so there's no excuse for this to not work.

2007-12-18T12:20:00.000Z	WGGMk	b0rsuk	do you have a CruZer stick?
2007-12-18T12:21:00.000Z	WGGMk	b0rsuk	look at the stick
2007-12-18T12:21:00.000Z	b0rsuk	WGGMk	: Kingston
2007-12-18T12:22:00.000Z	WGGMk	b0rsuk	yea, ScanDisk makes them. I thought that maybe it had security on it like the CruZer
2007-12-18T12:23:00.000Z	b0rsuk	WGGMk	: And the moral of the story is ... ?
2007-12-18T12:24:00.000Z	WGGMk	b0rsuk	honestly dude if you are looking for help. you could start chillin out. The moral of the story is that CruZer disk's have a security on their filing system that doesnt allow certain things.. details im not sure of. but it shouldnt effect you in your case
2007-12-18T12:25:00.000Z	WGGMk	b0rsuk	no its not, thats why I just wanted to knwo what type of disk it was
2007-12-18T12:28:00.000Z	b0rsuk	WGGMk	: So let's assume the stick doesn't allow certain things. It is possible because earlier it didn't boot when I used another method . Could I brute-force just install Kubuntu on it  ?  Would that work ? I need to boot kubuntu NOT from cd, because I need to copy 1xcd  + 1xDVD to my Debian partition. For some reason Asus P5K SE motherboards have big problems detecting CDROm in linux.
2007-12-18T12:28:00.000Z	WGGMk	b0rsuk	you could try formatting the disk under Ubuntu with gparted
