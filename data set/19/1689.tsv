2011-02-18T02:14:00.000Z	GeekMan		right now im reading a page that talks about my computer and he was talking about checking the fan drivers (look under etc/rc.d/
2011-02-18T02:15:00.000Z	GeekMan		now i dont have a rc.d but i do have a rc.Sd which upon opening contains a files one such including sensors
2011-02-18T02:15:00.000Z	GeekMan		i want to see if my fan cuts on at the right time
2011-02-18T02:16:00.000Z	GeekMan		yea i havent seen it turn on yet and the laptop under heavy downloads will get hot
2011-02-18T02:16:00.000Z	GeekMan		no fan sounds
2011-02-18T02:17:00.000Z	GeekMan		you cant see the fan on my case so
2011-02-18T02:17:00.000Z	GeekMan		its a laptop
2011-02-18T02:19:00.000Z	guntbert	GeekMan	you could try in the bios setup - there are often options for power control/fan speed - just to check if you can hear it
2011-02-18T02:20:00.000Z	GeekMan		i hate to say this but its a powerpc and also i never been in the bios
2011-02-18T02:20:00.000Z	GeekMan		other than like a regualr desktop
2011-02-18T02:20:00.000Z	GeekMan		yea and i know about the ppc chat
2011-02-18T02:21:00.000Z	GeekMan		i figured there is a command you can invoke to test the fan
2011-02-18T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	GeekMan	those are rather hardware specific - so ...
2011-02-18T02:22:00.000Z	GeekMan	guntbert	i guessed it would have
2011-02-18T02:23:00.000Z	guntbert	GeekMan	so you might want to tell the channel what kind of notebook you are talking about
2011-02-18T02:24:00.000Z	GeekMan		#>_<# sry its a ibookg4 ... i use it for school work
2011-02-18T02:24:00.000Z	GeekMan		2003 model 12"
2011-02-18T02:25:00.000Z	GeekMan		any ways the site im reading is talking about install on slackware and he tells you a program to activate the fan anyways is slackware packages very diffrent to debian
2011-02-18T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	GeekMan	I suggest you put your question to the channel again, together with the hardware info (all in one line)
