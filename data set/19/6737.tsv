2007-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	Neodudeman		hullo ubuntu; I have a question: is there anyway I can access the network manager or the GDM manager from a terminal? I just recently got fluxbox, and now can't get back to gnome because the GDM theme i got doesn't have a session changer, for some reason.
2007-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	try NetworkManager
2007-12-14T06:30:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	that will start the network manager program
2007-12-14T06:31:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	doh. I didn't capitalize the N or M when i tried that command before. lol thanks
2007-12-14T06:31:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	your welcome
2007-12-14T07:13:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	you mean to change default GDM manager settings?
2007-12-14T07:13:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	oh hey. ya, if I could just default the GDM settings from terminal, that'd be great.
2007-12-14T07:14:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	what settings you need changed?
2007-12-14T07:15:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	i need it to go back to either the default session of xclient, or the default theme human
2007-12-14T07:16:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	hmm ok are you attempting to setup the default Gnome desktop from kde?
2007-12-14T07:18:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	right now I'm stuck in fluxbox, because I accidentally set it as my default session window manager in the GDM. When I log onto the GDM, I can't change the session back to gnome because the theme I installed doesn't have a session changer; so I would like to change the GDM all the way back to its original default settings
2007-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	sorry Neo i forgot so many things happening here
2007-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	it's ok, i guess. lol. I'll just wait
2007-12-14T07:23:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	wait, and keep googling that is
2007-12-14T07:24:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	I think I found it. sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm; I just changed it from kdm to gdm
2007-12-14T07:25:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	sorry i havent done it in so long im a long time gnome lover
2007-12-14T07:26:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	lol, after this; I think I may never leave either
2007-12-14T07:41:00.000Z	Neodudeman	jason_ubuntuislo	good news, I found the session menu in my theme; I just started mashing all of the buttons until something worked. and it did! so now back in gnome, and off to bed. Thanks for your help!
2007-12-14T07:41:00.000Z	jason_ubuntuislo	Neodudeman	he no problem i try
