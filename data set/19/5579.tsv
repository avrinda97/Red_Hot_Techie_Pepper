2008-10-09T15:53:00.000Z	bluebug_		Let me ask you a question.  I want to install rt73 wifi driver on Ubuntu Studio 8.04.  But when I install the driver, it bump into errors "make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.24-19-rt/build: No such file or directory.".  I already installed build-essentials and linux-headers-2.6.24.19-rt.  How should I install the driver on my realtime kernel?
2008-10-09T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	look at the error
2008-10-09T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	it's telling you what's wrong
2008-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	yes.  I can see the build folder on other generic kernels.  Just RT kernel has no build folder.
2008-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	make one ?
2008-10-09T15:57:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	make "module" folder by myself?
2008-10-09T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	the build folder
2008-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	I have another error now.  make[1]: Entering directory `/lib/modules/2.6.24-19-rt/build'
2008-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	look in the make file for the target module
2008-10-09T16:01:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	sorry, what do you mean by that?
2008-10-09T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	open the make file and look for the target "modules"
2008-10-09T16:06:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	yeah, I found the line about build folder in Makefile.  " KERNEL_SOURCES := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build".  but I don't know what it says....
2009-05-06T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	install the ubuntustudio package
2009-05-06T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	it's really that simple, it's a meta package that does all the work for you
2009-05-06T14:20:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	I tried to apt-get ubuntustudio-* packages but my computer still seems to use non rt kernel.
2009-05-06T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	it should install the rt kernel too
2009-05-06T14:21:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	ya, I installed it too. then I type "uname -r" in console and it said "2.6.28-11-generic"....
2009-05-06T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	bluebug_	you need to reboot - and select the rt kernel
2009-05-06T14:22:00.000Z	bluebug_	ikonia	thanks. I'll try to manage GRUB. :)
