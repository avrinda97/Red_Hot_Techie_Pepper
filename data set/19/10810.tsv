2007-02-25T17:22:00.000Z	dv_		hey
2007-02-25T17:23:00.000Z	dv_		is it possible to create an image of ubuntu? I am considering to set up edgy *once*, with all tweaks and settings,
2007-02-25T17:23:00.000Z	dv_		and then make an image of this fresh setup
2007-02-25T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	thats not a great idea
2007-02-25T17:24:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	why?
2007-02-25T17:24:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	the hardware wont change, its a laptop
2007-02-25T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	because that doesn't "install" ubuntu - it just copies data across
2007-02-25T17:25:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	which is exactly what I want
2007-02-25T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	but ubuntu won't be "installed"
2007-02-25T17:25:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	I want to be able to do a dd once with knoppix, and then everything is on the hd
2007-02-25T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	thats not a great way to install, but feel free to
2007-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	"a great way"? what does this mean?
2007-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	many companies do this
2007-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	not a good way
2007-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	again, why?
2007-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	if you feel strong about it - do it, don't ask about it
2007-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	then do it
2007-02-25T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	dv_	 you need to know where the start/end blocks of the install are
2007-03-22T16:21:00.000Z	dv_	ikonia	I already have VertRefresh     43-60
