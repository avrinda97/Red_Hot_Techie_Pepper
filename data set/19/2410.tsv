2010-09-15T03:09:00.000Z	tgp1994		I'd really like it if someone could help me solve this problem.
2010-09-15T03:09:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	I just joined, which prob ?
2010-09-15T03:09:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	I linked to it :)
2010-09-15T03:09:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Whoops, sorry, one sexc
2010-09-15T03:10:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Could someone add some input on this CD-RW not erasing topic? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9845938#post9845938
2010-09-15T03:12:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Any ideas?
2010-09-15T03:12:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	you will have to do it as root (sudo infront) and then use the devicename rather then the mountpoint, so sudo cdrecord /dev/sr0 blank=fast
2010-09-15T03:12:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Huh, weird. It worked fine for awhile. I can't believe it doesn't ask for permission, either.
2010-09-15T03:15:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	sudo wodim -vv dev=/dev/sr0 blank=all, try that

2010-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	was distracted for a minute, did it work ?
2010-09-15T04:04:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Thank you, that's seemed to work :)
2010-09-15T04:05:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	nice to hear, have fun
2010-09-15T04:29:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Oh dear :( After trying to mount the cd after I burned an image to it, it still fails to mount.
2010-09-15T04:32:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	try by a gui then, sudo apt-get install k3b
2010-09-15T04:34:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Ok, thanks.
2010-09-15T04:34:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	Well, actually, I'd need one for GNOME. Do you happen to know of one that works in gnome, other than gnomebaker?
2010-09-15T04:35:00.000Z	DasEi	tgp1994	k3b works fine for me under gnome, also there is brasero (which failed me two times)
2010-09-15T04:40:00.000Z	tgp1994	DasEi	I think I'd have to download a bunch of KDE libraries that I really don't want.
