2009-09-13T03:49:00.000Z	polycarbonate		maybe your ethernet card is not compatible but %80 of ethernet cards are comp. ussually
2009-09-13T03:49:00.000Z	polycarbonate		try entering 192.168.1.1 in your browser
2009-09-13T03:50:00.000Z	polycarbonate		or whatever your default router address is
2009-09-13T03:50:00.000Z	FelpsJ	polycarbonate	looks like it is pan0
2009-09-13T03:51:00.000Z	polycarbonate		well sorry i dont know :(
