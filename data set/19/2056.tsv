2011-12-27T17:05:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	read the instructions here:  http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/#other
2011-12-27T17:07:00.000Z	teemo	yabai	i did, any specific part I might have missed?
2011-12-27T17:09:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	can't think of anything - you might start over and d/l the current version - not very complicated, so not sure what your issue is
2011-12-27T17:10:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	where is unetbootin located on your system?
2011-12-27T17:12:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	try changing permissions using sudo chmod +x
2011-12-27T17:12:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	then sudo to start
2011-12-27T17:14:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	have you fufilled this: Additional dependencies (Linux Only): You will need the packages syslinux and p7zip-full installed
2011-12-27T17:15:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	got to read
2011-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	maybe they are in the repos
2011-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	apt-cache search whatever program
2011-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	yabai	teemo	then apt-get install
