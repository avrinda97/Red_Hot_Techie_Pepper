2009-06-08T20:22:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	There are none listed. So I got the one from ATis site downloaded
2009-06-08T20:22:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	what card do you have?
2009-06-08T20:23:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	An ATi Radeon X850XT
2009-06-08T20:23:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	sorry to tell you but your card's support has been dropped by the latest release of ati's drivers
2009-06-08T20:24:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	Yes but this is the 9.3 that I have downloaded. It says that it's compitable with my card
2009-06-08T20:24:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	The latest release is 9.5
2009-06-08T20:24:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	only 9.4 or 9.5 drivers will work with jaunty
2009-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	Seriously?
2009-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	yes we have had to tell a lot of people this
2009-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	you'll have to talk to ati about it, but you could try the open source driver
2009-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	So where can I go from here?
2009-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	do you need to do 3d work?

2009-06-08T20:27:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	I'd like to run World of Warcraft and it doesn't seem to be working with the standard open source drivers
2009-06-08T20:28:00.000Z	cabrey	claes	well then i guess your only option is to go back to 8.10
2009-06-08T20:28:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	Seems so
2009-06-08T20:29:00.000Z	claes	cabrey	Thanks for your time and help
