2010-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	edbian	Axident	Try booting with only 1 hdd connected.  Then Try installing with only one of the hdds connected.  Does it get stuck at mounting swap?  Does it give any errors?
2010-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	Axident	edbian	Only that it failed by trying to mount a filesystem with the type swap and tha i can continue from the partitions menu.
2010-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	edbian	Axident	Did you try to boot without that second drive connected?  Is it formatted as swap?
2010-05-19T08:04:00.000Z	Axident	edbian	my first hdd has only windows and the second hdd must have the complete Linux system
