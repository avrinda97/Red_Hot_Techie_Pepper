2007-05-29T07:40:00.000Z	cables		What the hell? After the kernel update, my hard drives are back to being hda4
2007-05-29T07:41:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	me to.  What's up with that?
2007-05-29T07:41:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	well when it went to Feisty, it changed from hda to sda, now it's back. I guess it's just a different driver.
2007-05-29T07:41:00.000Z	cables		It's not really a problem for me, though.
2007-05-29T07:42:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	It is a problem for me.  I cannot boot unless the drives are right.
2007-05-29T07:42:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	it seems to have adjusted mine to hda.
2007-05-29T07:42:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	is there any way you can edit a file?
2007-05-29T07:43:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	do you have a Knoppix CD anywhere? (Ubuntu isn't going to cut it)
2007-05-29T07:43:00.000Z	dsnyders		Cables, fsck is dropping me into a maintenance prompt because it cannot check the drives listed in fstab.
2007-05-29T07:43:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	then we'll change dstab
2007-05-29T07:43:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	All I have to do is ctrl-d to get in
2007-05-29T07:44:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	dstab?  what is dstab?
2007-05-29T07:44:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	typo, fstab
2007-05-29T07:44:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	Whew!  I thought ubuntu was going into wild directions again.
2007-05-29T07:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	The thing is, though, I just changed my fstab from hda to sda a few weeks ago.  Now I have to go back?
2007-05-29T07:45:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	i guess
2007-05-29T07:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	cables	I suppose I should bite the bullet and to the UUID thing.
2007-05-29T07:46:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	i don't know how to do the UUID thing, so you seem to know more than me :)
2007-05-29T07:46:00.000Z	cables	dsnyders	I have to go, anyway, so, yeah.
