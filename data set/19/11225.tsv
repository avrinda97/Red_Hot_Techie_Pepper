2010-02-07T07:29:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf		hello i would like to encrypt a file how can i do this?
2010-02-07T07:31:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf		hmm better questions if i encrypt something with kgpg which are the chances of someone accessing that file?
2010-02-07T07:31:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf		say i use a long password with numbers symbols capital letters
2010-02-07T07:33:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	gpg can do single files
2010-02-07T07:34:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	airtonix	good can it be cracked in human life time?
2010-02-07T07:34:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	install seahorse and gpg, then you can right click on a file in nautilus and select encrypt
2010-02-07T07:35:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	depends on the encryption strength you use
2010-02-07T07:36:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	i think that encyrption ultimately just keeps morons from getting your data and only slows down educated and determined people...
2010-02-07T07:36:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	airtonix	uhm which should i use then?
2010-02-07T07:36:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=495062
2010-02-07T07:38:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	are you using 9.10 ?
2010-02-07T07:39:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	airtonix	nope
2010-02-07T07:39:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	which one then ?
2010-02-07T07:40:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	airtonix	none using fedora atm
2010-02-07T07:41:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	ok, but you are asking about this for ubuntu i assume ?
2010-02-07T07:41:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	airtonix	for both, still since i dont want to encrypt a folder/partition just a file to burn it to a dvd, it doesnt matter whether i use ubuntu or not :)
2010-02-07T07:42:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	since seahorse and gnupg are installed by default on ubuntu 9.10, you just need to install seahorse-plugins to get the right click > encrypt entry. : http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=1842
2010-02-07T07:42:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	also, revelation password manager has a nice strong password generator
2010-02-07T07:44:00.000Z	airtonix	asdfasdfasdfasdf	after installing seahorse-plugins... i think you need to either kill nautilus and restart it or logout to restart X
