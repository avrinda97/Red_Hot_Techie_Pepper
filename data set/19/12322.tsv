2005-09-23T10:32:00.000Z	tritium	h4zn__	just install wine and winetools, then, and setup ie under winetools
2005-09-23T10:52:00.000Z	tritium	h4zn__	are you installing from universe, or from winehq.com?
2005-09-23T10:52:00.000Z	h4zn__	tritium	 winehq.com

2005-09-23T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	h4zn__	sounds like your interface is not set to "auto"
2005-09-23T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	h4zn__	you shouldn't get that error using gksudo
2005-09-23T10:56:00.000Z	tritium	h4zn__	which command  are you using?
2005-09-23T10:57:00.000Z	h4zn__	tritium	???
