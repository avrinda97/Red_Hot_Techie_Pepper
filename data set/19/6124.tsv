2008-03-25T11:31:00.000Z	genuser		yes i am familiar with it.
2008-03-25T11:31:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	Any idea how to resolve it?
2008-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	I didn't change anything.  I have been running Ubuntu 7.10 on this laptop since it came out.  Did not do an upgrade of any sort, just rebooted.
2008-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	did you change or add to anything?
2008-03-25T11:33:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	I ran dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
2008-03-25T11:34:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	i feel like you have changed your harddrive in initscript in your kernel from either sda to hda or hda to sda. i may be wrong though.
2008-03-25T11:34:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	Is there an easy way to correct this with the inability to boot the kernal?
2008-03-25T11:35:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	Can I change the root=UUID:52abc.... line to root=/dev/sda1?
2008-03-25T11:35:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	what output did you get for dkpg-reconfigure? did you run && console-setup?
2008-03-25T11:36:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	i deal with this kind of thing all the time in gentoo. is there a way to take a look into your kernel? (sorry i'm inexperienced in ubuntu. i run ubuntu on my laptop and that's about it)
2008-03-25T11:37:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	I only have access to GRUB.
2008-03-25T11:38:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	Kernal boot.  Grub works fine.
2008-03-25T11:38:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	I'll boot off of the CD and see if I can get anything resolved in that manner.
2008-03-25T11:38:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	yeah i would ask you to grep your kernel setting but i'm on jack daniels high and can't remember the commands atm
2008-03-25T11:39:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	Isn't good ol' Jackie D a low, not a high? ;)
2008-03-25T11:39:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	yes please do. i'm sorry for not helping.
2008-03-25T11:39:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	yeah :)
2008-03-25T11:39:00.000Z	subfreeze	genuser	Enjoy Jack.  I'll twiddle my thumbs while the CD downloads.
2008-03-25T11:40:00.000Z	genuser	subfreeze	okay good luck. i'll hang around for a bit more and may retire for the night.
