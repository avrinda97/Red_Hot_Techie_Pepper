2005-05-13T13:36:00.000Z	graabein		wont that give me every channel? i want linux channels
2005-05-13T13:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	Think of a topic.
2005-05-13T13:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	A linux topic, I mean.
2005-05-13T13:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	wtf is that?
2005-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	graabein	Amaranth	what is what?
2005-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	bodaciousb
2005-05-13T13:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	anyway, most channels are obvious. linux -> #linux; ubuntu -> #ubuntu; apache -> #apache; and so on
2005-05-13T13:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	IRC doesn't work that way
2005-06-04T09:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	Slackware is only good if you know how to do linux administration.
2005-06-04T09:08:00.000Z	graabein	Amaranth	ok. some way down the road for me then...
2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	If you don't have problems with Ubuntu now you probably won't when you get to the point where you could run Slackware. :)
2005-06-04T09:09:00.000Z	graabein	Amaranth	ill stay with ubuntu for the time being. i like it alot!
2005-08-09T14:23:00.000Z	graabein	Amaranth	looks like there will be a menu editor in gnome 2.12 (and breezy)
2005-08-09T14:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	That editor show/hides things.
2005-08-09T14:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	graabein	And that's it.
