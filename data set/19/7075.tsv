2007-10-14T14:44:00.000Z	Rich4		Is it possible to improve the sound quality?
2007-10-14T14:44:00.000Z	Rich4		--with ubuntu
2007-10-14T14:44:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	depends entirely on your drivers
2007-10-14T14:45:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	some sound setting combinations can make the sounds sound ugly however, experient with settings in the GNOME Mixer
2007-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	you probably just have lowered the master or something..
2007-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	the master volume*
2007-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	Applications -> Sound & Video -> GNOME ALSA Mixer
2007-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	Rich4	Enselic	I can't find GNOME ALSA Mixer
2007-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	hmm might not be installed by defalt
2007-10-14T14:49:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	do you know how to install stuff in Ubuntu?
2007-10-14T14:49:00.000Z	Rich4	Enselic	I'm at the add/remove window now; the mixer was not under sound&video programs for 'supported ubuntu apps
2007-10-14T14:50:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	try to find it in System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
2007-10-14T14:50:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	if it's not in Add/Remove it will be in synaptic
2007-10-14T14:51:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	oh well, ALSA Mixer is the same thing but a command line interface
2007-10-14T14:51:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	a little bit harder to use, but why not give it a shot I guess
2007-10-14T14:57:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	there are too many to choose between
2007-10-14T14:59:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	why not use the default one?
2007-10-14T14:59:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	that comes with your Ubuntu installation
2007-10-14T14:59:00.000Z	Enselic	Rich4	Applications -> Sound & VIdeo
