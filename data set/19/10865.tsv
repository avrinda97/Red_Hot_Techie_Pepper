2009-02-02T03:48:00.000Z	erpo		What is the simpliest, easiest way to get a static IPv6 address on an Ubuntu 8.04 server from behind a NAT device?
2009-02-02T03:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	define "get"?
2009-02-02T03:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	your NATing device should not matter at all as long as it can route IPv6
2009-02-02T03:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	however, you still need your ISP to allocate you an IPv6 address (or a block of addresses :))
2009-02-02T03:50:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	I want to be able to ssh into my server using IPv6, so I'll need an address with global scope.
2009-02-02T03:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	you need to ask your ISP to give you that.
2009-02-02T03:50:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	If I could get a /64 from my ISP, that would be wonderful, but that's not going to happen.
2009-02-02T03:50:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	The only solution I know of is a tunnel broker. Right now I'm using teredo, but it's miserable.
2009-02-02T03:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	then I don't think there is much you can do... besides using tunnel brokers.
2009-02-02T03:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	contact your ISP and ask them what it would take to get a block.
2009-02-02T03:51:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	So the question becomes: which tunnel broker uses the client-side software that's easiest to set up on Ubuntu 8.04?
2009-02-02T03:51:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	I think they just don't do that.
2009-02-02T03:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	hmm, that I don't know :/
2009-02-02T03:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	search the repos for ipv6 stuff? maybe you'll find a hint

2009-02-02T04:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	:(
2009-02-02T04:09:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	Incidentally, where do you live that you think you might be able to get IPv6 service from an ISP?
2009-02-02T04:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	erpo	Finland.
2009-02-02T04:09:00.000Z	erpo	Chousuke	Cool!
