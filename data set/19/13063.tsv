2005-06-17T08:21:00.000Z	hd420		anyone know why libgmp is listed as broken?
2005-06-17T08:22:00.000Z	hd420		and how to tell apt that the package does indeed exist but was built by hand?
2005-06-17T08:22:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	Create a package, and install the package.
2005-06-17T08:23:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	What do you want to install.
2005-06-17T08:23:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	apt-get source libgmp3
2005-06-17T08:23:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	apt-get source libgmp3-dev
2005-06-17T08:24:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	apt-get install cvs-buildpackage
2005-06-17T08:24:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	And check out the manpages.
2005-06-17T08:25:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	man cvs-buildpackage
2005-06-17T08:26:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	then dpkg -i {created debfile}
2005-06-17T08:28:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	Oh, sorry.
2005-06-17T08:29:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	You could just compile and install in /usr/local that's what it's for.
2005-06-17T08:31:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	I guess I do.. completely
2005-06-17T08:31:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	So you want it in your package-management system.
2005-06-17T08:35:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	I hope I got the point this time.. ;-)
2005-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	 check out the manpage for dpkg-buildpackage
2005-06-17T08:46:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	I won't discuss that with you. sorry.
2005-06-17T08:46:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	I understand your frustrations but if the package you require is broken you'll have to find another way.. compile it..
2005-06-17T08:48:00.000Z	klaas_	hd420	Or report the bug and wait.
