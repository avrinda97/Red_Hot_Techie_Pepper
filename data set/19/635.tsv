2012-01-21T03:31:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Hello, I've been trying to allow myself to run an program without sudo, I've tried using the visudo file and inputing the line "username ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/program" where username is my username and program is the program, yet I still have sudo asking me for a password.
2012-01-21T03:32:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Could anyone tell me why?
2012-01-21T03:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	running without a password is generally not suggested.
2012-01-21T03:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	are you sure you need to and if you do if making your set up no password the answer.
2012-01-21T03:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	yeah right lol.
2012-01-21T03:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	a biot calling the kettle black eh.
2012-01-21T03:35:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	urlin2u	Now, in this circumstance, making sudo run this single program with no password is my only viable option. All I'm asking for is to tell me what I did wrong. I've verified it against the man pages, it seems as though I did it right, but it refuses to work.
2012-01-21T03:36:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	urlin2u	I am the only sudo user on this system, it is encrypted via 256 aes. My account has a strong password. I am absolutely sure that this is the right option, can you help me?
2012-01-21T03:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	the password is for external protection as well, I just doubt you will get help here especially without actually identifying your goal by name the app, just saying, you might try ##linux
2012-01-21T03:39:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	urlin2u	It is a script I wrote. Not a special program, just a bash script to mount a truecrypt volume.
2012-01-21T03:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	cool I can't really help other then pass on the channel norms and sugetions of other channels.
2012-01-21T03:40:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	urlin2u	Not to be rude, then why did you criticize me without the ability or knowledge to help fix my problem?
2012-01-21T03:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	you take information as criticism that s a projection, I started with that no password is not suggested you have started any rude behavior.
2012-01-21T03:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	don't read into others it will serve you well.
2012-01-21T03:42:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	urlin2u	I take implying that I have no clue what I am doing as rude, I also take presumptions as rude. Regardless, have a nice day :)
2012-02-09T05:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	no quantum theory at the start eh. :)
2012-02-09T05:26:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha	urlin2u	Sadly no. I am quite versed in the mechanics of quantum energies now, but a few years ago, I was still doing Dx and Dy :P
2012-02-09T05:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	the whole field of hypothesis thoug hI guess
2012-02-09T05:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	JosephHarrietha	super faulty cause and effect bro.
