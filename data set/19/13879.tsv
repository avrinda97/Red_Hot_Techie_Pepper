2005-07-21T09:54:00.000Z	calc	tomchuk	i've seen pentium m that last much less depends on the battery in the laptop
2005-07-21T09:54:00.000Z	tomchuk	calc	 yeah, I've got a t40 with the extended battery :)
2005-07-21T09:55:00.000Z	calc	tomchuk	yea those are nice :)
2005-07-21T09:55:00.000Z	calc	tomchuk	whats the mWh on the t40 extended battery?
2005-07-21T09:55:00.000Z	tomchuk	calc	 mine's max is 71280 mWh
2005-07-21T09:56:00.000Z	calc	tomchuk	hmm then the p-m is roughly 2x better at battery life it seems
2005-07-21T09:56:00.000Z	calc	tomchuk	thats about what i would have guessed at as well
2005-07-21T09:57:00.000Z	tomchuk	calc	 IBM actually updates a pdf with benchmarks of all their laptops and all their batteries every quarter
