2004-12-13T16:59:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	make sure you use the ns7 plugin though, not the gcc29 vm...
2004-12-14T17:00:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	its kinda easy to figure out if you used the wrong one though, mozilla won't start at all if you used the wrong one  :(
2004-12-14T17:01:00.000Z	shingoki	|trey|	that sounds bad ;)
2004-12-14T17:02:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	uh huh  :)
2004-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	it is kinda hidden... multimedia would be the wrong place though...
2004-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	shingoki	|trey|	Yup, whichever menu seemd like the right one
2004-12-14T17:04:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	its definatly NOT supposed to be like windows... its supposed to be intelligent... but it confuses too many, so they failed, and need to rethink it...
2004-12-14T17:05:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	probably system tools or accessories... I always thought file-roller should be able to do iso's for instance...
2004-12-14T17:06:00.000Z	shingoki	|trey|	That's just getting back to doing the same thing in two different places, apparently you just right click an iso and tell it to burn, but again that is pretty "hidden"
2004-12-14T17:08:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	with g-v-m, it being hidden is relatively ok... but multiple places to do the same thing is a Good Thing (tm)... some practices are more logical to some people...
2004-12-14T17:09:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	it doesn't like me, and the feeling is mutual, but thats besides the point  :P
2004-12-14T17:14:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	type 'mount'... if "ubuntu has control of it" then it sounds like its mounted...
2004-12-14T17:17:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	I listen to a lot of shoutcast streams though.... I have tried to convince them ogg is better, but no change...
2004-12-14T17:21:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	SCO actually has a valid point though if they did purchase what they thought they did... cept they just purchased the UNIX license business... not the patents... according to most of what I have read...
2004-12-14T17:21:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	if they had purchased the patents though, they would easily win against IBM...
2004-12-14T17:24:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	they didn't purchase copyrights or patents though... just the UNIX business that Novell didn't care for... Funny thing is though, Caldera started releasing that code back in 98 or something...
2004-12-14T17:25:00.000Z	shingoki	|trey|	Yeah from what I heard, none of the parties invilved really know WHAT they have ;)
2004-12-14T17:25:00.000Z	|trey|	shingoki	Novell knows... SCO's people aren't the people that signed the agreements though  :/
