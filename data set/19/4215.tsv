2009-11-14T00:21:00.000Z	glick		im trying to see what the difference is between running regular ubuntu vs NBR on a eeepc
2009-11-14T00:22:00.000Z	glick		since they took out switch to classical desktop option in NBR
2009-11-14T00:22:00.000Z	glick		why!!!!!!
2009-11-14T00:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	if you have the space i'd use the full install - you can add the netbook interface to the full install, but adding gnome to NBR is much more challenging
2009-11-14T00:23:00.000Z	glick	ZykoticK9	is the nbr interface the only difference?
2009-11-14T00:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	yes - the hardware support / kernel are the same!
2009-11-14T00:24:00.000Z	glick	ZykoticK9	its not compiled differently or something?
2009-11-14T00:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	same - just interface/programs are different
2009-11-14T00:25:00.000Z	glick	ZykoticK9	so performance is the same?
2009-11-14T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	they are the same thing!
2009-11-14T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	it's to reduce the size of the install
2010-07-16T04:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	"using password: NO" means your not entering a password!  if one is already set - you will fail.
2010-08-08T18:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	re: 2 pass - it basically pretends to encode the first pass, then really encodes on the 2nd.  you get better quality, more accurate size, with 2pass encoding (generally)
2010-08-08T18:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glick	it takes longer obviously
