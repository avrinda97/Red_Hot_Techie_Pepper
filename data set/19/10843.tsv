2006-10-06T14:37:00.000Z	mathrick		quick, what is the line I want to use with aptitude to upgrade dapper -> edgy? So that I can leave it to upgrade and go shave? :)
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	your nick looks familiar ...
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	yeah, as does yours
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	#gnome-hackers ?
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	ah yes. i'm one of the GNOME sysamdins. :)
2006-10-06T14:40:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	cheers :)
2006-10-06T14:40:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	when you're done with that short term memory part of your brain, could i lease it or something. ;)
2006-10-06T14:40:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	I doubt it'll be useful, leaky as shit ;)
2006-10-06T14:41:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	mine not only leaks, but is FIFO and cooperatively multitasks. :/
2006-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	so, before we trade our short-term memories, do you happen to know a line to insert into sources.list / whatever for upgrading to Edgy?
2006-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	lemme find the correct URLs for you.
2006-10-06T14:53:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	i know we have it documented somewhere internally, just need to find it.
2006-10-06T14:53:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	yeah, I know it's possible, I just don't feel like fighting with releases and pins today :)
2006-10-06T14:54:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	amen, brother.
2006-10-06T14:56:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	gksu "update-manager -c -d"
2006-10-06T14:59:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	lemme try this
2006-10-06T15:01:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	WHOA, "Upgrade distribution" button sure is shiny. A bit like star trek :)
2006-10-06T15:01:00.000Z	mneptok	mathrick	"Please state the nature of the dist-upgrade emergency." ;)
2006-10-06T15:02:00.000Z	mathrick	mneptok	:)
