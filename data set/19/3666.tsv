2009-06-27T16:19:00.000Z	gangil1		hi , is there any GUI version for lmsensors???
2009-06-27T16:19:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	computertemp as applet, take it from synaptic
2009-06-27T16:20:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	It will help me in monitoring my motherboard temp. , right? just confirming I am a noob
2009-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	I couldnt find computertemp in synaptic and even apt-get failed
2009-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	then install sensors-applet from synaptic
2009-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	there is no such thing as sensors-applet , there is only libsensors3
2009-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	weird, did you update your ubuntu after the initial install ?
2009-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	I just updated it yesterday
2009-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	check your software sources
2009-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	installed 276 updates from update manager
2009-06-27T16:33:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	http://imagebin.org/53865
2009-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	is ksensors the same?
2009-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	yes but for kde i guess
2009-06-27T16:38:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	I thought all kde apps run on gnome
2009-06-27T16:39:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	go on and try it, but its weird you don't have computertemp and lm-sensors
2009-06-27T16:49:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	finally I got gkrellm installed , I think it's fine it shows me THM and GPU C temperatures.......
2009-06-27T16:50:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	then its good :)
2009-06-27T17:05:00.000Z	gangil1	cyberghoser1	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/speed-up-firefox-web-browser.html , is it safe to speed up firefox as mentioned here , or does it have any drawbacks?
2009-06-27T17:06:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gangil1	its safe to do
