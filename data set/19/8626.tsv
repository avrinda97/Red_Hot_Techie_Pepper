2007-03-04T12:58:00.000Z	topato		hi, I just installed an ftp server on ubuntu. everything works fine inside my LAN, but accessing it from outside is very slow (and  sometimes does not work). Other services like sshfs etc works fine. Any settings I could do besides opening port 21 in my firewall?
2007-03-04T13:00:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	FTP works on ports 20 and 21 if I'm not mistaken
2007-03-04T13:01:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	Still the same problem
2007-03-04T13:02:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	So the FTP server works fine on your LAN, but goes slow when going through your firewall?
2007-03-04T13:02:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	exactly
2007-03-04T13:03:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	I'm trying to mount the ftp (mount -t ftp) under os x, but it refuses most of the time.. I can ftp in to it through the shell though.
2007-03-04T13:04:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	Can you mount the ftp server via the Finder?
2007-03-04T13:04:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	I forgot where that menu option is in OS X.
2007-03-04T13:04:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	I can through the lan
2007-03-04T13:04:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	and .. partially through Internet
2007-03-04T13:04:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	What kind of firewall/router are you using?
2007-03-04T13:05:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	Could this possibly be because I'm trying to access it through the Internet from inside the LAN?
2007-03-04T13:05:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	I can vaguely remember hearing something about problems with port forwards when you try them from inside the lan.
2007-03-04T13:06:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	I'm not quite sure on accessing your external IP like that.... I did it a few weeks back with a ventrilo server and had no problems
2007-03-04T13:06:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	I see. weird.
2007-03-04T13:07:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	You verified your internal IP on your FTP server and make sure it didn't change? (I'm assuming you're running DHCP on your LAN)
2007-03-04T13:07:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	It's a static address.
2007-03-04T13:08:00.000Z	topato	billymeter	I have reserved a range for serverish computers
2007-03-04T13:08:00.000Z	billymeter	topato	Ah, okay. Port forwarding on ports 20 and 21 for the ftp server?
