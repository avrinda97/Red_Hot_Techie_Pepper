2008-11-04T13:23:00.000Z	spolvid		Can someone help me? I'm trying to install Ubuntu and at 95% completion it says "Unable to install GRUB in (hd0)"
2008-11-04T13:25:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	<alt>-<F2> should give you a console.
2008-11-04T13:25:00.000Z	spolvid	kgod	And what then?
2008-11-04T13:25:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	1.  switch to a console.
2008-11-04T13:25:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	2.  start a shell
2008-11-04T13:26:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	3.  ...
2008-11-04T13:26:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	4.  Profit!
2008-11-04T13:26:00.000Z	spolvid	kgod	Huh?
2008-11-04T13:26:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	See if there's an update-grub command available, if not, it's a wrapper around 'grub', which should be present.
2008-11-04T13:27:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	You've also got a couple of additional consoles on which errors/status is logged, may give you more detail.
2008-11-04T13:27:00.000Z	spolvid	kgod	And when should I start this shell?
2008-11-04T13:27:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	That's sorta up to you, but during the install when you're stuck, might be among the more promising opportunities.
2008-11-04T13:28:00.000Z	spolvid	kgod	Ok, I'll try that. Thanks for the help.
2008-11-04T13:49:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	Just ask your question
2008-11-04T13:50:00.000Z	spolvid	kgod	I tried update-grub, and then the installer couldn't see anything other than my boot drive.
2008-11-04T13:51:00.000Z	spolvid	kgod	For instance, it couldn't see the external drive I want to install onto.
2008-11-04T13:52:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	^^
2008-11-04T13:53:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	You can in a pinch punt the install w/o getting grub set up, though you'll need to boot a livecd to get into your system.  chroot into the install, see if it looks sane, and fix grub from within there if you need to.
2008-11-04T13:53:00.000Z	kgod	spolvid	Questions to channel, I'm really gone.
