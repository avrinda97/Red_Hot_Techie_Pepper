2007-05-05T09:06:00.000Z	Micieri		I made my second HD Ubuntu dedicated..
2007-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	what kind of problems have you been having?
2007-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	that's your problem, you haven't had enough time to be frustrated with linux yet. It's like, I dunno, karma, or something
2007-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	you haven't tried installing on another HD by andy chance have you?
2007-05-05T09:11:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	yeah, that is frustrating. System halts are particularly annoying.  Sounds like the disk cylinders are all screwed up. Does your xp HD work?
2007-05-05T09:12:00.000Z	Micieri	wepeel	- Yes, that's what makes it more frustrating, that one works fine
2007-05-05T09:13:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	do you have a disk partitioning program set up on XP?
2007-05-05T09:14:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	right, I wanted to find out if a disk partitioner could see the other HD and reformat it. That's worked for me in the past
2007-05-05T09:15:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	Something like partition magic
2007-05-05T09:16:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	yep. Other than that, I think the only way you're going to solve your problem is to get a different HD. That's just a guess though
2007-05-05T09:19:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	hey, one more option. have you tried another linux distro?
2007-05-05T09:19:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	try installing debian. If it has the same problem, it's very likely the disk
2007-05-05T09:19:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	and?
2007-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	I mean one that acutally installs on the HD
2007-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	wepeel	Micieri	hehe, try that. See what happens
