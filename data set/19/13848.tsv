2005-10-27T12:23:00.000Z	nicedreams	D1	Creative Zen Micro rocks over an IPOD IMHO
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	D1		can you mount your ipod as an external HD?
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	D1		and drop songs in?
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	D1		oh
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	nicedreams	D1	that's why i like the creative zen, you can just drop your song in it
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	D1	nicedreams	creative zen on linux you can't do that...
