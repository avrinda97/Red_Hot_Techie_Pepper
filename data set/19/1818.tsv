2010-10-14T19:09:00.000Z	happydude		does anyone know how to turn off screensaver in 10.04
2010-10-14T19:09:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	System -> Preferences -> Screensaver?
2010-10-14T19:12:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	That's probably the power management
2010-10-14T19:12:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	Are you on a laptop running on battery?
2010-10-14T19:13:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	I have turned off powermanager after configuring it not to blank the screen ever.
2010-10-14T19:14:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	Turned off powermanager?
2010-10-14T19:14:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	I turned off powermanager in startup applications
2010-10-14T19:14:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	The power management system will still be running. That's just the frontend to it
2010-10-14T19:15:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	ok.
2010-10-14T19:15:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	Go to system -> Preferences -> Power management, and change "Put display to sleep when inactive for:" to "Never"
2010-10-14T19:16:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	I already done that... verifying ... yes it is set to never.
2010-10-14T19:17:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	weird. When your screen blanks, is it just a black screen, or does your monitor go to sleep?
2010-10-14T19:17:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	I.e., does the backlight turn off?
2010-10-14T19:18:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	I think the monitor goes to sleep, but I am not sure. I have two different monitors. It happens to both.
2010-10-14T19:19:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	Are you using proprietary video drivers?
2010-10-14T19:20:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	yes. I have an asus ati 5570 fanless ( passive cooling ) card
2010-10-14T19:20:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	I think that fglrx handles the power management for its card/monitors
2010-10-14T19:21:00.000Z	undecim	happydude	Install the catalyst control center and see if you can change the options there.
2010-10-14T19:21:00.000Z	happydude	undecim	I have that and I'm looking at it now. Don't find anything yet.
