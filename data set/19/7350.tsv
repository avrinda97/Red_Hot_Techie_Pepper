2007-09-06T13:11:00.000Z	gvsa123		i can test whether ubuntu will work well on my presario 2720 notebook using the live cd right? like check whether all hardware are working, easy access buttons and stuff?
2007-09-06T13:11:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	Yeah, you can
2007-09-06T13:12:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	so any potential problems would be immediately obviously by using the live cd? no difference between installing?
2007-09-06T13:13:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	Probably, yeah
2007-09-06T13:14:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	waaaahhh... is this my windows login name and password the live cd is asking for?
2007-09-06T13:14:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	It's been some time since I've used the LiveCD, in what context is it asking for pass/user?
2007-09-06T13:15:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	the login for Ubuntu
2007-09-06T13:15:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	It's not the windows-pass.
2007-09-06T13:16:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	i realized that... tried every combnation already. what then?
2007-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	After a quick google search(And my own recollection) it appears that asking for a user/password on the livecd is not the correct behaviour, so it might be that your cd image is corrupt
2007-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	ah i see... man.. i just gave the other one, probably the one i used before, to someone else... crap!
2007-09-06T13:25:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	nevermind.. i'll just wait a couple of weeks for gutsy before i get rid of xp... thanks...
2007-09-06T13:25:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	aha! i still have edgy!
2007-09-06T13:27:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	oh there you go... the same live cd worked
2007-09-06T13:36:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	Do you know what kind of wireless card you have?
2007-09-06T13:37:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	PCMCIA linksys WPC54G
2007-09-06T13:39:00.000Z	gvsa123	JonJ	saw it in the device manager, but with a different name...
2007-09-06T13:39:00.000Z	JonJ	gvsa123	It looks like it has got a broadcom chipset. It may need some firmware or maybe even the windows .inf file to work.
