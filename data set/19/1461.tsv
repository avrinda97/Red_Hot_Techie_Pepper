2011-01-25T03:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	sounds about right
2011-01-25T03:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	javascript gone librarian poo, or huge flash ad somewhere
2011-01-25T03:14:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gordonjcp	whats the solution?
2011-01-25T03:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	install and use adblock plus
2011-01-25T03:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	ruthlessly
2011-01-25T03:16:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gordonjcp	but i have not opened any sites with flash, ads .    actually i have opened joomla adminstrator pannel and some wiki sites
2011-01-25T03:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	hm, okay
2011-01-25T03:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	I guess you could try closing tabs one at a time until you see what does it
2011-01-25T03:19:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gordonjcp	closed all tabs one by one  now what i see in processes is firfox>%cpu>0 and on resources cpu1>77 and cpu2>90
2011-01-25T03:19:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gordonjcp	i have no other appplication opened , then where is cpu being consumed

2011-01-25T03:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	I heard you the first time
2011-01-25T03:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	does it stop if you close and restart firefox?  Maybe there's a partially-dead plugin hanging around
2011-01-25T03:21:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gordonjcp	don't stop on closing
2011-01-25T03:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	O_o
2011-01-25T03:22:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gordonjcp	but when i restart everything ok
2011-01-25T03:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	from a terminal, pkill firefox
2011-01-25T03:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thauriswulfa	brutal, but sometimes it just has to be that way
