2012-05-07T23:33:00.000Z	xskydevilx		Is it possible to run Skype 5.9 on Ubuntu?
2012-05-07T23:33:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	no, skype stopped updating the linux kernel some time ago
2012-05-07T23:34:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	and now that MS bought it i expect that to only get worse
2012-05-07T23:34:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	What about throught Wine or something?
2012-05-07T23:34:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	virtualbox would work for sure.
2012-05-07T23:34:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	wine... i'm doubtful but maybe?
2012-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	Hm.. The 2.2 beta just doesn't seem to cut it.
2012-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	it works well enough for me.
2012-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	skype is pretty crappy
2012-05-07T23:36:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	if you want to computer->phone communication google voice might be a better option
2012-05-07T23:36:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	Well, I'm kind of forced to use it.
2012-05-07T23:36:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	Skype that is. I use Google voice for work.
2012-05-07T23:36:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	me too.
2012-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	where is 2.2 failing you?
2012-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	The UI side of things, and the fonts. I am the head of design at work, so that might be the reason. hehe
2012-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	yah, it looks like ass but it's functionally 'alright'
2012-05-07T23:38:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	Granted, I haven't tried using Wine to get 5.9. Do you happen to be on Ubuntu?
2012-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	Simkin	xskydevilx	wine won't run skype, already checked.
2012-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	xskydevilx	Simkin	God damn it.
