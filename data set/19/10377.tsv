2008-03-12T05:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	NOT in here.. one sec
2008-03-12T05:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | pastebinit   in a term
2008-03-12T05:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	it pastes your xorg into a pastebin and gives you a link to give people that are helping you
2008-03-12T06:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org 59313   from my ati 7500
2008-03-12T06:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	Wrong box...
2008-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	Yes.. sorry.. I cant remember which box has the 7500..
2008-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	 it looks like you edited that xorg of yours manually..
2008-03-12T06:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	lspci | grep -i vga should show you the right pci port for setting up the video card in your xorg
2008-03-12T06:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	computer	I am trying one other computer to see if it has the 7500
