2010-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	daniel__		heya new here and too linux is there any beginner rooms ???
2010-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	you're in it
2010-06-20T10:40:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	this is the usual tech support room. if you need help, you can ask here
2010-06-20T10:41:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	i guarantee there are no questions thatll get you told off for asking something too beginner here. if anyone tries it, i will kick them from the room
2010-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	sorry i assumed you wanted a place you could ask a question, in which case the answer is here.  if you just want to know where beginner classes are occasionally held and where the beginners team which answers questions on the forum hang out, thatd be #ubuntu-beginners
2010-06-20T10:44:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	yes i saw that when you asked the first time and i told you here since i thought "i am new" meant you had questions to ask. are you going to ask questions?
2010-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	this is certainly not an advanced-users-only channel. its an *every* user channel
2010-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	just ignore anything that's not said directly to you
2010-06-20T10:46:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	see how i'm saying your name at the start of the line? that means you'll get some sort of notification that im talking to you. text may be a differen colour? if you're looking at something other than your client, you may get a popup?  same'll happen to someone else if you say their name. if you only bother with whats said to you, its not so fast
2010-06-20T10:48:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	yep
2010-06-20T10:49:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	does that help make sense of the channel/room ?
2010-06-20T10:50:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	likewise i only get notified that you're talking to me if you say my name ;-)
2010-06-20T10:51:00.000Z	daniel__	maco	 did that work then
2010-06-20T10:51:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	yep
2010-06-20T10:54:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	the file browser that opens when you click something in the Places menu
2010-06-20T11:15:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	if you want to try out the applications that go with other environments, you can simply install them using applications -> software center (erm i hope thats how its found) and then run them inside gnome
2010-06-20T11:15:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	thats the easiest way. they'll all run within it just fine
2010-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	if you'd said "you are" instead of "youre" i'd have wondered at a Doctor Who reference
2010-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	maco	daniel__	lsb_release -a
