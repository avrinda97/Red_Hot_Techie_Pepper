2005-11-23T06:07:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		Hello, Im new to linux. I need some help to build souce files. I have some source as tar.gz for some libraries and I want to build a binary for kubuntu. Any help?
2005-11-23T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	what are yo utrying to build?
2005-11-23T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	and the library is...
2005-11-23T06:09:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	which is in ubuntu already
2005-11-23T06:10:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	why would you want to rebuild them?
2005-11-23T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	um, none of that actually mentions recompiling SDL, afaik
2005-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	bob2	he recompiles after installing the SDL libraries... so maybe using them
2005-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	bob2	But I don't know how he got that .pl file
2005-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	did you install the sdl mixer library?
2005-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	then ask them, it's not in ubuntu
2005-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	bob2	I don't know where to find that mixer library. And the mixer one is a different person. The one that recompiles.. he is like me
2005-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	you're misreading it
2005-11-23T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	where do any of them suggest recompiling SDL?
2005-11-23T06:16:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	bob2	No they do not suggest recompile of SDL but recompile the file in nwn/lib folder using the SDL libraries... I think
2005-11-23T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	yes
2005-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	that file is not on your hard disk
2005-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	bob2	: I'm looking for nwmovies.so
2005-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	bob2	GuerillaTactiks	which is also not in ubuntu
2005-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	bob2	: Not that would be a game file
