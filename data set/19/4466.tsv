2009-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	so do i but maybe i have not read into aptitudes man pages deep enough. determining to run specific versions of a package i just love the files in /etc/portage
2009-01-08T11:38:00.000Z	rxs	tenX	yes, i like portage and ebuilds .. but I dont have the patience to build gentoo from scratch and my desktop has been abused much :) .. hence start with sabyon pod and recompile impotant libs :)
2009-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	sabyon pod?
2009-01-08T11:42:00.000Z	rxs	tenX	yes sabyon pod
2009-01-08T11:42:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	not "yes", what is it? ;)
2009-01-08T11:43:00.000Z	rxs	tenX	Sabayon is a gentoo derivative as u already know, and the pod is a thin version of sabayon which normally comes loaded with all the apps and about 12 gigs when expanded ..
2009-01-08T11:44:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	thx for that info, i didnt know. dont care too much about distro variations.
2009-01-08T11:44:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	never have the time for that
2009-01-08T11:45:00.000Z	rxs	tenX	I like my distro thin ~ 3- 3.5 G max.. hence always go from the thinnest and build over ... so the pod when installed is about 2 G
2009-01-08T11:45:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	and yes of course i could have googled it. but in conversation i only do so if it hits my personal interest. like your reaction to politely respond and to not flame me for my laziness
2009-01-08T11:46:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	but 2G? is that considered slim nowadays?
2009-01-08T11:46:00.000Z	rxs	tenX	most of these distros seem to take atleast 6 G
2009-01-08T11:48:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	hmm i cant tell. when i install a distro its mostly a server version without X and additional software. dunno how much it takes but for sure not a lot
2009-01-08T11:50:00.000Z	rxs	tenX	simple ubuntu server + xubuntu desktop + basic essentials ( of course thats debatable ) = 3.5 G
2009-01-08T11:51:00.000Z	tenX	rxs	wow thats tremendous.. as i mentioned i dont install any gui stuff
