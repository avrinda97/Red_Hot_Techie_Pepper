2008-01-28T18:57:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		ah you know my ubuntu died on me. sadly im back in win xp to back up some stuff before i reinstall ubuntu.
2008-01-28T18:57:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		man i hate this.
2008-01-28T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	do you have a question yes/no ?
2008-02-06T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	you don't need to use gksudo - just open the user manager gui from the menu in gnome
2008-02-06T18:39:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	which is what i did, gksu, then tried with gksudo. same behaviour.
2008-02-06T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	you don't need to type gksudo
2008-02-06T18:40:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	let me try once more.
2008-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	it didnt create the user because a group already existed with that name for some reason... i think it also wanted to create a new group of that name.
2008-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	thats one of ubuntu's things new users get their own group
2008-02-06T18:46:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	yes... hence i think it didnt really want me to create a user for which a group had already been made (at install time, i surmise).
2008-02-06T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	that seems reasonable
2008-02-06T18:47:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	i only just noticed when i tried creating a completely different user. thanks anyway. :)
2008-02-13T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	thats set at compile time
2008-02-13T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	mostly anyway
2008-02-13T23:00:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	yikes. i suppose uniformity makes for easy profile management... i was hoping there was a more elegant way of cleaning up ~ rather than ctrl+h toggling in nautilus.
2008-02-13T23:01:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	your right, thats the driver behind it --with-config-dir=/etc or whatever is the normal option
2008-02-13T23:02:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	i'm not talking about /etc, but the users's home directory. to save config files inside, say, /home/user1/somefolder instead of /home/user1.
2008-02-13T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	L3ttuc3	yes, I know,I was giving you /etc as an example
2008-02-13T23:03:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	ikonia	ah ok.
