2011-06-03T19:25:00.000Z	hobeii		I'm having problems installing the 32bit driver for the canon pixma mx320 all-in-one-printer on my 64bit system (11.04)
2011-06-03T19:25:00.000Z	hobeii		the Install is showing missing dependencies that are installed already
2011-06-03T19:27:00.000Z	hobeii		missing packages would be
2011-06-03T19:27:00.000Z	hobeii		 cnijfilter-common:i386 hängt ab von libc6 (>= 2.3.4-1).
2011-06-03T19:27:00.000Z	hobeii		 cnijfilter-common:i386 hängt ab von libcupsys2 (>= 1.2.1) | libcups2.
2011-06-03T19:27:00.000Z	hobeii		 cnijfilter-common:i386 hängt ab von libpopt0 (>= 1.7).
2011-06-03T19:28:00.000Z	hobeii		at least I get an answer this way :P
2011-06-03T19:29:00.000Z	oCean	hobeii	that cannot be a reason to violate guidelines
2011-06-03T19:29:00.000Z	oCean	hobeii	anyway, you say you have 64bit system, but the package you are trying to install seems to be .i386 (32 bit)
2011-06-03T19:30:00.000Z	hobeii	oCean	that's correct
2011-06-03T19:30:00.000Z	hobeii	oCean	it doesn't seem to be any 64bit drivers avail
2011-06-03T19:30:00.000Z	oCean	hobeii	you should not mix those architectures. Ask the maintainers of that package, what can we do about that?
2011-06-03T19:31:00.000Z	hobeii	oCean	I know I shouldn't. But thee's this printer and I want to get it running ...
2011-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	oCean	hobeii	yes, but we cannot support 3rd party software
2011-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	hobeii	oCean	I see. do you still have any idea, why dpkg sais there are dependencies
2011-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	oCean	hobeii	yes, because you are mixing architectures. That. Won't. Work
2011-06-03T19:33:00.000Z	hobeii	oCean	so the only way would be to install 32bit version of Ubuntu?
2011-06-03T19:34:00.000Z	oCean	hobeii	I have no idea. There might be other possibilities, ask the manufacturer
2011-06-03T19:34:00.000Z	hobeii	oCean	thanks
