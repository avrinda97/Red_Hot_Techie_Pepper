2006-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	srand		Hi people
2006-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	srand		Hard to make my sd car reader works with the latest kernel
2006-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	srand		sorry , my sd card
2006-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	srand		anyone ? I got an sdhci device
2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	srand		no one wants to help me making my sdcard reader works
2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	srand		???
2006-06-04T13:41:00.000Z	srand		But it works with the live cd 6.06 !!!
2006-06-04T13:41:00.000Z	srand		sd card
2006-06-04T13:42:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 it could be ehci_hcd
2006-06-04T13:42:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 check malone first.
2006-06-04T13:43:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 yes.  it could very well be a bug though if it doesn't work when you install 6.06
2006-06-04T13:43:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 everything else is obsoleted as breezy uses hotplug
2006-06-04T13:44:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 so until you migrate to dapper, it probably won't work without serious twiddling.
2006-06-04T13:45:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 no.  it all comes down to hotplug versus dev
2006-06-04T13:45:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 believe me, save yourself some worry and just flip to 6.06.
2006-06-04T13:45:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 i have solved several friends cardreader issues and it is just easier to do the dapper.
2006-06-04T13:46:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 try malone.
2006-06-04T13:47:00.000Z	troy_s	srand	 malone is where the bugs are located for ubuntu.
