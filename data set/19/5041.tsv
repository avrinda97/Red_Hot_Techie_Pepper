2010-03-07T10:46:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	That link is useless. As I said, there is no menu.lst in my grub folder. I cannot do as told in that link of yours.
2010-03-07T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 grub2 does NOT have a menu.lst it has its own set of configs.  You need to edit the proper configs for whtever version of grub you are using
2010-03-07T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 if you are using grub1 you should have a menu.lst , since you dont. either its been deleted (doubtfull) or you are using grub2
2010-03-07T10:47:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	I do NOT have grub2 ... thanks for your help, though. Appreciate it..
2010-03-07T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 then you some how lost the file I guess.
2010-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	I doubt it, installed Ubuntu like a few hours ago. As far as I know my Grub is 1.9.7 something. Maybe it changed due to the update...
2010-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	I suppose you do not know what config file I need to change..
2010-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	  what verison of ubuntu? grub2 IS the default on 9.10
2010-03-07T10:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 and i think the actual version # for grub2 IS '1.97'
2010-03-07T10:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 so it looks like you are very likely using grub2
2010-03-07T10:50:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	Alright. I'll try asking google how to change stuff in Grub2 lol
2010-03-07T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 its documented at the !grub2 factoid the bot mentioned.. and the grub homepage
2010-03-07T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/XXXXXX files
2010-03-07T10:51:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	Alright, thank you. Well "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE This is the main Grub 2 file. It "replaces" Grub Legacy's /boot/grub/menu.lst. This file contains the Grub menu instructions. Unlike Grub Legacy's menu.lst file, grub.cfg is NOT MEANT TO BE EDITED!!! "
2010-03-07T10:51:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	Should I edit it? lol
2010-03-07T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 corredt.. do NOT edit that file.. i  told you the other files you are supposed to edit
2010-03-07T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rimdeker	 edit it if you want.. but eveyr time you 'update-grub' it will get overwritten
2010-03-07T10:52:00.000Z	rimdeker	Dr_Willis	Aye aye
