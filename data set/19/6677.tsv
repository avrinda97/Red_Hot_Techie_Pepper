2007-12-28T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	that language is uncalled for.
2007-12-28T17:15:00.000Z	Peeco	ikonia	apologies, im new here
2007-12-28T17:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	your not, I've seen you in here before.
2007-12-28T17:17:00.000Z	Peeco	ikonia	i joined yesterday under the alias peco1
2007-12-28T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	thats interesting my irc logs show the user Peeco from the BT address range your on being in here over the last month
2007-12-28T17:18:00.000Z	Peeco	ikonia	that is strange, as i only just began investigating ubuntu yesterday!!
2007-12-28T20:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	I strongly advise you not to do that
2007-12-28T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	that install will not be supported by the ubuntu community
2007-12-28T21:00:00.000Z	Peeco	ikonia	how come?
2007-12-28T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	because that is not an ubuntu install method so it's results will not be supported
2007-12-28T21:03:00.000Z	Peeco	ikonia	why is the guide in the ubuntu community documentation?
2007-12-28T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	because that is community solution, not an official ubuntu solution
2007-12-28T21:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	not by me
2007-12-28T21:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Peeco	I don't rate the method personally, but thats my personal opinion
2007-12-29T01:08:00.000Z	Peeco	ikonia	you were right!
