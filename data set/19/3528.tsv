2012-05-22T11:46:00.000Z	kane77		hi, I have large list of files, how do I get total of space taken?
2012-05-22T11:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	the s part means "only give me the total"
2012-05-22T11:49:00.000Z	kane77	DarwinSurvivor	well yes, but if I do du -hsc $(mylist_of_files) it fails because that's just too many arguments..
2012-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	don't tell it which files and it will just do the total of the current directory
2012-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	you can even do "du -hs /path/to/my/directory"
2012-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	kane77	DarwinSurvivor	these files are in different directories :/
2012-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	I've run that command on my ENTIRE home folder (over 600GB of stuff) without issue (took a while though :P)
2012-05-22T11:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	oh...
2012-05-22T11:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	are they the only files in those directories?
2012-05-22T11:51:00.000Z	kane77	DarwinSurvivor	nope, there's a ton of stuff there :)
2012-05-22T11:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	ok. May I ask what types of files these are, this seems like a fairly strange request
2012-05-22T11:53:00.000Z	kane77		well, we have web app and these are files that were marked as deleted in the database but are not physically deleted from filesystem..
2012-05-22T11:53:00.000Z	kane77	DarwinSurvivor	^^
2012-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	ah, ok. well, you could run "for i in $my_list_of_files; do ln -s $i; done" in an empty directory, then run "du -hsL" from that directory
2012-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	just make sure you don't have any spaces in your filenames. if you do, a "while read" loop should fix it
2012-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	kane77		Darwin4Ever, ok, got it.. cat undeleted_files | xargs du -s | cut -f 1 | awk '{total = total + $1}END{print total}'
2012-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	that would work as well
2012-05-22T11:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	but don't use cat, use xarg's "-a undeleted_files" argument instead
2012-05-22T11:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	kane77	and since you are checking files one at a time, the -s is pointless
