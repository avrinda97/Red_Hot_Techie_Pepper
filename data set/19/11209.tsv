2010-11-01T17:18:00.000Z	abhishek		*forgery
2010-11-01T17:19:00.000Z	abhishek		hmm the best suggestion i can give from my side is whatever you are trying to compile, compile it using cmake
2010-11-01T17:19:00.000Z	abhishek		introduce cmake headings
2010-11-01T17:20:00.000Z	abhishek		and in the cmake gui tool u can set the compilers and other binaries path to the default path of the ARM compiler
2010-11-01T17:20:00.000Z	abhishek		u getting me
2010-11-01T17:20:00.000Z	abhishek		?

2010-11-01T17:21:00.000Z	burhan	abhishek	what errors?
2010-11-01T17:23:00.000Z	abhishek	burhan	Error: ./default_policy.sh does not support version
2010-11-01T17:24:00.000Z	abhishek	burhan	did u see the errors
2010-11-01T17:24:00.000Z	burhan	abhishek	yeah, seems you can't run whatever that version is on your current linux version.
2010-11-01T17:25:00.000Z	burhan	abhishek	well, until its upgraded to support your version :)
2010-11-01T17:25:00.000Z	abhishek	burhan	but i am actually using a lower version of fglrx , the higher version is supported and the lower is not
2010-11-01T19:01:00.000Z	burhan	abhishek	it means your provider doesn't have proper data coverage.
2010-11-01T19:02:00.000Z	abhishek	burhan	okay, even if its 100% in my phone ??
2010-11-01T19:04:00.000Z	burhan	abhishek	yes, voice and data coverage are on different frequency bands and channels, so even if you have 100 voice coverage, you may not have data coverage.
