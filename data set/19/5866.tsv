2008-04-25T04:28:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	what is your problem?
2008-04-25T04:31:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	 i-ve installed ubuntu but when start to boot. grub tell me the 21 error :S
2008-04-25T04:31:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	fresh install? upgrade? is it on its own HD/ sharing the HD with another operating syste,?
2008-04-25T04:31:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	fresh install, and it-s windows over sda1, the first partition
2008-04-25T04:34:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	can you get into windows at all or is your computer in a basically useless state?
2008-04-25T04:36:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	 no, i can-t use the PC, the menu of grub doesn-t appear
2008-04-25T04:37:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	ok, obviously something went wrong with the installer configuring grub... it happens and is highly annoying. I can help you get XP back to a bootable state, however, I'm not enough of a grub wizard to guide you how to fix the problem and allow you to boot into XP or Ubuntu.
2008-04-25T04:38:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	i was thinking if i can-t install correctly grub, i going to reinstall windows xp, to recover one OS at lesat
2008-04-25T04:38:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	I can attempt to play grub wizard if you'd like... I just can't guarantee I can fix it.
2008-04-25T04:39:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	you don't have to reinstall XP; all you need is a win XP install disk, from the recovery console you can fix the MBR and you'll be ok
2008-04-25T04:39:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	what is grub wizard_
2008-04-25T04:39:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	someone who knows lots about grub
2008-04-25T04:43:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	I tink I might have something for you to help... hold on a min
2008-04-25T04:43:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	ok
2008-04-25T04:45:00.000Z	bingofuel	nibsa1242b	you-re saying that i have to install the 32 bits version_
2008-04-25T04:46:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	that was for someone else... there is nothing wrong with 64 bit version, however, most people I know and myself prefer the 32 bit version for ease of use
2008-04-25T04:47:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	anyhow... http://www.supergrubdisk.org/ should help you boot
2008-04-25T04:48:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	bingofuel	you'll need to download the CDROM or USB version
