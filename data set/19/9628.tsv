2008-03-02T00:03:00.000Z	joh6nn	eifzon	try your chroot command with sudo
2008-03-02T00:03:00.000Z	eifzon	joh6nn	what you mean?
2008-03-02T00:04:00.000Z	joh6nn	eifzon	are you new to Ubuntu?

2008-03-02T00:04:00.000Z	joh6nn	eifzon	i just mean that chroot is a command that's usually run by the root user, so that in Ubuntu, you'll need to use sudo to run chroot

2008-03-02T00:05:00.000Z	joh6nn	eifzon	no
2008-03-02T00:05:00.000Z	joh6nn	eifzon	what is the command that you are running, that gives you the error?

2008-03-02T00:06:00.000Z	joh6nn	eifzon	yes, but can you paste in the exact command?
