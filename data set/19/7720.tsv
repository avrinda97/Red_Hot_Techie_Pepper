2007-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	Nyle		this is a load of garbage.  Ubuntu doesn't even have mp3 support by default?
2007-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Correct.
2007-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Well, a lot of thought went into that decision. if you can't be bothered to run one command to enable it, perhaps ubuntu isn't for you.
2007-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	During the time you've complained about it here, you could have enabled it :-D
2007-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	Nyle	Stormx2	I've been maintaining packages for debian for a while.  I've been using linux since 1995.  Try not to tell me whats for me and what isn't. astro76 thank you :)
2007-07-18T07:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Yeah? Well people pick up different ethics, so stop whining about it.
2007-07-18T07:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Take your own advice. Whining about ubuntu's default packages isn't support. bring it to #ubuntu-offtopic.
2007-07-18T07:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Okay. In future, a simple "How do I enable MP3 support in ubuntu?" would suffice. If you want to get into the reasons, try #ubuntu-offtopic ^_^
2007-07-18T07:06:00.000Z	Nyle	Stormx2	I installed ubntu restric extras p ackage and no mp3 yet
2007-07-18T07:07:00.000Z	Nyle	Stormx2	how do I enable mp3 support in ubuntu 7.094?
2007-07-18T07:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Check the page :)
2007-07-18T07:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	There's a nice fix-all-media command there.
2007-07-18T07:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	Also note that not all applications use gstreamer, and that your specific media player may use libmad, or xine, or something.
2007-07-18T07:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	I'll do a google search for you.
2007-07-18T07:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	You need this package: gstreamer0.8-mad
2007-07-18T07:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	I assume you're familiar with apt-get, seeing as you're from a debian background
2007-07-18T07:10:00.000Z	Nyle	Stormx2	you are correct sir
2007-07-18T07:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	Nyle	And it doesn't work?
2007-07-18T07:10:00.000Z	Nyle	Stormx2	not yet
