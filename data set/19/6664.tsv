2008-01-28T05:44:00.000Z	syntaxerror55		There's a major typo on http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour, "If you are upgrading from Ubuntu 7.04, we have special easy to follow upgrade instructions."
2008-01-28T05:45:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	what's the typo?
2008-01-28T05:46:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	michalski: special easy
2008-01-28T05:46:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	read 'we have special, easy-to-follow upgrade instructions'
2008-01-28T05:47:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	but there's no comma.
2008-01-28T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	according to most style guides I know, the comma would be optional in this place.
2008-01-28T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	I agree it's not beautiful English, but it's not a typo.

2008-01-31T06:00:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	I'm a bit behind on the times, then
2008-01-31T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	it's certainly not thanks to Adobe and their backwards support policy ;)
2008-01-31T06:02:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	Still, I don't recommend the AMD64, because other apps don't work that I can't remember as I've never used AMD64 Ubuntu, just seen people complain here.
2008-01-31T06:03:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	it used to be a real issue. With gutsy, it still takes a bit of trickery, but everything so far has worked for me, including googleearth and skype, all owing to the work of the good Medibuntu people
2008-01-31T06:03:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	ah, I'm still using Dapper. I'm sorry
2008-01-31T06:04:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	what for ;)
2008-02-02T02:48:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	Obviously not.
2008-02-02T02:49:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	care to elaborate?
2008-02-02T02:50:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	it's a hack, it is using two architectures. While I would recommend it, the Ubuntu team probably would not.
2008-03-09T22:39:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	soundray	sorry, but it just struck me as an odd one. :|
2008-03-09T22:39:00.000Z	soundray	syntaxerror55	I agree with you, and I didn't mean to criticize
