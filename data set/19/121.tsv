2012-08-29T17:21:00.000Z	captine		hi all.  i am really struggling to understand what my issue is with ubuntu and my wifi.  I am connected to wireless at 100MB/s yet transfer to the usb drive which is connected to the router is almost at dialup modem speed.  refer http://i.imgur.com/6pggC.png .  only 2 computers connected to the network, and my wifes is not using internet other than google docs she is workin on
2012-08-29T17:22:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	 Sorry to ask as you probably have already checked, but is this issue only on ubuntu or have you checked from other computers with windows?
2012-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	macbook is much quicker.  going about 2-3MB/s
2012-08-29T17:27:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	both computers connected to the 2.4GHz of the router.  is a Netgear WNDR3700V2, so should be pretty capable.
2012-08-29T17:28:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	Try connecting your ubuntu computer to the router with an ethernet cable to see if the issue isolates to your wireless card
2012-08-29T17:29:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	Cable is going at 7.2MB/s
2012-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	1 minute to transfer file.  I am using broadcom proprietary driver on Acer 4655G
2012-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	so must be the wifi.  could it be linked to power saving on the wifi when on battery?  let me plug into power to test
2012-08-29T17:32:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	the problem is interesting, I'm assuming you have no issues downloading things that are not local to your network, like a torrent or something?
2012-08-29T17:32:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	internet was a little slow.  just plugged into power, and now the file transfer on wifi is 3.3MB/s
2012-08-29T17:32:00.000Z	captine		which is massive improvement
2012-08-29T17:34:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	research a way to disable the power saver on your wifi, not optimal but I'm not sure otherwise, maybe submit a bug report in the meantime, but boot into windows to test it first
2012-08-29T17:35:00.000Z	BebopSteve		could just be an issue with that particular model
2012-08-29T17:36:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	Thanks.  I bought my machine without Windows, to prove to my wife that Ubuntu can work for day to day needs (she uses a Mac).  will look into the powersave
2012-08-29T17:37:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	and you must win!  the wife must not know of the bug!
2012-08-29T17:37:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	I'm rooting for you :p
2012-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	captine	BebopSteve	agree...  but i had to borrow the mac to test the transfer... so too late.  I just wish nvidia would support optimus on my machine... would make things so much easier...
2012-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	BebopSteve		I heard about that while reading through the steam linux blog, sounds like a damn headache
2012-08-29T17:40:00.000Z	BebopSteve	captine	 If you find time, take a look here:  http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comments  It may give you some insight or clues as to the optimus issues, there was some communication about it
