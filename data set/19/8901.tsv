2007-01-18T08:26:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	so whats the problem?
2007-01-18T08:27:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	ehe all cool i'm buggin ya.  however, ntfs read works fine
2007-01-18T08:27:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	The system sees my card, knows it's a wireless card, but doesn't make a node for it. It can read the files in an NTFS external hard drive but can't copy them.
2007-01-18T08:28:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	no idea, i just buy whats supported, plug it in and go.  infact i buy laptops install ubuntu and wiereless just works.
2007-01-18T08:29:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	By all logic wireless in this laptop SHOULD just work, especially with the degree to which this card is supported. Ubuntu comes with drivers automatically modprobed and firmware to boot!
2007-01-18T08:29:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	what card?
2007-01-18T08:30:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	Intel 3945.
2007-01-18T08:30:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	I've been working on it for well over two hours. Figured out that while the ipw3945 driver is probed, the card is recognized as a network device, the firmware is present, etc... There is no node created.
2007-01-18T08:31:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	Goodie. Newer means less functional. JOY.,
2007-01-18T08:32:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	the one thing about ubuntu is that a) it freezes off of debian unstable, and b) it releases every 6 months
2007-01-18T08:33:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	dapper is the FIRST thoroughly useable release imho
2007-01-18T08:33:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	I think you mean it releases every six months since Dapper. Breezy was around for a year, if I remember correctly.
2007-01-18T08:34:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	even, its always been 6 months
2007-01-18T08:34:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	Well, good to know. Shiny isn't always good. Time to go to trusty ol' Dapper.
2007-01-18T08:34:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	its worth a try
2007-01-18T08:34:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	Whee! Downgrade! :P
2007-01-18T08:35:00.000Z	Rosh_Keifer	holycow	No Beryl for this lappy, though. :(
2007-01-18T08:35:00.000Z	holycow	Rosh_Keifer	people complain about debians release cycle, after you have run something as bleeding edge as ubuntu you start to see WHY debians release cycle is awesome *qc*
