2011-02-01T08:59:00.000Z	maco	justinsane	less /proc/asound/cards
2011-02-01T09:00:00.000Z	maco	justinsane	wait a second...do you realise that jaunty jackalope isnt supported anymore?
2011-02-01T09:01:00.000Z	justinsane	maco	i have 10.10, i just like that name.
2011-02-01T09:01:00.000Z	justinsane	maco	why would my computer all of a sudden not detect my sound card? any freakin idea?
2011-02-01T09:01:00.000Z	maco	justinsane	did you upgrade to a new ubuntu release? or just do normal updates?
2011-02-01T09:01:00.000Z	maco	justinsane	and does it actually not list it in /proc/asound/cards ?
2011-02-01T09:02:00.000Z	justinsane	maco	installed 10.10 fresh
2011-02-01T09:04:00.000Z	justinsane	maco	it's not listed
2011-02-01T09:04:00.000Z	justinsane	maco	brb, restarting updates...
2011-02-01T09:04:00.000Z	maco	justinsane	is this a totally fresh install or a "installed it earlier then installed updates" install?
2011-02-01T09:17:00.000Z	justinsane	maco	did that to no avail!
