2012-04-30T12:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	faryshta	set it up, then run "tsocks applicaton_name" and tsocks will launch the application and cause all of its traffic to go through the proxy
2012-04-30T13:07:00.000Z	faryshta	DarwinSurvivor	I am having problems with tsocks. Malformed configuration pair on line 31 in configuration file, "server=127.0.0.1"

2012-04-30T13:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	faryshta	follow those instructions and let me know if you have issues
2012-04-30T13:13:00.000Z	faryshta	DarwinSurvivor	I followed the tsocks part as its written and still get the same errors. I think my problem is the tsocks.conf file.
