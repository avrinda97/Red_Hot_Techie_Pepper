2010-09-28T16:44:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	midori ?
2010-09-30T11:18:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	gvfs
2010-09-30T11:20:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	gnome virtual file system
2010-09-30T11:20:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	iirc it mounts stuff to  ~/.gvfs
2010-09-30T11:21:00.000Z	st__	icarus-c	it's empty
2010-09-30T11:21:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	have you mounted something (like a network share) with nautilus yet?
2010-09-30T11:22:00.000Z	st__	icarus-c	yes, it's open
2010-09-30T11:29:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	when you drag a file from nautilus to gnome-terminal, it should give you the path
2010-09-30T11:37:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	gvfs url?
2010-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	st__	icarus-c	ftp://, smb:// etc
2010-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	if those glib based applications  have support for gvfs, they will just open
2010-09-30T11:39:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	do those application support those protocol itself ?
2010-09-30T11:40:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	  when you mounted something with gvfs (like mounting  sftp, ftp, samba share, iso with nautilus)  they will be in  ~/.gvfs
2010-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	some people need certain advanced features, some doesn't.  GNOME, KDE wants features,  Xfce  wants to be lightweight.  does that explain something?
2010-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	st__	icarus-c	Windows 95 is ultra-lightweight but still has some Gnome features XFCE/LXDE/etc do not
2010-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	it is hard to balance features & lightweight :)
2010-09-30T13:55:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	that's why we have used dd :)
2010-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	icarus-c	st__	you could make symlink to /dev  .   like  ln  -s /dev/stdout  ~/stdout
