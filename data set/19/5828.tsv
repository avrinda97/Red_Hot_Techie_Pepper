2008-04-29T19:09:00.000Z	John_S	raymondjtoth	Is wlan0 even listed in your /etc/network/interfaces file? Excuse my interjecting.
2008-04-29T19:10:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	John_S	how i check this
2008-04-29T19:10:00.000Z	John_S	raymondjtoth	Just type: "more /etc/network/interfaces"
2008-04-29T19:12:00.000Z	John_S	raymondjtoth	"interfaces" is a text file, so if you "more /etc/network/interfaces", do you see wlan0 listed in there?

2008-04-29T19:14:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	John_S	all i see is auto lo
2008-04-29T19:14:00.000Z	John_S	raymondjtoth	Sounds like that's part of the problem. Join channel #raymondjtoth and I'll try to help you sort it out, OK?

2008-04-29T20:05:00.000Z	John_S	raymondjtoth	I'm sorry I can't help you--I tried and I have too hard of a time communicating with you. Maybe someone else can help you.
