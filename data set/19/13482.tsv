2005-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	mackid	universal	it should work.  check your xorg.conf, make sure nvidia is the driver
2005-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	mackid	universal	so X will run?
2005-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	universal	mackid	yes
2005-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	mackid	universal	go to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add under modules Load "glx"
2005-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	universal	mackid	im not going to run nv instead of Nvidia?
2005-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	mackid	universal	you shouldn't have to, if your xorg.conf is set up correctly
2005-04-07T15:41:00.000Z	mackid	universal	i have to go.  I will be back in 30-45 minutes, if you are still having a problem i will help you then
2005-04-07T15:41:00.000Z	universal	mackid	ok i will do that, but is it normal that there is a XF86Config-4 in /etc/X11/xorg??
2005-04-07T15:42:00.000Z	mackid	universal	no, that's not normal, if you're running hoary...
2005-04-07T15:42:00.000Z	universal	mackid	no!
