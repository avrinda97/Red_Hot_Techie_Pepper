2009-02-09T01:55:00.000Z	pronoy		i am in line :)
2009-02-09T01:57:00.000Z	pronoy		taking a cue from nickrud .....i have installed ubuntu in windows and i am not able to access the rest of the drive in which i have installed it..how do i access the content ?
2009-02-09T01:57:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	wubi?
2009-02-09T01:57:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	You want to access Windows drive from your Ubuntu install?
2009-02-09T01:58:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	yes....the same drive in which ubuntu is installed in
2009-02-09T01:58:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	It should be mounted on /host/
2009-02-09T01:59:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	why doesn't it show on the side....like why doesn't it show like the rest of the drives
2009-02-09T01:59:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	Oh, that is b/c of the way Wubi does the mounting. The host drive is mounted, and then the ext3 parittion is mounted off the host drive
2009-02-09T02:00:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	so the drive in which i have installed ubuntu is taken off the /host/
2009-02-09T02:01:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	Yeah. On system startup, one of the first things that is done is, mount your NTFS drive on /host. Then your entire / is mounted from /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk, so basically, /host is guarunteed to be there and mounted all the time your ubuntu is running
2009-02-09T02:02:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	can i do it using a gui like ntfsconf or something
2009-02-09T02:02:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	What do you want to do?
2009-02-09T02:02:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	to mount it automatically on startup
2009-02-09T02:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	It is automatically done. If that wasn't done, your ubuntu couldn't have even gone to the loading screen :)
2009-02-09T02:03:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	ok so then i'll have to remount it on /host/
2009-02-09T02:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	pronoy	Wubi sets up all this mounting thing automatically.. You don't need to remount anything. Just goto nautilus and browse to /host, it should be there
2009-02-09T02:06:00.000Z	pronoy	WebcamWonder	thanks i'll give it a shot
