2008-09-08T01:04:00.000Z	enhazed		i need to brb, phone.
2008-09-08T01:06:00.000Z	enhazed		ok... back. do you think there's anything that can be done? i have no idea why my windows connection is weird. my provider set that up
2008-09-08T01:08:00.000Z	enhazed		the traceroute was from this machine, not the one running ubuntu
2008-09-08T01:08:00.000Z	enhazed		i have windows up on the dual-boot machine now, so i can do a traceroute there if you want
2008-09-08T01:09:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	sure
2008-09-08T01:10:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	www.google.com will do
2008-09-08T01:22:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	well, from what I can tell linux can't add the default route because the network the gateway belongs to is not assigned anywhere
2008-09-08T01:24:00.000Z	enhazed	MrKennie_	- i'll go retry to add the gateway
2008-09-08T01:24:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	rememember to change the netmask first and see if you get any errors
2008-09-08T01:25:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	er, see if you get any errors when adding the route
2008-09-08T01:27:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	first change netmask to 255.255.252.0
2008-09-08T01:28:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	then run ifconfig to verify the changes have been applied.
2008-09-08T01:28:00.000Z	enhazed	MrKennie_	- ok. going to do that now.
2008-09-08T01:30:00.000Z	enhazed	MrKennie_	& guntbert - it worked
2008-09-08T01:30:00.000Z	enhazed	MrKennie_	& guntbert - i mean, my internet is working on the linux machine now. have no idea why. thank you VERY much!!
2008-09-08T01:32:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	by changing the netmask?
2008-09-08T01:32:00.000Z	enhazed	MrKennie_	- yes
2008-09-08T01:32:00.000Z	MrKennie_	enhazed	excellent
