2009-05-30T01:57:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	try the gparted tool
2009-05-30T01:57:00.000Z	linuxghost	ikonia	im there but there is no option to increase partition just to decresase
2009-05-30T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	you can only increase it if you have unallocated space free
2009-05-30T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	you can't resize your disk unless you have unallocated space
2009-05-30T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	drop tha attitude - people are trying to help
2009-05-30T02:03:00.000Z	linuxghost	ikonia	look this http://imagebin.ca/view/vb4M_Xp5.html
2009-05-30T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	you have no unallocated space
2009-05-30T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	you're also working within the confines of an extended partition
2009-05-30T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	you'd have to delete your ubuntu partition as your extended partition is only 20 gig
2009-05-30T02:05:00.000Z	linuxghost	ikonia	then if i delete it and re-install may i be able to resize xp partition?
2009-05-30T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	if you delete your ubuntu partition THEN resize XP, THEN re-install with more space free, it will work
2009-05-30T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	keep in mind you only have 1gb free on your XP partition
2009-05-30T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	so you won't be able to shrink your XP install
2009-05-30T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	you won't be able to, there is not enough free space to re-size
2009-05-30T02:07:00.000Z	linuxghost	ikonia	it means i need to format all my hdd?
2009-05-30T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	linuxghost	or free up space on your XP install
2009-05-30T02:09:00.000Z	linuxghost	ikonia	,and everyone who helped me thanks
