2008-08-16T01:19:00.000Z	Mecha25		sinn3rman: does the non GUI version work?
2008-08-16T01:19:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	it's such a pain to set up, no i haven't tried.
2008-08-16T01:20:00.000Z	Mecha25		well, if you can get that going, you should be able to tell whether it's a problem with the GUI, your phone, or the program itself.
2008-08-16T01:20:00.000Z	Mecha25		a lot of times, the base program works fine, but the GUI causes problems
2008-08-16T01:20:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	cyphase: it's like, displaying most of it in chinese characters. and all that stuff was in english.
2008-08-16T01:20:00.000Z	Mecha25		sinn3rman: you're using an english based version of Ubuntu, right?
2008-08-16T01:20:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	well, like i said, it retrieves everything fine, even the numbers from the text messages, just not the alphabets themselves.
2008-08-16T01:21:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	yes, of course.
2008-08-16T01:21:00.000Z	Mecha25		sinn3rman: hm,... sounds like a problem with ascii vs unicode
2008-08-16T01:21:00.000Z	Mecha25		is there a setting to switch between the two in wammu
2008-08-16T01:21:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	that's what i was thinking as well, no, not that i know of.
2008-08-16T01:22:00.000Z	Mecha25		sinn3rman: not sure how to help you, I just USB tether my phone to my comp, shows up like any external drive
2008-08-16T01:23:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	well, i had a spare bluetooth dongle :D. and the phone i needed to transfer something from. thought i'd try it in hardy. it hadn't worked in gutsy.
2008-08-16T01:23:00.000Z	Mecha25	Sinn3rman	try the command line version, what was it called?
2008-08-16T01:23:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	gammu :D.
2008-08-16T01:24:00.000Z	Mecha25		try "man gammu" in terminal
2008-08-16T01:24:00.000Z	Mecha25		after installing it
2008-08-16T01:24:00.000Z	Sinn3rman		this is going to be painful, Mecha25.
2008-08-16T01:25:00.000Z	Sinn3rman	Mecha25	can i msg you for a sec?!
