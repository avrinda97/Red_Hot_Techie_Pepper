2010-08-09T17:41:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	The last step of the installation there's a button 'advanced' that's where you change the grub install location from sda to sdb or whatever.
2010-08-09T17:43:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Try the lice CD install and see if you can put grub on the correct drive.

2010-08-09T17:43:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	It's the last step. The "Advanced" button right above "forward"
2010-08-09T17:45:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Do the setup again, make sure you don't let the setup dismount the external that's mounted. Manually select that external as the install "/" and then make sure the external is set as the location for grub to go...
2010-08-09T17:45:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Since you already did an install, it may have messed up the Win7 booter.
2010-08-09T17:46:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	I'm assuming you wanted the external to have grub on it and not overwrite teh Win7 boot loader?
2010-08-09T17:47:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	ok, you can fix the boot loader later, but for this next install, make sure you put grub on the external. it's the last step.
2010-08-09T17:47:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Then when you want to boot, make sure the BIOS selects the USB drive. It'll detect grub there and boot.
2010-08-09T17:48:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	usually a windows repair boot CD.
2010-08-09T17:48:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Which is why we should get at least ubuntu running so we can make that CD
2010-08-09T17:50:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	There may be a way to just load grub on the external now. Not sure what method that is though. I just did a quick install when I messed it up the first time. (I loaded Ubuntu on a USB thumb drive.)
2010-08-09T17:51:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Different computers have different options. DEL, F2, F11. just keep rebooting, you'll see a message.
2010-08-09T17:52:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Then you just change the boot order so the USB is ffirst.
2010-08-09T17:52:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	May have a BIOS setting where it shows a spash screen instead of the BIOS details.
2010-08-09T17:56:00.000Z	Israfel	pietrubens	Something should show, odd BIOS. Just mash those F-keys on boot.
