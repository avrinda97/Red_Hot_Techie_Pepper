2005-06-30T11:50:00.000Z	DukGalNamu		hey anyone know how hard it would be to run a mac program (osx) in ubunut?
2005-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	Pretty easy if it is a script....
2005-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	Pretty complex if it is a binary executable....
2005-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	HermanDE	and if is a program like ... say.... photoshop?
2005-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	How much time do you have on your hands?
2005-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	And the follow up question...  Why not use something with a touch more painting power?
2005-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	Like the Great GIMP?
2005-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	Or Blender....
2005-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	I have never been in a graphics shop where they denied work because it was not done using an Adobe product....
2005-06-30T11:56:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	koffice
2005-06-30T11:56:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	WordPerfect.  (Yes the linux version is still available)

2005-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	12 seconds..  Geeze.  I have brand new DELL's that take 30 seconds to Launch Office 2003 Pro.. under Windows XP with 512 M Ram....
2005-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	HermanDE	well, you did get a dell
2005-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	Nope...  Not for me.  I tell people what they need.  Then they get caught up in a Dell marketing spin..
2005-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	HermanDE	dells are whores
2005-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	Sure..  The other side is that dells usually need replacing after a few years....
2005-06-30T12:02:00.000Z	HermanDE	DukGalNamu	More money for me...
