2011-06-20T00:20:00.000Z	Kayne_		For some reason the chat stopped working, I am back now
2011-06-20T00:20:00.000Z	Kayne_		no i did not
2011-06-20T00:21:00.000Z	Kayne_		[usr13] i can't find it
2011-06-20T00:21:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	Paste the output of fdisk -l  for us to see.
2011-06-20T00:25:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	 Must be /dev/sdb  Right?
2011-06-20T00:27:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	Do you know what the FAT32 drive is that has only one partition on it?  (Which is only a 16 gig HD)?
2011-06-20T00:28:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	Is it still plugged in?
2011-06-20T00:33:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	unplug it and plug it back in again.  Issue command "cat /var/log/messages"  and then put the last 15 or 20 lines of the ouptut on http://paste.ubuntu.com
2011-06-20T00:34:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	Without quotes
2011-06-20T00:38:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	So what you really have here is a Ubuntu system that you are running from a USB drive?
2011-06-20T00:39:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	Ok. There it is.  It is [logically] sdc   And it says: " Unrecovered read error
2011-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	The drive is not readable.  That is why you are unable to mount it.  The drive has a problem.
2011-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	"... read error"
2011-06-20T00:41:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	If you do not have the tools or expertise, go to someone that does.
2011-06-20T00:43:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	aaahhhh, that is good information.  Hold that thought. Tell the tech when you hand him the drive. That may be a clue that will help him to help you.
2011-06-20T00:44:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	And next time, upgrade to Ubuntu   :):):)
2011-06-20T00:46:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	You have quite a bit of resources (here and elswhere) to solve Linux/Ubuntu problems.  Much of the problems you have with MS Windows are a bit more of a chore to solve, (as is the one you have now).
2011-06-20T00:47:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	you might try the folks at  ##windows
2011-06-20T00:49:00.000Z	usr13	Kayne_	You are running Ubuntu Linux on a 16gig thumb drive?  You have a 1500 gig drive in your computer?  hummmm.... I wonder... wait.... maybe you could bust up the 1500 gig drive and install Ubuntu on it?  Yes that might work :)
