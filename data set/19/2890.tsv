2009-12-02T02:38:00.000Z	greg_B		folks.
2009-12-02T02:39:00.000Z	greg_B		here is a curiosity:  when I try to download or open ODT files from webDAV, it fails.
2009-12-02T02:39:00.000Z	greg_B		but if I try and open a DOC file, it works.
2009-12-02T02:39:00.000Z	greg_B		If I rename the ODT file as a DOC file, it works.
2009-12-02T02:40:00.000Z	greg_B		so somewhere webdav is discriminating against the ODT file *extension*.
2009-12-02T02:40:00.000Z	greg_B		ideas?
2009-12-02T02:40:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	check out http://wiki.apache.org/lenya/HowToEditWithWebDAV
2009-12-02T02:44:00.000Z	greg_B	^workman^	 I am not sure that addresses my situation
2009-12-02T02:44:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	this? http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=41455
2009-12-02T02:46:00.000Z	greg_B	^workman^	 I had seen that.  I would love to be able to edit files in the webdav directly, but I'd settle for being able to download a copy.
2009-12-02T02:47:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	what are the permissions of the file? does the webserver have read access to it?
2009-12-02T02:53:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	are you creating OO files and storing them on a server running webdav? Then trying to download them via webdav?
2009-12-02T02:54:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	from home are you also wanting to write to the file?
2009-12-02T02:55:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	I bet the mime type of the odt isn't supported, but that's just a guess
2009-12-02T02:56:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	you could try adding "AddType doc/odt .odt" to httpd.conf
2009-12-02T02:57:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	or  play around and read http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_mime.html#addtype
2009-12-02T02:58:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	np... good luck
2009-12-02T03:01:00.000Z	greg_B	^workman^	 what is the filename you suggested I modify?
2009-12-02T03:01:00.000Z	^workman^	greg_B	/etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf
