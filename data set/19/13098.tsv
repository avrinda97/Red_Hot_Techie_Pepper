2005-05-22T12:24:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	windows did not get market share by standardization....they got it by forcing people to buy windows when they buy hardwares.
2005-05-22T12:25:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	yes of course..but they are both accurate statements
2005-05-22T12:25:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	it is not a standardization issue....it is a supplier issue.
2005-05-22T12:25:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	what always semms to happen is the technician tries to install linux first and then has a problem so says...screw this, hand me the windows cd
2005-05-22T12:26:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	usually one excuteable works on whatever version of windows..with noteable exception sometimes with 'XP" lol...not so easy here
2005-05-22T12:26:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	no...that is not true....i have an executable of postgres that will not work on win98
2005-05-22T12:26:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	but apparently will work on win2k
2005-05-22T12:26:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	there is nothing standardized about windows either
2005-05-22T12:27:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	yeah there is..if a vendor writes an app he 'knows' what dll to expect to be there..not  true for .so all the time in distro xyz
2005-05-22T12:28:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	ie: not everyone 'adheres' to the LSB..and thats bad
2005-05-22T12:28:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	they can statically link if they are suspicious about that particular dll
2005-05-22T12:28:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	it is no problem to statically link just one of the dlls
2005-05-22T12:28:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	Yes i know
2005-05-22T12:29:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	but the problem is when these libs add extra parameters to functions....then the wrapper code no longer works
2005-05-22T12:29:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	it just creates problems when distrros ship various libs..thats why distros like symphonyOS are coming around the corner...
2005-05-22T12:29:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	because it expects fewer parameters
2005-05-22T12:29:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	and why 'klik' was produced
2005-05-22T12:29:00.000Z	krazykook	gaten	and doesn't know how to deal with the extra parameters
2005-05-22T12:30:00.000Z	gaten	krazykook	yes I agree its messy
