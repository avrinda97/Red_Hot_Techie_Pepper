2009-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	mrwes		Is it necessary to schedule a cron to run freshclam (clamav updater)? I see /usr/bin/freshclam -d -quiet already running
2009-03-27T07:26:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	anyreason to even run clam? are you scanning a windows partition?
2009-03-27T07:26:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	ahh
2009-04-11T06:07:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	unless he put them in /etc/hosts :)
2009-04-11T06:48:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	drowner k2pdf.com is antoehr one.  Or you can use word and convert them to pdf.
2009-04-11T06:49:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	right...I saw that one too
2009-04-11T06:49:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	that's a deep hole :)
2009-04-11T06:50:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	sebsebseb just wait till it floodbots and bans itself thats the best.
2009-04-25T00:23:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	er...sheit -- wrong channel sorry
2009-04-25T02:05:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	+1 on the alternate cd route
2009-04-25T02:25:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	can you mount the mini.iso and upgrade from that?
2009-04-25T02:25:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	that would be pointless.
2009-04-25T02:26:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	it would just download all thepackages
2009-04-25T02:27:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	guess I misunderstood it's purpose
2009-04-25T02:27:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	the point of the mini.iso ?
2009-04-25T02:27:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	you can install just the packages you need rather than downloading a 700mb cd.
2009-04-25T02:28:00.000Z	histo	mrwes	it also gives you the options of installing any version server ... client ... etc...
2009-04-25T02:28:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	ok... so you can add what WM, an apps you want
2009-04-25T02:28:00.000Z	mrwes	histo	I understand now
