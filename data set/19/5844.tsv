2011-04-25T05:14:00.000Z	ryan		so when I D/L something from the net ... like a .tar should I unzip it and then run that command on it?
2011-04-25T05:15:00.000Z	ryan		well how do I know the names of the packages I want to install? So it looks like I have the source code versions of the programmings I downloaded
2011-04-25T05:16:00.000Z	smw	ryan	what are you trying to do?
2011-04-25T05:20:00.000Z	smw	ryan	for eclipse mods, doesn't eclipse have its own package manager
2011-04-25T05:22:00.000Z	smw	ryan	this is why we have the software center
2011-04-25T05:22:00.000Z	smw	ryan	it is a gui to using apt get which is easier to search.
2011-04-25T05:24:00.000Z	smw	ryan	what you downloaded. Did it have a README or INSTALL file?
2011-04-25T05:27:00.000Z	smw	ryan	can you give me a link to what you are installing?
2011-04-25T05:28:00.000Z	smw	ryan	btw, I meant the INSTALL/README file should be found in the compressed archive (tar file)
2011-04-25T05:30:00.000Z	smw	ryan	did you take a look at their site? http://docs.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux
2011-04-25T05:31:00.000Z	smw	ryan	if you have problems following that guide, feel free to ask questions
2011-04-25T05:32:00.000Z	smw	ryan	damn, you are right, this is not very beginner friendly
2011-04-25T05:33:00.000Z	smw	ryan	maybe this is easier. http://docs.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Plugging_Aptana_into_an_existing_Eclipse_configuration
2011-04-25T05:34:00.000Z	smw	ryan	the reason you feel that way is because the instructions were made for developers and not people :-\
2011-04-25T05:34:00.000Z	smw	ryan	that is the right way.
2011-04-25T05:35:00.000Z	smw	ryan	installing as an eclipse plugin is probably the best way.
2011-04-25T05:35:00.000Z	smw	ryan	the way they explained was much more hackish than the eclipse plugin.
2011-04-25T05:36:00.000Z	smw	ryan	depends on what stuff you are referring to. None of this had to do with the package manager
2011-04-25T05:36:00.000Z	smw	ryan	before you were asking a general question and getting a general response. the package manager was NOT the right way to handle this.
