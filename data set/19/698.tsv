2011-10-11T15:22:00.000Z	TehDGM		the only g+ i love is g++.
2011-10-11T15:24:00.000Z	TehDGM		are you actually logged in as root on your gui?
2011-10-11T15:24:00.000Z	TehDGM		never do that.
2011-10-11T15:25:00.000Z	TehDGM		how did you sudo su out of root anyway? Wouldnt that just change the user for that specific console?
2011-10-11T15:25:00.000Z	TehDGM		basicly causing no effect if you close it again
2011-10-11T15:25:00.000Z	TehDGM		log out completely, reboot or whatever, and never log in as root :P
2011-10-11T15:27:00.000Z	TehDGM		no dont try that..
2011-10-11T15:29:00.000Z	TehDGM		funny thing is, when i'm on windows i'm always administrator. gotta love double standards
