2006-04-21T15:04:00.000Z	blazemonger		interesting
2006-04-21T15:05:00.000Z	blazemonger		mm.if im having probs with running games in full screen mode would recompiling the kernel be reccomended?
2006-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	blazemonger		my card is a ati rage 128
2006-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	blazemonger		like i dont see why a simple game like doom would crash.it runs perfect in windows
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	are you running the OpenGL version in Linux and the software rendered version in Windows?
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	GL takes a lot more power
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	the rage 128 is NOT a GL card
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	hmm
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	card overheating?
2006-04-21T15:08:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	which version of doom?
2006-04-21T15:10:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	there are more than one doom in the repositories
2006-04-21T15:10:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	prboom and lxdoom
2006-04-21T15:10:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	anyway, check the manual for whichever one you are running to see if there is a non-GL executable.
2006-04-21T15:11:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	but really, the best solution is to upgrade your video to a real OpenGL card.
2006-04-21T15:11:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	you can get a decent Radeon for like $50
2006-04-21T15:29:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	good
2006-04-21T15:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	so go back
2006-04-21T15:43:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	blazemonger	sure, but you sound hard to please.
