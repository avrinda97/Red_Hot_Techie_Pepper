2008-11-01T14:43:00.000Z	MrBougo		hello. I fear this is not the good place to ask, but I have no idea where to... Is there any way to make a window go fullscreen automatically?
2008-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	MrBougo		at the moment I'm using some weird combination of sleep and wmctrl to set some fullscreen flag on a window 2 seconds after it's been launched
2008-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	lianimator	MrBougo	are you using compiz? if so, it's easy.

2008-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	MrBougo	lianimator	actually, I was wondering if there was such a feature for metacity
