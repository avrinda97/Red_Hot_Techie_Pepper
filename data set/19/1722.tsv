2010-10-31T07:13:00.000Z	aut0tek		why won't my 10.10 run a binary file even after I chmod +x ?
2010-10-31T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	pastebin exactly what you are doing and the output your receive in its entirety
2010-10-31T07:15:00.000Z	aut0tek	jrib	it's a binary file named adb. I type: "./adb" and get: bash: ./adb: No such file or directory
2010-10-31T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	you need to do what I asked for me to help you
2010-10-31T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	paste.ubuntu.com is an example of a pastebin.  I need you to include all of your commands
2010-10-31T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	if you prefer, I can randomly guess
2010-10-31T07:17:00.000Z	aut0tek	jrib	no thanks, buddy. Maybe someone else won't require pastebin
2010-10-31T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	k, good luck with your issue.
2010-10-31T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	not what I asked.  I just ask for a pastebin because then we don't spend 10 exchanges trying to get you to show me exactly what you did and exactly what the output was.
2010-10-31T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	look, you're asking for help.  If this makes it possible for me to help you, why don't you just do it.  If you don't want to that's fine, we can move on to doing other things
2010-10-31T07:21:00.000Z	aut0tek	jrib	Merry Christmas http://paste.ubuntu.com/523054/
2010-10-31T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	what is "adb"?
2010-10-31T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	what exactly is it?  Did you create it?
2010-10-31T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	"what exactly is it?"
2010-10-31T07:30:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	I don't need the filetype.  I need to know what "adb" is.  I have to ask you things like 5 times before you answer them, I'm not sure why
2010-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	aut0tek	jrib	if you scroll up, I've told you. twice.
2010-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	all you've said is it's some sort of binary file.  The easier you make it for us to help you, the more likely we can help you...
2010-10-31T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	aut0tek	maybe I can rephrase it for you.  How would I get this "adb" myself?
2010-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	aut0tek	jrib	Like I said, if I have to pastebin 2 lines for you... I doubt I'm gonna meet your other demands prior to helping. helping someone usually doesn't come with a set of rules, but you can be an assbag all you want. it's a binary executable that bash isn't running for some reason... that's about all the information that could possibly be required to help. May God help you become satisfied with your life, as you obviously aren't
