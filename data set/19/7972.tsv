2010-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	I installed it on 'all' of them
2010-06-10T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bricky	If you read carefully, it says to install to all *drives*. It doesn't hurt to install to the partitions, they will just be ignored (unless you had windows on one of those partitions, in which case it's now unbootable)
2010-06-10T09:21:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	no windows
2010-06-10T09:22:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	I will install windows on my 80 GB , so I did the right thing by installing on all?
2010-06-10T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bricky	No, you almost never want to install grub to a partition rather than the MBR. It just hasn't done any damage if you don't use windows.
2010-06-10T09:25:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	I dont
2010-06-10T09:26:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	but is it possible to find out if it works before reboot?
2010-06-10T09:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bricky	Not easily.
2010-06-10T09:28:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	well, I sure hope it will boot then,
2010-06-10T09:28:00.000Z	bricky	Jordan_U	if it dont im gonna have a fit, I have to migrate my HDD to install another OS
