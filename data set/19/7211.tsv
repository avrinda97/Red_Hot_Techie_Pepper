2007-10-24T16:47:00.000Z	loca|host		i want to have more than two workspaces, i can't add a third one, how can it be possible ?
2007-10-24T16:47:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	right click on the workspace icon, then preference
2007-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	that's the problem, i can set it to whatever i want, but it will allways be only two workspaces
2007-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	that's odd... i just tested mine and works, i'm also using the smallest panel
2007-10-24T16:51:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	have you named the first and the second workspace to anything?
2007-10-24T16:52:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	no, didnt know it's nameable
2007-10-24T16:52:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	but am enabling compiz otherwize
2007-10-24T16:52:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	where it says "show all current workspace in row" make sure it says 1
2007-10-24T16:53:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	sure it is
2007-10-24T16:54:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	it's not checked at "show only the current workspace" right?
2007-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	i havent that option, i have only the number of columns and number of rowns, nothing else
2007-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	are you using gutsy 7.10?
2007-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	i've just upgraded from feisty
2007-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	loca|host		:)
2007-10-24T17:00:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	the version of gnome is 2.20
2007-10-24T17:00:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	2.20.0.1
2007-10-24T17:00:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	yeah I'm using the same one... I'm trying to look for some answers on google right now
2007-10-24T17:01:00.000Z	lavender_dream	loca|host	trying to see if there is a manual way to set it instead of using the gui in gnome
2007-10-24T17:01:00.000Z	loca|host	lavender_dream	me too
