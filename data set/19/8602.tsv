2007-03-07T10:41:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	rm?
2007-08-22T11:04:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	just boot to the cd and install
2007-08-22T11:04:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	It says that it can't load a module for the cdrom drive
2007-08-22T11:04:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	what version of ubuntu are you trying to install?
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	7.04 the ubuntu-studio version
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	ahh well you may have to ask the studio folks but you might need the alternate iso.
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	what does it do after you receive the module error?
2007-08-22T11:05:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	i believe its based off the alternate iso
2007-08-22T11:06:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	is it a text based installer?
2007-08-22T11:06:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	it just goes to a screen saying instillation can't continue
2007-08-22T11:06:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	yes text based well.....like a dos based looking thing
2007-08-22T11:06:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	go to the next step and tell it to continue.  I used to have that issue on one of my old boxes.
2007-08-22T11:07:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	ok i'll try it
2007-08-22T11:19:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	ok yeah that didn't work
2007-08-22T11:19:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	shows there is like not cdrom drive or something
2007-08-22T11:39:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	Yeah its definitly not working. It just says there is no cdrom installed. I'm not sure why this drive would need any special module though
2007-08-22T11:40:00.000Z	h1st0	Dougie	hrm... maybe you need drivers for it but you shouldnt' that just wierd.  Possibly search the forums for your cdrom type
2007-08-22T11:41:00.000Z	Dougie	h1st0	yeah i tried searching the forums. It's a Toshiba usb HD-DVD rom drive...but works just like any other dvd drive anywhere else
