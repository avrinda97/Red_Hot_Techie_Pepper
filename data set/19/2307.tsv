2010-05-18T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	no just
2010-05-18T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	I remember someone having a kate and greasemonkey issue, I guess it was you
2010-05-18T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	anyway since Kate is a KDE app  #kubuntu is a good channel to try, but you can also continue here  trying to get help for your issue
2010-05-18T05:09:00.000Z	Luija1006	sebsebseb	I think I dont need going to that channel, I think I just need someones who tell me how I can install another language
2010-05-18T05:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	system > preferences > regional settings   in this distro anyway, maybe in Ubuntu as well
2010-07-06T10:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	commercial DVD's?
2010-07-06T10:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	ok you need libdvdcss2/3
2010-07-06T10:32:00.000Z	Luija1006	sebsebseb	after that i restart and I will be able to read dvds?
2010-07-06T10:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Luija1006	restart?  uhmm  you only need to restart a Linux distro for major packages, such as a new kernel
2010-07-06T10:34:00.000Z	Luija1006	sebsebseb	dvds still not wanting to show
