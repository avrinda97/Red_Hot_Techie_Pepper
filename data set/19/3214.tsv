2009-09-28T09:36:00.000Z	korin43		just http://appname won't work because it won't point to your computer (dns)
2009-09-28T09:37:00.000Z	korin43		and http://localhost/appname won't work because that's not how virtual hosts work (I think)
2009-09-28T09:37:00.000Z	korin43		oh
2009-09-28T09:38:00.000Z	korin43		and /var/www/appname exists?
2009-09-28T09:38:00.000Z	korin43		it may be that one of your virtual hosts is higher priority than whatever is looking /var/www
2009-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	korin43		I'm having trouble explaining how it works, but each virtual host generally points to a different folder, and if you overwrote the default one and pointed it somewhere else, it won't work anymore
2009-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	korin43		or created a higher priority one than the default
2009-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	korin43		can I see your sites-available's?
2009-09-28T09:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	korin43	Look at some of the new features in karmic and see if any aren't documented yet
2009-09-28T09:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	korin43	network-manager-gnome could use some documentation
2009-09-28T09:56:00.000Z	korin43	Jordan_U	Good idea :)
2009-09-28T09:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	korin43	Specifically it would be nice if https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing included instructions for using network-manager's built in network sharing as it is MUCH easier than all of the other methods listed there
2009-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	korin43	Jordan_U	I was under the impression network manager could only have one active connection (so no sharing)
2009-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	korin43	Not since 0.7, it's just not documented :)
2009-09-28T10:00:00.000Z	korin43	Jordan_U	Ah :)
2009-09-28T10:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	korin43	Here is a video showing connection sharing from 2008: http://magazine.redhat.com/2008/10/16/video-fedora-10-connection-sharing/ it's the closest thing to "documentation" I have found for the feature
2009-09-28T10:02:00.000Z	korin43	Jordan_U	I'll see what I can do. The main problem with this is that I need to write at least 6 pages so I would need to write general documentation, but I think network-manager doesn't seem to have any
2009-09-28T10:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	korin43	At a guess 6 pages seems about right for documenting the network-manager GUI
