2008-09-10T00:08:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	there's some docs here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/EagleUsb
2008-09-10T00:09:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	sorry, ignore that. use this one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/ueagle-atm
2008-09-10T00:10:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	ok, thanks
2008-09-10T00:39:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	the eagle is problematic. I used it in Mandrake 8.2 (that was a long time ago) and it hasn't improved much. I would recommend to see in the french channel (#ubuntu-fr) and/or buy a cheap DSL modem or even a DSL router. Less headache.
2008-09-10T00:40:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	the french used it quite a bit a few years back
2008-09-10T00:40:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	I havd tried a BT Voyager 105 too with whatever driver that was, that wouldnt even sync - it just failed... I can't find my old Speedtouch
2008-09-10T00:41:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	I meant a non-usb modem
2008-09-10T00:41:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	I have a router, but the point of this is to drop the connection entirely onto my server
2008-09-10T00:42:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	if you have a router, how do you use the eagle usb modem?
2008-09-10T00:42:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	when I *try* to get the modem working, I unplug the router
2008-09-10T00:43:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	if you have a router you cannot use a usb modem together. non-usb-modem <-> router <-> computer
2008-09-10T00:43:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	I know, I want to eliminate the need for the router.
2008-09-10T00:44:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	ah. you found a bad replacement for it :)
2008-09-10T00:44:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	Unless I can find some good (PCI?) ADSL modem that will work under Ubuntu
2008-09-10T00:45:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	I recommend a stand alone DSL modem. Ethernet connected. You set up the connection settings in the modem, set your computer up for DHCP and  and off you go.
2008-09-10T00:46:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	Isn't that really what the router does :/
2008-09-10T00:47:00.000Z	Jowi	lee_	sorry I misunderstood. I thought you had a router without a modem in it.
2008-09-10T00:47:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	ah :)
2008-09-10T00:50:00.000Z	lee_	Jowi	I do have another router (that I do like), but I think it got overpowered once and the ADSL modem in that might actually be blown
