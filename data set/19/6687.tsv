2007-12-26T07:01:00.000Z	sat_		I've XP & Ubuntu. I'd like to install Nexenta (OpenSolaris). Can I install it without disturbing XP/Ubuntu. I'm worried as I'll be resizing the existing partitions.
2007-12-26T07:03:00.000Z	egc	sat_	i've done so without problem.  but i installed solaris express
2007-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	sat_	egc	cool. i'm trying Nexenta as it's similar to Ubuntu. so, resizing existing partitions won't affect Ubuntu/Xp, right?
2007-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	egc	sat_	well, you should back-up any important data before resizing a filesystem
2007-12-26T07:06:00.000Z	egc	sat_	but if you do so, you should be fine and able to recover in the event something goes wrong
2007-12-26T07:06:00.000Z	egc	sat_	fyi, opensolaris has a livecd now too
2007-12-26T07:07:00.000Z	sat_	egc	i tried live cd. but, i wanna try Nexenta (a distro of opensolaris).
2007-12-26T07:07:00.000Z	sat_	egc	Nexenta doesn't have live cd.
2007-12-26T07:08:00.000Z	sat_	egc	how was you experience with opensolaris
2007-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	egc	sat_	i liked it alot, i'll probably transition to it when it officially releases in april
2007-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	sat_	egc	okay, i'll try and share my experience later. hope you catch you on this forum.
2007-12-26T07:14:00.000Z	sat_	egc	Can I install ubuntu apps on OpenSolaris. for example, skpye is availabe for Ubuntu.
2007-12-26T07:16:00.000Z	egc	sat_	there are many opensource apps you can install; check out blastwave.org
2007-12-26T07:16:00.000Z	egc	sat_	also opensolaris comes with some, like pidgin, rhythmbox
2007-12-26T07:17:00.000Z	sat_	egc	i want skype due to video chat
2007-12-26T07:19:00.000Z	egc	sat_	yeah i like skype too, but i haven't tried installing it yet
2007-12-26T07:19:00.000Z	sat_	egc	no prob. i'll also try..
