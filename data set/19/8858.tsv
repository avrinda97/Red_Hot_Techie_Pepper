2007-03-06T09:06:00.000Z	gleamnite		Why is that IndyGunFreak?
2007-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	it makes me laugh.. i'm not saying questioning why they should do it, i'm saying, questioning if it will work before even trying it.
2007-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	gleamnite	IndyGunFreak	can you help me then? ;)
2007-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	maybe you misunderstood.
2007-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	i don't have a problem helping people
2007-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	gleamnite	IndyGunFreak	no, I understood. I was just playing. I need some help and I can't seem to get anyone's attention.
2007-03-06T09:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	if i can help, i gladly will.
2007-03-06T09:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	whats the malfunction?
2007-03-06T09:08:00.000Z	gleamnite	IndyGunFreak	I just installed ubuntu on my laptop, since I couldn't find my windows install disks, but now I can't get the laptop's wireless NIC to work.
2007-03-06T09:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	have you looked at the wireless wiki?.. i know VERY little about getting wireless up and running, sorry.
2007-03-06T09:09:00.000Z	gleamnite	IndyGunFreak	that's okay. I'll have a look =)
2007-03-06T09:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	ok...
2007-03-06T09:10:00.000Z	gleamnite	IndyGunFreak	I question your solution though. I just don't think it will work... haha ;)
2007-03-06T09:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	lol,
2007-03-06T09:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	any luck?
2007-03-06T09:42:00.000Z	gleamnite	IndyGunFreak	I'm at work at the moment so I can't actually try it. I think I have to use the NdisWrapper and pull the driver.exe apart... I'll look at it when I get home.
2007-03-06T09:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gleamnite	i think thats what i've saw people talked through several times here though
