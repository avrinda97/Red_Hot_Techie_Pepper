2006-11-20T13:04:00.000Z	`axion		hi can someone help me? ever since i removed ubuntu-desktop meta-package, apt-get wants to remove a bunch of critical packages, including glibc!...i can't use apt-get without it automatically removing packages needed for linux to work
2006-11-20T13:04:00.000Z	`axion		this didnt happen with dapper, please help
2006-11-20T13:06:00.000Z	`axion		does anyone know how to fix my apt-get?
2006-11-20T13:07:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	You may be able to massage the package selections list. try dpkg --get-selections > selections
2006-11-20T13:07:00.000Z	Creeture		then edit the file selections, look for anything that has 2nd column not "install"
2006-11-20T13:08:00.000Z	`axion	Creeture	thanks...I'll try
2006-11-20T13:08:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	Then, run dpkg --set-selections < selections
2006-11-20T13:08:00.000Z	Creeture		but be careful, make sure you use valid values.
2006-11-20T13:09:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	and make a backup of that "selections" file before you edit it. You can always roll back by reading in the old file.
2006-11-20T13:09:00.000Z	`axion	Creeture	what do i do if there is deinstall in the 2nd column for a package?
2006-11-20T13:09:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	That's the one that's effing up your apt. It thinks that you want to uninstall. Change it to "install" (or whatever the correct value is, you'll see it in there a hundred times)
2006-11-20T13:10:00.000Z	`axion	Creeture	i see 4 packages that are deinstall
2006-11-20T13:11:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	Change them to install. The run the "dpkg --set-selections < selections"
2006-11-20T13:11:00.000Z	Creeture		then run apt-get -f install
2006-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	`axion	Creeture	it still says the following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: and lists every package
2006-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	Do a "dpkg -l | grep -v "^ii""
2006-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	Creeture	`axion	I'll be back in about 10 minutes. Have to swap hardware back.
2006-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	Creeture		:(
2006-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	`axion	Creeture	ok it lists those 4 i changed
