2007-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	JoshJ		probably better to follow their instructions than to try what i have from memory
2007-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	JoshJ		(also check out compiz, you may want compiz instead of beryl)
2007-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	JoshJ		i think they've made it easier now than it was :P
2007-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	JoshJ		it's about 10 minutes to install i guess
2007-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	JoshJ		but i installed it way back in the .1 beta
2007-01-12T13:23:00.000Z	JoshJ		yeah, listen to pike_
2007-01-12T13:23:00.000Z	JoshJ		he sent you to the same site i was about to send you to :P
2007-01-12T13:24:00.000Z	JoshJ		i think he means beryl doesn't really add any functionality :P
2007-01-12T13:25:00.000Z	JoshJ		eh, the only real addition to usability i found was the ability to switch workspaces with the mouse, and uh the f9 key
2007-01-12T13:26:00.000Z	Skat	JoshJ	did you get Beryl working using XGL or AIGLX?
2007-01-12T13:26:00.000Z	JoshJ	Skat	i forget, where would i go to check?
2007-01-12T13:28:00.000Z	Skat	JoshJ	ok, I had to drop back to that, fglrx was a dog
2007-01-12T13:28:00.000Z	Skat	JoshJ	And xgl was so slow it was unusable
2007-01-12T13:28:00.000Z	JoshJ	Skat	: where would i check xgl vs aiglx?
2007-01-12T13:28:00.000Z	Skat	JoshJ	was hoping you may have found a way to make it work - I have a 9800Pro
2007-01-12T13:29:00.000Z	Skat	JoshJ	if you start beryl-manager from command line it has a look for what you've got and prints it in the terminal
2007-01-12T13:30:00.000Z	Skat	JoshJ	but basically unless you've installed xgl then you're not using it!
2007-01-12T13:30:00.000Z	JoshJ	Skat	yeah, i'm on AIGLX apparently
