2012-07-07T21:56:00.000Z	Ihsan_		Hello, am I right here for support?
2012-07-07T21:57:00.000Z	Ihsan_		I need a chat (support) with a Ubuntu professional because I got a weird problem. :)
2012-07-07T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	ask and the chanel will reply if it can
2012-07-07T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	What is the output of: lsb_release -sc
2012-07-07T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	then it comes with Gnome3 already...
2012-07-07T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	its part of the OS
2012-09-07T22:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	yes, ask away
2012-09-07T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	do you just want to use the other partition for data storage?
2012-09-07T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	patience child, you won't get a reply that fast
2012-09-07T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	then use gparted and delete the NTFS partition and reformat it to Ext4 and you can use it as data storage
2012-09-07T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	then you may need to ask in ##windows to find out how this can be accessed. Why do you not have a backup of the data?
2012-09-07T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/21580-63-recognize-bitlocker-disk-ubuntu   seems you will need another windows PC to access the data.
2012-09-07T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ihsan_	its a windows app so you wil need windows help
