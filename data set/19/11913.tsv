2006-06-07T16:15:00.000Z	danfg		wow, does anyone here use accentuation?
2006-06-07T16:17:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	what is up?
2006-06-07T16:18:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	something related to keyboard layouts with accentuation, but i guess english users don't ever accentuate anything :)
2006-06-07T16:18:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	do you want to type some?
2006-06-07T16:19:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	yes, i'm looking for the equivalent of windows' "US-International" keyboard layout, which is regular US keyboard, but with dead keys for accentuation, like `,~,'," and ^
2006-06-07T16:20:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	i guess you know system->settings-keyboard->layouts->add, right?
2006-06-07T16:22:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	yes, the "twist" is that i'm looking for that layout, but in dvorak :)
2006-06-07T16:23:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	play with xmodmap is all i can say as hint :)
2006-06-07T16:23:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	thanks, will look into it :)
2006-06-07T16:23:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	create a base .xmodmap with some app (i did that with xkeycaps before gnome got really cool) and edit it by hand
2006-06-07T16:24:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	any chance there's a pretty gui for that? :)
2006-06-07T16:24:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	best would to search whether the gnome layouts have xmodmap files attached somewhere :)
2006-06-07T16:25:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	xkeycaps is graphical, but old ;-)
2006-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	btw, the third tab in settings->keyboard does not have an option to activate dead keys?
2006-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	i'm looking into it, i'll get back to you. thanks a lot btw :)
2006-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	maybe there is a frontend for it, but basically you can perfectly write raw data to floppies with dd :)
2006-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	sorry
2006-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	andi5	danfg	good luck =)
2006-06-07T16:30:00.000Z	danfg	andi5	:)
