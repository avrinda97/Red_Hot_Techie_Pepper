2011-11-14T06:13:00.000Z	Icehawk78		I was attempting to upgrade the fglrx drivers on my laptop, and upon restart, 11.10 will no longer boot. I'm able to boot into Windows 7 on the same machine and access the grub config, but am not sure what I should start with to repair my installation. Any recommendations?
2011-11-14T06:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	is it a wubi install?
2011-11-14T06:14:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	No, fresh install on its own partition.
2011-11-14T06:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	how are you accessing the grub.config?
2011-11-14T06:15:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	I have ext4 drivers for Windows installed, so I can read/write to that partition, though I've not changed anything yet.
2011-11-14T06:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	so you have easybcd or grub in the mbr?
2011-11-14T06:16:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	Grub, and yes.
2011-11-14T06:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	actually easybcd would not be in the mbr, cool grub.
2011-11-14T06:16:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	I installed 11.10 from a live-usb second to ensure it would write the boot partition.
2011-11-14T06:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	so what happens when you choose ubuntu from the grub menu?
2011-11-14T06:19:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	Non-graphical boot process, eventually freezing after saying... some stuff about battery states, I think?
2011-11-14T06:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	I'm not really solid in this area, but I would think if you get to a cli and remove the fglrx drivers you would be in, I don't thin it is a grub problem.
2011-11-14T06:23:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	Any idea how to manually boot to a cli from grub? I removed all grub entries except the main "Boot 11.10" and "Boot Windows"
2011-11-14T06:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	try the recovery option in the grub menu, you can get there probably
2011-11-14T06:24:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	Recovery isn't in grub, that was removed
2011-11-14T06:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	you might try hitting e at the menu and inserting nomodeset right before no spash the hitting crtl-x to a cli then removing there, or trying start-x to get to the desktop.
2011-11-14T06:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	you can chroot from a live cd probably and remove it, I don't know how myself.
2011-11-14T06:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	Icehawk78	I'm assuming this will work at all as well.
2011-11-14T06:28:00.000Z	Icehawk78	urlin2u	Hey, it's more of a guess than I had :P
