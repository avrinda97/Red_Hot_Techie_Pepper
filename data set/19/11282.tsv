2006-02-27T07:12:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	its not for everybody but in some cases it works - in others you need to look at  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootOptions not the full complement of boot options but it is some of them
2006-02-27T10:24:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	do this "sudo -K" a few times and change the fix the battery time on your computer
2006-02-28T11:21:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	you are, :) what services are you running on the box that need protection?
2006-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	southern	ompaul	:DDD
2006-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	if your not running services then you don't need it
2006-02-28T11:23:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	there is a tool, most people don't need it -it is called firestarted
2006-02-28T11:23:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	 called firestarter <--- oops
2006-02-28T11:24:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	no that tool will do it all for you
2006-02-28T11:24:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	as I said alredy you don't need one unless your running services - by default Ubuntu does not run services
2006-02-28T11:25:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	are they behind a router? or facing the big bad internet?
2006-02-28T11:26:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	you can use firestarter
2006-02-28T11:26:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	install and enjoy - any firewalls I know on Linux use IP Tables - or else they don't work :-)
2006-02-28T11:27:00.000Z	ompaul	southern	all the firewalls are really just front ends for configuring iptables
