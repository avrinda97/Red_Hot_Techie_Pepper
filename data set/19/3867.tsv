2009-06-02T02:21:00.000Z	Shooree		I just did an update and it apparently messed up my X server and graphics stuff. I barely made it to graphical display after restarting. Now my system tells me I don't appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. I ran nvidia-xconfig, as the message said I should, but nothing changed. I still haven't got my window title bars. any thoughts?
2009-06-02T02:22:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	uninstall the old restricted drivers and install them again (you will be installing a newer version)
2009-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	how do I uninstall it, though? It says I don't have them. the update messed up something major
2009-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	can I just activate the recommended version from "hardware drivers"? It actually tells me that I have a different version of it in use.
2009-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	yes... that seems ok
2009-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	ok, but I messed it up once already by doing it... I'll try restarting
2009-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	wait...
2009-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	you could remove it using synaptic...
2009-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	or apt-get
2009-06-02T02:27:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	it will be nvidia-177-*something* or something like that...
2009-06-02T02:27:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	but I already activated it now. would that be a problem?
2009-06-02T02:27:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	oh... you managed to activate it... just restart than
2009-06-02T02:28:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	ok then... here goes. thx
2009-06-02T02:30:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	no luck. Upon restart it tried starting gdm a few times and failed, then started it up in low graphics mode
2009-06-02T02:31:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	now I'm back to generic settings. the display itself is almost fine, it's just that it doesn't show window frames, titlebars and task panes
2009-06-02T02:31:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	um... just remove all nvidia releated stuff than... so than you can start fresh... "--purge" also might help a bit
2009-06-02T02:32:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	would you be so kind to type the entire command? I'm quite the noob at troubleshooting. thanks a bunch
2009-06-02T02:34:00.000Z	Kalmi	Shooree	sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*
2009-06-02T02:36:00.000Z	Shooree	Kalmi	after the purge, should I just restart or... hm, it doesnt show ANYTHING in hardware drivers now. should I update apt-get?
