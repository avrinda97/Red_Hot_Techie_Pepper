2005-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	kain		I no longer cannot see human icons
2005-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	kain		especially on files
2005-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	kain		no idea
2005-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	kain		I reset everything but no luck
2005-04-05T11:11:00.000Z	kain		also I see clearlooks have changed
2005-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	kain		titlebar seems colored for 3d, before it was flat
2005-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	kain		but that's ok
2005-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	kain		It looks like nvidia theme
2005-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	kain		but human icons are there, in theme switching
2005-04-05T11:12:00.000Z	kain		but if I select them my files are without icon
2005-04-05T11:13:00.000Z	michael	kain	do you have any additional themes/iconsets installed?
2005-04-05T11:13:00.000Z	kain	michael	I've removed everything to original state
2005-04-05T11:14:00.000Z	michael	kain	try reinstalling ubuntu-artwork
2005-04-05T11:14:00.000Z	kain	michael	ok
2005-04-05T11:17:00.000Z	kain	michael	X restart, back soon
2005-04-05T11:18:00.000Z	kain	michael	no luck
2005-04-05T11:20:00.000Z	michael	kain	i was noticing a lot of inconsistencies with themes when i upgraded my box... eventually i ended up reinstalling from scratch. Sorry, can't think of anything else...
2005-04-05T11:21:00.000Z	kain	michael	ok, this problem with theme icons appeared with the very latest upgrades, I'm trying to find out what's wrong
2005-04-05T11:28:00.000Z	kain	michael	I've tried with another account, everything is fine. which directory can I delete to restore everything? .gnome2, .themes?
