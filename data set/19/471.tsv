2012-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	berdario		Hi, I just noticed that the new Ubuntu Global Jam has been announced
2012-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	berdario		http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/global/1443/detail/
2012-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	berdario		but both jorge castro and jono bacon seem to have been quite silent about it
2012-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	berdario		do you think that something's wrong with that?
2012-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	berdario		I mean: I also googled for some acknowledgment of the announcement:
2012-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	berdario		https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=http%3A%2F%2Floco.ubuntu.com%2Fevents%2Fglobal%2F1443%2Fdetail%2F&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&aqi=g10&oq=#q=ubuntu+global+jam++site:lists.ubuntu.com&hl=en&safe=off&prmd=imvns&sa=X&ei=enEwT6PxBobh4QStwYCqBQ&ved=0CA8QpwUoBg&source=lnt&tbs=cdr:1%2Ccd_min%3A12%2F28%2F2011%2Ccd_max%3A&tbm=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=9fdc9efd3e42c160&biw=1280&bih=714
2012-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	berdario		and it doesn't yield any result
2012-02-07T05:55:00.000Z	berdario		not quite, but I still do clumsy mistakes :P
2012-02-07T05:55:00.000Z	berdario		btw, there's only one month left
2012-02-07T05:55:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	I blame google
2012-02-07T06:01:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	news to me, sounds good, but i'm having a cup of tea and a crack at getting this cam working in java, but bed as soon as tea is done
2012-02-07T06:04:00.000Z	berdario	recon69_lap	I don't know if you hang around it somewhat often... but I think there's a problem if you didn't know about it... because it's a symptom there's not enough communication about it
2012-02-07T06:04:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	I think there are lots of people working on ubuntu, they probably all hanging out in ubuntu+1
2012-02-07T06:06:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	and i'm helping out now, trying to get my cam wotking in java
2012-02-07T06:09:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	well, get organised in your area if you know anyone. get involved yourself. most work on linux is done because someone wants a feature that is not implemented, then they start working on that feature.
2012-02-07T06:09:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	i'd suggest you dont go bothering people to much
2012-02-07T06:10:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	anyone reading this knows about the jam, now let us get on with what we are doing
2012-02-07T06:11:00.000Z	berdario	recon69_lap	good :) but until 5 minutes ago, it wasn't so... at least it seems we got some results :)
2012-02-07T06:13:00.000Z	recon69_lap	berdario	fine, but this is a support channel, you;ve used up a lot of typing, I'm happy you like ubuntu, but you dont have to worry that it's dieing , or that you can really huge support, we all do a little bit and it adds up
