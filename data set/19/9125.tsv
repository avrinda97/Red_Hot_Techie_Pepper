2006-12-24T07:56:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	if yor computer doesn't support USB boot, then you're out of luck.
2006-12-24T08:00:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	that works IF your computer BIOS supports USB booting.
2006-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	you can boot a external drive, from a special boot CD that mounts a boots the kernel from the external drive, but it's a bit complicated.
2006-12-24T08:08:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	because HirenBootCD might have a utility to do what we are saying...
2006-12-24T08:08:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	how big is your internal drive, and how much it has free space?
2006-12-24T08:09:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	and you don't want to give up the free space for Linux, is that it?
2006-12-24T08:11:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	ok, how about adding a new internal disk? can you do it, or have someone else do it?
2006-12-24T08:13:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	oh, sorry, didn't realised it was a laptop.
2006-12-24T08:18:00.000Z	pushingupdaisies	des1	as it seems, you portable cannot boot form a external disk on USB. so, only option would be to install GRUB on the internal disk, and it would recognize the USB disk and boot the kernel from there.
