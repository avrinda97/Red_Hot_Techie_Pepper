2005-05-23T08:08:00.000Z	yath_	LinuxJones	if i point xine to /dev/hdc, yes
2005-05-23T08:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	yath_	It's supposed to automagically launch
2005-05-23T08:08:00.000Z	yath_	LinuxJones	yes, the gnome-volume-thing launches totem-xine
2005-05-23T08:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	yath_	do you have 2 cd/dvd drives ?
