2009-03-28T15:24:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	dynamic is known to be flawed
2009-03-28T15:25:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	depends on what you need to do, but normally it is
2009-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	if you wish so.. why??
2009-03-28T15:36:00.000Z	ubuntistas	xstasi	i created the virtual machine next?

2009-03-28T16:37:00.000Z	ubuntistas	xstasi	how can i delete the iso file i created?
2009-03-28T16:38:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	it's not an iso, but go on the virtualbox disk manager and erase it
2009-03-28T16:40:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	erase your virtualbox folder - then you're sure
2009-03-28T16:40:00.000Z	ubuntistas	xstasi	too slow for me virtualbox finally
2009-03-28T16:41:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	should be in your home

2009-03-28T16:42:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	check in virtualbox, only you can know where you created the hd image
2009-03-28T16:43:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	sucks mate..
2009-03-28T16:43:00.000Z	xstasi	ubuntistas	try on a terminal: rm -rf VirtualBox
