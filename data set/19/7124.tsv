2010-10-31T18:15:00.000Z	fredrik_		need to install dvd.support
2010-10-31T18:16:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	can't find a package with that name
2010-10-31T18:19:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	have you got a mediplayer compatible with libdvdcss2?
2010-10-31T18:19:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	isn't Totem compatible with libdvdcss2?
2010-10-31T18:19:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	Totem-xine
2010-10-31T18:19:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	guess that means you'll need to install xine as well as totem, to be able to play dvds in totem
2010-10-31T18:21:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	come again?
2010-10-31T18:21:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	totem-xine says in its description it's a transitional package, and its only dependency is totem.
2010-10-31T18:22:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	yes, have you got it installed?
2010-10-31T18:22:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	yes
2010-10-31T18:22:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	and it will not play dvds?
2010-10-31T18:22:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	well, hang on, I'll see if I'll get dvd running on this system
2010-10-31T18:23:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	The xine engine failed to start.
2010-10-31T18:23:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	No input plugin was found.
2010-10-31T18:24:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	what graphics card do you use?
2010-10-31T18:25:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	I'll check, but it's very hard to see how that could have to do with "Read error from: /dev/dvd"
2010-10-31T18:25:00.000Z	ciphergoth	fredrik_	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82915G/GV/910GL Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 04)
2010-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	ah, you're having read errors from you'r dvd. that's beyond my level of expertice. just wanted to know if hardware mpeg2-accellearation was enabled on your system. It seems you have a problem unrelated to dvd-support
2010-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	fredrik_	ciphergoth	have you tried installing the ubuntu-restricted-extras?
