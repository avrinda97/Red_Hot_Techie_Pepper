2009-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	cattellar		hi, Im experiencing an annoying sudden high pitch sound on my asus laptop , it started just after installing Ubuntu 64 bit version, but also during ubuntu's installation I had to insert the power adapter jack with extra force since it got a bit deformed, probably I stepped on it. So Im not sure which one could be the cause. The thing is I can still hear the sound while the bios is loading, I even installed ubuntu 32, which didnt give me this issue
2009-07-13T11:45:00.000Z	cattellar		 before, but the sound persists. I guess it's a fan, or something related to the hard drive because the sound starts as soon as the hd stops loading things. Any ideas of what can I do?
2009-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	d_rwin	cattellar	u hv any exp in hardware troubleshooting ?
2009-07-13T11:48:00.000Z	cattellar	d_rwin	not really
2009-07-13T11:49:00.000Z	d_rwin	cattellar	u can open the cabinet and check if something obstructing the fan
2009-07-13T11:50:00.000Z	d_rwin	cattellar	just rotate and check
2009-07-13T11:50:00.000Z	cattellar	d_rwin	hmm it's a laptop so I'm not too confident on doing that
2009-07-13T11:50:00.000Z	d_rwin	cattellar	u hv dell?
2009-07-13T11:50:00.000Z	cattellar	d_rwin	asus
2009-07-13T11:51:00.000Z	cattellar	d_rwin	do you think me inserting the power jack has something to do with it? I just had to push a bit harder
2009-07-13T11:52:00.000Z	d_rwin	cattellar	no,    u gonna hv to call the h/W engineer
2009-07-13T11:52:00.000Z	cattellar		d_yeah probably
2009-07-13T11:53:00.000Z	d_rwin	cattellar	try limiting the fan speed if it helps!
