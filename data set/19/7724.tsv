2007-10-02T14:09:00.000Z	Daverocks	leo_rockw	right, but the standard "ubuntu" dist is gnome on top of the ubuntu base, kubuntu runs on ubuntu as well

2007-10-02T14:14:00.000Z	Daverocks	leo_rockw	it's not just GNU who have their tools on top of linux
2007-10-02T14:15:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Daverocks	never thought of that, but it is true
