2007-03-10T09:41:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		That is what it says when I do that.
2007-03-10T09:41:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	pastebin the output of this command "cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edgy-multiverse.list"
2007-03-10T09:43:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edgy-multiverse.list
2007-03-10T09:43:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	then do sudo apt-get update and all should be good
2007-03-10T09:44:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	bruenig	didn't work
2007-03-10T09:44:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	what is the error when you do "sudo apt-get update"
2007-03-10T09:45:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	bruenig	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9583/
2007-03-10T09:46:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	bruenig	I'm guessing it is hosed?
2007-03-10T09:47:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	it doesn't look that bad. You have synaptic closed right
2007-03-10T09:47:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	bruenig	I had to hard reset during an install... I think my hard disk controller on this board is flakey honestly.
2007-03-10T09:49:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	try some clean up stuff, like sudo dpkg --configure -a and then sudo apt-get install -f
2007-03-10T09:49:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	bruenig	Thanks for the help by the way... I've been using linux on and off as small servers etc for years, but desktop linux I haven't used in about 3-4 years
2007-03-10T09:50:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	bruenig	Neg on both of those, wouldn't run
2007-03-10T09:50:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	looks bad then, something seriously wrong with dpkg
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	bruenig	SnakesAndStuff	you are sudoing these right
