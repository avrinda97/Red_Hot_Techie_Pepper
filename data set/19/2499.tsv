2012-11-29T09:54:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Some apps store their settings in /var/something too
2012-11-29T09:54:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	assuming it isn't an admin-configured setting in /etc/something
2012-11-29T09:55:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Perhaps a file/folder named ".skype" or something similar in "~" ?
2012-11-29T10:07:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Good catch!
2012-11-29T10:09:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Cat on the keyboard?
2012-11-29T10:28:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Sometimes you need to flash your credentials with a sudo to get things done :-)
2012-11-29T10:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	snowyrooftops	 to acomplish what exactly?
2012-11-29T10:33:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Lost the trail of thought on that accomplish thing
2012-11-29T10:34:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	do you mean project ideas?
2012-11-29T10:34:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	I'm looking at an idea I can take up and develop
2012-11-29T10:34:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Something like a UI for configuration of some /etc/something setting
2012-11-29T10:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	snowyrooftops	 you asked abou doing somthing while idle.. somthing  like what?
2012-11-29T10:35:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Ah, that... I was hoping to write an app to share CPU processing for Linux, but I'm not sure of how to tell if the computer is idle
2012-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Perhaps to accomplish video encoding.... but keeping it open at this stage
2012-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	It would be useful to have a desktop running idle to take up a video encoding job so that the laptop doesn't run down its battery or get superhot
2012-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	Really? Which ones? I've only used Freemake and Handbrake so far.
2012-11-29T10:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	snowyrooftops	 ffmpeg, or mencoder.. about the only  i use
2012-11-29T10:38:00.000Z	snowyrooftops	dr_willis	distributed encoding should be cool on a wired LAN... wireless transfers tend to take a while.... it's cool on smartphones too.
