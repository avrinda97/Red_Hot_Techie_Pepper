2005-08-26T05:39:00.000Z	Ummmmm		Here's a n00blet question: why is gcc not in my path and how do I go about fixing that?
2005-08-26T05:39:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	it's not installed. Install it.
2005-08-26T05:40:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	Note that perhaps compiling stuff isn't a good idea, if you didn;'t know that answer.
2005-08-26T05:40:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	Yes, my point exactly.
2005-08-26T05:41:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	A few simple rules: 1) Never compile what is packaged. 2) Source packages can be modified 3) /usr/local
2005-08-26T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	It might sound condescending, but we DO get people here with an apache source install, who claim they needed to compile it for php support.
2005-08-26T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	if you install unpackaged files, install them to /usr/local, that way they won't interfere with files from packages.
2005-08-26T05:44:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	No, under $HOME is fine too. Just not to / or /usr basically.
2005-08-26T05:53:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	sudo apt-get install gift
2005-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	Just enable the 'universe' and 'metaverse' repositories.
2005-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	'apt-cache search <string>'
2005-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	... or synaptic is handy for searching, too.
2005-08-26T05:55:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	The dir is probably in /usr/local now.
2005-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	Did you run 'configure' ?
2005-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	You can always run 'find / -name "*substring*"
2005-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	Hit arrow-up until the exact command is on the screen, then paste that command here.
2005-08-26T05:58:00.000Z	Ummmmm	cafuego	thanks, I'm such a fscking idiot, moved it to /usr/lcal not /usr/local
2005-08-26T05:58:00.000Z	cafuego	Ummmmm	<heh>
2005-08-26T06:02:00.000Z	Ummmmm	cafuego	thanks for all the help :)
