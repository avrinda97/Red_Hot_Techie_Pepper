2008-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	Sephr		can someone answer my question that I asked please?
2008-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	Sephr		I asked where can I get an ubuntu desktop (8.04 or 8.10) 64-bit alternate installer cd...
2008-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	Sephr		and I can't burn with this drive
2008-09-25T00:44:00.000Z	Sephr		only the iso to burn for youself
2008-09-25T00:45:00.000Z	Sephr		I also said I can't burn with this drive
2008-09-25T00:45:00.000Z	Sephr		WHERE?
2008-09-25T00:46:00.000Z	Sephr		the shipit.ubuntu.com site doesn't offer the alternate installer
2008-09-25T00:46:00.000Z	Sephr		arrrghh: can you please actually give me a link to the page where I can get the 64-bit alternate installer?
2008-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	Sephr		omg noone listens
2008-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	Sephr		I'll say it all in one thing: I can't burn cd/dvds with my drive, so where can I get the ubuntu 8.04 or 8.10 64-bit alternate installer CD or DVD??
2008-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	nucco	Sephr	use another computer to burn. if you download the alternate, you still have to burn it
2008-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	Sephr		I never said I was going to download it
2008-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	Sephr	nucco	I had no intentions of downloading it because neither of my computers can burn dvds
2008-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	nucco	Sephr	then what do you want? a free cd? go to ubuntu.com and look around, or go to amazon.com and buy one :)
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	Sephr	nucco	I already said what I want
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	nucco	Sephr	I just joined this channel
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	Sephr		everyone: shipit only gives me the NORMAL x86 and 64 bit dvd options
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	Sephr		no alt cd
2008-09-25T00:50:00.000Z	nucco	Sephr	that's all they offer, anything else, and you need another means. you gotta find somewhere to burn it, I think.
