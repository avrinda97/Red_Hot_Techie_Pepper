2009-09-29T11:46:00.000Z	diazepam		hi all - I have a HP ProLiant G6 server and can not get Hardy Server LTS 64bit to detect the network card.  Knoppix and 9.04 detect it and use it fine...how can i get the drivers from 9,04 into the LTS 8.04 install???
2009-09-29T11:48:00.000Z	diazepam		i contacted Ubuntu Support BEFORE i purchased the Five Thousand dollar server and they said that 8.04 would work on it fine.
2009-09-29T11:49:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	have searched google with tne name of the nic and 8.04 server edition?
2009-09-29T11:50:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	maybe someone else had the same problem already solved
2009-09-29T11:50:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- yeah i have and everyone is having the same issues
2009-09-29T11:51:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- apparently hardy 8.04-4 is meant to have a fix but I cant find where you download this build.  The lasted build i can find is alternate CD 8.04-3.  Going by the release date calendar onthe canonical site 8.04-4 isnt due until 2010
2009-09-29T11:52:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	hardy 8.04.4 will come next year
2009-09-29T11:53:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	have seen that on ubuntuusers.de yesterday that 8.04.4 will released 2010
2009-09-29T11:54:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- yeah...is there any way of copying the drivers from the 9.04 install CD into the hardy disk so it can power up the network card.
2009-09-29T11:54:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	looked at hp-website for linux-drivers?
2009-09-29T11:54:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- i have purchased another G6 server after consulting canonical (this one cost me $6K) and im thinking im going to have very expensive paper weights
2009-09-29T11:55:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- drivers are built for RHEL and SLED only
2009-09-29T11:57:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	tried debian 5.0?
2009-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	i dont know how to build kernel-moduls (drivers) for a nic, sorry
2009-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- a lot of the packages I want to install on this server are commercial grade and as such are only built for Enterpise Servers - of which Ubuntu LTS is meant to be
2009-09-29T11:59:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- debian 5 isnt listed as a supported platform
2009-09-29T12:12:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	ok didnt know ubuntu-server-edition is a enterprise-linux-version
2009-09-29T12:13:00.000Z	diazepam	iceroot	- yeah Server LTS is meant to be ubuntu answer to SUSE Enterprise and RHEL
2009-09-29T12:13:00.000Z	iceroot	diazepam	hm, ok
