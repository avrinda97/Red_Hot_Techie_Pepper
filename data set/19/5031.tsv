2010-05-12T08:35:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	hangon
2010-05-12T08:35:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	sure, quite a little novel
2010-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	so, you can't apt-get -f,
2010-05-12T08:38:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	can you dpkg-reconfigure what won't upgrade?
2010-05-12T08:38:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	no for ~f , trying that now
2010-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	I can reconfigure libatk1.0-dev,  but still get the same result from upgrading it, also I tried fruom init 1 by dpkg and sore more variants of dpkg..
2010-05-12T08:42:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	the bug-post gives a solution in it's 5th poste, but I wasn't able to repeat it on my case
2010-05-12T08:43:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	I...don't know what to tell you, perhaps mark that bug as affecting you or open a new one for that particular package
2010-05-12T08:45:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	alright, I was looking for someone with a deeper sight of dpkg, as I think that solution could work for me, but I even don't know what :
2010-05-12T08:45:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	you could try a sudo dpkg --configure -a
2010-05-12T08:45:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	"  ~/atk1.0-1.30.0$ ar vx /var/cache/apt/archives/libatk1.0-dev_1.30.0-0ubuntu2_i386.deb  " should invoke
2010-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	did, same result
2010-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	I'm not sure, after that, but maybe someone else is. I'm sorry
2010-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	it's alright, I'll come up with this some more often or else re-file the bug
2011-10-25T02:11:00.000Z	h00k	DasEi	It's taken care of, please don't call ops.
2012-04-03T05:19:00.000Z	DasEi	h00k	tsts
