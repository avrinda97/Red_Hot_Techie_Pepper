2008-07-26T16:33:00.000Z	whileimhere		Bably_Shambl3s That is okay I am not going to upgrade no matter what now. I just will live with it since 7.10 runs so good.
2008-07-26T16:34:00.000Z	whileimhere		Is there a deb for installing e17 desktop?
2008-07-26T16:35:00.000Z	whileimhere		enlightenment
2008-07-26T16:36:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	if you'd actually search you'd see several tutorials on how to install in ubuntu
2008-07-26T16:37:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	I have and you know what most failed and crashed my laptop.
2008-07-26T16:39:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	enlightenment is in the repos you know
2008-07-26T16:40:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	Its the old version 16 I am hoping for the new version 17
2008-07-26T16:40:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	i'd go with what's easy, then worry about upgrades once it's installed
2008-07-26T16:42:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	Ahh I see some confusion here e16 and e17 are not even related except by name.

2008-07-26T16:43:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	at bottom it says: E17 is still under heavy development and is not suitable for production systems.
2008-07-26T16:44:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	yeah it has said that for years.
2008-07-26T16:44:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	probably dead then
2008-07-26T16:44:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	its an easy way of saying development is slow and if it breaks it aint our fault.
2008-07-26T16:45:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	i'd go with 16 then, save yourself the trouble, unless you're trying to help develop it, but i doubt that because then you'd know how to install it =)
2008-07-26T16:46:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	why don't you find if there is an enlightenment irc, you'd get more help there i'm sure
2008-07-26T16:46:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	Exactly right. And I never got this link googling here.
2008-07-26T16:46:00.000Z	whileimhere	kindofabuzz	becuase like so many rooms on IRC there are screen names but no one is home ever.
2009-05-15T00:17:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	whileimhere	just throw the windows cd away =)
