2012-02-28T11:46:00.000Z	Satisfied	zykotick9	i was using gnome yesterday and now I have this weird and confusing interface.... this is not gnome
2012-02-28T11:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	Satisfied	it's gnome+unity
2012-02-28T11:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	Satisfied	unity is not gnome (it just uses gnome as a base)
2012-02-28T11:49:00.000Z	Satisfied	zykotick9	what happened to the regular gnome then?
2012-02-28T11:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	Satisfied	gnome2 is deprecated, and gnome3 is almost as bad as unity.  Linus T. switched to xfce for a sanner environment
2012-02-28T12:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	Satisfied	it's not gnome, stop calling it that.  It's ubuntu's custom shell on top of gnome
2012-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	Satisfied	zykotick9	interesting........ has the ubuntu team approved of this ?
2012-02-28T12:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	Satisfied	ubuntu is a top down organization, it's all decided by one person.  not a democracy.
