2007-06-17T05:02:00.000Z	hackle577		i need help with my bottom GNOME panel. parts of it arent the right color
2007-06-17T05:04:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	a screenshot might help.
2007-06-17T05:04:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	ok lemme grab on real quick
2007-06-17T05:06:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	here you go: http://thumbq.com/thumb/show?V0cfEBE-c1
2007-06-17T05:06:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	as you can see, the resize handle things do not change to the panel color unless i "killall gnome-panel"
2007-06-17T05:08:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	right-click on the panel > properties >background
2007-06-17T05:08:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	my guess is you have set it to transparent
2007-06-17T05:09:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	nope, it's completely opaque
2007-06-17T05:10:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	so the solid colour radio button is selected? try switching to "use system theme"
2007-06-17T05:11:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	yes, the solid color was selected. if i "use system theme" the handles blend in, as they were already the system theme
2007-06-17T05:13:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	but you still get the brown thing?
2007-06-17T05:15:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	no no no, the brown color is the color I want the panel to be, but when I boot the two handle things do not take that color, they use the system default color
2007-06-17T05:17:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	ah, ok.  i thought it was a limitation, but testing it now.  if i choose solid colour and move it all the way to opaque, the handles eventually match the selected colour
2007-06-17T05:18:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	yeah i can get them to match after some finagling, but shouldnt they match right at bootup? they dont for me
2007-06-17T05:20:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	i usually leave it @ use system theme so never noticed.  so you lose the matching when you reboot?
2007-06-17T05:20:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	yep, i can fix it by changing the color and then changing it back, or using killall gnome-panel
2007-06-17T05:36:00.000Z	hackle577	orbin	so is this some sort of weird bug or... ?
2007-06-17T05:37:00.000Z	orbin	hackle577	i'd say so.
