2011-02-23T16:05:00.000Z	flor		hello, how can i set up an existing printer for printing via wlan modem?
2011-02-23T16:05:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	what's a wlan modem?
2011-02-23T16:07:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	its a wlan device that connects with dsl for internet access. it's got an additional function, printing via wlan: I plug the printer into the wlan-modem. and should be able to print, but i'm Not ;-)
2011-02-23T16:08:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	okay, well just to be clear here, it's just a dsl modem that allows computers to connect wirelessly to it?
2011-02-23T16:09:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	yep, exactly.
2011-02-23T16:09:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	ah okay, so if you plugged the printer in and if it has an IP, you should be able to set it up using the printing configuration tool
2011-02-23T16:10:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	just make sure you tell it that you're looking for a network printer
2011-02-23T16:12:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	trying out something
2011-02-23T16:18:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	i've done the following: (1) duplicated my existing printer in -> system -> printers. (2) changed settings: device-uri  -> change -> network-printer -> lpd/lpr-host (3) entered as host: socket://<IP-address> (4) sEARCH for printers/printer queues. it didn't work
2011-02-23T16:19:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	I see, what's the make/model of the printer?
2011-02-23T16:19:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	it's a kyocera mita 1020 d
2011-02-23T16:26:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	can you print if you connect the printer directly?
2011-02-23T16:34:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	yes, that's working fine, printing directly.
2011-02-23T16:36:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	so what's preventing you from adding the new printer instead of copying the currently working printer?
2011-02-23T16:36:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	got it! i had to type in the ip address only without "socket://" in front of it. yeah!!! thanks for your support!!
2011-02-23T16:36:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	oh, awesome :)
2011-02-23T16:38:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	have a good day from me too! : ) bye, everybody!
2011-02-23T16:39:00.000Z	flor	Gnea	ps: you gave me the idea to try a network-printer-conection. for windows, its differently...
2011-02-23T16:39:00.000Z	Gnea	flor	ah yes, that is true - glad you figured it out
