2010-03-16T13:16:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	I am still not sure, what you mean with flip flop. Please try to use proper English and avoid to use abbreviations.
2010-03-16T13:20:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	b4 what?
2010-03-16T13:21:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	what is your native language?
2010-03-16T13:23:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	no problem, but it is hard to figure out, what you need. Perhaps someone who talks your language might be able to help, there are ubuntu support channels in other lanugages, too
2010-03-16T13:24:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	rabbit1: restarting what? the whole machine? the internet session?
2010-03-16T13:26:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	which module do you  rmmod  in this case?
2010-03-16T13:28:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	don't worry
2010-03-16T13:36:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	perhaps you should try out wicd, it can be used instead of network manager and helps often with wifi
2010-03-16T13:38:00.000Z	biborn	hmw	what is wicd??
2010-03-16T13:38:00.000Z	hmw	biborn	a replacement for the network manager
