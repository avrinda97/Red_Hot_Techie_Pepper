2010-11-15T06:10:00.000Z	rage		Hi there, in ifconfig it displays RX bytes and TX bytes for each interface. Over what time period is that recorded for? since the interface was brought up?
2010-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	yes
2010-11-15T06:12:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	I dont suppose you know if its possible to get an interfaces up time
2010-11-15T06:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	not finding anything, sorry
2010-11-15T06:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	you could read dmesg to see when it came up and do some maths
2010-11-15T06:16:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	yeah me neither, thanks
2010-11-15T06:19:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	dmesg doesnt have specific dates. I assume 210.710240 means 210 seconds into boot?
2010-11-15T06:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	yeah thats seconds since boot
2010-11-15T06:20:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	Okay, the ifconfig RX/TX bytes is totally inaccurate then. :-/ this server has transmitted terabytes of data since the interface was brought up last
2010-11-15T06:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	seems to ;) just found that online
2011-06-10T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	http://chris-lamb.co.uk/2008/01/24/can-you-get-cp-to-give-a-progress-bar-like-wget/
2011-06-10T11:42:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	Not after a progress bar, but I'll take a look, might be adaptable
2011-06-10T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	you could use:  copycommand; notify-send "copy done"
2011-06-10T11:44:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	After a simple listing of how much was copied in particular
2011-06-10T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	that i'm not sure of but you can use notify-send to use the notifier like other apps do
2011-06-10T11:45:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	Yeah thats fine, its easy to know when the copy is done :-)
2011-06-10T12:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	slow drives huh
2011-06-10T12:29:00.000Z	rage	ActionParsnip	Yeah, its USB2.0.
2011-06-10T12:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rage	then definately slow
