2009-01-10T22:55:00.000Z	icqnumber		is there openoffice 3 for ubuntu?
2009-01-10T22:56:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	yes but you need to add a repository from launchpad
2009-01-10T22:56:00.000Z	icqnumber	SiDi	have you tried it already?
2009-01-10T22:57:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	i'm using it :)
2009-01-10T22:57:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	youu'll need to run DicOOo to properly setup your language's dictionnary, though, but it works well.
2009-01-10T22:57:00.000Z	icqnumber	SiDi	okey thank you
2009-01-10T22:59:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	want me to pm you the repository ? i don't have the auth key though
2009-01-10T23:01:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	intrepid or hardy ? here is the repo to add for intrepid : deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openoffice-pkgs/ubuntu intrepid main (to be added in /etc/apt/sources.list) (be aware that since the repository isn't authentificated you'll have warning messages when downloading an openoffice.org message)
2009-01-10T23:02:00.000Z	icqnumber	SiDi	 is it the link you have used https://launchpad.net/~openoffice-pkgs/+archive ?
2009-01-10T23:03:00.000Z	icqnumber	SiDi	okey i see, ti is the same thank you
2009-01-10T23:04:00.000Z	icqnumber	SiDi	strange that i was not included in intrepid https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OOo30Schedule
2009-01-10T23:05:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	i think it's because it was released just too late for ubuntu devs to integrate it
2009-01-10T23:08:00.000Z	icqnumber	SiDi	 and looks like it is not even the final release, instead rc1
2009-01-10T23:09:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	it's the 3.0.1 rc1 :)
2009-01-10T23:09:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	the repository is the one for the dev version of ooo for ubuntu (instead of 2.4 its now 3.0.1 rc1, it was still 3.0 a few days ago)
2009-01-10T23:10:00.000Z	SiDi	icqnumber	if you want only the stable 3.0 you can remove the repository and download it on openoffice.org
