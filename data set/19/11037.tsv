2006-05-27T10:04:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- make sure you are typing it right
2006-05-27T10:04:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- and that the path is right

2006-05-27T10:05:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- file may be corrupted so delete and download again then try dpkg and you should be good
2006-05-27T10:08:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- its a shitty google image "editing" program
2006-05-27T10:13:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- you might want to check out Xen or Vmware
2006-05-27T10:33:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- relax man - you can fix it and get anything you need working
2006-05-27T10:37:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- you should go to the documentation site or any search engine an look up setting up a dual boot linux system
2006-05-27T10:37:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- i think its on the support docs
2006-05-27T10:38:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- get a copy from a friend and then use the license key on your box itself if need be
2006-05-27T10:40:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- You either have to ask someone you know to give you a copy of the CD or buy a new one.  If you own the license then you are fine if not you are out of luck.  Media center is crap anyways.  Check out MythTV or Freevo
2006-05-27T10:43:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- Xbox 360 this is not microsft game console support. lol
2006-05-27T10:45:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- the store or I think bill gates himself will deliver it if you give him a call at home
2006-05-27T10:46:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- I jest
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- i would ask to speak with the man in charge and tell him is software is broken
2006-05-27T10:47:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- lol
2006-05-27T10:48:00.000Z	kubuntu_	ecoblue	- yeah this is true and linux needs to get better support from the hardware co.s and game developers
