2005-10-25T05:25:00.000Z	kbrooks		well brb
2005-10-25T05:25:00.000Z	hmeland_	kbrooks	Are there any hints in the logs under /var/log/cups/?
2005-10-25T05:27:00.000Z	kbrooks		E [19/Oct/2005:19:21:55 -0400]  StartListening: Unable to bind socket for address 7f000001:631 - Cannot assign requested address.
2005-10-25T05:28:00.000Z	hmeland_	kbrooks	Maybe you haven't got IPv6 set up correctly, and hence can't bind to the IPv6 loopback address?
2005-10-25T05:28:00.000Z	kbrooks	hmeland_	i dont use ipv6
2005-10-25T05:28:00.000Z	kbrooks		I [08/Oct/2005:07:41:21 -0400]  Listening to 7f000001:631
2005-10-25T05:28:00.000Z	kbrooks		it worked before
2005-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	hmeland_	kbrooks	Well, it appears that your cups thinks it's a good idea to use ipv6 (possibly in addition to ipv4).
2005-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	kbrooks	hmeland_	no
2005-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	kbrooks	hmeland_	IT WORKED BEFORE
2005-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	kbrooks		therefore
2005-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	kbrooks		i dont use ipv6
2005-10-25T05:30:00.000Z	hmeland_	kbrooks	If you have a process "cupsd" running, what does "lsof -p `pidof cupsd` | grep TCP" report?
