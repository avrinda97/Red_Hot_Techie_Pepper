2008-01-08T00:17:00.000Z	Ordika		Mike: i'm still very new to all this, ur gonna have to make it retardedly simple for me
2008-01-08T00:17:00.000Z	miknex	Ordika	you might have to reinstall the drivers
2008-01-08T00:18:00.000Z	Ordika	miknex	how would i go about doing that? I considered re-installing ubuntu, but i'm dual booting with XP, and son't know if it would install ubuntu over my current install, or make a second ubuntu. (not sure if thats possible, but i'm running out of space on my drive)
2008-01-08T00:19:00.000Z	miknex	Ordika	sudo aptitude remove (name of graphics driver goes here)
2008-01-08T00:21:00.000Z	miknex	Ordika	once you haev that removed look into Synaptic Package Installer and reinstall your ATI drivers
2008-01-08T00:21:00.000Z	Ordika	miknex	are u referring to the ATI driver from the restricted list, or the VESA compliant generic driver the thing insists on using?
2008-01-08T00:21:00.000Z	miknex	Ordika	the ATI drive
2008-01-08T00:22:00.000Z	miknex		you siad you have Radeon that is an ATI driver and hopefully should have your type in that package
2008-01-08T00:22:00.000Z	Ordika	miknex	thanks. Time to give it a shot
2008-01-08T00:22:00.000Z	miknex		cool
