2007-07-27T12:36:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	by 'binary' do you mean executable ? as in chmod +x script
2007-07-27T12:44:00.000Z	crackerbox		What would be the best way to perform some lines of code from a bash script in a compiled binary file?
2007-07-27T12:48:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	have you looked into encrypted filesystem booting?
2007-07-27T12:48:00.000Z	mrsno		so if the usb pen is stolen, noone should be able to either read the contents, or brute force the encrypted password
2007-07-27T12:48:00.000Z	crackerbox		mrsno- no i havent heard of that
2007-07-27T12:48:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	one sec
2007-07-27T12:49:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystem for an example, but i would search on the wiki for encrypted and see more
2007-07-27T12:49:00.000Z	mrsno		as there are many options for full disk encryption :)
2007-07-27T12:49:00.000Z	crackerbox		mrsno- thats not exactly what im looking for... i just want to prevent the system from booting from someone elses USB stick... so basically just a copy prevention method
2007-07-27T12:50:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	oh so like a "dongle" that you see connected to parrallel ports on high end cad systems, to prevent users of the software copying it to another pc
2007-07-27T12:50:00.000Z	crackerbox		mrsno- pretty much
2007-07-27T12:50:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	well that is beyond my scope, sorry dont know :)
2007-07-27T12:52:00.000Z	crackerbox		mrsno... i've already written the code and it is 100% working... its just in a bash script, and id like to compile it to a binary
2007-07-27T12:53:00.000Z	crackerbox		Consty- i know its not equal... but is there a way to run bash commands from a compiled language?
2007-07-27T12:55:00.000Z	crackerbox		howling: i just need about 10 lines of a bash script to be compiled into any binary form where that code would not be plain text
2007-07-27T12:57:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	all i can think of, is if security is a problem with this computer, can't someone mearly unplug the usb drive ? if they have physical access already
2007-07-27T12:57:00.000Z	crackerbox		but you can perform command line operations from programs written in another language, right?
2007-07-27T13:00:00.000Z	crackerbox	mrsno	- I would like to distribute this USB stick to clients... for them to use them on their own computers... but I want to prevent some kid who knows nothing about linux from ghosting one of my client's sticks to his own stick and getting an unauthorized usb stick.  Checking the serail number during boot and then terminating the boot process if the numbers dont match is how I am accomplishing this...
2007-07-27T13:01:00.000Z	mrsno	crackerbox	can i ask what is so special on this disk, that you do not wish it to be distributed?
