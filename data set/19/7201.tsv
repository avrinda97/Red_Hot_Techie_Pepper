2008-04-22T06:23:00.000Z	bazhang	newbie	have you used ndiswrapper before?
2008-04-22T06:24:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	no, I am quite new to ubuntu
2008-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	when I insert my wireless card, one of the two leds blinks constantly, and the other just remain on
2008-04-22T06:26:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	pcmcia, hotplugging
2008-04-22T06:27:00.000Z	bazhang	newbie	that is likely not a good idea ; does ifconfig show two entries or three
2008-04-22T06:28:00.000Z	bazhang	newbie	what is the internal card
2008-04-22T06:29:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	intel prowireless 2200bg
2008-04-22T06:30:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	I modified my netgear card with a cantenna, that's why
2008-04-22T06:31:00.000Z	bazhang	newbie	you want to use ndiswrapper on a pcmcia card when the internal card will work and is very well supported?
2008-04-22T06:31:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	the wireless network I am sharing is far, so I need to amplify it, and the internal card does not even detect the signal
2008-04-22T06:32:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	yes, I need it. It may sound weird, but I cannot detect the wireless network I am sharing with the internal card
2008-04-22T06:38:00.000Z	newbie	bazhang	could you tell me how to use ndiswrapper to make my card work?
