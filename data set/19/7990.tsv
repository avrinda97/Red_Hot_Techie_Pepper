2007-09-09T13:36:00.000Z	KiphereCE_		so umm.. can I move a swap file partition while I'm still actively in the recovery console?
2007-09-09T13:36:00.000Z	KiphereCE_		I apparently jacked something up when making the partitions.
2007-09-09T13:37:00.000Z	KiphereCE_		cause my linux and swap are at the end of the disk and there's not enough room.
2007-09-09T13:37:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	did you just install?
2007-09-09T13:38:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	so like if you had to, you could reinstall and redo the partitions, right?
2007-09-09T13:40:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	honestly, if I were you, I'd just reinstall and pay really close attention to where I put the partitions this time around. I mean, it's not like you're going to loose anything
2007-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	I'm still voting on a reinstall of the OS and repartitioning.
2007-09-09T13:45:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	do you have a second machine that you could download the iso with and burn off?
2007-09-09T13:46:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	or for that matter, is there enough room on your current partions to log in and download the iso?
2007-09-09T13:47:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	what version of Ubuntu did you install?
2007-09-09T13:49:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	when do you need the machine up and running?
2007-09-09T13:49:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	right
2007-09-09T13:50:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	you can always request a CD from Cannonical. It's free
2007-09-09T13:50:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	friends are good too!
2007-09-09T13:51:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	maybe you need to go to the computer store tomorrow instead of your friend's place eh? LOL ;) :D
2007-09-09T13:52:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	I remember well the days of RedHat 6
2007-09-09T13:53:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	I did just that. My little Celeron Ubuntu box is a print server, a file server, a web server and an SSH server.
2007-09-09T13:54:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	have you googled to see if you can install Ubuntu straight off the internet?
2007-09-09T13:54:00.000Z	ProfessorTom	KiphereCE_	don't be afraid to ask questions. That's what we're here for
