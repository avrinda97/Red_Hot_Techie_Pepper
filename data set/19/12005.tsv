2005-10-22T12:47:00.000Z	Mineself		Hi All ! I am new to UBUNTU but I cant get my printer installed. Can anyone help a frustrated newbie?
2005-10-22T12:47:00.000Z	Mineself		It is a Samsung CLP-510
2005-10-22T12:48:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	oh, that one's a bit bitchy
2005-10-22T12:48:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	it's not the network variant?
2005-10-22T12:48:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	I have the networked variant running here..
2005-10-22T12:49:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	do you have the samsung linux driver installed?
2005-10-22T12:50:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	did you run it as root?
2005-10-22T12:51:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	it does work, though :) Get the drivers from samsung then
2005-10-22T12:51:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	you need to run the script as root, though
2005-10-22T12:52:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	no, you need to be able to spawn X windows as root
2005-10-22T12:53:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	you should log into gnome/kde/whatever as root
2005-10-22T12:54:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	that's the easiest way
2005-10-22T12:54:00.000Z	Mineself	kblin	I am runnign KDS right now but can log back into GNOME easily
2005-10-22T12:55:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	no, just log into whatever gui you use
2005-10-22T12:55:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	as long as you're root and can open a window in the GUI
2005-10-22T13:06:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	sn9
2005-10-22T13:06:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	sn9: the samsung setup tool works fine in debian sarge
2005-10-22T13:13:00.000Z	Mineself	kblin	sn9 Holy crapoly this is getting complex! everything is going well so far. I am making the config file now
2005-10-22T13:26:00.000Z	kblin	Mineself	ok, good luck with that printer
