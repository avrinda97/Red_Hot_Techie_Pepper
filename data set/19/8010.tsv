2007-05-17T07:51:00.000Z	irishman2020		anyone know of a better irc chat then xchat and pidgin? I'm using irssi because it does a better job of auto typing, etc
2007-05-17T07:51:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	there's bitchX
2007-05-17T07:52:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	lemme give that a try, ty
2007-05-17T07:52:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	although I think it's text based.. but if you like that I think it's the best around
2007-05-17T07:53:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	I'm using irssi right now, so txt based is fine... I just want one that I can scroll up with and maybe log, but also be able to use "tab" to auto fill names, etc
2007-05-17T07:53:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	I've never used bitchX myself.. but I've heard it being mentioned.. hope it works for you
2007-05-17T07:54:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	what do you use?
2007-05-17T07:54:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	I'm using the gnome version of xchat.. not very fancy but it's enough for me
2007-05-17T07:55:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	I have that one, but I got addicted to the auto fill if irssi when all I had was terminal... I play it old school :-D
2007-05-17T07:55:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	autofill? you mean tab completion of nicks? if so xchat does that
2007-05-17T07:55:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	it wouldnt do it for me, it gave me a HUGE list after I typed tab
2007-05-17T07:56:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	ah.. you want to be able to browse the list of nicks matching? well.. xchat won't do that for you =/
2007-05-17T07:56:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	no, thats what it did do... i typed tab, and a huge list appeared in the chat log
2007-05-17T07:57:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	I'm not following here.. what do you want it to do?
2007-05-17T07:58:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	for example, I type Sl <tab> i want it to auto go to Slart or cycle the Sl list of users
2007-05-17T07:58:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	ah that's what I mean by browse.. my bad..
2007-05-17T07:59:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	currently it just displays a list of users in the chat log that begins with those names
2007-05-17T07:59:00.000Z	irishman2020	Slart	its a huge ease when doing messaging to one person or another
2007-05-17T07:59:00.000Z	Slart	irishman2020	if you've typed in enough characters it will autofill it.. if it's ambigious it will show you the options..
