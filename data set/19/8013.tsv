2007-05-23T06:23:00.000Z	Pelo	sileni	 the first one tells you how to get multimedia support,  you just have to copy one long command line to the terminal and you will have all the codecs you need,  take the time to read it

2010-01-13T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	sileni	it usualy starts, but I've had some occasions where it just stoped , I had to restart it ,  check in menu > system > prefs > prog on startup or something like that , make sure it is listed
