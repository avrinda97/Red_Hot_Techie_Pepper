2007-07-11T12:08:00.000Z	bluebanana		bluefish is wysiwyg, yes?
2007-07-11T12:09:00.000Z	bluebanana		what should a beginner use?
2007-07-11T12:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	another good wysiwyg editor is Kompozer
2007-07-11T12:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	Kompozer is an updated version of nvu
2007-07-11T12:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	I'd suggest it over Nvu untill nvu gets a new version cranked out.
2007-07-11T12:10:00.000Z	bluebanana	Megaqwerty	thanks for telling me of kompozer. If kompozer is the updated version of nvu, i see no reason to use nvu. Do you folks see any reason?
2007-07-11T12:11:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	I think dankee is dutch for "thank you"
2007-07-11T12:12:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	I may have gotten the language of origin wrong though...
2007-07-11T12:18:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	it's in either the multiverse or universe repositories
2007-07-11T12:18:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	can't remember which
2007-07-11T12:18:00.000Z	bluebanana	Megaqwerty	i think i have multi and uni turned on in add/remove (sources.list)

2007-07-11T12:19:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	actually...I think there was an easier way
2007-07-11T12:20:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	http://www.getdeb.net/app.php?name=Kompozer
2007-07-11T12:20:00.000Z	bluebanana	Megaqwerty	so you're saying kompozer is not in repo, yes?
2007-07-11T12:20:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	it would appear so.
2007-07-11T12:22:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	Kompozer is the best wysiwyg I have used. that getdeb link I gave you will give you a file you can download, and double-click to install. easy.
2007-07-11T12:28:00.000Z	bluebanana	Megaqwerty	ok. i'm installing kompozer now. thanks.
2007-07-11T12:28:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	bluebanana	You're welcome, and happy Web Designing!
