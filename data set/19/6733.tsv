2008-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		anybody know how i can owne my files?, i keep getting errors about not owning the file when trying to save
2008-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	chown youruser:youruser filename
2008-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	where are the files youre trying to work with though?
2008-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	anything in your home drive should be owned by you unless you're doing sillymultiboots with fedora and ubuntu like i used to
2008-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	/etc ? thats for root
2008-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	edit those with sudo
2008-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	and be careful, because that's a system file
2008-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	if you use a terminal editor, like nano or vim, use "sudo nano" or "sudo vim" but if you use gedit, then open it with "gksu gedit <file>"
2008-05-27T11:30:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	root is all powerful.  your user is not.
2008-05-27T11:30:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	gksu = gksudo on ubuntu
2008-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	ever use a mac before?
2008-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	oh ok...i was gonna say they do it the same way...all users use sudo to get root powers
2008-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	its easier to revoke sudo privs than to force the jerk you let touch the computer to somehow forget the root password :P
2008-05-27T11:32:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	nah, dont add yourself to the root group
2008-05-27T11:32:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	ubuntu purposefully locks the root account
2008-05-27T11:32:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	well, i guess the group doesnt hurt...
2008-05-27T11:33:00.000Z	maco	KRaZy_WaKa	but the root account is locked so jerks cant just assume root for username and brute force the password. theyd need to get both your user and pass to get in
2008-05-27T11:33:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	maco	lol didnt exactly help either
2008-05-27T11:34:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	maco	i just double-clicked the file in the folder, apparently i'm too used to winblows lol
