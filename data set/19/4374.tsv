2009-01-28T02:01:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234		anyone know how to keep my speaker volume from resetting to 0 on restart?
2009-01-28T02:01:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234		I am using alsa
2009-01-28T02:01:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234		as my machine has problems with pulseaudio
2009-01-28T02:02:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	what version of ubuntu?
2009-01-28T02:03:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	yes, thats normal
2009-01-28T02:03:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	also whats the output of "which alsactl"?
2009-01-28T02:03:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234	maco	ok, just checking :)
2009-01-28T02:04:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	and the file /etc/init.d/alsa-utils exists, right?
2009-01-28T02:06:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	can you pastebin the contents of your /var/lib/alsa/asound.state for me?
2009-01-28T02:07:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	brb, moving to another physical room
2009-01-28T02:11:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	after you do "sudo alsactl store" can you do "echo $?"
2009-01-28T02:13:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234	maco	what does that do?
2009-01-28T02:13:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	if it gives a 0, that means "it claims to have worked"
2009-01-28T02:14:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234	maco	ok, it gave a 0.
2009-01-28T02:16:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	ok so its saying it can write to the asound.state just fine... can you do "sudo alsa force-reload" and then pastebin the asound.state again?
2009-01-28T02:20:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	and pastebin "amixer -c0"
2009-01-28T02:21:00.000Z	maco	ubuntuuser234234	your asound.state looks like it didnt revert to a bunch of 0s...
2009-01-28T02:23:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234	maco	can't decide if that is good or bad
2009-01-28T02:23:00.000Z	ubuntuuser234234	maco	If it did I would at least have an idea of what is causing this
