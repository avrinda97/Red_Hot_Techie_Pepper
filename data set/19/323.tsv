2012-05-18T14:39:00.000Z	gaelfx		I've got a box running 12.04 using the NVidia drivers for graphics, and every time I reboot, the resolution is somehow automatically set to 1080i/50hz instead of 1920x1080/60hz, how can I fix it?
2012-05-18T14:40:00.000Z	gaelfx		I tried saving the X.org config file numerous times and everything, even ran the nvidia-settings command as root and saving my settings, but it seems no matter what the setting are lost on reboot
2012-05-18T14:41:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	Geez, I've had my share of problems with nvidia...
2012-05-18T14:41:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	I wouldn't worry too much about it just yet, still lots of fixes to be made
2012-05-18T14:41:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	if you can't login because of nvidia on the other hand... *shivers*
2012-05-18T14:42:00.000Z	gaelfx	sirriffsalot	this box isn't set up to require login on reboot, the only problem is that the borders of the screen are cut off and I have to fix it every time it reboots (ie when the kid pulls the chord for fun)
2012-05-18T15:00:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	how do you fix this exactly?
2012-05-18T15:00:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	sorry, was away. the window border problem that is
2012-05-18T15:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	sirriffsalot	every time I reboot, I have to open nvidia settings and change the refresh rate to 60hz then apply the settings
2012-05-18T15:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	ah... Perhaps a bit useless, but have you tried google?:P
2012-05-18T15:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	sirriffsalot	indeed
2012-05-18T15:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	have you tried ubuntu-tweak or gnome-tweak-tools?
2012-05-18T15:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	sirriffsalot	no, and I've no desire to
2012-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	haha, un derstandable..
2012-05-18T15:05:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	have you tried running an earlier kernel version?
2012-05-18T15:05:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	as a temporary fix. hold shift when you bootup to get into the grub selection menu, and go for "earlier linux versions" or words to the effect
2012-05-18T15:06:00.000Z	gaelfx	sirriffsalot	it's been happening ever since I installed 12.04, it's not something that cropped up after a kernel update or anything like that
2012-05-18T15:16:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	well, for my part doing that solved a temporary problem with usb failures
2012-05-18T15:16:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	gaelfx	might be worth a shot?
