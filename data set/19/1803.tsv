2010-10-03T18:24:00.000Z	andorino		firewall or configuration issue on his end
2010-10-03T18:25:00.000Z	andorino		many isps block incoming tcp 80
2010-10-03T18:26:00.000Z	andorino		anyone aware of any docs/howtos dealing with fakeraid/softraid issues with ubuntu?  The regular Ubunto Howto on this doesn't apply as I'm having the issue in reverse :P
2010-10-03T18:26:00.000Z	andorino		erroneous detection of a fakeraid array.
2010-10-03T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	andorino	fake raid is not a good technology, it's better not to sue it if possible
2010-10-03T18:29:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	that's my problem.  Ubuntu THINKS I have fakeraid, I don't.  How to I make it realize that?  Its not detecting my disks/partitions correctly so its not an issue of both being available.
2010-10-03T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	andorino	in the bios make sure the disk is presented as jbod/ide/sata
2010-10-03T18:29:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	it is
2010-10-03T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	andorino	are the disks blank ?
2010-10-03T18:29:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	no
2010-10-03T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	andorino	so when you start the installer it sees one big disk rather than 2 seperate ones ?
2010-10-03T18:31:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	and only /dev/sda gets generated, no /dev/sdb.  Yes, one big disk. /dev/mapper/pdc_* stuff
2010-10-03T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	andorino	the only way I can think of that happening is if these disks where once part of a raid array and the private region data is still on the disks
2010-10-03T18:31:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	think I need to zero out the drives?
2010-10-03T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	andorino	if you can lose the data, it's worth it
2010-10-03T18:33:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	that is the case, that they were once RAID 1'd, but I did turn off the RAID stuff, reinitilize, and windows 7 was fine with it
2010-10-03T18:33:00.000Z	andorino		but yes, i shouldn't mentiion windows 7 here :)
2010-10-03T18:33:00.000Z	andorino	ikonia	thanks
