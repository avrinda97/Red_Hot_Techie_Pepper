2010-07-01T01:13:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	no, wait I will find a link
2010-07-01T01:10:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	hi
2010-07-01T01:10:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	only if you install it in persistent mode
2010-07-01T01:11:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	otherwise it will try to format the pendrivw
2010-07-01T01:13:00.000Z	Kuba	matrixa1	do you mean checking "Discarded on shutdown [...]" option in the Startup Disk Creator?
2010-07-01T01:16:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	i was wrong, i think the only way to get ubuntu on your pendrive is though format
2010-07-01T01:17:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	there's more info here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USB%20Installation%20Media
2010-07-01T01:18:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	because the pendrive needs to be made bootable it needs to be formatted
2010-07-01T01:18:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	but after the format you can put back all your files
2010-07-01T01:19:00.000Z	Kuba	matrixa1	so can You format it during live-cd session? ;d
2010-07-01T01:19:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	oh ofcourse
2010-07-01T01:19:00.000Z	Kuba	matrixa1	well, help you for your response
2010-07-01T01:19:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	ive tried that already and it works
2010-07-01T01:20:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	make sure the live session is from a CD though :P
2010-07-01T01:33:00.000Z	Kuba	matrixa1	oh noes, I wanted it to be exactly the same pendrive, both for booting up and running live session and for formatting and os installation ;]
2010-07-01T01:33:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	that's possible if you run your live session from RAM
2010-07-01T01:33:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	its possible but you need a boot prefix
2010-07-01T01:33:00.000Z	matrixa1	Kuba	you need to google some
2010-07-01T01:34:00.000Z	Kuba	matrixa1	okay, that is what i wanted to know!
