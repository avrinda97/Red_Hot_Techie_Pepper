2005-07-07T07:49:00.000Z	secata		Learnt about pppconfig when I was running Stormix...ages ago.  Desktop had no dialer ;o)
2005-07-07T07:50:00.000Z	secata		World online...get's their backbone from Telkom...so does all ISP's...
2005-07-07T07:52:00.000Z	secata		What did you set the port rate to?
2005-07-07T07:54:00.000Z	secata		I have mine set-up to it's highest, and getting 4 kb/s on downloads, which is what I usually get on Win as well...trying that speed test you talked about...
2005-07-07T07:55:00.000Z	secata		Just keep in mind, that it's most prob your overall connection capability.  You are still limited to a small part of that due to bandwidth throttling on the ISP's side...
2005-07-07T07:57:00.000Z	secata		:o)...plus Telkom has never actually implemented any throttling and is said to start doing so...
2005-07-07T07:58:00.000Z	secata		I wonder how long the big wigs is still going to talk about fixing Telkom's telecomunications minopaly and start doing something about it...*dang*
2005-07-07T07:59:00.000Z	secata		Hope it works out...
2005-07-07T07:59:00.000Z	secata		Aaaaalrighty then...eclipse is not an option.  Don't want to spend the next year downloading a 101 mb install...*YIKES*

2005-07-07T08:09:00.000Z	secata	Seveas	I think the exchange is something like R6.00 to the dollar...
2005-07-07T08:24:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	and conversations like this are OK if it's not too busy IMHO
2005-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	well, I regularly weed through it :)
2005-07-07T08:27:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	VB..?
2005-07-07T08:28:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	I know what it is, I even touched it once, but it's so incredibly ugly :)
2005-07-07T08:32:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	it's still a watered down version of C++ :)
2005-07-07T08:33:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	1.5 (Java 5) introduces so much incompatible changes once more :)
2005-07-07T08:41:00.000Z	Seveas	secata	selling your soul to the devil...
