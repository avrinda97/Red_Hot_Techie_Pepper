2008-02-20T02:43:00.000Z	Waffle		i want to learn some basic programming skills, where would be a good place for me to start? i tried downloading hacketyhack but i couldnt get it to work properly.
2008-02-20T02:44:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	"Dive into Python" is a good and freely downloadable book about starting to program in python
2008-02-20T02:46:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	what program do i use to write python and test it?
2008-02-20T02:47:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	it's called IDLE. install it with add/remove programs
2008-02-20T02:47:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	knuth is my homeboy!
2008-02-20T02:48:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	i will take that as a yes
2008-02-20T02:48:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	yup
2008-02-20T02:57:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	How common is python in the programming world? as a junior in high school, I want to go into programming or design in college. What would be a good language for me to learn for that purpose? Or is python still appropriate?
2008-02-20T02:59:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	Python is a powerful language that's good for the everyday programming of those small tasks. it's great for learning programming and is the favorite programming language in ubuntu. ;)
2008-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	great, thanks. What is the most common language for professionals?
2008-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	python is common among professionals too.
2008-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	awesome, thanks a lot
2008-02-20T03:01:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	the MOST common would be c++, but i would never recommend anyone without programming experience to start with c++. i study EE at the moment, and i recommend python.
2008-02-20T03:02:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	ok hopefully i will be able to work my way up to c++
2008-02-20T03:03:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	a lot of apps in ubuntu are developed in python. the frets on fire game, for instance
2008-02-20T03:04:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	great. that will be my goal. to write a program
2008-02-20T03:06:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	http://www.diveintopython.org/ has some example that will help you make your first program. the hello world example is classic
2008-02-20T03:06:00.000Z	Waffle	magnetron	i just downloaded that. I am loosely familiar with BASIC, so this shouldnt be too big of a leap
2008-02-20T03:07:00.000Z	magnetron	Waffle	great
