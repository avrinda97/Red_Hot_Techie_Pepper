2011-03-26T04:37:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	i want to format my second hard drive, it has multiple partitions but they are NTFS, EXT and one swap..
2011-03-26T04:38:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	but just wnat to have 2 partitions ext4
2011-03-26T04:38:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	Well, if you are not using those other partitions, just blow them away and put what you want on it.
2011-03-26T04:39:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	Are you using gparted?
2011-03-26T04:40:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	no im using the DISK UTILITY tool of Gnome on ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-26T04:40:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	Ok, well as long as you are not using those partitions, go on with it.  If that swap partion is in use by your current system you might want to keep it on there some place... but you probably already have a swap partition on the other drive, right?
2011-03-26T04:41:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	yes i already have another swap partition
2011-03-26T04:41:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	You should be good to go then.
2011-03-26T04:42:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	i just want to format the entire second hard drive
2011-03-26T04:42:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	 yes but on the disk utility options, on the Formatting options there is the MASTER BOOT RECORDER, and the GUID prtition table
2011-03-26T04:43:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	which one should i use...??
2011-03-26T04:44:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	GUID is just a standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical hard disk.
2011-03-26T04:45:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	 so the Master boot recorder should be fine?
2011-03-26T04:47:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	I just use fdisk for what you are doing.  Since this drive is not in use by your current system, (or any other for that matter, you can do what you like with it).  I don't know much about the options you are seeing in the particular partitioning utility you are using, but yes MBR is find.  (Not sure what options it is giving you, or why there are options in the first place, because you have to write the new partition table to the MBR of the drive for the
2011-03-26T04:50:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	awesome thanks a lot!
2011-03-26T04:50:00.000Z	Mndrll	terry	it seems to work fine! ;)
2011-03-26T04:50:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	NP
2011-03-26T04:50:00.000Z	terry	Mndrll	Very well.
