2011-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	uhohuhoh		Guys, I'm in "grub rescue>" mode right now, I think my linux partition is messed, can I still load one of my windows partitions?
2011-07-04T07:31:00.000Z	uhohuhoh		Could anyone help me out? I'm trying to see if I can load a Windows partition of mine from Grub's rescue mode....
2011-07-04T07:32:00.000Z	uhohuhoh		Anyone?
2011-07-04T07:32:00.000Z	uhohuhoh		Sigh.
2011-07-04T07:33:00.000Z	uhohuhoh		So no one can help me, yes?
2011-07-04T07:34:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	what you need?
2011-07-04T07:34:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	I'm stuck in Grub's rescue mode
2011-07-04T07:35:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	when I hit ls, all I can see is msdos partitions, no linux partitions
2011-07-04T07:35:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	so I'm wondering if I can somehow still load into one of the msdos partitions?
2011-07-04T07:35:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	did you use WUBI?
2011-07-04T07:35:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	no, I was using ubuntu-minimal
2011-07-04T07:36:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	but you don't have any linux partition ....
2011-07-04T07:36:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	yeah, which is the *really* messed up thing
2011-07-04T07:38:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	 so, you wanna load your windows back?
2011-07-04T07:39:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	unless you have grub installed in the ntfs ~ or you will have to bootCD to fix it ~ either supergrub , liveCD, or to revert back to M$ default with windows CD
2011-07-04T07:47:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	it depends what did you did.
2011-07-04T07:48:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	Sigh, I'm goign to give it a try.
2011-07-04T07:48:00.000Z	uhohuhoh	wildbat	I don't think Ubuntu is for me.
2011-07-04T07:49:00.000Z	wildbat	uhohuhoh	it isn't like that ~ it is just it is your first time , i think ~
