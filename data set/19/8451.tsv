2007-05-30T10:23:00.000Z	balachmar		Is it normal that ubuntu alternate install asks for another cd?
2007-05-30T10:23:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	no its not normal :P
2007-05-30T10:24:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	but it does it asks for Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn_ - Release i386 (20070415)
2007-05-30T10:25:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	did you check the MD5 of the downloaded CD?
2007-05-30T10:25:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	no, but the cd has checked itself
2007-05-30T10:26:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	and found itself to be ok
2007-05-30T10:26:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	where exactly does it ask for the other CD?
2007-05-30T10:26:00.000Z	balachmar		during installation of packages
2007-05-30T10:27:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	i suggest you check the MD5, cuz i think its a problem with the CD
2007-05-30T10:27:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	it is at 85% of the installation
2007-05-30T10:29:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	can I still md5 the cd then?
2007-05-30T10:30:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	you have to check the MD5 of the CD iso you downloaded
2007-05-30T10:30:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	I can't even change the cd, because it doesn't open the tray :)
2007-05-30T10:30:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	it wont.. just press ctrl-alt-del
2007-05-30T10:31:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	thanks I'm going to check it now, and  maybe burn another one.
2007-05-30T10:31:00.000Z	kalpik	balachmar	good luck :)
2007-05-30T10:32:00.000Z	kalpik		Cheese, try doubli clicking the file..
2007-05-30T10:52:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	you won't believe it, but the CD is fine...
2007-05-30T10:52:00.000Z	balachmar	kalpik	maybe it is the ide connector then...
