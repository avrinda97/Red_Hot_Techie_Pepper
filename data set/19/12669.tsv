2005-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	linux uses what you have, free doesn't report very accurate numbers as well
2005-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	Super_BQ	calc	anotherwords more ram = faster performance?
2005-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	calc		the -/+ buffers/cache first number is not just what your apps are using
2005-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	calc		it also includes other stuff like inode cache, etc
2005-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	yea
2005-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	i run kde on 128mb at work in vmware and it only shows like its using around 60MB ram
2005-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	on my home box running gnome and firefox it shows its using 464MB (probably not too accurate)
2005-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	Super_BQ		well.. I think I need to find out hot to Disable NETBIOS over TCP/IP in an effort to get Samba going through firestater
2005-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	there are ways to get more accurate numbers but its not simple to do
2005-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	Super_BQ	calc	so TOP won't do?
2005-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	well with firefox the numbers may actually be accurate
2005-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	calc	Super_BQ	you can look at /proc/(pid)/status to see
