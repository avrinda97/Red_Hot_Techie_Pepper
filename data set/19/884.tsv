2011-10-03T13:54:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	thanks
2011-10-23T12:58:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	not all dualcore processors are 64bit
2011-10-23T12:59:00.000Z	iceroot	auronandace	core2duo is amd64, core duo os sometimes only i686
2011-10-23T12:59:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	does he have a core2duo or a core duo?
2011-10-23T13:01:00.000Z	iceroot	auronandace	e5400 is amd64
2011-10-23T13:02:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	good stuff, i remember having a dualcore t60 but it was only 32bit (that is why i mentioned it)
2011-10-23T13:03:00.000Z	iceroot	auronandace	yes, must be a core duo instead of core2duo
2011-10-23T13:03:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	yes
2012-02-19T23:35:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	sounds worse than wubi :)
2012-04-02T22:43:00.000Z	iceroot	auronandace	people always need the newest software
2012-04-02T22:44:00.000Z	iceroot	auronandace	seems that newer is something like better for them
2012-04-02T22:45:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	i still don't understand the mindset though, why not use a rolling release then like arch that uses the latest stable version (oh well, ending off-topic rant)
2012-05-01T22:18:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	yes
2012-05-14T17:28:00.000Z	auronandace	iceroot	he already complained to me for showing that factoid
2012-05-14T17:29:00.000Z	iceroot	auronandace	ok
