2008-12-24T03:19:00.000Z	archman	bulio	jack is the sound driver just like the alsa or oss you got is; it's used for low latency, i use it in music production
2008-12-24T03:19:00.000Z	archman		!jack
2008-12-24T03:20:00.000Z	archman	bulio	maybe wanna try it?

2008-12-24T03:21:00.000Z	archman	bulio	sorry then, try to ask again, maybe some expert might help you; also try to check if there is irc channel for the driver you used. you know which you used?
