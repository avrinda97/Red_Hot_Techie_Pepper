2007-06-15T16:30:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	Have you verified the disk?
2007-06-15T16:31:00.000Z	palomer	PurpZeY	is there a utility to do that?
2007-06-15T16:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	It's on the install instructions page.
2007-06-15T16:35:00.000Z	palomer	PurpZeY	got a link to the install instruction page?
2007-06-15T16:39:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck?action=show&redirect=CDIntegrityCheck and also already recommended, I'd consider trying to use the aalternate install CD.
2007-06-15T16:42:00.000Z	palomer	PurpZeY	doing that right now
2007-06-15T16:43:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	If it turns out the CD is good. Try using the alternate install CD.
2007-06-15T16:45:00.000Z	palomer	PurpZeY	the alternate cd is 6.04?
2007-06-15T16:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	It's the same version, everything the same, but the install isn't GUI I believe.
2007-06-15T16:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	It is just used on older or stubborn machines.
2007-06-15T16:47:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	No, I meant the alternate install CD.
2007-06-15T16:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	palomer	I'm headed out, but I'm sure just about anyone can point you to the alternate install cd.
