2007-04-30T15:52:00.000Z	centinul		I have to restart networking on boot in Feisty... How do I verify that networking is even starting up?
2007-04-30T15:54:00.000Z	centinul		I have to restart the networking service after every boot in feisty. Why is this?
2007-04-30T15:55:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	it's hard to say without information
2007-04-30T15:55:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	well, what are you using for networking?
2007-04-30T15:56:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	how about drivers?
2007-04-30T15:56:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	any errors to report? Logs? Things like that
2007-04-30T15:57:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	the best log is syslog, not messages - for some reason syslog is better.
2007-04-30T15:57:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	ls /etc/rc5.d/ I believe.
2007-04-30T16:00:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	OK, my bad, that's the right folder
2007-04-30T16:00:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	what are you using for networking?
2007-04-30T16:00:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	OK, in that case, what card are you using?
2007-05-01T16:01:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	are you wireless? Let's get that straight...
2007-05-01T16:01:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	OK, can you send me /var/log/syslog?
2007-05-01T16:02:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	link to it in /etc/rcS.d/
2007-05-01T16:04:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	cd /etc/rcS.d/; ln -s <path to script> S40<name>
2007-05-01T16:04:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	the number tells it in what position should it be launched, so the lower the number, the closer to first place it is
2007-05-01T16:04:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	sorry the S<number> is what I meant
2007-05-01T16:05:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	oh, no kidding! What does it use to boot?
2007-05-01T16:06:00.000Z	javaJake	centinul	OK, then use folder /etc/rc2.d/ instead...
