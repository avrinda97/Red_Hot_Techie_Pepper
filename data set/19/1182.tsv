2011-04-17T17:26:00.000Z	niohubala{AFK}		it's /dev/sda2 in your case
2011-04-17T17:26:00.000Z	Gucci	niohubala{AFK}	yes sir. that would be it lol
2011-04-17T17:26:00.000Z	Gucci	niohubala{AFK}	now I just need help using this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Custom%20Menu%20Entries
2011-04-17T17:27:00.000Z	niohubala{AFK}	Gucci	I'm no expert but try adding this to /boot/grub/grub.cfg: http://pastebin.com/iCZFk5Kn
2011-04-17T17:28:00.000Z	Gucci	niohubala{AFK}	I think that may just be applicable to Grub. 10.10 uses grub 2
2011-04-17T17:28:00.000Z	niohubala{AFK}		It was taken from my grub.cfg file and I'm on grub 2
2011-04-17T17:28:00.000Z	Gucci		Does anyone have enough experience to know how to add custom menu entries to grub 2?
2011-04-17T17:29:00.000Z	Gucci		atleast explain steps to me?
