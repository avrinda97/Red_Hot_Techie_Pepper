2009-07-22T21:32:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	legend2440	reason I wanted to install 3.5.1 because 3.0 was quite slow when click tab to tab , delay when scrolling and etc.Now it super smooth

2009-12-26T21:28:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	legend2440	It work on my other state/city but not my city.The state city where I live isn't on the list.
