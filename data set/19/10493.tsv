2006-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	Snowfairy		Here's a question... sometimes apps start flashing... and they -don't- stop.
2006-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	Snowfairy		How the heck do I get them to stop that? :(
2006-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	akudewan	Snowfairy	what exactly do u mean by "flashing" ?
2006-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	Snowfairy	akudewan	well, the part in the panel.  it flashses.
2006-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	Snowfairy		grows bright, and then goes dim
2006-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	Snowfairy		and it just keeps doing that...  again and again and again and again and again....
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	akudewan	Snowfairy	that will happen when the window demands attention, for instance whenever someone says your name in xchat, you will see the flashing
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	Snowfairy	akudewan	yes, I understand that.  but, it doesn't stop.
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	Snowfairy		even after I look at it.
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	akudewan		u use KDE or gnome ?
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	Snowfairy		not to mention I don't really need a window to say look at me unless I really want to monitor it anyways :P
2006-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	Snowfairy		Gnome
2006-06-13T13:33:00.000Z	akudewan	Snowfairy	maybe if you change some settings you can make it stop, I don't use gnome, so I can't give you exact instructions
2006-06-13T13:33:00.000Z	Snowfairy	akudewan	searching throught gconf-editor, can't seem to find anything ;(
2006-06-13T13:35:00.000Z	akudewan	Snowfairy	I think this is a bug, have a look at this page: https://launchpad.net/products/libwnck/+bug/31134
2006-06-13T13:36:00.000Z	Snowfairy		staindtx wiki is kinda like a colloboratively edited website.  Very neat.
2006-06-13T13:36:00.000Z	Snowfairy	akudewan	taking a look. :)
2006-06-13T13:39:00.000Z	akudewan	Snowfairy	I found a way to disable it: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/113
