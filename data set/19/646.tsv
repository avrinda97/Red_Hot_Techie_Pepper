2011-12-20T20:08:00.000Z	nb-ben		unless you want the CD to have packages for an offline installation, there is no difference to you
2011-12-20T20:08:00.000Z	nb-ben		since you will probably want to update the packages on the cd after installing them anyway

2011-12-20T20:09:00.000Z	nb-ben		first result is it lol
2011-12-20T20:10:00.000Z	nb-ben		yes voldyman
2011-12-20T20:11:00.000Z	nb-ben		or you could manually edit /etc/passwd as root if you're into doing things wrong
2011-12-20T20:11:00.000Z	nb-ben		yep
2011-12-20T20:12:00.000Z	nb-ben		lol
2011-12-20T20:12:00.000Z	nb-ben		well you didn't do it yourself
2011-12-20T20:12:00.000Z	nb-ben		and to know this is what I would have to do
2011-12-20T20:13:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	If you don't know the answer to a question, you don't need to answer.
2011-12-20T20:34:00.000Z	nb-ben	Pici	like adding the wine repository to get the bleeding edge version of wine
2011-12-20T20:34:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	As long as those repositories are designed for that particular release of Ubuntu.
2011-12-20T20:35:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	I completely disagree.
2011-12-20T20:36:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	It is safer to use package mangagement whenever possible.
2011-12-20T20:39:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	Many source packages do not provide a make uninstall target.
2011-12-20T20:39:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	Thats not always feasible or desired.
2011-12-20T20:40:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	yes you can.
2011-12-20T20:41:00.000Z	Pici	nb-ben	Discarding that, no. If you feel comfortable with it you may install from source.
