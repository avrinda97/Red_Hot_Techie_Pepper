2011-12-21T10:06:00.000Z	skegeek		How long has Unity been Ubuntu's default desktop??
2011-12-21T10:06:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	since 10.10 I think? or was it 11.04..
2011-12-29T11:42:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	looks like X is having an issue probing your monitor.. is it getting the EDID?
2011-12-29T11:44:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	find out by looking at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-12-29T11:44:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	hmm.. does your monitor support that mode with the driver your using?
2011-12-29T11:48:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	well if your not using VGA1 thats fine.. many computers have more than 1 output
2011-12-29T11:51:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	thats not your monitor persay, thats your Video Output
2011-12-29T12:01:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	haha most definitly
2011-12-29T12:10:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	you can just kill X
2011-12-29T12:15:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	do you have any kind of window decoration?
2011-12-29T12:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	it will only load one X driver, not 2
2011-12-29T12:21:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	yeahâ€¦ tahts how X works when it tries to figure stuff out on its own, it loads the 3 best drivers, then gets rid of the 2 worst ones, vesa and fbdev are getting unloaded eventually
2011-12-29T12:26:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	yeah its definitely intel.. can you post me the entire Xorg log?
2011-12-29T12:29:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	odd.. your xorg log doesnt match your error message.. your modeline.. what refresh rate did you set it as?
2011-12-29T12:35:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	it could also be a limitation of your driver man, im just reading your log thats all
2011-12-29T12:36:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	yeah, pretty much.. just look at the log. under the VGA1 section, the max supported probe res is 1024x768
2011-12-29T12:37:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	nah, but it could be X barfing, no idea, but I dont think its related
2011-12-29T12:41:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	different video output
2011-12-29T12:41:00.000Z	DrPenguin	skegeek	if you look in your Xorg log, LVDS1 can do up to 1280x800 or whatever.. thats your monitor display
