2004-11-15T12:26:00.000Z	jdub	janice	reboot, hit escape when it prompts you, choose 'recovery mode'
2004-11-15T12:26:00.000Z	jdub	janice	then type 'visudo' at the prompt
2004-11-15T12:26:00.000Z	jdub	janice	copy the root line, swap 'root' with your user name
2004-11-15T12:26:00.000Z	jdub	janice	then reboot
2004-11-15T12:27:00.000Z	jdub	janice	your user is not in sudoers, right?
2004-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	janice	jdub	correct
2004-11-15T12:31:00.000Z	janice	jdub	mercurus: I am in recover mode and at a root@alanhod: prompt
2004-11-15T12:32:00.000Z	janice	jdub	mercurus: should I type visudo?
2004-11-15T12:36:00.000Z	janice	jdub	mercurus: visudo presented me with a screen that I knew nothing about.
2004-11-15T12:52:00.000Z	jdub	janice	:wq
2004-11-15T12:53:00.000Z	janice	jdub	BrittBS: LOL
2004-11-15T13:03:00.000Z	jdub	janice	choose ext3
2004-11-15T13:02:00.000Z	jdub	janice	you changed your user's home directory?
2004-11-15T13:11:00.000Z	jdub	janice	what's on the disk at the moment?
2004-11-15T13:12:00.000Z	janice	jdub	At the moment, there are three fat32 partitions. one ext3 partition and 80 gig of unusable space.
2004-11-15T13:13:00.000Z	jdub	janice	80GB? crap. where does it say 'unusable'?
2004-11-15T13:15:00.000Z	janice	jdub	In all partitioning tools I throw at it. It was created after I had used qtparted from System_rescueCD to create more space on a 120 reiserfs partition only to learn later that qtparted has problems with reiserfs. Have I lost this space forever?
2004-11-15T13:21:00.000Z	jdub	janice	i doubt it, but it seems strange.
2004-11-15T13:21:00.000Z	jdub	janice	perhaps one partition was created incorrectly.
