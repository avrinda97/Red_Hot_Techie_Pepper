2011-07-11T04:49:00.000Z	carldondesk		when i try to format my hard drive inside of the jumpdrive-ubuntu (fully updated) using Disk Utility I get a 'Partition busy on /dev/sda' error
2011-07-11T04:50:00.000Z	carldondesk		!format
2011-07-11T04:50:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	for formatting drive mussn't be mounted
2011-07-11T04:50:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	use gparted and rightclick> unmount it first
2011-07-11T04:51:00.000Z	carldondesk		I'll try gparted then, i was using the ubu disk util
2011-07-11T05:01:00.000Z	carldondesk	DasEi	download and ran gparted - error Failed to run /usr/sbin/gparted as user root. Unable to copy xauth file.
2011-07-11T05:02:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	gksudo gparted from terminal ?
2011-07-11T05:02:00.000Z	carldondesk		by live you mean without loading ubuntu and just loading bash?
2011-07-11T05:03:00.000Z	carldondesk		ok gksudo worked, thank you
2011-07-11T05:03:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	and again, the drive has to be unmounted, so unless you want a format an additional drive.. need another environment
2011-07-11T05:08:00.000Z	carldondesk	DasEi	I believe I'll be able to format.  The drive is laid out in NTFS on two parts sda1&2, 1 is boot.  do i delete then format to ext4?
2011-07-11T05:08:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	is that a second disk ?
2011-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	carldondesk		yes, i'm booted from jump
2011-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	and you want a fresh linux install after ?
2011-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	carldondesk		yes
2011-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	then you can just choose make new partitontable, then use the installer (which also could have done that), you're aware that all data on that drive is lost then, nor ?
2011-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	carldondesk		dasei yes i'm aware, i've backed up important stuff
2011-07-11T05:12:00.000Z	carldondesk		i actually wanted to install from network, i have the install iso on my laptop
2011-07-11T05:13:00.000Z	DasEi	carldondesk	np then, device > new table > msdos
