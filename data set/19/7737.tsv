2007-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	jeremysan		hi all, im trying to follow the NDISwrapper installation wiki, (http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,installation/) and the first thing it says is "You need a recent kernel at, least 2.6.6 or 2.4.26"  can somebody explain to me what that means and how I can acoomplish/make sure I have that done?
2007-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	jeremysan	don't use that wiki.  ndiswrapper is in the repositories.  Just install the deb file
2007-07-04T12:58:00.000Z	jeremysan	Flannel	how do I install it using the deb file?
2007-07-04T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	jeremysan	sneakernet the deb file (and it's depends, which may be one additional ndiswrapper file or so), and then double click it.  And it'll install
2007-07-04T12:59:00.000Z	jeremysan	Flannel	how do I "sneakernet" the deb file (from where?)..
2007-07-04T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	jeremysan	I believe you want this package: http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/misc/ndiswrapper-utils-1.9  If you look at the bottom, theres a table, click on your arch, you'll go to a page of mirrors with the deb for dowload.  Also, you see that it depends on ndiswrapper-common, you'll want to download that as well.
2007-07-04T13:05:00.000Z	jeremysan	Flannel	I have downloaded and installed both NDISwrapper and the commons.  Is it fully installed/functional or is there something else I need to do?

2007-07-04T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	jeremysan	Uh, once theyre installed, theyre installed.  You need to configure them/whatever.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide#head-831cb2664b6c6a8bee23aaf8e0356e39edf9a01e
2007-07-07T09:04:00.000Z	Flannel	jeremysan	you need to open your editor with sudo
