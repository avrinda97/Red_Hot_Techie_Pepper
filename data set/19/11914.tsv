2006-11-24T13:24:00.000Z	anton_		ernz: it's a kde installation. konqueror is pretty impressive software :)
2006-11-24T13:25:00.000Z	anton_		ernz: i imagine mandriva will mount it with a simple mount command
2006-11-24T13:26:00.000Z	anton_		ernz: if it doesn't, you're in trouble... (missing ntfs libraries)
2006-11-24T13:27:00.000Z	anton_		ernz: something like mount /dev/hda1 <mountpoint> should work for root :)
2006-11-24T13:29:00.000Z	anton_		ernz: what does cat /proc/partitions say?
2006-11-24T13:30:00.000Z	anton_		ernz: mobo? isn't that something from austin powers?
2006-11-24T13:31:00.000Z	anton_		chris_swift_kubu: what does cat /proc/partitions say?
2006-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	anton_		ubuto: is all printing done with cups, or just network printing?
2006-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	anton_		darko: sounds like you need a pgp key to get in.
2006-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	ubotu is a bot, and yes, all printing is done through cups. when you use the wizard, it adds the printer in cups.
2006-11-24T13:34:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	cups is sweet. i even have windows connecting to it directly. no more messy samba configs. =)
2006-11-24T13:35:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	just use ipp if all your winboxen are win2k+. winme and below require samba though.
2006-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	and sorush: you have to add the cups user to the shadow group first. it can't read the password otherwise. then you just use your username and password if your user is in the lpadmin group. (it is by default)
2006-11-24T13:43:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	lol. /etc/shadow is unreadable to anything that's not root or in the shadow group. =)
2006-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	but the cupsys daemon doesn't run as root. more secure that way. hence the need to add it to the shadow group.
2006-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	and it's not in the shadow group by default because of paranoia. ;)
2006-11-24T13:45:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	np. also, the fact that cupsys doesn't run as root is because of security again. =)
2006-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	Terminus	anton_	well, only root has rw to shadow...
