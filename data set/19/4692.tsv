2011-03-23T01:58:00.000Z	guedesav		okay, I think I updated my xserver-xorg packages and it pretty much messed my X
2011-03-23T01:59:00.000Z	guedesav		now when I restart the computer Ubuntu doesn't recognize input unless I deactivate and reactivate the evdev module, and then restart the server
2011-03-23T01:59:00.000Z	guedesav		also, none of the terminal emulators work, anyone have any idea why?
2011-03-23T02:00:00.000Z	guedesav		also, ctrl-alt-backspace doesn't work anymire... I don't want to reinstall Ubuntu, in fact I wish I could revert it to my previous configuration
2011-03-23T02:01:00.000Z	guedesav		anyone knows if there's some sort of "revert" for APT?
