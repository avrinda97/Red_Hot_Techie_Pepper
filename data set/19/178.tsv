2012-08-28T02:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		ive noticed some copy-protected 'dvd' movies - dont want to play right for me lately. :( except in my new blue ray player
2012-08-28T02:29:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	those kind of discs should be denied the DVD logo.
2012-08-28T02:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 they DONT have the dvd logo.. they are still sold as dvd movies..
2012-08-28T02:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 looking at the cases now. :) Some are able to work.. but i got some just released shows that i cant even watch on my windows pcs ;(
2012-08-28T02:30:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	I recently bought a R1 DVD by mistake. I had to decrypt the bloody thing to able to watch it, Region Coding is madness...
2012-08-28T02:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 these are for my region.. they just wouldent play in the wifes old dvd player, or any pc i tried.
2012-08-28T02:34:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	try DVDFab, it runs through Wine. If it's legal to decrypt it for home use depends on your local law.
2012-08-28T02:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 these disks were to new for dvdfab to work on them. :) it did work on some older disks..
2012-08-28T02:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 i was impressed with dvdfab and how well it worked.. but i couldent figure out its priceing/licensing to buy it, :)
2012-08-28T02:36:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	whoa, must be a really popular series than, DRM hurts the wrong people, it should be abolished.
2012-08-28T02:36:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	than => then
2012-08-28T02:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 i doubt if very many people wanted to pirate 'The courtship of eddies father season 1'
2012-08-28T02:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 or 'the love boat season 1'  (yes my wife wanted weird shows)
2012-08-28T02:37:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	Love Boat, do they protect it that harshly that it wouldn't even play on your wife's old DVD player? That's ludicrous...
2012-08-28T02:38:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	you should have returned the set, telling them that it's not a DVD.
2012-08-28T02:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 She wanted it....   I went and bought a new blueray player for her to use.. :)
2012-08-28T02:39:00.000Z	Meris	Dr_Willis	well, vote with your wallet, I'd say. I would have searched for another edition instead.
2012-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meris	 there is none.. and last i looked at teh stores Most all the new releases  have some sort of protection.
