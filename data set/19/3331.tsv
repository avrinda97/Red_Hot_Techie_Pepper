2009-09-11T07:04:00.000Z	JTrunner		you don't need to do much configuration with Ubuntu
2009-09-11T07:06:00.000Z	JTrunner		need help with sshd. can nayone help?
2009-09-11T07:06:00.000Z	JTrunner		anyone
2009-09-11T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	are you on the server now?
2009-09-11T07:08:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	no. it's at work. I'm trying to set up a ubuntu server. checked the sshd_configure files, made sure ports are open
2009-09-11T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	well the first step would be to see if you can "ssh localhost" on the server
2009-09-11T07:09:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	it refused
2009-09-11T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	what was the exact output?
2009-09-11T07:09:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	the message was that the connection was refused
2009-09-11T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	did you install openssh-server?
2009-09-11T07:10:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	i did istall
2009-09-11T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	did you check that sshd was running?
2009-09-11T07:10:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	yes
2009-09-11T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	that shouldn't be the case on a default install.  If you install the openssh-server package, you should be able to "ssh localhost" immediately afterwards
2009-09-11T07:11:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	that's what I thought
2009-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	is there anything not default about your install?
2009-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	no
2009-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	JTrunner	you don't have access to the server now, correct?
2009-09-11T07:13:00.000Z	JTrunner	jrib	no
