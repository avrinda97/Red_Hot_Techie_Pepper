2009-06-16T14:05:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	wow.. you're one of those guys that think everyone understands english.. if.. you.. only.. talk.. slowly.. or in your case.. USE CAPITAL LETTERS. Why not add some info to your question instead of having a fit
2009-06-16T14:06:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	and repeating a question every 60 seconds will only get you kicked out of here.. no matter how angry you are
2009-06-16T14:06:00.000Z	rne1223	Slart	dude...I just needed to know if somebody was listening. If you guys don't know that is cool, but don't just ignore the question
2009-06-16T14:07:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	there are over a thousand people here.. if everyone answered to every question this channel would be useless..
2009-06-16T14:07:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	when people don't answer it usually means your question is badly worded .. or they just don't know
2009-06-16T14:08:00.000Z	rne1223	Slart	Man I'm not going to get into a word fight with you...if you don't know what I"m talking about...then that is fine
2009-06-16T14:08:00.000Z	rne1223	Slart	Thanks for your input
2009-06-16T14:12:00.000Z	rne1223		I would like to change my OpenGl render from " Software Rasterizer" to " Intel 945GM..." does somebody knows how to do this?
2009-06-16T14:13:00.000Z	rne1223		I would greatly appreciate it.
2009-06-16T14:13:00.000Z	Slart		!intel | rne1223, this might be affecting you.. not sure if it would go back to software rendering though.. but it might be worth a read
2009-06-16T14:14:00.000Z	rne1223		alright thanks
2009-06-16T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	you might want to check in /var/log/Xorg.0.log too.. if there were errors when initializing you graphics hardware they ought to show up there
2009-06-16T14:18:00.000Z	rne1223	Slart	The thing is that when I start my computer I get direct rendering. But after I play OpenArena it goes to Software rendering
2009-06-16T14:18:00.000Z	rne1223	Slart	Let me check the logs
2009-06-16T14:19:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	the logs won't help you then.. it's created when X starts up
2009-06-16T14:21:00.000Z	rne1223	Slart	Maybe...but I don't think that is the problem. I think that it has something to do with the game since it switches after I play it
2009-06-16T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	rne1223	yup.. might be openarena... or the opengl drivers..
