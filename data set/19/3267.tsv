2010-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	I posted a link somewhere above on a very simple tutorial on how to make your system dual-boot with windows
2010-03-27T10:20:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	Can explain, what exactly don't you understand?
2010-03-27T10:20:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	MBR is the first part of the disk, Master Boot Record, this is the place where bootloader resides
2010-03-27T10:21:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	You'll recognize your Linux partition by it's filesystem, it is most likely ext4
2010-03-27T10:21:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	Any existing folder actually :D
2012-01-09T12:37:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	pm me with the details. Sure.

2012-01-22T22:37:00.000Z	plustax	theadmin	oh hi there!
2012-01-22T22:38:00.000Z	plustax	theadmin	long time no talk. Think you could help me get that stuff working with my gnome3?
2012-01-22T22:38:00.000Z	theadmin	plustax	I don't use gnome3 but I guess there's no big deal, install compiz and ccsm and make compiz start with your gnome3...
2012-01-22T22:41:00.000Z	plustax	theadmin	how do I make it run with gnome3 like you said? I have both things downloaded
