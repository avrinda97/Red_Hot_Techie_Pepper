2011-02-04T06:41:00.000Z	Brandon___		Hi, everyone. I'm using the Wubi installer on a raid 0 system and am getting an error that states the root filesystem isn't defined.
2011-02-04T06:42:00.000Z	Brandon___		Anyone have a solution to this?
2011-02-04T06:43:00.000Z	Brandon___		er, 8 GB ram I mean
2011-02-04T06:45:00.000Z	Brandon___		So, does anyone have a solution to the root file system error on a wubi install?
2011-02-04T06:46:00.000Z	Brandon___		Anyone here familiar with Wubi at all?
2011-02-04T06:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Brandon___	experienced users don't use Wubi, so support is a little "thin"
2011-02-04T06:47:00.000Z	Brandon___	ZykoticK9	I didn't need to be told that I was inexperienced.
2011-02-04T06:48:00.000Z	Brandon___		That was kinda rude
2011-02-04T06:48:00.000Z	Brandon___		This would be true if it wasn't for the fact that I've tried this over a multitude of reinstalls of windows over the past as new releases of ubuntu have been released.
2011-02-04T06:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Brandon___	Wubi is for testing if you like ubuntu or not, or if it meets your needs.  I'm sorry i didn't mean to be rude, but i'm afraid it's the truth.  (no the you being inexperienced, that experienced users don't use Wubi, thus the support is rather lacking)
2011-02-04T06:49:00.000Z	Brandon___		in other words, it's a recurring issue
2011-02-04T06:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Brandon___	very
2011-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	Brandon___	ZykoticK9	that's what the Live CD is for...I plan on using it along-side windows. The best part about Wubi is the fact that I can boot to it through the default boot menu (which I'm aware is easy) right out of the box, and also allows me to seamlessly browse my existing file system without having to do any pesky formatting
2011-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	Brandon___		overall, it's less hassle
2011-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	Brandon___		that's why I'd rather use that as opposed to a full-fledged installation
2011-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	Brandon___		My system has a raid0, if this is a clue.
2011-02-04T06:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Brandon___	making Ubuntu rely on Windows is "in my opinion!" a terrible idea.  But if Wubi is what you want - go for it.  Best of luck man, enjoy Ubuntu.
2011-02-04T06:52:00.000Z	Brandon___		Yes but I came in search of a solution to get Wubi to work.
2011-02-04T06:55:00.000Z	Brandon___	ZykoticK9	jimcooncat, bazhang. Here's what I do. I install Ubuntu through Wubi like normal. It finishes, I reboot, and the entry for Ubuntu is added in the bootloader. Ubuntu then loads and continues installation from there. However, I get an error after a few seconds and loading that states "no root file system is defined"
