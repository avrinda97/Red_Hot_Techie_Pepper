2009-08-16T02:30:00.000Z	sartan		hello... does the ubuntu installer support software raid and lvm?  I'm looking to change from centos to ubuntu, and i'd like not to lose a few select partitions.
2009-08-16T02:31:00.000Z	DasEi	sartan	: yes, use alternate installer
2009-08-16T02:31:00.000Z	DasEi	sartan	: make sure you choose manual partitoning
2009-08-16T02:31:00.000Z	sartan		alternate? thanks
2009-08-16T02:32:00.000Z	DasEi		!alternate | sartan
2009-08-16T02:32:00.000Z	sartan		guys, i wouldn't have been able to figure that out without asking here, cheers. :)
2009-08-16T02:32:00.000Z	sartan		and i suppose there's few disadvantages to using the alternate installer? are there any groupinstall packages and such i won't be able to use later?
2009-08-16T02:33:00.000Z	sartan		(sorry for dropping a yum term) - i.e. yum install groupinstall desktop to drop on gnome, x, etc.
2009-08-16T02:33:00.000Z	sartan		fantastic
2009-08-16T02:34:00.000Z	sartan		does ubuntu keep wine relatively up to date?
2009-08-16T02:34:00.000Z	sartan		centos is still at 0.9x
2009-08-16T02:35:00.000Z	DasEi		!latest | sartan
2009-08-16T02:35:00.000Z	DasEi		!info wine | sartan
2009-08-16T02:36:00.000Z	sartan	DasEi	it's typically 'bad mojo' to screw with compiling packages for centos, are there build templates for ubuntu so i could upgrade to a shiny new wine?
2009-08-16T02:36:00.000Z	sartan		whatever the dpkg framework is.... folder structure, post install scripts
2009-08-16T02:37:00.000Z	DasEi	sartan	yes, go to wine - hp;; for further support join #winehq
2009-08-16T02:37:00.000Z	sartan	DasEi	Not realy asking for wine support, just more on how feasible it is to screw with this under ubuntu. seems like it's going to be ok
2009-08-16T02:38:00.000Z	sartan		Thanks for your tips and links, they are helpful.
2009-08-16T02:38:00.000Z	DasEi	sartan	no issue, own risk XD
