2008-01-16T16:54:00.000Z	g0rbeh		Good morning, I booted ubuntu this morning and it seems to have lost all the screen / grahpics cards settings, the x.org.conf still looks fine with all my old things in it
2008-01-16T16:55:00.000Z	g0rbeh		when i look in the the "Screen / resolution" applet it looks like my graphics cards / monitor are now not detected
2008-01-16T16:55:00.000Z	g0rbeh		im running at a riddiculously low res
2008-01-16T16:57:00.000Z	g0rbeh		Hmm I see now its seems my monitor has changed somehow, if thats possible
2008-01-16T16:58:00.000Z	g0rbeh		yeah it works, I didnt expect it to
2008-01-16T16:58:00.000Z	g0rbeh		But now, for example in nvidia X server settings app the screen is called "CRT-0" not the old name
