2011-02-28T09:31:00.000Z	biffhero		Has anyone heard of ubuntu kernel (from the 10.10 installer) causing a blade to segfault?  I do an install to a hard drive on my RLX blade, and it won't boot completely.  I have no console, so can't see the messages.  I am in a reboot loop, the last thing I see is the final RLX bios screen, then then the next thing I see is the RLX bios memory counter.
2011-02-28T09:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	I"m not sure what a blade is maybe the kernel is the wrong archatechture?
2011-02-28T09:45:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	yeah, that's what I thought.  uname -a on another one shows me that I have an i686 architechture installed.  But to be sure, I am downloading the 386 server iso right now.  These have transmeta CPUs on them.
2011-02-28T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	it might need the arm build
2011-02-28T09:46:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	hrmmâ€¦  here's "uname -a" from another one.  "Linux fork 2.6.18-4-686 #1 SMP Mon Mar 26 17:17:36 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux"
2011-02-28T09:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	what is that?  one that is working?
2011-02-28T09:48:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	yessir, this one is working fine.
2011-02-28T09:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	then it should work fine with an i386 build  or 32bit as we call them
2011-02-28T09:49:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	 agreed.
2011-02-28T09:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	it might have limited mem so maybe needs a custom build without any uneeded stuf
2011-02-28T09:50:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	would that limited memory cause the kernel to not boot?  that's a good idea.  These have 256M RAM.
2011-02-28T09:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	of course it would cause a problem,  you need about 512meg to run ubuntu these days
2011-02-28T09:51:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	 holy cats.  That's amazing.  How can I set it to use less?
2011-02-28T09:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	strip out all uneeded modules
2011-02-28T09:53:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	 ahh, thanks.  I will look into making a smaller setup.
2011-02-28T09:56:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements says 128M should be fine.  ugh.  But I do see there's some "low memory systems" instructions.  I will try that.  Thanks.
2011-02-28T09:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	there is the minimal install cd like about 50meg  you might try
2011-02-28T09:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	biffhero	I stand corrected it's only 12meg https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2011-02-28T10:05:00.000Z	biffhero	sacarlson	thanks.
