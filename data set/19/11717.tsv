2005-12-03T09:36:00.000Z	arg|bx		can anyone help with the installer?
2005-12-03T09:38:00.000Z	arg|bx		it never creates the logfile i'm supposed to look at
2005-12-03T09:40:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	the normal install will still let you choose partitions
2005-12-03T09:43:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	so it will use partitions i created for it, without disturbing existing ones, in normal install mode?
2005-12-03T09:43:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	yes, just choose manual partitioning when asked
2005-12-03T09:44:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	... and specify which ones you want as /, /boot (or whatever)
2005-12-03T09:45:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	right, thats what i've done with the expert install. it did whine about "rather strange layouts" on some of the partitions, but none of the ones i want it involved with
2005-12-03T09:46:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	ah, k, i'm also wondering if it could be a bad CD (or burned from a bad ISO)
2005-12-03T09:47:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto (although if you're playing with partitions you'll probably know most of that :) )
2005-12-03T09:48:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	well, i *did* merely assume that the iso was ok :)
2005-12-03T09:48:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	:)
2005-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	i have no idea why it was stopping before, the simple installer seems to have gone right on by the kernel installation...
2005-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	k, that's strange but good i guess :)
2005-12-03T10:12:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	i guess, but after you mentioned verifying the iso i asked the d-i to check the cd integrity.. it failed instantly..
2005-12-03T10:13:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	ah, but it's installing anyway?
2005-12-03T10:13:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	yes
2005-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	bimberi	arg|bx	well that's ... um ... interesting :)
2005-12-03T10:15:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	well, it could be the d-i doesn't do the verification properly after the installer has started
2005-12-03T10:15:00.000Z	arg|bx	bimberi	i tried to run it a second time but it wouldn't admit the cd was an ubuntu cd
