2010-03-06T12:29:00.000Z	mr-grey2		Kubuntu/Xubuntu  and ubuntu, is there really a big diffrence of the three? I heard that one of those versions could help my issue and I do not need to blow away my system to one, just add the extra packages
2010-03-06T12:29:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	They're the same under the surface, but have different look and feel.
2010-03-06T12:29:00.000Z	Bede		If you've got one installed, installing another is easy
2010-03-06T12:30:00.000Z	Bede		Just do: sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop (or whatever version), then you can choose your flavour at boot-up time
2010-03-06T12:30:00.000Z	mr-grey2	Bede	Thank you. I heard that those two do not use pulseaudio and that could be causing my audio problems. I have nothing going on tonight and this drive is a linux test for me to learn anyhow hehe
2010-03-06T12:31:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	good luck! They're all good versions - I hope you find one that works for you
2010-03-06T12:31:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	When I used to use Kubuntu, I did without pulseaudio, although it was there as an option.
2010-03-06T12:33:00.000Z	mr-grey2	Bede	Thanks again, I'll try and install one. just have to decide on xubuntu or kubuntu.. Something easy since I'm a noob lol
2010-03-06T12:33:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	Overall, you'll find xubuntu simpler. KDE is great, but much more customizable and fiddly, I'd say
2010-03-06T12:34:00.000Z	mr-grey2		like making menus melt when you close them Bede? lol
2010-03-06T12:35:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	Ha! No, I like Compiz for that. I used Kubuntu for about a year and loved it, but I'd certainly start with gnome or XFCE if you're quite new to linux
2010-03-06T12:36:00.000Z	mr-grey2	Bede	is Compiz a program to enhance your desktop like windowblinds for microsoft?
2010-03-06T12:37:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	Yes, that's right. Many people use it with Gnome. Gnome can be a little heavy on resources; if you have a problem with that then you'll probably like XFCE
2010-03-06T12:38:00.000Z	Bede		Curly-Q: I don't think we were talking about servers! I think Mr-grey2 was asking about a non-server use
2010-03-06T12:39:00.000Z	mr-grey2		Yeah just personal use learning how to navagate linux yet still look wicked lol
2010-03-06T12:40:00.000Z	Bede		Curly-Q - sure, but many people like it
2010-03-06T12:40:00.000Z	mr-grey2		I stumbled across ubuntu "satanic edition" on a website lol
2010-03-06T12:40:00.000Z	Bede		Curly-Q - each to their own!
2010-03-06T12:40:00.000Z	Bede	mr-grey2	Ha! I suppose it's a response to the christian edition?
