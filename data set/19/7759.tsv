2007-11-06T18:49:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	usually you just plug it in

2008-11-02T17:05:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	I know you can choose your decorator in ccsm.  Ask #compiz-fusion for a better way though
2008-11-02T17:08:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	what is ccsm?
2008-11-02T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	set your window decorator in ccsm
2008-11-02T18:03:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	It is already enabled
2008-11-02T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	what is?  Don't use "it"
2008-11-02T18:04:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	"Enable Window Decoration" in  CCSM
2008-11-02T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	you need to set that to use emerald
2008-11-02T18:04:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	and how do I do that?
2008-11-02T18:05:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	And how do I set the CCSM to use Emerald as the window decoration manager *
2008-11-02T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	when you click on "window decoration", it tells you the Command it will run.  Make that use "/usr/bin/emerald"
2008-11-02T18:05:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	thank you =)
2008-11-02T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	use Accessories -> Text Editor
2008-11-02T18:13:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	is that usuful, for programming? I need a good editor for CSS, PHP, html,xml etc
2008-11-02T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	Russian	yep, checkout all the plugins it has.  If you want a real editor, checkout vim (gvim).  Learning curve is steep though.  'vimtutor' to learn
2008-11-02T18:14:00.000Z	Russian	jrib	Thanks =)
