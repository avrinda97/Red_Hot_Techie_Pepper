2009-01-05T09:14:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	im not sure your apache is set up to handle more than 1 webserver, if your brother has one on port 80
2009-01-05T09:15:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	what does sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart do?
2009-01-05T09:18:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	sorry was that for me?
2009-01-05T09:19:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	it means type my name before your responce (if you're repsonding to me that is) responding*
2009-01-05T09:19:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	that part is normal
2009-01-05T09:20:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	the part that isnt normal is all that bit about user error
2009-01-05T09:28:00.000Z	eseven73	Grandslammaster	sorry was away, um no clue man
