2009-11-02T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 you have to copy the icon file over to the other pc's and set it up to be the icon for the executable. they are not embded in the executagles normally
2009-11-02T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 you could make a .desktop file for the executable and define the icon in there.
2009-11-02T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 the icons are defined on a per user basis.  not for everyone.   Unless you make a .desktop file.
2009-11-02T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 whever you want. thats how gnome defines menus/icons for specific programs
2009-11-02T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 put it along side the executable perhaps.
2009-11-02T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 example .desktop file -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1134028
2009-11-02T22:59:00.000Z	Guest81758	Dr_Willis	put it along side the executable perhaps__ sry i dont understand english very well, but, i need to put the .desktop file near the excutable in the external HD?
2009-11-02T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest81758	 if you want.. its seperate from the executable . it could be anywhere you want it to be at.
