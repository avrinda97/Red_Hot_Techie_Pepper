2005-02-16T06:53:00.000Z	Anubis		lol
2005-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	Anubis		thats why I suggest installing the latest from source
2005-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	Anubis		via cli
2005-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	Anubis		if so
2005-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	Anubis		I think I'll get the latest from the site
2005-02-16T06:55:00.000Z	Anubis		no
2005-02-16T06:55:00.000Z	Anubis		also the nvidia driver install does not work for all kernels
2005-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	Anubis		Linux ubuntu 2.6.8.1-4-k7 #1 Fri Jan 14 11:40:53 UTC 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
2005-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	Anubis		especially this kernel
2005-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	Anubis		I had to do it with the Nvida script
2005-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	it works for others
2005-02-16T06:57:00.000Z	Anubis	mdz	weird
2005-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	it sounds like you have too many already
2005-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	Anubis	mdz	hows that?
2005-02-19T09:57:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	the solution is not more repositories.  how did you get to this state?
2005-02-19T09:57:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	did you install warty and upgrade to hoary? install hoary? upgrade from Debian?
2005-02-19T09:58:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	and why do you think you need gnome-desktop-environment?
2005-02-19T10:02:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	some of the packages in universe are not installable at the moment; this is normal in a development branch
2005-04-03T11:31:00.000Z	mdz	Anubis	easy, now
