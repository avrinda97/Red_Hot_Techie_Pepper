2005-07-11T07:22:00.000Z	Mobius		how can I find out information about my kernel?>
2005-07-11T07:22:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	What type of information?
2005-07-11T07:23:00.000Z	Mobius	bddebian	: I am trying to see if its 386 or 686 or.. something (i am pretty new to this stuff =/)
2005-07-11T07:23:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	Get to a termina and do "sudo uname -a"
2005-07-11T07:24:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	Sorry, you don't need sudo for a uname -a
2005-07-11T07:25:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	That doesn't necessarily mean that you have a kernel built for 686
2005-07-11T07:26:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	Are you using a native Ubuntu install?
2005-07-11T07:28:00.000Z	Mobius	bddebian	what did you mean by native
2005-07-11T07:28:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	I mean you didn't build your own kernel?
2005-07-11T07:28:00.000Z	Mobius	bddebian	I just reinstalled ubuntu on my laptop - Ive been trying to get the sound to work
2005-07-11T07:29:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	Anyway, you can look at this from a terminal:  "apt-cache search linux-image-2.6"
2005-07-11T07:30:00.000Z	bddebian	Mobius	Are you just trying to upgrade your kernel just to fix a sound issue?
2005-07-11T07:30:00.000Z	Mobius	bddebian	I just remember last install I tried working on it my friend had me get 686 stuff I think
