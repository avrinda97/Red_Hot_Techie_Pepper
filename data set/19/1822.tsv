2011-06-03T13:49:00.000Z	shockrates		how can i find out what architecture my system is?
2011-06-03T13:50:00.000Z	oCean	shockrates	uname -m
2011-06-03T13:51:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	says x86_64
2011-06-03T13:51:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	is there a chance it is amd64 ?
2011-06-03T13:51:00.000Z	oCean	shockrates	in that case your OS is amd64
2011-06-03T13:52:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	in a site there was and x86_64 deb package and and amd64 package. The first didnt work for me
2011-06-03T13:52:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	so there must be a difference
2011-06-03T13:53:00.000Z	oCean	shockrates	no, the naming convention is i386 and amd64, or ia64 which is for Itanium 64 bit
2011-06-03T14:01:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	look here http://www.renoise.com/board/index.php?/topic/28279-linux-installation-packages/
2011-06-03T14:01:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	which package should i get/
2011-06-03T14:07:00.000Z	oCean	shockrates	I downloaded both packages, however it seems to fail, since both remain named <blah>.part. But in the end, both downloaded files are identical
2011-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	i clicked on it and it installs
2011-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	amd64 does x86_64 says wrong architecture
2011-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	mean amd64 installs
2011-06-03T14:09:00.000Z	oCean	shockrates	very weird. If you are concerned about that, you might try to contact the maintainers of that package.
2011-06-03T14:10:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	ok it installed
2011-06-03T14:10:00.000Z	shockrates	oCean	as amd64
2011-07-03T00:06:00.000Z	oCean	shockrates	read the link ubottu send you
