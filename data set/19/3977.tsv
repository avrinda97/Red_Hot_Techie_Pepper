2009-04-24T06:57:00.000Z	jeterfan1		if anybody could help, i'd b grateful
2009-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	9.04 is now the current release
2009-04-24T07:01:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	oy. you're better off just doing a fresh install from a CD :-\
2009-04-24T07:02:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	upgrading works, in theory. but generally if you install packages outside of the main repositories, you'll run into issues. also, fixes that you make in one release may not be needed in future releases, and can cause problems. you should be able to install again without having to backup /home
2009-04-24T07:03:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	how did you install your drivers?
2009-04-24T07:04:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	well maybe you can go into the hardware drivers app and disable them?
2009-04-24T07:18:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	rollbacks are not supported. how did you end up with a japanese cd?
2009-04-24T07:19:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	also, you should be able to specify the language at the livecd boot screen
2009-04-24T07:20:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	yeah right when the cd starts up it should pop up a menu listing all the languages
2009-04-24T07:21:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	and if it doesn't, hit f2 to open that menu
2009-04-24T07:22:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	is it hard to find a cd?
2009-04-24T07:24:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	i hear japan has fast internet ;-) just pick a nearby mirror
2009-04-24T07:27:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	nah just run the installer and partition manually
2009-04-24T07:28:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	then all you should have to do is "edit" the ext3 partition and tell it to use it as ext3, mount it at /
2009-04-24T07:28:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	you probably don't even need to back up /home, because that gets preserved now. as long as it doesn't say you're formatting the partition you're good
2009-04-24T07:29:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	nah it shouldn't take more than half an hour
2009-04-24T07:30:00.000Z	maccam941	jeterfan1	k, i might also be in here as maccam94
