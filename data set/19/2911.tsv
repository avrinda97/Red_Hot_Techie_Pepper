2010-02-01T19:55:00.000Z	McL0VIN	Pici	how can i tell
2010-02-01T19:56:00.000Z	Pici	McL0VIN	If you don't know, then you don't.  You need to be running something like xming or reflectionsX
2010-02-01T19:58:00.000Z	McL0VIN	Pici	kinja-sheep please take a look http://pastebin.ca/1774375
2010-02-01T20:00:00.000Z	Pici	McL0VIN	Starting the xserver on your linux computer doesn't help you.  You'd need to run X locally (on windows) in order to see grapihcal applications there.
