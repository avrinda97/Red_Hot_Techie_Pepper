2011-06-14T20:39:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	what's the error
2011-06-14T20:40:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	vino-preferences:29202): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:
2011-06-14T20:43:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	one esc
2011-06-14T20:45:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	works fine for me...did you run it in the background?
2011-06-14T20:45:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	no
2011-06-14T20:48:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	what happens if you do vino-preferences &
2011-06-14T20:48:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	also you're running X on the machine you're connecting  from right?
2011-06-14T20:49:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	er, no?
2011-06-14T20:49:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	you need x on the machine you're connecting from...all X11 forwarding does is use the ssh clients X as the display
2011-06-14T20:49:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	I thought I was supposed to run vino-preferences on the machine I'm connecting to
2011-06-14T20:50:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	it runs on the computer you connect to using the clients display
2011-06-14T20:51:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	so, if I'm connecting from A, A has to have X, right?
2011-06-14T20:51:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	yeah and it has to be open and running
2011-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	is there a way to run vino preferences without X? say, an ini file?
2011-06-14T20:54:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	i don't even know what vino is
2011-06-14T20:54:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	vnc won't help you either if you don't have X on the machine you're connecting from
2011-06-14T20:56:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	I said VPN, not VNC
2011-06-14T20:57:00.000Z	celthunder	Kartagis	ah sorry
2011-06-14T20:59:00.000Z	Kartagis	celthunder	vino allows you to connect via vnc. then I could do ssh tunneling and connect to my work machine via vinagre
