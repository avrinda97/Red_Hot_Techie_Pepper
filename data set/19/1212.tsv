2011-04-27T02:34:00.000Z	abountu		how can I change my desktop name with ubuntu?
2011-04-27T02:35:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	you want to change your machine's name?
2011-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	abountu	dd214	yes, I gave both my desktop and laptop the same name, and now I can't connect from one to the other
2011-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	bang this out in the terminal
2011-04-27T02:36:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	gksudo gedit /etc/hostname
2011-04-27T02:38:00.000Z	abountu	dd214	done, do I need to run something else for it to take effect?
2011-04-27T02:39:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	type this to see if your changes worked.... uname -n
2011-04-27T02:40:00.000Z	abountu		dd214:no, it's still the old name
2011-04-27T02:40:00.000Z	abountu		 dd214 which is different from cat /etc/hostname
2011-04-27T02:41:00.000Z	abountu		 dd214 I'd expect to run something to get the network to refresh..no?
2011-04-27T02:42:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	 one more thing.. you will need to update your host file too
2011-04-27T02:42:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	gksudo gedit /etc/hosts
2011-04-27T02:42:00.000Z	abountu		ok
2011-04-27T02:43:00.000Z	abountu	dd214	ok I edited /etc/hosts. and changed the line 127.0.0.1 from old to new hostname, anything else I need to do with that file?
2011-04-27T02:44:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	save both the hostname and hosts file correct?
2011-04-27T02:46:00.000Z	abountu	dd214	just confirm that all I need to do is basically change the 127.0.0.1 from old to new? if that's all than yes it's done, and still uname -n gives the old name
2011-04-27T02:46:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	if you've saved both, you'll need to reboot and your set.  once your back online run uname -n to verify the hostname is the new one.
2011-04-27T02:47:00.000Z	abountu	dd214	ok thanks
2011-04-27T02:47:00.000Z	dd214	abountu	you are correct, the hosts file is critical, 127.0.X.X or you'll lose the ability to sudo
