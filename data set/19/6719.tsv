2010-09-01T02:03:00.000Z	tripps		here's a question - since compositing/compiz makes watching videos of any resolution horrible, and I hate to do the metacity --replace since it consolidates my carefully placed windows on desktop 1, can I launch a second instance of X without compositing for purposes of gaming/watching video? If so, what is the best way to do so?
2010-09-01T02:05:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	Yes, start a second xserver on the :1 port.
2010-09-01T02:06:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	startx -- :1 in one of the F1-F6 consoles?
2010-09-01T02:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	Yes, start there.  Use F8 instead.   F1-F6 usually have a getty running.
2010-09-01T02:13:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	wow that didn't work very well. switching back crashed X
2010-09-01T02:13:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	also nothing on F8
2010-09-01T02:18:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	Sorry,  I meant put the second X server on F8 when you get the desired configuration.  Ubuntu puts the default X server on F7.
2010-09-01T02:19:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	You're doing something that almost nobody else wants.  The proprietary fglrx and nvidia drivers could be unstable.
2010-09-01T02:19:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	running on intel hardware
2010-09-01T02:20:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	Well, that hardware has some of the best drivers.
2010-09-01T02:20:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	 If possible, find a tolerable compiz configuration.
2010-09-01T02:21:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	not really possible I'm afraid
2010-09-01T02:21:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	How is the video quality currently unacceptable?
2010-09-01T02:21:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	running video on composited X is awful
2010-09-01T02:22:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	video lags, especially 720p, etc.
2010-09-01T02:22:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	lots of dropped frames
2010-09-01T02:22:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	commonly known/complained about :)
2010-09-01T02:22:00.000Z	dajhorn	tripps	Okay, yeah, you're screwed 720p on Intel HD.
2010-09-01T02:23:00.000Z	tripps	dajhorn	still think running lightweight X without compositing might do the trick
