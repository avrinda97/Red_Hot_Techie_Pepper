2005-01-05T12:14:00.000Z	shianux		hi, I'd like to ask a question, is anyone available?
2005-01-05T12:15:00.000Z	shianux		I installed warty off the i386 CD
2005-01-05T12:15:00.000Z	shianux		and then update upgraded to hoary
2005-01-05T12:16:00.000Z	shianux		during which I installed the nvidia drivers (dell inspiron 8000)
2005-01-05T12:16:00.000Z	shianux		what happened was I started off with 1400x1050 with a clean warty install
2005-01-05T12:17:00.000Z	shianux		and now with hoary + nvidia drivers I'm limited only to 640x480
2005-01-05T12:17:00.000Z	shianux		so does anyone have any idea how to restore 1400x1050 in my hoary+nvidia setup?

2005-01-06T09:55:00.000Z	ogra	shianux	imagine a package removes an icon from the icon dir
2005-01-06T09:55:00.000Z	ogra	shianux	it shouldnt delete the whole dir then ;)
2005-01-06T10:16:00.000Z	ogra	shianux	sounds like hoary
2005-01-06T10:16:00.000Z	shianux	ogra	so what's actually happening there?
