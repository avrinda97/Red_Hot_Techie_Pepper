2008-05-18T09:52:00.000Z	DemonicButthead		Using the GNOME interface, I have a program located in System, Administration, NVIDIA X Server Settings.. how would I find out the executable file name and path so I can run it in GKSU?
2008-05-18T09:52:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	press alt+f2, then type in gksudo nvidia-settings
2008-05-18T09:53:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	most of the time when i need to find a command for a menu item, i go to Preferences >> Main Menu, find the item, right click on it, and look at the properties

2008-05-18T09:55:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	Linux is complex like that lol
2008-05-18T09:56:00.000Z	DemonicButthead	arialth	There's the capability of being able to do just about anything you can do on a windows pc.. there's just a round about way to everything.  Gotta pay in time what you don't spend in cash.. but the experience has been invaluable
2008-05-18T09:57:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	indeed indeed
2008-05-18T09:59:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	oh gawd suspend. It worked when i first installed ubuntu 8.04 but now it crashes half of the time on resume! (After an update) and logs show naught for errors
2008-05-18T10:02:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	lol windows. At least it isnt Mac. But i dunno a whole lot of programming and i've been able to solve many of my problems on ubuntu. I almost crapped my pants when ndiswrapper WORKED on this version of ubuntu
2008-05-18T10:05:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	its the games, man, the games. They dun work on linux... well, game designers dont support linux, not the other way around. Games that run on both win32 and linux run better on linux (Nexuiz) but i dun think Steam will ever run on linux... i tried
2008-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	I am not sure having a second X display would help you. You wouldnt have controls for it (the 1st x server would take input i believe)
2008-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	what type of video card do you have?
2008-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	DemonicButthead	arialth	ok.. I'm running an EVGA e-GeForce 8800GT 512 DDR3
2008-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	DemonicButthead	arialth	PCIe bus
2008-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	is that an nvidia card?
2008-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	cuz the nvidia settings for X has config for multiple displays. Have you tried using that
2008-05-18T10:19:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	with 2 x servers you wouldnt be able to share windows between the 2 screens for a start
2008-05-18T10:21:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	now that's the linux spirit!
2008-05-18T10:24:00.000Z	arialth	DemonicButthead	Install linux on it; it will run twice as fast (http://loadingreadyrun.com/videos/view/201/Installation+Anxiety)
