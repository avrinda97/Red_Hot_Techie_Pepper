2008-10-16T02:15:00.000Z	lisa_		i installed ubuntu using crypt encryption.  If someone steals my PC, will they be able to access my Ubuntu?

2008-10-16T02:17:00.000Z	lisa_		anyone know?
2008-10-16T02:18:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	lisa_	rainbow tables? or a quantum computer
2008-10-16T02:19:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	define rainbow tables
2008-10-16T02:19:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	what application would a person need to try to crack the ubuntu crypt?
2008-10-16T02:20:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	lisa_	i dont think i am allowed to tell you
2008-10-16T02:20:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	PM me pls
2008-10-16T02:20:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	lisa_	lets just say, at this point AES crackers are custom
2008-10-16T02:22:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	u cant tell me can you :) u dont know :P
2008-10-16T02:22:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	if I gave you my ubuntu HDD that is encrypted. I doubt you would even know where to start in decrypting it :)
2008-10-16T02:23:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	lisa_	i dont think I would bother, but this article is relevant: http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1464351
2008-10-16T02:24:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	I have read 100's of articles claiming that AES can be cracked!  But none of the authors has video taped proof breaking someones encrypted drive lol
2008-10-16T02:24:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	its all talk, no action.
2008-10-16T02:25:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	lisa_	the weakness is the fact that you need to pick a password to unlock the drive yourself
2008-10-16T02:25:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	but notice the webpage says. however, there is no evidence the weakness is great enough cause panic yet.
2008-10-16T02:25:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	lisa_	with enough time I could randomly try every conceivable password
2008-10-16T02:25:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	see? ALL talk, no action or proof
2008-10-16T02:25:00.000Z	lisa_	angusthefuzz	how much time?  3 billion yrs? lol
