2011-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	nikolam		Anyone tried to make mdadm software raid on top of LVM-managed partitions on disks? I would like to have ability of file system snapshots in the future, before updating from LTS to newer releases...
2011-07-22T14:25:00.000Z	nikolam		Anyone installed and using Ubuntu on BTRFS?
2011-07-22T14:25:00.000Z	nikolam		btrfs
2011-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	nikolam	you using btrfs on a production system?
2011-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	No, I am using OpenSoalris/OpenIndiana/Soalris/ZFS on produvction system. Btrfs is not there yet.
2011-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	nikolam	oh good
2011-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	nikolam		I would just like to have file system snapshots when updating Ubuntu , with lvm, whatever
2011-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	do not want to reinstall ubuntu if something goes wrong for update. Only things I know is that Linux LVM have snapshots , there is mdadm for software RAID that I currently use and there os Btrfs still in Beta
2011-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	nikolam	i have no experience with lvm or raid, i just wanted to make sure you were aware btrfs isn't production ready (which you evidently do)
2011-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	I think there is one guy who installed Ubuntu from boot on ZFS, using still developing ZFS module for Linux. Only problem was file system permission being flat.
2011-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	nikolam		Meaning, he installed, then copied install on ZFS
2011-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	nikolam	i assume thats zfs on fuse?
2011-07-22T14:33:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	no. native Linux ZFS. Still under development but can be tested
2011-07-22T14:33:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	i think there is article from time to time about it on phoronix.com
2011-07-22T14:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	nikolam	i thought there were licsence inompatibilities that prevent you from using zfs nativly on linux (hence the development of btrfs)
2011-07-22T14:34:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	thing is that because of CDDL/GPL licensing differences, module could be compiled on site after install.
2011-07-22T14:35:00.000Z	nikolam		Yes, ThinkT510 but noone stops yopu compiling it yourself, or even automatically compile it after install.
2011-07-22T14:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	nikolam	while this is interesting we better stop, its getting off topic
2011-07-22T14:35:00.000Z	nikolam	ThinkT510	nope, I think it is on topic, I need FS snapshots for Ubunut upgrade. :P
