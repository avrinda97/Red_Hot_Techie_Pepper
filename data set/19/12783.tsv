2005-10-10T05:00:00.000Z	renedox		use VLC...
2005-10-10T05:01:00.000Z	renedox		what is this "smart upgrade" thing I need to do to update firefox?
2005-10-10T05:02:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	vlc has really has a not so nice a GUI
2005-10-10T05:02:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	but I do use it for h264 video (DigiLifeTv)
2005-10-10T05:02:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	I find VLC plays things a lot better than totem
2005-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	do you use totem-xine?
2005-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	where totem skips on things, VLC doesn't
2005-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	no, I use VLC
2005-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	nono do you the totem xine package installed?
2005-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	its a different backend to totem
2005-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	yes, I guess so
2005-10-10T05:04:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	did you explicitly install it
2005-10-10T05:04:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	no
2005-10-10T05:04:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	give it a shot
2005-10-10T05:04:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	hm.. ok, what do I actually need though?
2005-10-10T05:05:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	just totem-xine and totem
2005-10-10T05:05:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	ok, going to install them now :)
2005-10-10T05:05:00.000Z	locomorto	renedox	I think totem-xine does not depend on anything but totem
2005-10-10T05:06:00.000Z	renedox	locomorto	hm.. I get 404
