2011-04-27T04:58:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	What card is it?
2011-04-27T04:58:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	when i say lspci, it says: intel centrino wireless-n 1000
2011-04-27T04:59:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	What does iwconfig say?
2011-04-27T05:00:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	eth0 no wireless extensions
2011-04-27T05:00:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	You only have eth0  ?  No eth1 or no others?
2011-04-27T05:00:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	no
2011-04-27T05:01:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	So this is a laptop and does not have a regular ethernet device ?
2011-04-27T05:01:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	it does
2011-04-27T05:02:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	Then what else does iwconfig list?  eth1 or wlan0 or ...?  Any others...?
2011-04-27T05:03:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	eth0 and lo. nothing else
2011-04-27T05:04:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	hiexpo That is strange...   And this happened after distribution upgrade?  Is that it?  From what to what? ... 9.04 to 10.04 ?
2011-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	from 10.10 to 11.04
2011-04-27T05:06:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	ok...  well, he doesn't have any network interfaces working now. So, not sure what to make of that.
2011-04-27T05:06:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	What does lspci say about the ethernet device?
2011-04-27T05:07:00.000Z	kavurt	usr13	hiexpo: ok, thanks. i will reinstall the system.
2011-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	I hate to give up on it, but that might be easiest solution for you.... so, go for it.
2011-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	I agree with hiexpo's recommendation
2011-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	usr13	kavurt	That is not to say that 11.04 won't install just fine, without a hitch, but just to be on the safe side, if you want a reliable system for sure...
