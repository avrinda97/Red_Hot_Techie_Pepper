2012-01-25T03:36:00.000Z	blkperl		how do you set a static ipv6 address in /etc/network/interfaces?
2012-01-25T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	there's nothing in "man interfaces" =
2012-01-25T03:38:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	iface eth0 inet6 static doesn't seem to be working
2012-01-25T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	less /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz    might give you some ideas
2012-01-25T03:40:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	theres no ipv6 examples in that file :(
2012-01-25T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	oh.. it was much shorter than I expected..
2012-01-25T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	here's an example.. http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-ipv6-networking-configuration/
2012-01-25T03:52:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	the example didn't work :S
2012-01-25T03:53:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	have you checked the url to the ubuntu wiki? the one ubottu sent you
2012-01-25T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	I've never used ipv6 myself so I can't really help you other than point you towards existing howto's and such
2012-01-25T03:58:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	yeah the bot's link isn't that helpful either o.O
2012-01-25T03:58:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	if i add the ip addr manually it works, just cant get interfaces to cooperate
2012-01-25T03:59:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	bah.. one of these days I'll have to setup a virtual ipv6 network just to play with.. until then I'm sorry I can't be of more assistance.. try asking the channel again. Perhaps someone else knows more
2012-01-25T04:09:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	i used an up/down hack, which is working, but probably not the correct way
2012-01-25T04:10:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	hopefully they will expand the ipv6 wiki article as it gets more common
2012-01-25T04:30:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	works in oneiric, doesn't work in lucid
2012-01-25T04:31:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	that's odd.. I would have thought these things would look the same no matter what version
2012-01-25T04:31:00.000Z	blkperl	Slart	maybe lucid isn't ipv6 ready :P
2012-01-25T04:32:00.000Z	Slart	blkperl	hehe.. that would just be great.. LTS release and no ipv6 =)
