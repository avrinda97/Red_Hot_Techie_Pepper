2006-08-14T15:28:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	you about with any time for this: I did some upgrades a couple of weeks ago and sound did not work since then I have a soundblaster audigy 2 and it used to work ok, now in the place of the start up "music" I hear a distorted version of the tune very low in volume nothing looks muted in alsamixer
2006-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	pastebin your ``amixer''

2006-08-14T15:46:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	that seems odd for Audigy 2
2006-08-14T15:46:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	what's the output from ``asoundconf list''?
2006-08-14T15:47:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	CA0106
2006-08-14T15:47:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	CA0106
2006-08-14T15:48:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	sorry I am now debating with myself if the card type is correct
2006-08-14T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	if that's the output from asoundconf list, then it's correct.
2006-08-14T15:49:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	I'll certify the ca0106 - google is saying audigy SE
2006-08-14T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	does resetting the mixer levels help?
2006-08-14T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	invoke-rc.d alsa-utils reset
2006-08-14T15:51:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	no, still sounds like medium wave in the 60s with no channel :-)
2006-08-14T15:52:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	a what?
2006-08-14T15:52:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	a transistor radio in the 60's all hiss no music
2006-08-14T15:53:00.000Z	crimsun	jayt	amixer output
2006-08-14T15:56:00.000Z	jayt	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20594 is that output
