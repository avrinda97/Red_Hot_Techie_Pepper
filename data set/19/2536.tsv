2010-03-12T04:35:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	thanks mate, i was looking in system all the time
2010-03-21T23:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	cnage governor to performance
2010-03-21T23:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	change governor to performance
2010-03-21T23:25:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	did that too, keeps on scaling down
2010-05-15T19:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	why are you compiling it ?
2010-05-15T19:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	sudo aptitude install kid3
2010-05-15T19:59:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	i use qt. it just doesn't work with mp3 files by default
2010-05-15T20:00:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	i could, but kid3 should work as well...i installed lame and it still won't open mp3 files
2010-05-15T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	id3tags usually use a different lib
2010-05-15T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	like this libid3tag0
2010-05-15T20:01:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	i have that one...
2010-05-15T20:02:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	i'm thinking, maybe the files i'm trying to edit are broken..i tried some other mp3s and it worked fine so probably something went wrong while encoding
2010-05-15T20:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	that was an example, kid3 may use another. the configure script should tell you what is missing if you insist on compiling it
2010-05-15T20:03:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	it looks like i was thinking too complicated from the beginning
2010-05-15T20:03:00.000Z	al-tabq	erUSUL	thanks anyway
2010-05-15T20:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	sudo aptitude install kid3
2010-05-15T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	al-tabq	done
