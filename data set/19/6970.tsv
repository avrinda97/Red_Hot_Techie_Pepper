2007-12-30T03:48:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	you arent in the correct directory
2007-12-30T03:48:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	type "cd desktop"
2007-12-30T03:51:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	open up a terminal
2007-12-30T03:52:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	little hint. You could have just typed "bash" and then drug the file you had on the desktop into the terminal
2007-12-30T03:54:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	its under applications > accessories
2007-12-30T03:54:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	why do you want to manually install your card instead of using the auto installer?
2007-12-30T04:05:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	you can drag and drop the file in your terminal
2007-12-30T04:05:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	you can type whatever commands you want to run on it, then just drop the file in there
2007-12-30T04:07:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	that just means that you dont have fglrx previously on there
2007-12-30T04:07:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	you're good
2007-12-30T04:18:00.000Z	ChrisULM	Task1	gimme a second
