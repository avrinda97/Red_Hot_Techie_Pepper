2007-08-18T11:57:00.000Z	olyuser		Ok, so I had Feisty 64 bit on sda1, I installed Sabayon on hda1 and it's grub didn't recognize ubuntu, so I cannot access my partition
2007-08-18T11:57:00.000Z	olyuser		I am on a live ubuntu64 feisty cd,
2007-08-18T11:57:00.000Z	olyuser		chrooted into my partition
2007-08-18T11:57:00.000Z	olyuser		and I can't seem to run grub-install
2007-08-18T11:57:00.000Z	olyuser		it keeps saying cant find device /dev/sda1
2007-08-18T11:58:00.000Z	olyuser		it says /dev/sda1: Not found or not a block device.
2007-08-18T11:58:00.000Z	olyuser		it says /dev/sda1: Not found or not a block device
2007-08-18T11:58:00.000Z	olyuser		when I boot from Sabayon grub, or when I chroot in from ubuntu live disk and try to run grub-install
2007-08-18T12:00:00.000Z	velko	olyuser	do you see sda1 in the list produced by "sudo sfdisk -l" (after chrooting into your ubuntu install)?
2007-08-18T12:02:00.000Z	olyuser	velko	it says cannot open /proc/partitions
2007-08-18T12:15:00.000Z	velko	olyuser	do you see the file /etc/debian_version on the partition supposedly containing ubuntu?
2007-08-18T12:16:00.000Z	olyuser	velko	4.0
2007-08-18T12:16:00.000Z	olyuser	velko	I posted my /boot/grub/menu.lst from the partition on pastebin
2007-08-18T12:17:00.000Z	velko	olyuser	so it it is indeed ubuntu. is also supposed that sabayon overwritten the partition
2007-08-18T12:17:00.000Z	olyuser	velko	no, sabayon is on a different partition, I can tell by the contents of the home directory on the partition
2007-08-18T12:17:00.000Z	velko	olyuser	menu.lst does not do any good if you don't have the /proc file system. something is really rotten but i don't know waht
2007-08-18T12:18:00.000Z	olyuser	velko	is there a way to chroot differently so I will have a /proc?
2007-08-18T12:19:00.000Z	velko	olyuser	yes - you can use your current /proc fs. but i don't remember the command. i'll try to find a pointer for you
2007-08-18T12:21:00.000Z	velko	olyuser	look at this: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/426
