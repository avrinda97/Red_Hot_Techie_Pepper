2010-09-29T21:27:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 won't that depend on the codecs installed?
2010-09-29T21:28:00.000Z	magicianlord	bobstro	vlc comes with its own internal codecs and does not require separate ones
2010-09-29T22:00:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 i find evince viewer works just fine.
2010-09-29T22:09:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 well, it can be changed.
2010-09-29T22:09:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 every mac address should be unique, so it can be part of forensics.
2010-09-29T22:10:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 probably not. they stay local to subnet.
2010-09-29T22:10:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 not to say something *couldn't* transmit it, but normal ip won't send it.
2010-09-29T22:11:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 they are probably local... the router connecting you to the internet is suspect.
2010-09-29T22:11:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 well... it's sent with every packet on the local subnet, so not really a violation.
2010-09-29T22:12:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 ip allows them to, but that doesn't mean they do it. so ... maybe.
2010-09-29T22:12:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 if they are at all clueful, they will have terms of service that you agree to that spell this all out.
2010-09-29T22:12:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 you agree to the ToS, they are off the hook.
2010-09-29T22:14:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 how do you know they are actually capturing that info?
2010-09-29T22:15:00.000Z	magicianlord	bobstro	they cant be potentially. thats the point
2010-09-29T22:16:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 they could, sure. you can also be observed walking on the street. i don't consider that a violation of privacy unless it's actually done though. there are tools for privacy if it really concerns you.
2010-09-29T22:16:00.000Z	magicianlord	bobstro	it's easier on the internet
2010-09-29T22:16:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 what is easier?
2010-09-29T22:17:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 vmware and i assume other virtualization software creates macs for each vm, so there's nothing magical about it.
2010-09-29T22:19:00.000Z	bobstro	magicianlord	 this may help - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=316126
