2011-03-22T12:03:00.000Z	eltigre		hey, I have a problem with two computers connected via ethernet... I'd like to access the webserver on a port 8000 on one computer from the other one
2011-03-22T12:03:00.000Z	eltigre		how can I do that?
2011-03-22T12:04:00.000Z	eltigre		ah sorry forgot to say that won't work
2011-03-22T12:05:00.000Z	eltigre		as I said it doesn't work
2011-03-22T12:05:00.000Z	eltigre		the server is running on the same port. On the same computer I can access the site
2011-03-22T12:07:00.000Z	eltigre		how can I open the 8000 for other computer to reach it?
2011-03-22T12:09:00.000Z	ac7ss	eltigre	do you have apache running?
2011-03-22T12:17:00.000Z	ac7ss		rpyervenche: rename "s/.*\.jpg/.gif/" *.jpg
2011-03-22T12:19:00.000Z	eltigre		I am still having trouble to access a webserver over a local network
2011-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	eltigre		I now how to address it, the other computer just refuses the connection
2011-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	eltigre		yes, connection is fine
2011-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	eltigre		yes
2011-03-22T12:21:00.000Z	eltigre		yes
2011-03-22T12:21:00.000Z	eltigre	ActionParsnip	now, it's a django development server
2011-03-22T12:22:00.000Z	eltigre		and there are usually no restrictions. Other projects don't work either
2011-03-22T12:23:00.000Z	eltigre		that might be, and that's why I am asking how to find out
2011-03-22T12:23:00.000Z	eltigre		I don't remember setting up a firewall
2011-03-22T12:24:00.000Z	eltigre		no, there is just the refused connection
2011-03-22T12:24:00.000Z	ac7ss	eltigre	is anything showing in the apache logs when you try to connect?
