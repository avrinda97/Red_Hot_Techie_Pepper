2009-07-13T16:17:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	shopping smarter means working harder making linux like it.
2009-07-13T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	just use onboard sound, nvidia gfx and atheros 5000X wifi, job done
2009-07-13T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	true its not ideal, but some companys support for linux is better so I support them. If more linux users did then the other compaies would start supporting it to get the revenue back
2009-07-13T16:21:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	=) You show me a $15 dollar 775 mobo, I'll show you $15 and figure it out later. =(.
2009-07-13T16:22:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	the bottom line of the reverse pin chips
2009-07-13T16:22:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	*for intel
2009-07-13T16:24:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	not to mention, I got about 20 pcs for $150, and making crappy old hardware work is the new hobby
2009-07-13T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	been doing that LOONG time. All my home PCs are circa 1992
2009-07-13T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	ASRock G31M-S looks ok
2009-07-13T16:33:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	yeah, but that's 1) new and 2) not dirt frikken cheap
2009-07-13T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	abit aa8 maybe?
2009-07-13T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	why not buy amd stuff, its cheaper
2009-07-13T16:41:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	I found some p4's for $10 apiece and mobo
2009-07-13T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	nice
2009-07-13T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	free from schools chucking old stuff out ;)
2009-07-13T16:42:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	=) I just got two towers free from a guy I work with... total reminder that it would be disrespect not to at least inspect the hardware
2009-07-13T16:47:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ActionParsnip	speaking of free hardware, I just soldered a paperclip onto an hdd to replace the broken pin (I broke it, but I'm not the one who bent it 90 degrees in the 1st place)
2009-07-13T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	i'd just chuck it, get new, restore from backup
2009-07-13T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qe2eqe	could try some altgr+<code> fun
