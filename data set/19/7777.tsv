2007-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	why shouldn't he just start setting it up?
2007-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	saxartist		You have to change some xorg.conf stuff
2007-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	saxartist		I've done it many a time
2007-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	oh, well, yeah
2007-07-04T09:00:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	I dunno, my Nvidia worked (sort of) right off the bat; the data i got back from plugging it in helped me figure out what to change in xorg

2007-07-04T09:01:00.000Z	saxartist		perfect guide
2007-07-04T09:01:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	that's all I really meant; but he's got ATI so I can't really speak for that
2007-07-04T09:01:00.000Z	saxartist		oh, he'll have to use that ATI thing then
2007-07-04T09:01:00.000Z	M_		safxartist: either way should work, I"m just a fan of experimenting a while
2007-07-04T09:02:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	have you ever set up, say, Berl on an ATI?
2007-07-04T09:02:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	it looks like a pain
2007-07-04T09:02:00.000Z	saxartist	M_	I have not
2007-07-04T09:02:00.000Z	saxartist		I only have Nvidia
2007-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	saxartist		much better for linux and blender
2007-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	damn
2007-07-04T09:03:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	yeah, I agree; I got a laptop for reeeally cheap, but the tradeoff was having vista pre-installed (gag) and an ATI card
2007-07-04T09:04:00.000Z	saxartist	M_	at least it was cheap!
2007-07-04T09:04:00.000Z	M_	saxartist	lol, yeah, that's the only upside
