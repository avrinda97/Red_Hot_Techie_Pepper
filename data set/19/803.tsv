2012-06-20T18:02:00.000Z	Joshun	kms11	- you could also try resetting your user config - rm -rf ~/.gconf  ~/.gnome2
2012-06-20T18:02:00.000Z	Joshun		beware though you may lose settings

2012-06-20T18:02:00.000Z	Joshun		you cannot remove directories with rm without using -rf

2012-06-20T18:07:00.000Z	Joshun	kms11	- is it ok now? if you reset your config, you will have to change your wallpaper etc. back again. don't worry though - it won't touch the actual images files.
2012-06-20T18:12:00.000Z	kms11	Joshun	it's not ok at all. there are alot of things that missed now in my ubuntu
2012-06-20T18:14:00.000Z	Joshun	kms11	- does the file manager open ok - i did warn you only to reset your config if you really needed to, after you had tested the first solution
2012-06-20T18:16:00.000Z	kms11	Joshun	unfortunately i reset it, but i confused  what did before that it get crazy now:( .
2012-06-20T18:24:00.000Z	Joshun	kms11	- what exactly do you mean? settings may be lost, but has anything else hapened?
