2010-08-24T02:04:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	just to test the FN-key: install xev, start it (from cli), move your mouse pointer into the window and then press/release the FN key, what events do you get?
2010-08-24T02:05:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	I've tested the FN key though. If I press FN and then a function key, it performs its "normal" task, such as F5 in Firefox to refresh.
2010-08-24T02:06:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	yes, but press and release generates two different events, you will see those with xev
2010-08-24T02:06:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		Ok. Give me a sec, I'll try it. guntbert
2010-08-24T02:10:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	I'm running the app, it just shows a white window, and when I mouse over the window events are logged in the terminal.
2010-08-24T02:10:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		How am I supposed to test the FN event?
2010-08-24T02:10:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	yes, now leave the mouse alone and press the FN key
2010-08-24T02:11:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	Would you like to see the output event?

2010-08-24T02:13:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	GAh, my mistake. I was pressing Super. :(
2010-08-24T02:14:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	try again
2010-08-24T02:14:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		xev doesn't report an X event when I press the FN key
2010-08-24T02:16:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	then something is really wrong, here it reports eycode 151 (in the 3rd line of a block)
2010-08-24T02:16:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	It gives nothing for the FN key. It also gives nothing for F6, which turns on the keyboard backlight. But if I press FN+F6 (which is the "normal" F6), it throws an event.
2010-08-24T02:16:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	That one there was me pressing the Super key
2010-08-24T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	yeah 133 -- I'm not good with key problems, but at least you got a starting point for further research :-)
2010-08-24T02:18:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	Alright, thanks.
2010-08-24T02:18:00.000Z	guntbert	LorgonJortle	Good luck :-) (and good night, its past bedtime here)
2010-08-24T02:18:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	guntbert	G'night. :P
