2009-01-06T04:28:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		hi
2009-01-06T04:28:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		where does ubuntu get the weather information from?
2009-01-06T04:29:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		it's fine for most places but for Berlin Germany it's totally wrong, always
2009-01-06T04:29:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	doesn't it say somewhere in the preferences for the weather thingy?
2009-01-06T04:30:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	Slart	dunno. i just found the option to show weather, togetzher with the time and date, but not, where the info comes from. For madrid it's accurate, but for Berlin it shows 4°C whereas it's actually -11°C
2009-01-06T04:30:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		and not only today
2009-01-06T04:31:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	hmm.. I searched the preferences box and there's no urls or anything.. perhaps some wiretapping might tell us what url it goes to
2009-01-06T04:32:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	Slart	dunno about that, am pretty nooob. Just wanted to report to you guys that it works fine for other destinations that i treid, but that fpr Berlin it's been way too high for days now. Maybe someone relies on it...
2009-01-06T04:33:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	I doubt NASA is using the weather applet to time their launches.. =) I'll see if I can find where it comes from though..
2009-01-06T04:44:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	seems it's using http://weather.noaa.gov
2009-01-06T04:44:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	I just thought of something else.. are the coordinates for Berlin correct?
2009-01-06T04:46:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	there are more than one Berlin in the lists.. one shows 4C and one -11C..
2009-01-06T04:46:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	Slart	coordinates are correct. I changed for another Berlin weather station and it works. Seems it's a prob with that specific station
2009-01-06T04:46:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	Slart	yes.
2009-01-06T04:47:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	Slart	I had chosen Airport Tempelhof as it's closest to my home, and that one was the malfuntioning one. have changed to Tegel now, so i have correct values. Thanks
2009-01-06T04:47:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	yes, those were the ones I checked on the website.. you're welcome
2009-01-06T04:47:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		:-)
2009-01-06T04:48:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	Slart	I'll call the templehof weather stattion maybe they can change that
2009-01-06T04:49:00.000Z	Slart	AndreasMadrid	good idea
