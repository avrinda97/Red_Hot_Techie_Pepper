2008-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	Hammer89		hey... for some reason I can't get Gnome to work... it was working fine till I changed my emerald theme
2008-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	more specific please--dont work doesnt do it
2008-02-05T08:13:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	I changed my metacity theme... and my emerald theme... then pressed alt-cntrl-backspace... logged back in... but all I'd get was a black screen with an X as a cursor
2008-03-13T21:23:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	lol... thanks **why didn't I think of that** :P
2008-03-17T21:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	24th or so
2008-04-06T20:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	any odd repos in there?
2008-04-06T20:36:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	I can't check... nothing will load... oddly AWN and Pidgin both started properly (they're set to start when I log in)
2008-04-06T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	this is ubuntu or ubuntu-based? and what other repos do you have in there
2008-04-06T20:37:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	I'm using Ubuntu... I don;'t think I have any unusual repos...
2008-04-06T20:40:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	I can run firefox still... nautilus and terminal don't work though... odd
2008-04-30T20:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	you may not get an answer in less than two minutes ;]
2008-04-30T20:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	we never leave--will be waiting for your return ;]
2008-04-30T20:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	is it glxgears?
2008-04-30T20:29:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	no...
2008-04-30T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	compiz can give you a better answer most likely
2008-04-30T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	ah that lspci
2008-04-30T20:30:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	I tried that... but I'm pretty sure it was a different command...
2008-04-30T20:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Hammer89	sorry vga not network
2008-04-30T20:32:00.000Z	Hammer89	bazhang	it's giving me a command not found error
