2009-11-10T23:37:00.000Z	ReL1K		ruh roh!
2009-11-10T23:38:00.000Z	ReL1K		legit question and bug, would like to see if its reproducible in different hardware platforms as i have recompiled my kernel 7 different times, instead of being helpful iceroot you are belligerent
2009-11-10T23:39:00.000Z	ReL1K		the rest came after iceroot became a tool
2009-11-10T23:39:00.000Z	ReL1K		i came in here yesterday for the first time in probably a year
2009-11-10T23:40:00.000Z	ReL1K		ive asked two questions, one regarding alsa, other regarding 230M
2009-11-10T23:40:00.000Z	ReL1K		im cool, sorry to sound stand-off-ish, just curious if anyone has run into the same issue no big deal
2009-11-10T23:41:00.000Z	mahngiel	ReL1K	i only had minimal VGA probs until i installed the prop. drivers. #173 tbh
2009-11-10T23:36:00.000Z	mahngiel	ReL1K	sorry mate, i'm running gofx5600
2009-11-10T23:38:00.000Z	mahngiel	ReL1K	yes but you keep asking about your VGA card, which nobody else has
2009-11-10T23:38:00.000Z	ReL1K	mahngiel	i asked twice within a 2 hour period
2009-11-10T23:39:00.000Z	mahngiel	ReL1K	this is a helpful forum of people trying to help each other. we are TRYING to help you, but you will not allow us to. work with us mate
2009-11-10T23:43:00.000Z	ReL1K	mahngiel	im not exactly sure what the issue is, on 230M on 9.10 both 32 and 64 bit, nvidia drivers work out of the box fine, even compiled from source, looks crisp, everything works, when hibernate or restarting gdm or dropping to console, becomes super distorted and flaky, recompiled kernel to force vesafb thinking it was a framebuffer issue, thought it mighta been a grub2 one also, but...
2009-11-10T23:44:00.000Z	mahngiel	ReL1K	karmic is having suspend issues
2009-11-10T23:45:00.000Z	ReL1K	mahngiel	not specific to hibernate, has to do with framebuffer is what im guessing
2009-11-10T23:46:00.000Z	mahngiel	ReL1K	i really don't know mate
