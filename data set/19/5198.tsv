2008-12-03T09:15:00.000Z	mcarter		I'm trying to figure out how to configure my video card in ubuntu 8.10 -- the only video related config screen i can find is 'screen resolution'
2008-12-03T09:15:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	what kind of card?
2008-12-03T09:16:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	 "Out of the box, the graphic card Intel GMA 950, is well detected, ..."
2008-12-03T09:17:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	is the resolution out of wack?
2008-12-03T09:17:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	res is fine -- redrawing is *slow* -- how it tends to be whenever my graphics card drivers aren't installed
2008-12-03T09:18:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	just seeing chat here in xchat has slow repainting sometimes
2008-12-03T09:19:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	sometimes the cards are not detected or configured correctly.  in a terminal try gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and in the file that opens, in the first paragraph or so, mentions how to reconfigure X .. it will re-detect the card and hopefully configur the correct driver.
2008-12-03T09:21:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	is that dexconf?
2008-12-03T09:22:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	no.. hang on and I'll find it.
2008-12-03T09:22:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	it also mentions: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-12-03T09:23:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	so that isn't interactive, and the xorg.conf it gives me is very short and generic -- not mentioning my graphics card anywhere
2008-12-03T09:24:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	typicall for hardy & ibex.. if you eliminate the -phigh it will be more interactive
2008-12-03T09:27:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	that seems to ask me almost entirely keyboard questions
2008-12-03T09:27:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	though it ultimately results in the same simple configuration: http://pastebin.ca/1274589
2008-12-03T09:28:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	xrandr is the system that currently controls video.  I'm not really sure where to go from here. Maybe someone else will be able to take up the task... sorry.. I'm stuck
2008-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	thanks for your help, i appreciate it
2008-12-03T09:30:00.000Z	scunizi	mcarter	wish I could have done more.. it's easier editing xorg when it applies.. but ubuntu is trying to make it bullit proof.. ie idiot proof
2008-12-03T09:31:00.000Z	mcarter	scunizi	yeah -- I wish they kept that previous video configuration tool they had; its better to have *some* control than none
