2012-04-03T03:43:00.000Z	DarkAngel		I got it from a friend of mine and it had windows XP on it. I can't remember if it made noise then or not
2012-04-03T03:44:00.000Z	DarkAngel		Yes it does
2012-04-03T03:45:00.000Z	DarkAngel		No it does not play any sounds at all
2012-04-03T03:47:00.000Z	DarkAngel		I don't see any keyboard keys that make the sound go up and down.. the icon is there but nothing is coming out of the speakers
2012-04-03T03:48:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	have you tried the alsa mixer?
2012-04-03T03:49:00.000Z	DarkAngel	digitalslave	I like your name.. I tried the alsa mixer and set everything that was mute to on and moved the volume up
2012-04-03T03:50:00.000Z	DarkAngel		Still got no sound. I did get a little lost when they were talking about loading drivers.
2012-04-03T03:50:00.000Z	DarkAngel		I did but still nothing unless I did something wrong
2012-04-03T03:50:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	do you know what sound chipset/card you have?
2012-04-03T03:52:00.000Z	DarkAngel		Intel ICH6 Family AC'97
2012-04-03T03:53:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	did this recently stop working or never worked?
2012-04-03T03:54:00.000Z	DarkAngel		I got the laptop from a friend and he claims it worked but I am starting to think it didn't work at all He had windows xp loaded on it and I put ubuntu on it right away
2012-04-03T03:55:00.000Z	DarkAngel	digitalslave	it shows the card but I can't get any sound at all
2012-04-03T03:55:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	some good info here http://askubuntu.com/questions/87515/no-sound-after-upgrade-to-11-10
2012-04-03T03:56:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	that chipset should work. i had some issues with mine doing surround sound after the last update but it works now
2012-04-03T03:58:00.000Z	DarkAngel	digitalslave	do you think it is a bad sound card?
2012-04-03T03:59:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	cant say for sure. you could boot with a live disk and see if it works there as well
2012-04-03T04:00:00.000Z	DarkAngel		It didn't work when I had the live disk I thought it was just me so I loaded it anyway
2012-04-03T04:00:00.000Z	digitalslave	DarkAngel	just run through some of the steps on that link. make sure its get the right output like digital or analog and the sort
