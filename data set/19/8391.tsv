2007-05-17T13:21:00.000Z	ny00123		I think that Samba is installed Pelo
2007-05-17T13:21:00.000Z	ny00123		btw, I'm using Ubuntu Feisty for 64-bit processors.
2007-05-17T13:21:00.000Z	ny00123		samba-common is installed but not combo :o
2007-05-17T13:21:00.000Z	ny00123		oops, not samba
2007-05-17T13:23:00.000Z	ny00123		oh yeah (Pelo) here's a similar case:

2007-05-17T13:23:00.000Z	ny00123		let's read :D
2007-05-17T13:25:00.000Z	ny00123		Huh? It seems like I should disable "bi-directional support" for the printer in order to be able to use it over the network
2007-05-17T13:25:00.000Z	ny00123		Does that mean it can't be used as a scanner? Or that it can't print right-to-left text probably?
2007-05-17T13:25:00.000Z	ny00123		hi
2007-05-17T13:25:00.000Z	BigToe	ny00123	it probably means that the printer can't talk to the PC
2007-05-17T13:26:00.000Z	BigToe	ny00123	but the PC can talk to the printer
2007-05-17T13:26:00.000Z	ny00123	BigToe	it seems like disabling that "BiDi" works
2007-05-17T13:26:00.000Z	ny00123		and it's possible to scan and print from the XP machine
2007-05-17T13:26:00.000Z	BigToe		like the printer can't warn of low ink or something if it usually does
2007-05-17T13:26:00.000Z	BigToe		hmm
2007-05-17T13:26:00.000Z	ny00123		USB btw
2007-05-17T13:27:00.000Z	ny00123		What's printer's bidirectional support btw? right-to-left text (e.g. Hebrew) or printer+scanner?
2007-05-17T13:27:00.000Z	BigToe	ny00123	the second (I guess)
