2011-12-28T18:38:00.000Z	Boreeas		I can't figure out how to install the sun jdk1.6. I apt-get it, but it isn't saved where it should be (/lib/jvm or /usr/lib/jvm)
2011-12-28T18:38:00.000Z	Boreeas		Any help?
2011-12-28T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	you will need to manually install java now
2011-12-28T18:39:00.000Z	Boreeas	ActionParsnip	what's the packet in the apt repo then?
2011-12-28T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	Oracle changed the license
2011-12-28T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	its not hard to install manually
2011-12-28T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	bin files are executables, what did you download?
2011-12-28T18:52:00.000Z	Boreeas	ActionParsnip	The sun jdk 6u30 installer, but it kept trying to open in notepad, therefore my confusion
2011-12-28T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	mark it as executable and run it in terminal, I suggest you move it to /opt first
2011-12-28T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	or even better, copy it to /usr/lib/jvm
2011-12-28T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	I made a script for it: http://paste.ubuntu.com/785704/
2011-12-28T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	;)
2011-12-28T18:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	32bit of course
2011-12-28T18:57:00.000Z	Boreeas	ActionParsnip	Thanks, I think I've already done it. Let me just check if it worked real quick
2011-12-28T19:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	llutz: should be ok: http://paste.ubuntu.com/785712/
2012-01-15T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	when the black screen shows, press ESC and you can watch the boot
2012-08-02T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Boreeas	use the boot option:  ipv6.disable=1
2012-08-02T03:24:00.000Z	Boreeas	ActionParsnip	Thanks
