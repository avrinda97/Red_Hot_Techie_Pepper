2009-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	hmw		totem says "Your GStreamer installation is missing a plug-in". I already installed w32codecs and libdvdcss2, whats wrong?
2009-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	w32 and libdvdcss aren't gstreamer
2009-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	so how do i install a general dvd codec? and why did it work on the other machine? i am confused
2009-05-02T23:16:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	he's mounting ext
2009-05-02T23:16:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	then an error is a bad sign, isnt it?
2009-05-02T23:16:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	which is why i am asking him what the error is
2009-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	lotharn btw. CTRL-0 (zero) does nothing on my nano

2009-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	fsck is filesystem check, not hard drive check
2009-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	i thought, it had some "active" option, how would you do a surface check?
2009-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	use the manufacturer's tools
2009-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	not funny. a hard drive comes without a setup cd usually *g* there is a native linux tool for that.
2009-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	there probably is, and it is recommended to use the manufacturer's tools for the job
2009-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	the manufacturer's provide their own tools for a reason
2009-05-03T00:38:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	i was right, fsck (or e2fsck)
2009-05-03T00:39:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	i would happily use manufacturers tools, but i am too lazy to hunt for the downloads
2009-05-03T00:41:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	too lazy to google for "seagate tools download" (for example) instead of "bad block test linux" (example)?  Strnage
2009-05-03T00:42:00.000Z	hmw	fryguy	well... i dont like to use google at all very much. Do you know, if there are tools for linux? or are they DOS disks/windows progs?
2009-05-03T00:42:00.000Z	fryguy	hmw	all of the tools I use are boot from CD tools, since the manufacturer makes the asusmption that it's the only drive you have
