2006-09-24T12:48:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	i don't think that would be a bug ... more like a request ? btw what kind of software you looking for ?
2006-09-24T12:48:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	yes, it's a request. Definitely
2006-09-24T12:49:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	why not you write one ? thats how linux started ....
2006-09-24T12:50:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	yes, I guess I can write one in this case, if it's simple enough. But in general, it may be hard, and there may be others who can, and who are looking for something to do... there should be a way of contacting them
2006-09-24T12:50:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	perhaps its already been done ? may we know what kind of prog you are looking for ?
2006-09-24T12:51:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	that's besides the point. I'm just making a general observation that there should be ways of doing this thing.
2006-09-24T12:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	how do i put it ? yes it can be ... but people in OSS write codes because they are itchy ... frankly i thats how i see it ...
2006-09-24T12:53:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	yes, but sometimes one can be itchy, and only others can scratch the itch :)
2006-09-24T12:54:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	true .. if there is a demand ...
2006-09-24T12:55:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	exactly. What I'm asking is: how does one demand?
2006-09-24T12:56:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	slashdot is very good place ... and here too ... you can also demand by downloading the windows counterpart program many times ... if someone sees it then surely they will do the OSS version
2006-09-24T12:57:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	that's very presumptuous; Windows very likely has no equivalent at all :p
2006-09-24T12:57:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	then how can i put it .... it doesn't exist ?
2006-09-24T13:01:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	you can help existing projects ?
2006-09-24T13:04:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	true, there are a lot of ways I can help, but do you agree that having a "Requested functionality" source *would help* (1) users who want things done and can't write it themselves and (2) programmers looking for ideas?
2006-09-24T13:04:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	All I'm saying is that such a thing would help
2006-09-24T13:04:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	i know what you can do right now ... how about a wish list ?
2006-09-24T13:44:00.000Z	hastesaver	wickedpuppy	which are the "good" graphics cards, BTW?
2006-09-24T13:46:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	hastesaver	nvidia
