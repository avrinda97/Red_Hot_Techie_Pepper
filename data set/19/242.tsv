2012-08-27T20:40:00.000Z	damms005		Brasero is saying my unformatted BLANK DVD disc is 1.3G???
2012-08-27T20:41:00.000Z	damms005		Pls help me on how to determine the size of my blank (NEW) DVD
2012-08-27T20:42:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	damms005	 how "old" is that DVD disk?
2012-08-27T20:42:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		in terms of age of purchase
2012-08-27T20:42:00.000Z	damms005	TheLordOfTime	1 day old. I just bought it

2012-08-27T20:43:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	damms005	 if it says 1.3GB, then that's what space you have to work with, i assume the rest of the disk is taken up with other junk related to DVD video, burned by Brasero
2012-08-27T20:43:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		its a tad different than dealing with a data disk...
2012-08-27T20:45:00.000Z	damms005	TheLordOfTime	i am sorry please. just curious. Nautilus (windows manager) mounted it as "blank DVD". when I mouseover, it shows blank:///. is there a way to access this "mount point"?
2012-08-27T20:46:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	damms005	 not if there's no data
2012-08-27T20:46:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	damms005	 if there's no data there is no mount point, generally, its just waiting to be burned.
2012-08-27T20:46:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		but i'm not an expert, and i have to disappear for my classes
2012-08-27T20:46:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime		but DVDs are supposed to have around 4.7GB, give or take, but if its single layer that may explain the smaller size.
2012-08-27T20:47:00.000Z	damms005	TheLordOfTime	Please is there a linux "broghtness manager"?  (for example, reduce the brightness automatically when on battery and then on DC power)
