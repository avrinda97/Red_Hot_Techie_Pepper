2006-12-28T08:20:00.000Z	kd7swh	alex-weej	vlc, and mplayer play to ogm fine and I have a newly compiled ffmpeg with extra codec support
2006-12-28T08:21:00.000Z	kd7swh	alex-weej	the* ogm
2006-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	kd7swh	alex-weej	the ogm is in theroa-vorbis format and I want ffmpeg to convert it to a xvid-lame
2006-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	alex-weej	kd7swh	does it play with gstreamer apps (e.g. totem)?
2006-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	kd7swh	alex-weej	yes totem worked too
2006-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	alex-weej	kd7swh	in that case, try this
2006-12-28T08:24:00.000Z	alex-weej	kd7swh	actually sorry
2006-12-28T08:24:00.000Z	alex-weej	kd7swh	if you can find a gstreamer transcoding tool that will work
2006-12-28T08:24:00.000Z	kd7swh	alex-weej	do you know the name of one?
2006-12-28T08:25:00.000Z	alex-weej	kd7swh	afraid not. if you ask on #gstreamer someone might be able to help you
