2007-01-11T10:16:00.000Z	riotkittie	DesertEagle	mine are there because of fstab. im not sure how to get them there manually. i suppose you could right click > create launcher
2007-01-11T10:17:00.000Z	DesertEagle	riotkittie	thank you for caring :D
2007-01-11T10:23:00.000Z	riotkittie	DesertEagle	i've been fooling around in gnome, and i'm still clueless. maybe a bash script...  hm.
2007-01-11T10:23:00.000Z	DesertEagle	riotkittie	no yeah, your way works, but i want the pretty icon :D
2007-01-11T10:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	DesertEagle	oh, a custom icon?
2007-01-11T10:24:00.000Z	DesertEagle	riotkittie	yeah you know the white drive icons on your desktop? i lost one of those when i reformatted a drive
2007-01-11T10:24:00.000Z	DesertEagle	riotkittie	i mounted the drive, but it didn't show the nice desktop icon
2007-01-11T10:26:00.000Z	riotkittie	DesertEagle	ahhh. i've run into a similar problem in the past but dont know how i undid it
2007-01-11T10:26:00.000Z	riotkittie	DesertEagle	have you tried switching to a different icon theme and then switching back?
