2006-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	pixelPOET		question...when i'm in fluxbox my mp3 player is no longer automatically mounted in /media...is there a way to fix this?
2006-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	as in make it automatically mount?
2006-10-25T10:26:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	yes.
2006-10-25T10:28:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	I do not think so, but you can mount it. I could be wrong though.
2006-10-25T10:29:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	in dmesg in notes that it pics up sda1...but any mount command for sda1 fails...
2006-10-25T10:29:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	in what way does it fail?
2006-10-25T10:30:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	its not listed in fstab or mtab...i put it in fstab...but it still failed with the same error.
2006-10-25T10:31:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	that means you did not give proper syntax for mount, it seems to me. what was the command you used?
2006-10-25T10:37:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/mp3
2006-10-25T10:38:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	that sounds reasonable actually.
2006-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	it's always worked before...how would fluxbox have any control over the "under-the-hood" workings of the distro? i was under the impression that it was merely a WM...
2006-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	ya, what about gnome-volume-manager, try running that
2006-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	thank you! that did the trick nicely! that explains the fluxbox question...lol. Would you happen to know if there is a non gnome-specific equivalent that i could run instead?
2006-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	no idea really, that was a long shot...
2006-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	well...you're a good guesser. i'll run over to #fluxbox and ask them
2006-10-25T10:43:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	thanks
2006-10-25T10:57:00.000Z	dabaR	pixelPOET	don't use concepts like that here, please.
2006-10-25T10:58:00.000Z	pixelPOET	dabaR	haha iight.
