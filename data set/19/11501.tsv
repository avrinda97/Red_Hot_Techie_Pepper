2006-08-09T13:10:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	because that patch is _huge_ -- very intrusive -- and doesn't apply cleanly with the thousands of patches we have
2006-08-09T13:10:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	but that is something crucial for audio
2006-08-09T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	you can still compile your own from kernel.org, then, as ubuntustudio.com suggests
2006-08-09T13:12:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	that's what I just did but alsa-driver will freeze my machine if I try to compile it
2006-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	...just attempting to compile it?
2006-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	well it freezes half way
2006-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	can you be more specific?
2006-08-09T13:15:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	./configure works, make freezes my machine
2006-08-09T13:17:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	then you'll need to compile in a non-RT kernel against the RT headers
2006-08-09T13:17:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	anyhow, I was asking for more software specifics, as in which version of which RT patch against which source, etc.
2006-08-09T13:18:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	latest (2.6.17) rt8
2006-08-09T13:18:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	have you reported it upstream, then?
2006-08-09T13:19:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	I'm not shure what is the problem, dunno what to report
2006-08-09T13:19:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	you just told me what the problem is :)
2006-08-09T13:20:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	yeah but it could be something wrong with my laptop
2006-08-09T13:20:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	now what _I_ would do before posting to lkml is to ensure that I _can_ compile alsa-driver modules while running a non-RT kernel
2006-08-09T13:21:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	I can with ubuntu kernel
2006-08-09T13:21:00.000Z	crimsun	mixandgo	what about a vanilla kernel.org one without RT?
2006-08-09T13:22:00.000Z	mixandgo	crimsun	have not tryed without the patch
