2010-02-21T01:21:00.000Z	con-man		I have a defunct app stuck on my monitor that I cannot get rid of, anyone have ideas?
2010-02-21T01:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	Alt-F2 type xkill - click the dead window
2010-02-21T01:23:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	I killed the dead window but I can't reload the program.  Its webcamstudio
2010-02-21T01:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	lol i was actually going to say that xkill isn't as good as kill - do you know the name of the process?  "ls aux | grep web" might tell you.
2010-02-21T01:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	sorry re-reading my post to you -- it's ps not ls!!!
2010-02-21T01:26:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	nothing really shows up, but ps aux shows 2 defunct process
2010-02-21T01:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	use either "kill PID#" or "killall PROCESSNAME" of the defunct stuff
2010-02-21T01:28:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	that doesn't work for defunct processes :(
2010-02-21T01:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	"kill -9 PID#" or "killall -9 PROCESSNAME"?
2010-02-21T01:29:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	even "kill -9 PID#"
2010-02-21T01:29:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	wont work
2010-02-21T01:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	logout / back in ?  probably the easiest
2010-02-21T01:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	i've been looking for "webcam studio", are you sure you installed it from the repository?  what is it called?
2010-05-02T20:15:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	K
2010-05-02T20:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	if you are using Lucid then you need to add the partner repo
2010-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	after installing libdvdread4 did you run the required script?
2010-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	it came installed with Ubuntu, what should I run?
2010-12-25T07:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	con-man	"sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh"
2010-12-25T07:25:00.000Z	con-man	ZykoticK9	cheers
