2008-03-18T20:25:00.000Z	Breth		Still got the busybox thingie
2008-03-18T20:25:00.000Z	Breth		Might it have to do with the fact that I didn't erase the hard disk? (Still has windows on it, I think)
2008-03-18T20:26:00.000Z	Breth		Okey
2008-03-18T20:26:00.000Z	Breth		Checking it now
2008-03-18T20:26:00.000Z	Breth		thanks
2008-03-18T20:27:00.000Z	Breth		The hardware is very very very old
2008-03-18T20:27:00.000Z	Breth		Haven't used it in years
2008-03-18T20:28:00.000Z	Breth		Oh, I misread
2008-03-18T20:29:00.000Z	Breth		I'm running the memtest
2008-03-18T20:29:00.000Z	Breth		what should i look for
2008-03-18T20:29:00.000Z	pike_	Breth	an explosion of badness
2008-03-18T20:31:00.000Z	Breth	_2	I just checked... I don't have enough ram: only 64...
2008-03-18T20:31:00.000Z	pike_	Breth	even on an ok lappy 256mb ram 1.4ghz proc i use the alternate install cd
2008-03-18T20:31:00.000Z	Breth		Ok, I'll download that
2008-03-18T20:32:00.000Z	Breth		thanks for the help
2008-03-18T20:32:00.000Z	pike_	Breth	also to add to what _2 said consider the xubuntu alt install cd instead of ubuntu with that much ram
2008-03-18T20:33:00.000Z	Breth		Hmm so xubuntu
2008-03-18T20:34:00.000Z	Breth		Downloading alternate xubuntu install
