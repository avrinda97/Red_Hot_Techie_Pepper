2006-05-21T09:50:00.000Z	Kyoske		i need some help
2006-05-21T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	what with?
2006-05-21T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	that is not exactly a helpful error message :)
2006-05-21T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	ok that's common, but your exact situation will clear up the wtf
2006-05-21T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	ubuntu is careful, it tries very hard not to screw your windows install
2006-05-21T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	you got to the partition section, and you were right to back out until you know what you are doing
2006-05-21T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	do you have a D: partition you don't care about?
2006-05-21T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	when you open windows filemanager, do you have a D: drive as sell as a C: drive?
2006-05-21T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	I'm gonna have to hand you off to people who know more about installing ubuntu onto resized partitions.
2006-05-21T10:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	they show up here, ask your question about every 10 minutes. That's how I got sucked into this channel. I asked questions, and then repeated the answers :)
2006-05-21T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	I'd been using ubuntu's parent for several years when ubuntu came out
2006-05-21T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	fine, but I really don't wanna screw up your windows install.
2006-05-21T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	I could say, for example, don't do this, 'give all of your disk to ubuntu' or some such during the install. Trust me, a little patience here will get you your answers
2006-05-22T05:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	I promise nothing :)
2006-05-22T05:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	I don't know much about the installer, I just used it a couple of times
2006-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	you need to really slow down, read what people say
2006-05-22T15:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	hi
2006-05-22T15:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	good. You were in a bad, bad place last I saw
2006-05-22T15:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyoske	that is a never ending process. Start with System-Preferences
