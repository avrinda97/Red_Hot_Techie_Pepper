2006-03-10T08:47:00.000Z	hanasaki		ok.. so why use aptitude when apt-get does the same thing and aptitude is built on it
2006-03-10T08:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hanasaki	aptitude handles downloads better but it really doesnt make a difference
2006-11-06T17:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hanasaki	just run gksudo "update-manager -c"\
2006-11-06T17:49:00.000Z	hanasaki	gnomefreak	i have a bunch of systems that need upgradeing remotely via just ssh... cant use the udpate-manager gui
2006-11-06T17:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hanasaki	than make sure you have no unofficial packages including xgl/compiz/beryl and make sure the package ubuntu-desktop in installed
2006-11-06T17:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hanasaki	than feel free to change dapper to edgy and update and upgrade
2006-11-06T17:51:00.000Z	hanasaki	gnomefreak	thanks!  what woudl be the issue if i had those packages xgl?
2006-11-06T17:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hanasaki	libgl1-mesa-glx would cause your upgrade to fail badly
2006-11-06T06:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hanasaki	fakeroot would be the package
2006-11-06T06:29:00.000Z	hanasaki	gnomefreak	hmmm apt-cache search fakeroot returns nothing
