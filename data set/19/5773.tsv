2011-01-25T15:52:00.000Z	syn3rgy		Is there a photo program that can batch resize photos. I heard Gimp can't do this?
2011-01-25T15:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	imagemagick
2011-01-25T15:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	gimp probably can do it, but much as with Photoshop it's more likely to be a total pain in the backside to do
2011-01-25T15:54:00.000Z	syn3rgy		It can? I just spend like 20 min google'n and could not find a "howto"
2011-01-25T15:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	what to do is use a little bash one-liner to loop over your directory and call convert for every image
2011-01-25T15:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	I don't know; I would *guess* it can but that's such a backwards way to do it ;-)
2011-01-25T15:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	how big do you want your images to be?
2011-01-25T15:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	you want a magic incantation like "for i in *.jpg; do convert $i -resize 320x240 smaller/$i; done;"
2011-01-25T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	that'll loop through all .jpg files in the current directory, make them 320x240 and save them in a sub-directory called "smaller" which you must make before you start
2011-01-25T15:57:00.000Z	syn3rgy	gordonjcp	thanks that was really nice of you!
2011-01-25T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	if you're not used to command-line tools it looks a bit scary, but then you realise you can do mindblowingly complex things just by asking
2011-01-25T15:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	also, "man convert" for the manual, which will tell you more than you could possibly want to know about the options
2011-01-25T15:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	if you say "320x" instead of "320x240" it will make the image 320px on its longest side, whichever way up it is
2011-01-25T15:59:00.000Z	syn3rgy	gordonjcp	OK so I just need the plugin for imagemagic and then use cmd
2011-01-25T15:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	sudo aptitude install imagemagick
2011-01-25T15:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp		or something similar
2011-01-25T16:00:00.000Z	syn3rgy	gordonjcp	OK I got it.
2011-01-25T16:01:00.000Z	syn3rgy	gordonjcp	this is the same thing that is rendering my thumbnails on a CMS that I use. Cool
2011-01-25T16:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	syn3rgy	you can do all sorts of processing
