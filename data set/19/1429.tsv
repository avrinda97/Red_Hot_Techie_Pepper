2011-01-26T17:24:00.000Z	iiname		followed the  steps at page http://www.conan.de/touchscreen/evtouch.html
2011-01-26T17:25:00.000Z	iiname		downloaded and unpacked the tar ball at /home/evtouch
2011-01-26T17:25:00.000Z	iiname		copied evtouch_drv.so to "/usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/"
2011-01-26T17:25:00.000Z	iiname		after that can't find xorg.conf in my computer
2011-01-26T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 theres no xorg.conf by default. you can make one. X auto configures for the most part these days
2011-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 by default there is no /etc/X11/xorg.conf  so if you edit that file.. it will be empty.
2011-01-27T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 so delete them..
2011-01-27T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 or tell the installer to use the, and reformat them.
2011-01-27T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 repartion the hd. delet them. resize the others..
2011-01-27T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 automatic partioning should make a swap partition.
2011-01-27T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 if theres nothing on the HD you want to keep. You can just tell it to auto partiion. but that will just make a / and /swap i think.
2011-01-27T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 how big of a hard drive is this anyway?
2011-01-27T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 never notic3ed. -  I would set up a / of like 20gb, and home of like 99gb and a swap of like 1 gb. (depending on your needs)
2011-01-27T21:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 i find 10gb too small for my / needs.
2011-01-27T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 you are making it way too hard. :)  it can be ext2/3/4
2011-01-27T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiname	 use of /boot/ is of debateable usefullness these days.
2011-02-24T20:10:00.000Z	iiname	Dr_Willis	can you help me install utouch please?
