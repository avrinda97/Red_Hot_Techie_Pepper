2006-08-23T14:31:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	you need to enable masquerading
2006-08-23T14:32:00.000Z	TokenBad	JackMacOKC	 I set that in the proftpd.conf...but it shows 127.0.0.1 instead of the internal ip
2006-08-23T14:32:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	127.0.0.1 is your internal ip, its not going to show your 192 or other private ip unless thats what you setup as your masquerading address
2006-08-23T14:33:00.000Z	TokenBad	JackMacOKC	 but what saying is the ip that goes to his machine is a 192.whatever address...and he needs the 192.whatever to point to his public ip
2006-08-23T14:34:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	i understand what you're saying, but thats not what you want. its correct for proftpd to say 127.0.0.1 masquerading as xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
2006-08-23T14:35:00.000Z	TokenBad	JackMacOKC	then why will it still not connect
2006-08-23T14:35:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	as long as that xxx ip is the one your public ip is, you're good.
2006-08-23T14:35:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	have you forwarded port 21 on your local router?
2006-08-23T14:35:00.000Z	TokenBad	JackMacOKC	yes
2006-08-23T14:35:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	you might also check to ensure your isp does not block port 21, many do
2006-08-23T14:38:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	you get it working?
2006-08-23T14:45:00.000Z	TokenBad	JackMacOKC	no
2006-08-23T14:45:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	TokenBad	why dont you pastebin your proftpd.conf for me
2006-08-23T14:50:00.000Z	TokenBad	JackMacOKC	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21509
