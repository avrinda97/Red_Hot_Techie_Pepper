2007-08-08T05:13:00.000Z	orange__		Is there a program able to erase a harddrive forever unable to recover the data
2007-08-08T05:13:00.000Z	orange__		Or particular files?
2007-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 making a new partition would probably do it ,  try with gparted
2007-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	orange__	Pelo	dban.
2007-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	orange__	Pelo	about dban or other way clean out my harddrive
2007-08-08T05:15:00.000Z	orange__	Pelo	how would i do that in linux
2007-08-08T05:15:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	I only suggested doing it in gparted,  I donT' know about dban
2007-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 in gparted,   just   sudo apt-get install gparted,  then   to run it   gksu gparted , just make a new allocation table on the hdd, I guess
2007-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 but I can't garrantie that a genius won'T be able to recover stuff on it
2007-08-08T05:18:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 run the command suggested
2007-08-08T05:19:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 that means  type that command in the terminal
2007-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	orange__	Pelo	not working
2007-08-08T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 linux is case sensitive, maybe that is the problem
2007-08-08T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 and ?
2007-08-08T05:22:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 that comand that was suggested in the error msg   dpkg -- reconfigre whatefver,  typ-e that command and then  try the install again
2007-08-08T05:23:00.000Z	orange__	Pelo	^_^ work
2007-08-08T05:24:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 congradulation
2007-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	orange__	Pelo	once it done i run it   gksu gparted . Would i able choose which to erase?
2007-08-08T05:26:00.000Z	Pelo	orange__	 you wonT' find a command to erase you will be making new partitions
