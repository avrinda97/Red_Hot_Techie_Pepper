2009-05-29T21:47:00.000Z	Joeseph		Hi.  I'm trying to connect to the internet on my desktop computer.   For some reason, the default network manager is telling me that my devices are "unmanaged".... how do I fix this?
2009-05-29T21:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	have you tried to set a static ip?
2009-05-29T21:48:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	I have in the past.....  do I need to disable that or something?
2009-05-29T21:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	check your /etc/network/interfaces file - if you see something about your Wireless i'd try and remove it and see what happens
2009-05-29T21:51:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	There's stuff there about my wireless, but it doesn't have any information about ip addresses or anything.  Should I remove it anyway?
2009-05-29T21:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	if you see wireless in that file i think that's why it's "not managed" in network manager - i'd back the file up and try removing the wireless stuff - then reboot and see if NM then picks it up.
2009-05-29T21:53:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	AH!  Somewhere in the middle I got internet! I saw the weather in my gnome panel! but now it's gone....   I don't feel like restarting my pc, but I can if I need to.  What's the command to reload the network manager?
2009-05-29T21:54:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	Well, never mind.   network Manager still says I'm unmanaged, but I'm connected somehow!
2009-05-29T21:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	not sure but you could try "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
2009-05-30T02:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	yes if it's a partition - but not at the same time...
2009-05-30T02:35:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	Hahaha.... alright... Ha! Now time to start working on some dual-booting.....
2009-05-30T02:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	grub lives in the MBR of the drive - so there is no Partition required for it
2009-05-30T02:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	what Flannel and jrib are saying is so true, but if you want to try different distros it's certainly possible to multi-boot as many linux/bsd/windows os's as you want with grub -- and all the linux's can use a common swap partition - have fun.
2009-05-30T02:42:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	Alright.  I'll probably try kde on ubuntu, and maybe I'll try Fedora another day.
2009-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	"man hdparm"
2009-05-30T05:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	ie "sudo hdparm -t /dev/sda"
2009-05-30T05:29:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	Thank you very much.     Man I want an ssd.
2009-05-30T05:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Joeseph	actually the ssd in my eee is slower then my desktop SATA HD
2009-05-30T05:31:00.000Z	Joeseph	ZykoticK9	Really?  Oh well... All my hardware still has IDE.....   I have older stuff.
