2010-08-26T03:10:00.000Z	roscogruen		the weather applet uses evaporation, rainfall, wind and sunlight to gauge ET value (how much to water yard)
2010-08-26T03:10:00.000Z	roscogruen		if there isn't one taht would one would ROCK.  values are easy to get off weather.com

2010-08-26T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	there is a weather applet that is currently being  developed,  maybe thats what your on about
2010-08-26T03:11:00.000Z	roscogruen	sebsebseb	i don't know about the developement
2010-08-26T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	ok so
2010-08-26T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	your on about the one that comes with Gnome and Ubuntu at the moment yeah?
2010-08-26T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	and a calender, on the top right of the panel,  well  thats going to be replaced,  with a clock that Canonical have made for 10.10, and so some guys worked on a weather applet,  and i'll get you a link
2010-08-26T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	here  http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/06/weather-indicator-applet-genesis-of.html
2010-08-26T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	I don't know if it will become an offical part of Ubuntu 10.10 or not, but if it doesn't already have it, and you get in contact with them, they can probably program in features you want
2010-08-26T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	roscogruen	well sure http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/07/whats-in-weather-indicator.html
