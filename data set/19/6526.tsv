2011-03-25T03:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	terry_	ram use and i love the prefetch dns in chromium, just my view. I use arora a lot too
2011-03-25T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	terry_	if you think firefox, chrome and IE are the only browsers you are mistaken ;)
2011-03-25T03:27:00.000Z	terry_	ActionParsnip	Oh I know that.  I use lynx every day.
2011-03-25T03:28:00.000Z	terry_	ActionParsnip	And I use konqueror some too.
2011-03-25T03:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	terry_	most users use firefox out of habit but if you try a few of the others you may find you like them too
2011-03-25T03:30:00.000Z	terry_	ActionParsnip	I use konqueror to transfer large piles of files from one pc to another via the split-window option, (drag and drop), (#1PC has FTP server)
2011-03-25T03:35:00.000Z	terry_	ActionParsnip	I'll try cromium. Installing now...
