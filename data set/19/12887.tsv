2005-06-22T14:35:00.000Z	bigfoot1		another firefox question, i run an extension that gives a real full-screen (no status bar, toolbars). Is there a way to have the URL displayed when the mouse is hovering over a hyperlink?
2005-06-22T14:36:00.000Z	bigfoot1		really? do tell.
2005-06-22T14:36:00.000Z	bigfoot1		i have greasemonkey, but which script?

2005-06-22T06:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1		hello all. I'm a newbie to Ubuntu/Linux. I have some 2 minor problems. After I hibernate my computer, and I try to get back on (by pressing the power button on the box), I get to see Ubuntu again but it's frozen. The other problem is that I have chosen to have some power management with my screen/display. In Prefencences-->Screensaver-->Advanced Tab-->upper right quadrant, I have checked all 3 of the boxes there. After some time away from my
2005-06-22T06:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1		 computer, when I return and hit a key on the keyboard or move the mouse, nothing happens, the screen does not go from off to on. If you have any feedback, I'm all ears. Thank you for helping a newbie.
2005-06-22T06:24:00.000Z	misaka	bigfoot1	- You're really best off trying to make questions as short and concise as possible, dude.
2005-06-22T06:24:00.000Z	misaka	bigfoot1	- I don't think anybody here is paid to try to sort through long/complicated questions.
2005-06-22T06:25:00.000Z	bigfoot1	misaka	i tried to make them as specific as possible so that we could get to work immediately 8-).    I'm sorry you find my questions long and complicated. Could it be because I put the whole story into one post, rather than chopping it up into several? 8-)
2005-06-22T06:26:00.000Z	misaka	bigfoot1	- Ya, two questions in one long post ... ;] 
2005-06-22T06:26:00.000Z	bigfoot1	misaka	yes. One reason i put the 2 questions in one was because they may be related.
2005-06-22T06:27:00.000Z	misaka	bigfoot1	- You're right, they may be. If you've changed your kernel lately then maybe that could be related ... either way, I've not encountered those issues recently, so can't really comment.
2005-06-22T06:35:00.000Z	misaka	bigfoot1	- Need isn't the same as *wanting* ... you probably *want* to reboot your Linux machine for kernel updates, more than you *need* to.
2005-06-22T08:11:00.000Z	bigfoot1	misaka	coz I don't think these other media players will allow me to control playback?
2005-06-22T08:12:00.000Z	bigfoot1	misaka	ok. i have vlc, xmms, totem, music player. hmmm. which should i try first, i wonder. 8-)
2005-06-22T08:14:00.000Z	bigfoot1	misaka	it's a windows media file ending with .wax extension. heard of it?
2005-06-22T08:19:00.000Z	bigfoot1	misaka	the .wax streaming file works in VLC with playback control! yippee.
