2007-01-18T09:58:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	the /pattern1/,/pattern2/ thing only works on lines
2007-01-18T10:02:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	do you understand what I mean?
2007-01-18T10:07:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	I understand. It looks like everything is on 1 line
2007-01-18T10:09:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	I mean the part that contains the stuff to replace is in one line, only the <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> is on a separate line at the beginning of the file
2007-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	I did this: sed -re 's#(^<secondary_location>.*)AllowLocalConfig="false"(.*</secondary_location>$)#\1AllowLocalConfig="true"\2#'
2007-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	trying
2007-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	sed '/^<secondary_location>/s#\(<proxy.*AllowLocalConfig="\)FALSE\(".*</proxy>\)#\1TRUE\2#' < test.xml >test2.xml    does nothing test2.xml=test.xml
2007-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	shall I pastebin the entire file for a better analysis?
2007-01-18T10:21:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	sure, pastebin the file
2007-01-18T10:25:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	its online now http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2052/
2007-01-18T10:26:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	so the file is two lines?
2007-01-18T10:27:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	it looks so. I hope it will stay in that format for the future but currently yes 2 lines
2007-01-18T10:27:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	ok, make sit a bit difficult to read
2007-01-18T10:28:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	I use an editor with wordwrap then it looks much clearer
2007-01-18T10:29:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	background is they disabled the option to allow the user to define a proxy for the sophos av secondary update url within the admin gui so I have to replace it ini my policy xml file by hand because I need it
2007-01-18T10:36:00.000Z	jrib	||arifaX	feedback on this:  sed -re 's#(<secondary_location><server[^>] *)AllowLocalConfig="false"#\1AllowLocalConfig="TRUE"#g
2007-01-18T10:39:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	WOW seems to work
2007-01-18T10:41:00.000Z	||arifaX	jrib	thank you very much. I hope I can understand the commands you gave me for later use by myself
