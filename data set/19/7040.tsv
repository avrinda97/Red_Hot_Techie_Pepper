2007-11-30T01:57:00.000Z	breakerfall		does anybody else have any idea why this ubuntu install is hanging at 89% on "checking for packages to remove" ?
2007-11-30T01:58:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	Is it connected to the net while installing?
2007-11-30T01:58:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		!es | ubuntu_
2007-11-30T01:59:00.000Z	breakerfall	ArthurArchnix	yes
2007-11-30T01:59:00.000Z	breakerfall	ArthurArchnix	I'm using the box right now to speak here... it doesn't lock the machine
2007-11-30T01:59:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	Have you tried installing without being connected?
2007-11-30T02:00:00.000Z	breakerfall	ArthurArchnix	I haven't - but should that cause a problem? And will I have to now start the whole thing again?
2007-11-30T02:00:00.000Z	breakerfall		I guess it can't hurt to try disconnecting now
2007-11-30T02:00:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	I'm confused. Are you saying that you're currently on one machine chatting here, and looking at another machine that has hung at "removing packages"
2007-11-30T02:01:00.000Z	breakerfall	ArthurArchnix	I'm using the machine that I'm installing ubuntu on (live CD)
2007-11-30T02:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	If you begin the installation connected to the net, and during installation you lose your connection, it could cause the installation to hang as it looks for repos that were available at the start of install but are no longer. That's just a guess. In any event, if you've checked for errors the next thing I'd try is disconnecting the cd. I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
2007-11-30T02:03:00.000Z	breakerfall	ArthurArchnix	I haven't disconnected the net, or anything. The machine was left alone and twice it's done the same thing :(
2007-11-30T02:03:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	Excuse me, not disconnecting the cd, but disconnecting the network while installing.
2007-11-30T02:03:00.000Z	breakerfall	ArthurArchnix	I didn't disconnect the network :)
2007-11-30T02:03:00.000Z	breakerfall		are you saying there are install logs I can see now?
2007-11-30T02:04:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	I understand. All the same, if you've checked the cd for errors then the next thing I would try is to install without being connected. When you get to the part that says "autoconfigurig network failed" just skip it and say "dont' configure now I'll configure later".
2007-11-30T02:05:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	If at that point you still hang and have errors, I would switch to the alternate cd.
2007-11-30T02:08:00.000Z	breakerfall		thanks for your help ArthurArchnix
2007-11-30T02:09:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	breakerfall	Best of luck
