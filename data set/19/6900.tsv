2007-11-18T14:02:00.000Z	nephlim		missed*
2007-11-18T14:03:00.000Z	nephlim		it's nearly 4am here, on hour 21 :)
2007-11-18T14:03:00.000Z	nephlim		np
2007-11-18T14:04:00.000Z	nephlim		does anyone know how i can keep my ssh connection to a bbs alive?
2007-11-18T14:05:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	need more detaisl
2007-11-18T14:06:00.000Z	nephlim	cowbud	i do " ssh foo@foo.blah.com", via terminal, do usual bbs stuff. if i'm idle for too long, it's unresponsive, have to re-log in
2007-11-18T14:07:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	do you get a shell or is it a straight up bbs?
2007-11-18T14:07:00.000Z	nephlim	cowbud	it just takes over the terminal i'm using
2007-11-18T14:08:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	well what software is it running:?
2007-11-18T14:10:00.000Z	nephlim	cowbud	the bbs is Citadel
2007-11-18T14:10:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	yeah your only hope is some sort of interactive script that when you press a key combination it sends something every so often to keep you from being idle
2007-11-18T14:13:00.000Z	nephlim	cowbud	thanks for the help. i'm going to google keepalive scripts. any pointers for that?
2007-11-18T14:14:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	not off the top of my head, why are you trying to stay on?
2007-11-18T14:15:00.000Z	nephlim	cowbud	because if i put it aside for longer than 20 min, i have to log back in. sometimes other projects get my attention
2007-11-18T14:15:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	i'd complain to the sysadmin ;)
2007-11-18T14:16:00.000Z	nephlim	cowbud	hehe. yeah
2007-11-18T14:16:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	if you are connecting with ssh then that is your bbs client :)
2007-11-18T14:16:00.000Z	cowbud	nephlim	doubtful but possible
