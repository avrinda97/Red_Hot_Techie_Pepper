2009-12-19T21:06:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p		is there any difference between fgrep and grep?
2009-12-19T21:06:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	'man grep', read section OPTIONS -> Matcher Selection.
2009-12-19T21:06:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	egrep is grep -E, fgrep is grep -F.
2009-12-19T21:07:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	grawity	Thanks, mobi-sheep : It's answered by grawity :)
2009-12-19T21:08:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	C-a, C-X (note the uppercase X)
2009-12-19T21:33:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	"exists and is a regular file"
2009-12-19T21:34:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	Type 'help test' for more info. ("[" is an alias to "test")
2009-12-19T21:34:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	grawity	thanks again dude :)
2009-12-19T21:34:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	And remember, [ is just a command, like any other.
2009-12-19T21:35:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	grawity	Ok, thanks again ^_^
2009-12-30T20:46:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	Copy file descriptor #2 (stderr) to #1 (stdout), causing all error messages to be printed to stdout. 'man bash'.
2009-12-30T20:48:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	Usually, when you use it in "command 2>&1 > somefile", it's shorter to use "command >& somefile" instead.
2009-12-30T20:52:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	grawity	the script i'm studying with use this « some_command >/dev/null 2>&1 » . I'm not sure what this means. Does it means every output from the command will be located in /dev/null as well as the errors? What's /dev/null for anyway?
2009-12-30T20:53:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	The normal output (stdout) is redirected to /dev/null -- in other words, discarded. Everything you write to /dev/null disappears.
2009-12-30T20:53:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	And then 2>&1 redirects stderr to stdout - so it too goes to /dev/null.
2009-12-30T20:54:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	In other words, everything that the program outputs is discarded.
2009-12-30T20:54:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	A shorter version of the same is 'some_command >& /dev/null'
2009-12-30T20:54:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	grawity	So, everything will be gone? So no error and output will be reported?
2009-12-30T20:55:00.000Z	grawity	isolat3dsh33p	Correct.
