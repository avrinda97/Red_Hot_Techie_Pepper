2007-09-27T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	change the sudouers file ?
2007-09-27T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	join #php
2007-09-27T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	there are a few ways
2007-09-27T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	how ?
2007-09-27T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	so your not executing php through the webserver ?
2007-09-27T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	then you don't use sudo
2007-09-27T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	you use php system functions to execute the code as a different user through the webserver, hence why I said #php may be a better channel to explain this technique
2007-09-27T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	sure, perhaps I've missunderstood
2007-09-27T15:03:00.000Z	mojo	ikonia_	i have a php script, in that php i want to execute a command which requires root previlegde
2007-09-27T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	ok, so your calling a binary application through php through the webserver
2007-09-27T15:04:00.000Z	mojo	ikonia_	exactly
2007-09-27T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	can you not call sudo ?
2007-09-27T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	I won't lecture you on the risks as I assume your aware
2007-09-27T15:06:00.000Z	mojo	ikonia_	but the sudo require password, i want sudo without password. I aware of the security but we develop a small application for embedded device
2007-09-27T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	ok - what you need to do on this is change the sudoers file to change the auth to not require a password for the specific commands you want
2007-09-27T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	don't setuid a command
2007-09-27T15:08:00.000Z	mojo	ikonia_	i can change the sudoer files, but i dont exactly what needd to be changed
2007-09-27T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	one moment
2007-09-27T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia_	mojo	I've got the correct sudoers line for you
