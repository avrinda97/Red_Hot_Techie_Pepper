2009-12-02T01:51:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	tried to install epiphany browser, same problem, no java
2009-12-02T01:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	you did sun-java6-jre ?
2009-12-02T01:40:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	I tried that first, and then I manually installed it instead
2009-12-02T01:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	maybe a new Firefox profile will help
2009-12-02T01:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	also if it's installed, it should work in other browsers as well such as Epiphany and Galeon.  sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser by the way if it's just epiphany you get a game
2009-12-02T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	well I think Java is like Flash when it comes to the browsers in Ubuntu
2009-12-02T01:42:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	I tried to create a new profile, I get the same error LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library /opt/java/32/jre1.6.0_17/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so [/opt/java/32/jre1.6.0_17/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so: cannot open shared object file: Permission denied]
2009-12-02T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	ok well what about Java in both browsers I mentioned or at least one of them Epiphany ?
2009-12-02T01:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	that's after an upgrade from 9.04?
2009-12-02T01:53:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	yes
2009-12-02T01:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	it worked fine in 9.04?
2009-12-02T01:54:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	yes :)
2009-12-02T01:54:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	it used to work on 9.04
2009-12-02T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	maybe there's another way, but I guess a clean install of Ubuntu will sort it out
2010-05-02T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	By the way, why do you want to downgrade?
2010-05-02T01:28:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	I'm running on a T60, I have wavy video on the external monitor, sound in flash stopped working, tomboy doesn't work, and tasque no longer integrates with evolution...
2010-05-02T01:29:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	also, sound crackles in audacious as well
2010-05-02T01:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	romeus	is that a clean install of 10.04?
2010-05-02T01:29:00.000Z	romeus	sebsebseb	upgrade from karmic
