2008-07-10T19:34:00.000Z	speed1		if i installed ubuntu/hardy with my hd/bios set to IDE mode, will ubuntu still boot if i switch that to AHCI? (i know you can't switch for windows)
2008-07-10T19:35:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	with some tweaking, yes (grub, fstab etc.)
2008-07-10T19:36:00.000Z	speed1	DeadPanda	what kind of tweaking? i use UUIDs in both of those files -- would that prevent the need to tweak?
2008-07-10T19:36:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	You might get away with GRUB, if it's the only drive in the system - I've never experimented with UUID's much, so YMMV
2008-07-10T19:37:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	keep a Live CD handy in case you need to poke around, though :)
2008-07-10T19:37:00.000Z	speed1	DeadPanda	ï»¿i guess my question was more....are the only changes that might be necessary are drive paths /dev/Xda ..or some other settings?
2008-07-10T19:40:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	they're the only settings I think'll matter - everything else should be fine
2008-07-10T19:40:00.000Z	speed1	DeadPanda	k, thanks
2008-07-10T20:25:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	weren't you asking about switching to AHCI before? :)
2008-07-10T20:25:00.000Z	speed1	DeadPanda	i didn't switch :P i was in a liveCD reinstall grub when i asked about that...in a livecd cause my system was already having this grub error i thought the grub install would fix
2008-07-10T20:26:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	ah - just check you're pointing GRUB at the right drive, and to where /boot/grub/menu.lst is
2008-07-10T20:26:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	it isn't as simple as just installing GRUB
2008-07-10T20:30:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	that looks fine, scroll up to see what legend said about post GRUB installation configuration, though
2008-07-10T20:33:00.000Z	speed1	DeadPanda	 following those instructions, shows me grub is already set correctly (0,3)
2008-07-10T20:33:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	and when you reboot, it still fails?
2008-07-10T20:34:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	that sounds broken - it looks like you've done everything right so far, so I'm stumped
2008-07-10T20:36:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	hmm, just cross-reference it with fdisk -l, and remember grub's 0-indexed, (sda1,1 -> (hd0,0) etc.)
2008-07-10T20:41:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	GRUB can be idiosyncratic - tried (hd1,3) etc.?
2008-07-10T20:41:00.000Z	DeadPanda	speed1	although I admit, that's fishing
