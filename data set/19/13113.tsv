2005-05-19T09:17:00.000Z	dabaSlon		or can it be anything that runs movies>?
2005-05-19T09:17:00.000Z	mdJake	dabaSlon	you mean?
2005-05-19T09:17:00.000Z	mdJake	dabaSlon	It's not good?
2005-05-19T09:18:00.000Z	dabaSlon	mdJake	I have instructions on how to install MPlayer, step by step...
2005-05-19T09:18:00.000Z	dabaSlon	mdJake	yeah, maybe there are none, maybe there are too...
2005-05-19T09:18:00.000Z	mdJake	dabaSlon	I have mplayer but behaves strangely
2005-05-19T09:19:00.000Z	dabaSlon	mdJake	areyou trying to get MPlayer, then? Is that your mission?
2005-05-19T09:19:00.000Z	mdJake	dabaSlon	e.g. can't open a video with it when another instance is already open
2005-05-19T09:23:00.000Z	mdJake	dabaSlon	do you have mozilla-mplayer set up?
2005-05-19T10:22:00.000Z	dabaSlon	mdJake	well...
