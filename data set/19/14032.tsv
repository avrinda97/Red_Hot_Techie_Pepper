2005-03-24T17:10:00.000Z	gilles		During the boot in hoary, the part "Configuring network interfaces..." lasts about 2 min, what can I do to speed it up ?
2005-03-24T17:11:00.000Z	niran	gilles	if you don't have a connection, press ctrl-c to stop it and continue the boot process
2005-03-24T09:39:00.000Z	niran	gilles	type "apt-cache policy esound" in a terminal
2005-03-24T09:39:00.000Z	gilles	niran	it's installed
2005-03-24T09:40:00.000Z	niran	gilles	have you updated recently?
2005-03-24T09:40:00.000Z	gilles	niran	yes, i just installed the new hoary yesterday
2005-03-24T09:41:00.000Z	niran	gilles	do the event sounds seem normal?
2005-03-24T09:41:00.000Z	gilles	niran	i have a nice sound at the beginning, but then, it's always the very quick sound that looks like a buggy sound
2005-03-24T09:42:00.000Z	niran	gilles	in a terminal, type "killall -9 esd"
2005-03-24T09:42:00.000Z	gilles	niran	it works now!
2005-03-24T09:42:00.000Z	gilles	niran	thanks!!
2005-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	niran	gilles	you're welcome
2005-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	niran	gilles	there's one issue though
2005-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	gilles	niran	where did it come from ?
2005-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	gilles	niran	how do you know that ?
2005-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	gilles	niran	is this problem definitely fixed, or just for this session?
2005-03-24T09:44:00.000Z	niran	gilles	far from definitely fixed, i just knew killing esd would change something
2005-03-25T17:28:00.000Z	niran	gilles	when the sound isn't working right, type "ps -ef | grep esd" in a terminal
2005-03-25T17:30:00.000Z	gilles	niran	okay, i'll reboot and try that
