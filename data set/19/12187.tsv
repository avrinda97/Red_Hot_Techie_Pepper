2006-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	liquidten2		I jsut can't get scim to work in Gaim >_>
2006-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	duncanm	liquidten2	right click on the input box
2006-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	liquidten2		I assume I have to hit shift+enter to send a message through scim?
2006-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	duncanm	liquidten2	make sure the input method is SCIM
2006-08-03T10:20:00.000Z	liquidten2		(00:20:21) sasquatch left the room (requested by nalioth: "english please").
2006-08-03T10:21:00.000Z	liquidten2		I didn't even know IRC supported the proper encodings for Japanese in the first place <_<
2006-08-03T10:22:00.000Z	duncanm	liquidten2	does that work now?
2006-08-03T10:23:00.000Z	liquidten2	duncanm	 Both SCIM input method and X Input method work, but when I go to hit enter I cannot actually send the message.  (I assume that SCIM is taking the enter, not GAIM)
2006-08-03T10:24:00.000Z	duncanm		oh
2006-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	duncanm	liquidten2	i had that thing before......
2006-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	duncanm		i forgot how i fixed it
2006-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	duncanm	liquidten2	it might be an SCIM config thing
2006-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	duncanm	liquidten2	you might have the 'decide' key set to enter
2006-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	duncanm		i'm really pissed off about this CIFS thing
2006-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	duncanm		why is it so determined to match UIDs for me
2006-08-03T10:26:00.000Z	duncanm		i thought that was the reason why people used SMB over NFS
