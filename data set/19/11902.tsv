2011-12-26T16:47:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	touch "$(date +%F)"
2011-12-26T16:50:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	same effect with the `` syntax: it only creates a file named $(date +%F)
2011-12-26T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	did you use double quotes?
2011-12-26T16:51:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	and how are you running this?
2011-12-26T16:51:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	yes i did - i use grsync and put it into special options to "run before sync"
2011-12-26T16:52:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	ah, that doesn't run it via a proper shell I guess.
2011-12-26T16:52:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	ok but how to do it without a shell?
2011-12-26T16:54:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	wrap your touch in a small shellscript and have grsync execute that
2011-12-26T16:55:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	ok seems no way without a script. how to give the preset name to that script to write it to the filename too? (have several jobs in grsync)
2011-12-26T16:57:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	http://paste.pocoo.org/show/526012/. Then call it as scriptname_here jobname_here
2011-12-26T16:58:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	ok i'll try that tnx for now
2011-12-26T17:05:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	hm i do not find out how to run this script - no sh, no bash, no ./script.sh - errors all the time. man does not help too....
2011-12-26T17:06:00.000Z	Seveas	raven	did you make it executable?
2011-12-26T17:10:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	yes
2011-12-26T17:15:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	it is executable
2011-12-26T17:28:00.000Z	raven	Seveas	?
