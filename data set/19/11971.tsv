2005-10-31T16:39:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	It actually IS a standard location ;-)
2005-10-31T16:39:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	According to the LSB-rules, this is a possible location :-)
2005-10-31T16:40:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	gnome is not a user added extra package...
2005-10-31T16:40:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	I read some discussions about this issue, maybe I can find some information, mom ;-)
2005-10-31T16:40:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#OPTADDONAPPLICATIONSOFTWAREPACKAGES
2005-10-31T16:40:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	But, to cut it down, it depends on how you interpret the standard
2005-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	I see, LSB and FHS are not the same thing, so, SuSE builds it's filesystem according to the LSB-standard ;-)
2005-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	LSB builds off of FHS
2005-10-31T16:44:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	If you read http://lsbbook.gforge.freestandards.org/install-app.html you will see the LSB specifically references FHS
2005-10-31T16:44:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	Okay, thanks for your informations ;-)
2005-10-31T16:45:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	Didn't know that, so ...
2005-10-31T16:45:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	Learn something new every day :-)
2005-10-31T16:45:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	Even after using Linux for years ;-)
2005-10-31T16:46:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	But, I guess, that's the reason why we all are linux-fanatics
2005-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	yes
2005-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	/usr is for the "main distribution" and /opt is for "additional" binaries. Most would agree that Ubuntu is a desktop distro primarily and gnome is part of the main distro
2005-10-31T16:48:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	Yeah, I pretty much agree - altough I prefer KDE over GNOME ;-)
2005-10-31T16:48:00.000Z	SEJeff	Zeep	Same goes for KDE :) /usr
2005-10-31T16:49:00.000Z	Zeep	SEJeff	that's pretty clear ;-)
