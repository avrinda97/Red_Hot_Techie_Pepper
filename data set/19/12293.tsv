2005-09-24T12:33:00.000Z	xor2k5		Hi!
2005-09-24T12:34:00.000Z	xor2k5		I got the latest ubuntu, but networking doesn't work. The 8139too driver seems to be broken for my chip
2005-09-24T12:34:00.000Z	xor2k5		Both Knoppix and Kanotix work, but Ubuntu doesn't want to let me use my network
2005-09-24T12:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: wont be the 8139 driver, since its a kernel driver. the kernel has no bugs
2005-09-24T12:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: prolly the driver aint inserted in the kernel but the module insert scripts.
2005-09-24T12:35:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	I inserted it manually
2005-09-24T12:36:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	I configured the whole network - my IP and a gateway - in the console
2005-09-24T12:37:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: then it is definatly the boot scripts that aint inserting int automatically
2005-09-24T12:37:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: not sure where ubuntu puts the command
2005-09-24T12:37:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	They inserted it, but I deleted it and modprobed it again
2005-09-24T12:38:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	.oO(some network drivers need to be kicked)
2005-09-24T12:38:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: not for ubuntu, but for your machine, the kernel is independant of ubuntu, but you wont get it right so dont bother, its not as difficult, but just too much effort to explain
2005-09-24T12:40:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: it uses sources from kernel.org and puts in every possible module it can. nothing special.
2005-09-24T12:40:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: just like slackware would do, its the correct way.
2005-09-24T12:41:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	Yeah, but why is 8139too broken then?
2005-09-24T12:41:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	I can't remember it being broken in a vanilla kernel
2005-09-24T12:41:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: do you listen @ all? <lsuactiafner> xor2k5 : prolly the driver aint inserted in the kernel but the module insert scripts
2005-09-24T12:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	xor2k5	: you're being annoying. am going back to work.
2005-09-24T12:42:00.000Z	xor2k5	lsuactiafner	do so, but though thx
