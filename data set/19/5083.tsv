2009-04-12T01:47:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	kernel most likely.
2009-04-12T01:47:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	not necesarily
2009-04-12T01:47:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	yup
2009-04-12T01:49:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	somtimes kernels brake compatability. chances are the bug was already found and he can install the latest wireless-compat
2009-04-12T01:50:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	right. we'll see.
2009-04-12T01:50:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	I know sometimes it could even be a networkamanger update causing compatibility issues with old config files.
2009-04-12T01:50:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	so it highly depends :]
2009-04-12T01:51:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	I'd first try creating another user and trying to log on to the wifi that way
2009-04-12T01:51:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	he says that when he attepts to connect his system freezes
2009-04-12T01:51:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	looks hardware'ish
2009-04-12T01:51:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	so kernel'ish
2009-04-12T01:51:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	dunno :-) intel card was it?
2009-04-12T01:52:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	yup, and I asked if he just updated.. so all things point to kernel
2009-04-12T01:52:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	I guess using linux-backports-modules could help ;]
2009-04-12T01:52:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	AGN card too
2009-04-12T01:53:00.000Z	dotblank	imachine	That would work. but the AGN chip I know is in the main kernel.. I think I fixed before actually
2009-04-12T01:54:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	it is. but backports are often newer.
2009-04-12T01:54:00.000Z	imachine	dotblank	dunno. sometimes the backported driver works better, sometimes worse, sometimes not at all :)
