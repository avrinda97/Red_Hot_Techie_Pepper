2005-01-11T10:35:00.000Z	nicedreams		how do the times work in cron?  I never understood that?
2005-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	nicedreams		are the times the way they are displayed or different?  It seems like sometimes 12:00pm is really 2:00pm and so on
2005-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	nicedreams		so UTC times work?
2005-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	nicedreams		ah....i'll keep googling for that part
2005-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	nicedreams		thx for the line of code though
2005-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	nicedreams		i'll use that
2005-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	nicedreams		lmao
2005-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	nicedreams		i hate how google sometimes only shows you where to buy a product when your looking up specs for it
2005-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicedreams	 yea annoying. Or ya do a typo and the links are all "Buy Compputers" here!
2005-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicedreams	 Hmm.. Mine does work that way.
2005-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicedreams	 it may depend on the game and gamepad to some degree
2005-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	nicedreams	dr_willis	I have a logitech dual action joy and only one works or the other
2005-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	nicedreams	dr_willis	do you know the joy commands so I can try to set them?  When I use Freevo, only the analong stick works and I want the directional pad
2005-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicedreams	 no idea. I got a cheap PS2 style gamepad from siatek - and i can set up mame to use them both..  try 'cat /dev/input/js0' - wiggle the sticks hit the buttons if they all print jibberish they are working. :P
2005-05-01T11:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicedreams	 and if they are all working - its configureing the program to use them right.
2005-05-01T11:24:00.000Z	nicedreams	dr_willis	thx
2005-05-01T11:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicedreams	 its possible that dma is not enabled for your dvd drive. Mine wasent.
2005-05-01T11:36:00.000Z	nicedreams	dr_willis	ah....that makes sense
2005-05-01T11:37:00.000Z	nicedreams	dr_willis	should I just edit the /etc/hdparm.conf?
