2006-08-28T12:09:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		I've got an ancient laptop I'm trying to put ubuntu on.
2006-08-28T12:09:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		300 mhz and 256 MB of RAM
2006-08-28T12:10:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		Just blew away the partition that XP was on, now I'm trying to install ubuntu.. bt it just goes to a black screen and a _ flashing at the top.
2006-08-28T12:10:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		Any help or advice?
2006-08-28T12:10:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		grub?
2006-08-28T12:11:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		Thank you PWill
2006-08-28T12:11:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		I had XP on it.
2006-08-28T12:11:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		I put in the XP disc and used it to delete the partition that XP was on.
2006-08-28T12:12:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		Turned off the laptop, put in ubuntu and started the install.
2006-08-28T12:12:00.000Z	PWill	Tomtheman70	which version of ubuntu do you have?
2006-08-28T12:13:00.000Z	PWill	Tomtheman70	get the alternative text version
2006-08-28T12:16:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	PWill	how long does the Nautilus part of the install take?
2006-08-28T12:16:00.000Z	PWill	Tomtheman70	depends. you said you have an old lappy, so it could take a while
2006-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	PWill	Tomtheman70	i have 1.8 in my laptop :)
2006-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	PWill	last time I tried the install, after the Nautilus part of the install the logo went away and the laptop just kinda hung there.
2006-08-28T12:19:00.000Z	PWill	Tomtheman70	hooray!
2006-08-28T12:20:00.000Z	PWill	Tomtheman70	i gotta go. i hope it works out
2006-08-28T12:21:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	PWill	thanks a lot.
