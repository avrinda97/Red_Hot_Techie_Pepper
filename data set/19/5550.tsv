2008-06-08T10:03:00.000Z	BonezAU		Hi, I have AMD64 ubuntu 8.04 and am having problems watching videos on youtube. what do I need to do? they just don't show up
2008-06-08T10:05:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	flashplugin-nonfree is installed. right?
2008-06-08T10:05:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	flashplugin-nonfree is already the newest version.
2008-06-08T10:09:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	if you type   about:plugins  in the firefox address box on top and look for Shockwave Flash see if its enabled
2008-06-08T10:09:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	I have Shockwave Flash (enabled) and FutureSplash player (enabled)
2008-06-08T10:10:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	it used to work on my PC just a few days go. Now anything that is flash just shows up completely blank. Even when I go to the adobe site the flash animation is missing all together
2008-06-08T10:10:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	and when you go to youtube nothing shows?
2008-06-08T10:10:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	the page loads up with everything except the movie player itself. It's just a big blank white box
2008-06-08T10:11:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	firefox 3?
2008-06-08T10:11:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	Swiftfox 3
2008-06-08T10:12:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	never tried swiftfox but i would think it should work
2008-06-08T10:12:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	yeah, everything else works fine. And like I said, it was working a few days ago
2008-06-08T10:15:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	open Edit>preferences>applications and look for Shockwave Flash file is it set to use Shockwave flash?
2008-06-08T10:15:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	this is what it looks like: http://img296.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotxz2.png
2008-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	edit/prefs/applications - the list is completely empty. nothing in it at all
2008-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	shouldn't be empty. that is where you assign which programs and plugins to use with which file type
2008-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	Let me try and uninstall swiftfox and install it again.
2008-06-08T10:20:00.000Z	BonezAU	SgtSchultz	I removed and reinstalled swiftfox, same problem - so I just removed swiftfox all together and am using firefox 3 now. The applications list shows up fine and also youtube is working again. thanks for the help
2008-06-08T10:21:00.000Z	SgtSchultz	BonezAU	your welcome
