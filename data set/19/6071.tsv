2008-04-15T11:15:00.000Z	kdorf		I have an interesting network related problem if someone who is knowledgeable would like to help out :)
2008-04-15T11:17:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	what do you need this for?
2008-04-15T11:17:00.000Z	kdorf	djay-il	I'm behind a university firewall. I have a VPN that forwards ports so I can break out of it, but it's no good if my game doesn't bind to the VPN device (which it doesn't by default)
2008-04-15T11:31:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	can you ssh to your VPN IP?
2008-04-15T11:32:00.000Z	kdorf	djay-il	yes, that works.
2008-04-15T11:38:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	and thinking that ssh client probably uses TCP, then here you go
2008-04-15T11:39:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	unop, Robbie_Crash: I have an idea
2008-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	IF those users connect to your real IP, maybe some routing on you local part will help?
2008-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	kdorf	djay-il	There's not anything I can do, the ports are all firewalled
2008-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	bummer
2008-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	kdorf	djay-il	The only way to get around it is a tunnel
2008-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	yea, well
2008-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	hey, we wanted to help :-)
2008-04-15T11:44:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	try grc.com
2008-04-15T11:45:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	it has some advantages
2008-04-15T11:45:00.000Z	kdorf	djay-il	I'm sure it probably does, but that doesn't help me at all :)
2008-04-15T11:45:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	they weren't thinking about you. They are thinking about making money.
2008-04-15T11:45:00.000Z	djay-il	kdorf	its not your fault
2008-04-15T11:46:00.000Z	kdorf	djay-il	Of course not. :P
