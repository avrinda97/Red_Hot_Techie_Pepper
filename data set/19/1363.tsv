2011-02-15T02:23:00.000Z	Odaym		hello
2011-02-15T02:23:00.000Z	Odaym		i am at the partitioning menu now, and i have sda1 (unknown) 1 MB, sda2 (ntfs) 1.6 GB, sda3 (ntfs) 104 MB, sda4 (ntfs 107 GB has windows on it) and free space (141 GB).. i have them down in the list all available with their details but the free space is labeled "unusable"
2011-02-15T02:24:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	that's because you can only have 4 primary partitions
2011-02-15T02:25:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 what type of machine do you have?? OS?
2011-02-15T02:25:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 can you reinstall windows 7?
2011-02-15T02:27:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 your problem is you need to create an extended partition if you want ubuntu on its own partition or use wubi inside windows 7
2011-02-15T02:28:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	  you just mentioned your data is precious, I would rather do it manually then -- I wouldnt delete partitions, just back up my data -- then reinstall windows 7
2011-02-15T02:30:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 it all depends on how you install, you still havent told me what type of machine you have, but with windows 7 using restore CD some funky things happen,  usually win7 has 2 partitions but a restore utility creats its own, you have to figure out what partition you can delete to create an extended partition
2011-02-15T02:32:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 OK well Dell netbooks with XP come with an extra partition to use with the restore utility -- you can delete that one.  In your case, the trick is to find what partition you can delete so you can create an extended partition,
2011-02-15T02:34:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	  that is what you have to figure out -- what partition you can delete, basically first back up your data - then delete a partition you believe you dont need , reboot to see if windows 7 still works, then create an extended partition and allocate all free space on it
2011-02-15T02:36:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 I threw him off using an example, I kept asking but you replied too late, that's why it's important to mention the hardware you have, it's not the same on all machines and then some people might be experienced with the actual hardware that you have, all I have is Dell
2011-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 you **might** be able to delete the partition but dont take my word for it -- back up your data first!
2011-02-15T02:38:00.000Z	Odaym	tucemiux_live	i asked someone else about dual boot, and he says that i can create a partition ON windows, that i can use to install Ubuntu on?!
2011-02-15T02:39:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	youll actually install ubuntu ***inside*** windows, you can try wubi -- you can also try ubuntu virtually using virtualbox
2011-02-15T02:41:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 running ubuntu inside windows means exactly that, you boot up windows and then you run ubuntu -- what question do you have about that?
2011-02-15T02:41:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	you know how to open internet explorer in windows?
2011-02-15T02:42:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	same concept, instead of IE you open up wubi -- or if you use virtualbox, youll fireup virtualbox and then run ubuntu, I highly recommend virtualbox first so you can get a good taste of ubuntu inside windows
2011-02-15T02:43:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	yup yup
2011-02-15T02:55:00.000Z	tucemiux_live	Odaym	 maybe you have caplocks on?  You can also ssh -v
