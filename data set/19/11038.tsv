2007-01-23T08:45:00.000Z	psYchotic		! sympa
2007-01-23T08:47:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	How did you do that, then? ;o
2007-01-23T08:48:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	I got 5 laptops, or more sitting here that can't use it.. the interface isn't found
2007-01-23T08:48:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	I dunno, turn your wireless on, and do a "sudo modprobe ipw3945"
2007-01-23T08:48:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	lsmod shows the modules loaded already. The interface is nowhere to be found
2007-01-23T08:49:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	and you tried removing the modules, enabling your interface (with the switch on your laptop) and then reinserting them?
2007-01-23T08:49:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	There is no switch. Only software switches <.<
2007-01-23T08:50:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	weird
2007-01-23T08:50:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	Yeah..
2007-01-23T08:51:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	apparently, it's in the restricted modules package
2007-01-23T08:53:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	but you said you already have the module, right
2007-01-23T08:53:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	The module is there, apparently. But it's not used, nor is the interface there
2007-01-23T08:53:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	and you  have tried to do iwconfig eth1?
2007-01-23T08:54:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	eth1 does not exist. ;)
2007-01-23T08:55:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	weird crap. I have no idea how I did it all. But say, your interface is in a laptop, right, and you can't find any physical switch anywhere?
2007-01-23T08:56:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	I didn't check propperly, I got an IBM Thinkpad T43 myself.. but the T60's had a rf-switch, so I found that. But that's not the prob ;p
2007-01-23T08:57:00.000Z	psYchotic	ErZo	well, I know mine isn't properly detected when it isn't switched on, I sometimes have to remove the module, enable the nic, and then reinsert the module
2007-01-23T08:58:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	Well, I do believe it was switched off. I don't believe they'd turn the switch off the switch after shutting down windows/before booting ubuntu :P
2007-01-23T08:58:00.000Z	ErZo	psYchotic	switched on*
