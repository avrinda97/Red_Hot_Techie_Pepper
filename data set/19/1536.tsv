2011-01-02T22:02:00.000Z	aimio		anyone know why i don't have a GNOME session availible in my sessions bar :S
2011-01-02T22:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	do you see a "Ubuntu Desktop" or "Ubuntu Netbook" as a session option?  These are technically both Gnome.
2011-01-02T22:05:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	i have those but i did something to mess them up beacuse now the netbook and the desktop are lookin the same wich i don't want,
2011-01-02T22:06:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	the reason why i tried to change this up was i had no desktop control, i could not right click on the desktop to change background, add folders etc.. and now i have messed it all upp.. :S
2011-01-02T22:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	sorry I don't have any suggestions for you.  Best of luck.  The not being able to RC on desktop (origional problem) I may have been able to help with.
2011-01-02T22:08:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	can you tell me the origional problem fix. ? /is it to disable nautilus ?../
2011-01-02T22:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	gconftool-2 --set "/apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop" --type bool "true"
2011-01-03T00:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	so when you right click the desktop nothing happens?  Do you have a background image?
2011-01-03T00:02:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	cant right click, and yes i have the defualt background image.
2011-01-03T00:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	oh - so you also have a right click issue then
2011-01-03T00:03:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	no i don't it's a desktop issue
2011-01-03T00:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	do you have icons on your desktop?
2011-01-03T00:04:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	no i don
2011-01-03T00:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	but not on panels - that's separate from desktop i believe - could this be some sort of gnome mouse setting issue?
2011-01-03T00:05:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	i had this issue before but i fixed it somehow i just forgot how i did it but i know for sure it has something to do with nautilus
2011-01-03T00:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	where you running netbook or unity interface or something other then gnome at one point?
2011-01-03T00:06:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	it's a fresh ubuntu netbook 10.10 install, but when in login i choose ubuntu desktop. instead of netbook.
2011-01-03T00:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aimio	i have no idea man.  i bet netbook is somehow still messing with it.  I always use the desktop version then install unity - rather then use the UNE version.  best of luck man.
2011-01-03T00:13:00.000Z	aimio	ZykoticK9	i think i have a mouse issue, beacuse i tried to right click else where now that does not work. any ideas now ?..
