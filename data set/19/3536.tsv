2009-08-03T08:09:00.000Z	blognewb		Hi!
2009-08-03T08:10:00.000Z	blognewb		How do you set the PuTTy window always on top?
2009-08-03T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	there's a menu option for it (a checkbox somewhere in settings)
2009-08-03T08:14:00.000Z	blognewb	Flannel	there's none! :(
2009-08-03T08:14:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	in PuTTy?  Window > Appearances > Ensure Window is Always on Top (or something like that)
2009-08-03T08:15:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	I'm staring at it right now.

2009-08-03T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	Ah, so I did.
2009-08-03T12:18:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	"ls"
2009-08-03T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	esac is case backwards, that's how bash does closings
2009-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	er. please take offtopic stuff elsewhere, thanks.
2009-08-09T23:23:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	That's a gzip not a bzip, use z instead of j, see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression#Command%20Line%20Usage for more details
2009-09-09T09:06:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	Umbrello, or dia, or something like that
2009-09-09T09:07:00.000Z	blognewb	Flannel	I think i tried that before but im too dumb for that.. im trying OO right now O.o
2009-09-09T09:09:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	OOo draw should be fine, but dia might be easier.  You might also look into yEd, which is java based (but isn't in the repos)
2009-09-09T09:09:00.000Z	blognewb	Flannel	do you know where the magnetic arrows are located in oo? :DDDDD
2009-09-09T09:10:00.000Z	Flannel	blognewb	nope
