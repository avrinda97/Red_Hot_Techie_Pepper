2009-08-01T20:57:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	The very first user - the one created during installation - is in sudoers.
2009-08-01T20:58:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	.dmrc shouldn't remove sudo access.
2009-08-01T20:58:00.000Z	datacrusher	grawity	i bet it shouldnt
2009-08-01T20:59:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	Paste the output of 'id'
2009-08-01T20:59:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	Also, are you using the account created during install, or some other account?
2009-08-01T21:02:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	What does 'getent group admin' say?
2009-08-01T21:03:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	Strange... you'll probably need to reboot into the "Recovery mode", and then use this command: adduser cparzewski admin
2009-08-01T21:03:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	The 'recovery mode' will give you root access.
2009-08-01T21:06:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	There's a recovery mode option in the boot menu. Once you select it, you'll get another menu - which has 'root' option at the end.
2009-08-01T21:13:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	It is possible that your sudoers file, and probably other config files, have local hostnames in them.
2009-08-01T21:13:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	Without network, the system _still_ tries to resolve those hostnames, but fails.
2009-08-01T21:14:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	Can you check the output of 'hostname', 'hostname --fqdn', and the /etc/hosts file?
2009-08-01T21:14:00.000Z	grawity	datacrusher	There should be a line "127.0.0.1 abulafia" in /etc/hosts, then.
