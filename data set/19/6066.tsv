2008-04-06T01:28:00.000Z	ensi		why is ubuntu release cycle so fast? its in constant beta cycle :/
2008-04-06T01:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	We have a fast cycle in order to keep up with constant development in the OSS world.
2008-04-06T01:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	We dont' have any managers or marketers or strategests telling us what to develop and when, so everybody develops at their own speed and Ubuntu just packages it all up and delivers it to users.
2008-04-06T01:30:00.000Z	ensi		tbh, i dont get it why xorg and gnome folks are doing that too
2008-04-06T01:30:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	However, we have LTS releases for people who want a lower cycle, and there are other distros which focus primarily on stability and will give you a more dedicated slow-cycle experience.
2008-04-06T01:30:00.000Z	ensi	RyanPrior	yeah i had 6.06 lts, but the problem is you cant get new softare for it
2008-04-06T01:30:00.000Z	ensi		like i coudlnt get ff 2.x
2008-04-06T01:31:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	What do you want? A stable system with old software, or an unstable system with new software? The instability is because of new software.
2008-04-06T01:31:00.000Z	ensi		why cant the system be stable with new software? this is how windows works.'
2008-04-06T01:31:00.000Z	ensi		its not like every update to XP installed new version of shell for instance
2008-04-06T01:32:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	That's not how Windows works. Windows just lets third-party software update itself, so your system is as unstable as whatever apps you install want it to be.
2008-04-06T01:32:00.000Z	ensi		no, its been stable and unchanged for since the first release.
2008-04-06T01:32:00.000Z	ensi	RyanPrior	no, just the opposite
2008-04-06T01:32:00.000Z	ensi	RyanPrior	your system is stable but applications are what they are
2008-04-06T01:32:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	What is your "system", if not the applications?
2008-04-06T01:33:00.000Z	ensi	RyanPrior	the os and the shell (so for example linux kernel+base+gnome)
2008-04-06T01:33:00.000Z	ensi		but the gnome folks seem eager to be in a beta cycle all the time as well :)
2008-04-06T01:33:00.000Z	RyanPrior	ensi	I'm happy to try to answer the question you've got, but since it's off-topic for the software support channel, I'd like to take it into #ubuntu-offtopic - is that okay?
2008-04-06T01:33:00.000Z	ensi	RyanPrior	oh yeah sure
