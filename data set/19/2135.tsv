2011-02-25T05:02:00.000Z	ubuntu__		Hey guys, I got a problem. Some how I broke my linux install. I used it has a 'server' for making websites locally. I hvae backup of my projects files. But I can't find my 'databases' is there a place that it is stored. like phpmyadmin saving them so I can copy it to my flash drive before resinstall...?
2011-02-25T05:03:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	you have to mysqldump them first
2011-02-25T05:03:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	so with me not doing that i  lost my database?
2011-02-25T05:04:00.000Z	ubuntu__		I can't access the install I'm on live cd right now.
2011-02-25T05:04:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	you can't mount up the installed version to /mnt and then chroot /mnt ?
2011-02-25T05:05:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	yes, i can still access the files, it just don't boot
2011-02-25T05:05:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	No, I mean boot up to the cd, mount your installed version to /mnt and then chroot to /mnt.  I believe that will work, but you might have to install mysql on the livecd's instance first.
2011-02-25T05:08:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	I'm on live cd, I have installed mounted (I think i understand you there) I'm still new to the indept part of linux. Meaning I have live cd up, and access to the files.
2011-02-25T05:08:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	where is the hard drive mounted up?
2011-02-25T05:09:00.000Z	ed_moulton		Has anyone else been reading this?  Is what I'm telling ubuntu__ going to work?
2011-02-25T05:10:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	it has a bunch of numbers and letters
2011-02-25T05:10:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	type mount and see where it is
2011-02-25T05:11:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	dev/sda1
2011-02-25T05:11:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	and where is it mounted?  Here's something else you might check out.  http://www.mkyong.com/mysql/where-does-mysql-stored-the-data-in-my-harddisk/
2011-02-25T05:12:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	'mount' result for the installed is '/dev/sda1 on /media/87bf7098-7004-4577-965b-54aea9256e32 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks)'
2011-02-25T05:13:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	I'm checking out that link now.
2011-02-25T05:15:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	my first thought was to try sudo chroot /media/87bf7098-7004-4577-965b-54aea9256e32 and then run a mysqldump from there
2011-02-25T05:19:00.000Z	ubuntu__	ed_moulton	I will try
2011-02-25T05:19:00.000Z	ed_moulton	ubuntu__	I've got to go, but see if the chroot works and ask anyone in here about doing it.  You should be all set; I think I've done this before, but it was a while ago.
