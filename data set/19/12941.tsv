2005-07-25T09:21:00.000Z	devios		I got an urgent problem here (trying to meet a deadline).  I have an external hdd hooked up (usb2) that was automatically mounted under /media/usbdisk.  It has 50GB of individual email files and their associated attachments on it.  I am trying to tar -czvf ~/allmail.tar.gz /media/usbdisk/*, and it starts to read the external drive for a few seconds, then the console I issued the command in crashes/autocloses and no .tar.gz file is created.  I really need to
