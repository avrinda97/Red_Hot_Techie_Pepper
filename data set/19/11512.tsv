2006-08-22T14:04:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	it's this machine i'm doing it on now... it's only the shell that locks up
2006-08-22T13:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	have you read the man page?
2006-08-22T13:54:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	for what?!
2006-08-22T13:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	umount
2006-08-22T13:55:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	aah, i thought the -f switch did a similar thing to mount -f -o remount
2006-08-22T13:55:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	umount: /store: device is busy
2006-08-22T13:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	of course, you may still have troubles with hard vs soft interrupts (mount option for nfs)
2006-08-22T13:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	if so, try the other one with future mounts
2006-08-22T13:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	use one of those gui terminals, then you can hit that x in the corner
2006-08-22T13:57:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	yes, that's what i'm doing. what can i do now then?
2006-08-22T13:58:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	is hard mount default then?
2006-08-22T13:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	iirc, but it has been a while
2006-08-22T13:59:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	how annoying. is there anything i can do now apart from reboot?
2006-08-22T14:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	sadly, that was the only option i could find, back when
2006-08-22T14:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	change fstab if needed, for future mounts
2006-08-22T14:01:00.000Z	phatmonkey	eyequeue	i have many machines with this share open. ouch, this'll be a right pain
2006-08-22T14:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	"share" is what?
2006-08-22T14:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	yeah, hard mounts are not a wise default, imo, in this imperfect world
2006-08-22T14:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	phatmonkey	btw, they prevent timeouts if the machine only dies briefly ... can you ssh in and revive it?
