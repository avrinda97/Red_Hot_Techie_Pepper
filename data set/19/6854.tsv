2007-11-26T01:21:00.000Z	btard		Hey. I was told to install Vista then XP then Ubuntu if I wanted to triple boot. And that is what I did. However, now that I attempt to boot up the machine, it gives the grub boot loader with only vista as a choice, and when I choose vista the computer says missing hal.dll cannot continue. and I backed up up the hard drive before I installed Ubuntu.

2007-11-26T01:25:00.000Z	btard		I'm starting to think people are just ignoring me, cause I have been trying to get the irc working for an hour now
2007-11-26T01:25:00.000Z	btard		yeah.............
2007-11-26T01:26:00.000Z	btard		pardon?
2007-11-26T01:26:00.000Z	btard		I'm on a second comp
2007-11-26T01:26:00.000Z	soundray	btard	you're not saying what you want. People aren't ignoring you, it's just hard to answer that type of question.
2007-11-26T01:29:00.000Z	soundray	btard	that dll thing is a Windows problem. Ask in a Windows channel. To get a grub boot entry for XP, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add a boot entry for it. There is a sample for Windows at the top of the file.
2007-11-26T01:30:00.000Z	btard	soundray	ok i'll try that
2007-11-26T01:32:00.000Z	soundray	btard	make sure you add any new entry after the line that begins ### END DEBIAN AUTOMAGIC...
2007-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	soundray	btard	how do you mean "find"? You can enter 'echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to see if it's set.
2007-12-03T00:32:00.000Z	soundray	btard	then it's not set. You can set it for a shell session with 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/'
2007-12-03T00:33:00.000Z	soundray	btard	to set it system-wide, add a line to /etc/environment
2007-12-03T00:35:00.000Z	btard	soundray	I understand. I should have been doing that. I am going to try and find a precompiled version
2007-12-03T00:35:00.000Z	soundray	btard	version of what?
2007-12-03T00:36:00.000Z	btard	soundray	i am trying to install a "Crossplatform, Opensource, Ansi C++, Framework aimed to handle 2d and 3d Vector Graphic." because it is required for compiling a game I want to play
2007-12-03T00:36:00.000Z	btard	soundray	it is named Amanith
2007-12-03T00:37:00.000Z	soundray	btard	feel free to ask for help again if you can't find a precompiled version
2007-12-03T00:38:00.000Z	btard	soundray	ok thanks
