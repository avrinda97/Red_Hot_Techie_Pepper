2009-04-08T04:30:00.000Z	RedMushroom		how can i use the live cd to boot into a terminal?
2009-04-08T04:31:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	you can boot the cd normally, then press ctrl+alt+F1, or you could get into one by running the terminal app
2009-04-08T04:32:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	ctrl+alt+f1 does nothing
2009-04-08T04:33:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	in the live cd? try other ctrl+alt+Fsomethings
2009-04-08T04:33:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	yeah, live cd. ok, trying
2009-04-08T04:34:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	tried it, nothing for ctrl+alt+f1 - f12
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	hm... well i suppose you might be able to stop the X server, which should drop you to a terminal, but it would be easier to do whatever you need to do from a GUI terminal...
2009-04-08T04:35:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	how might i try that?
2009-04-08T04:36:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	killing the X server? Or using a GUI terminal?
2009-04-08T04:38:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	well there is a program that comes on all installs, and should definately be in on the live cd. Basically its a terminal that runs as a window. In gnome, its located at: Applications --> Accessories --> terminal
2009-04-08T04:39:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	I still dont understand why you need to...
2009-04-08T04:40:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	because i need to run the dd command on the hdd to reformat the bugger because it's got something messed up on it that won't allow the computer to boot properly from the hdd. it's an issue w/ a config file
2009-04-08T04:41:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	that  can be done from the GUI terminal... The GUI terminal is the same as the normal terminal just inside a GUI window
2009-04-08T04:42:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	i can't get to the GUI because the GUI is the part that's messed up
2009-04-08T04:42:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	the gui on the live cd
2009-04-08T04:42:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	but you should be able to kill the xserver in the live cd with this command: gksudo "/etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2009-04-08T04:42:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	when i try to load that it pulls info off the hdd and presents the same issu
2009-04-08T04:43:00.000Z	RedMushroom	stealth-	how can i input that command?
2009-04-08T04:43:00.000Z	stealth-	RedMushroom	ah! I see your issue now, if you cant even get into the livecd, try filo1234's method
