2005-07-07T06:52:00.000Z	tatiana		i'm on a laptop with an Yamaha OPLSynth sound card on it.  In other distros I used alsaconf to set up its sound but i can't seem to do that w/ubuntu in either XFCE or Gnome?
2005-07-07T06:54:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	explain the problem alittle more please. Any error msgs?
2005-07-07T06:56:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	do #sudo apt-get install alsaconf
2005-07-07T06:57:00.000Z	tatiana	vinux	is there another way to configure my soundcard by default other than installing alsaconf?
2005-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	well to tell you the truth on ubuntu it's installed for me when I go throught the install process. But on Slackware I had to use alsaconf
2005-07-07T07:01:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	you might need to install the alsa modules too
2005-07-07T07:06:00.000Z	tatiana	vinux	i tried to install alsaconf & it said alsa-utils was the most up to date.  tried to apt-get that but it wouldn't install it either... so i' going to try using synaptic i guess to install alsa.
2005-07-07T07:07:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	ok try that.
2005-07-07T07:38:00.000Z	tatiana	vinux	tried reinstalling alsa-utils & synaptic says its installed but i can't (even in a term window) get the program to run b/c it says its not there?
2005-07-07T07:40:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	b/c? I don't know what that is
2005-07-07T07:42:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	ahhh so you need alsaconf now right?
2005-07-07T07:43:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	hmmm wierd let me think
2005-07-07T07:49:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	hey try this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoundProblemsHoary
2005-07-07T07:55:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	oh ok hmmm let me see
2005-07-07T07:57:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	so does alsaconf supposed to come with the alsa-utilities? If not we need alsaconf it will take care of this problem.
2005-07-07T07:59:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	ok cool
2005-07-07T07:59:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	yep
2005-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	sudo apt-get install alsaconf?
2005-07-07T08:02:00.000Z	vinux	tatiana	hehe no biggie
