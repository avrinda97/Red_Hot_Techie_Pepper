2011-10-27T12:38:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	please don't offer random stuff, he's not even said he's doing virtualization stuff

2011-10-27T12:41:00.000Z	grendal-prime	ikonia	i dont like anything but lts..
2011-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	how will that fix it
2011-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	I've asked you not to push random stuff to people
2011-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	if you know it will remedy a problem, great, but just suggesting random things like "use LTS" or "use a server install" to fix a gnome 3 theme issue is not useful
2011-10-27T12:58:00.000Z	grendal-prime	ikonia	what should i look at doing in the future with the machien that i have..that will require gnome on them
2011-10-27T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	gnome3
2011-10-27T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	gnome 3 is available from 11.10 onwards, start planning for it
2011-10-27T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	no there is not
2011-10-27T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	please stop pushing stuff on people, if he doesn't use a vm, or doesn't need one, why are you telling him he will
2011-10-27T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	grendal-prime	help him with his problem,
