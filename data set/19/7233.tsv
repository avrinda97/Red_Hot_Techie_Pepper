2008-01-03T06:28:00.000Z	tuntun		what is stopping them from doing regular updates to the iso with the latest package versions?
2008-01-03T06:28:00.000Z	tuntun		I installed gutsy from cd yesterday and to my pleasant surprise there wasn't a whole slew of updates waiting for download. So are they doing regular updates to the iso now? I really hope so!
2008-01-03T06:30:00.000Z	tuntun		I looked at the iso date on the http site and it said it was updated jan2, so are they doing regular updates to the iso with the latest package versions?
