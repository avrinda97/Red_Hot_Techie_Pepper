2005-08-28T09:59:00.000Z	mindamp		what the hell
2005-08-28T09:59:00.000Z	mindamp		i know how to mount a damn drive
2005-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	mindamp		it was doogplus that asked
2005-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	mindamp		specific about what?
2005-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	mindamp		ive been trolling this channel for two days
2005-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	mindamp		and you finally answer me with someone elses stupid little solution?
2005-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	mindamp		pay attention
2005-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	mindamp		 i didn't ask any question
2005-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	mindamp		except about pop3
2005-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	mindamp		now on pop3... why the bloddy hell doesn't courier-pop3 work?
2005-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	erm, can you be more specific?
2005-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	it sounds like courier-pop3 isn't configured.
2005-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	ok, I presume you've gone through the standard courier-pop3 troubleshooting?
2005-08-28T10:06:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	for instance, the Gentoo docs
2005-08-28T10:12:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	this might be elementary, but I presume you've configured postfix to deliver to a user's Maildir?
2005-08-28T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	what are the home_mailbox and mailbox_command directives?
2005-08-28T10:29:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	the core Ubuntu developers are (with very few exceptions) all active Debian developers
2005-08-28T10:30:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	if you have a personal issue with it, you should direct that to ubuntu-devel
2005-08-28T10:31:00.000Z	crimsun	mindamp	I'm sure Matt, Fabio, Sebastian, Daniel, Scott, Lamont, James, etc. will be pleased to respond
