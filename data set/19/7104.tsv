2012-06-05T17:13:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	sudo du -hx --max-depth=1 /
2012-06-05T17:17:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	That disk usage report is not counting the space on your external drives
2012-06-05T17:18:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	looks like you've tried to copy over files to your external drive ... while it's not mounted
2012-06-05T17:18:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	hence it gets stored on / instead
2012-06-05T17:18:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	oh damn... that's it
2012-06-05T17:19:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	i have a cronjob running nightly to rsync to a drive that isn't mounted currently
2012-06-05T17:20:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	schnuffle: thanks a bunch
2012-06-05T17:20:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	add a test in that job; check for a file or directory that will only be there if the drive is mounted. Abort otherwise
2012-06-05T17:23:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	schnuffle: how do i find all those rogue files in / ?  i don't see them there
2012-06-05T17:24:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	sudo mkdir /tmp/mnt; sudo mount --bind / /tmp/mnt; find /tmp/mnt/media
2012-06-05T17:24:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	err, or just unmount the external drive like schnuffle says... easier :)
2012-06-05T17:27:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	i did run that command and a bunch of files showed up... can i just do a rm -rf /tmp/mnt/* to get rid of the extra files?
2012-06-05T17:27:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	or do i not even need to
2012-06-05T17:28:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	oh dear, no! /tmp/mnt is your /
2012-06-05T17:28:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	haha ok that's what i asked
2012-06-05T17:29:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	just unmount any filesystems mounted under /media, and delete from there
2012-06-05T17:29:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	ok
2012-06-05T17:37:00.000Z	ISOcrates	geirha	when i try umount /media/3TB-BACKUP, it says "umount: /media/3TB-BACKUP/: not mounted"
2012-06-05T17:38:00.000Z	geirha	ISOcrates	Then any files inside will be on /, not your external drive. Also  df -h   will list all mounted filesystems
