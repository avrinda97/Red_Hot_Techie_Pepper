2005-04-04T07:03:00.000Z	akk		Regular debian seems to use runlevels for gui/nongui (cmdline/x), but ubuntu apparently doesn't.
2005-04-04T07:04:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	debian does not.
2005-04-04T07:04:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	2-5 are identical
2006-11-17T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	Linux+udev.
2006-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	So if I need to add a script so that my cardbus network card gets ifup'ed, where would I put it?
2006-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	use interfaces(5)
2006-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	specifically, you need a pre hook.
2006-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	A pre hook like pre-up? The problem is that it's never set as "up" ...
2006-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	even with an auto line?
2008-05-23T02:24:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	what's the usb device id for your scanner?
2008-05-23T02:24:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	(from lsusb -v)
2008-05-23T02:25:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	0x04b8:0x011b
2008-05-23T02:25:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	(which is an Epson Perfection 2400 Photo)
2008-05-23T02:26:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	I tihnk there used to be a udev rule, but grep 011b /etc/udev/rules.d/* doesn't find anything
2008-05-23T02:31:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	sec, looking at LP.
2008-05-23T02:32:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	ok, that would be due to a change in the sane-backends source package.  The udev rules are no longer installed due to hal providing that info.
2008-05-23T02:33:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	hal doesn't seem to be doing it (I'm actually running hal right now, on this machine, though I usually disable it)
2008-05-23T02:33:00.000Z	crimsun	akk	so if your scanner is not working, please file a bug against the hal-info source package.
2008-05-23T02:34:00.000Z	akk	crimsun	Okay, will do (and for myself I guess I'll go copy my udev settings from gutsy, 'cause I'd rather have udev handling it anyway)
