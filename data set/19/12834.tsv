2005-09-14T09:19:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	usually when after an install there is no X started, it is a graphics card issue, I find.
2005-09-14T09:19:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	why does it have no access to the net?
2005-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	well, to test if he can see them as sudo, first...

2005-09-24T07:51:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	know about aptitude?
2005-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	sure, it uses apt-get. if you were to install a package with 5 deps, and then decide you dont want the package any more, and remove it using aptitude, aptitude will remove the dependencies it installed along with it, thus kkeeoping your system cleaner.
2005-09-24T08:13:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	use aptitude:)
2005-09-24T08:24:00.000Z	dabaR	BlueEagle	console? alt+ctrl+fnum? takes sudo as well as anything else.
