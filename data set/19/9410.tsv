2009-11-25T13:19:00.000Z	gonzoism		i run two iptables commands as root, and iptables --list shows nothing.  anyone know what the problem is ?
2009-11-25T13:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	are you sure you even need a firewall?
2009-11-25T13:22:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	yeah, i'm trying to set up masquerading for my Neo Freerunner. ;P
2009-11-25T13:24:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	I'm trying to run these two commands:  iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE    and    iptables -D POSTROUTING -t nat -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
2009-11-25T13:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	I'm well versed in iptables, I don't even run a firewall
2009-11-25T13:27:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	it isn't the firewall i'm wanting as much as the network address translation.  I've been running commands like these for ten years.  all of a sudden, it seems that iptables doesn't do anything....     i give the iptables command, get no error, and iptables --list shows no rules.
2009-11-25T13:27:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	kind of odd....
2009-11-25T13:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	Oh, yeah, that is odd. Do you have a router that does NAT?
2009-11-25T13:28:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	yes
2009-11-25T13:29:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	i've got a openwrt wireless router going at the other side of the house...
2009-11-25T13:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	So why not just let your router do the NAT and you won't have to mess with a firewall?
2009-11-25T13:29:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	because then I can't plug in my shiny new linux phone via usb and use the net over usb.
2009-11-25T13:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	Ah, ok
2009-11-25T13:30:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	it is one device i am trying to get to work.  i'm sure that i want to be doing this.
2009-11-25T13:31:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	any idea why iptables seems to be broken ?
2009-11-25T13:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	no idea, I don't know enough about it
2009-11-25T13:32:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	checking if i really needed was good.  it's just that i really do need it.
2009-11-25T13:32:00.000Z	gonzoism	ardchoille	thanks.
2009-11-25T13:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	gonzoism	in your case, yeah, you need it. But I don't have sufficient knowledge to be able to help, sorry
