2005-04-06T06:52:00.000Z	str_tux		anyone here having a good experience in OOo? Anyone can please help me?
2005-04-06T06:53:00.000Z	str_tux		hello
2005-04-06T06:54:00.000Z	str_tux		I'm trying to copy an image from a webpage
2005-04-06T06:54:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	I use OOo almost EVERY DAY! :) :)
2005-04-06T06:54:00.000Z	str_tux		but the image is not displaying
2005-04-06T06:55:00.000Z	str_tux		only a link to the image
2005-04-06T06:55:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	save it to your computer then import it
2005-04-06T06:55:00.000Z	str_tux		the problem is when ur reading ur docs offline image doesn't appear
2005-04-06T06:55:00.000Z	str_tux		but its not convenient saving the image and importing
2005-04-06T06:55:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	because the browser U R using doesn't copy the image data, just the link to it
2005-04-06T06:56:00.000Z	str_tux		no offense meant - but in MS Word it does
2005-04-06T06:58:00.000Z	str_tux		for example, i got a long, and many images documents from the net - its very convenient if i can simply copy-all and then paste it in OOo Writer
2005-04-06T06:58:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	it's perfectly convenient -- your m$ experience has made you lazy -- what logical reason does it serve to *copy* the data (in this case an image file but the concept applies to any file format) and store it inside the Open Office writer file??
2005-04-06T07:00:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	what happens when you want to use that same picture in a spreadsheet -- you would once again *copy* the data... in other words a copy of a copy --- it started as a low quality image in the first place (assuming JPEG) -- now I know we're not talking about losing data in this case but you wouldn't make a copy of a copy of a picture unless you were desperate...
2005-04-06T07:00:00.000Z	str_tux	drspin	well i got ur point - but again the time i need to do all those manual thing is not practical. if i can copy and paste it in two steps, that would be perfect.
2005-04-06T07:00:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	save... import... two steps :)
2005-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	LOL
2005-04-06T07:02:00.000Z	str_tux		how about u have for example 100 images in 1 web page? how long u gonna do the save and import thing?
2005-04-06T07:02:00.000Z	drspin	str_tux	there are tools that make that easy... wget in this case (type "man wget" at the command prompt)
