2011-02-22T20:23:00.000Z	Luis_		Hello, I'd like some help please, i've been trying to install ubuntu on my home file server (i'm not v good with terminal so i've been trying to install the desktop version) but every time i log in the screen just goes fuzzy/pixelated and it resets back to the login screen, i was advised here yesterday by somebody to reinstall unbutu, which i just did, well it looked good to start with as at first it loged in no problem, but
2011-02-22T20:23:00.000Z	Luis_		upon updating ubuntu and restarting as required it's gone back to doing the same, some help would be very much appreciated.
