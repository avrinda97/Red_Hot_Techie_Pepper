2011-01-03T08:13:00.000Z	blacksunseven		for whatever reason, my computer refuses to boot from usb with ubuntu server on it
2011-01-03T08:14:00.000Z	blacksunseven		is there a way to specify, in grub or ubuntu, to start the ubuntu 10.04 installer from the usb drive?
2011-01-03T08:16:00.000Z	blacksunseven		I've tried booting from USB first but no dice - I've done this before without issue but there seems to be some angst with Server 10.04
2011-01-03T08:17:00.000Z	blacksunseven		disabling all drives except the usb drive (which is recognized in bios)
2011-01-03T08:18:00.000Z	blacksunseven		for what its worth, unetbootin and usb-creator-gtk both encounter this problem
2011-01-03T08:19:00.000Z	blacksunseven		(on the same computer)
2011-01-03T08:19:00.000Z	blacksunseven		i'm getting the typical "invalid boot device, please insert bootable media etc etc"
2011-01-03T08:20:00.000Z	nit-wit	blacksunseven	do you know the per-session boot menu key prompt
2011-01-03T08:22:00.000Z	blacksunseven	nit-wit	you mean my bios boot menu? yeah i've tried that, no dice
2011-01-03T08:23:00.000Z	nit-wit	blacksunseven	no there is a out of the bios key prompt hit at boot as if going to the bios mine is f12 yours may be different
2011-01-03T08:23:00.000Z	blacksunseven	nit-wit	yeah, that's what i meant by boot menu
2011-01-03T08:23:00.000Z	nit-wit	blacksunseven	not in the bios
2011-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	blacksunseven	nit-wit	i assure you we're speaking about the same menu
2011-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	blacksunseven	nit-wit	i hit F10 for mine
2011-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	blacksunseven	there is the bios boot from menu and another one outside the bios
2011-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	blacksunseven	nit-wit	i know
2011-01-03T08:25:00.000Z	nit-wit	blacksunseven	cool

2011-01-03T08:25:00.000Z	blacksunseven	nit-wit	no, it's a mushkin
