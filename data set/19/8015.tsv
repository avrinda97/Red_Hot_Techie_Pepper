2007-07-21T10:57:00.000Z	stefg	vikzx86	what resolution are you running now?
2007-07-21T10:58:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	Its max resolution, 800x600 i think.
2007-07-21T10:59:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	I cant see the buttons on the setup box, the box is too big..
2007-07-21T10:59:00.000Z	stefg	vikzx86	see if you can set it to 1024x768 with the Screen setup applet in the system-settings menu
2007-07-21T11:00:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	How do i do it with the live cd?
2007-07-21T11:00:00.000Z	stefg	vikzx86	go to system-settings menu, choose screen resolution
2007-07-21T11:01:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	I have tried it, max resolution available is 800x600..
2007-07-21T11:01:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	How do i force a particular resolution?
2007-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	stefg	vikzx86	then you will have to install using the alternate CD. this runs in textmode
2007-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	before installation from the live cd..
2007-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	Is the text mode as simple as grapical mode?
2007-07-21T11:03:00.000Z	stefg	vikzx86	you get a couple of questions, but nothing to be scared of
2007-07-21T11:04:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	I am only worried about the hard drive partitioning part. Is it simple?
2007-07-21T11:04:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	I erased my hdd once..
2007-07-21T11:04:00.000Z	stefg	vikzx86	if you have a dedicated disk for ubuntu (no win on the same disk) there's a wizard doing it for you
2007-07-21T11:05:00.000Z	vikzx86	stefg	I got to install it to hdd having xp and vista installed..
