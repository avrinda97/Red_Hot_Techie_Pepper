2005-07-06T05:45:00.000Z	holycow		you can't just take ie out and reinstall/repair/etc. right?
2005-07-06T05:45:00.000Z	holycow		with linux, you can pull any component out, look at it, fix it, config it, etc.
2005-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	holycow		so a: windows is simply a poor set of tools
2005-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	holycow		but it also is b: a set of gui wizards that automate most basic tasks
2005-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	holycow		the consequence of b: is that people are tricked into thinking that its okay to be stupid and ignorant
2005-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	holycow		that you can operate something as complicated as an os with no training / learning /thinking at all
2005-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	holycow		and that simply is not true
2005-07-06T05:47:00.000Z	holycow		so yes, some windows users are put off by linux, primarily because they can no longer be lazy
2005-07-06T05:47:00.000Z	holycow		it's a combination of primarily those two that make microsoft a hazard to everyone
2005-07-06T05:47:00.000Z	holycow		otherwise its a company of some very smart and talented people
2005-07-06T05:48:00.000Z	rasputnik	holycow	but a lot of people just want to Get Things Done, don't they? I don't think it's fair to expect them to be gurus. M$ main failing is that they pretend you don't need to know anything
2005-07-06T05:49:00.000Z	holycow	rasputnik	then they shouldn't promise them the world, and lock the thing down
2005-07-06T05:49:00.000Z	holycow	rasputnik	as well, 'just works' and 'just get something done' is highly subjective
2005-07-06T05:51:00.000Z	rasputnik	holycow	I'm really talking about end users who just want a platform to run their life on, be it web/mail/doc editing or CAD
2005-07-06T05:51:00.000Z	holycow	rasputnik	exactly.  but thats just one workflow.
2005-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	rasputnik	holycow	but that's true in all OSes, isn't it? you can be clueless on any platform :)
2005-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	holycow	rasputnik	right exactly
2005-07-06T05:56:00.000Z	rasputnik	holycow	adminning apache or samba is a specialist skill, but so is using word, I can do the first two in my sleep but burst into tears trying to write a CV
2005-07-06T05:57:00.000Z	holycow	rasputnik	i think then we are probably saying the same thing
