2008-02-29T23:47:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	I made a thread there. I made it yesterday. I've just been bumping it, no replies really.
2008-02-29T23:48:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	I've also read all of the tutorials on doing this. I get an error. I've been trying to find someone to help me since yesterday without luck.
2008-02-29T23:48:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	what error?

2008-02-29T23:49:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	I pasted my configuration files in that thread, and the debug logs.
2008-02-29T23:56:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	Did you take a look at the thread? :x
2008-02-29T23:57:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	i took a look, but i cant really give you any insight on it since ive never had experience doing it
2008-02-29T23:57:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	Sucks.
2008-02-29T23:59:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	ask in #linux
2008-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	have you added wins to the host line of nsswitch.conf ?
2008-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	it appears its not finding the server, ive had issues liek that with samba by hostname, and adding wins has helped
2008-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	I added the "winbind" to the first two lines.
2008-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	add wins to the end of the host: line
2008-03-01T00:02:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	just add it to the end of the hosts line? My host line is like this "hosts:     files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4
2008-03-01T00:03:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	yes
2008-03-01T00:04:00.000Z	MasterShrak	blice	i dont know for sure if its going to work, but ive had problems resolving by hostnames before, and that helped (i thought it would be worth a shot since i noticed you installed winbind and i needed that for this too)
2008-03-01T00:04:00.000Z	blice	MasterShrak	Nah, I get the same error even with 'wins' at the end of the host line.
