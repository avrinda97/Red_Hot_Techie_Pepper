2008-11-18T15:43:00.000Z	fde	kanhiya78	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-keyring ... once that's installed, it should be fine to ignore it, I doubt you even know how to add other repos  ;)

2008-11-18T21:05:00.000Z	kanhiya78	fde	no ok button is there and my eyesight is not weak
2008-11-18T21:06:00.000Z	fde	kanhiya78	I didn't say it was... there should definitely be an ok button though.... what is your screen resolution?
2008-11-18T21:07:00.000Z	kanhiya78	fde	800x600
2008-11-18T21:08:00.000Z	fde	kanhiya78	so is it covering your entire screen? you can stretch the window off the screen... then right click the window title and hit 'move' to get to the bottom
2008-11-18T21:12:00.000Z	kanhiya78	fde	okay thanks, the ok button was not visible due to resolution
