2005-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	Randall64		hi
2005-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	Randall64		Wow!  I didn't have to register my ssn to speak on this network!
2005-05-04T07:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	Err, why would you have to do that?
2005-05-04T07:36:00.000Z	Randall64	Amaranth	It seems to be common enough on this network.
2005-05-04T07:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	You are spreading FUD.
2005-05-04T07:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	You mean for breezy?
2005-05-04T07:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	If it doesn't work in hoary there isn't much that can be done, hoary is frozen.
2005-05-04T07:50:00.000Z	Randall64	Amaranth	I mean for ubuntu.
2005-05-04T07:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	Sure, but we have different versions.
2005-05-04T07:51:00.000Z	Randall64	Amaranth	doesn't concern me atm
2005-05-04T07:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	Then you won't be finding much help.
2005-05-04T07:52:00.000Z	Randall64	Amaranth	Is there an ubuntu channel, where people might know about more than their favorite version?
2005-05-04T07:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	This is the Ubuntu channel for all versions. You haven't stated what version you're using so it's hard to even attempt to help.
2005-05-04T07:53:00.000Z	Randall64	Amaranth	Do I also need to tell you how large I plan to make my /boot filesystem?
2005-05-04T07:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	No, that isn't needed. Go ask someone for help with Windows 3.11 but just tell them you're using "Windows". Anything they tell you won't be helpful because they didn't know what version you were using.
2005-05-04T07:55:00.000Z	Randall64	Amaranth	All I want to know is if/ when multilib will appear in ubuntu.  The details aren't important.
2005-05-04T07:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	Anyway, hoary is stable so if something doesn't work there isn't much that can be done there. Someone is working on the i386 libs for breezy but afaik aren't there yet.
2005-05-04T07:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	Yes, in at least hoary.
2005-05-04T07:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	Randall64	Not sure about warty, I only ran it for 2 months and don't have an AMD64 machine.
