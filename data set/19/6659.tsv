2008-06-21T09:46:00.000Z	mixed		anybody knows of a website where I can learn more about ubuntu???
2008-06-21T09:47:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	get the linux from scratch book
2008-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	linux from scratch?  i want to be a little more specific, im using ubuntu
2008-06-21T09:49:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	what more about ubuntu do you want to learn?
2008-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	i want to learn the config directories, how modules get loaded, and how to change look and feel, etc.
2008-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	i don't think you can learn these technical details with ubuntu documentation
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	the pages that you just sent me can be a start, though, thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	most books and documents on ubuntu tell you the obvious stuff
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	get a more geeky distro
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	true, that is why i am opting for a website instead
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	get a linux book
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	i don't think i want to get geekier than i already am but thanks for the advice
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	get a life!
2008-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	scratch the last one
2008-06-21T09:54:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	life is an invalid operation
2008-06-21T09:54:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	here is my first project, how can i get create a restore point on ubuntu?
2008-06-21T09:55:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	i think you would need a sophisticated backup program for that.. i'm not a pro user myself
2008-06-21T09:55:00.000Z	dyf	mixed	or ask in ##linux
2008-06-21T09:57:00.000Z	mixed	dyf	thanks for the 411, I am off to read the websites you pointed me to
