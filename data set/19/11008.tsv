2006-04-12T09:20:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	consider repartition your drive with an additional FAT32 partition for sharing files b/w the 2 OSes
2006-04-12T09:20:00.000Z	George007	goofrider	I cant do that... I cant format my 160 GB HD, got nowhere to backup =)
2006-04-12T09:32:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	use apt-get
2006-04-12T09:32:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	and I think vsftpd is more secure  IIRC
2006-04-12T09:32:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	if it's in apt-get, use apt-get
2006-04-12T09:37:00.000Z	George007	goofrider	u got experience with vsftpd?
2006-04-12T09:38:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	no, just heard a few good things. I recommend avoiding FTP altogether, it's insecure
2006-04-12T09:38:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	SCP/SFTP via SSH should do everything that FTP can
2006-04-12T09:38:00.000Z	George007	goofrider	what do u recommend I use for file sharing with windows?
2006-04-12T09:38:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	Samba
2006-04-12T09:42:00.000Z	George007	goofrider	u cant put username/password on shared folders with samba, can you?
2006-04-12T09:44:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	go to the ubuntu wiki and read the Samba howto. Samba support user passwords
2006-04-12T10:57:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	just give them your cpp files and have then compile it in Visual C++   LMAO
2006-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	George007	goofrider	that's not an option
2006-04-12T11:03:00.000Z	goofrider	George007	real dev read docos

2006-04-12T11:12:00.000Z	George007	goofrider	I'll look into it
