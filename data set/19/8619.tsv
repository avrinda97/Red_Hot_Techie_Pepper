2010-12-15T15:52:00.000Z	AdvoWork		im trying to install 10.10 on a brand new laptop. Downloaded it, burnt it to dvd, and ive put it in the laptop, changed boot device priority but it just won't boot, any suggestions please?
2010-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	do any other bootable CDs/DVDs boot OK in that drive?
2010-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	just going to try that now, i may just install an old version and upgrade, same thing right?
2010-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	in theory, yes that's the same
2010-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	ymmv, and all that
2010-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	hmm, 9.10 boots
2010-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	AdvoWork		ill install that, then is it best to just do an upgrade from the update manager or?
2010-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	may want to try 10.04, since upgrading may not work as planned
2010-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	how come?
2010-12-15T15:56:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	too big of a version jump, IMO.  It may work, I just don't like to skip releases.
2010-12-15T15:57:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	dunno how ill do it, any reason it didnt work downloading and burning to dvd(10.10 i mean)
2010-12-15T15:58:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	did you check the md5/sha1 sum of the DVD ISO?
2010-12-15T15:58:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	yeah but the ubuntu site doesnt mention burning to dvd, only cd, so could that be the prob?
2010-12-15T15:59:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	is there a separate DVD ISO?  If not, it probably doesn't work because you've used a DVD
2010-12-15T16:01:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	am i able to install 10.10 from the 9.10 live cd?
2010-12-15T16:02:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	I really can't say, as I've never tried
2010-12-15T16:02:00.000Z	ectospasm		I went from 9.10->10.04->10.10, and had to install 10.10 from scratch because I hosed my LVM.
2010-12-15T16:02:00.000Z	AdvoWork	ectospasm	actually, found http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/10.10/release/ubuntu-10.10-dvd-i386.iso
2010-12-15T16:02:00.000Z	ectospasm	AdvoWork	use that to burn then
