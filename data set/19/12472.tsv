2009-09-16T04:44:00.000Z	dennygoot		guys i am back to square one. i made the authorization changes, but they last for one session. how do i make sane work without being root
2009-09-16T04:45:00.000Z	dennygoot		yeah ctrl + f
2009-09-16T04:46:00.000Z	dennygoot		i dont get why, if ubuntu, sane and xsane, and my hardware all work, why i cant use xsane unless im root...??
2009-09-16T04:47:00.000Z	dennygoot		i changed them, twice. i "have" permission... but i dont..??
2009-09-16T04:48:00.000Z	dennygoot		maybe i am setting the permissions wrong, where do i set them? i went to authorizations to do it, is this wrong?
2009-09-16T04:50:00.000Z	dennygoot		ok so how do i set permissions for sane, or xsane?
2009-09-16T04:50:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	the first time you ran XSane, did you run it as the root user?
2009-09-16T04:51:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	ls -la ~/.xsane
2009-09-16T04:53:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	ls -Rla ~/ | grep root
2009-09-16T04:57:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	so the problem is not that some XSane variable files are owned by root
2009-09-16T04:57:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	"which xsane" (no quotes)
2009-09-16T04:58:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	type it in a terminal
2009-09-16T04:58:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	is this Jaunty (9.04 or....)
2009-09-16T05:00:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	ls -a /usr/bin/xsane
2009-09-16T05:01:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	what are the permissions?
2009-09-16T05:04:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	OK, so everyone has the ability to launch XSane
2009-09-16T05:05:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	what happens if you just type "xsane" on the command line?
2009-09-16T05:06:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	but it works as root?
2009-09-16T05:07:00.000Z	mneptok	dennygoot	sounds like the entry in /dev for the scanner is owned by root
