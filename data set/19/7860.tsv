2008-04-03T16:14:00.000Z	knifepoint		Hey can anyone point me to a good tutorial to get cgi running in apache?
2008-04-03T16:14:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	what language cgi?
2008-04-03T16:15:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	c++ cgi
2008-04-03T16:15:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	testing a uni assignment at home so need apache to run the c++ cgi
2008-04-03T16:17:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	I didn't think there was anything special needed for compiled cgi executables other than being in the cgi folder and having +x permission
2008-04-03T16:18:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	hmmm well both the folder and file have +x permisions and its not running the program just coming up as a download
2008-04-03T16:19:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	is the file located in the folder designated for cgi scripts as defined in apache's conf file?
2008-04-03T16:20:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	didnt know it matter i just created a cgi-bin and slapped it in there ill go check the conf file now
2008-04-03T16:20:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	yup. Can't execute scripts just anywhere. :)
2008-04-03T16:21:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	well thats silly as if security is important :P
2008-04-03T16:23:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	let me know if that was it. hopefully the uni will teach python for cgi. You'll feel like your in heaven then. :)
2008-04-03T16:24:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	yeah we're hitting up perl for the next assignment so thats a step up
2008-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	perl is written by a linguist. It's ironic because it's unreadable after writing. :)
2008-04-03T16:27:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	yeah it does appear a little hacked up so many ways to do the same thing
2008-04-03T16:33:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	its not good if my httpd.conf file is empty right?
2008-04-03T16:41:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	Im gonna go sit in my corner now... i was testing the file on my desktop which wasn't on apache hence why it wouldnt open
2008-04-03T16:41:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	works fine now.... :P
2008-04-03T16:42:00.000Z	knifepoint	waylandbill	thanks for the help
2008-04-03T16:42:00.000Z	waylandbill	knifepoint	n/p
