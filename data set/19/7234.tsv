2007-10-14T05:41:00.000Z	Symian		Hi! I'm trying to install Ubuntu. I can't get my wireless internet to work.
2007-10-14T05:41:00.000Z	Symian		Can anyone help me with that?
2007-10-14T05:42:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	what card is it?
2007-10-14T05:42:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	I actually have two cards. One is a PCI ralink, using the ra2500pci chipset
2007-10-14T05:42:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	the one I would rather use is a usb ralink ra73usb.
2007-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	use the ralink
2007-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	both are recognized. Neither seems to be able to assosciate with ANY AP, whether they use encryption or not.
2007-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	they are both ralink.
2007-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	ok, I will. Any further advice?
2007-10-14T05:45:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	I'm staring at that interface now, and nothing seems to be working.
2007-10-14T05:45:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	restart
2007-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	restarting now.
2007-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	, ok
2007-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	is it back up?
2007-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	just up now.
2007-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	ok try it now
2007-10-14T05:49:00.000Z	super-6-1	Symian	now?
2007-10-14T05:49:00.000Z	Symian	super-6-1	ok! I have network! But, now for the nest step
