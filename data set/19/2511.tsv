2011-04-11T05:47:00.000Z	W43372		I'm hoping someone can help me. Every time I try to access the Public folder on my Ubuntu Laptop from my Windows Desktop it tells me I don't have permission
2011-04-11T05:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	on the ubuntu laptop point at the public folder and right mouse click > share
2011-04-11T05:48:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	Already did. No dice.
2011-04-11T05:50:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	When I go to publics properties and try to modify permissions tab it won't let me change the file access options. I change them and it sets it back to "---"
2011-04-11T05:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	well... sometimes it's a windows issue.. sometimes you have to dink around with samba on the ubuntu machine.  You could try.. sudo service smbd restart and sudo service nmbd restart and see if that helps.. It takes a couple/3 minutes for the network to realize the folder is there.
2011-04-11T05:52:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	Again, no dice.
2011-04-11T05:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	out of my league at this point..
2011-04-11T05:53:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	Ubuntu isn't letting me change the file access options in public properties. I change them and it instantly sets them back to blank
2011-04-11T05:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	create a new folder on the desktop and then share it as mentioned previously.  See if it can be seen on the other machines.
2011-04-11T05:57:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	Again, no dice.
2011-04-11T05:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	It hasn't been long enough for the network to catch up with the addition.........
2011-04-11T05:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	it's not instant
2011-04-11T05:57:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	I can see the folder it just tells me to bugger off after I try to open it on the other box
2011-04-11T05:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	well that's different.... at least it's visible
2011-04-11T05:58:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	That's what the issue has been, and I can't change the permission properties on the public folder
2011-04-11T06:02:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	\\viper\public is not accessible. You Might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. Network path was not found. :(
2011-04-11T06:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	W43372	like I said.. beyond my expertise.. sorry
2011-04-11T06:06:00.000Z	W43372	Scunizi	Don't I need to poke around in smb.conf and add the winbox name and ip address somewhere for it to work?
