2009-10-18T23:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	yes
2009-10-18T23:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	ls /boot/grub/*stage*
2009-10-18T23:46:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	ohh! thanks
2009-10-18T23:47:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	so if i changed the physical location of stage2, stage1 couldnt find it, but after that it can read the fs, right?
2009-10-18T23:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	grub does not depend on anything being on a fixed disk sector like lilo
2009-10-18T23:48:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	not even stage2??
2009-10-18T23:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	no afaik
2010-02-04T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	dpkg -S /path/to/file
2010-08-06T03:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	becouse it is cool to say that you have a patch in the kernel ;P
2010-10-07T19:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	use a tool to convert them to a standar format like mbox. then import them in your mail client
2010-10-07T19:37:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	like what tool?
2010-10-07T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	what may people do is installing mozilla thunderbird in windows. import the oulook mail to it. then copy the mbox files tb uses to the linux partition

2010-10-07T19:46:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	"Simply export your Outlook mail into a pst file."   isnt that the format outlook stores them in anyway?
2010-10-07T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	dunno; never touched  that *@@@#Â½  ~@@##! (insert something awfull here) that is  outlook :)
2010-10-07T19:50:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	yeah, i have a client who's going down the classic path that i keep trying to warn him about.. 'converting' to linux by trying to A) dual boot, and B) use all the old propriatary formats from win.. in the end he's going to hate me and want his money back becaues linux isnt windows ;)
2010-10-07T20:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	kermit	i dunno
2010-10-07T20:18:00.000Z	kermit	erUSUL	phil_in_london: Evolution tried to import the pst file from outlook, but it put all the archived mail in the Tasks folder, and the client said he had more than the number of emails it mentioned.
