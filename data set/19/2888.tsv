2009-12-02T23:08:00.000Z	jiggahuu	havocspartan	use ifconfig -a  OR iwconfig to find out iface name
2009-12-02T23:10:00.000Z	havocspartan	jiggahuu	thats my lan settings is it not? im currentl wireless and have a modem set up for wep cracking practice
2009-12-02T23:10:00.000Z	jiggahuu	havocspartan	those are your interface names
2009-12-02T23:11:00.000Z	havocspartan	jiggahuu	correct my wireless name is eth1.
2009-12-02T23:12:00.000Z	jiggahuu	havocspartan	your wireless name is eth1? lol
2009-12-02T23:14:00.000Z	havocspartan	jiggahuu	haha i know that was default. im using backtrack 4 and didnt bother changing it. iwconfig says lo no wireless extension, eth0 no wireless coneection and eth1 has ieee , essid, and all the data
2009-12-02T23:14:00.000Z	jiggahuu	havocspartan	yeah backtrack4 does have a weird naming scheme
