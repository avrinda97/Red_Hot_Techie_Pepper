2008-04-27T05:21:00.000Z	MrDoug		hey im having a problem installing ubuntu mabye you can help,  I got a live cd and it works and even passes the errror check, but it just will not install.  I always get an input output error
2008-04-27T05:21:00.000Z	MrDoug		btw this is 8.04 AMD64
2008-04-27T05:22:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	what type of coumputer u have Intel Core 2 or is it an older amd64 processor
2008-04-27T05:24:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	hmm I don't know that much about 64-bit the I/O error could be anything
2008-04-27T05:25:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	it might
2008-04-27T05:27:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	or your live cd iso could have went bad during download it's possible
2008-04-27T05:28:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	oh and go get wine from http://www.winehw.org
2008-04-27T05:31:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	and are u installing ubuntu to a partition or a second hard
2008-04-27T05:31:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	Hard Drive**
2008-04-27T05:32:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	are you running a windows install as well?
2008-04-27T05:33:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	well ok I have found a way to make a grub floppy and cd
2008-04-27T05:35:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	well I have made a guide that can help create a personal grub floppy or CD without messing with the MBR
2008-04-27T05:36:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	I mainly made it for people who don't want to screw with windows being on the MBR since my windows install is the first HD
2008-04-27T05:37:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	so if you use windows alot and want to try linux without GRUB being in the MBR thats what I mainly made it for
2008-04-27T05:38:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	I will have to send it you but it needs to be worked on more
2008-04-27T05:39:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	and I did this while using the live CD
2008-04-27T05:43:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	it needs to be made to look extremely simple to do plus needs to be edited to use the new iso maker in hardy
2008-04-27T05:43:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	I originally made this using Gutsy
2008-04-27T05:48:00.000Z	Shadow420	MrDoug	well just in case u put windows back on the first HD you can create a Grub Boot Disk so your MBR if have windows on first HD grub won't install onto the MBR of the first HD
