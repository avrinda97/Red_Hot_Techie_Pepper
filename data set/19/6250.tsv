2008-02-18T14:11:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	for a while only
2008-02-18T14:54:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	Ubuntu restricted extras have anything to do with g0th's problem you think?
2008-02-18T14:54:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	that is what i was thinking yah
2008-02-18T14:54:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	Remind me to go easy on ctrl-C
2008-02-18T14:55:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	hehe
2008-02-18T14:55:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	Either that or a plugin from medibuntu??
2008-02-18T14:56:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	It works for me and I don't remember installing that plugin....
2008-02-18T14:57:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	so you only have the restricted-extras installed
2008-02-18T14:57:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	Yeah, it solved a problem with my watching .avi's I believe
2008-02-18T15:06:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	Yes it can
2008-02-18T15:08:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	since when did it generate its own pw?
2008-02-18T15:10:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	there has to be a root account setup doesn't there, otherwise how do you run files as a root user?
2008-02-18T15:10:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	With sudo
2008-02-18T15:11:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	From my understanding sudo gives you root power without using the root account
2008-02-18T15:11:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	so do you mean if I set up a user beyond the first one I made, all they have to do is type sudo <command> and their own password and they have root access to my system?
2008-02-18T15:12:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	I don't think user accounts have sudo rights by default, it would probably be worth experimenting with though
2008-02-18T15:12:00.000Z	ph0rensic	BlueKoala	prince_jammys Oh I see, but by default the first account IS admin and others are not
2008-02-18T15:12:00.000Z	BlueKoala	ph0rensic	I think you're on the right track
