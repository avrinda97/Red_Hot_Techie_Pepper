2012-01-19T18:26:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	what brand of laptop?
2012-01-19T18:34:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	sorry for the late reply have been trying to find a fix, none found yet. My brand of laptop in an Acer Aspire 3733Z.
2012-01-19T18:35:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	no worries.. I'm assuming the hardware keys don't do anything? and the brightness setting somewhere in the settings dialog doesn't do anything either?
2012-01-19T18:36:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	Nope, the ALT+left/right keys will show the widget for brightness being changes, but do not change it, nor does the slider in 'screen'
2012-01-19T18:37:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	are you sure the model is Acer Aspire 3733Z. I get no hits at all on google for that
2012-01-19T18:38:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	sorry, 5733Z, new keyboard layout, trying to get used to it still ;p
2012-01-19T18:39:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	ah.. I get more hits now.. I'll be back in a minute
2012-01-19T18:39:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	i have looked on google i have tried multiple things, like changing the 'setpci' and none have seemed to work as of yet
2012-01-19T18:40:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	tried this one? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1620063
2012-01-19T18:42:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	No, not yet. that was going to be my last method, im not fond of editing files i dont know what they do, if this file safe to edit? in your opinion?
2012-01-19T18:44:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	well.. grub handles the loading of ubuntu at the very start.. it's a pretty important system.. but also quite easy to fix if you've got a live cd/live usb around.. and you can always undo that change that is mentionded when booting
2012-01-19T18:44:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	so I wouldn't be afraid of editing that file, no
2012-01-19T18:45:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	Ok, just edited the line, still no change, should i try a reboot or should it be working?
2012-01-19T18:46:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	yes.. that change won't take effect until you reboot
2012-01-19T18:46:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	Ok, i will be back ;p
2012-01-19T18:46:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	good luck =)
2012-01-19T18:49:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	I'm no longer being blinded, thanks for the help
2012-01-19T18:49:00.000Z	Slart	Pseudoephedrine	it worked? great!
2012-01-19T18:50:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	Slart	It sure did! Thanks again
