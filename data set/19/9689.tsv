2006-12-08T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	did you install it through package management? (the java package from the repositories?)
2006-12-08T10:50:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	no
2006-12-08T10:51:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	I used this http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_JRE_v5.0_Update_10
2006-12-08T10:52:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	use the wiki, not ubuntuguide.  And, java has a package, it does it all for you.
2006-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	you'll get whatever feature enhancements are in v10, but you'll lose all the benefits of package management.  Just like all software
2006-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	ok I see thx
2007-02-22T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	it's still not 100% safe
2007-02-22T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	corruption
2007-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	as an alternative, would a FAT32 partition allow me to transfer files between ntfs and ext3
2007-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	actually, I stand corrected.  Looks like they released a "stable" version today.
2007-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	no idea what their definition of "stable" is though
2007-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	I saw the word stable on their site but wondered what that meaned exactly
2007-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	Only they'd know.  Well, they might have info on the site
2007-04-17T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	the amount of packages on them
2007-04-17T11:37:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	but installation should be relatively the same?
2007-04-17T11:37:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	yeah, as far as I know.
2007-05-04T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	/var/cache/apt/archives has the debs.  but, "dpkg -l" will print all your currently installed packages
2007-05-04T10:18:00.000Z	seamus7	Flannel	i was thinking of copying the debs into by /home folder and then once i reinstall feisty using them to quickly reinstall all the programs again ... rather than downloading them all again ... does this make sense and will it work?
2007-05-04T10:19:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7	yeah, you can do that
