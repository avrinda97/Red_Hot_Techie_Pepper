2006-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntu		good
2006-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntu		can u install ubuntu onto harddrive from a live cd?
2006-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	Have you tried yet? If you have a problem what is it?
2006-06-01T08:46:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	If you see a HD install icon in the CD then you can. If not then you have the "old" version
2006-06-01T08:47:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	Ubuntu will see windows and ask if you want to shrink it to make room for Ubuntu (you need free space in Wndows in order to shrink it) then you get a choice when you boot for windows or ubuntu
2006-06-01T08:48:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	It is much easier to set up with Dapper though, as it has graphics (Breezy install CD is text-based)
2006-06-01T08:49:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	You cannot install from breezy livecd (like you have), it is not hidden away, it is not there
2006-06-01T08:50:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	If you download the Dapper cd you will not be able to save it if you use windows xp (linux cannot write to ntfs partitions) unless you save it to a usb drive or something
2006-06-01T08:50:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	I mean from within the LiveCD
2006-06-01T08:52:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	Yes, just read what it tells you carefully (it is a big step, installing an OS)
2006-06-01T08:53:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	Yep, it uses gparted I think (to shrink windows/create Linux partitions)
2006-06-10T06:16:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	Last time I checked
2006-06-10T06:17:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	(Well, last time I checked Dapper had newer drivers than when I checked on nvidia.com last :))
2006-08-17T10:39:00.000Z	ubuntu	Warbo	 oops sorry
2006-08-20T16:51:00.000Z	ubuntu	Warbo	yes try that
2006-08-30T05:42:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	It should appear as a desktop icon. If not try Places>Computer
2006-08-30T05:43:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	http://tldp.org is useful. But Ubuntu help is on http://help.ubuntu.com/community
2006-10-21T14:07:00.000Z	Warbo	ubuntu	"sudo mount <devicename> <mountpoint> -o uid=ubuntu" where you can find <devicename> from System>Admin>Discs
