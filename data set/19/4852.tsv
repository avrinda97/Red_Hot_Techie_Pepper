2008-10-25T04:57:00.000Z	stinkman		firing a mount command, i get this "mount.nfs: mount to NFS server 'rpcbind' failed: RPC Error: Program not registered"   already installed nfs-common, what else?
2008-10-25T04:58:00.000Z	favro	stinkman	portmap is necessary
2008-10-25T04:58:00.000Z	stinkman		nfs-common installed portmap and the service is running?
2008-10-25T04:58:00.000Z	stinkman		Setting up portmap (6.0-4) ...
2008-10-25T04:58:00.000Z	stinkman		 * Starting portmap daemon...                                            [ OK ]
2008-10-25T04:59:00.000Z	stinkman		reason i'm here, nfs-common didin't fix my problem :)
2008-10-25T05:00:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	says portmap is already the newest version.
2008-10-25T05:01:00.000Z	favro	stinkman	I don't use rpc..
2008-10-25T05:01:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	techincally, it's for nfs
2008-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	mount -t nfs x.x.x.x:/path
2008-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	favro	stinkman	you have portmap on the server and client?
2008-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	stinkman		server doesn't seem to give the problems, client is.
2008-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	server is freebsd, been untouched for months. this ubutnu is a clean install.
2008-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	favro	stinkman	is the server hostname in /etc/hosts?
2008-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	never needed it lasttime, i suppose it's a shot...ping works
2008-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	btw, it also says mount.nfs: internal error
2008-10-25T05:06:00.000Z	stinkman	favro	added it to /hosts, no progress
2008-10-25T05:06:00.000Z	favro	stinkman	you prob have to restart the network
2008-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	favro	stinkman	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
