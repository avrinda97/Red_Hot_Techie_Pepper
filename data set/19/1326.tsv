2011-02-26T14:31:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	does this help? http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.32/
2011-02-26T14:31:00.000Z	RodJenson		These are ppa's, so they can be installed the way you'd do something with synaptic?
2011-02-26T14:32:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	they're debs, it should work fine
2011-02-26T14:33:00.000Z	RodJenson	tobier	sacarlson: Very good :D I thought there was something like that since the kernel upgrades always come through debs
2011-02-26T14:33:00.000Z	RodJenson		Thank you
2011-02-26T14:34:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	pretty much first result on google ;)
2011-02-26T14:34:00.000Z	RodJenson	tobier	sacarlson: I'm to install the header and the image that both fir my architecture, correct?
2011-02-26T14:35:00.000Z	RodJenson		Hah, here I was already looking up compiling howto's :/
2011-02-26T14:35:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	sounds like a good idea
2011-02-26T14:35:00.000Z	RodJenson		Excellent
2011-02-26T14:35:00.000Z	RodJenson		Thank you very much :D
2011-02-26T14:35:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	I'm not sure youy need the headers if not compiling thou
2011-02-26T14:36:00.000Z	tobier		*if you're not
2011-02-26T14:37:00.000Z	RodJenson		Probably won't be compiling any custom drivers, but I'll go ahead and get the headers anyway. May as well.
2011-02-26T14:37:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	if you check http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ there are a bunch of other kernels that may or may not be more up-to-date but still 2.6.32
2011-02-26T14:40:00.000Z	RodJenson		While I'm here, I was going to boot back into gnome, but does anybody know a Software Center alternative for Fluxbox?
2011-02-26T14:40:00.000Z	RodJenson		Or would GDebi work?
2011-02-26T14:46:00.000Z	RodJenson	tobier	One more thing. My architecture is apparently i686. I assume that I can also use the i386 deb, but is it that one or the "all" I should be getting?
2011-02-26T14:47:00.000Z	tobier	RodJenson	i386 and i686 us pretty much interchangeable
