2010-09-28T19:52:00.000Z	cordoval		it would be great for people who develop sites and have a server running on local and a server running on the live server within the shared hosting account
2010-09-28T19:52:00.000Z	cordoval		filezilla will not be needed after this step is completed
2010-09-28T19:52:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 you could write a cron job to check on it periodically if you can't run daemontools
2010-09-28T19:54:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 just set a job to launch every few minutes, check for presence of dropbox running instance.
2010-09-28T19:56:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 i don't mean to discourage, but hosting may not allow some things to run, esp. those requiring kernel access.
2010-09-28T19:58:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 not if you check for presence of running instance before launching.
2010-09-28T19:59:00.000Z	cordoval	bobstro	yes because the python thing is a script which will not run it twice, it will run it if it is down
2010-09-28T20:01:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 not criticizing. i use something similar.
2010-09-28T20:01:00.000Z	cordoval	bobstro	something similar? what do you mean?
2010-09-28T20:02:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 i have a vps server hosted. i can get root, and do most things, but not kernel-level things such as iptables. it's a limitation of the service (and presumably the technology).
2010-09-28T20:03:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 i used pidof to monitor a server (not dropbox), yes.
2010-09-28T20:04:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 is the service hanging or dying? does it show in ps output?
2010-09-28T20:04:00.000Z	cordoval	bobstro	does pidof have the same capabilities than dropbox?
2010-09-28T20:04:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 pidof lets you easily check to see if a program is running.
2010-09-28T20:04:00.000Z	cordoval	bobstro	when it falls it does not show up on ps
2010-09-28T20:05:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 ok, read up on pidof. you can use it in a script to check whether dropbox is running or not.
2010-09-28T20:05:00.000Z	bobstro	cordoval	 does that make sense?
2010-09-28T20:06:00.000Z	cordoval	bobstro	yes, I will get back to you soon
2010-09-28T20:06:00.000Z	cordoval	bobstro	thanks a lot for your insight
