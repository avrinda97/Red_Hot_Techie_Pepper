2007-05-15T10:33:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		is anyone else here having problems with Flash content in Firefox?
2007-05-15T10:33:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	what kind of problems?
2007-05-15T10:35:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	it almost seems like the Flash content is in a layer that floats over everything else....dropdown menus will dissapear behind it, I'm getting large swaths of text surrounding it that vanish.....
2007-05-15T10:35:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	weird, I've never heard of anything like that.  All flash messed up for me was sound.
2007-05-15T10:36:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	like some large blank border surrounding the content, covering over the text that should be there
2007-05-15T10:36:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	I'm getting used to that....I'll have these problems that keep repeating, and nobody else seems to have them....weird indeed :)
2007-05-15T10:37:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	I notice, though, that when I run the Windows version of Firefox under Wine, I don't have any of those problems
2007-05-15T10:39:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	I'm not going to lie, I'm quite disappointed with Firefox on Linux.  For me when I was using 32-bit , Firefox seriously crashed 1/4 sessions, specially around flash websites.  Now I'm using swiftweasel and it runs great
2007-05-15T10:46:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	looking at the available .deb files for swiftweasel, is the m after pentium 3 and 4 for mobile versions?
2007-05-15T10:48:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	not sure, go ahead and try, is there any other version besides the ones with the 'm' at the end?
2007-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	I see versions ending pentium3.deb, pentium3m.deb, pentium4.deb, and pentium4m.deb
2007-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	what processor you got?
2007-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	I'm actually using a Celeron M.....hmm, guess that means the M IS for mobile versions :)
2007-05-15T10:53:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	probably
2007-05-15T11:08:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	anything tricky about getting Flash to run in Swiftweasel?  just put a link to the .so and .xpt files in the swiftweasel plugins folder?
2007-05-15T11:09:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	I didn't need anything extra, just worked ... I thin it uses the firefox folders
2007-05-15T11:09:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	ok, because about:plugins in Swift Weasel isn't showing that as being installed
2007-05-15T11:10:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	LuisGMarine	nope, it appears not to be seeing it
2007-05-15T11:11:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	Geoffrey2	hmm try copying it over, I'm using 64-bit Ubuntu so I had a script to automatically move all those things around :
