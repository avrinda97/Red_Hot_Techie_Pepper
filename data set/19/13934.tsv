2004-12-10T07:30:00.000Z	rory__		<wezzer> I changed runlevel to 3 at /etc/inittab
2004-12-10T07:30:00.000Z	rory__		<wezzer> but still gdm starts
2004-12-10T07:30:00.000Z	rory__		yep
2004-12-10T07:31:00.000Z	rory__		the runlevel setup in ubuntu is stupid
2004-12-10T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	no it's not
2004-12-10T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	if you want non-default behaviour, change it
2004-12-10T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	you have granularity.  you're welcome to make runlevel 3 do whatever you want.
2004-12-10T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	what's missing?
2004-12-10T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	that's a bug in whoever made those php5 packages
2004-12-12T15:59:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	no
2004-12-12T16:31:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	vmware doesn't provide ubuntu packages?
2004-12-12T16:32:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	um, vmware isn't in ubuntu
2004-12-12T16:32:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	isn't that non-free, too?
2004-12-12T16:35:00.000Z	rory__	bob2	no idea what the license of the vmware tools is
2004-12-12T16:36:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	I'm pretty sure it's not distributable
2004-12-12T16:36:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	yes
2004-12-12T16:36:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	but stuff at least has to be distributable
2004-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	rory__	bob2	found a page with instructions for ubuntu on vmware
2004-12-20T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	rory__	he/she means 2.6.9
