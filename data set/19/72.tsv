2012-10-25T21:18:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		I installed ehcp and put my new site up. when i go to that ip I get the login for ehcp
2012-10-25T21:19:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		if i wanted to clear out the var/www    but not mess up  my  ehcp      whats the best way to do that?
2012-10-25T21:20:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		http://www.ehcp.net/
2012-10-25T21:20:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		no ehcp
2012-10-25T21:22:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		I dont actually see anything from ehcp in my var/www
2012-10-25T21:24:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		no, when i go to  www.mtsite.com I go to my index.html        when i go to my IP I get my panel to login to echp
2012-10-25T21:25:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		but when I ssh into my server, I see all bunch of crap from my old site before i set up ehcp. and cant find my new stuff
2012-10-25T21:26:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		sudo delete files?
2012-10-25T21:27:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		what is the command line to do a full search on the system to find my new site? I forgot
2012-10-25T21:27:00.000Z	XMLnewbi		just search the whole system for a file
2012-10-25T21:27:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	usually a website is stored in the www folder
2012-10-25T21:28:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	either 'locate' or 'find' command
2012-10-25T21:28:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	locate is the easier one to use
2012-10-25T21:28:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	i assume you use command line
2012-10-25T21:29:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	that's because you have to tell it to look in / and not in your current dir
2012-10-25T21:31:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	find / -name XXX
2012-10-25T21:31:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	i don't know how deep ls will enter to your file hirachy
2012-10-25T21:32:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	try 'ls -R / | grep XXX'
2012-10-25T21:37:00.000Z	nabblet	XMLnewbi	:)
