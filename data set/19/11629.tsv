2005-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	DonC_82		hi guys. i use the mail-program evolution. can anyone tell me how i can export the contacts?
2005-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	save them in vcard format. Most other programs can import vcards.
2005-12-18T10:03:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	and can i import the vcards in evolution a later time?
2005-12-18T10:03:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	yes.
2005-12-18T10:04:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	nice, thank you. and is a export of the emails possible to?
2005-12-18T10:06:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	I think Evolution stores mail in standard mbox format, with extensions in separate files. You can open mboxs with, e.g. mutt -f
2005-12-18T10:08:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	i'm only a linux-beginner. i've never heard of mbox before. does it mean, the mails are stored on a central place? independent from the mail-program?
2005-12-18T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	the mbox-formatted mail file is in some folder (directory) that evolution accesses.
2005-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	you can copy it elsewhere and access.
2005-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	tied up right now, but I'll have a look later.
2005-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	ok, but how can i find out where this directory is?
2005-12-18T10:16:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	still here?
2005-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	it seems that evolution stores its mail in /home/(yourname)/.evolution/mail/local -- check it out.
2005-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	ok. thx !
2005-12-18T10:20:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	if i open my filemanager, i can't see a directory named "evolution" in my /home/(myname)-directory
2005-12-18T10:21:00.000Z	soundray	DonC_82	you have to tell the file manager to show hidden files, and look for .evolution
2005-12-18T10:21:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	ok, i'm using nautilus. how can i tell it?
2005-12-18T10:22:00.000Z	DonC_82	soundray	ah, i get it
