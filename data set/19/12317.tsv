2005-09-22T09:13:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	imwheel hasn't been needed for a long time. :)
2005-09-22T09:13:00.000Z	flyingpenguin	kriptic13	then how do you think I should get my microsoft mouse to work?
2005-09-22T09:14:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	Is it just your mouse wheel that isn't working? Or are there other buttons involved?
2005-09-22T09:14:00.000Z	flyingpenguin	kriptic13	side to side scrooling/back and foword buttons
2005-09-22T09:15:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	the secret lies in setting up the mouse inputdevice section of xorg.conf.
2005-09-22T09:15:00.000Z	flyingpenguin	kriptic13	hold on let me start irc in my gui
2005-09-22T09:16:00.000Z	flyingpenguin		ok... its starting
2005-09-22T09:16:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	I don't have the same mouse that you do, obviously.... so it will probably be just a bit different for you....
2005-09-22T09:17:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	no, but I do have a 12-button multimedia mouse.  :)
2005-09-22T09:18:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	hold on a sec... need to remember what I did.... :)
2005-09-22T09:24:00.000Z	kriptic13	flyingpenguin	I've been PM'ing you back.  :)
