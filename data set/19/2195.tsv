2010-07-07T16:01:00.000Z	shomon		anyone know how to force apt to install a package regardless of errors in other packages?
2010-07-07T16:02:00.000Z	shomon		ah cool thanks
2010-07-07T16:03:00.000Z	shomon		any idea how to force it to remove a package? it's a notorious one - flgrx
2010-07-07T16:03:00.000Z	shomon		fglrx I mean
2010-07-07T16:04:00.000Z	shomon		when removing `diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2 to /usr/lib/fglrx/libGL.so.1.2.xlibmesa by fglrx'
2010-07-07T16:04:00.000Z	shomon		it finds some other thing
2010-07-07T16:04:00.000Z	shomon		so it can't remove it, and hence doesn't let anything new get installed
2010-07-07T16:05:00.000Z	shomon		the whole remove-fglrx error message is here: http://pastebin.ca/1895967
2010-07-07T16:07:00.000Z	shomon		ouch KungFuBear
2010-07-07T16:07:00.000Z	shomon		can you launch X somehow?
2010-07-07T16:08:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	Well actually I as getting some kind of error message during boot about X
2010-07-07T16:08:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	but I have no idea what X is or how to launch it
2010-07-07T16:08:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	ok, just a sec
2010-07-07T16:15:00.000Z	shomon	KungFuBear	you could try "/etc/init.d/gdm start"
2010-07-07T16:15:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	I'll try that now
2010-07-07T16:17:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	"Job is already running: gdm"
2010-07-07T16:17:00.000Z	shomon	KungFuBear	you could try plressing ctrl-alt-f7 or f8
2010-07-07T16:17:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	but...I've tried CTRL+ALT [F1-F8]...
2010-07-07T16:18:00.000Z	KungFuBear	shomon	in F7 and F8 its just a blank screen with a flashing cursor in the top left that '\r\n
