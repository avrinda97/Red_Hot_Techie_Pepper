2006-09-22T06:36:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	that doesn't work, its openssh-server or openssh-client
2006-09-22T06:37:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	isn't there some dependency thing in dapper that brings them both in? it worked on my last installation on saturday
2006-09-22T06:37:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	i don't think so, can't remember
2006-09-22T06:37:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	i think if you install openssh-server it installs the client
2006-09-22T06:39:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	maybe thats it
2006-09-22T06:40:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	I just remember  reading in someones howto and thought, hmm he didn't seem to install openssh-server
2006-09-22T06:40:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	well, they must have though wrong, cause it doesn't work, i just tried it and it doesn't find a package named ssh, its openssh-(client or server)
2006-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	my response was    ssh is already the newest version.
2006-09-22T06:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	sudo apt-cache depends ssh
2006-09-22T06:44:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	i know, but if you run sudo apt-get install ssh, it says it doesn't exsist
2006-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	maybe you need to add multiverse and universe to your repositories
2006-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	nvm, they must have changed that
2006-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	it use to not work when i just ran ssh
2006-09-22T06:46:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	ok, i was trying to install flashplugin-nonfree and now because it can't install, it comes up each time i run apt-get install
2006-09-22T06:47:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	yeah whats up with flashplugin-nonfree anyway?  I have been having major problems getting it to install on my daughters pc
2006-09-22T06:47:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	i'm not sure, but i did it and it still comes up that and firefox works
2006-09-22T06:48:00.000Z	fluvvell	sivik	but can you access any flash enabled pages? what plugins does about:plugins list for you? mine was blank
2006-09-22T06:48:00.000Z	sivik	fluvvell	not sure
