2008-11-12T23:50:00.000Z	gavagai		I don't really use any email software on ubuntu, i do everything on a different machine.  anyway, how can I easily create a local copy of everything in my imap email account?
2008-11-12T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	imap by definition keeps a klocal copy on the client machines
2008-11-12T23:52:00.000Z	gavagai	ikonia	i don't really understand what that would mean but I do not use my ubuntu machine as an imap client.  i have an email account with imap.  i never use it from this machine.  i want to downlaod a local copy of every message from the imap server to this machine.
2008-11-12T23:56:00.000Z	gavagai	ikonia	i also am not sure you are correct.  imap clients don't just download everything on your account to a local copy.  it only gets all the message headers and then gets the messages on demand.
2008-11-12T23:56:00.000Z	gavagai	ikonia	i have 11000 messages on imap if i fire up a local imap mail client it isn't going to create 10000 messages on my box
2008-11-12T23:57:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	correct, but any messages y ou have "selected" will be stored locally
2008-11-12T23:57:00.000Z	gavagai	ikonia	so what do you mean imap 'by definition' creates a local copy?
2008-11-12T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	if you open the client and select the messages it will keep a local copy on your machine
2008-11-12T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	imap is not "mail storage" how it is stored will depend on the server's configuation
2008-11-12T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	take a copy of the mail store of the server
2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z	gavagai	ikonia	how do i access the mail store on a server?  it isn't my server.
2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	then your out of luck
2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	that language isn ot needed
2008-11-13T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	how ? if only downloads the headers  as you've rightly said
2008-11-13T00:02:00.000Z	gavagai	ikonia	if there isn't a program that does that i will eat my hat.  i am not "out of luck"
2008-11-13T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	no it wouldn't as it's the same as downloading every message - which is what a mail client does
2008-11-13T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	thats the program that does it - a mail client
2008-11-13T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	thats just doing what a mail client does
2008-11-13T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	gavagai	downloading all messages into a local store
