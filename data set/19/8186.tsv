2008-09-25T19:01:00.000Z	ShortWave		Hi all
2008-09-25T19:01:00.000Z	ShortWave		I got a weird issue
2008-09-25T19:02:00.000Z	ShortWave		I cranked up ubuntu server and it read my disk setup one way (I have an SATA drive, then 2 PATA drives), so it laid them out as sda == SATA, sdb/c == PATA
2008-09-25T19:02:00.000Z	ShortWave		I went to switch to ubuntu workstation, and it read it the same way...the FIRST time
2008-09-25T19:03:00.000Z	ShortWave		The second time I cranked it up, it read it backwards, it made my SATA drive == sdc
2008-09-25T19:03:00.000Z	ShortWave		For some reason, it's flipping their installation order, even tho GRUB believes that the SATA drive is /dev/sda
2008-09-25T19:04:00.000Z	ShortWave		but since grub is looking for the root on /dev/sdc...
2008-09-25T19:04:00.000Z	ShortWave		I'm kinda flummoxed
2008-09-25T19:04:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	The best way to solve that is to create custom udev rules keyed to the disk serial-numbers
2008-09-25T19:05:00.000Z	ShortWave	IntuitiveNipple	I'm guessing this is a common problem?
2008-09-25T19:05:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	or, is it at the BIOS/GRUB stage that it is happening (thus causing boot to fail) ?
2008-09-25T19:05:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	not particularly, no :) You're privileged
2008-09-25T19:05:00.000Z	ShortWave	IntuitiveNipple	I tried installing with the workstation-chosen layout
2008-09-25T19:05:00.000Z	ShortWave	IntuitiveNipple	(sata == sdc)
2008-09-25T19:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	Does this affect boot? or is this only affecting the booted kernel? If the latter, then udev is the answer
2008-09-25T19:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	*blinks* :)
2008-09-25T19:07:00.000Z	ShortWave	IntuitiveNipple	yeah well it ain't making sense to me either.
2008-09-25T19:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	Is it bug #8497 ?
2008-09-25T19:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ShortWave	take a look at the reports. If it is, add a comment to the bug especially detailing the kernel version since the bug is marked Fix released
