2011-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU		Nobody knows?
2011-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU		So.. How can I change the User Enviroment variables?
2011-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	what are you trying to accomplish ?
2011-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	add ADB to it so I don't have to be SU to use it
2011-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	elaborate
2011-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	ADB = Android Debus Bridge, If I'm not SU I can not use the ADB command because it's not in my enviromental variables. I CAN CD to the filder with ADB but then my scripts wont work.
2011-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	not "SU" ? not root, you mean?
2011-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	yes.
2011-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	gaining root privileges is done using sudo
2011-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	yes.... But adb is in the SU enviromental variables, NOT mine
2011-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	why do you keep using the term "SU"? there is  no such a thing as a SU user, there's either root or a less privileged user
2011-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	what's the exact command you're using?
2011-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	SU is easier to write then root.
2011-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	it's wrong. period.
2011-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	ok ok sorry -.-
2011-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	TheDeadCPU	ilovefairuz	Let me try again. How can I edit my USER enviromental valuables?
2011-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	 for a specific command you just prefix the variable identifier and it's value to the command itself, example: SOMETHING=VALUE ls
2011-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	this will run the 'ls' command with the value for the environment variable SOMETHING equal to VALUE
2011-01-01T02:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheDeadCPU	to permanently  set  the value, edit ~/.profile
