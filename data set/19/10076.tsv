2006-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	safrican_		although I have enabled the backports repository - i cannot upgrade to the latest version available (on backports, ofcourse) .. [of beagle to be more specific]  - any help ? i don't know how to debug it
2006-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	safrican_		i don't knwo what to do - literally
2006-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	did you update the package lists after adding the repository?
2006-07-30T10:08:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	yes - like 8 times
2006-07-30T10:08:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	once should be enough :)
2006-07-30T10:09:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	which version do you have then?
2006-07-30T10:09:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	yeah - i know once should be enough.. i have the beagle 0.2.6 but backports has 0.2.7 and i would really like to update to it but its just not possible
2006-07-30T10:10:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	hmm. 2.6 is what i have too
2006-07-30T10:10:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	yeah - its just a bit bothering because i moved from lfs - gentoo - slackware - gentoo - ubuntu and so far i've been pretty happy with it but this problem is very annoying
2006-07-30T10:12:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	0.2.7 does indeed seem to be there
2006-07-30T10:14:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	yeah - exactly - so how do i upgrade to it
2006-07-30T10:23:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	the Packages file in the backports repository is empty, as if they have disabled them for some reason
2006-07-30T10:23:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	maybe there's some breakage
2006-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	really ? cause this is not mentioned on the Ubuntu Backports
2006-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	erm.. i meant Ubuntu Forums
2006-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	well the file is empty, saw it with mine own two eyes :)
2006-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	topyli	safrican_	the packages are in the pool but i'm not sure if i'd want to install them
2006-07-30T10:27:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	yeah - thats what i don't get .. to be honest
2006-07-30T10:27:00.000Z	safrican_	topyli	and all these files were uploaded today
