2007-09-08T13:58:00.000Z	BBking		Maybe I format my disk :)
2007-09-08T13:58:00.000Z	BBking		and put Vista on it
2007-09-08T13:59:00.000Z	BBking		Mr0bvious: I don't know too :(
2007-09-08T13:59:00.000Z	BBking		Exactly what I was typing
2007-09-08T13:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	BBking	can you paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
2007-09-08T14:01:00.000Z	BBking	howlingmadhowie	It is -_-
2007-09-08T14:03:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	BBking	of course, you could always use the "vesa" driver. then the display would work, but you'd lose 3d-acceleration.
2007-09-08T14:04:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	BBking	your xorg.conf looks okay. can you paste /var/log/Xorg.0.log as well?
2007-09-08T14:05:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	BBking	you could try upping horizsync and vertrefresh to some ridiculously high values just to check if that's the problem, but i think the newer nvidia cards tend to ignore those fields anyway
2007-09-08T14:06:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	BBking	once i've got the nvidia driver working on my computer, i never touch it again...
