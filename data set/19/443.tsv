2012-04-30T15:50:00.000Z	Darael		OK, next irritating question:  How do I do the equivalent of "aptitude markauto" with apt-(get|cache)?
2012-04-30T15:51:00.000Z	L3top	Darael	apt-mark markauto
2012-04-30T15:52:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	Ah, apt-mark.  Right, I'd missed that.  Thanks.
2012-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	Lightdm is an Upstart job, so to be picky, that ought to be "sudo stop lightdm", although thy version should also work.
2012-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	L3top	Darael	until there is a point release it is not available without adding the -d switch in terminal... is probably why
2012-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	So /that/'s why I had to add -d.  Interesting.  Did not know that.
2012-04-30T17:13:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	What?
2012-04-30T17:15:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	I'm talking to mn_ about using a chroot to fix a failed upgrade.  I don't see what the live DVD someone installed from has to do with that?
2012-04-30T17:21:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	We /did/ establish that the architectures were different.  Last I heard, mn_ had gone to get a 64-bit liveCD.
2012-04-30T17:16:00.000Z	L3top	Darael	I was simply saying, that this, I believe, is a bug... as I have encountered it several times since 1204 release with other users, and that while normally I would agree that it is probably a 64/32 versioning issue, the reason I knew the error it gave is because I believe this to be a bug. That is all.
2012-04-30T17:17:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	Ah, I see.
2012-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	No, it wasn't.  I was referring to 'to' as opposed to "too".
2012-04-30T17:46:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	Ah.  Right.  Yes.  My brain is clearly falling apart.
2012-04-30T18:33:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	I'm terrible at refraining from feeding them.  I try, but I just can't stop myself.
2012-04-30T19:59:00.000Z	L3top	Darael	it is my understanding that it is no longer FOSS, so development under the gnu license has stopped...
2012-04-30T19:59:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	The Wiki page suggests 3.4 onwards are under the Apache licence 2.0.
2012-06-01T04:48:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	VLC is indeed gaining weight, and I wasn't aware that mplayer handled h264 better.  Good to know.
2012-06-01T04:46:00.000Z	Darael	L3top	True, but most people want to use /one/ player.  Personally, I just add medibuntu and install non-free-codecs (which depends on w(32|64)codecs and ubuntu-restricted-extras) and libdvdcss2 - I usually have VLC in place already.
2012-06-01T04:47:00.000Z	L3top	Darael	the only ones in "competition" are mplayer (which handles h264 better than vlc, as much as I love vlc) and vlc is a great swiss army knife
