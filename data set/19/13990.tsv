2004-11-25T09:18:00.000Z	chazwurth		hrm, so user accounts have sudo access to all commands on the system in ubuntu?
2004-11-25T09:19:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	see this page
2004-11-25T09:23:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	will bring a lot of trouble with the config tools in gnome.....
2004-11-25T09:25:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	that's allright. even if I decide to use those, I'd like to set things up such that the root password is prompted for rather than the user's. also, there are plenty of commands that would be available by default that have no gnome config tools.
2004-11-25T09:26:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	they all use gksudo, i heard your changes in the Computermenu get reverted
2004-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	...on next login
2004-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	hmm. I'll have to play around with it once I finally install ubuntu :) mostly, I just don't want the user account to have access to things like fdisk or mk[whatever] fs :)
2004-11-25T09:29:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	they are only able to use the gnome tools or, if they know what sudo is use the command with sudo/passwd
2004-11-25T09:29:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	and btw, only the first user got sudo access ;)
2004-11-27T07:33:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	what filesystem ?
2004-11-27T07:33:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	seems to be doing ext3
2004-11-27T07:33:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	I'm just doing the completely default install.
2004-11-27T07:34:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	how big is the disk ?
2004-11-27T07:34:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	about 30 gigs.
2004-11-27T07:34:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	should take not too long ....
2004-11-27T07:34:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	it's still sitting at 33%. although the machine isn't frozen, I can still switch to other virtual terminals.
2004-11-27T07:35:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	so give it some time.....normally it works.....
2004-11-27T07:35:00.000Z	chazwurth	ogra	will do.
2004-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	ogra	chazwurth	erik is right
