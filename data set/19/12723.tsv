2006-06-23T12:40:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	you can try this in a terminal "sudo ntpdate us.pool.ntp.org"
2006-06-23T12:40:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	i know but the thing is that when i restart the pc the clock is not set right, and i would have to do it manually all the time, which i am trying to avoid
2006-06-23T12:42:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	choose a better timeserver for you. have a look at http://www.pool.ntp.org which one that might be more suitable
2006-06-23T12:43:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	but i use pool.ntp.org fine
2006-06-23T12:43:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	the problem is the clock after setting syncronizes to the wrong time
2006-06-23T12:43:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	if i go do it manually now, it returns the right time.
2006-06-23T12:44:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	whereas if i put it automatic it does not
2006-06-23T12:44:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	see if you have the correct ntp pool server in /etc/ntp.conf ...?
2006-06-23T12:50:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	what is fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 13
2006-06-23T12:50:00.000Z	caonex_		?
2006-06-23T12:51:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	think it is that it uses the local clock as a reference
2006-06-23T12:52:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	the main important thing in that file is the "server blah.blah.com"
2006-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	i cant restart right now, but what has been happeing is that i do a manual update and it set itself right, but when i restart, the time is not right, so i thought it could be a bug in dapper
2006-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	i have used this configuration for a long time
2006-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	and never had any problem of this kind, so i thought it could be a bug
2006-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	could your CMOS battery be old? when you first start your computer, enter BIOS and see if the time is still correct.
2006-06-23T12:54:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	brand new laptop
2006-06-23T12:54:00.000Z	caonex_	Jowi	the time is still correct
2006-06-23T12:55:00.000Z	Jowi	caonex_	ntp work best if the system time and the ntp time is fairly similar (they should not drift too much). Yes, it is still correct while you have the computer on, but see in BIOS if it is resetted if you have turned your computer off for a while. if it is resetted it is probably the CMOS battery
