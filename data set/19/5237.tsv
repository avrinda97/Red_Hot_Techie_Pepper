2008-08-17T15:38:00.000Z	blackbinary_		Hi, I want to have metacity start up on default instead of compiz, how can I do this (8.04)
2008-08-17T15:39:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	system, preferences, appearance, visual efects, set to none
2008-08-17T15:40:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	does none basically = metacity?
2008-08-17T15:40:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	I think so, yes
2008-08-17T15:40:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	do you know of a way to check to see which I am running?
2008-08-17T15:41:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	run this, "ps -A | grep -i compiz", see if it finds a compiz process
2008-08-17T15:41:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	replace compiz with metacity to search for that instead
2008-08-17T15:43:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	got metacity, dont have compiz :D
2008-08-17T15:43:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	there you go =)
2008-08-17T15:44:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	do you know how to get compositing (or however it is spelled) on metacity working? or is it enabled by default?
2008-08-17T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	metacity doesn't do compositing... it's one of the reasons for compiz.. there is a small utility if you just want basic transparency without all the other shiny stuff though.. search in synaptic for composite
2008-08-17T15:47:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	i've got quite a few posts that says it does, nothing flashy but shadows & window fade etc.
2008-08-17T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	huh.. metacity with window fade and stuff.. news to me at least.. they don't say how they do it?
2008-08-17T15:48:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	: http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/03/31/enable-metacity-compositing-in-gnome-222/
2008-08-17T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	if you edit the gnome "registry" I think it will stick
2008-08-17T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	just run gconf-editor in a terminal, click your way to apps, metacity, general, compositing manager
2008-08-17T15:52:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	eh seems laggy like other people were complaining.
2008-08-17T15:53:00.000Z	Slart	blackbinary_	well.. it seems it is brand new.. so it might need some polish before it's running smooth.. it took compiz pretty long to become what it is now
2008-08-17T15:54:00.000Z	blackbinary_	Slart	apparently theres a new version that removes a 50fps cap
