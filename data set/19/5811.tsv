2008-05-12T08:00:00.000Z	gNewPower		A neighbor of mine is using Windoze XP.  He forgot his admin password.  I tried re-setting it with a Ubuntu live-CD using the "chntpw" application only to find out that it was not more in the Ubuntu repos.  What application in the latest version of Ubuntu can I use to reset this WXP password?
2008-05-12T08:01:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	Restart the XP box into Recovery Mode, and it'll let you log into Administrator, rather than simply an admin account... then just change it or whatever
2008-05-12T08:01:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	Not an #ubuntu question though.
2008-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	thanks, that is a very helpful pointer
2008-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	Most XP machines don't actually show the admin account, and there is no password set at all... it's rather humorous.
2008-05-12T08:07:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	I dunno.  I have not used Windoze since 2000.  But my neighbor is stuck and I would like to help him out.  Ubuntu used to have chntpwd and I suppose that there is a more recent application which works the same way
2008-05-12T08:09:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	I still see chntpw ?
2008-05-12T08:10:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	I don't. if you do 'which chntpw' what do you get?
2008-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	It's not installed here, so I'd get nothing.
2008-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	You have universe enabled?
2008-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	so why did you say that it was this there? yes, I have universe
2008-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	because it _IS_ there... doesn't mean I installed it, I have no need for it.
2008-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	of course. can you see it in apt-cache search?
2008-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	no, I'm just telling you its there to make fun of you  :/
2008-05-12T08:13:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	note it's 'chntpw' no d
2008-05-12T08:13:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	thanks. very funny indeed.
2008-05-12T08:14:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	That was just me sarcastically telling you yes apt-cache show chntpw works
2008-05-12T08:14:00.000Z	gNewPower	fde	thanks. that is really witty.  you're a pro.
2008-05-12T08:14:00.000Z	fde	gNewPower	*bows*
