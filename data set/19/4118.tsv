2011-08-31T03:21:00.000Z	mod		I have uninstalled OpenJDK, installed the Sun JDK to /opt/java, set PATH to include /opt/java within /etc/profile, /etc/bash.bashrc, and /etc/environment.  Whenever I run Firefox it used only look for OpenJDK, and now that I've uninstalled that it says I have no JRE
2011-08-31T03:22:00.000Z	mod		I cannot figure out how to get Firefox to recognize I have installed a diff JRE
2011-08-31T03:22:00.000Z	mod		any ideas?
2011-08-31T03:23:00.000Z	mod		aptitude purge ...
2011-08-31T03:23:00.000Z	mod		its certainly uninstalled
2011-08-31T03:25:00.000Z	mod		the problem is getting FF to recognize the sunjdk
2011-08-31T03:25:00.000Z	iceroot	mod	sudo update-alternatvies --config java   there you have to change the java-plugin
2011-08-31T03:26:00.000Z	iceroot	mod	maybe you also have to change java in "about:config" in firefox
2011-08-31T03:26:00.000Z	mod	iceroot	yeah look there, nothing helpful
2011-08-31T03:26:00.000Z	mod		man, i hate firefox

2011-08-31T03:27:00.000Z	iceroot	mod	remeber that firefox is reading the java-plugin not the normal java-path
2011-08-31T03:28:00.000Z	mod		i've isntalled the firefox from getfirefox.com, not the come-withubuntu
2011-08-31T03:28:00.000Z	mod	iceroot	i symlinked the plugin .so from to .mozilla/plugins
2011-08-31T03:28:00.000Z	iceroot	mod	and "about:plugins" is using the correc t one? why not using firefox from the repos?
2011-08-31T03:29:00.000Z	mod	iceroot	about:plugins doesnt show the java plugin, even when it was running the openjdk one properly, it didnt how anyhtingin about;plugins
