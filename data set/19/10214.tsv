2006-08-21T06:11:00.000Z	RichEd		hello ... question about end user desktop requirements: how do we respond when someone says they want KDE desktop ? what's our response to that ... especially vs other variants where people can chose ?
2006-08-21T06:13:00.000Z	RichEd		req: a russian country wants to deploy 32,000 machines, with paid LT support, and help with localisation etc.
2006-08-21T06:13:00.000Z	RichEd		especially educational desktop support
2006-08-21T06:14:00.000Z	RichEd		we are *much*  better in the Edubuntu area than Kubuntu for this level of relationship
2006-08-21T06:14:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	as far as I know, there is no paid support for KDE
2006-08-21T06:15:00.000Z	RichEd	lamego	that's my issue :)
2006-08-21T06:11:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	you ask them why, if they have a good reason you install it for them :)
2006-08-21T06:13:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	i am not aware the KDE language support is differente from gnome...
2006-08-21T06:16:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	that should be an argument enough for people needing paid support :)
2006-08-21T06:16:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	KDE is not an option on your case :)
2006-08-21T06:17:00.000Z	RichEd	lamego	... thanks ... agree with all of the comments ... just that if *they* insist i don't want to make them go away
2006-08-21T06:18:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	you could debate why do they ask for KDE
2006-08-21T06:18:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	I am sure they have a reason you can argue with
2006-08-21T06:21:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	with some customization you can get a windows alike gnome
2006-08-21T06:21:00.000Z	RichEd	lamego	yes, but then again support becomes an issue ...
2006-08-21T06:22:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	not really, we are talking about themes and menu customizations, that must be covered by a support agreement, thats just desktop customization
2006-08-21T06:22:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	support is not bind to themes...
2006-08-21T06:24:00.000Z	RichEd	lamego	real issue for me is "why bend something to look like something else" when the kids will be happy with anything ..,. that's the d@mn pity that the first suggestion is usually M$ and then KDE becomes a step to the left as a "substitute", but the real qudience (i.e. green kids) would be happy to start with anything and learn from scratch.
2006-08-21T06:28:00.000Z	lamego	RichEd	well, you could go over that, KDE or GNOME are just "skins" :P
