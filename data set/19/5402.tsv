2008-07-13T04:49:00.000Z	krsnadasa		Error inserting iwl4965 (/lib/modules/2.6.26-3-generic/updates/drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl4965.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg) any help/ideas/suggestions ?
2008-07-13T04:50:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	run this: sudo depmod -a
2008-07-13T04:50:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	then try again. If it still fails it's a bug.
2008-07-13T04:50:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	also, intrepid help in #ubuntu+1
2008-07-13T04:51:00.000Z	krsnadasa	Seveas	no luck :( i just compiled newest compat-wireless driver
2008-07-13T04:51:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	well that's your problem :) don't do that then
2008-07-13T04:52:00.000Z	krsnadasa	Seveas	lol yea but isn't there a way to fix this rather then turning the other cheek ?
2008-07-13T04:52:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	just use ubuntu-provided drivers if you don't know how to fix driver issues
2008-07-13T04:53:00.000Z	krsnadasa	Seveas	i believe it is a module problem not a driver issue and whats the use of this channel if we don't learn ?
2008-07-13T04:56:00.000Z	krsnadasa	Seveas	so you don't know bout modules or have any idea ?
2008-07-13T04:57:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	my best guess is that the module you compile is incompatible with the running kernel. I'd find out which symbol is missing and search lkml for references to that symbol being added/removed/changed
2008-07-13T04:57:00.000Z	krsnadasa	Seveas	lkml = what ?
2008-07-13T04:58:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	see, if you don't know what lkml is (yes, I was testing you with that), you're too inexperienced to try your hand at manually compiling kernel modules which may or may not work
2008-07-13T04:58:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	and also, google is your friend
2008-07-13T04:59:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	that is also almost trivial to find with google :)
2008-07-13T05:53:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	because you manually compiled an incompatible driver without any knowledge on how to debug such a problem
2008-07-13T05:54:00.000Z	krsnadasa	Seveas	well thats why i come here if i knew everything i wouldn't be asking for help..huh.. huh.. and if you can't help the best is to keep quiet ;)
2008-07-13T05:54:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	I gave you some pointers. Not gonna solve everything for you
2008-07-13T05:55:00.000Z	Seveas	krsnadasa	besides we don't support intrepid in here
