2008-06-25T07:46:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	apt-get install xfce4
2008-06-25T07:57:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	It's the first thing to try, and if it gives no other errors then it'll work.
2008-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Pastebin the error and give us a link; it's scrolled fairly far back.
2008-06-25T08:11:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Is your hard drive full?
2008-06-25T08:28:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Instead of "it says something like," could you paste the exact error?
2008-06-25T08:29:00.000Z	waveflow	trimeta	i dont know how to copy paste in the terminal
2008-06-25T08:29:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Then type one character at a time. Or, if you used gnome-terminal from within X, you can highlight something and then middle-click to paste.
2008-06-25T08:34:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Did you make a separate partition for /boot?
2008-06-25T08:34:00.000Z	waveflow	trimeta	yes, i allocated 50 mb
2008-06-25T08:34:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	And is /boot nearly full?
2008-06-25T08:35:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	First "sudo mount /boot", then "df -h"
2008-06-25T08:37:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Paste the output of "ls -lh /boot" to the pastebin.
2008-06-25T08:38:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Basically, when you past that output we'll be able to see how many old kernel versions you have, and then you can uninstall a few.
2008-06-25T08:39:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	I'd probably "apt-get remove linux-image-2.6.24-16-generic"
2008-06-25T08:41:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Sorry, I should have said to do that with sudo.
2008-06-25T08:44:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	OK, you're going to have to do things the hard way.
2008-06-25T08:45:00.000Z	trimeta	waveflow	Do the following after someone other than me says it's a good idea: sudo rm both of the files ending in .bak, and then try sudo dpkg --reconfigure -a again.
