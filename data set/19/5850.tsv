2008-04-26T13:48:00.000Z	robinreborn		does anybody know why installing updates on dell computers causes me to get a non-graphical command prompt after I restart?
2008-04-26T13:48:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	what updates?
2008-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	robinreborn		updates to the latest version
2008-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	robinreborn		I am running like 7.04 which was what was installed when I bought it
2008-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	robinreborn		when I update to latest version, after everything is done and it is restarting... it gives me a unix command prompt
2008-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	robinreborn		annoying as hell
2008-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	so are you in X right now?  did you use startx to get there?
2008-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	robinreborn		I reinstalled 7.04
2008-04-26T13:51:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	odds are the bootlevel got messed up.  if you log in at the command prompt and type "startx", then the graphical stuff should start up.
2008-04-26T13:51:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	if it doesn't, you need to reconfigure X, which is done with some command that I don't remember right now but I'm sure someone else does...anyone?
2008-04-26T13:51:00.000Z	robinreborn		and it should work normally from then on?
2008-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	robinreborn	androver	what exactly is X?
2008-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	there are a few things that might have happened.  your X settings could be messed up, meaning that you need to reconfigure X.  http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-how-to-reconfigure-x-windows-system-xorg-server/
2008-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	X is the "windowing server".  it provides the graphical interface
2008-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	robinreborn		and you don't have any idea why updating messes it up?
2008-04-26T13:54:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	nope, hard to say without looking at logs.
2008-04-26T13:54:00.000Z	robinreborn		thanks
2008-04-26T13:54:00.000Z	androver	robinreborn	but you want to update, then log in, then type "startx".  If that works, great, come back here and we'll help you make it happen automatically.  If not, follow the directions at http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-how-to-reconfigure-x-windows-system-xorg-server/ and reconfigure X.
