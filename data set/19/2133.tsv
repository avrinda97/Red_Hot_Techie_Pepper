2010-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	TSK		10.10 Maverick = Current?  10.04 Lucid = Current LTS?  Aye?
2010-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	TSK		Ctrl-Alt-F2 should switch to a console (non graphical terminal) I believe
2010-11-08T06:17:00.000Z	TSK		Ctrl-Alt-F7 usually
2010-11-08T06:17:00.000Z	TSK		Alt-F7, ya.  Sorry.
2010-11-08T06:19:00.000Z	TSK		Same thing telling an M$ addict that ANYTHING is better than their M$ products.
2010-11-08T06:20:00.000Z	r007	TSK	we had a windows kid start work he defended m$ to the hilt now hes seen what Linux can do he soon changed his mind
2010-11-08T06:22:00.000Z	TSK	r007	Ya.  It happens once in a while, but I sure am sick to death of college professors brainwashing people that they MUST use M$ products or fail.
2010-11-08T06:23:00.000Z	r007	TSK	thats the problem real admins dont come from college
2010-11-08T06:23:00.000Z	TSK	r007	Friend of mine has been turning in all his work for school from OpenOffice, but just recently one of his professors found out he's been using a non-M$ product and threatened to fail him.  Talk about ignorant...  :-/
2010-11-08T06:23:00.000Z	r007	TSK	oh dear lol
2010-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	r007	TSK	the thing is the professor probably didnt know how to open it :D
2010-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	TSK	r007	He'd been opening .xls files from my friend for MONTHS prior to discovering that my friend was using OpenOffice.  Soon as he found out he started demanding files be turned in in "Office 2007 format"...  Seriously?!  What even IS "Office 2007 format"?  He wants it all turned in in .xlsx and he doesn't even KNOW what xlsx IS, yet he's teaching a COLLEGE course in Excel!  Sad...
2010-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	r007	TSK	hes learned the academic way so knows nothing other than he has been taught sadly
2010-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	TSK	r007	It's just pathetic.  It's no wonder some people think the "Internet" is "that blue 'e' on my desktop".
2010-11-08T07:36:00.000Z	TSK	r007	You mean the "service" command?  Works on my Ubuntu.
2010-11-08T07:37:00.000Z	r007	TSK	hmm not tried it since 8.04
2010-11-08T07:37:00.000Z	r007	TSK	cool it works about time :D
2010-11-08T07:38:00.000Z	TSK	r007	Upstart's been around a while now.  :)
2010-11-08T07:42:00.000Z	TSK	r007	Rest well
