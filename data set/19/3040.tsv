2009-11-04T22:33:00.000Z	Snausages		another topic...  is there a concise overview of the differences between 9.04 and 9.10?
2009-11-04T22:33:00.000Z	Snausages		I seem to have installed 9.04 the day before 9.10 came out
2009-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	ok well 9.10 uhmm
2009-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	let's  talk about it in pm, since things will go a bit off topic I guess
2009-11-04T22:34:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	sure
2009-11-04T22:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	The release notes are good for finding out about 9.10
2009-11-08T00:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	sound issues  can normalley be fixed, so your answer wasn't exactly helpful
2009-11-08T00:39:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	sorry man, I'll let you answer next time
2009-11-08T00:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	well sound isn't my area, but  it's a good idea to be more helpful with new users,  well if you want  Ubuntu to have a chance at gaining some proper market share anyway
2009-11-26T19:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	the new artwork is sucky
2009-11-26T19:53:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	I might not go that far, but I have to say I miss some of what I saw in 9.04.  I dunno, I only used it 10 days before I upgraded to karmic
2009-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	and I'd never used any ubuntu before that
2009-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	What kind of stuff are you missing?
2009-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	literally just the look of the artwork on the login screen for jaunty.
2009-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	ah yes that
2009-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	well there is a way to use the old screen instead
2009-11-26T19:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Snausages	I tried, but  something went a bit wrong
2009-11-26T19:55:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	I guess I'm disappointed though...  the only reason I upgraded to 9.1 was because I heard it was possible to get some kind of color management...  still haven't gotten it to work though.
2009-12-24T06:53:00.000Z	Snausages	sebsebseb	I dunno, I have a 2002 laptop I got the same way
