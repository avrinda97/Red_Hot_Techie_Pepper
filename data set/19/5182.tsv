2008-08-17T09:49:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	http://pastebin.com/m3a38fe08 i tihnk it's the boot partition that's running out of room :(
2008-08-17T09:48:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	'df -h' and see how much space is left
2008-08-17T09:50:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	thats huge for a boot partition
2008-08-17T09:50:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	do ls /boot/ into pastebin

2008-08-17T09:53:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	maybe i have to delete some of those files?
2008-08-17T09:53:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	do uname -a and see what kernel version you are running

2008-08-17T09:55:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	maybe my boot partition is not deleting old kernels?
2008-08-17T09:55:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	its not really designed to iirc
2008-08-17T09:55:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	you will need to go into synaptic and remove your old kernels
2008-08-17T09:55:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	so the user has to know how to clean it up once in a while.... or have a huge boot partition and not worry about it
2008-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	this may be brutal but find the oldest kernel version in /boot and just rm the kernel-* file for it
2008-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	ok i'll try that
2008-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	actually better idea
2008-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	so  i would type something like  move /boot/kernel-*  in terminal?
2008-08-17T10:01:00.000Z	Sonja	xzcvczxx	http://paste.ubuntu.com/38120/ that's the list of files in /boot/
2008-08-17T10:03:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	no, just do mv kernel-(earliest version there) /root/
2008-08-17T10:03:00.000Z	xzcvczxx	Sonja	you will need a sudo in front of it
