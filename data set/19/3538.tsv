2010-02-22T13:36:00.000Z	xxthink	rww	: do you know how to get it?
2010-02-22T13:39:00.000Z	rww	xxthink	If you're not doing kernel profiling, you can apparently just use "opcontrol --no-vmlinux". If you are, I'll go check if a package somewhere has it, otherwise you'd have to recompile the kernel (which is outside of my area of expertise)
