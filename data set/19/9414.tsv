2007-02-25T10:16:00.000Z	IcemanV9		can i install server from desktop CD (it's what i have now)??
2007-02-25T10:17:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	well not exactly.
2007-02-25T10:17:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	I guess its possible but you'd be better off just using alternate iso.
2007-02-25T10:18:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	ok.
2007-02-25T10:19:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	It would be a real pita to do it with the desktop cd.  i.e. you'd have to make your own parts chroot to the drive and install ubuntu-server.
2007-02-25T10:19:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	err... you might want the server cd not the alternate iso.
2007-02-25T10:21:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	i didn't want to d/l another iso just for "server" install ... i should have stick with alternative as i believe it provides pretty much everything opposite to desktop or server only
2007-02-25T10:21:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	I dunno if the alternate has server install selection?
2007-02-25T10:22:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	me, either. i do know that hoary & breezy do have those. :)
2007-02-25T10:23:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	I just run a gui on my server anyh00t dont' really see the reason not to now-a-days hardware wise.  Makes my job less of a headache.
2007-02-25T10:23:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	blah humbug. i'm going to find out (booting up vbox).
2007-02-25T10:23:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	Oh yeah I forgot I had a virtual machine I could have checked also ah well
2007-02-25T10:30:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	just type "server" with alternative :) btw, which virtual machine do u run with? (me, virtualbox)
2007-02-25T10:31:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	currently using qemu with the kqemu module.
2007-02-25T10:32:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	heh. on another box, i used qemu w/ kqemu. so i thought i could try virtualbox and see how it goes.
2007-02-25T10:33:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	any difference?
2007-02-25T10:34:00.000Z	IcemanV9	h1st0	looks like pretty much the same, but it seems that virtualbox is responding faster than qemu.
2007-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	hrm..
2007-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	h1st0	IcemanV9	Yeah I might have to check it out.
