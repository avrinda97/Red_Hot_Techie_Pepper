2005-09-17T16:46:00.000Z	elroy		hello
2005-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	elroy		just installed ubuntu. for some reason mp3s won't play, eventhough i installed the plugin thingie
2005-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	elroy		what's worse, xmms doesn't react to anything anymore.
2005-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	you will have to install the codec's
2005-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	check www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	the soundserver is blocked, most likely by gnome, so just change xmms to use alsa and it might work
2005-09-17T16:50:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	does it work?
2005-09-17T16:52:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	then change it back and go into system->settings->sound and uncheck the box that says Enable sound server...
2005-09-17T16:53:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	it might be,, not sure...
2005-09-17T16:56:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	is the volume on?
2005-09-17T16:56:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	open the volume controll and check
2005-09-17T16:58:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	are the chanels on mute?
2005-09-17T16:59:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	does the sound work otherwise?
2005-09-17T05:00:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	well, do you hear anything when you login?
2005-09-17T05:01:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	then the installation hasn't detected your soundcard
2005-09-17T05:01:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	open a terminal and type: lsmod | grep snd
2005-09-17T05:01:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	does it produce any output
2005-09-17T05:02:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	then I have no idea,, sorry
2005-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	bigme	elroy	whoohooo!
