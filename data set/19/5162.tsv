2008-08-21T16:25:00.000Z	Totakeke		Tried running that terminal flash drive "dd" delete thing, but it didn't work. I keep getting the error "Could not format /dev/sdd1"
2008-08-21T16:25:00.000Z	Totakeke		(The error appears after I run "Create Live USB system"
2008-08-21T16:26:00.000Z	Totakeke		!usb | Totakeke
2008-08-21T16:26:00.000Z	Totakeke		alright
2008-08-21T16:27:00.000Z	Totakeke		I did all the stuff on the wiki, had no luck. That's why I'm asking on here.
2008-08-21T16:29:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	try the guide on  http://www.pendrivelinux.com
2008-08-21T16:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	so what failed when you followed the guide at http://www.pendrivelinux.com exactly?
2008-08-21T16:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	Dr_willis : http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2008/05/08/usb-ubuntu-804-persistent-install-via-the-live-cd/
2008-08-22T14:21:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	not enough to kill it
2008-08-22T14:22:00.000Z	Totakeke	DistroJockey	Lol but I mean how close am I? I shouldn't be too close at all, I think? Since it's new? Formatting only counts as 1 read/write (per cell of memory)?
2008-08-22T14:22:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	did you see the part in all those guides you read about syslinux and maybe needing to use a lilo command to make the flash drive bootable?
2008-08-22T14:22:00.000Z	Totakeke	DistroJockey	No, but I'ev heard about syslinux. I have since then, however, decided not to install Linux on the drive and murder it. :P It costs too much to go killing it. :P
2008-08-22T14:24:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	the way that persistent installs work, minimises writes
2008-08-22T14:24:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	yeah, I guess
2008-08-22T14:25:00.000Z	Totakeke	DistroJockey	But it would still shorten the life. And what about all of the other stuff the OS does that involves writing to stuff to (what it thinks is) the hard drive, like KenBW2 said?
2008-08-22T14:26:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	it's all done in RAM on a decent persistent USB system
2008-08-22T14:26:00.000Z	Totakeke	DistroJockey	I'd do it but it's fine, really. The people at the public library would probably get mad at me anyway :P (And anywhere else I decide to do it.)
2008-08-22T14:27:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Totakeke	well, if they let you boot from USB that's their fault not your's ;)
2008-08-22T14:27:00.000Z	Totakeke	DistroJockey	Ah, too true. :)
