2011-01-29T18:42:00.000Z	Spodey		More than one? Sure one isn't remarked?
2011-01-29T18:42:00.000Z	dondon_	Spodey	where would i obtain backported drivers? alsa?
2011-01-29T18:43:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	There's a WIKI on that topic - I'll have a quick google. IIRC you need the backports repos enabled, but ideally, you want to only install the alsa modules and nothing else,.
2011-01-29T18:44:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	try installing linux-backports-modules-alsa-maverick-generic
2011-01-29T18:46:00.000Z	dondon_	Spodey	what after that?
2011-01-29T18:46:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	Reboot?

2011-01-29T18:55:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	Does the whole machine hang and not respond?
2011-01-29T18:56:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	Did you check dmesg to see what was going on?
2011-01-29T18:56:00.000Z	dondon_	Spodey	how do i do that?
2011-01-29T18:57:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	Just go to the terminal (after you ctrl+c perhaps) and type dmesg
2011-01-29T18:58:00.000Z	dondon_	Spodey	i guess i lied its not letting me now
2011-01-29T18:58:00.000Z	Spodey	dondon_	Can you open another terminal? Or ctrl+z ?
