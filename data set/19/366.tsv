2012-09-26T22:13:00.000Z	bibi23		Hi, how can I now where a package is installed?
2012-09-26T22:14:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	go to synaptic manager
2012-09-26T22:16:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	is there another way? I don't think I have this synaptic manager installed
2012-09-26T22:16:00.000Z	bibi23		I mean with the command line
2012-09-26T22:17:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	System->Administration-> Synaptic Package Manager
2012-09-26T22:19:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	I can't see it, I'm on ubuntu 12.04
2012-09-26T22:20:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	type in your terminal that: synaptic package manager
2012-09-26T22:21:00.000Z	bibi23		it says it's not installed, and suggests 'sudo apt-get install synaptic'
2012-09-26T22:23:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	Install it from Software Center
2012-09-26T22:26:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	it's ok I've installed it, well I'm not sure if now it's still related to this channel, but I'm trying to find the path to the freetype library (http://www.freetype.org/) , the package name is libfreetype6 , I have to specify the path to this lib when compiling php, here is the different paths I can see for this package : http://pastebin.com/mYe69SLP , which one do you think it is? thx
2012-09-26T22:27:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	copy and paste that name in the search bar located above in Synaptic packaga manager
2012-09-26T22:29:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	that's what I've done, then I clicked on properties of the package, and from there I could see this file list, but I don't see what is the lib path? As there are many different ones.
2012-09-26T22:33:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	I'm not even sure it's this package, I can also see a libfreetype6-dev package, I've installed it to, but for this one too there is a lot of files
2012-09-26T22:33:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	it seems you have to check each directory by your self :)
2012-09-26T22:34:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	ok no problem, but what should I look for?
2012-09-26T22:34:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	I don't really know :(
2012-09-26T22:36:00.000Z	sayers		hath, hadth nice spell.
2012-09-26T22:37:00.000Z	bibi23	sayers	ok :( , thx for your help with synaptic, at least I learned that!
2012-09-26T22:37:00.000Z	sayers	bibi23	I feel bad for you :(
