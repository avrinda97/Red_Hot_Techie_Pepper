2007-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Can anybody recommend a dual core mobo tested with ubuntu?  Mine is not supported...
2007-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	shatrat	JuJuBee	intel chipsets should work well.
2007-03-13T09:00:00.000Z	shatrat	JuJuBee	what do you mean not supported?
2007-03-13T09:01:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Been trying to find out why I cannot install ubuntu... several people helped here and #kubuntu.  No luck.  Even tried to boot DSL no luck. It appears that right after the kernel loads, it forgets how to read the cdrom.
2007-03-13T09:01:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Using a new INTEL DG965wh mobo
2007-03-13T09:02:00.000Z	shatrat	JuJuBee	sounds more likely its the cd-rom, have you tried a different one?
2007-03-13T09:02:00.000Z	JuJuBee	shatrat	: yes
2007-03-13T09:03:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Even tried to install onto HD using different computer and put HD back in... no luck. Installed windows and it boots and installs fine.
2007-03-13T09:03:00.000Z	shatrat	JuJuBee	and did you try stuff like ide=nodma and stuff?
2007-03-13T09:03:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Me=linux noob
2007-03-13T09:03:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Tried nosplash & acpi=off.
2007-03-13T09:04:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I will give it a try
2007-03-13T09:04:00.000Z	shatrat	JuJuBee	pci=noacpi and ide=nodma are a few other things you could find. This is with the LiveCD? I assume youve checked to see that it isnt corrupt or burned wrong
2007-03-13T09:08:00.000Z	JuJuBee	shatrat	: yes tried both commands
2007-03-13T09:08:00.000Z	JuJuBee		genii : core2 duo 2.13
2007-03-13T09:09:00.000Z	JuJuBee	shatrat	: yes booting form live cd.  No errors.
2007-03-13T09:10:00.000Z	JuJuBee		K
2007-03-13T09:10:00.000Z	JuJuBee		What is that?
2007-03-13T09:12:00.000Z	shatrat	JuJuBee	there are other methods to install you might try.  usb stick, minimal cd, network...https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
