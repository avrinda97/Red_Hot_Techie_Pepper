2009-02-19T07:38:00.000Z	jbuncher		I bought a 1TB external drive, formatted FAT32.  Is there a way to make a backup drive image (COMPRESSED) so that I can format the drive ext3 but still restore it to the fat32 state if I want to return it in the future?
2009-02-19T07:39:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	yes with partimage
2009-02-19T07:39:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	 can you give an example command?  I'm dl'ing it now
2009-02-19T07:40:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	do you have synaptic open?
2009-02-19T07:40:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	I just installed via apt-get
2009-02-19T07:40:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	synaptic is effectively jsut a gui front end for apt
2009-02-19T07:41:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	yes, I know :)  Does partimage compress "on-the-fly" or does it need to create the entire partition image before compressing?
2009-02-19T07:42:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	it will compress on the fly
2009-02-19T07:43:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	any idea how much space is needed for an image of a 1TB drive where ~500MB have been used?
2009-02-19T07:44:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	that would depend on the content, partimage used gzip so you could compress it with gzip and it should give you a rough idea,
2009-02-19T07:45:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	oh and the file would be a lot less than the amount used, if the rest of the partition as spare
2009-02-19T07:48:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	 I guess my last question would be, is there a program (fdisk, gparted) that is capable of making a 1TB fat32 partition?
2009-02-19T07:58:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	can gparted create and format 1TB partitions in fat32?
2009-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	yes
2009-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	thanks
2009-02-19T07:59:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	it cant create the parttitions but can back them up, use gparted to create the partition,
2009-02-19T08:00:00.000Z	koshari	jbuncher	its not a great ide to use fat32 for a 1tb partition
2009-02-19T08:02:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	I know, I plan to format to ext3, but I want to be able to restore the drive to its original state should I need to do so, hence the partition backup and the need to make a 1TB fat32 partition
2009-02-19T08:10:00.000Z	jbuncher	koshari	thanks for all of your help!
