2006-07-24T07:14:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	no, do u have volume control bound to a certain keyboard combination ?
2006-07-24T07:15:00.000Z	axyjo	passbe	no, i have it bound to only one key
2006-07-24T07:15:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	when u hit that key, a gui appears telling showing u the volume level i need to be able to control that gui

2006-07-24T07:19:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	yas thats correct that is the gui im talking about. Now i have a remote control and i already have the button controlling the volume, however im wondering if can bring up that gui, because u can set a keyboard key to activate the command
2006-07-24T07:19:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	i would like to find out what command is being run when i hit that key
2006-07-24T07:20:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	so i can use that command within the remotes configuration file
2006-07-24T07:20:00.000Z	axyjo	passbe	oh... you can just set it using lirc i think
2006-07-24T07:20:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	ive been searching ? damn that would be great if u could but haven't been able to
2006-07-24T07:21:00.000Z	axyjo	passbe	what?
2006-07-24T07:22:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	haha, ok say if you have the key "Ctr + G" set to volume up.
2006-07-24T07:23:00.000Z	passbe	axyjo	gnome must execute a command once ctr g is hit to bring up that Volume GUi, i would like that command ?? comprende ? soz
