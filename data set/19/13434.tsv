2005-04-09T16:17:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		its better than add/remove programs.... imo
2005-04-09T16:17:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		cause, it installes dependencies too :P
2005-04-09T16:17:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	that's why we use linux :)
2005-04-09T16:39:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	not with windows, i presume... ahahahaha :)
2005-04-09T16:39:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	dabugas	actually win98... long ago
2005-04-09T16:40:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	i'm not an insane techie or anything but to get DVDs to play in windows i had to close everything (incl. explorer) and use 640x480 16-bit.
2005-04-09T16:41:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	my friend you were fucking lucky, i have a (borrowed) geforce 440 mx and a (bought... spend a lot of dosh on this) TEAC DVD-R
2005-04-09T16:41:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	and _still_ windows was just freeze-framing all over the place
2005-04-09T16:41:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	dabugas	did you use a cache?
2005-04-09T16:42:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	a bit...
2005-04-09T16:42:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	still, that shouldn't be necessary with anything above 300-400 mhz computers
2005-04-09T16:44:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	& i'm running bloatware gnome... and still dvds play much better. the funny thing is that DVD Shrink under wine is more responsive under linux. don't get me started... grrr ;)
2005-04-09T16:45:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	dabugas	thats really weird hehe
2005-04-09T16:46:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	i used to use larswm (still a fave) or sawfish... but i've missed eye-candy so i'm sticking with gnome right now.
2005-04-09T16:47:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	but really, all versions of windows seems to bog down after a couple of months, linux always works (or doesn't... which is a pain in the ass :)
2005-04-09T16:48:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	dabugas	hehe - its mostly because of the filesystem - if you do use it again, make lotsa partitions, one for swap too
2005-04-09T16:48:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	windows or linux? i lost ya
2005-04-09T16:49:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	dabugas	in windows lol
2005-04-09T16:50:00.000Z	dabugas	^thehatsrule^	i've been mostly running linux since '98 with a few digressions into windows. i went to windows because they work better... in the beginning. but windows is an ungrateful servant that will stab you in the back several violent and bloody times. not worth it, in my opinion.
