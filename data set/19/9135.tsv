2008-06-19T08:52:00.000Z	chronographer		Hi all. Can someone help me install this software: http://savi.sourceforge.net/ I have installed dependencies I think, I get this when running make: http://pastebin.com/m38b4e231
2008-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	chronographer		Please someone help with software installation, compiling and all that, see above post
2008-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	chronographer		savi is not in repositories
2008-06-19T08:54:00.000Z	chronographer		oooh. install those?
2008-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	chronographer	not sure, I was expecting something from the tcl/tk stuff. Might be wrong with those
2008-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	chronographer		hmm. i installed tcl and tk and tcl-dev and tk-dev and stuff...
2008-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	chronographer		which folks would just provide debs!
2008-06-19T08:57:00.000Z	chronographer		try a few local ones out?
2008-06-19T08:57:00.000Z	nickrud	chronographer	I'd try the tkchooser then, seems closest :)
2008-06-19T08:57:00.000Z	chronographer		tkchooser?
2008-06-19T08:58:00.000Z	chronographer	nickrud	I don't understand
2008-06-19T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	chronographer	bad choice, tkchooser isn't the package you want. It was one of the !found ones
2008-06-19T08:59:00.000Z	chronographer		ok.
2008-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	chronographer		maybe I need tclx ?
2008-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	chronographer	but that's the error, line 31 in your output
2008-06-19T09:01:00.000Z	chronographer		http://lists.puredata.info/pipermail/pd-list/2001-11/003633.html   <- maybe this will help...
2008-06-19T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	chronographer	yeah, those both sound like they would work. The former would be easiest for me
2008-06-19T09:02:00.000Z	chronographer		bloody hell, I don't really want to change the bloody code....
2008-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	nickrud	chronographer	welcome to compiling code in linux. Not uncommon to tweak stuff to a distribution
