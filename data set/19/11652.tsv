2006-03-13T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	How do I check / what do I do about it?
2006-03-13T06:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	I suppose.  It makes me a little uneasy, but we'll see.
2006-03-26T07:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	ntfs.  My main Windows install one.
2006-03-26T07:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	Now if only I still had one...
2006-03-26T07:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	I'll do that if I can't borrow it back, yeah.
2006-03-26T08:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	Live CD would kill my grub and I'd have to recover that, right?
2006-03-26T08:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	But I'm changing the partition table and stuff...
2006-03-26T08:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	Okay.
2006-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	I don't know percentages, so i'm not sure.  Still holds true that it's better to make sure you've looked first though of course.  (But yeah, I've used them on occasion.)
2006-05-19T16:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	Yeah.
2006-05-19T16:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	Oh, don't get me started on Skype though...linux version is buggy and that annoys me.
2006-05-19T16:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	Ah.
2007-01-25T12:51:00.000Z	HymnToLife	tonyyarusso	do you have a homebuilt keyboard ? :p
2007-01-25T12:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	No, ThinkPad.
2007-01-25T12:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HymnToLife	I think Lenovo may have thrown one on there now, but they didn't when I got mine.
