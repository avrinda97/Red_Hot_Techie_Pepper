2005-08-08T05:29:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	no sorry. I just read spreadsheet program so I answered the call ;-)
2005-08-08T05:32:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	nice :)
2005-08-08T05:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	dpkg -l
2005-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	jasoncohen, K-Rich, thnx guys :D
2005-08-09T12:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	did I reccomend you to SciTE? ;)
2005-08-09T12:20:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	don't think so. But I already checked the FAQ/Dox :-|
2005-08-09T12:21:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	why do you use SciTE ?
2005-08-09T12:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	hmmmm... I'm not sure, really
2005-08-09T12:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	I used to use it on a Windows box
2005-08-09T12:21:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	I use it on my Ubuntu box. But somehow it won't accept my properties. (I used apt-get to install it)
2005-08-09T12:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	can you force it to open a config file, like pass it a parameter?
2005-08-09T12:22:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	how would I do it? (example ? )
2005-08-09T12:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	try reading the manpage
2005-08-09T12:23:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	is the parameter thing mandatory ?
2005-08-09T12:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	possibly
2005-08-09T12:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SWAT_	but, you can then put it in a shortcut of sorts, so you just click the button, et voila
2005-08-09T12:36:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Razor-X	somehow I can't find how I could set an entire config file as a parameter. I even used google (probably missused). Can you help me out here?
