2010-08-12T21:10:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	i tried that. doesnt work.. my sound preferences -> output tab -> shows dummy output.. i had 5 output devices before i screwed up things trying to fix ear phones audio
2010-08-12T21:13:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	i can see u are busy.. plz ping me when u are free..
2010-08-12T21:14:00.000Z	tucemiux	ramk	 reinstall alsa drivers, look for the "Refreshing/Reinstalling the drivers" portion: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting
2010-08-12T21:14:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	i ll try that. thanks
2010-08-12T21:15:00.000Z	tucemiux	ramk	and from what i have experienced, you can reinstall the drivers fine and it will work however some things will need to be manually configured, for that you will need to read the entire page and get the exact drivers that you need, that page will show you how, ive never bothered -- once I got sound working I didnt care that the buttons on my laptop no longer worked
2010-08-12T21:20:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	sudo aplay -l
2010-08-12T21:23:00.000Z	tucemiux	ramk	that means you have to install the drivers, your sound card isnt even being recognized, have you tried rebooting your machine?
2010-08-12T21:25:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	yeah i tried, also, when i say "lspci -v | less" i can see "00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06)"
2010-08-12T21:31:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	did something using modprobe.. going to restart now..
2010-08-12T21:32:00.000Z	tucemiux	ramk	sorry but I'm afraid you will have to follow the guide, the times i've hosed my audio I just renistalled alsa and it worked, looks like you have to configure the drivers and everything in the guide
2010-08-12T21:36:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	restarted and all the modules probed using "sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel" is gone !!?
2010-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	tucemiux	ramk	sorry but I'm afraid you will have to follow the guide, the times i've hosed my audio I just renistalled alsa and it worked, looks like you have to configure the drivers and everything in the guide
2010-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	ramk	tucemiux	ok
