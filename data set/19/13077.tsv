2005-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	that would be the first step, yes.
2005-11-26T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	whatever you decide to do, you can't do partition operations on a mounted partition
2005-11-26T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	get a Live CD
2005-11-26T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	gparted comes on the ubuntu livecd, yes
2005-11-26T09:37:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	the ONLY time you need to reboot is when you've upgraded a kernel
2005-11-26T09:39:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	is is supported by ubuntu?
2005-11-26T09:43:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	open your network-admin
2005-11-26T09:45:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	i'm not sure how to start that type of device
2005-11-26T09:47:00.000Z	nalioth	prodenter	no, use sudo
