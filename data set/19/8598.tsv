2008-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	I'll start you off.
2008-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	ty, pm? :)
2008-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	Nah, right here. I think technically we're suppose to give support in channel.
2008-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	CShadowRun		ok :)
2008-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	Though I have nothign really against PM.
2008-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	Have you downloaded the latest source you wanted?
2008-07-26T07:07:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	it's just easier since the channel is easy
2008-07-26T07:07:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	yea i downloaded it
2008-07-26T07:07:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	kcool
2008-07-26T07:07:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	If you've never built something from source, you'll need to "sudo apt-get install build-essentials"
2008-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	yea i got that :)
2008-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	Generally it's as simple as running "./configure" then "make" then "sudo make install"
2008-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	ah cool ty :)
2008-07-26T07:09:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	Depending on the output of "./configure" - often you'll need to install a few "SOMETHING-dev" packages
2008-07-26T07:09:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	nope lol, gone straight through. ty :D
2008-07-26T07:09:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	and it fixed the bug i had in the amsn in the repos, yay \o/
2008-07-26T07:09:00.000Z	wweasel	CShadowRun	Yay! I use Pidgin, but I've used aMSN in the past.
2008-07-26T07:10:00.000Z	CShadowRun	wweasel	i use IRC for everything (via bitlbee) i just need amsn for the file sending/webcam support which pidgin doesn't have :p
