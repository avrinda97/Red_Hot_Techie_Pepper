2009-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	Bluey		mike - by definition max is max
2009-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	the max from "mouse preferences"
2009-10-12T09:15:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- I guess I don't understand why you need the mouse pointer to move faster then the maximum setting?
2009-10-12T09:15:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	with this mouse, it is still not sensitive enough
2009-10-12T09:16:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- what kind of mouse do you have?
2009-10-12T09:16:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	3M EM500
2009-10-12T09:17:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- I'd go spend $10 and get a new mouse - that might be your cheapest best solution -- I didn't know 3m made mice, and that might be the crux of the problem.
2009-10-12T09:17:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- wally's world sells them.
2009-10-12T09:17:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	it is a special mouse, nobody else makes one like this
2009-10-12T09:18:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	oh, they don't sell any like this
2009-10-12T09:20:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	yeah it ergonomic "vertical" mouse, works fine just the sensitivity is too low for my taste
2009-10-12T09:21:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- don't know what to say....
2009-10-12T09:21:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- might contact the manufacturer to see of their are new models, or the arthritis foundation to see what they recommend...
2009-10-12T09:21:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	there might be a setting affected by mouse preferences that can manually edited to a higher value
2009-10-12T09:22:00.000Z	Bluey	MikeChelen	- unfortunately beyond my knowledge level
2009-10-12T09:22:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	this is pretty much the best model of its type
2009-10-12T09:22:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	yeah mine too, thanks anyway :)
2009-10-12T09:24:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	yeah normal mice are not a natural position for the hand. maybe i'll try a stylus & touchpad
2009-10-12T09:26:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Bluey	the only trouble is good large touchpads are alot pricier than mice
