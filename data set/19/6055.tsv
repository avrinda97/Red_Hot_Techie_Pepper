2008-03-26T14:00:00.000Z	tristano		hello all. i need to know my dhcp server address in order to using to configure properly another o.s., someone can help me? thanks
2008-03-26T14:02:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	what is your computers address?
2008-03-26T14:02:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	what?
2008-03-26T14:02:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	if your on linux: type ifconfig
2008-03-26T14:03:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	already done
2008-03-26T14:04:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	inet addr: 1.237.49.x bcast: 1.237.55.255 mask: 255.255.248.0
2008-03-26T14:05:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	that ip address isn't exactly right, the inet address is what we need
2008-03-26T14:06:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	it should be something like: 192.168.100.100
2008-03-26T14:06:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	i haven't an usable external IP address
2008-03-26T14:06:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	1.237.49.xxx is my address
2008-03-26T14:07:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	I'm not trying to find your external ip address, I'm going to guess what your dhcp server address is based upon your computers address
2008-03-26T14:08:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	with windows xp it's easy to know ti (ipconfig /all), but i remember it's completely different by ip address
2008-03-26T14:08:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	does the computer you're using get it's ip address from your router or whatever you are using for a dhcp server?
2008-03-26T14:08:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	ifconfig is the same thing in linux
2008-03-26T14:09:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	but doesn't say me which is my dhcp server address, differently by windows
2008-03-26T14:09:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	i use linux for 5 years, but it's the first time that i have this trouble
2008-03-26T14:11:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	usually it's the lowest number of whatever subnet you are on: eg if your ip address is 192.168.1.105 then your dhcp server would be 192.168.1.1
2008-03-26T14:13:00.000Z	tristano	pat5star	ok, but: inte addr: 1.237.49.xxx, default gateway addr: 1.237.48.1 ...
2008-03-26T14:14:00.000Z	pat5star	tristano	I've got to go, sry...hopefully someone else can help
