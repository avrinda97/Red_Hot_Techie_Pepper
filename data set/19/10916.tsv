2006-06-15T11:07:00.000Z	keleus		font anti-aliasing?
2006-06-15T11:07:00.000Z	keleus		it should be up by default. but yea, its around...
2006-06-15T11:07:00.000Z	keleus		pain in the but to configure by hand
2006-06-15T11:08:00.000Z	keleus		driver?
2006-06-15T11:08:00.000Z	keleus		er...
2006-06-15T11:09:00.000Z	keleus		"i meen lol"?
2006-06-15T11:10:00.000Z	keleus		i use azureus straight from sourceforge. i extract and run it from my home directory (useing blackdawn java)
2006-06-15T11:11:00.000Z	keleus		its out of date...
2006-06-15T11:11:00.000Z	neutrinomass	keleus	But the repositories are the preferred means of getting software :)
2006-06-15T11:12:00.000Z	keleus	neutrinomass	or running it as a user from in your home directory is safer :)
2006-06-15T11:12:00.000Z	keleus	neutrinomass	im a freak... i have a nonpriveledged user for most of my non-system network-listening programs
2006-06-15T11:13:00.000Z	neutrinomass	keleus	That has nothing to do with getting it from the repository. Installing software from outside the repository breaks things and you never need to run azureus as sudo AFAIK
2006-06-15T11:14:00.000Z	keleus	neutrinomass	how would extracting a java binary to /home/user/azureus and running it from there break things? its not an installer...
2006-06-15T11:15:00.000Z	neutrinomass	keleus	Well to begin with, it's inconvenient because it won't update itself :P
2006-06-15T11:15:00.000Z	keleus	neutrinomass	er, azureus has auto-updates... and the repository version installes a crapload of unecessary dependencies (including a version of java i dont want)
2006-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	neutrinomass	keleus	OK then, I agree :)
2006-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	neutrinomass	keleus	I agree 90% and give up 10% :-p
