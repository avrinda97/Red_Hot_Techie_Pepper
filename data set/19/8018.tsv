2007-05-24T07:19:00.000Z	WindowLess		is there a way to get information on all the USB ports on my computer (back side and front side), to see their status and to know whether there's something wrong with them?
2007-05-24T07:20:00.000Z	WindowLess		how many ls- commands are there diabolix?
2007-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	WindowLess		i did lsusb and it showed only 3 lines. But I have more than 3 USB ports on my computer. what's wrong?
