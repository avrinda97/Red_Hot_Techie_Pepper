2005-07-01T08:06:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	yes, bashrc should be sourced in profile
2005-07-01T08:15:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	your profile is fine. perhaps /etc/profile is sick?
2005-07-01T08:15:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	i didn't touch it since install
2005-07-01T08:16:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	something still might have changed it... but this is fishing with long rods :)
2005-07-01T08:17:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	i just install hoary last night, and the apt-get upgrade
2005-07-01T08:18:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	ok, it shouldn't get rotten this quickly :)
2005-07-01T08:20:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	:)
2005-07-01T08:20:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	if i use 'su - username' then it's fine.
2005-07-01T08:21:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	what if you open a login shell with, say, "xterm -ls"
2005-07-01T08:23:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	cant do that right now, i am logged in as another user. all the login tests done at tty1,2,3...etc
2005-07-01T08:24:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	well it's all the same. those are login shells too :)
2005-07-01T08:27:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	seifu, sorry guys, i just found out that the user's default shell is not bash, i created the user like 'useradd xxx', seems the default shell is assigned '/bin/sh'
2005-07-01T08:28:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	sh is bash by default
2005-07-01T08:30:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	i just manually changed it to /bin/bash, then it;s all working fine now.
2005-07-01T08:30:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	very weird. what does 'ls -l /bin/sh' tell you
2005-07-01T08:30:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	/bin/sh -> bash
2005-07-01T08:31:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	i think bash wants to act like sh when you call him sh, :P
2005-07-01T08:36:00.000Z	topyli	blazin	there are hundreds of scripts on your system that set the sell to /bin/sh. let's hope they work :)
2005-07-01T08:36:00.000Z	blazin	topyli	:)
