2008-12-19T13:24:00.000Z	wubi		oh sorry bout that raylu
2008-12-19T13:24:00.000Z	wubi		anyway, my problem is this: i run ff3 from the terminal. and then after i closed ff3 i saw some strange error messages. can i paste them here?
2008-12-19T13:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	you should use a pastebin
2008-12-19T13:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	we need the pastebin url
2008-12-19T13:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	i'm not really sure. i'mnot really much of a 'mail' guy
2008-12-19T13:30:00.000Z	wubi	onetinsoldier	me too thats the strange part. i wasnt running evolution or any mail client.
2008-12-19T13:30:00.000Z	wubi	onetinsoldier	what does it mean "dirty records" - i mean can anybody see my "dirty" emails?
2008-12-19T13:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	hmm, when installing or anything did you ask to 'import' anything? have you configured any newsgroup or usenet?
2008-12-19T13:32:00.000Z	wubi	onetinsoldier	tiyowan: no newsgroup, no usenet, did not import anything, i hate email clients too - thats why i dont run em. its a pretty strange error messag
2008-12-19T13:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	it's not a very harmful or worrisome message. but yeah, i can see how it would make you wonder. no i have no idea
2008-12-19T13:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	are you using wubi? or is this under a real ubuntu install?
2008-12-19T13:35:00.000Z	wubi	onetinsoldier	real ubuntu alternative install, just did it a few hours ago.
2008-12-19T13:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	ok.. i'll suggest what i suggested to someone else as a fix to their FF3 problem, but i have my doubts this will stop this message
2008-12-19T13:36:00.000Z	wubi	onetinsoldier	moving the .mozilla folder? after googling i think its an ff3 bug
2008-12-19T13:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	yes. moving the .mozilla was going to be my suggestion
2008-12-19T13:38:00.000Z	wubi	onetinsoldier	thanks ill try that too. im filing a bug for ff3 in mozilla...
2008-12-19T13:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	wubi	ok, good luck
