2009-01-10T11:22:00.000Z	garrettj		Ubuntu really needs a distinct walkthrough of everything important. Like a help file pointing out all the different options in the sound section. Specifically why there are 1000000000000000 options in the drop down menus.
2009-01-10T11:23:00.000Z	garrettj		and each option in those drop down menus makes different sounds come out of different speakers
2009-01-10T11:23:00.000Z	garrettj		makes no sense
2009-01-10T11:24:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	well theres man pages for that, granted they're kinda hard to understand at times, but they're there.
2009-01-10T11:26:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	type man find in a terminal
2009-01-10T11:36:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	you may be the most awesome guy ever
2009-01-10T11:29:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	when I go to synaptic manager, there are like 100 things to do with pulse, do I install them all?
2009-01-10T11:30:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	hmm i would just install pulseaudio, that other stuff listed there are just extras i beleive, at any rate, once you choose pulseaudio, it will pull in everything else it needs anyways
2009-01-10T11:31:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	thanks I appreciate it, I'll give it ago... I'm also having a problem getting sound with flash
2009-01-10T11:32:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras'  *MIGHT* work for that flash sound issue, im not a flash guru really, but try that.
2009-01-10T11:32:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	I'll give a quick try
2009-01-10T11:35:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	what is this downloading? seems like a lot of stuff :D
2009-01-10T11:35:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	various codecs and what not needed to for flash, mp3, dvd stuff
2009-01-10T11:37:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	lol I'm still kinda new at this myself but I've learned a few basics in this channel to be able to help you with those questions you had :)
2009-01-10T11:38:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	reboot time woooo
2009-01-10T11:42:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	man it didn't work, but my sound settings may not be right in the generic section. Do you mind if I pm and pick your brain on basic sound stuff?
2009-01-10T11:42:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	im not a sound guy, so i prolly wouldnt be much help sorry
2009-01-10T11:42:00.000Z	garrettj	eseven73	ok thanks anyway :D
2009-01-10T11:43:00.000Z	eseven73	garrettj	np good luck :)
