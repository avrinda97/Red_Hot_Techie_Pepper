2009-02-04T03:06:00.000Z	ToT		hello, is there anyone who wants to help me bring up a wireless network interface?
2009-02-04T03:07:00.000Z	ToT		I am running Kubuntu 8.10 and I have a wireless card with acx111 driver
2009-02-04T03:07:00.000Z	ToT		this driver doesn't support network manager
2009-02-04T03:07:00.000Z	ToT		so i have to bring up the interface in the old fashioned way
2009-02-04T03:07:00.000Z	ToT		with /etc/network/interfaces
2009-02-04T03:07:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	imo that's the way yo configure your network
2009-02-04T03:09:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	can you pastebin what you are doing with the iwconfig commands?
2009-02-04T03:09:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	i myself use wpa_supplicant, ifplugd and guessnet to configure my wireless and wired netwerok

2009-02-04T03:14:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	you could also use a post-up script
2009-02-04T03:14:00.000Z	ToT	slacker_nl	I'm just wondering why it doesn't work anymore, because it used to work with my /etc/network/interface file
2009-02-04T03:14:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	aha
2009-02-04T03:14:00.000Z	ToT	slacker_nl	how do post-up scripts work?
2009-02-04T03:16:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	I see you are german, maybe you are interessted in this page: http://www.aaron-spettl.de/ubuntu/dynamische-netzwerkkonfiguration.php
2009-02-04T03:17:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	http://pb.opperschaap.net/101 something like this
2009-02-04T03:17:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	the example is with pre-up and post-down, but the idea is the same
2009-02-04T03:18:00.000Z	ToT	slacker_nl	: thank you
2009-02-04T03:18:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ToT	np
