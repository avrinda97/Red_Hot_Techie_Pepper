2009-05-06T01:28:00.000Z	olivier_		Hi there ! Is anyone know how to make my tv sound work in 9.04 ? I use a 7134 tv chip and run a p5q3 motherboard
2009-05-06T01:30:00.000Z	olivier_		I can see there's sound input in the viewmeter related to the tv activity but still no sound output
2009-05-06T01:31:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	have you tried moving the stream to another output device in that pavucontrol window yet ?
2009-05-06T01:34:00.000Z	olivier_	glitsj16	haven't saw that yet, what do you recommend ? I have an output device that is my TV card, and Now that I've unclicked the 'shield' button, I can see the viewmeter moving accordlingly to the tv, but still no sound
2009-05-06T01:37:00.000Z	olivier_	glitsj16	no idea ?
2009-05-06T01:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	looking at your former messages, hang on please
2009-05-06T01:40:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	are you taking about the pulseaudio viewmeter ? if so, that indicates pulseaudio is getting something, try opening "pavucontrol" and moving the output stream to another device to see if you can get output somewhere
2009-05-06T01:44:00.000Z	olivier_	glitsj16	I think I was in the pulseaudio viewmeter, but now I see the viewmeter of pavucontrol, which activated once I've unclicked the 'shield' button in front of each saa7134 device (PCM,Analog, and monitor of Analog). What do you mean 'moving the output stream to another device' ? I don't see how to do that in pavucontrol.
2009-05-06T01:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	there's a small dropdown indicator next to the un/mute symbol of each playback item, it offers a 'move stream' option
2009-05-06T01:47:00.000Z	olivier_	glitsj16	noticed that already, but there no other entry in this menu than "Default'
2009-05-06T01:48:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	that's possible indeed, was hoping you had some of those virtual devices in there for pulseaudio, sorry
2009-05-06T01:49:00.000Z	olivier_	glitsj16	nothing I can do so ?
2009-05-06T01:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	i take it you've already tried stopping all audio apps and restarting pulseaudio ?
2009-05-06T01:52:00.000Z	olivier_	glitsj16	you suggest I should stop pulseaudio ? would I have sound though ?
2009-05-06T01:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	like Slart says, there could be a running pulseaudio daemon that's bogged down , try "killall pulseaudio; pulseaudio -D" to restart it
2009-05-06T01:53:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	i wouldn't go down the route of removing pulseaudio just yet, see what a restart does first
2009-05-06T01:55:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	too bad, i don't know anything on tvtime to be able to offer any real help there i'm afraid
2009-05-06T02:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	well, that redirection was what i proposed to check earlier, only thing i could find is http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=723618
2009-05-06T02:15:00.000Z	glitsj16	olivier_	have you tried asking on pulseaudio irc yet ? http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/Community has the address
