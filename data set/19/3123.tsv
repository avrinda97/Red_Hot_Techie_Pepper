It would help if you described your problem and maybe linked to the output of this script (collects good data about alsa setup and function):  http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh (using "bash alsa-info.sh"), and upload directly or pastebin.
2010-08-20T09:18:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	i try to pastebin the whole output from the script
2010-08-20T09:20:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	if you choose Y during running, it will upload it automatically, or it creates a file in /tmp (it tells you at the end). You could pastebin that file.

2010-08-20T09:24:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	i ran the script newly , here is the whole output: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=13cb3380907ba9afa27a15bdbc9a62703edb0269
2010-08-20T09:24:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	i'm looking it over...
2010-08-20T09:28:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	it looks fine. what's the problem? You may have to change Profile in Hardware tab of System->Preferences->Sound.
2010-08-20T09:28:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	yes, all looks well after i installed the latest driver with the script. but, still no sound.
2010-08-20T09:30:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	do you get sound with this command "speaker-test -c 2 -t wav" ?
2010-08-20T09:33:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	i tried now all profiles under hardware tab, no success... also i tried to play a wav file with aplay, no sound. the speaker-test command is running now... but till now, no sound
2010-08-20T09:35:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	i'm thinking either IEC958 setting in alsamixer/gnome-alsamixer or trying different audio ports. What jack/output are you attempting to get sound from?
2010-08-20T09:38:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	in gnome-alsamixer it shows me a realtek ALC1200, the IEC958 is also selected. but the tab names ALC1200
2010-08-20T09:40:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	ALC1200 is the codec which i found as i tried to figure out which card i really have.
2010-08-20T09:41:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	the option there was to de-select IEC958, and try speakertest
2010-08-20T09:43:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	i deselected the IEC in gnome alsamixer and now i try speakertest newly. but still nothing to hear from the speakers
2010-08-20T09:45:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	how are your speakers connected? which port? sometimes the ports are mangled and you have to use the port called "Front"
2010-08-20T09:45:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	the speakers are built in, it is a laptop...
2010-08-20T09:45:00.000Z	thune3	ortsvorsteher	checking something...
2010-08-20T10:14:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	thune3	i was disconnected...
