2010-07-03T06:37:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	trying that now
2010-07-03T06:37:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	Also to reset all compiz settings, use ccsm>Preferences>Reset to Defaults
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	Install simple-ccsm package, then select Custom from gnome-appearance-properties (sys>prefes>appearance>visual effects)
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	reinstalling compiz will effectively accomplish nothing
2010-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	that's my suspicion as well
2010-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	I'm wondering if my config is just old enough that the newer gnome doesn't like saving it, or something similar
2010-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	Install simple-ccsm package, then select Custom from gnome-appearance-properties (sys>prefes>appearance>visual effects) then you might want to close all windows and go to sys>prefs>startup applications>options and click Remember Currently Running Applications
2010-07-03T06:42:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	that made it worse. Now not only do I get no window decorations when I login, but it draws my left monitor about 2" off the side of the screen until I go set it to normal again
2010-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	Did you hit the 'remember currently running applications button' after selecting Custom?
2010-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	no, because I'm still trying to get it to forget to start 4 gnome-terminals
2010-07-03T06:44:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	You exit out of all other windows first
2010-07-03T06:44:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	Close all windows and go to sys>prefs>startup applications>options and click Remember Currently Running Applications
2010-07-03T06:44:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	while compiz is running
2010-07-03T06:45:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	The problem is there is a bug where after upgrading, it will want to start compiz.real but it does not exist. It needs to be told to start 'compiz'
2010-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	It's a ubuntu thing
2010-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	ahh, okay
2010-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	that makes more sense :) I was thinking I probably had some obscure compiz setting somewhere that I'd forgotten about that it just wasn't compatible with
2010-07-03T06:50:00.000Z	dive-o	soreau	that worked perfectly :) thanks!
2010-07-03T06:50:00.000Z	soreau	dive-o	Cool, gald to help ;-)
