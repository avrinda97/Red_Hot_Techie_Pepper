2007-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	xbye		how can I get music onto my iPod from rhythmbox?
2007-06-15T05:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	with rhythmbox, i'm not sure, but amarok works great with an ipod.
2007-06-15T05:44:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	thanks. I've heard good things about Amarok but i'm trying to avoid installing and loading all the kde libs
2007-06-15T05:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	well, then youcould try either banshee, or gtkpod, but i don't think either of them work as well as amarok.
2007-06-15T05:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	but i see your point.
2007-06-15T05:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	i had a lot of probs with banshee and gtkpod...
2007-06-15T05:47:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	out of curiosity, are you running KDE or gnome?
2007-06-15T05:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	gnome... KDE is the devil..lol, only kde apps I use is Ktorrent and Amarok, and thats only becuase they are 100% superior to their gnome counterparts
2007-06-15T06:34:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	amarok is amazing
2007-06-15T06:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	told you, its the best for ipod if you ask me..
2007-06-15T06:35:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	do you know of a way to have it automatically organize imported songs?
2007-06-15T06:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	by what?.. artist name?
2007-06-15T06:36:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	Artist/Album/TrackNum Track Name.mp3 format
2007-06-15T06:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	i don't know, have all mine marked as "My Music" album.., then just organize them by artist.. it works fine.
2007-06-15T06:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	i've not messed with organizing to much
2007-06-15T06:37:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	I guess it's not really necessary, since I'll see all my songs organized by ID3 tags eveyrwhere anyways
2007-06-15T06:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	true, but you might look around the options..
2007-06-15T07:01:00.000Z	xbye	IndyGunFreak	i finally found how to import and organize files in amarok.. right click and "Copy files to collection" in the Files view. now I have all the features I was looking for =)
2007-06-15T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	xbye	cool..
