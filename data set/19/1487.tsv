2011-01-10T23:54:00.000Z	justask	Scuttle	you mean you can boot from them?
2011-01-10T23:54:00.000Z	justask		ciao luca
2011-01-10T23:55:00.000Z	Scuttle	justask	oh no, they're just drives with files on them, but fdisk identifies them as HPFS/NTFS-partitions
2011-01-10T23:55:00.000Z	Scuttle		no reason to not go with 5.
2011-01-10T23:55:00.000Z	Scuttle		5.1....
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	justask		so you are able to mount them though
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	justask		or not
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	Scuttle		I am
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	Scuttle		they mount fine, as ext4-partitions
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	justask		it's a raid setup or anything like?
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	justask		that's odd :-)
2011-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	Scuttle	justask	nope, just a bunch of disk :)
2011-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	Scuttle		20 of them to be specific...
2011-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	justask		so single disks, not even lvm or logical arrays?
2011-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	Scuttle	justask	not even that. running greyhole though
2011-01-10T23:58:00.000Z	justask		what is greyhole, sorry
2011-01-10T23:58:00.000Z	Scuttle		greyhole.net, Samba drive-pooling
2011-01-10T23:59:00.000Z	justask		is it meant to share on windows?
2011-01-10T23:59:00.000Z	Scuttle	justask	samba is...
