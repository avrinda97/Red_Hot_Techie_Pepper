2008-03-16T02:07:00.000Z	SliM1		anyone? please? no window borders :(
2008-03-16T02:08:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	like you don't see the x or the title bar?
2008-03-16T02:09:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	regular ubuntu, right?
2008-03-16T02:09:00.000Z	SliM1	mDemocritus	that's while using compiz
2008-03-16T02:09:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	OH
2008-03-16T02:09:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	common
2008-03-16T02:09:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	it happened after you ran compiz -replace right?
2008-03-16T02:10:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	does alt-f2 work?
2008-03-16T02:11:00.000Z	SliM1	mDemocritus	let me try my pidgin exec plugin
2008-03-16T02:11:00.000Z	SliM1	mDemocritus	yes, alt+f2 works
2008-03-16T02:11:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	run compiz -replace
2008-03-16T02:12:00.000Z	SliM1	mDemocritus	well, yes, it doesn't help
2008-03-16T02:12:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	rats
2008-03-16T02:12:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	 i think metacity --replace will get your borders back, but shut down the windows effects
2008-03-16T02:13:00.000Z	SliM1	mDemocritus	a bit off-topic, is there a way to start a program from the terminal (i. e., just start it, and get the prompt back as soon as the program has started)
2008-03-16T02:14:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	you can run a command in the background like this example: ls -l /home/user &
2008-03-16T02:15:00.000Z	mDemocritus	SliM1	ending the command with the ampersand runs it in the background, but it can sometimes be wierd
